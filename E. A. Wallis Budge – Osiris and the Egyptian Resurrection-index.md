OSIRIS AND THE EGYPTIAN
RESURRECTION
CHAPTER XIV.
THE SHRINES, MIRACLE PLAY, AND &quot; MYSTERIES &quot; OF OSIRIS.
IT is impossible to state when and where the first
shrines in honour of Osiris were built in Egypt, but it is
tolerably certain that his most ancient shrine in the
South was at Abydos, and his most ancient shrine in the
North at Busiris, and that the cult of the god was firmly established in these places at the beginning of, if not
before, the Dynastic Period. Of these the older is
probably Abtu (Abydos), for every tradition about the
worship of Osiris asserts his head to have been buried
there, and the importance of Abydos, even in the earliest
times, appears to have been due to the fact that the
town contained his head, the most important part of the god s body. Abydos was, moreover, quite near to
Netat, or Netit, 1 the town on the Nile, or great canal of
the district, near which Osiris was murdered by Set, and
it was more natural for I sis when she found her husband s dead body there to take it to Abydos than to
some more remote town. And as the symbol of the
city and its name was the coffer, or basket, which
contained the head of Osiris, with plumes above the
coffer and a serpent passing through it,
m
^t\ , we may
assume that the connection of the city with the cult of Osiris was exceedingly ancient. Tattu (Busiris),
in the Delta, which contained the backbone of Osiris n,
was undoubtedly the most important of all the shrines of
Osiris in the North, but it never enjoyed the reputation and
fame of Abydos.



2 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
It is idle to speculate on the form of the shrine of
Osiris under the first three dynasties, but it was
probably a small building made of mud strengthened
with reeds, and covered over with a wooden roof. Inside it was probably a figure of the god seated on
a throne with steps, and near it was his characteristic
symbol, either laid upon the ground, or supported
on a stand. The cleaning and preservation of his
shrine were, no doubt, committed to the care of a
special body of men, who thus became his priests, and
received the offerings made to him, and made arrange
ments for his festivals and for the performance of the
annual play, in which his sufferings, death, and resurrec
tion were acted. No details of these matters are found in the earliest texts, but we know from the evidence of
the inscriptions that such a play was performed at
Abydos once a year under the Middle and New
Empires, and it is only reasonable to assume that it reproduced all the essential features of the great annual
festival of the god which was celebrated under the
Ancient Empire. In religious matters at least the con
servatism of the ancient Egyptians was absolute.
When the worship of Osiris was first established at Abydos the inhabitants of the district worshipped Seker,
the god of Death, the two Ap-uati gods, Anubis, An-her, Khenti Amenti, etc., but by the close of the Vlth dynasty
Osiris had become the chief god of the district, and all
the local forms of the above-mentioned gods had become
subordinate to him. The fame of the god who rose
from the dead himself, and could make his followers to rise from death to life immortal, had spread to all parts
of Egypt, and the bodies of the wealthy who died in
other parts of Egypt were taken there and buried. It
was believed that the dead who were buried at Abydos
would be joined by the god to his company of followers
in the Other World, that they would enjoy his protec
tion, and that they would share in his offerings on
festival days, and become partakers with him in immor
tality and everlasting happiness. The aim of every
good man was to become an Osiris, and even in the
Pyramid Texts we find it tacitly assumed that the kings
for whom they were written had each become an



Shrines, Miracle Play, and &quot;
Mysteries&quot; 3
Osiris, and the name of Osiris is actually prefixed to the
names of some of them. Osiris had become the god of
the dead, par excellence, and Abydos was the earthly
centre of his kingdom. Very few Egyptians who were not natives of the neighbourhood could afford to buy
tombs there and be buried in them, and the transport of
mummified bodies from a great distance was both
difficult and costly. Nevertheless, many men were so eager
that their dead bodies should rest on the sacred soil of
Abydos, and be near Osiris, if only for a short time, that
it became the custom among the well-to-do classes
to transport the mummies of their kinsfolk to Abydos so
that they might absorb the beneficent emanations from
the shrine of the-god^and be blessed by the influence of
the place and its holy associations. These mummies
were then taken back by river to the places whence they
came, and buried in the tombs which had been provided
for them. The popularity of Osiris could not fail to be of material benefit, not only to his priesthood, but also
to the town of Abydos in general. The old mud shrine
of the god would disappear, and a building made of
wood or stone take its place, and his festivals would be celebrated with greater pomp and more lavish display.
His priesthood would become wealthy, and every servant
of his would benefit in every way by the great fame of
his god. During the great festival of Osiris at the end
of the year the plain round about Abydos would be
thronged with pilgrims from all parts of the country, and
at this time the inhabitants would gain enough to last
them for the remainder of the year.
The great festival of Shekh Sayyid al-Badawi at Tanta offers many parallels to the great festival of Osiris at
Abydos. At Tanta I have seen dead bodies brought in
and laid for a few moments by the tomb of the saint, or
simply carried round his tomb-chamber, in order to obtain
his blessing, and men and women stand motionless and silent by the iron gates of the tomb, merely to be
blessed by its presence, and to gain a share in the
spiritual benefits which are believed to emanate from it.
A large iron box for offerings stands near the tomb
gates, and though nine-tenths of the people are very
poor, their humble contributions are said to amount to



Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
. 40,000 a year. Similarly the revenue of Osiris,
though all the offerings were in kind, there being no
money in Egypt before the reign of Darius, must have
been very great, and his landed property large.
Of the history of Abydos and its god Osiris from the
end of the Vlth to the beginning of the Xllth dynasty
we know nothing, but under the kings of the Xllth
dynasty the worship of Osiris developed to an extra
ordinary degree, and his sanctuary attained to a position
of importance hitherto unknown. Thus in an inscription
published by Daressy, 1 we read that a king, probably Usertsen I, gave to Khenti-Amenti [Osiris] three metal
vases and an ebony censer-holder. From the stele of
Khent-em-semti, 2 an official of Amen-em-hat at Abydos,
we learn that Osiris was at that time called the &quot; lord of
life,&quot;
&quot; governor of eternity,&quot; and &quot; Ruler of Amenti,&quot;
i.e., the Other World, and that Abydos was the place to
which all souls flocked to obtain blessing, to eat bread
with the god, and to &quot; come forth by day.&quot; This official
had lived a righteous life, he says, so that Osiris might
be gracious to him in judgment, and permit him to enter
his holy boat. On the stele of I-kher-nefert we are told that Usertsen III ordered this official to go to Abydos
and build a sanctuary for Osiris, and to adorn his shrine
with some of the gold which the god had enabled him to
bring from Nubia after his victorious campaign in that country. I-kher-nefert carried out his lord s commands,
and built a shrine for Osiris made from sweet-smelling
woods, and inlaid with gold, silver, and lapis-lazuli, and he
made new shrines for the other gods of Abydos. He
drew up regulations for the service of the priests, and
defined the duties of each of them, and made careful arrangements for the celebration of festivals throughout
the year. He provided a new Neshmet Boat for Osiris,
i.e., a new copy of the famous boat in which Osiris set
sail on the expedition against Set in which he lost his
life, and added to it a suitable shrine wherein the figure
or statue of the god was to be placed. He made a new
statue of the god and decorated it with lapis-lazuli,
turquoise, silver-gold, and precious stones of all kinds,
1 Annaks du Service, torn. IV. 2 British Museum, No. 146 (574).



Shrines, Miracle Play, and &quot;
Mysteries&quot; 5
and it was as beautiful as the body of the god should be,
and he provided apparel and ornaments for the festal attire of Osiris. 1 In addition to the ordinary priests,
I-kher-nefert appointed a priest to the sanctuary at
Abydos whose title was &quot;
Sa-mer-f,&quot; 2
z&amp;gt;.,
&quot; his (the god s)
beloved son/1 This priest ministered in the &quot;golden
house,&quot; and directed all ceremonies which were per
formed in connection with the &quot; mystery of the Lord of
Abydos.&quot;
3 He had charge of all the sacred dresses and
ornaments of the god, and of all the furniture of the
shrine, which no hands but his might touch, and he
dressed the statue of Osiris for the festivals of the new moon and full moon each month, and directed the moving
of it when it was necessary to do so. No one might
assist him in his sacred office except the Sem priest, who
also had to be a man of &quot; clean fingers/ 4
The second portion of the inscription on the stele of I-kher-nefert is of very great importance, for it describes
briefly the principal scenes in the Osiris play which was performed at Abydos annually. I-kher-nefert himself
played a prominent part in this &quot; Mystery play,&quot; and he
describes his own acts as follows :
&quot; I performed the coming forth of Ap-uat when he
set out to defend his father.&quot;
From this it is clear that in the Xllth dynasty Ap-uat
was regarded as the son of Osiris, and that he acted the part of leader of Osiris s expedition, which was repre
sented by a procession formed of priests and the ordinary
people. Ap-uat walked in front, next came the boat
containing the figure of the god and a company of priests
or &quot; followers &quot; of the god, and the rear was brought up by
a crowd of people.
&quot; I drove back the enemy from the Neshmet Boat, 5
I overthrew the foes of Osiris.&quot; The boat of the god was then attacked by a crowd

of men who represented the foes of Osiris, and, as the god
was defenceless, Ap-uat engaged them in combat, and
beat them off, and the procession then continued on its way in the temple.
&quot; I performed the Great Coming-forth, 1 I followed
the god in his footsteps.&quot;
This act was the greatest in the Osiris play, for it
represented the &quot; coming forth &quot; of Osiris from the
temple after his death, and the departure of his body to
his tomb. A solemn service was performed in the temple
before the body was carried from it, and offerings were
eaten sacramentally, and then the procession set out for the
tomb. When it reached the door of the temple it was
received by a mighty crowd of men and women who
raised the death-wail, and uttered piercing shrieks and
lamentations, and the women beat their breasts. 2 Many
of the men in the crowd were armed with sticks and staves, and some of them pressed forward towards
the procession with the view of helping the god, whilst
others strove to prevent them. Thus a sham fight took place, which, owing to the excitement of the combatants,
often degenerated into a serious one. And, if Herodotus
was correctly informed, 3 this combat with clubs was
waged with great obstinacy, and heads were broken, and
he says, though this the Egyptians denied, many men
died of the wounds which they received on this occasion.
This fight was, of course, intended to represent the great
battle which took place in prehistoric times between Set
and Osiris, when Osiris was killed. This battle, as has been already said, took place near Netit. Whether
Osiris was killed outright whilst fighting, or whether he
was wounded and taken prisoner by Set and slain after
wards, is not stated, but it is quite clear that for a time
no one knew what had become of the body of Osiris,
and that his followers went about on the battlefield searching for it. This search is referred to in the
words, &quot;
I followed the god in his footsteps,&quot; i.e., I traced
the god by his footsteps. I-kher-nefert played the

&quot;

part of leader of the search party, and their wander
ings probably occupied three days, during which the
sham fight between the followers of Osiris and the
followers of Set was repeated at intervals, and great
lamentations were made. All these events were repre
sented by the words &quot;
great coming-forth,&quot; which to every
Egyptian bore the most solemn significance.
At length the body of Osiris was found, but by whom is not said here.
[A passage in the text of Pepi I supplies the informa
tion, and shows that the finders of the body of Osiris
were Isis and Nephthys, and that they made known their
sad discovery to the gods of Pe by their cries of grief.
1
In answer to the appeal of Isis the god Thoth was sent
in his boat to convey the body from the dyke (?) of
Netat, or Netit, to its tomb. When Thoth arrived he saw Isis with the body, and the text says that when she
found it it was lying on one side, and that she caressed
the flesh, and fondled the hands, and embraced the body
of her husband.]2
The stele of I-kher-nefert goes on to say :
&quot;
I made the boat of the god to move, and Thoth
What exactly Thoth did is not certain, for the text is broken, but it is clear that I-kher-nefert acted the part of
a ferryman for Thoth, and that he went in a boat con
taining a figure of Thoth to bring the body of Osiris from
Netit to his tomb. The text continues :
&quot;
I provided the Boat of the Lord of Abydos called
&quot; Kha-em-Maat (i.e., appearing in truth ) with a cabin
&quot;
shrine, and I put on him his splendid apparel and
&quot; ornaments when he set out to go to the region (?) of
&quot;Peqer&quot; .

8 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
From this passage it is certain that Osiris did not go
to his grave in the Neshmet Boat, but in another boat
called Kha-em-Maat. Nothing is said here about the
mummification of the body of Osiris which took place
after it was brought from Netit, or of the elaborate
ceremonies which were performed in connection with it
by Horus and his Four Sons. These are mentioned in
several places in this book, and are, therefore, not described here. From an inscription quoted by Schafer1 we know that
the two feathers of Maati were fastened on the coffin, or
coffer, of Osiris, -Hk , and that a bandlet was tied about
the god s head, and that a model of his enemy Set was
placed at his feet. These things having been done, I-kher-nefert continues :
&quot; I directed the ways of the god to his tomb in
Peqer.&quot;
Here we have a definite statement that the body of
Osiris was buried, and that his tomb was situated in Peqer. But where was Peqer ? This question has been
satisfactorily answered by the extensive excavations of
M. Amdineau at Abydos, 2 who proved that Peqer is a
portion of the great plain of Abydos which lies about a
mile and a half from the temple of Osiris, and which is
known to-day by the Arabic name of Umm al-Ka ab, i.e.,
&quot; mother of pots,&quot; because of the large quantity of pottery
which has been found there. In this portion of the plain
are found the tombs of the kings of the First dynasty, and
among them is one, that of King Khent, which the
Egyptians identified as the tomb of Osiris. There is not the least doubt about the fact of the identification, for numerous proofs have been obtained from the excavations
that the place was called Peqer, and that under the New
Empire the Egyptians were firmly convinced that the
tomb of Khent was the tomb of Osiris. Moreover, the
famous cenotaph of Osiris, which was made probably
1 Op. at., p. 27.

Shrines, Miracle Play, and &quot;
Mysteries
&quot;
under the XXIInd dynasty and which is described
elsewhere, was found here by M. Amdineau. It has
been argued by some1 that the identification of the tomb
of Khent as the tomb of Osiris is not older than the XVIIIth dynasty, because the oldest objects found round about it are of the time of Amen-hetep III, about 1 500 B.C.
But the stele of I-kher-nefert of the Xllth dynasty
says that the tomb of Osiris was in Peqer, and as the
cult of Osiris developed greatly from the Xllth dynasty
onwards, it seems to me wholly impossible for the
Egyptians to have forgotten between the Xllth and the
XVIIIth dynasties the whereabouts of the tomb of the god on whom their hopes of resurrec
tion and immortal ity centred. When
the Egyptians of the
XVIIIth dynasty
asserted that the tomb which we now know to be that of King Khent was
the tomb of Osiris, they were undoubt
edly asserting their belief in a tradition which was even at that time many centuries old. Similarly
the Egyptians of the XXIInd dynasty asserted their
acceptance of the traditional belief of the XVIIIth
dynasty by making the famous cenotaph of Osiris, and
placing it at Peqer, or Umm al-Ka ab. Whether the
identification of the tomb of Khent as that of Osiris is correct is a wholly different matter, which it is useless to
argue, for the evidence which is necessary for deciding
the question is not available, even if it exists. It is
unlikely that there were two tombs in Peqer, each
claiming to be the tomb of Osiris, but even if there were it
is only reasonable to assume that the priestly authorities
of the day would weigh the evidence in such an important

Marietta, Abydos, Vol. I, p. 43.



io Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
matter carefully, and would decide in accordance with
ancient tradition. If we assume that the identification of the tomb of Khent as the tomb of Osiris is not older than the reign of Amen-hetep III we ignore the vital
importance of the grave of the god to every Egyptian,
and the great antiquity of the cult of Osiris at Abydos.
It is unlikely that Abydos was the original home of the
worship of Osiris, indeed there is good reason for
thinking that it was not ; but abundant evidence exists to
show that the town was one of the principal centres of
his cult from the beginning to the end of the Dynastic Period.
The official I-kher-nefert, having directed the
ceremonies connected with the burial of Osiris, then
proceeded to carry out those which were performed in
connection with the avenging of the death of Osiris,
and says :
&quot;
I avenged Un-Nefer on the day of the Great Battle,
I overthrew all his enemies on the dyke(?) of Netit.&quot;
The scene in the Osiris play here referred to repre
sented the great battle which was waged by Horus, the
&quot;avenger of his father,&quot; against Set and his confederates,
and is often mentioned in the religious texts. In it
I-kher-nefert played the part of Horus, and led the
victorious army in the sham fight, which probably took
place at dawn, for it is the African custom to attack the
enemy at that time. The foes of the god were supposed
to be routed with great slaughter. The Book of the
Dead (Chapter XVIII) makes it quite clear that in the
original battle between Horus and Set large numbers of
the followers of Set were slain on the field, and large
numbers were taken prisoners. The prisoners were
brought to the tomb of Osiris, where they were beheaded
and, perhaps, hacked to pieces, and their blood was used
in watering the sanctuary of Osiris in his tomb, and the
ground round about it. This is, clearly, what is meant
by the words, &quot; On the night of the carrying out of the
sentence upon these who are to die,&quot; and &quot;the night
of breaking and turning up the earth in their blood,&quot;
and the &quot; Tchatcha (chiefs), on the festival of the
&quot;
breaking and turning up of the earth in Tattu (Busiris),



Shrines, Miracle Play, and &quot;
Mysteries
&quot;
11
&amp;lt;(
slay the fiends of Set in the presence of the gods who
&quot; are therein, and their blood runneth about among them
&quot; as they are smitten.&quot; Whether I-kher-nefert offered up
human sacrifices or not is not known, but it is tolerably
certain that so careful a traditionalist as he shows himself to have been would not have omitted to see that the
grave of Osiris was properly
&quot; watered &quot; with human blood. The victims would be prisoners of war and
criminals, who by the laws of Egyptian society were
bound to die. They would be sacrificed so that their
blood might gratify the great ancestral spirit Osiris, just
as the criminals and prisoners of war are sacrificed in
Dahomey at the Annual Customs to gratify and renew
the life of the spirits of the king s ancestors. The text of I-kher-nefert continues :
&quot;
I caused him (i.e., Osiris) to set out in the Boat,
&quot; which bore his Beauty. I made the hearts of the
&quot; dwellers in the East to expand with joy, and I caused
&quot;
gladness to be in the dwellers in Amentet (the West),
&quot; when they saw the Beauty as it landed at Abydos,
&quot;
bringing Osiris Khenti- Amend, the Lord of Abydos,
&quot; to his palace.&quot;
This was the most glorious scene in the Osiris play,
for the god appears once more in the Neshmet Boat,
and he returns to his palace once more a living god.
Thanks to his own divine power, and to the ceremonies
which Horus and his Four Sons had performed between
the transport of the body of Osiris to his tomb and
his re-appearance in the Neshmet Boat, and, thanks
to the eating of the Eye, which Horus had plucked
from his own face and given to him, and to the
vengeance which had been wreaked on Set and his
fiends, and to the &quot; watering
&quot; of the tomb of Osiris with their blood, Osiris became once more a living
being. The crowds who had flocked to Abydos
from the East and the West rejoiced greatly, for their
god had come once more to live among them, and
in him they saw the symbol of their own resurrec
tion and immortality. In describing the Osiris play at
Abydos, I-kher-nefert dwells chiefly upon the ceremonies
in which he played the prominent part, for he assumed



12 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
that those who read his inscription were thoroughly conversant with all the details of the Mysteries. It is quite clear from his narrative that the performance of
the Mystery play of Osiris occupied many days, probably
from first to last three or four weeks. The play was
acted at Tattu (Busiris) with elaborate ceremonies, and
a considerable number of human sacrifices must have been offered up at that place. Other towns in which
special regard was paid to the festival of Osiris and its
Mysteries were Anu (Heliopolis), Sekhem (Letopolis),
Pe-Tep (Buto), Taui-rekhti (?), An-rut-f, and Re-stau.
In connection with the offerings to Osiris mention
must be made of the belief, which was common among
the Egyptians, that there existed at Abydos a means by
which they might be despatched direct to the Other
World for the use of the god. This means took the
form of a well, or cistern, which was fed in some way
by the Abydos canal, and was called &quot; Ha hetepet,&quot;
m \\ &amp;lt;Ed3&amp;gt;. Its waters2 were mighty and most
IU _S^o D II I & J
terrible, and the well was full of &quot;
great roarings
&quot; ;
the god who guarded it was Qa-ha-hetep, 3 and he
allowed none to approach it. The ground about it
was called the &quot;
region of offerings, the holy land, the
mountain of Amentet.&quot;4 The roarings or noises which
were heard in the well were caused by the fall of the
offerings into it. The well is mentioned in the Stele
of Menthu-hetep5 (Xlth dynasty), who says that he
built it6 by the order of Horus, i.e., the king, but it
is far more likely that he only cleared it out, and lined it

with stone. Close to this well was the chamber which contained the relic of Osiris, and this is, as M. Lefebure
pGrmtrd~rraV probably the tomb chamber of King Khent,
which the Egyptians identified as the tomb of Osiris.
It is about 28 feet square, and was surrounded by cells,
which increased its size to 43 feet by 38 feet. At the
north-west corner of this chamber M. Amdineau found a staircase of fourteen steps, and the cenotaph of Osiris,
to which reference has already been made. The well,
or cistern, was either built or repaired under the
Xlth dynasty, and it was certainly in existence in the
time of Strabo, who seems to connect it with the &quot;
palace
of Memnon.&quot; He says that there was a descent to the
water, which was situated at a great depth, through an arched passage built of single stones, of remarkable
size and workmanship. A canal led to the place from
the Nile, and near it was a grove of Egyptian acanthus
trees dedicated to Apollo. 1
The building which Strabo calls the &quot;
palace of
Memnon &quot; cannot have been the temple of Seti I, as
Mariette thought, but must have been the temple of
Osiris ; every large temple had its well, and the
general plan of the temple well, or cisterns, is known.
Mariette devoted much time and attention during his excavations at Abydos in searching for the well described
by Strabo, but he failed to find it, and his successors have been equally unsuccessful in this respect. Professor Naville in the course of his excavations at Abydos
(1909-11) discovered a large well, but it can hardly
have been the well described by Strabo. M. Lefebure
thought2 that it might have been situated in the
tomb of Osiris, and that its mouth was under the cenotaph of the god, but none of the excavators
of the tomb mentions any trace of it. Still, it
must be somewhere in the plain of Peqer, or
Umm al-Ka ab, though it is probably filled with sand.

the tomb region, and the &quot; staircase&quot; of the god 1 must
all be near together, and it is to be hoped that in the
near future the well may be brought to light.
Notwithstanding all the great works which the
kings of the Xllth dynasty caused to be done for Osiris
at Abydos, we find that under the XHIth dynasty his
sanctuary needed many repairs. King Nefer-hetep was
a loyal worshipper of Osiris, and hearing that his temple
was in ruins, and that a new statue of the god was
required, he went to the temple of Temu at Heliopolis,
and consulted the books in the library there, so that
he might learn how to make a statue of Osiris which
should be like that which had existed in the beginning of the world. Having obtained the information required,
he set out for Abydos, and sent word to the priests there
that the statue of Osiris should be brought out to meet
him at the place where he was going to land on the
river bank. When he arrived he found Osiris and his
priests waiting for him, and the king journeyed from
the Nile to the temple of Osiris at Abydos, under
the escort of the god and his priests. As the king
was going to the temple a number of the principal
scenes in the Mystery play of Osiris were performed,
no doubt to the great satisfaction of the actors and
spectators. When Abydos was reached the king caused
all the necessary works to be taken in hand at once, and
he superintended personally their execution, in order
that he might be certain that the directions which he
had obtained from the books in the Library at Heliopolis
were correctly carried out. In the making of the new
statue of Osiris the king assisted with his own hands. 2
Whether the sanctuary of Osiris at Abydos pros
pered or not under the XlVth, XVth, XVIth, and
XVIIth dynasties, is not known, but with the rise to
power of the kings of the XVIIIth dynasty it certainly
began a new period of glory. Thothmes I made a new
statue of the god, or repaired the old one, and a shrine

boat of silver, gold, lapis-lazuli, copper, and precious stones, tables for offerings, sistra of various kinds,
censers and bowls, a new barge in which the god might
journey from the temple to Peqer during the Miracle
play, and statues of all the gods of Abydos, each with
his silver-gold standard. 1 Thothmes III caused a great
many restorations to be carried out in the temple of
Osiris, 2 and the results of the excavations made during
recent years at Abydos prove that, in the reigns of Amen-hetep III and the other kings of the XVIIIth
dynasty, the income de
rived by Osiris from his
worshippers must have been considerable. Hitherto reference has been made only to the two chief shrines of Osiris, viz., Abydos in the South,
and Busiris in the North, but since the legend of the
scattering of the parts of
the body of Osiris all over
Egypt was generally ac
cepted, even in early times, it follows that many shrines of the god existed in the
country at an early period, although of such shrines
there is no list older than the XVIIIth dynasty. Of this period, however, we have
several copies of a List of the Forms and Shrines of
Osiris, and from this it seems that there must have been
a shrine of Osiris in every nome in Egypt. The List
forms part of the CXLIInd Chapter of the Book of the
Dead, 3 and the oldest form of it is probably that given
in the Papyrus of Nu. It follows a list4 of all the gods
whose names are to be commemorated by a man for his

In the Saite Period the Forms and Shrines of Osiris were 1 1 2 in number ; they will be found tabulated in the Todtenbuch of Lepsius, Bl. 59.
Under the XlXth dynasty the temple of Osiris was
restored, or rebuilt, and a large number of repairs were carried out at Abydos in connection with the property
of the god. Seti I regarded Osiris with great awe,
and spoke of him as the god who would destroy those
who declined to obey his commands. 3 The reverence
which Seti I personally showed to Osiris is well
illustrated by the sections of the Book of Gates which
specially deal with the kingdom of Osiris, appearing on
his alabaster coffin. On this we have the remarkable vignette of Osiris seated in judgment on the top of his
staircase, with the Scales set before him, and the boat
containing the black pig of Set, which an ape is beating.
The further scenes which illustrate the kingdom of Osiris
prove that Seti was a believer in the doctrine of rewards
for the blessed and punishments for the wicked, and in
the existence of a place where the beatified lived with
Osiris. The famous well of Osiris at Abydos appears
in funerary literature copied during his reign, for we see
Osiris seated by the side of it, or over it, in the Papyrus

ig
of Hu-nefer, and pictures of it appear in some of the
Books of the Other World. Rameses II was a loyal servant of Osiris, and
repaired his shrines and erected fine buildings in his
honour. Rameses says in the great inscription at
Abydos1 that he did for Osiris what Horus did for his
father, that he set up monuments to him, and doubled
the offerings to his KA, and his piety caused him to
restore some of the royal tombs at Abydos which were
in ruins. He finished the temple begun by his father,
and built close to it a temple to Osiris. Rameses III
restored Abydos and endowed the temples with great
possessions, and made a great barge for the god. 2 Under
the rule of the later kings of the XXth dynasty the cult
of Osiris does not seem to have been specially considered,
and the priest-kings of the XX 1st dynasty devoted most
of their attention and their possessions to the glorifica
tion of Amen-Ra, the &quot;
king of the gods,&quot; at Thebes.
Exact data are wanting, but it seems clear that with the
end of the XX 1st dynasty the importance of Abydos
began to decline, and with it the cult of Osiris in this
place. The first great revival of the glory of Osiris at
Abydos after about 900 B.C., happened in the reign of
Amasis (XXVIth dynasty), and it was entirely due to
his chief physician Pef-a-nef-Net, or Pef-ta-nef-Net. He
interested the king in Abydos, and ultimately obtained
from him the funds necessary for the restoration of the
temple and the divine service. Much of the work of
restoration he superintended personally. He built the
god s temple, provided a silver-gold shrine, and imple
ments for service made of gold, silver, etc. He built
U-Pek and set up its altars, and cleaned out the famous
well or cistern, and planted trees about it. He estab
lished a regular supply of food for the temple, he settled
there slaves, male and female, he endowed the temple
with 1000 stat of land with its flocks and herds and
peasant dwellers. He re-established the offerings,
planted date groves and vineyards, restored the library,
and built a sacred barge. He revived the Miracle play
of Osiris, and took the leading part in the great scene

in which the representative of Horus beats back the foes
of his father Osiris. He made provision for burying
the people of Abydos by confiscating certain dues, which
the lord of the district had been in the habit of exacting
from the desert tribes, and the earnings of a certain
ferry1 which the owner had assumed to be his private
possession. Whatever may have happened to the shrine
of Osiris at Abydos we may be quite certain that it did
not in any way affect the general progress of the cult of
Osiris in Egypt. It is probable that there was a small
temple of Osiris attached to every great temple in Egypt,
and there is good reason to think that such temples of
Osiris were better and more regularly served by the
priests than the larger temples. Little by little the
Egyptians seem to have dropped the active cult of the
other gods, Osiris and I sis, or Hathor, being in the eyes
of the purely indigenous section of the population of
more importance than all the other gods put together,
for they gave resurrection and immortality to those who
were dead, and protected the lives, property, and fortunes
of those who were living.

CHAPTER XV.
THE MYSTERIES OF OSIRIS AT DENDERAH.
THE walls of one of the two courts which form part of the temple of Osiris at Denderah contain a long inscrip
tion 1 describing the bas-reliefs which illustrate the

mysteries and ceremonies that were performed annually
in honour of Osiris in that city. The First Section of this text deals with the making of sixteen models of the
sixteen pieces into which the body of Osiris was hacked
by Set. Each model was made of wheat mixed with
some specially prepared paste, and was sent to the town

in which that member of the body of Osiris was believed
to have been found, and it was there put in a specially
prepared vessel in the &quot; house of Osiris,&quot; and placed
under the protection of the gods.
The Second Section of the inscription deals with the
making of the figure of Khenti- Amenti, and is of peculiar
interest. At Mendes, a town closely connected with
Busiris and the cult of Osiris, one kin of wheat and three
kin of paste were placed in a large stone trough resting
on four legs, and each day, from the i2th to the 2ist day
of Khoiak, three parts of a kin of water were poured
Osiris of Ant (Denderah) on his bier, with Nephthys standing at the head, and Isis at the foot. Mariette, Denderah, IV, 68.
from a gold goblet into the trough. On the 2ist day the
contents of the trough were taken out, and a measure of
incense having been added to it, the whole was kneaded
into the two halves of a gold mould for making the figure of
Khenti- Amenti wearing the White Crown. The contents
of the moulds were then taken out and tied together with
four papyrus bands, and dried in the sun. At the
eighth hour of the 22nd day of the month, the figure,
and figures of gods and many lamps, were placed
in boats, and taken by water to the tomb of the god, and there the figure of Khenti-Amenti was covered with
a cloth, and afterwards buried. At Abydos, one kin of wheat and four hin of paste
were placed in the two halves of a mould of Khenti

Amend on the I2th day of Khoiak, and the moulds
were set in a large stone trough, with reeds laid above
and below them ; each mould was covered with a cloth. Water was poured on each half of the figure of the god,
morning and evening, and other ceremonies were per
formed in connection with them until the 2istof Khoiak. On that day the halves of the figure were removed
from the moulds, dry incense was sprinkled over them,
and they were then tied together with four bands of
Osiris of Coptos. Isis stands at the head, and Horus, son of Isis, son of Osiris at
the foot. A crown and the tunic of the god are under the bier. Mariette, Denderah, IV, 68.
papyrus, and set in the sun to dry until the 25th day
of the month. On that day the figure was taken to the
temple of Seker and laid there, and the ceremonies of
embalmment continued from the 25th to the last day
of the month, when the figure was buried. The
ceremonial of Abydos was repeated at all the other sanctuaries of Osiris in Egypt.
The Third Section gives directions for making a
figure of Seker in a mould, with his crook, whip, beard,
and uraeus. The mould was of gold, and a cast made
from it was one cubit in height. The paste of which
the figure was made was composed of earth from the
town of Neter, dates, incense, fresh myrrh, spices,



24 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
precious stones, and water. The paste was made in the
form of an egg, and set in a silver vase with sycamore
leaves round it, and then pressed into the mould, and
anointed with oil, and finally laid on the bed in the
interior of the chamber. At Mendes this paste was
made on the I4th day of Khoiak, and put in the mould
on the 1 6th ; on the igih the figure was removed from
the mould, embalmed on the 24th, and buried on the
last day of the month. Memphis, Sma-Behutet, Kes,
and Ka-kam observed the same rites.

The Fourth Section gives the names of the gods
who were enshrined in the temple of the goddess Shent. The Fifth Section supplies the legends which were cut on the fronts of the moulds of Seker, Khenti- Amend,
and on the two vessels of Sep. The coffin of Osiris
was made of sycamore wood and bore a long inscription ;
it was one cubit and two palms long, and three palms and
three fingers broad. The coffin of Khenti- Amenti and
the coffer of the vessels of Sep were also made of
sycamore. The moulds for the &quot;divine bread&quot; were
made of the wood of a red tree, and cakes were made from them in the forms of the sixteen members of Osiris,
viz., his head, feet, bones, arms, heart, intestines, tongue.



Mysteries of Osiris at Denderah 25
eye, fist, fingers, body, back, ears, backbone, ram s head,
and hair. These cakes were put in a box, which was
placed in a silver chest, and then set under the head of
the god for protection. The other paragraphs of this
Section deal minutely with the spices, precious stones,
bandlets, knot, the fourteen amulets of Un-Nefer, 1 and the fourteen tebeh of the mould of Seker, which were in the forms of the fourteen divine members. The Field of Osiris in which the sacred grain was to be sown was

from 210 to 223 feet long ; one end of it was sown with
barley, its centre with dhura, and the other end with flax.
The plough frame was made of two kinds of wood, and
the ploughshare of black bronze ; the cows which pulled
it were black. The barley which grew in the Field was
cut on the 2Oth day of Tobe, and was made into sacred
cakes, the dhura was also made into cakes, and the linen made from the flax was used at the festival. Descriptions
then follow of the sacred casket made of reeds, the cow

the twenty-nine other boats are also given. The objects
next spoken of are the sacred bier with silver wheels ;

long and 12 cubits broad, with seven doors, and con
taining a raised mound on which the god in his sarco
phagus rests ; and the gilded wooden coffer, with its
jackal on its cover, and its sledge beneath it. The
festival Un-per was celebrated on the i6th and 24th of
the month of Khoiak, and on these days the god with his
jackal appeared in the courtyard. The yoking of the two
pairs of heifers to draw the funerary furniture took place
on the 23rd day. The furniture consisted of two
obelisks, four coffers, one for each of the Four Sons of Horus, with their four veils, one blue, one red, one green, one white, sixteen vulture plumes, four affixed to
each coffer, and behind came a figure of the serpent Apep, holding a knife with which to sever the cordage.
On the 1 2th day of Khoiak the festival of Tena was

celebrated, and on the I4th the most solemn festival of
Pert was observed. On the i6th the festival of Osiris Khenti-Amenti was celebrated, and on that day the
transformation of the god took place. On the i Qth the
figure of Seker was taken from its mould, and on that
day Horus saw his father. On the 2ist the figure of
Osiris was taken from its mould ; on the 24th Osiris was
embalmed, and on the last day of the month the Tet,
^, was raised up, and Osiris was buried. For seven
days, from the 24th to the last day of the month, Osiris
remained unburied, and during these days he rested in
Osiris Khenti-Amenti of Nubia. Horus sits at the head and Neith at the foot.

the branches of the sycamores of Mendes. The seven
days symbolize the seven months which he passed in the
womb of his mother Nut, and the branches symbolize the
goddess.
The Sixth Section states that the object used at the
Tena festival was made at each of the sixteen shrines of Osiris in Egypt. On the I2th of Khoiak the Festival
of Ploughing the Earth was celebrated in the temple of
the goddess Shentit in Mendes. The goddess appeared
in the temple, and she was stripped naked. Some grain
was strewn on a bed in the chamber of the goddess s
dwelling, and then some of it was placed on a cloth and
moistened with water, and at the sixth hour of the day this wet grain was placed in four gold vases in four equal

parts. Two parts were intended for the mould of Khent
Amenti, and two parts for the trough of Sep. A number
of cakes (?) were then brought and treated in the same
way. Next a piece of linen was laid in each half of the
mould of Khent-Amenti, and it was filled with the wet wheat and the cake-paste ; both parts were then laid in
the large trough and covered with reeds. The trough of
Sep was then filled with the rest of the wheat and cake

paste, and laid in the larger trough, and water was poured
on them. On the 2ist day of Khoiak the reeds which
were about the halves of the mould were removed, and
on the following day the superfluous water was drained
off. The figures were then removed from the moulds,
and tied together with four papyrus bands, and the two
figures from the trough of Sep were joined in a similar
manner, and then they were escorted along the water to the
tomb by 34 boats decorated with 365 lamps. The figure of Khent-Amenti and the figure from the trough of Sep,
which had been made the previous year, were then
brought from the place where they had been kept, and

oiled, and embalmed on the 24th day of the month of
Khoiak, and put each in a sycamore-wood coffin, and
buried in Re-stau on the last day of the month.
The remaining paragraphs describe the details of the
final ceremonies which were performed for &quot; Osiris, Lord
&quot; of Tattu, Un-nefer, triumphant, Khent-Amenti, Great
&quot; God, Lord of Abydos.&quot; The twelve magic spices and
the twenty-four precious stones are enumerated ; the
weaving and the dyeing of the sacred linen are described,

and the painting and decoration of the figure of the god,
and the fixing of the fourteen amulets on it, and when
this and much else had been carefully performed, the
priests went, on the 25th day of Khoiak, and &quot;
expelled
&quot; from the tomb of the god all the words which had been
&quot; spoken there during the ceremonies the year before.&quot;
The reader will have noted that none of the cere monies described in the text at Denderah are mentioned by the loyal official I-kher-Nefert in his account of the ceremonies at which he assisted. This is not to be wondered at, for he only took the lead in the great scenes
of the Mystery play of Osiris which were always

performed before the people. The ceremonies described
above were all performed in secret by the priests, partly
in the most sacred parts of the temple, and partly in the
tomb, and the object of them all was to make three
figures of the different forms of Osiris. From the first
mould was made a figure of Khent-Amenti, and from the
trough of Sep, a figure of Sep, which was formed of
sixteen distinct limbs of Osiris, and from the mould of
Seker, a figure of the finished, reconstituted god. Every
act was symbolic in character, and represented some
ancient belief or tradition. The paste, the mixture of

wheat and water, the egg, the naked goddess Shentit, i.e.,
Isis in her chamber, the placing of the paste on her bed,
the kneading of the paste into the moulds, etc., represented
the great processes of Nature which are set in motion
when human beings are begotten and conceived, as well
as the inscrutable powers which preside over growth and
development. The Egyptians believed that the original
Osiris was re-made in the earth, and that the pieces of his
body were woven together a second time through the
words and ceremonies of the gods whose effigies were
carried in the thirty-four boats during the procession on
the water. And there was not the smallest action on the part of any member of the band who acted the



Mysteries of Osiris at Denderah 31
Miracle play of Osiris, and not a sentence in the Liturgy,
which did not possess importance or vital significance to
the followers of Osiris. The ceremonies performed at
Denderah were not new, on the contrary, they were very old, and there is good reason to think the priests of the
Ptolemaic Period accepted with absolute faith the observances which the Osirian traditions imposed upon
them, and carried them out with the most scrupulous care, even in the smallest detail.

We may now consider the bas-reliefs at Denderah
which illustrate the Festival and Mysteries of Osiris. ]
In the First Chamber North we see the figures of the
priests of the shrines of Osiris from Lower Egypt
marching with the king at their head ; each holds in his
hands the symbol of his nome, and above his head is his
official title or designation (Plates 31, 32). In the
First Chamber South we also see the figures of the priests of the shrines of Osiris in the South, or Upper
Egypt (Plates 33, 34). In the same chamber is the long
inscription which has already been summarized. It is
illustrated by a figure of Osiris Khent- Amend (Plate 35),
1 See Mariette, Denderah, torn. IV, Plate XXXI ff. D2



32 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
and a representation of the mould of Khent-Amenti
(Plate 38), and the mould of Seker (Plate 39). On the
walls of the Second Chamber (Plates 40-43) is sculptured
a series of birds, each with its characteristic head, which represent the deities of the various nomes wherein shrines
of Osiris were situated. These are followed by figures
of the Eight Goddesses, Isis, Nephthys, etc. (Plate 44),
and of the deities who accompany Osiris during the
twenty-four hours of the day and night to protect him against the attacks of Set, or Typhon (Plates 45-56).
Seker- Osiris, Lord of Tattu (Busiris). Mariette, Denderah, IV, 71.
Then come a representation of the passage of the sun
through the twelve hours of the day (Plate 57), and two
scenes which illustrate ceremonies performed in con
nection with the renewal of the life of Osiris under the
fostering influences of the goddesses Isis and Nephthys.
The resurrection of Osiris is closely connected with the
germination of wheat ; the grain which is put into the
ground is the dead Osiris, and the grain which has
germinated is the Osiris who has once again renewed his
life (Plate 58). The remaining reliefs in this chamber
represent the gods who are charged with the protection
of the tomb of Osiris (Plates 59-63).
In the Third Chamber we have representations of
the Seven Boats of Osiris, the Hennu, Sektet, Maat,



Mysteries of Osiris at Denderah 33
etc., which took part in the procession of Osiris
(Plates 64, 65), of Osiris as Harmakhis in a boat, and
of a form of Osiris as the Lord of Life. The god
lies on a bier under which are placed his diadems
(Plate 65). The next relief (Third Chamber North),
represents the adoration or protection of Osiris of the
South and Osiris of the North by Isis and Nephthys (the
two Shenti-goddesses), and the two Merti, i.e., the god
desses of the Inundation of the South and North. In a

lower scene we have a figure of Osiris of the North lying
on his bier in his tomb which is placed close to a tamarisk
tree (Plate 66). Then come the Seven Boats of Osiris
(Plates 67, 68), and these are followed by repre sentations of the funeral chests of Osiris in different localities. Thus we have the biers of Osiris of Denderah, Osiris of Coptos, Osiris Khent-Amenti of
Abydos (Plate 68), Osiris of Eileithyias, Osiris of Edfu, Osiris of Ta-sti (Nubia), Osiris of Cusae (Plate 69),
Osiris of the town of Apis, Osiris revivified, Osiris of Libya (?), Osiris of Abydos, Osiris under a form

Southern Group. First Chamber. Here the first text contains invocations to Osiris, in all his forms of Upper and Lower Egypt, and the bas-relief represents
Osiris Un-Nefer of Denderah lying on his bier, with
Isis at the head and Nephthys at the foot (Plate 74).
The second text is that of the &quot; Book of the Magical
Protection of Horus,&quot; which was composed for him by
Thoth ; its recital brought about the destruction of all

the enemies of Osiris, and gave to the soul of the god
the strength of a bull in the Other World. The bas
reliefs show us Osiris, followed by the four Meskhenit
goddesses, and a figure of Thoth (Plate 74). The third
text contains invocations to Osiris, and the bas-relief
represents Osiris Un-Nefer, Lord of Busiris, lying on
his bier (Plate 75).
Second Chamber. The fourth text contains directions for the covering of the biers of Osiris, and the placing of
the proper amulets on them on the 25th day of Khoiak
(Plate 77). The next group of bas-reliefs contains a
series of figures of the gods of the Dekans, and Planets,
and days of the week, which stand ready to guard the
Sepulchre of Osiris (Plates 78-83). Following these
we have the Twelve Hour-gods of the day, and their

sacrifice (Plate 85), and a list of the nomes of Egypt,
which the king presents to Hathor.

repulsed the fiends, and turned aside calamities (or,
times [of evil] ). She uttered the spell with the magical
power of her mouth. Her tongue was perfect (or, well
trained), and it never halted at a word. Beneficent in
command and word was I sis, the woman of magical
spells, the advocate of her brother. She sought him
untiringly, she wandered round and round about this
earth in sorrow, and she alighted not without finding
him. She made light (or, air) with her feathers, she
created air with her wings, and she uttered the death
wail for her brother. She raised up the inactive members
of him whose heart was still, she drew from him his essence, she made an heir, she reared the child in lone liness, and the place where he was was not known, and he
grew in strength and stature, and his hand was mighty
in the House of Keb. The Company of the God
rejoiced, rejoiced, at the coming of Horus, the son of
Osiris, whose heart was firm, the triumphant, the son of
I sis, the heir of Osiris. The sovereign chiefs of Maat,
and the Company of the Gods, and Neb-er-tcher himself,
and the Lords of Maat, gathered together to him, and
they assembled in the [Great House of Anu]. And
verily, those who repulse sin rejoice in the House of
Keb to bestow its dignity upon the Lord thereof and the
sovereignty of Truth.



CHAPTER XVII.
OSIRIS AND THE AFRICAN GRAVE.
As the priests of Osiris and the regulations made by
them for his cult forbade the decapitation and mutilation, or dismemberment, of the bodies of worshippers of this
god, it was obviously necessary to provide tombs for
such bodies, and to place them in graves, where they
would be protected from the attacks of human, animal,
and other eaters of the dead. The making of a good
tomb, however simple, demanded the expenditure of
money, or its equivalent, and thus it follows, as a matter
of course, that only kings, chiefs, nobles, or men of high
position, who could command the services of slaves,
would be buried in a tomb, and that all the poor, or
common people, would go without burial. As a result
of the excavations which have been made in Egypt
during the last thirty years, thousands of graves have
been brought to light, but these, after all, must repre
sent a very small proportion of the graves which would
be necessary for the burial of even the upper classes of
the Egyptians during the long period of the history of
the country, which covers some thousands of years. The
Egyptians had to solve the same difficulty as their
kinsmen in other parts of Africa, namely, what to do
with the dead, and it is probable that they solved it, in
the earliest times at least, in the same way that the
peoples in the Sudan solve it at the present day. Rightly
has Schweinfurth said :
&quot; Not a custom, not a superstition
&quot; is found in one part which is not more or less accu
&quot;
rately repeated in another ; not one contrivance of
&quot;
design, not one weapon of war exists of which it can
11 be declared that it is the exclusive property of any one
&quot; race. From north to south, and from sea to sea, in &quot; some form or other, every invention is sure to be
&quot;
repeated ; it is the thing that hath been.&quot; 1

8o Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
Before the time of Osiris some of the Egyptians pro
bably ate their dead, and used some of them up in making
&quot; medicines &quot; of a magic character. Even after the cult
of Osiris was established we read that the ertu of his body, i.e., the fluids which came forth from it after death,
gave life, 1 and it is well known that in Africa at the
present day the brains and fat of the dead are used in
making charms. Thus the Borfimor &quot; medicine&quot; was a
harmless substance enough until human fat was added to
it, when it became an all-powerful fetish. This fat was
procured from the intestines of men who were killed by
the Human Leopard Society. 2 The infamous Temban
dumba3 pounded her child which she was feeding at her
breast in a mortar, with roots, leaves, oils, etc., and made an ointment, with which she is said to have rendered her self invulnerable. Her subjects killed their male children
also, and turned them into ointment, some of which was
preserved till Winwood Reade s time, and was called
&quot; Magija Samba.&quot;4 The Mpongwe sever the head from
the body of a partially decomposed man, and suspend it
above a mass of chalk which is placed to receive the
moisture that drops from it. By rubbing the chalk on
the foreheads of the living it is thought that they will
acquire the brain power of the man whose brains have
dropped on the chalk. 5 The eater of the brain becomes
endowed with bravery. 6 Miss Kingsley found in a fetish
bag a human hand (fresh), three big toes, four eyes, and
two ears. 7 The dead among the Egyptians who were not eaten by
men were disposed of by the crocodiles in the rivers, by
the hyaenas and jackals in the desert, and probably some
of them by burning ; at all events, judging by the graves
which remain, the number that were buried were com- ; paratively few. It seems from allusions in the Egyptian

texts as if the custom of burning the dead was commoner
in early times than has bee_n generally supposed. In
the Book of Overthrowing Apep, this archfiend and his
associates are burnt by the flames of the Sun-god and
consumed. 1 In the Book Am-Tuat, the bodies, souls,
shadows and heads of the enemies of Ra are burnt and consumed daily in pits of fire. 2 In the Book of the Dead
several allusions to burning occur. Thus the Rubrics of
Chapters XVIII and XX say that the recital of these
Chapters will enable a man to &quot; come forth (i.e., escape)
from the fire.&quot; In Chapter XVII we read of the monster
who feeds on the dead, and watches at the Bight of the
Lake of Fire, and in Chapter LXXI are mentioned the
Seven Beings who work slaughter in the Lake of Fire, who
cut off hands and hack necks to pieces, and seize hearts
and tear them out of the breasts. In Chapter LXI 1 1 A the
deceased prays in one version that &quot; he may neither be
burnt up nor destroyed by fire,&quot; and in the other he
states that Osiris escaped from the fire and was not burnt.
In Chapter CXXVI the deceased addresses the four
apes who sit one at each corner of a rectangular lake of
fire, &quot;by the fire from whose mouths the gods are pro
pitiated,&quot; and beseeches them to allow him to enter
Amentet. The Lake of Fire was no doubt a lake of boiling water, the drinking from which the deceased
wished to avoid at all costs. A legend referred to in
Chapter CXXV mentions that the abode of Osiris has a
covering of fire, that its walls are living serpents, and
that it rests on water ; whether the water is boiling or
not the text does not say. These passages make it quite
clear that the cult of Osiris forbade the burning of the
body, and that at one time certain Egyptian peoples must
have burnt their dead. The custom had not entirely died out in the Sudan in the first or second century of our era,
for in 1902 I found at the Pyramids of Meroe several
pots containing ashes of the dead and calcined bones. 3
According to Frobenius, the Madgo tribes who live near
the Mafibattu burn the bodies of the dead, and scatter their ashes.4 As regards the other ways of disposing of the

82 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
dead followed by modern peoples in Africa, almost every
where the common, or very poor, or very old, folk are
thrown &quot; into the bush &quot; for the kites and hyaenas to
devour. The Masai wholly decline to bury the dead, for
they believe they would poison the soil ;
x this may be due
to the fact that they believe in annihilation.
The oldest form of the African tomb is a pit dug in
the ground, on the bottom of which the dead person was
placed. Attempts were made
at a very early period to
protect the body from contact
with the earth, for it was sometimes wrapped up in a
reed mat, and sometimes in the skin of some animal. Another method of protect
ing the body was to place it
in a hollow made in one side of the pit at the bottom,
and this hollow subsequently developed into the sarco
phagus chamber of the Egyptian tomb. In the
Sudan no stone buildings or
tombs of any kind could be
built because of the want of lime, 2 and therefore from the
earliest period to the present
time the essential character istics of the African tomb have remained unchanged in
that region. In Egypt several general modifications and
developments took place in tombs at a very early period,
but from first to last the essentials for all tombs were :
i. A funerary chamber, usually at the top of the pit,
where offerings were placed. 2. A pit. 3. A chamber
for the body or mummy, usually called the sarcophagus
chamber, or mummy chamber.
Sometime between the XI I th and XVIIIth dynastie
when a great development in the cult of Osiris too

Osiris and the African Grave 83
place throughout Egypt, the view became general
that Osiris was buried at Abydos. How or why this
happened is not known, but it may have been due to the
revival of an ancient tradition to this effect. Be this
as it may, quite early in the XVIIIth dynasty, the Egyptians felt sure that the body of Osiris rested at
Abydos, and they identified a tomb of one of the kings
of the 1st dynasty as the tomb of Osiris. This tomb was
made for a king whose Horus name is written with
a sign which I believe to have been read &quot;
Khent,&quot; 1 and
it is possible that those who made the identification
connected in their minds this name with &quot; Khenti
Amenti,&quot; an old god of the dead of Abydos, whose
position and attributes were absorbed by Osiris. From
the XVIIIth dynasty onwards this tomb enjoyed great
repute as the shrine of Osiris, and offerings poured into
it in abundance. Between the XX 1st and XXVIth
dynasties a massive granite bier, on which was cut in high
relief a figure of Osiris, was placed in the tomb, which
for a considerable time afterwards continued to be regarded as the veritable tomb of Osiris. Whether this
view was correct or not does not concern us here, for it
is as a tomb merely that we are considering it. This
tomb was discovered and excavated by M. E. Amelineau
in the winter of 1897-8, and he has published a long
detailed account of his labours in connection with it. 2 It was a rectangular building, the east and south walls of
which were about 8 feet thick, and the west and north walls a little thicker. The walls were of brick. It resembled a house built on the north, south, and east sides of a court, and in the north-west corner was a flight of steps which enabled visitors to descend into the
tomb, and to reach the tops of the fourteen chambers
which were built on its three sides. The north and south walls were about 42 feet 6 inches long, and the

probably identifying it with L

84 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
east and west walls about 38 feet 6 inches long ; their
original height is unknown, but when M. Amelineau
discovered their remains they were all about 8 feet high.
In this rectangle, supported on layers of sand, bricks,
and wood, the tomb chamber was built ; it was made of
^ wood, and was probably about 28 feet square. In
the small chambers were found large jars, most of
them broken, but on some of them there remained the earthenware caps which served to close their
mouths, and which were stamped with the Horus
name of King Khent.
On January 2, 1898, M. Amelineau found a head,
which he believed to be that of Osiris, and on the same day
his workmen excavated the granite bier of Osiris already
mentioned. This bier, which is now in the Egyptian
Museum in Cairo, is of grey granite, and is about 5 feet
4 inches in length, and about 3 feet in width. The bier
resembles in form the angareb bedstead which is found
&amp;lt;3
all over Egypt and the Sudan, and had lion legs with
a lion s head on the top of each, and they rest on a
pedestal. On the bier lies a figure of Osiris, wearing
the White Crown, and holding /jf\ and
|
in his hands.
Above his head are figures of two hawks, and at his feet
are two more. On the centre of his body is another
hawk, which represents the goddess I sis, and is intended
to commemorate the union of I sis and Osiris which, according to the legend, 1 took place after the death of
Osiris. The fruit of this union was Horus, whom I sis brought forth in the Delta, where she reared him and
taught him that it was his duty to avenge his father s
murder. This interesting monument belongs obviously
to a comparatively late period, but it is possible that it
was a copy of an earlier bier which may have existed in
this tomb.
The tomb of Khent certainly belongs to the period of
the 1st dynasty, and it has importance in connection with
1 It is as old as the Vlth dynasty. In an address to Osiris it is




Osiris and the African Grave 85
the history of Osiris, for it satisfied the requirements of
the tradition which identified it with the tomb of Osiris. Also we see in it the three essentials of the African tomb, the place for offerings, the pit, and the chamber for the dead. In this case the place for the offerings
consisted of several chambers which were in the pit
itself, but the inconvenience of this arrangement was
readily recognized, and very soon after the 1st dynasty
the place for the offerings was formed by a chamber
made at the top of the pit.
The most perfect Egyptian form of the African tomb
is the mastabah, in which the chamber for offerings stands
immediately over the pit and the mummy chamber,
which was made on one side at the bottom of the pit,
from which it was separated by a very short passage.
When the mummy had been placed in its chamber this
passage was blocked carefully, or built up, and thus the
mixture of stones, sand, and mud, with which the pit was filled afterwards, did not force its way into the
mummy chamber. In the great pyramid tombs the pit
takes the form of a diagonal or horizontal corridor ; at
the entrance is the hall for offerings, called the Tuat
chamber, and at the end in the ground is the mummy
chamber. When the tomb is hewn in the mountain the pit may also take the form of a horizontal or diagonal
corridor, or series of corridors, and the mummy chamber
is hewn at a considerable depth in the bowels of the
mountain. In such cases the chamber for offerings is
some distance from the outside of the mountain, and
may be approached by going down a corridor or flight
of steps. In all cases, however, the chamber for
offerings, the pit, and the mummy chamber are the chief
features of the tomb. We may now compare the facts
about ancient Egyptian tombs given above with the
details of tombs which are found scattered through the
writings and reports of African travel made by competent
travellers during the last hundred years.
The Dyoor graves are made close to the huts of the
living. The ground is levelled by means of a piece of
bark about 3 feet long, and a circular mound, some
3 or 4 feet high, indicates the last resting-place of a
Dyoor, so long as the violence of the rain allows it to



86 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
retain its shape. After a few years all traces of them
disappear. 1 The Bongo grave is a pit 4 feet deep, with a
niche hollowed in one side of it, so that the sack contain ing the corpse may not have to sustain any vertical
pressure from the earth which is thrown in to fill up the
grave. After the grave is filled in, a heap of stones is
piled over the spot in a short cylindrical form, and this is supported by strong stakes, which are driven into the
soil all round ; on the middle of the pile is placed a pitcher,
probably that from which the deceased drank. The
graves are close to the huts, and their sites are marked by
a number of long forked branches, carved with numerous
notches and incisions, and having their points sharpened
like horns. The Mittu and Madi and Musgft graves
are somewhat similar. Among the Musgu arrows are
shot into the stakes and are left sticking in the wood. 2
Schweinfurth could not learn from the natives what these
notched stakes signified, but it is probable that originally
each notch represented a year, 3 and that they collectively
represented a great number of years, and signified the
wish of relatives of the deceased that he might live for
ever in the Other World. The A-Zande, or Niam
Niam, also bury the body in a niche in the pit, and when
this is filled in with clay and stamped down a hut is built
over it. 4 The Muslims have copied the old African
custom, and carefully bury their dead in niches in the pit.
The grave of the Moro chief, in Neambara, which
Petherick saw, was a slightly oval hole, which varied
from 2 feet 2 inches to 2 feet 6 inches in diameter, and
was 5 feet deep. On the south side a cavity 4 feet
6 inches long, 4 feet wide and i foot 6 inches high was
excavated, and in this the body was placed ; a piece of
basket work was placed along the side of it to keep the
earth from the body when the pit was filled in. A tree
trunk was dropped into the grave, and set upright, and
round the top of it, which projected 3 feet above the level

of the ground, a conical mound was built ; when this was
covered with dry thorny branches, the grave was
complete. Two large fires were kept burning at the
grave day and night, and eight or ten persons kept guard
over it for a week. 1 Among the Bahima peasant folk are buried in holes
dug at the doors of their huts. 2 Among the Banyoro a
king s grave is dug 1 2 feet deep, and 5 feet in diameter ;
3
the Basoga grave is 1 5 feet deep. 4 Thirty-six kings of
Uganda were buried each on a wooden bier which was
set on the ground in a large house, with a huge conical
thatched roof resembling a pyramid in shape. 5 The
Baziba grave is a deep narrow pit, just large enough for the body to stand or sit in ;
6 the Manyema grave is a
pit 10 feet deep and 10 feet square. 7 The Karamojo bury
rich men in their own houses. 8 The Shula bury the dead
in pits near the houses, and lay on them stones on which
offerings are placed. 9 The Madi grave, according to
Emin Pasha, is circular, and is 5 feet deep, and 3^ feet
in diameter. 10
Of the cemetery of a village of Mbinda, Stanley says :
The grave mounds were neat, and by their appearance
I should judge them to be not only the repositories of the
dead, but also the depositories of all the articles that had
belonged to the dead. Each grave was dressed out with
the various mugs, pitchers, wash-basins, teapots, kettles,
glasses, bottles, etc., and above the mound thus curiously
decorated were suspended by the branch of a tree the
various nets of palm fibre in which the deceased had
carried his ground-nuts, cassava bread, and eatables.
All articles had been rendered useless, i.e., broken. 11 The grave of a Lendu chief is dug in his hut, and one end of
it is prolonged into a tunnel under the floor, in which the

deceased is placed. 1 In Western Africa the graves of
chiefs and kings are &quot;nice roomy apartments generally
about 12 feet by 8 feet by 14 feet, but in Benin, I am
told, the graves have a floor about 16 feet by 12 feet,
with sides tapering to an aperture that can be closed by
a single flag- stone.&quot;2 When a Bari dies he is buried in
the yard. A few ox-horns and skulls are suspended on a
pole above the spot, while the top of the pole is orna
mented with a bunch of cock s feathers. 3 In Dahomey
the body is placed in a niche offsetting from a circular pit.
4
Battell, who wrote at the close of the sixteenth century,
says that the African grave is made like a vault. A little
way down the pit is undermined and made spacious
within. 5 The Juiga graves are merely pits covered with
mounds of stones, on which are placed cooking and
drinking vessels ; they are made by the sides of
frequented paths, and the points where cross roads touch
are favourite burial places. 6 Around the grave of
Sekote, a Batoka chief, seventy large elephants tusks
were planted, with their points turned inwards, and there
were thirty more set over the resting-places of his
relatives. 7
The Bangala rarely buried anyone. When they did
commit a person to the earth the grave was only a foot
deep, and its exterior was covered with provisions
for the dead man s future existence. The Manbattu buried warriors where they fell, and erected huts over
their graves, to which friends and relatives 8 brought
baskets of provisions and jars filled with water. The
Abarambo chief, Mburo, thought it degrading for a chief
like himself to be brought into close contact with the
earth, and, therefore, ordered that his body should be
placed in the upper part of a great tree near his house,
with his face turned towards heaven. This is related

on the authority of Casati. An Ababua killed in war is
cremated to prevent his body being eaten, and his ashes
are carried to his village and buried there. The Bahuana
grave is about four or five feet deep, and a small hut is
erected over it. Grenfell notes that the Bakete mark a grave by means of an uprooted tree stuck into the earth
with the trunk top downwards.



CHAPTER XVIII.
AFRICAN FUNERAL CEREMONIES AND BURIALS.
THE tombs of Egypt and their inscriptions supply an
extraordinary amount of information about the funeral
ceremonies and customs of the Egyptians from the
beginning to the end of the Dynastic Period. And if
we compare the details derived from these sources with
the facts about funerals recorded by travellers in Africa,
we shall find that whenever material means permit, and
when allowance has been made for differences in the
physical products of the country, there is a very close
resemblance between the funeral of a really great
modern chief in Central or Western Africa and that of an ancient king of Egypt. The Egyptians removed
the intestines and brain, and embalmed the body with
great skill, and then swathed it in linen, and laid it in a
coffin or sarcophagus. The modern African removes
the more perishable parts of the body by ways which
will be described further on, and dries or smokes the
corpse very effectively. He also anoints it with
unguents, and wraps it up in much cloth, and then
places it in a coffin or on a bier. The modern African grave contains all the essentials of that of the Egyptian,
but as the modern African is not a skilled mason, and as mountains of stone are not always available, he is
obliged to make almost all his graves in the earth. The
sacrifice of human beings, or animals, the funeral feast,
the pomp and ceremony, the wailings and the noise and
the dancing which accompanied the burial of a king of
Egypt are all paralleled in the great modern African
funeral. The Egyptian king built his funerary chapel
and endowed it, and made arrangements for the regular
supply of sepulchral offerings, and for a perpetual service
of priests to recite the appointed formulae daily, and to
make all the necessary preparations for the commemora
tive festivals. A glance at the history of Dahomey, and
of Congo-land, and of Uganda, is sufficient to show that



African Burials 91
the kings of these countries made exactly similar arrange
ments, and it is becoming clearer, the more the subject
is investigated, that the beliefs which underlie the
funeral ceremonies of Ancient Egypt and the Sudan
are identical. In some cases the customs of the ancient
Egyptian are explained by those of the modern Sudani,
and in their light certain passages in early Egyptian
literature receive a new significance. Of this the follow
ing is an example :
In the Liturgy of Funerary Offerings1 which is found
in the pyramid of Unas, a king of the Vlth dynasty, we
find the phrase :
&quot; O Unas, thy two jawbones which
were separated have been established.&quot; In Chapter
CXXXVlB (1. 10) of the Book of the Dead the deceased says :
&quot;
I have come, I have brought to him
&quot; the jawbones in Re-stau, I have brought to him the
&quot; backbones in Anu.&quot; In Chapter XCIX (1. 27) the
deceased says that the god is equipped and that he is
equipped ; that the god is provided with jawbones, and
that he is provided with jawbones. In Chapter
CLXXVIII (1. 28) it is said to the deceased :
&quot; Horus
&quot; hath avenged thee, he hath destroyed the jawbones2 of
&quot; thine enemies.&quot; From the extract from the Liturgy
we gather that some unpleasant thing had been done
with the jawbones of Unas, and that owing to what the
priest had said and done this unpleasantness had been
done away. And from the passages from the Book of
the Dead we learn that jawbones were taken to Re-stau,
that the deceased rejoiced in his jawbones, and that
Horus had smitten the jawbones of his enemies. So
far as I know there is no Egyptian text which explains
the allusion to the jawbones in any one of these passages,
and it is not until we examine the funeral customs of the modern Sudani tribes that we gain any inkling as to
their meaning. When a king of Uganda died the body
was handed over to the official executioner and to the keeper of the royal tombs, and it was taken to the
country of Emerera, where it was placed in a house.
The under jaw of the dead king was then cut off and
Ed. Budge, p. 65. Arfi, &amp;lt;=&amp;gt;

92 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
placed in a wooden dish, and the executioner having
caused a kibuga, or enclosure containing a few houses,
to be built, deposited the jaw in one of the houses, and
appointed the chief who built the kibuga to be its
guardian. Before the jaw was finally installed, it was
decorated with kauri shells. No king of Uganda before
Mtesa had been buried with his under jaw in its
natural place, 1 and before he died he ordered all the
jawbones of the kings to be collected and buried. The
Wahuma dried their kings for months, till they were
like sun-dried meat, before they buried them, and they
cut out the lower jaws, and covered them with beads and
preserved them. 2 Among other objects brought at the
celebration of the &quot; So-sin Custom &quot; of the king of
Dahomey was the Agranhohwe, or &quot;jaw umbrella,&quot; the
white top and lappets of which were thickly studded
with human jawbones. 3 Skertchley says that the jaw
bones are 84 in number, and that they are arranged
chevronwise. 4 In Ashantee, before the return of the
army, the general in command sends to the capital the
jawbones of the enemies who have been slain. 5
Thus we see that the Baganda and other modern
African peoples cut out the jawbones of their dead kings
and preserved them with honour, and the passage in the
text of King Unas suggests that the Egyptians must
have treated the jawbones of their dead kings in
primitive times in a somewhat similar manner. Now
the cult of Osiris prohibited the mutilation of the human
body, and therefore the custom of cutting out the
jawbones became obsolete. And the statement that
Horus destroyed the jawbones of the enemies of the
deceased is illustrated by the custom in Ashantee and
Dahomey of wrenching the jawbones from the heads of
dead foes and sending them to the kings. It may be
noted in passing that Frobenius figures a trumpet
ornamented with human jawbones, and that he refers to
a curious use made of the lower jawbone by the New

Pomeranians. 1 Colonel Ellis notes that the Awunas, an
Eastern Ewe tribe, say that the lower jaw is the only
part of the body which a child derives from its mother, 2
and he mentions horns decorated with human jaws.
It will have been noticed that the word used in Egyptian
for jawbones is arti, and that it is in the dual, and is
determined by two jawbones ^J^ ^J? , but I believe
that the lower jawbone only is referred to. Some ancient peoples believed that the lower jawbone con
sisted of two bones which were joined at the chin, and
Abd al-Latif, the famous physician who flourished in the fourteenth century of our era, spent a good deal of
time in examining skulls in Egypt, in order to be able to
refute by personal observation the opinion of those who
held this view. The determinatives of the Egyptian
word suggest that the primitive Egyptians agreed on
this point with the opponents of Abd al-Latif. 3
Some interesting light also is thrown on the umbilical
cord and phallus of Osiris by customs concerning the
preservation of these things which obtained until quite
recently among the people of Uganda. In Chapter XVI I
of the Book of the Dead (1. 39 f.) we read :
&quot;
I have
&quot; done away my impurity, I have destroyed the evil things
&quot; in me.&quot; The commentary says :
&quot; What does this
mean ?&quot; The answer is : &quot;It is the cutting off of the
&quot; umbilical cord* of the Osiris, the scribe Ani, triumphant &quot; before all the gods, and the driving away of all the evil
&quot;
things which belong to him.&quot; The commentary says :
&quot;What does this mean?&quot; The answer is: &quot;It is the
purification [which takes place] on the day of his birth.&quot;
From this we learn that the umbilical cord of Osiris was

94 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
cut off, and that this cutting symbolized an act of purifi
cation whereby the god was freed at his birth from
impurity. In the Westcar Papyrus we are told that
when the three sons of Rut-tetet were born, the four
Meskhenit goddesses who were present at their birth
washed in turn each child, cut off his umbilical cord, and placed it in a four-sided cloth which was laid in a stone
box. 1 From the fact that the goddesses preserved the
cord and wrapped it up in cloth and laid it in a box we
are justified in assuming that they attached great import
ance to it, and that they intended to preserve it. Now
Osiris was a king from his birth, and the three sons of
Rut tetet were destined to become kings, and it is there
fore clear that under the Ancient Empire, and long
before, the Egyptians were in the habit of preserving
the umbilical cords of kings and great personages.
What they did with them the texts do not say, but the
customs of Uganda and Unyoro throw some light on the
matter, for the Baganda and Banyoro have been in the
habit of preserving the umbilical cords of kings for
untold generations. Thus Speke tells us :
&quot; The umbilical
cords are preserved from birth, and, at death, those of
men are placed within the door-frame, while those of
women are buried without, this last act corresponding
with the custom of the Wahiyow.&quot;
2 Mr. Cunningham
describes an interview between King Mtesa and the
Namasole, or Queen Mother, who sat side by side on a
sofa. An attendant brought to her the king s umbilical
cord, and having taken it and held it for a moment in
her hand, she placed it on the couch by her side. 3 The
reason for preserving the cord is given by Mr. C. W.
Hattersley, who says that the umbilical cords of kings
are kept in receptacles called Balongo. Each umbilical
cord is attached to a wooden frame beautifully covered
with beads, and when its owner dies his spirit enters the

African Burials 95
wooden frame, and lives there with the cord for ever. 1
If the frame be destroyed the spirit departs.
The investigations made in Uganda by the Rev. J.
Roscoe supply a number of most important facts about
the preservation of the lower jawbone, umbilical cord and
phallus of kings in Uganda. 2 He says :
&quot; The cord seems to be to the afterbirth what the lower jawbone is
to the person to whom it belonged ; that is, the ghost of the person attaches itself to the jawbone after death,
and the ghost of the afterbirth attaches itself to the bit
of cord. Every person is born with a double, viz., the
afterbirth, which has its ghost, and the umbilical cord in
some way connects the ghost of the afterbirth with the
living child .... At the ceremony of naming the
child the bit of umbilical cord is brought out and dropped
into a bowl containing a mixture of beer, milk, and
water. If the cord floats the child is legitimate and the
clan accepts it as a member ; should the cord sink the
child is disowned by the clan and the woman is punished
for adultery. The cord is either preserved by the clan or buried at the roots of the plantain tree with the after birth. In the case of princes the cord is carefully
preserved, and the fortunate prince who becomes king has
the cord decorated and made into a &quot;twin&quot; (mulongo).
This is kept by the Kimbugwe, who each month, after
the new moon appears, brings in the &quot; twin &quot;
wrapped
up in bark-cloth to the king, who holds it for a moment
or two and then returns it to him. It is carried in state to the Kimbugwe s enclosure, drums are beaten in the
procession, and the &quot; twin &quot;
is honoured as a king.
When it is returned to its house it is not put inside, but
is placed by the door and guarded all night ; next
morning the Kimbugwe comes and rubs butter on it,
and restores it to its usual place inside the temple or hut.
The jawbone and the umbilical cord must always be kept
together to fulfil the requirements of the ghosts after the
death of the king.
The stool on which the god Kibuka sits is also of

interest in connection with Osiris. Instead of the usual seat there is a basin 8 inches in diameter, and 4 inches deep, fitted into this. In this basin were kept the lower
jawbone of the god, stitched into a leather case, and with
this were two smaller leather cases containing the genital
organs ; each case is decorated with shells and beads.
These were put in a bag tied with string made from the
fibre of aloes, which was placed in the basin on the stool.
The whole stool with its contents stands 22 inches high. 1
Now if we look at the vignettes in papyri of the Book
of the Dead we shall find that in most cases the side of the seat, or stool, of the god is made to resemble the
front of a tomb, and that the doors, with their bolts, resemble those which are painted on sepulchral coffers
and chests which contain ushabtiu figures and the viscera
of the dead. In other words, Osiris sits upon what is
intended to represent a sepulchral coffer. And if the
stool of Osiris were a sepulchral coffer it must have
contained some portions of the body of the god, and
such portions might well have been his genital organs
and his lower jawbone, as was the case with Kibuka,
the War-god of the Baganda. At all events, the custom
followed by the Baganda in respect of the stool of
Kibuka certainly throws some light on the stool or
throne of Osiris and its sepulchral character. The texts
-are silent as to the fate of the phallus of Osiris, and
Greek writers, being ignorant of the customs of the
Sudan, state that it was never found, and that I sis made a model of it which was worshipped in the temples.
Allusions to the phallus of Osiris and the phallus of Ra
occur in the Book of the Dead, 2 and we may be certain
that the phallus of Osiris must have played a very
prominent part in the beliefs of the Egyptians con cerning the resurrection, otherwise the phallus of the
deceased would not have been identified with Osiris in the Chapter of the Deification of Members of the body
(Chapter XLII).

The chief authorities for the methods of procedure
followed in funerals by the Egyptians are the bas-reliefs
and paintings which decorate the tombs of their nobles,
especially those which belong to the period of the New
Empire, say from B.C. 1600 to B.C. 600. Of special
importance are the tombs of Western Thebes, for whole
series of funerary scenes still remain in them in a
wonderful state of preservation. Most valuable evidence
is also supplied by such works as the Liturgy of Funerary
Offerings and the Book of Opening the Mouth, which are
well illustrated by the scenes depicted on the walls of the
tombs of Rekh-ma-Ra (XVIIIth dynasty), Seti I
(XlXth dynasty), and Amen-em-Ap (XXVIth dynasty).
Also the vignettes of the great illustrated copies of the
Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead, e.g., the
Papyri of Nebseni, Nu, luau, Ani, Hunefer, Anhai,
Nesi-ta-neb-Asher, etc., and the Rubrics, describe and
explain many interesting customs and ceremonies. When
these authorities are examined, and the information given
by them generally is compared with the descriptions of
comparatively modern African funerals and methods
of sepulture given below, the similarity in both customs
and ceremonies will be found to be so marked that it is impossible not to conclude that they are the result of
beliefs which are common to the ancient Egyptians and
to modern Sudani tribes. This similarity is due not to
any borrowing by the Sudani tribes from the Egyptians,
but to indigenous, fundamental African beliefs which
have remained unchanged in all essentials from the end
of the Neolithic Period in Egypt until the present day.
THE BURIAL OF KAMRASI, KING OF UNYORO.
Immediately after the death of Kamrasi, his body was
laid upon a framework of green wood, like a gigantic
gridiron, over a slow fire, until it was quite dry and
resembled &quot; an over- roasted hare.&quot; It was then wrapped
in new bark-cloths, and made to lie in state in a large
house which had been specially built for the purpose.
As long as the succession to the throne is undecided, the body remains unburied, but as soon as the victor in the civil
war, which breaks out on the king s death, is hailed as
king, he goes into the house where his father s body lies, and, standing near it, drives his spear into the ground,



98 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
and leaves it near the right hand of the king. The
victor next buries his father. A huge pit, capable of
holding several hundred people, is dug, and neatly lined
with new bark-cloths. Several wives of the late king
are made to seat themselves together at the bottom, to bear upon their knees the body of their departed lord.
On the night previous to the funeral, the king s own
regiment, or bodyguard, surrounds many dwellings and
villages, and seizes indiscriminately the people as they go
out in the early morning. They are taken to the mouth
of the pit, and, when their arms and legs have been broken with clubs, they are thrown into it, on the top of
the king s body and his wives.
A mighty din of drums, horns, flageolets, whistles,
mingled with the yells of a frantic crowd, drowns the
shrieks of the sufferers, upon whom the earth is shovelled
and stamped down by thousands of cruel fanatics, who
dance and jump upon the loose mould so as to form it
into a compact mass, through which the victims of this
horrid sacrifice cannot grope their way, the precaution
having been taken to break the bones of their arms and
legs. At length the mass is buried and trodden down
beneath a tumulus of earth, and all is still. The funeral is over. 1
According to Mr. Cunningham, the grave of an
Unyoro king was five feet in diameter and twelve feet
deep. The king s bodyguard seized the first nine
Unyoro men they met, and threw them alive into
the pit. The body of the king was then wrapped in
bark-cloth, and sewn up in the skin of a cow newly
killed, and let down into the pit. Another cow-skin was
stretched tightly across the opening, and pegged down
all round ; a covering of grass was laid over the skin,
and a temple was built over the grave. A headman was
appointed watcher, and some of the dead king s servants
were ordered to live there, they and their descendants
after them, and food wras supplied as a matter of course
by the people. The position of the dead body was the
same for king and peasant. The body lay on its left
side, with the hands, the palms facing, under the head,
and the legs drawn up to the body. The poor people

were wrapped in grass, and spirit-houses were built over
their graves. 1
DAGARA S BURIAL. When Dagara, king of Karague,
was dead, the people sewed his body up, as was the
custom in the case of kings, in a cow-skin, and placed it
in a boat floating on the lake, where it remained for
three days, until decomposition set in, and maggots were
engendered. Then it was taken up and deposited on
the hill Moga-Namirinzi, where, instead of putting him underground, the people erected a hut over him, and,
thrusting in five maidens and fifty cows, enclosed the
doorway in such a manner that the whole of them
subsequently died of starvation. Rohinda the Sixth,
father of Dagara, was buried in the same way. Out of
his heart a young lion emerged, which guarded the hill
and was the ancestor of all the lions in Karague ! These
lions became subject to Dagara, and whenever he went
to war he took an army formed of them instead of men,
and was always victorious. 2 Rumanika, son of Dagara,
sacrificed a cow yearly at his father s grave, and placed
pombe and grain on it, because he thought they would
secure for him good crops in the coming year. 3
THE BONGO BURIAL. The dead body is placed in
a crouching position, with the knees forced up to the chin,
and is firmly bound round the head and legs. It is then
sewn up in a skin sack and placed in a deep grave. The
faces of men are turned towards the north and those of women towards the south. 4 THE NIAM-NIAM BURIAL. The dead body is
adorned, as if for a festival, with skins and feathers.
It is usually dyed with red wood. Men of rank have
their aprons fastened to them, and they are buried
either sitting on their beds or enclosed in a kind of
coffin which is made from a hollow tree. The earth is not allowed to touch the body, which is placed in a
specially prepared niche in the grave. The men have
their faces turned towards the east, and the women s are

towards the west. 1 The relatives shave their heads and destroy their headdresses.
THE MORO BURIAL. The uncovered body was
carried to the grave on a strong wicker frame ; a number
of mourning women went in front, and the wives went
behind, and women chanted to the tom-toms. On the way many of the wives turned somersaults, and tried
to throw themselves into the grave. The body was laid
on its right side, in a bent position, as if asleep. A
ligament of bark was tied to the little finger of the left
hand, and the other extremity was drawn to the surface,
and there attached to a peg driven in the ground. This
was to enable the dead man to communicate with his children. The grave was filled up and a mound raised
over it, with a pole in the centre, to the top of which
was fastened the falcon s feather which was worn by the
deceased when alive. The women threw their ornaments on the grave, and the relatives and friends of the
deceased proceeded to hack in pieces with a spear the
carcases of two bulls and to eat them. 2 THE BAHIMA BURIAL. The dead body is washed,
and the arms and legs are doubled up against it by
breaking the joints ; the neck is broken, and the head is
bent over the chest. The body is then tied up in a mat,
forming a sort of bundle, and buried in the great village
manure heap, within eight or ten hours after death. An
ordinary man is buried in a hole dug at the door of his
hut. 3 THE BANABUDDU BURIAL. The male relatives stand on the right-hand side of the body, and the females on
the left, and then, beginning with the head, smear it
with butter ; it is then wrapped round with bark cloth,
and carried to the grave in the neighbouring garden.
The clay all round the grave must be pushed in with the
elbows, and not with the hands and feet.4

THE BASOGA BURIAL. The body is first rubbed
with pulp made from the banana tree, and whilst this is
being done no one must be present as witness of the
operation. It is then rolled up in bark cloth and laid in
a grave 15 feet deep, dug in the deceased s house. All
the bark cloth which the relatives can get is stuffed
into the grave, which is sometimes filled to the mouth
with this material ; earth is then thrown on top and
stamped down flat. As soon as the grave is filled
up the women leave the house, and having shut it
up it remains unoccupied, and eventually tumbles
down. 1
The Basoga perform a curious ceremony in connec
tion with a man who dies away from home. The
relatives go into the bush and bring out a branch or long
reed. This is thrown on the ground, and they say to it,
having called out the dead man s name, &quot; We have come
to bring you home for burial.&quot; The branch or reed is
then wrapped in bark cloth and carried home, and, when
news is brought into the village that it is approaching,
the women scream and wail until the branch is laid in the grave. The usual funeral ceremonies are then
observed. In some places in Basoga the head of the
dead person is washed, and his lips are smeared with oil, 2
which calls to mind one of the ceremonies in the Book of Opening the Mouth, in which the mouth of the
deceased was anointed with oil by the Egyptians.
Formerly, before European influence modified any
of the customs of the country, the successor of a dead
king of Bukole, a district of Basoga, sent a large number
of soldiers to range the country for miles round the
chiefs village, and slay any person they met. During
the raid every attempt was made to capture a young
man and a girl. On the second day after the chiefs
death they were killed, their pudenda were removed,
and together with those of a bull, were put into the
interior of a large fetish drum called &quot;
Kideye.&quot; The
hole in the drum through which this tribute had been
inserted was sown up, and the drum was beaten to

announce the chiefs death. 1 Similar mutilations of a young man and a girl were made in order to make
a sacrifice to the sacred stream on the death of a chief. Sometimes the man and maid after mutilation were thrown into the Nagua River as a sacrifice to the water
spiritB.URIAL OF KINGS IN UGANDA. Formerly the dead
king was carried to Emerera and dried, and when the
lower jaw had been cut out, 3 it was wrapped up in many
layers of bark cloth, and placed on a bedstead which
stood on the floor of a large new house, with a conical
thatched roof. The door was then shut and was never
opened again. The king s cook, the headman of the
beer-pots, and chief herdsman of the king s cows, and
three women of rank equivalent to these, were seized,
and dragged before the door of the closed tomb and
slaughtered. The bodies were not buried, but left for
the vultures to eat. 3
THE BASUKUMA BURIAL. A king or chief is
wrapped up in an ox-skin and buried in a sitting
position. Ordinary folk are wrapped up in the leaves of
the nghali tree, and buried in the centre of the kraal.
At the funeral of a chief the people mourn for two days,
and then eat the ox, in the skin of which the chief is buried. 4
THE MANYEMA BURIAL. A chief is buried in a square pit 10 feet deep, wrapped in bark cloth. At the
bottom of the grave ten living women with their arms
and legs broken are laid, and on them the chief is placed ;
ten men, with their arms and legs broken, are next
brought and laid on top of the chief. 5 The grave is then
filled up with earth, and the burial is complete.
THE LENDU BURIAL. The body of a chief is, by
means of many strips of bark cloth, made to take a
sitting position, and is then placed on a bed of skins
inside a tunnel-like excavation in the grave, which is dug
1 Johnston, Uganda Protectorate, Vol. II, p. 716.

an earthen pot heated by fire from below. The drying process lasted
three months. Speke, Journal, p. 207.

inside the hut of the deceased. This hut, with some times the whole village in which it is situated, is then
abandoned. 1 Ordinary folk are buried immediately after
death near the side wall of the hut. The body is put
into the earth naked, and no coffin of any sort is used.
The Alulu tribe wrap the body in the skin of a freshly
killed bull or cow. Over the grave of a chief a tree is
sometimes planted. 2
THE SENGA BURIAL. When a man dies everyone
utters mournful cries. The body is washed, clothed,
decorated with beads, and wrapped up in a piece of calico
soaked in saffron. Then it is left two days, when it
begins to decompose. It is then placed in a bag of
rushes of three layers, and buried in a hole in the ground
of the hut about five feet deep, and covered over with
thorns and earth. On the grave they put a large earthen
ware urn containing a little flour, while a roast chicken is
placed by the side of it. The natives clap their hands
by way of adieu, and abandon the hut, and everyone who
has touched the body goes and washes in the river. The
members of the family cut their hair, and deposit the
cuttings in a place where two roads meet ; they put on
black beads, and if possible black clothes. Three months after the death the friends assemble for a great feast.
Having prepared a large quantity of beer, they take it
to the hut in which is the grave, and digging a large
hole outside, they set down in it a pot of beer, covering
it with a plate, on which they sprinkle a little flour. Then
they go into the hut, taking with them a sheep. They
remove the urn which was placed over the head of the
grave, dig a little hole and pour in beer ; they also kill
the sheep, and let the blood run down into the hole.
They take the sheep outside, shut the door, and eat the
carcase, and then they wash their hands in the pot of beer
which they have left outside. One of the dead man s
wives, who is called the spirit&quot; (musimo) is carried
away on a man s shoulders, and they give her beer which
she drinks under her veil. They next go to the hut of
the chief widow, where a large hole has been dug and
cemented ; in this they pour the beer, and lie down on

their bellies and drink it. A great feast follows, with
dancing and music. 1
THE LOWER NIGER BURIAL. In the case of a king
or chief, the body is smeared with a decoction of certain
plants, and then rubbed over with camwood oil and spirit,
and wrapped in mats. The favourite method is to smoke
dry the body. Bodies are usually buried in the earth,
but the Andoni use mud altars and platforms in trees ; in
graves the bodies are just laid flat upon the ground.
The possessions of the deceased are buried with him, as
well as the sacrificial victims, both human and animal. 3
THE WANYAMWESI BURIAL. When the last Sultan,
Mkasiwah, died, they dug a large pit, in which they
placed the chief in a large bark box, in a sitting posture,
with one hand at his face and one of the fingers of the
other pointing upward ; beside him were placed two
living men and two living women, and then the whole
was covered over. They look upon the graves of their
chiefs as sacred, and carry food and pray there. 3
THE FJORT BURIAL. The dead body is dried over a
smoky fire, and is then wrapped up in endless lengths of
cloth according to the wealth of the deceased ; and after
some months it is buried. When a king dies the body
is smoked and watched, and the process may take years.
First it is shaved and washed with water or palm wine.
It is then placed upon rush mats for a day, then swathed
in long pieces of cloth, and laid upon a framework bed,
underneath which a hole is dug to receive the water, etc.,
which runs out of the body. A fire is lighted at the head
and foot of the bed, so that the smoke may keep off the
flies. The body is next covered with acaju leaves, then
wrapped up in more cloth, then placed in a coffin, which
is put in a shimbec or hut. There the body may lie for
years. Formerly slaves and wives were buried with a
chief or king. 4
THE GAGA BURIAL. The dead man was buried in a
pit, sitting on a seat. Two wives, with broken arms and

legs, were thrown in with him, and the grave was then
covered over, and palm oil and goats blood poured on
the grave. 1
THE PYGMY BURIAL. The body is washed, painted,
dressed in new clothes, and then seated on a seat of earth, with his beads and &quot; the most part of his goods
&quot;
with him. The blood of goats and wine are poured over
the grave. 2 Memorial feasts for the dead are celebrated four or five times each year.
THE CONGO BURIAL. The body is washed with a
strong decoction of manioc, which whitens the skin. It is then placed in the fetish attitude : the face towards the
setting sun, the knees bent, the left foot raised behind,
the right arm hanging by the side, the fingers of the left
hand separated, crooked, and pointing eastward. A
small fire is kept burning under the body till the intestines
are dried up like parchment. The body is then plastered
over with red clay, and rolled up in cloths till it becomes
a shapeless mass. The richer the person the more the
cloth. Finally the body is buried in a large grave, over
which is erected a hut without a roof. In Loango, the
body is smoked on a scaffold over a green fire, like
elephant meat. It is exposed in a sacred house for from six to twelve months, the relatives coming at stated
intervals to mourn there. The body is then placed in a
coffin shaped like a barrel, and is drawn to the grave in
a kind of car. 3 It is the earnest desire of a Congo man to be buried
in a great quantity of cotton cloth, and to have a grand
funeral. For this he trades, and works, and sins, and
spares no pains. He shivers with cold in the dry season,
but will not put on his back the coat or blanket which is
reserved for his shroud. He suffers all this for the sake
of display at the funeral. When a friend dies it is the
proper thing to take a present of cloth for his shroud. A
man s rich enemies may ruin his family at his death by
their lavish donations for his shroud, which his family
will never be able to repay. A great man is often buried
in hundreds of yards of cloth, and it all goes underground

io6 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
to rot, and be eaten by the white ants. The expense of
a funeral is so great in the case of an important man
that his own accumulations are never sufficient. The corpse has therefore to be kept for a considerable time.
To this end a grave-like hole, two or three feet deep, is
dug in the house in which a man dies. The body is
placed in the hole, and over the hole a mat is spread ; the
mat is then covered with an inch and a half of earth. Fires are lighted by the sides of the hole, and are tended
night and day by the wives of the deceased, who ought
not to leave the house until the funeral. For the first few days the house is crammed with wailing women.
The heat of the fires, the closeness of the crowded hut, combine with the smell of the decomposing body to
create an atmosphere almost indescribable ; but fifty or
or sixty women will crowd in, and sit with tearful eyes,
wailing and chanting their mournful dirges night and day.
After a day or two the wailing moderates, but at ten
o clock at night, and at five o clock in the morning, a special wailing is set up, to the beat of the native gong
and a small drum. In the early night the young people
take the great town drum to the house, and dance for
some hours ; so that with laughter at the antics of a
dancer outside, and tears as the wail surges and falls, the
hours pass. The wives put on an old cloth, and sit and sleep
on the ground. They never wash, nor comb or cut their
hair for months ; pot black and oil are rubbed into their
skin and hair. A few yards of cloth are wrapped round
the corpse before it is put into the drying pit. The heat
of the fires goes down into the ground, and so a slow
dry heat is set up ; in time most of the moisture of the
body evaporates or runs into the soil. It is then removed
from the pit, wrapped in more cloth, and placed on a
shelf in the house. In the dry season the body may be
buried by the side of the house six or eight inches below
the surface, and the place covered with the thorny bases
of palm fronds to keep the jackals away.
Meanwhile the relatives of the deceased have been doing their utmost to raise money for the funeral, and the
younger members of the family are often pawned. As
the day for the funeral approaches the wailing is resumed.
The drum is beaten nearly all night, and in the early



African Burials 107
morning the gong and the chant can be heard. At dawn
for several days there is heavy firing. The body is then
wrapped in its shroud, and around this a &quot;
glorious cloth &quot;
is wound, and then with the thunders of the big drums
and a dirge, it is brought to the great square of the town
so that all may see it. Six strong men raise the body as
high as they can to &quot;show&quot; it, in different parts of the
square. It is then taken to the grave amid screams and
wailings, and when the women have laid their hands on
it, two men jump into the grave to receive the body
and put it carefully in its final resting-place. As soon as
this is done, all weeping and wailing and tears cease as if
by magic. The daughter turns aside, dries her streaming
tears, and walks away chatting lightly.
1
The Bateke, who live to the north of Stanley Pool,
often bury a man in the floor of his own house. The
shroud is cut over the mouth, and in filling up the grave,
after the interment, a pole is placed with one end on the
mouth of the body, and the other end sticking out from the
grave. When the earth is properly filled in and trodden
down, the pole is withdrawn, and so a clear hole is left to
the mouth of the body. Into this hole, from time to time,
palm wine is poured, that the deceased may not lack the
liquor which used to gladden his heart when living.
On the Upper Congo a man of importance has a
number of slaves, who follow him about, paddle his canoe,
and generally serve him. When he dies, it is not fitting
that he should enter the Spirit-world unattended, as
though he were only a slave. Wives will be needed to
cook and care for him ; so, when the time for burial
comes, these conveniences are provided for him. The
dead man is washed, rubbed with oil and powdered cam
wood, which makes him red all over. His face is
decorated, one eye and cheek being made yellow with
ochre, and the other white with pipeclay ; coloured lines
are drawn on the forehead. A broad line in white, bordered with black, is brought down each of his red
arms. Dressed in fine cloth, his hair well braided, his body sits in state on his stool, his pipe in his mouth.
Men and women come to look at him, while the wives and their friends sing a dirge, rattle their rattles, and beat

io8 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
the gongs. In a house near by are ten men, their necks
secured in forked sticks *fc ~* and firmly tied ; they
are to accompany him. Among the weeping wives are
three or four who are chosen to attend him in the Spirit
world. Great crowds assemble on the day of the funeral,
and each person is in full paint and finery, and several
people dance. The body is brought out, and the crowd
gathers in an open space where there is a strange wooden
seat. The ten slaves are brought, and one of them is
placed in the seat and fastened to it. A tall flexible pole
is stuck into the ground, at some distance behind the seat,
and from its top is suspended by a cord a sort of cage.
The pole is bent down, and the cage is fitted to the man s
head. He is blindfolded, and the executioner commences to dance, and make feints, and at last, with a fearful yell, he decapitates his victim, with one sweep of the huge
knife. The pole, thus released, springs into the air.
The crowd yells with delight and excitement. The
body is unbound, and a new victim is placed on the seat,
and this horror is repeated, until the ten slaves have
joined their dead master. The heads are thrown into a
pool of water beside the river, until the flesh comes off,
and then the skulls are placed in the house over the
master s grave. The bodies of the slaves are carried to
the grave, and laid in order on the bottom. Four women
are then seized, and their arms and legs are broken with
blows from a heavy stick, and then, still alive, they are
placed in the grave. The body of their lord is laid upon
them, and the grave is then filled in. Higher up the
river these customs would be considered poor and mean
without a cannibal feast, and the body would be kept
until a hunt for victims could be organized. Among
the Bakuba on the Upper Kasai, three hundred
slaves have been killed at the death of the king or his sister. 1

of a man squatting and embracing his knees. The grave

is dug in the forest in the evening, and the body is
hurriedly buried. The house of the deceased is burnt down, but a small hut is built near the place where it
stood, and there the spirit of the dead man will come to hold converse with the living. Before the hut a ditch is
dug, which is filled with flour and water. By its side is
dug another, in which is placed a pot pierced at the
bottom ; in this palm wine is poured.
THE MUYANZI BURIAL. The body is washed and
painted. The legs are bent in such a manner as to
raise the knees as high as possible, and are kept in
that position by bands of tree bark or native cloth.
The body is then dressed in the richest clothes of the
deceased, and placed before his hut, where for ten days
all come to admire it. The people dance funeral
dances, sing songs, fire off guns, and beat drums ;
this goes on all day, and palm wine circulates freely.
When decomposition is far advanced the body is
buried in the entrance to the house, clothes and all.
THE MONGO BURIAL. The body is washed and
placed in a hut for one, or even two months. It is
then enclosed in a box, which is carved, painted, and
mounted with points resembling horns, and carried
through the neighbouring villages with songs and
dances, and then buried.
THE BANGATA of the Equator put the dead body in
communication with the living by . means of a tube, as
do the people of the Cataract region of the Lower Congo.
THE BAPOTO BURIAL. The body is decorated with
collars, bracelets, glass trinkets, etc., and is buried by
mourning women who wear bands of green leaves round their bodies. THE ARUWIMI BURIAL. The body is buried in a
shallow grave made in the house, and one or two slaves are killed, so that their spirits may go to Spiritland with their master. THE MANBATTO BURIAL. The warrior is buried
where he falls. A hut is built over him, and there the relatives and friends bring baskets of food and jars
of water at intervals, and they keep the grave clean.
The bodies of the poor are left for the ants and
hyenas. VOL. II. I



no Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
THE BANTU BURIAL. The Ababua and the Baieu (Babati) of the Wele-Bomo-Kandi bury the dead on a
bed, at a depth of three feet ; after a month they are
exhumed and buried in another place. This ceremony
is repeated as long as the parents live, and when the
bed is worn out another is provided ; at each exhumation
lamentation is made. The gifts to the dead consist of
food only, and all the property of the deceased is
buried with him. The Baieu eviscerate the body and
dry it.
THE NILOTIC-NEGRO BURIAL. On the north-east Congo the body is buried in a square pit dug in the
house, and is placed in a sitting position with the arms
folded and wrists fixed to the shoulders. When the
pit is filled in, the grave is sprinkled with ox blood or beer. THE BANZIRI BURIAL. The body is arranged in a
doubled-up position on a kind of gridiron of poles, and
a fire is lit under it ; earthen pots are placed to receive
the fat which runs out of it. Those present rub their
faces and hands with this fat, rinse it off with warm water, and the relatives drink the rinsings, thinking thereby to
absorb the virtues of the deceased. What remains of the fat is either sent to absent relatives, or kept in the dead
man s house. The body is not buried until decomposition
is far advanced. 1 THE NDOLO BURIAL. The body is covered with a
coating of red bark paste, and is provided with a new
loin-cloth ; the eyebrows are blackened with charcoal.
It is then hoisted up on to a platform twelve feet high, and
set in a sitting position ; a stick supports the head, and
the hands are spread on the knees. The women and
girls chant a dirge. 2
THE BAHUANA BURIAL. The body is placed in a
sitting position in a grave about five feet deep, with
the face towards the west ; food, palm wine, and all
the clothes and weapons of the deceased are buried
with him. In a small hut above the grave are laid
the fragments of his pots, which are broken at the

African Burials 1 1 1
funeral ; here the brother of the deceased often places
an offering of food. Women have their pots buried
with them. A man killed by lightning is buried lying
on his back. The foreheads of the men mourners are painted black, but the women paint the whole face
black. 1 The mourning colour of the Bayaka women
is red. 3
THE BALUBA BuRiAL. 3 When an important Luba
chief expires, every one, great or small, must mourn
in a subdued tone ; the members of all the brother hoods come before the house where the body lies to
perform dances ; the women violently strike their
hatchet and hoe against each other. This deafening
hubbub lasts a day. The relatives then make a
distribution of beads among all the dancers, and the
tumult ceases. During this time a young slave is
obtained ; his neck is broken by a blow, and he is
laid by the body for two days. He is the chiefs boy
attendant. The chiefs wives, squatting near him, do
not cease their lamentations. Some days pass in this
way without other incidents ; after which the stiffened
limbs are forcibly bent and the body placed in its wicker
coffin. In the house two stages are raised, one above
the other ; on the upper one is placed the coffin, on the
lower a large earthen pot. The body decomposes ;
a noxious liquid infested with maggots escapes from it
and falls into the receptacle ; it is left there for several
weeks. When the body is ready, that is to say, when
the nails can be taken off easily, the Musungi (i.e., the
&quot;peacemaker&quot;), the provisional &quot;executor&quot; of the
deceased, raises the lid of the coffin, removes all the nails from the feet and hands, and the belt of hippopotamus
hide, the badge of greatness, cuts off the middle finger of
the right hand and a great toe and places them together
in a hollowed fruit, which is placed in a small basket with a
cone-shaped cover. The bundle is entrusted to the
nephews of the deceased ; they proceed to hang it up in
1 Torday and Joyce, Notes on the Ethnography of the Ba-Huana, p. 290. 2 George Grenfell, Vol. II, p. 655.
3 The following account by a Belgian missionary is printed in George Grenfell, Vol. II, p. 655. I2



1 1 2 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
the ancestral hut. One of the nephews has it under his
special care, and is responsible for the whole under pain
of death or banishment. At this time they sacrifice a
slave ; his death announces the event.
Finally the burial is proceeded with. The important
men of the village, followed by some relatives, proceed
by day and night towards a shallow marsh, carrying
the remains of the deceased. A great chief can never
go thus into the Other World without taking away a
portion of his slaves ; and so whenever the funeral pro
cession is set in motion, two men are beaten to death with clubs and thrown across the public road without burial ; it is their mission to tell passers-by that their master has gone along that way to his last dwelling.
As soon as the site of the grave has been selected, the
men build a large square barrier of grass and weed,
drain off the water which is within, and set to work with feverish activity to dig a deep ditch of about six
feet, taking care to keep the side walls well hollowed
out ; and forthwith two female slaves of the dead man, who have as a preliminary been decked in their finest
attire, descend of their own accord (or by force, and in
spite of their laments and sobs) to the bottom of this tomb,
lie on their sides face to face, and stretching out the
arm which is next the ground, embrace the decomposed
remains of their master. The jar containing the liquid
and worms I have described is emptied and broken in
the grave. These poor women, mad with misery, do
not always show themselves eager to fulfil the task
required of them at the funeral ; for that reason they are usually bound, or sometimes their skulls are mercifully
broken. During that time, six slaves brought for the
purpose are butchered, and their bodies placed in the
hollowed walls ; then the ditch is quickly filled up, and
the marsh water, escaping over the barrier, makes its
way in and covers this sad spot with a silence which will
be broken for a moment, some months later, by the
piercing cries of new victims. In short, the same grave
diggers will return to the grave, bringing a man in
bonds, whom they will force to build a wooden enclosure
on the edge of the marsh ; when he shall have completed
his task, one of them will drive into his breast the head



African Burials 113
of his lance, crush his head, and lay him in a ditch beside
the chief. Then a few days before the arrival of a
successor at the dead man s village, they will go again
with a slave, and some jars of beer, force the wretched
man to pull out all the stakes and drop all the jars in a
small ditch ; then they will kill him likewise, and bury
him on the other side of the grave. The departed is satisfied ; his successor may come.
THE NSAKARA BURIAL. On a bed, in an immense circular ditch, his head resting on the arm of his favourite wife, is laid the body of the deceased, dressed in his
richest attire ; around him, attached to stakes, the
strangled bodies of the wives who have been unwilling
to survive their husband ; thrown pell-mell in the ditch
the bodies of slaves and servants who have worked for the dead man ; such is the hideous spectacle presented
to a crowd craving for pain and slaughter. The ditch
is filled up, and on the newly-piled earth begins the sacrifice of the victims destined for the feasts celebrated
in memory of him whom they are lamenting ....
These repasts of human flesh last many days. 1
THE UPPER CROSS RIVER BURIAL. The old and helpless members of the community are hit on the head
by their fellows, who carefully smoke-dry their bodies.
These are afterwards pulverized, and formed into small
balls by the addition of water in which Indian corn has
been boiled for some hours. This mixture is dried in the sun, or over fires, and is then put away for future use
as an addition to the family stew. 2
THE ARAB BURIAL. Sir Samuel Baker attributed to the Arabs the grave which, as has been seen above,
is of purely African origin. He says :
&quot; The graves of
the Arabs are an improvement upon those of Europeans.
What poor person who cannot afford a vault has not
felt a pang as the clod fell upon the coffin of his relative ?
The Arabs avoid this. Although there is no coffin the
earth does not rest upon the body. The hole being dug
similar in shape to a European grave, an extra trench
is formed at the bottom of the grave about a foot wide.
1 From the Report of a Belgian missionary, printed in George Grenfell, Vol. II, p. 657.
2 Kingsley, West African Studies, pp. 555, 556.



H4 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
The body is laid upon its side within this trench, and
covered by bricks made of clay which are laid across ;
thus the body is contained within a narrow vault. Mud
is then smeared over the hastily-made bricks, and
nothing is visible, the tomb being made level with the
bottom of the large grave. This is filled up with earth,
which, resting on the brick covering of the trench, cannot
press upon the body. In such a grave my best man
was laid the Slave women raising their horrible
howling, and my men crying loudly .... I was glad
to see so much external feeling for their comrade, but
the grave being filled, their grief, like all loud sorrow,
passed quickly away, and relapsed into thoughts of
buffalo meat ; they were soon busily engaged in cutting
up the flesh.&quot; 1
THE ABYSSINIAN BURIAL. When a person is seized
with the fever, the relatives set in front of him all the ornaments of gold and silver and fine clothes which their
respective friends can collect, making at the same time
as much noise as possible with drums, trumpets, and
loud outcries, which is done with the view of &quot;
driving
out the devil &quot; of the man, for most Abyssinians believe
that most diseases are caused by demoniacal possession.
When it is seen that the sick man is about to die, the
drums and trumpets cease, and all present set up
mournful howls. And when death is announced, they
tear out their hair, scratch the skin from their temples,
and throw themselves with sobs and screams on the
ground ; they show such agony that one would imagine
that the very existence of the universe was threatened
by his death. Relatives, friends, acquaintances and
servants together produce indescribable confusion. Soon
after death, the body is carefully washed, fumigated with
incense, and sewn up in one of the cloths which the
deceased wore when he was alive, and is then carried
to the grave, in which it is laid whilst the priests recite
appropriate prayers. On the following day the relatives
and friends celebrate the feast in honour of the dead.
An image of the deceased is made up and dressed in
rich garments, and is placed on his favourite mule, and
carried in procession through the town to the tomb. A

number of professional wailing women join the pro
cession, and keep up a terrible noise the whole time,
saying :
&quot; Why did you leave us ? Had you not houses
and lands ? Had you not a wife who loved you ?
&quot;
Arrived at the tomb the cries and wailings are redoubled, the priests shout &quot;
Hallelujahs,&quot; and the relatives scream
in concert. The whole party then goes back to the house
of the deceased, and partakes of a huge meal of meat,
and drink is provided in such quantities that every
member of the party eventually becomes drunk. 1
From the statements contained in the above descrip
tions of modern African funerals the reader will see that the similarity between them and the funerals of the
ancient Egyptians is too close and too widespread to be
the result of accident. The indigenous Egyptians being
Africans buried their dead like Africans. A settled government enabled the craft of the undertaker to
develop and flourish to a degree undreamt of in Central
Africa, but it may be safely asserted that the well
preserved condition of Egyptian mummies and funerary
furniture is due far more to the protection of the lime
stone hills and the sandy deserts than to the art of the
embalmer and his colleagues. Everything put into the ground of the Central African forest perishes through
damp and insects, and the same is the case in the fertile
Delta of Egypt ; only in those parts of Egypt where
tombs can be hewn in the mountains or in the stony bed
of the desert have mummies and funerary furniture been
satisfactorily preserved.

CHAPTER XIX.
THE AFRICAN DOCTRINE OF LAST THINGS.
IMMORTALITY.
C THE offerings found in the pre-dynastic tombs of Egypt
\ prove that the indigenous inhabitants of the country
J believed in existence after death, and the persistent
\ allusions to &quot;everlasting life&quot; and immortality which
) are found in the texts of all periods show that the belief
(^in a resurrection was general. Two or three passages
are sufficient to prove how definite this belief was, and
it is unnecessary to quote more than the following :
To Unas, a king of the Vlth dynasty, it is said, &quot; Hail,
&quot; Unas ! Assuredly thou hast not gone as one dead,
&quot; but as one living to sit upon the throne of Osiris/ 1
Again, the same king is declared to be the son of the god
Temu, the Father-god and Creator, and it is said : &quot;He
&quot;
(i.e., Temu) liveth, this Unas liveth ; he dieth not, this
&quot; Unas dieth not.&quot; 2 That this life beyond the grave
was everlasting is proved by the words of Thoth, who
said to the deceased :
&quot; Thou shalt exist for millions of
years, [thy] period of life shall be millions of years.&quot;
3
The deceased says that his soul is both God and
eternity, 4 therefore God is eternal and His servant

partakes of the attributes of the Deity and lives for ever
with Him.
THE KA OR DOUBLE.
Having proved by their own words that the Egyptians&quot;
believed in a future life, we have to try to find out
from their religious literature (i) what portion of a
man s entity it was which lived after the death of his
body ; (2) what form it lived in ; and (3) where it lived.
These questions are full of difficulties, for however
closely we may examine the texts, we still find there are
many points about which they give no information at all,
and the confusion and contradictions which meet us in many documents prove that the writers of them were as
much puzzled when they tried to harmonize their state
ments as we are. The Egyptians more than most peoples tried to explain the unknowable, and, of course,
failed. The physical body of a man was called KHAT,
/I s^r^ a WOI*d which sometimes has as its deter
^ _cK^ W3
minative a mummy, jjds*i, or a mummy lying on a
bier, ^?; the word seems to mean something which
decayed. The god Osiris had such a body, and it lay
in Anu (Heliopolis). 1 When the body was born there
came into existence with it an abstract individuality or
spiritual being, which was wholly independent and
distinct from the physical body, but its abode was the
body, whose actions it was supposed to direct, and guide,
and keep watch over, and it lived in the body until the
body died. No healthy child was ever born without
this spiritual being, and when the Egyptians drew
pictures of it they always made it resemble the body to
which it belonged ; in other words, they regarded it as
its &quot; DOUBLE.&quot; Its name in Egyptian was KA, and the
hieroglyph which represents it is |_J, i.e., two human arms extended at right angles to the breast as if ready
to embrace someone ;
2 in late times KA simply meant

&quot;
person,&quot; or &quot;
self, &quot;and the Romans, had they under
stood the true meaning of the word, would probably
have translated it by &quot;genius natalis.&quot; When the body
died the Ka did not die with it, but continued its existence ; whether it was supposed to live for ever
cannot be said. The body was preserved in a tomb, so
that the Ka might come and visit it whenever it pleased,
but it could not be considered the dwelling-place of the
Ka after its death. Therefore the Egyptians prepared
a figure or statue of the dead person to whom the Ka
belonged, taking great pains to give it all the character
istics of the deceased, so that the Ka might recognize it
as an image of its body and be pleased to enter into the
figure and take up its abode there. The Egyptians
placed the figure or statue so prepared in the tomb
with the body, sometimes in a niche, and sometimes in
a very small chamber behind a stone partition with an
opening in it, so that the Ka might see and hear all that
was going on in the tomb when visitors came there to
pay visits in its honour. The figures set up in memory
of the dead by many modern African peoples are in
reality Ka figures, only the original purpose of them has
been forgotten. Dr. Schweinfurth rightly says that
such figures are not idols, and in describing those which
were on the grave of Yanga, the Bongo chief, he
mentions rough-hewn figures, as large as life, which
were carved to represent the chief followed by his wives
and children. Some figures of this kind have bead
necklaces and rings, and hair is fixed in appropriate
G
laces on the body. 1 No pains are spared in making
uch figures as life-like as possible. In the case of a
very great man such a figure is placed in the middle of
the town or village, in order that the living may benefit
by consultation with the Ka when it visits it. Thus in
the town of Cashil, in the Jaga country, there was such
an image 12 feet high in the centre of a circle of
elephants tusks, and the natives were in the habit of
making offerings of palm oil and goats blood to it.
The name of the figure was Quesango (Kizangu). Else
where were several smaller images. 2

I2O Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
Not only was it necessary to provide a figure for the
Ka to dwell in, but if it was not to perish of cold,
hunger, and thirst, offerings of meat, drink, clothing,
etc., must be placed in the tomb by the friends and
relatives of the dead, so that the Ka might eat and
drink, anoint and dress itself, even as its body had done
when upon earth. The Ka did not, of course, consume
the actual offerings of food which were given to it, but
\ only the spirits, or &quot;
doubles,&quot; of the bread, beer,
\ vegetables, meat, oil, etc., and similarly it arrayed
) itself in the spirits of the suits of linen apparel which
- were offered to it. No uncertainty about this belief is
possible, for all the sepulchral prayers contain a petition
to the effect that thousands of meals of every kind of
good and pleasant food may be given to the Ka of So
and-so. In the Chapter on Osiris and the Doctrine of
offerings, numerous instances are quoted of the methods
of making offerings to the Kau, or Doubles of the dead,
employed by the Egyptians and modern peoples in
r Africa. Therefore it is sufficient to say here that the
\ custom of offering food, etc., to the dead with the object
\ of preserving the existence of the Kau can be clearly
)
traced in Egypt and the Sudan from the Pre-dynastic
L- Period to the present day.
Assuming, then, that the Ka was provided with a
statue in which to dwell in a well protected tomb, and
regular and sufficient offerings, there is no reason why
it should not live for ever. It has, however, always
been the common experience that sepulchral endowments
become alienated, that tombs are destroyed by natural
and other causes, or &quot; usurped
&quot;
by strangers, and that
bodies perish, however carefully embalmed or mummified.
In such cases the fate of the Ka was sad indeed, for it was then obliged to go and seek its own food, and
hunger and thirst might compel it to eat offal and to
drink filthy water. Its existence might be prolonged by
the prayers of the pious who entreated the gods of the
dead to provide it with food, but sooner or later a change
of religion would come, men s ideas would change, and
the Ka would be unprovided for. When the Egyptians
embraced Christianity, the Kau of their ancestors must
have starved, for the Egyptian Christians made no



Doctrine of Last Things 121
offerings to the dead, and they did not pray the magical
prayers which in earlier times were believed to secure
food for the dead. .The Kau of dead Egyptians would
meet with little charity at the hands of their descendants
who embraced Islam, for they had been &quot;unbelievers,&quot; and the offspring of the &quot; time of ignorance
&quot;
(jahiliyati), who
knew neither the God of Islam nor its great Prophet. On
this point the words of the Kur an are quite definite :
Upon those who believe not, and who die in their
unbelief, shall be the curse of God, and of the angels
and of all men ; they shall remain under it for ever, their punishment shall not be alleviated, neither shall
they be regarded. 1 If, as seems likely, the fate of the
Ka was bound up with that of the body, then many
score millions of Kau must have perished when the
ancient religion of Egypt came to an end, at least so far
as ordinary people were concerned. We read of KAU in
the kingdom of Osiris, but these, probably, belonged ta
kings and chiefs and nobles who were buried with
elaborate rites and ceremonies, which conferred on them
the privileges of the gods who lived for ever, or they
may have belonged to the gods themselves.
A belief in the existence of the Ka exists among some
modern African peoples. The Tshi-speaking tribes2 use
the word Kra to designate the spirit of a man, which
enters him at birth, lives with him throughout his
life, and leaves him at death. This spirit is entirely
distinct from the man himself. The word Kra is generally
interpreted &quot;soul,&quot; but the Kra does not in any way
correspond to the European idea of soul, and it has
nothing to do with the soul which, on the death of the
body, departs straightway to the Land of the Dead.
The Kra is not the man himself, in a shadowy or ghostly
form, that continues his existence after death in another
world, but is a kind of guardian spirit, who lives in a
man. The Ewe-speaking peoples have a similar belief,
the indwelling spirit being by them termed a &quot; Luwo.&quot;
The Ga-speaking peoples assign to each individual two indwelling spirits called &quot;
Kla,&quot; one male and one female, the former being of a bad and the latter of a good
1 Surah II (The Cow).
2 See Ellis, The Tshi-speaking Peoples, p. 149.



122 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
disposition. And they give good or bad advice, and
prompt good or bad actions, according to their respective
dispositions. 1 The Bantu equivalent of the &quot; Kra &quot; or
&quot; Kla &quot;
is called &quot; Manu.&quot; 2 The Ba-Huana believe that
man is composed of body, bun (soul), and double (doshi).
The Doshi is a shadowy second self, corresponding to
the Kra of the Tshi-speaking tribes of the Gold Coast,
and the Ka of the Ancient Egyptians. It leaves the
body in sleep, and visits other people in dreams, and the
Doshi of the dead appear to the living in the same
manner. All people have Doshi, and animals also. At
death the Doshi lingers about in the air, visits its friends
and haunts its enemies ; it will persecute the relations if
the body has not received proper burial ; there are no
means of exorcising it. 3 The Bayaka of the Kwango
Kwilu also believe in the existence of an imperishable
principle or soul, according to Mr. Torday, which they
call &quot;Doshi.&quot;4
Colonel Ellis says that when a man dies his Kra
becomes a &quot;
Sisa,&quot; and a Sisa can be born again and
become a Kra in a new human body. It can remain in the
house with its dead body, and can annoy the living and
cause sickness. If it fails to find a new body, it must go to
the land of Insisa, where the Insisa (plural of Sisa) live and
build houses. This country lies beyond the River Volta.
Usually Insisa do no harm to the relatives of its dead
body unless they have not buried it with proper care and
ceremony ; therefore are the dead buried with great care,
for the relatives like to think that the Sisa of the dead
relative is sitting with them comfortably in the hut, and
not wandering about outside unprovided for. The Sisa
lives near the house until the end of the period of
mourning, when it goes to the country of Insisa. The
Ahantas build special small huts for the Insisa, in which
1 The Yorubas think that a man has three indwelling spirits :
i. The Olori, which dwells in the head, and is the protector, guardian,
and guide of a man; to it offerings are made. 2. The Ipin ijeun,
which dwells in the stomach. 3. The Ipori, which dwells in the big toe. Ellis, Yoruba-speaking Peoples, p. 126.

they place a bundle of hair of the deceased, and meat
and drink offerings.
1 These facts are of importance, for
they show that the modern African holds about the Kra,
and its later development the Sisa, views similar to
those which the Egyptian held about the Ka, and the
urgent necessity there was to bury the body with full
ceremonies and to provide for the Ka.
THE SPIRIT- BODY (SAHU).
The fact that the Egyptians and many peoples of the
Sudan were in the habit of drying the body in the sun or
embalming it, and swathing it in cloth of some kind,
proves that its preservation was in some way necessary
for the eternal welfare of its spiritual constituents. The
Egyptians were a practical people, and they would never
have gone to the expense and trouble of embalming the
dead unless they had believed that it was absolutely
necessary. There is no proof that they ever expected
the physical body to rise again ; on the contrary, the texts state clearly that the soul is in heaven, the body
in the earth,&quot;
2 and &quot;
thy essence is in heaven, thy body in the earth &quot;
;
3 and this, notwithstanding the texts say :
&quot;
I germinate like the plants&quot;;
4
&quot; my flesh,
germinateth
&quot;
;
5
&quot; I am, I am, I live, I live, I ger
minate, I germinate
&quot;
;
6 and in the &quot; Book of Breathings
&quot;
it is said to the deceased : &quot;Thy soul liveth, thy body
&quot;
germinateth by the command of Ra, without diminution,
&quot; without defect, like [that of] Ra, for ever and ever.&quot;
These statements taken together prove that the
Egyptians believed that some kind of body rose from
the dead, and continued its existence in the Other C World. The pictures of the beatified as seen in papyri \

show us that this risen body had the form and appear
ance of the physical body which had been mummified
and laid in the grave. We know that the KA was
maintained by the offerings of relatives and friends of
the dead, but we have no information as to the means by
which the Sahu, 1 or revivified body, was kept in exist
ence. The word &quot; sahu &quot; seems to mean something like
&quot;
free,&quot;
&quot;
noble,&quot; &quot;chief,&quot; and in this case it appears to
be used as the name for a body which has, by means of
the religious ceremonies that have been performed over
it, obtained freedom from the material body and power
whereby it has become incorruptible and everlasting.
Hence arose the great importance of funeral ceremonies
and offerings, which caused a spiritual body to spring
( from the physical body, and the KA to continue its
\existence after the death of the body to which it
belonged. As the physical body formed the abiding
place of the KA and the soul, so the spiritual body was
believed to afford a dwelling-place for the soul, for it is
distinctly said2 that &quot;souls enter into their sahu.&quot; And
the spiritual body had power to journey everywhere in
heaven and on earth, for to King Teti it is said :
&quot; Thou
&quot; hast received thy sah, thy foot shall have no limit
&quot; set to it in heaven, thou shalt not be driven back on
&quot;
earth.&quot;3
Modern African peoples also believe that the living
man and the Kra become on the death of the man a
ghost or shadowy man and a Sisa. On this point all the
Tshi-speaking peoples agree.4 The Tshi name for the
shadowy man is &quot;
Srahman,&quot; plur., Asrahmanfo. The
Srahman does in the Other World what he did when he
lived here ; the chief is a chief, the peasant a peasant,
and the slave a slave. He has the same passions,
appetites, needs, and necessities as living men, and he
lives on and enjoys the intangible individualities of the
offerings which are made at his grave. 5 The Yoruba

tribes call the &quot;ghost-man
&quot; &quot;
Iwin,&quot; or &quot;
Okan,&quot; but the
latter word also means &quot;
heart.&quot; The Iwin holds the position he held here in the Other World, if he reaches
it, but this he only does if the prescribed funeral rites
have been properly performed. If these be omitted the
&quot;
ghost-man&quot; wanders about the world, cold, hungry,
and homeless, and he may be seized by evil spirits
and cast into &quot; the unseen world of potsherds.&quot;
1
Dr. Nassau tells us that the Uvengwa is the self
revivified spirit and body of a dead human being. It is
an object of dread, and is never worshipped in any
manner whatever. It is white in colour, but the body is
variously changed from the likeness of the original
human body. 3 The Baluba believe that the soul con tinues to reside unimpaired in the corpse, with the
possibility of detaching itself, not freely and untram melled, but in association with a vague, impalpable
something, a kind of phantom or spectre which has the
exact appearance of the dead body, but has not its real
substance. It is under this shadowy form, which is, in
short, the dematerialized body, that the soul will hence
forth live in the realm of the dead. The Baluba believe the soul to be a principle distinct from the body, and
endowed with a more ethereal nature, but unfit to exist alone without some veil or phantom. This phantom has
not always the exact shape of a human being. Thus
the phantom of a man whose flesh has been eaten by
cannibals takes the form of a dried skeleton, and that of a man whose body has been burnt will for ever appear as
a wreath of smoke dropping an ashy dust. 3 Thus the
ancient and modern evidences taken together show that the Egyptians and Sudani peoples believed in a resur
rection, and thought that the spirit body was enabled to
rise from the physical body through the rites and
ceremonies which were performed over it.

126 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
THE SHADOW (KHAIBIT).
Closely associated with the body was its shadow,
I
, and the Egyptians appear to have thought it one
of its most important attributes. We do not know what
ideas they held about its functions when the man to
whom it belonged was alive, but it is quite certain that they did not believe the resurrection of the spiritual
body to be complete unless that phantom form was in
possession of its shadow. The texts lead us to suppose
that the Sahu was an immaterial form of the physical
body, and it seems that the Egyptians thought it to be
material enough to cast a shadow ! In the text of Unas
the shadow is mentioned in connection with the &quot;
form.&quot; 1
In the Theban Book of the Dead the deceased prays
that his Ba and Khu and Shadow may not be shut in in
the Other World, 3 and elsewhere3 we read, &quot; O keep not
&amp;lt;c
captive my Soul (Ba), O keep not ward over my
&quot; Shadow, but let a way be opened for my Soul and for
&quot; my Shadow, and let [me] see the great God in the
&quot; shrine, on the day of the Judgment of Souls, and let
&quot; [me] recite the words of Osiris, whose habitations are
&quot; hidden, to those who guard the members of Osiris,
&quot; and who keep ward over the Khu (Spirits), and who
&quot; hold captive the shadows of the dead, who would
&quot; work evil against me, lest they work evil against me.&quot;
In the vignette in the Papyrus of Ani we see Ani
standing by the door of his tomb, and his soul in the
form of a human-headed bird hovering over his spirit
body. In a variant vignette4 the soul is hovering over
the shadow of the deceased, which is painted solid and
black. Further on in the text of the same Chapter it is said :
u Thou shalt have dominion over thy legs, and thou
shalt advance to thy body straightway in the earth.&quot;
These passages are important, for they show : ( i ) That
there were believed to exist certain evil Shadows who would do harm to their fellow Shadows if they could ;

S2)
That the Shadow was associated with the Soul ; 3) That the Shadow had the power to move about and
to go where it liked. The difference between the spirit
body and the Shadow is so slight that we can readily
understand how easily one was confounded with the
other in men s minds.
The Shadow is a recognized portion of man among
modern African peoples. In West Africa the natives
told Dr. Nassau that it was possible for a human being
to have his nsisim, i.e., shadow, stolen or otherwise lost, and for him to exist in a diseased or dying state. In
this case his body would cast no shadow. 1 The same
authority says there is a widespread belief among the
natives in a &quot;dual soul,&quot; which consists of a &quot;spirit,&quot;
which, as far as is known, lives for ever in the world of spirits, and a shadow, which for an uncertain length of
time hovers around the mortal remains. 2 Here we seem to have a confusion between the spirit-body and the
shadow of a man. The shadow, according to Miss
Kingsley, is one of the four souls of man. She noticed
that men would march happily enough through forest or
grass land on a blazing morning, but when they came to
a piece of open ground they would go round it, not
across it, because they were afraid of losing their
shadows. They only do this at noontime. On asking
some Bakwiri why they were not anxious about losing
their souls at night time, she was told that at night all
shadows lay down in the shadow of the Great God, and
so became stronger. Had she not noticed how long and
strong the shadows of men, trees, and mountains were in
the morning ? Murders are sometimes committed
secretly by driving a nail or a knife into a man s shadow. 3
The Nandi think that the human soul is embodied in a person s shadow, and it is firmly believed that after
death the shadows of both good and bad people go
underground and live there. 4 All the Nandi are afraid
of a shadow. 5 At one time among the Bavili it was

128 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
considered a crime for one person to trample upon
or even to cross the shadow of another, especially
if the shadow were that of a married woman. The shadow was supposed to sleep in the body of its owner
at night, and if a sorcerer were to rob a man of his
shadow it was equivalent to taking away his life. The
shadow enters and leaves the body by the mouth, and is
then likened to the breath of a man. When a man dies he has no shadow, and when he falls into a fit or trance the Bavili say it is because some sorcerer has taken his
shadow. 1 According to the Fjort the Shadow ceases to
exist on the death of the body. 2
We have now described the physical body, the spirit
body, the double and the shadow, and it remains to
consider the African beliefs about that portion of a man
which we call the soul.
THE SOUL OF THE KA, OR BODY-SOUL.
To one of the constituents of man s spiritual economy
the Egyptians gave the name of &quot;Ba,&quot;
&amp;lt;4^,
a word
which, by general consent among Egyptologists, is
translated &quot;soul.&quot; Various attempts have been made to
provide a derivation for the word, and it has been
thought to mean something like &quot; noble &quot; or &quot;sublime,&quot;
but all such derivations are mere guesses, and it must be
frankly admitted that the exact idea which the Egyptians
associated with the word is unknown. The texts afford no explanation of it, but they give a certain amount of
evidence which shows us generally what they thought
the Ba to be, and this, especially when compared with
modern African ideas of the soul, is invaluable. The
Ba, it seems, was connected closely with the Ka with
which it dwelt, and it appears to have been regarded as
the soul of the Ka. It was not incorporeal, though its
nature and substance were somewhat ethereal. It was
gratified by the offerings made to the Ka of the dead
body in the tomb, and perhaps it partook of their spirit
entities. It revisited its Ka and the body in the tomb,
1 Dennett, At the Back of the Black Man s Mind, p. 80.
2 Dennett, Folklore of the Fjort, London, 1898, p. 116.



Doctrine of Last Things 129
and it could take up its abode there at pleasure ; it was
free to travel all over heaven, and to mix with and to hold converse with souls there, and it could take any
form it pleased. The Ba of a man was represented by
a bird with a bearded human head ^\ . As in the
Pyramid Texts we read of a &quot;
living Ba,&quot;
1 we must assume that there was such a thing as a dead Ba, in
other words, that the Ba could die. The Ba could live in a body not its own, for at their pleasure the gods sent
their Ba into the dead king Unas. 3 The Egyptians
believed that more than one Ba belonged to a man, for
the &quot; Baiu &quot; or &quot; souls &quot; of King Pepi were placed at the
head of the Two Companies of the Gods. 3 The &quot; souls &quot; here referred to are, of course, the other portions of the
spirit entity of man which resemble the Ba in nature and
substance. The Egyptians believed that the Ba might,
by the agency of evil spirits, be prevented from rejoining
its Ka and physical body, and that it might wander
away from them, and even be shut up with them and
unable to get out. Therefore was written the LXXXIstT
Chapter of the Theban Book of the Dead, in which the deceased prayed :
&quot; If my Ba would tarry, let it be
&quot; brought to me from whatsoever place it may be in
&quot;
. . . let me have my Ba and my Khu ... let it look
&quot; upon its physical body, let it rest upon its spirit-body.
*
From the same chapter we learn that the rejoining of
the Ba to its Ka and body was supposed to take place in
Heliopolis, where the Soul of Osiris rejoined itself to the
body of that god. According to one view, when the Ba
visited its Ka and body in the tomb it took writh it air
and food, which we may assume were intended for the
Ka ; this is proved by the vignette in the Papyrus of
Neb-qet, 4 in which the Ba, in the form of a human
headed bird, is actually seen descending the shaft of the

pit of the tomb leading to the mummy chamber bearing
with it air and water.
We have already seen that offerings were made to
the Ka, and a passage in the Book of the Dead
(Chapter XXIXc) suggests that the Ka, if needing food,
had the power of making the Ba to bring it. The
deceased says :
&quot; I am the Bennu, the Ba of Ra, the

Papyrus of Ani is a heart ^, which proves that in the
XVIIIth dynasty the heart was somehow associated
with the Ba and the Ka, and we must, it seems to me,
conclude that the Ba was the soul of the Ka, and that its seat of being was in the Ka.
THE HEART.
In Egyptian dbl
9&quot;, which literally means &quot;
heart,&quot; is
used to express wish, longing, desire, lust, will, courage, mind, wisdom, sense, intelligence, manner, disposition,

Eth. :) may be connected with this word.

attention, intention, etc., and it is clear that the heart was regarded as the seat of life, and as the home of the
passions, both good and bad, and as the seat of the
pleasures derived from eating, drinking, and the carnal
appetite. There appears to have been a soul which was
connected with the heart. It was not, I believe, the
soul as we usually understand it, but the heart-soul. 1
The importance of the heart to the deceased will be readily understood from the fact that no less than five
Chapters of the Book of the Dead (XXVI-XXX) are
devoted to its preservation. In one of these (XXVI)
the deceased prays for a heart, for, if he has no heart,
he says :
&quot;
I cannot eat of the cakes of Osiris on the &amp;lt;c east bank of the Lake of Flowers. . . . With the &quot; mastery of my heart I am master of my arms and legs,
&quot; and I can do whatsoever my Ka pleaseth, and my
&quot; soul will not be fettered at the gates of the Tuat.&quot;
Here, clearly, we see that the welfare of the soul depends
upon that of the heart. In the XXVIIth Chapter the
deceased appeals to the &quot;stealers of hearts &quot; 2 not to take
his heart-soul away; and in the XX VI 1 1 th he prays
that his heart-soul may not be carried off by the War
gods of Heliopolis, 3 and that it may not be given to
Suti (Set). The vignette represents the deceased
seated and clasping his heart to his breast with his left
hand, in the presence of a monster, the form of which
appears to be derived from that of the ourang-outang,
or the soko, of the forests of the Sudan. In the
XXIXth Chapter the deceased prays that his heart may
be neither taken away from him, nor killed, and he identifies himself with Horus, the &quot;dweller in hearts,&quot; and with the &quot;lord of hearts, the slayer of the heart/
In Chapter XXX he addresses with reverence the heart
of Osiris, and the intestines [of the god] and the Four
Sons of Horus, who protect the viscera. The contents of the famous &quot; Heart-Chapter
&quot; (XXXs) have already
been described ; in this the heart and its soul are addressed by the deceased.
1 On the Heart-soul, ffdti, see infra, p. 137.



132 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
Among modern African peoples the heart of both
man and beast is regarded as the source of all life,
emotion, passion, movement, and strength, and in the
case of man the heart is often identified with the soul. 1 Thus the Ba-Huana call the soul and the heart by the
same name &quot;
Bun.&quot;2 The priests of Ogun used to
take out the hearts of human victims, and reduce them to powder, which they mixed with rum and sold to
persons who wished to be endowed with great courage.
Such people swallowed the mixture, and believed that
by doing so they absorbed all the courage of the dead. 3
Among the Nandi the warrior always ate a small portion
of the heart of the dead man in order to make himself brave. 4 The heart of the lion, the elephant, and other
mighty beasts has always been prized, and eaten joyfully
by the natives, and as a proof that the custom is still
observed we may quote the experience of the unfortunate
Lieut. Boyd Alexander. After he killed a lion, and the
beast had been skinned, John, his cook, secured all but
a little corner of the heart, and having dried it took it
home to make strong the heart of his little son. 5
THE SPIRIT-SOUL (Knu).
The exact- meaning of the word Khu, or, as it is
written in the Pyramid Texts Aakhu, is very hard to
discover, and authorities have differed greatly in their
translations of the word, and in their descriptions of what
the Khu is. That it was a very important portion of a
man is clear from texts of all periods, and there is no
doubt that it was supposed to be eternal. The Pyramid
Texts prove that the Khu of the gods lived in heaven,
and thither wended the Khu of a man as soon as ever the prayers said over the dead body enabled it to do so.
King Unas &quot; stood at the head of the Khu,&quot;
6 i.e., he was the chief of all the Khu ; and when the souls of the gods
transferred themselves from their own spirit-bodies to

Doctrine of Last Things 133
Unas, their Khu were before Unas. 1 The god received
the king as a brother, and placed him among the
&quot; imperishable Khu.&quot; 2 The last passage is important,
for the hieroglyphic determinatives suggest that the Khu
were beings of light, comparable to the stars, and the
evidence of other passages supports this view, and
indicates that the Khu of a man was the intangible,
ethereal, transparent portion of his immaterial economy,
to which modern nations have given the name of
&quot;
spirit.&quot; The Khu is mentioned in connection with the Ba and the Khaibit (Soul and Shadow), 3 and with the Ba
and the Ka (Soul and Double), 4 but it is clear that it is
something quite distinct from the Ka, Ba, and Khaibit,
though in some respects it must have possessed cha
racteristics similar to these immaterial entities of man.
We have seen that the texts speak of man having more
than one &quot;
soul,&quot; and that the Egyptian, like the modern
African, thought that he possessed three at least, the Ka,
or Double, the Ba, or Heart-soul, and the Khu. The Khaibit or Shadow was confused at times with the Ka.
It appears, then, that the Khu is the Spirit, or Spirit
soul of a man, which it was impossible to injure or kill,
and that it was the vital principle of a man and was
immortal. The Ka perished if offerings were not pro
vided for it, and the Ba (Heart-soul) might, it was
thought, also die, but the Khu was &quot;
imperishable.&quot;
Appertaining to the Khu was the Sekhem Py_|jk
the functions of which are not known exactly ; the word
means power,&quot; and it may be an immaterial personifi
cation of the energy of a man. To King Pepi it is said :
&quot; Thy Sekhem cometh among the Khu &quot;
;
5
&quot;
thy Sekhem
is pure among the Khu &quot;
;
6
&quot; thou art pure, thy Ka is
pure, thy Ba is pure, thy Sekhem is pure.&quot;
7 Osiris and every god had his Sekhem, and Ra is called the &quot; Great
Sekhem, the Sekhem among the Sekhemu.&quot;8

134 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
From the above facts we are able to state the
following :
When an Egyptian was born he was believed to
possess a physical body ( Khat) and an immaterial Double
(Ka), which lived inside the body and was associated
closely with the Ba, which dwelt in the heart, and which
appears to have been connected with the Shadow of the
physical body. Somewhere in the body lived the Khu
or Spirit-soul, the nature of which was unchangeable,
incorruptible, and immortal. When the body died there
could be raised from it by means of words, holy or
magical, and ceremonies performed by the priests, a
Isis giving bread and water to the Heart-soul.
Spirit-body called Sahu, which the Khu (Spirit-soul)
could inhabit at pleasure. The Ka, Ba, or Heart-soul,
and Shadow dwelt in the tomb with the body, or
wandered about outside it and away from it, when they
desired to do so. Their existence was finite, and appears
to have terminated whenever funerary offerings failed to
be made to them. As all tomb-endowments came to an
end sooner or later, the destruction of the Ka and its soul
and shadow was certain. On the other hand, the Sahu, or Spirit-body, which was revivified from the physical
body, was wholly independent of offerings, for it derived
its sustenance from the Khu, or Spirit-soul, and this
was self-existent and immortal. Therefore it was the Sahu which entered heaven and lived with Osiris and the
blessed for all eternity. This being so it is easy to



Doctrine of Last Things 135
understand why the Egyptians took such pains to pre
serve the bodies of their dead by mummification, and
why the custom of embalming the dead continued in
Egypt for some centuries after the introduction of Christianity into that country, in fact until the doctrine
preached by Saint Anthony became known. This great
ascetic taught men to believe that Christ would, at the
Resurrection, give them back their bodies in a glorified
state, and that therefore mummification was unnecessary
for the genesis of the spiritual body.
If we consider the facts stated in the preceding para
graphs as a whole, and compare the Egyptian s belief
about the constituent parts of his spiritual entity with the
beliefs of other ancient peoples, we find nothing
resembling it. It stands quite alone, and it is not until
we come to examine the modern African beliefs con cerning the soul that we find anything similar to it. It
will be seen from the facts given below that among the
tribes of the Sudan and Western Africa exactly parallel
beliefs exist, and we are driven to conclude that the
eschatological ideas of the Egyptians were not peculiar
to themselves, but belonged to the indigenous peoples of those parts of Africa.
THE DUAL-SOUL OF THE MODERN AFRICAN.
Speaking generally, the belief in a future life among
modern Africans is as universal as the belief in God. The Masai say that when a man dies and is eaten by a
hyena, all is over with him, and that the soul does not
come to life again. They say also, somewhat inconsis
tently, that when a medicine man dies, or a rich man, and is buried, his soul turns into a snake as soon as his body rots ; and the snake goes to his children s kraal to
look after them. 1 The Bari think that when a man dies,
the person is gone absolutely, never to return, in fact
that a man is &quot;worn out.&quot;2 The Bahima believe in the
spiritual existence of chiefs, 3 according to Sir Harry
Johnston, but Mr. Cunningham says that they have no

2 Frobenius, Die Heiden-Neger, p. 137. 3 Johnston, Uganda, Vol. I, p. 631.



136 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
belief in kings or warriors coming back. 1 Neither the
Masai nor the Bahima appear to bury the bodies
of ordinary folk, for the former throw them out into the
bush, and the latter hang them on the branches of trees
for the hyenas to eat, 2 but kings and chiefs are buried,
because it is thought that their existence does not end with the death of their bodies. Although the African
may say that he does not believe in the resurrection of
the body, his acts prove that he takes the existence of
the soul in another life for granted. Mr. Nassau found
that the very people who were declaring unhesitatingly
that men came to an end like goats, dogs, and chickens,
took the greatest care of their family fetish, and sacrificed
diligently to the spirits of their ancestors, and appealed
to them for help in their family undertakings. 3
In West Africa the belief in the DUAL-SOUL, i.e., the
soul of the body, and the soul, or, as we may call it,
the &quot;
Spirit-soul,&quot; is well-nigh universal. The soul of the body, the Egyptian Ba, is mortal, but the Spiritsoul, the Egyptian Khu, is immortal. Nothing is
soulless to the African, and even matter is thought to
be a form of soul, of a low order it is true, which souls of a higher nature can make use of. 4 It is generally
thought that, in addition to the Body-soul and the
Spirit-soul, man possesses also a Life-soul and a Dream
soul. The Life-soul is viewed in different ways by
different peoples. According to some it is of equal
importance with the Body-soul and the Spirit-soul, but
others regard it as a member of a class of spirits which
is associated with man from his birth to his death. All
agree that it has its abode in the physical heart, and
that it can be drawn away from the heart by witchcraft ;
when the Life-soul is stolen from a man his body dies.
Some regard the Life-soul as a sort of guardian spirit,
and at times it is spoken of as if it were a man s
conscience, and it is important to note that a kind of
worship is accorded to it as to spirits. The general

folk. Ibid., p. 832.

4 Kingsley, West African Studies, p. 199.



Doctrine of Last Things 137
drift of the evidence which we have about it suggests
that this Life-soul is nothing more nor less than the soul
of the heart, and that it was known to the Egyptians.
In the Chapters of the Book of the Dead which
deal with the heart are two words commonly rendered
heart by translators. The first of these is db, f\ J ^ ,
and the second is kali, 1
&amp;lt;&amp;gt;. Thus in Chapter XXX A
&amp;lt;=* \\
the deceased says :
&quot; My db, my mother ! My hati, my
being !
&quot;
It is quite easy to say that db and hati are
synonyms, and to translate accordingly, but the Egyptian
must have made some distinction in his mind when he used them, and it seems to me that in the earliest times db meant the physical heart, and hati the soul of the
heart, or the state, or quality, or mental condition, of
the heart. Both the db and the hati could be stolen, as the titles of the Chapters in the Book of the Dead
prove, and the result would be in either case the same
to the body, namely, death. The db could be given to a
man (Chapter XXVI), or carried away from a man
(Chapter XXIX), or struck dead (Chapter XX IX A), or
a model of it could be made in sehert stone (Chapter
XXIXfi), or it could be spoken against, or cursed, or
bewitched (Chapters XXXA, XXXs). The frati could
only be carried off, or stolen, and the vignette of
Chapter XXVII in the Papyrus of Ani proves that the
deceased adored it, for we see him standing reverently before the hati, which, in the form of a heart, is set upon
a pedestal before him O In the scene of the weighing
of the heart which is found in fine papyri, the heart seen in one pan of the Balance probably represents the Hati, or Heart-soul. The name &quot; Dream-soul &quot;
is given to that part of a
man which is thought sometimes to leave him during
sleep, and to wander away into strange places, where it
sometimes meets with remarkable adventures. Some
times it enjoys its freedom so greatly, and so delights in
its intercourse with other Dream-souls, that it forgets to
come back to its body before the man wakes up. If it
1 In Coptic



138 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
does come back in time its reunion with its body dulls
its faculties, and the person, in his efforts to remember
or to tell what he has seen, relates only the vagaries of a
dream. If it does not come back in time, the man to
whom it belongs falls seriously ill,
1 and recourse must be
had to a witch-doctor, if his life is to be preserved. The witch-doctor professes to be able to bring back the
Dream-soul to its home, but there is a great deal of
fraud connected with the process. It is most important
for a man that every soul of his shall be in him, for any
breach in the intercommunication of his souls is followed by the decay and death of his body. If the Dream-soul
of a man has lost itself, a new one must be found to take its place, for the abode where it lives in a man must in no case be left empty, otherwise a &quot;
Sisa,&quot; i.e., the soul
of some person who has not been properly buried, will
step into it and dwell there. Unfortunately a Sisa is
usually accompanied by a crowd of devils, or evil spirits,
and these enter a man with it, and produce illnesses of
all kinds, fever, delirium, convulsions, etc., which must cause death unless they and the Sisa can be ejected from
the body. 3 It is a prevalent belief that Dream-souls
which lose themselves are caught by witch-doctors, who
set traps for them in a systematic manner, and then sell
them to their original owners at high prices. Though a
man has a Dream-soul substitute in him, which in a
general way is satisfactory, he is never really comfortable
until he gets his own Dream-soul back, and he usually
spares no pains to effect its capture. Sometimes the
witch-doctor is paid by an enemy of the man to whom
the Dream-soul belongs, to keep it in captivity and
thereby to cause his death ; in such cases it is not only
caught and kept, but tortured, and hung up over the
canoe fire, and so on. 3 Yet another soul of man is believed to exist by the
Africans, viz., the Bush-soul. It lives in some animal
in the forest, a pig, or a leopard, and offerings are made to it ; these are placed in small huts built far away in
the forest. If the animal in which is a Bush-soul dies or

Doctrine of Last Things 139
is killed, the man who is connected with the soul dies also ; and if the man dies or is killed, the animal con taining his Bush-soul contrives to die or be killed also. 1
These three souls, the Life-soul, the Dream-soul, and
the Bush-soul, appear to be phases of the Body-soul,
and it seems to me that actually the Egyptian and the
African only know of the Dual-soul, i.e., the Body-soul
and the Spirit-soul.
TRANSMIGRATION OF SOULS AND TRANSFORMATION.
The Egyptians believed in the transmigration of
souls, and their priests composed a series of Chapters, 2
the recital of which enabled the souls of the dead to take
any form they pleased. A soul could become a golden
hawk, a divine hawk, a tchatcha chief, a god of light, a
lily,
3 the god Ptah, a Bennu bird, a heron, a living
soul,&quot; a swallow, a serpent, and a crocodile. It could
remain in each of these so long as it pleased, presumably
without losing its identity, and it could pass from one
form to another at pleasure. By passing into the body
of a Light-god it became an equal of the luminaries of
heaven, as a bird it could explore the sky, as a serpent \
the earth, and as a crocodile it could travel whither it pleased in the waters. Among modern Africans the
belief is current that the souls of men make periodic
migrations into hyenas, 4 in order to attack and injure
or kill those who have done their bodies harm.
Dr. Junker s servant Ahmad told him a story of a
woman in Sennaar who had been turned into a hyena5
by witchcraft, an occurrence of which, he assured him,
he had been an eye-witness. 6 The human soul which
1 Ibid., p. 208.
2 See Book of the Dead, Chapters LXXVI-LXXXVIII.
3 It is curious to find a flower mentioned in this category, for though
the African gives a soul to vegetable matter, he denies to it mind and
intelligence. Leonard, The Lower Niger, p. 188.
4 Schweinfurth, Heart of Africa, Vol. II, p. 322.
5 The Nandi believe that hyenas talk like human beings and that they hold converse with the spirits of the dead. They say the hyenas
are hermaphrodites, and they are supposed to put on spectacles, and an
apparatus to assist their hearing ; they are supposed to intercede with
the spirits of the dead, so that the lives of children placed on their
paths may be spared. Hollis, The Nandi, p. 7.
6 Junker s Travels in Africa, Vol. I, p. 333.



140 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
enters into an animal does not necessarily lose its human
personality, or change into that of a beast, and the belief
in this possibility does not include the idea of a per
manent residence in the animal. 1 A human soul in an animal may do harm to members of its own family, as in
the case of the soul-possessed elephant at Benita in 1867,
which was laying waste a certain plantation. When
the owner was asked why he did not shoot it, he said he
dared not, as the spirit of his father who had died
recently had passed into it. 2 The Wanyamwesi of East
Africa believe in transmigration, both during life and
after it. In Mashonaland they believe that both the
living and the dead can change themselves into animals,
either to execute some vengeance, or to procure some
thing they wish for. Thus a man will change himself
into a hyena or lion to steal a sheep and make a good
meal of it, or into a serpent to avenge himself on some
enemy. 3 According to the Barotse, the spirit of a chief
takes up its abode in a hippopotamus, but yet they carry
water to his tomb. 4 The tribes of the Lower Niger
think that certain individuals can transform the human body into that of an animal, and vice versa, and that
human beings can be possessed by souls of animals.
The human soul does not alter the character of the animal, but the animal soul in a man debases him. 5 This power of transformation is called &quot; Ehehe.&quot; Major
A. G. Leonard mentions the case of a woman of Utshi who was accused of causing the death of one Oru, who
was devoured by a crocodile. This she was supposed
to have done by projecting her Spirit-soul into the
crocodile which devoured him, and not by transforming
herself into the animal. 6 In Southern Guinea it is believed that a man can turn himself into a tiger and
destroy the lives and property of his fellow men. He
can also turn his enemy into an elephant and kill him. 7
Among the Yorubas a belief is current to the effect

7 Wilson, Western Africa, p. 398.



Doctrine of Last Things 141
that men can transform themselves into trees, shrubs, rocks, etc., as well as into animals. 1 Up and down the
main Congo the Bantu populations consider it possible
for the spirits of dead and living men to enter the bodies
of buffaloes, leopards, and crocodiles, in order that they
may inflict injuries on their enemies. The Busoko
cannibals of the lower Aruwimi believe in a kind of transmigration of souls. 2 Thus from one side of Africa
to the other we find that the belief in the transmigration
of souls is general, but it may be noted that among
modern peoples it is usually associated with evil intent.
The object of all the transformations provided for the
Egyptian was to do good to him, and to benefit him,
and not to enable him to do harm to other people. Still,
the facts prove that the Egyptians and the modern
Africans held precisely similar views about the trans
migrations of souls.
NEW BIRTH AND REINCARNATION.
/*%
There are at least two passages in the Theban
Recension of the Book of the Dead which show that the f
Egyptians believed in the possibility of a &quot; second birth.&quot;
The first occurs in the LXIVth Chapter, in which the
deceased identifies himself with the &quot;God of the hidden \ soul, the Creator of the gods,&quot; and refers to his second
birth, 3 and the second in the CLXXXIInd Chapter,
wherein Osiris is addressed as &quot;he who giveth birth to
men and women a second time.&quot;4 The context in the latter case suggests that the new birth or re-birth here
referred to did not take place in this world, but in the A
kingdom of Osiris, and in the former case the new birth
of the deceased seems to resemble the re-birth of Ra, \
the Sun-god, who, it was thought, was re-born daily.
In neither case can the re-birth be considered as re incarnation as the word is understood at the present time.

142 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
Among modern African peoples it is believed that a
considerable number of the souls of the dead pass into
the bodies of their descendants, and live there per
manently. 1 The idea of reincarnation is very strong in
the Niger Delta tribes. Among them, Miss Kingsley says :
&quot; Most I think I may say all human souls of the
surviving soul class are regarded as returning to the
earth again, and undergoing a reincarnation shortly after
the due burial of the soul. 2 When a baby arrives in the
house after the death of a chief, articles which once belonged to deceased members of the house are pre
sented to it, and then, according to the one it picks out,
it is decided who that baby really is See, Uncle So
and-so knows his own pipe, etc., and I have often
heard a mother reproaching a child for some fault say :
* Oh, we made a big mistake when we thought you were
So-and-so. &quot; 3 According to popular belief, a certain
proportion of spirits, who have recuperated their
evidently diminishing energy during their stay in spirit
land, are obliged to be re-born into their own family.
Thus we have a belief in a reversion to the ancestral type. These spirits, who are chosen by the &quot; dormant
or self-existent Creator,&quot; are those of men of strong
character and moral stamina, especially those who have
been good domestic managers, traders, farmers, or
hunters, but not necessarily men of commanding ability
or marked individuality. ^-The re-birth of the soul into
I the human body is not merely a belief, in the ordinary
j
sense of the word, but a conviction, that neither argument,
satire, nor ridicule will uproot or even shake. Proof of
re-birth depends on physical and external similarities of
appearance between the living or human and the departed
t&amp;gt;r spirit elements, and in making comparisons particular
attention is paid to birth-marks, scars, cicatrices, defects, deformities, etc. In addition, the expression of the
intelligence and individuality is taken into consideration,
and the testimony of the dream-soul communications,
and the feeling of the absolute immutability of the creative principle. This conviction is so inflexible,
1 Nassau, Fetichism, p. 56.
2 Travels in West Africa, p. 461.
3 Kingsley, West African Studies, p. 145.



Doctrine of Last Things 143
handed down as it has been in uninterrupted succession
for thousands and thousands of years, from father to son,
and from mother to daughter, that when an infant having
a mark of some kind on its body dies, and another
happens to be born with a mark in any way similar, or
bearing the slightest resemblance to it, it is at once said
to be the same child born over again. It is the custom
of the tribes all over the Niger Delta to give the child a
name which implies
&quot; re-born.&quot; 1
Many pygmy tribes think that their dead relations
live again in the form of the red bush-pig, 2 and the Banza
of the Western Mubangi basin believe that their chiefs
are reincarnated in chimpanzis. 3
DEATH.
The Egyptian theologians believed that there was a
time when there was no death, 4 but that time was when
the god Temu alone existed, and before he created
the heavens and the earth, and men and &quot;gods.&quot;
How and why death came the texts do not tell, but,
judging from the views which are held in the Sudan at
the present time, we may assume that the Egyptians
regarded death as the means necessary to enable man to
continue his existence after the breath left his material body. The present world was to them merely the ante
chamber of the Other World ; a man s house in this world was a temporary abode, but his tomb was his
4 eternal house,&quot;

men to enjoy themselves, 6 to anoint and scent their bodies,
to wear garlands and lilies, to cherish the woman beloved,

to think only on things which yield pleasure, until the
day when they must come into port in the land that
loveth silence. 1 &quot; Follow after enjoyment and forget
care,&quot; was the advice given by his soul to the man weary
of life, 2 and the dead lady That-I-em-hetep advised her
husband to eat, drink, marry wives, enjoy himself, and to
have no thought or care or sorrow so long as he lived.
For, she adds, Amenti is a place of stupor and darkness,
and Death calleth every one to him, gods and men, and
great and little are all one to him, and he seizeth the babe
as well as the old man. 3 The ordinary Egyptian felt as
did old Chinsunse, who said to Livingstone: &quot;We live
&quot;
only a few days here, but we live again after death.
&quot; We do not know where, or in what condition, or with &quot; what companions, for the dead never return to tell us.
&quot; Sometimes the dead do come back, and appear to us in
&quot; dreams ; but they never speak nor tell us where they
&quot; have gone, nor how they fare.&quot;4 In spite of this, however, the Egyptian did not devote all his life to the
pursuit of pleasure, and he who had the necessary means
prepared an &quot;eternal house&quot; for himself, so that when
death claimed him, he might have a &quot; secret place
&quot;
wherein to free himself from his material body, and rise
in the Spirit-body, and depart to the Other World which,
in spite of all the assertions of his priests, must ever have
been a place of the deepest mystery.
The modern African believes that more than half the deaths which occur are caused by witchcraft, 5 and that
usually a body only dies because someone has stolen one
of its souls. 6 Among many tribes death is always
supposed to be caused by witchcraft, but a few peoples
are ready to admit that some deaths are due to the
call of Njambi (i.e., God, or Providence). 7 Here and

there a people, e.g., the Wakamba, believe that death
from natural causes is quite possible. If an old man dies
they say,
&quot; he was due to die :
&quot;
it is fate (ingue). 1
Livingstone in his definition of the primitive African faith
says that &quot; death is often a punishment of guilt, such as
witchcraft.&quot; 2 The Bantu believe in a &quot;
spirit of death,&quot;
and according to a legend of Kintu, the founder of the
Unyoro-Uganda dynasty, it was attached to this king in
the form of a young man, owing to an act of disobedience
to God on his part. 3 Among them death is in no way
regarded as a cessation of being. They have no idea of
the resurrection of the body, for that is buried, but the
spirit, the man himself, lives on. Where and how he
lives they know not. 4 The Baluba of South Central Congoland think that death in no way causes a separation
of soul and body ; it is a stoppage of the heart produced
by : (i) A fatal accident, or (2) the power of a sorcerer,
or (3) the spirit of a deceased relative. Some have an
idea that a spirit in the Other World complains to
Kabezya-Mpungu that it is lonely, and asks that So-and
so who is living on earth may be sent to him. Kabezya
Mpungu then despatches a messenger who fastens on the
person whom he has come to summon. This is sickness,
and when God gives the signal this messenger begins to
compress the heart, and continues to do so until it has
ceased to beat. That is why they say of a sick man :
&quot; Such an one has seized him &quot;
; and of a dead man, &quot; God &quot; has visited him, the All- Powerful has got possession
&quot;of him&quot;; or again, &quot;his father has called him,&quot; or,
&quot;his mother has slain him.&quot; 5
Among the tribes of the Lower Niger death is not
only accepted and looked on as a spiritual causation, but
death itself is personified, as with the Egyptians, 6 and
dealt with as a powerful spirit, who gains the mastery over
the life of the human ego by depriving the soul of the body, i.e., ejecting the former, so that dissolution of the latter

supervenes. The native regards death as a relentless
and inexorable demon who, although omnivorous and a
glutton who is always gorging himself, is not so much a
devourer of souls as a carrier away of them. With this
description may be compared the passages in the XVIIth
Chapter of the Book of the Dead, which describe :
(i) The god with the face of a dog and the eyebrows of
a man, who feedeth on the dead, who watcheth at the
Bight of the Lake of Fire, who devoureth the bodies of
the dead, and swalloweth hearts, who voideth filth, and remaineth unseen. The name of this being is &quot; Devourer
for millions of years.&quot; (2) The great god who carrieth
away the soul, who eateth hearts, who devoureth offal,
the guardian of the darkness, the dweller in the Seker
boat. His name is either Suti, or Smam-ur, the Earth
soul. The latter passage suggests that the ancient and
awful god Seker, who sat enthroned in darkness in the
bowels of the desert west of Memphis, is Death himself.
Though the native believes that in some cases death is
due to some former act of omission or commission on the part of the deceased, and in others to natural decay, e.g., senile decay, he thinks that nearly every death is, in the
first instance, due to or associated with witchcraft. 1
When a person falls ill among the Nandi it is attributed to
the anger of an ancestor, and when he is nearing death his
male relatives say :
&quot; The soul has become very small.&quot;
Mr. Hollis2 records a Nandi myth to the effect that the
early dwellers on the earth were threatened by a dog
with death, unless they gave him milk from their gourd
and beer through their straw. &quot;If you do this,&quot; said he,
&quot; I will arrange for you to go to the river when you die,
&quot; and to come to life again on the third day.&quot; The
people laughed at the dog, and gave him some milk and
beer to drink off a stool. The dog was angry at not
being treated like a human being, but he drank the milk
and beer, and as he went away he said :
&quot; All people will
die, and the moon alone will return to life.&quot; This is why the dead do not return, and why the moon reappears
after three days absence.3 Two other causes of death

are mentioned by Miss Kingsley, viz., some action on the
part of the Bush-soul, and reincarnated disease. When
a man falls ill, he sometimes thinks that his illness is the result of anger on the part of his Bush-soul, and therefore
causes offerings to be made to it in a little hut in the
forest built on the last place in which it was seen.
As no one but an Ebumtup, or person endowed with the
gift of second sight, can see his own Bush-soul, the
services of a witch-doctor are obtained, and attempts are
made by him to placate the Bush-soul. If these are not
successful, the sick man dies. Or, the Bush-soul may
through some rash act on its part become wounded or
killed, and then its owner will die. A reincarnated soul may have suffered from some disease in a former state of
existence in the body, and this having been reincarnated
with the soul causes the death of the new body. 1

CHAPTER XX.
SPIRITS AND THE SPIRIT-WORLD.
THE Egyptians believed that the spirits of the dead,
whose bodies had been buried with the proper rites and
ceremonies, went ultimately to a region which was set
apart for them and was called &quot;Tuat,&quot; *^ ^
. It
follows of necessity that very few Egyptians could
afford the expense incurred in embalming, in hewing a
tomb in the rock, and in purchasing funerary furniture
and offerings, etc., therefore the bodies of a very large
number of people must have been disposed of by some
means or other each year without &quot;
burial,&quot; as the
high-class Egyptian understood the word. Kings and
members of the royal family, nobles, and officials and
priests were, no doubt, &quot;
buried,&quot; but the working
classes, and peasants and slaves, must have been thrust
into shallow graves in the sand on the edge of the
desert, from which they were ultimately dragged by
wild beasts and devoured. There is no proof that the
dead were wilfully cast forth into the desert to be eaten
by beasts, as the Masai cast their dead into the bush and
invite the hyenas to come and eat them, but it is quite
clear that the dead must have been got rid of by some such
means. The cultivable land of Egypt was too valuable to
be devoted to them, and the number of tombs which
remain is remarkably small when we consider the scores
of millions of human beings who lived in Egypt under
thirty dynasties of Pharaohs. We have already seen
that the Kau and Body-souls of the dead perished
when the supply of offerings failed, or when the dead
had no friends to recite the magical formulae which
produced offerings, but there remained the immortal
Spirit-souls of the dead, and these must have proceeded
to the Land of Spirits when they departed from their
bodies. Therefore this region must have been inhabited
by the spirits of all the human beings who had ever been



Spirits and the Spirit-world 149
born in Egypt, and their number must have been millions.
An obscure passage in the Book of the Dead 1 mentions
4,601,200, or 4,301,200, Spirit-souls (Khu), 2 but whether these represented all the inhabitants of the spirit-world of Egypt cannot be said. In the Short Version of the
Chapter &quot; 12 cubits &quot; are mentioned, and this may be the
height of the spirits. If so, spirits must have been of
varying heights, for the spirits who reaped the wheat and
barley in the Second Division of the Domain of Osiris3
were nine cubits in height, the wheat and barley being
five cubits high. In the Fifth Division the spirits who
lived on the helpless shadows of the dead had thighs (?)
seven cubits long.
As the Egyptians believed that there was once a time
when death did not exist, there must have been a time when there were no human souls in the Tuat, if it then
existed. The great and unknown God alone had being,
for the gods were not born until a later period. Now,
we read in many funerary texts of the &quot; Gods of the
Tuat,&quot; so we must assume that after death entered the
world, and souls began to go to the Tuat, they found
there these gods, who had been created by the unknown
God. Each of these appears to have had a separate
entity ; their relationship with the unknown God is not
clear, but they were like human beings and souls, inferior
and subordinate to Him. As time went on these gods
became more and more independent, and the unknown
God appears to have allowed them to do as they pleased,
and in the end they became the arbiters of the destinies
of the souls of men. The cult of Osiris in no way
interfered with this view generally, but the man who
wanted his soul to go to the kingdom of Osiris after
death was called upon to obey during his lifetime the
commands of this god, and not to worship &quot; gods
&quot;
who were of no account. The gods of the Tuat
possessed many of the qualities and attributes of men ;
when pleased they were good-tempered and benevolent,
and when angry they gratified their feelings of revenge.

150 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
They could be placated by service and offerings, and
they showed their pleasure and gratitude by doing acts
of kindness to their worshippers, and by assisting them
when in trouble and difficulties. Those who were wise
spared no pains in obtaining their help, and in disarming
their opposition. The spirits of the dead were regarded
with much the same feelings as the gods. Their power
for evil was believed to be greater in the Tuat than
upon earth, for their freedom from the body gave them
greater facilities for doing harm to men. They could,
moreover, move about unseen, and escape from invisible
spirit-foes was well-nigh impossible. There were good
spirits as well as bad, but the Book of the Dead
practically ignores the former, and its magical formulae
were directed entirely against the operations of evil
spirits. Though naturally of a gay and light-hearted
disposition, the Egyptian must have lived in a perpetual state of fear of spirits of all kinds, spirits of calamity,
disease, and sickness, spirits of angry gods and ancestors,
and above all the spirit of Death. His imagination
filled the world with spirits whose acts seemed to him to
be generally malevolent, and his magical and religious
literature and his amulets testify to the very real terror
with which he regarded his future existence in the world
of spirits. Escape from such spirits was impossible, for they could not die.
The views of modern African peoples about spirits
and their world throw much light upon the denizens of
the Egyptian Tuat, and a few of them are here noted.
Among the Nandi the Oiik, i.e., devils, or spirits of
departed kinsfolk, cause sickness and death, and when
they move about underground earthquakes take place.
They appear to men in dreams. They may be propitiated
by offerings, and prayers must be made to them. 1 The people of the Congo believe that souls can act as demons,
and must be propitiated. The lesser spirits, at any rate,
are human in their intelligence, can be flattered, pro
pitiated, deceived ; are sometimes kind to the individuals
or clans they patronize, or who adopt them as protectors
or allies. 2 Departed souls must be kept in a good

Spirits and the Spirit-world 151
humour, and must, if possible, be kept at a distance ;
food and drink must be given to them, and huts built for
them. 1 In West Africa the natives mourn the loss of the bodies of their dead, whilst at the same time they
drive away their spirits with yells and noises of every
kind. These spirits are worshipped, with worship of a deprecatory character, but their continued presence is not
desired. 2 The Dinka and Bongo tribes know no spirits
except those which are evil. 3 The evil spirits in Ankole
are very numerous, and they cause sicknesses. 4 Some
spirits which have inhabited human bodies are supposed
to have existed before birth as well as after death. It is considered possible for a minor evil spirit to be born with
a man s soul, and to enter a man s body during sleep. 5
The I bo define the soul as the fruit of the body, and
the spirit as the living or vital energy of a person, in
other words, the soul whose material body has died or
perished. They make no difference between soul and
spirit.
6 In Northern Guinea the spirits of the dead are
supposed to mingle freely with the living, and they
convey warnings and admonitions to human beings in
dreams. 7 Messages can be sent to spirits by dying
people, 8 and Mr. H. Ward actually heard a message being
given to a slave, who was to be beheaded, for a spirit by
a man who said :
&quot; And tell him when you meet, that his
biggest war-canoe, which I inherit, is rotten.&quot; 9 In
Dahomey every act of importance was reported to the
king s ancestor by the spirit of a man who was killed on
purpose. 10
The Egyptians speak in their religious texts of
Heart-souls, Spirit-souls, Kau, or Doubles, Sahu, or
Spirit-bodies, and Sekhemu as if they formed separate

152 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
orders of spirits, and we find that modern African
peoples also arrange the spirits in different groups. In
each case the grouping does not mean, it seems to me,
that the nature and character of the spirits of the various
groups are different, but only that their occupations are
different. Dr. Nassau classifies the spirits of West Africa thus : The first class is known by the name of &quot; Anina&quot; or
&quot;
Malina,&quot; and consists of souls or spirits, embodied and
disembodied ; they take a great interest in human affairs,
and especially in those of the families of which they are
or were members.
The second class is called &quot;
Abambo,&quot; which may be
rendered &quot;
ghosts.&quot; Where they live and why they
appear is unknown. They are never asked to appear,
and are rarely worshipped, and their coming is dreaded.
They are the spirits of dead tribal ancestors, as dis
tinguished from the spirits of strangers. The natives cannot decide whether they are benevolent or malignant,
or whether to love or hate them. The Abambo are the
spirits which are supposed to possess men ; they are cast
out only with the greatest difficulty, When Abambo
appear to human beings they rarely speak to them, they only terrify them.
The third class is the &quot;
Ombwiri,&quot; plural &quot;Awiri.&quot;
The Awiri resemble the fauns, dryads, and forest spirits,
which live in rocks, trees, etc., and resent the trespass of
human beings on their land. The Ombwiri is regarded
as a guardian spirit, and each man has his own ombwiri,
for which he provides a small house near his own. The
Awiri are the only spirits which have no priesthood ;
they hold intercourse with men direct. They are kindly
disposed towards men, but religious services, which
really constitute an ancestral worship, must be performed in their honour. The fourth class is the &quot;
Sinkinda,&quot; and consists
chiefly of the spirits of people who were in a humble
position in this world, and were distinguished neither for greatness nor goodness. Besides these, the class
includes spirits, or perhaps demons, whom Njambi
(i.e., God) created, but to whom He never gave bodily
existence. Almost all Sinkinda are evilly disposed.



Spirits and the Spirit-world 153
One or more of them can enter into a human body, but sickness follows their coming ; they are never visible
to man. Sometimes they are called &quot;
Ivavi,&quot; i.e.,
&quot;
messengers,&quot; and they bring tidings, good or bad,
as the case may be ; a &quot; messenger
&quot;
gives his informa
tion by the mouth of some living member of the family,
whose body he is occupying temporarily. With such &quot; messengers
&quot; may be compared the messengers
\/n^K ^\
X
Jj! mentioned in the Book of the Dead.
In the XXIXth Chapter the deceased calls upon the
&quot; messenger of every god
&quot; to retreat, and he says :
&quot; Even though thou hast come to carry off my living
&quot;
heart-spirit, this living heart-spirit of mine shall not be
&quot; given to thee.&quot; And in the CXXVth Chapter1 we read of the &quot; messengers
&quot; which utter evil accusations,
and make calamities to happen.
A
fifth class of spirits, the &quot;
Myondi,&quot; are akin to
those of the fourth class, but appear to be less under the control of the witch-doctor than other spirits. They
cause sickness, and can help or harm men. They are
worshipped always in a deprecatory way. They some
times take possession of human bodies, and the Sinkinda,
Awiri, and Ilaga (spirits of foreigners) are invoked to
effect their expulsion. 2 Authorities differ in their definitions of the powers
and functions of the various classes of spirits, which are
very difficult to determine, but all agree that some spirits,
even those of the same class, are stronger and have
greater power for good or evil than others. The
powers of a spirit are limited : it cannot do everything.
Usually a spirit attends to a particular kind of work, but
it is thought that, on occasions, it may attempt to usurp
the functions of a spirit of another class. Every class
of spirits can be made helpers of man provided that they
are entreated with humility, and made friendly by means
1 Part III, 11. 1 6, 17. 2 Miss Kingsley refers to another class of spirits which resemble the
Lares and Penates of the Romans, and belong to the household, and descend by inheritance with the family. In their honour are secretly
kept a bundle of fingers, or other bones, nail-clippings, eyes, brains, etc.,
accumulated from deceased members of successive generations.
Travels in West Africa, p. 444.



154 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
of offerings. 1 The existence of a sixth class of spirits
is considered possible both by Dr. Nassau3 and
Miss Kingsley, 3 viz., those which enter the body of
some animal, generally the leopard, with a definite
purpose and for a limited time. This purpose is
generally the killing of some enemy, and as the strength
of the animal is directed by human intelligence and will, the spirit is enabled to carry out its evil design. Many
murders are committed in this way, as in the cases of
the German wehr-wolf and the French loup-garou.
Mr. Bonham Carter, the eminent Legal Secretary at
Khartum, shows that this belief was in operation in the
Sudan in 1903. One Kwat Wad Awaibung murdered
his neighbour Ajak Wad Deng, and, having pleaded
guilty, he said :
&quot; Ajak owed me a sheep and would not
&quot; pay me. He said he would show me some of his work,
&quot; and next day my son was eaten by a crocodile, which
&quot; was, of course, the work of Kwat, and for that reason
&quot;
I killed him. We had a feud for years, as I was
&quot; a more successful hippopotamus-hunter than he was,
&quot; and for that reason he was practising witchery over
11 me and my family.&quot; The explanation of the murder
is that Ajak believed that Kwat had sent his soul into
the crocodile, which made the animal lie in wait near the
river bank where Ajak s son usually bathed. When the
youth came down to the river and entered the water,
the crocodile obeyed its natural instinct, and dragged
him down and drowned him and ate him. Several witnesses supported Ajak s statement, and their evidence
proved that this belief was shared by the people
generally. 4
The Baluba believe in the existence of a great
number of evil spirits called &quot; Bashangi
&quot; or &quot;
Bakishi,&quot;
who are probably the disembodied souls of wicked
sorcerers. They wander about at night, appearing
sometimes as shooting stars. They terrify men and
scatter death among the villages ; their sole aim is to
injure, and their chief happiness is to make people

The Place of Departed Spirits 155
miserable. 1 A very large number of tribes in Africa believe firmly in the existence of a host of evil spirits, which
they generally identify with the souls of the dead. Some African peoples, e.g., those of Dahomey, have the
curious belief that the same spirit can be in more than
one place at the same time. Thus Gezu s spirit was
thought to be on his war-stool in his shed, and also in
his own tomb, at one and the same time. A spirit will
sometimes remain in Dead-land, and also come back to the earth in the body of a new-born infant ; all the
king s children were but the transmigrated spirits of the
old kings. 2
THE PLACE OF DEPARTED SPIRITS.
The Egyptians held several opinions about the
places to which spirits departed after the death of their
bodies. According to some they went and lived in the
bodies of animals and birds, others thought they entered
the stars and so lived in the sky, from which they could
visit the earth from time to time, and others believed that they lived in the Boat of the Sun. The greater
number, however, assumed that they went to a region
called Tuat, which was thought to be situated on th6
other side of the range of mountains that surrounded
the world. On the far side of the Tuat there was a similar range of mountains, and so we may say that
the Tuat had the form of a long valley, very much like
the Nile Valley ; it ran parallel to both ranges of
mountains and between them, and was on the same plane as the land of Egypt, or of the sky which was^f
above it. In the range of mountains which enclosed}
Egypt were two holes; from the one on the east the[
sun rose, in that on the west the sun set. The Tuat began near the western hole and ended near the eastern
hole ; thus it was nearly circular in form. It was shut
off from Egypt by mountains, and had neither sun, nor
moon, nor stars, therefore it was a region of gloom and
darkness and a place of fear and horror. A river flowed
through the Tuat Valley, just as the Nile flows through
1 Johnston, George Grenfell, Vol. II, p. 636. 2 Skertchley, Dahomey as It is, p. 465.



156 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
Egypt, and its banks were inhabited by the spirits who
had lived in the body in the various nomes of Egypt.
The Tuat Valley was divided into sections. Thus there
were the Tuat of Thebes, the Tuat of Abydos, the Tuat
of Herakleopolis, the Tuat of Memphis, and the Tuat
of Sais ; then, bending eastwards, there were the Tuat
of Bubastis, the Tuat of Heliopolis, the Tuat of Kher
aha, and so on. Each Tuat contained its own good and
evil spirits, who might be well disposed towards native
souls, but who were almost certain to be hostile to
stranger-souls that came from other parts of Egypt.
Thus the Tuat was a duplicate of Egypt, and the
dwellers in it were as various as the living inhabitants of
Egypt, but the spirits for the most part confined their
movements to their own section. The man who wished his soul after death to have the power of moving about
from one end of the Tuat to the other took care to make offerings to all the gods of all the Divisions of the Tuat
during his lifetime, for such acts of worship were
believed to secure for him their help both in this world
and in the next. Each Division of the Tuat contained a town which was the seat of the god who ruled it ; this
town was the equivalent of the metropolis of the nome
on earth.
The Egyptian theologians realized at a very early
period that the soul of a man would have great difficulty
in making its way through the Tuat, therefore they
compiled various books which they intended to form
Guides to that region of darkness and difficulty. The
oldest of these may be called the Book of the Two
Ways, and copies1 of it are found on the coffins of the
Middle Empire. According to this a man might go to
the abode of the blessed by two ways, by land or by
water, but once having set out on one route, the soul
could not change to the other ; for the two ways were
separated by a river of fire. Another Book, called
&quot;
Am-Tuat,&quot; 2 describes the journey of Ra through the
Tuat. It was intended to illustrate the power of Ra
over the kingdom of the dead, but incidentally it gives
a considerable amount of information about the Tuat.
1 See Schack, Zweiwegebuch^ Leipzig, 1903.
2 See my Egyptian Heaven and Hell^ Vol. I, London, 1905.



The Place of Departed Spirits 157
Ra, or rather the dead body of Ra, makes the journey
along the river of the Tuat in a boat, wherein is a crew
of gods ; each Division is supposed to represent one of
the hours of the night, and the goddess of each hour in
turn acts as the pilot. In the first hour Ra, or his flesh Af, travels through the first Division, a distance of
1 20 dtru, when he reaches the gods of the Tuat. The
Second and Third Divisions are each 309 (or 480) dtru
in length and 120 dtru in breadth. In the Third
Division the kingdom of Osiris is situated, and when
there Af is near Abydos. The Fourth and Fifth
Divisions reach from Abydos to Sakkarah, and include
the kingdom of Seker, the god of Death. At this stage
of the journey Af is obliged to leave his boat, for the
region is a waterless desert. The boat takes the form
of a serpent, and so is enabled to pass through the sand.
In the Sixth Division Af again uses his boat, and sails
to the city of Osiris, where this god was said to be
buried. In the Seventh Division, which is the secret abode of Osiris, the boat of Af is stranded because the river has run dry, and it is only moved along by means
of the magical words of I sis and Semsu (firstborn gods ?).
The failure of the water is caused by the serpent Apep,
who has drunk it up. This monster is called &quot;
Stinking
Face,&quot; Neha-her, and is 450 cubits long. Af does not
destroy him, but casts a spell on him and then passes
him by. The Eighth Division is a continuation of the
Seventh, and contains the Secret Circles of Ament ; it was situated near Busiris in the Delta. In the Ninth and Tenth Divisions the gods from the boat of Af assist in preparing the boat for the last stage of the journey.
In the Tenth Division Af finds the Beetle into which he is to transform himself, and in the Eleventh he sees the pits of fire in which the bodies, souls, shadows, and heads of the foes of Osiris are being burnt. In the
Twelfth Division the beetle is on the front of the boat&amp;gt; and when the boat has been dragged through the body
of a huge serpent 1,300 cubits long, entering at its tail
and coming out from its mouth, Af is found to have transformed himself into the beetle, i.e., into Khepera,
the morning sun. In the vignette to this Division we
see that the dead body of Ra is thrown aside in the
VOL. II. M



158 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
Tuat, and that, in the form of the solar disk, Khepera
enters his boat in the sky, and begins his journey across
heaven. As Ra, or rather Af, passed through the Tuat
he addressed words to all the beings who were on the
banks of the river in each division, and provided them
with food and drink. As he journeyed along he seems
to have brought light with him, and the gods rejoiced in
the temporary lightening of their darkness ; as he passed
on gloom once more settled down upon them, and the
blackness of night again covered them. Fortunate
indeed were the souls who were able to secure a passage
in the Boat of Af, for then they would have no reason
to fear the fiends on the river bank and the pits of fire.
The Book Am-Tuat was as useful to the living as to the
dead, and every picture in it was regarded as the symbol
of a magic power which was able to protect the body in
this world and the soul in the next.
A third work also was compiled by the priests as
a
&quot; Guide &quot; to the Tuat, viz., the Book of Gates. In it the Tuat is divided into twelve Divisions, each of which is guarded by a huge fortified Gate, and each Gate is
kept by warlike gods and fiery serpents. The kingdom
of Osiris occupies a prominent place in this work, and
we have in it representations of the Hall of Judgment
of this god, and the occupation of the blessed, and the
punishment of the wicked. From first to last the Book
of Gates1 represents the Tuat as conceived by the
indigenous Egyptians, and the ideas and beliefs expressed therein agree with those of
the Book of the Dead. These ideas and beliefs are purely African, and
they suggest that the Egyptian Tuat
was very much what the &quot; God s
Town &quot; or &quot; Njambi s Town &quot;
is to the African of to-day. They did not, I
believe, grow up in Eoypt, but in

the Tuat the soul was obliged to travel through a forest,
in which it was easy to lose the path. The Yoruba
&quot;babalawo&quot; (priest) to-day addresses the dead,
11 May the road be open &quot; to you . . . May you
&quot; find the road good when
&quot; you go in peace.&quot;
1 The road to the Tuat was so difficult to find, that unless the soul was conducted thither by the Wolf-god
Ap-uat, the probability of
its losing its way was very
great. At times the mantis
acted as guide, and in the LXXVIth Chapter of the
Book of the Dead the deceased says :
&quot;
I have come into &quot; the House of the king ; the mantis 2 led me hither . . .
&quot; I have made my way, and I have travelled thereon.&quot;
The Domain of the Tuat was, according to one
opinion, divided into seven parts, each of which was
guarded by a Gate ; each Gate had its keeper, its
watchman, and its herald. According to another view
the Gates were ten in number, and some papyri
enumerate fourteen or fifteen and some twenty-one.
To pass through them it was necessary for the souls of
the dead to know the names of the Gates and the names
of the beings who guarded them, in fact, to possess the
knowledge of a series of important words of power.
Yet another opinion was that the Kingdom of the Tuat

powers have been attributed by Africans, Arabs, and some European

&quot; which are held as are hands in prayer. These creatures wage

1 60 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
was divided into fourteen Aats (Domains), of which only
one was devoted to Osiris. One Aat was specially set
apart for the gods and another for the Spirits ; a third
was a region of fire, a fourth contained roaring torrents
of water, a fifth was the home of the Nile, a sixth was
the home of the Hippopotamus-goddess, and so on.
The Domain of Osiris was only one among many, but
to the Egyptian it was the most important of them all.
In it the god lived surrounded by his ministers and
followers like an African king on earth ; the former
directed the work of the servants of the god, and the
latter performed the duties which were assigned to them
in the fields wherein grew the Maat wheat, or the &quot; staff
of life.&quot; On this wheat Osiris and his followers lived. It was a form of Osiris himself, and those who ate it and lived upon it nourished themselves upon their god.
The ministers of Osiris formed the aristocracy of Sekhet
Aaru, and their occupations were the same as those of
an aristocracy on earth. The personal attendants of
Osiris, and his servants, and his field labourers, lived in much the same way as they lived upon earth. Groups
of souls belonging to the same family lived together,
and the friendships of earth were continued in the Tuat.
The souls of husbands and wives were reunited. There parents found their children again and rejoiced in their
love, and faithful household servants and slaves ministered to the souls of their masters and mistresses in the Tuat as they had ministered to them upon earth.
Many passages in the texts refer to the sexual union of
souls, but there is no mention of the begetting of off
spring. The population of the Tuat was recruited from
the souls who left this earth day by day. The duties
which souls performed for Osiris in nowise interfered
with the interest which they took in their kinsfolk who
lived on the earth, and they were able to watch their
affairs and, when necessary, to afford them protection.
This idea is well expressed in the following extract from
a text of the XVIIIth dynasty :
&quot; Thou makest a way through the mountains of Kher
neter. 1 &quot; Thou lookest upon thy house of the living,
1 The Other World.



The Place of Departed Spirits 161
&quot; Hearing the sound of singing and music in thy
hall on this earth. &quot;Thou workest protection for thy children for ever
and ever.&quot; 1
The connection between the souls of the living and
the dead was very close, and the belief in it permeated
every class in Egypt. If the Egyptians thought, like
the modern African, that some men contained souls which had been twice born, they would feel that they
had in their midst beings from the Other World, and
the influence of such in the affairs of daily life must have
been very great. Be this as it may, it is certain that
the worship of ancestral and other spirits was always
one of the most important factors in their religion, and
that the belief in the Tuat and its spirit-dwellers was a
fundamental feature of their spiritual constitution. The
&quot;
gods,&quot; e.g., Ra, Amen, Ptah, Khnemu, etc., were
beings to revere and propitiate when necessary, but none
of them ever really occupied in their minds the position
of Osiris, King and Judge of the dead. The priests of
Amen attempted to force their dogma of the sovereignty
of their god over the dead into the minds of the people,
but they failed, and the cult of Osiris flourished
centuries after they had passed away. The Tuat was an
indigenous African conception, and all its features and
characteristics were African, and Osiris its overlord ruled after the manner of an African king.
Under the IVth dynasty every man in Egypt
belonged to the king, every yard of ground was the
king s ; the king was Egypt, and Per-aa (Pharaoh),
the &quot; Great House,&quot; was the house in which all men lived. The king disposed of men s lives as he pleased,
and their bodies were only buried by his favour. The absolutism of the king of Egypt at that time is well
Urkunden^ IV, 1064.



1 62 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
illustrated by the views about kings and chiefs which
were current in Africa not many years ago. Among
the Manyema a subject shows his submission to a chief
by rubbing dust on his shoulders. 1 Baker says that
there was never a more supreme despot than Kamrasi.
Not only the property, but the families of his subjects
were at his disposal. He boasted that &quot;all belonged to
him.&quot; 2 Speke saw the subjects of Mtesa throw them
selves flat upon their bellies before him and cover their faces with earth ;
3 the same writer says that in Uganda
every man adores the king as a deity. 4 &quot; Uganda is
&quot;
personified by Mtesa, and no one can say he has seen
&quot; Uganda until he has been presented to the king.&quot;
5
To the king all territorial chiefs owe allegiance as over
lord. 6 Among the Barotse the people kneel before the
king, raise their hands high in the air, and cry out
&quot; Great king.&quot; Chiefs kneel down and pour water or
sand into their hands, and spread it over the king s
arms. Then they strike their heads on the ground,
and clapping their palms together sing his praises.
Personal freedom and personal property are alike non
existent. All the people are the slaves of the king. 7
In Shoa the king is absolute lord and master of the
land, and of the bodies and lives and possessions of all
his people. 8 The Basango regard their chief as a god,
and fear to say anything wrong lest he should hear
them. They fear both before him and when out of
sight. 9 In Dahomey the men touch the ground with
their heads and lips before the king. When a man
appears before the king he must cover his head and the
upper part of his body with dust, as much as to say,
&quot;
I am nothing but dirt before thee.&quot; 10 And every man
belongs to the king.

And thus it was with Osiris, Overlord of the Tuat.
Every soul in his kingdom belonged to him absolutely,
and drew its means of support from him. In the Book
Am-Tuat we see the god seated on his throne
watching the slaughter of those who have rebelled
against him ; their limbs are fettered, and then they are
dragged into the presence of the god and their heads
cut off. Treason to the mind of the African king is the
gravest of all offences, and is always punished by death,
which is usually accompanied by tortures, and thus was
treason punished in the Tuat. The headsman of Osiris
and his assistants in the Tuat were as busily occupied as are the executioners in the service of African kings at
the present day.
With the brief description of the Tuat and of the life
led by souls in it given in the preceding paragraphs we
may compare the accounts given by travellers of modern
African ideas about the Spirit-world. The Bahima
believe that the spirits of the dead go to Mitoma, and to
arrive there they have to enter the great Ankole forest,
and pass under German East Africa. The whiz and
hum of passing spirits
1 are frequently heard as they enter
the forest on their way to Mitoma. Good and bad go
there, but no slaves are admitted, for there is no work to do there. There are no cows there, and no clothing is
needed ; in fact, the beings there have no wants. The
spirits of white men cannot enter Mitoma. 2 The
Egyptians were not so exclusive, for their Tuat contained
the souls of the Aamu, i.e., the dwellers in the Eastern
Desert, the Libyans (Themehu) and the Negroes
(Nehesu). 3 According to Dr. Nassau the Spirit-world
is all around us, and does not differ much in its wants and characteristics from this earthly life, except that it
is free from some of the limitations of material bodies.
Spirits require food, but only its essence. They have
passions good and bad. They have wives, but there is
no procreation by spirits in the Other World. The
1 Among the Akikuyu they say :
&quot; You can hear the spirits ; they
come together from different places, and dance in the wilds and make
a noise. Spirits make a whirring sound, they do not say words.&quot; Routledge, With a Prehistoric People, p. 240. 2 Cunningham, Uganda, p. 23.

164 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
natives having no system of rewards or punishments
believe not in heaven or hell. All the dead go to
Njambi s Town, and live there together, the good with
the bad, as they lived together on earth. The hell
which some speak of is not a native conception, but is
probably the result of the teaching of Portuguese Roman
Catholic missionaries three hundred years ago. Departed
spirits (Musimo) never die, and they are to be feared
and driven away by noise. 1 The Akikuyu believe that
some spirits pass into animals, that others wander about,
and that some go to the Land of the Dead, Miiriniya
Mikongoi. This land is regarded as the residence of
the dead of bygone generations, and is a place from
which spirits cannot emerge, and is dark. They have
no god of evil, but there is a dwelling-place where live
a vast number of bad spirits, men, women, and children.
These possess many cattle, sheep, and goats. It is
terribly cold there, and its inhabitants have no clothes except a scrap of skin, the size of the palm of the hand,
which they place over their faces when they sleep. To
approach a fire is for them an absolute impossibility. 3
The Spirit-world of the Tshi-speaking peoples is
called &quot; Srahmanadzi.&quot; It resembles this world, and
like the Egyptian Tuat has towns, villages, forests,
mountains, rivers, etc. It is beneath the earth, and is
less bright than the world of the living. A proverb
says :
&quot; A corner in the world is better than the whole
of Srahmanadzi.&quot; When the sun sets in this world it
rises in Srahmanadzi. There the old become young,
a young man becomes a boy, and a boy a baby. They
grow and become old, but age brings no weakness or
wasting of the body. When they reach the prime of
life they remain in that condition, and never change.
A chief in this world is a chief there, and a slave a slave. Srahmanadzi is a duplicate of this world, and life there is only a continuation of the life here. It is this belief
which is at the bottom of the custom of killing wives
and slaves on the death of a king or chief, so that their
souls may depart to the Spirit-world and minister to his
wants there. This custom is not the result of a blood
1 Nassau, Fetichism in West Africa, pp. 56, 59, 62.

The Place of Departed Spirits 165
thirsty disposition, but arises from feelings of affection,
respect, and awe for the dead, and the desire that the
departed may suffer no inconvenience or lack comfort in
his new abode. 1 The entrance to the Tshi Other World is &quot;just east of the middle Volta, and the way
down is difficult to follow.&quot;3 The souls who arrive there do not cease to take an interest in mundane affairs, for
they not only have local palavers, but try palavers left
over from their earthly existence. And when there is
an outbreak of sickness in a Fanti town or village, and several inhabitants die off, the opinion is often held that
there is a big palaver going on down in Srahmanadzi,
and that the spirits are sending upon earth for witnesses,
subpoenaing them as it were. 3
The Other World of the I bo is much the same
as this, but it is full of gloom, for there is no day there.
The earth is similar, and there are in it forests, hills,
valleys, rivers, and roads leading from one town to
another, and houses and farms. Roads lead from this world to it, and on these souls travel to their final home. The land of the dead has no connection with the land which swallows up the sun, for it is dark, whilst the
place where the sun is is always light. The king, the ^
rich man, the poor man, the working man, and the
farmer will all be as they are here. Certain places are
set apart for the spirits of murderers, suicides, and men
of violence. Whether good or bad here, the man who
is properly buried will go to the land of spirits. Some\
souls are good and are well-doing, but those who belong )
to criminals and outcasts are regarded as demons. The
head of a house here will there have authority over the
fate of his own household, and it is necessary to be on
good terms with him ; this may be secured by gifts,
offerings, and sacrifices made to his soul. Negligence in
respect of such a soul will beget neglect on its part, and
may even render it hostile to the interests of its kinsfolk
on earth. 4 The souls in the Other World not only
converse with each other, but they have assemblies and

1 66 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
palavers in order to discuss the more public affairs of the
community, arguing, wrangling, and even quarrelling, as
they did in this world. Unlike humanity, however, they
keep their own counsel, and their quarrels to themselves.
As they neither speak of their affairs to human beings
nor give them counsel, they are inquisitors pure and
simple. Thus, the ancestor becomes the great spirit
inquisitor of his family, who can and does inflict injury
and evil upon it ; this belief is the root of the whole idea
of moral punishment. 1
According to the Yorubas the spirits of all the dead
go to Qrun, the heavens. It is divided into two parts ;
in one, the heaven of peace and happiness, live the souls
of the blessed, and in the other, which is called the &quot; world of potsherds,&quot; live the spirits of the wicked. 2
The Bantu believe that the spirits of the dead live in a dark forest, which is commonly spoken of as the
&quot;
forest&quot; or &quot; the land of the dead.&quot; 3 In Dahomey the
&quot; nidon &quot; or spirit goes to &quot; Kutomen &quot; or &quot;
Dead-land,&quot;
where there is neither reward nor punishment. The
king here is a king there, and every soul has the social
status which its body had on earth. Kutomen is, in
fact, a &quot; Swedenborgian reproduction of this world, and
&quot;it is placed under the earth. The departed often
&quot; returns to earth in the body of a child, and yet remains
&quot; in Dead-land an idea which some travellers have
&quot; confounded with metempsychosis.&quot;
41 The priests say
that life in the Other World is much the same as in
this, and that there are there wars, palavers, feasts,
dances, etc., as here. The clothes in which a man is buried accompany him to Kutomen. 5 The oldest idea
in Central Congo-land is that the spirits of the dead live
in a dark forest. Until recently the Congo tribes on the
coast believed that their dead went to a world at the bottom of the sea, and there spent their time as slaves
to the white man, making cloth and trade goods.
The Bayanzi think that the souls of the dead go to

the sky.
1 Some ancient Egyptians also held this view.
They thought that the sky was the floor of heaven, and
that it rested on two mountains, Bakha and Manu, which are the mountains of Sunrise and Sunset respectively.
Another view was that it rested on four pillars, which formed the four cardinal points and were held in position
by the four Sons of Horus. In the former case souls
made their way to one or other of the mountains, and
climbed to the top, and so stepped on to the crystal sky,
and then joined the souls who were already there. In the latter case the Egyptians thought that souls could
only reach the sky by means of a ladder. There is a
legend2 to the effect that Osiris only succeeded in getting
into the sky by means of a ladder which was provided
by Ra. Osiris was assisted to mount it by Ra and
Horus, or Set and Horus, each of whom pushed him up
with one finger. In the tombs of the Ancient and Middle Empires models of ladders have been found,
and it was believed that when deceased persons had
pronounced over them the appropriate words of power,
these models increased in length and strength, and
became actual ladders, and reared themselves up so that
they might mount them, and so ascend at will from their
graves to heaven. The ladder also appears in the Book
of the Dead, and the deceased says :
&quot;
I set up a ladder
among the gods,&quot;
3 and the &quot; Light-god hath made me
to be vigorous by the two sides of the ladder.&quot; 4 Else
where it is said :
&quot; He shall come forth upon your ladder
&quot; which Ra hath made for him, and Horus and Set
11 shall grasp him firmly by the hand.&quot; 5 Finally, when
men no longer placed models of ladders in tombs, the
priests provided for the necessity of the dead by painting
a ladder on papyri containing copies of the Book of the
Dead. 6 In connection with this belief in the ladder as a means of communication between heaven and earth, it is interesting to note that the Fernando Po people
think that at one time a ladder, &quot;like the one you get

palm-nuts with, only long, long,&quot; reached from earth to
heaven, so that the gods could come down and attend
personally to mundane affairs. One day a crippled boy
began to ascend it, and when he was a long way up his
mother saw him, and started in pursuit. The gods,
being horrified at the idea of the invasion of heaven by
boys and women, threw down the ladder, and have since
left humanity severely alone. 1 It is possible that the
idea of a ladder reaching from earth to heaven may have
drifted across Africa from the Christians in Abyssinia,
but it is hardly likely, and it is probable that it forms a
part of the tradition current all over West Africa that
there was once a time when a direct means of communi cation between gods and men existed upon earth.
1 Kingsley, Travels in West Africa^ p. 507.



CHAPTER XXI.
MAGIC (WITCHCRAFT), WHITE AND BLACK.
THE Egyptians, like the modern Africans, believed that
the government of this world was, practically speaking,
in the hands of a considerable number of &quot;gods&quot; and spirits, and that, in order to have success and happiness
here and hereafter, it was necessary to obtain their good
will and help. The performance of the duties and
ceremonies connected with the proper worship of
ancestral spirits was performed by a member of each
family, who in dynastic times was called the &quot;servant
of the KA,&quot; j/LJj and the direction of the worship due
to the local god was committed to the care of the
&quot;servant of the god,&quot; B
|. The chief of every large
village, or town, or district, usually attached to his service
a man who was believed to be able to hold communica tion with the spirits of the &quot;gods,&quot; and to have
influence with them, and also to possess powers of an
occult character with which, when necessary, he could
control, limit, or abrogate the action of evil spirits. In
many cases the chief, and even the king of the whole
country, must have owed his position to the influence
of this man and his assistants, who posed as interpreters
of the divine will, and the acts and policy of the chief
were often directed by them. The chief was supreme
in all temporal matters, and the man who possessed
occult powers was equally supreme in all spiritual
matters. The chief was in primitive times the strongest
and bravest man in the community, the most fearless
hunter, and the fiercest fighter, and was, in fact, the
embodiment of physical strength. The man of occult
powers was, on the other hand, the incarnation of intelli
gence, agility of mind, thought, cunning, shrewdness,
and foresight, and, when the Egyptians had acquired the
art of writing, he added to his other powers the ability



1 70 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
to read and write, and he possessed a thorough know
ledge of the sacred books. This condition of things
exists among the communities of West Africa at the
present day, for Sir Harry Johnston says that among
those where there has been no recent interference of the white man, and no conversion to Islam or Christianity,
there are two pillars of society the Chief (king, judge,
magistrate, leader in battle), and the Magician (sorcerer, medicine-man, priest, lawyer). Sometimes, but rarely,
the functions of the two are combined. Usually, the
chief leaves the laws, police, medicine, meteorology,
prophecy, and practical science of the tribe to a distinct functionary, the magician, the wise man, or woman, the
&quot;
Nganga&quot; of Bantu Africa.
The title of the man who possessed occult powers
and was recognized by the King of Egypt as the official
director of religious and magical ceremonies, was &quot; Kher
heb,&quot; fl\ v&, and his influence was very great and
far-reaching. He was well versed in the knowledge of
all the sacred books, he knew how to perform both
magic and religious ceremonies, and how and when to
recite spells with the proper tone of voice, he was able
to draft prayers, incantations, spells and magical formulae, he could foretell the future, explain auguries
and portents, interpret dreams, assign causes to illnesses,
and declare the name of the spirits of the dead which
caused them, he knew the great secret names of the
gods whereby they existed and maintained order in the
world, he knew how to cause death and to make the dead to live, to concoct potent medicines, to take the
form of anything animate or inanimate in earth, air,
water and sky, to render himself invisible at pleasure,
and to cast out devils. Such are the powers which the
literature of ancient Egypt ascribes to the Kher heb.
The use of these powers for a good purpose and with
the object of doing good to the living or the dead may
be described as White Magic, and the employment of
them with the view of doing harm or injury to anyone as
Black Magic.
The legitimate use of White Magic took place chiefly
in connection with the dead, and the Kher heb was held



Magic, White and Black 171
to be justified in using his powers to effect the preserva
tion of their bodies and souls, and to make the Spirit
soul to join the Spirit-body. The formulae which he
composed and recited protected the grave, and kept
away hostile beings, living and dead, from it, and
caused supplies of offerings, on which the KA and the
Heart-soul lived, to appear regularly and constantly in
the offerings-chamber. When written upon the walls of
tombs, coffins, sarcophagi, wooden boards, amulets, etc.,
they became &quot; words of power
&quot; of irresistible might, for
they transferred to them some part of the invisible and
almighty power which was believed to maintain life in
the gods, and to support all creation. The Kher heb
was the channel by which this mysterious and wonderful
power was made useful to man, and his most sacred
function was to act as mediator between the spirits of
gods and of the beatified and the living. He was himself a great amulet or charm, for at times the spirits
of the gods made his body a temporary abode, and all
that he did and said on such occasions was thought to be
inspired by divine beings and to have divine authority.
At such times he spoke as if he were indeed the god
who possessed him, and in addressing the evil spirit,
or crocodile, or serpent, or fiend, he bade him depart, or
fall helpless, or die because he was that god.
Thus in the Book of the Dead we have :
&quot; Get thee, &quot; back, crocodile Sui, for I live by the magical power (heka
&quot;
| LJ \ . My mouth hath power over the heka &quot;
(Chapter
XXXI). &quot;

In several of the magical texts which contain spells
reference is made to various calamities which befell the gods or goddesses, and the rubrics say that the
spells there written were the identical spells which
were recited to effect the deliverance or relief of the
injured deities. Thus Horus was stung by a scorpion,
but Isis, by the advice of Nephthys and Serqet,
prayed to Ra, who stopped his boat, and sent Thoth
to heal the child. Thoth came bearing with him
magical power (keka) obtained from Ra, and the poison
having been expelled from the body of Horus, the
suffering child recovered. If a person who was stung
by a scorpion would bear this story in mind, the poison
would leave his body, as it left the body of Horus. Or,
if anyone recited this story over a man stung by a
scorpion he would be healed. 1
1 This story is told on the Metternich Stele (ed. Golenischeff).



Magic, White and Black 173
Another great source of the magician s power was
the secret names of the gods, which he professed to
know. The existence of every god, and indeed of
every being, was bound up in his secret name, and he
who knew these names and how to utter them was their master. The importance of the name is well illustrated
by the following legend of Ra and Isis. 1 When Ra
reigned on earth as well as in heaven, Isis was seized
with the desire to know his secret name, which was the source of his life and sovereignty. She knew everything
except this name. Ra was old, and dribbled at the
mouth, and catching some of his spittle she kneaded it
with earth and made a serpent, which she placed on the
path of the god so that it might bite him when he passed
by. When Ra came along with the gods, this serpent
bit him, and as the poison flowed through his body he
suffered great pain, and was about to die. Then Isis
came and asked the god to tell her his secret name, but
though he enumerated many of his names, his great and
secret name was not among them. Meanwhile his
agony increased, and when his body became filled with
the fire of the poison, and he was unable any longer to
bear it, he promised that his secret name should be
transferred to Isis ; this apparently took place, for Ra
recovered, but what the name was we do not know.
The knowledge of names plays a very prominent part
in the Book of the Dead. Thus, to be acquitted in the
Judgment Hall of Osiris, it was necessary for the
deceased to know the names of the Two-and- Forty
gods who were there. To obtain a passage in the magic
boat (Chapter XCIX) it was necessary for him to know
the secret name of every part of it, and to be able to
utter them correctly. To pass through the Seven Halls
and the Pylons of the Kingdom of Osiris he had to
know not only their names, but also the names of their
Porters, Watchers, and Heralds (Chapters CXLIV
CXLVIII). Before he could escape from the net of
the catcher of souls he was obliged to know and declare
the names of every part of it (Chapter CLIIlA). As
specimens of magical names may be quoted the follow

we have the following words of power :

In a spell in the same papyrus we read :
&quot;
I am the &quot; chosen one of millions of years, who cometh out of the
&quot; Tuat, whose name is unknown.&quot; If this name be
&quot; cut &quot;
(i.e., uttered) on the river bank, it will slice it
away ; and if it be cut on the ground a fire will break
out. The power of this spell was very great. If a man
repeated it four times, 1 and held in his hand at the same
time a drawing of the Eye of the Sun with a figure of
An- Her in it, the earth would collapse into the celestial
j
ocean, and the South would become the North. A man j who knew the next spell in the papyrus became like one :
who had seventy-seven eyes and seventy-seven ears

(Column VII). The most remarkable use of the name
of a god as a word of power is related in the Book of
Overthrowing Apep (British Museum, No. 10,188). In
this the god Tern describes how he created the world |
and all the generations thereof. There was a time, he
[
says, when no one and nothing existed except himself,
j
A desire came over him to create the world, and he
carried it into effect by making his mouth utter his own
name as a word of power, and straightway the world !
and all therein came into being. 2 The things which came

Magic, White and Black 175
into being as the result of the utterance of the secret
name of Temu contained some of the power of that
name, which existed henceforward in the secret names
; which they possessed. What the secret name of Tern
really was the papyrus does not say, but it is quite clear
that the Egyptians thought that heaven, earth, and the
Other World, and every being and thing which were in
them, existed by virtue of it. To possess the knowledge
of the secret names of God, and those of the gods, and
of things animate and inanimate, was the magician s
1 chief object in life, and his desire to acquire it is easy to
understand ; for, according to the belief of the period, it
made him master of all the powers in this world.
The power of the spell, or incantation, or of any
word of power, was greatly increased by the use of
magical pictures and amulets which contained either
a portion of heka power, or an indwelling spirit. Thus,
if a certain kind of wreath was laid on the face of a dead person, and the Kher heb recited the words of
power which formed the XlXth Chapter of the Book
of the Dead, whilst incense was 1
being burnt, that dead
person would never lack food, and would always over
come his enemies. The fumes of the incense rising
1 heavenwards was supposed to bear the words of power
with them to Osiris, who heard them and did as the petitioner desired. Again, to cause the spirit of the dead
man to have power like Osiris in the Other World, it
was necessary to perform elaborate ceremonies and to
use amulets, as well as to recite four potent spells. Four
i lamps, with wicks made of dtmd cloth which had been
steeped in Libyan unguent (hatet\ were kindled, and
these were held in the hands of four men, each of whom
had written on his shoulder the name of one of the Four Sons of Horus. Four troughs were made of earth on
which incense had been sprinkled, and these were filled
with the milk of a white cow. After the lamps had
been burning for a time in the sun-light, they were
, Col. XXVIII, 1. 22.
N



176 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
quenched, each in one of the troughs of milk. The
performance of this ceremony was to be witnessed by
none save a man, or his father, or his son. A tet of
crystal, a figure of Anubis, a figure of a mummy, and
the model of a palm tree, seven cubits in height, each
mounted on a small mud brick inscribed with its own
spell, were then placed in the east, west, north, and
south walls of the tomb respectively, and the text of the
CXXXVIIth Chapter of the Book of the Dead was
recited. How the power of these amulets worked, and
what exactly the ceremonies were supposed to do we
know not, but the general evidence of the Chapter itself
suggests that they made the soul of the dead man to
ascend into heaven in the form of Osiris or Ra. The Rubric says that the figure of the mummy is to be
smeared with bitumen and set fire to, and we may
assume that, as the body of the deceased is thus burned
symbolically, his spirit rises in the flame, and mingles
with the flames of the four sacred lamps of the Four
Sons of Horus, and is thus united to the soul of Osiris, which, it seems, sometimes took the form of a flame of fire. These ceremonies are said to be &quot;an exceedingly
&quot;
great mystery of Amentet, and a type of the hidden
&quot;
things of the Other World.&quot; More than once the Rubrics order that such ceremonies as these are not to be witnessed by the &quot; dwellers in the papyrus swamps,&quot;
i.e., the fen-men of the Delta, who were also not to be allowed to know the texts which related to them, or even
to see copies of them (Chapters CLXI and CXC).
The Rubrics to the magical texts make clear another
very important fact in connection with the working of
magical ceremonies and the reciting of spells by the
Kher heb, viz., that before undertaking anything of the
kind he must make himself ceremonially pure. The
things described in the Rubrics to Chapter CXXXVII
were ordered to &quot; be performed by a man who is washe&amp;lt;
&quot; clean and is ceremonially pure, one who has neithei
&quot; eaten meat nor fish recently, and has not had inter
&quot; course with women.&quot; The famous Judgment Chaptei
was to be recited &quot; by a man who was washed clean and
&quot;
purified, who was clad in linen garments, and was shod
&quot; with white leather sandals ; his eyes must be painted



Magic, White and Black 177
&quot; with antimony, and his body anointed with anti &quot; unguent
&quot;
(Chapter CXXV). The spiritual faculties of
the magician were rendered more keen by abstention
from carnal pleasures, and the words of the man who was
clean &quot; within and without, before and behind,&quot; were believed to possess greater power, and to be followed
more quickly by the desired effect, than those of him to
whom personal cleanliness was of small account. The
higher the degree of cleanliness of his mind and body,
the greater was the influence of the magician over the
spirits whom he summoned to help him. The White
Magic of the Egyptians, notwithstanding the ceremonies
and spells, and figures and amulets, which were
associated with it, was sanctified by the chief object for
which it was employed, namely, the resurrection of the
Spirit-body and the rejoining of the Spirit-soul to it in the
kingdom of Osiris. Besides this, it was used to heal
sicknesses and to drive out devils and evil spirits from
suffering humanity, and the general trend of its influence
was for good. In every important event in the life of
the Egyptian, from his cradle to his grave, White Magic
played a prominent part. It brought to him at his birth
good spirits, who watched over him and protected him,
it gave him amulets which brought the living power of
his gods to his body as he grew up, it provided
beneficent spells which guarded his wife and children,
and house, and farm, and animals, and other possessions,
its precepts led him to worship his ancestral spirits and
gods, and when he died its rites and ceremonies were
employed to secure the admission of his soul into the
kingdom of spirits.
There were, however, in Egypt many men who
professed the art of Black Magic, the object of which
was to do harm. In their hands the powers of magic
were generally misused, and disastrous results, if we may
believe the papyri, were the consequence. One of the
commonest ways of working evil was by means of the
wax figure. A man employed a magician to make in
wax a figure of his enemy, whose name was cut or
written upon it, and then to work magic upon it by
reciting spells over it. If the spells contained curses,
they were supposed to take effect upon the living man ;



178 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
and if the figure were stabbed, or gashes made in it with
a knife, the living man suffered terrible pain, or wounds
appeared in his body. If the figure were destroyed by
fire or by any other means, the death of the living man
ensued. The Westcar Papyrus tells us that the wife of
one Aba-aner committed adultery in his garden with one
of his servants. When the news of this was brought
to him, he made a model of a crocodile in wax, and told his servant to go and place it in the river at the spot
where his guilty wife s paramour was in the habit of
bathing. As soon as this man entered the water on the
following day, the wax crocodile turned into a huge
living crocodile, which quickly devoured him. The
Rollin Papyrus states that certain evil men succeeded in
stealing a book of magic from the Royal Library, and that by following the directions contained in it they
succeeded in making wax figures, on which they worked
magic with the view of injuring or killing the king of
Egypt. This was held to be treason in the first degree,
and the malefactors seem to have suffered the death penalty. The use of the wax figure was not disdained
by the priests of Amen-Ra at Thebes, for they regularly
burnt a wax figure of the fiend Apep, who daily endea
voured to prevent the sun from rising. This figure was
in the form of a serpent of many folds, on which the
name Apep was written or cut. A case made of papyrus
inscribed with spells containing curses was prepared, and,
the wax serpent having been placed inside it, both case
and figure were cast into a fire made of a special kind of
plant. Whilst they were burning the priest recited
curses, and stamped upon them with his left foot until
they were rendered shapeless and were finally destroyed.
This magical ceremony was believed to be very helpful
to Ra, the Sun-god, who uttered over the real Apep
spells which paralysed him, and then killed him by the
fiery darts of his rays, and consumed him. Further information about the powers said to be
possessed by Egyptian magicians is given by the
Westcar Papyrus. Thus in the reign of Seneferu one
Tchatcha-em-ankh divided the water of a lake into two
parts, and placed one part upon the other, in order to
allow a singing woman, who was rowing the royal boat



Magic, White and Black 179
with the king in it, to recover a jewel which had dropped
from her into the water as she rowed and sang. Another
magician, called Teti, who lived in the reign of Khufu,
could make a lion follow him without leading him by a
rope, and knew certain mysteries connected with the
sanctuary of Thoth, and could rejoin the head of a man
to his body after it had been cut off, and make him live
again. He was brought into Khufu s presence by Prince
Herutataf, and the king commanded that a prisoner
should be given to him, so that he might exhibit a proof
of his magical powers before His Majesty. Teti, how
ever, suggested that some animal should be substituted
for the prisoner, and a goose was brought in. Having
cut off its head, he placed the head and the body in
different parts of the room, the former on the west side
and the latter on the east. He then uttered words of power, and the head and the body began to move towards
each other ; when they came close together, the head
leapt back to its place on its body, and the bird quacked.
Another kind of bird was treated in the same way, and
its head rejoined its body as in the case of the goose.
An ox was then brought and its head was cut off, and
the words of power of Teti caused it to rejoin its body.
As the worker of White Magic used the hidden
names of gods and good spirits as words of power, so the v
sorcerer used the hidden names of devils and fiends as
spells which produced evil. The knowledge of these
names made him master of the devils who entered the bodies of the living and produced diseases of every kind,
and who unhesitatingly performed his commands. The
names of Set and his fiends could be made to produce
thunder, lightning, storm, cold, famine, pestilence, and
death. The use of the names of the spirits of poisonous
plants enabled him to concoct deadly poisons, and
decoctions made from parts of savage animals and
venomous reptiles, and liquid from dead human bodies,
formed ingredients in his baleful &quot;medicine.&quot; Like the
modern fortune-teller, he professed to read the future,
and a complete calendar of the lucky and unlucky days of
the year, of which we have one complete copy 1 and one
1 See Budge, Egyptian Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum^
Plates XXXI and XXXII.



180 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
incomplete, 1 enabled him to declare what day, and what
part of it, would be propitious for undertaking any proposed
work. He professed to be able to hold intercourse with
the spirits of the dead, and to have an intimate acquaint
ance with all that took place in the Other World. Thus
in the Second Tale of Kha-em-uas2 we read how one Setme went into the Tuat, and having passed through
its various halls he saw Osiris seated in judgment, with
Anubis on his left hand and Thoth on his right, whilst
the Assessors were on both sides of him. He saw the Balance standing there, and learned that the men whose
good deeds exceeded their evil deeds entered among the
lords of Amentet, whilst their souls went to heaven. Those whose evil deeds exceeded their good deeds were
delivered to the Devourer, and their souls and bodies were destroyed for ever. This same tale describes the
magical powers which were possessed by Setme s son,
Sa-Asar. Thus he could read books without opening
them, and he told the king the contents of a letter which
an Ethiopian had brought to him. The magician Hor
made a model in wax of a litter for four bearers, and,
having pronounced a spell over it, ordered it to go to the
Sudan and bring back the Viceroy, so that he might be
beaten with 500 stripes, and to return in six hours ; and
it is related that the litter did so. 3 During a contest
between this same Hor and an Ethiopian magician, the
Ethiopian caused fire to appear in the palace ; in reply
Hor recited a spell, and a shower of rain came and put
out the fire. The Ethiopian then caused the heavens to
become black, so that no man could see his neighbour,
whereupon Hor recited a spell and made the darkness to
pass away. Then the Ethiopian made a huge vault of
stone, 200 cubits long and 50 cubits broad, to be above
the heads of Pharaoh and his princes, and it threatened
to crash down and kill them all ; when the king and his
people saw this they uttered piercing shrieks. Hor, how
ever, uttered a spell, which caused a great phantom boat,
apparently made of papyrus, to come into being, and he
made it carry the stone vault away to the Great Water
of Egypt (Lake Moeris).

Magic, White and Black 181
From the works of Greek writers of the GraecoRoman Period we know that Egyptian sorcerers at that
time were supposed to be able to send terrifying dreams
to men and women, to steal the mind and senses from a man, to rob the lover of his beloved s love, to alienate a
wife s affections from her husband, to fill men and women with longings for illicit love, to cause sickness and death,
to raise the dead, to take the forms of animals, birds, reptiles, etc., to make themselves invisible, to involve
men in loss or ruin, to control the powers of heaven and
earth, etc. There is nothing strange in this, for powers
to perform all these things were claimed by ancient
Egyptian magicians. In the Ptolemaic Period, magicians
began to cast nativities and to make horoscopes, and to
claim the power of explaining the alleged influences of
the Seven Planets, and the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac,
and the Thirty-six Dekans, on the lives of men.
Nectanebus, the last native king of Egypt, was reputed
to be the greatest of magicians, for he knew what was in
the depths of the Nile and the sea, he could work the
astrolabe, read the stars, cast nativities, foretell the destinies of men, and he slew his enemies by sea and by
land by the use of words of power and mighty names and
wax figures. He made wax models of ships and their
crews, and of regiments of soldiers, some representing
those of his own country and others those of the enemy,
and setting them face to face he recited over them his
words of power. The figures of the soldiers or sailors,
as the case might be, then began to fight, and as the wax
figures of his troops slew and routed those of their oppo
nents, his living enemies were destroyed. One day his
words of power failed to produce their customary effect,
and, realizing that the gods of Egypt had forsaken him,
he collected all the money he could carry and fled by ship
to Macedon, where by magical means he seduced
Olympias, and became, according to Pseudo-Callisthenes,
the father of Alexander the Great. He went to the fields and collected a number of plants which possessed
magical properties, and, having pounded them and
squeezed out their juice, he made a figure of Olympias,
and wrote her name upon it ; he then poured the juice
of the plants over it and laid it down in the attitude of



1 82 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
sleep by the fire. Nectanebus recited spells and names
over the figure, and the result of these was to cause
Olympias to dream that a spirit called Amen came to
her and was united with her, and that she conceived a man-child by him. ^ Shortly after this Nectanebus
disguised himself as Amen and went to the queen s
chamber, and, believing him to be the god who had
appeared to her in her dream, she admitted him to her
embrace. 1 The Egyptian Christians were nearly as much
addicted to the use of magic as their &quot; pagan
&quot; ancestors.
With them the Cross took the place of the ankh ,
and its name became a word of power. The sign of the
Cross terrified the devil, drove away fiends, and healed
the sick, and the Name of Christ possessed untold
power. The Devil fled before it &quot; like a sparrow before
a hawk,&quot; and a hippopotamus which ravaged the crops,
being adjured by it to depart, ceased to do harm, and
departed and was no more seen. The Christian Fathers asserted that even laymen might drive away devils by
the Name of Christ and the Sign of the Cross.
Macarius, by the sprinkling of holy water, restored to
her human form a woman who had been transformed into a mare. Paul the Simple cast out from a man
a devil, who took the form of &quot; a mighty dragon seventy
cubits long.&quot; The monk Apollo cast spells upon certain
priests and people who were worshipping an image, and
they remained powerless to move under a blazing sun,
until he prayed over them and removed the spell. A
friend of this Apollo called Ammon appealed to Christ
to destroy a serpent, and as soon as the reptile heard
this name it burst asunder. Bessarion walked on the water, and made the sun to stand still. Petarpemotis
made a dead man to speak, and walked upon the water,
and entered into a chamber where the brethren were &quot; in the air by the power of the angels,&quot; and visited Paradise
and saw the saints, and brought back figs therefrom.
When the people mixed the sand which he had blessed
with the sterile soil in their land, crops grew straightway

which were larger and more abundant than those of any
other part of Egypt. 1
With the description of the alleged powers of ancient
Egyptian magicians set forth in the previous pages, we
may now compare the statements made by various
travellers about the medicine-men and witch-doctors and their doings in Central and Western Africa in recent years. According to Schweinfurth, the creed of the
Dinkas centres in an institution called &quot;Cogyoor,&quot; which embraces a society of necromancers and jugglers by
profession. They are expert conjurers and ventriloquists,
and are familiar with the ghosts of the dead. 2 The
Matabele recognize two kinds of witchcraft. One kind
includes the &quot; making of medicine&quot; to cause rain and the
performance of ceremonies to appease the spirits of
ancestors. The other kind consists of evil practices
which were supposed to cause sickness and death. 3 If
a man wants to cause his enemy to be speared, he makes
a clay figure, which is supposed to represent him, and
pierces it with a pin. Anyone can be bewitched by
spreading medicine on his path or in his hut. He who
possesses the liver and entrails of a crocodile can cause
the death of anyone he pleases. There are two kinds of
witch-doctors. One kind works his magic by throwing
three bones, and watching the positions in which they
fall ; the other kind chants his spells and oracles in a shrill voice. Both kinds hold intercourse with the spirits of the dead. The blood and gall of a black ox
were used by the witch-doctors in the charm for making
rain. 4 Among the Bongo many of the chiefs are
magicians, or medicine-men, and they owe much of their influence over their peoples to the fact that they are
believed to possess power over the spirits of the dead, all
of whom are supposed to be capable of doing mischief.
As the Bongo have no belief in the existence of good
spirits it follows that the only magic they know is Black
Magic. The Bongo medicine-man holds communication

184 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
with spirits by means of certain roots, decoctions and
preparations of which are used to do harm to living
persons. 1 Among the Baganda each tribe or clan has its
own Muchwezi, or sorcerer (i.e., medicine-man, or witch
doctor), who conducts the worship of ancestral spirits.
There are, however, besides many doctors in white or
black magic. 3 The men who attend to the worship of
the various gods and ancestral spirits were termed
&quot; Bamandwa.&quot; They were also diviners, and were able
by superstitious means to answer questions as if they
were oracles. The Mandwa would listen to the question,
and having made the sign of the cross with a strip of
leather on which were sewn nine kauri shells (called
&quot; Engato &quot;), and flung this object before him, would
answer it as one inspired. The priests of Mukasa, the
god of Lake Victoria, carried a paddle as an emblem of
their office, 3 just as do twelve of the gods in the pictures
in the Egyptian Books of the Other World. 4 In
Kavirondo witchcraft is of two kinds, &quot;
obufira,&quot;
i.e., white magic, or the use of hypnotism and divination
for innocent purposes ; and &quot;
obulugo,&quot; which is little
else than killing people by poison, or fright.
5 Their witch-doctors are great experts in the lore of omens
derived from the appearance of the entrails of sheep.
Besides ancestral spirits two gods are worshipped by the
Ba- Kavirondo : Awafwa, the god of good spirits, and
Ishishemi, a sort of devil. 6 The right side is lucky and
the left unlucky, 7 as in ancient Egypt. The witch
doctors among the Basoga of the island of Bavuma
recognize two classes of spirits, one good8 and the other
bad, 9 and each spirit has its own priest. They are

worshipped by offerings which are placed for them in
&quot; fetish huts.&quot; Among the Jalas there exists a kind of
magic called &quot;
Jamkingo,&quot; which is practised by a sort of
secret society, and which means to all intents and
purposes secret poisoning. Among the Gemi tribe the
magicians are blacksmiths, which fact calls to mind the blacksmiths 1
(mesentili), or metal workers, who assisted
Horus in performing the ceremonies connected with the resurrection of Osiris. The Juju2 priests of New Calabar were said to be
able, by their devilish arts, to change a man s face and
appearance to such a degree that his mother would not
recognize him ; to cause a tree on the river banks to
bend its trunk and lower the topmost branches so that
they could absorb water from the river ; to take upon
themselves the form of birds and fly away, and to be
able to disappear at pleasure. 3 When the Juju priest
performed a ceremony of great importance he wore
nothing but &quot; a superb dark-coloured and greasy-looking
&quot;
rag about his loins, barely sufficient to satisfy the
&quot;
easiest-going of European Lord Chamberlains.&quot;4 This
also was the case with the Kher heb magician in ancient
Egypt, for when performing certain of the ceremonies
connected with the &quot; Opening of the Mouth &quot; he wore
nothing but a loin cloth. 5
Among the Masai all medicine-men belong to the
Kidongi family of the Aiser clan, and they are descended
from Ol-Oimooja, or E-Sigiriaishi, the sons of Ol-le
Mweiya. They have four methods of divining : (i) By
a buffalo or ox horn and a handful of stones. (2) By
examining the entrails of a goat. (3) By getting drunk
and prophesying. (4) By dreams. 6 Among the Nandi
the Orkoiyot or principal medicine-man is chief of the

whole race. His methods of divining are similar to
those of the Ol-oiboni, or medicine-man of the Masai.
He can interpret omens and avert ill luck. He tells the
people when to plant their crops, he obtains rain for
them, he makes women and cattle fruitful, and the success of a war or raid depends on his approval. His
approval is shown when he gives one of the leaders a
club which has been smeared with a concoction called setanik, and this club is carried in front of the party.
The person of the Orkoiyot is absolutely sacred. No
one may approach him with weapons in his hand, or
speak in his presence unless first addressed ; his head
must never be touched, lest his powers of divination
depart from him. He is thought to be able to detach
his head from his body, and to send it to watch his
troops wherever they may be engaged in fighting. He
never prays to Asista, but only to the spirits of his deceased ancestors. Besides the Orkoiyot there are
two classes of lesser medicine-men, one of whom is
called Kipsakeiyot, and the other Kipungut. The
magicians bewitch people by &quot;
catching
&quot; their foot
prints, or by means of portions of their clothing which
they have worn, or a bead, or by their hair, nail parings,
teeth, spittle, or anything which has fallen from their
bodies. The rain-makers cause rain by soaking the
root kiptakchat in water. 1
Among the Gallas the magician or medicine-man
has great power, and is called &quot;
ogessa,&quot; i.e., &quot;learned
man,&quot; or &quot; doctor of the book.&quot;2
The position and authority of the magician in
Western Africa is well summarized by Wilson, who
says that the person who has a knowledge of witchcraft
is supposed to possess little less than omnipotence. He
is master of the lives and destinies of his fellow men, and of sea and land, and of the elemental forces of
nature, and of the wild beasts of the earth. He can
change himself into a tiger, elephant, shark, etc., and
withhold rain, and fill the land with want and distress
and pestilence. He can cause sickness, poverty, insanity,
and death. The art of witchcraft may be exerted with

Magic, White and Black 187
or without any material agency ; the wish and the word
of the magician can perform anything. No one knows
the source of his power ; some suppose that it is derived
from the spirits, and others believe that he obtains it by
eating the leaves or roots of a forest tree. 1
The art of the magician, or medicine-man, or witch doctor, is employed by the natives in every event of
life, and is used publicly and privately. Before Mtesa
went to war the priests of the Musimu, or evil spirits,
about one hundred in number, used to bring the war
charms for him to touch with his forefinger. These
charms consisted of dead lizards, bits of wood, hide, nails of dead people, claws of animals, beaks of birds, with
compounds of herbs and leaves carefully placed in
vessels ornamented with beads. During the fight these
magicians chant spells, and exhibit their &quot; medicines &quot; to
the foe, and their associates shake large numbers of
gourds filled with pebbles, and create an awful din. 2 Among the Garenganze in South-east Africa the side
that is beaten at once acknowledges that the medicines
of the enemy are stronger than their own. 3 The war
fetish of the Batanga is a spear with prongs, which is
thrust into the head of a dead man, which is afterwards cut off from its body, and carried to the house of the
medicine-man. Whilst the man does this he must be naked. The spear is then boiled in a pot with some of
the blood of a cock, and several magic ingredients,
including the human head, and the warriors are sprinkled
with some of the water from the pot. A mess composed
of cock s blood, red-wood, a cock, oil, gourd seeds,
plantains, etc., is then cooked in the pot, and the
medicine-man and the warriors eat it. The warriors are
sponged on their breasts, and are then ready to fight,
feeling assured of victory. The spear is, presumably,
carried before them as they march. 4
Before going hunting the members of the party would
fetch a medicine-man, who put the fat of zebra, eland,
and other game, mixed with dirt, in a pot. Hot coals

1 88 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
were then placed on the fat, and clouds of dense smoke
arose. Into this the men thrust the muzzles of their rifles through the smoke, and sniffing the smoke each
called on the hunting spirit Saru, saying,
&quot; Saru, I must
kill game.&quot; The medicine-man next placed a bowl of
the &quot; medicine &quot; water on the hunter s head, and whilst the latter repeated the names of the animals he wished to kill, the former stirred the water. If the water splashed over and ran down on the hunter s face success
was assured to him ; if none left the bowl he might as
well go home. Among the Matabele the medicine
man made a mark with medicine water on the forehead of each hunter, and this gave him authority over the
beasts. When going on a journey a travelling fetish is
prepared. This is a spear with roots of a sweet herb
tied round the blade. Wood splinters are then tied to it in such a way that they form a little cage, and in this
are placed a bit of human skin, bits of the claws of a lion
or leopard, food, beer, and magical roots. A cloth is
sewn over the cage, and when the king has spit on it
and blessed it, the spear is ready to be carried before
the caravan. The human skin gives power, the claws
of the animals protect from claws, the food and beer
secure a supply of meat and drink, and the roots and the king s spittle give health to the party. 1 Success in
trade is obtained by mixing with water the brains of a
dead man who was wise, and rubbing the mixture on
the face ; brains mixed with oil are also rubbed on the hands. Another trade medicine is made by putting into
an antelope s horn the ashes of the skin of a flying fox,
the leaves of the kota tree, the nail from a human finger, the tip of the tongue, menstrual fluid, red-wood powder,
and the tail feathers of the kilinga bird. The mouth of
the horn is closed with gum, but the feathers are allowed
to project through the gum. When about to trade the
owner of the horn secretly pulls out a feather, and rubs
a little of the liquid from the horn on the tip of his nose. 3
The native merchant who is in a hurry to get rich some
times employs the Okundu medicine, which is of a very
terrible character. The merchant or his witch-doctor

Magic, White and Black 189
kills someone in order that his spirit may be set free to
go and use its influence on the merchant s behalf with
the white men with whom he is about to trade. 1 Modern Africans of all kinds, like the ancient Egyptians, firmly believed that every sickness and disease
were caused by some evil spirit, either as a punishment
for some neglect or insult to it on the part of the stricken
man, or as the result of the machinations of some witch doctor. Dr. Nassau distinguishes three kinds of disease
causing spirits, viz., the Nikinda, Ombwiri, and Olaga.
The first are supposed to be the spirits of the dead who
were undistinguished when living, the second the spirits
of kings, chiefs, nobles, etc., and the third the spirits who
had been raised to the rank of angels in the Spirit-world.
In treating the diseases supposed to be caused by these
spirits the medicine-man tries to find out from the patient
which kind of spirit it is who is vexing him, and when he
has satisfied himself on this point he proceeds to concoct
medicine from the herbs and roots which are suitable. The three classes of spirits mentioned above are probably
the equivalents of the three classes of beings mentioned
in the Egyptian texts, viz., the henmemet, pat, and rekkit*
These, apparently, all lived in heaven, but whether the
Egyptian associated them with causation of disease
cannot be said.
The making of love-philtres is a very common
occupation of the witch-doctor, to whom both men and
women apply for means whereby they may enjoy the love
of some particular person. Many men and women make
their own love-philtres, and the essential in most of them
is some portion of the body of the woman or man, from
which when mixed with herbs a decoction is made, to be administered in some form or other to the person whose
love is wished for. 3 Sir Harry Johnston has given us a
number of most interesting facts about the witch-doctor s
methods in various parts of Africa. The Baluba
magicians say they can make themselves invisible by
means of certain charms, and once invisible they indulge

i go Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
in horrible &quot;ghoulish practices or in disgusting im
moralities.&quot; The magician fills the body of the large
Goliath beetle, or a small horn, with small human
knuckle-bones, and scrapings of red camwood. He puts
this in his mouth and becomes invisible. He then fills a
Tragelaphus horn with magic ingredients, and encloses
this in the very long pod of the Kigelia tree. He covers
the beetle or small horn with charcoal paste, as he utters
his spell, and then ties the pod up in cloth. He then
buries the magic horn in a hole dug in front of the door
of the man whom he wants to bewitch, fills the hole up, and covers it with twigs. Immediately the inmate of the
house on going out touches one of the twigs, his leg
contracts, his sinews shrivel, and he falls back dying on
his mat. Or the magician takes straws from the house
and path of the victim, and throws them into his supply of water ; as the water evaporates the victim pines away.
Or he takes grass from under the tree which has often
sheltered his victim, and binding it in small bundles
hangs them up in his house ; when these are dry his
enemy is dead. Or he makes a wooden figure of his
victim, cuts it in pieces, which he throws one by one into
boiling water ; when the last is thrown in the man is
dead. The Baluba magician also asserts that he can
steal a man s personality from him, and the natives are
fully convinced that their souls can be stolen from them. 1
This belief was common among the ancient Egyptians, as
we have already shown. Magicians in all parts of Africa
profess to be able to drive out spirits from those possessed,
and their operations are everywhere characterized by
noise, dancing, singing, drumming, and feasting. The
story of the casting out of an evil spirit from the daughter
of the chief of Bekhten by the priests of Khensu proves
that the ancient Egyptian priest pretended to possess the
same powers as the modern African witch-doctor.
The wide-spread belief that almost every death is
caused by witchcraft gives to the medicine-man or witch
doctor a power over his fellow creatures which is well-nigh
absolute, for he can accuse any man he likes of causing
the death of another, and the accused person is forthwith
put to death, unless he is willing to undergo the &quot; ordeal

Magic, White and Black 191
of the red-water.&quot; The &quot; red-water &quot;
is a decoction of the inner bark of a large forest tree of the mimosa family ;
it is reddish in colour, and has an astringent taste, and
analysis shows that it is both an astringent and a narcotic,
and, when taken in large quantities, an emetic. The accused, with a cord of palm leaves only about his waist,
sits near the pots containing the red-water, and all the
people gather round about and form a circle. After his
accusation has been pronounced, he makes a formal
acknowledgment of all the evil deeds of his past life and,
invoking the name of God three times, calls down His
wrath upon himself if he is guilty of the crime laid to his
charge. He then steps forward and drinks freely of the
red-water ; if it produces nausea in him, and causes him
to vomit freely, he is at once declared innocent. If it
produces vertigo, and he loses self-control, he is regarded
as guilty, and the people fall upon him, kick him, buffet
him, stone him, and finally drag him through bushes and
over rocks until he is practically torn to pieces. The
man who is declared innocent enjoys a higher position in
society than he did before the ordeal, and a few days after, dressed in his finest clothes, he progresses with his
friends in triumph through the village or town, and
receives gifts from admirers and friends. He then
arraigns his accusers before the chief men of the place,
and they must either undergo the ordeal, or pay a fine.
The natives believe that red-water itself possesses intelligence, and that it is capable of clear discrimination
in all doubtful cases. 1 They think that when it enters the
stomach it at once lays hold of the element of witchcraft,
and destroys the life of the accused. The quantity of
red-water which the accused is made to drink depends
upon the popular feeling at the time ; if he is &quot; very bad man,&quot; the quantity of water alone is sufficient to kill him,
to say nothing of the extract of bark in it. Sometimes
the accused is allowed to go away after drinking the
usual quantity, and then he, no doubt, takes an emetic,
and soon becomes well. Or, owing to family influence,

or friendship, the witch-doctor may make the decoction
very weak, which is certain to produce nothing but nausea
and vomiting. 1 Du Chaillu saw a decoction of Mbundu
leaves administered, and &quot; the poor drinker fell down
dead, with blood gushing from his mouth, eyes, and nose,
in five minutes after taking the dose.&quot;3 Messrs. Joyce
and Torday have proved that the poison of the ordeal is
far more often made from the bark or roots of a Strychnos
than from Erythrophlaeum quineense of Zambezia and
Nyasa-land. 3 Many other ordeals are known and
practised, 4 but the issue of each is practically in the
hands of the witch-doctor. In several parts of Africa sand plays a prominent part in magical ceremonies. In connection with this it may be noted that in the performance of the ancient
Egyptian ceremony of Opening the Mouth, the statue
of the deceased was placed upon a small mound of
sand, with its face towards the South, 5 and that in the
CXXXVIIth Chapter of the Book of the Dead, a
wholly magical Chapter, the Kher heb is ordered to say a
formula over one of the mud bricks, beginning :
&quot;
I am
the collar (or, field) of sand, round the things which
are hidden.&quot; 6 Junker relates that, when in Kordofan,
he came across a native who divined the future by
means of sand. The seer strewed sand smoothly on
the ground, and then made various marks and finger
impressions in the sand, from which he read his augury. 7
Mr. R. G. Anderson says that the Falatah of Kordofan
still have recourse to sand-gazing, but that they use it
for predicting the course, treatment, and issue of an illness, 1 See the excellent account of the red-water ordeal in Wilson, Western Africa, p. 224, and the remarks on its terrible effects on the population of the country by Nassau, Fetichism, p. 224. See also

the medium being a small boy who has never been
bitten by a dog nor burnt in the fire. The boy gazes
on the word &quot; Allah &quot; in the centre of a Khatim, or
seal, traced in the sand, and under the controlling eye
of a Fiki calls to the &quot; King of the Devils,&quot; who, on
his arrival, will answer any questions put regarding the
sick, through the medium of the child, by this time
sunk into a trance. 1 Among the Vai and Mandingo
in Liberia, divination by means of sand is also practised.
The sand is sifted through the fingers or sprinkled on
the ground, and the magician draws his conclusions as
to the future from the forms into which the sand falls.
Sir Harry Johnston says that sand divination is practised
throughout Muhammadan Africa, from the Senegal to
the Red Sea, and from Egypt to Nyasa. 2 In the oldest
form of sand divination, the signs used were triangles
and circles and lines with dots made inside and outside them in sand on the desert floor ; from the combination of dots the magician made his augury. In the next
form the sand was scattered by hand, and the augury
was derived from the forms which it assumed. In the Graeco- Roman Period the triangles, circles, and lines
were drawn on a board, and counters were made to take the place of the dots ; in this form it passed into
use among the Arabs among whom the Darb-al-raml,
or &quot;striking of the sand,&quot; is a common means used in
divining. 3 Burton saw an Arab &quot; sand board &quot;
(takht

3 In the Golden Silence, by C. N. and A. M. Williamson, London,
1910, we read that the lady Leila M Barka always carried about with
her the sand which she used in divining. It came from Tuggurt, and
was mixed with a little sand from Mekkah (p. 260). It would only
yield up its secret in star-light (p. 266). It was tied up in green silk,
lined with a very old Arab brocade, purple and gold, and was in
quantity as much as could have been heaped on a soup plate. The
heroine took a handful and held it over her heart, and framed a wish
whilst it was there, and then sprinkled it over the rest. M Barka trailed
her fingers lightly over the sand until she had made three long wavy
lines, the lower ones rather like telegraphic dots and dashes. The
heroine then laid her forefinger on three of the figures in the lines, and
after consulting a little old note-book M Barka also measured spaces
between the figures the girl had touched and counted monotonously.
And having uttered her prophecy she then smoothed away the tracings in the sand (p. 273).

al-raml) in use in Dahomey, and says that it was 2 feet
long, 8 inches broad, and that it had a dove-tail handle.
On one side of it were sixteen primary figures, called
&quot;
mothers,&quot; and on the other sixteen secondary figures, called &quot; children &quot;
; each figure was in an oblong of cut and
blackened lines, and at the top were circles, squares, etc.
The counters were thrown on the board, and according
to the positions in which they fell, so was the augury. 1
Whether the ancient Egyptians used sand in divining
cannot be said, but there seems to be little doubt that they regarded it in the light of a substance which
possessed magical qualities. They were probably well
acquainted with the mighty masses of sand which move
from north to south and from south to north in the
Western Desert, ruthlessly burying whole villages in a
few hours, and they, no doubt, believed that sand
contained a spirit which had to be propitiated. At all events, it is impossible to think that they could have
placed the statues of the dead, which were intended to
become abodes of their Doubles (KAu), upon mounds
of sand without some good traditional reason.
The power of the witch-doctor is exhibited to its
fullest extent when he is called on to &quot;smell out &quot;the
witch in a community in which a man of importance
has died suddenly and without apparent reason. He is
often fetched from a great distance, and when he has
come and performed his magic, and has declared that
such and such a man has witched out the life of the dead man, no earthly power can save the accused from
a cruel death. Du Chaillu has vividly described the
appearance of a witch-doctor who came to find out who
had caused Ishungui s death, and he says that he never
saw a more ghastly object. He had on a high head
dress of black feathers. His eyelids were painted red,
and a red stripe from the nose upward divided his
forehead into two parts. Another red stripe passed
round his head. The face was painted white, and on
each side of his mouth were two round red spots.
About his neck hung a necklace of grass and also a
cord, which held a box against his breast. This little
1 See Burton, Alf Laylah tva Laylah, Vol. Ill, p. 269 ; Burton,
Mission to Gelele, Vol. I, p. 332.



Magic, White and Black 195
box is sacred and contains spirits. A number of strips
of leopard and other skins crossed his breast, and were
exposed about his person ; and all these were charmed
and had charms attached to them. From each shoulder down to his hands was a white stripe, and one hand
was painted quite white. To complete this horrible
array, he wore a string of little bells around his body.
He sat on a box or stool, before which stood another
box containing charms. On this stood a looking-glass,
beside which lay a buffalo-horn containing some black
powder, and said, in addition, to be the refuge of many
spirits. He had a little basket of snake-bones, which he shook frequently during his incantations ; as also
several skins to which little bells were attached. 1 An official medicine-man seen by Mr. Torday had a tuft of
blood-red feathers on his head, numerous skins about his
loins, his body painted with white ochre, his hands
holding three spears, a whisk made of an antelope s tail,
an axe, and an executioner s knife. 3 Baertand Werner
describes the dress of a &quot; fetish man &quot; of a Mongwandi
village on the Dua-Ebola River thus : Two or three red
loin-cloths woven of raphia palm-fibre encircle his thighs ;
bells, feathers, and iron bracelets ornament his ankles and wrists ; a collar of white feathers surrounds his neck ; a score more large feathers of various colours are bound in
the shape of a tail in his hair ; all his body is daubed red,
his face painted white ; his hands shake little bells. 3
There is no proof that the Kher heb magician of the ancient Egyptians ever arrayed himself in such apparel as that described above, but it is quite possible that
the magic-doctors who worked magic for the lower
classes of the people dressed themselves in a fantastic
fashion in order to impress them with a sense of their
supernatural powers, and to awe them. The bulk of the
population of Egypt must always have been devout
believers in magic, both black and white, and their belief,
no doubt, found expression in the same way as the belief
in magic of the modern peoples of the Sudan.

CHAPTER XXII.
FETISHISM.
VARIOUS writers on comparative religion have described the religion of the ancient Egyptians as &quot;
fetishism,&quot;
and have regarded their gods as &quot;
fetishes.&quot; It seems,
however, to me wholly wrong to call the propitiatory
ceremonies which they performed before certain of their
spirits, and the worship which they paid to certain
sacred animals, and even the worship of figures of the
gods, by the name of fetishism, for by so doing they
use the word to describe forms of worship to which it
cannot rightly be applied. Neither a spirit, nor an animal, nor a figure of a god, is a fetish, for, properly
speaking,
&quot; a fetish is something tangible and inanimate,
which is believed to possess power of itself.&quot; 1 The
misuse of the word &quot; fetish &quot;
practically begins with
Bosnian, who often uses it in his &quot;
Description of
Guinea.&quot; In one place he says :
&quot; Fetiche, or Bossum in the Negro language, derives itself from their false
God, which they call Bossum,&quot; and elsewhere he states
that &quot;all things made in honour of their false gods,
never so mean, are called Fetiche.&quot; De Brosses, a later
writer, called everything worshipped by the negroes of
West Africa &quot;fetishes,&quot; and their system of worship
&quot;
fetishism,&quot; but, as Colonel Ellis has shown, he mixed
up Animal Worship and Nature Worship with the worship
of tangible and inanimate objects, and termed these
three distinct forms of worship &quot;fetishism.&quot; Both
Bosnian and De Brosses perpetuated a mistake made by
the early Portuguese travellers to West Africa who
visited that country between 1440 and 1500. At that
time their native country was filled with relics of saints,
charmed rosaries, images, crosses, etc., which were, in
the majority of cases, regarded by their wearers as
amulets or charms. Such articles were termed by the
1 Ellis, Tshi-speaking Peoples, p. 178.



Fetishism 197
Portuguese feiti$os, and a manufacturer or seller of them
was termed ^feitifeiro. When, therefore, the Portuguese found the natives reverencing or worshipping certain
objects such as those tenanted by tutelary deities they
naturally spoke of them as the feitifOS of the natives.
They had no other word commonly in use with which to
describe charms, or that which they supposed the natives
to regard as charms or amulets. The Portuguese only
applied the term feitifo to tangible and inanimate
objects, and to the wooden figures, stones, and cones of earth believed by the natives to be the abiding-places of
indwelling gods, etc. They would never have called an
iguana &feitifO, nor the local spirit of a hill or river, etc.
Since, therefore, a feitico is only, properly speaking, a
tangible and inanimate object, fetishism can properly
only mean the worship of such objects. The confusion
which has resulted from the improper use of the term
fetish is extreme, and is now probably irreparable. The
natives never worshipped, and do not now worship,
rocks or rivers, but the gods who dwell in them ; and
rocks, rivers, trees, etc., are only reverenced as the
abiding-places of gods. True fetishism, i.e., the worship
of tangible and inanimate objects, as Colonel Ellis
rightly says, is not characteristic of primitive peoples, or
of races low in the scale of civilization. It is only
arrived at after considerable progress has been made in
religious ideas, and when the older form of religion
becomes secondary. It owes its existence to the con fusion of the tangible with the intangible, of the material
with the immaterial ; and to the belief in the indwelling
god being gradually lost sight of, until the power, originally believed to belong to the god, is finally
attributed to the tangible and inanimate object itself. 1
According to Major A. G. Leonard fetishism and
idolatry are the two chief branches of the main channel of ancestral worship which forms the foundation of
naturism. 2 The spirit or deity symbolized in any
object, be it tree, stone, animal, etc., is in every case the
1 Ellis, op. tit., p. 190. And compare Nassau, Fetichism, p. 75;
Wilson, Western Africa, p. 211 ff., and Frobenius, The Childhood of Man, p. 182.

198 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
personification of the ancestor. 1 In the Delta of the
Niger fetishes and idols are merely religious adjuncts
that have grown out of the one main ancestral idea. 2
Material forms are considered by the native to be
essential for all ancestral spirits whose services are utilized or whose memories revered. These, to them, constitute the great and radical difference between those
spirits from whom human treatment may be expected,
and the malignant demons who wander about formless,
always ready to perpetrate evil and evil only. It is in
the act and purpose of this materialisation, in other
words, of this emblemism of spirits, which we speak of
as fetishism and idolatry, that much misconstruction has
been placed, principally by missionaries and travellers,
who, although their own Christian religion has been
evolved from the same identical germ, and on somewhat
similar lines, have been the greatest offenders in this
respect. Emblemism is merely an external formula of
an inner cult of worship. 3
Turning now to the ancient Egyptian religion, it may
be asked, Was there fetishism in it ? and if so, To what extent? If we compare the worship or reverence paid
by the Egyptians to the spirits of certain trees, or to the spirit of the Nile, or to the spirits of the gods, with the
worship of spirits of like character by modern African
peoples, we find its theory and practice to be identical.
The Egyptians worshipped their ancestors, whose spirits
they located in statues and figures, and Nature-spirits of
all kinds, and spirits of gods, who when it pleased them
took up their abode in symbolic figures, in living animals,
and in totems, living or dead, but from first to last there
is no evidence whatsoever that they worshipped a figure
or symbol, whether made of metal, wood, stone, porce lain, or any other substance, unless they believed it
to be the abode of a spirit of some kind. So far from fetishism being peculiarly characteristic of the Egyptian
religion, it seems to me that this religion, at all events in
its oldest form, was remarkably free from it. There is
plenty of evidence that the Egyptian of the Middle and

Fetishism 199
New Kingdoms did not know what many of the sacred
emblems or symbols represented, a fact which is clearly
proved by the way in which they drew them on papyri,
or fashioned them in various substances.
Thus in the case of the symbol ? ankh, which certainly
means &quot;
life,&quot; the Egyptians do not appear to have known
what object the picture represented, and no modern
Egyptologist has satisfactorily identified it. Again, the
Egyptians associated the so-called &quot; Buckle&quot; of Isis, R,
with the blood and magical words of power of that
goddess, and they believed that the object would protect
the wearer against evil, 1 but there is no evidence that
they knew in late times what object it symbolized. The
suggestion that the picture represents a buckle or belt
has nothing to recommend it, and it is far more likely
that A is a conventional representation of some member
of the body of the goddess than anything else. 2 Of
the tet, u, which is the symbol of Osiris, or his emblem,
more is known. The text of the CLVth Chapter of the
Book of the Dead associates it with the backbone,
c^3
&amp;lt;?, and vertebrae,
*
y of the god, and
it is clear that r is a conventional representation of
a part of his spinal column. The oldest form of this
part was probably represented by the symbol ^J, which
seems to represent a part of the back with portions
of the ribs attached to it. As time went on the funerary
artist drew a stand with a broadened base under it, and
made the ribs straight, and at length the form jr came
into being. It is possible that when the Egyptians had
forgotten what objects these three pictures, R, and
TT, symbolized, and only remembered that the first gave

20O Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
life, and the second the virtue of the blood of Isis, and the third the stability of the backbone of Osiris, the god
who rose from the dead, the lower classes and the ignorant came to regard them as fetishes in the true
sense of the word ; but this is not by any means certain.
There is no evidence that the Egyptians ever forgot
that figures of gods and sacred animals and pictures,
and amulets of all kinds, were the permanent or
temporary abiding-places of spirits, who, if cherished,
would be kind and helpful to them, and who, if slighted
or neglected, would do them harm. The JT and the j\
certainly represent the ancestral idea which seems to
me to have been the root of the cult of Osiris, for, as
we have seen, the former symbolizes a part of the body
of Osiris, himself the great ancestor-god, and the latter
is connected with the womb, that is to say, the very life
of Isis, the great ancestress-goddess. Many of the amulets are connected with the bodies
of the father-gods, or with incidents in their lives, to
reproduce which was always beneficial to the dead, and
sometimes to the living also. There was, no doubt, among
the Egyptians a class of men who were conscious or
unconscious impostors, and who supplied them with
charms, or amulets, or objects which were supposed to
contain powers derived from familiar spirits over which
such men claimed to have absolute or special control. Even
in such cases the alleged powers must have been assumed
to be of a spiritual character, for neither buyer nor seller
would be foolish enough to imagine that a piece of
carnelian, or a bit of porcelain, or a wooden figure,
would, of and by itself, bring protection to the wearer.
It was to the interest of both that the amulet or charm should contain a Spirit-power, for without the spirit they
were &quot;dead&quot; things. The natives all over the Sudan
and in West Africa will sell the traveller dead fetishes and amulets, but they will not willingly part with those
in which they think the spirits still live. Amulets and
charms which were inherited from parents or relatives
might, of course, easily become fetishes, just as they do
in Africa at the present day, in which case the possessors
worshipped them for themselves alone. On the other



Fetishism 201
hand, the present possessor might think that the Spirit
power which was in them when they were in the hands
of former possessors was increased by the addition to
it of the Spirit-powers of such possessors, and if this
were so he would regard them as very potent objects.
Wherever we find fetishism it seems to be a corruption
or modification of some former system of worship rather
than the result of a primitive faith. The worship of the
Sun-god Ra wrhich was introduced into Egypt by the
priests of Heliopolis was, no doubt, adopted by the
upper classes of the Egyptians, but the masses never
forsook their cult of the spirits who dwelt in ancestral
figures, sacred animals, amulets, and totems living or dead. Similarly the cult of Aten, which was rejected
even by the priesthood, made no impression on the
Egyptians of the lower classes, and the only effect it
could have upon them would be to make them cling
closer to their belief in the great ancestor-god Osiris.
In cases where their priests adopted the cult of the sun
under any form, and therefore ceased to teach the
doctrine of the in-dwelling spirit in ancestral figures, etc.,
the people might forget the doctrine, and their ancestral
figures, amulets, etc., would then degenerate into fetishes.
All this is only theory so far as the Egyptians are
concerned, but authorities on modern African religions
tell us that this is exactly what has taken place among
the peoples of West Africa. Thus Colonel Ellis says
that there is more fetishism among the negroes of the
West Indies, who have been Christianized for more than half a century, than amongst those of West Africa ; for
side by side with the new religion have lingered the old
superstitions, whose true import has become forgotten
or corrupted. Hence the belief in Obeah, still prevalent
in the West Indies, which formerly was a belief in in
dwelling spirits which inhabited certain objects, has now
become a reverence or worship paid to tangible and
inanimate objects, which of themselves are believed to possess the power to injure. 1 Dr. Nassau says that the
West African accepted baptism as a powerful charm.
For each and all of his heathen fetishes the Christian

2O2 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
priest simply substituted a relic. The ignorant African,
while he learned to bow to the Virgin, kept on wor
shipping also a fetish. The Virgin was only just another
fetish, and Christian priests only another set of powerful
fetish-doctors. The heathen in becoming a baptized
&quot; Christian &quot;
left behind him only the names of his fetish
ceremonies. Some new and professedly more powerful
ones were given him, which were called by Christian
names, but which very much resembled what he had
been using all his life. His conversion&quot; caused no
jar to his old beliefs, nor change in its practice, except
that the new fetish was worshipped in a cathedral, and
before a bedizened altar. 1

CHAPTER XXIII.
SPITTING AS A RELIGIOUS ACT.
THE ancient Egyptian texts contain many allusions to
spitting, and whether employed in blessing or banning
it was certainly regarded as a religious act of no small
significance. Under certain circumstances it was con
sidered to be a creative act. Thus when, according to
a legend which is as old at least as the Pyramids, the
god Tem had had union with himself he spat, and his
spittle was the gods Shu and Tefnut ; he then placed
his arms round them, and his KA, or Double, entered into them. 1 This legend is repeated in the Papyrus of
Nesi-Amsu, 2 and, no doubt, was accepted in the
Ptolemaic and Roman periods. In the XVIIth Chapter
of the Book of the Dead we read that the Eye of Ra,
i.e., the Sun, was seriously injured by a violent assault
made upon it by Set, but Thoth came forward, and,
having spit upon the Eye, the trouble disappeared, and
the Eye soon recovered. 3 In this case spitting was
used as a curative act. From a book of magic we
learn that spitting was sometimes made an act of cursing. Thus in the Book of Overthrowing Apep we have a
Chapter entitled &quot; Of spitting upon Apep,&quot; and its opening words are :
&quot; Be spit upon, Apep,&quot; which are to
be said four times. When the wax figure of Apep was
cast into the fire the priest spat upon it as it burned,
and then trampled upon it with his left foot. On another occasion the priest said :
&quot; Look thou, Ra, hear
1. 6623.See Budge, Egyptian Hieratic Papyri, p. XIV.



204 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
&quot; thou, Ra, verily I have destroyed thine enemy, I have
&quot; trampled upon him, I have spit upon him.&quot; The case
in which the wax figure was sometimes burnt was,
according to the Rubric, &quot; to be stamped on with the
&quot; left foot, and spit upon four times in the course of every
&quot;
day.&quot; In this case spitting is an act of banning. The following illustrates the use of spitting as a curative act.
In Kordofan the operator kneels over the outstretched patient, and after making a silent prayer he reads aloud
the opening Surah of the Kur an, and then spits over
the body three times ; having said Amin (Amen) he
rises to his feet. Descendants of the Prophet possess
the powers of curing by spitting, but holy men in
general have them. And any human spittle is supposed
to contain curative properties. Sometimes the saliva is
mixed with sand and is applied to the nostrils, eyes, and
forehead of the sufferer, and at other times it is mixed with water and carried to the bed-ridden as a remedy. Roots
are often chewed to a pulp in the mouth and then
applied to the nostrils. 1
Spitting has many significations
in the Sudan generally, and the universality of the custom is proved by the following remarks of travellers.
Schweinfurth says that spitting betokens the most
affectionate goodwill. Among the Dyur it was a pledge
of attachment, an oath of fidelity ; it was to their mind
the proper way of giving solemnity to a league of friend
ship. 3 The chief of the Jangaes gave Petherick a goat,
requesting that he would spit in the hand of his son,
expressing a belief that if he did so his son would be enabled to throw a spear with power. Petherick
cordially did so amid the acclamations of the tribe, and
the youth received the congratulations of all. 3 Among
the Barotze relatives take leave of each other with elaborate ceremony. They spit upon each other s faces
and hands, or, rather, pretend to do so, for they do not
actually emit saliva. They also pick up blades of grass,
spit upon them, and stick them about the beloved head.
They also spit on the hands ; all this is done to warn off
evil spirits. Spittle also acts as a kind of tabu. When

Spitting as a Religious Act 205
they do not want a thing touched, they spit on straws
and stick them all about the object. 1 Among the Bantu
when the priest introduces the newly born child to the
ancestral spirits, he spits on it as he makes each petition
on its behalf. 2 The Masai formerly attached much
importance to the act of spitting, and among them and
the tribes of the Nandi and Suk to spit at a person is
a very great compliment. When the Masai came to
Sir Harry Johnston, each of them before extending his
hand to him would spit on the palm. Before they
entered his house they would spit to the north, east,
south, and west. Every unknown object which they
regarded with reverence, such as a train, they would spit
at. Newly born children are spit on by every one who
sees them. 3 The people of the Kytch tribe return
thanks by holding your hand and affecting to spit upon
it ; which operation they do not actually perform, as
I have seen stated in works on the White Nile. 4 Before
parting a ceremony had to be performed by Katchiba.
His brother was to be our guide, and he was to receive
power to control the elements as deputy-magician during
the journey, lest we should be wetted by the storms, and the torrents should be so swollen as to be impassable.
With great solemnity Katchiba broke a branch from
a tree, upon the leaves of which he spat in several
places. This branch, thus blessed with holy water, was
laid upon the ground, and a fowl was dragged about it.
by the chief. Katchiba handed the branch to his
brother, who received it with much dignity, in addition to a magic whistle of antelope s horn which he suspended
from his neck. Every native had a whistle, with which
he could attract or drive away rain at pleasure. No
whistle was supposed to be effective unless it had been
blessed by Katchiba. 5 One day Speke went out shoot
ing, but though he fired at several animals he failed to
kill any of them. All his men were surprised, and the

villagers who were escorting him in the hope of getting
flesh, were so much annoyed that they offered to cut his
forefinger with a spear and spit on it for good luck. 1
When Rebmann was leaving a chief, he and the Wanika
and Suahili were favoured with &quot;
dirty expectoration
&quot;
by the natives as a sign of farewell, and then they were told to &quot; go in peace.&quot;
3 When Miss Kingsley said
farewell to a woman whom she visited, the old lady took
her hand, turned it palm upwards, and spat upon it.
She consulted Dr. Nassau on the subject, and he told
her that the spitting was a by-product of the performance
which consisted in blowing a blessing. 3
Thomson says : Spitting has a very different signifi
cation with the Masai from that which prevails with us
or with most other tribes. With them it expresses the
greatest goodwill and the best of wishes. It takes the
place of compliments of the season, and you had better
spit upon a damsel than kiss her. You spit when you
meet, and you do the same on leaving. You seal your
bargain in a similar manner. The Masai flocked to me,
and the more copiously I spat upon them, the greater
was their delight ... How could I, for instance, resist the upturned face of a young unmarried woman, as with
her bright eyes she would look the wish she longed to
utter. And what better reward could I have than the delighted glance of the nut-brown maid when I expec
torated upon the little snub nose so eagerly and piquantly
presented ?4 Among the works of the European
travellers to Africa in the seventeenth century which mention spitting may be noticed Claude Jannequin s
Voyage to Lybia in 1697, p. 33.
THE WEARING OF TAILS BY MEN AND WOMEN.
Everyone who has examined the bas-reliefs in
Egyptian temples, and the coloured vignettes in papyri
containing copies of the Book of the Dead, cannot have
failed to notice that gods and kings are often repre

Spitting as a Religious Act 207
sented wearing very long tails, with an elongated tuft at
the end. And if we look at the statues of kings we
shall find that in many of them also the tail is repre
sented, especially in seated statues. In the case of the seated statues of Amen-hetep III in the British Museum,1
the tails are supposed to have been brought under the
body, and parts of them, with the tufts, will be seen sculptured on the flat surfaces between the legs. In
reliefs the tail is attached to the girdle and tunic, or loin
cloth, of which it probably, at one time, formed part.
In primitive times gods, kings, and magic-doctors, all
over the Sudan and in other parts of Africa, wore the
skins of animals when they were performing solemn
ceremonies, and the tails of such skins hung down
behind them ; the tail in the Egyptian bas-relief and in
the vignette is a survival of this ancient skin dress.
The god Thoth was incarnate in the ibis, and Horus
in the hawk, yet the Egyptians saw nothing unusual in
representing the former as an ibis-headed man wearing
a long tail, and the latter as a hawk-headed man wearing
a long tail. 2 Animal gods, e.g., the Jackal -god Anubis,
when represented with a human body, are also given
tails. The custom of wearing a tail has passed down
the ages from the primitive to the modern African
peoples, who, as will be seen from the following extracts, attach considerable importance to it.
The Bongo men and women wear girdles, the former
adding a strip of stuff which they fasten to the girdle,
allowing the ends to fall down before and behind. The latter attach to the girdle a supple bough with plenty of
leaves, and perhaps a bunch of grass. Now and then
a tail, like a black horse-tail, composed of the bast of
the Sanseviera, is appended to the back of the girdle. 3
The usual costume of the Niam-Niam is formed of skins which are fastened to the girdle and form a picturesque
drapery about the loins. The finest and most varie gated skins are chosen for this purpose, those of the
genet and colobus being held in the highest estimation ;
the long black tail of the quereza monkey is also

fastened to the dress. 1 Escaryac de Lanture was told
of the existence of Lake Koeidabo, to the west of which
lived the Mala-gilageh, or men with tails ; they were of
small stature and reddish complexions, and covered with
long hair. 2 The dress of the Moro women is of the
scantiest description, and consists of a plaited wisp of
straw of the strictest economical dimensions, and is drawn up between the legs and attached to a slender
waist-belt. This also sustains at the back a bunch of green leaves, about the size and shape of the tail of an
ostrich, which gives the wearer a jaunty appearance. 3
The men of Uregga wear skins of civet and monkeys,
with the tails hanging downwards.4 Among the Bantu
negroes both sexes usually wear a waist-belt of beads,
and the married women who have borne children wear a lower string of beads, to which is attached a tiny little
apron of leather embroidered with beads, and also a
long tail made of strings of fibre derived from a marsh
plant. The tiny apron in front is sometimes made of
short strings of the same fibre, instead of being a piece
of leather sewn with beads. Very great importance is
attached to this tiny square of fibre or beadwork, and to
the tail behind. If a man of the same tribe should touch this, the only covering worn by a married woman,
a great offence has been committed, even if the man be
the woman s husband. Unless the sacrifice of a goat
is made it is thought that the woman will die of the
o
insult. If, however, these coverings are touched or torn
off by an enemy or a stranger no harm is done. 5 Among
the Nilotic negroes, when a woman is married she puts
on a tail of strings. After marriage it is considered
very bad manners for a woman to serve food to her
husband without putting on this tail. On the other
hand, if the husband or any other man should touch the
married woman s tail, it is considered that he wishes to bewitch her, and such an offence must be atoned for by

the usual sacrifice of a goat.
1 As a sign of mourning a
black tail, fringed with white strings, is worn for about
a month. 3 The women of the Shir and Kytch tribes
wear small lappets of tanned leather as broad as the
hand. At the back of the belt, which supports this
apron, is a tail which reaches to the lower portions of
the thighs. This tail is formed of finely cut strips of
leather, and the costume has doubtless been the founda tion for the report I had received from the Arabs that
&quot; a tribe in Central Africa had tails like horses.&quot;3 The Bari women wear a neat little lappet, about six inches
long, of beads, or of small iron rings worked like a coat
of mail, in lieu of a fig-leaf, and the usual tail of fine
shreds of leather or twine, spun from indigenous cotton,
pendent behind. Both the lappet and tail are fastened
on a belt which is worn round the loins, like those of the Shir tribe ; thus the toilette is completed at once. 4
The Latuka women wear exceedingly long tails,
precisely like those of horses, but made of fine twine and
rubbed with red ochre and grease. 5 The Yergum on
the Niger told Mr. Boyd Alexander that the Gazum
people have tails about six inches long, for which they
have to dig a hole in the ground when they sit down,
a statement which he doubted. 6 The Wahele women who can afford it dress almost entirely in beads, wearing
innumerable strings round their loins. Nothing else is
worn in front, while behind it would be considered indecent to appear without a piece of hide ornamented
with beads, and cut away so as to resemble a tail. 7
The Wakavirondo also make tails for themselves of
grass or fibre. 8

CHAPTER XXIV.
MISCELLANEOUS.
i. ILLNESS CAUSED BY AN OFFENDED DEITY.
IT has already been shown that the Egyptians believed
that sicknesses were caused by spirits, good or bad, and
that the modern Africans hold a similar belief. The sickness may be a punishment inflicted on a human being
by an offended or outraged deity, or may be caused by a
minor evil spirit who has been induced to cause it by the
operations of a magician, or witch-doctor. As an example
of the belief that a sickness was caused by the anger of a
deity may be quoted the following : A stele at Turin1
which was made for one Nefer-Aabu bears a text in which the deceased confesses the sins which he committed against the goddess Mer-sekert, 2 who was called TeheniAmenti, 3 the &quot; Forehead of Amenti,&quot; and whose shrine was situated near the Ramesseum at Thebes. &quot; Whilst
&quot;
I was on earth,&quot; he says,
&quot; I was an ignorant and a
&quot; senseless man, knowing neither good nor bad, and I
&quot;
transgressed against Teheni. And she corrected me,
&quot; and I was in her hand both by night and by day, and
&quot; I sat upon the tiles like a woman who is with child. I
&quot; cried out for air (or, breath) but none came to me, for
&quot;
I was fast bound by Teheni-Amentet, the strongest of
&quot; all the gods, the goddess of the city. Behold, I say to
&quot;
everyone, great and small, among the officials, Take
&quot; good heed to Teheni, for there is a lion inside her,
&quot; and it smiteth like a savage lion, and she pursueth
&quot; whosoever sinneth against her. Then I cried out to
&quot; my Lady, and she came to me in the form of sweet air,
&quot; she made peace with me, and she made me to perceive
&quot; her hand, she came back to me with feelings of peace,

Illness Caused by Spirit of Wife 211
&quot; she made me to forget my suffering, and I had air to
&quot; breathe. Now Teheni-Amentet maketh peace with
&quot; him that crieth out to her, and Nefer-aabu saith :
&quot; Behold, listen, O all ye ears which are upon the earth
&quot; take good heed to Teheni-Amentet.&quot; The stele on
which this text is found was, no doubt, set up by a man
who, when suffering from bronchitis or asthma, or both
together, went to the shrine of the goddess, and, con
fessing his sins, implored her forgiveness and help. The
goddess answered him graciously, and came to him in the
form of air, i.e., she gave him power to breathe easily,
and in grateful remembrance of her help, he had an
account of his cure written and set up near her shrine for all to see.
2. ILLNESS CAUSED BY THE SPIRIT OF A DEAD WIFE.
A papyrus at Leyden, published by Maspero, 1 sup
plies some very interesting information on the causation
of sickness by spirits. This document contains a copy of
a letter which was written by a widower to the spirit of
his deceased wife, and placed by him on a sepulchral
figure. In it he says : &quot;What harm did I ever do to
&quot; thee that I should come to the terrible plight I am in?
&quot; What harm have I done to thee that thou shouldst lay
&quot; thine hand upon me, seeing that no evil hath been done
&quot; to thee ? From the time when we were married have
&quot;
I ever hidden anything from thee ? Thou didst
&quot; become my wife when I was a young man, and I have
&quot; lived with thee ever since. Though I was promoted
&quot; to dignities of all kinds I still lived with thee, and I &quot; never left thee, nor did I cause thy heart any pain.
&quot; When I was set over the soldiers of Pharaoh and the &quot; men who followed his chariot, did I not cause thee to &quot; come so that they might do homage to thee, and did
&quot; not they give thee beautiful gifts of all kinds ? When
4&amp;lt; thou wast ill I went to the chief physician, and he did
&quot; for thee everything which thou saidst he ought to do.
&quot; When I went with Pharaoh to the Sudan I was
&quot;
thinking the whole time of thee, and I passed the eight
&quot; months which the expedition lasted without desire to

212 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
&quot; eat or to drink because of thee. When I came back &quot; to Memphis I asked leave of Pharaoh, and I returned
&quot; at once to thee, and I and my people mourned for thee
&quot; before my house. I made funerary apparel for thee, and
&quot; linen swathings, and provided an abundant supply of
&quot;
offerings.&quot; The concluding words of this extraordinary
document are obscure, and it is impossible to say what
their meaning is. The sheet of papyrus on which this
letter was written was rolled up and attached to a sepul
chral figure,_ not of the wife to whom it is addressed she
was called Ankh-ari1 but of another woman. This fact is difficult to explain, and it has been supposed that the
letter was attached to the wrong figure by mistake.
Another explanation is possible. The figure to which it
was fastened may have been that of a woman who died
some time after Ankh-ari, and the widower may have
attached it to her figure with the view of getting the
spirit of this woman to convey its contents to the spirit
of his dead wife in the Other World. The text says
nothing about the reason why the letter was written, but
it seems quite clear that the widower, finding himself
sick and depressed, consulted a magician, who told him
that his illness was caused by the spirit of his dead wife.
Towards the close of his letter the widower seems to say
that he did not enter his house for three years, and we
may assume that, having waited all this time for peace,
he at last consulted a magician, and made his appeal to
his dead wife s spirit. Further, the magician may have
promised him to cause the contents of the letter to reach
the Other World without fail.
3. MARRIAGE.
Of the betrothal and wedding ceremonies of the
ancient Egyptians nothing is known, but it is most
probable that they resembled those which are common
among Africans at the present day. 2 Social formalities

Marriage 213
made the marriage legal, and it is unlikely that there
was any religious ceremony. Under the New Empire
women of high degree took care to have suitable
provision made for them before they married, and care
fully worded legal contracts safeguarding their interests
were drawn up and executed. Apparently any man
might marry any woman, for there seems to have been
neither family nor tribal totem tabti, at least in the
Dynastic Period. Polygamy was very common. Among
the upper classes a man frequently married more than
one wife for purely official and social reasons, which
were often connected with property of various kinds,
and the inscriptions mention a few cases in which two
wives rule in a man s house at the same time. Kings,
of course, married several wives for political and State
reasons, and they and their nobles usually kept large
harims. Among the lower classes in the great towns
sexual morality was not of a high order, and men
frequently lived with women who were not their wives.
Then, as now, they entered into &quot; temporary marriages,
and as often as not they called the women who lived
with them their &quot;sisters.&quot; In all classes men some times married their actual sisters, and they appear to
have done so in order to keep property in the family.
This kind of incest was authorized by the cult of Osiris,
for according to the legend the two brothers Osiris and
Set married their sisters Isis and Nephthys. Another
legend quoted by Plutarch makes Osiris to have union
also with Nephthys, the result of this intercourse being
Anubis. The Ptolemies adopted the custom of sister
marriage, though the Greeks in general abhorred it.
Among modern African peoples marriage between
brother and sister is practically unknown. In West
Africa marriage within any degree of consanguinity
is forbidden, and marriage of cousins is impossible j
1 in
modern Egypt the marriage of cousins is regarded as a
fitting arrangement, and all parties are satisfied. The
religious texts show that the spirits of the Other World

214 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
rejoiced in marriage, though there is no mention made of
spirit offspring. Thus in the text of Unas (Vth dynasty)
we read of the king marrying a young and beautiful
woman in the kingdom of Osiris, 1 and also the goddess
I sis, 3 and he carries off women from their husbands whenever he pleases, and makes them his wives3 in any
place he pleases.
Adultery was as common in Egypt as it is at the
present time in many parts of Africa, and was sometimes
punished by death. Thus in the_ Westcar Papyrus we
find that the adulterous wife of Aba-aner was, by royal
command, burnt by the north wall of the palace, and her
ashes thrown into the canal, or river, and the Tale of the Two Brothers says that after Anpu had heard the
true account of his wife s wickedness from his brother he went home and killed her, and threw her body to the
dogs, or jackals. 4 Among modern African peoples
adultery is punished by death, or mutilation, or a heavy
fine. Prostitution was common, and among the ranks of
courtesans were large numbers of married women whose
husbands had left them, and who travelled up and down
the country practising their profession. This is proved
by a passage in the Maxims of Ani, wherein the
young man is warned to guard himself against the
woman from outside whose town is not known. The
Teta, 1. 277 = Pepi I, 1. 30.



Marriage 215
writer also mentions the woman whose husband is far away from her, 1 and who writes every day to the man
she has set her heart upon. If there is no one looking
she stands up and spreads out her net. &quot; Do not look
&quot; at her, do not follow her, have no commerce with her.
&quot; She is like a whirlpool in a current leading man
&quot; knoweth not where. To listen to her is an abominable
&quot; and deadly thing.&quot; The modern parallel to this is
supplied by the Babangi women, who used, to group
themselves in little bands of courtesans, who plied their
trade up and down the Congo between the Equatorial
region and Stanley Pool. 2 The courtesan and concubine
were such important members of ancient Egyptian
society that even the pious Egyptian expected to meet
his friends among these classes in the Other World.
On a coffin at Cairo the deceased Sepa says :
&quot; Behold,
&quot; O great Creator, make Sepa to rejoin his sons and
&quot;
daughters, and his concubines whom it is his heart s
&quot; desire [to meet],&quot; and he hoped to find in heaven his
grandparents, parents, sons, daughters, brethren, sisters,
uncles, aunts, cousins, friends, servants, &quot; and the con
cubine whom he loved and knew.&quot;3 Among some
African peoples, e.g., the Busoga, seduction is heavily
punished ; curiously enough, among the Bantu Kavi
rondo marriage is consummated in the presence of a
large number of girls and women. 4 The &quot; chief wife,&quot;
whether in palace or farm, was a great power, and she
ruled the household as she pleased. The reverence paid
to the mother was always very great, and under the
Ancient and Middle Empires men invariably traced
their descent from their mothers. On a funerary stele
the name of the father of the deceased is rarely men tioned, but great care is taken to record that of the
mother. It has been customary in Africa from time
immemorial to trace descent through the mother rather
than through the father, probably because there never
can be any doubt as to a man s parentage on his

216 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
mother s side. Kinship was reckoned very far on the
female side. Thus in the &quot; Stele of the Enthronement &quot; ] the pedigree of the mother of Aspelta is reckoned for
seven generations, while of his male ancestors only his
father is mentioned. This is the case also among some
modern African peoples, e.g., the Bambala, who reckon
kinship on the female side ; on that of the male not
beyond the uncle and grandfather. 2 In the Camma
(Nkama) country also descent is traced from the
mother. 3 The Maxims of Ani tell a man to make
offerings to his father and mother when they rest in
the tomb, 4 but he is most solemnly warned by them to
be most careful how he treats his mother, who suckled him for three years, 5 and carried bread and beer to him
every day when he was at school. The writer says :
&quot; Give thy mother no cause to be offended at thee, lest
she lift up her hands to the God, Who will hear her
&quot; complaint
&quot; 6 and will punish thee.
4. RESPECT FOR THE AGED.
Respect for the aged was a characteristic of the
Egyptian, and it is found among a large number of
1 Mariette, Monuments Divers, Plate 9. 2 Johnston, George Grenfell, Vol. II, p. 699.
3 Du Chaillu, Adventures, p. 251.
5 See Winwood Reade, Savage Africa, p. 205. &quot;The mother is
&quot; treated with great respect, and is exempt from all labour while she
&quot; continues to suckle her child, which she does as long as her milk lasts
&quot;
generally two or three years. During this time and also from the
&quot; moment that impregnation becomes apparent, the mother no longer
&quot; cohabits with her husband.&quot; Compare also Livingstone, Last
Journals, p. 51, where he says that women have no intercourse with
their husbands when enceinte, and for three years afterwards.



Purification after Birth 217
modern African tribes at the present day. The
Maxims of Ani say :
&quot; Sit not down when another is
standing up if he be older than thou, even if thy rank
in life be higher than his.&quot; 1 With this compare :
Young men never enter the presence of an aged person
without curtseying, and passing in a stooping attitude,
as if they were going under a low door. When seated
in his presence, it is always at a humble distance. If
they hand him a lighted pipe or a mug of water, they
fall on one knee. If an old man, they address him as
rera, &quot;
father&quot;; if an old woman, as ngwe, &quot; mother.&quot; 2
The aged must only be addressed in terms of flattery
and adulation. Any disrespectful deportment or
reproachful language towards such persons is regarded
as a misdemeanor of no ordinary kind. And there is
nothing which a young person so much deprecates as
the curse of an aged person, and especially that of a
revered father. This profound respect for aged persons, by a very natural operation of the mind, is turned into
idolatrous regard for them when dead. They are not
divested of their power and influence by death, but, on
the contrary, they are raised to a higher and more
powerful sphere of influence, and hence the natural
disposition of the living, and especially those related to
them in any way in this world, to look to them and
call upon them for aid in all the emergencies and trials
of life. 3
5. PURIFICATION AFTER BIRTH.
Soon after a child was born among the ancient
Egyptians, he or she was washed with water and, in
the case of well-to-do people, was probably anointed
with oil. The washing with water was, no doubt,
(
2 Reade, Savage Africa, p. 208.
8 Wilson, Western Africa^ p. 393.



218 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
originally a symbolic act, and was equivalent to the
sprinkling with water which took place during the
performance of religious and magical rites and cere
monies. The anointing oil was probably of a special
kind, and must have been thought to possess peculiar
properties, like the Seven Holy Oils used in the
Opening of the Mouth. Whether the washing of the
child with water was regarded in the same way as we
regard baptism we do not know. Among many modern
African tribes there remain traces of a ceremony
resembling baptism, which may have been derived from
the Jews or Christians of East Africa. Dr. Nassau
found traces of the ceremony on Corisco Island about
46 years ago, and he says that it had been very
prevalent in other parts of the Gabun country before
that time. 1 Mr. Wilson states that in Western Africa a public crier announces the birth of a child, and claims
for it a name and place among the living. Someone
else, in a distant part of the village, acknowledges the
fact, and promises, on the part of the people, that the
child shall be received into the community, and have
all the rights and immunities pertaining to the rest of
the people. The population then assemble in the street,
and the babe is brought out and exposed to public
view. Dr. Nassau gives a picture of the babe lying
on a plantain leaf. 2 A basin of water is provided, and
the headman of the village or family sprinkles water
upon the child, giving it a name, and invoking a
blessing upon it, such as, that it may have health, grow
up in manhood or womanhood, a numerous progeny,
possess much riches, etc. 3 Among the Banyoro the
Muchwezi, or sorcerer, visits the newly born child, and
as he prays that it may have long life, riches, and
health, and may be a firm believer in the tribal and
ancestral spirits, he spits on its body as he utters each
petition, and pinches it all over. 4 The priest s saliva is,
of course, sacred. Bishop Tucker found in Uganda a
ceremony very like baptism ; oil was poured on the

Circumcision 219
child s head, and a name was given to it. 1 Among the
Yorubas a remarkable ceremony of purification is per
formed over both mother and child seven days after
its birth. The water which is always in the earthen
vessels placed before the images of the gods is brought
to the house and thrown upon the thatched roof, and
as it drips down from the eaves the mother and child
pass three times through the falling drops. The
babalawo (priest) next makes a water of purification
with which he bathes the child s head, and he repeats
three times the name by which the infant is to be
known, and then holds him in his arms so that his feet touch the ground. 2
When in the Oasis of Khargah in 1909, I was informed
by the Omdah that the inhabitants, though Muslims,
baptize their babies on the second or third day after birth.
The child is placed in a flat basin (tishf) and water is
poured over it, whilst a name is given to it. This custom
dates from pre- Muslim times, when the dwellers in the
Great Oasis were Christians, and they have preserved it along with several other customs, apparently of Christian
origin. Thus they decorate the tops of the walls of their
houses with palm branches once a year on a day which is
equivalent to Palm Sunday, and for weeks before Easter
they collect eggs, and save them and dye them pink with
a decoction of permanganate of potash, and as &quot; Easter
eggs
&quot;
they eat them on Easter Sunday.
6. CIRCUMCISION.
The mummified bodies of the ancient Egyptians which
are available for examination prove that circumcision was
general at all periods in Egypt. As, however, the texts say little or nothing about the ceremony itself, or its
significance, we must assume that it had no religious
importance, at least in Dynastic times, and that, if the
earlier inhabitants of the Nile Valley ever regarded it
as an act of worship, this view of it was ignored by their
descendants or forgotten. Originally, circumcision must
have had a religious significance, and there is little doubt

220 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
that the portion cut from the body of the boy was
regarded as an offering which was made to one or
other of the gods of virility or generation, just as it is
to-day among many of the tribes of Africa. A representa
tion of the performance of circumcision, probably the
oldest known, is found on a relief in a tomb at Sakkarah, :
and it dates from the period of the Vlth dynasty. The
act is performed by a &quot;priest of the KV2 but whether
this official was a member of the boy s family, or a
professional priest, cannot be said. A god of circumcision
appears to be mentioned in the text of Teta (Vlth
dynasty), but in exactly what connection is not clear. 3 According to the accounts of travellers circumcision is not universal in Africa at the present time. All the
males of the Congo Pygmies seen by Sir Harry
Johnston were circumcised, 4 and so were the Mbuta
and Bantu-speaking negroes of the Congo Forest, from
the Semliki Valley to the Upper Congo. 5 Among the
Nandi youths are circumcised between the ages of ten
and twenty, and only boys are so treated if they are
fairly rich orphans, or if their fathers are old men.
The commonest age is between fifteen and nineteen. 6
Among the Masai the age is between thirteen and
seventeen, but orphans and the children of the poor wait
till they are twenty. 7 Among the Lendu the age is seven
or eight, and the part cut from the boy is carefully buried
in the ground. 8 In some parts of West Africa the

operation is performed from two to twelve days after the
child s birth, in others after a period of three or four
months, and in others the rite is evaded. No Lunda man
can become chief until he has been circumcised. Some of the tribes of forest negroes of the north-east borderland
of the Congo basin, 1 and a few of the Mongo tribes, and
the Bambala and Bahuanaofthe Kwilu-Kasai, and many
of the wild negroes of the south and south-east, do not
circumcise. The Kruboys of West Africa entirely
repudiate the idea. 3 Among the Bongos circumcision is not
practised, and a circumcised man cannot hope to make a
good marriage. 3 The Basukuma do not circumcise, 4 but
the Lendu do. 5 According to Stanley, some of the tribes
of the great African forest circumcise, and others do not ;
6
the forest embraces twelves degrees of longitude. The
Wakamba, like most East African tribes, circumcise. 7 In
Andrew Battell s day the people of Angola were circum
cised. 8 The Waiyau used to circumcise their males, and
after the performance of the ceremony boys took a new
name. 9 The people of the Sherbro also gave their boys
a name after circumcision. 10 As to whether there is any religious or &quot; fetishistic
&quot;
idea connected with circumcision in the minds of the
modern African opinions differ. Bentley thought there
was not, but according to Mr. Torday some tribes in south-west Congoland attach a &quot; distinct fetishistic
importance
&quot; to the operation. Sir Harry Johnston also
thinks that in some parts of Congoland &quot;
vestiges of

superstition or religion
&quot; are attached to it in the minds of
the people. 1 He also thinks that the practice &quot;arose in
connection with religious belief somewhere in Egypt,
Arabia, Syria, or the Mediterranean coast-lands, and
gradually made its way south into Africa, assisted very
considerably during the last thousand years by the spread
of Muhammadanism.&quot; 2 It is, however, quite certain that
circumcision was practised by the Blacks, or Negroes, in
Predynastic times ; this is proved by the green slate
object in the British Museum, 3 on which is a representa
tion of a fight between Egyptians and Blacks. The men
who are vanquished have curly wool for hair, and are
bearded and naked, and it is evident that they are circum
cised. These enemies of the Egyptians, who are certainly
Sudani folk, may have borrowed circumcision from Egypt,
but if it is so, it is quite clear that the borrowing was
very ancient, for it took place at least 6,000 years ago. Strabo says :
&quot; All the Troglodytes are circumcised, and
the cripples among them are mutilated&quot; (iii. 31). The
general trend of the evidence suggests that circumcision
was practised in the Sudan, as well as in Egypt, from time
immemorial, that it had nothing to do with considerations
of health, that it had a religious significance, and that it
was originally connected with some kind of phallic
worship. 4
In many parts of the Sudan girls also are circumcised.
According to Mr. R. G. Anderson the circumcision of
girls is of two kinds. The first is called Tahurat Sunna, i.e., the &quot;
purification of the law,&quot; and the second Takurat Farohm, i.e., the &quot;
purification of the Pharaohs.&quot; In
the first the clitoris and labia minora are removed ; this
kind is in vogue among Egyptian women, but in the
Sudan is mostly restricted to the Bakkarah tribes. In
the second the upper two-thirds of the labia majora are

also removed ; this kind of circumcision is believed to have been practised by the ancient Egyptians under the
Pharaohs, and is thought to have survived despite the
innovation of Muslim Law. 1 Strabo mentions the
circumcision of girls (KCU ra OyXea e/cT/ii&amp;gt;M&amp;gt;), but he does
not go into details. W. G. Browne, who was in the
Sudan between 1792 and 1800, supplies some interesting
information in his narrative of his travels, and describes
the operation and its effects. 2 The whole subject has
been investigated with great care and learning by
Dr. Ploss, who shows that the practice is common in
Egypt, Nubia, Abyssinia, Sennaar, and the Sudan, and
among the Gallas, Agows, Gaffats, Gongos and many
other peoples of East Africa. It is also found in the Little
Oasis, where to be called the &quot; son of an uncut woman &quot; is a serious insult, and in West Africa, e.g., in Sierra Leone, Benin, Congo-land, Accra, the Gold Coast, Old
Calabar, Loando and in the lands of the Masai, Wakuasi, and Betchuanas. It is interesting to note that Dr. Ploss
considers infibulation, which follows the operation in
Africa, quite peculiar to Africa, for he says that outside
North and Central Africa he has found it practised in no
other country in the world. 3

224 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
7. TWINS.
It is well known that in several parts of the Sudan
the advent of twins is regarded as a calamity, and that
they are promptly killed, and that in others twins are
welcomed and are allowed to grow up like other children.
The Egyptians had no hostile feelings to twins, for their
gods and goddesses Osiris, Isis, Set, Nephthysand Horus
were all children of one birth, and Osiris and Set were always regarded as twin brethren, and Isis and Nephthys
as twin sisters. And the Egyptians were as tolerant of
twins in daily life as they were in their mythology,
as the following facts will show. In the reign of Amen
hetep III the whole of the monuments and temple
buildings on the west bank of the river at Thebes were
under the direction of an eminent &quot; Clerk of the Works,&quot; called Suti, and those on the east bank, including the
royal residence, were under the direction of another eminent &quot; Clerk of the Works,&quot; called Heru. These facts we learn from the stele in the British Museum (No. 475) which was found at Thebes in a tomb that
probably contained both their bodies. The principal
text on the stele is a hymn to the Sun-god, and on the
sides of this are given a few biographical details of the
two men. After describing his love of truth and his
hatred of falsehood, Heru says that &quot;his brother&quot; was
like himself in this respect, and that he &quot; came forth
from the belly with me.&quot; 1 Thus Heru and Suti were
brothers, and if the words quoted mean anything at all
it is that they were twins. Here we have a proof that
under the XVIIIth dynasty at least twins were not
regarded as a calamity, and their names, Heru and Suti,
suggest that the gods Horus and Set were held to be
the patron gods of male twins. We may now note the
usages as to twins in other parts of Africa.
In one town of the kingdom of Benin, the name of
which Miss Kingsley was unable to obtain, twins and
their mother were sacrificed to a demon who lived in a

wood near the town. In Old Benin the law was mercilessly carried out in the case of the poorer class of
natives, but wealthy people often bribed the Juju
priests, and the twins were spared. 1 Women who bore
twins or who died in child-birth were supposed to have
committed adultery with spirits.
2 In Nguru, one of the
sister provinces of Unyanyembe, twins are ordered to be
killed and thrown into water the moment they are born,
lest droughts and famines or floods should waste the
land. Should any one attempt to conceal twins, the
whole family would be murdered by the chief. In the
province of Unyanyembe, if a twin or twins die, they are
thrown into the water for the same reason as in Nguru.
When a twin dies, the mother ties a little gourd to her
neck as a proxy, and puts into it a trifle of everything
which she gives the living child, lest the spirit of the
dead twin should torment her. On the death of the child she smears herself with butter and ashes, and runs
frantically about, tearing her hair and bewailing piteously.
The men use the foulest language to her, as if in abuse
of her person, but they do so merely to frighten away
the demons who have taken the child. Speke was told
of a Myoro woman who bore twins that died, and who
kept two small pots in her house as effigies of the children,
into which she milked herself every evening, lest the
spirits of the dead should persecute her. The twins
were placed in pots, which were taken to the jungle and
placed by a tree, with the mouths downwards. 3 Among
the Matabele twins are put to death, 4 but the Senga,
Chinyai, Tuwala, and the Goa, i.e., the principal native
races of the Portuguese Zambesi, have large families,
and do not kill twins. 5 Whilst Du Chaillu was in an
Apingi village a woman gave birth to twins, and one of
the children was immediately killed, the Negroes holding
that if both twins are permitted to live the mother will
die. 6 Twins are killed among all the Niger Delta
tribes, and, in districts out of English control, the mother

226 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
too, except in Omon, where the sanctuary is. There
mothers and their twins are exiled to an island in the Cross River. In some places the mother of twins is kept
in a hut for a whole year after their birth. Then there is
a great dance, and certain ceremonies take place, during
which the mother and the doctor, not the husband, have
their legs painted white. After this the woman returns
to her ordinary avocations. When a twin dies a wooden
image is made and placed near it so that the spirit of the
dead twin may have some place to live in if it needs it.
Elsewhere Miss Kingsley found that the mother of
twins, if allowed to live, was regarded as a thing
accursed, and an outcast. She had to live by herself in
a hut, into which no one would enter, no one would eat or drink with her, or partake of the food or water which
she had cooked or fetched. Remarriage and giving
birth to a child acceptable to the natives were the only
things which could rehabilitate her. The bodies of
mothers of twins, and of women who have died in their confinement without the child being born, are cast far
into the bush, and not near the path, where the bodies of the children are thrown in order that their souls may
choose new mothers from the women who pass by. 1 In
Old Calabar twins are buried alive. 2 Among the tribes
of the Lower Niger a woman on giving birth to twins is
not allowed to touch the cooking utensils. 3
According to Major A. G. Leonard the destruction
of twins is a purely religious custom, the origin of which
is lost in antiquity. The birth of twins is regarded as
an unnatural event, which is to be ascribed solely to the
influence of malign spirits, acting in conjunction with the
power of evil. It is an offence against the ancestral
gods, and must be removed, together with the offending
cause, the woman. It implies a spirit duality, or
enforced possession by some intruding and malignant
demon, in the yielding and offending person of a
member of the household, consequently an outrage
committed upon the domestic sanctity. The natural
product of two human energies, as a single unit, is only

endowed, or provided, with one Soul-spirit. The Ibo
and Brassmen always allow the first-born twin to live,
and this custom is a practical admission of this view. In
every home in the Delta the advent of twins causes
terror, for it will provoke the anger of the gods and
bring punishment. Twins are therefore thrown into the
bush, or set adrift in rivers and creeks in roughly-made
baskets of reeds and bulrushes, where they are drowned
or devoured by sharks and crocodiles. The mothers are
considered unclean for the rest of their lives, and are
compelled to live in Twin Towns.&quot; 1
In Alladah and Whydah twins were regarded as a
sure proof of the infidelity of the mother, as the people
considered that no woman could have two children at once by one husband. The twins were thrown into the
water, and the mother impaled and her breasts cut off. 2
Among the Nandi the birth of twins is looked upon as
an inauspicious event, and the mother is considered
unclean for the rest of her life. One of the twins is always called Simatua (a kind of fig tree) and the other
receives the name of an animal. 3 On the other hand, the Bantu and the Nilotic negroes consider the birth of twins to be a very lucky
event ; among the former people it is celebrated by an
obscene dance, which, however, is only lewd in its
traditional gestures. 4 Among the Masai, Turkana,
Sak, etc., the birth of twins is considered lucky, but, at the same time, to be rather a tempting of Providence.
And the mother of twins must live away from her
husband s village for some months, and on no account go
near the kraal where the cattle are kept. One cow is
reserved for her use, and she drinks its milk. 5 The Igarra in the Niger Delta hail the birth of twins with
joy and acclamation, and it is thought to be brought
about by good and not evil spirits. The twins are
treated exactly alike, eat alike, dress alike, and are
married on the same day. It is thought that twins

cannot be poisoned, and that whilst children they can
declare the sex of an unborn child. 1 Up till 1874 twins
were brought from Cape Coast to the wells of the god
Kottor-krabah to be named by the two famous silk
cotton trees, called &quot; N ihna-attah.&quot;2 In Garenganze the
people delight in twins, and the fathers and mothers of
twins used to bring their offspring and present them to
the king. Men and women came wearing scant clothing,
and the king made them presents of cloth. Among the
Benga tribe if a twin died, a wooden image was substi
tuted in the bed or cradle box for the dead twin ; if both children die the mother must have two wooden images. In the Gabun country special ceremonies must
be performed for the safety of their lives, or, if they die, to prevent further evil. Among the Egba tribes of the
Yoruba country they become objects of worship. 3
An interesting fact in connection with twins is
reported by Speke, who says : To-day a tremendous
commotion took place in Musa s tembe amongst all the
women, as one had been delivered of still-born twins. They went about in procession, painted and adorned in
the most grotesque fashion, bewailing and screeching,
singing and dancing, throwing their arms and legs about
as if they were drunk, until the evening set in, when
they gathered a large bundle of bulrushes, and, covering
it over with a cloth, carried it up to the door of the
bereaved on their shoulders, as though it had been
a coffin. Then, setting it down on the ground, they
planted some of the rushes on either side of the entrance,
and all kneeling together, set to bewailing, shrieking,
and howling incessantly for hours together. 4
8. STEATOPYGOUS WOMEN.
The pictures of Egyptian women which are found on
the walls of tombs, etc., prove that the majority of women
in Egypt, at least of the upper classes, were slender in
figure, with long arms, hands, legs, and feet. Among

Steatopygous Women 229
the dolls and portrait figures of women which have come
down to us this type is well represented, but among
them we also find figures of women, both tall 1 and short, 2
with abnormally developed hips and thighs. In one of
the reliefs which formerly adorned the temple of
Hatshepset at Der al-Bahari, and is now in the
Egyptian Museum in Cairo, 5 the artist depicted the
King of Punt, his queen, two sons, and a daughter.
The figure of the queen, with its curved back, massive
arms and legs, and huge hips, is very remarkable, and

that of the daughter suggests that when she grew older
she would be like her mother. At one time this figure
was thought by some to be a caricature of the queen
drawn by an ill-natured Egyptian artist, but recent
investigations have proved that, so far from this being
the case, his representation of the queen is strikingly
faithful, especially when we compare it with modern
pictures of modern Steatopygous women. All that
can be said against it is that the curve of the back
is, perhaps, unduly emphasized, but, even so, the

230 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
conventional limitations imposed on the artist must be
taken into account.
The reliefs in the pyramid-chapels at Shendi, or
Shindi, represent funeral processions of women with
extraordinary girth of body and development of hip,
and the great
&quot; Candace &quot;
queens of Meroe are seen to
be even larger. They resemble in many respects the
queen of Punt, but they are taller, and their backs are
straight. In and around Shendi at the present day
many young women succeed in attaining great girth of
body by drinking milk, in which a certain herb has been
steeped, in large quantities daily, and the works of travellers contain many allusions to the great corpulency
of African beauties in all parts of the Continent. Thus
Ibn Batutah extols the beauty of the women of the
Bardamah, a Berber tribe, and says they were the
whitest and stoutest women he had ever seen. They
drink night and morning a mixture of milk and water
and crushed millet, uncooked. 1 Mungo Park says that
a woman of even moderate pretensions must be one who
cannot walk without a slave under each arm to support
her, and &quot; a perfect beauty is a load for a camel.&quot; The
girls eat large quantities of kuskus, and drink a large
bowl of camel s milk each morning, and mothers used to
beat their daughters for not eating enough. 2 Schwein
furth saw fattened women among the Bongos, whose
thighs were as large as a man s chest, and whose
measurements across the hips recalled to his mind the
&quot; Hottentot Venus &quot; in Cuvier s Atlas? Baker, describ
ing Kamrasi s retreat, says that he appeared with a great
number of women (his wives), several of whom were
carried on litters, being too fat to walk. 4 Speke visited
the chief Wazezeru and found him sitting with his wife
on a grass-strewn bench of earth, with numerous wooden
pots of milk in front of them. The lady was so
immoderately stout that she could not rise, and so large
were her arms that, between the joints, the flesh hung

down like large, loose-stuffed puddings. Waz6zeru, when
asked what they did with so many milk pots, pointing to
his wife, replied :
&quot; This is all the product of these pots ;
&quot; from early youth upwards we keep those pots to their
&quot; mouths, at it is the fashion at court to have very fat
&quot;
wives.&quot; 1 On another occasion Speke visited a sister
in-law of Rumanika and found her to be &quot; another of these wonders of obesity, unable to stand excepting on all
fours.&quot; Her measurements were : height, 5 feet 8 inches ; round arm, i foot 1 1 inches ; chest, 4 feet 4 inches ;
thigh, 2 feet 7 inches ; calf, i foot 8 inches. &quot; Meanc&amp;lt; while, the daughter, a lass of sixteen, sat stark-naked
&quot; before us, sucking at a milk-pot, on which the father
&quot;
kept her at work by holding a rod in his hand, for, as
&quot;
fattening is the first duty of fashionable female life, it
&quot; must be duly enforced by the rod if necessary.&quot;
2 The
only occupation of Kamrasi s sisters consisted in drinking
milk, each one consuming daily the produce of from ten
to twenty cows. They cannot walk, and should any one
of them wish to go and see a relative, eight men are
required to help her on to a litter. 3 Mr. J. Thomson also speaks of the &quot;
monstrously&quot; fat wives of Kapufi,
king of Karague, who were fed entirely on milk.4 This
peculiarity of the women of Central and Southern Africa
is discussed by Dr. Ploss, who quotes many authorities,
and prints a number of illustrations from drawings,
photographs, etc., and adds remarks on its physiological
aspect. 5
9. THE POISONING OF RA.
In the Legend of Ra and I sis we read that the
goddess I sis wished to become like Ra and to have
dominion over the whole universe, and that, having
meditated long on the matter, she at length decided she
could only gain the power of Ra by obtaining the know
ledge of his secret name from him. She therefore
caused the god to be bitten by a serpent, and when he

5 Das Weib, Vol. I, p. 202 f.



232 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
was in great agony he was persuaded to let his name
pass into her. The &quot;
magnificent serpent
&quot; which bit the god was fashioned by I sis out of the dust of the
ground, mixed with the saliva that fell from the mouth
of Ra, and she made it to have poison fangs, and set it
on the path by which Ra went forth each day to inspect
the heavens and the earth. When the god came forth,
accompanied by his train of gods, he passed along the
road of heaven as usual, and when he arrived at the
spot where the serpent lay coiled up waiting for him,
it reared itself up, and bit him, and drove the poison of
its body into him. 1 In placing the serpent on the path
of the Sun-god, I sis employed a stratagem which is in
use by buffalo hunters among the Banyoro at the present
day. The Chiope hunters in the north of Unyoro told
Mr. G. Wilson, the Collector of the District, that expert
hunters were in the habit of catching puff-adders in a noose. They nailed the living snake by the tip of its
tail in the middle of a buffalo track, and when a buffalo went by the snake struck at it and killed it. As many
as ten buffaloes were killed in one day in this manner.
The body of the first buffalo was discarded as being
poisoned, but the bodies of the other victims were
eaten. 2 The puff-adder attains a considerable size, for
Sir Samuel Baker saw one which, though only 5 feet
4 inches in length, was rather more than 15 inches in
girth. Its head was flat, its tail blunt, it had eight teeth,
and Sir Samuel secured five poison fangs, the two most
prominent being an inch in length. 3 When Ra had
transferred his secret name to I sis, the goddess, pre
sumably, administered to him an antidote, just as a
modern witch-woman would do, for many &quot; doctors&quot; in
Africa are well acquainted with antidotes to snake
bite. 4

The Spitting Serpent 233
in making Osiris to return to life sufficiently long to
beget Horus. An interesting modern parallel to this
story is given by Mr. Dennett, who prints a story to the
effect that Fullafulla, one of the three wives of Nenpetro,
after the death of her husband collected herbs and plants, and by their means restored him to life. The
juices of the plants and herbs were applied to his body
by her, and she, presumably, recited incantations as she
used them. It is impossible to think that the legend of
Isis and Osiris is known in West Africa, and we can only conclude that modern &quot; wise-women &quot; or &quot; witch
women &quot; claim to do what was done by Isis, the great enchantress.
ii. THE SPITTING SERPENT.
In the Eighth Section of the Book of Gates a picture
is given of a monster speckled serpent called &quot;
Kheti,&quot;
(l, with seven undulations, in each of which stands
o\\ v
a god. The mouth of the serpent is open, and through
it he belches a stream of fire into the faces of the enemies of Ra, whose arms are tied behind their backs
in agonizing positions. Horus says to the serpent : &quot; Open thy mouth, distend thy jaws, belch forth thy fire
&quot;
against the enemies of my father, burn up their bodies,
&quot; and consume their souls by the fire which issue th from
&quot;
thy mouth, and by the flames which are in thy body.&quot;
In the Book Am-Tuat (IXth Division) we also have
a group of twelve little serpents, the duty of which was
to pour out fire from their bodies, which was to light the
dead Sun-god on his way. It is easy to explain away
these creatures and their fire-spitting qualities by saying
that the word fire is only figuratively used here, and that the
pictures are merely representations of serpents shooting
out poison from their fangs. It was formerly thought
spitting serpents did not exist, and that the Egyptian
drawings were the result of the artist s imagination.
Livingstone, however, killed a serpent of the species
picakholu, which was 8 feet 3 inches long, and was so
copiously supplied with venom that it continued to distil
clear poison from the fangs for hours after its head was
cut off. He says,
&quot; This was probably that which passes



234 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
&quot; by the name of spitting serpent, which is believed to
&quot; be able to eject the poison into the eyes when the
&quot; wind favours its forcible expiration.&quot;
1 Bentley tells us
that one of the ladies of the Mission at Vivi went to look
for eggs in the fowl-house, and that she nearly put her
hand on a &quot;
spit-adder,&quot; which spat at her. The poison
entered her eyes, and for a while it was feared that she
would lose her sight ; the pain was very great. 2 The
Egyptian artist clearly had this serpent in his mind when
he drew Kheti spitting venom in the faces of the wicked.
The question of the &quot;spitting serpent&quot; is discussed by
Dr. F. Werner, who says that he saw a full-grown
specimen of the Naja Nigricollis which had been brought
to him in Gondokoro, spitting directly at his friend
Dr. Sassi. The saliva has, he says, no fatal effect on
the unbroken skin, nor on the mucous membrane of the eyes, which are, however, liable to severe inflammation,
provided that it be washed away at once. 3 Another
serpent, Naja hajae, is supposed by some to spit, but
Dr. Werner has no evidence on the subject. This
serpent is probably the &quot;asp&quot; of Cleopatra, and, no
doubt, the snake which Moses made to become rigid in
the presence of Pharaoh. Modern snake-charmers give similar exhibitions of their power over it in Egypt at the
present day.
12. THE INSECT SEPA.
In various places4 in the text of Unas there are series
of spells which were recited with the view of keeping off
from the king s body in its tomb the attacks of serpents,
scorpions, and other venomous reptiles. Among
such reptiles is mentioned the &quot;Sepa ^ -y^gg;

The variant

forms of the determinative which are placed after the
word show that the scribes had no very clear idea of the form of the Sepa, but the determinative in Unas,
1. 329, proves conclusively that Sepa was a many
legged reptile or insect, which had poison fangs, or bags,
one on each side of its vicious mouth. On submitting
a copy of this determinative to the Hon. Walter Roth
schild he at once pronounced it to represent a caterpillar
of an allied family to the South American &quot; Megalo
pygidae.&quot; He showed me a specimen of this family,
and the accuracy of the Egyptian representation of a
member of the allied family was seen to be remarkable.
The creature is about three inches long, and is covered
with a mass of orange-coloured hair, about half an inch
thick. Each hair is capable of ejecting poison into the
hand of anyone who touches it incautiously ; the contents
of even a single hair produce very severe inflammation,
whilst the discharge into the human body from many
hairs would be followed by death. These charac
teristics of the Sepa caterpillar-family enable us to
understand why the Egyptians classed it with venomous
serpents, scorpions, etc. Witch-doctors are said to make use of the poison distilled from caterpillars in their
&quot;medicines,&quot; but details of the effect of it are hard to
acquire. We may note in passing that the spells against
serpents, etc., in the text of Unas prove that when they
were written Egypt must have been overrun with
venomous snakes, reptiles, and insects, just as is the Congo Forest at the present day. Sir Harry Johnston
enumerates some of these, viz., mosquitoes, tsetse fly

(causer of sleeping sickness), sand flies, hippo flies, jiggers
or burrowing fleas, driver ants, brown ants, ants that
stink, cockroaches two inches long, locusts four inches
long, mason wasps, wasps with an almost deadly sting,
beetles, caterpillars that produce a skin disease by the slightest contact with their poisonous hairs, aromatic
bugs, shrieking locustids, pouncing crickets, mantises,
spiders, ticks, the huge Pandinus scorpion six inches long,
centipedes eight inches long, with a very poisonous
sting, and huge, but harmless millipedes. 1 The adult
millipede ejects a dark liquid which stains the hands,
and is said to be poisonous, if taken internally. 3
13. SNAKE-WORSHIP.
The Egyptians regarded certain kinds of snakes
with reverence, and their religious books contain many
allusions to them ; on the other hand, the mythological
writings show that some snakes or serpents were regarded as incarnations of evil. Among these are the
serpents the names of which are given in the text of
Unas, and several others are mentioned in the Book
Am Tuat and the Book of Gates ; but all of them appear to have been regarded as forms of the monster
serpent Apep win , which was the type of all physical
and moral evil. In short, the serpent was either a power for good or the incarnation of diabolical cunning
and wickedness. Similar views are held concerning the
serpent by modern African peoples, as the narratives of
travellers testify, and if we had sufficient information we should probably find that the snakes which were revered
in old days are revered now, and that those which were
regarded as evil beings are still so regarded. The
Book of the Dead mentions (Chapter CVIII) the
serpent Ami-hemf, which lived on the top of a mountain
and was thirty cubits3 long, and the Papyrus Golenischeff 4
also mentions a serpent thirty cubits long, which had a

beard two cubits long, and which conversed with the ship
wrecked mariner on the enchanted island. The longest
serpent now living in Africa seems to be the python,
which is, however, less than 45 feet long, as the following
instances prove. Du Chaillu s men ate a python 13 feet
long j
1 Schweinfurth saw a python 1 5 feet long ;
2
Sir Harry Johnston s longest python was 17 feet long ;
3
a python of Du Chaillu was 18 feet long;4 Mr. Hunter
Reid killed a python near Boma, the skin of which when
dry was 25 feet 2 inches long and 2 feet 7 inches wide ;
5
Bentley says the python sometimes attains a greater
length than 30 feet ; Mr. Alldridge saw a dead python
33 feet long and 6 inches in diameter, which was being carried away by a crocodile ;
6 and the longest skin
measured by Miss Kingsley, a damaged one, was
26 feet. She mentions a python which was brought
into Creek Town in the Rev. Mr. Goldie s time which must have been over 40 feet in length. 7 The Egyptians
represented certain snakes with a head at each end of
the body, 8 and Miss Kingsley mentions one serpent
which the natives declared to have &quot; a head at each
end.&quot;9 The Egyptians drew figures of serpents with
human heads and legs, and the wings of a bird, but this
is not very remarkable when we remember that even
Herodotus and Aristotle believed in &quot;
flying serpents.&quot;
Reverence is still paid to the serpent in many parts
of Africa. Thus the Dinkas revere pythons, 10 and call snakes in general their brethren &quot;
;
n they wash them
with milk and anoint them with butter. 12 The python is

the great Juju snake of the Brassmen, and their
titular guardian angel, and no Brass king would sign
a treaty with the British Government that did not
include a clause by which any European who killed
or molested a python was made liable to a fine. 1 The
Gallas pay great reverence to the serpent, which they
regard as the mother of the human race, and they in
this respect follow the example of the Pagan Ethiopians,
whose deity was a huge serpent. 2 The Bari think that
a python called Yukanye was the mother of their tribe,
and they keep tame serpents in their houses, and all
over the Blue Nile district a certain kind of python
is venerated. The Dinkas work witchcraft by means of
snakes, and the snake-magician is believed to be able to
cause his snake to injure a man, or his family, or cattle.
If a man is injured by a snake in any way, he promptly
tries to find out who is its &quot;master,&quot; so that he may
propitiate him. 3
14. THE CROCODILE.
The Egyptians reverenced the crocodile from the
earliest times, but their reverence was the result of fear, and the creature was always regarded as the incarnation
of a terribly evil power which manifested itself in the
destruction of human and animal life. The Egyptians
endeavoured to placate the Crocodile-god by means of
offerings and sacrifices, and many modern African
peoples follow their example. Shrines dedicated to
the crocodile existed in some of the cities of the Delta under the Ancient Empire, and under the Middle
Empire the cult of the creature was common in Egypt.
The Book of the Dead contains a spell (Chapter
LXXXVIII) which gave the deceased the power to
assume the form of the &quot;divine crocodile, which dwelleth in terror, and seizeth its prey,&quot; and the belief
is common in Africa at the present day that a human
spirit can take possession of a crocodile, and direct the
creature to carry out some purpose, good or bad. 4 Two

4 Kingsley, Travels in West Africa, p. 538.



The Crocodile 239
other spells (Chapters XXXI and XXXII) enabled the
deceased to drive away the four crocodiles which dwelt
in the four quarters of the world, and attacked the dead
in order to seize upon the heka, or magical powers and
words, on which they depended for existence in the
Other World. In the Book of Gates (Division IX) we
find that Apep, the monster serpent which endeavoured
to prevent the sun from rising, and the cause of storms,
whirlwinds, thunder and lightning, is accompanied by a
fiend in the form of a crocodile, which has a tail ter
minating in the head of a serpent, and is called Shesshes,
or Sessi. 1 This is, undoubtedly, the crocodile of which
figures were burnt at stated intervals on certain days, in
the great temples of Egypt, down to the Ptolemaic
Period, with the view of preventing the brewing of
storms in the skies, and of assisting the Sun-god Ra
to rise in the sky. In beliefs connected with the cult of Osiris the crocodile appears as a friend of this god
and of his son Horus, but the fact remains that the creature was held sacred in some parts of Egypt, and
was slain as a noxious reptile in others. 2 The centre of
its worship in Roman times was the city of Arsinoe
(Crocodilopolis), where the sacred crocodile was kept
by itself in a lake, and was fed with bread, flesh, and
wine by its priests ; bracelets were placed on its fore
legs, and gold ear-rings in its ears. 3 Another place
famous for the cult of the crocodile was Thebes, and reverence for it seems to have persisted in the Thebaid
till the eighteenth century of our era, for at that time the &quot; king of the crocodiles &quot; lived at Armant, eight
miles south of Thebes. 4 According to Wiedemann, 5 a
gigantic crocodile was venerated at Khartum in the
reign of Muhammad Ali. It would be interesting to
know if this crocodile was an ordinary Crocodilus niloticus, or a Slender-snouted crocodile (Crocodilus cataphractus), or a Short-headed crocodile (Crocodihis
or TflftQfl.

240 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
osteoloemus}} In size the crocodile is often over
estimated, and Sir Harry Johnston says that the biggest
his party ever shot in Uganda was 1 5 feet long. 2 The
largest measured by Miss Kingsley was 22 feet 3 inches
long, 3 and Bentley killed one which was 17 feet 6 inches
long. 4 At Dixcove and in the Lower Congo the
crocodile is worshipped, 5 and in some parts of West Africa its intelligence is believed by the natives to be
of a very high order. Thus Stanley tells us that the
chief of Ukara had a crocodile which was as docile and obedient to his master as a dog, and as intelligent as a
man. The chief coveted a pretty woman who was in
the house of Lukongeh, but could find no way of getting
possession of her. At length he told his crocodile of his
wishes, and told it to lie in wait in the rushes near
Msossi until the woman came to the lake to bathe, and
then to seize her and bring her over to him. The next
day at noon the woman was in the house of the chief of
Ukara! It was also said that Machunda, the father of Lukongeh, owned a crocodile that stole an Arab s wife
and carried her across the country to the king s house. 6
The Christian monks of Egypt made use of crocodiles,
and Palladius tells us that Apellen ordered a crocodile to
carry him across the river and that the creature did so twice.7 Among many Sudani tribes a belief in the
efficacy of the genitals of the crocodile as an aphrodisiac
is current, and portions of them are powdered and
swallowed by men who wish to be blessed with large
families. Mr. Bousfield says that the penis of the crocodile eaten with spices is considered to be the
most potent means of increasing sexual power in the
male. 8

The Use of the Net 241
15. THE USE OF THE NET IN FOWLING, FISHING, AND HUNTING.
At a very early period in their history the Egyptians
believed that the spirits of the dead, in journeying from
this world to the next, would encounter beings equipped
with nets which they used for catching unwary souls who
were travelling. To guard souls against this danger, the
priests drew up a series of spells, copies of which form
Chapters CLIIlA and C LI I IB of the Book of the Dead.
They also provided the former Chapter with the picture
of a magical net, every part of which had a magical
name, and in the accompanying text all the names are
given. Apparently souls flew through the air to their
abode in the Other World, and they were sometimes
caught in the net of the &quot;fierce fowler whose fingers are
hidden,&quot; 1 but he who was provided with the proper spells
was able to avoid him altogether, or to escape from him.
The name of this great fowler was Her-f-ha-f, or
Maa-ha-f, 2 who ferried the dead over the Egyptian
Styx, and he was assisted by the &quot;fowlers,&quot; who on
some great occasion had caught the fiends and the
Khetiu-ta in his net. The net depicted on the papyrus
was a picture of the net used by him, but if the deceased
knew the names of all its parts it would be powerless to
enmesh him. In the Book of Gates (Division IX) we
see the net being used by those who are going out to work spells on Apep and Shesshes, the enemies of Ra.
The company consists of six men, four apes, and four
women, and in front of them stand three men armed with
harpoons.
The net is employed in hunting by many African
peoples just as it was by the Egyptians. Thus, among
the Bongos, nets are used in all the battues for game, and
the people devote as much attention to the construction
of these nets as they do to the weaving of their fish

snares and basket pots. 1 The king of Toro s men were
provided with extensive nets, and they caught a large
chimpanzee in one of them, 2 and the Bantu negroes
sometimes catch antelopes in nets.3 The Sango and
Mongwandi are fond of eating monkeys and chimpanzees,
and when they go hunting, they frighten these creatures
into isolated trees, and then drive them into nets which they spread about the feet of them.4 The Ababua drive
game, with the help of dogs, into enormous nets, where
the killing takes place. 5 At Fatiko, Sir Samuel Baker
says, the favourite method of hunting was by means of
the net. Every man in the country was provided with
a net of strong cord. This was twelve yards long and
about eleven feet wide, if stretched to its maximum. The meshes were about six inches square. 6 All the Bakalai
tribes enjoy ashiga or net hunting, The nets are made of the fibre of the pineapple plant, or of the fibres of a
kind of tree, with which stout threads are mixed. They
are from sixty to eighty feet long and five feet wide, and
every village possesses several. 7
1 6. STRONG NAMES.
A king of Egypt under the Middle and New Empires
usually possessed five names, and each of these pro
claimed his strength, valour, and power. He bore the
first name as the successor of Horus, the second as the chosen one of the goddesses Nekhebit and Uatchit,
the third as the Golden Horus, the fourth as the King
of the South and North, and the fifth as the son of Ra.
The various names which are given to Rameses II may
be counted by the dozen, and the custom of giving such
&quot; mighty names &quot; to the king of Egypt finds its parallel
in the custom which is widespread among many modern
African peoples of calling the chief or king by &quot;
strong
names.&quot; Thus the king of the Bavili has seven titles, one

Strong Names 243
of which he does not receive until after his death. 1 Among the &quot;
strong names &quot; of Daho, the &quot;
Omniscient,&quot;
king of Dahomey, 1625 1650, were &quot;
Donun,&quot; the
all-wise,&quot;
&quot;
Akwazhu,&quot;
&quot; the leveller of his enemies,&quot; etc.
Gezu, 1818 1858, had many strong names, among
them being :
Bodun-ganu-minh, i.e.,
&quot; fetish conquering every
thing.&quot;
Eganu-menseh-Minhwe Gezu, &quot; he conquered all his
enemies, so everybody comes to Gezu.&quot;
Gan kaka de jeh,
&quot; a conqueror for whom everybody
will wait.&quot;
Vokhe Mau, &quot; the scarlet bird of the gods.&quot;
2
Among the titles of Gelele, the successor of Gezu,
were :
Glere, &quot;heavy,&quot; i.e., the &quot;
king who cannot be
moved.&quot;
Kini-kini-kini, &quot; dragon with claws,&quot;/ .*.,
&quot; he tears all
in pieces.&quot;
Tenge makan fenkpon,
&quot; rock, finger-nail cannot
scratch it.&quot;
Ahorsu Yemabu, &quot;
Shadow-king,&quot; i.e., &quot;he who will
never be lost in his kingdom.&quot;
3
The king of Dahomey is double, not merely binony
mous, nor dual, like the spiritual Mikado and the
temporal Tycoon of Japan, but two in one ; he is king
of the city, and he is king of the Bush, i.e., of the farmer
folk and of the country as opposed to the city. This
Bush-king, Addokpon, though a wholly imaginary person,
enjoys all the pomp and state of a real king. The Bush
king double of Gelele had his palace at Akpwe-ho, a
few miles from Abomey, on the Toffo road, an official
mother, a chief executioner, a master of ceremonies, male
and female officers, eunuchs, and wives. And a number of criminals and victims were set apart to be slain at this
Bush-king s So-Sin Customs. The idea of the Bush
king is said to have been evolved by Gezu, the father of

Gelele, for the purpose of enabling the king to trade
and to carry on commercial enterprises ; but evidence in
support of this view is wanting. The idea of the
&quot;double&quot; is a very ancient one in Africa, as we have
seen, and it has always been there. The existence of
the Horus name among the ancient Egyptians proves
that the king had a special
&quot;
double,&quot; which must have
been supposed to exercise sovereignty in some way, and
to have been honoured by the people as a king. An
interesting passage occurs in the LXXXVth Chapter
of the Book of the Dead which seems to indicate that the deceased expected to have two existences, one as a
dweller in the city, and the other as a dweller in the
country. He says :
&quot;
I am a young man in the city, and
a youth in the country ; as for my name, my name is
the * Imperishable one. )J1
17. THE ELECTION OF A KING.
On the Stele of the Coronation3 is an account of the
election of the Nubian king Aspelta. Four groups of
officials assembled with the Royal Brethren who were
eligible for the throne, and introduced them into the
presence of the god Amen-Ra of Napata, who, however, selected none of them. They then introduced Aspelta
by himself to the god, who at once &quot;
selected,&quot; i.e.,
touched him, and declared him to be the man whom he had chosen to be king, and the officials and all the
people at once accepted him as their lord. A modern
parallel to this election is found in Uganda. On the
death of the king, the Katikiro, or chief officer of state,
at once summons the Kasuja, or Keeper of the Princes,
and in the presence of the chiefs asks him who among
the Princes is most qualified to reign. Having given
his opinion, the chiefs order him to collect the Princes.
When this is done he forms them up into line, and

Pottery Made by Hand 245
touches one of them with his hand, and the prince so
touched becomes at once king of Uganda, and makes all
arrangements for the burial of the dead king. 1
1 8. POTTERY MADE BY HAND.
During the Predynastic Period and the early
dynasties the Egyptians made their pottery, even the
largest vessels, by hand, and the use of the potter s
wheel appears to have been unknown. Their skill in
this craft was remarkable, and the proportions of the
vessels which they turned out are so true, and the
circular shapes so exact, that it is sometimes almost
impossible to believe that they did not employ some
mechanical means in their pottery work. Many modern
peoples in Central Africa possess similar skill in the craft
of the potter, e.g., the Dyoor, of whose work Schweinfurth says :
&quot; It is remarkable how they manage with
the mere hand to turn out immense vessels which, even to
a critical eye, have all the appearance of being made on
a wheel. 2 Among the Bongos the women, without
the help of any turning-wheel, succeed in producing
most artistic specimens of pottery. The larger water
bottles are sometimes a yard in diameter. Handles are
uniformly wanting, and to compensate for this want,
their whole outer surface is made rather rough by being
ornamented by a number of triangles and zig-zag lines,
which form all manner of concentric and spiral patterns.
The gourd-platters and bottles are generally decorated
with different dark rows of triangles. 3 In all Congoland
the potter s wheel is unknown ; all pottery is made by
hand, and women are the potters. In the west beautiful
and elaborate designs and careful choice of colours and
materials make their appearance : this is probably due
to the influence of the Sudani peoples in the north and
of the early Portuguese. 4 The only implements used by
the Nandi in pottery making are : The handle of a hoe,
which is employed for pounding and stirring the clay,

246 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
the shoulder-blade of an ox, a stone, a seed pod, some
plaited grass, and three pieces of straw, with which the
pots are smoothed and ornamented. 1 At Stanley Pool
the natives had no idea of the potter s wheel, but putting
a piece of calabash under a lump of clay, to make it turn
freely, they very deftly turn it round slowly by hand,
and make some very thin regular ware. It is hard some
times to realize that the articles have not been &quot; thrown &quot; on the wheel, so round are they, and even. 2 The Obbo
people have no knowledge of the potter s wheel, and
the circular form is obtained entirely by hand. 3 The
Bubis of Fernando Po also make their pottery without a
wheel. 4 Of native pottery in general Dr. Livingstone says :
&quot; The pots for cooking, holding water and beer,
&quot; are made by the women, and the form is preserved by
&quot; the eye alone, for no sort of machine is ever used.&quot; 5
19. FINGER-NAILS.
In one of the Chapters of the Daily Cult6 which
deals with the placing of the hands on the coffer to
&quot; make purification,&quot; the priest declares to the god that
he has &quot;done away,&quot; i.e., cut, his nails, in imitation of
Thoth, who, on a certain occasion, cut his nails. These words show that the cutting or cleansing of the nails
was an important act in making the body of the priest
ceremonially pure. What exactly was the idea which underlay this act of purification cannot be said, but its importance is evident. In connection with this it is interesting to note that the cannibal Makarakas, among
other cleanly habits, include that of keeping the finger
nails tidy. 7
20. FIGURES AND COUNTING.
The Egyptians counted from one to nine by means of
short strokes, and they had signs for ten n, hundred @,

Figures and Counting 247
thousand JL ten thousand Y hundred thousand ^^,
million 3r, and ten million Q ; thus it is clear that they
could count up to very large numbers. The modern Baganda are also skilled arithmeticians, for before the
Europeans entered their country they had developed the
expressions for numerals, and used a decimal system of
calculation. They have words for every multiple of ten
up to twenty millions. 1 Among the Egyptians the
number seven appears to have represented completeness,
for we have the Seven Hathors, the Seven Ants, the
Seven Cows and their Bull, the Seven Spirits, the Seven
Uraei, the Seven-headed Serpent, etc. The number
nine also seems to represent finality and completeness,
and the Companies of the Gods each contained nine
members. And we have Nine Mourners, Nine Watchers, Nine Smeriu, Nine Task-masters, Nine Followers of
Osiris, Nine Holders of the Rope for measuring land, etc.
Among modern African peoples the number nine is
regarded as sacred. When a man is killed by lightning
in Uganda nine witches are sent for, who surround the
body. 2 When Lukedi became king, he killed nine fowls,
nine cows, nine old women and nine young women, and
he made nine loads of beads into a head-dress, which he
wore. 3 A magician works magic by means of nine kauri
shells sewn on to a strip of leather, with which he makes
the sign of the Cross. 4 In the Okijun country a fair is
held every ninth day. 5 A woman does not work in the
fields for nine days after the birth of her child. 6 Gelele
was, according to his reckoning, the ninth king of the
Dahoman dynasty, and at the Sin Kwain Custom he
made nine stools, nine hammocks, nine flags, and nine
swords to march in procession. 7 The number 1 10 seems
to have possessed some special significance, and the
Egyptians regarded it as the utmost limit of a man s

life. 1 Thus in a papyrus2 mention is made of some
person who lived upon earth no years, and Nefer
Renpet, in a prayer cut on a libation tank in the British
Museum, entreats the gods to allow him to live 1 10 years
r (P
| , provided that they give him health and strength
to enjoy them. 3 In connection with this number may be
mentioned the custom in West Africa of giving a man
who has committed some serious offence no lashes with
a whip. Thus Du Chaillu commuted the punishment of
death to a flogging of no lashes in the case of one
Boulay who had tried to poison him. 4 Whether the
Egyptians believed in certain numbers being lucky and
others unlucky cannot be said, but it is probable that
they did, and that they used numbers in divining.
Among modern diviners by means of numbers may be
mentioned the Nandi, who regard 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 as
lucky, especially 3 and 5, and i, 4, 6, 7, and 9 as
unlucky ;
5 the most unlucky number is i and the least so
is 4.
21. TIME, THE YEAR, SEASONS, ETC.
The Egyptians divided the year into three seasons,
each containing four months ; each month contained
thirty days, or three weeks of ten days each. 6 Five
intercalary days were added to make up a year of 365 days. They conceived of very long periods of
time, e.g.,
if I = tens of millions of years.
JcAl = one million of millions of millions of years.
1 Egyptians sometimes attained to a great age, perhaps actually to
no years, for Ankh-p-Khart tells us that he ministered in a temple for
80 years, and when he died he must have been 100 years old, or more. See his statue in the British Museum, No. 820.

3 Central Saloon, No. 605 (Guide, p. 167).
4 Adventures in Equatorial Africa, p. 245.
5 Hollis, Nandi, p. 89.
6 In late times the year consisted of 12 months, each month con
taining 29 days, or 4 weeks of 7^ days each, and a supplementary
month of 17 \ days (equal i decade and i week). See Daressy, La
Semaine des gyptiens in Annales du Service, Vol. X, pp. 21-23, 180, 182.



Time, the Year, Seasons 249
In early Dynastic times each year was named by the
most important event which took place in it. The
Mandingoes in Mungo Park s day also distinguished
each year by a particular name, founded on some remark
able occurrence which happened in that year. Thus
they say, &quot;the year of the Farbanna war,&quot; and the
&quot;year of the Kaarta war,&quot; the &quot;year in which Gadou
was plundered,&quot; etc. They calculate their years by the
rainy seasons, of which there is one in each year. 1
Among many modern African peoples the year is divided
into three seasons. Thus the Yorubas have Ewo-erun,
&quot; dry season &quot;
; Ewo-oye, &quot; season of the Harmathan
wind &quot;
; and Ewo-ojo, &quot;
rainy season&quot; ; and each of their
months contains six weeks of five days each, from which,
however, they deduct twelve hours. 2 The Bavili year is
divided into three parts, which contain one month, four
months, and eight months respectively3
; they are called
Mawalala, Xicifu, and Mvula. These three parts contain
six seasons, each of two months, which are called Mwici
(smoke), Bunji (mist), Mvumvumvu (drizzle), Waw
Waw Waw (rains), Nvula Nxentu (female rains), Nvula
Mbakala (male rains). 4 In Speke s time the Baganda
reckoned only five months to the year, 5 and only recently
has time been divided into years in Uganda. 6 The
Egyptians gave names to each month, to each day of the
month, and to each hour of the day and night, and some
modern African peoples do likewise. 7 Our information
about the divisions of time in use among modern Sudani
folk is scanty, for the older travellers paid no attention to the matter. In the Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days the
Egyptians divided the day into three parts, but it is not
clear whether each part contained four or eight hours, i.e., whether they included the night in the day or not.
Many African peoples divide the day into three parts, 8

i.e., into morning, mid-day, and evening, and, like the
Egyptians, further subdivide it, when necessary, into
parts which are distinguished by the sun s place in the
heavens. 1
22. ASTRONOMY.
Under the Ancient Empire the Egyptians had very
little knowledge of astronomy in the true sense of the
word, and the stars were regarded by them as divine
spirits round which the souls of the blessed collected.
In the Pyramid Texts two classes of stars are clearly
distinguished, the Akhemu seku, or &quot;imperishable stars,&quot;
and the Akhemu urtchu, the &quot;stars which never rest.&quot; The heavens were divided into four parts, and the stars
were classed as &quot;northern&quot; and &quot;southern.&quot; Among
the former they placed the constellation Mesekhti, the
Great Bear, and among the latter the constellation of
Orion and Sirius, or Sothis. The northern stars were associated in a certain degree with Set, Orion held the
soul of Horus, and Sirius was identified with Isis. Venus as an evening and morning star was well known,
and one at least of the planets, and some of the stars mentioned in the Pyramid Texts were afterwards included among the Thirty-six Dekans. The moon was
the great &quot;Runner,&quot; khens J!L.A, of the night-sky,
and was in early times associated with Thoth ; in later
times it was regarded as the abode of Osiris. 2 The Sun
and the Moon were the two great eyes of the Sky-god,
the former being his right eye and the latter his left.
Under the New Empire the Egyptians knew the five
planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter, 3 and
drew up lists of the Thirty-six Dekans, and made star
maps of a limited character. On monuments of the

Astronomy 251
Ptolemaic Period we find lists of the Signs of the Zodiac
and pictures of their gods.
Modern African peoples pay little attention to the
heavenly bodies in general, and travellers have, as a rule, surprisingly little to tell us of their views con
cerning them. Sir Harry Johnston says that beyond
a slight interest in the sun or moon the Negro race, as
contrasted with the Asiatic or European, takes little
notice of the heavenly bodies. The average native of
Uganda takes little or no interest in the stars. The
Baganda know the Great Bear, and their name for it
means &quot;six stars&quot;; Orion they call the three stars.
Sirius is simply
&quot;
Munyenye,&quot; or &quot; the star.&quot; 1 The
Bakongo regard Venus and Jupiter as the spouses of the
moon.^ Rumanika asked Speke &quot; if the same sun we
&quot; saw one day appeared again, or whether fresh suns
&quot; came every day, and whether or not the moon made
&quot; different faces, to laugh at us mortals on earth.&quot; 3
Pingiro, chief of Nindo, asked Decle if there were two
suns, one which went to bed one evening, and another
which got up next day. 4 When Mungo Park asked the
Mandingoes what they thought became of the sun
during the night, they considered the question childish,
for they had never thought out the matter, and the
subject seemed to them to be beyond human investiga
tion. The Nandi think that the sun retires into his scabbard at night time, and returns by a different road
to his home in the east ; and when the moon disappears
she is supposed to fall, and to go home by a different
road. When there is no moon the people say that the
sun has killed his wife. 5 The moon has attracted the notice of the natives of Africa more than any other heavenly body, and most of
their religion and religious ceremonies are grouped about
it. The new moon to them is a newly created thing, or
a resurrection of its old body, and a new embodiment of
the moon s spirit. To the African everywhere it has

252 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
always been the symbol of new birth, new life, growth
development, and power. Many peoples in West, South,
and Central Africa salute its appearance reverently, and
Pagans as well as Muslims say a short prayer when they
see its crescent in the sky at sunset for the first time
each month. The prayer said, they spit upon their hands
and rub them over their faces. Work of all kinds,
especially that connected with agriculture, and journeys
are undertaken during the waxing moon, and marriages
are performed, and circumcision festivals are celebrated
during this period. No work of any importance is begun
during the moon s last quarter, 1 when mourning festivals
are celebrated. 2 The institution of a general day of rest
among the Yorubas and many other peoples in Africa
and elsewhere is probably to be referred to moon-worship.
Originally the first day of the new moon was observed as
a day of rest, a holy day sacred to the moon. When
the month was divided into weeks, the first day of each
week, i.e., of each phase of the moon, was also regarded
as holy. As the Mendis do no work on the first day of
the month, saying that if they did the rice and corn would
frow
red, the day of the new moon being &quot;a day of
lood,&quot; Colonel Ellis thinks that they at one time
offered human sacrifices to the new moon. 3 As the
African developed anthropomorphic conceptions of gods
moon-worship decayed, but the new moon is still treated
with reverence in most parts of Africa, and its appearance
is celebrated with festivals, dancing, music, and joyful entertainments of all kinds.
23. THE PILLOW OR HEAD-REST, ^.
The Egyptians often placed in their tombs head-rests,
or &quot;pillows,&quot; on which the heads of the dead rested, and they often attached to mummies small models of the
pillow, made of haematite and other substances, which
were supposed to possess the power of &quot;lifting up
&quot; their
heads. A large collection of pillows in wood, ivory, etc.,

is exhibited in the Third Egyptian Room, and there are
many pillow-amulets in the Fourth Egyptian Room, of the
British Museum. In the Papyrus
of Ani the pillow appears as one of the three chief amulets, the other two being the backbone of
Osiris, u, and a portion of the
body of I sis, m. It forms the
vignette of Chapter CLXVI of
the Book of the Dead, and the
text suggests that it not only
raised up the head, but prevented Egyptian Pillow.
it from being carried off. The
modern African peoples also use head-rests made of
wood, etc., which closely resemble those of the Egyptians ;
for illustrations of these see Bentley, Pioneering on the
Congo, Vol. I, p. 309, and Johnston, George Grenfell, Vol. II, pp. 745-748.
24. THE DANCE OF THE GOD.
In the chapter on Osiris and dancing it has already
been stated that most of the chief African peoples regard
ceremonial dancing before a god as an act of worship.
Allusion has already been made to the pygmy who was
brought from the Sudan to Egypt, and who knew how to
dance the &quot;dance of the god,&quot; the &quot;god&quot; being, pre
sumably, Osiris, and we are justified in assuming that this
&quot;god&quot; had his own special dance, which was not
generally known in Egypt. There is certainly some
good reason for the statement that the pygmy knew the
dance of the &quot;god.&quot; With this we may compare a
remark of Colonel Ellis, who says :
&quot; On the Gold and Slave Coasts, every god of note has his own dance, which
is sacred to him, and is known only to the initiated.&quot; 1
25. UNDER-WORLD.
The Egyptian Book of Gates and the Book Am-Tuat
suggest that some parts of the Other World were supposed

254 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
to be underground, and the entrances to these, with the
Porters or Doorkeepers, seem to indicate that the artists
who drew the pictures of them were well acquainted with the fact that certain tribes lived in underground dwellings.
Some modern African peoples live underground, and Livingstone, describing the underground houses in Rua,
says they are very extensive, ranging along mountain
sides for twenty miles, and in one part a rivulet flows
inside. 1 He also speaks of underground store-houses in
Kabiure, in the range called Kakoma. 2 There are also underground houses in the Oasis of Khargah, to which
for generations the people have been in the habit of
driving their cattle, and in which the people themselves
have taken refuge, when attacked by the desert Arabs.
I visited them in 1909 and found them well stocked with grain, and women, goats, and children living in them
contentedly. The light of lamps and fires added a
weirdness to the scene, which might well serve as a base
for an imaginary Under-world, like the Ipo-oku of the
Yorubas, 3 where the spirits of the dead lived and continued their existence which they had begun in the flesh on earth.
26. MAGICAL FIGURES IN STEATITE.
In connection with what has been said about macncal
o
figures and figures of ancestors, it may be noted that
small steatite figures are sometimes dug up in various
parts of the Sherbro Hinterland, and that the people
ascribe magical powers to them. They make offerings of
flour to them, and then consult them about expeditions,
wars, the crops, and the acquisition of wealth. Each
figure, or devil, is in command of many spirits, who carry
out his orders. If a figure is set on a small bamboo stool, within a little palm leaf shrine, in a secret place near a
crop, it is believed that the crop will be doubled. If such
a figure is acquired by theft its powers are supposed to
be increased. 4

Incense 255
27. INCENSE.
Among the Egyptians of all periods one of the most
important ceremonies was the burning of incense. Each
substance used in the composition of incense was
supposed to possess magical properties, and the smell
produced by burning them together was believed to be
much liked by the gods. The smoke was thought to
form a material vehicle on which the words of the prayers
recited by the worshipper would mount up to heaven, and
when they reached the divine being to whom they were
addressed, the odour of the incense which accompanied
them caused him to receive them graciously, and to grant
the suppliant his petition. And this was not all, for a
passage in the Pyramid Text of Pepi II shows that the
soul of the dead man ascended into heaven by means of
the incense which was burnt on his behalf. The passage reads :
11 The father of Pepi Nefer-ka-Ra is Shu.
&quot; The mother of Pepi Nefer-ka-Ra is Tefnut.
&quot; They draw up Pepi Nefer-ka-Ra to heaven, to
heaven,
&quot; On the flame of the incense. 1
&quot;
Pepi Nefer-ka-Ra is pure.
&quot;
Pepi Nefer-ka-Ra liveth.
&quot;
Pepi Nefer-ka-Ra maketh his seat, behold,
Osiris.&quot;
An interesting modern parallel to this old idea is
given by Livingstone. A fire broke out at Hara, the
night after he left that place, and destroyed the village,
including the goods, beads, guns, powder, cloth, etc., of
one Hames. The news reached Livingstone s camp the
next morning, and prayers were at once offered up for
Hames, and some incense burnt. The Muslims held
their prayer book (Kur an ?) in the smoke of the incense
whilst the responses were being said. 2 Thus all the
1 *=^
Last Journals, Vol. I, p. 233. S2



256 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
prayers of the book were despatched to heaven on the
wings of the burning incense, and the suppliants believed
that they must be heard by God.
28. SITTING ON THE SHOULDERS.
In the Pyramid Text of Pepi I we read :
Pepi cometh forth into heaven.
He findeth Ra. Standing upright, 1 he meeteth him. He seateth himself on his shoulders.
Ra will not permit him to descend to the
ground,
For behold, he knoweth that Pepi is greater than he.
Pepi is more spirit than the spirits (khu
More perfect than the perfect (dqeru M
More stable than the stable ones (ichem
And in the Pyramid Text of Pepi II it is said, &quot;
Pepi
Nefer-ka-Ra hath seated himself on thy shoulder,
Osiris.&quot;3 Thus we see that the kings of Egypt when
they arrived in heaven were supposed to mount on the
shoulders of both Ra and Osiris. The wording of the
texts makes it clear that no allusion to the embracing
of the king by these gods is meant, and it is quite
clear that we are intended to understand that he seated himself on their shoulders. The idea seems strange
until we remember that among many peoples in Africa
chiefs and their wives are in the habit of travelling on
the shoulders of their attendants from one place to
another. Thus Sir Samuel Baker tells us that the chief
1 I.e., Pepi meets Ra as an equal, he does not bow before him.
2 Pepi I, 1. 91 = Meri-Ra, 1. 120 = Pepi II, 1. 698.



Red Body Colouring 257
Katchiba was in the habit of travelling upon the back
of a very strong subject,
&quot;
precisely as children are wont
&quot; to ride pick-a-back. He generally had two or three
&quot;
spare men, who alternately acted as guides and ponies,
&quot; while one of his wives invariably accompanied him,
&quot; bearing a large jar of beer.&quot; 1 When Livingstone was
at Hara, &quot;a daughter of Nsama came this afternoon to
&amp;lt;( be a wife and cementer of the peace ! She came
&quot;
riding pick-a-back on a man s shoulders ; a nice,
&quot; modest, good-looking young woman, her hair rubbed all
&quot; over with nkola, a red pigment, made from camwood,
&quot; and much used as an ornament.&quot; 2
29. RED BODY COLOURING.
The wall paintings in Egyptian tombs, etc., often
contain representations of men whose bodies are coloured
red, and in papyri containing vignettes of the Book
of the Dead the body of Osiris is frequently given this
colour. From these it is clear that the Egyptians were in the habit of painting their bodies with red pigment,
and many modern Africans follow their example at the
present day. Thus among the Shilluks the poor anoint
themselves with unguents with which wood-ashes are
mixed, and their colour becomes grey ; the landowners,
or men of position, mix the ashes of cow-dung with
their unguents, and when smeared with them their
bodies have a dusky-red tint, like the &quot; hue of red
devils.&quot; 3 The Manbattu use a &quot;
beauty-paint
&quot; made
of the red powder of camwood, which is mixed with fat,
and is rubbed over the whole body. The Niam-Niam also use a similar paint, which they apply to their bodies
in spots and stripes ; they stain red all their faces and
breasts to increase the ferocity of their appearance. 4
The Acholi smear their whole bodies with red paint and
fat. 5 The Baris paint their bodies with a pigment made
of oxide of iron and grease, and give
&quot; themselves the

appearance of new red bricks.&quot; 1 The Baris pulled
down the house built by the devoted Austrian
missionaries, and having pounded and ground the
bright red bricks of which it was built into powder,
they mixed it with grease, and smeared their bodies with
the mixture, and so &quot; the house of God was turned into
pommade divine. &quot; 2 The Nuers also stain their bodies
red, 3 and the Mbichos rub their bodies all over with oils and red earth. 4 The people of Makalumbi use large
quantities of red powder and oil in dressing their hair, 6
and the Taveta maidens smear themselves with red earth and fat. 6
30. THE TORTOISE.
Among the Egyptians the tortoise was regarded as
one of the personifications of evil, and the creature itself
was classed with crocodiles, serpents, and other noxious
creatures. In the Book of the Dead the death of the tortoise is followed by the living of Ra, and in
Chapter CLXI the deceased says,
&quot; Ra liveth, the
tortoise dieth.&quot; How the tortoise came to be associated with Thoth and the four winds of heaven, which are referred to in this Chapter, cannot be explained. In
another place (Chapter LXXXIII) the deceased says,
&quot; I have dressed myself like the tortoise.&quot; The tortoise
has an evil reputation among the Baganda, for they
believe that the monster python Bemba, one of their
mythical kings, was slain by the guile of Enfudu, the
tortoise. 7 One of the ways of celebrating the making
of peace after a war is to kill a tortoise with blows of a
club. 8 Among the Fjort the tortoise is associated with
the fire which came from heaven. 9

Tree-worship 259
31. THE PRIMITIVE VILLAGE.
The Egyptian determinative for village, or town, or
any inhabited district, is , i.e., a circular enclosure
surrounded by a wall, with two main streets at right
angles to each other. Many modern villages in West
Africa have this shape and arrangement of streets, e.g.,
the Usimbi villages, Wenya and others, at Stanley
Falls. 1 The villages of the Kavirondo are circular, have
fences all round, and the cattle are brought in each night
and the gates are shut. 2
32. DECORATION OF Bows OF BOATS.
In the vignette to Chapter CXXXIII of the Book
of the Dead we see Ra, the Sun-god, seated in his boat,
from the bows of which hangs a sort of rectangular mat,
with a bird perched on the top. The mat appears to
be fringed. What seems to be a parallel to this is
furnished by Stanley, who describes an Aruwimi war
canoe, and tells us that from its bow streamed a thick fringe of the long white fibre of the Hyphene palm. 3
33. TREE-WORSHIP.
The Egyptians believed that certain deities took up
their abode in trees, and several trees were regarded
by them as sacred. Thus, in Heliopolis, there was the
famous Persea tree, near which lived the Great Cat which cut off the head of the serpent of darkness, 4 and
the god Sepes lived in a tree. 5 The god Ra appeared
each morning from between two sycamore trees of
turquoise, 6 and there was also in Heliopolis an olive (?)
tree which was closely associated with Horus. 7 The
goddesses Nut and Hathor lived in trees, and a vignette
shows us the former giving bread and water to the

deceased, as he kneels by the stream on which the tree
is planted. 1 In the celestial Heliopolis stood the sacred
tree on the leaves of which Thoth and Sesheta wrote the names of kings and of the blessed dead. 2 This is, of course, the original of the Sidr, or Lote tree of
Paradise, which the Muslims say contains as many
leaves as there are human beings in the world, and
that on each leaf the name of one human being is
written. The cult of trees is common among many
modern African peoples, some of whom regard tree-spirits
as very powerful beings. Thus the Masai worship the
spirits of the Subugo tree, and of the Retete tree,
which is a species of parasitic fig. They propitiate
these by killing a goat, and by bringing blood in a
calabash and pouring it over the base of the tree trunk. 3
The cult of trees by the Masai is associated with the
reverence which is paid to grass as a sacred symbol,
and the &quot;
Laibanok,&quot; or sorcerers, pluck grass before
they perform any of their magical ceremonies. 4 Near
the Karuma Falls is a tree in which lives a spirit that
is supposed to gratify the powers and pleasures of men
and women who summon its presence in the form
appropriate to each. 5 Among the Gallas the Woda is
esteemed holy, and under its shadow sacrifices and
prayers are offered up to the exalted spirit who
dwells in it. Of the greatest sanctity is the tree Worka
{Ficus sycamorus], at Woda Nabi, by the River Hawash,
where each year the Gallas offer up a great sacrifice to
their deity Waka, and pray, saying :
&quot; O Wak, give
us children, tobacco, corn, cows, oxen and sheep.
Preserve us from sickness, and help us to slay our
enemies who make war upon us, the Sidama (Christians)
and the Islama (Muslims). O Wak, take us to thee,
lead us into the garden, lead us not to Setani, and
not into the fire.&quot; 6 The priests of this tree are called
&quot;
Lubas,&quot; as opposed to the medicine-men, or sorcerers,
who are called &quot;
Kalijas.&quot; The Camante perform their

Tree-worship 261
religious ceremonies in dense forests, where they are said to pay particular reverence to the Cactus tree,
ascribing to it a reasonable soul, and believing that the
human race are sprung from it. 1 In the Camma
country the people venerate a mighty tree which they
call &quot; Oloumi.&quot; Its bark is said to possess healing
properties, and if a man washes himself in a decoction
of it it is thought that he will be lucky and shrewd in
making bargains. 2 In every I bo community sacred
trees and tree deities and spirits are to be found. The
Efik people sacrifice a goat and a fowl each year to the tree called &quot;
Parando,&quot; and they present to it yams,
plantains, and nimbo-tree wine. At Ogbe-abri lives the
Tree-god Ani ; at Isiskme is a grove sacred to Ede-mili,
the Crop-god ; Ofo, the god of justice and truth on the
Niger, lives in the tree Ofo ; and Osisi, a form of Ofo,
lives in a tree. In Brass, when the Liana creeper is cut
down, the natives have to perform expiatory ceremonies.
In Southern Nigeria the Blood-plum tree is venerated.
The Yorubas venerate the Aluki, a sort of prickly
pear, and Asorin, the &quot; father of trees,&quot; and the Ayan
tree, and the Apa tree. 3 An account of a remarkable
ceremony given by an eye-witness is quoted by Sir
Harry Johnston. During a period of hunger a number
of the Basoga came in canoes to a very fine specimen
of a tree of the Parinarium species, which rose to the
height of a hundred feet above the ground before giving
out branches. The tree was surrounded by small fetish
huts, and curious arcades, and umbrellas of straw. When the Basoga arrived at the base of the tree, they removed
all their clothing, and wrapped ropes made of creepers
round their arms and necks, and began to dance whilst
songs were sung. After a time a little girl ten years old
was brought, and laid at the base of a tree, and every
action connected with slaying a sacrifice was gone
through ; and a slight incision was made in her neck.
She was then thrown into a lake close by, but was saved
from drowning by a man who stood ready to rescue her.

262 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
The child was afterwards dedicated to a life of virginity.
All this took place near Luba in Western Busoga. 1
34. THE THRONE.
Egyptian hymns to Osiris, and those which relate to
him and his successor Horus, lay great stress upon the
fact that Horus inherited his father s throne, and sitting
on it ruled the world. Thus in the Book of the Dead we have :
&quot; Thy throne hath descended to thy son Horus &quot;
(Chapter CLXXV, 1. 14).
&quot; Horus, his son, is seated upon the throne of the Dweller in the Lake of Fire as
his heir. . . . Horus is stablished upon his throne&quot;
(ibid., 11. 20, 21). &quot;Thy son Horus is triumphant. . . .
The throne of Keb hath been adjudged to him, together
with the rank which was established by Temu, and
ordered by decree in the Library, and recorded on
a tablet according to the command of Ptah-Tanen.&quot;
(Chapter CLXXXIII, 1. 12, f.). The throne of Horus
passed naturally to his representative on earth, i.e.,
to the king of Egypt, and from time immemorial in Africa the possession of the royal or tribal-chiefs
throne has been regarded as synonymous with the
possession of the sovereignty over a country or district.
The original throne of Osiris, as we have seen, probably
contained portions of his body, and as long as these
were preserved in it, his son Horus enjoyed the
protection and power which they transmitted to the
mystic seat, i.e., he was under the direct influence of
the great ancestral spirit. When the first king of Egypt sat upon that throne the spirit of Horus, as well
as that of Osiris, protected and inspired him, and the
divine power which these gods conferred upon him, by
virtue of his succession to their sovereignty, gave to
his words and deeds an authority which was divine and
absolute. At certain periods in Egyptian history the
people, from the highest to the lowest, regarded the king
as god as well as king, and as the master of their
lives, and bodies, and souls, and property. No one
could sit upon the throne of Horus as king without the
god s permission, and out of this belief grew up in
1 Johnston, Uganda, Vol. II, p. 719.



The Throne 263
Africa the idea of the divine right of kings. The oldest
throne of Osiris was probably made of wood, but in
late times fine alabaster, costly stone and metal, bronze,
gold, etc., which were sometimes inlaid, were also
employed. In the kingdom of Nubia the royal throne
was made of gold, and in the inscription of Nastasen we
are told that, after sacrificing two bulls, this king
&quot; went up and sat on the Golden Throne in the Golden
Chamber, under the shadow of the great royal fans.&quot;
1
This he did at Napata. He then went to the city
of Per- Kern, and having paid homage to Amen he
went up and sat on the golden throne ; this act
conferred upon him the sovereignty of that part of
Nubia of which Per-Kem was the capital. He also
went to P-nubs, the capital of another province, and
went up and sat on the golden throne which was
preserved there. Mention is also made by Nastasen
that he went into an underground chamber and lay there
for four nights, and that, having made offerings of all
kinds to Amen and sacrificed two bulls, he went into the temple and took his seat upon the &quot; seat of state &quot; which
was in the &quot; Chamber of the Throne.&quot; From the Book of the Dead we learn that the beatified in the Other World also possessed throne chambers with seats in them, for
the XLVIIth Chapter is a spell the recitation of which
prevented the &quot;throne chamber and the throne,&quot;
J
? from being taken away from them. 2
The importance of the tribal throne, which is one of
the abodes of the ancestral spirit, is clearly recognized
by modern African peoples. Thus the throne of Unyoro
was very ancient, and had been in existence for many
generations. It is quite a small object, and is made of
copper and wood, and is regarded as a u
cojoor,&quot;or
talisman. The throne, and a very ancient drum, &quot; which
is considered with reverence as something uncanny,&quot; are
always jealously guarded by special soldiers, and are
1 For the text see Lepsius, Denkmaler, Band V, Plate 16.
2 We may note, in passing, the &quot;stark-naked people,&quot; the Wakidi,
mentioned by Speke, who live up in trees, and have small stools fixed
on behind, always ready for sitting upon. See Journal of the Discovery
of the Source of the Nile, p. 81, Dent s reprint.



264 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
seldom used. Should the throne be lost or stolen, the
authority of the king would disappear, together with
the talisman, and disorder would reign throughout the
country until the precious object should be restored. 1 Nothing can happen in Unyoro without the order of the
king. The superstitious veneration for the possession of
the magic throne produces a profound obedience. 2 It
was on this throne that Kamrasi sat when Baker visited him, and on that occasion it rested upon a carpet of
leopard skins.8
35. DRIED HUMAN BODIES.
Reference has already been made to the costliness of
embalmment among the Egyptians. The remains of
many bodies which have been found in large, common
graves suggest that attempts were made to preserve
them by drying them in the sun or by the help of fire ;
both methods were probably employed. Drying by fire
has been commonly practised in many parts of Africa in
recent years, and Miss Kingsley states that it was
customary when a native of Benin died to dry his body
over a gentle fire, and then to take it back for burial to
his native city. 4 It may also be noted that when
Livingstone died at Kataui on Lake Bemba, his faithful
servants removed his internal organs and dried his body
in the sun for twenty-two days ; they then rolled it ii
blankets and put it in the bark shell of a small tree, and
carried it to the coast. This information was given to
Mr. H. Ward by Uledi Pagani. 5 In the late period the
Egyptians preserved bodies in honey, and this custom is
not unknown in West Africa, for when Sonni Ali, Emperor of Songhay, was drowned in 1492, his body
was eviscerated by his sons, and filled with honey, an&amp;lt;~
carried back and laid in the tombs of his fathers. 6

Cannibalism, Human Sacrifice 265
36. CANNIBALISM, HUMAN SACRIFICE, ETC.
In addition to the instances already given the
following may be noted. The Gabun eat the dead, just
as did the Gabun Fang and the Ogowe Fang, 1 and the
Manbattu, 2 Wasongora Meno, and Waregga are also
cannibals. 3 The Gbalin tribe of Kpwesi fatten and eat
prisoners and slaves. 4 In Ofurekpe, in Old Calabar, the people eat prisoners of war, otherwise the inhabitants
&quot; are everything to be desired.&quot; 5 It is on record that in
1668-9 f ur sailors were captured by some of them, and
that three of the four were killed and eaten at once. 6 Among many secret societies in Africa the eating of
human flesh forms one of their most sacred rites, 7 and many sorcerers are believed to eat portions of the bodies
of the dead. 8 The Angicas were in the habit of eating
human flesh, 9 and in the fifteenth century the Benins,
the most civilized of all the coast tribes, lived upon it. 10
Queen Shinga before undertaking any new enterprise
cut off the head of the handsomest man in her guard,
and drank a deep draught of his blood. 11 In proof of the
view that cannibalism is not a thing of the past, as some
imagine, we may note Mr. H. Ward s remarks in his
Voice from the Congo, London, 1910. Cannibalism is,
he says, a regular practice, and the people eat human
flesh as a standard article of diet because they have an
innate love of it. They say : &quot;It gives us a strong
&quot; heart for fighting, and we eat men because it is good
&quot; to eat meat that talked with us.&quot; Men are fattened

and taken to the market at Mubangi, where they are
hawked about alive. Mr. Ward saw four Lulungu
captives soaked in water up to their chins, and then
killed and eaten. 1 With reference to human sacrifices at burial Mr. Ward describes the funeral of a chief of Bolobo.
His body was painted white, black, red, and yellow, and
he wore a feather headdress ; as he lay in his grave,
ten women and several young men were pushed into the
grave with the body, and when earth had been poured in
on them and they had been trampled down, a dance was
held on the spot. 3 When a Bairo chief died his wives
committed suicide as a matter of course, 3 and even at the death of a great African lady a slave was sacrificed. 4
The people of Senjero offer up human beings as
sacrifices, and many families must slay their first-born
sons, so that their blood may be poured out on the base
of a certain pillar.
5 King Kwoffi Karri Kari sacrificed
a human victim every Tuesday to his &quot;
fetish,&quot; which
was kept in a gold box covered with plates. 6 On the
terrible sacrifice of human life which went on at the &quot;watering&quot; of the skeletons and tombs of deceased
kings in Dahomey, see a most interesting letter written
by the Rev. P. W. Bernasko in 1860, and published by
Burton. 7 In Ashanti many human victims were
sacrificed yearly on the king s birthday, in addition to
those which were offered up to the gods monthly, and to
the spirits of the dead kings at the Annual Customs. 8
37. THE SPIRIT-BURIAL, OR SECOND BURIAL.
Among the tribes of the Lower Niger the custom of
Second Burial, or Spirit- Burial, is common. This burial
is conducted on much the same lines as the first, except
that a greater entertainment is provided, and the

Spirit Burial, or Second Burial 267
expenses incurred are heavier. The second burial is, in
a spiritual sense, of greater importance than the first,
&quot; because it is a special memorial service held over the
deceased in order to release him from the thraldom of the region of the dead in which all souls are confined,
. . . and to usher him triumphantly, as befits his birth,
into the abode of his fathers in the world of spirits.&quot;
No soul can attain to the peaceful ancestral habitations
without the rite of second burial. Formerly human
sacrifice accompanied this rite, one hundred slaves and
a horse being sometimes killed on the death of an elder,
but since the British Government has interfered in
native customs, animals and gifts of food, etc., are
contributed by friends instead of slaves. Among some
sections of the I bo peoples the Okuku ceremony, which is identical with the second burial or lamentation cere mony, was remarkable from the fact that during its
performance a male or female slave was killed and eaten
by those who belonged to the family of the deceased.
The slave was beheaded by the eldest son. Without
this sacrificial entertainment the soul, it was thought,
would either remain for ever dormant, or, being in the
power of the god of death, would be liable to be absorbed
by him, or be used as a malignant force. The New Calabar people, prior to the introduction of Christianity,
were in the habit of performing a still more elaborate set of ceremonies in connection with the &quot;
Duen-fubara,&quot;
or image of the deceased.
The Duen-fubara was a painted wooden figure
representing the head and shoulders of the deceased,
which was intended to be the abode for his spirit.
It was made by the Fucheans, who had the monopoly
of making such things, and was brought to the house
of the deceased, where living sacrifices were offered
to it, and their blood poured over it. When this
had been done, the sons of the dead man, with a number of followers, went to the house, and endeavoured
to carry off the Duen-fubara by force. When the
servants of the house resisted them, a sort of sham fight followed, and this was kept up for a time. At
length the defenders of the Duen-fubara gave way,
and the sons obtained possession of the figure, which



268 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
they took to a small house that had been specially built
to receive it. This was the house-chapel of the family,
and a trusty man was appointed to guard the figure, and
to keep the house swept and clean. 1 The wooden figure
is identical with the KA figure of the Egyptians, the
house is identical with the &quot; KA chapel,&quot; and the ministrant is the equivalent of the &quot;
priest of the KA.&quot;
These ceremonies are identical with those of the memorial service for the dead which is common through
out Egypt and the Sudan, and they closely resemble
those which the ancient Egyptians performed for their
dead, when their object was to secure the passage of
their souls from the land of death to the land of the
spirits. It cannot be too strongly insisted that spirits
were believed to be alive in the land of death, and that
death with them did not imply finality. The reason why
the living were so anxious that the spirits of the dead should pass from the land of death to the land of spirits
was that they might take up their position as spirit-fathers,
and act as guardians and protectors of their families.
If we apply these considerations to the history of the
burial of Osiris we shall see that the ideas which
prompted the performance of the funerary ceremonies of
Osiris are identical with those which cause the modern African to undertake the labour and expense of the
second burial of his kinsfolk. The details of the murder and dismemberment of Osiris are given elsewhere, so
we may pass on to consider his second burial. The
Book of Opening the Mouth describes at considerable
length the funerary ceremonies performed for Osiris at
his first and second burials, but they have not been kept
distinct in that work. The ceremonies connected with
the slaughtering of the bulls, and with the presentation
of the reeking hearts and the legs of the animals, repre
sent those which were performed at the first burial, but
we must note that, even at the early period when the
Book of Opening the Mouth was reduced to writing,
bulls had taken the place of the human victims which
had been sacrificed at the actual burial of Osiris.
Nearly all the other ceremonies, especially those which
deal with the censing, anointing, dressing, and decoration 1 See Leonard, The Lower Niger, p. 159 ff.



Spirit Burial, or Second Burial 269
tion of the mummy, belong to the second burial, and
their object was to give Osiris the power to pass from
the land of death to the land of the spirits. In later
times, when a KA figure, or statue, took the place of the
mummy, the object was the same, but the figure was
placed in a specially prepared chamber or shrine, like the
Duen-fubara, in order that the spirit who used it as an
abode from time to time might be consulted and
appealed to for help in time of trouble, by those who
lived on the earth. The second burial of Osiris thus not only freed his spirit from the land of death, but
made him to become the great and powerful ancestral
spirit and protector of the tribe which founded his cult
in primitive times. At a later period, when his worship
spread over all Egypt, he became the spirit-protector of
all the country, and the ancestor-god, par excellence, of all its inhabitants. Among modern African tribes the second burial may
be deferred for several months after the death of an individual, and sometimes a whole year elapses before
the spirit-burial takes place. Whether this was so in
the case of Osiris cannot be said, but we know that the burial of this god was commemorated annually. In
primitive times human beings were, no doubt, sacrificed
before his statue, and their blood sprinkled on it and on
the ground about his shrine, in much the same way as the skeletons of the kings of Dahomey are &quot;
watered,&quot;
i.e., bathed, with blood once a year. In course of time
animals were substituted for men, and their flesh was eaten sacramentally by the priests and certain of the
worshippers. It is possible that at some of the shrines
one human being at least wras eaten sacramentally, just
as a human victim was eaten during the Okuku cere
monies of the Niger tribes. As time went on the
slaughter of men ceased, and libations of wine took the place of &quot;
waterings
&quot; with blood, and in one of the
vignettes in the Papyrus of Nebseni we see a series of
bunches of grapes hanging from the roof of the shrine in
which Osiris is seated. The offerings made to Osiris at
the annual commemoration were very numerous, and
their comprehensive character is well illustrated by the
Great and Little Lists of Offerings which- are included
VOL. II. T



270 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
in the text of the Book of Opening the Mouth. They
consisted of incense of different kinds, unguents of
various sorts, wines from the South and the North, beer, the flesh of animals, geese and other birds, cosmetics,
changes of raiment, fruit, vegetables, flowers, etc. The
offerings at the tomb of Osiris much resembled those
which are presented by relatives, friends, and neigh
bours in honour of a modern king or chief in Western
Africa at his second burial. And the great feast which
followed the conclusion of the solemn ceremonies was characterised by the same weepings, cries, shouts of joy,
laughter, dancing, noise of pipes, drums, horns, etc.,
and acrobatic performances which accompany the second
burial of a great king at the present day. Of course,
they have nowadays, in addition, explosions of gun
powder, fusillades of rifles, and noises caused by instru
ments of music of European origin.
Under the New Empire the cult of Osiris developed
with extraordinary rapidity, and temples were built in
honour of the god at Abydos and at other great centres
of his worship. In these his festivals were observed,
and once a year commemorative ceremonies of a more
or less elaborate character were performed. During
such festivals priestesses assumed the characters of I sis
and Nephthys, and recited before the shrine of the god
addresses and hymns in which the sufferings and death,
and the reconstitution and resurrection of Osiris, were described. Added to these were many expressions of
great grief for the death of their lord, and invocations to
him to return to them and to remove from their hearts the sorrow and pain which his departure had caused
them. These addresses, which are commonly known as
the &quot; Lamentations of Isis and Nephthys,&quot; and the
&quot; Festival Songs of Isis and Nephthys,&quot; are equivalent
to the words of mourning which are addressed to kings
and chiefs of Africa at their second burials, and were sung with the same object, i.e., to assist Osiris as the
great ancestral spirit in his operations in the Spirit-world,
to gratify him and to win his favour for deceased relatives
and friends, to obtain his assistance for the Egyptians in
their daily life, and to induce him to give them full and
satisfactory inundations of the Nile, and good harvests.



CHAPTER XXV.
THE GODDESS Isis.
Of the exact position which Isis held among the
gods of Egypt under the first four dynasties, and of the
attributes which the Egyptians ascribed to her in the
Archaic Period, we know nothing, but it is probable that
she was generally regarded as the female counterpart of
Osiris, and that she was believed to minister to his wants, and to guard and protect him with the devotion
and fidelity of a truly loving wife. We find figures of a
goddess who, as she appears with Osiris, must be Isis,
on some of the cylinders which have been discovered at
Abydos, and if this be the case, there is good reason
for believing that Isis was known in the Predynastic
Period. One thing seems to be quite certain : her
fortunes were bound up with those of Osiris, and as his
cult grew and developed throughout Egypt, so the fame
and power of Isis increased in the land. It is impossible
to arrive at a final conclusion on these points, for the
evidence necessary is not forthcoming, but lack of
evidence does not justify the statements made by those
writers who assert that Isis had no place among the
gods of the Ancient Empire. Until we know from
hieroglyphic inscriptions what views were held about Osiris by the Egyptians of this period, it is futile to
discuss the position of Isis. Those who took the view
that Osiris was a mere tribal chief would regard Isis as
a tribal chiefs wife ; those who worshipped Osiris under
the form of a bull would naturally think of Isis as a cow ;
those who revered Osiris as a great, mighty, and terrible
ancestral spirit would consider Isis as his spirit counter
part, and so on. The characteristics of Isis changed as
Osiris absorbed little by little the attributes and powers of
other gods, and from being in the earliest times a some
what obscure, and probably local, goddess, she became
the chief deity of all Egypt, and, in late times, her worship
wholly eclipsed that of her male counterpart Osiris.
T2



272 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
The oldest form of the name of the goddess in
Egyptian is .fl, which is usually transcribed &quot;
Ast,&quot; but
the true reading of the two hiero
glyphic signs seems to be &quot;
S[e]t,&quot;
or &quot;
S[a]t.&quot; The vowel which was
prefixed to assist the pronunciation
of the two consonants was probably
a \\ and not a n , and in this case
JzE^ the name of the goddess is to be read
&quot;
Ast.&quot; The classical form of the name suggests that a vowel to assist
in pronouncing the two consonants
was prefixed, and in modern times in
Egypt we have istim for &quot;
steam,&quot;
and exepress for &quot;express.&quot; The word
ast means &quot; seat, throne, chamber,
house, abode, place,&quot; etc., but there seems to be no possibility of con
necting any one of these with the
attributes of the goddess in such a
way as to give a rational explana
tion of her name, and none of the derivations hitherto proposed can be
regarded as satisfactory. As the
wife of Osiris she was her husband s throne, as the mother of Horus she was the house in which he came into being, as the great World- Mother she was the abode
in which all life originated, and her womb was the source
whence sprang gods and men, the harvest, and all living
creatures. There is no doubt that at one time or another all these, and many other similar ideas, were associated
by the Egyptians with her name, but she was dear to the
Egyptians of all periods because they regarded her as
the type of the faithful wife and loving mother, who
bore pain and suffering, sorrow and solitude, and endured
untold persecutions from Set, her husband s murderer,
for the sake of her lord and his beloved son Horus.
Numerous passages in the Pyramid Texts prove that,
even so far back as the Vth dynasty, Osiris and I sis,
Set and Nephthys, were regarded as the deified
The Bull-god Asar-Hep (Sarapis).



The Goddess Isis 273
members of a family of human beings, and from this
time onward, even down to and including the Roman
Period, the conceptions of the Egyptians about this
group of gods never changed. Set was detested as the
murderer of his good and noble brother Osiris, and the
persecutor of the forlorn widow Isis, his brother s wife,
and the usurper of the throne and kingdom which
belonged to the son of Osiris. The sympathy of all
men went out to Isis, who, after her husband s murder,
brought forth her son in the papyrus swamps of Lower
Egypt, where Set, in the form of a scorpion, stung the
child and killed him. Nephthys, her sister s constant
and faithful companion, insisted that Isis should appeal
to Ra in heaven, and as a result Thoth provided her
with the knowledge of certain words of power which
restored life to the body of Horus. Further, all men
approved of the direct intervention of heaven at this
juncture, and applauded Isis for training Horus to engage
in mortal combat against his uncle Set, his father s
murderer and the usurper of his throne. Throughout
the history of Osiris Nephthys appears as her sister s
most devoted helper in every trouble and difficulty, and
as an affectionate ally of her murdered brother, and a
gracious protector of her nephew, his son. Osiris was
the type of the good god, king, and husband, Isis was
the model of all that a goddess, queen, wife, and mother
should be, and Horus exhibited the traits of filial love, which expressed themselves in constant care for his
widowed mother and in killing his father s murderer, and
which appealed to the heart of every father and mother
in Egypt. Apart from these considerations the Egyptians
throughout the Dynastic Period regarded their kings as
the lineal descendants of that Horus, the son of Osiris, who was conceived and brought forth by Isis after her
husband s death, and who became the first king of Egypt.
Therefore Osiris and Isis were the ancestors of their kings, and the divine origin of their kings was the secret
of their power, which at certain periods in the history of
Egypt was absolute. In obeying the king the Egyptians
believed they were obeying God, and in placing their
souls, bodies, and possessions at the uncontrolled dis
posal of their king, they thought they were proving



274 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
themselves to be loyal and religious servants of God.
The sovereignty of this earth was inherited by the
Horus, i.e., king, not from Osiris, but from his grand
father Keb, the god of the earth, and only his inheritance
of heaven came to him from Osiris. With the rise to power of the Theban princes of the
Xlth dynasty, and their successors of the Xllth, the
cult of Osiris developed greatly, and about this time
the fame and renown of I sis as the queen of Osiris, and
the &quot; mother of the god/ i.e., Horus, began to fill the
land. The performances of the sacred Osiris-play at
Abydos and elsewhere brought the loving care of I sis
for her husband and son into great prominence, and as
&quot; queen of heaven&quot; her protection was eagerly sought
after throughout Upper and Lower Egypt. She became
the great and beneficent goddess and mother, whose
influence and love pervaded all heaven, and earth, and
the Other World, and she became the personification of
the great feminine, creative power which conceived and
brought forth every living creature and thing, from the
gods in heaven to man on the earth and the insect on
the ground. What she brought forth she protected, and
cared for, and fed, and nourished, and she employed
her life in using her power graciously and successfully,
not only in creating new beings, but in restoring to life
those that were dead. Throughout the Book of the
Dead I sis is spoken of as a giver of life and food to the
dead, and she appears in the pictures of Osiris in his shrine in the Judgment Hall with the god, ready to
assist in the judgment of the dead. I sis and Nephthys
are often identified with the two goddesses of Truth
(Maati), and each may be regarded as a judge of the
dead. Of the sufferings of I sis we find no connected account
until we come to the XXXth dynasty, when the famous
stele, commonly known as the &quot; Metternich Stele,&quot;
1 was made. This valuable monument tells us that after Set
had murdered Osiris, he placed Isis, who was with child,
under restraint, but she, acting under the advice of
1 It was given to Prince Metternich by Muhammad Ali in 1828,
and a facsimile of it, with texts and translations, was published by
Gole&quot;nischeff at Leipzig in 1877.



The Goddess Isis 275
Thoth, who foretold the ultimate triumph of her son
Horus, and his accession to his father s throne, suc ceeded in making her escape one evening. With her
went the Seven Scorpion-goddesses Tefen, Befen,
Mestet, Mestetef, Petet, Thetet, and Maatet and they
led her to the village of Per-sui, near the Papyrus
Swamps. When Isis arrived at Teb she wished to beg
shelter from a woman of position, who lived there and
was connected with the overlord of the district, but the woman, seeing her coming, shut the door in her face.
Enraged at the treatment which Isis received from this
woman, one of the Scorpion-goddesses, Tefen, made
her way into the woman s house under the door, and
stung her child to death, and set her house on fire.
Isis, taking pity on the woman s grief for her child, laid
her hands on him and restored him to life, and a flood of rain extinguished the flames of the burning house.
Meanwhile a peasant woman had invited Isis to her
house, and the goddess went in and stayed there, and
the woman who had refused her admission suffered agonies of remorse for a whole night.
Soon after this Isis brought forth her child Horus on
a bed of papyrus plants in the Swamps, and she
rejoiced greatly in him, because she knew that he would
avenge the murder of his father. She hid him care
fully, and concealed him, fearing lest he should be stung
by some venomous reptile, and one day set out to go
to the city of Am, in order to obtain provisions and
other necessaries for her son. When she returned she found him lying stiff and dead, with foam on his lips,
and the ground round about him was soaked with water
from his eyes. In a moment she realized what had
happened ; Set, in the form of a scorpion, had suc
ceeded in discovering the child, and had stung him to
death. The shrieks of Isis rent the air, and caused all her neighbours to run to the place where she was, but
though they offered her sympathy, nothing which they
could do brought Horus back to life. At length
Nephthys came to her sister s help, and she counselled
Isis to appeal to Ra in heaven for assistance. This she
did, and having cried out to Ra, the sun stood still in
heaven, the Boat of Millions of Years stopped, and



276 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
Thoth descended to earth to comfort I sis, and to repeat
to her the spell which she was to use to restore Horus to
life. I sis learned the words of power, and when she
had uttered them the poison flowed forth from the body
of Horus, air entered his lungs, sense and feeling
returned to him, and he was restored to life. Thoth ascended into the sky and took his seat once more in
the Boat of Millions of Years, and the sun resumed his course amid shouts of joy on the part of the denizens
of heaven, who gloried greatly in the restoration of
Horus to life. The temporary death of Horus turned
out to be a blessing for mankind, for it was the imme
diate cause of Isis s obtaining from Thoth a potent spell
against the bite of scorpions. This spell I sis trans
mitted to her priests, and by its use they were enabled
to do away the effects of the reptile s poison in the
human body, and so to preserve the lives of many
Egyptians. The sorrows of I sis, the search for her
husband s body, her weary wanderings, her loneliness
when she brought forth Horus, the death of the child, etc.,
probably formed the subjects of scenes that were acted at
the Osiris-play, which was performed annually at Mendes,
Abydos, and other centres of the cult of Osiris. When
Horus had grown up he fought a duel with Set, which
lasted for three days and three nights. Towards the
close of the fight Horus began to gain the upper hand,
and at length he succeeded in fettering his adversary.
When I sis saw this, pity for her brother Set moved her,
and she uttered a spell which had the effect of causing
the fetters of Set to fall away from him, and he escaped.
Horus was filled with wrath at his mother s ill-timed
clemency, and he raged at her like the savage leopard
of the South, and as she fled from before his anger he
pursued her and cut off her head. At this juncture
Thoth intervened, and transforming the head of I sis
into that of a cow, he attached it to her body
straightway.
Under the New Empire Isis became, beyond all
doubt, the greatest goddess in Egypt, and the following
titles illustrate the estimation in which she was held
throughout the land :

&quot; She of many names. The

&quot; Who maketh the Nile to swell and overflow. Who
&quot; maketh the Nile to swell in his season.&quot; The last
mentioned titles of the goddess refer to Isis-Sothis,
whose appearance in the sky indicated the immediate
advent of the inundation of the Nile, and warned
men to be ready to begin the agricultural labours of
a new year. Though essentially the goddess, par
excellence, of the South, I sis had control over the stars of the Great Bear and of the other constellations of the North who were supposed to be able to exercise an
influence for evil over the sun in the season of spring.
As Osiris was, in one of his aspects, the lord of grain,
so I sis was the goddess of crops, and her benign
influence made grain of all sorts to grow, garden produce
to be abundant, and fruit to ripen. She was the
personification of all tilled lands, the benevolent spirit
of the fields, and the goddess of the harvest.
The association of I sis with the Other World is very
ancient, and the history of the resurrection of Osiris
proves that the powers of the goddess in this region
were very great. An Egyptian legend asserts that
Horus reconstituted his father s body with the help of
his four sons, but it was the spells which I sis recited,
having learned them from Thoth, which gave permanence
to the work of Horus, and made the unguents, balsams,
spices, and drugs used by the great physician Anubis, in
the embalmment of the body of Osiris, to possess their
marvellous properties. The Egyptians, believing that I sis gave to her lord a newly constituted body, spared
no pains in invoking her help to attain new bodies in
the Other World, and on her they relied for meat and
drink. Under the form called Amenit, \ ^^ Q Q ^ J ,
1 A/VWVA I I VJ ill
I sis was the personification of the Other World.
Though Osiris was the absolute Lord of that region,



The Goddess Isis 279
and none entered therein except through him and by
his consent, it was Isis who directed all matters con nected with the maintenance of the Spirit-bodies of the
blessed there, just as the first wife of a modern African chief directs the temporal affairs of her lord s household.
Moreover, the righteous were re-born in Amenit, or Isis,
and the decision as to whether the dead should leave
Amentet, the &quot; Hidden Land,&quot; or Hades, or Dead-land, and renew their lives in the region on the further side of
the river, or sea, which ran through one portion of the
Other World, rested entirely with her. I Read in connec tion with what has already been said about the power of
Osiris in the Other World, this statement may be thought
to exaggerate the powers of Isis in the same region, but
if we consider the part played by Isis in the history of
Osiris, we shall find that without her help Osiris must
have perished. It was Isis who searched out and
collected the members of his mutilated body, and pre
sided over its reconstitution. It was Isis who uttered the spells which revivified his body, and made him to
have union with her after his death and beget their son
Horus. Isis resisted the attacks made upon her by Set,
and protected herself against his machinations. She hid
herself in the Papyrus Swamps during the period of her
pregnancy, and maintained herself until her child was
born. Her spells raised Horus from the dead after he
had been killed by the sting of a scorpion, and it was
Isis who reared him and trained him until he was old enough to do battle with his uncle Set, the murderer of
Osiris. Thus Isis revivified Osiris, gave him a son,
revivified that son also, and, having made him avenge
his father s death, seated him on his father s throne, and obtained for him the inheritance of her father Keb.
Among the Egyptians of the Middle and New
Empires Isis was regarded as a great magician, and the
papyri contain several allusions to her magical powers.
She knew how to weave spells and how to fashion
magical figures, and she possessed the knowledge of all
the secret or hidden names of all the gods and of all the
spirits, both good and bad, and she used them in such
a way that each of them was compelled to do her will.
At her bidding the powers of nature ceased or modified



280 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
their operations, and she could make everything, both
animate and inanimate, to perform her will. There is
a legend which states that at one time there existed one
being whose secret name was unknown to her, viz., Ra
the Sun-god. This name I sis determined to know, and
to effect her purpose she took some of the spittle of
the god and mixed it with dust from the ground, and,
having formed a venomous serpent therewith, she
endowed it with life, and set it on the path traversed by
Ra when he went on his daily tour of inspection in
heaven. As he passed the serpent, the reptile bit him,
and the god became sick unto death. Then I sis went
to him, and promised to destroy the effect of the poison
and to restore him to health if he would tell her his secret name. This Ra hesitated to do, but as his sufferings
increased, and he drew nigh to death, his agony forced
him to reveal his name to the goddess I sis, who straight
way uttered the spell which relieved his pain and healed
him. One of the most powerful amulets known to the
Egyptians was the object (| thet, which carried with it
the influence of her blood, and magical powers, and
words of power. We have already seen that it is most
probably a conventional representation of the uterus
with its ligatures, and the vagina. The all-powerful
symbol of Osiris is a portion of his backbone, ;
T tet,
or rather the os sacrum set on a stand, and analogy
suggests that the amulet 1, the all-powerful symbol
of I sis, represents some organ of her body. The greatness of the power of I sis is well illustrated by the
fact that she did not suffer death like Osiris, and the
Egyptian inscriptions do not mention any tomb of I sis. 1
Whether the Egyptians believed that she passed from
this world to the Other World unchanged in respect of
her body cannot be said, but there is little doubt that,
at least in the latest days of her cult in Egypt, it was
her immunity from death which most impressed the
Egyptians and the nations around, and made them to
1 Diodorus (I, 27) says that her tomb was at Nysa in Arabia.



The Goddess Isis 281
exalt her powers over those of Osiris. When her cult
finally broke down through the development and mighty
spreading of Christianity in Egypt, Isis was to her
votaries the type and symbol of all that is greatest and
best in woman in her character of the unselfish, true, tender, loving, and eternal World Mother.
Isis is generally depicted on the monuments and
papyri in the form of a woman who wears on her head
a vulture-headdress, and holds in one hand and in the
other I. The usual ornament or crown on her head
consists of a pair of horns, between which is a solar
or lunar disk ; this is sometimes surmounted by rj,
the symbol of the sound of her name. Sometimes she wears the Crowns of the South and North, to the back of which is attached the feather of Maat, and sometimes she wears with the pair of horns and the solar disk two
plumes. Her horns are those of the Cow of Hathor
\/, but occasionally, as the female counterpart of the Ram of Mendes, she wears a pair of ram s horns under her double crown. Isis, as a woman, and not as a goddess, wears the ordinary head-dress of a woman, but
even so she has an uraeus over her forehead, for the
Egyptians never forgot her divine origin. As the
goddess of the Island of Senemtet, near Philae, she wore
a sort of flat cap, having a fillet decorated with uraei
and fastened with cords or bands, the ends of which drop
down behind her head. 1 By means of this head-dress
Isis is identified with the local goddess of the Island. In her character of female counterpart of Osiris, Isis
takes, naturally, the form of a cow, and she is often seen
wearing the characteristic emblems of ancient Cow
goddesses, viz., Hathor, Meh-urt, etc. In the New
Empire it became the fashion for women to wear
attached to necklaces pendants made of porcelain2 or
metal, which represent the goddess seated among lotus

282 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
plants with her newly born child Horus on her knees,
and which were intended to commemorate the successful birth of her child. These pendants were, strictly
speaking, amulets, which were supposed to give their
wearers the power to conceive, and to give birth to
children without difficulty, and to secure for them the
help of Thoth, who acted as &quot; medicine-man &quot; at the
confinement of I sis, and the protection of the goddesses
of Upper and Lower Egypt, and of Ra, and of I sis herself.
Similarly, the pictures of the bier of Osiris, with I sis
standing or kneeling at the foot and Nephthys at the
head, which are painted on coffins of the New Empire
and of the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, are also amulets which brought to them the protection of I sis and
Nephthys. In Chapter CLlA of the Book of the Dead
I sis says that she has brought to the deceased &quot; the north
wind which cometh from Temu,&quot; and has strengthened
his throat, and set all his enemies under his feet. Thus I sis presided over the conception and birth of human
beings into this world and into the next.



CHAPTER XXVI.
THE WORSHIP OF OSIRIS AND Isis IN FOREIGN LANDS.
The raids made by the Egyptians into the Stidan
and the Sinaitic Peninsula under the Ancient and Middle
Empires, and the military expeditions into Western Asia
made by the great kings of the New Empire, must have
carried among the conquered peoples and tribes a know
ledge of the gods of Egypt. And the foreign sailors
and merchants who traded with Egypt in the Red Sea
and Mediterranean Sea must also have carried back with them to their coasts, or islands, and homes, accounts of the curious people whose gods were in the form of
the bull, ram, cat, crocodile, jackal, hippopotamus, birds,
reptiles, trees, stone pillars, etc. If any of them became
acquainted with the strange legends of the gods which
were current among the priesthoods of Heliopolis and
Memphis, and reported them to their stay-at-home
relatives and friends, it is easy to think that they would
only be regarded, at first at least, as mere &quot; travellers
tales.&quot; When the kings of Egypt ceased to raid
countries, and began to occupy them effectively, and to
work the mines in them by forced labour under military
supervision, the vanquished peoples were brought face
to face with men who worshipped these strange animal
gods and emblems, and built temples for them, and they
were obliged to obey these foreign rulers. The gods of
the indigenous Egyptians and the Sudani tribes were,
I believe, in primitive times the same, and the worship
of these formed a bond between Nubia and Egypt.
The solar gods and the Nature gods and Phallic gods
of Libya and the Eastern Desert which the later
Egyptians adopted were strangers to the Nubians, and
a considerable time must have elapsed before their cult
became established in their country. We know from the
bas-reliefs on tombs and temples and from the inscrip
tions in the Northern Sudan that the tribes so far south



284 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
as Wad ben-Nagaa and Masawwarat adopted a great
many of the Egyptian gods who were worshipped under
the New Empire and in the Ptolemaic and Roman
Periods, but this was due to the effective occupation of
the Northern Sudan by the Egyptians, Ptolemies, and
Roman Emperors, rather than to the deliberate choice
of the people. The Northern Nubians as a whole can
never have understood the mysteries and intricacies of
the Egyptian religion, and there is good reason to believe
that the Sudani tribes who lived in the country between
Kom Ombo and the Equator always preferred the
original African cult of ancestors to the modified form of
it which became current in Egypt after the introduction
of the cult of Ra under the IVth dynasty. The town
of Meroe on the Island of Meroe and the Island of Philae were the great centres of the cult of Osiris and
I sis for hundreds of years after the downfall of the native
religion of Egypt. At the latter place Osiris, I sis, and
a Phallic god (Menu) were worshipped in the reign of
Diocletian, and the Blemmyes were in the habit of
sacrificing men to the sun there.
The Edict of Theodosius I (378-395) against
Paganism was disregarded at Philae, and when
Olympiodorus visited Nubia between 407 and 425 the
people were still pagans, 1 and the cult of Osiris and I sis
flourished at Kalabshah, Primis, and other places in
Nubia. When Maximinus in the reign of Marcianus
(450-457) went to punish the Nubians for a breach of
their treaty obligations, they were still pagans. And in the
new agreement which he made with them they stipulated
that they should be allowed to visit Philae according to
their ancient use and wont, and that they should be
allowed to borrow the statue of I sis, and to take it to a certain place in their own country, so that they might
make petitions to the goddess in their usual way. This
custom was at least 250 years old when Priscus wrote. 2
In the reign of Justinian (527-565) it seems that the
Nubian tribes became restless, and began to stir up
trouble in Egypt. This brought down upon them the
1 Ed. Bekker, p. 62. 2 Priscus, Excerpt, legat, in Labbe, Protrept., p. 40; Letronne,
Histoire du Christianisme, p. 68.



Worship of Osiris in Foreign Lands 285
wrath of Justinian, and partly for political reasons, and partly as the result of his hatred of paganism, he deter
mined to put a stop to the worship of I sis and of the
gods of her company at Philae. The Island, together
with its immediate neighbourhood, formed a centre of
religious fanaticism, and was, no doubt, a hotbed of
conspiracy, unrest, and discontent. Effect was given to
Justinian s decision by Narses the general, who went
to Philae and closed the temple of I sis, and removed the
statues of the gods from their shrines, and carried them
off to Constantinople. He also confiscated the revenues
of the sanctuary of the goddess, and threw her priests
into prison. Thus the worship of I sis came to an end
at Philae. Whether it survived on the Island of Meroe for any length of time there is no evidence to show.
Passing now from Nubia to the north, we find that
many of the gods of Egypt were known in the countries
near the Delta, e.g., Syria and Palestine, under the
XVIIIth and XlXth dynasties, but we find neither drawing nor representation of I sis in Phoenicia until
about the sixth century B.C. About this time Adonis of
Byblos (Gebel), and the goddess of that city, whose
characteristics resembled those of the Semitic goddess
Ashtoreth and the Egyptian goddess Hathor, became
confused with Osiris and Isis, and traces of this con fusion appear in several places in Plutarch s story
De hide. 1 At a later period we find figures of Isis upon
the coins of Tyre, 2 and figures of Sarapis on the coins
of Gaza3 and Bostra. 4 On the Stele of Teima we
actually find the name of Pe-ta-Asar, 5 i.e., the &quot;
gift of
Osiris,&quot; which proves that there was in and about Teima
in Arabia a colony of worshippers as early as 500 B.C.
From Egypt the cult of Sarapis and Isis passed to
Asia Minor6 and to the Islands of the Mediterranean,
e.g., Cyprus, Rhodes, Samos, Chios, Lesbos, Delos,
Crete, etc. In the fourth century before Christ Athens

VOL. II. U



286 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
was a kind of centre of the Egyptian religion, and
shrines to I sis, both public and private, seem to have
been erected in many parts of Greece at this period, 1
and the bas-reliefs, coins, and other antiquities which
have been found in Thessaly, Epirus, Megara, Corinth,
Argos, and many other places prove that the worship
of I sis was wide-spread, and that Osiris, or Sarapis,
Anubis, Harpokrates, and even Nephthys, were
associated with her in votive inscriptions. The coins of
Malta of the second or first century before Christ show
that the cult of Osiris and I sis was of importance in the
island, and the monuments found in Catania in Sicily
suggest that this city was a centre of the worship of
Egyptian gods. 2 Southern Italy contained many temples
of I sis, and the remains of statues, etc., found in Reggio, 3
Puteoli, 4 Pompeii, 5 and Herculaneum6 suggest that the
worship of Egyptian gods must have been as common as the worship of native gods in these cities. In Rome,
in the first century before Christ, I sis was regarded as
one of the principal goddesses of the city. Splendid
buildings and temples were set up in her honour, filled
with Egyptian objects, obelisks, altars, statues, lavers,
etc., which were brought from Egypt with the view of
making the shrines of the goddess to resemble those
of her native country. Priestesses who professed to be well acquainted with the &quot;
mysteries
&quot; of I sis dwelt in or near these temples, and assisted in performing
services and ceremonies in which large congregations
participated. 7 From Rome, the capital, the cult of Isis
naturally spread to the provinces, and thence, little by little, to Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Gaul,
and finally by way of Marseilles to Carthage8 and the
countries of North Africa.

Worship of Osiris in Foreign Lands 287
In the section on I sis it has been shown that this
goddess during the course of her long history, and as a
result of the development of her cult throughout Egypt
and Nubia, was identified with many purely local spirits
and goddesses, and the facts now available prove that
the custom of identifying her with foreign goddesses
went on in Greece and in Italy, and in nearly every
place where her worship was introduced. Thus the
Greeks and Romans identified her frequently with
Selene, 1 and with Demeter, or Ceres, and with several
goddesses of crops and of the harvest in general. She
was also regarded as an Earth-goddess, and as such was
the mother of all fertility and abundance. Some of her attributes caused her to be identified with Aphrodite,
Juno, Nemesis, Fortuna, and Panthea, and among coast
dwellers she was regarded as a Sea-goddess and the
patroness of sailors. Isis of &quot; many names &quot; was a
mystery to many of her worshippers, among them being
some who were wholly unable to satisfy their minds as
to her true identity. Thus in the &quot; Golden Ass &quot; of
Apuleius of Madaura, 2 Lucius prays to Isis in these
words :
&quot; Queen of heaven, whether thou beest Ceres,
&quot; the kindly mother from whom in the beginning spring
&quot; the fruits of earth, who, rejoicing to have found thy
&quot;
daughter, didst take from men their bestial provender
&quot; of old-world acorns and show forth to them a sweeter &quot; food, and now thou honourest exceedingly the soil of
&quot; Eleusis ; or beest thou Venus, the heavenly one, who &quot; at the first beginning of things didst unite the diversity
&quot; of the sexes in the power of Love that is born of thee,
&quot; and, after thou hadst brought to birth the race of man
&quot; that shall endure from generation to generation, art
&quot; now honoured in thine island shrine of Paphos ; or
&quot; beest thou Phoebus s sister, who with gentle healing
&quot; dost bring relief to women in travail and hast reared
&quot; such multitudes, and art now worshipped in the most
&quot;
glorious fanes of Ephesus ; or beest thou Proserpine,
&quot; to whom men render shuddering reverence with howls
&quot; by night, thou whose threefold visage awes the wild

288 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
&quot; rages of the goblin-dead and holds fast the gates of
4&amp;lt;
hell, who wanderest in many a diverse grove and art
&quot;
propitiated with varied rite ; thou that with thy tender
&quot; feminine light dost illumine the walls of all cities and &quot; with thy moist fires dost nurture the springing seeds,
&quot; and dispensest thy beams that shift and change with
&quot; the changes of the sun ; by whatever name, by
&quot; whatever rite, in whatever semblance man may invoke
&quot; thee/ etc.
To this prayer I sis made answer :
&quot; Lo, Lucius, I
&quot; am come .... I, nature s mother, mistress of all
&quot; the elements, the first-begotten offspring of all the
&quot;
ages, of deities mightiest, queen of the dead, first of
&quot; heaven s denizens, in whose aspect are blent the
&quot;
aspects of all gods and goddesses. With my rod I
&quot; rule the shining heights of heaven, the health-giving
&quot; breezes of the sea, the mournful silence of the Under
4&amp;lt; world. The whole earth worships my godhead, one
&quot; and individual, under many a changing shape, with
41 varied rites and by many diverse names. There the
&quot;
Phrygians, first-born of men, call me the mother of the &quot; gods that dwell at Pessinus ; there the Athenians,
&quot; sprung from the soil they till, know me as Cecropian
&quot; Minerva ; there the wave-beaten Cyprians style me
&quot; Venus of Paphos ; the archer Cretans, Diana of the
4t hunter s net ; the Sicilians, with their threefold speech,
&quot; Stygian Proserpine ; the Eleusinians, the ancient
&quot; goddess Ceres. Others call me Juno, others Bellona,
&quot; others Hecate, others the Rhamnusian, but those on
&quot; whom shine the first rays of the Sungod as each day
&quot; he springs to new birth, the Arii and the Ethiopians
&quot; and the Egyptians mighty in ancient lore, honour me
&quot; with my peculiar rites, and call me by my true name
&quot; Isis the Queen.&quot;

The above extracts are important as illustrating the
views which the pious devotees of Isis held concerning
the goddess, and as enumerating the various foreign
goddesses with whom the Egyptian Isis was pleased to identify herself. It is easy to see that the writer of
them had no true knowledge of the actual position which
1 Apuleius, Metamorphoses^ XI, 5 (Butler s translation).



Worship of Osiris in Foreign Lands 289
I sis held in early Egyptian mythology, and that he
ascribed to her the attributes which belonged, strictly
speaking, to Neb-er-tcher, Temu, and Khepera in very
early times, and to Ra, and Aten, and Osiris in later
times. In short, he turned the Almighty God of the
ancient Egyptians into a goddess with two natures, the
one human and the other divine. Still more important,
however, for the study of the history of I sis are two
Greek inscriptions, one of which was found on the
Island of los, and the other on the Island of Andros.
The former is, unfortunately, incomplete, but the greater part of the missing portion of the text is supplied by the
latter, and thus it is tolerably clear what a complete
copy of the inscription contained. Both texts are edited
by F. Hiller de Gaertringen in Inscriptiones Graecae?
and the following copy of the los text is taken from
Herr A. Schiffs transcript which is printed, with an
exact copy in uncials, in Vol. XII (Ease. V, Part I,

lifted up the sky from the Earth-god Keb ; thus she is a goddess of
light5. Here Isis assumes the character of a female Thoth, or Maat, who marked out the courses of the sun, moon, and stars in the heavens.
Osiris was the soul of the sun, and Isis the spirit of the moon. 6 Isis as Maat directed the course of the two boats of the Sun-god,
and so became a goddess of navigation. As a goddess of the winds
she gave or withheld fair weather, and so, in later times, became the
patroness of all seafaring folk, and delivered shipwrecked mariners from
their peril. 7 Isis and her twin-sister Nephthys were the two goddesses of truth

9 I know of no Egyptian parallel for this statement. It seems to
mean that Isis decreed that the period of utero-gestation should be
fully nine months, and that the perfect child was born in the tenth month. 10 Love of parents and the devotion of children, especially to their mothers, are well-known characteristics of the ancient Egyptians.
Numerous statues are inscribed with words which show that they were
set up by pious sons to &quot; make to live &quot; their fathers names, and the
famous moralist Ani warns his son not to ill-treat or neglect his mother,
for if she appeals to heaven God will certainly hear her and punish him.

The exact form of the cult of Osiris and I sis as it obtained in the countries where Greek culture had
penetrated, and especially in Italy, was based upon the
religion which the early Ptolemies organized for their
Greek and Egyptian subjects in Egypt. The first
Ptolemy is said to have taken counsel with Manetho,
the famous priest of Sebennytus, and with Timotheus,
a Greek, who was skilled in the knowledge of the Eleusinian Mysteries. In it the Egyptian characteristics
of I sis were retained, but to these were added attributes
1 See the chapter on Osiris and Cannibalism. There seems to be
no doubt that the primitive Egyptians were cannibals, and that men
only ceased to be so after they learned to grow wheat, barley, and dhura.
Sacramental cannibalism probably never died out, and it is common in
some parts of Africa at the present day.
2 I.e., Isis established regulations which prescribed purity of mind
and body for all who wished to become her priests. Fasting from meat
and fish and abstention from the use of women were common among
the Egyptians, as we see from the Rubrics to the Book of the Dead.
* The allusion here is probably to the fourteen, or sixteen, temples
of Osiris which Isis built over her husband s scattered limbs. 4 Isis here assumes the character of the goddess Hathor.
5 Isis and her twin-sister Nephthys were the two goddesses of truth

Worship of Osiris in Foreign Lands 293
which were essentially the products of a non-African
mind. The character of Osiris was changed in some
respects, and his name was changed to Sarapis. The
ancient legends of Osiris and Isis were mixed with
legends of non- Egyptian Nature-spirits, and the rapidity
with which the new form of the cult of Osiris and Isis spread proves that it offered to peoples of many climes
and tongues a form of worship of God which satisfied
their religious needs and was highly acceptable to them.
In the first place the new cult came from Egypt, the
land of mystery par excellence, and the home of a
civilization which had lasted for thousands of years.
The ascetic practices of the priests and priestesses, their
abstention from meats, their fastings and habits of self
denial, and their continence, appealed to all men. The ceremonies connected with the worship of Isis impressed
the imagination of all beholders, and the acting of the
I sis-play, in which her search for the body of Osiris, her
finding it, her union with her dead husband, the concep
tion and birth of Horus, her sorrows, and her ultimate
triumph, all represented by skilled actors, convinced men
against their will that the cult of Osiris and Isis was
based upon irrefutable facts. Moreover, it revived and
increased the faith in God and in the reality of spiritual
things, which the teachings of the philosophers had
well-nigh destroyed in their hearts. Above all, it gave
men the hope of a resurrection, and preached the
doctrine of a second birth, and of a new and pure
existence in heaven, in the kingdom of Osiris and Isis,
the passport to which was the forsaking of sin, purity in
word and deed, and reverent worship of these gods.
The progress of the cult of Osiris and Isis had made such strides in Italy at the beginning of the first
century B.C. that it was possible for its votaries to found
a College of the Servants of Isis, or Pastophori, in Rome
in the time of Sulla, about 80 B.C., and to build a temple
in the city. These proceedings were not regarded with favour by the authorities or by the local priesthoods,
and as a result the temple of Isis was thrice destroyed by
the Consuls, in 58, 50, and 48 B.C. In Campania the
worship of Osiris and Isis was established at a still
earlier period, for an inscription found at Puteoli, dated



294 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
in the year equivalent to 105 B.C., proves that a temple of Sarapis existed in the city at that date. 1 In 44 B.C.
the triumvirs built a temple in Rome in honour of I sis
and Osiris, and a &quot; few decades later &quot; the festival of these gods was recognized in the public calendar.
Somewhere about the beginning of the first century
a temple of I sis was built at Pompeii. This appears to
have been destroyed by an earthquake in the year ^5, *
but it was rebuilt from its foundation by Numerius
Popidius Ampliatus and his wife Corelia Celsa in the
name of their son Celsinus, who was then a child only
six years old. As a reward the City Fathers, the
decurions, admitted the nominal rebuilder of the temple
to their own rank, remitting the usual fees. According
to Mau, 3 this temple consisted of an oblong cella, the
east side of which was treated as a front, with a portico
borne by six columns. A pit for the refuse of the
sacrifices was made in the corner of the court near the entrance from the street, and in the opposite corner was
an enclosure like a small temple. Near this were two
altars, a third stood close to the temple, and there were
five others between the columns. The temple possessed
no specially Egyptian characteristics, and the ornaments
were made of stucco. A broad flight of steps was built
in front of the temple, and on the left side was a narrow stairway leading to a door opening in the cella. Across,
the rear of the cella was a base of masonry six feet high,
on which were pedestals for statues of I sis and Osiris.
In the two large niches outside were perhaps statues of
Anubis and Harpokrates. The walls of the colonnade
were painted in bright colours on a deep red ground.
The upper parts of the columns were white, the lower
were red, and the temple was white. In the colonnade
was a yellow base, and above it were large red panels, alternated with light, fantastic, architectural designs in
yellow on a red ground. The frieze was black, with
garlands in strong contrast green, blue, and yellow
enlivened with all sorts of animal forms. In the middle
of each of the large panels was a priest of I sis, and in
the lower parts of the intervening architectural designs

were marine pictures, galley manoeuvring, and sea fights.
The principal altar was near the foot of the steps in
front. At the back of the courtyard stood a cylindrical
leaden vessel, adorned with Egyptian figures in relief;
this was kept filled with water from a pipe connected
with the city aqueduct, and here the devout made their
ablutions, which formed a very important part of the worship of the goddess. In the south-east corner of the
court was the Purgatorium, below which was an under
ground chamber, with a tank which held the holy Nile
water. On the south side of the temple, at the back of
the colonnade, were rooms which were used as a kitchen,
a dining room, and a bed room. One of these rooms
was richly decorated, in the last Pompeian style, with
seven large paintings representing Egyptian landscapes,
and lo watched by Argus, and lo being received by
Isis in Egypt. In this room the Mysteries of I sis were
probably acted. In an adjoining room, entered from
the colonnade by a narrow door which could be securely
fastened, the walls were decorated with large, sketchy
pictures of Isis, Osiris, Typhon (Set), and sacred animals
and symbols. This room was probably used for per
forming the most secret ceremonies connected with the
worship of Isis ; they were most likely phallic in
character. In this room was an alcove in which temple
property seems to have been stored.
Two services were held in the temple of Isis daily.
Long before dawn the votaries of the goddess assembled
outside the door of the courtyard of the temple, and the chief priest entered the temple through the small side
door, and unbolted the great doors and threw them back,
and hung up white linen curtains across the doorway,
which hid the sanctuary from view. At dawn the door
of the courtyard was opened, and the public streamed in,
and people took their places in front of the temple.
Then the linen curtains were drawn aside, and in the growing light the form and features of the goddess
became visible to her worshippers. Whilst the priest
went round performing the appointed rites at the various
altars, and reciting prayers, the crowd continued to gaze
on Isis, and prayed and rattled sistra at intervals. The
priest then fetched water from the underground tank



296 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
and poured out a libation from a holy vessel, and as the
sun rose all present saluted him, and with loud cries
announced the first hour of the day. 1 The second
service was held early in the afternoon, and consisted
in the adoration of the holy water of the Nile. A priest
stood on the steps before the temple holding a vessel
containing Nile water, whilst two priests, who stood on
the top of the steps, one on each side of the temple
door, rattled sistra ; a fourth priest fanned a fire at an
altar placed at the foot of the steps, and a player made
music on his flute. A priestess of I sis stood on the top
of the steps in the doorway. The worshippers assembled
on each side of the altar and sang and rattled sistra. Details of the service are wanting.
The chief festivals of I sis were two. The first commemorated the murder of Osiris and the finding of
his body by I sis. It opened on November 10 with the
singing of dirges and loud and bitter lamentations for
the death of Osiris, which were, no doubt, based upon
the compositions which were sung in Egypt about the
same time. Then, on the second day, scenes were
enacted which represented the frantic grief and anxiety
of those who went about searching for the body of
Osiris. On the third day I sis found the body of her
husband, and there was great rejoicing in the temple.
Grief gave place to gladness and tears to laughter,
musicians of all kinds assembled and played their instru
ments, and men and women danced, and the festival
frequently ended with lascivious rompings and orgies.
The second great festival was celebrated in the
spring, when I sis had &quot;laid to rest the storms of winter
and stilled the tempestuous waves of the sea,&quot; and the
most important ceremony performed in connection with
it was the dedication to the goddess of &quot; a barque that
had never sailed the waves.&quot; A good description of
this festival, as it was celebrated at Cenchieae of Corinth, on the Aegean and Saronic seas, is given by Apuleius, 2
and from this the following summary is made. At the
head of the great procession came men who were dressed
to represent a soldier, a huntsman, a woman, and a
1 See Apuleius, XI, 20.
&quot;

gladiator. These were followed by men dressed as
magistrates, philosophers, fowlers, and fishermen. Then
came a tame bear clad like a matron and borne in a
litter ; a monkey wearing a Phrygian plaited hat and
saffron robe, and carrying a golden cup to represent
Ganymede ; and an ass with false wings glued to his
back walking by the side of an old man. These were
supposed to represent Pegasus and Bellerophon. Then
came women wearing white raiment and garlands of
spring flowers, scattering blossoms as they went ; women
with mirrors held reversed behind their backs, for the
use of the goddess as she moved on her way ; women
with combs of ivory imitating actions connected with the
combing and dressing of the hair of the goddess ; and
women who sprinkled the ground with scent and balsam
as they walked. After these came a mixed multitude
bearing in their hands lanterns, tapers, torches, and all
kinds of lights, which represented the stars of heaven
over which the goddess presided. These were followed
by the musicians and a choir of youths, magnificently
dressed in festal apparel, and singing to the sound of the
pipe and flute a beautiful hymn to the goddess. With
these came the flute-players of Sarapis, who &quot; through a reed held slantwise toward the right ear, repeated
the hymn that the god and his temple claim for their
own.&quot;
Next followed a crowd of men and women of every
rank and age clad in white linen apparel, the men with
shaved heads, and the women with their scented hair covered with translucent gauze. These represented
those who had been initiated in the divine rites. Among
them were the priests who bore the &quot;
glorious emblems of the most potent gods,&quot; which consisted of a golden
bowl of fire, an altar, a golden palm tree, the herald s
staff of Mercury, a deformed left hand with open palm,
a golden vessel, in the form of a woman s breast, from
which libations of milk were poured, a golden winnowing
fan, and a pitcher. After these came the gods who
deigned to walk with feet upon the earth. First came
Anubis, the dread envoy who goes between the lords of
heaven and of the Nether World. He was lofty of stature, and his face appeared to be black at one time



298 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
and golden bright at another ; in his left hand he bore
a herald s wand, and in his right a palm branch. Next
came a priest supporting on his shoulders a heifer which
held itself erect in human fashion, and symbolized the
fruitful mother of all things. Another priest bore an
ark full of objects of mysterious significations which
symbolized the mysteries of the glorious faith. Another
carried the awful image of the mighty deity, the emblem
of whose meaning no man may speak, it was &quot; the
&quot; symbol of the loftiest of faiths, whose mysteries must
&quot; be shrouded in deep silence.&quot; It was neither like
cattle, nor wild beast, nor bird, nor man. This object
was a small gold urn hollowed out with wondrous skill ;
its bottom was perfectly round, and its exterior was
adorned with strange Egyptian figures.
&quot; Its mouth
&quot;
projected into a long low spout with outstretched tube.
&quot; On the other side, with ample arch, extended a long
&quot;
retreating handle, on which was set an asp with twisted
&quot;
coils, holding erect the streaked scales of its swelling
&quot;
neck.&quot;
When the procession reached shore, 1 the high priest
arranged the images in order, and made solemn supplica
tions, and then dedicated to the goddess, having first
purified it with a torch, and sulphur, and the breaking
of eggs, a beautifully made ship decorated with marvellous
Egyptian paintings. On the sail was worked in thread
of gold the inaugural prayer for prosperous seafaring in
the new year s commerce. Its mast was of rounded
pine, all the hull was made of polished sandalwood, and
the stern was plated with gold. Then one vied with the other in loading the ship with winnowing fans heaped
high with spice and other offerings of supplication.
A libation of paste mixed with milk was poured over the
waves, and when the ship was loaded, it was loosed from
its moorings, and launched on the sea with the help of
a favouring breeze ; and all the people, having watched
it till it was out of sight, returned to the temple in the
order in which they had come. When they arrived
there the priests, and the image-bearers, and the initiated arranged the &quot;
breathing effigies
&quot; each in its appointed
place. Then the &quot; scribe &quot; summoned all the Pasto

phori, or members of the College of I sis, and mounting
a lofty tribunal recited from a book prayers for the
prosperity of the Emperor, the senate, the knights, the
Roman people, the sailors and the ships, and everything
which was under the command and governance of the
Roman world. Then in the Greek language, and after
he had recited the Greek ritual, he proclaimed the
&quot; Launching of the Ships.&quot; A shout rose from the
people, who kissed the feet of the silver statue of I sis
which stood on the steps of the temple, and then
departed to their homes in ecstasies of joy, bearing
green branches and sacred wands and wreaths.
The above description of the &quot; Launching of the
Ships
&quot;
is based on the account of the great festival of
I sis written by one Lucius, who was a loyal servant of
the goddess. It will be remembered that he had been
transformed into an ass, and that having suffered many
troubles in this form, he prayed to I sis to restore to him
his human shape during the spring festival of the
goddess. Having made to her the prayer already
quoted, he lay down to sleep, and, he says :
&quot; Yet scarce had I closed my eyes in sleep, when lo !
&quot; from the mid deep there rose a face divine that lifted
&quot; towards me a countenance to which even the gods
&quot; must do reverence. And then slowly, methought,
&quot; appeared a shining semblance, that rose till all its body
&quot; was in view and shook the brine from its limbs and &quot; stood before me. I will strive to tell you all the
&quot; wonder of the sight, if but the poverty of human
&quot; speech give me power to tell, or the godhead itself that
&quot; dwelt within that form supply rich store of speaking
&quot;
eloquence. First, the tresses of its hair were thick
&quot; and long and streamed softly down, now tangled, now
&quot;
straying wide about that neck divine. About its lofty
&quot; brow was bound a crown of many shapes and varied
&quot; flowers, and in the midst thereof above the forehead &quot; there shone white and glowing a round disc like a
&quot; mirror or after the semblance of the moon ; to right
&quot; and left it was bound about with the furrowed coils of
&quot;
climbing vipers ; above, it stretched forth ears of corn.
&quot; The tunic was of many colours, woven of fine linen,
&quot; now gleaming with a snowy brightness, now yellow



300 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
&quot; with hue of saffron, now blushing with roseate flame.
&quot; But the cloak it was that dazzled my gaze far beyond
&quot; all else, for it was of deep black glistering with sable
* sheen ; it was cast round and about the body, and
&quot;
passing under the right side was brought back to the
&quot; left shoulder. Part of it hung shieldwise down and
&quot; drooped in many a fold, and the whole streamed
&quot; seemly to its utmost edge with tasselled fringe. Along
&quot; its broidered border, and on its surface also, were &quot; scattered sparkling stars, and in their midst the full
&quot; moon breathed forth her flaming fire. But whereso
&quot; ever streamed the embracing folds of that wondrous
&quot; cloak, there clung a garland s endless wreath, wrought
&quot; of all manner of flowers, all manner of fruit. &quot; In its hands the apparition held emblems of
&quot; different aspect. The right hand carried a bronze
&quot; rattle made of a slender sheet of metal curved like a 41 belt, through the midst of which were thrust a few
&quot; small wands, that gave forth a tinkling sound when the
&quot; arm that bore them shook thrice with quivering pulsa
&quot; tion. From the left hand hung a golden cup, from
41 whose slender handle s most conspicuous part there
&quot; rose an asp towering with head erect and neck that
&quot; swelled to this side and to that. The ambrosial feet &quot; were shod with sandals woven of the leaves of &quot; victorious palm. Such was the vision, and of such
&quot; mighty aspect, that, breathing forth all the blest
&quot;
fragrance of African balms, thus deigned to honour me
&quot; with utterance divine.&quot; 1
In her answer the goddess promised to grant the
request of Lucius, and told him how his transformation
into human shape once more was to be effected. Every
thing happened as I sis said, and Lucius was filled with
the deepest gratitude to the goddess, and determined to
devote his life to her service. He frequented the
worship of I sis, with all its exacting service, more
zealously than ever, and his desire for admission to the
Mysteries increased daily, and he visited the high priest
frequently, and urged him to initiate him into the secrets
of the night that is holy to the goddess. The priest
entreated him to be patient, and told him that the day
1 Butler s translation, p. 128 f.



Worship of Osiris in Foreign Lands 301
of initiation was fixed by the goddess, who also chose the
priest destined to perform the service, and fixed the sum
to be expended on the ceremony. No one, he added,
dares to venture rashly and sacrilegiously to undertake
the service of the goddess without her express command
and thus to contract mortal guilt.
&quot; For the gates of hell
&quot; and the power of life are in the hands of the goddess,
&quot; and the very act of dedication is regarded as a voluntary
&quot; death and an imperilling of life, inasmuch as the goddess
&quot; is wont to select those whose term of life is near its &quot; close and who stand on the threshold of the night, and
&quot; are, moreover, men to whom the mighty mysteries of the
&quot; goddess may safely be committed. These men the
&quot; goddess by her providence brings to new birth and
&quot;
places once more at the start of a new race of life. 1
The high priest then warned him to abstain from
&quot;impious and unlawful foods,&quot; so as to win his way to the purest of faiths.
Lucius took his advice, was patient, and with quiet,
and gentleness, and silence zealously attended the daily
performance of the rites of the goddess. Night by night
he was cheered by the clear commands of I sis who told
him that the day of his initiation was come, and what
sums he must expend at the supplications, and that
Mithras himself, the high priest, should reveal the
Mysteries to him. Fortified by such revelations Lucius
one night rose from sleep, and set out for the priest s
house, intending to press him to appoint him at once to
the service of the Mysteries. The priest met him on
his way, and before Lucius could speak, told him that
the day for the initiation into the most holy secrets of
the Mysteries had arrived. Then he led him to the
doors of the great shrine, and after celebrating with
solemn rite the service of the opening of the gates and
performing the morning sacrifice, he brought forth from
the hidden places of the shrine certain books with titles
written in undecipherable letters. Some of these were in
the shape of animals of all kinds, and the extremities of
others were knotted, or curved like wheels, or closely
interwoven like the tendrils of the vine. The priest, having told Lucius what things he had to buy, escorted
1 Ibid., p. 146.
VOL. II. X



302 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
him to the nearest baths, and as he entered, the priest
prayed the gods to be gracious to Lucius and sprinkled
him with water. He then led him back to the temple
and set him at the feet of the goddess, and having con
fided to him certain holy secrets bade him to abstain from
all pleasures of the table, to eat no living thing, and to
drink no wine. At the end of this time a new linen robe was placed on Lucius and he was taken by the priest into
the very heart of the holy place. What was said to him
there Lucius dared not divulge, but he says :
&quot; I drew nigh &quot; to the confines of death, I trod the threshold of
&quot;
Proserpine, I was borne through all the elements and
&quot; returned to earth again. I saw the sun gleaming with
&quot;
bright splendour at dead of night, I approached the
4&amp;lt; gods above, and the gods below, and worshipped them
&quot; face to face.&quot; When the morning came, after the
performance of the rites, Lucius appeared in the twelve
cloaks that are worn by the initiate. He then, wearing
an embroidered linen cloak called the &quot; Cloak of
Olympus,&quot; ascended a dai s, bearing a flaming torch in
his right hand, and wearing a palm leaf crown, and the
curtains were suddenly withdrawn, and the people thronged in to gaze upon him. After dwelling with the
image of the goddess for some days, he at length entered
into the presence of I sis herself, and having wiped her
feet with his face, he addressed her with tears in his eyes
and sobs in his voice, saying :
&quot; Holy and eternal protectress of the human race,
that dost alway cherish mortals and bless them, thou
tendest the mischances of miserable men with a sweet mother s love. Nor ever doth day nor restful night,
nor even the least moment of time, pass uncrowned by
thy blessings, but always by land and sea thou guardest
men, thou drivest from them the storms of life and stretchest out to them thy saving hand, wherewith thou
unbindest even the inextricable weft of Fate ; thou
assuagest the tempests of Fortune, and restrainest the
baleful orbits of the stars. Thee do the gods of heaven
adore, thee the lords of the world below do worship.
It is thou that whirlest the sphere of heaven, thou that
givest light to the sun, guidest the universe, and
tramplest underfoot the powers of hell. For thee the



Worship of Osiris in Foreign Lands 303
stars shine, for thee the seasons return, in thee the gods rejoice and the elements are thy slaves. At thy
nod the winds blow, the clouds give increase, the seeds
spring to birth, and the buds burgeon. Before thy
majesty tremble the birds that go to and fro in the
sky, the beasts that roam the mountain, the serpents
lurking underground, the monsters that swim the deep.
But my wit is all too weak to tell of thy praise, my
wealth too slender to make thee due offering of sacrifice.
My voice is too poor in utterance to tell what I feel
concerning thy majesty. Nay, had I a thousand mouths,
a thousand tongues, and everlasting continuance of
unwearied speech, it would be all too little. Therefore
will I strive to do all that a poor yet faithful servant may. I will guard the memory of thy divine counten
ance and of thy most holy godhead deep hidden within
my heart s inmost shrine, and their image shall be with
me for ever.&quot; 1
A few days later Lucius bade the priest farewell and
departed from Cenchieae for Rome, and when he arrived
there he became a continual worshipper in the temple of
Queen I sis who, from the situation of her temple, was
called &quot; Goddess of the Field of Mars.&quot; When Lucius
had spent a year in worshipping I sis in this way, the
goddess began to warn him in his slumbers to prepare for
a new initiation. Pondering what the warnings of the
goddess might mean Lucius consulted some of the
initiate, and at length he learned that he had still to be
initiated into the Mysteries of the mighty god, &quot;uncon
quered Osiris, supreme father of the gods
&quot;
; for though
the faith of I sis was identical with that of Osiris, the methods of initiation into the two faiths were different.
On the very next night Lucius saw in a vision one of the
initiate wearing a linen garment and bearing wands, and
ivy, and mystic emblems, which he might not describe ;
having placed these before Lucius s household gods, he
seated himself in his chair, and told him to give a
banquet in honour of the great faith. This being walked
with a halting step, and his left heel was bent slightly
upwards. In the morning he saw among the Pastophori
a man with a foot shaped like that which he had seen in
1 Butler s translation, p. 151.
X2



304 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
his dream, and on speaking to him he learned that he
was called Asinius Marcellus, and that he had been warned by Osiris himself to admit Lucius into his
Mysteries. Lucius was anxious for his initiation to take
place at once, but lack of funds prevented this ; at length
in obedience to the express command of Osiris, he sold
his wardrobe, and with the money which it fetched
purchased the things necessary for his initiation. When
he had done this, he prepared himself by abstinence from
animal food for ten days, and shaved his head, and
frequented the service of Osiris, and was &quot; illuminated by
the nocturnal rites of the lord of all the gods.&quot; Mean
while, he lived on the gains which his mastery of Roman
eloquence won for him in the Forum.
After a short time the gods told him that he must
prepare for a third initiation, but he was troubled in his
mind about this matter, and began to doubt the good
faith of the priests. Whilst thus tormented and stirred
almost to madness by his doubts and fears, he saw a
gracious midnight vision, and he was assured that this
third initiation into the Mysteries was above all things
needful for him. Comforted by this vision, Lucius put
aside his doubts, and began a fresh course of abstinence,
and spared neither toil nor expense in preparing for his
initiation. After a few days Osiris appeared to him in
the slumber of night, and welcomed him face to face
with his own awful voice. He encouraged him to con
tinue his profession in the Forum, to fear no ill-wishers,
and chose him to be one of the chief elders among his
Pastophori. Once more Lucius shaved his head, and
joyfully performed the duties of that most ancient
company of priests that was established in the great days of Sulla.
Lucius, it is clear, was a devoted priest of the cult
of Osiris and I sis, and it is not difficult to think that his belief in the reality and greatness of these gods was
equal to his professions of faith in them. But the
Mysteries to which he refers so often must have
possessed very little significance to the minds of the
lower classes, who were attracted by the singing and
dancing, and opportunities for rough play, which
accompanied the celebrations of the festivals of the



Worship of Osiris in Foreign Lands 305
goddess, and there must have been large numbers of
people who scoffed at the animal forms of the Egyptian
gods, and at the extraordinary symbols and ceremonies
which appertained to their cult. The feelings of such
are voiced by Lucian in his short work, The Council of
the Gods, in which he describes a meeting of the three
gods, Zeus, Hermes, and Momus, to discuss the com
plaints made by the last named to the effect that the
banquet of the gods had been thrown open to a number
of undesirable persons. Momus, the Accuser General,&quot;
complained that many persons, in spite of their mixed
origin, had been admitted to the feasts and councils of
the gods upon terms of equality, that such had brought
with them their servants and satellites and enrolled them among the gods ; and that these menials shared in their
rations and sacrifices without even so much as paying
the customary tax. 1 Momus went so far as to point out
to Zeus that the mixed state of society among the gods
was due to him and his terrestrial gallantries, and that
heaven was simply swarming with the demi-gods whom
Zeus had introduced. It was all the result of the attentions paid by him to the daughters of Earth, and
the goddesses were just as bad as the gods. Momus
then went on to comment unfavourably on Dionysus,
Attis, Corybas, Sabazius and Mithras, and then went on
to attack the gods of Egypt. He said :
&quot;
I shall just
like to ask that Egyptian there the dog-faced gentleman
in the linen suit (Anubis) who he is, and whether he
proposes to establish his divinity by barking ? And will
the piebald bull yonder (Apis), from Memphis, explain
what he has for a temple, an oracle, or a priest ? As for
the ibises and monkeys and goats and worse absurdities
that are bundled in upon us, goodness knows how, from
Egypt, I am ashamed to speak of them ; nor do I under
stand how you, gentlemen, can endure to see such
creatures enjoying a prestige equal or greater than your
1 In the Bill to amend these matters introduced by Sleep and read
by Momus it was stated that, owing to heaven being filled with false
gods who troubled the banquets with a tumultuous rout of miscellaneous
polyglot humanity, there was a deficiency in the supplies of ambrosia
and nectar ; and that owing to the increased consumption the price of
the latter commodity had increased to four pounds the half-pint.
H. W. and F. G. Fowler, Works of Lucian, Vol. IV, p. 171.



306 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
own. And you yourself, sir, must surely find ram s
horns a great inconvenience &quot;
? To this Zeus replied
that the way in which the Egyptians went on was dis
graceful, but he reminded Momus that there was an
occult significance in most of the things, and that it ill
became him, who was not one of the initiate, to ridicule
them. To this Momus tartly replied : &quot;A god is one
thing, and a person with a dog s head is another ; I need
no initiation to tell me that.&quot; 1
In spite, however, of all jibes, and jeers, and ridicule,
the cult of Osiris and I sis spread all over Southern
Europe, and into many parts of North Africa, and it
continued to be a religious power in them until the close
of the fourth century A.D. At Philae, as we have
already seen, the worship of Osiris and Isis continued
until the reign of Justinian, and it only came to an end
in Nubia then because the Emperor caused the temple
to be closed by force, and confiscated the revenues of the
shrine. The ideas and beliefs which were the founda tions of the cult were not even then destroyed, for they
survived in Christianity. And the bulk of the masses in
Egypt and Nubia who professed Christianity transferred
to Mary the Virgin the -attributes of Isis the Everlasting
Mother, and to the Babe Jesus those of Horus. About the middle of the Ptolemaic Period the attributes of Osiris were changed, and after his identification with
Sarapis, i.e., Pluto, the god of death, his power and
influence declined rapidly, for he was no longer the god
of life. In the final state of the cult of Osiris and Isis, the former was the symbol of Death and the latter the symbol of Life.

Homage to thee, O Ladder of the god ! Homage to
thee, O Ladder of Set. Stand up, Ladder of the god,
stand up, Ladder of Set, stand up, Ladder of Horus, on
which Osiris made his appearance in heaven, when he
worked magical protection for Ra. 1 Thy brother Osiris
cometh to thee seeking [thee], his brother Set welcometh
him on his side (or, place) in his place in the Gazelle
Land. 3 Horus cometh with his uraeus crown on him, he repulseth him like his father Keb. This Pepi is thy son,
this Pepi is Horus. Thou hast given birth to this Pepi
as thou hast given birth to the god, the Lord of the
Ladder. Thou hast given unto him the Ladder of the
god, thou hast given unto him the Ladder of Set,
whereon this Pepi made his appearance in heaven to
work magical protection for Ra. Hail, god, behold
their Doubles pass, [and] the Eye of Horus glideth on
the wing of Thoth from the east side of the Ladder ;
men [have their] bodies in heaven. This Pepi is the
Eye of Horus. When it journeyeth from wheresoever it
is, this Pepi maketh the journey with the Eye of Horus.
Be ye glad that this Pepi cometh among you, O gods,
his brethren. Rejoice ye when ye meet this Pepi,
O gods, his brethren, even as Horus rejoiced when he
met his Eye. He hath set his Eye before his father
Keb, and every spirit, and every god reacheth out his
hand to this Pepi when he appeareth in heaven on the
Ladder. He hath not ploughed the earth, he hath not
seized the offering, he hath not gone to the Chamber in
Heliopolis, he hath not gone to the Chamber of Light
in Heliopolis. He hath touch, he hath taste, he seeth,
he heareth, he appeareth in heaven on the Ladder of
the god.
Pepi riseth like the uraeus which is over the brow of
Set, and every spirit and every god raiseth his hand for
Pepi on the Ladder of the god. Pepi hath collected his
bones, he hath gathered together his intestines, and this



3io Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
Pepi hath ascended into heaven through the two fingers
of the God, the Lord of the Ladder (1. 196). Open the doors of heaven, throw open the doors of
the sky1 to Horus of the gods, on his appearance at dawn,
having purified himself in Sekhet-Aaru.
Open the doors of heaven, throw open the doors of

Open the doors of heaven, throw open the doors of
the sky to Osiris, on his appearance at dawn, having
purified himself in Sekhet-Aaru. Open the doors of heaven, throw open the doors of
the sky to this Pepi, on his appearance at dawn, having
purified himself in Sekhet-Aaru.
Therefore let appear him that appeareth at dawn,
having purified himself in Sekhet-Aaru ; let Horus of
the gods appear at dawn, having purified himself in
Sekhet-Aaru. Therefore let appear him that appeareth
at dawn, having purified himself in Sekhet-Aaru ; let

at dawn, having purified himself in Sekhet-Aaru ; let
this Pepi appear at dawn, having purified himself in
Sekhet-Aaru.
O Ra, the womb of Nut is filled with the seed of the
Spirit which is in her. The earth bendeth under the
feet of this Pepi. Tefnut stretcheth out her hand to
Pepi. Seker purifieth this Pepi, Ra giveth his hand to
Pepi, so that he may promote Pepi [to be] the head
of the gods, Pepi hath taken his seat in the sky. O ye
who sing and rejoice carry ye this Pepi with you ; let
him live for ever! (1. 199.)
Happy are those who see, fortunate (?) are those who
see the appearance of this god in heaven, which is like



Appendix 311
unto the appearance of Tern in heaven. His soul is on
him. His spells 1 are on both sides of him, his book (?)
(or knife) is at his feet. Pepi hath brought the towns,
he hath embraced the nomes, and he hath gathered
together the lands ; Keb the Erpa of the gods spake
concerning this. The Domains of Horus, the Domains
of Set, and Sekhet-Aaru praise this Pepi. And lo,
Khensu, 2 and Aahes, the Governor of the Land of the
South, Tetun, the Governor of the Land of the Bow
(Ta-Sti = Nubia), and Sept, under his trees, carry the
ladder of this Pepi, they set upright the ladder of this Pepi, they lift up the ladder of this Pepi. Come,
ladder ; come, ladder, come [in] thy name spoken by the
gods. Come ye who come ! Come ye who come !
Come ye who rest ! Come ye who rest ! Come ye
who lack ! Come ye who lack ! Pepi appeareth on the
two thighs of I sis, Pepi reposeth on the two thighs of
Nephthys. Tern the father of Pepi hath stretched out
his hand to Pepi, and thrust Pepi at the head of these
gods, wise, understanding, imperishable. Consider, O
gods, that which Tern speaketh unto you : This Pepi
is at your head, and lo, he is established at your head
like the bull which is sacrificed daily (1. 202).
Au-qau (?) and Her-f-ha-f, Pepi setteth out in his
boat. Make [him] to embrace the two horizons of the
sky ; this Pepi saileth therein with Ra to the horizon.
Make Ra to embrace the two horizons of the sky ; this
Pepi saileth therein with Horus of the gods to the
horizon. Make this Pepi to embrace the two horizons of
the sky when he saileth therein with Ra to the horizon. Having sailed he standeth up on the east side of
heaven, in the northern part thereof, among the imperish
able stars, which stand up on their tcham sceptres, and
support themselves on their staves, and this Pepi standeth
up among them. This Pepi is a brother of the Moon,
Pepi, 1.199.



312 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
the Morning Star giveth birth to him ; give thou thy
hand to Pepi, [and] he shall live (1. 203).
Hail, Osiris this Pepi ! Raise thyself up on thy left
side, and place thou thyself on thy right side, by this
water of rejuvenation which I have given to thee. Hail,
Osiris this Pepi. Raise thyself up on thy left side, and
place thou thyself on thy right side, by the warm bread
which I have made for thee. Hail, Osiris this Pepi !
The doors of heaven were opened to thee, and the doors
of the Petchet1 were thrown open to thee by the body (?)
of the gods who dwell in Pe, when they came to Osiris
by reason of the sound of the lamentation of I sis and
Nephthys. The Souls of Pe smite for thee, they smite
for thee their flesh, they grasp thee with their hands so tightly that they are to thee like their tresses. They
make a speech to Horus, saying : Thou departest, thou
comest, thou risest up, thou liest dowr n, thou art stablished
in life. Standing up thou seest these things, standing
up thou hearest these things which Horus hath done for
thee. He smiteth thee and thou art smitten. He
fetters thee and thou art fettered. He placeth himself
with his (or thy) eldest daughter in Qetem, 2 thy great
sister, who collected thy flesh, and warmed thy hands,
and embraced thee when she found thee on thy side on
the place Netat, 3 and there is no grief in the Two
Halves of Egypt. The gods say to him :
&quot; Hast thou
brought him ?
&quot;
Appear thou, therefore, in Heaven ;
become thou like Ap-uat. Thy son Horus shall guide
thee on the roads of heaven. Heaven is given to thee.
Earth is given to thee. Sekhet-Aaru is given to thee,
and these Two Great Gods who come forth from Anu
(Pepi 1 1, 1.872).
Pour a libation. Pour a libation. Aqa and Ap-uat !
Watch, O ye who are lying down ! Wake up, O ye
who are guardians. Horus watcheth. Osiris Pepi is raised
up by the eldest son of Keb, and the Great Company of
the Gods quake [before] him. Thou art purified at
[each] month, the dead rise before thee, heads are

resteth not,&quot;
2 dweller in Abydos, stood up. Earth, hear
the things which Keb spake ; behold, he hath by his
magical ceremonies made Osiris a god. The Watchers
of the city of Pe make offerings to him. The Watchers
of the city of Nekhen pay reverence to him. Behold
Seker, at the head of the Petchtu Lake, and Aha, and Hemen, 3 speak to the earth, and open the gates of Aker
(or, the Tuat), and throw open the gates of Keb. . . . Thy speech cometh forth before Anpu, thy rank cometh
forth from the mouth of Anpu Heru-khenta-menat-f ;
the Lord of Saut bindeth thee, the Jackal of the South,
the Great Chief of the Great Company of the Gods.
Thou art marvellous in heaven on thy throne of iron (or,
alabaster). Thou sailest over the Lake, thy face is
directed to the north of heaven, Ra invoketh thee as
Asken of the sky. 4 Thou approachest the god, Set
maketh friends with thee, and the odour of Tetun, the Youth of the South, is on thee, he giveth to thee his
purifying incense the gods poured forth for him at the
birth of the two firstborn daughters of the King of the
North [and] of the Great Lady. Thou art watered
abundantly in the Green Field, and the water flood
cometh to the Children of Keb who are there. Raise
up thy knives, have the mastery over [thy] bows, Anpu
giveth one offering, the palm tree followeth thee, the
mulberry tree boweth its head to thee, thou goest round
about heaven like the god Sunthu5 (Pepi II, 1. 854).
Every god draweth this Pepi to heaven [in] life and
stability, cattle are slaughtered for him, and the thighs

(or, fore-legs) have been selected for him. He cometh
forth to Hathor of Heaven. . . . This Pepi cometh to
thee, O Ra, a calf of gold brought forth by the sky,
a being of gold made by the goddess Hesat. O Horus,
carry thou with thee this Pepi [in] life and stability, and
reject thou him not. Pepi cometh to thee, O Father,
Pepi cometh to thee, O Keb. Give thou thy hand to
this Pepi. This Pepi cometh forth to heaven before his
mother Nut. . . . Keb cometh, with his at crown on
his head, and his qendt garment on him. He smiteth
you. He adjudged the lands1 to the embrace of Osiris
[when] he found him placed on his side in the town of
Kehset. 3 Osiris, thy father Keb stood up, he delivered
thee from the hand of Set. ... I am he who fettered his feet, fettered his hands, [when] he set himself on his
side in the Land of Ru. O Horus on the womb of
heaven, 3 give thy hand to this Pepi. This Pepi cometh
forth to the heaven of Nut, give thou thy hand to Pepi
with life and serenity. Collect his bones, group together
the intestines of his body. ... His light appeareth in
the sky like that of a great star in the East.
Homage to you, O Waters brought by Shu, and
lifted up by Mentefta, 4 wherein Keb hath purified his
members, the hearts after fear, and the breasts after the
knife (?) Pepi was brought forth by Nu when there was
no heaven, when there was no earth, when there was no established thing, when there was no fighting (or, dis
turbance), and when there was not the fear which arose
through the Eye of Horus. This Pepi is one of the
Great Offspring who were brought forth in Anu, who
have never been conquered by a king or ruled by chiefs,
who are irresistible, whose words cannot be gainsaid. Therefore this Pepi is irresistible ; he can neither be
conquered by a king nor ruled by chiefs. The enemies
of Pepi do not triumph. Pepi lacketh nothing. His
nails do not grow long [for want of prey]. No debt is
reckoned to Pepi. If Pepi falleth into the water Osiris
if



Appendix 315
will lift him out, and the Two Companies of the Gods1
will bear him up on their shoulders, and Ra will give
Pepi his hand, wheresoever the god may be. If Pepi
falleth on to the earth, Keb will lift him up, and the Two
Companies of the Gods will bear him up on their
shoulders, and Ra will give him his hand, wheresoever
the god may be (Pepi II, 1. 1235).
Adoration be to thee, O thou Osiris Pepi, thou
Shining one in the horizon, thou Stable one in the Place
of stability2 who dost make decrees at the head of the
living for ever ! Stand up on thy left side, set thyself
on thy right side, and receive thou this bread which
I give unto thee. I am thy son, thine heir.
Hail, this Pepi, thy son Horus payeth thee homage.
Thy diadem is like that of the Morning and Evening3
Star in Nut. Thy feet and thy wings are like those of
a hawk with a large body, that is, [like] the kenhesu
bird, the splendour of which is seen [as he passes] in the
sky. Thou sailest over the firmament as Ra-Heru
Khuti saileth over the waters [thereof], Nut layeth her
hands upon thee. . . .
236. Heaven is open ! Earth is open ! The shrines*
of Peter are opened ! The strides of Nu are opened !
The strides of the god (?) Aakhu5 are opened. Behold,
[he] is one, stable each day. These [things] his
ancestors say unto him, [and] thereupon he cometh forth
to heaven, anointed with unguents, and arrayed in the
finest apparel of those who sit to give life to Maat.
His side is to the sides of the gods who are in the north
of heaven. They are imperishable, he is imperishable ;
they are incorruptible, he is incorruptible ; they cannot
decay, he cannot decay. When the god Menthu riseth,
he riseth with him ; when Menthu maketh a progress,
he maketh a progress with him.
243. Heaven is pregnant with wine, Nut maketh
herself to give birth to her daughter, the Morning Star.



316 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
Rise thou up, then, O Pepi, thou third Septet1 (Sothis),
whose seats are purified. He hath been purified in
the Lakes of the Tuat, he hath undressed in the Lakes
of the Jackals. 2 O Bakes3 plant, remove thyself from
his path, for he hath taken the Southern Portion of
Sekhet-Aaru, and hath made a way into the blooming
meadow of Kha. Grant that Horus may be embraced
by the doors of the sky [when] he saileth before Ra
to the horizon. Grant that Heru-Khuti may be embraced
by the doors of heaven [when] he saileth before Ra to the
horizon. Grant that Heru-Shesti may be embraced by
the doors of the sky [when] he saileth before Ra
to the horizon. Grant that Heru-Abti may be embraced
by the doors of the sky [when] he saileth before Ra
to the horizon. Grant that this Pepi, who is Horus
of the gods, may be embraced by the doors of the
sky [when] he saileth before Ra to the horizon. He
hath received his throne in Sekhet-Aaru. He hath
gone to the Southern Portion of Sekhet-Hetep. He is
a great god, the son of a great god. He appeareth
between the two thighs of the Two Companies of the
Gods. Pepi giveth praise to Ra. Pepi giveth praise
to Heru-Abti. Pepi giveth praise to Heru-Khuti. He
travelleth over the circuit. This Pepi resteth and
Horus resteth with him on his throne ; Horus resteth on his throne, and this Pepi joineth him thereon.
255. Pepi appeareth from Pe before the Souls of
Pe, Pepi hath put on the sheth garment of Horus, and
hath arrayed himself in the apparel of Thoth. Isis is
before him, Nephthys is behind him. Ap-uat openeth
for him a way. Shu beareth him up, and the Souls
of Anu draw him up the steps to set him before the
face of Nut, who giveth to him her hand just as they
did for Osiris, on that day when he came into port
(i.e., died). O Her-f-ha-f, Pepi saileth to Sekhet-Aaru !
Whether goest thou? He hath appeared in Auuaurt.
To him is the body which proceedeth from the god,



Appendix 317
the uraeus proceeding from Ra, he himself saileth, he
placeth himself in Sekhet-Aaru. The Four Spirits who
are with Pepi are Hep, Tuamutef, Amset, and
Qebhsenuf, two on one side and two on the other.
Pepi is steersman, and he findeth the Two Companies
of che Gods who give their hands to him, and he
taketh his seat among them to decide cases, and he
issueth orders to those whom he findeth there.
265. This Pepi is Sethta, 1 this Pepi is Sethta, this
Pepi is Susu, 2 this Pepi is Sunth, 3 who circleth about
heaven. This Pepi is Arek, the spirit of the Kings of
the North. This Pepi is Amennu, 4 the Amen of this
earth. Pepi is the Unifier of the Two Lands. 5 Pepi is
the Revolver, the god who revolveth. 6 Pepi is Hest, 7
Pepi is the Terrible one. 8 Pepi is Bat9 of the two
faces. Pepi is Nehemu, 10 he delivereth himself from
every evil thing. Pepi is Unshet. 11 Pepi is Unshta. 12
Pepi is Hep. Pepi is Tuamutef. Pepi is Amset.
Pepi is Qebhsenuf. Pepi is Tuaanuu. 13 Pepi is these
great gods who are at the head of the Lake. Pepi is the
Living Soul, with the face of Sepa. He rescueth his head, delivereth his body, carrieth off his body. In
trouble he doeth what must be done, lying in death he
doeth what must be done, decreeing what must be decreed. Pepi doeth the deeds of beneficence. Pepi
decreeth a good decree. The two lips of Pepi are the

Two Companies of the Gods, Pepi is the Great Word. 1
Pepi is Sena. 2 Pepi is the unfetterer, and he is loosed
from every evil thing. O men and gods, let your hands
be under Pepi ! Lift ye up Pepi, and raise him up to
heaven (even as the two hands of Shu, which are under
the sky, bear it up), to heaven, to heaven, to the Great
Place among the gods ....
279. Pepi giveth commands to his father, the Moon,
Pepi giveth birth to the Morning Star, Pepi giveth
commands to those Four Rejoicing Ones3 who sit on the
eastern side of the sky, and to those Four Rejoicing
Ones with shining hair who sit in the shade of the
dwelling of the god Qata. 4 Great of father, great of
father, Pepi is great of father.
283. The Comer ! The Comer ! This Pepi cometh !
The Lady of Tep is agitated, and the heart of the
goddess dwelling in Nekheb fluttereth on that day
wherein Pepi cometh in the place of Ra. Pepi hath
carried away for himself thy light under his feet. Pepi
cometh forth above it before his mother, the living uraeus
of the head of Ra, and her heart is grieved for him. She
giveth him her breast, he sucketh thereat. Son of the
father, this breast is presented to thee, thou suckest
thereat, therefore, behold, shall it happen that thy days
shall be numberless. The sky speaketh, 5 the earth
quaketh, and the gods of Anu tremble at the voice, and
the offering is before Pepi. His mother Bastet taketh
him and proclaimeth him to the goddess who dwelleth in
Nekhebet, She who dwelleth in Tep layeth her hands
upon him. Behold he cometh ! Behold he cometh !
Behold, this Pepi cometh with life and serenity. He
maketh his purificatory substances with figs and with
wine from the vineyard of the god .... Pepi passeth
as Horus passeth, his sweat being the sweat of Horus, his smell being the smell of Horus, to heaven, to heaven,
with the gods of the House of the Lion and the Hawk.

Appendix 319
I Pepi is in heaven with the gods of the House of the Lion
and the Hawk, and he is by their side in friendly
converse. Behold, Keb taketh Pepi by the hand, and he
j guideth him in through the doors of heaven, like a god
I into his place ; beautiful is the god in his place. The
I goddess Sethat purifieth him with the four vessels of
j purification which are in Abu (Elephantine). Hail,

; cometh to the gods of heaven, and behold, he maketh
f Peq to be at peace. Hail, where comest thou then, O
i. son of the father? He goeth to the gods of earth, and
[ behold, he maketh Peq to be at peace. Hail, where
I comest thou then, O son of the father ? He cometh to
Tchenttchenter. 1 Hail, where comest though then, O
|&amp;lt; son of the father? He cometh to his two mothers, these
I two vultures, with the long hair (or feathers) and the
, hanging breasts, which are on the Mountain of Sehseh (?},
and they put their nipples into the mouth of Pepi straight
I way, and they are with him for ever !
304. The sky speaketh, the earth quaketh. Keb
tottereth, the nomes of the god roar, the earth is ploughed

* the stable one. Therefore he cometh forth to heaven, he I saileth over the firmament with life and serenity, he
t passeth over the Milky Way(?), 2 overthrowing the walls
; of Shu. Now he appeareth in heaven on his wings like
: a great gander which hath escaped from his toils ....
Now he appeareth in heaven among the imperishable
* stars. His sister the star Septet (Sothis), his guide the
i Morning Star, take him by the hand to Sekhet-Hetep.
He taketh his seat there on the crystal (?) throne, which
I hath faces of fierce lions and feet in the form of the hoofs }f the Bull Sma-ur. He standeth up in his place which
I s between the Two Great Gods, with his aba sceptre and
liis menh staff in his hands. He lifteth up his hand to

315. Behold, it is not Pepi who maketh entreaty to
see thee in thy form in which thou art, O Osiris, who
maketh entreaty to see thee in thy form in which thou
art, it is thy Son who maketh entreaty to see thee in
thy form in which thou art, it is Horus who maketh
entreaty to see thee in thy form in which thou art.
Thus say the beings who are inert (?) and are like the
Great Males under Akhemut (P)
1 to thee, thus say they to thee :
&quot; Come, beloved son, in the form of the
Sa-mer-f,&quot; and they ferry Horus, they ferry Horus at the
appearance of Horus among the Meht-urt goddesses.

doors of the sky, to Horus of the East, who at dawn
descendeth and purifieth himself in Sekhet-Aaru. 3
Open, O ye doors of heaven, be thrown open, O ye doors

presented the offering. He riseth on the throne like a
king, and occupieth it with honour. He saileth over the
Lake of Peterta, and he traverseth the Lake of Kha. Neskestet3 stretcheth out the hand to Pepi from her
shrine, from her secret place, and she maketh him a god.
Behold, Pepi is a pure being, the son of a pure being,
and he is purified by [the contents of] the Four Nemast
vases, which are emptied (?) [over him] in the Lake of
Nether in the city of Nethru, 4 under the wind of Isis the
Great Lady, and behold the Great Lady made Horus
dry, and caused him to come with flesh purified. Is
Ra more pure than Pepi [or] the doorkeeper of Qebhu
(the sky) ? He taketh Pepi along to those Four Gods
who are on the Lake of Kensta, and they give gifts to
Osiris Pepi, and they give gifts to Ra. No boundaries
are fixed for him, and [he] findeth no limits [set for him].
Behold, one arm of Keb is to heaven, and his [other] is

he conquereth heaven and its pillars and its stars. 1
The gods come to him with bowings, the Spirits follow Pepi because of his soul, they reckon up their
war-clubs, they brandish their spears and wave their
swords, for behold Pepi is a Great One, the Son of a
Great One, and is born of Nut. The might of Pepi
is the might of Set of Nubt (Ombos). Pepi is the
Bull-god Sma-ur, coming forth from Khenti-Amenti.
Pepi is the efflux of the celestial water, and he appeared
when Nu (?) came into being. Pepi is the serpent Nehebkau, of manifold windings. Pepi is the Scribe
of the Book of God, 3 who spake and what is came
into being, and maketh to exist that which did not exist.
Pepi is the band of the written rolls which came forth
from the Great Trial. This Pepi is the Eye of Horus,
which is stronger than men and mightier than the gods.
Horus raiseth him, Set lifteth him up. Pepi maketh
offerings of bread and beer and the libation offering
at the door, he pacifieth the Two Gods who are to be
pacified, he pacifieth the Two Gods who consume (?).

Pepi, and he cometh forth to heaven. Heaven saluteth
him joyfully, the earth trembleth before him, for he hath
broken the power of the raging rainstorm, and he hath
roared like Set. The keepers of the body of heaven
and of the doors of heaven have opened unto him, he
standeth up on Shu, and the stars supply him with an
abode in the shade of the walls of the god. He
strideth over the sky like the god Sunth, he is the
third of the star Sept (Sothis), whose seats are pure.
He is purified in the Lakes of the Tuat. The goddess
Nemt3 maketh good roads for him, and she guideth
him to the Great Place, which the gods made, and
Horus made, and Thoth stablished (?). Isis receiveth him, Nephthys stablisheth him, and he taketh his seat
on the Great Throne which the gods have made.

the gods with gladness, and the gods of the horizon1
having fallen on their faces, and the imperishable stars
with homage. He taketh in hand the Sceptre, he
directeth the mouth of the gods, he beareth up the
sky on his shoulders with life, he supporteth the earth
with gladness, his right arm beareth up the sky with
power, his left arm supporteth the earth with gladness.
He findeth Shetth, he addresseth the doorkeeper of
Osiris, and an abomination to him it is to travel without
.... He receiveth the breezes of life, he inhaleth joy
of heart, the offerings of the god are laid before him in
abundance, he snuffeth the air, he hath the air of the north wind in abundance, and he is happy among the
gods. He is better equipped than Sept-ur, and he is
advanced more than Khent-Atert. He striketh with his Sceptre, he ruleth with his Aaai staff; he setteth his
remembrance before men, and his love before the gods.
Speak the thing which is ; speak not that which is not ;
an abomination unto God is the shifty word. This Pepi
is thy son, this Pepi is thy flesh and blood.
369. I have made a heart for father Pepi, another
hath prepared for him his . . .
3 Now when he cometh
forth into heaven, and when he journeyeth through the
pools of the Lake of Kha, Anubis cometh and meeteth
thee, O Pepi, Keb giveth to thee his hand, O father Pepi ; the guardian of the earth, the director of the
Spirits weepeth tears, O father Pepi. Hail, rise up,
father Pepi ! Thou hast received thy Four Nemast
Vases, and the vases of offerings ; thou hast been
purified in the Lake of the Jackal, thou hast been censed
in the Lake of Tat. Thou hast been made pure by thy
Shabt flower3 in Sekhet-Aaru. Thou sailest over the
heavens, thou stoppest in Sekhet-hetep among the gods
who pass to their Doubles. Thou sittest on thy throne
of alabaster, thou takest in thine hand thy club and thy
Ames staff, thou art the leader of the dwellers in Nu,



Appendix 323
thou announcest decrees to the gods, thou placest a Spirit in
his Spirit, thou takest thy course and thou sailest over
thy lake as doth Ra over the domains of heaven. Pepi,
thou art raised up, pass thou into thy Spirit.
377. Then Pepi cometh forth into heaven among the
gods who are in heaven. He standeth then at the Great
Uart, he heareth the words of the Henmemet beings.
Ra is found in the domains of heaven by the double
lake in Nut, whither the gods have journeyed and
arrived. He (i.e., Ra) giveth thee his hand in the Lake
Asken of the sky ; the gods come to his throne. Pure
is the coffer of thy throne in the Boat of Ra, thou
sailest over the upper regions, thou approachest the
roads, thou sailest with the imperishable stars, thou
steerest thy way with the stars that never rest. Thou
receivest thy tribute in the Semketet Boat, thou becomest
a Spirit of the Tuat. Thou livest sweet life, all the life of the horizon is in thee. 390. The two spurs of Horus and the two wings of
Thoth make Pepi to sail without shipwreck. Give thou bread to this Pepi, give thou beer to this Pepi, of thy
bread of eternity and of thy beer of everlastingness.
Pepi is the keeper of the Two Obelisks which are on
earth ; Pepi is the guardian of the Two Pillars which
are in heaven. Pepi goeth to embrace the two doors
which are in heaven before Ra. His flesh is under the libation (?) of the Firmament of Ra. The Land of the
South is made pure before Ra, and he appeareth in his
horizon. This Pepi is in the Field of Life, in the Birth
chamber of Ra in the Firmament. The goddest Qebhut, 1
the daughter of Anpu, findeth this Pepi, and she goeth
to meet him with the Four Nemset Vases. She refreshed the breast of the Great God on the day of his
watch, and she refresheth the breast of this Pepi with
life. She washeth this Pepi, she censeth this Pepi.
This Pepi receiveth his place of offerings in the Granary
of the Great God. This Pepi arrayeth himself with the
imperishable stars, the place of Pepi is more advanced
than that of Khent- Atert, and he taketh his seat with those who have been equipped with their characteristics (?).

396. Hail, Nuru, thou Ferry-god1 of Sekhet-Pat2
!
Pepi is thy herdsman, the chief of thy breeding ground (?).
Pepi is thy fashioner on earth, the offspring of Tern to
whom Nut gave birth. He cometh, he bringeth to thee
this thy house, he builded it for thee on the night
wherein thou wast brought forth, on the day of thy
birth (?). This vessel . . . unknown is thy father, un
known is thy mother . . . Make thou him to sail with
speed to the Earth, and arrive at the Field made by the
gods, the Field wherein they enjoy abundance on the
New Year s Days.
400. Hail, Ferryman, thou Boatman of Maat, who dost transport [souls] to Sekhet-Aaru, this Pepi is true
before heaven and before earth. This Pepi is true
before the Island of the earth. Pepi swam and arrived
at that which was between the thighs of Nut. Pepi is
the pygmy, the dancer [before] the god, who rejoiceth
the heart of the god, when he danceth before his Great
Throne. This is what shall be heard of thee in the houses, and what shall be heard of thee on the roads. This is the day whereon this Pepi shall be proclaimed
for life, and to hear the utterance of commands. Behold,
the chiefs of the throne of the Great God shall proclaim
this Pepi for life and serenity for ever. He is Strength
and he is Health. This Pepi saileth to the Field, to
the beautiful place of the Great God, and he shall do
what hath to be done therein among the servants. He
shall assign to them food, and tell out for them birds.
Pepi is Horus, who assigneth food to Pepi, and telleth
out to him birds.
405. Hail, Ferryman of Sekhet-hetep ! Bring this
to this Pepi ; it is Pepi who passeth, it is Pepi who
cometh, the son of the Mantchet Boat, which brought
forth Kheft-Ta ; Antchet brought him forth. Ankhet
taui is there, on the right side of Osiris. Pepi is the
green-laden envoy of the year, O Osiris. Behold, he
cometh with the message of thy father Keb with the
offerings of the year, the offerings of the year. Beautiful



Appendix 325
is that which belongeth to the year, beautiful things
belong to the year. Pepi descended with the Two
Companies of the Gods into Qebhu, Pepi was the
moulder of the Two Companies of the Gods, and he
laid the foundation of Sekhet-hetep. This Pepi
findeth the gods standing up, arrayed in their apparel,
with white sandals on their feet. But they hurl their
white sandals down on the earth, and they strip off their apparel, for their hearts are not happy because of thy
coming to them. Ye speak, ye remain. &quot; Sekhem-utcha &quot;
is the name of this weapon, the ... of Sekhet-hetep.
Stand up now, Osiris, and decree this Pepi to the chiefs
of &quot;
Sekhem-utcha,&quot; the .... of Sekhet-hetep, as thou
didst decree Horus to I sis on the day when thou didst
beget him in her, so that they may give him food to
eat in the fields, and water to drink from the wells in
Sekhet-hetep. 411. Hail, Her-f-ha-f, thou doorkeeper of Osiris!
Osiris saith : Make thou to come to this Pepi thy boat
wherein thou makest to sail thy purified [souls]. 1 And
when thou hast received thy cool water at that Uart of
the imperishable stars, make him to make his journey
therein, by means of the rope of green and red which
towed along the Eye of Horus. Now the finger of
Osiris there passeth along, in pain (?). This Pepi
journeyeth along with great speed (?), guarding himself
in the Great Lake. Be opened, O doors of Peter, be
opened wide the doors of the Lower Aat ! O ye Two
Companies of the Gods, make ye this Pepi to travel
with you to the Sekhet-hetep, and make him to become
a lord of fealty. This Pepi smiteth with his Aba
sceptre, he ruleth with the Aaata staff. He guideth the
revolutions of Ra, the watering of the earth, the dew of
Keb, and the ... of the Two Companies of the Gods.
Pepi is the Divine Soul who maketh his way among you,
O ye gods, who forceth a way through Pat Lake, who
filleth Pat Lake with water, who maketh Sekhet-Aaru
to blossom, and filleth Sekhet-hetep with water. Behold,
as those Four Tchanu, 2 who stand on the East side



326 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
of heaven, travelled on and transported Ra in their
boat through the two defiles (?) so that he might journey
to his horizon, so shall they transport this Pepi through
the defiles (?) so that he may journey to the horizon with
Ra, and give thanks to Horus of the Tuat, the Divine
Hawk, yellowish-green in colour, who produced the heavens. 420. Homage to thee with thy Four Faces which
are at rest and gaze at what is in the Land of Kenset,
and change the storms into calms (?). Give thou to this
Pepi thy two fingers which thou didst give to Nefert, the
daughter of the Great God, when she was the messenger
from heaven to earth, when the gods made their appear
ance in heaven. O Soul-god, who risest at the head of
thy Boat of seven hundred and seventy cubits, thou hast
transported the gods of Pu, thou hast completed the
gods of the East, and thou hast made this Pepi to travel
with thee in the cabin of thy boat. 1 This Pepi is the
son of Kheprer (the Beetle-god), 3 who was born in
Hetepet-hemt (?), under the hair of lusaas, 3 to the north of Anu, and came forth from the brow of Keb. This
Pepi is he who was between the thighs of Khent-Merti,
on the night of the grinding (?) of the weapon (?), and
on the day of sharpening (?) the tips of the weapons.
Thou hast received thy spear (or, harpoon)4 and thy
fighting weapon wherewith thou layest waste the lands
now its hooks (or, barbs) are the fiery darts of Ra,
and its two staves are the claws of the Lynx-goddess5
(or, Leopard-goddess). Pepi smasheth in the heads of
the enemies of Horus who are in Sekhet-hetep. Pepi
descendeth (i.e., embarketh) on the Great Green, 6 and,
O Great Green, thou hast bowed thy head and bent thy
knees [before him]. And these Children of Nut have
embarked on thee, and they have put their crowns on
their heads, and chains of ab flowers round their necks.

And they decorate themselves with Crowns of the
North [made of flowers] of the Lakes of Sekhet-hetep
for I sis, the Great Lady, bearer of the diadem (?) in
Akh-khebit. And behold, she bringeth them and
placeth them before her son Horus the Child, the Babe.
He journeyeth over the earth in his white sandals, and
he goeth to see his father Osiris. This Pepi openeth
his way among the feathered fowl (?), he goeth along
with the Lords of Doubles, he travelleth to the Great Lake in Sekhet-hetep, by which the Great Gods alight,
and these great ones of the imperishable stars give unto
Pepi the tree of life whereon they themselves do live, so
that he also may live thereon. Make thou this Pepi to
journey with thee into thy Great Field which hath been
put under thy authority by the gods, wherein thou
eatest from night to dawn, being in possession of the
god Hu, and let this Pepi eat of what thou eatest there,
and let this Pepi drink of what thou drinkest there. Grant
thou that this Pepi may be satisfied there . . . Grant
thou that this Pepi may sit in his truth (?), and that he
may stand up in his loyal service. Let this Pepi stand
up and take possession of his service before thee, even
as Horus took possession of his father s house from Set, his father s brother, before Keb. Proclaim thou in truth that this Pepi is a Chief among the Spirits, the
imperishable ones of heaven, who are Governors of
offerings and Guardians of oblations, and who make to
descend those who are at the head of their Doubles in heaven. 436. Hail, ye Four Gods who are in front of the
flowing hair of Horus, whose hair is in front of you,
whose hair is above your temples, whose hair is in your
caps on the middle of your heads ! Hail, ye Smiters,
bring ye the Mekhent Boat to this Pepi, bring ye the
Antu(?) Boat to this Pepi. Behold, Heqrer, 1 they
transport this Pepi with Maa-ha-f and he ferrieth him to that region of the imperishable stars so that he may
be among them. Whensoever he giveth the order, take
ye over the Mekhent Boat to this Pepi, so that this Pepi
may declare your names to the men whom he knoweth,



328 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
and to mortals, and so that he may pluck out these Smiters
which are in (?) your heads like lilies from the pools.
440. O Lake of gifts ! O Lake of gifts ! Behold,
this Ser goose is brought, behold, this Set goose is
brought, behold, this Nek Bull is brought. This Pepi
darteth like the Ahau bird, and he rusheth on his prey
like the Bennuty bird. Pepi journeyeth on with his
fathers who are in the Lake of Petchu. The bread
which cannot go mouldy is brought to Pepi, and his
wine which cannot go sour. This Pepi eateth his bread
alone by himself, this Pepi doth not cast it behind his
back, and he is delivered from the Kenmut bird. Hail, Maa-ha-f! Hail, Her-f-ha-f! Behold, this
Pepi cometh as a living being ! He bringeth to thee
the Eye of Horus, the fettered (?) one which is in
Sekhet-Khennu, and it is in the Eye-of-Khnem Boat that Pepi hath brought it. Hail, Hep, Amset, Tua-mut-f,
and Qebhsenuf. Pepi bringeth this Eye-of-Khnemu
Boat, which is in the Lake of Kha (or, Lake of Hetem).
Hail, thou god Am, 1 open thou a way for Pepi. Hail,
thou god Qerera, open thou a way for this Pepi. Hail,
thou goddess Nekhebet, open thou a way for Pepi.
Homage to thee, O goddess Nefert, in peace ! Love ye
this Pepi. Love ye this Pepi. Do ye no harm to him.
Carry him not away. Carry not ye him away.
447. The splendour of Pepi maketh strong the
heavens when this Pepi maketh to take flight to heaven
the Eye of Ra. Stand thou up, O this Pepi, by that left
Eye of Horus whereby thou shalt hear the words of the
gods. Stand thou up, O Pepi, at the head of the Spirits,
even as Horus standeth up at the head of the Living.
Stand thou up, O Pepi, at the head of the imperishable
Spirits, as Osiris standeth up at the head of the Spirits.
449. Pepi hath been made pure with the purifications
which Horus performed for his Eye ; Pepi is Thoth,
your avenger, and not Set who stole it (i.e., the Eye).
The gods make supplication, and the Two Companies of
the Gods rejoice when they meet this Pepi. Pepi raiseth
up the White Crown wherein the Eye of Horus is



Appendix 329
mighty ; the gods rejoice in his appearance. The face
of Pepi is the face of a jackal. The arms of Pepi are
the arms of a hawk. The tips of the wings of Pepi are
those of Thoth. Keb maketh this Pepi to fly to heaven.
Pepi draweth the Eye of Horus to him. Pepi judgeth
the dead(?). A wall to Pepi are the tablets which are
between the legs and under the hands of Osiris. Pepi
obstructeth the ways of Set, and continueth on his way
with the messengers of Osiris. No god can lay a hand
on Pepi, and no mariner can foul the way of this Pepi.
Pepi is Thoth, the strength of the gods. Tem calleth
this Pepi to heaven to life. Pepi draweth the Eye of
Horus to him. Pepi is the son of Khnemu. No evil
thing hath Pepi wrought. These words reach to thy
face, O Ra, the Bull of the Company of the Nine
hearkeneth to them. Open thou the way of this Pepi,
make thou spacious the seat of this Pepi at the
head of the gods. Pepi draweth the Eye of Horus to
him, he exalteth it, and it appeareth on his head. Grant
to Pepi that he may see with his two eyes completely,
and to destroy his enemies therewith. Horus hath taken
his Eye, he hath given it to this Pepi. His odour is the
odour of the god, the odour of the Eye of Horus
appertaineth to the flesh of this Pepi, Pepi advanceth
with it. This Pepi sitteth on the Great Throne of the
gods, he supporteth himself on Tem, between the Two
Powers (?). O Pepi, .... the gods, in the embraces of the Eye of Horus. It seeketh this Pepi in Pe, it
findeth [him] in Anu, it draweth him on to the head of
Set in that place wherein they fought. Horus, give thy
hand to this Pepi. Horus, thine Eye hath been pre
sented to thee, it cometh forth to thee, it cometh forth to
thee. This Pepi cometh to thee a living being. The Eye
of Horus cometh to thee with this Pepi, on Pepi for ever.
461. Thou hast purified Ra, thou hast decorated
Horus, .... on the hands of the god Un, 1 the son of
the god, the messenger of the god. This Pepi
journeyeth in the Lake of Kenset. This Pepi is
purified in Sekhet-Aaru, the Shesu-Heru (Body-guard
of Horus) have purified him. They recite for this Pepi



330 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
the &quot; Chapter of those who come forth,&quot; they recite for
this Pepi the &quot; Chapter of those who travel.&quot; This Pepi
embarketh in thy Boat, O Ra, the gods are the sailors,
this Pepi saileth on and they rejoice to meet him even
as they rejoice at meeting Ra, when he cometh forth from
the East, mounting up, mounting up. This Pepi hath
bathed in the Lake of Reeds wherein Ra bathed, Horus hath dried (?) him ; the back of this Pepi is the back of
Thoth, the legs of Pepi are the legs of Shu, Shu
draweth him to heaven, [O gods], give ye your hand to
this Pepi.
465. The god Temu once in Heliopolis took the
form of a man who masturbated. 1 He thrust his phallus
into his hand and worked it about in it, and two children, a brother and a sister, were produced, 2 Shu and Tefnut.
May they place this Pepi between them, may they place
this Pepi among the gods at the head of Sekhet-hetep.
Recite four times. This Pepi cometh forth to heaven,
this Pepi descendeth to earth, living for ever. Hail,
Sunth, who dost traverse the heavens nine times during
the night, stretch out a hand to this Pepi of life, and
ferry thou him to this Lake. This Pepi embarketh in
the Boat of the God, and the company of the gods in it
act as the sailors thereof, and this Pepi also becometh
a sailor in it. Thou recitest the &quot; Chapter of Betu
incense,&quot; thou recitest the &quot; Chapter of Natron incense.&quot;
The Natron standeth up at the head of the Great
Company of the Gods. The Betu sitteth down at the
head of the great Atert. Hail, thou Doorkeeper of
heaven ! Act thou thus in respect of the Messenger of
the God when he cometh forth. If he cometh forth by
the West Gate of heaven, bring to him the South Gate
of heaven ; if he cometh forth by the East Gate of heaven,
bring to him the North Gate of heaven.
471. Homage to thee, O Ladder, which beareth up
the abode of the souls of Pe and the souls of Nekhen,
give thou thy hands to this Pepi, and let Pepi sit
between the Two Great Gods. Advance the seats of
this Pepi, take [him by] the hand to Sekhet-hetep, and
let him sit among the stars in heaven. The Two



Appendix 331
Tchert birds (i.e., Isis and Nephthys) on the wings of
Thoth swoop down and alight, and they bring this Pepi
and set him upon his place. This Pepi of life is a
messenger (?) of Horus. . . . The Tet setteth free the
Mantchet Boat for its Lord, the Tet setteth free the Mantchet Boat for its chief Isis cometh, Nephthys
cometh, one on the right, one on the left, one of them as
a Hat bird -Nephthys cometh one of them as a Tchert
bird. They find Osiris, his brother Set hath cast him
down to the ground in Netat. 1
. . . They remove thy
foulness now thy name is Anpu. They remove the
efflux of thy filth to the earth now thy name is u Jackal
of the South.&quot; They remove the evil odour of thy
body now thy name is &quot; Heru-shati.&quot; They remove
the filth of Heru-abti. They remove the filth of Heru
neb-pat. They remove the filth of Heru-Tatti. They
remove the filth of Heru-neb-taui. . . . Watch, O Horus,
stand up upon Set. Thou art raised up, O Osiris Pepi,
the firstborn son of Keb. The Two Companies of the
Gods tremble [before] him. . . . Advance thou to the
Lake, sail thou to the Great Green Sea. Behold, thou
art he who standeth up, he who never resteth, dweller
in Abydos. Thou art endowed as a spirit in the
horizon, thou art made stable in Tchetet. The Souls of
An take thy hand, Ra taketh thy hand, the Two Com
panies of the Gods raise up thy head, and they make
thee, O Osiris Pepi, to be at the head of the Aterti of
the Souls of An. Live thou, live thou, thou art raised
up ... O thou Pepi, [thy] marking cometh forth from
Ra, thy sweat cometh forth from Isis. . . .
531. Lo Isis and Nephthys ! The Hat bird cometh,
the Tchert bird cometh, Isis and Nephthys. They come
with embraces for their brother Osiris, with embraces for their brother, this Pepi. Thou hast being (?) Thou hast being (?). Thy sister Isis weepeth for thee. Thy sister
Nephthys weepeth for thee. Isis, sitting down with her
hands upon her head, and Nephthys give the nipple of their breasts to their brother Pepi. Anpu is on his
belly. Osiris is on his seat (?) Ap-uat is at the head of



332 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
his fist (?) Thy humours are not, O Pepi. Thy sweat
drops are not, O Pepi. Thy efflux is not, O Pepi.
Thy emission is not, O Pepi. . . . Horus covereth thee
with his garment, he seizeth those who are in the
following of Set. He seizeth them, he breaketh their
heads, he cutteth off their haunches, he teareth out their
intestines, he diggeth out their hearts, he drinketh
copiously of their blood ! Count thou up their hearts in
thy name of Anpu, counter of hearts. Thine eyes are
made for thee like those of two uraei. Thou art
Ap-uat upon his standard, Anpu of the Divine House.
Hail, thou Pepi, thou art at the head of the Great
Houses in Anu. The Spirits fear thee, the imperishable
one. Thou castest the dead on their faces before thee, thou seizest with thy hand the Henmemet. The Souls
of Anu pay thee loyal homage, and they fill thee with
life and well-being (or, serenity). He liveth among the
living, Seker liveth among the living. He liveth among
the living, this Pepi liveth among the living. Hail,
thou Pepi ! Come, live this thy life in thy season, in
thy season, in these years of peace. Warm is the love of thee. 548. Thy water is to thee. Thy flood is to thee.
Thy humours are to thee, coming forth from Osiris.
The doors of heaven are open to thee, the doors of Nut
are open to thee ; the doors of heaven are open to thee,
the doors of the firmament are open to thee. I sis and
Nephthys cry in content over thee [when] they see their
brother raised up. Thy fetters are untied, thou layest
aside thy humours, thou sittest on thy throne of
alabaster (?), thou art_ purified by thy Four Nemset
vessels and thy Four Abt vessels. Thou comest from
the God-house, the god is with thee, thou hast abund
ance in the God-lake. Horus of Nekhen is given to
thee, he giveth to thee his Spirits, the Jackals. Behold,
by the will of Horus, thou art advanced to the head of the Powers. 1 Abiding is that which thou hast done. Anpu Khenti-neter-seh hath decreed that thou shalt
descend like a star, the Morning-star. Thou rushest on



Appendix 333
the Domain of Horus of the South, thou rushest on
the Domain of Horus of the North. Thou seizest captives (?), their hands are at the feet of thy throne.
Thy father cometh to thee, Keb cometh to thee, he
doeth that which thou didst for thy father Osiris, on the day of thy perfect festival in the waters, counting up the
lists, establishing the sandals, decorating his nails, upper
and lower. The Atert of the South and the Atert of the North come to him with bowings. . . .
559. Hail, thou Pepi ! Stand up, and sit thou upon the throne of Osiris. Thy flesh (body) is complete like
[that of] Tern. Thy face is that of a jackal. Ra hath
given to thee thy mouth ; he hath removed the impedi
ments in thy speech, he hath made thy words to flow.
Stand up, then, thou shalt not come to an end, thou
shalt never perish. Live, thou Pepi ! Thy mother Nut
layeth hold upon thee, she joineth herself to thee, and
lyeb taketh thy hand ; come in peace before thy fathers.
Thou art master of thy body, thou dressest thy body.
Thou comest forth like Horus of Tat at the head of the
imperishable stars. Seat thyself on thy throne of
alabaster, on thy lake Qebhu. Live thou, as liveth the
Beetle, be stablished, like the Tet, for ever and ever. Get thee back, Ken Aka ! Thy head is in the hand
of Horus, thy tail in the hand of I sis, and the fingers of
Tern are on thy brow.

the son of Ra, who loveth him. 2 Ra sendeth forth Pepi, 2
Ra hath conceived Pepi. 2 Ra hath brought forth Pepi. 2
This word of power is the intestines of Pepi. 2 Pepi is
the Great Sekhem among the Great Taskmasters in
Anu.2 [He] worketh the Boat of [of Ra]. 2 [He is]
Horus the Babe, the Child. 2 Nut hath not united [with
him], she hath not given her arms. 2 Keb hath not
travelled on his path (?)
2 No god hath drawn aside the
feet of this Pepi. 2 He hath no fruit (?), he hath no
shade, he hath not washed himself in the laver, he hath not smelled the haunch, he hath not carried the flesh and bone, he hath not ploughed the earth, he hath not carried
the offering. 2 Behold, it is not this Pepi who saith these
things to you, O ye gods, but it is Heka who saith them
to you. Pepi is the warden of the stand which is under
Heka. 2 Ho, let every god draw his feet to Pepi. 2 Ho,
let every god prepare his throne in his Boat. 2 Let him
plough the earth, let him carry the offering, let him make
ready the nemtet vessel, let him smell the haunch, let him
carry the offering. 2 Ho, let every god take the hand of

cometh before thee, O Osiris. He bringeth to thee thy
KA, it existeth endowed with soul (?). His mother Nut
raiseth him up upon her brow (?) Thou art raised up.
Thou art made complete. Shesa-Khent-Shenat hath
opened thy mouth. Tua-ur in the House of Gold hath
opened thy mouth. The two Statues in Het-Hesmen
have opened thy mouth. Horus hath opened thy mouth
with his little finger wherewith he opened the mouth of
his father, opened the mouth of his father Osiris. This
Pepi is thy son, this Pepi is Horus. This Pepi is the
son loving his father, in his name of Sa-mer-f. Thou art
pure in thy collar (or, breastplate), apparel is given to
thee, Thy thousand suits of byssus, thy thousand suits of
fine linen, doth this Pepi bring to thee, and he stablisheth thee therewith.
593. O sons of Horus, Hep, Tuamutef, Amset, and
Oebhsenuf, make the motions which transfer the fluid of life to your father Osiris Pepi, since it is that which shall
give him being before the gods. Set striketh. Defend this
Osiris Pepi from him until the dawn. Horus hath the
mastery. He himself delivereth his father this Osiris
Pepi. The father hath worked, praise him ! It is
Horus who hath come, he judgeth his father Osiris Pepi.
This Osiris Pepi maketh his way. Osiris Pepi,
is brought to thee the Sma Bull, he escapeth not from
thee. Osiris Pepi, is brought to thee the Sma Bull, he
maketh his march. Osiris Pepi, is brought to thee the
Sma Bull cut in pieces. O sons of Horus, this Osiris
Pepi marcheth. O ye sons of Horus, when your son
passeth under this Osiris Pepi, do not ye remove your
selves from under him, but bear ye him up. O Osiris
Pepi, the Sma Bull is brought to thee cut in pieces ; he
maketh his march. O sons of Horus, Hep, Tuamutef,
Amset, Qebhsenuf, bear ye up your father Osiris, guide
ye him along. O Osiris Pepi, he giveth thee sustenance,
he openeth thy mouth, stand thou up. I am Nut, I make
to approach this Osiris Pepi, I set him [in his place],
taking him in my arms. Hail, father Osiris Pepi, I have
made thee to approach. Hail, Osiris Pepi, I have brought
thee forth .... 60 1. The earth hath opened her mouth to this Osiris z2

Pepi, and Keb hath spoken to him. This Pepi is as
great as a king, and as glorious as Ra. The Two
Companies of the Gods have travelled in peace to Pepi.
Amen-Kau hath opened to him the eastern door of
heaven. Nut, the great goddess with the long ....
and the pendent breasts, hath given to him her hands,
and she suckleth him, and he lacketh nothing from her.
She draweth him to heaven, and droppeth him not on
the earth, she maketh him to be stable as Khent Atert.
He saileth in the Boat like Ra over the regions of Kha,
he saileth in the Henbu Boat, and worketh an oar therein to Sekhet-Nenta/ at the head of the land of Sekhet
Aaru. Ra taketh him by the hand, Tern raiseth up his
head, I sis graspeth the rope of his prow, and Nephthys
holdeth fast the rope from his stern. Qebhet placeth
him upon her verdure, and maketh him one of her
husbandmen and one of those who tend the young
cattle. Get thee back, Babua, thou of the red ear and
the striped rump ! Thou transportest the joint ....
thy statue and thy utterance. Get thee back, Kam-ur !
Retreat into Kher-Aha, into the place wherein they
(i.e., the fiends) retreat there.
605. Thou livest, O Pepi, for ever. Keb raiseth
thee up .... Behold, thou art a spirit, Nephthys
suckleth thee with her left breast. Osiris hath given
thee spirits. Horus hath reared thee. Thy steps are
before the Hat of Horus, whither hath gone, hath gone
the god from the time of Ra. He hath grasped thee by
thy hand, Seker-Khent-Petchu hath purified thee. Thy
throne is in the firmament. Thou art raised up a spirit,
O thou Pepi. Thou sittest down, thou eatest. Thy
KA sitteth, and it eateth and drinketh with thee, lacking
nothing for ever. Behold, Isis and Osiris2 they rub thy
feet with their hands. They bring thee thy things of
festival. Thy teeth are white (?), and thy nails are those
of Anpu(?). Thou sailest, the Mighty Bull, to the Field
of Verdure (Sekhet-uatchet), to the places of Ra which
are pure. Thou art raised up, this Pepi is a spirit.
Thy water is to thee, thy flood is to thee, thy effluxes

are to thee, coming forth from the emissions of Osiris.
The doors of heaven are open to thee, the doors of the
firmament are thrown open to thee, the doors of the
Hat-house are open to thee, and the doors of Nut are
unclosed to thee. Isis crieth welcome to the Father, Nephthys maketh the Father to advance in peace ....
Thy Spirit-soul is behind thee, thy Sekhem is within
thee .... Heaven weepeth for thee, the earth
trembleth at thee, Smentet crieth out to thee, Menant
imploreth thee, rubbing for thee the feet, chafing for
thee the two hands. Thou comest forth to heaven like a star, like the Morning Star Pepi cometh to thee, his
father, he cometh to thee, O Keb .... This Pepi is
the son of the Cow, Smat, the great wife, who conceived
him and brought him forth, and set him inside her wing.
She saileth over the Lake with thee, she goeth along
the canal with thee .... Thy sceptre is firm in thy
hand. Thou smitest [therewith], thou directest, thou
leviest tax on the lords of service. Behold, thou revolvest about Ra, near the Morning Star ; there is no
evil to thee, there is no evil attached to thy name on the earth. 614. Pepi cometh forth from Pe. His garment is
like that of Horus, his apparel is like that of the Two
Companies of the Gods. Pepi hath made himself to
rise on his throne like a king, he hath exalted himself
like Ap-uat. He hath received the White Crown and
the Green Crown. His mace is in his hand, his Ames
sceptre resteth in the palm of his hand. The mother of
Pepi is Isis, his nurse is Nephthys, the goddess Sekhat
Heru suckleth him, Net (Neith) followeth him, Serqethet goeth before him, his tackle is tightened, his boats
are grouped together. Behold, the son of Tern
hungereth [and] thirsteth, [and] thirsteth [and] hungereth
on this southern side of the Lake of Kha. O Thoth,
who art in the shade of thy grove, give thou to Pepi
the tip of the feather of thy wing on this northern side
of the Lake of Kha. Pepi is protected, his flesh is
protected ; Pepi is protected, his apparel is protected.
He cometh forth to heaven like Menthu, he descendeth
like a Ba bird into his net, like the Soul of Ashem ....
Exalted is father Osiris Pepi like Ap-uat .... Thy



338 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
feet are like those of a jackal ; stand up then. Thy
hands are like those of a jackal ; stand up then ....
Father Osiris Pepi crieth out to the Steersman, 1 father
Osiris Pepi crieth out to the captain, 2 and they transport
father Osiris Pepi in their boat, to the eastern side of
heaven, to the place where the gods were born .... father Osiris Pepi is brought forth there in the place
where the gods are born. This star cometh on the
morrow, and on the third day (?). Behold, father
Osiris Pepi standeth up at the door under the belly of
heaven .... This Pepi hath taken his apparel (?),
3 this Pepi cometh forth to heaven, stablished like the earth, the
male(?) in thy body, O Nut, under the seed of the
god in thy mother. Pepi is Horus, the seed of the god
in thy mother Nut. Thou hast received4 this Pepi as
thou hast received the son of the god. O Hapath,
O Hapath, O Henena, O Henena, make ye Pepi to
travel with you, and establish ye him among you. O
Heftnet, 5 Mother of the Gods, give thou thy hand to
this Pepi, give thou his hand for life, draw him to
heaven, even as thou hast drawn Osiris to heaven. O
Henena, O Henena, O Hapath, O Hapath, make ye
Pepi to travel with you, and establish ye him among
you.
637. Pure, pure is the Lake of Aaru. Pure is Ra
in the Lake of Aaru, and Pepi himself is pure in the Lake of Aaru. Pure is Shu in the Lake of Aaru, and
Pepi himself is pure in the Lake of Aaru. O Shu, Shu,
lift up this Pepi to heaven, O Nut, give thou thy two
hands to him. Hepaf, Hepaf, Henen-henen-henen,
Hepaf, Hepaf. Pepi is pure and is conveyed to heaven.
This Pepi is stablished with men. This Pepi riseth to
the gods. This Pepi riseth with Ra in his rising.
Those who are with him are four ; one followeth him,
2 PV7$
4 Or, swallowed.



Appendix 339
one goeth before him, one giveth him water, and one
giveth him sand (?). This Pepi riseth on thy hands,
O Shu, even as Ra riseth on thy hands, and they find
seated to meet him the Two Spirits, who are mistresses
of this earth. Nut rejoiceth to meet this Pepi. Pepi
taketh the nepenpet garment which is in her .... of
life and serenity, and which is under her .... and
they sit down together with Pepi. He hath removed
from himself the evil which appertained to him. The
goddess Serqet giveth her two hands to this Pepi, she
conveyeth her breast to the mouth of Pepi, the great
Morning Star1 shaveth him, and the goddess Sept
poureth water on his hands. Pepi is born this day
[among] the gods. His first mother knoweth him not,
but Nut who bringeth him forth with Osiris knoweth him. 643. This Pepi setteth forth with thee, O Horus.
O Thoth, bear him on the tip of thy wing. Behold, it is
Seker at the head of the Maat Boat .... He who passeth passeth with his Ka. Em-khent-merti passeth
with his Ka, and this Pepi passeth with his Ka to
heaven. He hath taken the Ladder, and hath ascended
it in its name of &quot;
Aq-er-pet.&quot; He saileth in its boat
to the sceptres of the imperishable stars. The Bull of
Heaven inclineth his horn and maketh him to pass on
his way to the Lakes of Tat. Hail, Pepi, thou shalt not
fall to the earth. This Pepi hath grasped the Two
Sycamore Trees which are in the midst of that side of
the sky, he saileth on, and they place him in that eastern
side of heaven. Know thou thy name, be not ignorant of thy name. Thy name is &quot;
An-tcher-f,&quot; and &quot;Urrt&quot;
is the name of thy father, and the mother who bore
thee is &quot;
Hetep.&quot; If thou repulsest the offspring of
An-tcher-f in the horizon, thou wilt repulse this Pepi
when he cometh to the place where thou art. If thou
repulsest the offspring of Serqet, thou wilt repulse this
Pepi when he cometh to the place where thou art. If
thou repulsest the Two Lands2 of Horus, thou wilt
repulse this Pepi when he cometh to the place where



340 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
thou art. If thou repulsest the offspring of Sah (Orion),
thou wilt repulse this Pepi when he cometh to the place
where thou art. If thou repulsest the offspring of Sept
(Sothis), thou wilt repulse this Pepi when he cometh
to the place where thou art. If thou repulsest the Two
Bentu1 of Ra, his two sons who love him, thou wilt repulse this Pepi when he cometh to the place where
thou art. If thou repulsest the offspring of Ap-uat in
Per-Khen, thou wilt repulse this Pepi when he cometh
to the place where thou art. If thou repulsest the men
of the king, the son of God, thou wilt repulse this Pepi
when he cometh to the place where thou art. If thou
repulsest thy sailors of the imperishable stars of thy
boat, thou wilt prevent them from allowing Pepi to
embark in thy boat. If thou repulsest the men belong
ing to the dead (or, death), thou wilt prevent this Pepi
from embarking in thy boat. If thou repulsest the men
belonging to earth, thou wilt prevent this Pepi from
embarking in thy boat. Behold, thou art Seksen, 3 the
messenger of Ra. This Pepi is not driven away from
heaven, and the goddess Mathet3 giveth her hands to this Pepi, the Doorkeeper of heaven. Her-f-ha-f
uniteth him to his boat of the Lake of Kha, he doth not repulse this Pepi, he maketh no obstacles for him,
[saying] :
&quot; He is one of you, O ye gods.&quot; This Pepi
cometh to thee, O Ra, this Pepi cometh to thee, O An
tcher-f. He worketh the boat for thee, he maketh passes
over thee [with his hands], he loveth thee with his body,
he loveth thee with his heart.
652. Water on the sky, O Baq-tree of the firma
ment ! The sky hath produced a god on the hand of
Shu and Tefnut, on the hands of Pepi. The gods say :
O Uben-ur (i.e., Great Light), hearken to this word
which Pepi uttereth to thee. Be gracious to this Pepi,
for he is a Chief, the son of a Chief. This Pepi is
with thee, rear thou this Pepi for everlasting life and
serenity with thyself. O Kheprer, hear thou this word
which he shall say unto thee. Be gracious to this Pepi,



Appendix 341
for he is a Chief, the son of a Chief. This Pepi is with
thee, rear thou this Pepi with thee. O Nu, hear thou
this word which he shall say unto thee. Be gracious
unto him, for he is a Chief, the son of a Chief. This
Pepi is with thee, rear thou him with thee. O Tern,
hear thou this word which he shall say unto thee. Be gracious to this Pepi, for he is a Chief, the son of a
Chief. He is with thee, rear thou him with thee.
O Uash, 1 son of Keb, Power, son of Osiris, hear thou this word which he shall say unto thee. Be gracious
unto him, for he is a Chief, the son of a Chief. This
Pepi is with thee, rear thou him with thee. Come (?)
thou to this Pepi in thy name of &quot; Ra destroyed of the
covering of the sky.&quot; Let Heru-khuti cause him to
hear his souls praised in the mouth of the Two Com
panies of the Gods. &quot; Beneficent one,&quot; saith his mother ;
&quot;
Heir,&quot; saith Osiris. This Pepi hath not eaten the
Eye of Horus ; men say :
&quot; He will die because of this.&quot; Pepi hath not eaten the flesh of Osiris ; the gods say :
&quot; He will die because of it.&quot; This Pepi liveth as the
equal (?) of his father Tern. Protect (?) thou him, O
goddess Nekhebet, thou hast protected this Pepi, O
Nekhebet, dweller in the House of the Prince which is
in Anu (Heliopolis).
. . . 657. Pepi hath passed his day under death,
even as Set hath passed his day under death. Pepi hath
passed his half-months under death, even as Set hath passed his half-months under death. Pepi hath passed
his months under death, even as Set hath passed
his months under death. Pepi hath passed his year
under death, even as Set hath passed his year under death. The hands of Pepi have not ploughed the earth.
Behold it is Shu who beareth up Nut. The bones of
Pepi are of alabaster (?), and his flesh is imperishable.
Pepi is the star Ap-shep-pet (Jupiter ?). This Pepi
approacheth the God and is protected. Heaven shall
not be empty of this Pepi, and earth shall not be empty
of this Pepi for ever. This Pepi liveth life more than
your sceptres au. O ye gods of the Sky, ye imperishable



342 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
ones, who sail over the Land of Tehenu in your
boats, and direct them with your sceptres, this Pepi
directeth his boat with you by means of the Uas sceptre
and the Tcham sceptre, and he is the fourth (or, third)
with you. O ye gods of heaven, ye imperishable ones,
who sail over the Land of Tahennu, who transport
yourselves by means of your sceptres, this Pepi trans
porteth himself with you by means of the Uas and
Tcham, and he is the fourth with you. O ye gods of
heaven, ye imperishable ones, who sail over the Land of
Tahennu, who transport yourselves by means of your
sceptres, this Pepi transporteth himself with you by
means of the Uas and Tcham, according to the decree of
Horus, the Erpat, the King of the gods. This Pepi
hath seized the White Crown which is bound to the Green Crown. Pepi is the uraeus which cometh forth
from Set, which carrieth off that which is brought, and
Pepi beareth it away and giveth himself life. Pepi is
the written roll which cometh forth from Nunu. Pepi
is the Eye of Horus which is uninjured and watereth ;
he is uninjured and watereth. Hearken, O Ra, unto
this word which Pepi uttereth to thee ; thy body is Pepi,
O Ra, make to live thy body in him, O Ra. Kenmut
slaughtereth the apes, and the apes slaughter Kenmut.
O thou Fowler, O thou Male, be there agreement
between you. For that first body, Pepi, of the swathings,
and of the triumph, was born when Tchent did not
exist, was born when the Word did not exist, was born
when Shentet did not exist, was born when Khennu did not exist, was born when the Eye of Horus was
not stabbed and when the testicles of Set were not eradicated. This Pepi is the dues matter which cometh forth
from Isis, and the red essence which cometh forth from
Nephthys. Pepi is strong ... the gods do nothing
against him. Pepi is the seat1 of Ra, and he dieth not.
Ieb, the Erpat of the gods, beareth him, Tern pro
videth him with his Eye, Thoth beareth what is among
the offerings of the gods, Horus openeth for him, and
Set protecteth him. This Pepi shineth in the eastern
1 Pi



Appendix 343
part of heaven, just as Ra shineth in the eastern part of heaven.
663. O Guardian, mother in whom is Pepi, he being
in Nut, this Pepi was brought forth by father Tem
when there was no heaven, when there was no earth, when there were no men, when the gods were not
brought forth, when there was no death. This Pepi
hath shortened [his] day under death as Set shortened
his day under death. Pepi is at your vases, O gods of
Nut, 1 who smite not your enemies, whom their enemies
smite not. This Pepi is not smitten, his enemies are
not. Ye do not die like a king, and Pepi dieth not
like a king ; ye do not die like every one who dieth, and
Pepi doth not die like every one who dieth. Pepi is
imperishable, the king (?) of the great heaven, who
dwelleth in Het-Serqet. Ra hath drawn Pepi to the
sky, this Pepi liveth, just as he who entereth on the
right side of heaven and cometh forth from the left side,
liveth. Pepi commandeth Am-hent-f, and Am-Sep-f
&amp;lt;, . . Pepi is a star. The magical power of Ra is on
this Pepi, Ra weigheth not his magical power on this
Pepi. Horus throweth this Pepi on his shoulders, he
accounteth him as Shu, directing [his] hands under Nut.
O Ra, give thy hand to this Pepi ! O Great God, give
thy staff to Pepi and let him live for ever !
667.
&quot; Happy are those who see, those who rest in
Petet,&quot; saith I sis. This god cometh forth to heaven,
his soul is on him, his knife is with him, words of
power are his speech, and Tem doeth for him what he
did for himself. The gods who belong to heaven bring
this Pepi, and the gods who belong to earth embrace
him. They place their hands under him, they form a
ladder for him, and he entereth into heaven thereby.
The doors of heaven are open to him, the firmament
is thrown wide open before him. Tem hath gathered
together the nomes to him, and Keb hath given him towns which are called &quot;
Aats,&quot; the Aats of Horus, the Aats of Set, and Sekhet-Aaru. Pepi is Rahes, 2 Governor
of the South-land. Pepi is Tetun, Governor of Ta-sti



344 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
(Nubia). Pepi is Sept, under his Sebt trees. If ye
were to slay him, if ye were to order his death, he
would not die, for this Pepi shall most certainly live for
ever .... 669. Thou watchest in peace, Hesmenu, in peace.
Thou watchest in peace, Heru-abt, in peace. Thou
watchest in peace, Ba-abt, in peace. Thou watchest in
peace, Heru-khuti, in peace. Thou sleepest in the
Semktet Boat, thou wakest up in the Mantchet Boat,
behold, thou seest the Chief of the gods, but no god
seeth thy chief. O Ra, Father of Pepi, thou drawest
him with thee to life with thy mother Nut. Open the
doors of heaven to him, unfold the doors of the firmament to him, and let him be thy porter, and vivify thou him.
Command thou that he is to sit by thee, on the shoulders
of the Morning Star on the horizon. O Ra, Father of
Pepi, command the Great Bear which is near thee to
yield up its place to him _ on the Uart-ur under the
firmament, and command Ankh, the son of Septet, to
speak over (?) Pepi. Make him to establish a throne
for him in heaven. Pepi giveth orders to Ur-shepsef,
the beloved of Ptah, the son of Ptah. His words are on Pepi, he maketh to grow the tchefa food (or,
offering) in his abode on the earth. Pepi is one of
those four gods Amset, Hep, Tuamutef, and Qebhsenuf,
who live on Maat, who are exalted by reason of their
sceptres, and watch over (?) the Land of the South. He
flieth, he flieth from you, O men, like the geese, he
delivereth his hands from you like a hawk, he removeth
his body from you like a tchert bird. Deliver this
Pepi from Am-uart on the earth, remove him from
Am-aa.
682. Homage to thee, O Sycamore, companion of
the god, whereunder stand the gods of Nut ! Flame
blazeth about it, fire burneth inside it, Maat extinguished}
it (?). Those who are in Nu embrace thee, those who are in the canals put their arms about thee. Thy breast
is on the shoulder of Osiris, .... the Great Tet ....
Thou standest up, Osiris, thy shadow (?) is on thee,
O Osiris. Thy diadem repulseth Set .... The terror
of thee is on the wardens of the sky, the fear of thee is on
the wardens of the earth. Thou layest thy knife (?) on



Appendix 345
the hearts of the Kings of the North who are in the
town of Pe. This Pepi cometh to thee, O Horus, the
Heir of Keb, the Word of Tern. To thee is Tern and
the Two Companies of the Gods speak ; to thee is
Tern and thou speakest. Behold, this Pepi is the
counterpart of the gods who dwell in the sky. Those
who are in the canals embrace thee, those who are in
the imperishable stars encompass thee ....
685. Behold htm who cometh. Behold him who
cometh, saith Sehpu.
Behold, the son of Ra cometh, the beloved of Ra
cometh, saith Sehpu.
Let him come, let him come, saith Horus.
Behold him who cometh. Behold him who cometh,
saith Sehpu.
Behold, the son of Ra cometh, the beloved of Ra
cometh, saith Sehpu.
Let him come, let him come, saith Set.
Behold him who cometh. Behold him who cometh,
saith Sehpu.
Behold, the son of Ra cometh, the beloved of Ra
cometh, saith Sehpu.
Let him come, let him come, saith Keb.
Behold him who cometh. Behold him who cometh,
saith Sehpu.
Behold, the son of Ra cometh, the beloved of Ra
cometh, saith Sehpu.
Let him come, let him come, say the Souls of Anu
and the Souls of Pe.
Praise be to Ra, is what men say when they stand by
the side of Pepi on the earth. Behold, thou risest in
the East of the sky. Give thy hand to Pepi, and
draw thou him with thee to the eastern side of the sky. Praise be to Ra, is what men say when they
stand by the side of Pepi on the earth. Behold, thou
risest in the South of the sky. Give thy hand to
Pepi, and draw thou him with thee to the Southern
side of the sky. Praise be to Ra, is what men say
when they stand by the side of Pepi on the earth.
Behold, thou risest in the heart of the sky. Give thou
thy hand to Pepi, and draw thou him with thee to the



346 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
heart of the sky. Thine offerings are brought unto
thee, and gifts for thee are brought before thee. Saith Set, the brother of Osiris :
&quot; Place Osiris on his
side.&quot; Saith Ra :
&quot; Let the dweller in Netat move, and
&quot; raise up his head. The thing which he abominateth is
&quot;
sleep, what he hateth is weakness ; he shall not rot, he
&quot; shall not become corruption, this Pepi shall not
&quot;
perish.&quot; Saith your . . . . O gods :
&quot; Thou watchest
&quot; in peace. Osiris watcheth in peace. He who is in 11 Netat watcheth in peace.&quot;
&quot; Raise his head,&quot;saith Ra. &quot;His odour is that of the Uraeus.&quot; &quot; Raise the head of
11
Pepi,&quot; saith Ra. &quot; The odour of Pepi is that of the
&quot; Uraeus. He shall not rot, he shall not become corrup
&quot;
tion, this Pepi shall not perish,&quot; saith your Tchent,
O gods.
&quot; This Pepi is of thy seed, O Osiris [and
&quot;
Septet] in thy name of Am-Uatch-ur Heru-khent
&quot; khu. He shall not rot, he shall not become corrup
&quot;
tion, this Pepi shall not perish,&quot; saith your Tchent,
O gods. He cometh forth from his house clothed like
Horus, arrayed like Thoth. The mother of Pepi is thy Ant,
O God, the father of Pepi is Anu, and Pepi himself is thy
Anu, O God. Ra hath conceived Pepi, Ra hath brought
him forth, Pepi is of thy seed, of Ra and Septet, in thy
name of &quot;
Heru-khent-khu,&quot; the star which saileth over the Great Green Sea. &quot;He shall not rot, he shall not become corruption, he shall not perish,&quot; saith
your Tchent, O gods. He is one of the Four Gods,
children of Keb, who travel over the South and North, and stand by their sceptres, who are anointed with hatet
unguent, and arrayed in dtmd apparel, who live on figs,
and drink wine, and are anointed with that same substance wherewith ye are anointed. Pepi is dressed as
ye are dressed, he liveth upon what ye live upon, he
drinketh that which ye drink, he journeyeth with you, he
liveth upon what ye yourselves live on. Give ye to him
his allotted portion from that which your father Keb gave
unto you so that, having it, ye might not hunger or
perish. Stretch ye out your hands to this Pepi of life,
the sweetest smelling being of those who smell sweet.
Collect the bones of this Pepi, knit together his limbs. He
sitteth on his throne, he shall not rot, he shall not suffer
corruption, he shall not perish, saith your Tchent, O gods.



Appendix 347
694. Pepi cometh to you, O mother of Pepi, he
cometh to Nut. Thou makest him enter the sky, thou
makest the stars to withdraw before him, his odour is
like the odour of thy son who cometh forth from thee,
his odour is like the odour of Osiris thy son, who
cometh forth from thee. O Nu, Pepi hath raised his
arm to the sky, he ruleth the earth, and he giveth [it] to
thee. He cometh forth, he ascendeth to heaven. He
worketh magic for Ra, [he is] Heru-khent-khu, the
sweetest smelling of those who smell sweet. Thou
watchest in peace. Ra watcheth in peace. Thou
watchest in peace. Meta watcheth in peace. He giveth
a writing to this Pepi, into his hand, the sweetest
smelling of those who smell sweet. Osiris riseth, pure
of Sekhem, exalted, Lord of Maat at the New Year, Lord of the Year. Tern, the father of the gods, is at
peace. Shu and Tefnut are at peace. Keb and Nut
are at peace. Osiris and I sis are at peace. Set and
Neith are at peace. All the gods in heaven are at
peace, all the gods who are in the earth and in the water
are at peace, all the gods of the South and North are at
peace, all the gods of the West and East are at peace,
all the gods of the nomes are at peace, and all the gods
of the cities are at peace by reason of this great and
mighty word which cometh forth from the mouth of
Thoth to Osiris, the seal-bearer of life, the seal of the
gods. 697. Anubis, the judge of hearts, judgeth Osiris
Pepi with the gods who belong to the earth and the
gods who belong to heaven, the lord of wine in Uakh,
counting for him his year, remembering for him his
hours. Pepi counteth his year with him, he remembereth
his hours with him. Nu cometh, saith Tern. Come to
us, say they, say the gods to thee, Osiris. The brother
of the Eldest One cometh, the first of his father, the image of his mother. Heaven conceived him, the Tuat
brought him forth. Heaven conceived this Pepi with
him. The Tuat brought this Pepi forth with him.
Heaven beareth thee up on thy right side with life, and
thou livest, by the command of the gods thou livest.
Heaven beareth up this Pepi on his right side with life,
and he liveth, he liveth, by the command of the gods he



348 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
liveth. Thou rulest the earth on thy left side with the
sceptre, thou livest, thou livest, by the command of the
gods thou livest. Pepi ruleth heaven on his left side
with life, and he liveth, he liveth, by the command [of
the gods] he liveth. Pepi appeareth on the east side of
heaven, he descendeth like a green goose, he descendeth
to the Lakes of the Tuat. Pepi hath been purified in
the Lakes of the Smen Goose. Osiris Pepi, pass thou not through the Lands of the
East, but pass thou through the Lands of the West, by
the path of the Followers of Ra. Thy tribute cometh
to thee, thy messengers bear unto thee thy dues ; thy
ancestors march to thee, and they bear thee to Ra,
supporting the East on [their] sceptre[s]. Thou knowest
them, thou art gracious to them, thou settest them in
thy hands, they pasture for thee thy calves. Behold,
thou art their conqueror, they come into thy hands.
Thou goest forth to them, endowed with soul, provided
... in thy name of &quot; Smetu.&quot; Thy Nekhakha whip
is in thy hand, thy Mekes sceptre is near thee, those
who bow their faces make obeisance unto thee, and the imperishable stars adore thee. Behold, thou art their
conqueror, and they make their way into thy hands.
Thou bindest their faces in thy name of &quot;
Mehit.&quot; They
count thee up complete in thy name of &quot;A npu.&quot;
The gods do not come down to thee in thy name of J^
Thou standest upright at the head of the gods, \
thou eldest son ; behold thou art the heir on the V ~Y throne of Keb.
702. This coming forth of thine, O thou Osiris Pepi,
is in thine house. Horus cometh forth embracing thee,
O thou Osiris Pepi. Thy tribute cometh to thee, thy
messengers bear unto thee thy dues, thy servitors
surround thee, they say to Ra :
&quot; Behold, Pepi cometh to
&quot;
thee, the son of Keb, [he who is seated] on the throne
&quot; of Amen.&quot; Thou sailest over the Lake of Kha, thou
traversest the Lake of Kenset. Thou bowest at the east side of heaven, thou takest thy seat in the two
Halls of the Horizon. Thou stretchest out thy hand to
them, thou stretchest out thine hand to the gods ; they
give unto thee praises, they come unto thee with bowings
of their backs in homage. They praise thee as they



Appendix 349
praise Ra, they come with bowings to thee as they do to Ra. 704. Smite, Father, the Bull Sma-ur. Thou smitest,
Father, thou slayest the Great Bull. O Father, Osiris Pepi, the Bull is smitten, smitten for thee, smitten for
thee, smitten by the Smiter (or, Slaughterer). The
Nek Bull is smitten for thee, smitten. Thou art upon
his back, upon the back of the Bull. Thou openest the
Bull with thy weapon. Thou drivest thy lance into the
Bull. Thou takest him by the ear. His head is cut off.
His tail is cut off. His forelegs are cut off. His
haunches are cut off. His haunch is to serve as a haunch before Tern, the father of the gods. His two
cheeks (?) are for Shu and Tefnut. His two jaw-bones
are for Keb and Nut. His two flanks are for I sis and Nephthys. His two khentchui are for Khent-merti and
Nest (?). His backbone (?) is for Neith and Serqet. His heart is for Sekhmet-urt. His intestines are for the Four Gods whom Horus brought forth, and who are
beloved by him, Hep, Amkest (?), Tuamutef, and
Qebhsenuf. His head, his tail, his forelegs, his hind
legs, are for Anpu-tep-tu and Osiris- Khent-ment-f.
The character (?) of the gods is in him, of the Souls of
Nekhen, of the Souls of Pe. [He] eateth the red bull,
[he] journeyeth on the Lake. Horus hath done [this]
for his father Osiris, this Pepi.
Behold, this is thy habitation, Hent-het (?), O Osiris
Pepi. The winds are brought to it, the north wind is
collected therein, and it raiseth thee up in the form of
Osiris Pepi. The god Shesmu cometh to thee with
water and wine ; Khent-ment-f [cometh] with vessels of
drink for the Chief of the two Atert-gods. Thou standest up, thou sittest like Anpu, Chief of Ta-Tchesert.
The god Aker standeth up before thee, Shu riseth to
meet thee. Hep (the Nile) trembleth at the sight [of
thee] . . . The pools are full of fragrant flowers,
the banks of the canals are covered with blossoms. The offerings of the gods come. Men are glad, and the
hearts of the gods rejoice.
709. Pepi cometh to thee, Horus, and thou declarest
unto him that great and beautiful word which thou didst
utter to Osiris. Pepi becometh great by means of it,
VOL. II. 2 A



350 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
and he becometh mighty thereby. He hath gained
possession of his viscera, his BA (heart-soul) is with him,
he is prepared with his head, which Horus gave unto
Osiris. He is established in heaven as firmly as a
mountain [is established in the earth], and is like the
support of heaven. He swoopeth down upon heaven
like the great crane ahau, which pursueth his way
through the tresses of heaven. The feathers upon his
pinions are like unto sharp knives of flint, he giveth to
Pepi the nails of his claws. The star Septet (Sothis)
graspeth the hand of Pepi. Pepi plougheth the earth,
he slaughtered! the captive victim for an offering. The
two Nomes of the god roar at Pepi when he advanceth
to become the Chief of the gods._ He taketh his seat
on his crystal (?) throne, and the Ab sceptre which is in
his hand [is] crystal. He lifteth up his hand to the
children of their fathers, they stand up before him, he
layeth his hand upon them, they sit down. His face is
like that of the jackal, his interior is like the Nome of
Aphroditopolis. He passeth judgment like Sebek, the
dweller in Shetet, and like Anpu (?), the dweller in
Tabet. Pepi crieth out to a thousand (?), and the
Henmemet Spirits come to him bowing their backs in
homage, and they say unto him :
&quot; Who hath done this for thee?&quot; Behold, the Mother of Pepi is the goddess
Smat-urt, she who hath long hair, and a headdress of
flowing hair, and long, pendent breasts. 1 She beareth
Pepi up to heaven, not allowing him to touch the ground, among the glorious gods. Pepi looketh upon their
splendour, and himself becometh splendid likewise, Pepi
[resembleth] his father Osiris, and the Henmemet Spirits
glorify him (or, make him glorious).
Homage to thee, Tern ! Homage to thee, Kheprer,
thou self-created one ! Thou art exalted in thy name of
&quot;Qa,&quot; thou comest into being in thy name of Kheprer.
Homage to thee, O Eye of Horus ! He is equipped
with his arms and hands completely. He will not
allow thee to be heard by those in the west, he will

not permit thee to be heard by those in the east, he
will not permit thee to be heard by those in the south,
he will not permit thee to be heard by those in the
north, he will not permit thee to be heard by those in
the middle of the earth, [but] thou shalt be heard by
Horus. There shall be performed for him everything
which he speaketh in every place whither he shall go.
Water (?) shall be raised up for him there, water (?)
shall be raised up for him when it is there. Thy staff
shall be lifted up for him there, thy staff shall be lifted
up for him when he is there. Food-offerings shall be
raised up for him there, food-offerings shall be raised
up for him when he is there. The henket-offerings
shall be raised up for him there, they shall be raised up
for him when they are there. Everything shall be
raised up for him there, and it shall be raised when it is
there. He shall be transported to every place wherein
he desireth to be.
&amp;lt;
The celestial doors stand [closed]
for thee through Anmutf. 1 They shall not open to those in the west, they shall not open to those in the
east, they shall not open to those in the north, they shall not open to those in the south, they shall not open
to those in the middle of the earth. They shall open to
Horus, he worketh them, he maketh them to stand [closed].
He delivereth them from every deadly thing which Set
doeth unto them. He holdeth thee fast2 in thy name of
&quot;
Ker[k]-shet.&quot; He conducteth and followeth after thee
in thy name of &quot;
Nut.&quot; He delivereth thee from every
deadly thing which Set doeth unto thee. Nut wel
cometh (?), welcometh (?) thee, Keb hath decreed thee
to be welcomed (?) in thy name of &quot;
Nut.&quot; . . .
Osiris [Pepi], thy mother Nut spreadeth herself over
thee in her name of &quot;

exist as god ; no enemy is to thee in thy name of

her name of &quot; Khnemet-urt.&quot; Thou art the greatest of
her children. Osiris [Pepi], thou art the double of all
the gods. Horus toucheth thee, and thou becomest his double. Hail, Keb, this Osiris [Pepi]3 is the son of Shu. Thy

mother overflowed! [with love] for thee in thy name of
&quot; Keb.&quot; Thou art the first-born son of Shu, his image.
Hail, Keb, this is the Osiris [Pepi], present thou to him
everything which belongeth to him. Thou art the great
God, the One alone. Tern hath given unto thee his
heirship. The Company of the gods hath given unto
thee offerings, and, behold, it is Tern himself who pre
senteth them to thee, and so maketh an offering to his
grandson thyself! He looketh at thee ; thou art splendid,
thy heart is great. Thou art glorious in thy name of
&quot;
Re-pan,&quot; the hereditary Chief of the gods. Thou
standest upon the earth. Thou dost issue thy decrees
of doom before the gods. Thy fathers and thy mothers
are before them. Thou art the strongest of all the gods.
This Osiris cometh to thee, defend thou him against his
enemies. Hail, Keb Re-pan, Chief of the gods, the
Osiris [Pepi] is thy son. Make thou to live thy son
in him. Make thou strong thy son in him. Thou art
the Lord of the earth to its uttermost limit. Thou art as strong as the Company of the gods, behold, thou
art as every god. Thou art strong, remove thou every
evil thing from this Osiris. Delay not, come thou to
him in thy name of &quot; Horus, whose work delayeth not.&quot;
Thou art the Ka of all the gods. Thou bringest them,
thou rearest them, thou vivifiest them ; vivify thou this
Osiris. Thou art God, strong as all the gods. The
Eye appeareth from thy head as Urt-hekau of the South, the Eye appeareth from thy head as Urt-hekau
of the North. 1 Horus followeth thee, he loveth thee.
Thou art crowned King of the South and North, strong
as all the gods and their Doubles also.
Stand up. Give thou thy hand to Horus, he
maketh thee to stand up, Keb smiteth for thee thy
mouth, the Great Company of the gods &quot; touch &quot; thee.
They place Set under thee, his offerings are under thee ;
they protect thee from him when he spitteth at thee. Nut
boweth down over her son in thee, she protecteth thee,
she uniteth herself to thee, she embraceth thee, she raiseth thee up, thou art the greatest among her children.
Thy two sisters come to thee Isis and Nephthys

they retreat from the place where thou art. Thy sister
I sis stretcheth out her hand to thee, she consoleth (?) thee
Kamt-urt through thy name of Kamt-urt. Thou
encirclest everything with thy hand in thy name of
&quot; Teben Ha-nebu.&quot; 1 Thou art mighty through thy name
of &quot; Aa-sek.&quot;2 Horus bringeth Set to thee, he giveth him
to thee, he (Set) boweth his back before thee, thy strength
(or, valour) is greater than his. Horus maketh thee to
encircle with thy hand all the gods (i.e., all the gods are
in the hollow of thy hand). Horus loveth his father in
thee, he permitteth not thee to be injured. Horus is not
more wonderful than thou, he avengeth his father in thee.
Thou livest with the life of the Beetle (Khepera?), thou
art firmly established in Tetet (Busiris). Isis and
Nephthys work protection by magic for thee in the city
of Saut, 3 they recognize thee as their lord in thy name
of &quot;
Neb-Saut,&quot; and as their god in thy name of
&quot; She-neter.&quot; They adore thee ; depart not thou from
them. Isis cometh to thee rejoicing at thy love. Thy
seed entereth her, she becometh heavy with childlike
Sept (Sothis). Heru-Sept cometh forth from thee in his
name of &quot; Horus in Septet.&quot; Thou shinest in him in his
name of Khu-am-tchenteru. 4 Horus avengeth thee
through his name &quot; Horus the son who avengeth his
father.&quot;
The Father standeth up, and this Osiris [Pepi]
standeth up. 5 I am he, thy son. I am Horus. I have
come to thee to wash thee, to purify thee, to vivify thee, to knit together thy bones, to collect thy humours, to
unite thy hacked flesh. Behold, I am Horus the avenger
of his father. I have smitten thee, smitten ; I have
saved thee, O father Osiris, from the hand of him that would do thee harm. I have come unto thee as the

354 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
Envoy of Horus, who set thee, O father Osiris, upon the
throne of Ra-Tem. Thou guidest the Henmemet Spirits.
Thou embarkest in the Boat of Ra, the approach of which
the gods love, and they love to embark therein. In it
Ra saileth to the horizon, [Pepi] embarketh therein as
doth Ra. Thou sittest on the throne of Ra, thou makest
decrees for the gods. Thou art Ra appearing on the
horizon ; Ra is born every day, and [Pepi] is born every
day like Ra. Thou hast taken possession of ^the
inheritance of thy father Keb before the gods in Anu
(Heliopolis), the Company of the gods consenting, the
great and mighty Company of the gods, in the presence
of the Souls of Anu. And those two great and mighty
gods who are over Sekhet Aru set thee upon the throne
of Horus, and behold it is they who place Shu on thine
east side, Tefnut on thy west side, Nu on thy south side,
and Nenet1 on thy north side. And they lead thee to their
beautiful and pure seats (or, places) which they made
[ready] for Ra when they set him upon their thrones.
They make thee to live more years than those of Heru
khuti, when they made for him the name of &quot; Herar-neteru &quot;
(i.e., higher than the gods&quot;). They recite
for thee this chapter as they do for Ra-Tem as he shineth
each day. They set thee upon their thrones at the head
of all the gods, even as they do Ra [when] making him
to take his seat. 2 They make this [Pepi] to be like Ra,
through his name of &quot;
Kheprer.&quot;
3 Thou advancest towards them as doth Ra through his name of Ra, and
thou retreatest from them as doth Ra through his name
of &quot;Tern.&quot; The Two Companies of the gods rejoice,
Father, at their meeting thee, O father Osiris [Pepi], and
they say, &quot;Come to us ; this is our brother.&quot; The Two
Companies of the gods say to Osiris [Pepi],
&quot; Father
Osiris [Pepi], come to us, [thou art] one of us.&quot; The
Two Companies of the gods say to thee, &quot; Father Osiris
[Pepi], come to us, O eldest son of his father.&quot; The
Two Companies of the gods say to thee, &quot; Father Osiris
[Pepi] is the begetter of his mother.&quot; The Two
Companies of the gods say to thee, &quot; Father Osiris [Pepi],
&quot; come thou to us, O thou to whom thy brother Set



Appendix 355
&quot; caused death.&quot; The Two Companies of the gods
say,
&quot; Most assuredly Set cannot make to be a vain thing
our exalting of thee for ever, O father Osiris [Pepi].&quot;
The Two Companies of the gods say to thee, &quot; Father
&quot; Osiris [Pepi], thou art exalted ; Father Osiris [Pepi],
&quot; thou livest !&quot;
The Eye of Horus is set on the pinion of his brother
Set [when] the son of Tern worketh the tackle and
maketh the boats to sail together. The son of Tern
shall not suffer shipwreck. This [Pepi] belongeth to the
son of Tern, the son of Tern shall not suffer shipwreck
(Mer-en-Ra, 1. 785).
Hail, thou god Ubnena, who revolvest, 1 Kheprer,
Kheprer, thou art for Pepi, and Pepi is for thee. Thy
life is for Pepi, and the life of Pepi is for thee. Hail,
Green One, proceeding from the Green Goddess
(Uatchet), thou hast proceeded from Pepi, and Pepi hath
proceeded from thee. Pepi is strong through thy
strength. The god Hu2 is at noon the meat and drink
of Pepi, Akeb3 is [his] food in the evening, the food of
Pepi. The Hettut apes cannot gain the mastery over
the life of Pepi. The town of Sensent4 is remote from
Pepi. Pepi liveth on thine overflow, Pepi is over
whelmed with the great abundance of thy food, O Ra,
each day. O Father of Pepi, stand up ! Thou hast
received thy libations, of the best of the water which
cometh forth from Akh-khebit. Those who are in their sepulchres stand up, and turn over your .... and
measure the grain before thy face (?). Thou risest on thy
left side, thou art strong on thy right side. Lift up thy
face and see what I have done for thee. I, thy son,
thine heir, have trodden (?) the barley, and ploughed the
wheat, grain for the Uak festivals, barley for thy offerings
of spring plants. The Eye of Horus is presented unto thee, it groweth old before thee, it departeth before thee.
O Lord of the House, 5 thy hand is on thy possessions.



356 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
The1 doors of heaven open, the doors of the water
ways of heaven are unclosed before the gods who dwell
in Pe, [when] they come to Osiris Pepi, at the sound of
the weeping of Isis, at the noise of the cry of Nephthys,
at the wailing of these two Spirits for this great one,
which cometh forth from Tat (Netat ?). Get ye gone,
O Souls of Pe. They beat their bodies for thee, they
smite their hands together for thee, they pluck out their
hairs for thee, they beat their thighs for thee, and they
say to thee, O Osiris Pepi:
&quot; Advance, come, lie down, awake thou, come into port, thou livest. Stand up and
behold what thy son hath done for thee. Awake, and
hearken thou to what thy son Horus hath done for thee,
He hath smitten for thee, smitten the Ox (or, Bull). He
hath slain for thee, slain the Sma Bull. He hath bound him with cords for thee, he hath placed him under thy
great daughter dwelling in Ketem. Lamentation is
ended (?) at the Aterti (temples) of the gods.&quot; Osiris
saith to Horus :
&quot; The evil which appertaineth to Pepi
shall exude on the fourth day, he shall not know what
hath been done to him on the eighth day.&quot; Thou
appearest from the Lake of Life, being purified in the
Lake of Qebh. Thou hast become like Ap-uat. Thy
son Horus maketh thee advance. He hath given to
thee the gods who are thine enemies, Thoth bringeth
them to thee. Happy are those who see. Content are
those who behold, who see Horus. He giveth life to
his divine Father, he maketh great the serenity of Osiris,
as Chief of the gods of Amenti. Isis poureth holy
water over thee, Nephthys purifieth thee. Thy two
great and mighty sisters gather together thy flesh, they
raise up thy members, they make thine eyes to appear
like crowns in thy head, the Semktet Boat and the
Mantchet Boat. Tern is given to thee, the Two Com
panies of the gods work for thee. The children of thy
children2 lift thee up, viz., Hep, Amset, Tuamutef, and
Oebhsenuf, and they also make for thee their names.
They wash thy face, they collect (?) thy tears, they open
thy mouth with their fingers of iron (?). Thou appearest coming forth into the Hall of Tern, thou journeyest to

the Sekhet-Aaru, thou sailest over the seats of the great
god. Heaven is given unto thee, earth is given unto
thee, Sekhet-Aaru is given unto thee. And lo ! the two
great gods transport thee, Shu and Tefnut, the two great
gods of Anu. Awake, stand up ! This Spirit came
forth from Tat, Osiris Pepi cometh forth from Keb.
Hail, Pepi ! Thou art the son of the great god. Thou
hast been purified in the Lake of Tatta, thou hast received thy throne in Sekhet-Aaru. 805. Thy water is to thee, thine abundance is to thee,
thy effluxes are to thee, coming forth from Osiris. Thou
collectest thy bones, thou settest in place thy members,
thou puttest in order the fluids in thee, thou workest thy
cords. The hat chamber (tomb) is open for thee, the
doors of the sarcophagus are drawn asunder, and the
gates of heaven are thrown wide open. I sis welcometh thee, Nephthys said,
&quot; In Peace &quot;
(i.e., welcome). They
see their brother at the festival of Tern. These libations,
O Osiris, protect thy flesh in Kerkubaf. Thy soul is
within thee. Thy Power (sekhem) is nigh thee, thou art
stablished as the Chief of thy Powers. Thou art lifted
up, Osiris Pepi ! Thou rushest upon the Domains of
the South, thou rushest upon the Domains of the North.
Thou hast the mastery of the Powers which are in thee.
Thou makest thy spirits jackals, which are given to thee
by Horus of Nekhen. Thou art raised up, O Pepi, sit
thou upon thy crystal (?) throne, by the decree of Anpu,
Chief of the Divine Hall. Thou art purified with thy
eight libations, [and] eight nemset vases, and dabet vases,
which came forth from the God-house. God therefore
art thou, bearing up heaven on thy shoulders, and sup
porting the earth. Smentet 1 supplicateth thee, Ment-urt2
addresseth thee. Hands are turned aside for thee, removed (?) for thee are feet. This appearance of thine
is like that of a star, the Morning Star. 3 He cometh to
thee, his Father, he cometh to thee, Keb. Take his
hand, make his seat to be on the Great Throne. He uniteth with the two Channels (?) of Qebhu (the
&quot;l-fl



358 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
Sky). His mouth is purified with incense and natron
on the thighs of Khent-Merti. 1 His nails, upper and
lower, are made clean. There hath been done for him that which thou didst do for his brother Osiris on the
day of counting up the bones, of making firm sandals,
and of sailing over Uart-urt. 2
814. The great one boweth over his side, the god
standeth up ; his power is with him, his Ureret Crown
is on him. Pepi boweth over his side, the god Pepi
standeth up ; his power is with him, his Ureret Crown
is on him, as the Ureret Crown is [on] Ra. He cometh
forth from the horizon, and ... in the horizon avengeth
him. Hail, Pepi ! Thou art raised up. Thou hast
received thy seal which the Two Companies of the gods
made for thee. Thou art on the throne, in the seat of Khenti Amenti. Thou hast received his power, thou
hast received his Ureret Crown. Hail, Pepi, beautiful
and great are these things which thy father Osiris hath
done for thee. He hath given thee his throne. Thou
makest decrees for those whose places are hidden, thou
guidest their noble ones, and all the Spirits follow thee
according to their names.
Hail, Pepi, thy heart is glad, great is thy breast, thou
shalt never cease to be thus. Ra calleth thee by thy
name ; all the Spirits fear him. Thou slayest their
hearts as doth Ra when he cometh forth from the
horizon. Hail, thou Pepi! He whose form is hidden,
that is Anubis, [croucheth] on his belly. Thou hast
received thy face of a jackal ; thou art raised up, stand upright ! Sit for thy thousand cakes, thy thousand
vessels of beer, thy thousand oxen, thy thousand geese,
and thy thousand things whereon the god liveth there.
Hail, Pepi, thou art pure. Ra findeth thee, thou standest
with my mother Nut, she guideth thee over the roads
of the horizon. Thou passest thy day happily with thy
Ka for ever and ever.

injure not Pepi. Strike not the word of power from the
hand of Pepi, snatch not away the word of Pepi from
the hand of Pepi. Thy word of power is to Pepi, the
word of power of Pepi is to him.
950. O Mighty Heaven, give the hand to Pepi. O
Great Sky, give the hand to Pepi. Pepi is thy divine
hawk. Pepi cometh, he appeareth in heaven, he
cleaveth Qebhu (i.e., the sky). Pepi doeth homage to
his father Ra, he ministereth to him like Horus, Pepi
cometh to him. Ra maketh Pepi to rise a new being.
He establisheth for Pepi his two eyes.
1 Pepi cometh
before him, great like Horus of Nu, with the lock of
hair, he smiteth the Crowns of_the North, 2 he issueth
decrees to the Utennu. 3 The Afa gods4 follow in the
train of Pepi, and those who are at the head of heaven
and earth come to him with bowings of homage, and the
Two Uraei, and the Jackals and the Spirits, and the
Set-gods, upper and lower, 5 act as guides to him.
Anointed with perfume, arrayed in pat, and living on
offerings, Pepi issueth decrees, putteth the Doubles
under a yoke, and occupieth the thrones. Pepi giveth
offerings, Pepi conducteth ceremonies of offerings, Pepi
himself is the ONE of heaven, the master of what he doeth, Chief of Nent. 6
953. Homage to thee, Pepi, saith Seker. Wash thy
face, saith the Great Morning Star (?).
7 Pepi swoopeth
down like the divine hawk. Pepi entereth the water like
the great crane. Pepi maketh a noise like the Smen
goose. The pinions of Pepi are like those of the divine
hawk, and the tips of the pinions of Pepi are like those
of the divine hawk. The bones of Pepi are lifted up ;
he is pure. The loin-cloth of Pepi is about his loins.
The qend garment is on his shoulders, and his girdle is
attached to his tunic (?). Pepi embarketh with Ra in



360 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
his Great Boat, and he worketh it on with him to the
horizon to issue decrees to the gods therein. Horus
roweth with him in the Great Boat to the horizon. Pepi
issueth decrees to the gods therein with him in the
horizon, Pepi is one of them.
955. Behold the things which they say concerning
Pepi, what the gods say concerning Pepi, the words
which the gods speak concerning Pepi :
&quot; This is
Horus coming out of Hep (the Nile). This is the Neka
bull coming forth from the walled camp. This is the
serpent which cometh forth from Ra. This is the uraeus
which cometh forth from Set. Everything happeneth for
Pepi even as it happeneth for the goddess Metchetet-at, 1
the daughter of Ra, who is on the knees of Ra. Every
thing happeneth for Pepi even as it happeneth for the
goddess Metcha, 2 the daughter of Ra, on the knees of
Ra. Behold, Pepi is the god Utcha, 3 the son of Utcha,
the issue of Utchat. 4 Strong is Pepi, strong is Pepi,
strong is the Eye of Horus in Anu. Pepi liveth, Pepi
liveth, the Eye of Horus liveth in Anu. Pepi cometh
forth as thou comest forth, Osiris. Pepi speaketh to his
Double in heaven. The bones of Pepi are crystal, the
flesh of Pepi is like the imperishable stars. 5 If Pepi be
set there the Great Goddess boweth herself over the arms of Pepi. The mother of Pepi is Nut. The father 01
Pepi is Shu, the mother of Pepi is Tefnut, they raise
Pepi to heaven on the flame of incense. Purified is Pepi, living is Pepi ; moreover, he maketh his seat to
be Osiris. Pepi sitteth on thy arm, Osiris, Pepi spitteth
on thy hair.
959. Pepi is one of those four [gods] who are the
children of Tern, the children of Nut. They do not
suffer corruption, Pepi doth not suffer corruption. They
decay not, Pepi decayeth not. They do not fall to the
earth from heaven, Pepi doth not fall to the earth from
heaven. They embrace Pepi, they find Pepi with them,



Appendix 361
Pepi is one of them, a favoured one of the Bull of Heaven,
Pepi raiseth up his Ka, maketh [it] turn back, maketh [it]
stay [with him]. O beautiful warder, raise up the Ka,
make [it] turn back, make [it] stay [with him]. There
fore is Pepi stable under the constellation [called] the
&quot;
Belly of the Sky
&quot; l in the form of a beautiful star [shining] over the bends of the Lake of Kha. Pepi
cometh forth into the sky, thou givest to Pepi this
Chapter, he is happy with Ra every day. Pepi setteth
himself on thy way, O Heru-shest, 2 along which thou guidest the gods to the beautiful ways of the sky [and]
of Sekhet-hetep.
968. The water of life cometh into heaven, the water
of life cometh on the earth. The sky catcheth fire
before thee, the earth quaketh before thee, at the hands
of the Children of God. The two mountains are cleft,
the god appeareth, and the god hath the mastery over
his own body. The two mountains are cleft, Pepi
appeareth, and Pepi hath the mastery over his own
body. Behold, Pepi breatheth the air. His feet stand
by the pure water which is with Tern, and which hath
been produced by the phallus of Shu and the body of
Tefnut, 3 for they have come and brought to thee the
pure water which is with their father [Tern]. They
purify thee [therewith]. They cense thee, Pepi. Thou
liftest up the sky on the palm of thy hand, thou placest
the earth under thy sandal. There is a laver of the
water of heaven at the door of this Pepi, [wherein] each
god washeth [his] face. Thou washest thy hands
therein, O Osiris, thou washest thy hands therein, O
Pepi, and thou renewest thy youth, the third god (?),

cometh to Pepi, as do the pyramidal loaf in Het-Seker
and the thigh in the House of Anpu. Pepi is strong,
the shrine standeth ready, the month is born, the nome
is alive, and the towing cords are worked ; thou
ploughest for wheat, thou ploughest for barley. Gifts
are made to Pepi there for ever.
971. Unguent of Horus! Unguent of Set! Horus
taketh possession of his Eye, and delivereth it from his
enemies ; Set hath not been able to keep it [from him].
When Horus hath filled his Eye with the unguent he is
content with (or, resteth on) his Eye ; he is provided
with his . . . ., he joineth himself to it, its odour is
with him. Its violent wrath falleth upon his enemies.
This unguent is to Pepi, he hath filled himself therewith,
he hath united himself thereto, and its odour is on him ; its violent wrath shall fall on the enemies of Pepi.
974. These four Divine Kinsmen2 of Pepi, Amkest,
Hep, Tuamutef, and Qebhsenuf, children of Horus of
Sekhem (Letopolis), stand up, and they bind with bands
the Ladder of Pepi, and they make permanent the
Ladder of Pepi, and they make Pepi to approach the
god Kheprer, 3 when he cometh into being in the eastern sky. The god Ashsamer (?)
4 hath shaped with an adze
the wood. The god Kas...ut, 5 the Bull of Heaven, hath fastened firmly with knots the leathers (?) belonging to
it. The rungs have been firmly fixed in the sides by
means of the [leather made of] the skin of the god . . . .
6
born of the goddess Hesat. 7 The goddess Sepeh-urt8
maketh it to be set up by a band under it. The Ka of
Pepi is raised up [by this Ladder] to the god, and he is
taken to the god Ruruta9 who leadeth him forward to



Appendix 363
Tern. Tern hath done what he said he would do for Pepi ; he hath tied bands for him about the Ladder, and
he hath made it strong for Pepi. This Pepi is remote
from that which is an abomination to men, and he shall not handle that which is an abomination to the gods, he
shall not eat that which is . . . ., he shall not lie down
[in death ?] in the night, he shall not keep vigil. He is
not without his body like one of the two growths (?) of
Kheprer. The bodies of those who are in Tat are
reckoned up, and their ears are open to the voice of
Pepi. He goeth down among them, reciting the decree
of Sekhmef (?). The existence of Pepi is like that of one
who is among them. The staff (?) of Pepi is among
them like the god of the Great Staff, 1 making his advance
to Am-urt. The seal of Pepi is in the House of Ruruta.
The god who obliterateth sin, Ater-asfet, 3 obliterateth
the transgressions which belong to Pepi in the presence
of Khenti-merti in Sekhem.3

ADDITIONAL NOTES
1. THE CREATION. The Bushongo legend is as
follows : In the beginning there was nothing but
darkness, and on the earth there was nothing but
water ; in this chaos Bumba, the Chembe (God, = the
Egyptian Tern), reigned alone. Bumba had the form
of a huge man, and his colour was white. One day,
owing to pains in his stomach, he vomited, and the sun,
moon, and stars were the result. The water ran off the
sand and left it dry, but there was neither vegetation
nor animal life upon it. Bumba again vomited and
brought up : i. The leopard, Koy Bumba ; 2. The
crested eagle, Ponga Bumba ; 3. The crocodile, Ganda
Bumba ; 4. A little fish, Yo Bumba ; 5. The tortoise,
Kono Bumba ; 6. The thunderbolt (a black animal like
a leopard), Tsetse Bumba ; 7. A white heron, Nyanyi
Bumba ; 8. A scarab ; 9. A goat. He afterwards
vomited men, but there was only one of them white
like himself, and he called him Loko Yima. The creatures mentioned above produced all the other
creatures which filled the world. Nyonye Ngana, a
son of Bumba, vomited the white ants, and died. Another son, Chonganda, vomited a plant which was
the parent of all vegetation, and a third son vomited
kites, but nothing else. King Bumba made Loko Yima &quot;god upon earth &quot;
(Chembe Kunji), and then ascended
into heaven. Torday and Joyce, Notes Ethnographiques,
p. 21. ^
2. THE SOUL. The Bambala think that man is composed of four elements : Lo, the body ; Ilo, the
double (Ka) ; N shanga, the soul ; and Lume-Lume,
the shadow. The Bushongo also think that man is com
posed of four elements : Modyo, the body ; Mophuphu,
the soul; Ido, the double (Ka) ; and Edidingi, the
shadow. Torday and Joyce, Notes Ethnographiques, p. 124. 3. THE AMULET OF &quot;
LIFE,&quot; ?. It has already
been shown in this book that two of the most important



Additional Notes 365
amulets of the Egyptians, U and ||, represent the os
i \ TJr
sacrum of Osiris, and the uterus and its ligatures and vagina of I sis. They symbolized the vital power of
Osiris and I sis, procreation, new birth, fecundity, and
resurrection. Hence we find them, with appropriate
formulae, in the Book of the Dead, and on coffins we
see frequently one hand grasping u and the other
i.e., the fetishes which held the spirits of life-power of
Osiris and Isis. There is, however, another amulet, i.e.,
which has, up to the present, defied all explanation.
That it was of vital importance to the living and the
dead is proved by its frequent occurrence on the monu
ments and in papyri. About its meaning &quot; life
&quot; there
is no doubt, but the identity of the object is difficult to
discover. Now as the Tet, u, represents the os sacrum
of Osiris, and the thet, |L, represents the uterus and vagina
of Isis, it is only natural to think that the sign
also represents some part or organ of the body either
of Osiris or Isis, and preferably some member of the
body of Isis. As is intimately connected in the
vignette of Chapter XVI of the Book of the Dead with
the rising sun, and was presented to Isis by Amen-Ra
(see Vol. I, p. 301), when she was giving birth to Horus,
it is clearly associated with new life and childbirth and,
one would think, with the womb of Isis, or with some thing in it which was connected closely with the growth
of the foetus. Reference has already been made to the
importance attached to the umbilical cord by modern
Sudani peoples (for the passages, see the Index), and
to the disposal of the placenta, and analogy suggests
that the primitive Egyptians attached as much import
ance to these objects as to the uterus itself. I discussed
the matter with Dr. W. L. Nash, and he informs me
that the sign may well be a conventional representa
tion of the placenta and umbilical cord as they appear
after they have left the body, the oval loop of the sign VOL. II. 2 B



366 Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection
being intended for the placenta, the projections at the
side for ligatures, and the straight line below for the
umbilical cord. The placenta and the umbilical cord
taken together would make a very powerful fetish, of
the same character as if and (, and I believe them to
L\ /lr
be the objects represented by the sign --, or &quot;life.&quot; If
this be so, u, jj\ and were fetishes, in the truest sense
of the word, of the same class. Since writing the above,
Messrs. Seligmann and Murray have published a paper
in Man, Vol. XI, No. 8, p. 1 13 ff., in which they attempt
to show that the sign V also represents the uterus of
Isis, and hence was associated with childbirth. If this
be so, the ancient Egyptian ideas connected with JL
tO)
and v were all transferred by the Christian Egyptians
to the Cross.
