BLOOD OF THE GODS
Are you an Rh Negative blood type? If so you could be a decendent of the ancient astronauts themselves!
About a year and a half ago my sister Bonnie and I were discussing some of the unusual characteristics of our family. Bonnie had a problem with infants haemolytic disease. She has 0 negative blood. She has written a book including this problem called "The Deux" by Venus Thaddeus. One of the questions we asked was why does this haemolytic disease occur? Why, along with the Rh negative blood does our family have such a high IQ (135-140 average). Why so many psychic experiences? Why this urge to ask "why?" Why the early maturity or the large head and eyes? Why have, we always felt we were "different" from other people. And so many other things to set us apart.
We were raised in the church, but we never received answers to the questions we asked. Why doesn't anyone else ask these same questions? We are not satisfied with the answer "just because". Are there others out there who ask the same questions? Then we heard about the possibility of the ancient astronauts and the pieces started to fall into place.
For the past decade many people have been working to prove that the earth has been visited by extraterrestrial beings. Who are these visitors? Why did they come? Why did they leave? Did they leave?
If earth was visited in the ancient past, are there any descendants of these visitors? If all mankind are not descendants of these visitors, which ones are? Who are the "Children of Israel?" Why was their seed blessed? Why were they told not to inter-marry with other people and to circumcise their sons for identification? Why were they told to preserve their geneology? Where did Adam and Eve's sons go to get their wives, if they were the only "humans" on earth?
Many scientists believe that modern man evolved from ape-like primates. They have much proof to back up their theories, including modern blood analysis and comparative studies between modern man and lower anthripoids, such as the chimpanzee and the Rhesus monkey.
It has been proven that the majority of mankind (85%) has a blood factor common with the rhesus monkey. This is called rhesus positive blood. Usually shortened to Rh positive. This factor is completely independent from the A, B, 0 blood types.
In the study of genetics, we find that we can only inherit what our ancestors had except in the case of mutation. We can have any of numerous combinations of traits inherited from all our ancestors. Nothing more and nothing less. Therefore, if man and ape evolved from a common ancestor, their blood would have evolved the same way. Blood factors are transmitted with much more exactitude than any other characteristic. It would seem that modern man and rhesus monkey may have had a common ancestor sometime in the ancient past. All other earthly primates also have this Rh factor. But this leaves out the people who are Rh negative. If all mankind evolved from the same ancestor their blood would be compatible. Where did the Rh negatives come from? If they are not the

descendants of prehistoric man, could they be the descendants of the ancient astronauts?
All animals and other living creatures known to man can breed with any other of their species. Relative size and color makes no difference. Why does infant's haemolytic disease occur in humans if all humans are the same species? Haemolytic disease is the allergic reaction that occurs when an Rh negative mother is carrying a Rh positive child. Her blood builds up antibodies to destroy an ALIEN substance (the same way it would a virus), thereby destroying the infant. Why would a mother's body reject her own offspring? Nowhere else in nature does this occur naturally. This same problem does occur in mules - a cross between a horse and donkey. This fact alone points to the distinct possibility of a cross-breeding between two similar but genetically different species.
No one has tried to explain where the Rh negative people came from. Most, familiar with blood factors, admit that these people must at least be a mutation if not descendants of a different ancestor. If we are a mutation, what caused the mutation? Why does it continue with the exact characteristics? Why does it so violently reject the Rh factor, if it was in their own ancestry? Who was this ancestor? Difficulties in determining ethnology are largely overcome by the use of blood group data, for they are a single gene characteristic and not affected by the environment.
The Basque people of Spain and France have the highest percentage of Rh negative blood. About 30% have (rr) Rh negative and about 60% carry one (r) negative gene. The average among most people is only 157%-Rh negative, while some groups have very little. The Oriental Jews of Israel, also have a high percent Rh negative, although most other Oriental people have only about 1% Rh negative. The Samaritans and the Black Cochin Jew also have a high percentage of Rh negative blood, although again the Rh negative blood is rare among most black people.
Could the Basque people be one of these colonies? Or could it have been the original colony on earth? The origin of the Basques is unknown. Their language is unlike any other European language. Some believe that Basque was the original language of the book of Genesis. Some believe it was the original language of the world and possibly of the creator.
Genesis 6:2 "The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and took them wives, all of which they chose." Who were the children of these marriages? Genesis 6:4 "God came into the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, and the same became mighty of old." From the King James Bible dictionary we find: "menchildren - men of Israel, male children of God, not children of man - Ex. 34:23." Ex. 34:7 states "The iniquity of the father will be unto the children unto the fourth generation." It is plain that something is inherited, could it be the blood?
Blood is mentioned more often than any other word in the Bible, except God. These two words you will find on almost every page, blood and God! (The blood of the Gods?) This message has been written for thousands of years. There is a connection between the blood and the Gods.
The American Indians had the tradition of making good friends, "blood brothers", if they thought they were worthy. Could this tradition have been for a reason? Could they have actually been checking to see if they were blood brothers (the same type blood)? The clumping (aggulation) that occurs when Rh positive and Rh negative blood are mixed is visible to the naked eye. Could they have been told, by their ancestors, that their blood was different from that of the rest of mankind except for their brothers and sisters, from other tribes, scattered throughout the earth. Indian tradition declares that their ancestors were of cosmic origin. The Indian totem pole is actually a family genealogy.
Why all this preoccupation with genealogy among different people scattered throughout the earth? No other animal on earth has this preoccupation with ancestry. Where did this tradition come from? People scattered throughout the earth, who have had no-known contact with each other all simultaneously got the urge to chart their family tree. Why? How important could this have been to primitive cave men? Struggling to survive, to chart their genealogy? They had no understanding of modern genetics and inheritance. So why should they preserve their genealogy? Were they told, by the ancient astronauts, to preserve their heritage, until a future date when they would return and it would be understood? Until a time, like now, when their descendent would be able to understand the message they were leaving.
Although they probably didn't realize the importance of preserving their genealogy, they were told that future generations would understand. Are we that future generation? Was there a message left for us to understand? Do we have the courage to look for the answer?
Do we really want to know or would we rather keep our heads buried in the sand? What we don't know will still affect us. You will not see unless you look. Only through knowledge will we find truth.

I have searched, in vain, for scientific proof that the Rh negative blood was a natural earthly occurrence. Instead I have found proof that the Rh negative had not evolved on earth in the natural course of events.
For many years people have been searching for the wrong thing. Could the true "missing link" actually be man himself? The unknown link between earth and the stars - hybrid man. Man may be the missing link between primate and extraterrestrial. It seems inconceivable to me that those working on the evolution theory have overlooked this possibility. How can they state, that these people are lacking a factor contained in all other earthly primates, including the naked ape, and not ask why? What other characteristics are common among these people that are uncommon to other people? Is there a real difference other than just a different blood?
A very good comparative study between man and the primates can be found in Max Flindt's book "Mankind, Child of the Stars," Fawcett publisher, Books 1 and 2. He has documented many of the characteristics we may have received from our cosmic ancestors. It does show quite conclusively that mankind is a hybrid between our cosmic ancestor and our earth ancestor. I have merely carried this idea to its logical conclusion. If mankind is a hybrid descendant of the ancient' astronauts, surely there would be some, appearing periodically, who would be genetically very similar to them. Would this not include their psychic powers? Could the great sleeping prophet, Edgar Cayce, have been one of these? Could Jesus Christ also have been one of these? A true descendant of the ancient astronauts. If he was a true genetic duplicate of them he would also have their powers and possibly their knowledge. I cannot say whether he was born with this knowledge or whether he established psychic communication with our cosmic family, but it is plain that he had powers far beyond those of mortal man. Could he have been an example of what the ancient astronauts were like? Jesus stated that the Father and him were one. Could he have actually meant that literally? He may have been an exact duplicate of his (our) ancient Father. He may have even been a clone of the cosmonauts. Everyone knows the story of his virgin birth and the heavenly intervention. Could this have been implanting a clone into Mary's sterilized egg? Could the whole egg have actually been an implant?
The Rh negative blood, which appears not to have originated on earth, may prove to be a major factor in proving mankind is a hybrid. It is not the whole answer but it is a key for unlocking the genetic puzzle of our heritage. Tissue factors will also prove to be quite revealing. Scientists are now able to determine the tissue factors of 5000 year old mummies. Could some of these mummies have been the ancient astronauts? Why were these mummies preserved well enough for us to analyze their blood and tissue factors? Could there be a message in the genetic factors of the mummies themselves?
There is an interesting fact found in the book "X-Raying the Pharaohs" by James Harris and Kent Weeks, 1973 (Scribners). Upon x-raying the tomb of Makare, high priestess of Ammon, it was found that the infant buried with her labeled Prince Moutenihet was actually a female hamadryas baboon. An examination of Makare showed she had given birth shortly before dying. Could she have given birth to the baboon found with her? Why else would it have been buried with her? A genetic throwback?
My research has shown that the majority of those with psychic powers also have Rh negative blood. Most psyphic and faith healers also have this blood. Strangely enough, many of those doing research into the ancient astronaut theory and other phenomena also have Rh negative blood.
Erich von Daniken has Rh negative blood and a thirst for the truth. Brad Steiger also has Rh negative blood. His new book "Gods of Aquarius" considers this possibility. Robert Antone Wilson, author of "Illuminus", also has this blood. There are many others too numerous to list here.
Why is there such a large percentage of negative in these unusual fields? Could we have a vague memory of what we are looking for? It has been said that a question is not asked until the answer is known.
There are about 5000 known blood factors and all of these must contribute to the complete picture. But the Rh negative blood is the place to start our search.
A comparative analysis is now being done and we need your help. If you are reading this, you must be one of the lost children of Israel. Anyone else would not have read this far.

Bloodline Posted: April 14, 2002
Just a question on my bloodline which is kinda interesting Im half Korean (Siberian base, with the possibility of a little Russian), a quarter Japanese, and a quarter Sicilian - do you know if the alien heritage is in conflict, or if it may explain my unpredictable patterns? Im O neg. blood - any relevancy? Angelo
Stewarts Reply: You cannot look at it as a conflict of alien heritage. Your mind-pattern attracted those genetics. If you are unpredictable, it is because you want to be. You also have to look at the imprinting on your as a child that enhanced this behavior. The negative blood type simply means that there is more Reptilian factor than mammalian and given your East Asian heritage, that is not surprising.
Book of Revelations Posted: April 14, 2002
Hi Stewart: I am new to your site and am ordering 3 of your books. While I dont know whos truth to believe I am open to hearing what everyone has to say on both sides. Please answer these questions. 1). Chemtails are being used to open certain peoples DNA to "expose them". 2).What blood types and corresponding RH factor are they targeting? 3).Whats the importance of this?
Stewarts Reply: I have talked about this extensively. Please read through the archives. They are targeting Rh negative factor with 30-40% Reptilian DNA out of the total.
The Book of revelations says who ever doesnt take the mark of the beast will be put to death, then says whoever does take it will be put to death at the second coming of "Christ". What should a person do in this damned if you do damned if you dont scenario saturate?
Stewarts Reply: That is correct. That is because it was written by Eliminate writers. And what is their favorite saying "resistance is futile". So that is why I emphasize that you must work on your own mindpattern and not be so concerned with the external world.
Isnt revelation just an account of a coming battle between two opposing alien races? Thank you.
Stewarts Reply: On the surface, yes. But it is mostly a battle about left and right-brain function.

RECURSION HARMONICS : The Enveloping Wave of Compassion? [ISNESS]
Blood Factor ( Rh+ or Rh-) and Morphogenetic Field Tuning.
* Your Rh status describes whether or not you have a protein on the surface of red blood cells. If you don't have the Rh factor, you're considered Rh-negative; if you have it, you're Rh-positive. About 85 percent of people are Rh-positive, though it varies by race. For African Americans, about 90-95 percent are Rh-positive, and for Asians, the figure is 98 to 99 percent. Hmmmm
Rh-Negatives are RARE.
But, strangely.... a person with type O negative blood is considered to be a "Universal Donor". It means his or her blood can be given to anyone, regardless of blood type, without causing a transfusion reaction.
The Rh-Negatives Factor is considered a "Mutation" of "Unknown Origin", which happened in Europe, about 25,000-35,000 years ago. Then this group spread heavily into the area of what is now Spain, England, Ireland, etc.
The Process of Alloimmunization
5/14



During the birthing process, blood cells from the unborn child can escape into the mother's bloodstream. These cells are recognized as foreign if they are a different blood type from the mother and a natural rejection process will ensue with the formation of antibodies. The process is known as red cell alloimmunization. Extracted from : http://www.med.unc.edu/obgyn/rh.htm
Modes of Inheritance
In more than 98% of cases, the red blood cell incompatibility involves the Rhesus or Rh D antigen[Rh-negative Factor] so the disease is known as Rhesus disease or Rh disease. Although the exact percentage varies with race, 15% of the United States population is Rh-negative and 85% is Rh-positive. If a Rh-negative woman conceives a child with a Rh-positive partner, the potential exists for the child to inherit its father's Rh-positive blood type.[ There are two types of Rh-positive men. In 55% of individuals, the man is heterozygous. In this situation, his genetics allow him to produce Rh-negative offspring 50% of the time and Rh-positive offspring the remaining 50% of the time. In the second type of a Rh-positive= individual, homozygous state.]
So... Rh-negative women with a Rh-positive partner are at RISK of spontaneous miscarriage and other fetus REJECTION events. Hmmmm And a Rh-negative woman with a Rh-negative partner has even a smaller chance of having a Baby born alive! Hmmmm... In animals this is seen as a problem, in HYBRID Animals.
Rh-negative women and men have several "Unusual Traits" that Rh-positives don't. Some call them "Reptilian Traits".
* An EXTRA-Vertebra (a "Tail Bone")....some are born with a tail(called a "Cauda"). * Lower than normal Body Temperature * Lower than normal Blood Pressure * Higher mental analytical abilities. * Higher Negative-ion shielding (from positive "charged" virus/bacteria)around the body. * High Sensitivity to EM and ELF Fields. * Hyper Vision and other senses. * Etc. (TS-MAJIC-NSC)
EUROPE'S MYSTERY PEOPLE :
http://www.knowledge.co.uk/frontiers/sf085/sf085a02.htm The researches of R. Frank, a scholar at the University of Iowa, suggest that the Basques were far-advanced in navigational skills and other aspects of technology long before the rise of the Roman Empire. The Basques, she believes, are the last remnants of the megalith builders, who left behind dolmens, standing stones, and other rock structures all across Europe and perhaps even in eastern North America.
Two facts set the Basque peoples apart from the other Europeans who have dominated the continent the past 3,000 years: (1) The Basque language is distinctly different; and (2) The Basques have the highest recorded level of Rh-negative blood (roughly twice that of most Europeans), as well as substantially lower levels of Type B blood and a higher incidence of Type O blood.
Some probable technological feats of the Basques or their ancestors are:
Stonehenge and similar megalithic structures....A unique system of measurement based on the number 7, instead of 10, 12, or 60 Regular visits to North America long before Columbus to fish and to trade for beaver skins. Recently unearthed British customs records show large Basque imports of beaver pelts from 1380-1433. The invention of a sophisticated navigational device called an "abacus." (No relation to the common abacus.)

CAUDA EQUINA - The bundle of spinal nerve roots arising from the end of the spinal cord and filling the lower part of the spinal canal(from approximately the thoracolumbar junction down). Embryology : Caudally the tail region projects over the cloacal membrane.
Cauda : the tail. The embryonic Human HAS a TAIL! * We ALL my be part REPTILIAN. How does the cauda equina develop?
In the third month, the spinal cord extends through the entire length of the embryo. With increasing age the vertebral column and dura mater lengthen more rapidly than the neural tube and the caudal end of spinal cord shifts to a higher level of the vertebral canal. As a result of this differential growth, the dorsal and ventral rami of the spinal nerves= run obliquely from their segment of origin to the corresponding level of the vertebral column.
In Sanskrit "Ketuu" =3D The south Lunar Node, also known as "Cauda= Draconis", in latin. The "Dragon's Tail", in English. The Dragon's Tail (South Node):
Aspects to the South Node display the results of "Innate Unconscious Tendencies"[In the DNA?] and "Karmic Patterns", as they emerge in life.
The Draconic Zodiac, is used by some astrologers searching for hidden spiritual truths. The Dragon, TALI, Theli. Tali or Theli refers to the 12 Zodiacal constellations along the great circle of the Ecliptic; where it ends there it begins again, and so the ancient occultists drew the Dragon with its tail in its mouth. Some have thought that Tali referred to the constellation Draco, which meanders across the Northern polar sky; others have referred it to the Milky Way; others to an imaginary line joining Caput to Cauda Draconis, the upper and lower nodes of the Moon.
Once upon a time..... there were three zodiacs: the Sidereal, the Tropical, and the Draconic. Shhhh... http://anastralwelcome.hypermart.net/dragontxt.htm
The Vertex, called a point of fateful encounters over which we have no conscious control, is the intersection of the great circles of the ecliptic...

The Reptilians are tracking those with Rh-Negative Factor Blood. Going back into time....the Rh-Neg Hybrids came from the DRACO Caverns in the Carpathian Mountains. They were mostly RED Haired, with Green Eyes and Black haired, with Brown Eyes. They tried to infiltrate themselves into the Blond/Brown Haired, with Blue Eyes, Civilization. They wanted to Mate with those who were not Rh-Negatives. Most Rh-Negs have a Lower Body temperature and Blood pressure than Rh-Positives. Many Rh-Negs are born with a CAUDA(tail) or an Extra Vertebra (Tail Bone). Rh-Negs are Hybrids. They are Part Reptilian/part human. If two Rh-Negs try to have a baby it will usually die or be born a "BLUE Baby", because it is Not processing oxygen properly. Thus "Blue-Bloods", if they survive. 5% of the Earth's population are currently Rh-Negatives. But, they are 15% of the population of the England and the USA.
Dr. Luigi Cavalli-Sforza from Stanford University wrote an article entitled "Genes, Peoples and Languages" (Scientific American, Nov.'91). He pointed out the high Rhnegative concentrations among the people of Morocco, the Basque country of Euskadi, Ireland, Scotland and the Norwegian islands.
The only people among these still to speak their original neolithic language were the Basques... From http://www.islandnet.com/~edonon/intro.html
Also on the Rh-factor map, you will notice that the Icelandic=20 population has a very low incidence of Rh-negative individuals, unlike the rest of Scandinavia. From http://www.sfs.nphil.uni-tuebingen.de/linguist/issues/3/3-87.html
The most distinctive members of the European branch of the human tree are the Basques of France and Spain. They show unusual patterns for several genes, including the highest rate of the Rh-negative blood type. Their language is of unknown origin and cannot be placed within any standard classification.
Consider Iceland, 1% of its population is Rh-negative. The population of Iceland is about two-third of Scandinavian and one-third of Irish descent. Scandinavia, Ireland, and the British Isles show from 16% to 25% and above Rh-negative. The other populations with a proportion of Rh-negative individuals similar to Iceland occupy the eastern half of Asia, Madagascar, Australia and New-Zealand. From http://www.sfs.nphil.uni-tuebingen.de/linguist/issues/3/3-151.html
Lucotte, G. & Hazout, S. (1995) "Y-chromosome DNA haplotypes in= basques", a report on population genetics sent to UNESCO . From http://www.csu.edu.au/learning/eubios/PG.htm
Q17. Are the Basques genetically different from other Europeans?
A17. Apparently, yes. It has long been known that the Basques have the highest proportion of rhesus-negative blood in Europe , and one of the highest percentages of type-O blood (55%). Recently, however, the geneticist Luiga Luca Cavalli-Sforza has completed a gene map of the peoples of Europe, and he finds the Basques to be strikingly different from their neighbors. The genetic boundary between Basques and non-Basques is very sharp on the Spanish side. On the French side, the boundary is more diffuse: it shades off gradually toward the Garonne in the north. These findings are entirely in agreement with what we know of the history of the language.
Q18. Does this mean the Basques are directly descended from the earliest known human inhabitants of Europe, the Cro-Magnon people who occupied western Europe around 35,000 years ago?
A18. Nobody knows. This is possible, but we have no real evidence either way. The only evidence we have is negative: the archeologists can find no evidence for any sudden change in population in the area for thousands of years before the arrival of the Celts and later the Romans in the first millennium BC.
The people of the Basque region have a greater than 50 percent concentration of the RH negative gene,. The frequency decreases in relation to the distance from the
8/14



Basque region into the rest of the world until there is very little evidence of this gene. This genetic mapping helps to show that a mutation from RH positive to RH negative occurred somewhere in the Basque area of Europe maybe as much as 40,000 years ago, as he discussed later. Basques are not regional inhabitants of an area, as some believe - they are a completely separate and distinct race whose origins are shrouded in mystery.
Although to all outward appearances they seem to be part of the so called "white" or "caucassian" race group, they have distinct genetic differences which does not allow their being classified as part of that "white" race. For example : Basques are believed to have been the originators of the RH negative blood factor - the original genetic pool from which this factor came. While RH negatives are a small minority in the "white" and other races, and practically non-existent in "orientals", the current Basques still are over 33 % RH negative. Another salient genetic feature is the the shape and sutures (bone joints) of cranial bones of Basques[The Reptilian skull ridge]. A third skeletal difference is the tendency to having a thicker breast bone.
According to Alex Collier... The Alpha Draconians, a reptilian race composed of master geneticists, tinker with life - which from their perspective exists as a natural resource. The Draconians look at lifeforms which= they have created or altered as a natural resource. Apparently, the Alpha Draconians created the primate race, which was first brought to Mars and then to Earth. The primate race was then tinkered with....

RH NEGATIVE BLOODLINE MIGRATIONS INTO WORLD
PURE RH NEGATIVE BLOODLINE (..SCANDINAVIANS)
HYBRID RH NEGATIVE SERPENT BLOODLINE (ARYANS)
You will notice that many DNA studies on line ONLY track the SERPENT BLOODLINES with the Rh Negative blood factor. These studies focus on the Basque area of Europe. These studies DO NOT track the PURE RH NEGATIVE BLOODLINE FACTOR group back to Hyperborea.
9/14



INTERESTING
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THEY DO NOT WANT US TO FIND OUT WHERE OUR PURE RH NEGATIVE BLOODLINE ANCESTORS CAME FROM.
These studies also track the Rh Negative bloodlines to a place in Europe where inbreeding occurred. These studies take us back to a place where the DARK HAIR DARK EYED RACES mingled their seed in with the BLONDE BLUE-EYED Scandinavians in places like the Iberian Peninsula, France and the British Isles.
Some scientists would have us believe that the human race started in Africa despite the fact that the oldest mummies found in recent archeological digs all over the world were of Scandinavian. Some scientists state that mankind evolve from monkeys somewhere in Africa, but cannot find the missing link between the Rhesus Monkey and human beings. This scientific opinion has always been a highly contested theory.
Most people have wondered where these Scandinavian races came from before the Ice Age. Legends and language tell us that these Scandinavians came from the Hyperborean Regions, which at one time in our not to distant past, was a warm climate that sat by the equator until the earth's shift moved the lands we now call the North and South Pole it into the arctic regions, CAUSING IT'S INHABITANTS TO MIGRATE DOWN TO GLOBAL AREAS IN THE WORLD KNOWN AS ATLANTIS, Lumeria etc.
ALL OF OUR ORIGINAL ANCESTORS ORIGINATED IN HYPERBOREA when the continents of our earth were joined together or in different locations from where they are today due to pole shifts which have happened in the past breaking up what used to be one land mass into 7 continents. History, archeology, science and legends tell us that the dark haired races bred into or with the Scandinavian races to form a variety of people groups such as the Basques, Anglo-Saxons, Scythians, and Aryans etc. The group of human beings who are positive with Rhesus Monkey DNA who have the Rh Positive blood factor, which are associated with Africa were referred to as the original Eves. The original Adams were actually associated with Indian populations through out the world and in North and South America.
Legends from India indicate that the cradle of humanity originated in the North Pole and South Pole regions. The Hindus believe that their families really descended from the lowest and most miserable of India's four castes known as the Sudras who were a servant class who were considered to be unclean and untouchable.
"The 4th group, sudra, denotes the service communities - manual and agricultural labourers, artisans, masons, etc. Although they lived on the fringes of society, the "outcastes" or "..untouchables" , the 5th group in the hierarchy, were still very much a part of mainstream society as the tasks of scavenging, cleaning up after funerals, killing or hunting animals for food, working in leather and other unclean materials, all fell to them. Mahatma Gandhi in the 1940s renamed them harijan, which when literally translated means "the people of God". http:../../. .www...anand. ..to/..india/ ..caste.html
As a matter of fact the British Royal Family also came from the lowest of the low class as did the Blue Bloods of Europe to rule Europe. These Blue Blood families are said to have stolen THE DIVINE RIGHT TO RULE the world from their Scandinavian predecessors before recorded history. The British Royals and Blue Bloods of Europe appear to be a bloodline of people with Scandinavian DNA and the DNA of a dark race who may have been the "Sea People." The Royals and "Blue Bloods" can be tracked back to the Lost Tribe of Dan and Cain in the Old Testament who are described as having had red hair and green-eyes. They are also referred to as the "Serpent Bloodline" or "Reptilian Bloodline." The Bloodline of Cain or Dan migrated into Europe from the Mediterranean Sea into Spain, France and the British Isles with the aid of the "Sea People."
Further some even say these royal "Blue Bloods," are a hybrid human reptilian bloodline with Neanderthal DNA. Science tells us that the red hair DNA did not originate with human beings but was Neanderthal DNA. If this is true, they are not the original bloodline on earth and worse than that they have demonic reptilian DNA flowing through their veins.
It would appear that the Hindus ancient history is wrapped round spiritual traditions that occurred, not in the ancient Indian subcontinent, but thousands of miles northward at the North Pole region, which ancient peoples referred to as Hyperborea, the Land of the Gods, etc!
10/14



The ancient histories of all the major nations and religions on earth mention a time when several races of mankind lived in a temperate paradise at what is now the North Pole. All ancient races referred to Hyperborea as a paradise, a "GARDEN OF EDEN," region. These legends tell us that the Scandinavian race was the original race in Hyperborea until the gods came down and started to rape and manipulate the DNA of the original Scandinavians creating hybrid races of genetically altered human beings. These evil gods began a human hybrid program in Hyperborea, which is eerily similar to what was being described in Genesis Chapter 6. This chapter in the Old Testament describes the "Fallen Angels or Watchers" who we refer to today as the Nordic Aryan Alien " Fallen Watchers." These evil fallen demonic entities came into our three-..dimensional world to rape woman and tampered with human DNA. All cultures also speak of reptilian gods who created a hybrid race of kings and queens that sat on the thrones of all ancient kingdoms that can be tracked back to ancient Sumer Babylon in Iraq.
When you read the "Scuttle Butt" on line regarding the PURE Rh Negative blood factor we find that some experts believe the PURE Rh Negative bloodline is of unknown origins. I wonder if that is simply because they do not track the origins back to Hyperborea, they only track their studies back as far as northern Europe to the area the Serpent bloodline of Can and Dan migrated into and bred with. These authors then make a MAJOR LEAP and assume that those who actually have the PURE Rh Negative blood factor came from other planets and were not a people group who originated on earth but that they are aliens or were created by aliens.
WHO CREATED THE HUMAN BODY AND WHAT DO OUR SOULS HAVE TO DO WITH IT.
According to Jesus (Yashua) he and his creative forces, which were known as the Aeons or the "Watchers" created the earth and all life on earth originally. This original race of human beings was created to look like the Watchers aka good angels or guardian angels. Then the souls or spirit beings from heaven were fused into these bodies and Real Man (Soul) became a physical being (operated from inside the body) created by the Watchers. Similar to what happens when we hop into our cars and use them to get around in as we travel. We do not know why physical man was created no one does.
At some point part of the group known as the "Watchers" fell from grace and became the "Fallen Watchers" or what we call the Nordic Aryan Alien "Fallen Watchers" today. Once the "Fallen Watchers" entered the picture things changed.
Another group of evil entities entered our three dimensional world that were created by Yaldabaoth the Demiurge, they were reptilian entities. One of these entities was known as Yahweh Ildabaoth the Demiurge, who was one of the 6 sons of god Yaldabaoth the Demiurge, is the evil entity the Judah Jews worshipped. The Israelites worshipped the Nordic Aryan Alien "Fallen Watchers" or the Elohim.
Once the physical bodies had been created these evil artisans known as the Nordic Aryan Alien "Fallen Watchers" and the "Reptilians were able to rape and clone human DNA.
Those falling for the "Alien Agenda's" believe that the demonic entities we wrongly call Aliens today, created human beings. However if these people would simply DO THEIR HOMEWORK and dig deeper they would find that the entities who came into our three-..dimensional world to rape and clone human beings were NOT CAPABLE OF CREATING HUMAN BEINGS AND ARE STILL NOT ABLE TO. Even the Old Testament story of these "Fallen Watchers" states this.
These entities did have the ability to rape women and clone hybrids using human, reptilian, animal and bird DNA, which is how the "Serpent Bloodlines" were created. This illicit sexual activity with the gods is the actual meaning behind "ORIGINAL SIN."
WHAT DOES THE VIKING Y-DNA PROJECT INDICATE REGARDING THE ORIGINAL SCANDINAVIAN RACE?
The Viking Y-DNA Project was initiated in Stockholm in December 2004 as an offshoot of the Scandinavian Y-DNA Project. The project noticed that many Americans of Norman, English, Welsh, Scottish and Irish ancestry are quite obviously of Scandinavian descent, although they do not have any family records or other official documents to prove it. With the help of genetic testing many of them might soon be able to link up with their Scandinavian siblings and the kin of their forefathers.
SCANDINAVIANS INHABITED NORTHERN EUROPE BEFORE THE DARK HAIRED RACES INFILTRATED THE LAND.

As time went on the dark haired races, such as the Sea People, bred into or with the Scandinavian races to form a variety of people groups such as the Basques, Anglo-Saxons, Scythians, and Aryans etc.
"In the English towns, the most striking thing was the sheer scale of Saxon genetic input.â "Our conclusion from the figures," says Mark Thomas of the Viking Y-DNA Project, "is that there was between 50% and 100% replacement of indigenous men by migrating Anglo-Saxons. " "If true, this was an achievement beyond the blood-lust of even the maddest modern tyrant.â How could it have been achieved?
"When we look at the Y-chromosomes in Wales and Ireland, we find a very close match with the Basques."â Other genetic evidence, he says, strongly suggests that the Basques are the descendants of the Paleolithic inhabitants of Western Europe prior to the arrival of farmers between 9,000 and 6,000 years ago".â

NOTICE THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THESE TWO MAPS
When you look at the map above you will see that before the "Earth Moved" and before the Ice Age, part of Europe was also connected to Africa by a LAND BRIDGE. The ancient histories of all the major nations and religions on earth mention a time when several races of mankind lived in a temperate paradise at what is now the North Pole. All ancient races referred to Hyperborea as a paradise, a "GARDEN OF EDEN," region. These legends tell us that the Scandinavian race was the original race in Hyperborea until the gods came down and started to rape and manipulate the DNA of the original Scandinavians.
The second group of Scandinavian people who appear to have had the PURE Rh Negative blood factor, migrate out of Hyperborea before the last Ice Age into the Scandinavia countries and northern Europe. This group left after the first group of hybrid Hyperboreans were TOSSED OUT. We will be focusing on the second hybrid group in this article.
The first group was forced out of Hyperborea for mingling with these evil entities we wrongly call aliens today. This first hybrid group migrated into areas ancient peoples called Atlantis, Lumeria, etc. The races all over the world we call Indians today were called Adams, the races of black people were known as the Eves. Parts of Africa are associated with Atlantis.
These Adams and Eves include the Siberians, Africans, Polynesians, and Indians etc. The Adams migrated into North America and become the Indians of North America. When you DO YOUR HOMEWORK what you will find is that some of not all American Indians have bloodline links to the Mediterranean Region and Africa, this is not a coincidence.
The dark haired peoples moved into the world and occupied an area known as Atlantis and Lumeria, which do NOT appear to be separate continents which are all under water today. When you see the "Earth Is Growing" maps it is clear that these landmasses never existed as separate continents from the 7 we have today. This tells us that the Atlantians and Lumerians occupied territories that exist today such as Antarctica, Alaska, Iceland, Greenland, North America, Africa, the Canary Islands, Asia and Polynesia etc. As a matter of fact, one of the early maps of Hyperborea looks almost identical to the Antarctic region. Knowing that our earth was once one big landmass, we are now able to see how it possible for these tribes to migrate onto all continents.
During a period in history known as the Dark Ages, which happened around 1200 - 800 B.C. The "Tribe of Dan" was shipped into Western Europe with the aid of the Phoenicians from the Mediterranean Sea at about the same time in history. They came into Spain, France (Languedoc Area of France).
We also know that the 10 Lost Tribes of Israel known as the Hebrews migrated into Europe and became a blended group who would later become known as the Scythian aka Aryan Races. They migrated into Europe from the Caucasus and Carpathian mountain ranges while the Tribe of Dan into Spain, France and the British Isles from the Mediterranean Sea.
We do know that the Phoenicians helped transport the Tribe of Dan into Spain, France, and the

British Isles by way of the "Sea Route," from the Middle East. We can determine from history that the Phoenicians appear to be the Siberians of Russia, the Yakuts, Sakha and the Buryats. THEY ARE THE SAME RACE WITH THE SAME DNA. They have the same spiritual and historical traditions: the same names of landforms, rivers, etc., How is possible that no one noticed this and why has this knowledge been LOCKED IN A CLOSET.
Origins of the Sakha (Yakut)
The orgins of the Sakha or Yakut people are something of a mystery. It is apparent from their language and customs that they had not been in the country for more than two or three centuries before the Russians arrived there, yet they had conquered the whole region. It was also clear that they had been an advanced nation, but they had lost their writing system and any written works completely. So only oral histories survived.
Influences in the culture and arts suggested links with traditions as far as the Celtic traditions of Western Europe. They had a similar clan system, and other cultural similarities. There are also cultural similarities with Buryat Mongols and with Central Asian, and other Turkic nations. The differences between Yakut and other Turkish languages suggest that it separated from the other Turkish languages as much as two thousand years ago. The Yakut language has changed little in the last five centuries.

As time passed and the Scandinavian and Siberian races mated, they became a blended people that came to look similar to our modern day Russian woman in the picture above. We have been taught by a select group of scientists that Black People came from Africa. This had been highly debated subject among the scientific communities.
SECRET RELIGIONS OF THE EVIL GODS
The Hindu legends tell us that prior to 30.000 years ago, they believed that they were spirits occupying the physical body. For them, their bodies had no life at all. They were just shells which these spirits occupied and used, just as we drive and manage our automobiles. This is what all world religions teach.
They appear to have had religions and were either atheists, monotheists or polytheists and worshipped evil demonic and reptilian gods known as the Vedas, Shiva, Kubera, the Nagas, Indra, Vishnu, and Brahma. These evil gods allowed humans to speculate about religion, just so long as they knew they were spirits occupying insignificant unthinking physical bodies that were used as a means to operate in earth's three-..dimensional world. However, when they forgot that truth, becoming more and more convinced that they were trapped in live bodies in various degrees, they fell deeper and deeper into degradation as well as religious error. These same beliefs were shared by the Christian Gnostic's.
If the Hindu, Jewish, and Christian myths are true, there is no doubt that the North Pole was the Garden of Eden. It is well known that at one time, the climate at the North Pole was pleasantly mild and that abundant flora and fauna existed there. The North and South Poles were sitting close to the Equator.
Dr. Valery Dyemen, a Russian researcher of the Arctic, is convinced that Hyperborea existed. He said:
I believe we should be looking for the traces of that civilization in Eurasia and American arctic regions, in the islands and archipelagos of the Arctic Oceans, at the bottom of some seas, lakes and
13/14



rivers. It's worthy of notice that Russia has the largest number of locations and artifacts that could bear relevance to Hyperborea. Some ... have already drawn attention of specialists; others are yet to be discovered. Active exploration is currently under way in the Kola Peninsula, in the Island of Vaigach, in Karelia, Ural Mountains, West Siberia, Khakasia, Yakutia, and a few other regions. There are good prospects for conducting research in Franz Josef Land, Taimyr, and Yamal.'(UFO Digest, 1/12/2007.)
'One of the charts by Gerhardus Mercator, the 16th century Flemish cartographer and geographer, shows a huge continent lying in the vicinity of the North Pole. The land is an archipelago composed of several islands divided by deep rivers. A mountain sits in the center of the land (according to legends, the ancestors of Indo-Europeans lived near Mount Meru). The question is: How did that land appear on the chart? There was no information whatsoever regarding the Arctic regions during the Middle Ages. We have some reasons to believe that Mercator had used an ancient chart, the one that is mentioned in his letter dated 1580. That chart showed a continent located in the center of the Arctic Ocean, which was pictured ice-free on the chart. Mercator's chart seems to be based on the ancient chart.'
Below is a link to an article regarding the DNA sampling showing some rather interesting findings regarding this inbreeding and how some of these different people group came to occupy Western Europe and the British Isles.
When these dark haired races bred with the Scandinavian races in prehistoric France for an example, they gave birth to a hybrid people group, which became a people group know as the Basques. After the freeze ended this hybrid race traveled up into the British Isles and settled there. The Basques very likely had a large portion of people with red hair green eyes as a result of inbreeding. We can see from the inbreeding that the "Tribe of Dan" certainly occupies the British Isle.
Here is a blog page where you can find some more of my articles. My friend Myron is running the blog for me so that I am able to keep my anonymity. The blog does not show the actual articles I wrote with the pictures because the format Myron copies my articles into is not that sophisticated, it is a very simple blog format.
