Dating शारदा लिलि & शारदा शक्ति िीठ, to ca. 500 BCE,
earliest University town together with Takṣaśilā, ca. 6th cent. BCE
-- This is based on (a) invention of Zero śūnya-bindu in Bakshali mss and
-- (b) "Pingala (c. 3rd/2nd century BCE), a Sanskrit prosody scholar, used binary numbers in the form of short and long syllables (the latter equal in length to two short syllables), a notation similar to Morse code. Pingala used the Sanskrit word śūnya explicitly to refer to zero."--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0
शारदा लिलि is an early syllabic Śāradā Script dated to ca. 500 BCE.
Aṣṭhādaśa Śakti Pīṭha Stotram lists 18 Maha Śaktī Pīṭhas including शारदा शक्ति िीठ
वारणास्याम् लवशािाक्षी काश्मीरे तु सरस्वती।
अष्ठादशैविीठालि योलििामि दुिलभालिच॥

शारदा शक्ति िीठ As an ancient University शारदा िीठ pre-dates Pushpagiri (3rdcent.), Nalanda
(5thcent.), लवक्रमलशिा (8thcent.) and is co-terminus with तक्षलशिा (6thcent.BCE).
शारदा िीठ is believed to be the earliest shrine dedicated to Shaktism, or Hindu goddess worship in Kashmir, with later shrines including the Kheer Bhawani and Vaishno
Devi temples.(Kashmir and its people : studies in the evolution of Kashmiri society. Kaw, M. K., 1941-, Kashmir Education, Culture, and Science Society. New Delhi: A.P.H. Pub. Corp. 2004. ) The Hindu tradition is that शारदा िीठ is one of the 51 Śakti िीठ Śakti Pīṭha, seat of Shakti of the world. "Various legends explain how the Shakti Peetha came into existence. The most popular is based on the story of the death of the goddess Sati. Out of grief and sorrow, Shiva carried Sati's body, reminiscing about their moments as a couple, and roamed around the universe with it. Vishnu had cut her body into 51 body parts, using his Sudarshana

A symbol for zero, a large dot likely to be the precursor of the still-current hollow symbol, is used throughout the Bakhshali manuscript, a practical manual on arithmetic for merchants.(Weiss, Ittay (20 September 2017). "Nothing matters: How India's invention of zero helped create modern mathematics")
"The Lokavibhāga, a Jain text on cosmology surviving in a medieval Sanskrit translation of the Prakrit original, which is internally dated to CE 458 (Saka era 380), uses a decimal placevalue system, including a zero. In this text, śūnya ("void, empty") is also used to refer to zero." (Ifrah, Georges (2000). The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer. Wiley, p. 416.)

The number 605 in Khmer numerals, from the Sambor inscription (Saka era 605 corresponds to AD 683). The earliest known material use of zero as a decimal figure.
A stone tablet found in the ruins of a temple near Sambor on the Mekong, Kratié Province, Cambodia, includes the inscription of "605" in Khmer numerals (a set of numeral glyphs for the Hindu–Arabic numeral system). The number is the year of the inscription in the Saka era, corresponding to a date of CE 683.(Cœdès, George, "A propos de l'origine des chiffres arabes," Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, Vol. 6, No. 2, 1931, pp. 323–328. Diller, Anthony, "New Zeros and Old Khmer," The Mon-Khmer Studies Journal, Vol. 25, 1996, pp. 125–132.)
The first known use of special glyphs for the decimal digits that includes the indubitable appearance of a symbol for the digit zero, a small circle, appears on a stone inscription found at the Chaturbhuj Temple, Gwalior, in India, dated 876. (Ifrah, Georges (2000), opcit., p. 400)
"By the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, the Babylonian mathematics had a sophisticated sexagesimal positional numeral system. The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a space between sexagesimal numerals. In a tablet unearthed at Kish (dating to as early as 700 BC), the scribe Bêl-bân-aplu used three hooks as a placeholder in the same Babylonian system.By 300 BC, a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was coopted to serve as this placeholder.The Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone, nor was it used at the end of a number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60), 3 and 180 (3×60), 4 and 240 (4×60) looked the same, because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder. Only context could differentiate them."(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0 loc.cit. Kaplan, Robert. (2000). The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero. Oxford: Oxford University Press.)
शारदा िीठ should pre-date the Bashkali manuscript which uses śāradā script of 3rd century
BCE. This indicates the possibility that शारदा िीठ was a place of learning prior to 3rd century
BCE. This may even relate to the date आलद शङ्कराचायलः (509–477 BCE) who visited the
sacred place. Kashmiri king named Gopaditya built temples of Jyeteshwara and आलद
शङ्कराचायलः , thus indicating the possibility that आलद शङ्कराचायलः visited Kashmir.

Kim Plofker notes: In the Chandah-sutra of Pingala, dating perhaps the third or second century BC, [ ...] Pingala's use of a zero symbol [śūnya] as a marker seems to be the first known explicit reference to zero. ... In the Chandah-sutra of Pingala, dating perhaps the third or second century BCE, there are five questions concerning the possible meters for any value "n". [ ...] The answer is (2)7 = 128, as expected, but instead of seven doublings, the process (explained by the sutra) required only three doublings and two squarings – a handy time saver where "n" is large. Pingala's use of a zero symbol as a marker seems to be the first known explicit reference to zero. (Plofker, Kim (2009). Mathematics in India. Princeton University Press. pp. 54–56)
Kim Plofker, Agathe Keller, Takao Hayashi, Clemency Montelle and Dominik Wujastyk observe: "We express regret that the Bodleian Library kept their carbon-dating findings embargoed for many months, and then chose a newspaper press-release and YouTube as media for a first communication of these technical and historical matters. The Library thus bypassed standard academic channels that would have permitted serious collegial discussion and peer review prior to public announcements. ... we urge the investigators to consider the importance of reconciling their findings with historical knowledge and inferences obtained by other means. It should not be hastily assumed that the apparent implications of results from physical tests must be valid even if the conclusions they suggest appear historically absurd." (Plofker, Kim, Agathe Keller, Takao Hayashi, Clemency Montelle, and Dominik Wujastyk. 2017. “The Bakhshālī Manuscript: A Response to the Bodleian Library’s Radiocarbon Dating.” History of Science in South Asia, 5.1: 134-150.
\https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/hssa/index.php/hssa/article/view/22) Jan Houben noted: "If the finding that samples of the same manuscript would be centuries apart is not based on mistakes in the procedure of sampling etc., or if the manuscript was at the moment it was written upon not partly consisting of older, recycled pages, there are still some factors that have evidently been overlooked by the Bodleian research team: the well-known divergence in exposure to cosmic radiation at different altitudes and the possible variation in background radiation due to the presence of certain minerals in exposed, mountainous rock have nowhere been taken into account. Among the variables of carbon dates, variation in script and linguistic variation, the first is the most objective but still much in need of calibration for relatively recent, historical dates."(Jan E.M. Houben “Linguistic Paradox and Diglossia: on the emergence of Sanskrit and Sanskritic language in Ancient India..."In view of the strong normativity of linguistic usage within the dimension “sanskrit - approximative sanskrit” it is difficult to derive a linear chronological difference from the observed linguistic variation. Also writing is a normative activity and moreover dependent on some amount of individual variation from scribe to scribe. However, writing has been much less subject either to the intensive study of early scripts by later generation scribes or to the conscious reintroduction of archaisms in later forms of writing (something we see in language, most famously the studied archaizing “Vedic” language use in parts of the Mahābhārata and in the Bhāgavatapurāṇa). We therefore have to take quite seriously the judgement of palaeographists such as Richard Salomon who observed that, what he teleologically called “Proto-Śāradā,” “first emerged around the middle of the seventh century” (Salomon 1998: 40). This excludes the earlier dates attributed to manuscript folios on which a fully developed form of Śāradā appears. The “hardest” evidence to judge the date of a manuscript such as the

Bakhshali and its sections would therefore be the palaeographic evidence. Other evidence, including the laboratory results of radiocarbon dating, is to be interpreted in the light of the results reached by careful palaeographic study."

These indicators posit the importance of शारदा िीठ from a date ca. 500 BCE.
Bashkali (in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan) birchbark manuscript is dated to 3-4th century CE which contains the earliest known zero symbol (śūnya-bindu 'dot of the empty space')-and uses Samskrtam written in Śāradā script. A colophon to one of the sections states that it was written by a brahmin identified as "the son of Chajaka", a "king of calculators," for the use of Vasiṣṭha's son Hasika; Near the colophon appears a broken word rtikāvati, which has been interpreted as the place Mārtikāvata mentioned by Varāhamihira as being in northwestern India (along with Takṣaśilā, Gandhāra etc.), the supposed place where the manuscript might have been written (Takao Hayashi (2008), "Bakhshālī Manuscript", in Helaine Selin (ed.), Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures, 1, Springer, pp. B1–B3).

A photograph of Sharada Peeth in 1893 by the British archaeologist Sir Aurel Stein. A Kashmiri Pandit stands at the entrance. "The dialect of Sharda oftenly called Sharda lipi (a form of Hindi) was the fundamental dialect of Brahmin scholars for a long time, till Hindi (Devnagiri) took over, finally. Kashmiri Pandits are not naïve to this seat of learning. In the post partition era we see Swami Nand Lal Ji as on the Saints of Kashmir who carried some of the idols during the War of partition and salvaged some of the whole lost. In fact, at the time of partition Swami Nand Lal Ji migrated on horses carrying idols from Sharda to Tikker and a few of these stone idols are lying at Devibal in Baramulla besides Tikker in Kupwara. The pilgrimage those days would be organised by Mela Ram a renowned forest lesse in Kupwara for Swami Lal Ji of Kashi- Mathura fame. Recently a Pakistan based scholar Ms Rukhsana Khan has undertaken the archaeological part of it and tried to go deep into the historical facts. It takes us back to Maharaja Ranbir Singh’s era and the fact that Jammu Haveli’s still exist there besides other temples and natural carvings like Ganesh Ghati."

The Gardez Ganesha, a 6th-century marble Ganesha found in Gardez, Afghanistan, now at Dargah Pir Rattan Nath, Kabul. The Sharada inscription says that this "great and beautiful image of Mahāvināyaka" was consecrated by the Shahi King Khingala of Khatriya Country Modern Part of Punjab Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In Kalhana's 12th century epic, Rajatarangini, Sharada Peeth is identified as a site of popular veneration:
35. There, the goddess Saraswati herself is seen in the form of a swan in a lake [situated] on the summit of the Bheda hill, which is sanctified by the Ganga source. 37. There, when visiting the goddess Sharada, one reaches at once the river Madhumati, and [the river of] Saraswati worshipped by poets.(

"resemble[s] a swan, carrying as her diadem the [glittering gold washed from the sand] of the Madhumati stream, which is bent on rivalling Ganga. Spreading lustre by her fame as her diadem, and rivalling the Ganges river. Spreading lustre by her fame, brilliant like crystal, she makes even Mount Himalaya, the preceptor of Gauri, raise higher his head (referring to his peaks) [in pride] of her residence there.(11th cent.

During Lalitaditya's reign (713 – 755), a group of assassins from the Gauda Kingdom entered Kashmir under the guise of a pilgrimage to Sharada Peeth.(Kalhana (1900). Kalhaṇa's Rājataraṅginī: A Chronicle of the Kings of Kaśmīr. Translated by Stein, Marc Aurel. Westminster: Archibald Constable and Company, Ltd. pp. 151–152.). "Kalhana also describes a rebellion during his own lifetime. Three princes, Lothana, Vigraharaja and Bhoja, rebelled against King Jayasimha of Kashmir. These princes, pursued by the Royal Army, sought refuge in the upper Kishenganga Valley, in the Sirahsila Castle. Kalhana believed that the Royal Army took refuge in Sharada Peeth, because it had the open space required for a temporary military village, and because the area surrounding the Sirahsila Castle was not large enough to host a camp for a siege without the siege force being vulnerable to archers." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharada_Peeth loc.cit.Qazi, Junaid Ahmad; Samad, Abdul (January 2015).

In the 14th century text Madhaviya Shankara Vijayam, there is a test, unique to Sharada Peeth, known as the Sarvajna Peetham, or Throne of Omniscience. These were four thrones, each representing an entrances of the temple corresponding to one of the points of the compass, which only a learned man from that direction could symbolically open.आलद
