PREFACE
This volume treats aspects of Iran's history in the period between 1722 and 1979,
which began with the collapse of the Safavid dominion after two centuries, and
ended in the overthrow of Pahlavi rule after fifty-three years. Iran's vulnerable
geo-political situation was signalled by the events that followed, once invasion
from what is now Afghanistan had engulfed the Safavid capital, Isfahan, in 1722.
Further invasions came from the Ottoman Empire in the west and from Russia
in the north. To some it seemed inevitable that the revolution in 1979 would
similarly invite invasion, and in 1981 it did, from Iraq. The 18th- and 20th
century episodes with which this volume opens and ends typify the repeated
catastrophes characteristic of Iranian history, paramount and relatively stable
governments alternating with periods of, in the past, regional autonomies and,
as today, factionalism representative of divided authority and productive of
great uncertainty.
Periods of regional autonomies have often been those of distinguished
literary and artistic activity. Poets and annalists strove to keep alive cultural
traditions salvaged from empires unfavourable to artistic freedom. That this
should be so is less a paradox than it might seem. Stable government, over
regions each with their own cultural traditions, meant repression to promote
uniformity. When paramount government from a single centre was replaced by
competing regional rulers from several, as this generally followed disasters
across the whole land, it was in the regions, once some measure of peace was re
established, that traditional arts and crafts could be revived. Patronage of artists
became a feature of competitive courts. At the same time, the sufferings of a
nation never unaware of an overall cultural identity, especially in so far as this
was enshrined in a shared and prized language capable of remarkable beauty of
expression, occasioned literary artists' laments during interregna distracted by
internecine warfare and the threat of foreign invasion. Extremely adverse
material conditions encouraged a poetry which offered spiritual counsel com
bined with comprehension of the human predicament. A spiritual humanism,
born of terrible experiences, served to remind people of the spirit within them
and of their essential dignity, whatever indignities and cruelties they underwent.
The shock of disintegration on the fall of the Safavids was followed by Nadir
Shah's extravagant wars, when campaigns abroad were partly prompted by
impoverishment at home. That Nadir Shah failed lastingly to re-unite Iran, and

left it scarcely better than he had found it, augmented despair. How forlorn
hopes had become may be gauged by the way in which Karim Khan Zand's rule,
over little more than a quarter of the country, has been seen as an interlude of
unusual benignity. The subsequent Qajar conquest of the whole was, in com
parison with what had preceded it, a not unwelcome settlement, in spite of the
cruelties which accompanied its achievement.
This settlement, however, also produced despondency. Under the second
Qajar ruler, territory which the Safavids had counted as theirs was seized by the
Russians. Under the third and fourth, claims to Herat were unsuccessfully
pursued and finally relinquished. Administrative arbitrariness and corruption
continued prevalent: the hardships of the people were not greatly ameliorated.
British and Russian intervention steadily increased. While both powers insisted
that they sought to preserve it, on their own terms, the integrity of Iran was
imperilled. Only a change of government in Russia, Iran's rejection of Lord
Curzon's plans for what would, in effect, have made Iran a British protectorate,
and the rise of a strong leader in Riza Shah gave Iran more tangible evidence of
its independent identity than retention of its own language and distinctive Lion
and Sun emblem.
The Qajars, nevertheless, allowed Iranian traditions, good as well as bad, to
continue. They did not make the error of the last Pahlavl ruler and permit
tradition to be so jeopardised by alien influences that in the end the people rose
to defend it. By 1979, the people wanted to return to norms and values which
they understood, when those imported seemed not to profit but only to confuse
them. Under the Qajars, western dominance, while it furnished Iran with fair
and, in the eyes of some, less than fair frontiers, had compelled Iranians to seek
mastery of western ways the better to resist them. Yet from the Qajar period
sufficient of the old culture survived for western novelties to be contained and to
be a catalyst in an intellectual and literary revival, manifested in the Constitu
tional Movement of this century's first decade. Riza Shah's reign showed that
even renewal of autocracy could be palliated by scholars and writers who,
employing western techniques to good purpose, focussed attention on their
country's rich artistic heritage. After 1941, the freedom which followed Riza
Shah's departure, although darkened by foreign occupation until 1946, was
conspicuous for works of literature and scholarly research. The resilience of
Iran's creative and intellectual strength was again demonstrated.
This culturally promising interlude ended in 195 3. Despondency and a failure
of confidence among thinking men reappeared, in spite of developments which
superficially and by western standards might have augured Iran's progress as an

increasingly affluent modern nation state. These developments were fatally
marred. Expectations were aroused which could not be fulfilled. More danger
ous was the risk that cherished traditions would be overwhelmed by what was
considered progress, but conceived according to neither fully understood nor
applicable foreign criteria, by the weight of repression and by the ubiquity of
western agencies. Thus the turmoil in which the period treated in this volume
ended is explicable in more than purely political and economic terms.

CHAPTER I
NADIR SHAH ANDTHE AFSHARID LEGACY
ORIGINS AND FRONTIER EXPERIENCES
The year 1688has recently found acceptance asthat ofNadir's birth,1 butone of
the best Iranian authorities forhis time, theJahan-gusha-yi Nadiriof Mirza Mahdl
Khan Astarabadi, spells outA.H. 1110astheyear, and28Muharram asthe day,
which gives us 6 August A.D. 1698.2 A Bombay lithographed edition3 of Mirza
Mahdl Khan's Jahan-gusha has A.H. IIOO, but this date is not supported by
manuscripts and the Tehran edition ofthe early nineteen sixties prefers the1110
A.H. date. Other dates are given in other sources and are discussed by Dr
Lockhart inhis Nadir Shah,but it sohappens that another contemporary source,
the "Alam-ara-yi Nadir! of Muhammad Kazim, the"Vazir of Marv", gives A.H.
1109 asthe year ofconception and,although hedoes not give the precise dateof
birth, this date corroborates 1110 as the year of delivery.4 It took place in the
Darra Gaz,where a first-born and for some time only son was brought intothe
world for Imam Qull, Nadir's father, inthe fortress atDastgird, a refuge for
Nadir's people against the border raids from which the northern Khurasan
uplands frequently suffered.
Dastgird was in thewinter quarters, where Nadir's father might have
lingered on account of the expected birth. The summer-grazing was near
Kupkan or Kubkan, thirty-eight kilometres southwest of the Dastgird
Chapshalu winter-grounds in the low-lying, milder Darra Gaz, "Valley of
Manna". Further to the east, onthe margin ofthe Marv desert, lay Ablvard,the
metropolis of this region andin Nadir's youth theseat of the Safavid agent or
district governor. In those days this dignitary was an Afshar named Baba cAli
Kusa Ahmadlu. The whole neighbourhood was predominantly Afshar, and
Nadir's kin formed the Qiriqlu clan or sept ofthe Afshars.5
The Afshars had originally been a well-established tribal group of long
standing in Turkistan,6 whence they moved when the Mongols entered that

region inthe 13th century. They migrated westwards and settled in Azarbaljan.
During theearly part of the Safavid eraKhurasan was subject to large-scale
Uzbek raids, particularly serious when the Uzbeks were under the sway of the
Shaibanid A.bd-Allah ibn Iskandar, who died in 1598. He had made Bukhara his
capital andhispower extended as far as Khwarazm, while his son, Abd al
Mu3min, was his Viceroy atBalkh. Although A.bd al-Mu3min only survived his
father by six months, during their lives the two menwere the terror of
Khurasan, which was threatened from both Khwarazm and Balkh. It was not
until Shah Abbas I (1588-1629) succeeded inridding Khurasan ofthis menace
that he could turn his attention to his north-western frontier province of
Azarbaljan.
There he had the Ottoman Turks tocontend with and control of the area was
not gained until 1606. He then followed apractice also used by his predecessors,
Shah Ismacil (1501—24) and Tahmasp I (1524—76), a combination of stiffening
one frontier while carrying out a scorched-earth policy on another. The
Azarbaljan borders were deprived ofcultivators tomake the advance ofhostile
armies more difficult, andthe Khurasan borders strengthened with people
removed from Azarbaljan. Another factor which influenced the Safavids (1501
1732) may have been fear that such tribes asthe Afshars, whose language was
Turkish, would be tempted tocollude with the Ottomans; but such affiliations
do not always, inthe tribal context, justify such an expectation; Nadir was later
to be disappointed by his reception from those of his Afshar kin whohad
remained in Azarbaljan.
For among the tribes removed in the seventeenth century from the
Azarbaljan region, to be planted in Khurasan and Mazandaran, were the
Turkmen ofAfshars and Qajars, and they were not remote in speech or habits
from the major Turkmen threat on the frontiers which they were transplanted to
guard. They were, however, considered loyal to the Safavids and counted within
the fold ofthe Safavid Shicl sect, unlike the Sunni Tiirkmens across the border.
Besides these Afshars and Qajars, Kurds from the west were planted in
Khurasan, as was also aclan of the Bayat. Shah cAbbas is said to have transferred
four thousand five hundred families of Afshars from the Urmiya region to
Ablvard and the Darra Gaz. After he had conquered inthe vicinity of Erzerum,
he sent nearly thirty thousand families of Kurds to settle round Khabushan.
Their number gave them apreponderance of which Nadir Shah was well aware.
A group of Qajars from theTabriz district was settled in Marv. Qajars from
Ganja and the Qarabagh were sent to Astarabad. A section of the Bayat from
Erivan was placed in Nishapur. Thus a string of peoples was planted across

ORIGINS AND FRONTIER EXPERIENCES
Khurasan whose capacity forunity and disunity had considerable bearing on
Nadir's rise to power and the efforts required to retain it. He died on his wayto
Khabushan to suppress a Kurdish rising.
Iranian exiles in India, when they wrote about Nadir's antecedents, tendedto
exalt them. They were writing under Indian patrons in the land which had
witnessed Nadir's humiliation of the Mughul Emperor Muhammad Shah, and
they were compatriots of Iranians who had been ruled by aself-made Shah. Not
to add insult tothe Indians' injury nor toemphasize the debasement of fellow
Iranians' thraldom, awriter like Muhammad ShafT Tihrani inhis Nadir Nama
awards Nadir the dignity of being the son of an Afsharid Sardar, one of the high
officers of the "Sultan" of Ablvard.7 James Fraser, whose sources were for the
most part Indian, also gives Nadir a father ofrank inthe Afshar community.8
Other fashions make for other kinds of selection. Although he speaks of Nadir's
own habit of making contradictory claims, and of confusing differences in
accounts of Nadir's ancestry, Jonas Hanway plumps for themore humble
version, and Lockhart, who incidentally echoes one of Hanway's asides, also
considers Nadir's birth not of the quality for its having taken place in a "castle"
to be plausible.9 It isimprobable that the qalca atDastgird was anything ofthe
order ofa castle. It was probably simply atower, ora farmyard with walls and
bastions.
Hanway makes Nadir's father very poor indeed, but if we follow Muhammad
Kazim's account, it may be seen just how poor or, how comparatively well-off
Nadir's father was as a herdsman. Asfor Mirza Mahdi Khan, in the earlier
passages of his book he was not inaposition tooffend Nadir, his master, with
flattery totally devoid oftruth, nor toinsult him with a degrading lineage. He
tells the well known story about the strength of the sword lying in its temper, not
in the vein whence the metal came; but he also says that the first name given
Nadir was that of his grandfather.10 This point inan Iranian context is impor
tant. Nadir had a known grandfather: hewas a man of a recognized family.
His original name has generally been taken as Nadr Quit, "Slave of the
Unique". In his article onNadir Shah in the Encyclopaedia of Islam Minorsky
avoids the issue, but in his Esquisse d'uneHistoirede Nader-Chah,n he prefers the
spelling which occurs in several of the manuscripts of Mirza Mahdi Khan's
Tarlkh-i Jahan-gusha. Itdiffers from the uncommon word nadrby one point only,
to give na%r. Nazr Quli would mean "Slave of the Votive Promise" and is

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
intriguing because of Muhammad Kazim's somewhat lengthy account of how
Imam Qull had been mysteriously prepared for the coming of hisfirst-bornand
longed-for son. The name suggests a boon received after votive exercises in
quest of it.
Muhammad Kazim merely says the boy was called Nadir, "Prodigy", from
the start because as ababy he at once displayed the development of a three-year
old. He generally refers to Nadir in the early years as Nadir-i Dauran, "Wonder
of the Ages". Apart from Kazim, it isgenerally accepted that he was Nazror
Nadr Qull Beg until he was made Tahmasp Qull Khan by Shah Tahmasp in
reward for services: "the slave and Khan of Tahmasp". He retained these titles,
by which hewas generally known among Europeans, until hebecame king.
Then, as Minorsky put it,he"improved" on his old name by changing it to
Nadir.
Muhammad Kazim is far more explicit about Nadir's father than other
writers are. He was adecent, God-fearing man with two brothers, Begtash and
Babur. Each of the three possessed six to seven thousand head of sheep and ten
to fifteen cows. Muhammad Kazim had ataste for marvels and they often stood
him in good stead as substitutes for more circumstantial details in his narrative
when he either lacked the facts or preferred not to express them. His skill in the
devices ofan epic prose style was less developed than the gifted and learned
Mahdi Khan's. Moreover, heis frequently too colloquial, often using direct
speech, to be able to sustain conceits, flattery, or disguises, however thin, of the
truth. His taste for the miraculous must be borne with, especially when it may
point to another version of events, or indicate dates, with which he is sparing.
Fortunately, he is less so with financial details: he makes Nadir's meticulousness
over accounts quite explicit.
Determined appropriately toherald Nadir's birth, Kazim describes Imam
Quli's twice-witnessed dream, which hisbrother Begtash also saw. Kazim
makes Imam Qull, such a vague entity in other sources, strikingly real. The
shepherd puts on his posteen togo out and watch the sheep inthe Chapshalu
winter pastures. Out for three days and nights, he indulges in prayer and
meditation, exercises to which he was apparently prone. On the night of23
Ramazan, a Sabbath Eve, in1087 (9 November 1676) he has adream, repeated
the next night. He sees asun whose radiance covers the whole earth and which
rises from his own collar. It sets in the district of Khabushan. He thinks that if he
told them of this vision people would take him for mad, but when he found that
his brother had had the same dream about him, the two men were emboldened to

ORIGINS AND FRONTIER EXPERIENCES
seek aninterpretation from a "poor village mulla". The mulla gave them the
obvious interpretation, even to the world-conqueror's death near Khabushan.12
When the prodigy was eventually born, Imam Qull doted onhim. By his
tenth year he was a good horseman, practised in archery, javelin-throwing,
hunting and horse-racing. His brother Ibrahim was not born till some time after;
Nadir, from asmall segment of a tribe and from afamily which does not appear
to have been excessively fertile, was toa significant degree concerned with the
continual acquisition of men to serve under his banner.
Writers on Nadir Shah towhom the first part ofMuhammad Kazim's book
was unavailable have been at pains to state how little is known about Nadir's
early life, but have lent currency to several stories. In Lockhart, Nadir had a
biographer who rejected many of the legends but remained uncertain about the
tale that Nadir was for atime arobber. Muhammad Kazim, towhom the terms
'bandit' or'robber' would not mean quite what they did toLockhart, givesno
evidence of Nadir's banditry. What Nadir often had to do was to retrieve cattle,
captives and goods stolen in border raids: rather than being one himself, he
seems tohave spent many of his early years pursuing robbers. Indeed the more
plausible thesis, applicable to many stages of his career, might be that he was on
the side of merchants, bandits' most likely victims. The rise of a strong rulerin
Iran may often have had more todo with the support ofoperators ofcaravan
routes than such aruler's annalists trouble toreveal, either from adesire not to
link their champion with the mercantile classes, orbecause what most people
would already know needs no telling. Muhammad Kazim was probably ofthis
opinion: his evidence for Nadir asthe friend ofmerchants isscanty, but what
there is signifies much.
One of the legends Lockhart rejects isHanway's story ofNadir's captureat
the age ofseventeen oreighteen by Uzbeks. His mother died inthis captivity,
but he escaped. No Iranian source seems to corroborate this episode, but
Han way must have got itfrom somewhere and Kazim relates two incidents that,
coalesced or garbled, might have given rise to Hanway's version.
The first incident was that out hunting Nadir chased awild ass till he was lost
and his mount exhausted. An old woman, mysterious enough tosuit Kazim's
pen, succoured him and gave him special advice. On his return, the boy, thus
refreshed and peculiarly empowered, met aparty of Turkmen raiders marching
home across the border with five hundred of his father's sheep and two or three
12 Muhammad Kazim, vol. i, p. 22(fol. 5b).

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
of his cows as well as human captives. Nadir fought off the raiders and retrieved
the captives.
The second episode was later. Nadir was already inthe service ofBaba All,
the governor ofAbivard. He had been into the Chapshalu district to buryhis
father and uncle Babur. On his return towards Abivard, he and his party stopped
by a spring. While they were asleep agroup ofYamut Tiirkmens, the plague of
Astarabad further to the west, surprised them. This time Nadir and his compan
ions were captured, but one of them escaped to reach Baba All with the bad
news. Baba All Beg set out with a small force on a two-day pursuit which was
unsuccessful, but one night Nadir, whom Baba All would have had to ransom
from enslavement, prayed for release. His fetters fell away like cobwebs. He
liberated his friends and surprised his captors, whose loot hebrought back to
Abivard. Itis not difficult to see how allegations that Nadir also was sometimesa
robber might arise; but the tale about the fetters falling offlike cobwebs deserves
further comment.
It may hide asignificant fact that Nadir, until very near the end, and exceptat
certain major turning-points in his career, was nearly always atemporiser, by no
means contemptuous of diplomacy. His passion for collecting and hoarding
manpower made him more often than notconciliatory towards defeated en
emies, particularly when they paid up, and provided that he had no longstanding
grievance against them. He seldom failed to enlist large numbers of the
vanquished into his service, in order to create the army whose final unwieldiness
helped to break him and ruin Iran. The fact which the legend may conceal is that
the fetters did not fall off as the result of prayers tothe Almighty, but following
some nocturnal parley between Nadir and his gaolers, during which he may have
promised them a share in future enterprises. They were, after all, of his own
tongue; but this would not be a version of the story Kazim needed to expose. His
readers could draw their own conclusions.
Joining Baba All BegKusa Ahmadlii's service, at first as a tufangchi^
(musketeer), was certainly a major turning-point in Nadir's career. It meant
handling some of the more sophisticated weapons of the day and in the service of
a man who, aswill bementioned below, was apparently a properly appointed
royal governor, and himself an Afsharid. He had heard ofNadir's prowess and
summoned him; and itseems likely that the boy was inany event fairly close kin
to Baba AIL After a period astufangchi, hewas raised to the dignity ofIshlk
Bashl.Interms ofthe Safavid Court atIsfahan the Ishlk Aqasi Bashi was a very
high officer, similar to High Chamberlain. In Baba All's entourage, the terms
"muster-master" or "sergeant-at-arms" might fit. Baba CA1I Beg's function as

ORIGINS AND FRONTIER EXPERIENCES
governor of Ablvard was, as Mirza Mahdi Khan says, always to be "engagedin
battle against hostile Afsharids, Tiirkmens, Kurds and Uzbeks".13 Kazim seems
to reflect tribal lays and ballads when he describes Baba cAH's new henchman in
encounters with these raiders. These skirmishes culminated in a serious clash
which involved Baba All inperson against a Yamut Turkmen force given as
eight thousand strong and led by acertain Muhammad All known as the Fox,
who attempted tooverrun Abivard and Darra Gaz. The Fox was worsted and
fourteen hundred prisoners taken, an event of sufficient importance for news of
it tobe conveyed toShah Sultan Husain (1694—1722) atIsfahan. Kazim makes
Nadir, asbearer ofthe good tidings, have his first sight ofthe Safavid capital,
where hewas rewarded bythe Shah with a hundred tumans, nomean gift.14
Baba All is reported to have cemented the paternal aspect of his patronage of
Nadir by marrying the boy's widowed mother. Nadir thus gained two half
brothers, Fath All and Lutf All. Mirza Mahdi says that Nadir conceived the
notion of more intimately allying himself with Baba Allby marrying his
daughter. As Lockhart perceived, there is almost certainly no truth in the
version that makes Nadir hostile tohis first master; but his desire tomarry his
daughter aroused the opposition ofother Afsharid chiefs, jealous of the young
man's increasing influence. Fighting broke out and several of the envious chiefs
were slain before the nuptials were completed. This union's first fruit was Riza
Quli, born according to Mirza Mahdi Khan in 1131/1719, according to
Muhammad Kazim, in 1125/1713—14.
Mahdi Khan says that the first wife died after five years. Nadir married her
sister, by whom he had two sons, one later named Nasr-Allah, the other Imam
Quli. Kazim is correct, although he does not differentiate the mothers, when he
says that the first of these two sons was originally called Murtaza Quli and only
styled Nasr-Allah after the capture of Qandahar; but he dates Nasr-Allah's birth
1128/1715-16, which makes Nadir avery youthful father by western standards;
Nadir must have been adopted into Baba All's household at a very early age, but
fatherhood at fifteen or sixteen would not betoo young in such a situation,
especially if male progeny were a need.
In his Durra-ji Nadirl, "The Nadiric Pearl", Mirza Mahdi Khan of Astarabad
gives theyear 1136/1723-4 as the beginning of Nadir's world-conquering
exploits. Since, following promotion in Baba All's service, Nadir's assumption
of control over the natural fortress of Kalat might be taken as the next turning
point in his career, itwould be useful to be able to date it. Persian sources do not

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
help over this, but Hanway dates the seizure ofKalat in 1721, which may notbe
far wrong. His account of the episode, however, does notring true, butitis
again possible to discern how he might have arrived at it. As hasbeen said
already, there is no reason to suspect discord between Nadir and Baba CA1I, who,
as Lockhart pointed out, had sons, notably Kalb CA1I, faithful inNadir's service
long after their father's death. Kazim, whose service was mostly under Nadir's
brother Ibrahim and Ibrahim's son, sothat heis often a detached observer of
Nadir himself and not given to flattering him, gives no hint that Baba All ever
wavered inthe realization that inthe Qiriqlu boy hehad a strong arm of great
value.
A further consideration is that Mahdl Khan confessedly restricts himself to
only asummary of Nadir's early days and affrays with "Turk and Tajik, near and
far", by which Nadir thefrontiersman "tamed those people and introduced
tranquillity tothe borders".15 Kazim, onthe other hand, narrates the incidents
and names the people behind Mahdl Khan's summary treatment of clashes with
the fickle Kurds, Tiirkmens ofother clans, and also rival Afshars. The enemies
were bynomeans always from beyond the Safavid frontier with Central Asia.
Mahdl Khan says that local rivals, even powerful fortress-holding Afshars, had
recourse to Malik Mahmud of Slstan, the captor of Mashhad, to raise obstacles in
the way ofNadir's rise topower, while in Darra Gaz, in Ablvard itself, Kurds
were hostile to the same purpose, combining with their kinsmen from
Khabushan. Itis significant that Mahdl Khan places his outline of these events in
a general excursus which is thesequel to Nadir's acquisition of the "Kalat-i
Nadiri", asaucer-shaped plateau some twenty miles long from west-north-west
to east-south-east, and from five to seven miles wide, surrounded bya rim of
limestone clifls sheer on the outside and rising from seven hundred to eleven
hundred feet in height: theperfect natural fortress.
When Kazim says Nadir was out hunting in Kalat and discovered Timur's
buried treasure there andan inscription prophesying its discoverer's future
glory, heis merely introducing Timur in association with a strong point with
which, in any event, this name was historically associated; and in association
with astrong man who was pleased to connect his own achievements with those
of Timur, whom he believed was of the same race as himself. As for the treasure,
that lay not in chests of specie or jewels, but in the control of such a bastion,
dominating the Darra Gaz tothe northwest of it, Ablvard tothe southeast, and
the Atak plain below Khurasan's mountain frontier, and the route from

Mashhad into Turkestan. To possess it was certainly an advantage to be
treasured and itmight have been when Nadir had control of Kalat that enemies
and rivals decided to try conclusions with the ambitious Ishik Bashi before itwas
too late. It is at this juncture that Kazim relates that Baba All deputed all his
powers to Nadir who, thenarrative continues, occupied himself preparing
horses, ordnance and arms until the news of Mahmud Ghilzai's victories came
a piece of evidence which accords with Hanway's dating of the beginning of the
"Kalat Period" to circa 1720— 1.
The two main Persian-language accounts preface the history ofNadir Shah
with observations on the stricken state ofIran after the collapse ofthe Safavid
empire. Nadir is introduced as Iran's saviour. Both these sources provide
detailed comment on the pretenders to the Safavid throne who appeared
between 1722 and the 1750s. Besides such appearances affording additional
evidence for how distracted conditions were, they prove how the people were
inclined to cling to the memory of the Safavid monarchy and desire its
continuation or revival.16 Its aura remained although, before 1722 even, its
strength had been depleted by, among other things, ill-conceived and
conflicting counsels offered a weak ruler in a contentious Court.
This husk of sovereignty finally crumbled when Mahmud Ghilzai of
Qandahar entered the capital, Isfahan, on 25 October 1722 after a six-month
siege. Shah Sultan Husain, who had been onthe throne since 1694, abdicated
and Mahmud assumed the insignia of ruler. The ex-Shah was decapitated in 1726
on the orders of Mahmud's cousin, his successor, Ashraf (1725—29). Proof of the
importance provincial authorities attached to theupholding of the Safavid
monarchical institution isfurnished by the appeals sent toShah Sultan Husain
during the siege of Isfahan for him to ensure the escape of one of his sons, to bea
rallying point for resistance to other invaders andto ensure the dynasty's
survival. The Shah's third son, Tahmasp MIrza, was smuggled out of the city in
June 1722. This was the prince whose servant Nadir later became and Nadir's
rise to power might be attributed to the Ghilzai invasion and the awful challenge
it presented.
This episode opened when in 1709 a Ghilzai Afghan notable, Mir Vais,
overthrew the Safavid governor ofQandahar who was a Georgian convert to
Islam, originally Giorgi XI and known in his converted state as Gurgin or
Shahnavaz Khan. He was a valued ghulaminthe Safavid service because ofhis
military skills and sent to Qandahar in 1704, to secure Iran's bastion against

Mughul India and prevent local unrest among the Afghans. Isfahan was rent by
factions in the Court of a ruler the historians describe as both other-worldly and
inept. A centre which manifested signs ofdeclining power found increasing
difficulty in holding outlying provinces in subjection. To send Gurgin Khanto
Qandahar might have been apositive move but his personality nullified it. His
treatment of the local people precipitated disaster; sent to prevent rebellion
breaking out he punished the Afghans "as severely as ifthey had carried their
designs into execution", as Malcolm says.17 Krusinski, however, explains that
Gurgin operated as the Court had instructed, todeprive the Mughul govern
ment in India of any claim or justification upon which to base an incursion. This
meant that he had to keep the Afghans in check, especially to prevent them from
raiding Mughul territory.18 It is only when he is citing Mir Vais's remarks to the
anti-Gurgin faction at Court that Krusinski repeats terms as opprobrious about
the governor as any used by Kazim; they are quite contrary to what Krusinski
reports Mir Vais as telling Gurgln's supporters in Isfahan.19 Krusinski is
demonstrating Mir Vais's cunning and how the factionalism round the Shah
gave him scope toexercise it.
Muhammad Kazim describes Gurgin as considering himself unaccountable
at Qandahar, drinking heavily, and lusting for girls to the extent that he sent men
to fetch Mir Vais's beautiful daughter. According to this historian it was over
this impropriety that Mir Vais, a man of standing in his area, set out for the Court
to complain. Krusinski differs and says Gurgin sent this popular local notable to
Isfahan "not indeed asa prisoner", but todistance him from followers over
whom hisinfluence might be dangerous. Mir Vais's six-month sojourn in
Isfahan procured him neither the dismissal of the governor nor any redress, but
he went on thePilgrimage to Mecca and from there returned directly to
Qandahar armed with afatpa, a canon-law decree, from the Sunni religious
authorities in the Holy City, that sanctioned his throwing off Shl'I-Safavid
dominion exercised through an immoral governor ofdubious credentials as a
Muslim.20 On his return home Mir Vais is alleged tohave told his followers
about thedisorganized state of affairs in Isfahan, with theinference that
subservience tosuch a venal government need not be tolerated. Gurgin was
murdered. The rebels made Mir Vais their governor, but he died only very few
years later, in 1715, without taking his rebellion into metropolitan Iran. The
religious element in the Sunni Mir Vais's anti-Safavid propaganda deserves to be

borne in mind in relation to both Nadir Shah's later policy over religion and any
scruples he might have had over finally extinguishing the Safavid line.
After an interlude under Mir Vais's brother, who was ineffectual, the
government ofQandahar was seized by Mir Vais's son, Mahmiid. He made
capital out of his uncle cAbd al- Aziz's proposal to submit to Shah Sultan Husain
and out of the fact that the latter was preoccupied by a revolt of the Abdall tribe
of Afghanistan at Herat, to stage a coup successfully to oust his father's
designated successor. Meanwhile the Abdalls' rebellion was an instance of the
"restlessness" of the Afghans, to which Krusinski alludes more than once,
nearer toNadir's northern habitat than was Qandahar inthe latitudes ofthe
Iranian cities of Kirman, Yazd and Isfahan. The Abdall brothers, Abd-Allah
and Zaman Khan, were disaffected with Mahmiid Ghilzai and their purpose was
to take Herat from its Safavid governor. This threatened thecapital of
Khurasan, Mashhad, of which the governor responded to the plea of his
colleague in Herat by raising levies from his province. Baba All provided a five
hundred strong levy from Ablvard and marched with it leaving Nadir behind as
his deputy. Baba All was sent on aforward patrol. When the Afghans madea
surprise attack, near Chasht SultanI, Baba All was killed and his men retreated
to Mashhad. Jacfar Khan, the governor of Herat, capitulated to the victors
before the end of 1716.
Baba All's brother, Qurban All, was raised in his stead over Ablvard and
about the same time complaints were brought to the Afsharid chiefs about the
inroads of the Tekke Tiirkmens who were seizing the petitioners' womenfolk
and cattle. This was an appeal to ShIcI Afsharid braves (gha^iyari) for protection
and redress from predators who as Sunnls considered the enslavement of ShIcI
captives, or at least the subjects of a ShIcI government, legal since they regarded
these people as heretics. There was alesson in this for Nadir, as aman of this
vulnerable frontier, learning the effect on its inhabitants of a sectarian difference
due towhat he himself later termed the Safavids' "heresy".
Qurban All, who was probably already terminally ill, referred these appeals
to Nadir. With Baba All's son, Kalb All Beg, Nadir defeated the raiders and
returned in triumph, and in time forQurban All's obsequies, to Ablvard.
Indicative of the ostensibly ShIcI nature of Nadir's youthful environment is the
fact that Qurban All's body was taken to Mashhad, ashrine city sacred to the
Shlca, for burial. Anew governor was sent for Ablvard from Isfahan and,if
Kazim's chronology can be accepted, this Hasan All Khan must have reached
Ablvard in about 1720: Kazim says that disaster befell Isfahan in his second year
of office.

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
On arrival at Abivard, Hasan All Khan sent Nadir with a force of Safavid
troops bent on another of the several attempts made to regain Herat, a prize
ultimately reserved forNadir. On this occasion, his commander was Safi QulT
Khan Ziyadughlii, who, Kazim says, called inthe "Atak Army", the Abivard
based frontier force whose creation may be attributed to Baba CA1Iand Nadir ina
combined effort of several years' duration. Safi Quli Khan detached Nadir to
divert the Abdalis with an attack on their other centre atFarah. At this moment
news of an invasion bynumbers of Tiirkmens and Uzbeks under Shir Ghazi
Khan of Khiva caused a quick change ofplan. Nadir encountered Shir Ghazi
Khan's force near Jam. Joined by Safi Quli Khan, he participated in the routing
of Shir Ghazi Khan, so that theHerat campaign could be resumed.
The Abdalis proved more formidable than the recent raiders had done. They
defeated the Qizilbash near Kafir Qaf a, where Safi Quli Khan misdirected his
gunners and decimated his own infantry, enabling the Afghans to break his line.
Safi Quli Khan, Kazim says, was considered mad. Heblew himself up on a
powder-barrel. Nadir extricated hismen and safely returned to Abivard.
Kazim makes the Abdali seizure and successful retention of Herat the spurto
Mahmud Ghilzai of Qandahar's decision to mount his fardeeper inroads into
the Safavid Empire. Having taken this decision, Mahmud wrote to Malik
Mahmud of Slstan to ask forsupport, even if only token support. The Malik
prevaricated, butsaid he would consider joining Mahmud Ghilzai once the
latter had succeeded in establishing himself in central Iran.
When theCourt sought help for therelief of Isfahan, theanswer was in
general apathetic or pusillanimous. The Bakhtiyari tribes, for whom Isfahan was
the nearest city and market, proved an exception: the capital was too important
in their economy for them toneglect it inits worst hour. Fath CA1IKhan Qajar,
governor of Astarabad on the Caspian, wasapparently another exception,
although the veracity of the incident has been doubted. He managed to pass the
besiegers' lines by night, itis said, and recoup the royal army for abattle, but his
success excited thejealousy of the Shah's generals, who sought to have him
arrested byinsinuating that were heto defeat Mahmud, hewould curtailthe
Shah's powers. Fath All Khan made his escape with his force, atthe time when
the Shah's third son Tahmasp MIrza had been smuggled out of the beleaguered
city. Some annalists give credit tothe rumour that the Shah's second son, Safi
MIrza, was also sent away safely from Isfahan, to reappear subsequently as one of
the claimants to theSafavid throne.
Hasan CA1IKhan, the Safavid appointee toAbivard, eventually withdrew to
Mazandaran in an exit which seems to have been occasioned by realization of his

lack of standing in contrast to the growing influence of Nadir. As disturbances
were spreading in Khurasan with the demise of the central government in
Isfahan, asauve quipent situation must have developed in which the withdrawal
of an outsider, the agent of a no longer effective capital, would be explicable,
especially in 1722 or1723.
Malik Mahmud of SIstan, who hesitated to join forces with Mahmud Ghilzai
in the attack on Isfahan, took advantage of the disorders in Khurasan to playa
role which is important for the attempt to reconstruct Nadir's early career and in
particular that part of it on the eve of and just after his joining Tahmasp Mirza.
Malik Mahmud and his brother, Malik Ishaq, were from Sistan and claimed
Kayanid descent from ancient legendary Kayanid princes of Iran, although they
appear to have been no more than SistanI notables who seized the opportunity
provided by the fall of the Safavid state to satisfy their own territorial ambitions.
Malik Mahmud's exploits do infact illustrate a tendency for Iranian unity to
disintegrate when a powerful central government ceases tobe effective; also
they furnish a glimpse into the latent forces of opposition to a paramount power
which the latter might keep incheck, but only so long as it shows no sign of
wavering.
For present purposes, Mahmud of Sistan's encounters with Nadir Abivardi
made the next turning point in Nadir's career. After he had rebuffed Mahmud
Ghilzai, the Malik acted as if to verify an offer of renewed allegiance he made to
the stricken Shah by appearing to set out to help Shah Sultan Husain with a body
of some four thousand men. Hearing that Mahmud Ghilzai was soon totake
Isfahan, and receiving apresent from him of two camel-loads of silk and cash
and jewels, he sent his brother to raid the Khurasanian town of Sabzavar and
himself took a more easterly route through Tabas and Tun, recruiting more men
as he proceeded towards what he then saw as his destined prize, Mashhad.
The Safavid authorities in Mashhad had been unable to control the confusion
which broke out there when news of the fall of Isfahan became known. The
governor was killed by a party ofassailants which supported a certain Hajji
Muhammad whom one source names, more evocatively in an Iranian context, as
Mulla Nauruz, the Mulla of the New Day or New Era. He was one of a group of
outlaws from the hills round the city. Acrowd of ruffians recognized himas
their Pahlavan or champion. Their attack on the government precincts encom
passed, besides the murder of the governor, that of such officials as the inspector
of weights and measures and a senior revenue assessor. It is easy to see who were
the main targets of hatred. Pahlavan Hajji Muhammad distributed these officers'
possessions among his followers and declared himself the ruler of Mashhad.

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
News of Malik Mahmud's approach filled him with such alarm that he wrote
to the Malik and promised loyalty. This was, however, only afeint: he planned
to lure Malik Mahmud into the city and then put him to death. The Malik saw the
stratagem but decided to play the Hajji's game. The Hajjl and leading citizens
went out to meet Malik Mahmud. Itwas atthis stage that the Haj jl had hoped to
be able todo away with the Malik, but Malik Mahmud was careful tokeep his
guard closely packed around him. Once Malik Mahmud was in the city, the Hajjl
also had his own abode well-guarded. Malik Mahmud took up residence in the
former governor's quarters andwhen he held his first reception, the Hajjl
entered with ashow of sovereign pomp. He expected to be treated as the Malik's
ally, but Mahmud told each ofthe notables to beseated in the places they had
been accustomed to under Safavid governors. The Hajjl, of course, had no such
seat. He found aplace inthe end, but shame and anger quickly drove him from
the assembly to hishouse. After a pretence at showing conciliation, Malik
Mahmud had the pleasure ofwitnessing the HajjFs desertion by his supporters
in the city, and his enforced retreat to his mountain village. Malik Ishaq was sent
to try cajolery, but the Hajji's determination to make a stand meant that he had to
be blasted out of his stronghold with cannon. He surrendered, was executed and
his body publicly exposed. Malik Mahmud had probably not wanted the matter
to come to this point because popular feelings might have been involved, but the
Hajji's resistance left him no alternative but touse the artillery upon which,as
Nadir was soon to learn, heheavily relied.
Malik Mahmud entered Khurasan at a time when men apprehensive of
Nadir's growing power could exploit hispresence. The two men could be
played off against each other, but this was agame Malik Mahmud could play too,
using Nadir's rivals on the basis of letting dog eat dog. Kazim says that on Hasan
CA1I Khan's departure for Mazandaran, "chiefs and warlords who had been ants
became snakes and those who were foxes turned into lions. Some of them joined
Nadir in quest of means: most who entered Nadir's service and were submissive
did so for gain."21 Butmany other chiefs, who hadsufficient following to
entertain a sense oftheir own position and noreason to feel gratitude forany
generosity from Nadir, adopted what Kazim describes as an equivocaland
hostile attitude. Nadir still had too little strength to take astrong line with these
potential enemies. Like aman who knows the needs of the moment, he acted the
friend until commanders like Ashur Khan Babalu went to Malik Mahmud to
ask for a governor. This was a move Nadir could nottolerate.
21 Muhammad Kazim, vol. i, fol.29a.

ORIGINS AND FRONTIER EXPERIENCES
The Sistani received the chiefs courteously. Later, an opportunity was
granted cAshur Khan Babalu and his companions, Imam Quli Beg and Qilich
Khan Beg, to lodge the complaint that Nadir had made himself head of the
Ablvard district andwas a rebel acting in contempt of high-born officers.
Implying that, left tohis own devices, Nadir could become a threat to Malik
Mahmud, they advised the despatch of a trusted courtier to the Ablvard
government to procure, bywhatever means, the miscreant and bring him to
Malik Mahmud.
The Begs had met more than their match inMalik Mahmud. He complied
with their suggestion, but not in the spirit they wished. He chose as the "trusted
courtier" no less aperson than one of the people of the former Safavid official,
Muhammad Zaman Khan. Muhammad Amin Beg was of the aqvam ("people")
of Muhammad Zaman Khan, the Qurchi Bashi, who had been killed in Herat.
Muhammad Zaman Khan was a Shamlu; Muhammad Amin Beg doubtless
shared his former master's Turkmen background. When he entered Malik
Mahmud's service, he inhis turn became Qurchi Bashi. When Malik Mahmud
invested him with the governorship ofAblvard, heat the same time issued a
brevet for Nadir's appointment as Ishik Bash! and also gave him the functions of
Divan BegJ. Thus Nadir was tobe made aparty to Malik Mahmud's assumption
of power over Khurasan. Hehad already been styled Ishik Bashi, but the
juridical office of Divan Begi signalled anew departure. Itwould be far-fetched
to seein Nadir's divanbegigarl, to useKazim's word, at Ablvard an exact
reflection of this office's importance under the Safavids in Isfahan, but the
inference can be drawn that Nadir now held an office which made him an
arbitrator in disputes and theofficial hearer of people's appeals for justice.
Kazim cannot resist pointing out that Malik Mahmud's action demonstrated his
cleverness and foresight. He was certainly clever enough to see the value of
making abid for the support of a man already strong; and itmay be that Nadir's
receipt of these appointments from theMalik gave Mirza Mahdi Khan the
impression that fora time Nadir was actually in Malik Mahmud's service at
Mashhad, afact not attested by Muhammad Kazim. The Malik flattered Nadir's
detractors by saying that his favours to Nadir were a ruse to lure him to
Mashhad, where he would be eliminated. Perhaps he did not tell them that the
letters of appointment were accompanied by promises of further favours, should
Nadir display sincerity in carrying out his new duties.
The chiefs returned to Ablvard to witness an amicable sharing of duties
between Muhammad Amin Beg and Nadir, which aroused Imam Quli Beg's and
Qilich Beg's intense envy. Muhammad Amin had to warn Nadir of the evil these
17

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
men were speaking ofhim. Nadir, apparently profoundly hurt, adopted the
tactic of retiring from the scene. He went to the Darra Gaz and took up residence
for a few days in his own fortress there. Faithful chiefs resorted to him and
promised that, ifhe gave leave, they would exact revenge on his calumniators.
Nadir restrained them. The opposition could be left to become intoxicated by its
apparent success and lulled into extravagant boldness. Muhammad Amin then
sent Nadir a robe of honour and directions to return which, "as the exigencies of
the time seemed todictate", he did. The old pattern was resumed. Nadir had
great powers deputed to him, and masters of their own troops like Imam Quli
Beg and Qilich Khan found subordination tohim more intolerable than ever.
They returned to Malik Mahmud with complaints of Nadir's high-handedness.
He promised to summon Nadir and exact retribution. Ashur Khan abandoned
the contest and shut himself in his qalca. News of this must have interested Malik
Mahmud, ifhis intention was to bend the power of the Abivard leaders on the
anvil oftheir hostility to Nadir.
Nadir seems tohave understood the situation very well. He treated Ashur
Khan with courtesy and concluded a pact of unanimity with him, once the Khan
had surrendered. The surrender had not been purchased cheaply. Many lives had
been lost and Nadir had refused peace overtures until he had accomplished the
total destruction of Ashur Khan's qalca bysurrounding it with water. This
done, Nadir was ready to receive Ashur Khan and exchange presents with him
in Abivard.
Nadir dealt differently with the custodian of another of the district's
strongholds. AllahvardI Beg Babalu ingratiated himself with the local chiefs and
rlsh-safldan ("white beards") and then peremptorily rejected Nadir's overtures.
There was a battle, but atnightfall AllahvardI Beg gallantly sent Nadir's camp
trays of food and was given safe-conduct to visit it. A tent having been provided
for him, after he retired Nadir set about interrogating the chiefs who had come
with AllahvardI Beg. They told Nadir that his guest had often said he would
settle Nadir's account if ever the chance presented itself. Nadir decided to strike
first. He had AllahvardI dragged from his bed and decapitated. He had ques
tioned the chiefs about the state of Allahvardi's stronghold, which he now
captured, gaining also "an abundance" ofcattle.22
Nadir's purpose seems to have been to reduce potential rivals either by force
followed by conciliation and the gaining of their assistance, or by force followed
by a readiness tobe friendly which could swiftly turn tomurderous hostility,
22 ibid., vol. i, fol. 31a (p. 73).

made the more effective by surprise. Extra manpower would become available
by the employment of either tactic. Submissive chiefs brought their people with
them. Murdered chiefs left leaderless men for Nadir to take over. If Malik
Mahmud's policy was as has been suggested, it fortuitously helped Nadir: the
Malik's miscalculation was that he did not give sufficient credence to Nadir's
strength and determination. He no doubt thought that the time would come
when only Nadir would be left, master of the field but his for the plucking. Nadir
was going to make himself master but he was not going to be plucked.
Muhammad Kazim gives clear evidence forNadir's alternating policies of
friendliness and ruthlessness. He is equally clear on the consequences of success
in the kind of society Nadir was working to dominate: chiefs from all sides were
soon attracted into the successful leader's service. They converged on the fortress
of Abivard, to place themselves at Nadir's disposal. Nadir's power grew greater
day by day.
When Nadir heard that Malik Mahmud contemplated assuming the status of
a crowned king and was about to send a force against Abivard, he made a raid on
the suburbs of Mashhad to contain Mahmud's forces in their base. Nadir's small
but highly mobile force of twelve hundred young troopers met stiff resistance
from Mahmud in a two-day encounter, but Nadir's mobility and his men's
courage in hand-to-hand fighting prevented Mahmud's well-ordered force from
destroying him. He escaped with enough booty to invite repetition of such a raid
on Mashhad's outlying districts.
In 1137/1724—5 Mahmud declared that through divine intervention the
Shrine of the Eighth Imam of the Twelver Shica had become a seat of power
whence Afghans and rebels everywhere could expect punishment. The coinage
would be minted and khutba, the Friday Bidding Prayer, recited in his name as
king. In what appears to have been ahatchet-burying exercise, the chiefs were
invited to make submission for the new king's favours, an invitation some of
them, notably Shah Vardi Khan and Muhammad Riza Khan of the
Chamishgazak Kurds, accepted. All the khans from Sabzavar, Nishapur, Khwaf
and Jam entered the presence of the "Padshah-i Kayani". Nadir was one of those
who ignored the rumour of the Malik's justice which was being spread far and
wide: he "buckled on the belt of rebellion . . . and was bent on equipping an army
to fend for himself".23
He urged two of the Jalayirid Begs to join him and they approached the Vakil
of their tribe, who had for some time privately cherished an admirationfor
23 ibid., vol. 1,fol. 32a (p. 76).

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
Nadir. One of the most enduring alliances of Nadir's life began. Tahmasp Vakll-i
Jalayir left the area of Ab-i Garm to become Nadir's Vakilal-Daula. Kazim may
be right toascribe this alliance directly toMalik Mahmud's open assumption of
royal powers over Khurasan. Thecontest wasnowoneof Nadir and the
Jalayirid Tahmasp against Malik Mahmiid, who had formidable forces on his
side.
It seems that while he had been busy inAbivard and contending against his
rivals, as well as watching the movements ofMalik Mahmud, Nadir had lost his
hold on the hotly contested Kalat. Once he was reinforced by Tahmasp and the
Jalayirid contingents, Kalat was taken from the "helpless" GhafTar Beg 'Arab
(^arab-i bichard) and its custody given to Tahmasp. Kazim considers that Nadir
was by this time strong enough tothink ofconquests beyond his own locality.
He was alluding toamove against Sarakhs. Sarakhs was showing signs ofwhat
might happen toa peripheral border town when central government collapsed
and trade was disrupted: its governor could only signify allegiance toNadirby
offering the poorest of gifts. Kazim presents further evidence of the unsettled
times in his summary of various molestations of the Safavid state which
followed the example set by the Ghilzais and Abdalis of Qandahar and Herat. He
mentions first, as befitted a man who was from Marv, Tatars whose grounds
were spread between Marv and the Syr-Darya and who began preying on the
Khurasan and Mazandaran borders. Secondly, theLezgis of Daghistan who,
under Haj ji Da°ud Jam Talah, with Surkha°I Lezgi and Ottoman support, seized
Shirvan. Thirdly, the Ottoman Turks, who could not resist the opportunity to
move against a defeated and disintegrating Iran; a move that reasons of State
dictated as much as thecupidity excited by thegenuine economic and fiscal
strains to which theOttoman Empire was subject.
On hisescape from Isfahan, which Muhammad Muhsin dates to 12 June
1722, Shah Tahmasp reached Qazvln, which fell to the Afghans in December
1722; Tahmasp moved into Azarbaijan. When the Porte heard of Shah Sultan
Husain's deposition in October 1722, Ibrahim, the Ottoman governor at
Erzerum, wasdirected to campaign in Georgia. Hiscolleague at Baghdad,
Ahmad Pasha, was ordered todo likewise towards Kirmanshah and Hamadan.
Appeals to Tahmasp from Tiflis, Ahar, Erivan, Nakhchivan, Tabriz and
Maragha were useless: the fugitive Safavid hadno army. These cities, like
Kirmanshah andHamadan, had no alternative butto surrender.
With Azarbaijan closed to him, Tahmasp moved towards Mazandaran, to the
Qajar government at Astarabad. Russia was yet another invading power.
Kazim's treatment ofthe Russian episode isbriefly as follows. When Tahmasp
assumed the reins of government in Qazvln, hesent anenvoy to Russia. The

envoy, Ismacil Beg, explained that the Russians could consider the rescue of the
region from Gilan to Mazandaran as assigned to their good offices. If this wasthe
burden of IsmacIPs message, it was tosave face: the Tsar had anticipated the
Safavid embassy's invitation and already sent some ten to twelve thousand men
to secure Gllan. But IsmaciPs face-saving device seems to have gained him the
welcome which Kazim alleges his surrender of Gilan and Mazandaran was
intended to win for him. In Saint Petersburg in August 1723 he was accorded a
great reception. A treaty was concluded the next month, but when Ismacil
returned to Tahmasp he had to flee to escape punishment. He died in exileat
Astrakhan some twenty years later.
When Nadir turned his attention to the impoverished Sarakhs and the Atak
border region, Ashur Khan forgot his agreement and joined forces with Jacfar
Khan Shadlu of the Chamishgazak Kurds. He again took upa position of
defiance in a fortress, but an event now occurred which diverted Nadir from this
crisis and which gives a hint ofhis relationships with traders. Since news of
Nadir's strength had spread, Uzbek raids into Khurasan had abated and mer
chants had again been able toreach Mashhad and other parts of the province
for trading purposes. Now Nadir received an embassy from Shir Ghazi Khan of
Khiva. A party of Khwarazml merchants, whom Shir Ghazi Khan had sentto
Mashhad with an appreciable quantity of cloth and horses, had been attacked on
their journey home. Following directions given by Malik Mahmud, they were to
be escorted across the River Tejen by the governor of the village of Chahcha,
which was then subject tothe Malik. When the villagers demanded a toll an
altercation broke out in which the caravan was pillaged. Nadir was able to
restore to Shir Ghazi Khan's merchants all their losses, which were gold and
jewels: itseems that the Khwarazm trade was in cloth and horses, in return for
precious metals and stones.
This diversion did not afford Ashur Khan and his Kurdish allies much
respite. Nadir employed the five hundred men Shir Ghazi Khan had sent with
his delegation and reduced the fortress of Quzghan (or Guzgan) where Ashur
Khan was besieged. Nadir had at this time many calls upon his limited resources.
It was a phase of fortress-reduction in several quarters. Opponents were coming
out ina number of directions and each took refuge inforts rather than meet
Nadir in the open. This strategy also kept his forces locked up in protracted and,
to him, never welcome siege-operations. Jacfar Khan Shadlu the Chamishgazak
Kurd had surrendered, deserting Ashur Khan, but Nadir had next to cope with
a group ofAll III Tiirkmens who based themselves on a place called Khurmand
in the neighbourhood ofNlshapiir. He left his brother Ibrahim incharge of
operations against Ashur Khan and made asurprise attack on the Tiirkmens,
21

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
many of whom he slew andmany of whom, with their cattle, he captured.
Ibrahim reached an understanding with Ashur Khan and entreated Nadir, with
success, totake him again into his confidence. Nadir probably needed men; Shir
Ghazi Khan's five hundred, Mirza Mahdi Khan tells us, were, however,
dismissed once Quzghan was reduced.24
During these engagements Hasan All Beg the Mucaiyir Bash! (Chief Assayer)
or Muaiyir al-Mamalik (Assayer of the Realms) arrived with a party from
Tahmasp Mirza, Shah Tahmasp II, ostensibly toannounce toNadir the Shah's
intention of entering Khurasan, and toask him tobe ready with an army. Nadir
promised service at whichever point the Shah entered the province, but itis to be
suspected that the visit from Hasan CA1IBeg was primarily to gather intelligence
about Nadir's position and power. Tahmasp, inMazandaran, was beginning to
assemble anarmy under the guidance ofFath All Khan Qajar, and had heard
rumours of Nadir's new ascendancy.
Besides the All III Tiirkmens, who inconjunction with the Yimri Tiirkmens
sought Nadir's help against the depredations of the Goklen and Yamut
Tiirkmens, a party ofthe Kurdish settlers at Abivard was representing to him
that heshould make common cause with their leaders against Malik Mahmud.
Meanwhile, he received further deputations, this time from a Darvish AIT
Sultan Hazara and Dilavar Khan Taymani Bughair, complaining about the same
Goklen andYamut raiders whom others desired his strength to repel. He
postponed action on these requests until he had attended to problems in the
northeast.
It was more urgent in his judgement to return to the Atak and Marv areas.
Settlement there would mean more security forhis bases at Abivard and Kalat.
Furthermore, ifhe asserted himself in the northeastern region ofKhurasan and
along the Atak frontier, he would have control of Mashhad's routes into
Transcaspia; the Marv—Tus road would be his. The misfortune of the
Khwarazmian merchants, which Nadir had alleviated, provides aclue to the fact
that Malik Mahmud was trying to revive trade along these routes, control of
which, as Nadir may well have perceived, would be damaging to Malik Mahmud
and would willy-nilly make Nadir acceptable among mercantile people. So he
first responded tothe requests for aid against the Tatars which he received from
men such as Shah Quli Beg, son of Muhammad All Beg, the Ishik Aqasi Bashi of
Marv, and which were also pressed byAhmad Sultan and the other Qizilbash
notables of Marv who were already permanently in Nadir's entourage.
Marv hadsuffered from theexcesses of Muhammad AllBeg who, when

appointed Ishik Aqasi Bashi, had surrounded himself with ruffians and devoted
himself to debauchery. Muhammad All's hangers-on had refused to co-operate
with Muhammad Amln Khan, who had been sent to replace him. Muhammad
Amln Khan had been forced to flee to Mashhad; his detractors in Marv reported
to Isfahan that his overbearing conduct had made him unacceptable and that any
replacement would receive the same treatment. These events can, therefore, be
dated to before Shah Sultan Husain's fall, but their nature makes it clear that they
happened late in the decline of that Shah's power. The next attempt to supersede
Muhammad AH was, infact, made by Malik Mahmud. His nominee to Marv
suffered the same fate as Muhammad Amln.
When Muhammad All died, he left three sons, one of whom, Pulad Beg,
succeeded, but in the anarchy which followed, the Tatars, while outwardly
professing Safavid—Qizilbash loyalties, tricked Pulad Beg into joining them in a
fraternal meal and fell on him and his retinue. Pulad managed to escape but his
men were slain and the Tatars cut off Marv's water supply. To these hardships
for the people of Marv was added, in 1136/1723—4, aplague which left Marv a
ruin. Its restoration became one of Nadir's long-pursued and favourite schemes.
Pulad Beg and Shah Quli went into Khurasan to seek help from the Kurds; but
in 1137/1724—5 it was Nadir they approached.
Nadir probably knew the Persian adage, "Threatened with death a patient is
content with afever." So long as different groups in Khurasan were in quest of
help they would not be a danger to him and he could look on while they fell into
further difficulties. Itis a measure of his strength, and of his determination to
conserve it, that he could exercise restraint and select his own time to grant
requests for aid which were now repeatedly coming to him. He lent some men to
Pulad Beg and Shah Quli, but advised them to go to the Kurdish chief, Shah
VardI Khan. Nadir's answer disappointed them. So did Shah Vardi Khan's,
which Nadir might have foreseen: Shah VardI Khan recommended recourse to
Malik Mahmud.
Malik Mahmud did more than prevaricate. He received the Tatar leader,
Askar Beg, with a cordiality that made the Marvi suppliants aware that no help
could be expected from him. Finally, the wretched populace of Marv was driven
away by hunger to a place called Turkman Qalca. It was now that Nadir moved.
He defeated the Marv Tatars with reinforcements from the Bayat, Muhammad
Beg. In asecond successful encounter, he distributed the Tatars' goods among
his men and led the defeated Tatars' women and children into captivity. With his
customary concern forcollecting people, hetransported these Tatars to a
fortress in the Abivard district. Leaving Pulad Beg governor of Marv, he also
removed some one thousand ofthe Marv Qizilbash toAbivard. The whole

region of the Atak down as far as Khabushan was now obedient to this new lord
of the frontier.
The Kurdish element in this tribal frontier-mosaic remained refractory. Shah
Vardi Khan, leader of the Kaivanlu, appealed for help against the "Darra Gaz"
Afshars, who were footloose hooligans {bl sar opa), to the Chamishgazak
Kurdish leaders, and proposed an assembly ofKurdish interests attheir centre,
Khabushan. Shah Vardi Khan and his allies wrote to Nadir and asked him what
he wanted, towhich he answered that he wished to form amarriage-tie with the
sister ofMuhammad Husain Zacfaranlu, chief ofthe Chamishgazak. He added
that he hoped hisand their powers could become one.
The Kurdish leaders did not see matters in the same way, but were eventually
put to flight in an engagement in which Nadir had to fight hard to keep the battle
in his favour. He laid siege to Khabushan and the Kurds sued forterms. If he
would return to Ablvard, they would agree to the union he had proposed. Nadir
complied. It was at about this time Nadir's brother Ibrahim married Tauhid
Khan Afshar's daughter, by whom hisson AH Quli was born.
Nadir now decided tomarch into Juvain and IsfaraDIn — amove towards the
River Atrak and beyond Khabushan into more westerly districts. Some of the
Bughaira and Gira-Ili Turkmen tribes were displaced when Kurds had been
settled at Bujnurd over a century before and it was among these people that
Nadir now went. It seems that they readily joined him. They became important
adjuncts tohis power. He was gaining more allies but, perhaps because ofthis,
the craving for increased treasure that was to dog him to the end of his days had
already begun. In anopportunist and unsentimental society, the more a leader
had dependants, the greater was hisneed for credit so that his subordinates'
belief in hislimitless capacity to reward their services could be maintained.
Beyond his immediate kin, Nadir, in amassing a large army, moved intothe
exigent realm of mercenaries' demands. Kazim, intreating this stage of Nadir's
career, makes a remark that portends what the world from Tiflis toDelhi was
later to experience. After gaining theadherence of the Bughaira and Gira-Ili
tribes, Nadir swiftly returned to Sarakhs. From there, he sent out araiding party
to Khwaf and Bakharz, west of the Hari Rud towards the city of Herat. The
raiders returned with booty and prisoners. One ofthese reported toNadir the
Afghans' oppressive treatment ofthem, inparticular, their constant violations
of the women of Khwaf; but, he added, "They don't pillage our goods like your
army does."25

TAHMASP QULI KHAN
TAHMASP QULI KHAN
The last months of1726 were crucial in Nadir's career. He met Shah Tahmasp,
Fath CA1I Khan Qajar was putto death, and, with Malik Mahmud defeated,
Mashhad was restored to Safavid control through Nadir's agency. The Shah had
made him akhan before they met atKhabushan. When he presented himself to
Tahmasp, he was dubbed Tahmasp Qull Khan. He is referred to at the time of his
reception bytheShah as Nazr Qull Beg.
Muhammad Muhsin wrote hisZubdat al-tavarikh (Essence of Histories) in
1154/1741—2 forNadir's eldest son, Riza Qull, before this prince was blinded.
The date ofwriting absolves the author from suspicion ofbeing influenced, as
Muhammad Kazim may have been, by thedesire notto offend the Qajars.
Kazim's only known manuscript is dated 1210/1795—6, within theperiod of
Qajar domination. Mirza Mahdl Khan apparently wrote most ofhis historyof
Nadir Shah during the Shah's lifetime, buthemay later have notwanted to
displease the Qajars. Reliance alone on these two sources' version of the death of
Fath cAli Khan Qajar would leave Nadir's part inthe episode only doubtfully
authenticated. Moreover, the two differ. Mirza Mahdl makes Nadir appear to
advocate clemency. He reports that Nadir advised Shah Tahmasp toincarcerate
Fath cAli Khan rather than doaway with him. Temporary confinement in the
Kalat would have left Nadir peerless in thefield, to claim sole credit for the
restoration of Mashhad to Safavid control. Meanwhile, Fath CA1I Khan, a
hostage among Nadir's friends, impressed byNadir's strength inthat remote
part ofKhurasan, might understand that his best course would be co-operation
with the other most effective man in Shah Tahmasp's entourage. Thus Mirza
Mahdl Khan's version of the event does notlack plausibility.
Muhammad Muhsin's account tallies more with Kazim's less favourable •• •
description of Nadir's behaviour. In both heappears, if not astheman who
committed the murder, asthe one who supervised it. There isalso a difference
over the question ofFath CA1I Khan's reluctance tomake thefinal assaulton
Mashhad andMalik Mahmud, in an expedition theannalists agree he had
originally instigated.
The reasons they give vary, but Muhsin and Mirza Mahdl Khan concur that
Fath cAli Khan wanted to return to Astarabad andpostpone theattack on
Mashhad. Kazim does not mention Fath "All's qualms, and Muhsin isthe only
one among the three who reports that he went so far as secretly to write toMalik
Mahmud. Mirza Mahdl says that the Qajar felt his forces were deficient and the
winter weather inimical tocontinuing thecampaign. Tahmasp IFstrouble in
Cambridge Histories Online © Cambridge University Press, 2008



NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
Azarbaijan was lack of an army and generals. At Astarabad, however, he found a
warm welcome from the Qajars and had reason to hope they would provide the
military force hesobadly needed. Kazim says they assembled thirty thousand
men for Khurasan's "conquest". Muhsin also indicates that the Qajar
contingent was numerous.
Elimination ofMalik Mahmud seems tohave been anobvious priority and
according toKazim, Fath All Khan urged it,but after Nadir "had entered the
Shah's heart", Tahmasp complained ofFath All Khan on the grounds thathe
had pressed forthe Khurasan expedition when Tahmasp desired above all to
regain Isfahan. Tahmasp alleged that the Qajar had used strong language, and
Nadir promised to bring himFath All Khan's head whenever he should
command. He had then visited Fath All Khan, who thought the call an ordinary
one of courtesy, but Nadir had him murdered by some Kurds. No Qajar rival, as
in Mirza Mahdi's version, was involved. The Shah was satisfied and made Nadir
his Qurchi Bashi. Courtiers whispered that at Nadir's hands the Shah would one
day find himself in like case to Fath All's.26
When theShah and Fath AllKhan reached Khabushan they were in the
Chamishgazak Kurds' country. According to Muhsin, the reason for Fath All's
anxiety was distrust ofthe Kurds' professions of fidelity. Then Nadir arrived,
promptly to beshown the Shah's highest regard. To Fath All's other worries
was added disquiet over theman who seemed destined to supplant him. In
Khurasan he was not on his home-ground whereas Nadir certainly was. Muhsin
says he decided to return to Astarabad, "to repair hisplans". Muhsin also
comments on tribes flocking toNadir's banner daily and remarks that not only
had Nadir never wavered in his refusal to commit himself to Malik Mahmud, but
in frequent engagements hadmanaged to capture much of the cannonand
ordnance in which theMalik's strategic superiority had lain. Shah Tahmasp
could hardly fail toappreciate that, now no longer inQajar Mazandaran but in
Nadir's Khurasan, hehad found the man heneeded forthe next phase of the
mission to retrieve Iran. If Fath All looked like becoming a stumbling-block,
he must go. Kazim's assertion that it was courtiers who urged his removal may
suggest that thecourtiers were simply articulating what they took to be the
Shah's thoughts.
Muhsin says that Fath All's pique atNadir's assumption ofthe directionof
operations went so far that he contemplated treason and communicated with the
enemy. Malik Mahmud had marched out to meet the Shah but, possibly when he
26 Muhammad Kazim, vol. i, fol.46a~46b.

TAHMASP QULI KHAN
heard ofNadir's arrival, had withdrawn behind the defences ofMashhad. Fath
All's treasonable correspondence was exposed and the Shah called him to his
khalvat-khanafora private talk. "With the good offices and help ofNazr Beg"
Fath Allwas fetched, saw the Shah andthen Nadir pulled him outsideand
"brought him to his just deserts and brought his head into the Sacred
Presence".27
The way was clear to invest Mashhad. The move Kazim claims the Qajars had
desired to have postponed till thesun entered Pisces — after 20Februaryand
therefore in early spring 1727 — followed their leader's death in October 1726
and was completed with the fall of Mashhad in December. It would nothave
been so easy but for the defection of Malik Mahmud's Commander-in-Chief, Pir
Muhammad. He arranged with Nadir to open agate for the army's entrance. He
seems to have read the times correctly: Khurasan, with the sanction of the Shah's
favour, was Nadir's. Malik Mahmud's brief day was over. He took refuge inthe
Shrine but later, with his brothers Ishaq and Muhammad AH, was put to death
on Nadir's orders, because hebegan to intrigue when Nadir was engaged with
the Chamishgazak Kurds.
The Kurdish leaders defected assoon asMashhad had fallen. They tried to
gain the royal person for themselves and the vacillating Shah, urged perhaps by
courtiers jealous of Nadir, seems to have accepted theKurdish leaders' claim
that they were ready tomarch toIsfahan and settle accounts with the Afghans.
He left Mashhad and secretly made for Khabushan, accompanied by his Master
of Ordnance andthe Ttimad al-Daula, Mirza Mu3min Qazvini. Nadir soon
followed and defeated the Kurds after charging them with kidnapping the Shah.
He left the Shah to find his ownwayback while he hurriedly returned to
Mashhad where, Muhsin says, he sealed the royal workshops and offices, and set
about ordering affairs. The chiefs listed byKazim asrecipients ofshares in the
Kurdish spoils show that Nadir's principal officers were mostly Afshars,
including Fath cAli Khan son ofBaba CA1IAbivardi. Marvis and Bughairi Turks
were also prominent and atthe head of the list stood Tahmasp Khan Jalayir. On
arrival inKhurasan and especially inthe redistribution ofoffices following Fath
All Khan Qajar's murder, Shah Tahmasp had spread his patronage among a
variety of tribal representatives. They included Shahvardi Begthe Kurd as
Tufangchl Aqasi, and Bairam All, a khan of the Bayat, as Na%ir. Hisvazirate
went to Mirza Qavam-i Qazvini. Besides Nadir, in the post of QurchI Bashi,
Nadir's brother-in-law, Kalb All Khan, held the office of Ishik Aqasi. But as

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
Muhsin says, "the reins of choice" were in Nadir's hands, although his post,
equivalent to war minister, was notthat of chief minister.
Tahmasp was inMashhad for the New Year and the festivities surrounding
Nadir's marriage toa sister ofone ofthe Kurdish leaders. There were fourteen
days of rejoicing, but the marriage did not end Kurdish disaffection. The next
objective was to be Herat, but the projected union of Nadir's Mashhad army
with one organized bytheShah's general, Muhammad All ibn Asian Khan,
never occurred incentral Iran: Nadir was toattempt Herat on his own. The fact
that writers like Muhsin exaggerate when they ascribe all power to Nadir atthis
stage becomes evident when we learn of the Shah's declaration that whichever of
his two generals succeeded first would be made Vakil al-Daula, the other being
left ashis subordinate. What Muhsin and Nadir's other historians might with
truth have claimed isthat at this time Nadir was sufficiently in control to have
exercised more power than he did, had he wished to, but that he was too prudent
to be over-hasty. Hecould always wait.
On this occasion hedid not have to wait long forthe results of the Shah's
contrived rivalry between him and Muhammad All ibn Asian Khan to appear.
Muhammad All intrigued with the Kurds against Nadir, who once more hadto
hasten totheir defeat, this time at Sabzavar. Tahmasp was inthe plot and again
had tocrave Nadir's pardon, as he had done after his earlier withdrawal into the
Kurdish camp. He again received it: hewas too valuable a symbol to be lost to
rivals.
Nadir had trouble from Muhammad CA1Ta second time. Muhammad All's
brother, ZuDl-Fiqar, had established himself in Mazandaran and the two took
advantage ofNadir's absence onhis first Herat expedition to consolidate their
forces. Nadir returned andMuhammad Allmade hispeace. Zui-Fiqar was
executed and Nadir resumed action onthe Herat front, where hesucceeded in
the early summer of 1729. He exacted small punishment from that key city and
left oneof his former Abdali enemies, Allahyar Khan, as Herat's officially
installed governor. The Herat operations had entailed alengthy siege and it was
essential to finish the business without further delay; the attack onthe Ghilzai
Ashraf at Isfahan could notbe putoff any longer.
Ashraf, who had succeeded his cousin, Mahmud, asAfghan ruler in Isfahan
after Mahmud's murder in 1725, had tried to relieve the pressure on Herat by
marching from Isfahan towards Khurasan in July—August 1729. Hewastoo
late: it wasjust after Herat hadfallen. Nadir defeated himin the battle of
Mihmandust on29 September.28 By November Ashraf had sustained a second

defeat in the battle of Murchakhur. On 13November hefled from Isfahan,
which Nadir entered three days later. The Shah, who had been left at Tehran,
joined him on 29 November and permitted the fulfilment of a promise when he
allowed the marriage of Nadir to his sister, Raziyya Begum, while another sister,
Fatima Begum, was bethrothed to Nadir's son, Riza Quli. The Chevalier de
Gardane describes Nadir as being about forty years of age at this time; if 1698 is
taken asthe year of his birth, hewas thirty-one.
The year 1730 was at first chiefly taken upwith the pursuit ofthe fleeing
Afghans and reconquest of Fars, followed by that of western Iran and
Azarbaijan. Diplomatic action included sending Riza Quli Khan Shamlu to the
Porte, toannounce the Shah's restoration tohis capital and require the Otto
mans' withdrawal from Iranian soil; and All Mardan Khan Shamlu to Delhi, to
ask the Mughul, Muhammad Shah, to close his frontiers toAfghan fugitives
from Iran, a matter Nadir was able touse later as acasus belli. Muhammad AIT
Khan was appointed Governor ofFars, and Nadir departed for Dizful and the
western marches on 8 March for aspring campaign. He met Muhammad Khan
Baluch returning from his embassy tothe Turks of 1727 onbehalf of Ashraf
Ghilzai. Nadir, although hewas later to have cause to regret it, established
Muhammad Khan Baluch as governor over the Kuhgiluya district between Fars
and Khuzistan. InJune he retook Hamadan and entered Tabriz on 12 August.
Distant Afsharid kin in Azarbaijan had not responded to Nadir's blandishments
with the enthusiasm he might have expected, but the merchants and notables of
Tabriz welcomed him with open arms and pleaded with him to be their guest for
the winter.
He could not accept this invitation because on 16 August news came from
Mashhad which compelled speedy action. His brother Ibrahim had been left in
charge of Mashhad. When the Abdalis of Herat launched an attack, Ibrahim was
not equal to the occasion. Allahyar Khan had been dismissed from his governor
ship by Zu'1-Fiqar the Abdali. This man proved susceptible to promptings from
Husain Sultan Ghilzai ofQandahar that he should attack Khurasan. Mashhad
was surprised and ill-prepared. By what seemed a miracle it was saved when
ZuDl-Fiqar withdrew as suddenly as he had arrived. Hearing that this had
happened, Nadir sent warning to his brother that he had better hide himself in
Ablvard lest Nadir should kill him when he saw him. Nadir slowed his march
and did not reach Mashhad until November. Tabriz! notables had accompanied
him part ofthe way and coupled their pleas that he should winter intheir city
with offers of a large sum of money and guaranteed tax receipts. Nadir was
uncertain whether to continue eastwards, but news from Herat was decisive.

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
Zu3l-Fiqar had been reinforced by an army from Qandahar under the exception
ally brave Saidal Khan.
While Nadir was preoccupied in Khurasan andat Herat, Shah Tahmasp
rashly chose to try conclusions with the Turks. His army gave every evidence of
extremely bad leadership in Nadir's absence. The Shah was eventually bottled
up atErivan and severely defeated inthe battle ofKurijan. The Turks regained
Tabriz and Hamadan, and in January 1732 Shah Tahmasp concluded a treaty
with them onterms considered humiliating enough for Nadir tobe able to use
this treaty forhis own purposes: inwell-publicized despatches, herebuked the
Shah for affronting ShicT sentiment by such abject submission to a Sunni Power.
Nadir's second Herat campaign lasted from March 1731 nearly tothe endof
the following February. He sent Allahyar Khan, whose failure to conciliate
rivals had precipitated his fall, toexile inMultan. Sixty thousand other Abdalis
were transplanted to Mashhad, Nishapur andDamghan. Nadir was already
building up an Afghan counterpoise toother elements inthe array ofheteroge
neous forces he was assembling into a war machine.
He did not hurry tocorrect the ills resulting from Shah Tahmasp's ill-judged
venture into war. He waited in Mashhad while petitions reached him from
Isfahan about the Shah's sottish conduct and the depredations of an army which
there was nobody tokeep inorder. It was not until August 1732 that he arrived,
to be met atKashan by the Shah's chief critics, Mir Abu 31-Qasim Kashi, Hasan
All the MucaiyirBashi&nd the Nadlm al-Majlis, Zaki Khan. Ithad been they who
sent Nadir copies ofthe severe terms of the Ottoman Treaty, and who had been
begging him tocome tothe rescue. At Kashan, Kazim says, they warned Nadir
that theShah's evil counsellors hadsuggested theinvasion of Khurasanand
capture ofNadir, who should be made topay for the life of Fath All Qajar with
his own. Nadir made these alleged plans against him the pretext for entering the
suburbs of Isfahan surrounded by an imposing guard andparade of force;
Muhammad Khalil Marcashi Safavi, an irrefutably hostile witness, attributes
Nadir's delay in reaching the capital to his having augmented his army sothat
when he arrived he would have a force none dare oppose.29
It certainly seems tohave frightened the Shah. He fled toan outlying village
and may have thought of fleeing further afield, but Nadir protested loyalty in the
gentlest terms and Tahmasp was persuaded to meet him. The kind words did not
cease and the Shah soon returned Nadir's visit tohim. Nadir received him in a
camp he had specially prepared inthe Hazar Jarib garden. Knowing Tahmasp's

tastes, he had brought favourite musicians from Khurasan for the Shah's
entertainment. While the Shah amused himself, Nadir went outside and staged
an outburst of anger against those courtiers whom he charged with having
pandered to the Shah's vices. This ruse worked. Thecourtiers immediately
transferred the blame for the Shah's conduct tothe Shah himself. They said that
they had tried unavailingly torestrain him. Nadir took his cue: obviously it was
imperative to replace a Shah so palpably unfit to rule. Nadir thus made the
leading men of the Court denounce the Shah out of their own mouths, and itwas
a party ofthem who went into Tahmasp and told him hemust abdicate. They
came back with the royal insignia andNadir again addressed the assembled
company. He informed them that "the QUmara of[Persian] cIraq"30 had deposed
Shah Tahmasp and that he proposed that the Shah's infant son should be raised
to the throne as Abbas III. The Amirs and courtiers agreed and the Shah was
sent to Khurasan.
This is Kazim's account. Except in minor details, it does notconflict with
Muhsin's, butit is interesting because of its description of the artful way in
which the deposition was carried out; there seems noreason to doubt Nadir's
capacity forsuch a skilful, carefully stage-managed manoeuvre. On that day in
September 1732 he was not ready toshake the authority ofthe Crown any more
than he could help, nor ready himself to shoulder the blame forthe deposition.
He spread the responsibility forit among all the influential men present. Atthe
same time healso emphasized that to depose a legitimate sovereign was not a
light matter.
He made Tahmasp Khan Jalayir Governor of Isfahan and dis-embarrassed
himself ofMuhammad CA1IKhan ibn Asian Khan's presence by sending himas
his second envoy toDelhi. How fragile his hold still was over Iran's regions and
peoples was shown by the need, before he could embark on his second campaign
against theTurks, to suppress a Bakhtiyari rebellion. However, foreign con
quest would bea diversion from rebellion at home, especially when the armies
taken abroad comprised large numbers of men in a medley that included
representatives ofall the tribes most likely torebel. But the Baghdad campaign
was needed for other reasons. The Shah's failure had to beexpunged and, in
striking atBaghdad, Nadir was not only attacking the Ottomans' major provin
cial government adjacent toIran, but making abid for control ofthe trade-axis
from India through Basra and Baghdad tothe Levant. As forthe heterogeneity
of his army, accounts of the siege of Baghdad ring with thebrave deeds of

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
Afghans, Hazaras, Bakhtiyarls and Azarbaijanis. Hunger was what made tribes
refractory. They looked forthe spoils of foreign conquest. Unfortunately, to
accumulate these spoils became an obsession which in the end left Nadir no time
for more constructive policies. Another task also became paramount, the
requirement to find the money, equipment and provisions foranarmy which
had to be bribed as well as accoutred andfed.
The first stage of the Baghdad campaign began in January 1733. In July
Nadir was severely defeated by Topal Osman Pasha, whom he met twenty miles
north of the city. Iran then had ataste of the rigours which Nadir could impose
on it. He retreated to Hamadan and between 4August and 2 October succeeded
in raising enough cash, estimated at£400,000, tore-equip his forces and resume
the war. Topal was defeated and killed south of Kirkuk and on 19 December
Ahmad Pasha ofBaghdad came toterms. Yet Nadir gained only a small return
for this most costly effort. The Porte, probably aware of Nadir's problems at
home, did nothurry to ratify thetreaty.
Muhammad Khan Baluch, whom he had left in charge of the fractious
Kuhgiluya, harnessed that area's turbulence in rebellion. Nadir was already
severely strained. He had tosend Lutf AIT, Baba All Abivardi's son, to secure
Tabriz against an Ottoman army under Ganj AllPasha. Muhammad Khan
Baluch was able to raise the whole of Khuzistan in arebellion which showed that
he could gain support from the mercantile centres ofthat region and along the
shore of the Persian Gulf. Such asituation left Nadir no time to tarry over terms
with Ahmad Pasha. He had to hasten into southwest Iran, where the trading
communities must have suffered more than they hadgained from Nadir's
expensive attempt to seize Baghdad.
The matter was terminated in Fars with Muhammad Khan's defeat and death.
By August 1734 Nadir was inArdabil preparing tofight Surkha°i, the Khan of
Shlrvan, forpossession of Shamakhi. In the spring Nadir had seen the Porte's
and Russia's envoys. He had been sceptical of the Ottoman peace proposals and,
after crossing the River Kura on21 August, towards Shamakhi, hedemanded
Baku and Darband from the Russians. In November, anunseasonable month
for any campaigner butNadir to fight in such an area, he carried hisnorth
western expedition as far as the gates of Ganja. At the Iranian New Year, March
173 5, he concluded the Treaty of Ganja by which he and the Russians established
a common frontier.31 Muhammad Kazim speaks of Nadir's conciliatory rela
tions with the Armenian Patriarchate atEchmiadzin, of his reception of Russian

merchants and of his asking how a woman, the Empress Anne, could be
sovereign of a great empire. He is alleged to have suggested that he become her
husband so that the two realms might be one.
For Erivan, "the frontier with the dominion of Rum", Nadir chose a Mm
Bdshl(master of a thousand) of his own bodyguard as governor. The Mm Bashl
was Muhammad Riza Beg KhurasanI, "of an old family undeviating in the way
of good service".32 Other centres, Ganja, the Qarabagh and Arran, were left
under local Qajars. Friendship had been secured with Russia. The enemy was to
be the Ottoman Turks. Erivan would be a keypoint.
When he turned from the south to the Caucasian isthmus, Nadir was going to
where wealth from trade might be more readily available at that juncture than in
the southwest. His Baghdad expedition must have disrupted the southern trade
and whenever the flow of trade in the Gulf was impeded, experience shows that
merchants were quick to use the Black Sea—Caucasus routes as alternatives. The
punishments meted out after Muhammad Khan Baluch's rebellion to cities like
Shushtar, Huvaiza and Kazarun were, to say the least, austere, but descriptions
of them include no reference to fines comparable with the 60,000 tumans raised
by "strict collectors" from the ashraf (highborn), the acjan (notables), the tujjar
(merchants) and the qavafil(caravans) of the Shirvan district. But, as if in an
attempt both to revive the Gulf trade and ensure his share in it, in April 1735
Nadir let his admiral, Latlf Khan, attempt the seizure of the port of Basra. Its
Pasha, having commandeered British ships, routed this attempt in June. Failure
at Basra was compensated for by the eventual successes in the Caucasus. In the
same June another formidable Ottoman Commander, cAbd-Allah Pasha, fol
lowed Topal Osman Pasha to a soldier's grave. By the autumn, although
Baghdad and its port of Basra had eluded his grasp, Nadir considered affairs
beyond Tabriz well enough established for winter relaxation to be possible on
the Mughan Plain. The holiday started with a vast hunt. It was to be followed by
the greatest rite in Nadir's life.
NADIR SHAH ( 1 7 3 6 —47)
In Iran when central government weakened and a period oimuluk al-tava'if'(an
interregnum of regional kings) began, a forceful tribal leader had scope in which
to extend his sway. He could gain strength by raiding or hiring himself out to
protect trade-routes. He might in the end become sufficiently well endowed

with men and arms, money and the loyalty of those for whom he could provide
security, to challenge whatever vestiges of an earlier hereditary power remained;
but initially, if prudent as well as ambitious, he would maintain that established
aegis as the means whereby, acting as its servant, heforged a cohesion of
interests beyond his immediate group. Since 1726 Nadir had been doing exactly
this. As Tahmasp Quli Khan, legitimacy had been conferred on his enterprises
and the support of numbers of Iranians ensured during the period in which he
had been engaged in clearing Iran of enemies of the Safavid State. At Isfahan in
September 1732 he had been at pains to prevent Tahmasp's deposition disrupt
ing the thread of legitimacy. He had endeavoured not to show disrespect for that
legitimacy by any action which could be ascribed to his initiative alone.
Tahmasp had to be deposed because the price being paid for maintaining
legitimacy through his sovereignty was proving too high. As the symbolof
legitimacy Abbas III cost nothing and could not impede Nadir's acquisition of
strength and glory under the child's weak auspices; but, for the sham not to seem
too obvious, Nadir let it be understood that when the Turkish threat had been
obviated, he would probably take steps for Shah Tahmasp's restoration.
Tahmasp, a prisoner in Khurasan, need not despair to the extent of trying
further intrigues against him; nor need others.
According to Muhammad Kazim, Nadir at first kept thoughts of ascending
the throne entirely to himself. He divulged nothing, even to his closest friends.
It was after the great hunting-party on the Chul-i Mughan that he unburdened
himself to his most trusted intimates. He suggested the land needed aruler and
that he was the only man universally obeyed. The small group of friends
included men like Tahmasp Khan Jalayir and Hasan All the Mucaiyir Bashi.
They did not demur, but Hasan All made no comment. Nadir himself pointed
out that they were only avery few compared with the many in Iran who might
not acquiesce in his going further, and who might prefer Shah Tahmasp or the
prince, Abbas III. He asked Hasan All why heremained silent. Hasan All
replied that itwould be best to call all the leading men of the realm and get their
agreement in a signed and sealed document of consent; Nadir could then ascend
the throne "to the satisfaction of God and His creatures". This proposal looks
exactly like the kind of advice a man of Hasan All's cloth, ostensibly on the side
of legality, would offer. Nadir approved of its sagacity. The writers of the Divan
(chancellery), who, Kazim says, included the historian, Mirza Mahdl
AstarabadI, were instructed to send out orders for the military, religious and lay
notables of the nation to assemble at Chul-i Mughan. Kazim may not have been
entirely fanciful when he mentions the lengthy talk which Nadir had later with

his brother Ibrahim, Kazim's employer. Ibrahim did not agree that the decline of
the old regime and Nadir's labours in ridding Iran of enemies justified extinction
of the Safavids and his enthronement. He reminded Nadir of Rustam's example.
Rustam had defeated the DIvs but had then restored the rightful ruler once those
forces of evil had been overcome: ancient heroes maintained the dynasties for
which they fought "out of chivalry, not to gain a name for themselves".33
Mirza Mahdi Khan states that Nadir's original intention was to hold aquriltai
at which to canvass the proposal that, since his work was accomplished and the
garden now cleared of weeds, it should be returned to its rightful gardeners. He
would retire to Kalat and prepare himself for the world to come. The Mughan
Plain was chosen as the meeting place because of its size and abundance of
fodder; the assembly was to be exceptionally large.
The sources agree on the main course of events followed in January,
February and March 1736 in the great encampment that was set up near the
confluence of the Aras and Kur (Kura) rivers. These events culminated in
Nadir's coronation on 8 March. But Mirza Mahdi Khan takes refuge in brevity.
His summary of what occurred excludes, not only Nadir's discussions with his
henchmen and brother, but also the murder of the Mulla BashJ, Mirza Abu31
Hasan, and the drinking parties during which Nadir gained time and oppor
tunity to plumb the minds and hearts of the chief men of Iran, to test their
loyalty. Kazim says that Nadir had spies outside the tents, to catch what these
men might say privately to each other when they returned to their quarters after
the nightly festivities. It was through a tent wall that Mirza Abu Dl-Hasan, the
Safavid Mulla Bashi, was heard foretelling evil of a family that would supersede
the Safavid. His punishment was so swift, it seems that Nadir had only been
awaiting a pretext. He was strangled the next day in the presence of Nadir and
the whole assembly.
None of the sources lack evidence of Nadir's awareness that the Safavids'
religious aura made usurpation hard to accomplish successfully. Mirza Mahdi
Khan lists the preliminary doctrinal stipulations which Nadir had drafted before
the question of the succession was discussed. He was aware of the Safavids' hold
over the land which they had made predominantly Shlci, even to the point of
uniting under their dispensation Sufi and other sects which had always risked
the charge of heterodoxy. He was aware of the menace to his own frontier
people which the religious rivalry between Shici and Sunni posed, when, for
example, he had failed to beat the Turks or to capture Baghdad, so that he had to

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
seek some form of workable relationship with these upholders of the Sunni
Order. He would precede his coronation, therefore, with the proclamation of a
new faith for Iran.
It was designed to remove the odium of Shah Ismacll I'S "heresy", the gift
which the first Safavid Shah had imposed on Iran, and aprincipal element inhis
dynasty's charismatic and chiliastic appeal to the Iranian people. When Nadir
promulgated the five points of his new Ja^fari Faith, he was careful to ensure that
an Ottoman Ambassador and members of other religions were present at the
assembly. Whatever else this CA1I Pasha was to witness at Chul-i Mughan, for
Nadir a most important part of the Ottoman envoy's programme would be
hearing the proclamation ofthe new religion. The coronation which followed
was the signal for All Pasha's departure, accompanied byan Embassy to the
Porte from Nadir, toconvey news tothe Sultan ofthe new sect's inauguration.
Iranians were recalled to the succession of those Imams ^//Muslims could revere
and who included Jacfar al-Sadiq. The new sect was tobe called the Jacfari and
Iranians were henceforth to abjure the Shfi practice of cursing the first three
Orthodox Caliphs, apractice hateful to the Sunnis. Since, inthe Kacba, the Four
Schools of Islam were represented by four pillars, Nadir claimed that a fifth
should stand forhis new ma^hab (doctrine). Iran was to have the privilege, in
common with Egypt and Syria, of nominating an Amir a/-Hajj, and Iranians
were to have the same status and protection onthe Mecca Pilgrimage as other
Muslims. No longer were Sunni peoples toarrogate tothemselves the rightof
holding Iranians in slavery on the grounds of their not being orthodox;
wherever either theOttoman or Iranian authorities found Iranians or others
wrongly subjected to theignominy of being bought andsold, they were to
manumit them. The two Powers, Ottoman andIranian, were henceforth to
accredit permanent ambassadors toeach other. The religious proclamation was
meant to serve more than one purpose, but that of easing relations with the Porte
was vital.
The testing of opinion among the assembled notables continued for more
than amonth. The summonses had gone out in November 1735 and the notables
began arriving inthe Mughan inJanuary 1736. The crowning took place after
three weeks which must have left the multitude in a state of considerable
apprehension; Kazim mentions notables being hauled before Nadir for the
ordeal oftestifying totheir allegiance with ahalter round their necks. Not even
his boon companions were exempt from suspicious probing. He was desperately
anxious to forestall future rebellion and eradicate lingering pro-Safavid senti
ment by any means. Cajolery was not lacking. Neither were reminders, includ
ing theexecution of the Mulla Bashi, of how disloyalty would be punished.

NADIR SHAH (i 736—47)
Eventually the uncertainty was over. The offer to retire, now that the work of
cleansing Iran of enemies was finished, was dropped. It had met with pleading
that Nadir's firm hand should not be withdrawn from Iran's protection. Twelve
days before the Vernal Equinox, the Iranian New Year, the coronation rite was
performed and all prostrated themselves before the new king.
The terrible example of Nadir's extermination of the brave Bakhtiyarl rebel,
cAli Murad Khan, later in the same year illustrates how, whatever Nadir's own
origins, his by then royal government saw fit to chastise a tribal dissident. But he
did not make it a universal policy to "replace hereditary chiefs with local
governors". In the delegation of governorships his policy seems to have been
entirely one of expediency and therefore flexibility. For him expediency did,
however, dictate the pattern which began to emerge as rebellions increased.
Often in earlier days he had reinstated local governors after vanquishing them.
This especially applied where Afghans were concerned, as in Herat, and was to
be a feature of his methods in northern India. Later, as the case of Muhammad
Riza Khan Khurasani's appointment to Erivan shows, he began to favour
appointments of men close to himself, but for places remote from their own
hereditary ties. They were not to be influenced by local loyalties, since Nadir
required them to observe only one loyalty. The case of Taqi Khan Shirazi
exemplifies a combination of this need and his quest for money, for while Taqi
Khan was one of the wealthiest men in Shiraz, he was of humble and despised
origin, the son of a controller of water distribution who, as an agent of the chief
revenue official, amassed riches in proportion to the antipathy he gained from
the people he taxed. Thus Nadir could see Taqi Khan as one of the moneyed class
of Shiraz and yet owing that class no love: he was considered that class's enemy,
as Mlrza Muhammad Kalan tar's description of him makes clear; and as ready to
throw in his lot with Nadir as Nadir was ready to employ such a potentially
useful man, who knew where money was to be found.
Nadir's subsequent visit to Isfahan, begun on 15 October 1736, was consider
ably taken up with financial matters: he was raising funds for the next major task,
the campaign to Qandahar, the prelude to the conquest of India. He was now
master in his own house with the regalia to prove it. He could establish his own
rules of service for officers and men. Before setting out for Qandahar, besides
giving senior officers costly gifts, he fixed troopers' (gha^iyan) pay (mavajib)at
twelve tumans and their bonus (irfam) at the same. The Mm Bashis were to
receive sums varying from a thousand tumans to five hundred, and at the lowest
level, a hundred and fifty. He planned a three-year expedition, mainly financed
through Isfahan, whose guilds contributed two million tumans.
Meanwhile Nadir's eldest son, Riza Qull, was raising a force for a campaign

to Balkh on funds raised in Mashhad. Nadir had been right to confide, when
hesitating about assuming the crown, that there were many whose loyalty might
be doubtful and whose lives he had impoverished while striving toclear Iran of
foreign invaders. But to campaign in India would mean the removal of his costly
and voracious army from his harassed subjects' immediate vicinity. It wouldbe
led where successes might show the people of Isfahan that their enforced
investment had not been made unprofitably. Unfortunately, however, if such a
profit were to accrue, Nadir had already taught his people so severe alesson that
capital would in future be kept as far from the prying eyes of government as
possible. Atthe same time, ashis soldiers became increasingly actuated by the
desire for loot, the cost of paying them increased: Nadir had to pay more in order
to counteract their temptation tohold onto spoils. Apart from the danger to the
army occasioned bytroops breaking ranks in pursuit of booty, hewantedthe
spoils of war exclusively for himself and for theexpenses of government.
He set out on 21 November with 80,000 men andcrossed the Sistani
Qandahar border on 3 February 1737. The siege ofQandahar began and, as if to
demonstrate that Qandahar was only intended to bethe base fora far greater
expedition, on 11 May he sent Muhammad Khan Turkmen to the Mughul
Court, to bring forward thecharge that the Indians had failed to prevent the
flight into safety, of Afghan refugees from Iran.
The siege of Qandahar lasted long enough to prove that sieges were never
Nadir's happiest military experiences. At Ganja he had only succeeded with the
help ofRussian engineers disguised asIranians. Qandahar again showed what
mud walls and bastions were capable of withstanding when assaulted by an army
deficient in engineering techniques. The city did not succumb until March 1738.
Husain ofQandahar was sent with his people toMazandaran. His city was left
deserted, tomake way for anew one of Nadir's own creation, Nadirabad. On21
May heleft forGhazna. He had, asit happened in vain, urged on Muhammad
Shah the return of his ambassador. He now crossed into Mughul territory on the
pretext that it behoved Muhammad Shah to punish theAfghan fugitives.
This excuse isinteresting. It,ofcourse, illustrates Nadir's skill and foresight
in having earlier developed a diplomatic gambit, to beactivated whenever it
suited him. His first communication, itwill be remembered, with Delhi, after the
expulsion ofthe Afghans, had been toask that India be closed tothem. He had
kept this issue alive. He now used it injustification of his Indian expedition; but
he justified this hostile actas if, in hiseyes, it were nothostile. Heused the
pretext ofthe Afghans having been received inIndia toadmonish Muhammad
Shah in a patronizing manner forincompetence innot dealing effectively with

the refugee problem. He claimed that he wasvirtually compelled to enter the
Mughul's realms, todoforthe emperor what Muhammad had proved incapable
of doing for himself.
Paramount rulers inIran tryto ensure that states bordering it donotbecome
scenes of disorder and sanctuaries for malcontents whomight threaten Iran's
security. Nadir's style ofaddressing himself to Muhammad Shah reveals that he
saw theissue in these terms; or at least wished theIndians to think he did.The
campaign was made to seem asif it were undertaken because of Delhi's inability
to keep its own affairs in order; themanner in which Nadir was received by the
notables in Ghazna and Kabul probably lent credence tothis view. The Mughul
officials ran away, but local dignitaries, who could not escape soeasily from their
homes, welcomed Nadir. They included members of the commercial classes.
Nadir no doubt promised more efficacious government than distant Delhi could
offer. When theconquest had been completed, theconqueror would be entitled
to recompense for his trouble. Nadir seems to have adhered to this opinion
throughout his dealings with theMughul Emperor. Never more sothan when,
with due pomp, he reinstated that unfortunate man, whoas a descendant of
Timur heclaimed asa kinsman, after his own refusal ofthe throne. This actwas
Nadir's last before he left Delhi, a city which he had rigorously despoiled.
The progress into India was marred bybad news from northwest Iran which
showed how insubstantial Nadir's gains inthe Caucasus had been. In December
1738 heheard ofhis brother's assassination at the hands ofthe Lezgis, who were
to remain Nadir's most implacable enemies to theend. He appointed a fellow
clansman in Ibrahim's place andgave hima Bughairi khan as Commander-in
Chief. On 7November, at Jalalabad, just before heentered metropolitan India,
Nadir appointed Riza Qull his Viceroy in Iran. On 6 January 1739 Nadir left
Peshawar for Lahore.
The long delay before Qandahar had been involuntary, but the leisurely pace
of the march, from May to December, through Afghanistan to Peshawar was
now accelerated. AtLahore, thegovernor gave Nadir twenty lakhs of rupees in
gold after surrendering the city. Nadir left him in his governorship and also
reinstated Nasir Khan as subadar ofKabul and Peshawar, with orders that hewas
to secure shipping andhold thePunjab river-crossings in readiness for Nadir's
return march. As if already in charge of the Mughul's northern provinces, he
reappointed a disgraced governor, Fakhr al-Daula, to Kashmir. Lahore was
behind theadvancing host by 6 February andon the 24February thebattle of
Karnal was fought. Khan Dauran, one of Muhammad Shah's principal officers,
was mortally wounded and the next day it was the Nizam al-Mulk who arrived to

negotiate. It was agreed that Nadir should return toIran with an indemnity of
fifty lakhs, tobe paid ininstalments. On 26 February Muhammad Shah paid his
first visit. Hecame again on 7 March and was then kept as Nadir's enforced
guest. The delay in these proceedings gave Nadir the chance to ascertain that he
need fear no resistance on entering Delhi, and to make certain of this by keeping
the Mughul army outside the city while hesurrounded their ill-sited camp in
such a way that it became entirely dependent on him for food supplies.
On 9 March Tahmasp Khan Jalayir was sent with the subadar ofAwadh into
the city. Nadir and the Emperor moved tothe vicinity of Delhi three days later.
After resting in the Shalimar Bagh, Nadir prepared to make his state entry on 20
March. The next day the khutba was read and coins were minted in his name, just
over three years since the date of his accession to the Iranian throne had been
signalled inthe legend al-khairfi ma waqda, "The best is what has taken place."
A witty but rash poet had changed this into la khairfi ma ivaqaTa^ "There is no
good in what has happened," a deed for which, Kazim says, Nadir wreaked
vengeance by having anumber of"Traqi", that is, central Iranian, poets put to
death.34
This day's events apparently proved too much forthe subadar of Awadh,
Sacadat Khan. He died, either from wounds sustained at Karnal orby suicide.
Mirza Mahdi Khan notes that a collector was sent forthwith to hisseat of
government, Lucknow, and brought back one crore in gold which, headds,
equalled five hundred thousand tumans inIranian money. Nadir was filling the
Delhi exchequer, to which heheld the key. Gifts and taxes from farand near,
Mirza Mahdi continues, were pouring in, tobe transferred toNadir tothe tune
of fifteen crores, but towards the close ofday on 21 March rumours spread in
Delhi that some mishap had befallen Nadir. Mobs began toattack parties of the
Qizilbash who were strolling in the streets. Corn-sellers were said to be involved
in the disturbances which now broke out, and certainly it was ontradespeople
and shopping areas, especially the jewellers' quarter, that the ruthless punish
ment Nadir ordered chiefly fell. On 22 March he supervised from the Raushan
al-Daula Mosque a punitive massacre and thesystematic looting of selected
quarters. By 27 March the auditors' accounts were sufficiently complete for him
to send instructions toIran exempting its provinces from taxes for three years.
He gave his soldiers arrears ofpay and gratuities said toequal six months' pay.
He now demanded the hand ofthe Emperor Aurangzib's great granddaughter
for his son, Nasr-Allah.

NADIR SHAH (i736-47)
There would be her dowry; the mulcting of Delhi was by no means at an end.
Some people were assessed as high as fifty percent for the levy Nadir's agents
and the kutval of Delhi, HajjT Fulad Khan, were ordered to raise. The city was
assessed at two crores and for the purpose of collection, divided into five
districts. Lockhart reckoned that on aggregate a value of 700,000,000 (70 crore)
of rupees was involved.35
Nasr-Allah's marriage took place on 6 April. By 12 May the business of
collecting and assessing had been accomplished. In a grand durbar on that day
Nadir restored Muhammad Shah to his much-impoverished realm. Four days
later he departed, to reach Kabul on 2 December where he recruited to his army
forty thousand Afghans. The long journey north had been slow and a quantity
of the loot lost at river-crossings. At river-crossings and in defiles, Nadir
apparently posted searchers in an effort to obtain as much as possible, especially
coin and jewels, of the plunder individual soldiers were trying to take back for
themselves. Nadir wanted the Indian conquest to provide him with funds. He
was not willing that India should fund private pockets in Iran or make his men
too rich for them to want to campaign any more; or, worse, rich enough to
finance rebellion.
Stationed at Kabul, Dira Ismacll Khan and finally Nadirabad from December
1739 to May 1740, Nadir concentrated on ensuring that his writ ran in the areas
adjacent to Iran's southeastern border. It was not until February 1740 that he
could bring the Kalhura chief from Sind, Miyan Nur Muhammad Khudayar
Khan, to heel. He then made this Khan disgorge treasures which included
former Safavid jewels the Khan had obtained from dispersed Qandahari
Ghilzais. Nadir gained over a crore's worth in valuables. Khudayar Khan
undertook to pay ten lakhs in tribute besides, and to provide two thousand
horses. At the end of this same February, Tahmasp II, Abbas III and his brother
Ismacil were put to death in Sabzavar, where the Safavid prisoners had been
gathered for this purpose.
While Nadir was engaged in Sind, Riza Qull continued to campaign in the
northern portion of Iran's eastern border, around Balkh and Andikhud. The
strategy for imposing Afsharid dominion over Andikhud was to intervene in a
local contest in support of one of the contending parties. He then established one
of them, cAziz Qull Dad Khan, as Governor of Andikhud and tackled the
reduction of Balkh against the background of this success. A major factor in the
area was the intervention of Qipchaq and Uzbek leaders from the other side of
35 L o c k h a r t , Nadir Shah, p . 152.

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
the Amu-Darya, the Oxus: the scene was already being set forNadir's sub
sequent crossing ofthe river, tocarry his arms into regions which succoured
northern Iran's most troublesome neighbours.
The Governor of Balkh, Abu Dl-Hasan Khan, was ready to submit, but not so
his ally, Sayyid Khan the Uzbek. Sayyid Khan resisted so stoutly that in the end a
price was put on his head. After one abortive attempt Balkh was finally gained
and held, and in the context of both its first and second and more durable
occupation, there is noteworthy evidence ofthe speed with which Riza Qull
restored the city's commercial prosperity. The interference from acrossthe
Amu-Darya, however, induced inRiza Qull the not entirely unwarranted idea
that to campaign towards Bukhara must be thenext move. Militarily this
decision might have been justifiable ifhe had possessed sufficient arms and had
been sufficiently prepared for so dangerous an undertaking in a region where the
tribes were adept at supplementing the natural hardships with Fabian tactics.
Tahmasp Khan Jalayir, whom Nadir had sent tosupervise his son's activities,
advised against what could only be seen asa foolhardy enterprise. Doubtless
Tahmasp also knew of Nadir's own plans for a campaign across the Amu-Darya,
and the preparations that he had already started for it. Riza Qull could not have
been ignorant of these plans either, but his impetuosity and perhaps a wish to be
before his father prevailed over Tahmasp's wiser counsels. This episode was
probably as much as anything else the first sowing of Nadir's suspicions against
his first-born. A jealous father saw inthis expedition the desire ofthe son to
outshine the parent whose most trusted lieutenant the son had disobeyed. When
Nadir reached Herat on 19 May 1740, heshowed his nephew, CA1I QulT, and
grandson, Shahrukh, marked favour. Meeting Riza Qull in Badghis on 26 June,
he disgraced him and disbanded his special corps of brightly-accoutred troops.
According to Kazim, Nadir also publicly reproached Riza Qull for the murder
of Shah Tahmasp and his offspring.
Nadir's long absence from southern Iran encouraged revolts amongthe
Arabs in the Gulf. In September, the Huwala Arabs mutinied and killed Nadir's
admiral, Mir CA1IKhan. Nadir's concern with naval operations has rightly been
cited asa novel policy for a great Iranian ruler, and asevidence ofa modern
outlook.36 He saw Iran asa distinct national entity. Its land and sea frontiers
required constant attention for the preservation of an integrity, the destruction
of which had, after all, set Nadir his initial task of reconstruction. Brought up in
a border region, frontiers excited his vigilance; throughout his career he was
36 Lockhart, "The navy of Nadir Shah".

NADIR SHAH (1736-47)
never many miles away from one or other of Iran's frontiers, if not campaigning
beyond. For naval operations, however, he was irksomely dependent on others:
on Arab seafarers, and on Captain Elton, as will be seen below, for skill in naval
construction, while he also used Indian shipbuilders. Once his admiral had been
slain, the Huwala Arabs lapsed into what has, perhaps loosely, been termed
piracy. Nadir had not yet finished with the Gulf, but his ultimate failure to
achieve its policing left that duty to a future non-Muslim power. In the autumn
of 1740 Nadir was in no position to arrest the collapse of his Persian Gulf
policies. Far better equipped than Riza Quli had been, he had to embark on an
expedition beyond the Amu-Darya, one which proved difficult even for such a
general as he. He had sent orders from India for preparation of shipping for the
river-crossing. This venture was as well planned and long-thought-out as all his
other expeditions.
By October Nadir had defeated Abu 31-Faiz Khan of Bukhara, whom he
reinstated, while careful to annex Charju, with its river-crossing, and all the
territory south of the Amu-Darya for himself. He was making the Amu-Darya
boundary secure and acquiring control of important bridgeheads. As usual,
when he was among distant peoples, he took advantage of success to recruit
fresh manpower, in this instance between twenty and thirty thousand Uzbeks.
He also arranged a marriage alliance. Tahmasp Khan, whom he had sent back to
Kabul, was now put in charge of the north Indian acquisitions. The Mughul was
not fulfilling his engagements and Nadir had to repeat his admonitions.
Apart from the kind of strategic arguments already advanced in the context
of the Uzbek borderlands, since Iran had become a Shici State there had been the
Central Asian rulers' belief in their right to enslave Iranian Shici captives. Khiva
was, and for a long time after Nadir remained, a chief offender: the lands of the
Khivan oasis were cultivated by Iranian slave-labour. Nadir had experienced
trouble from the ruler of Khiva, Ilbars Khan, before. The ruler of Shlrvan had
encouraged Ilbars to invade Khurasan when Nadir was engaged on his first
Caucasian campaign. When Nadir had turned his attention to Bukhara, Ilbars
had come to Abu Dl-Faiz Khan's aid against him. Khiva was the source of
troubles on the Khurasan border, the scene of Nadir's original home and first
training-ground. To campaign across the wastes of Khwarazm towards Khiva
was therefore inevitable, and when, in November 1740, Ilbars was finally forced
to sue for peace, Nadir gave no quarter. He had his and twenty of his
commanders' throats cut on the eve of entering Khiva, and Nadir released
Russian as well as numerous Iranian captives. The Iranians he sent to found a
township in the Darra Gaz district, Khlvaqabad. He left Tahir Beg in what was

to prove adisastrous governorship atKhiva, and in December hastened backto
Khurasan.
During the spring of 1741 Nadir resumed promotion of his naval pro
gramme. Ships ordered at great cost arrived in theGulf from Surat. Later,
timber for the building of more was transported across Iran to the Gulf from the
forests round theCaspian, a Herculean feat of porterage. But the reason for
Nadir's hasty return to the realm from which he had so long been absent was the
need to revisit areas inthe Caucasus where the Lezgis continued irrepressible.
He reached Mashhad in January 1741 andon 14March moved westwards
towards Azarbaijan. Thetax exemption granted from Delhi was illusory:
Nadir's unceasing and growing needs meant norelief for his subjects. On 15
May, as the Court marched through the Mazandaran forests, the guards and the
retinue were sufficiently strung out and the trees sufficiently thick for an attempt
to bemade onNadir's usually well-guarded person. The shot was fired in the
vicinity of Savad Kuh, but itonly slightly injured Nadir. Ithad afar worse effect
on his eldest son, against whom his rancour increased with time. The utmost
care was taken to apprehend the would-be assassin. Nadir's determination to
interrogate him was whetted by the conviction that Riza Qull had been
implicated in the attempt. It was only in July of this year that the physician,
Alavi Khan, obtained Nadir's permission to retire and goonthe Pilgrimage.
Many regretted this departure: Alavi Khan was one of the very few who could
help Nadir in what appears to have been increasing infirmities and, more
particularly, who could ameliorate the symptoms of what some saw as adisorder
of the mind.
Nadir remained inthe north-west from the summer of 1741 for over a year.
He then once more embarked onconquest across Iran's western border. The
seriousness of the situation in the Caucasus is shown by the size of the force with
which he penetrated into Daghistan in August 1741: 15 0,000 men. In October he
reached Darband and in January 1742 hedirected Taqi Khan Shirazi to go to
Bandar cAbbas toorganize the invasion ofOman; two more ships had arrived
from Sind. Naval matters did not escape his attention inrelation to the north.In
July 1742 he established apartnership with Elton in an attempt to break Russian
traders' monopoly onthe Caspian Sea and to obtain supplies fora Tabarsaran
campaign, from which he needed seaborne victuals. He captured Aq Qusha in
August, but bySeptember it was evident that the season would not hold long
enough forhim to penetrate into Avaria. In October hewithdrew to winter
quarters. During the winter respite he had an extremely unpleasant file toclose.
Nik Qadam, his assailant in the Mazandaran thicket, had been found and

NADIR SHAH (i 736-47)
brought to the royal camp during the summer. He was interrogated, and Nadir
considered that he had enough evidence to order Riza Quli's eyes to be put out.
In November Nadir again marched north. Meanwhile, Taqi Khan Shirazi had
taken the forts of Muscat and the son of one of Nadir's oldest companions-in
arms, Baba All Abivardi, Kalb CAH Khan, who was Governor of the southern
region known as the Garmsirat, was directed to cross to the Arabian side of the
Gulf, to oversee Bahrain and Taqi Khan's activities.
The idea that perhaps he should plunge into war with Russia was given up
when, early in 1743,ambassadors from the Porte made it clear that there was no
likelihood of the Sultan's recognizing the Jacfari Sect. The Turks had been
careful and protracted in their negotiations. They had every reason to be aware
of Nadir's power. They would also know the Persian saying that, the greater a
man's roof, the heavier the weight of snow on it. Nadir may have thought of
doing to the Ottoman capital what he had done to Delhi; as will be seen below,
he did in fact threaten this, but it does not seem likely that he believed he could.
The resources, not least in manpower, of the Ottoman Empire were depleted
but still considerable enough not to escape notice in Nadir's unceasing preoccu
pation with military recruitment and budgets.
At this time war would have been inconvenient to the Porte, but, while it was
not the Sultan who wished to play aggressor, the tragedy of the situation seems
to have been that neither did Nadir. Reiteration of the demand for recognition of
the Jacfari sect was generally accompanied by the explanation that, if the
religious difference could be resolved, the two neighbours could live in amity.
To achieve this seems to have been Nadir's overriding objective, but not at the
cost of ceding to the Turks territory they had snatched from Iran in enmity to the
Safavids or after the Safavid's fall; nor at the cost of neglecting to ensure the safe
passage of Iranians through Ottoman lands. He considered the Turks had taken
advantage of Ismacll the Safavid's "heresy" to wrest from Iran the regions of
Ardalan (Kurdistan) and Azarbaljan, to which they had no right, a point
specifically mentioned in the Peace Treaty he and the Sultan eventually con
cluded. Provided, however, these matters could be adjusted, he desired only
peace with the Turks. Peace in the west would be particularly valuable if, as
seems likely, the settlement of Khiva and Bukhara were among his aims. His
sense of belonging to the world and heritage of TImur was well as his upbring
ing made Central Asian problems very real to him, and he knew from experience
where the main threat to Khurasan's prosperity lay. It is at the end of a section
dealing with how, during the year 1158/1745—6, Nadir had once again been
urging on the Sultan his wish for Iran and Turkey to be friends, that MIrza

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
Mahdi Khan introduces the arrival of ambassadors from Khotan. They came, he
says, todiscuss the danger to his and their lands from the unsettled condition of
Turkistan. They pressed for a clearly defined border between Nadir's sphere of
influence in that region and dominions further to theeast.37
Although disinclined tocontinue conflict, the Ottoman government, which
had its own serious fiscal and economic problems,38 was wary of the strong ruler
who had restored Iran's power. They therefore tried tocontain this new power
by the indirect means ofpromoting the Lezgis' guerrilla tactics against Nadir
and his deputies. Meanwhile they temporized, as in the embassy of January 1742,
when nothing was conceded or demanded. Nadir disliked this negativeap
proach and threatened to visit the Sultan in person to settle the religious
question. Although Mirza Mahdi Khan, almost as if it were one ofthe signsof
Nadir's growing mental disorder, says that he really did envisage acampaignas
far as the Bosphorus, Nadir went no further and the next year the Porte's attitude
was far more categorical. Nadir's claim that the Jacfari rite should be given status
in the Kacba atMecca was finally rejected. There had been changes of ministers
in theOttoman Court, butit is also possible that the effects of the Caucasian
diversions on Nadir's plans were becoming apparent; Istanbul never lacked
intelligence agents in that region or in the Central Asian Khanates, where
Nadir's control was far from complete.
Nadir responded to the 1743 Embassy in avery positive fashion. He appeared
before Kirkuk on 5August with aforce of over 3 00,000.39 Success atKirkuk left
Mosul the next target. Itssiege began on 14 September but was lifted a month
later because reports reaching Nadir discouraged a stalemate beyond Iran's
western border; the way Nadir had toexercise and uphold his power demanded
mobility, and he knew thedangers of being delayed in one area toolong.
Tahir Begat Khiva had been murdered, but Nadir's operations on the
western marches were more urgently jeopardized by the revolt in Shirvan, led by
a pseudo-Safavid pretender called Sam Mirza and adherents whoincluded
Muhammad, the son ofSurkha3!. Sam's claim to be one ofShah Sultan Husain's
numerous offspring is not borne out by the texts, but he had earlier engineered a
movement at Ardabll where Nadir's nephew, Ibrahim, had seized him, cutoff
his nose and sent him on his way. The Mirza had gone into Daghistan. Joined by
enemies ofNadir, he and Muhammad Surkha3! had surprised and killed Haidar
Khan, the Governor ofShirvan, and Nadir was obliged to depute his command
ers from Tabriz, Urmiya and Ganja to contain the rebellion. The rebels were

NADIR SHAH (1736-47)
defeated in December 1743 near Shamakhl, but Sam escaped, to infiltrate a
disaffected group in northern Georgia. Nadir's Georgian vassals, Tahmuras
(Taimuraz II of Kakheti) and his son, Erekle, were then still loyal. They put
down this movement at the end of December and captured Sam Mirza. When
they brought him to Nadir, they were rewarded with Kartli and Kakheti for this
and other services. Since Nadir was by this time aware of another pseudo
Safavid prince being groomed by the Turks at Qars (Kars) to enter Iran and
cause him further distraction, he deprived Sam Mirza of one eye but left him the
other, and contemptuously sent him to Ahmad Pasha at Qars so that the
"spurious brothers might see each other".40
This second Ottoman-supported pretender was Muhammad cAli Rafsanjani
who had appeared in 1729 at Shushtar in the guise of Safi Mirza, claiming to be
Shah Sultan Husain's second son, although most authorities concur that Safi
Mirza was put to death by Mahmud Ghilzai when he massacred all the Safavid
family save the deposed Shah and two young princes in February 1725.
Muhammad Kazim is at variance with others when he makes the genuine Safi
Mirza escape with his brother Tahmasp from Isfahan on 2 June 1722, and says
that this real prince raised the Lurs against the Turks at Hamadan and
Kirmanshah so successfully that the Lur chiefs began to fear his ascendancy and
had him murdered in the bath in 1727. Muhammad Kazim is alone in suggesting
that this, the first of three "pretenders", was who he claimed to be. A third "Safi
Mirza" was supported by the people of Khalllabad and their apparently naive
leader, Muhammad Husain Khan Bakhtiyarl. This pretender had formally to be
denounced by Shah Tahmasp and Nadir, so formidable had he become in the
region of the Kuhglluya. He was put to death in early autumn, 1727.
Muhammad CA1IRafsanjani, also based on Shushtar, was able to make his escape
to the Ottoman authorities in Baghdad, by whom he was kept, to be used when
Nadir threatened Mosul. Nadir remonstrated with Ahmad Pasha about this
hostile promotion of a fictitious Safavid pretender and this second "Safi Mirza"
died some twelve months later; Sam Mirza lived to see yet another day.
These were not Nadir's only problems: by January 1744 TaqI Khan ShlrazI
was in open rebellion in Fars, having had Kalb CA1I Khan murdered. He had
landed at Bandar cAbbas from Muscat and marched on Shiraz, diverting his
attention from Fasa and other districts, whose revenues he had designed to pre
empt, so that he could reach Shiraz and foil an attempt by Nadir's lieutenants to
secure the city before he did. Nadir directed extra forces against Shiraz, but to no

avail. Taqi Khan held out for four months, with the help of Qizilbash elements
within the beleaguered city. Nadir sent no less aperson than Mirza Muhammad
cAli, the Sadr al-Mamalik, with a promise of safe conduct if Taqi Khan would
capitulate. He refused and inthe end Shiraz was surrendered, tobe sopillaged
and ruined byUzbek, Afghan and Turkmen troops that the Kalantar, aneye
witness, says worse had not happened since the days of Chingiz Khan, the worst
impact of whose depredations Shiraz, in fact, escaped. Taqi Khan, for whose
obduracy many in Shiraz blamed the desecration of their city, survived to servea
new dynasty in Afghanistan.
Also inJanuary 1744, Muhammad Hasan Khan Qajar, the son ofFath cAli
Khan, brought in the Yamut Tiirkmens and disaffected Qajars among whom he
had been living inthe deserts beyond Astarabad, and seized that place from its
Governor, Zaman Khan. Nadir had toorder Bihbud Khan Chapshalu from the
Atak region ofnortheastern Khurasan togo and regain the city, which Bihbud
managed to do once some of Muhammad Hasan's Qajars defected to him.
Muhammad Hasan Khan in the end retired to those same deserts whence he had
come, and where heremained until after Nadir's death.
In July 1744, after he had appointed Nasr-Allah, his son, to Shirvan and these
disorders had been contained, Nadir resumed the Turkish war. He laid siegeto
Qars but at the onset of a peculiarly severe winter, the siege was raised after
diplomatic exchanges. Nadir remained in theregion during thecold season
which was such that Mirza Mahdi Khan says that the water in afish's belly would
have frozen.41 The Lezgls thought that they were immune in such weather to
attack from Nadir. They once more learnt thecontrary and, after chastising
them, he received and forgave them in January 1745, before he went to
Darband.
He spent the next spring near Shamakhi, but, when the army moved towards
Erivan, Nadir was so ill that for part of the way he had totravel ina takht-ravan
(litter), although he recovered his health sufficiently for this only to bea
temporary expedient. At about this time he entrusted Khurasan to his son Imam
QulT, and cIraq — the central region of Iran — to hisnephew, Ibrahim Khan.
During the last days, as his distrust of everybody grew, he increasingly selected
his deputies from close kin and fellow clansmen. InAugust 1745 he engaged the
Ottomans forthe last time, inthe person ofYegen Muhammad. He cut off his
supplies bysurrounding his army at a place not far from Erivan, near where

NADIR SHAH (I 73 6-47)
cAbd-Allah Pasha Kiipriilii had been killed in one of Nadir's first successful
encounters with Turkish generals. Yegen Pasha's death left his men leaderless
and at Nadir's mercy. Besides heavy slaughter, many were taken prisoner. Nadir
had the opportunity of exercising what in the light of the next move must be
considered diplomatic clemency: he released the weak and wounded and gave
them safe conduct back to Qars. Of the remainder, some four thousand, Mahdi
Khan says, were sent to Tehran while others were settled in Tabriz. This success
was followed by peace proposals and the treaty which at last brought Nadir's
warfare with the Porte to an end.
In the meanwhile All Quli Khan, the son of Nadir's brother, Ibrahim, and
the favoured nephew, had been sent to Khwarazm, where the Yamut Tiirkmens
had taken advantage of the collapse of Nadir's arrangements, to raid the Khivan
oasis. All Quli had driven them off, but in their flight they had simply been
forced to return to the region of Astarabad. Nadir enlisted a legion of their best
young men in his own bodyguard and had others punished for their bad
behaviour. He reached Isfahan and in February 1746 returned to Mashhad. In
the spring season he made a short visit to Kalat where he inspected the cash and
jewels he had stored there. Then he went back to AzarbaTjan and at Saiij Bulagh
met the Ottoman envoy, Nazif Effendi, to discuss peace. The preliminaries were
followed by an exchange of gifts. Nadir's gift to the Sultan included a dancing
elephant from India.
The Treaty was concluded in January 1747. Its terms contained no reference
to the Jacfari Rite, but reference was made more than once to the status and
protection of Iranian pilgrims and other Iranian travellers through Ottoman
dominions, now that the Shici practice of cursing the first three Caliphs of Islam
had been prohibited in Iran. The frontiers between the two realms, which had
been impaired by the Turks on account of Shah IsmacIPs having "incited" them
to war, were to be recognized in the form in which Nadir had left them. Each
party was to refrain from aggression and peace was to be perpetual. Pilgrims
both from Iran and Central Asia ("Turan") passing by way of Baghdad and Syria
were to be given every protection and facility. The two states were to furnish
each other's envoys with their expenses. Captives were to be exchanged and
frontier governors enjoined not to commit unfriendly acts. Pilgrims, whether to
Mecca or the Holy Places in Mesopotamia, the Atabat Aliyat, were not to be
charged dues contrary to the laws of the Faith unless they were carrying
merchandise. If they were, they, in common with regular merchants, were only
to be charged the lawful amounts and no more.

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
The conclusion ofthis peace was opportune forNadir. In March 1746 Fath
cAli Khan "KayanI" ofSistan had rebelled when asked for more revenue than he
could raise. Mirza Mahdl Khan, whose text forthese last days, except in those
portions where Kazim's issingled out, isclosely parallel tothat of Muhammad
Kazim, ascribes the decline inNadir's character tothe anguish he suffered after
blinding Riza Quli Khan; although the episode ofthe attempted assassination,
which became the pretext for this deed, is also seen as asign that Nadir's attitude
towards his subjects hadchanged for theworse. Nolonger benign towards
them, they nolonger looked onhim with gratitude. Instead, rebellion became
commonplace; Taqi Khan's in Shiraz; that of Fath CA1I Khan Qajar's son,
Muhammad Hasan, in Astarabad; the revolt in Shirvan, where the people had
murdered Nadir's governor, Haidar Khan Afshar, and replaced him by
Muhammad, thesonof Surkha°i Lezgi.
Mirza Mahdl Khan says that these events only served to inflame Nadir's
rancour ata time when his conduct "had fallen from the natural order, and the
way of compassion was shut".42 As if he knew the endwas near, and was
determined to collect andhoard as much wealth as he could, his thirst for
revenue became the driving-force in acareer of astonishing cruelty. The country
was terrorized andruined by his tax officials who, when the Shah reached
Mashhad for the last time, were in their turn terrorized. They had to render their
accounts under torture and were then paid for their services with death.
CA1IQuli Khan, Nadir's nephew, and Tahmasp Khan Jalayir had been sentto
quell therising of Fath CA1I Khan in Sistan. In June 1746, on hisway from
Isfahan toKhurasan through Kirman and Yazd, Nadir himself had suppressed
risings in those regions, andhis progress left towers of skulls to mark the
manner in which this last great tax haul wasbeing conducted. TheSlstani
troubles proved less tractable. Fath CA1IKhan had been captured and killed, but
his rebellion wascontinued by his lieutenant, MirKuchik. Then, revenue
officials, either out of fear of Nadir or because they saw this as a means of
destroying his two favourites, charged CA1IQuli and Tahmasp Khan with owing
the Treasury sums they could notpossibly pay. CA1I Quli, aware of Nadir's
obsessive severity over revenue, knew that nobody could expect any quarter and
decided that theonly course of action was to revolt. At first Tahmasp Khan
sympathized with him but before long he found himself incapable ofdisloyalty
to the man whom he had so long served with such fidelity. He advised CA1I Quli
to desist, but CA1IQuli silenced this unwelcome counsel by poisoning its author.
He then went to Herat where he ensconced himself in April 1747.

NADIR SHAH (i 736-47)
Nadir was then at the end of his journey to Mashhad and embarking on the
inquisition of his collectors. Muhammad Kazim says that at this point, on his
arrival in Khurasan, he made what many students of Iranian history might see as
a classic error: he sent tax-gatherers among the Kurdish tribesmen, 140,000 of
whom, Kazim says, had assembled in the vicinity of Khabushan. Many of them
fled, but the Chamishgazak notables, who included Muhammad Jacfar Sultan
Zacfaranlu, Ibrahim Khan Kaivanlu, and Muhammad Riza Khan Badlu, decided
upon rebellion. Nadir, therefore, had to march on Khabushan. Kazim reports
that he had sent his grandson, Shahrukh Mirza, to Kalat with an abundance of
treasure but that, realizing how every hand was turned against him except the
Afghan and Uzbek contingents in his army, who were the only ones he still
trusted, he himself wished to follow Shahrukh to that great fortress. He gave
orders for mounts to be prepared so that he and his family might leave during the
night, while the army was on the march to Khabushan. It seems an unlikely
story, but it is interesting because Kazim makes "Husain" (Hasan) All Beg, the
Mucaiyir Bashi, whose survival of the next events is remarkable, the agent by
whom Nadir was dissuaded from pursuing this plan of escape.
The royal concourse reached Fathabad, within two farsakhs of Khabushan,
on 10 Jumada 31-Ukhra 1160/30 June 1747 New Style. That night Nadir's guard
officers were Muhammad Beg Qajar-i ErivanI, Musa Beg Irlu3! Afshar Tarumi,
Qucha Beg Kavanduzlu3! Afshar Urumi and Husain Beg Shahvar. Mirza Mahdi
Khan says that it was on a signal from All Quli Khan, who in fact succeeded his
uncle as Adil Shah (1747—8), and with the connivance of Salih Khan Qiriqlu
Ablvardi and Muhammad Quli Khan Afshar Urumi, the Head of the Guards,
that in the night of 30 June—1 July 1747 these men entered Nadir's tent and
murdered him.
This is not the place to embark on a detailed discussion of the long-term
effects of Nadir Shah's campaigning beyond the frontiers of Iran. The next
section will furnish some indication of the results within Iran of his tumultuous
reign, and it could be argued that Russian penetration into the Caucasus and
eventual permanent acquisition, to the detriment of the Ottoman Empire, of the
Crimea were both partly consequences of his wars against the Porte and
expeditions in the Caucasus; it was in connection with one of the former that
Russia for the first time invaded the Crimea, upon contingents from which the
Sultan relied. Nadir's capture of Delhi and humiliation of the Mughul Em
peror certainly contributed to the ultimate displacement of the last vestiges of
Mughul power in the sub-continent.

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
THE AFSHARID LEGACY
When Nadir moved tribes from the grounds with which they were historically
associated, he seems to have had four main motives. Strengthening the frontiers,
generally taken asone ofthe Safavid rulers' motives fortransplanting tribes,43
does not seem tohave been offirst importance toNadir, whose settlements did
not always comprise people from other Iranian regions; he settled captives from
Khiva inKhurasan, forexample. One motive was certainly related tomeansof
preserving his power. By moving rebellious Bakhtiyarls from their traditional
strongholds inthe fastnesses ofthe Zarda Kuh, hedissociated them from their
traditional power-bases. That such movements were predominantly to
Khurasan reveals twoother possible motives: the desire to make his home
province more prosperous by increasing its pastoral population; and perhaps the
calculation that, infiltrated bygroups lacking strategically useful local knowl
edge and contacts, potentially troublesome tribes already established in
Khurasan would find it harder toconfederate against him. Inthe first context it
has to be said that like Riza Shah (1925—41) Nadir never forgot whence he
originated. Similarly Riza Shah paid special attention to theprosperity of his
native Mazandaran. Inthe second context, Nadir, with a sense ofshifting tribal
allegiances asastute asin his circumstances it was necessary, nodoubt consid
ered theintroduction of captive diluting elements attractive.
Speculation about his possible fourth motive arises from the tribesmen's
need and regard for urban centres, to which to purvey pastoral productsand
whence to obtain manufactured goods, notleast arms and accoutrements; and
from Nadir's ownconcern to acquire the wealth concentrated in cities as
commercial and manufacturing emporia. At Qandahar he constructed
Nadirabad. A city was planned for Kalat. The Khivan captives were to be settled
in thenew township of Khivaqabad.
Acquisition of wealth was requisite for the retention of power. No loyalty
was given freely. So completely did Nadir submit toand promote the mercenary
principle that, while therumour as well as thereality of his hoarded treasure
caused Khurasan years of distraction following hisdeath, thehabit of freely
given patriotic service in Iran tended to become the exception rather thanthe
rule. This legacy, inthe absence ofany dynasty capable ofinspiring the loyalty

THE AFSHARID LEGACY
once given to the Safavids, remained in the 19th century to bedeplored by
Europeans as much as to be exploited by them; although it must be said that once
Iran's status as a"buffer state" became an Anglo-Russian aim, efforts were made
by both these powers toensure a stable succession toits throne.
As for the Safavid aura, its pervasiveness and habitation in men's minds made
its latent threat to Nadir's dominion difficult to eliminate, especially when
it manifested itself in fictitious pretenders used by Nadir's enemies to embarrass
him. A device he tried against conservative clinging to a power which many saw
as the only legitimate sovereignty, was that ofdemanding, on the eve ofhis
coronation, signed and sealed declarations of fealty tohimself and his descen
dants. Of the latter, the one who continued a greatly reduced and weakened
Afsharid rule for some forty-six years owed the possibility of doing so not least
to Safavid descent through his mother. Nadir, with no such advantage, needed
recourse to countering fears of his subjects' lack of loyalty by making them more
afraid of him than he was of them. As his reign of terror worsened, desertions
from his army, which no one dared report tohim, increased. Contemporary
annalists marvelled at how aregime founded on such ascheme of terror and so
degraded could endure as long as itdid. There are, however, other examples in
modern Iranian history of the Iranians' capacity for patient endurance of
prolonged periods of harsh rule. From Nadir's excesses one man inhis camp,
Ahmad Khan Saduzai Abdall, appears to have learnt alesson. As Ahmad Shah
(1747—73), the founder ofthe Durrani dynasty ofAfghanistan, he exercised a
policy ofoften sorely tried but seldom withheld clemency.
It is thehistorian of Ahmad Shah Durrani, Mahmud al-Husaini, who
emphasizes that, afraid ofthe influence ofmen who might have been seenas
legitimate leaders, Nadir conferred leadership onmembers of tribes of low
standing.44 He promoted those who, recognizing in him the sole source of their
advancement, would be least likely to defect. Yet such men were among those
who plotted his assassination.
Nadir gave ample evidence of being too shrewd not to perceive the failure of
his stratagems to secure perfect hegemony. Mirza Mahdi Khan and particularly
Muhammad Kazim attribute his later, as they saw it, mental disorder to anguish
after he had ordered the blinding of his first-born son. Mahmud al-Husaini, the
servant ofAhmad Shah Durrani, Shahrukh Shah Afshar's protector, ascribes
what he terms Nadir's melancholia {matikhuliya) and distempered humour
(saudcf) to a different cause: his failure to subdue the Lezgis of Daghistan who

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
had slain his brother, Ibrahim. No doubt all these three observers of the horrors
of Nadir's last years felt compelled to explain his conduct as insanity: the mind of
a great man had become unhinged.
Yet when the barrenness ofthe efforts ofa life-time ofunremitting serviceis
considered, it isperhaps not surprising that the increasing violence and cruelty
of Nadir's later conduct were such that people attributed them to madness. If,
towards theend, he realized how hisvast ambitions hadfoundered, despair
enough to induce madness might have gripped him. His endeavours had proved
unavailing. Baghdad and Erzerum had eluded his grasp. Ottoman pashas were
still entrenched there. Predators from Turkistan still raided Khurasan. Iranians,
among them some of those who had been most in his confidence, found courage
to rebel against him. He had gained no lasting dominion ineither the Caucasus
or Transcaspia, both thescenes of some of his most extraordinary as well as
gruelling marches. In Iran hehad once been welcomed bythe mercantile and
sedentary elements of the population as aguarantor ofsafety from invaders and
marauders. In theend, these people must have found it hard to distinguish
between Afshars and the Ghilzais from Afghanistan whom Nadir had expelled.
Nadir failed to establish Afsharid, just as Timur had failed to consolidate
Timurid rule.
One indication of Nadir's failure was the need forty-eight years later for Agha
Muhammad Khan Qajar to reconquer theCaucasian cities which Nadirhad
regarded as focal centres in Iran's north-western defences: Tiflis, Ganja and
Erivan. Nadir also saw Marv as the key tothe north-eastern defences. Beyond
Marv he tried, as he played on afancied common Mughul—Timurid ancestry,to
secure as his vassal the ruler of Bukhara, and as his ally in the pacification of those
Turkmen raiders so familiar toNadir from his early youth and later as support
ers of the Qajars of Astarabad. More than this, his,and after him, Agha
Muhammad Khan Qajar's attitude towards Bukhara was irredentist. At the end
of the First World War what was considered the repossession of Bukhara was an
aspiration expressed byIranian diplomats at the time ofthe Versailles Confer
ence. Nadir may even have thought that, ifonly the Ottoman power in the west
could be contained, he might make Bukhara abase for conquests further afield in
Central Asia. His immediate successor, cAdil Shah, entertained the idea of
embarking on campaigns across theAmii-Darya, theRiver Oxus, in spite of
complete inability to undertake them. Mirza Mahdi's mention ofenvoys from
Khotan has already been alluded to,45 and Muhammad Kazim reports rumours,

THE AFSHARID LEGACY
brought by merchants, that China viewed Nadir's power with apprehension.
Muhammad Kazim wasconcerned with Central Asian affairs because he origi
nated from thecity of Marv. He goes into more detail than MIrza Mahdi Khan
about Nadir's despatch of artisans to Marv to prepare for a campaign into
Kashgaria. Such an expedition did not materialize, but Nadir frequently sent
men andmoney to Marv in efforts to restore its prosperity and reconstruct its
dam, a task which defied all his engineers' endeavours. Marv did not become
prosperous and Khiva wasstill a prison for captive labourers from Iran in the
middle of the 19th century, when a mission went from Tehran to negotiate their
repatriation.46 TheRussians eventually achieved the pacification which Nadir,
saddled with an economy ruined under the later Safavids and their Afghan
supplanters, and not ultimately bettered by him, was unable to accomplish.
He tried to obviate theconsequences of the Safavid—Uzbek conflict thathad
arisen under the Shahs Tahmasp I and Abbas the Great. Hadhe succeeded in
obscuring the sectarian difference between the two sides of the border which
Safavid espousal of Shicism had brought into prominence, he might have
accomplished more in Transoxiana, butthis isdoubtful. The problem of general
economic recession in Central Asia, Iran and Asia Minor was deep-seated, and it
was coeval with Europe's maritime-based expansion. Nevertheless, the border
on which hehadreceived hisearly training might have become less contentious
but for twofactors he wasunable to control. Hisambition to create an Iranian
empire with itsfulcrum in thenortheast was frustrated byIran's ultimate refusal
to accept him, andbythepresence in thewest of the Ottoman Empire, which it
seems to have been Nadir's intention either to balance with anequally imposing
Iranian imperialism or at least to neutralize. There was anirony, which doesnot
appear to have escaped Nadir's notice, inhis and theOttomans' shared language
and ethnic origins; but his apparent distrust of his Persian-speaking subjects
surely stemmed from more than a sense of ethnic difference. The cases of Hasan
Khan, the Mucaiyir Bashi, and Muhammad Taqi Khan Shirazi stand out as
examples of his readiness to trust Iranians when he was convinced, notso much
of their loyalty, for that was a characteristic in which he hadlittle cause to place
his faith, butof their competence andenergy.47 Inefficiency andfeebleness were
not pleasing to this stern man.
Another frustrating factor for Nadir Shah lay in regional differences which
his policies, although in some instances aimed at diminishing them, combined to
promote. Safavid religious policy had been a unifying force. Nadir chose to

NADIR SHAH AND THE AFSHARID LEGACY
show contempt for it; the events in Iran of1979 may serve as reminders of the
danger inherent in flouting religious sensibilities. Meanwhile, the tribesmen
whom he had transplanted did not forget homelands which they returned to as
soon as they could. Iranians in the central and southern regions nurtured
resentment at what seemed a Khurasanian regime supported byUzbeks and
Afghans. Itwas also unpopular among the people on the shores of the Persian
Gulf and inAzarbaljan. The people ofShlraz, and ofShushtar in Khuzistan,
never wanted Nadir. The merchants of Tabriz, who once had, no doubt became
disillusioned. Isfahan andother cities paid a terrible price for his Indian
campaign. The response ofthe regions to Nadir's career developed into the
recrudescence of a regionalism that has frequently broken out on the removal of
strong rule and which inthis instance was encouraged by contention among
Nadir's heirs and former officers.
There is, however, aparadox here. Nadir could not accomplish the restora
tion ofTImur's ephemeral Central-Asian-Khurasanian imperium, ofwhich a
significant effect had been thesplitting of Iran into a western and eastern
division that was eventually healed by the Safavids. This chapter will conclude
with Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar's restoration of the province of Khurasan to
an Iran which ithad been his task again to reunify after the collapse of Nadir's
dominion had once more splintered it. Yet, notwithstanding Nadir's failure to
achieve unified and enduring sovereignty, and in spite of Iran's exhaustion and
disintegration after and before him, his expulsion of the Ghilzai Afghans and the
Ottoman Turks contributed a great deal to the final separate identity of Iran as a
modern national state. After Nadir and the interregnum which followed his
death, the Qajar revival ofthe unity which the Safavids had achieved again
became feasible: Central Asia had been lost, Afghanistan had become anational
entity on its own, Nadir had raided India but not retained it, and the Caucasus
was soon to beforfeited once and for all. These were all areas which Nadir
believed should render Iran allegiance and tribute. His inability to keep them in
tutelage made the eventual refashioning of a distinct Iranian state possible in a
manner which his preoccupation with trans-frontier campaigns might have
appeared to preclude.
Although some ofthe Safavid symbols that haunted Nadir were spurious,
toys exploited by unscrupulous leaders for purposes other than what they might
have stood for in the eyes of an oppressed and pious population, they should not
be overlooked. Nadir's annalists, not least those contemporary with him, paid
these phenomena a degree of attention which reveals more than personal

predilection or, in the instance of Marcashl, ancestral respect. As men who
belonged to the non-tribal and non-martial classes, these authors conferred on
real and false Safavid pretenders aplace in history as the representatives of an
Iranian need for unity, continuity, hierarchy and well-ordered government
sanctified by tradition.
At first Nadir won gratitude among many for appearing to have restored the
Safavid state and cleared Iran of invaders. Gratitude turned into dismay when he
tried to obfuscate the religious differences on which Iran's identity had come to
rest, and when his "Timurid" ambitions and consequent craving for conquest
blinded him to the country's need for peace and stability. Shaikh Hazln describes
an economy already ruined atthe very time when Nadir extended his internal
conquest of the usurping Afghans into aprogramme of costly foreign expedi
tions. India produced a weight of plunder, but forays into Daghistan and against
Baghdad, Mosul and Kirkuk were a drain without any tangible compensation.It
was his resumption of campaigns in these regions that put the finishing touches
to the picture of Nadir, not ashis country's benefactor, but asa ruler who
demanded increasingly excessive rewards forservices in which many of his
disillusioned subjects must have been unable tosee any purpose save Nadir's
own aggrandizement.
If to some he ultimately presented the image of, after all, simply a freebooter
from a remote part of Khurasan, the falseness ofsuch an image only makes it
more tragic. Not everyone failed to benefit from acareer which itis impossible
to treat with contempt: Ahmad Shah Durrani was shrewd enough to avoid
Nadir's mistakes. He did not embark on wars far from home which were beyond
the capacity of his economic base. But he followed Nadir's example in tapping
India to strengthen that base. Moreover, he was judicious enough to use
Iranians whom Nadir's occupation of Afghanistan had afforded a home there
while Nadir's tyranny made them prefer exile. It issignificant that during his
brief reign in Khurasan in 1750, Sulaiman II excused his inability to repel
Ahmad Shah Durrani's influence onthe grounds that to dosomight have
embarrassed an Iranian colony of "scribes and soldiers" in Kabul.48 Nadir had
sent Taqi Khan Shirazi toKabul as revenue collector after he had suppressed
this same official's rebellion inFars. After Nadir's assassination, until he died
some eight ornine years later, Taqi Khan continued inthe service of Ahmad
Shah Durrani. He assisted him as an intermediary in Khurasan and later resumed

charge of the Kabul revenues. Hedied in disgrace, buttheDurrani showed
compassion to his descendants in a family whose financial expertise made
condoning their faults expedient.
Muhammad Taql Khan Shirazi quarrelled with Nadir's kinsman, Kalb CA1T
Khan, when the latter had been sent tocollect Nadir's share ofthe commerceof
the Persian Gulf and, in particular, of the Bahrain pearl fisheries. Profits were
accruing which Taqi Khan had nodesire to relinquish. As master of Shlraz he
could intercept the southern riches before they reached his powerful patron, but
it was under the latter's aegis that Taql Khan enjoyed control over the southern
seaboard's economy. He was certainly abeneficiary ofNadir's rule. That he was
not alone in this appears evident from thetime and energy Nadir devoted to
extracting from his subjects the capital which they doubtless became the more
adept in concealing the more demanding Nadir's agents became. After the
Indian expedition, in spite of the searching of the baggage of the returning
troops, coins and precious objects must have found their wayinto private
hoards.49 Servants ofNadir must have known this, otherwise not even the most
sadistic and those most inawe ofNadir would have unremittingly continued to
try and extort what did not exist. Unfortunately, inreaction toNadir's extortion,
the tendency onthe part ofIranians who possessed capital to withhold knowl
edge ofit from the government was strengthened, topersist, tothe detriment of
Iran's economy, to modern times.
The revolts against Nadir were due toother factors besides disenchantment
with him. Notably, those least vulnerable to attack from Central Asia or Asia
Minor wanted toconserve their gains ona regional basis. Nadir's awarenessof
this may explain the route he chose for his last journey from Isfahan to Mashhad.
It may explain, ifit does not justify, his ruthless revenue demands onthe south
eastern cities of Yazd and Kirman. Various parts of Iran refused to repeat
sacrifices forwhatever schemes Nadir might have had for the safety and well
being ofthe whole. His crown lacked the legitimacy to which anappeal might
have elicited extremes of sacrifice further to those he had already been able to
compel. Inany case, the belief spread that Nadir was practising extortion forhis
own and his family's enrichment and to retain the loyalty of alien tribal
contingents from outside the pale of the Shica faith: Tiirkmens from over the
border, Afghans and Uzbeks.
Withdrawal of his Iranian subjects' trust forced him to rely more on these
people than hewas probably inclined to anyway. His preference forthem was

not new, but it became so obvious that his death seems certainly to have been
precipitated by apprehensions among the Iranians in his camp, of some move on
the part of his favoured forces against them. It also seems likely that the rumour
of his plan secretly to retire from the camp enlarged apprehensions of his
conduct. As soon as news of Nadir's murder was known in the camp, the
Afghans and Uzbeks took the offensive under Ahmad Khan Sadiizai Abdali, the
future Ahmad Shah Durrani. When the latter perceived that escape was his best
course, he led off his men with as much ordnance as he could acquire. Units of
Nadir's army stationed elsewhere dispersed, as did those which had been with
him near Khabiishan. This dispersal of the formidable Afsharid host augmented
the sufferings of the Iranian people which were their principal legacy from "the
last great Asiatic conqueror".

Immediately after Nadir's death, with celerity pointing to the possibility that he
might have been implicated in the murder, his nephew A.1I Qull Khan reached
Mashhad from Herat. Nadir's surviving sons were put to death, but of his
grandsons Shahrukh, aged 13, was spared and imprisoned in Mashhad. Nadir's
eldest son, Riza Quli's offspring, Shahrukh, had for his mother Fatima Sultan
Begum, a daughter of Shah Sultan Husain. Shahrukh's cousin, CA1IQull Khan,
is credited with the perception that the people might reject his sovereignty in
favour of that of an Afsharid of Safavid descent. Hence he spared Shahrukh's
life. All Qull was in fact proclaimed as Adil Shah two weeks after Nadir's death.
Besides the still rebellious Kurds of Khabushan, he had famine to contend with
in Khurasan. The hostile moves in Mazandaran of Hasan Khan Qajar and his
Goklen and Yamut Turkmen allies afforded cAdil Shah a pretext to march out of
the famine-stricken province into Mazandaran after a brief interlude of festivity
in Mashhad and boast of undertaking conquests further afield that he would
never be able to realize. His operations against Hasan Khan ended in the Qajar's
return to the yurts of his Turkmen allies, but Hasan Khan's young son,
Muhammad, was captured and owed to Adil Shah the castration whereby the
future Muhammad Shah Qajar became known as Agha, the eunuch.
Adil Shah had sent his brother, Ibrahim Khan, to secure Isfahan. This was a
mistake. He had thus endowed his brother with a base whence Ibrahim Khan
could compete with him for power. Adil Shah sent a Georgian ghulamy Suhrab,
to poison Ibrahim, but the latter was apprised of the plot and had Suhrab put to

death. Units of Nadir's army, from the Garmslrat in the far south and Kurdistan
in the west, on their way to Adil Shah found a new master inIbrahim Khan
before they reached Mashhad. Assured of these forces, Ibrahim Khan captured
Kirmanshah, which was looted, andcolluded with Nadir's governor in
Azarbaljan, Amir Asian Khan Qiriqlu, against cAdil Shah. Adil Shah met their
combined forces between Sultaniya and Zanjan and was put to flight, later to be
taken prisoner and blinded: his brief reign ended before the year of Nadir's death
had expired. Asian Khan was allowed totake the fallen Shah with him on his
return toAzarbaijan. Ibrahim later repented of this when he began tosuspect
that with Adil Shah Asian Khan might have gained access to aquantity of the
Afsharid treasure. Ibrahim therefore turned against his ally and defeated him
near Maragha. He had Asian Khan put to death, but his profession that for him
the only legitimate sovereign was Shahrukh was not credited in Khurasan,
which Ibrahim now hoped todominate. There the authorities refused tosend
him Shahrukh, towhom he expressed the desire tooffer fealty inperson, but
without distancing himself from his central Iranian base.
Instead, a combination of Kurdish, Turkmen and Bayat chiefs withthe
notables of Khurasan enthroned Shahrukh atMashhad in early October 1748.
The exercise of government was chiefly in thehands of these chiefs. By
December Ibrahim Khan declared himself Shah. A situation developed in which
Uzbeks, Afghans and Qajars based west of Khurasan were at war with the Kurds
and Turkmen based within it. Shahrukh was generous with treasure. The appeal
of his Safavid descent no doubt played a part in attracting deserters from
Ibrahim's army. Defeated near Simman, Ibrahim became a fugitive whom
Sayyid Muhammad, the mutavallt(custodian) of the shrine of the eighth Imam,
All Riza, at Mashhad, refused admission tothe shrine city of Qum.
Sayyid Muhammad's mother was adaughter of the Safavid Shah, Sulaiman I
(1666—1694). He had succeeded his father as mutavalll of the Mashhad shrine
and had co-operated in cAdil Shah's accession, but the latter had chosen notto
leave him behind in Mashhad and he had been present at Ibrahim Khan's defeat
of Adil Shah and had remained in central Iran. Shahrukh meanwhile was in the
hands of those chiefs who had been his original supporters, and their rivalsin
Khurasan, who included Alam Khan Khuzaima, and also Hasan Khan Qajar.
The latter had deserted Ibrahim Khan and joined Shahrukh under whomhe
received high office. Adil Shah had eventually been brought to Mashhad where
he had been put to death at the behest of Nadir Shah's widow, in revenge for his
murder of her sons, Nasr-Allah and Imam Qull, in the holocaust of Nadir's male
descendants atKalat which preceded Adil Shah's assumption ofsovereignty.

CADIL SHAH: SHAHRUKH SHAH: SULAIMAN II: SHAHRUKH SHAH
Ibrahim Khan was made captive and died, or was slain, when being brought to
Mashhad during Shahrukh's brief period of deposition in 1750.
Shahrukh's deposition resulted from a temporary alliance between cAlam
Khan cArab Khuzaima, who had succeeded in acquiring influence over the
Shah, and certain Kurdish and Jalariyid chiefs. These men conspired to assume
control of Khurasan, a project which they considered other chiefs in the Shah's
confidence, for example, Hasan Khan Qajar, would certainly obstruct. Two of
the latter, Qurban AITKhan Qajar and Qasim Khan Qajar, became aware of the
conspiracy but failed in their attempts to win Shahrukh. For the conspirators
had determined to establish Sayyid Muhammad as their own puppet sovereign,
in spite of Hasan Khan Qajar's admonition that if Shahrukh's government were
to be rendered ineffective, Ahmad Shah Durrani would enter Khurasan from
Afghanistan and perhaps threaten the whole of Iran. Sayyid Muhammad reigned
for a few months as Sulaiman II before he in his turn was deposed as a result of
the machinations of the chiefs and possibly because of his assiduity in attempting
to revive the revenues of Khurasan and improve their administration in order to
ameliorate the depressed economy. He was allowed to live out the rest of his life
near the shrine in Mashhad and died some thirteen years later. He had not been
held responsible for the blinding of Shahrukh, which occurred, probably when
someone had attempted to release Shahrukh from prison, while Sayyid
Muhammad, Sulaiman II, was absent from Mashhad.
Sayyid Muhammad was also blinded, but when opponents of Alam Khan
Arab Khuzaima removed him, Shahrukh's recent blinding did not hinder their
restoration of the latter to the throne. For his public audiences arrangements
were made whereby his infirmity was concealed. Shahrukh became dependent
on the support of the principal architect of his restoration, Yusuf All Khan
Jalayir, a kinsman of Nadir Shah's once faithful henchman, Tahmasp Khan the
Vakil. cAlam Khan cArab Khuzaima fled to his home-base in Qa°in. Once he
had lost the support of his fellow conspirators among the Kurdish khans, he was
powerless. He had recourse to Ahmad Shah Durrani, whom he visited when
Ahmad was investing Shahrukh's governor in Herat. Ahmad Shah Durrani
entered Khurasan and, whether or not on this occasion he thought of taking
advantage of the situation that was troubled by rival khans and their conflicting
tribal allegiances, this, the first of his three interventions, terminated in the
decision not to linger in Khurasan, during what was only the third year since he
had crowned himself in 1747 as Ahmad Shah, Durr-i-Durrani,"The Pearl of
Pearls", exchanging the cognomen Abdall for Durrani.
Ahmad Shah Durrani's policy towards Khurasan seems to have developed

into one of keeping that province ofIran under Shahrukh ashis protectorate,
and as abuffer state between his newly fashioned Afghan dominion and the rest
of Iran. With Khurasan, where on hisfirst intervention he had succeeded in
finding an appreciable number ofNadir Shah's jewels inKhabiishan, subservi
ent tohim, he was free topillage Delhi in 175 6, as apunishment for the Mughul
cAlamgir II'srecapture of Lahore. While he thus resisted thetemptation to
penetrate deeper into Iran, hemade it his purpose to prevent incursions from
central Iran into Khurasan, where he steadfastly guaranteed Shahrukh's throne.
It isa final irony ofthe Afsharid legacy that this former officer ofNadir's army
should have been able toform the Durrani kingdom ofAfghanistan out of the
eastern vestiges of Nadir's conquests, andmaintain the rule in Mashhad of
Nadir's grandson: the Afghan was loyal tothe last to his former master's heir.
Ahmad Shah's son, Timur Shah (1773—93) and his grandson, Zaman Shah
(1793—1800) had their concerns in India and Kashmir to occupy them, while
under Zaman Shah's short reign the Durrani monarchy was precipitated into
decline. Thus there was no help from that quarter when in 1796Agha
Muhammad Qajar took Mashhad without abattle and had Shahrukh tortured so
that he might reveal where, to the last gem, the remains of Nadir's treasures were
concealed. AtSimman, where his reign had opened with Ibrahim Khan's defeat
in 1750, the blind Shahrukh expired as he was being led away a captive. Atlast
the Qajar was master ofan Iran once more united under one paramount power,
for theother dynasty which might have stood in theway of complete Qajar
ascendancy over Iran, that of the Zands, had already been eliminated.

CHAPTER 2
THE ZAND DYNASTY
THE POWER STRUGGLE IN POST-NADIR IRAN
Scarcely any ofthe great conquerors ofhistory can have destroyed his life's work
quite socompletely as Nadir Shah did in the months before his death. His
unreasonable exactions and barbarous suppression ofthe ensuing provincial
revolts spread disaffection to every corner of his realms, andfinally brought his
own nephew, All Quli Khan, at the head ofa rebel army, tothe bordersof
Khurasan itself. His short-sighted favouritism towards his new Afghan and
Uzbek contingents, over his long-suffering Iranian officers and men,split his
own army irreparably and was the immediate cause ofhis assassination.
The morning after this event (11 Jumada II1160/1 July 1747 New Style),1his
heterogeneous army, encamped atKhabushan, rapidly disintegrated. The de
tested Afghans fought their way clear under Ahmad Khan Abdall, who, as
Ahmad Shah Durrani, later seized the eastern half ofNadir's domains; their
compatriots inthe Mashhad garrison were prudently allowed toretire bythe
governor andSuperintendent (mutavalti)of the shrine, MirSayyid Muhammad,
who from nowon wasto play an important role in the troubled politics of the
former capital. The bulk of the Iranian contingents, notably the Bakhtiyari
under CA1I Mardan Khan, struggled back toMashhad, and initially gave their
support to cAli Quli Khan who, with many promises and much largesse, was
enthroned as Adil Shah a few weeks later.
But the newruler soon disappointed many of his early adherents; he lacked
his uncle's imperious magnetism topull together the surviving elements of a
sprawling andexhausted empire. Instead of marching to secure the old Safavid
capital of Isfahan, he delegated control of the city to his brother, Ibrahim, and
remained at Mashhad to make merry, while hislarge unemployed army reduced
city and surroundings to near-famine, murmurs of discontent rising every
where. Late in 1747, CA1IMardan Khan sought permission to lead the Bakhtiyari
home, and was refused. The whole contingent nevertheless set off, routed a
pursuit force, and defiantly returned to theZagros ranges, where Ibrahim Mirza

THE ZAND DYNASTY
was already recruiting support from his Isfahan base to challenge his brother's
title.
The Bakhtiyarl were already aformidable force in Isfahan itself. Chief among
them was AbuDl-Fath Khan ofthe Haft Lang, whom Ibrahim left as his viceroy
in thecapital on setting outagainst Adil Shah in thespring of 1748.
Another Zagros tribal group which returned from Khurasan to their home
ranges at this time were theZand. A minor pastoral people wintering on the
Hamadan plains, centred onthe villages ofPar! and Kamazan inthe vicinityof
Malayir, they have been variously classified as Lurs and as Kurds: both Luri and
Kurdish-speaking groups bearing the name of Zand have been noted in recent
times, but the bulk ofthe evidence points totheir being one of the northern Lur
or Laktribes, who may originally have been immigrants of Kurdish origin.
They are, in any case, distinct from the Faill Lurs ofKhurramabad.2 They first
appeared during the anarchy consequent upon the Afghan invasion of the 1720s.
The Ottoman Turks had occupied Kirmanshah, but were constantly harassed by
a band of700 marauders based on Par! and Kamazan, led by Mahdi Khan Zand.
Their patriotic guerrilla war declined into brigandage when Nadir expelled the
Turks, and in 1732, he sent a force to punish them. Four hundred tribesmen
were put to the sword andthe tribal leaders anda considerable number of
families transported to northern Khurasan. Here, at Abivard and the valleyof
Darra Gaz, they remained in exile forthe next fifteen years, prey to Turkmen
raiders, while their khans and fighting men had to follow Nadir's train in endless
campaigns.
At the time of Nadir's murder, the Zands in Darra Gaz comprised some thirty
to forty families, and leadership in this exodus devolved upon Karim Beg, eldest
son ofInaq who, with his younger brother Budaq, had jointly ruled the tribe
before their exile. No record survives ofthe march home, which like that of CA1T
Mardan's Bakhtiyarl was most probably forbidden by Adil Shah; Karim Beg,
now entitled Karim Khan, is next seen in active competition with the other tribal
heads of Traq-i cAjam (western central Iran) who were carving outtheir own
principalities with thecalculated assistance of the more ambitious Ibrahim.
Karim's first major clash came when he rejected an alliance proposed by Mihr
All Khan Tekkelu ofHamadan. Twice defeated by the Zands, Mihr All called
in the help ofHasan CA1IKhan, the Vall ofArdalan (as the hereditary governor
of Iranian Kurdistan had been styled from Safavid times). For six weeks, the hit
and-run tactics ofthe Zand cavalry harassed the Kurds until arebellion at home

THE POWER-STRUGGLE IN POST-NADIR IRAN
forced the Vali to retire. Karlm was now joined by an erstwhile rival, Zakariya
Khan, who held Buriijird and Kazzaz, and by 2000 Qaraguzlu from the
Hamadan district. Together they marched south on Gulpaygan, a strategic point
on the road to Isfahan, which also marked the limit ofAll Mardan's expansion
towards the former capital since his return from Khurasan. Karim defeated a
Bakhtiyari force and took over Gulpaygan. However, he was forced to hurry
back immediately to meet another attack byMihr All Khan. This timehe
decisively defeated the Tekkelu and took Hamadan; but he had lost the initiative
in the south to CA1IMardan, who now seized Gulpaygan and prepared to besiege
Isfahan.
By early 1750, the fate of what had been Nadir's empire was largely settled.
Ibrahim Mirza had defeated and deposed his brother near Zanjan, in the summer
of 1748 and, ayear later, had himself been crushed near Simnan by the forces of
Nadir's only surviving grandchild, Shahrukh. Although blinded and tempor
arily deposed in1750 in favour of a Safavid claimant, Sayyid Muhammad, the
Superintendent of the shrine, Shahrukh was maintained on the throne of ruined
Khurasan by various coalitions of self-seeking warlords until his death atthe
hands of Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar in 1796. Neither he norSayyid
Muhammad, while briefly in power as Shah Sulaiman II, made any attemptto
restore Afsharid authority inwestern Iran which, with the return of its tribal
manpower from Nadir's army and the resurgence ofIsfahan asthe political
centre, was ready to reassert its position as the heartland of a restored Safavid
empire. Nadir's usurpation of the monarchy had outraged all classes except the
freebooters — increasingly Sunni Afghans and Uzbeks — upon whom he based his
power, and Isfahan, "half the world" to the Safavid Shah, had never reconciled
itself to being subordinate to Mashhad. Asthecentre of gravity shifted,
Khurasan, Nadir's strategic and political centre, found itself automatically
relegated to the status of an impoverished province peripheral to the divergent
halves of the last great Asiatic empire. To the east lay the expanding realms of the
Afghan monarch, Ahmad Shah, who from January 1751 asserted his military
supremacy in Khurasan itself and preserved the rump Afsharid state as a buffer
against the west. The west, which comprised Azarbaljan and the Caspian littoral,
the Zagros, Khuzistan and the Persian Gulf coast and all territory inland as far as
the Kavir and Lut deserts, was recovered by a coalition of Zagros tribes
dominated briefly by the Bakhtiyari then, for the next forty years, by the Zand.
The main military prize in this region was the fortress of Kirmanshah, which
had been Nadir's base and arsenal in his campaigns against the Turks. Dominat
ing not only the routes through the Zagros to Baghdad, but also that between

THE ZAND DYNASTY
the centres of Kurdistan and Luristan, itwas, in addition, well stocked with arms
and munitions. It was held, nominally forShahrukh Shah, by Muhammad Taqi
Gulistana and A.bdal- AJi Khan Mishmast. With the help of the Vali of
Ardalan, they had already repulsed anattack in 1749 bythe Zangana tribe, and
were determined not torelinquish their charge until it became clear who would
prevail in thecomplex struggle for power.
Gaining the chief political prize, Isfahan, was also a problem. All Mardan's
first attempt toreduce it,inthe spring of 1163/1750, met with a severe check at
Murchakhur. From Gulpaygan, hesent messages to his local rivals, including
Zakarlya Khan and Karim, who accepted his proposed alliance and, with their
arrival, increased his number to 20,000. Towards the end of May 1750, this force
faced the army ofIsfahan onthe plain tothe west ofthe town, and completely
routed it. After afew days' siege Isfahan was stormed; AbuDl-Fath Khan and the
other leading citizens prepared todefend the citadel, but AH Mardan's offer of
generous terms if they surrendered and co-operated soon brought them out to
confer with their new masters.
AbuDl-Fath enjoyed the support both ofthe Bakhtiyarl inthe city and of the
Afsharid loyalists, ifindeed any were left. Karim Khan, though not mentioned
by any of the Europeans present atthe capture of Isfahan, had evidently risen to
pre-eminence among the ranks of CA1I Mardan's Luri lieutenants. These three
therefore constituted from theoutset an alliance, in which mutual trust came
second toexpediency. Their first action was toset up a Safavid puppet monarch
to gain popular confidence. Two or three of the minor princes of this house were
still left in Isfahan, the sons of a former court official, Mirza Murtaza, by a
daughter ofthe last Safavid Shah, Sultan Husain. The younger or youngest of
these, ayouth of about seventeen by the name ofAbu Turab, was selected as the
most suitable for the throne — presumably as the most tractable — and despite his
mother's tearful protests was proclaimed Shah, under the name of Ismacil, on 29
June. The East India Company's agent in Isfahan dismissed him as "no more
than a conspicuous Name, under which Ally Merdan Caun carries on his
Tyranny, with thegreater Shew of Justice".3
cAli Mardan assumed the title of Vakil al-daula asthesovereign's supreme
executive. Abu3l-Fath retained his post as civil governor of the capital,and
Karim Khan was entrusted with thesubjugation of the rest of the country as
sardar (commander) of the army, though CAH Mardan retained his Bakhtiyarl

forces. But forthe moment, Karim was in a position to subdue the northern
portion of cIraq-i cAjam he had already chosen for Zand hegemony. For the third
and final time, hedefeated Mihr cAli Khan Tekkelu and occupied Hamadan.
Negotiations at Kirmanshah, though conducted courteously on both sides,
failed tosecure the fortress, and the Zands set off for a campaign in Kurdistan
before the winter should setin.The Vali, Hasan cAli, was ill-prepared and
welcomed his new suzerains with diplomatic compliance, but the Zand army
sacked and burned Sanandaj and laid waste much of the environs before retiring
to winter in their home territory.
Since Karim had left Isfahan, CA1I Mardan had redoubled his extortions,
bearing most heavily on Julfa, which Karim had accorded fair treatment on the
fall of the city. More significantly, he had deposed and killed AbuDl-Fath Khan
and replaced him in office by his own uncle. Finally, in contravention of an oath
the triumvirate had sworn not to actwithout consultation, he had marched
independently on Shiraz and was subjecting the province ofFars to systematic
looting. Replacing the governor and his lieutenants, the Bakhtiyari chief began
to extort the equivalent of three years' taxes and innumerable "presents", andto
requisition alltheraw and manufactured materials hisarmy needed. Of the
officials and headmen who had not already fled, adozen were blinded in one eye
during this period.4 However, onhis way back from pillaging Kazarun, cAli
Mardan was stopped at the steep and narrow pass known as the Kutal-i Dukhtar
by an ambush oflocal musketeers under Muzaric cAli Khishti, headman ofthe
nearby village of Khisht. He lost all his booty from Kazarun and three hundred
men, and had to retreat through the wreckage of Kazarun and take the mountain
route over the Zarda Kuh range towards Isfahan, his ranks further thinned by
desertion and the mid-winter weather.
Meanwhile, Karim Khan harangued his lieutenants onthe perfidy of cAli
Mardan, and in January 1751 entered Isfahan at the head of his augmented army
to put an end toextortion and near-anarchy. The following month he met his
rival inhis own Bakhtiyari mountains and attacked the depleted and dispirited
band. The young Shah, whom CA1IMardan had taken with him, fled over to the
Zand ranks together with his va%Ir Zakariya Khan and other notables, and the

THE 2AND DYNASTY
treated with a generosity which was becoming typical ofthe Zand Khan's
policy.
The early months of 1751 thus mark the beginning ofKarlm Khan's ruleas
viceroy of the nominal king Ismacil III, a position to be hotly disputed for twelve
more years but never wrested from him. From Isfahan he appointed provincial
governors and nominated his kinsmen commanders ofthe armies inthe Zand
homeland, theZagros provinces and theapproaches tothestill unsubdued
Kirmanshah fortress. Local dignitaries came from all over cIraq-i cAjam topay
their respects to the new Shah and his Vakil. The myth of a rival government in
Mashhad had died a natural death.
THE CONTEST FOR HEGEMONY IN WESTERN IRAN, I 7 5 I —6 3
cAli Mardan had meanwhile gained support and fresh levies from Shaikh Sacd of
the Al-Kathir, the Vail of Arabistan (Khuzistan). Inthe late spring of 1752 this
new force set off with the Lurs of Ismacil Khan towards Kirmanshah, and made
friendly contact with the fortress. An attack on their base camp by Muhammad
Khan Zand failed miserably, and after replenishing his stocks the Bakhtiyari
chief left his unwilling hosts at the fortress andcontinued into the Zand
homeland. Near Nihavand hewas met bythe main Zand force under Karim
Khan, and was completely routed. Once again cAli Mardan was forced to flee
into the hills, and thence to Baghdad.
At this juncture, anew and potentially more redoubtable enemy confronted
the Zands. Muhammad Hasan Khan Qajar, elder and only surviving son of
Tahmasp IPs first Vakil al-daula, Fath cAli Khan, had by now extended his sway
from Astarabad, on the north-western marches of the Afsharid kingdom, to
include Mazandaran and Gilan as far as Rasht and Qazvln. Drawn by appeals for
help from Kirmanshah, hearrived atthe head of a small force within a day's
march ofthe Zand army just as it had resumed its siege of the fortress. Leaving
his clients the Kalhur and Zangana tribes to prosecute the siege, Karlm marched
with his main force to meet this threat. The Qajars refused battle and retired
straight to Astarabad. Although the campaigning season was already well
advanced, the Zand leader determined to press home his advantage and invested
the fortress of Astarabad fortwo months. Astalemate was reached: supplies
were running low inthe fortress, and the Zands for their part were constantly
harassed byTurkmen irregulars, but neither side would yield anything in
negotiations. Finally, Muhammad Hasan took the field and, by afeigned flight
which drew the Zands into aTurkmen ambush, utterly routed his attackers. The

Vakil and less than half his battered forces straggled back to Tehran, leaving in
Qajar hands his roifaineant Ismacil III.5
The Qajars didnot follow up their victory, andafter wintering in Tehran
Karim received word that All Mardan Khan was raising anarmy inLuristan to
challenge him again. Early in 175 3, he returned toIsfahan tokeep awatch on this
threat and on the progress of the siege of the Kirmanshah fortress.
Meanwhile, inBaghdad political intrigues were afoot to support the military
threat tothe Zand regency. Under the enlightened and shrewd Sulaiman Pasha,
the city ofthe Caliphs had become a refuge forvictims ofNadir Shah inhis later
years and, more recently, formany who judged it unwise torisk public life inthe
Iran ofhis successors until the present chaos cleared. Among these was Mustafa
Khan Bigdili Shamlu, who hadbeen on hisway as ambassador to Istanbul to
ratify thepeace treaty of 1746 when helearned of Nadir's assassination. A few
years later appeared another refugee, who gave himself out to bea son of Shah
Tahmasp II. He claimed to have been spirited away from Isfahan by a loyal
retainer atthe time ofMahmud's massacre ofthe Safavid princes in 1725, and to
have lived inRussia until after Nadir's death. Whether they believed his claimor
not, he was a heaven-sent opportunity for thePasha to fish in Iran's troubled
waters, forMustafa Khan to return home asa man ofconsequence, and forCA1I
Mardan when hearrived in flight from the field of Nihavand to settle accounts
once andfor all with his Zand rival. Allthree espoused hiscause, proclaimed
him Shah Sultan Husain II, and began torecruit an army with which toplace him
on the throne of Iran.6
Contact was established with the beleaguered garrison of the Kirmanshah
fortress, andtheencouraging promise given that the royal army would soon
march to their relief. TheZands redoubled their efforts to take this obstinate
outpost, but to no effect andin the spring of 1753 CA1I Mardan and Mustafa
Khan, reinforced by the Lurs ofIsmacil Khan, and with the promise ofhelp from
Azad Khan, set off over the Zagros with their royal protege. Then suddenly
Sultan Husain II revealed himself as quite unsuitable — whether mad, nervous or
otherwise unco-operative is notclear — to be passed off as a Safavid monarch.
The march slowed asnew contingents, denied access to the prince, deserted in
droves.
Karim Khan, doubtless aware ofthese developments, finally advanced from
Isfahan, sending ahead an ultimatum to the defenders of the Kirmanshah
fortress. Two years ofsiege had taken their toll, and with no hope ofrelief by CA1I

THE ZAND DYNASTY
Mardan's depleted rabble, Muhammad TaqI and cAbd al-CA1Icapitulated to the
Vakil, whose generous terms were scrupulously observed. Continuing west
wards, Karim confronted cAli Mardan's forces when their last hope - Azad
Khan and his Afghans — was still two days away, and scattered them without
difficulty. Mustafa Khan was captured, butcAli Mardan yetagain madehis
escape, taking with him the Safavid pretender. Finding him a useless burden, the
Bakhtiyari chief later blinded this unfortunate and left him tomake his wayto
the Shicl shrines of Iraq, where helived out his life asa religious recluse.
But AH Mardan's own end was not far away. After the disastrous series of
defeats that followed the triumph of Kirmanshah, the Zand army split into
several fugitive fragments. Spring of 1167/1754 found Muhammad Khan and
Shaikh CA1TKhan Zand inthe Chamchamal region of Kirmanshah, whereAll
Mardan surprised them and took them to the enforced hospitality of his camp in
a nearby gorge. Talks ofan alliance with Karim against the common enemy,
Azad, came to nothing, and the Zand khans realised that their only hope wasto
defeat the Bakhtiyari leader before he defeated them. At apre-arranged signal,
they overpowered A.1I Mardan and his companions attheir next interview, and
Muhammad Khan killed the Bakhtiyari chief with his own dagger. The captives
successfully ran the gauntlet of musketry from Ismacil Khan's Lurs and eventu
ally rejoined Karim Khan with the welcome news that his earliest and most
persistent rival was nomore.7
Azad Khan, a Ghilzai Afghan of Kabul who during the post-Nadir chaos had
risen to somewhat precarious power in Azerbaijan, hadin summer 1753
mistimed his junction with CA1I Mardan's royal army, and found himself in a
position similar to that of Muhammad Hasan Khan Qajar one year before
numerically inferior against a triumphant Zand army. Like the Qajar chief,he
chose discretion and retreated, pleading that he wished only to dissociate himself
from CA1IMardan now that he knew his pretender to have been an imposter. But
Karim insisted on nothing less than Azad's surrender and tribute, which was
rejected. Karlm's lieutenants reminded him of the debacle against the Qajars, but
he was adamant, and attacked. His kinsmen's reluctance led to complete tactical
confusion and precipitated the very disaster they had predicted; the Zands were
routed and fled back to their fortress at Parl, where Shaikh All Khan was left to
organize the defence. Karim, Sadiq and Iskandar Khan hurried toIsfahan, but
found the town disaffected and, judging it indefensible, left for Shlraz.
Azad was not slow to exploit this sudden collapse of the Zand power. At Parl

THE CONTEST FOR HEGEMONY IN WESTERN IRAN
he tricked Shaikh All and Muhammad Khan into theopen and seized them,
together with fifteen others of Karim's family who were in thefortress.The
prisoners and booty were despatched under a strong escort to Urmiya, Azad's
northern base, while in October he secured undefended Isfahan and reduced the
dependent towns to subjection, levying heavy contributions on all.8
Karim had meanwhile been refused entry to Shiraz by the governor, Hashim
Khan Bayat, and was forced toturn about. With a few local reinforcements, he
returned as far as Qumishah, which had recently been ravaged by Azad's deputy,
Fath All Khan Afshar. From here he mounted a series ofguerrilla raids against
Azad's foragers and communications. An army under Fath All Khan advanced
to exterminate this wasps' nest. After a spirited defence, during which the
Vakil's half-brother Iskandar was killed, the Zands were obliged to retreat
south-westwards into the Kuhgiluya mountains. They spent the rest of the
winter inthe Bakhtiyari and Luri hills, supported at Khurramabad bythe Fail!
Lurs. Then the Zand's flagging morale was raised by the spectacular escapeof
the prisoners taken by Azad atQalca Pari: ably abetted by the Zand womenfolk,
Muhammad and Shaikh Allmanaged to slip their bonds and slay theescort
leader, and rode to freedom in the ensuing confusion.9 In the spring of 1167/
1754, Azad sent his re-equipped army under Fath All Khan to confront the new
Zand force. This had badly lost cohesion during the severe winter, and by the
time Karim had fallen back on the Silakhur region, near Burujird, the last ofhis
Luri allies had slipped away. The Zand nucleus fought afierce holding action to
allow the women and baggage to escape, and won through to Chamchamal with
the loss of most of their flocks.
Here Muhammad Khan separated from the others, and commenced a whole
series ofexploits with the murder of All Mardan. He then set about recruiting
tribal levies on theborders of the Zuhab pashalik and prepared to march on
Kirmanshah. Haidar Khan of the Zangana prepared theground by wresting
Kirmanshah from its enforced allegiance to Azad, demolishing the defences and
leading ageneral evacuation to join Muhammad Khan at the frontier. From here
the Zand Khan maintained an active threat to Azad's communications with
Urmiya, intercepting at least one treasure-convoy. He completed Haidar Khan's
work by blowing up the remains of the Kirmanshah fortress and, in the winter of
1168/1754—5 5, stormed and destroyed the Tekkelu fortress of Valashjird.
Having cleared western Traq-i Ajam ofAzad's collaborators, hemarched via
Khuzistan to amass further plunder and join Karim's army in Fars.

THE ZAND DYNASTY
Azad had meanwhile marched into Shiraz in August 1754 and the next month
Fath All drove Karim's small force out of Kazarun. He fell back on the strategic
village of Khisht, near the pass of Kamarij, his last tenuous foothold onthe
Iranian plateau. Nasir Khan, his nominal vassal atLar, had ignored his appeals
for help, and the Zand nucleus was left with a few local allies such as Rustam
Sultan, theheadman of Khisht. A plan was evolved to lead Fath All into
ambush in the narrow Kamarij pass: the Zands and the Dashtistani musketeers
lined up on the plain below, while Rustam Sultan and the musketeers of Khisht
positioned themselves atop the hills flanking the defile. Like All Mardan three
years before, the Afshar were ambushed androuted. The survivors were
pursued through Kazarun to Shiraz, which Azad had to evacuate ten days later.
Agents opened thecity to the besieging Zands, andon 13 Safar 1168/29
November 1754, Karim first entered his future capital of Shiraz.10
Next spring, Muhammad Khan Zand, who had now rejoined Karim, de
feated Fath All Khan, and Azad took steps to relinquish his precarious hold on
Isfahan and retire northwards. While Karim was consolidating his hold on Fars
and preparing to subjugate Nasir Khan of Lar, hisQajar rival Muhammad
Hasan was similarly reasserting his authority over Mazandaran and Gilan, so
that the Qajar domains were now adjacent to Azad's territory; and when in
November one ofAzad's generals was defeated by a Qajar force, the Afghan
pulled out of Isfahan and retired to Kashan. Karim Khan heard of this on his way
to raid Kirman and, changing direction, retook Isfahan unopposed on 17
December 1755. Two days later he set off in pursuit and Azad, caught between
the Zand and Qajar forces, made allspeed back to Urmiya early in 1756.11
But all was not well in the Zand camp. Karim's varied commitments in Fars,
the Gulf coast, Yazd and Kirman had dispersed his manpower; the bulk ofhis
army at Isfahan now consisted of infantry, many of them Arabs, recruited from
the Garmslr and Dashtistan (the Gulf littoral). Disgruntled at the length of their
service, the hardships ofa particularly severe winter and their arrears ofpay,
they demanded their release. Karim, fearing a confrontation with the Qajars,
refused. At this juncture an ultimatum arrived from Muhammad Hasan Khan
demanding that the Zand khan recognize Ismacil Shah, still in Qajar hands, and
co-operate or be eliminated. This message, which only made Karim more
adamant in his refusal, caused a mutiny. Though this was quelled after a few
days' righting, thedamage had been done; Isfahan, with an oppressed and

THE CONTEST FOR HEGEMONY IN WESTERN IRAN
disgruntled populace and held by an unreliable garrison, was indefensible when
the Qajar chief advanced. Shaikh CA1I and Muhammad Khan Zand were sent
to meet him and, on 27 March, at Kazzaz, between Qum and Kashan, were
heavily defeated. Muhammad Khan was captured and sent to Mazandaran,
where in 175 8 he was killed after attempting to escape. Karim Khan moved out
with a few Zand veterans toGulnabad, the site ofthe victory ofthe Ghilzai
Afghans over the Safavids in 1722, and about the beginning of April 1756, was
routed and fled to Shiraz. The Qajars then entered Isfahan unopposed.12
Late inJune, Muhammad Hasan marched on Shiraz, but found it too well
defended and, on news of an advance by Azad, hurried back to defend Isfahan.
However, he could notmuster a large enough force to face the Afghan's
reported 40,000, and withdrew via Kashan and the Siyah-Kuh route to Sari.
Azad thus re-occupied Isfahan about mid-August of 1756. He then moved
rapidly inpursuit ofMuhammad Hasan, but the Qajars were fast enough to
block the Alburz passes, and Azad therefore swung round to Rasht in order to
outflank them along the Caspian coastal route. Muhammad Hasan in turn
moved through Sari to Amul, and completely destroyed Azad's advance lines at
Rudsar with asurprise cavalry-raid atnight. Azad, who had been preparingto
winter at Rasht, found hiselaborate exploratory front being rolled up in
confusion bythis bold stroke, and in February had to abandon Rasht in a
precipitous retreat to Qazvin. Muhammad Hasan continued through Gilan and
Talish as faras Astara onthe edge of the Mughan Steppe, then cut across
Azarbaljan and laid siege to Azad's base of Urmiya.13
Azad marched from Isfahan on 15 April 1757, resolved on adecisive battle,
and two months later was met by the Qajar's main force ashort distance from
Urmiya. Despite his superiority in numbers, Azad was deserted at the height of
the battle by Shahbaz Khan Dunbull and other disaffected local khans; the rest
fled before the victorious Qajars, who looted his baggage and returned tolay
siege to Urmiya. The fortress capitulated within days, and with it went the
loyalty of most of Azad's former territory. Fath CA1IKhan Afshar was induced to
join with the Qajars, while Azad fled to Baghdad.14
Karim Khan had meanwhile engaged ina series ofoperations designed to
secure the hinterland of Shiraz, from the Kuhgllu mountains across the Garmslr
to Khuzistan. His neglect of Isfahan enabled Muhammad Hasan to return to the

THE ZAND DYNASTY
metropolis on 15 December 1757, after another lightning winter offensive, a
double thrust via Burujird and Hamadan. The famine-stricken city could barely
support its own populace, letalone the large and restless army yet again forced
upon it and, inMarch ofthe following year, Muhammad Hasan set off to invest
Shiraz once more. As before, Nasir Khan Lari was invited to join the Qajar chief,
and a month later the complete force was encamped outside the Zand base. But
Shiraz had been well stocked with supplies and theremaining local resources
destroyed; daily sorties and raids cut off men and mounts forcing the Qajars to
seek further afield forfood and fodder, and ina few weeks the siege becamean
ironic copy of Karim Khan's abortive assault on Astarabad six years previously,
this time with theroles reversed. One night in Shawwal 1171/July 1758, the
Afghan and Uzbek contingents, inherited mainly from Azad, looted the Qajar
camp and deserted in a body. The next day thedepleted and dispirited Qajar
army struck camp and fled north.
The over-extended Qajar commitment was now rolled rapidly back to its
point of origin. Husain Khan Develu of the rival Yukharl-bash branch of the
Qajars, who had held Isfahan forMuhammad Hasan, relinquished the city and
raced back towards Astarabad to secure it with his ownmen. Muhammad
Hasan's loyal governor of Mazandaran massacred most of the unreliable Af
ghans who had been allowed to settle around Sari after Azad's defeat; but even
on reaching Tehran theQajar chief was deserted by Fath cAli Khan Afshar,
Shahbaz Khan Dunbuli and other recently-acquired lieutenants. Qajar control
had everywhere been eroded: Sari was plundered by Yamut Turkmen and fellto
Shaikh AllKhan's pursuing Zands. Muhammad Hasan, taking with himthe
puppet king and a few loyal retainers, fled toAstarabad, which despite Husain
Khan Develu hadremained loyal to him.
In Muharram 1172/September 1758, theVakil andhis army moved from
Shiraz tofollow up Shaikh All Khan and deliver the coup degrace. He combined
his slow advance with areview and reorganization of his realms in cIraq-i Ajam,
arriving at Tehran inDecember. Shaikh All Khan, unable tobreach the Qajar
lines atAshraf (present-day Bihshahr), boldly turned their right flank and made
for their capital along the coast, which obliged Muhammad Hasan topull back
hurriedly. Anengagement at Kalbad drove the Qajars into Astarabad, though
Shaikh CA1I was unable immediately to follow upthis success. Fearing betrayal
by the Yukhari-bash potential traitors in his midst, Muhammad Hasan had them
massacred, then emerged again tobring Shaikh All tobattle before he couldbe
extensively reinforced from Tehran. The resulting clash, on 15 Jumada II 1172/
14 February 1759, ended in a total Qajar defeat. Muhammad Hasan was struck

down in flight bya Kurdish renegade from Qajar service, and Astarabad fell
with enormous booty into Zand hands.15
Having recovered Ismacil III,Karim could once more legitimately style
himself vakil and reassert his authority with agrand traditional Nauruz celebra
tion inTehran. Azad Khan was still atlarge inIraq, and Fath CA1IKhan and his
allies controlled Urmiya; but the most immediate danger seemed to stem from
the disaffected Afghan troops andtheir families in Mazandaran. The Qajar
governor at Sari had anticipated this with his massacre the previous year, and the
Zand ruler resolved to ridhimself of this superfluous and dangerously fickle
minority at one blow. That same Nauruz, thousands of Afghans were massacred
all over northern Iran — reputedly 9000 in Tehran alone — and those who escaped
were hunted down and killed asfaraway asYazd.
After spending the summer heat in thtyailaq (summer quarter) of Shamiran,
and a second winter in Tehran, the Vakil moved, in spring 1173/1760, on an
aggressive reconnaissance of Azarbaijan. Maragha was temporarily secured, but
the lightly-equipped Zand army found Tabriz too well-defended byFath CA1I
and returned toTehran before the summer. That autumn, the Vakil and his full
court took a long-needed rest on thepastures of Sultanlya andreturned to
Tehran in December to prepare a full-scale spring offensive.
He was anticipated inthis by his old enemy Azad who, since early 1758, had
been planning to retake Tabriz with thehelp of the Pasha of Baghdad.The
Georgian king Heraclius (Erakli), under pressure from the expanding power of
both Afshars and Zands, encouraged him to return to Azarbaijan, but on his
approach demurred atproviding active aid; and Azad's former lieutenants Fath
CA1I and Shahbaz Khan, far from flocking to his standard, drove off his
vanguard andprepared to defend their independent stake in the province.
Probably in thesummer of 1760, Azad advanced on Tabriz with a large and
composite army and faced the coalition of Afshar and other Azarbaijan warlords
at Maragha. He was completely routed and fled to Kurdistan.16 Failing to recruit
further support either among theKurds or from Sulaiman Pasha, heandhis
household retinue made their way to a comfortable asylum at the Georgian court
in Tiflis. Two years later, his last hope of glory gone with the Vakil's conquest of
Azarbaijan, he surrendered to Karim and was kept as an honourable pensioner at
Shlraz for therest of his life.
It isnot clear why Karim Khan was unable totake immediate advantageof
these struggles forAzarbaijan. Probably his hold onMazandaran and Gilan

THE ZAND DYNASTY
which were to remain Qajar-dominated during the rest of his reign - wasnot
secure enough to allow himto extend the Zand front. It was not until the
summer of 1762, after prolonged confrontation at a distance, that the Vakil
advanced on Tabriz. Near Qara Chaman, some sixty miles south-east ofTabriz,
he was attacked by Fath All Khan's army, which atfirst seemed sure ofvictory.
But the Zand forces, rallied by Karim and Shaikh CA1I, swept the field; Shahbaz
Khan was captured and hastily transferred his allegiance to the Vakil, while Fath
All fled toUrmiya. Tabriz opened its gates, and afew weeks later the Vakil was
besieging Urmiya. Spirited sorties by the garrison, hit-and-run raids by the local
Kurds and a severe winter failed to dislodge theblockaders, andUrmiya fell
seven months later, in Shacban 1176/February 1763, the last fortress in western
Iran to resist the Zands.
CONSOLIDATION OF THE CENTRE, 1 7 6 3 - 6
With the collapse ofFath All's confederation, following so soon onthat ofthe
Qajars, the Vakil was forthe first time master ofall Iran, with the exception of
the Afsharid state of Khurasan. The large retinue that accompanied the Zand
army, first on a tour of western Azarbaljan, then the following summer to
Shiraz, included a large number ofnew allies and hostages, among them Azad
and Fath All. The latter, who by all accounts lacked the generous qualities that
made Azad respected even by his enemies, was executed in Muharram 1178/July
1764 near Isfahan, probably on the instigation of ex-minions who now found
themselves free to voice their detestation.17
Given Fath All's record of oppression and treachery, this action may be seen
as anact ofpolicy; asalso may the massacre ofthe Afghans, in view ofthe still
precarious victory recently enjoyed bythe Zands and the fact that the Afghans
were generally detested as areminder of the worst days of Nadir Shah's tyranny.
But during this same period there were other executions andacts of cruelty
which plainly embarrass the most devoted chroniclers and can only be regarded
as a stain on theVakil's otherwise unblemished record of magnanimity and
forbearance. It would seem that tensions had arisen inthe Zand ranks which led
to something approaching a purge. During Karim's summer recreation in the
Khamsa region in 1760, a Zand officer had been executed after aharem squabble
involving the sister of Muhammad Hasan Khan Qajar, whom Karim had

CONSOLIDATION OF THE CENTRE, I763-6
recently married. During the siege of Urmlya, aplot was discovered to assassi
nate the Vakil; some half-dozen conspirators, including the camp physician,
were executed, and their heads flung at the foot of the city wall.
Soon after the siege the most palpable stain on the Vakil's character occurred.
Shaikh CA1IKhan had apparently shown himself so arrogant and independent as
to constitute athreat tohis cousin's authority; he ischarged by the chroniclers
with misappropriation ofbooty and provincial revenue, and with cruelty and
extortion in dealing with conquered populations. Three ofthe clique hehad
cultivated in camp at Urmlya were executed onKarim's orders. ShaikhAll,
refusing toheed the signs, remonstrated so hotly with his cousin that the two
came toblows and Karim had him blinded. It can only be concluded that the
Vakil saw such arrogance and obstinacy from one who had hitherto been his
close personal friend and most able lieutenant as a genuine threat to his rule, and
as adangerous crack in the united Zand front at astill critical period. Both seem
to have been completely reconciled: Shaikh CA1I spent the rest of his life (until
1186/1772) asa respected member ofthe court, and never became a focus of
sedition.
Several lesser Zand officers were dismissed or arrested at this time, including
Sabz CA1I, a nephew of Shaikh CA1I Nadr Khan Zand, whose flight from the
baggage-camp at Qara Chaman had nearly cost the Zands that battle, died after a
drunken debauch, possibly from poison.18 Three Zand officers were blindedat
Khuy some three months after Urmlya, and others were blinded and executed
later at Isfahan. Then the purge stopped.
Another possible explanation forthis spate of executions, besides that of
policy, may be advanced. At Sllakhur, during the last weeks of1763, Karim was
taken gravely ill. There were fears for his life, though he recovered within the
month. No indication of the nature of his illness is given by the Persian
chroniclers, but reports reaching the Carmelite community atBasra about this
time assert that he had recently recovered from an abscess of the throat caused,it
was said, by excessive addiction to opium. Hehad also taken to excessive
drinking and meted out summary punishments tosuspected miscreants while
drunk.19 Certainly both vices were common enough among rulers of the time,
but this is the only period of his life when the Vakil was noted to be dangerous in
his cups. It may perhaps be conjectured that his impaired judgment and fitsof
vindictiveness - perhaps toohisaddiction to wine and opium - werethe

THE ZAND DYNASTY
reactions of a sick man under stress toafew genuine cases of disloyalty among
men he had come totrust. Happily his temporary aberration never reached the
fatal precipice of Nadir's madness.
Paradoxically, the only irrefutable case of real and sustained rebellion atthis
time was treated by Karlm with consistent moderation and clemency. His cousin
and half-brother Zaki, as his conduct on the Vakil's death was toshow, was a
cruel and selfish opportunist. Piqued by afancied lack of recognition of his role
in the battle of Qara Chaman, he and his adherents had retired to Tehran, where
he plundered Shaikh All's baggage, and continued to Isfahan. Here his
Bakhtiyari supporters tricked All Muhammad Khan Zand, then governor of
Burujird, into renouncing his allegiance to the Vakil and joining Zaki to exploit
the long-suffering populace ofIsfahan. They then launched an abortive attack
on Kashan. Karim forbore at first tointerfere, but by Rabic II, 1177/October
1763 he realized that the whole centre of his realm was likely tocrumble under
the shocks ofthis irresponsible adventure. He advanced from Ardabll to the
relief of Kashan and Isfahan, and Zaki Khan, together with his family,
Bakhtiyari adherents and a collection of hostages from the families of loyal
Zands in Isfahan, fled through the Bakhtiyari mountains toKhuzistan. He lost
his baggage and hostages to the pursuing Nazar All Kan Zand on the western
edge of the Zarda Kuh foothills and, his resources greatly depleted, sought the
help of Maula Muttalib, the chief of the ShIcI Mushacshac Arabs, who was then
Vali of Arabistan.
The Vali found itconvenient to use Zakl's forces as an arm of his advance on
rebel-held Dizful. Zaki, however, recruited reinforcements from the Al-Kathir
tribe, then waging a blood-feud against the Vail and, under their influence,
secured the adherence of the Governor of Dizful in a threefold alliance against
the Vali. Zaki then sent a force under All Muhammad Khan which killed Maula
Muttalib's family and captured him alive. Anxious toavoid the clutches ofhis
blood-enemies the Al-Kathir, the Vali paid Zaki a ransom of 60,000 tumans; but
no sooner was this accepted than Zaki found it expedient to hand overhis
prisoner tothe now dominant Al-Kathir, who promptly killed him.20 The Al
Kathlr had nofurther use fortheir Zand ally, and the remaining Mushacshac
became bitterly hostile, soZaki Khan was obliged to lead his few remaining
Bakhtiyari and Luri adherents back into the mountains. Here, early in 1764, he
was intercepted by Nazar All Khan and threw himself on the Vakil's clemency.
Both heand All Muhammad were granted a full pardon.

CONSOLIDATION OF THE CENTRE, 1763-6
Thus ended an episode which might have split the Zand empire irreparably
had ZakI Khan been anywhere near as diplomatic in dealing with his allies as was
the Vakil. The revolt had acted as abarometer, indicating the latent disaffection
of various tribal elements inthe Zand confederation and on its fringes, which
Karim now took steps to remedy. The Bakhtiyari, still conscious of their
jealously maintained status under the Safavids and Nadir Shah and having come
near to attaining power under All Mardan, now tasted the Vakil's displeasure.
Having retaken Isfahan and restored his authority there by early 1764, Karim
sent forces into the Zarda Kuh to round upand disarm as many Bakhtiyari
tribesmen as possible. Three thousand of their fighting men were incorporated
into the Zand army and the rest forcibly resettled, the Haft Lang around Qum
and Varamin, some two hundred miles tothe north, and the Chahar Lang near
Fasa in Fars, three hundred miles south-east of their ancestral lands.21 Next their
northern neighbours, the Faill Lurs, whose nominal submission to the Vakil had
likewise been sloughed off during Zaki's revolt, were chastised: in the winter of
1764—5 the Zands struck at Khurramabad, plundering Ismacil Khan's posses
sions and forcing him toflee tothe Iraqi plains and the hospitality of the Banu
Lam. Karim dealt out nofurther punishment to the Lurl tribesmen, merely
replacing Ismacil as paramount chief by his more compliant brother. Whereas
the Bakhtiyari seem to have been cowed forthe rest of the Vakil's reign, his
attempts tosubjugate the Faill Lurs were less successful: soon after this Ismacll
Khan returned to power and retained his influence forthe rest of the Zand
period.
Finally, the Zand army moved into northern Khuzistan, preceded by a
detachment under Nazar All Khan which pursued the Banu Lam and plundered
a group of Al-Kathir tribesmen. During the few days the Vakil spent at Dizful
and Shiishtar — where he celebrated Nauruz of1178/1765 — he made several new
government appointments andextracted 20,000 tumans in reparationsand
presents from the recalcitrant province. InMay he returned toShiraz through
the Kuhgiluya mountains, where other rebel strongholds remained to be
breached.
Ever since Karim had been driven back onKazarun by Azad in 1754, this
mountainous area to the north-west of Shiraz had come to form the strategic left
flank of the new Zand heartland of Fars, guarding the routes toKhuzistan and
Luristan. His first campaign here was undertaken in 1757, while Azad and
Muhammad Hasan Khan were struggling for supremacy in the north. Bihbahan,

THE ZAND DYNASTY
the central stronghold of the independent mountaineers, was blockaded,
stormed and sacked, and Jayizan fell after agruelling eight-month siege stretch
ing over the summer. While the Vakil was inAzarbaijan in 1760,one of the two
officials he had appointed togovern the Kuhgiluya rebelled with the support of
the local tribes. Though he wasdismissed and captured, the mountaineers
maintained their independence until the spring of 1178/1765, when all paid
homage to theVakil on hisreturn from Khuzistan, with theexception of the
Lurl tribe of the Liravl centred on two fortresses near Bihbahan. TheZand
advance met with desperate resistance allaround these strongholds, which fell
after appalling casualties on both sides. No quarter was asked or given; prisoners
were beheaded and atower ofskulls built as awarning toothers. The excessive
savagery of this treatment would have gone unnoticed inNadir's day, but as the
action of the normally moderate Vakil it calls forth a somewhat anxious
justification from the chronicler Mirza Sadiq NamI:22 the unrepentant brigands
had putup a fierce fight andan example was necessary in this strategic area.
On 2 Safar 1179/21 July 1765, after an absence of almost seven years,the
Vakil entered his capital and was not to leave again forthe remaining fourteen
years of his reign. Only now could he give thought to securing his strategic right
wing, thelarge andmountainous province of Lar.
Nasir Khan had risen bya process oforganized brigandage inthe period of
the Afghan invasion and Nadir Shah's reign to gain undisputed control ofLar
and its dependencies, the Sabca region bordering on Kirman and the Gulf
littoral. Nadir Shah had been content to confirm his defacto dominion. He had
failed to take Shiraz during the interregnum, but from 1751, with a strong
standing army, asserted hisauthority over the port of Bandar cAbbas and the
trade routes inland. Hehadbeen wooed with further diplomas andtitles by
Azad, Muhammad Hasan and Karim Khan, and had indeed aided the Qajar chief
in his abortive siege of Shiraz in 1758. Karim's first campaign in Lar, in1755,
was a two-pronged advance onthe city of Lar itself, which however held out;
Nasir Khan agreed topay tribute and a truce was reached. Over the next three
years, theZands kept up intermittent pressure on Nasir Khan, who was also
involved in border hostilities with Shahrukh Khan, governor of Kirman.
When Karim Khan set off in pursuit ofthe Qajars in 1758, he detailed a force
to chastise Nasir Khan which had some success, but made no attempt totake the
stronghold of Lar itself. While Sadiq Khan governed Shiraz, the Khan ofLar
continued his depredations unchecked, and in 1760 even forced a truce by the

terms ofwhich his autonomy was recognized fora small tribute and hostages
were exchanged. Early in 1179/1766, however, Karim despatched Sadiq to
reduce thefortress. The town of Lar fell quickly, and a deserter showed the
Zands a secret track uptherocks ontop of which was Nasir Khan's fortress.
Nasir Khan nevertheless fought onuntil, with supplies running low,his men
mutinied and hewas forced to sue forterms. His stronghold was demolished and
he andhisfamily were taken back toShlraz, where they were generously treated
as hostage-guests. The inhabitants of Lar were not subjected to reprisals, and
Masih Khan, a cousin of Nasir Khan, was appointed to govern in his stead,
which he didloyally for therest of Karim's reign.23
CENTRIFUGAL REGIONS, I 7 58— 77
The provincial centres which lay even further away from Shlraz showed a
proportionately greater determination tolive a life oftheir ownattheoutsetof
the Zand regency. At theendofNadir's reign, Kirman was seized by an Afshar,
Shahrukh Khan, whose family hadheld theprovince more orless continuously
since thetime ofShah A.bbas. Headded Yazd andAbarquh tohisdomainsand
paid nominal homage butnotaxes to theAfsharid rulers in Mashhad. In 175 4,he
appealed to Nasir Khan Larl for help against repeated raids by a former
governor ofKirman, MuDmin Khan Bafqi. Nasir Khan marched with 8000 men
ostensibly to join him,but onmeeting Shahrukh Khan near Mashiz he bound
him hand and foot and sent to Kirman fora ransom. This was refused and he
advanced to besiege thecity. Buthe was hotly resisted, and when Shahrukh
Khan managed tobribe hisguards andescape, the Khan ofLar beat a disgrun
tled retreat.
Meanwhile Yazd, traditionally dependent onIsfahan, broke free under Taqi
Khan Bafqi, a local chieftain who hadprofited from the rivalries of Azad,
Muhammad Hasan andKarim Khan to become self-styled governor. On his
way north in 175 8,theVakil sent a flying column under Zaki Zand to bring Taqi
Khan tobook. The"governor" wasdragged straight from his bedtothe rack,
and before Karim arrived with themain body ofthe army hadalready disgorged
12,000 tumans. At a further court hearing, all his creditors were brought
forward totestify tohis oppression andwere duly reimbursed. Taqi Khan was
mulcted anddismissed, andthe Zand army moved on. In 1760, while the Vakil
was in Tehran, Shahrukh Khan once more took possession of Yazd. Karim

THE ZAND DYNASTY
therefore despatched Khuda Murad Khan Zand toimpose his authority onthe
whole of Kirman province. Shortly before the arrival of the Zand army,
Shahrukh Khan was killed in a popular insurrection, but his successors at first
refused to admit Khuda Murad to Kirman. Henegotiated an entry on terms,
which once inside he ignored and subjected the city toeven greater oppression
than hadShahrukh Khan. A bare sixmonths later, in Ramazan 1174/March
1761, he was deposed and killed by avictim of his injustice, one TaqI Khan from
the village of Durran, who, with a small force of musketeers from his native
village, scaled thecity wall one night andseized control.
Like that of previous governors, his reign began in a wave of relative
popularity and military expansion; but Kirman soon relapsed into the civil
turmoil and economic stagnation with which successive predators had familiar
ized it. Late in 1762 TaqI Khan Bafql, whowaswith the Vakil's army in
Azerbaijan, begged the chance to redeem himself by an attack on his namesake in
Kirman. His advance guard was roughly handled bythe Durrani musketeers,
and he turned tail without further engagement. Another expedition about 1764
almost foundered onthe jealousy ofits joint commanders, aKurd, Muhammad
Khan GarrusI, and an Afshar, Amir Guna Khan Tarumi. GarrusI was fortunate
to reach Kirman at a time when TaqI Khan was absent, and took advantageof
mutinous elements within to seize thecity. Buthe was unable to extend his
authority outside, and two months later had to flee when TaqI Khan mounted a
successful night raid and recaptured Kirman. In a second advance on Kirman
soon after this, theKurdish khan was routed in the field and again retired to
Shlraz.
For his fifth attempt tohold this stubborn province, the Vakil commissioned
the veteran All Khan Shahiseven, who methodically drove TaqI Khan backon
his capital and invested it determinedly. But during askirmish outside the walls,
he was shot dead by a sniper andhis army trudged back to Shlraz. Outside
Kirman, theinvincible TaqI Khan was becoming a legend anda mockery of
Karlm Khan's pretensions tobe regent ofIran. CA1IKhan's army was sent back
to theattack under Nazar AllKhan. Byjudicious propaganda and generous
treatment of defectors he encouraged desertions by many who were
disillusioned with the extortionate sway ofTaqI Khan. By about spring of1766,
supplies had dwindled in the blockaded city and popular disaffection increased
to such a degree that TaqI Khan was seized and the gates thrown open to the
Zands. He was taken to Shlraz and put todeath.24 From then on Kirman andits

dependencies remained securely in the Vakil's hands, though the rivalries of the
various local governors did little to restore its prosperity. Eventually, Karim
Khan appointed as beg/erbeglan Ismaclll sayyid, Abu3l-Hasan CA1IShah MahallatI,
well respected locally for his piety and generosity. His moral authority overrode
the petty squabbles of the regional military governors, and his ample private
income precluded any necessity for extortion or peculation; Kirman was thus
governed wisely and well for the rest of the Vakil's reign.
The provinces of Astarabad (Gurgan), Mazandaran and Gllan never wholly
submitted to Zand rule, remaining a centre of Qajar power and intermittent
revolt from Nadir's time up to Agha Muhammad's final overthrow of the Zands
in 1795. Karim Khan was aware of the magnitude of this problem and attempted
to reduce it by appeasement, by dividing the Qajars among themselves and by
taking hostages, but without great success. On his death in 1759, Muhammad
Hasan Khan left nine sons, most of whom fled from Astarabad to the traditional
Qajar refuge, the Turkmen of the Dasht-i Qipchaq (the northern steppe). From
here they took to raiding the governor, Husain Khan Develu, appointed by the
Zand, who was of the rival Yukhari-bash clan. But Muhammad Hasan's eldest
son Agha Muhammad Khan, then aged about eighteen, was captured in
Mazandaran and sent to Tehran, where Karim treated him with exceptional
kindness and urged him to persuade the remaining fugitives to give themselves
up. This they did, and were settled on the family estates; the elder princes,
including Agha Muhammad and Husain Quli Khan, were taken as hostages to
Shiraz, where they were treated with Karim's customary kindness. Muhammad
Hasan's sister, Khadija Bigum, was likewise taken to Shiraz as the Vakil's wife.
This wise policy was unfortunately prejudiced by the immediate military
pacification of the Qajar realms, undertaken by ZakI Khan with unnecessary
cruelty. But the greatest risk the Vakil took in attempting to tame these
provinces was in later appointing Muhammad Hasan's second son, the twenty
year old Husain Quli, to govern Damghan. With Agha Muhammad a hostage in
Shiraz and a eunuch (he had been castrated by cAdil Shah in 1748),25 Husain Quli
Khan was the heir apparent and guarantor of the posterity of the Ashaqa-bash
clan of the Qajars. Perhaps, as the Qajar historians claim, the Vakil was
persuaded by Agha Muhammad — for whose political sagacity he had a genuine
respect - that this was the best way to retain full control of Mazandaran.26 At any

rate, theyouth's first action on taking up hisappointment in Shawwal 1182/
February 1769 was tomarry the daughter ofa Qajar noble, from which union
was born inthe following year the future Fath All Shah. Over the course of the
next eight years Husain Quli recruited and organized apowerful following of
Ashaqa-bash andtheir clients and, byintimidation backed byopen warfare
where necessary, neutralized the power ofthe Yukhari-bash who were subsi
dized bythe Zand. He was careful to keep within the bounds ofthe traditional
Qajar clan feud and could never beproved to have rebelled openly against the
Vakil; with theresult that Karlm refrained from exerting pressure on his
hostages and was content tosend three small expeditionary forces to replace or
restore the Yukhari-bash khans and exact apologies and contrite promises from
the young Qajar.
His savage destruction of the Develu stronghold of Qalca Namaka earned for
him the sobriquet ofJahansiiz Shah ("World-burner"), and brought a punitive
force ofLurl andKurdish cavalry under Zaki Khan. Husain Quli prudently
withdrew tothe Turkmen steppes, but when Zaki's force retired he came out of
hiding and killed Hasan Khan, the ex-governor ofAstarabad who had recently
relinquished his post in fear of attack. Fearing for his own position, Muhammad
Khan Savadkuhi, governor ofMazandaran, called for Zand reinforcements and
marched on Astarabad. Husain Quli bypassed him, seized hiscapital ofSari,
defeated him inthe field, tortured and killed him. His son Mahdl Khan escaped
to Shiraz, and returned with a Zand army toexact vengeance; again the Qajar
took refuge onthe steppes, only toreturn and defeat Mahdl Khan at Barfurush
after the Zands had withdrawn. Finally, in 1190/1776, Zaki Khan returned to
Mazandaran and restored order with abrutality long remembered. All Husain
Quli's supporters were sorelentlessly persecuted that bythe time Zaki left for
Shiraz even the Qajar's Turkmen allies had begun todesert him. He massacreda
band ofTurkmen raiders who had attacked one ofhis few remaining allies, then
soon after a last abortive assault on Astarabad, about 1191/1777, he was
murdered by aband ofTurkmen as he lay asleep inthe open. Though the Vakil
condoled most sympathetically with Agha Muhammad, he can hardly have been
other than greatly relieved.
THE PERSIAN GULF
During the greater part of this period the Zand ruler was more actively
occupied with affairs onthe Persian Gulf. The Iranian littoral ofthe Gulf, from
the Shatt al- Arab totheStrait ofHurmuz, was dominated bya series of petty
86

THE PERSIAN GULF
Arab shaikhs and their often intractable subjects. For the most part Sunni
Muslims, they remained aloof from their Iranian neighbours, and paid tribute to
inland rulers only when these could afford to send armed expeditions to enforce
it; even then, they would often escape temporarily to the offshore islands. Their
nominal occupations of fishing, pearling and trading were supplemented by
booty from raids ontheir rivals by land and sea. Their counterparts onthe
Arabian shore included the Qawasim (or Jawasim) ofJulfar, who from 1760
began toinfiltrate Qishm Island and the inland regions near Bandar Abbas.
This port, developed byShah Abbas to serve Kirman and Isfahan, had
already lost much of its importance through Nadir's transfer of the capital to
Mashhad, and during the anarchy of the interregnum was a centre only of
continuous strife as the governor Maula All Shah, Nasir Khan Larl, the local
Banu Macin Arabs and the invading Qawasim struggled for the rights to salvage
the sorry remains of Nadir's navy, plunder the dwindling merchant traffic and
blackmail the British and Dutch trading posts. Even after Karlm Khan had
established himself at Shlraz, his access to this region was at first blocked by the
hostile Nasir Khan; and by the time this menace was neutralized, Shiraz's natural
port of Bushahr (Bushire) had risen to replace Bandar A.bbas asIran's first
trading centre. This process was confirmed when first the Dutch in 1759, then
the British East India Company in 1765, moved their bases from Bandar Abbas
in the lower Gulf and resettled respectively on Kharg Island and at Bushahr, in
the upper Gulf.
Karlm Khan's contemporary atBushahr was Shaikh Nasir, who combined
his small army and fleet in 1753 tocapture the Bahrain archipelago. He was
imprisoned by the Vakil two years later, but on release remained a loyal vassal of
the Zands until his death in 1783. Some forty miles north-west of Bushahr ruled
his rival and occasional ally Mir Nasir Vagha3! of Bandar Rig, whose jurisdiction
included the offshore island of Kharg.
In 1753, Baron Kniphausen, former director of the Dutch agency atBasra
who had been imprisoned, fined and expelled by the Ottoman governor on
various trumped-up charges, returned from Batavia with three ships and
occupied the island of Kharg. From here, he so successfully blockaded the Shatt
al- Arab that the governor refunded his "fine" and in vain begged him to return
to Basra. Kniphausen proceeded to turn Kharg into aflourishing Dutch colony
with a stout fort and a village, attracting Armenian merchants from the
mainland and the staff ofthe declining settlement at Bandar Abbas.
The terms by which the Dutch held Kharg were now called in question.
According to the Baron and his successors, Mir Nasir of Bandar Rig had freely

ceded the island to them, while Mir Naslr's energetic adolescent son Mir
Muhanna maintained that they owed a heavy rent.27 With thepretext of his
father's inability to press this claim, Muhanna killed both hisparents and,by
1755, had taken control ofBandar Rig. His elder brother Husain returned from
Bahrain, but at the same time Karim Khan suddenly descended onBandar Rig
and detained both brothers at Shiraz for a year. When they returned in1756,
apparently reconciled, aBritish agency had been established atthe port; but this
was hastily abandoned when Mir Muhanna killed his brother and fifteen other
relatives and recovered complete control of Bandar Rig. Over the next few years
Mir Muhanna's notoriety spread throughout the Gulf. The Vakil arrested him
again in 1758,but reinstated him onthe intercession ofan influential relativeof
the pirate; and when, in 1765,Karim sent ademand for tribute backed by a force
under Amir Guna Khan Afshar, Mir Muhanna embarked his men and livestock
on boats and setoffto Khargu, a small island next to Kharg. The Vakil is said
also to have demanded tribute from the Dutch on Kharg, who likewise
refused.28 With both Shaikh Nasir of Bushahr and the British reluctant to render
naval aid, the Zand army was left helpless on the shore.
Finally the East India Company's vessel and Shaikh Nasir's flotilla sailed
diffidently into the attack, and forthe next five weeks Mir Muhanna's fleet ran
rings round them, and continued toprey on merchant shipping from its Khargu
base. A Dutch expedition from Kharg was routed, and the pirate quickly
followed upthis advantage by landing inforce onKharg itself. On New Year's
Day 1766 the director, Van Houting, wastricked into leaving his fort to
negotiate, whereupon heand hisstaff were seized and bundled into boats for
Bushahr, there to await passage back to Batavia. Bythis coup, Mir Muhanna
secured thestrongest fort and richest warehouse in theGulf; he had likewise
regained control of Bahrain, and when the frustrated Zand army withdrew from
Bandar RigtheVagha°I chief reoccupied his original base as well.
A further Zand expedition under ZakI Khan failed even totake Bandar Rig.
The East India Company attacked Kharg independently andwere beaten off
with loss, after which Mir Muhanna inreprisal captured aBritish merchantman,
the Speedwell, asshe sailed up the Gulf. No co-ordination was achieved between
the Company andthe Zands, despite protracted talks; but, by 1768, definite
pressure was exerted on Khargu through a joint blockade by Zakl's army at
Bandar Rig and Shaikh Nasir's fleet. Hardship robbed Mir Muhanna of support,

Muhanna andthe Dutch." 28 Niebuhr, Reisebeschreibungen n, pp. 183-4.

THE PERSIAN GULF
and early in 1769he was surprised by arevolt of some of his kinsmen and only
just escaped with his bodyguard in asmall open boat. The island submitted to
the Zands, and theVakil showed hisusual statesmanship in forgoing all
reprisals, distributing Mir Muhanna's property among the rebels and appoint
ing their leader, Hasan Sultan, to govern Bandar Rig. Mir Muhanna had
meanwhile landed near Basra, where he wascaptured by thegovernor's men and
executed. Kharg slipped back into the poverty and obscurity of the days before
the Dutch, who never returned to the Gulf; and Bandar Rig, its defences
demolished and the independent Vagha°i spirit crushed, was henceforth com
pletely overshadowed by Bushahr.
Karim's attempts to control the lower Gulf at this later period were rather
less successful. In 1769, he sent a demand to the Imam of Oman for tribute onthe
same terms as had been imposed by Nadir, and for the return of Nadir's ship the
Kahmanlwhich the Imam had bought from the Banu Macln without the Vakil's
consent. These demands were contemptuously rejected, and an intermittent
state ofwar, manifested inisolated acts of piracy, subsisted between Iran and
Oman for most of the Zand period. Having won some measure of control over
the Bandar Abbas region, Karim in 1187/1773 sent a force under ZakI Khan to
mount a seaborne invasion of Oman. Shaikh cAbd-Allah of the Banu Macin — the
real power inthe region, whose son was then a hostage inShiraz — promised
every support but, onZakl's arrival, lured him to Hurmuz Island with the
promise of his beautiful daughter's hand in marriage, and then imprisoned him.
The Zand army awaited his return to the mainland in vain, and finally dispersed;
the Vakil was obliged to comply with the Shaikh's suggestion of a reciprocal
return of hostages, and cAbd-Allah's son wassent from Shiraz while a chastened
ZakI returned in disgrace.29 So ended the Vakil's first attempt to emulate Nadir
Shah by foreign conquest.
The largest and best organized ofthe "pirate" states which the Vakil set
himself to subdue was that ofthe Banu Kacb ofKhuzistan.30 From the late
sixteenth century, they had moved from lower Iraq tosettle atQuban on the
Khaur Musa inlet, and later at Dauraq on the Jarahi river. After Nadir's death
their great Shaikh Salman rebuilt this centre as his capital and renamed it
Fallahiya. He rapidly expanded his realms along the Shatt al-cArab to comprise a
triangular empire of about onehundred miles a side, embracing both Iranian and
Ottoman territory. In 1758 helaid down the nucleus ofa navy which soon
outstripped that of the qaputanpasha of Basra. His amphibious forces could raid

date-groves and caravan routes andblockade the Shatt at will, andwhen
pursued by the forces of either the Pasha orthe Vakil would disappear into their
marshland fastnesses andevade or buy offtheir frustrated pursuers.
Karim Khan mounted punitive campaigns oflimited success in 1170/1757
and 1178/1765, forthesecond of which hehadbeen promised assistanceby
cUmar Pasha ofBaghdad. Atruly international project was evolved forcom
bined operations against this brigand state, whereby Ottoman troops andthe
East India Company's gunboats were todrive the Kacb inland from the Shatt
while the Zand army intercepted them from the north-east. But though Karim
reached Fallahiya, the boats and supplies promised by the Pasha never material
ized. By dint of destroying Kacb property, the Vakil elicited tribute from Shaikh
Salman and marched home, after delivering a strong protest tothe Pasha. The
Kacb, after playing cat-and-mouse with the clumsy and illco-ordinated Basran
navy, likewise bought atruce with the Turks. The British atBasra, who omitted
to have themselves included in this treaty, lost three ships to theKacband
unwisely launched their own amphibious offensive with reinforcements from
Bombay; they suffered heavy casualties and withdrew topatrol theShatt.All
remaining Turkish and British pressure onthe Kacb was then removed when
Shaikh Salman induced the Vakil, by means of expensive presents, toserve both
the Pasha and the Company's agent with an ultimatum to withdraw from Iranian
territory and cease molesting his"subjects" theKacb.
Kacb fortunes declined rapidly with the death ofShaikh Salman in 1768, after
thirty-one years ofindependent tussling with the three greatest powers in the
Gulf. His successors readily co-operated with the Vakil seven years later in his
conquest of Basra. Only with the taming of the shaikhs of the Gulf ports and the
Kacb was the Zand leader ready forthis last and most ambitious target, which
had eluded both Shah A.bbas andNadir Shah.
WAR WITH THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE, 1774— 79
Karim's war with the Turks was fought simultaneously on two fronts - the Shatt
al- cArab, and the Kurdish provinces ofBaban and Zuhab, from where Baghdad
itself could be threatened. Themajor political cause of the warwas cUmar
Pasha's intervention inthe rivalries for the frontier province ofBaban (approxi
mately present-day Sulaimanlya in Iraq), which, since thedeath of Sulaiman
Pasha of Baghdad in 1762, hadfallen increasingly under theinfluence of the
Zand-sponsored viceroy {vati) of Ardalan (equivalent to thepresent ustan of
Kurdistan). cUmar's replacement of the Baban ruler in 1774 provoked two

WAR WITH THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE, 1774-9
campaigns bythe Zands to restore Iranian influence in the area. This sudden
hardening of the Pasha's hitherto laissez-faire attitude was further manifested in
his imposition ofa frontier toll onIranian pilgrims tothe shrines ofNajaf and
Karbala, and inhis confiscation of the residue of Persian pilgrims and residents
who died during the epidemic that devastated Iraq during 1772-73. Demands
for redress and for fair treatment of pilgrims, inaccordance with Nadir's treaty
of 1746, brought no response.31
With the loss of Mashhad, free access to the shrines of Iraq was more
important tothe Zand leader than it had been tothe Safavids orthe Afsharids,
and the Pasha's policy was enough to justify aShi'\jihad. Other motives were the
need toemploy a standing army prone to restlessness, and to recoup prestige
after Zaki's embarrassing misadventures on Hurmuz; tochastise the Pasha and
his mutasallim (governor) of Basra for their connivance at Kacb depredations and
for alleged assistance of the Omani enemy; and above all the commercial prize of
Basra itself. In recent years, the Iraqi port had perceptibly overtaken itsrival
Bushahr which, in 1769, had been abandoned bythe East India Company in
favour of Basra. Factors favouring the Zands were the weakness and disorgani
zation of both Baghdad and Basra after the recent epidemic, and the inability of
the Sublime Porte, chastened after its defeat by Russia in 1774, torender direct
assistance to its near-autonomous eastern province.
While CA1T Murad and Nazar CA1I Khan Zand kept the Pasha's forces
occupied in Kurdistan with a few thousand men, Sadiq Khan marched with
some 30,000 men to commence the siege of Basra in Safar 1189/April 1775. The
Mutasallim's Muntafiq Arab allies retired without attempting to deny Sadiq
passage of the Shatt, and boats provided and crewed by the Kacb and the Arabs
of Bushahr secured theIranian army's transport and supplies. The garrison
under the energetic Sulaiman Aqa defended the town with spirit, and Sadiq was
forced toentrench fora blockade lasting over a year. The Company resident,
Henry Moore, after attacking some of the besiegers' supply boats and providing
a chain boom to block the Shatt below Basra, slipped anchor and left for Bushahr
and Bombay at thestart of the siege. In October, a fleet from Oman broke
through the boom to land supplies and reinforcements, which greatly raised
Basran morale; but their united sortie the following day appears to have been
indecisive. The Omani fleet was thus confined toits anchorage under constant
fire, and that winter the Imam decided to cut his losses and sailed back to Muscat.
31 The accounts ofthis war and its causes inthe Persian chronicles (Nami, p. 18iff.; Ghifarl, pp. 176-7, i8ofT.) are substantially confirmed byOttoman sources (e.g. Hatt-i Hiimayun i, nos. 2, 174, 202, 218, 219; Jaudat (Cevdet), Tarlkh 11, pp. 5 5fF.)

THE ZAND DYNASTY
A relief force from Baghdad wasdefeated by Sadiq's Shici Arab allies, the
Khazacil, and, bythespring of 1776, thetightened blockade had brought the
defenders to the verge of starvation. Mass defections and the threat of mutiny
drove Sulaiman Aqa to capitulate on 26 Safar 1190/16 April 1776.
Ottoman reactions tothese events onthe eastern frontiers were surprisingly
slow, even granted the death of the capable Sultan Mustafa III and his succession
by the weak cAbd al-Hamid late in 1773, and the subsequent Russian misadven
ture. An Ottoman envoy, Vehbi Efendi, was despatched to Shiraz in February of
1775, when theKurdish front was momentarily quiet and before news of the
impending siege ofBasra had reached Istanbul. He arrived inShiraz, ironically,
about the same time that Sadiq reached Basra, but wasnot empowered to
negotiate over this new crisis.32 By the time he returned to the Porte, bearing the
conventional compliments and detailed complaints against cUmar Pasha, Basra
had fallen. Some months later the Porte dismissed cUmar on charges of provok
ing a needless war, enforcing this decision with an army under thePasha of
Raqqa; butthis attempt to subject Baghdad directly to Istanbul misfired, for
cUmar's former lieutenant cAbd-Allah soon took over the pashalik. It was not
until about May 1776 that the Porte had afatva issued declaring war on the Vakil
and forces were levied for a campaign on theKurdish front. At Marivan in
Rabic 11191/May 1777 Khusrau Khan, the Vail of Ardalan, was heavily defeated
by the reinforced Pasha ofBaban; but some months later athree-pronged Zand
invasion of Kurdistan restored the status quowith a rout ofthe Turkish-Baban
forces on the plain of Shahrazur, and cAbd-Allah Pasha initiated peace
negotiations.
In Basra, meanwhile, aheavy indemnity was extorted and hostages, including
Sulaiman Aqa, were sent to Shiraz. But there was no prescription andSadiq
seems in general to have respected theterms of capitulation. Only when he
returned toShiraz later in the year, leaving cAli Muhammad Khan to administer
the city and region, did the occupation degenerate into a chaos of unrestrained
greed and senseless slaughter. Extortion increased to the verge of outright
looting and women were abducted forthe pleasure ofthe commandant and his
officers. Having squeezed the town dry, CA1IMuhammad turned his attention to
the countryside: he plundered andburned down thetown of al-Zubair and
repeatedly robbed the Muntafiq Arabs despite apledge ofsafe conduct. In June
1778, the Muntafiq retaliated by routing oneof his raiding parties and, in
September, cAli Muhammad setout with a large force to teach them a lesson.

KARIM KHAN S SUCCESSORS, I779—95
The Arabs led him into a trap between the Euphrates and a swamp, and
massacred himandhis army almost to a man.
Vengeance satisfied, the Muntafiq made no attempt to follow up this
resounding success by retaking Basra, and the garrison was able tosit tight until
Sadiq Khan hastened back with reinforcements inDecember. Bled ofall wealth,
depopulated by plague, siege and occupation, Basra wasalready more ofa
liability than an asset to the Zands; from now on it lost its commercial
importance both as aterminus ofthe caraven route toAleppo and as aport, and
was nolonger ofuse even asa bargaining-point innegotiations with Baghdad,
since these had collapsed with the recent death of Abd-Allah Pasha and a
renewal of internecine anarchy in the pashalik. Sadiq was already preparing to
withdraw when hereceived the not unexpected news ofthe Vakil's death on 13
Safar 1193/1 March 1779.
KARIM KHAN'S SUCCESSORS I 77 9 — 95
Now in hisseventies, Karim hadbeen ill for sixmonths, though he remained
active until the end. No sooner had he breathed his last than the folly and malice
of his leading kinsmen, apparent though overshadowed during his reign,
erupted unchecked toblast apart all that he had created. Karim's three sons — the
elder two, Abu3l-Fath and Muhammad All, frivolous and incompetent, and the
youngest still achild — became pawns inavicious struggle forsupremacy. Even
before the Vakil had been buried, Zaki Khan, allied with All Murad Khan and
ostensibly proclaiming the Vakil's second son, lured from the citadel and
slaughtered Nazar Alland Shaikh AllKhan andtheir supporters, whohad
battened onto AbuDl-Fath. Sadiq arrived from Basra to press his own claims to
the succession, but was deserted byhis army when Zaki threatened reprisalson
their families in Shiraz, and fled to Bam.
On the morning after the Vakil's death, his Qajar hostage Agha Muhammad,
who was allowed togo hunting outside the walls, escaped northwards. Zaki had
sent inpursuit All Murad Khan Zand, who now rebelled atIsfahan inthe name
of Abui-Fath. On his march against him, Zaki Khan committed such atrocities
at the village ofIzadkhwast that even his own men were shocked, and killed this
monster on thespot. Sadiq was thus enabled to return and occupy Shiraz,but
was still opposed by All Murad. After aneight-month blockade, Shiraz fellby
treachery in February 1781; Sadiq wasmurdered together with all his sons
except Jacfar, who hadcome to terms privately with All Murad.
All Murad found himself faced with a resurgence of Qajar power and

established his capital strategically at Isfahan. Hecampaigned energetically in
Mazandaran, but Jacfar Khan took advantage of his absence to march on
Isfahan. Hastening to defend his capital in midwinter against his doctors' advice,
CA1I Murad died at Murchakhur in February 1785. Hisreign, which saw the
Zands relinquish all claims tonorthern and even central Iran, can be seen as the
watershed between Zand and Qajar history. Jacfar Khan occupied Isfahan, but
was driven out twice by Agha Muhammad and fell back on Shlraz. In 1204/1789,
his treachery indealing with his own supporters provoked amutiny inwhich he
was killed.
He was succeeded by the young Lutf cAli Khan, the only oneof Karim
Khan's successors to have wonadmiration for his courage and integrity.33
Having recovered Shlraz from themutineers, he then held it against a deter
mined Qajar assault. His downfall was precipitated by amutual distrust between
him and Haj ji Ibrahim, the kalantar (Mayor) of Fars who had initially helped him
to power. On his way toattack Isfahan in 1206/1791, Lutf CA1Iwas deserted by
his army on theinstigation of the Kalantar's brother, andon racing back to
Shiraz found the city inthe hands ofHaj ji Ibrahim. Denied help from Bushahr,
the young Zand prince nevertheless continued with the few troops still loyal to
him and a few Arab levies to fight offthe Qajar advance onShiraz, which Hajji
Ibrahim had offered toturn over to Agha Muhammad. At one point, he secured
the Qajar camp in a daring night raid, buthisforces scattered to plunder. At
dawn ittranspired that Agha Muhammad and the hard core of his army were still
in the camp; Lutf CA1I had toflee eastwards. After several more vicissitudes he
surprised Kirman in 1794 and held it for four months before theQajars were
admitted by treachery.
The Qajar eunuch behaved with studied barbarity inthe fallen town: all adult
males were killed or blinded, andsome 20,000 women and children given as
slaves to the troops. Lutf CA1I himself fled to Bam, where hewas seized by the
governor and handed over to the Qajars. Agha Muhammad had his last Zand
enemy blinded and cruelly tortured before taking himback to Tehran for
execution. Lutf cAli's courage and resilience had imparted a certain nobility to
the death throes of the Zand dynasty; but the urban governors and headmen, the
tribal chiefs and regional warlords, justifiably disillusioned with the Zands and
not yet familiar with the Qajars, had elected toturn anew page inthe historyof
Iran.

GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY UNDER THE ZANDS
GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY UNDER THE ZANDS
The geographical extent ofthe Zand empire atitszenith, from 1765 to 1779, was
in practice about half that ofthe Safavids. Sistan and Baluchistan, never strongly
held and regarded byNadir mainly as asource ofmanpower, had remained aloof
from the wrangling in western Iran on Nadir's assassination and under Naslr
Khan Baluch were partly absorbed into the Durrani empire; thus Lar and
Kirman, exercising a tenuous jurisdiction over the coastal shaikhdoms of
Makran, constituted theeastern marches of Karlm Khan's Iran. The natural
frontiers of the LutandKavir deserts, andtheturbulent Qajar province of
Astarabad, separated the Zand state from the Afsharid kingdom of Khurasan,
which from 1755 waseffectively a tributary ofAhmad Shah. Theonly contact
between Zands and Afsharids seems to have been twovisits to Shiraz by
Shahrukh's son Nasr-Allah Mirza, in1767 and1775, which were requests foraid
to further personal and factional interests rather than embassies. The prince was
politely received butwent home empty-handed.34 There isno record ofcontact
between the Vakil and Ahmad Shah; it would seem that these two great
contemporaries, having divided Nadir's empire soneatly between them, agreed
tacitly to keep Khurasan as a buffer between their separate interests and hostile
peoples.
Gilan was traditionally administered by its owngovernors even when
incorporated by Muhammad Hasan Khan into the Qajar realms, and this
arrangement continued under the Zands. Onleaving the north in 1763 Karim
re-appointed asbeglerbegi at Rasht, Hidayat-Allah Khan, whocontrolled this
keystone of the northern provinces until his death, engineered by Agha
Muhammad Khan, in1784. He maintained abrilliant court and apowerful army,
but prudently kept uphis annual tax remittance to Shiraz, supplemented by gifts
and special orders ofsilks. Hissister was married to Karim Khan's eldest son,
AbuDl-Fath. His revenue wasaugmented by trade with the Russians,who
maintained a post at Anzall (Enzeli).
Azarbaijan andtheprovinces south ofthe Caucasus, including the tributary
Christian kingdom of Georgia, were conceptually an indispensable part of
Safavid Iran. However, Safavid pretensions to rule Georgia, andeven her
southern Muslim neighbours ofShirvan, Qarabagh andNakhchivan, hadbeen
shaken by Peter theGreat's incursion of 1722 and, although the chroniclers

THE ZAND DYNASTY
ignore it, Iran's hold on the regions north ofthe Aras was completely eroded
over the next forty years. Azarbaijan under its beglerbegl at Tabriz, Najaf Quli
Khan Dunbull, whose son was held hostage atShiraz, was the only province of
this region toowe direct allegiance and pay direct taxes to the Vakil during his
fourteen years in Shiraz. The most powerful of the Transaraxian khans was Fath
All Khan Qubba3! (or Darbandi), who ruled over much ofthe region corre
sponding to Soviet Azarbaijan from the 1760s until 1789; regarded by the
Persian chroniclers asa vassal of the neo-Safavid Zand state, hewas in fact
autonomous, maintained friendly relations with his Georgian neighbour and,
like him, sought Russian financial and military aidagainst threats from the
Ottomans and rival Daghistani khans.
Heraclius of Georgia, after his occupation of Erivan in 1749 and defeat of his
former ally Azad in 1751—2, could afford largely to ignore the changing situation
south of the Aras. After itbecame obvious that Mashhad was no longer the seat
of government, and probably about thetime of the Zand army's progress
through Azarbaijan (1762-63), Heraclius tendered his submission tothe Vakil
and received his diploma as Vail of Gurjistan - the traditional Safavid office, by
this time an empty honorific. From 1752, increasing appeals to Russia for
subsidies and troops against Lezgl and Turkish attacks had brought Georgia
more closely under Russian influence. With the Vakil's death and the belligerent
Qajar expansion in the north it became nolonger either necessary or indeed
desirable to curry favour with Iran; following through aproposal he had made
as early as 1771, Heraclius in 1783 formally placed Georgia under Russian
protection. There was no direct Russian contact with the Vakil. In the spring of
1784 Catherine IIsent an embassy to cAli Murad Khan in response to his ex post
facto offer to cede the Transaraxian khanates in exchange for recognition and aid
against the Qajars; but All Murad died before this agreement could be ratified.35
A more important area where the Safavid conceptual heritage clashed with
the exigencies of historical fact is that of the nature of the Zand ruler's authority.
Such was the abstract prestige of the Safavid Shah, especially since Nadir's
premature and unpopular usurpation of the throne, that the early contenders for
power inthe interregnum found it necessary tocreate and carry around with
them the nonentity Ismacll III, as atalisman tocanvass support and legitimize
their power. Their respect for their protege was non-existent, and Karlm was
content once he settled atShiraz in 1764 toimmure the Shah inthe fortress of

GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY UNDER THE ZANDS
Abada with adequate pension and provisions and anannual Nauruz present
from his supposed viceroy.
The title originally assumed by Karim (though not attested in this form) was
presumably vakil al-daula, "viceroy ofthe state", which in Safavid times implied
supreme command of the Shah's army and politico-military dictatorship onhis
behalf. It had been conferred onNadir by Tahmasp II, was assumed by All
Mardan Khan on hisinvestiture of Ismacil, andin turn inherited byKarim Khan.
But soon after settling in Shlraz, theZand leader is said to have changed the form
of his title tovakil al-racaya, "representative ofthe people". This title, which
from Safavid times into thepresent century designated a local magistrate
appointed by thecrown to investigate cases of oppression or corruption,
perhaps continues a centuries-old tradition of a provincial ombudsman in Iran.36
Karim insisted on this appellation for the rest of his reign, declining to assume
the title ofshah, even when Ismacil III died almost unnoticed in 1187/1773.It
became obvious that vakil was in effect a personal honorific while Karim's
position was equivalent to that of shah. His successors of the Zand dynasty
apparently did not adopt the title of vakil.
Karim Khan owed his undiminished popularity in large measure to the fact
that he thus respected the surviving Safavid prejudice and the distrust of the
long-oppressed masses ofany new despot who might emulate Nadir. At the
same time he realized that the Safavid ghost was ready tobe quietly laid by a
government that could justify itself by humane andefficient policies rather than
by appeal to a threadbare charisma, andallowed theoutworn device of a regency
to drop into oblivion.37
Nor did Karim Khan seek the sanction of theculama for his novel position.
Formerly thebulwarks of the Shah's authority asviceroy of God andtheImams,
their power had already been weakened by Nadir's quasi-Sunni religious policy
and his resumption of much vaqf property to pay forhis army. Duringthe
interregnum, many of the culama emigrated to the shrines of Iraq, so that those
who remained or returned in Karim's reign found their sanction unwanted by a
tribal leader whose ownreligion wasperfunctory at best. He upheld the Shlca in
a conventional way, having coin struck in thename of the hidden Imam,
building mosques and shrines, and allotting stipends toreligious functionaries
in Shiraz. Sufi dervishes also began to return to Iran in his reign, but their
persecution atthe hands ofthe culama — a recurrent phenomenon throughout
36 SeePerry, "Justice for the Underprivileged", esp. pp. 211-12. 37 For further discussion of these points, see Perry, "The Last Safavids".

THE ZAND DYNASTY
the greater Safavid period - was not encouraged until later Zand and early Qajar
times, when the collapse ofcentral government provoked a sometimes violent
assertion of civic responsibility by provincial culama and their urban allies.
Thus, of the Nicmat-Allahis, Nur All Shah was mutilated atMurchakhur inAH
Murad's time, Mushtaq AllShah was killed bya mob in Kirman during Lutf
All Khan's rule and several more were condemned todeath by the mujtahidAqa
Muhammad AHin Kirmanshah up until the early years of Fath All Shah
Qajar.38
The Vakil kept central political control firmly in hisown hands. Despite a
considerable survival ofSafavid court offices and protocol, none ofthe resident
amirs orcivil officials rose tospecial prominence. His vazirs functioned as clerks
and companions of his leisure hours rather than colleagues in government; in
this he followed Nadir's precedent and anticipated Agha Muhammad.
Throughout this period, from AbuDl-Fath Khan's fate in the Isfahan triumvirate
to Hajjl Ibrahim's relationship with first Lutf All Khan and then Agha
Muhammad, it isabundantly clear that the necessary alliance between the tribal
ruler andhisurban bureaucracy was never one of mutual trust.
The raw materials ofKarim's original coalition — the Luri, LakI and Hama
dan plains tribes of the Zand, Vand, Zangana, Kalhur and Qaraguzlu
remained closely connected with the Zand chief after his rise topower, provid
ing more than half of his standing army of Fars while serving also as wardensof
the Zand homeland and the Kurdish and Luri marches. The Zangana in
particular, who governed Kirmanshah throughout this period, were well rep
resented at court, and Haidar Khan was twice sent asambassador to Baghdad.
Control of more distant tribes wasoften largely nominal, the Vakil merely
confirming adefacto chief. Transportation of an insubordinate tribe was applied
only once, against the Bakhtiyari in 1764. The urban centres of tribal territories,
such as Qajar Astarabad andSari, or Mushacshac Shushtar andDizful, were
administered bya local dignitary who was in theory a government-appointed
beglerbegl, but in practice atribal chieftain kept in line by means of hostages and
shows of force. Tribal groups which, like the Zand themselves, had returned
from exile, were welcomed andencouraged to settle in western Iran.
The years from 1722 to 1764 appeared to the townsmen and villagers of Irana
constant vicious circle of military occupation and extortion by a series of
freebooters who used funds squeezed from one area to ravage another. Karim
Khan had to remedy some forty years ofartificial famine and depopulation, to

GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY UNDER THE ZANDS
which hehimself had of necessity contributed during hisstruggle for power. His
approach to this wastypically pragmatic andstraightforward: hispromises were
always kept, his threats never empty. He isnever reported tohave made the
extravagant and hypocritical gesture characteristic ofNadir and his Afsharid
successors in declaring atax amnesty, except in the case of Kirman on evidence
of genuine hardship, nor washe remiss in claiming his dues. He insisted instead
on closely vetting the tax returns ofgovernors and their minions every year.
Those too rapacious would be dismissed and fined. Allgovernment officials, the
beglerbegi ofa province orhakim ofa major town and their subordinates in
administration, were paid a fixed government salary which was reviewed
periodically together with their appointments.39
The Vakil succeeded in repopulating hisdevastated kingdom primarily
through his restoration of internal security and his reputation for justice, rather
than by any overt propaganda. Shici Muslims needed little encouragement to
return from theinsecurity of exile in Iraq, andtheVakil encouraged the growing
influx by active invitations to Christians andJews, themerchants andbankers of
the community, toreturn and settle in thriving Shlraz. One such caravan from
Baghdad in 1763was said to have numbered about 10,000 returning refugees.40
Under Karim Khan Shlraz became thelargest Jewish centre in Iran, and
Armenians were encouraged to resettle round Shlraz and Isfahan by the gift of
complete villages.
The Kustam al-tavarikh provides evidence of the Vakil's active interest inthe
problems ofa depressed agriculture.41 In the autumn of 1189/1775, a severe
famine in Isfahan and Fars obliged Karim to throw open the state granaries for
the relief of the poor. In Isfahan, the grain wassold to thepopulace at a fixed rate
of 100 dinars per man-i TabrJ^ (equivalent to 6|lb); at Shlraz, the shortage was so
acute that grain had to be brought from as far afield as Tehran, Qazvin and even
Azarbaijan, sothat on arrival thecost had soared to 1400 dinars perman. Despite
the urgings of his ministers to cover these expenses, the Vakil insisted on
distributing this grain at the same nominal rate as at Isfahan, and with the aidof
this heavy subsidy the famine was eventually beaten.
Karim Khan's contribution tothe architecture ofShlraz (most ofwhich is
still standing despite four subsequent earthquakes and the destructive malice of
Agha Muhammad Khan when he sacked thetown in 1206/1792) is worth special
mention, less for its artistic merit than as an example of planned urban renewal

THE ZAND DYNASTY
the first since Shah Abbas's re-construction of Isfahan - inspired primarily by
military and political considerations. Having undergone two sieges by the
Qajars, the Vakil's first concern was for thedefences of the sprawling and
poorly-walled city. Over the year 1180/1766-7, the perimeter of\\farsakhs was
cut toone farsakh (about six kilometres) by the demolition ofolder, outlying
buildings andearthworks, andthe amalgamation of several quarters; the
number ofgates was reduced from at least twelve tosix, piercing a stout new
wall with eighty round towers and a broad ditch. The huge labour force
involved was paid from the royal treasury, asin the case ofthe Vakil's other
buildings. These are the argor citadel and the palace complex, the Vakil's bazaar
(still functioning, although bisected bythe main modern thoroughfare), the
Vakil's mosque, and various baths and caravanserais. He also renovated various
shrines and tombs, including those ofShah Shujac, Hafiz and Sacdi. Nor did he
neglect to perpetuate his city's just renown for beautiful gardens, laying out new
complexes inside and outside Shlraz.42
The southward shift inthe political centre ofgravity emphasized the Gulf
and Indian Ocean commerce, which in turn enriched the capital. In addition to
encouraging trade with the European companies, theVakil received two
embassies from the powerful Haidar All ofthe Deccan, about 1184/1769—70
and in 1774.43 The Indians were promised trading facilities at Bandar Abbas,
but the main purpose of these missions may have been to reconcile the Vakil and
the Imam of Muscat, with whom Haidar All was already on good terms, so as to
make the Gulf safer for neutral shipping. AtShiraz the Indian merchants had
their own caravanserai and, like all the wholesalers and retailers of the capital,
benefited from the low rent charged for use of the Vakil's bazaar and
caravanserai.44
Karim's policy of attracting merchants and artisans, and encouragingthe
officers and men ofhis tribal army and their dependants toset up residencein
and around Shlraz, considerably increased its population. Estimates by contem
porary visitors put the figure atbetween 40,000 and 50,000 inhabitants, which
compares very favourably with estimates for ruined Isfahan over thesame
period (between 20,000 and 5 0,000).45 Order and security were well maintained
both within the city and in its environs, as is confirmed by several contemporary
travellers. Niebuhr was assured on hisway to Bushahr by a party of Arab
pilgrims that "nowhere in the world could one travel with such safety as in

Persia".46 The large standing army of Fars, when notoncampaign, was kept
amused bya well-run brothel quarter, the staff of which were in turn heavily
taxed, and thus played their part inthe economic as well as the social scheme of
the Zand metropolis.47
There are more stories told of Karim Khan's kindness, simplicity, generosity
and justice than about any other Iranian monarch. As the archetype of the good
king with a genuine concern for his people he overshadows Khusrau
Anushirvan the Just or Shah cAbbas the Great; where these and other rulers
surpass him inmilitary glory and international prestige, the Zand Khan quietly
retains even today an unparalleled place in his countrymen's affections as a good
man who became and remained a good monarch. Hewas not ashamed of his
humble origin, and was never tempted to seek for himself a more illustrious
pedigree than that ofthe chief ofa hitherto obscure Zagros tribe who had once
lived bybrigandage. Asa poor soldier in Nadir's army he once stole a gold
embossed saddle from outside asaddlery where ithad been left for repair, but on
learning that the saddler had been held responsible forits loss and was to be
hanged, he was smitten by conscience and surreptitiously replaced the saddle.48
As Vakil, he retained his simple tastes in clothes and furniture, and bowed to the
dictates of his station only tothe extent of having abath and achange ofclothes
once amonth, an extravagance that is said to have shocked his fellow-tribesmen.
His physical courage is frequently emphasized, and the history of his campaigns
sufficiently illustrates that what he may cede toNadir Shah inmilitary geniushe
more than recoups in tenacity of purpose andresilience in apparent defeat.
What above all made his reign a success was his closeness tohis subjects, his
identification of his own needs with theirs, and hisconsequent tolerance and
magnanimity shown toall classes. The manifest genuineness ofthis attitude,its
remoteness from any bulwark of assumed piety or disguised self-interest, ensure
him a favourable mention by contemporary writers of every loyalty. He re
mained easy ofaccess for all, setting apart a regular time each day forreceiving
complaints and petitions in thetraditional manner. Traditional, too, washis
indulgence inwine, opium and all-night debauches, though these seem seldom
to have prejudiced hisefficient and humane conduct of government.
Apart from a few arguably ill-considered ventures such asthe wars against
Oman and Ottoman Iraq, the Vakil's military enterprises were of a defensive and
conservative nature. His treasury remained empty by design, as incoming

revenue was ploughed back into the country in the form of buildings and
amenities, wages andpensions, andinternal security. Fixed taxassessmentsand
price controls guaranteed the peasantry subsistence survival with a chance to
improve their lot in good years, and must have mollified their well-founded
distrust of tribal rulers. Karim made it a personal rule notto appropriate
windfalls: just asin hisyears of struggle he distributed booty among his troops
and new allies, soin the period ofconsolidation herefused toconfiscate the
residue ofthose deceased without immediate heir, and when during therebuild

workmen onthe site.49
During his fourteen years of rule from Shiraz, Karim Khan succeeded in
restoring asurprising degree of material prosperity and peace to aland ravaged
and disoriented byhispredecessors. Obviously hisvirtues aregreatly enhanced
by their juxtaposition with the savagery andtyranny of Nadir Shah and Agha
Muhammad Khan, and undeniably thestate he created was disgraced and
destroyed byhisunworthy successors; buthisrare combination of strength and
purpose with common sense and humanity produced, for a brief period in a
particularly bloody and chaotic century, a stable and honest government.

CHAPTER 3
AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN ANDTHE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE QAJAR DYNASTY
THE EMERGENCE OF THE QAJARS
The preceding chapter described the unsuccessful attempt by a small tribal
confederation insouth-west Iran, ledbytheZands, toestablish control over the
other tribal groupings onthe Iranian plateau. Itsfailure wasduetothe limited
number offighting menwhom the Zands and their confederates could muster
for sustained campaigning; thefamily rivalries anddivisions of the ruling house
after Karlm Khan Zand's death in 1193/1779; thesuperior military resourcesof
the Qajars; andnotleast, the single-minded ambition oftheir ultimate nemesis,
Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar. Inthis chapter, hiscareer will be placed within
the context of the rise of the Qajars, one of the original components of the
Safavids' Qizilbash confederacy. For Agha Muhammad Khan's bid foroverall
kingship, the disturbed condition oflate 18th-century Iran proved particularly
favourable.
As for theQajars' early history, there isa late tradition that they were partof
the Turkish Oghuz confederacy, andfirst entered Iran with other Oghuz tribes
in the n t hcentury. However, neither of the surviving lists of Oghuz tribes,
those of Mahmud Kashghari and Rashld al-DIn, include them, although both
mention the Afshars. Conceivably, they were an element in a larger tribe (the
Bayats have been suggested as themost likely), from which they later broke
away. The same late tradition claims an eponymous ancestor for thetribe in
Qajar Noyan, thesonof a Mongol, Sartuq Noyan, who was supposed to be
Atabegto the Il-Khan Arghun. Qajar Noyan was also alleged to beanancestor of
Timur.
If credibility is accorded to such references, early Qajar history might
hypothetically be reconstructed asfollows: with thebreak-up of the Il-Khanate,
following the death of Abu Sacld in 736/1335, the Qajars, already an indepen
dent tribe, moved westwards inthedirection ofSyria orAnatolia, perhaps into
the country around Diyarbakr orErlat. Later, during the 15 th century, possibly
during the reign of the AqQuyunlu ruler, Uzun Hasan (857—82/1453—78), or
that of Yacqiib (883—96/1478—90), the Qajars established themselves in

dancy that the Qajars, like other Oghuz tribes in Azarbaijan andeastern

became murlds (disciples) of the Shaikhs of Ardabll. Allthis, it should be

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
future Shah Ismacil on his triumphant march from Arzinjan to Shirvan in 906/
1500-1,2 and thereafter, they were a conspicuous element of the Qizilbash
confederacy. For the remainder ofthe 16th century, there were few major events
in which one or more Qajar amirs did not play a part, although, in terms of
numbers, the Qajars were among the less prominent Qizilbash tribes.
Probably during the Safavid period, the well-established division between
the two rival branches of the Yukhari-bash and the Ashaqa-bash Qajars
emerged, each further sub-divided into theclans of the Quyunlu, Develu, Izz al
Dinlu, Ziyadlu, etc. The Quyunlu clan of the Ashaqa-bash branch provided the
ruling dynasty of Iran from the late 18thto the early 20th century, while their
erstwhile rivals, theDevelu clan of the Yukhari-bash branch, provided many of
the functionaries and military commanders of the kingdom.
Tradition hasit that, partly because he mistrusted their growing power,and
partly to strengthen his north-eastern frontier against the Uzbeks and
Tiirkmens, Shah cAbbas I divided theQajar tribe, by relocating a large number
of them in northern Khurasan and Gurgan with other Qizilbash and Kurdish
tribes. Themajority were apparently settled in or around Astarabad, although
Aq Qalca on theriver Gurgan was originally their principal habitat.3 In Gurgan
they shared the province with the indigenous Iranian and long-settled Arab
population, aswell aswith other tribal groups, principally Jalayirids and Bayats.
In Khurasan they were to be found in Sabzavar and Turshiz, in Chahcha and
Mekhne between Kalat and Sarakhs, and most importantly, in Marv, where they
shared the oasis with a mixed Iranian, Arab and Tatar population, and consti
tuted the front line of defence against the Uzbeks.
From thetime ofthis division, theQajars in theErivan, Ganja andQarabagh
region gradually disappeared, absorbed by new tribal groups. Those in Marv
survived thearrival into thearea ofthe Yamut Tiirkmens, andalso therepeated
interventions of Nadir Shah into the affairs of the oasis, but finally succumbed
about 1200/178 5to theraids of Shah Murad, theMangit Khan ofBukhara. Thus
only the Qajars of Gurgan proved strong andnumerous enough to retain their
identity during the upheavals following the break-up of the Safavid kingdom
and thetumultuous years of Nadir Shah's rule. They no doubt benefitted from
their isolated location, enjoying limited protection from the north-east by the
Qara-Qum desert, and from the south-west by the swamps and forests of
2 Hasan-i Rumlu, Chronicle,p. 41. 3 Riza QulT Khan,_R^lation, p. 29; Fraser, Narrative, p.620; Rabino, Ma^andaran,p. 86. According
to Riza Qull Khan, Aq Qalca (Mubarakabad) wasdivided into two quarters tokeep the Yukharibash and Ashaqa-bash apart; op.cit., p. 38.

EMERGENCE OF THE QAJARS
Mazandaran and the sweep ofthe Alburz range. Yet their location was not so
remote that they could not easily strike inthe direction ofTehran via Sari and
Fimzkuh, into Rasht along the coast, into Qumis (the Simnan-Damghan
Shahrud area) via Ribat-i Safid and Bistam, or into Khurasan by way of
Khabushan (Quchan), while the wastes of the Qara-Qum never prevented
regular contact with the region of the lower Amu-Darya (Oxus), and provided a
refuge intimes ofcrisis. The Qajars maintained a relationship with the Yamut,
Goklen, and other Turkmen tribes of the Qara-Qum, inwhich trade, occasional
raiding and outright hostilities, marriage and military alliances all played apart.4
As "lords ofthe marches" inthe zone between Turkmen nomadic pastoralism
and Iranian sedentary agriculture, the Qajars maintained an uneasy balance
between thetraditions of the Iranian plateau and those of the steppes.
Fath CA1I Khan, the founder of the fortunes of the Ashaqa-bash Qajars of
Astarabad inthe 18th century, was the son ofa certain Shah Quli Khan of the
Quyunlu Qajars of Ganja. He had made his way to Gurgan and married into the
Quyunlu Qajars of Astarabad. The date of Fath AllKhan's birth is given
variously, ranging from 1097/1685—6 to 1104/1692—3. Before theGhilzai in
vasion of Iran, he was reputed to be amilitary commander of some consequence,
and had once served as hakim ofMashhad. In 1133—4/1720 he had been ordered
to assist anincompetent royal commander inthe pacification ofKhurasan, but
was worsted in battle byMalik Mahmud Sistani and withdrew to his base in
Astarabad. The Afghan siege ofIsfahan in 1134—35/1721—2 may have brought
him out of his retreat,5 but Tahmasp's subsequent flight from the capital offered
Fath All Khan Qajar an opening toprove his loyalty tothe Safavids. Tahmasp
reached thevicinity of Tehran. According to Father Krusinski, the Safavid
forces, onturning back towards Qum to face the pursuing Afghans, included
some Qajar tribesmen, described as "hardy andtrusty Fellows, of approved
Fidelity".6 Tahmasp, short of men andat that time lacking potential allies,
needed the 9,000 fighting men whom, according to Krusinski, theQajars of
Astarabad could muster. Fath CA1IKhan was rewarded with the appointment of
4 Marriage alliances between theQajars and Tiirkmens of the Qara-Qum were by no means uncommon, as in the case of Bahram AIT Khan of Marv, whose mother was aSalor and whose father was a Qajar. See Bukharl, Histoire, p. 58. The vendettas and alliances between the Qajars andthe Tiirkmens were a permanent feature of this period. 5 See p. 14 supra and Krusinski, History 11, p.79. Lockhart rejects the tradition preserved in the
Qajar chronicles, of how Fath CA1IKhan and his followers had previously made their way to Isfahan during the course of the Ghilzai siege andoffered their services to Shah Sultan Husain; here allegedly, theQajar chieftain became an object of jealousy at the Safavid court, andeventually withdrew in disgust.

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
Vtimad al-Daula to Tahmasp, of whose entourage hethus became theleading
member. By joining the Safavid fugitive, he acquired aposition which couldbe
exploited atthe appropriate time. Moreover, Tahmasp's fortunes appeared to be
improving. Russian interest in the Caspian provinces had receded after Peter the
Great's death in 1725. Ashraf the Afghan was embroiled with the Ottomans and
was cut offfrom the Ghilzai base at Qandahar. TheAbdalis in Herat were
preoccupied with their own quarrels. The nearest and least formidable enemy
was Malik Mahmud Sistani, striving tobe master of Khurasan. To campaign
against Malik Mahmud, Tahmasp accompanied Fath All Khan to Astarabad to
collect more troops. The Qajar chieftain became amainstay to Tahmasp and was
appointed his Vakil al-Daula, while other Qajar chieftains were granted lesser
titles (DhuDl-Qacda 1138/July 1726).
The grant of the title and office of Vakil al-Daula confirmed that FathAIT
Khan was thereal power in Tahmasp's camp and setaprecedent followed on
several later occasions: Nadir Khan Afshar adopted the same title in 1144—45/
1732, when he replaced Tahmasp with theeight-month-old A.bbas III; All
Mardan Khan Bakhtiyari assumed itin 1163—4/1750 on behalf of Ismail III; and
Karim Khan Zand likewise, on behalf ofthe same figure-head a year later.
The Safavid Shah and his Qajar supporters set offto capture Mashhad from
Malik Mahmud Sistani, butat Khabushan Tahmasp Qull Khan (later Nadir
Shah) joined them with asmall force of Afshars and Kurds. By the time the army
resumed its march towards Mashhad, this newcomer had completely ingratiated
himself with Tahmasp. When they came within sight ofthe city, the rivalry
between Fath All Khan and Tahmasp Qull Khan was approaching itsclimax.
The circumstances of Fath All Khan's fall remain obscure; he was murdered on
14 Safar 1139/11 October 1726. It is possible that Muhammad Husain Khan
Develu of the Yukharl-bash Qajars ofAstarabad was implicated inthese events;
from this time onwards he became themost prominent figure inthe Gurgan
region.
THE CAREER OF MUHAMMAD HASAN KHAN QAJAR
Fath All Khan's death left his troops inthe Safavid service. They continued to
serve Shah Tahmasp, and after his overthrow, Nadir Shah. Leadership of the
Qajars now shifted from theQuyunlu clan of the Ashaqa-bash branch, to the
Develu clan ofthe Yukhari-bash. The late Fath All Khan had apparently failed
to consolidate his leadership over all the Astarabad Qajars. Muhammad Husain
Khan Develu, who had joined Tahmasp Qull Khan (later Nadir Shah), pros

pered in his service and was rewarded with the rank ofbeglerbegi of Astarabad.
Subsequently, however, Nadir Shah ceased to trust Muhammad Husain Khan
and on one occasion ordered him to dismantle a fort which hehad erected in
Astarabad. Muhammad Husain Khan transferred his loyalty to Nadir's son, Riza
Quli, and during Nadir's absence in India, when rumours ofhis death reached
Iran, Muhammad Husain Khan persuaded Riza QulT to murder the captive
Tahmasp and his two sons, cAbbas and Ismacil, in prison inSabzavar. The Qajar
chieftain himself carried out the deed, with conspicuous brutality, probably in
the latter part of DhuDl-Qacda 1152/February 1740. Following the attempt on
Nadir Shah's life in Safar-Rabic I 1154/May 1741, interrogation ofthe attacker
implicated Muhammad Husain Khan, as well as Riza Quli. However, the former
survived, perhaps because hecombined the office of beglerbegi of Astarabad
with that ofleader of the Qajar contingent inNadir's army. Muhammad Zaman
Khan, his son, acted as his deputy in Astarabad when he was absent with Nadir's
forces. He lived tobe a leader inthe conspiracy which resulted inNadir Shah's
assassination (1160/1747).
Meanwhile, Fath All Khan's surviving son, Muhammad Hasan Khan, had
become a rival to Muhammad Husain Khan. He later proved himself a coura
geous and resourceful leader, butin his youth lacked sufficient manpower to
challenge the prevailing Develu hegemony in Astarabad. Thus he spent his early
years as a fugitive, protected by the Yamut Tiirkmens, who pursued apolicy of
"divide et impera" towards their Qajar neighbours. Itis certain that, atthe time of
the birth of Muhammad Hasan Khan's eldest son, Muhammad (1 Muharram
1155/14 March 1742), he himself was inhiding inthe Qara-Qum desert and the
child's mother, also ofthe Quyiinlu clan, was concealed in the house of Agha
Sayyid Mufid inAstarabad, where the future Shah was brought up as the son of
the sayyid.
Some two years after this, Muhammad Hasan Khan launched anattack on
Astarabad, presumably directed as much against his Develu rival as against
Nadir Shah. Afurther inducement was the presence of part of the royal treasure
in Astarabad. There is no reason to suppose that the attack wasnot long
planned, since Muhammad Hasan Khan had contacted the Safavid pretender,
Sam Mirza. According to the English merchant, Jonas Hanway, the attack
occurred on the 30Dhu 1-Qacda 1156/15 January 1744, only a few days after
Muhammad Hasan Khan had been in the city, presumably for reconnaissance
purposes and toenlist supporters among the entourage ofthe hakim, Muham
mad Zaman Khan, sonof the beglerbegi, Muhammad Husain Khan, then
absent from the province.

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
Aided by2,000 Qajar and other tribal supporters, and 1,000 Yamut auxil
iaries, Muhammad Hasan Khan made aneasy conquest. Muhammad Zaman
Khan fled, and Astarabad passed without a fight into Muhammad Hasan Khan's
possession. Thereafter, however, disaster struck. The Safavid pretender had
been captured even before the uprising took place; approaches to the beglerbegl
of neighbouring Mazandaran, made on the strength of earlier exchanges, were
now rejected; and having acquired a share of the plunder of Astarabad,the
Yamut chieftains lost interest in the enterprise, although not before a quarrel
had broken out over division of the spoils.
Meanwhile, Nadir Shah had ordered Bihbud Khan, sardar of the Atak, to take
the field; he marched on Astarabad and defeated Muhammad Hasan Khan
several stages to the east of the city. Muhammad Hasan Khan fled into the Qara
Qum. Bihbud Khan entered Astarabad where, joined byMuhammad Husain
Khan Develu, he loosed a reign of terror on the Ashaqa-bash Qajars and their
alleged supporters. Hanway records seeing two pyramids of skulls, one consist
ing of Bihbud Khan's victims, and the other of Muhammad Husain Khan's, near
the entrance to the city. IfMuhammad and his mother were still in concealment
in Agha Sayyid Mufid's house, they were lucky that their presence was not
discovered.
Muhammad Hasan Khan accompanied his Yamut allies, recently driven out
of Khwarazm into Manqishlaq, in anattack upon the ruler of Khiva, AbuDl
Ghazi Khan, who was, ashis father, Ilbars Khan, had been, a client of Nadir
Shah. In addition, Khiva was threatened by an uprising of the Salor Turkmens.
AbuDl-GhazI Khan appealed to Nadir Shah for aid. Nadir Shah ordered his
nephew, CA1IQuli Khan (the future cAdil Shah), hakim of Mashhad, and Bihbud
Khan, sardar of the Atak, to assist the Khan of Khiva, and once again
Muhammad Hasan Khan found himself fighting along side the Yamut against
his late father's Afsharid foes. The feud between the Quyunlu Qajars and the
Afsharids, as well as with the Develu Qajars and, later, the Zands, helps to
explain the conduct of Agha Muhammad Khan at a later period. In one
encounter, Muhammad Hasan Khan fought Bihbud Khan single-handed and
wounded him, but he and his Turkmen allies were finally defeated and forced to
flee into the Qara-Qum desert, where Nadir Shah's troops sought them in vain.
Following Nadir Shah's assassination in 1160/1747, Muhammad Hasan
Khan again tried to seize Astarabad. He was again assisted by the Yamut, led by
their chieftain, Bekenj Khan, and later bythe Goklen. This revolt was sup
pressed by Nadir Shah's nephew, CA1I Quli Khan, now reigning as cAdil Shah,
who, having learnt of the existence of Muhammad Hasan Khan's son,
Muhammad, then about six years old and still living in Astarabad, ordered him

THE CAREER OF MUHAMMAD HASAN KHAN QAJAR
to be brought to Mashhad. Heapparently intended to kill the boy, butwas
prevailed upon to spare his life andcastrate himinstead; hence, the later
sobriquet ofAgha (eunuch). Soon after Adil Shah's death (1161/1748), Agha
Muhammad was restored to his family and, forthe next ten years, sharedhis
father's adventurous life. During this period Muhammad Hasan Khan made a
determined effort to become ruler of all Iran.
This ambition was notunrealistic for a tribal chieftain who hadalready
established a reputation for determination and courage. The descendants of
Nadir Shah were weakened by mutual rivalries. Inthe east, the Abdall Afghans
of Ahmad Shah Durrani (1160—87/1747—73) were nominally in possession of
Khurasan, but looked towards the Indus as anatural area for expansion. Inthe
west, the situation was in flux. Isfahan was dominated by All Mardan Khan and
his Bakhtiyaris. In Fars and Luristan, Karim Khan Zand had aformidable tribal
following. In Azarbaljan, the Afghan adventurer, Azad Khan, seemed secure
and able to expand his territory. Muhammad Hasan Khan consolidated his grip
upon Gurgan and Mazandaran, extended his suzerainty into Gilan, and then,in
1164/1751, struck outto relieve All Mardan Khan's forces in Kirmanshah,
which were besieged by Karim Khan Zand. News ofCA1T Mardan Khan's defeat
led Muhammad Hasan Khan towithdraw rapidly towards Astarabad, pursued
by Karim Khan Zand, whobesieged the city (1165/1751-2). Eventually,
Muhammad Hasan Khan, assisted by his Yamut allies, led Karim Khan's forces
into anambush; the Zands withdrew to Tehran, leaving the Safavid puppet,
Ismacll III, a pawn in Muhammad Hasan Khan's hands. Muhammad Hasan
Khan then setabout the recovery of Mazandaran and Gilan, where the local
rulers had abandoned his cause assoon ashis fortunes appeared to beebbing.
In Gilan, Muhammad Hasan Khan showed his determination tobring order
to the region. He found the province particularly torn bya feud betweenthe
rulers of Shaft and Fumin, the former supported by another local ruler, Mirza
ZakI of Gaskar. Since the Shaft-Gaskar faction wasin the ascendant, he
supported the Fumin faction inthe person ofthe young Hidayat-Allah Khan,
whom heappointed governor, although with his own representative to assist
him. After the death ofMuhammad Hasan Khan in 1172/1759, Hidayat-Allah
Khan renounced his Qajar allegiance and submitted to Karim Khan Zand, who
confirmed his appointment, but left him to his own devices. He maintained a
refined court inRasht, financed by the silk industry and the sea trade between
Enzeli and Astrakhan. However, he was treacherous and bloodthirsty, even by
the standards of the age, and hiseventual overthrow by Muhammad Hasan
Khan's son and political heir, Agha Muhammad Khan, passed unmourned.
In 1168/175 5, Muhammad Hasan Khan added tohis growing reputation by

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
defeating an Abdali army near Sabzavar. Then in 1169/1756, he advanced
towards Isfahan, defeated the troops of Karim Khan Zand at Gulnabad, and
occupied the former Safavid capital, where he had gold coins struck in his name.
He then advanced toShiraz, only toturn back atthe news that Azad Khan was
advancing from Azarbaijan. Acomplicated series ofmanoeuvres followed, in
which Muhammad Hasan Khan eventually made a triumphant progress
through Gilan, Talish and across Azarbaijan to Azad's stronghold of Urmlya,
while Azad fled into Ottoman territory. This year of1170/1756-7 was the peak
of his career, commemorated by gold coins struck as far apart as Tabriz, where
he left Agha Muhammad Khan as his deputy, and Yazd. By RablT-RabiTI 1171/
December 1757, he was again in Isfahan, whence he set out for Shiraz finally to
defeat his Zand rival. But now his luck turned. The countryside around Shiraz
had been laid waste, sothat his army lacked forage, while Karim Khan, safe
behind the walls of Shiraz, refused to give battle. Eventually, Muhammad Hasan
Khan was compelled toretreat (Shawwal 1171/July 1758), with Karim Khan's
most skilful general, Shaikh CA1IKhan, in pursuit. As he entered Mazandaran to
seek refuge in Astarabad, he was hampered by treachery among his own
followers, especially Muhammad Husain Khan Develu, and was forced to give
battle in the least favourable circumstances. Always acourageous fighter, inthe
end he was struck down by alife-long foe, Muhammad Khan of Savadkuh, as he
tried to effect his escape (15 Jumada 1172/12 February 1759).
Karim Khan Zand subsequently entered Astarabad and seized the treasure
there. He realized that he could not control this distant province without strong
local backing and appointed the experienced Muhammad Husain Khan Develu
as beglerbegi. In thus elevating the Develu Qajars, he assured the decline of their
Quyunlu kin, but he left nothing tochance. Muhammad Hasan Khan's eldest
son, Agha Muhammad Khan, had escaped after hisfather's death, butwas
eventually captured and taken to captivity in Shiraz, where he was later joined by
his full-brother, Husain Quli Khan, andwhere hispaternal aunt, Khadija
Begum, already a member of Karim Khan's harem, proved an invaluable
support. Two other sons, Murtaza Quli Khan and Mustafa Quli Khan, were
allowed toremain inAstarabad, because their mother was the sister of Karim
Khan's appointee as beglerbegi. Muhammad Hasan Khan's remaining sons,
Riza Quli, Jacfar Quli, Mahdl Quli and CA1I Quli (cAbbas Quli died about this
time), were sent to Qazvln, where they were confined to a family property,
although Jafar Quli and CA1I Quli were later permitted to join Agha
Muhammad Khan in Shiraz. Karim Khan's treatment of his defeated rival's
family was unusually humane forthe period.

THE CAREER OF MUHAMMAD HASAN KHAN QAJAR
Agha Muhammad Khan remained almost twenty years a hostage in Shiraz.
Karim Khan accorded him consideration and even sought his advice, acknowl
edging his skill in political matters. Itwas nonetheless a long and bitter exile, but
it allowed Agha Muhammad to acquire an intimate knowledge of his hosts, and
perhaps to foresee thedivisions amongst theZands which followed Karim
Khan's death. Moreover, he had, in Khadija Begum, a confidante in Karim
Khan's harem, tokeep him informed about court intrigue, and later help himto
escape as soon as Karim Khan died.
Karim Khan sent Agha Muhammad Khan's brother, Husain Quli Khan,
north again as hakim of Damghan (Shawwal 1182/February 1769). It later
proved disastrous forthe maintenance ofZand control in Qumis. With Agha
Muhammad Khan a eunuch, Husain Quli Khan was next in line for leadership of
the Quyunlu Qajars; thus he was bound to act as acounterweight to the Develu
Qajars in the vicinity of the tribal homeland. Once established in Damghan,
however, Husain Quli Khan, seeking vengeance against his late father's Develu
and other foes, behaved with such ferocity that Karim Khan was forced to
intervene. He was finally murdered near Findarisk, east ofAstarabad, by some
Yamut Tiirkmens with whom he was feuding (c. 1191/i777). By then, his wife,
an cIzz al-Dinlu Qajar, had given birth to Fath All (the future Fath All Shah), as
well as another son, also named Husain Quli.
On 13Safar 1193/1 March 1779, Karim Khan died and Agha Muhammad
Khan escaped from Shiraz to Mazandaran. These two events mark the end of an
epoch. During the half century of turbulent history which separated the
elevation ofFath Ail Khan as Vakilal-Daula ofTahmasp II in 1138-39/1726,
from Agha Muhammad Khan's return to his homeland, the history of the Qajars
had been one of struggle. This was partly the result of their own internecine
rivalries and partly the result of the recognition, first by the Afsharids and then
by the Zands, that the Qajars posed aserious threat to their own ambitions. Yet
for a brief period between 1164— 5/1751 and 1172—3/1759, Muhammad Hasan
Khan had nearly acquired control over wide areas of northern, western and
central Iran, and seems to have behaved asmore than a mere tribal khan.He
apparently obtained part of Nadir's treasure after 1159—60/1747, which must
have enabled him torule insome opulence. At Ashraf, where he held court,he
repaired the Safavid palace and engaged invarious public works: abridge over
the Babul, for example, anda mosque at Barfarush. He also struck coins,
evidence of a claim to sovereignty. Hence, when Agha Muhammad Khan began,
in 1192—3/1779, the process whereby he eventually brought all Iran under his
control, he was not so much aspiring to new goals as fulfilling those of his father.

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
Unlike Muhammad Hasan Khan, however, Agha Muhammad Khan solvedthe
two problems which ledtohisfather's downfall: theself-destructive rivalry of
the leading Qajar clans, andtheacquisition of a broad base of support from
among the northern and north-western tribes which could off-set the strengthof
the tribes of the south andsouth-west. Thesolution of these two problems
enabled him toachieve thepolitical consolidation which hadeluded hisimme
diate predecessors — Ghilzais, Afsharids, Zands, andhisown father — sincethe
fall of the Safavid kingdom.
AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN QAJAR: THE CONSOLIDATION OF POWER
(H93-I204/1779-89)
Agha Muhammad Khan's career may bedivided into four phases. First, his early
years and confinement inShiraz, which ended in 1193/1779, when hewas thirty
seven. Secondly, a period of about six years from 1193/177910 1199—1200/178 5,
during which heconsolidated his power-base inthe Alburz region and extended
his control over much ofnorthern and north-western Iran, incompetition with
All Murad Khan Zand. The third phase, between 1199—1200/1785 and 1208—9/
1794, began with thewresting ofTraq-i Ajam (central Iran), from the Zands,
and ended with theconquest ofFars and Kirman, and thedeath ofLutf All
Khan Zand. In the fourth phase, between 1208—9/1794 and 1211—12/1797, Agha
Muhammad Khan, now master ofthe greater part ofthe Iranian plateau and of
the territory formerly controlled bytheZands, ravaged the erstwhile Safavid
province of Gurjistan (Georgia) in response to theintransigence of its ruler,
proclaimed himself Shah, and conquered Khurasan. Atthe time ofhis death,he
was planning campaigns against Herat, Bukhara, orpossibly Baghdad.
In 1192—3/1779, Agha Muhammad Khan hadlong been absent from his
native province. After escaping from Shiraz, hemet the leading Develu khansin
the Varamin district and healed theancient family feud which hadbeen a major
cause ofthe Qajars' misfortunes. Hethen visited theshrine of Shah Abd al
cAzim, where his father's skull was buried, and from there entered Mazandaran.
He first had to establish hisauthority among hisQuyunlu brothers andhalf
brothers. Two, inparticular, Riza QulT and Murtaza Quli, challenged him, but in
a battle fought on 15 Rabic I 1193/2 April 1779, he routed them and took
Mazandaran. Murtaza Quli, however, withdrew toAstarabad, where he con
solidated his position. Agha Muhammad Khan could notdislodge him andhad
to tread warily, since aconflict with Murtaza Quli, whose mother was a Develu,
would threaten thefragile alliance hehadachieved between theQuyunlu and

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN QAJAR
Develu clans. Also, amore immediate threat presented itself: acombined Zand
Afghan army sent by cAli Murad Khan Zand andcommanded by Mahmud
Khan, sonof Azad Khan Afghani. Agha Muhammad's loyal brother, Jacfar
Qull, led the Qajars against this force and repulsed it. Agha Muhammad's hold
on Mazandaran was temporarily secure.
He now established himself at Barfarush (Babul), with Fath All and Husain
Qull, sons of his late brother, Husain Qull, towards whom he wasalready
displaying marked favour. Shortly after, his brother, Riza Qull, resentful thathe
lacked an apanage, leda band of Lahijanis against Barfarush, seized the palace
and captured Agha Muhammad Khan. When the news reached Astarabad,
Murtaza Qull raised a force of Qajars and Tiirkmens, marched on Sariand
released Agha Muhammad Khan. Riza Qull Khan and Agha Muhammad were
reconciled, but the former, still dissatisfied, fled to the feuding Zands. At first,
he sought help from AllMurad Khan in Isfahan, then from Sadiq Khan in
Shiraz, but neither realized his hopes, and heeventually died in Khurasan.His
former supporters joined Agha Muhammad Khan and were employed against
Murtaza Qull Khan, who now hoped to capture Mazandaran, but Agha
Muhammad Khan's troops defeated him in a succession of engagements,and
thereafter the twobrothers reached an understanding: Murtaza Qull Khan's
position was confirmed as de facto ruler of Astarabad andhe was granted the
revenue of several districts in Mazandaran.
These Qajar squabbles, and the gradual emergence of Agha Muhammad
Khan as sole ruler of Mazandaran, provoked All Murad Khan Zand into
attempting toinvade that province, but Agha Muhammad Khan advanced from
Barfarush with aforce ofQajar cavalry and Mazandarani tufangchis (musketeers)
to drive theinvaders back towards Tehran. Hethen occupied all Qumisand
appointed governors inSimnan, Damghan, Shahrud and Bistam. These actions
south of the Alburz enhanced hisprestige andprovided plunder andassign
ments with which to reward his followers, especially his numerous siblings.
Thus, AllQull Khan, who hadassisted him in theconquest of Qumis,was
given Simnan as a sqyiirghal, a land grant in lieu of salary or pension.7 Agha
Muhammad returned to Astarabad to renew the various agreements already
made with Murtaza Qull Khan andother members of his family.
In the same year, 1195/1781, Agha Muhammad Khan for the first time
encountered the Russians. TheRussian government, interested in opening a
direct trade-route with India, had sent Count Voinovich toestablish a "factory"
7 See chapter 13, p.489, forfurther discussion of this and related terms.

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
on the south-eastern shores ofthe Caspian. The Count appeared with a flotilla
off the coast of Gurgan and applied for permission to establish atrading-post at
Ashraf, then a favourite residence of Agha Muhammad Khan, rebuilt in1193/
1779 on his return from Shiraz. Agha Muhammad Khan refused this request,
but Voinovich proceeded to establish atemporary settlement atQaraduvin and
on the off-shore Ashurada islands. Lacking a fleet, Agha Muhammad Khan
could not prevent this, butwas determined that the occupation shouldnot
become permanent. He persuaded the Russian commander and his officers to
visit him in Astarabad, where they were seized and held hostage until Voinovich
sent orders to his men onAshurada to dismantle the buildings and leave.
This experience with the Russians may have prompted Agha Muhammad
Khan's decision to invade Gllan in 1196/1782 since its ruler, Hidayat-Allah
Khan, seemed towelcome contacts with Russian traders, who frequented the
bazaars of Enzeli and Rasht. Agha Muhammad Khan regarded the Russian
presence in Gllan with suspicion and had other reasons for marching into Gllan.
It was a flourishing province. Itsruler drew substantial revenue from the silk
industry and seatrade with Russia. Hidayat-Allah Khan's accumulation of
treasure doubtless provoked Agha Muhammad Khan's greed. He also had a
grievance against the khan. Originally appointed ruler of Gllan by Muhammad
Hasan Khan Qajar, Hidayat-Allah Khan had betrayed theQajar cause and
become a client of the Zands.
The Qajar troops met with no resistance on entering Gllan, while Hidayat
Allah Khan made ashow of compliance by sending two emissaries, Mirza Sadiq,
his munajjim-bashi(chief astrologer) andAgha Sadiq of Lahijan, to sue for
favourable terms. But Hidayat-Allah Khan didnottrust Agha Muhammad
Khan and left Gllan by sea for Shirvan. The Qajar army plundered Rasht and
Agha Muhammad secured ample treasure. His followers could be richlyre
warded. Elated byvictory, hesent his brother, Jacfar Quli Khan, to conquer
Khamsa, the region south ofthe Alburz extending westwards from Qazvln to
the borders of Azarbaijan, with Zanjan as its administrative centre. Jacfar Quli
Khan defeated a Zand force in the vicinity of Ray or Karaj and occupied Qazvln.
He then proceeded to Zanjan, soon capturing that city. Agha Muhammad Khan
joined him at Sultanlya, with therest of the army from Gllan. During the
following years, however, Hidayat-Allah Khan re-established himself without
difficulty asruler of Gllan, while the Qajars were occupied elsewhere.
Between Khamsa to the west, and Qumis to the east, lay the country around
Tehran which had long served as a Zand outpost, threatening the Qajar
homelands in Mazandaran and Gurgan. During 1197/1783, therefore, Agha
116

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN QAJAR
Muhammad Khan decided toeliminate this menace by besieging Tehran and
evicting its garrison, but without success. Plague first swept the town, and then
the besiegers' camp, so that he had tomarch his ailing troops off towardsAIT
Bulagh (Chashma All), near Damghan.
In the following year, 1198/1784, Agha Muhammad Khan met the greatest
challenge of his career so far. Five years had passed since his flight from Shiraz,
and in that time he had done much to end the feuds which had hitherto hindered
Qajar ambitions. Not only had he asserted his authority among his kinsmen, but
had gained control ofboth the northern and southern foothills ofthe Alburz,
apart from the environs of Tehran. His threat to Zand control ofthe plateau
could notbeignored. All Murad Khan Zand, in retaliation forthe Qajars'
attack on Tehran the previous year, sent alarge army to Mazandaran under the
command of his son, Shaikh Vais Khan. The notables of Mazandaran hastened
to submit, while Agha Muhammad Khan, abandoned byallbut a handful of
followers, retreated to Astarabad, where he strengthened the fortifications.
Murtaza Quli Khan, fearing that his property in Mazandaran was being ravaged
by the invaders, and probably considering Agha Muhammad Khan's position
hopeless, joined the Zands. Apparently encouraged by this defection, All
Murad Khan sent additional forces into Mazandaran to advance against
Astarabad. The Zand troops, under the command of Muhammad Zahir Khan,a
kinsman ofAll Murad Khan, laid siege to Astarabad, but neglected their lines of
communication. InAstarabad, Agha Muhammad Khan had prepared plentiful
supplies. Daily skirmishing below the walls devastated the surrounding
countryside so that the Zands needed supplies from Mazandaran, butAgha
Muhammad Khan sent out raiding parties toattack the inadequately guarded
route along which the Zands' provisions had to come. When the besiegers'
plight was desperate, Agha Muhammad Khan sallied out from behind his walls
and dispersed them. Muhammad Zahir Khan fled towards the Qara-Qum, was
captured by the Qajars' Yamut allies, and was handed over to Agha Muhammad
Khan for execution. Few Zand soldiers found their way back to Mazandaran,
and Agha Muhammad Khan's forces were soon in hot pursuit. Near Ashraf, he
defeated the dispersed the principal Zand garrison inMazandaran and pressed
on toSari, the capital. By the beginning of 1199/November 1784, Mazandaran
was free of the invaders. cAli Murad Khan raised fresh troops and sent them
north under the command of his cousin, Rustam Khan Zand, but they were
repulsed by a Qajar army commanded by Jacfar Quli Khan. CA1TMurad Khan
died not long after, on 1 Rabf II 1199/11 February 1785. Assoon as Agha
Muhammad Khan heard the news, he ordered his troops to advance on Tehran.

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
Outside Tehran, Agha Muhammad Khan prepared for asiege, but there then
occurred an incident highly indicative of the prevailing attitude of the times.
During thepreceding fifteen years, Tehran, which was strongly walled,had
changed hands ona number of occasions, but had remained a bastion of Zand
hegemony inthe north. At the approach ofAgha Muhammad Khan's army, the
Tehranis closed their gates and sent out amessage tothe effect that, since Jacfar
Khan Zand was now ruler inIsfahan, they regarded him astheir sovereign and
were hisobedient servants, adding, however, that they would obey whomso
ever actually occupied the throne. Agha Muhammad Khan was thus to under
stand that were he todefeat Jacfar Khan, these people would acknowledge him
as their sovereign. Heimmediately setofffor Isfahan. Jacfar Khan Zand sent
troops tointercept him, but they turned back at Qum without giving battle. A
larger Zand force then advanced as far as Kashan, only to be defeated at
Nusratabad, north-west of the city. As soon as news of this disaster reached
Jacfar Khan Zand, hefled to Shiraz. Agha Muhammad Khan entered Isfahan,
where he found the remaining Zand treasure, and the khan's harem. The Qajar
army plundered the city, still the largest and probably the richest inthe country.
During the summer of 1199/1785, Agha Muhammad Khan made Isfahan his
base while he dealt with Traq-i A jam, enforcing the submission of Ahmad
Khan, another son ofAzad Khan Afghani, who had been Zand commander at
Nusratabad, and that of the Bakhtiyari Khans. In Isfahan, he appointed a
beglerbegi who had held the same office under All Murad Khan Zand and who,
at thelatter's death, hadproclaimed himself Shah until imprisoned by Jacfar
Khan Zand. Agha Muhammad Khan released him and, judging him reliable, re
appointed him. Having made these arrangements, he left for Tehran; he had
proved himself worthy of the Tehranis' obedience by deposing Jafar Khan
Zand andcapturing theformer capital of the kingdom. The Pazuki Kurdish
chieftain, Majnun Khan, was sent ahead to receive the city's submission, while
the main army moved westwards toHamadan, where anumber ofKurdish and
Turkish tribal chieftains submitted or renewed allegiance formerly given.
Agha Muhammad Khan entered Tehran, which was henceforth to be the
Qajar capital, on 11 Jumada I 1200/12 March 1786. From this time, heseems to
have regarded himself as ruler ofIran, although he refrained from assuming the
title of Shah.
Jacfar Khan Zand still ruled in Shiraz, and once he had ascertained that Agha
Muhammad Khan was back inthe north, he marched on Isfahan. An attempt to
defend the city bythe Qajar beglerbegf failed and following itscapture, a Zand
governor was appointed. Detachments were sent forward to occupy Kashan and

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN QAJAR
Qum, while Jacfar Khan himself took the road to Hamadan. Here, however, an
alliance of local tribal leaders, including Khusrau Khan, the Vali of Ardalan and
Muhammad Husain Khan Qaraguzlu, attacked and defeated him. Jacfar Khan
Zand retired toIsfahan. By now, however, Agha Muhammad Khan had learnt
of the loss of Isfahan, and was rapidly marching southwards. Jacfar Khan
abandoned Isfahan a second time and fell back upon Shiraz. Agha Muhammad
Khan reoccupied Isfahan without difficulty, appointed his brother, Jacfar Qull
Khan, as beglerbegi, left him with a strong garrison, and then marched inthe
direction of Gulpaygan to receive the formal submission of the Vali of Ardalan.
Khusrau Khan. The latter had followed his tribal alliance's rout of Jacfar Khan
Zand by advancing as far as Mala°ir, and thence to Gulpaygan. Here they halted
and Khusrau Khan sent all the booty and prisoners taken in the recent battle near
Hamadan to Agha Muhammad Khan, with a letter of submission. Agha
Muhammad Khan acknowledged the Vali's homage and sent him gifts and the
grant of the districts ofSunqur and KulnVi. The submission of so important a
chieftain was anotable event. From this year, 1200/1786, the alliance, initiated
long before in the lifetime of Muhammad Hasan Khan Qajar, between the Qajar
dynasty and the ValTs of Ardalan, wasreinforced by periodical dynastic
marriages.
News of a revolt by the governor ofZanjan now forced Agha Muhammad
Khan to turn north again. The rebellious governor was pardoned and Agha
Muhammad Khan made a triumphal entry into Tehran, but Gilan was requiring
his attention. Since the Qajars' first invasion in 1196-7/1782, Hidayat-Allah
Khan had returned tohis province, apparently with Russian assistance. Agha
Muhammad Khan considered thewhole Caspian coast to be threatened by
Hidayat-Allah Khan's dalliance with the Russians. He was not himself averseto
allowing Russian merchants to trade in his territory. He did so at Mashhad-i Sar
in Mazandaran, but their movements were strictly regulated and he was deter
mined not to grant them privileged status or special concessions, as Hidayat
Allah Khan had done. He had not forgotten the Voinovich affair of1195—6/
1781. In any case, Hidayat-Allah Khan's return to Rasht was an open challenge
to Qajar hegemony inthe north and initself, sufficient cause forwar. Fortu
nately for Agha Muhammad Khan, Hidayat-Allah had many enemies; he had for
years participated in the feuds characteristic of the ruling families in Gilan.
The second invasion of Gilan in 1200/1786 proved as easy as the first. Such
support asHidayat-Allah Khan had previously enjoyed melted away. On the
march to Rasht, Agha Muhammad enlisted in his service Mahdi Beg
Khalcatbari, ruler of Tunakabun, a former appointee of Karim Khan Zand along

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
with other defectors. The Russian consul in Gilan, supposedly an ally of
Hidayat-Allah Khan, betrayed him bysupplying the Qajars with arms. Recog
nizing the futility offurther resistance, Hidayat-Allah Khan boarded a Russian
ship at Enzeli, bound for Shirvan or Lankaran, butwas handed over to Agha
AIT ofShaft (or, according toadifferent source, another local ruler with whom
he was feuding), who killed him toavenge the massacre ofhis family some years
before. Gilan was now absorbed into theQajar kingdom. Agha Muhammad
Khan didnotregard the Russian settlements at Rasht or Enzeli as sacrosanct.
The local Russian officials had shown themselves to be treacherous in their
dealings with the late Hidayat-Allah Khan; nodoubt Agha Muhammad Khan
was shrewd enough toassess the value of their friendship, despite their protesta
tions ofgood will. Apart from the actual annexation ofthe province, the most
important gain was the great treasure found inthe late ruler's palace. Enough is
known of Agha Muhammad Khan's character for itto be evident that this would
mean more to him than thefriendship of unreliable Russian officials. In any
event, an aspiring Iranian conqueror needed gold with which tobind men tohis
service andrecruit fresh followers.
It is clear that 1199—1200/1785—6 was Agha Muhammad Khan's annus
mirabilis. During that period, hehad gained control of Traq-i Ajam, Isfahan,
Tehran and Gilan, had driven the Zand ruler, Jacfar Khan, back to Shiraz, and,
in all but name, had became Shah. Aperiod ofrelative inactivity followed these
triumphs before Agha Muhammad Khan turned south again. Meanwhile, Jacfar
Khan Zand moved into the Kuhgiluya country and occupied Bihbahan, while
sending Zand troops toMuhammara, later named Khurramshahr, topunish the
Banu Kacb for disloyalty. After celebrating Nauruz in 1201/1787 in Bihbahan,
he returned in triumph to Shiraz, where he learnt that thegovernor of Yazd,
Taqi Khan, had revolted. He gathered as large a force as possible and moved to
Yazd, where Taqi Khan was strengthening the city's fortifications. Taqi Khan
also applied to the ruler ofTabas, Amir Muhammad Khan, forassistance. The
Zand army wassoon encamped below the walls of Yazd, but,after several
assaults had been repulsed, the unexpected arrival ofthe Khan ofTabas and his
troops induced panic among the besiegers, whose army dispersed, leaving Amir
Muhammad Khan to plunder the Zand camp at his leisure. He obtained a vast
booty which included Jacfar Khan's tents, baggage and theentire siege-train.
Amir Muhammad Khan with hisfollowers andsome of Taqi Khan's,the
Zand artillery and the wealth obtained from Jacfar Khan's camp, now tookthe
road to Isfahan, recruiting additional cavalry from thedistricts of Kuhpaya,
NaJm, and Ardistan en route. Thegovernor of Isfahan, Jacfar Quli Khan,

THE STRUGGLE WITH LUTF °ALI KHAN ZAND
probably expected an attack by Jacfar Khan Zand from the south; not one from
the east by an obscure ruler in the Dasht-i Lut. Nevertheless, he quickly marched
out against Amir Muhammad Khan, scattered his troops and seized his train and
artillery. At this juncture Agha Muhammad Khan decided to head southwards.
He joined his brother in Isfahan in 1202/1788, despatched his nephew, Fath rAli
Khan to obtain the submission ofTaql Khan inYazd, and set offhimself to
chastise the Qashqa°i, who withdrew into the mountains to avoid a battle.
However, the Qajar army pressed on to within sixty-five miles ofShlraz. Agha
Muhammad Khan probably hoped tolure Jacfar Khan Zand from behind his
formidable walls and bring him to battle. But Jacfar Khan would not be drawn,
and Agha Muhammad Khan returned to Isfahan where, having replaced Jacfar
Quli Khan with his youngest brother, CA1I Quli Khan, he was rejoined by Fath
All Khan, who had defeated Taqi Khan of Yazd. Agha Muhammad Khan then
set offfor Tehran.
With Agha Muhammad Khan having gone north again, Jacfar Khan Zand
began to prepare yetanother expedition against Isfahan. CA1I Quli Khan,
learning of this, sent aforce of Qaraguzlu tribesman to hold Qumishah, but the
advancing Zand army worsted them. CA1I Quli Khan thereupon withdrew to
Kashan, leaving Isfahan open to JaLfar Khan Zand. This was aserious set-back
for the Qajars, and Agha Muhammad Khan advanced by forced marches from
Tehran to Isfahan, causing Jacfar Khan to flee back to Shlraz. Qajar rule was re
established in Isfahan, but Agha Muhammad withdrew to Tehran again, as if not
yet confident that he could succeed against Jacfar Khan on his own ground and
in so hostile a countryside asFars. But on 25 Rabic II 1203/23 January 1789,
Jafar Khan was assassinated. A four-month civil war followed in which various
contenders among the Zand ruling family competed for the succession. This
struggle ended with Lutf CA1I Khan's triumphant entry into Shlraz in Shaman
Ramadan 1203/May 1789. Agha Muhammad Khan seems tohave considered
that, Jacfar Khan having been replaced by the inexperienced Lutf cAli Khan, the
time had come to eliminate the Zands.
THE STRUGGLE WITH LUTF A LI KHAN ZAND
Agha Muhammad Khan now advanced on Shlraz. When he was about eight
miles north-west of the city, Lutf CA1I Khan intercepted him. An inconclusive
battle was fought on 12 Shawwal 1203/25 June 1789. Lutf CAH Khan withdrew
into ShTraz, where Agha Muhammad Khan besieged him until 18 Dhui-Hijja/7
September. He then struck camp and returned toTehran, where he remained
121

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
until the following Nauruz. On 3 Ramadan 1204/17 May 1790, he again set out
for Shiraz. In western Fars, the governor ofBihbahan submitted to him, but
Lutf CA1IKhan responded by again leading his troops out of Shiraz. This time no
confrontation occurred. Agha Muhammad withdrew to the north-west to settle
the affairs of Qazvln and Khamsa, while Lutf CA1IKhan unsuccessfully attacked
Kirman. An incident then occurred which mayhave determined Agha
Muhammad Khan's later attitudes to those around him. There was hitherto little
in Agha Muhammad Khan's career to suggest that hewas more ferocious or
brutal than his contemporaries. Hitherto, his staunchest supporter had been his
brother, Jacfar QulT Khan, who had apparently assumed that he would eventu
ally succeed Agha Muhammad Khan ashead ofthe Qajar tribe, but who was
becoming restless since hehad not been formally designated heir. Moreover,
Agha Muhammad Khan obviously favoured his nephew, Fath cAli Khan, son of
the late Husain Quli Khan. A quarrel arose between the brothers, and Agha
Muhammad Khan ordered Jacfar Quli Khan's execution (1205/1790—1). Agha
Muhammad Khan presumably considered his brother's death anecessity, since
he was aware, from his familiarity with Zand family rivalries, how a dynasty
could disintegrate through fratricidal conflict.
The news of Lutf CA1IKhan's failure at Kirman allowed Agha Muhammad to
concentrate on theproblems of Azarbaijan. Heappointed Fath CA1I Khan
beglerbegi of Traq-i cAjam as far as the northern border of Fars, and advanced
into Azarbaijan in the spring of1206/1791. He halted at Tarum on the Safid Rud
and sent his close relative and confidant, Sulaiman Khan Quyunlu, to subjugate
Talish. Meanwhile, he himself moved on toSarab, where the governor, Sadiq
Khan, chief of the Shaqaqi Kurds, had shown hostility. From there he
proceeded to Ardabil to visit the shrine, and then entered Qarajadagh, where he
destroyed all opposition, and appointed the Dunbull Kurdish chieftain, Husain
Quli, governor of Khiiy and Tabriz.
While Agha Muhammad Khan was pacifying thenorth-west, important
events had occurred in the south. Lutf cAli Khan Zand and histroops had
marched north to attack Fath CA1I Khan, who was encamped atQumishah, and
advanced onIsfahan. Taking advantage of Lutf CA1I Khan's departure, Hajjl
Ibrahim, the kalantar ofFars, seized Shiraz, while his brother staged a mutiny
among Lutf cAli Khan's troops. Lutf CA1I Khan hurried back toShiraz, onlyto
find its gates closed to him, and his officers' families held hostage in the citadel.
He thereupon withdrew into the mountains between Kazarun and the Persian
Gulf, where hegathered sufficient forces to attempt the recapture of Shiraz.
Hajjl Ibrahim apparently staged this coupwith no further end in view than to

necessitated a change ofplan. Hajji Ibrahim sent anenvoy to Agha Muhammad
Khan, then inKhamsa returning from Azarbaijan, offering agift of 3,000 mares,
formerly Zand property, and requesting onbehalf of the people ofFars that he
become their ruler. For Agha Muhammad Khan, this wasan unanticipated
opportunity tobring about both the conquest ofFars and the final destruction of
the Zands. He promptly accepted the offer, appointed Hajji Ibrahim beglerbegi
in Fars, despatched an officer to Shiraz to seize Zand property there and bring
Lutf cAli Khan's family to Tehran, and ordered Fath cAli Khan to have troops
stationed in Abada ready to assist Hajji Ibrahim if necessary.
Meanwhile, Lutf All Khan had defeated the troops sent against him by Hajji
Ibrahim and had seized the fort at Kazarun. He had advanced to thevicinity of
Shiraz and waspreparing tostarve his former capital into submission. Inside the
city, Hajji Ibrahim found that some of the tribal levies, while willing toacquiesce
in the removal of Lutf All Khan, had expected his replacement by another
Zand. Hajji Ibrahim was toofar committed against thelate ruling house to be

able to compromise on this issue. Hedisarmed troops still loyal to the Zands by a
ruse and expelled them from the city. They promptly joined Lutf All Khan's
forces, but their lack of weapons made them less useful than would otherwise
have been the case. Nevertheless, Lutf CA1TKhan began to gain ground again,
being in control of virtually all the districts around Shiraz. He attempted
negotiation with Hajji Ibrahim, even offering to retire with his family, now in
the latter's hands, to India or Ottoman territory. Hajji Ibrahim rejected these
terms and sent a message to Abada, requesting that Qajar troops come to Shiraz
by a circuitous route. These beat off the first Zand troops sent against them, but
were defeated when Lutf All Khan took the field in person. Hajji Ibrahim
remained safe in Shiraz, but Lutf All Khan held the surrounding countryside.
As soon as Agha Muhammad Khan learnt that the troops from Abada had
suffered a reverse and that Hajji Ibrahim's situation was desperate, he sent 7,000
horsemen, together with the remaining forces at Abada, to join the Hajji. Lutf
All Khan allowed these reinforcements to reach Shiraz, probably (as the
historian Fasa°I suggests) anticipating that once the garrison was strengthened,
it would emerge from the city and could be destroyed in open battle. Hewas
correct in this, for shortly afterwards an engagement was fought to the west of
Shiraz, and he triumphed over the combined forces of Hajji Ibrahim and his
Qajar auxiliaries. This was late in 1205—6/1791, or early in 1206—7/1792. The
Shlrazls were now suffering severely from the siege, and it wasdoubtful whether
they could hold out. Much of Fars was devastated by the fighting, and for three
or four years locusts had plagued the countryside. Although Lutf All Khan's
troops suffered almost as much as those of Hajji Ibrahim, some of the latter were
beginning to defect to the Zands. Agha Muhammad Khan therefore mustered as
large a force as possible and himself advanced into Fars. On 14 Shawwal 1206/5
June 1792,Lutf All Khan, with a handful of troops, made a desperate night
attack on Agha Muhammad Khan's camp near Persepolis. It seemed successful:
Lutf All Khan was assured that the Qajars were routed. Elated by this success,
he allowed his troops to scatter and rested for the night, only to discover at first
light that Agha Muhammad Khan still held the field. He then fled, via Niriz and
Kirman, to Tabas.
Agha Muhammad Khan entered Shiraz on 1 Dhu3l-Hijja 1207/21 July 1792
and remained there for a month, holding court in the Bagh-i Vakil (cf. p. 906).
Before leaving for Tehran (11 Muharram 1207/29 August 1792) he confirmed
Hajji Ibrahim as beglerbegl of Fars and exhumed the body of Karlm Khan Zand
to be sent to Tehran with gates of the Vakil's palace. He also carried off
surviving members of the Zand family. In the spring of the following year, he

THE STRUGGLE WITH LUTF ALI KHAN ZAND
returned to Shiraz, and asserted his hold over the city more brutally. Hajjl
Ibrahim and other supporters of the Qajars were granted titles and favours, but
all the notables ofthe province, including Hajjl Ibrahim, were compelled to
surrender women and children as hostages. He also ordered the destruction of
the citadel and the outer walls of Shiraz before leaving for Tehran on 14
Muharram 1208/23 August 1793.
While Agha Muhammad Khan consolidated his hold over Fars, Lutf All
Khan was still afugitive. From Tabas, with the assistance of the local khan, he
marched onYazd and dispersed such forces asopposed him there. He then
captured Abarquh, where he left a garrison, and moved on to Darab. A pursuing
Qajar army wasted time besieging Abarquh, and then marched via Sarvistan,
towards Niriz, where Lutf All Khan was known to be. For some eleven days,
the two forces skirmished inconclusively, but eventally Lutf All Khan's men,
wearying of the struggle, began to desert. Lutf All Khan returned to Tabas and
then set out for Qandahar, presumably to seek assistance from the Durrani ruler,
Timur Shah; atQa°in, however, he learnt that the latter had recently died. He
then went south toNarmashir and Bam, where two local khans offered to co
operate with him. With this additional support, he captured Kirman in Shacban
1208/March 1794, was proclaimed Padishahand struck coins.
Agha Muhammad Khan now mobilized all his available forces for a cam
paign against Kirman. He left Tehran on 3 Shawwal 1208/4 May 1794 for Fars,
and was joined north of Qum by Hajjl Ibrahim and the notables of the province.
From there, he advanced to Kirman, where Lutf cAli Khan conducted a skilful
defence, defeating the Qajar advance guard. About this time, itseems that Agha
Muhammad Khan's frustration over the Zands began to give way toactsof
irrational violence. It was said that on one occasion, catching sight ofa coin
struck in Lutf cAli Khan's name, he immediately ordered that Lutf CA1T Khan's
captive son, Fath-Allah, be castrated. Lutf CA1T Khan held out inKirman for
four months, but the morale of his troops steadily deteriorated. Finally, on 29
RablT 1209/24 October 1794, a traitor opened the gates of the citadel,the
besiegers overran the city, and Lutf cAli Khan fled to Bam. Agha Muhammad
Khan, enraged at his escape, ordered that all male prisoners be killed or blinded,
and the women and children handed over to his troops as slaves. Kirman,
systematically plundered anddevastated, didnot recover before the 20th
century. InBam, Lutf cAli Khan was betrayed by his host and handed overto
Agha Muhammad Khan, who ordered him tobe raped by his slaves, blinded
and taken to Tehran, where he was tortured to death.
While Agha Muhammad Khan was besieging Kirman, Fath All Khan had

been asserting Qajar authority throughout the sparsely populated Kirman
province by means ofa circuitous march through Bam, Narmashir, Jlruft, the
country north ofBandar cAbbas and Laristan. Atthe beginning ofJumada I
1209/November 1794, both uncle and nephew were back in Shlraz, and in
Jumada II 1209/December-January 1794-5, Fath CA1I Khan was appointed
beglerbegi of Fars, Kirman and Yazd, with the title of Jahanbanl, formerly held
by Lutf CA1I Khan. The loyal notables of Fars were rewarded for their support
and the members ofthe new beglerbegi's household and administration were
named. Hajji Ibrahim was appointed grand vizier with the title oilctimad al
Daula.
EXPANSION INTO GEORGIA AND KHURASAN
Agha Muhammad Khan could now turn to therestoration of the outlying
provinces of the Safavid kingdom. Returning toTehran inthe spring of1209/
1795, he assembled aforce of some 60,000 cavalry and infantry and in Shawwal
DhuDl-Qacda/May, setoff for Azarbaijan, intending to conquer thecountry
between the rivers Aras and Kura, formerly under Safavid control. This region
comprised anumber of independent khanates of which the most important was
Qarabagh, with its capital at Shusha; Ganja, with its capital of the same name;
Shirvan across the Kura, with its capital at Shamakhi; and to the north-west, on
both banks of the Kura, Christian Georgia (Gurjistan), with its capital atTiflis.
As he approached the Aras, Agha Muhammad divided his force into three. The
left wing was sent in the direction ofErivan, the right advanced parallel tothe
Caspian shore into the Mughan steppe and across the lower Aras into Shirvan
and Daghistan. The centre, under Agha Muhammad Khan himself, advanced
towards the fortress of Shusha. Ibrahim Khan, ruler of Qarabagh, had long
anticipated such an attack. He hadnot only strengthened his capital but
assembled a strong force to halt the Qajar. He endeavoured to block Agha
Muhammad Khan's advance with this army, but was defeated and forced to
withdraw behind the walls of Shusha, pursued bythe Qajar vanguard. Agha
Muhammad Khan then moved forward with the main part of the army, and the
siege ofShusha began. It lasted from 20 Dhu3l-Hijja 1209/8 July 1795 until23
Muharram 1210/9 August 1795, and although Ibrahim Khan's allies from Baku
and elsewhere defected and made peace with Agha Muhammad Khan, his own
troops resisted vigorously. Both sides desired a settlement, and Ibrahim Khan
eventually decided to submit to Agha Muhammad Khan, to pay regular tribute
and to surrender hostages, although the Qajars were still denied entry into

EXPANSION INTO GEORGIA AND KHURASAN
Shusha. Ibrahim Khan retained his enmity towards the Qajars, assubsequent
events would prove, but since the main objective of the campaign wasthe
conquest ofGeorgia, Agha Muhammad Khan was prepared to negotiate, to
open the road to Tin1is.
Much had happened in Georgia since the fall of the Safavids. Recently, on 23
Shacban 1197/24 July 1783, Erekle (Heraclius), the ruler of Kartli and Kakheti
(the central core of the Georgian kingdom) and Catherine II of Russia had
signed the Treaty of Georgievsk which made Georgia a Russian protectorate. In
it, Erekle specifically renounced Georgia's former dependence upon Iran, while
another article of the Treaty allowed the stationing of Russian troops in Georgia
for mutual defence against Georgia's Ottoman and Iranian neighbours. Follow
ing the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War of 1787, however, the Russian
garrisons had been withdrawn. Now, nearly a decade later, Erekle, having
renounced his allegiance to Iran, found himself unprotected in the face of a
resurgence of Iranian military power. Agha Muhammad Khan cannot have been
ignorant of events in Georgia, or unaware of Russia's threatening presence
beyond theCaucasus. His suspicions had been aroused by recent Russian
activity inboth Gilan and Astarabad. This may explain part of the hostility he
felt towards the ValT of Georgia, although while the Zands were still undefeated
he had remained ostensibly amicable. In 1200—1/1786, soon after the death of
All Murad Khan Zand, he received an envoy from Erekle, and offered the latter
sovereignty over Azarbaijan, not then in his possession, ifErekle could obtain
Russian backing forhim in his conflict with the Zands. Five years later, his
conquest of Azarbaijan in 1206/1791 raised apprehensions in Tiflis, and Erekle
had applied to Saint Petersburg for assistance, in accordance with the terms of
the Treaty ofGeorgievsk, although without result, since the Russian govern
ment was preoccupied elsewhere. As soon as Erekle heard of Agha Muhammad
Khan's plans for a summer campaign across the Aras in 1210/1795, he sent an
urgent request to Saint Petersburg for Russian aid. None was given, however,
largely on theadvice of General Ivan Gudovich, thecommander of the
Caucasian line, who did not take the threat seriously.
Meanwhile, Agha Muhammad Khan had left Shusha and advanced on Ganja,
where the ruler, Javad Khan, submitted. From there, he sent a threatening letter
to Erekle. He reminded him that, under the Safavids, Georgia had been a part of
Iran and demanded Erekle's immediate submission, assuring him that if he came
to pay homage, he would be confirmed as Vail. According to the author of the
Farsnama-ji Nasirl, Agha Muhammad Khan declared, "Shah Esmacil Safavi
ruled over the province of Georgia. When in the days of the deceased king we

were engaged inconquering the provinces ofPersia, we did not proceed to this
region. As most ofthe provinces ofPersia have come into our possession now,
you must, according to ancient law, consider Georgia part of the empire and
appear before our majesty. You have toconfirm your obedience; then you may
remain in the possession ofyour governorship. Ifyou do not do this, you will be
treated as the others."8
Erekle reacted by reaffirming his allegiance toRussia and summoning all the
troops hecould muster to Tiflis. Agha Muhammad Khan now left Ganja with
40,000 cavalry, having been joined byhis original left and right wings. On 25
Safar 1210/10 September 1795, the Qajar vanguard joined battle with the
Georgians, commanded by Erekle's grandson, but was forced back. Then Agha
Muhammad Khan and the main body of the army came up on the next day, anda
decisive engagement took place outside Tiflis. The battle lasted a whole day.
The Iranians were three times repulsed and Agha Muhammad Khan is said to
have recited verses from the Shahnama ofFirdausi toencourage his troops, who
greatly outnumbered the enemy.9 By nightfall, however, the Georgians had
suffered heavy casualties and had retreated into the citadel ofTiflis. Later, what
remained of the Vali's army, and those inhabitants of Tiflis who could, aban
doned the city.
Tiflis wassystematically sacked, and after the devastation and massacre,
15,000 Georgian slaves, mostly women and children, were deported toIran. An
eye-witness, who entered the city shortly after the Iranian troops had with
drawn, described the pitiful sights hesaw: "I therefore pursued my way, paved
as it were, with carcases, and entered Tiflis by the gate ofTapitag: but what was
my consternation on finding here the bodies of women and children slaughtered
by the sword of the enemy; tosay nothing of the men, of whom I saw more thana
thousand, as I should suppose, lying dead in one little tower! TheShahhad
arrived at Handshu, onhis way back to Tiflis, and was consequently but three
versts off. In traversing thecity to thegate of Handshu, I found nota living
creature but two infirm old men, whom the enemy had treated with great
cruelty, to make them confess where they had concealed their money and
treasures. The city was almost entirely consumed, and still continued to smoke
in different places; and the stench from the putrefying bodies, together with the
heat which prevailed, was intolerable, andcertainly infectious."10
Agha Muhammad Khan remained nine days in the vicinity of Tiflis. His
victory proclaimed therestoration of Iranian military power in a region for

EXPANSION INTO GEORGIA AND KHURASAN
merly under Safavid domination. Russia's client, Georgia, had been punished
and Russia's prestige damaged. Across the Ottoman frontier, the Pashas of Kars
and Erzerum sensed danger. But Agha Muhammad Khan did not stay to
consolidate hisvictory. Heturned back and marched down thevalley of the
Kura and, having ravaged the Khanate of Shirvan, established his winter
quarters in the Mughan steppe. It washere at Javad, to the west of the
confluence of the Kura and the Aras, that Nadir Shah had held his coronation in
1148—9/1736, sixty years earlier.
Agha Muhammad Khan had hitherto refused the title of Shah, on the
grounds that Iran was notentirely subject to hisauthority. Now, the Qajar
chieftains and officers of state, headed by Hajjl Ibrahim, came and pressed himto
take thetitle of Shah before marching on Mashhad and bringing the former
Safavid province of Khurasan, as far as the Amu-Darya river, under his
protection. In agreeing to their petition, Agha Muhammad Khan is supposed to
have said, "If, according to your desire, I put the crown onmy head, this will
cause you, in the beginning, toil and hardship, as I take no pleasure in bearing the
title ofking as long as I am not one of the greatest kings ofPersia. This petition
will not be granted but by toil and fatigue."11 Agha Muhammad Khan intended
to make his coronation ceremony an act oflegitimation. Following the Safavid
custom, the sword of Shah Ismacll Safavi was suspended from the roof of the
tomb-chamber of Shaikh Safi at the shrine of Ardabil on the eve of the
coronation, while prayers were offered for the new Shah's welfare. The next day,
the sword was brought from Ardabil and girded onthe new ruler. The crown
was placed on his head and on each arm he wore an arm-band inwhich were set
the famous gems, the Darya-yi Nur and Taj-i Mah. Surviving portraits ofAgha
Muhammad show him wearing a high, ovoid crown, the lower part encrusted
with pearls and precious stones. The ceremony was followed by a feastand
distribution of alms. Shortly afterwards, the Shah andhis army set off for
Tehran, buthisultimate destination was Mashhad.
Hajjl Ibrahim stayed inTehran tosupervise the administration, and therehe
received the envoys ofthe French Republic, J-G. Brugieres and G-A. Olivier,
who urged him topersuade the Shah toconsolidate his hold over Georgia and
establish an outlet toEurope by way ofMingrelia, before the Russians annexed
the southern Caucasus region. Meanwhile, the confusion prevailing in
Khurasan made its conquest comparatively easy. This region, untouched by the
earlier struggles among theZand, Bakhtiyari and Qajar rivals, had formerly

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
been protected bythe Durrani ruler, Ahmad Shah, but after his death in 1187/
1773, hissuccessors preferred to concentrate their attention upon their Indian
borderlands. Inthe late decades ofthe 18th century, Khurasan was ina stateof
near anarchy. In Mashhad, the authority of Shahrukh, Nadir Shah's grandson,
was hardly more than nominal. Outside Mashhad, the surrounding countryside
was held by various independent chieftains, of whom themost powerful was
probably Ishaq Khan, with his headquarters atTurbat-i Haidari.12 Inthe eastern
foothills of the Alburz, Kurdish chieftains controlled the higher land from such
strongholds as Bujnurd, Khabushan (Quchan), Darra Gaz andKalat. To the
north, in the direction of the Qara-Qum, the barrier between Iran and the
Khanates of Khiva and Bukhara, dwelt theTiirkmens: from west to east,the
Goklen, the Tekke, the Yamut, the Sariq, the Salor and Ersari. Across this vast
expanse, tribal warfare, the plundering of caravans, and cattle- and slave-raiding
were endemic.
The newly-crowned Agha Muhammad Shah advanced into Khurasan by
way ofGurgan, halting inAstarabad topunish the Goklen Tiirkmens who had
been raiding in that province.13 Hethen left for Mashhad, while local khans,
recognizing the impossibility of resistance, hastened to submit. All these
chieftains were forced to hand over hostages, who were sent to Tehran. As Agha
Muhammad Shah approached Mashhad, Shahrukh came to the Qajar camp,
accompanied by a leading mujtahid^Mirza Mahdi, andone of his sons. Agha
Muhammad Shah sent his nephew, Husain Quli Khan (the younger brother of
Fath CA1IKhan), towelcome the party, and the visitors, especially the mujtahid,
were treated with respect. He then sent Sulaiman Khan Qajar, accompanied by
Mirza Mahdi and 8,000 troops, to occupy the city and assure itsinhabitants of
the Shah's benevolence. The next day, Agha Muhammad Shah entered Mashhad
on foot (as Shah cAbbas I had been accustomed to do) as apilgrim to the shrine of
Imam Riza, weeping and kissing the earth. For the next twenty-three days,he
continued his pilgrimage, seemingly oblivious ofaffairs ofstate. Then a change
came over him. Orders were given for the exhumation ofNadir Shah's remains,
which were reburied with those ofKarlm Khan Zand inTehran; Shahrukh was
compelled tosurrender any jewels formerly belonging toNadir Shah. Shahrukh
denied on oath that he had any left. Under torture, he revealed the whereabouts
of some of the gems. He was tortured again, and handed over agreat ruby which
12 According to Morier, Ishaq Khan possessed 160,000 sheep, 20,000 camels and 6,000 broodmares. Op. cit., p. 239. 13 It was perhaps inregard tothis punitive expedition that Fraser heard the rumour that the Shah had "ordered that allthe male captives should have thethumb of their right hand cutoutby the socket, thus disabling them from using either the bow or the spear". Fraser, op. cit., p. 260.

THE LAST MONTHS
Agha Muhammad Shah had long coveted.14 Shahrukh and his family were then
sent to Mazandaran. Shahrukh himself died onthe way, atDamghan, wherehis
tomb still stands. He was sixty-three, and had ruled Khurasan, in name atleast,
for forty-six years.
THE LAST MONTHS
The Shah had arrived inMashhad inMay 1796. Heseems tohave spent some
time there, settling theaffairs ofKhurasan. It ispossible that he contemplated
advancing against Herat, then an appendage of the Durrani kingdom, but
formerly aSafavid province and traditional residence ofthe Safavid vallQahd. He
may also have contemplated, as Malcolm was told, an expedition against
Bukhara, toavenge the Mangit usurper Shah Murad's treatment ofthe Qajarsof
Marv. He sent an emissary toBukhara, addressed notto Shah Murad, but to
AbuDl-Ghazi Khan, last ruler ofthe dispossessed Janid dynasty, demandingthe
return ofIranian slaves held in Bukhara. Shah Murad is said to have replied
insultingly, buttohave assembled the Iranian captives inBukhara sothat they
should beready, ifnecessary, to bereturned to Iran. Agha Muhammad Shahis
also supposed tohave proposed atthis time a combined attack on Bukhara to
TImur Shah Durrani.
In theevent, news ofdevelopments inthenorth-west called for immediate
action. Catherine II,eager toextend Russia's hegemony beyond theCaucasus,
and having a pretext intheShah's treatment ofher client, Erekle, hadsent an
expedition into thesouth-eastern Caucasus, under thecommand of Count
Valerian Zubov. Its goal was toannex theKura—Aras region and chastise the
Shah. Zubov first occupied Darband and Baku, the districts of Salyan and
Talish, andthen Shamakhi andGanja; it seemed that hisfinal destinationwas
Tabriz. However, the death of Catherine in November 1796, and the accession
of Paul I, opposed to hismother's Caucasian policies, ledto the expedition's
immediate recall. Meanwhile, the Shah hadreturned to Tehran, ordering the
military commanders in the provinces to assemble there with their contingents
the following spring. Agha Muhammad Shah apparently contemplated an
extended campaign, forhesummoned Fath CA1IKhan to Tehran and appointed
him deputy {Na'ib al-Saltand) during his absence. In DhuDl-Hijja 1211/June
1797, the Shah left Tehran, intending to march through Azerbaijan to
Qarabagh, Shirvan and Georgia, but incamp at Sultaniya, the news of Zubov's

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
recall arrived. This led to achange of plan. Itwas less urgent to punish Georgia,
and the Shah decided to deal first with the recalcitrant Ibrahim Khan of
Qarabagh, who had recently become a Russian protege. Theroyal army
therefore advanced from Miyana toArdabll, and then moved towards Shusha.
At Adlnabazar, there appeared adelegation of notables from Shusha, announc
ing that Ibrahim Khan and his family had fled into Daghistan, and inviting the
Shah to take possession oftheir city. In response to this unanticipated good
fortune, the Shah left the army at Adlnabazar in the charge of Hajjl Ibrahim and
Sulaiman Khan Quyunlu. The Shah's nephew, Husain Quli Khan, and Fath All
Khan's sons, Husain AIT Mirza and Muhammad Quli Mirza, were with them.
The Shah set off with 5,000 horsemen and 3,000 infantry and, rapidly fording the
Aras, entered Shusha. He remained there three days until, disturbed one evening
by a quarrel between two servants in hisprivate quarters, he ordered their
immediate execution. Sadiq Khan, leader of the Shaqaqi Kurds, was present. He
tried to intercede for the servants, but the Shah was implacable, agreeing only to
postpone their execution until the following morning, to avoid shedding blood
on a Friday. He foolishly allowed the condemned men to continue attending him
until he fell asleep, when they, joined by a third servant, stabbed him to death, on
21 Dhui-Hijja 1211/16 June 1797. They then fled to Sadiq Khan, bearing the
treasure that the Shah had with him, including the Darya-ji Nur and the Taj-i
Mah. Sadiq Khan took the assassins under his protection, assumed charge of the
regalia, and set out with his troops for Tabriz. The Qajar ascendancy, towhich
the late Shah had devoted himself with such single-mindedness, was now tobe
put to the test.
Utter confusion followed the news of Agha Muhammad Shah's death. In
Shusha, the royal troops dispersed, returning tothe main camp, while the two
officials who always accompanied the late Shah, the Munshl al-Mamalik and the
Ishik Aqasi BashI, fled to Tehran byway of Nakhchivan and Maragha. The
inhabitants ofShusha plundered the Shah's camp, while the local culama buried
his remains. Confusion also reigned in the main camp at Adlnabazar. Husain
Quli Khan and Sulaiman Khan Quyunlu set ofT with the sons of Fath All Khan
for Tehran by way of Talish, Shaft and Rasht. Hajjl Ibrahim took the main part
of the army, including the Mazandarani musketeers and the contingent from
Fars, andtravelled via Ardabll and Zanjan to Tehran. Meanwhile, Mirza
Muhammad Khan Develu, the governor ofTehran, closed the gates of the city
and put the citadel ina state ofdefence until Fath All Khan could arrive from
Shiraz. The princes and nobles arriving from Shusha encamped outside the walls
but were denied entry.

THE LAST MONTHS
Agha Muhammad Shah's brother, All Quli Khan, had been in Erivan atthe
time ofthe Shah's assassination. Marching via Khuy, Tabriz and Maragha,he
approached Tehran from thewest, buton being denied entry to thecity,
withdrew tothe fortress of All Shah on the river Karaj, where he proclaimed
himself Shah. At the same time, Sadiq Khan and his ShaqaqI Kurds, who had left
Shusha for Tabriz on the night ofthe Shah's assassination, marched onSarab
and Qazvin, in order to free the Khan's wife and son held captive there, while at
the same time summoning followers from Sulduz, Maragha, Tabriz, Ardabil
and Mughan. Having appointed his brother, Muhammad CA1I Sultan, governor
of Tabriz, andanother brother, Jacfar Khan, governor of Qarajadagh, he
himself settled down to besiege Qazvin. In Qazvin, the garrison played for time,
holding out until the arrival ofa relief force from Tehran. Meanwhile, Sadiq
Khan ordered his brothers to take Khuy and, in aneffort to raise anarmy to
achieve this, the two chieftains assembled amixed force including artisans and
craftsmen pressed from the bazaars of Tabriz, as well as recruits from
Qarajadagh.
News of the Shah's murder did not reach Fath All Khan inShiraz until ten
days after ithad happened. He made the necessary arrangements, appointing his
eldest son, the nine-year-old Muhammad CA1I Mirza, nominal beglerbegi of
Fars, observed three days of mourning, and then left for Tehran. Some distance
short of Ray, he was joined by Hajji Ibrahim, Husain Quli Khan, and the loyal
princes and he was informed of the rebellion of his uncle, CA1I Quli Khan. The
latter fell into his nephew's hands, was blinded, and then allowed to live in
retirement at Barfarush, where he died in 1240/18 24- 5. Fath CA1T Khan made his
formal entry into Tehran on 20Safar 1212/15 August 1797.
Sadiq Khan ShaqaqI was still besieging Qazvin, so Fath All Khan marched
on the city with as large a force as he could muster. Sadiq Khan advanced to meet
him at Khak-i All, about thirty miles east ofQazvin, and after a hard-fought
engagement, the Kurd's forces were dispersed with heavy losses, and the royal
army entered Qazvin. Sadiq Khan andhis remaining men fled to Sarab,
intending to go to Azerbaijan, where he believed that his brothers had strength
ened thefortifications of Tabriz and gained possession of Khuy. In Sarab,
however, hemet them both, fugitives like himself. The governor of Khuy,
Jacfar Khan Dunbull, and his brother, the former governor ofTabriz, Husain
Khan Dunbuli, had united their Kurdish followers, scattered inthe confusion
following Agha Muhammad Shah's death, and defeated Sadiq Khan's brothers.
Sadiq Khan had tosubmit, although he was in astrong position, in that he still
had Agha Muhammad Shah's crown-jewels. Fath All Khan, who had cometo

AGHA MUHAMMAD KHAN AND THE QAJARS
Zanjan intending to restore order in Azarbaljan, agreed that, in return for the
jewels, Sadiq Khan bepardoned. With his supporters killed or dispersed, the
jewels in themselves were of little use to Sadiq Khan and, inhis own districts, the
Shaqaqi Kurds were held in check bytheir DunbulT rivals. Sadiq Khan made a
good bargain, gaining the districts ofSarab and Garmrud. Meanwhile, Fath All
Khan, learning that plague wasravaging Azarbaljan, preferred to settle its
affairs from a distance. The recalcitrant chieftains submitted, and received
honours and offices. Muhammad Husain Khan Quyunlu, Agha Muhammad's
maternal cousin, was re-appointed governor of Erivan, which hewas to hold
against the Russians in 1804, and Jacfar Khan Dunbuli was rewarded withthe
governorships of Tabriz and Khuy. Fath All Khan then returned to Tehran,
which he reached in Jumada II 1212/November—December 1797.
His obligations to his dead uncle were now fulfilled. Two ofthe late Shah's
assassins had been seized when the Qajar troops entered Qazvin. One was cutto
pieces byFath CA1I Khan's brother; the other was dismembered bythe Shah's
executioner. The third, captured later near Kirmanshah, was burnt to death in
Tehran. Orders were sent toIbrahim Khan, now back inShusha, toexhume the
body of Agha Muhammad Shah and send it with suitable honours to Tehran,
where it rested for three days in the shrine ofShah Abd al- Azim, to the south of
the city. A great procession, ledby Muhammad cAli Khan Quyunlu, a close
kinsman ofthe late Shah, with anescort of 2,000 horsemen, then accompanied
the corpse to Najaf, where the cortege was received bythe Pasha of Baghdad.
Like Shah Abbas I,Agha Muhammad Shah was buried in the haram of the Imam
All, where his tomb came to bevenerated asthat ofa shahld (martyr) who had
died yv&gmgjihadagainst the unbelievers. However, one pilgrim who visited the
tomb shortly afterwards was not impressed: "On the outside of the mausoleum,

THE LAST MONTHS
On 3 Shawal mil 21March 1798, which was both Nauruz and the cId al-Fitr,
Fath CA1I Khan crowned himself Shah in the Gulistan Palace in Tehran.
Opposition to his succession wasnot yet over. That summer, Sadiq Khan
Shaqaqi and Jacfar Khan Dunbuli rebelled, and hardly had the one submitted
and theother fled into Ottoman territory, before theShah's brother, Husain
Quli Khan, now beglerbegi ofFars, revolted. Nevertheless, Fath cAli Shah was
now firmly seated upon his throne, and his brother's rebellion came to
nothing. He had little statesmanship orcharisma, but his rule was secure. Agha
Muhammad Shah's ambitions had been fulfilled: the Qajars, inthe person ofhis
favourite nephew, were finally established on thethrone of the Safavids.
It is difficult toview the reign of Agha Muhammad Khan in perspective. The
entire plateau was rife with warfare. The Shah himself was constantly on the
move. The sources seem little more than accounts ofa string of engagements.
Scarcely any European travellers visited Qajar Iran before the reign ofFath CA1I
Shah or left descriptions of what they saw, while the grotesque anedotes ofAgha
Muhammad Shah's cruelty do little to give a balanced view of events of the
period.
Agha Muhammad Khan was a man who governed from the saddle, and his
leadership was tenacious rather than charismatic. As a military commander he
was undoubtedly able; it isworth recalling Malcolm's assessment ofhis troops,
written not long after his death: "His army was inured tofatigue, and regularly
paid; he had introduced excellent arrangement into all its Departments, and his
known severity occasioned the utmost alacrity and promptness inthe execution
of orders, andhad he lived a fewmore years, it is difficult to conjecture the
progress of his arms."16 Beside this opinion may beplaced a second, also by a
Briton, James Baillie Fraser: "Aga Mahomed had likewise the talent of forming
good andbrave troops. Hisactive andambitious disposition kept his army
constantly engaged; and they acquired aveteran hardihood and expertness, that
rendered them superior to any other Asiatic troops."17
Thus, Agha Muhammad Shah's success was evidently due toa combination
of skilful military organization, theability to manipulate and control shifting
rivalries and alliances among the tribes, and the qualities of a tireless, far-sighted
and prudent commander in the field. While no precise figures for the Qajar army
of the late 18th century exist, those obtained by Malcolm in 1801 reflect the scale
of the military establishment inthe preceding reign. Malcolm mentions 3 5,000
regular cavalry and 15,000 infantry, a standing army paid from the central

treasury.18 In addition, levies of both cavalry and infantry could be summoned
from the provinces and tribes when needed. There was anineffective artillery
arm, manned mainly by Georgian and Armenian gunners, which Malcolm
thought capable of improvement. There were also 200 ^amburaks (swivel-guns
mounted oncamels), which were judged to bepurely ceremonial.19
The regular cavalry included the royal ghulams (household cavalry), mainly
recruited from the Astarabad region, while the most valuable infantry were the
Mazandarani tufangchh (musketeers). Agha Muhammad Shah was said tohave
called them "the Shah's bodyshirt" (plrahan-i tan-i shah),and in times of danger,
he slept in their midst.20 Writing during the middle years of the next reign,
Fraser states that theprovinces of Mazandaran and Astarabad had their revenues
commuted to the provision of 12,000 tufangchls and 4,000 cavalry.21
Agha Muhammad Shah employed the tactics of his own Qajar tribe and their
Turkmen neighbours, inwhich the surprise attack, encirclement from the rear,
and maximum mobility all featured. He rarely lost an engagement, but had the
reputation ofonly giving battle when reasonably sure of victory. His troops
lived offthe country when in enemy territory and, wherever appropriate, he
employed a"scorched earth" policy to deny the enemy supplies.22 He knew that
his soldiers were capable of spontaneous feats ofcourage and daring, but, if
confronted by resolute opponents, tended to lack tenacity.23 During Count
Zubov's invasion in 1211—12/1797, he told Haj ji Ibrahim that while he intended
to harry the Russians mercilessly, hewould never send his troops into close
combat with the Russian infantry, because oftheir formidable fire-power and
unyielding ranks; he took this decision long before he entered the field. When
caution orretreat were needed, ora strategy required modification, he would
quickly appreciate the situation: as Hajji Ibrahim told the British, Agha
Muhammad Shah was a brave enough leader in battle, but his "head . . . never
left work for his hand!"24 His re-uniting of the Iranian plateau under a single rule
owed asmuch to his astuteness asto his military skill.
A central issue for Agha Muhammad Shah was thetribal arithmetic of
eighteenth-century Iran. Since the overthrow ofthe Safavids, every contender
18 Morier heard that, in order to prevent peculation of his soldiers' wages, the Shah paid his troops with his ownhand. Second journey\ p. 238. 19 Malcolm, "Memorandum", pp. 20—1.

22 Thus, when the Shah's troops were advancing against Erivan in 1209-10/179 5, it was said that Iranian Muslims from Qarabagh, Nakhchivan and Erivan fled into Gurjistan along with Armenians, fearing the depredations of his troops. Artemi, op. cit., p. 197. 23 Artemi declared: "The Persians indeed attack like lions but they exert their strength inthe first blow, and if this fails, they return home."

for power had needed an adequate base among these groups. They had consti
tuted thebasis of Nadir Shah's regime, and had also been thecause of its
disintegration. In order to succeed, Agha Muhammad Shah had to create a
network oftribal alliances and allegiances. His own Qajar tribe, although not
numerous, were wardens of the north-eastern marches and enjoyed a reputation
for their fighting skill. With Gurgan cut off from the rest of Iran, and difficult to
attack from the south, his original home-base was relatively secure, especially as
the Qajars of Astarabad generally enjoyed good relations with the Turkmen
tribes of the south-western Qara-Qum. Unpredictable as the Tiirkmens might
be, the Yamut had, on more than one occasion, provided sanctuary and support
to Muhammad Hasan Khan and his son, and been rewarded accordingly with
opportunities for raiding with the Qajars, with access tosuperior pastures and
with marriage alliances with the Qajars. Thus, the Yamut were permitted to
move from the arid banks ofthe Atrak tothe fertile Gurgan plain, where the
villages along the Qara Su were allotted to them as tuyul, thus provoking strife
between the newcomers and the settled cultivators of the Atak.25 However, the
Tiirkmens were always uncertain neighbours and, on at least one occasion
towards theend of the reign, Agha Muhammad Shah, exasperated by the
depredations of the Goklen in northern Khurasan, severely punished them
during his 1210—11/1796 campaign in that province.
From Gurgan, hefirst turned his attention to Mazandaran, and recruited
there those Mazandarani tufangchis whom he so highly prized. Yet even with
them and his Turkmen allies, he still lacked the tribal following that the Zands
possessed. To compensate, he methodically established anetwork of clients and
allies among the tribal leaders ofthe north and west, especially inthe Khamsa
region ofcIraq-i Ajam and inAzarbaijan. This frequently involved choosing
between two rival groups. His support of the Dunbull Kurds rather than their
Shaqaqi Kurdish rivals in Azarbaijan exemplifies this. It also involved skilful use
of threats and rewards: on the one hand, the practice of taking hostages from the
families of tribal leaders and, onthe other, offering them marriages into the
ruling house. Tribes could bewon over bypartnership with the victorious
Qajars, with opportunities for plunder, for settling old scores with rivals, and
for better grazing grounds. They could likewise becoerced by threatening
withdrawal of such prospects, the promotion of a rival tribe or faction, and
ultimately, punitive measures such as the confiscation oflivestock or forcible
eviction. In Mazandaran, for example, three distinct tribal groups were settled in

the province by Agha Muhammad Shah, either by persuasion orforce: the cAbd
al-Maliki, the Kurd-u-Turk, and the Khwajavand. The cAbd al-Maliki, said to
have been 4,000 Qashqa°I families which had originally opposed the Qajar
advance into the south, were moved to Nur and Kujur around 1205 —6/1791, and
later transferred to the area between Ashraf and Farahabad. The Kurd-u-Turk, a
composite group dominated byMukri Kurds from Sauj Bulagh in Azarbaljan,
and various Turkish tribes from Khurasan, were settled around Sari. The
Khwajavand, originally from the Khurramabad region, were first located north
of Tehran, but were later transferred to theTunakabun district.
To the west, in the Khamsa region ofcIraq-i A.jam, which was amongthe
earliest conquests of the Qajars south of the Alburz, the Turkish Inallu
Shahsevan and the Baghdad! Shahsevan were both apparently relocated in the
Sava and Kharaqan districts.26 Further west still, heformed alliances withthe
Mukri Kurds of Sauj Bulagh, the Dunbuli Kurds of Khuy, and the Qaraguzlu
Turks of Hamadan, to name only three. Even more important was theclose
collaboration between the Qajars andthe ValTs of Ardalan, an alliance first
formulated during the lifetime of Muhammad Hasan Khan Qajar, and thereafter
sedulously pursued by Agha Muhammad Shah andFath All Shah.
In the middle decade ofthe 18th century, the ruling Vali, Hasan All Khan,
had found himself embroiled in two feuds: with theBaban Kurdish chieftain,
Selim Pasha, and inthe rivalries ofAzad Khan the Afghan, Karim Khan Zand
and cAli Mardan Khan Bakhtiyari. He was eventually killed by Selim Pasha, but
his son, Khusrau Khan, aconfidant and companion of Muhammad Hasan Khan
Qajar, fought his way into the Vali's capital of Senna, now Sanandaj, and was
acclaimed Vali in Muharram 1168/October-November 1754. Shortly thereafter,
he sustained abrief siege by the forces of Azad Khan, which were driven off bya
Qajar relief-column. Azad Khan withdrew northwards, andKhusrau Khan,
coming out of Sanandaj, pursued him vigorously asfarasGarrus and defeated
him, winning great booty, as well as the respect ofhis Qajar ally. Thereafter, for
more than thirty years (1168-76/174-62 and 1179-1204/1765-89), Khusrau
Khan remained one of the most prominent figures in western Iran, and a staunch
ally of Muhammad Hasan Khan until the latter's death in 1172/17 5 9. Thereafter,
he was compelled tosubmit toKarim Khan Zand, who confirmed him as Vali,
enabling him to consolidate his position inArdalan until Karim Khan's deathin
1193/1779. Under Karim Khan's successors, however, he became restless.

Khan, and the events leading up to it (see p. 119 supra). Khusrau Khan died in
1204/1789. Following the brief rule of two successors, the vilayat passed to his
younger son, Aman-Allah (1214/1799), whose long tenure of office, partly
coinciding with the governorship of Kirmanshah province by Fath CA1I Shah's
eldest son, Muhammad Ali Mirza, confirmed in the third generation the mutual
advantages enjoyed byboth parties to the Qajar-Ardalan alliance.
The civil administration of Iran during the reign of Agha Muhammad Shah
appears rudimentary. The Shah was mainly preoccupied with military matters.27
His court was almost invariably his tent, and it has been seen that his chief
minister, Hajji Ibrahim, was also often inthe field, as were the secretaries and
those answerable to the Shah forthe fisc. For years, Agha Muhammad Shah
relied upon only two senior officials to handle affairs of state. These were Mirza
Ismacil, aformer household servant of the Qajars, who acted as mustaufi (chief
revenue officer), andMirza Asad-Allah Nuri, from thedistrict of Nur in
Mazandaran, who served as lashkar-navls(military paymaster). Mirza Ismacll
endeavoured toestablish a secure revenue after decades offiscal mismanage
ment but, as Abd-Allah Mustaufi says, in describing his ancestor Mirza Ismacll's
experiences in Agha Muhammad Khan's service, "Agha Muhammad was
himself the treasurer, minister offinance and sahib-idivan ofhis own govern
ment. "28 Not until 1209/1794—5 did he acquire a principal vazir in the traditional
sense, when Hajji Ibrahim became the Vtimad al-Daula.
Agha Muhammad Shah recruited officials such as he needed from any
available source. The former Zand administration was not excluded and pro
vided, among others, Hajji Ibrahim and Mirza Buzurg, the Qa"im-Maqam of the
next reign. What he required in his agents was effectiveness and loyalty. A
typical example was Hajji Muhammad Husain Khan, anilliterate tradesman
whom heappointed beglerbegl of Isfahan, and who subsequently rose even
higher. As Morier relates: "He was originally a green-grocer of Ispahan, of
which city he and his family are natives. His first rise from this humble station
was to become Kat Khoda (or deputy) ofhis mahal^ or division; his next, to
become that of a larger mahal\ he was then promoted to be the Kelanter, or mayor,
of the city; and thence he became the Thaubit, orChief, of a rich and extensive
district near Ispahan, where he acquired great reputation for his good govern
ment. He afterwards made himself acceptable in the eyes of the late King [Agha
Muhammad Shah], by a l&tgzpeesh-kesh, or present; and as the then Governor of
Ispahan was a man of dissolute life, oppressive and unjust, hesucceeded in

government within living memory had soeffectively enforced itswill. Agha
Muhammad Shah seems to have cherished a belief in his role asa traditional
Shahanshah, the fount of justice and protector of the poor. Wide stretches of the
country were forcibly pacified, the servants of the government were compelled
to exercise moderation in their demands, the roads were made safe for mer
chants, and justice was meted out from the throne, albeit with a heavy hand.
Malcolm, reporting opinion in Iran shortly after Agha Muhammad Shah's
death, states that, "Aga Mahomed Khan was rigid in the administration of
justice. He punished corruption inthe magistrates, whenever it was detected.
Such as committed crimes which according tothe Koran merited death, were
seldom forgiven; and he never pardoned persons who in any shape disturbed the
tranquillity of his dominions . . . during the latter years of his reign commerce
revived in every quarter. This was not more the consequence of his justice, than
of the general security which his rule inspired; and of the extinction, through the
severity of his punishments, of those bands of robbers with which the country
had before been infested. Tothe farmers and cultivators hegave no further
protection than what they derived from the terror of his name; but that was
considerable: from the collector of a district tothe governor ofa province, all
dreaded a complaint toa monarch, by whom the slightest deviations in those
who exercised power, were often visited by the most dreadful punishments."30
It isunclear whether Agha Muhammad Shah pursued adeliberate policyin
his dealings with the ShiLi Qulama. Brought up in the house of a Sayyid and for a
time passed off as his son, he showed respect for the culama throughout his life
and supported them with grants andendowments.31 Hisostensible piety,
notwithstanding his reputation as awine-bibber, certainly won their approval.
A chronicle describes him, in 1210—11/1796, approaching theshrine of the
Eighth Imam on foot: " . . . displaying signs of weakness, poverty, humility, and
submissiveness, and shedding tears, he walked to the shrine and kissedthe
blessed soil".32 Elsewhere, the same source, commenting upon his death,
declares: "All hislife he hadhonored the Sharia. As long as he lived he
performed his prayers at the time prescribed, and each midnight, though he
passed the day in toil and exertion, herose to offer a prayer."33
Another chronicle relates how, when recovering from an illness, he dreamt
that he saw afigure dressed as amulla. He claimed that this experience fortified
the sense which he had ofhis royal mission. He may, like the late Muhammad

Riza Shah,34 have supposed his visitor to have been Hazrat CA1I, or perhaps the
Eighth or Twelfth Imam, both of whose names were inscribed on his coinage, as
they were on that of most rulers from the time ofShah Tahmasp II onwards.35
Agha Muhammad Shah's patronage of Islamic institutions indicates an
awareness of the duties of a Shici ruler. In Tehran, he ordered the construction of
the Masjid-i Shah, Shah's mosque, and in Mashhad, the renovation of the shrine.
Agha Muhammad Shah also commissioned some secular building, less for
aesthetic than for practical purposes. In Astarabad, he repaired or strengthened
the walls, cleared the ditch, erected public buildings, including apalace for the
beglerbegl, and generally improved the town's amenities.36 Similar repairs and
improvements were undertaken at Barfarush (Babul) and Ashraf, and especially
at Sari, where hebuilt himself a palace.37 In general, however, a lifetime of
campaigning, followed bya comparatively brief reign, did not permit much
patronage of architecture or the arts. Perhaps his most enduring legacy is Tehran
itself, although little remains ofthe city asit was in his lifetime.
Early inthe course ofestablishing his power, Agha Muhammad Shah was
compelled to address the question of the succession. He, of course, had no issue,
but in choosing a successor, he had to avoid further exacerbating the internecine
feuding among the Qajar clans. In addition to the rivalry between the Yukhari
bash and Ashaqa-bash Qajars, there had also been the destructive feud between
the Quyunlu and the Develu clans among the latter. These conflicts had to be
resolved for Qajar rule to survive. Among his siblings, only Husain Qull Khan
was afull-brother, and hence his obvious heir, but he predeceased the monarch.
Fortunately heleft sons, Fath CA1I Khan and Husain Qull Khan. As soon as
Agha Muhammad Khan escaped captivity in Shiraz in 1192—3/1779, he seems to
have determined that Fath All Khan should be his heir, and in 1196/1781—2, he
arranged his nephew's marriage to the daughter of Fath All Khan Develu,
thereby binding the rival families of Quyunlu and Develu in amarriage alliance.
He further promoted this alliance through the marriage ofhis grandson, Fath
All Shah's son, Abbas Mirza, to a Develu Qajar girl in 1216—17/1802, and there
is other evidence38 of Agha Muhammad Shah's foresight in respect of the
succession. All his hopes for the future of his dynasty were thus linked to the line
of Abbas Mirza and his descendants. Indeed a European traveller in Iran during
the reign of Fath All Shah heard the rumour that, had Agha Muhammad Khan

lived longer, he would have bypassed the succession of his nephew in favour of
Abbas Mirza.39 It was this preoccupation with neutralizing inter-tribal feuds
among the Qajars, as well as his dream of a Quyunlu ruling house which ledto
the exclusion from the succession ofFath All Shah's eldest son, Muhammad
All Mirza, the offspring of a Georgian concubine, who was perhaps the ablest of
Fath All Shah's sons and who, had he lived and reigned, might have injected into
the government of the kingdom some of his great-uncle's wilful energy and
prudent foresight.

CHAPTER 4
IRAN DURING THE REIGNS OF FATH CALI
SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
The kingdom which Fath All Shah inherited in 1797 resembled an estate long
neglected by successive owners. Indeed it hadbeen for thebest part of a century.
Had Fath All Shah wondered, as hepresided over thefirst NewYear festival of
a long reign of thirty-seven years, what were the resources of his inheritance in
manpower or revenues, it is doubtful whether anyone near him could have
provided the requisite information, or even delineated the frontiers of his
kingdom. The claim or aspiration was that his domain equalled that of his
Safavid predecessors in the days of their greatness; certainly it exceeded the
bounds of present-day Iran. In reality, however, the royal writ ran far from
smoothly, authority emanating from Tehran but repeatedly interrupted. In
much of Khurasan, or themore remote marches of the Lur,Turkmen or Baluch
country, the Shah was scarcely even nominal ruler. Yet in spite of the practical
constraints upon his exercise of power and the humiliation of two defeats
suffered at thehands of Russia which entailed a loss of territory, theclose of Fath
All Shah's reign did see the definitive re-establishment of a "Royaume de
Perse".
Early 19th-century European observers of Iran doubted whether the Shah's
government had the will or the means to refurbish this derelict estate; it is
unlikely that either the Shah or his kinsmen thought in terms of "improving"
the kingdom's resources as a contemporary English Whig landowner would
have done. Nevertheless, it is a fact that Fath CAH Shah's reign ultimately
afforded sufficient order and effective government to make possible some
economic recovery. Contemporary Europeans criticized the early Qajars for
corruption, brutality, and ineptitude, but notwithstanding what, measured
against contemporary European expectations of how states should be managed,
were vices in the bureaucracy, Fath All Shah's Iran was more tranquil and
prosperous than it had been at any time since Safavid rule had ceased to be
effective.
Fath All Shah seems to have aimed at ruling in accordance with those
concepts of Iranian Shahanshahl which the age of the Safavids had come to
symbolize. Hedidnot possess the sacral charisma enjoyed by thedescendants of

FATH CALI SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
Shah Ismacll I, but he stressed his family's links with the heroic past of the
Oghuz, with the migrations ofthe Turkmens inthe days ofthe Il-Khans and the
Aq Quyunlu, and with theage of Qizilbash hegemony. Court chroniclers lent
their eloquence to the historicity of this tribal heritage. Bas-reliefs of Fath cAli
Shah and his sons were carved on rock faces in the Sasanian style at Rayy and Taq-i
Bustan to proclaim the continuity ofthe monarchical tradition. Fath cAli Shah
was following in his uncle's footsteps, but outstripped his predecessor in
articulating regal splendour and pride. Court-painters celebrated their master's
greatness inthe life-size portraits, inthe miniatures of him trampling on Russian
corpses while survivors fled interror atthe mere sight ofhim, and inthe elegant
hunting-scenes on pen-cases andhuqqa-bowls (water pipe bowls).
In particular, uncertain frontiers posed problems. In the western Zagros
region, for example, the nomadic population freely moved between the territor
ies ofthe Shah and those ofthe Ottoman Sultan. As beglerbegl of Kirmanshah,
Luristan andKhuzistan, Fath CA1I Shah's eldest son, Muhammad cAli Mirza,
made sporadic raids into areas which were supposedly part of the Ottoman
vilayatof Baghdad, just ashis brother, cAbbas Mirza, beglerbegi of Azarbaijan,
did into the vilayats of Van and Erzerum. No one knew exactly where the lines of
the frontier ran. They still awaited negotiation and agreement between the two
governments.
In their raids across theOttoman frontier, both princes asserted claims to
territory which in Safavid times (ifonly for brief periods) had been Iranian. It
was the same in the east: Herat and Qandahar had been important provinces of
the Safavid kingdom. Fath AllShah assumed that both were included in his
inheritance. To Safavid precedents he could addthose of Nadir Shah'scon
quests. On one occasion, asked by the Russians tohelp topunish the Khivansfor
harassing Russian merchants, he declared that, in order to campaign against
Khiva, he must first, like Nadir Shah, control Herat, Balkh and Bukhara.1
In theeast, attempts to advance thefrontier were repelled by the Durrani
rulers ofAfghanistan; inthe west, by the Pashas ofBaghdad, Van and Erzerum.
More complicated was the situation onthe Caucasian marches beyond the river
Aras. Although, during the 1720s, Iranians, Ottomans andRussians hadcon
fronted each other in this ethnically and culturally diverse region, theShahsof
Iran had claimed suzerainty over some ofthe local rulers since the time of Shah
Ismacll I (A.D. 1501—24). These claims hadbeen reasserted by Nadir Shah, by
Karim Khan Zand and by Agha Muhammad Khan. Even when rulers on the

FATH CALI SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
plateau lacked the means to effect suzerainty beyond the Aras, the neighbouring
Khanates were still regarded asIranian dependencies. Naturally, it was those
Khanates located closest tothe province ofAzarbaTjan which most frequently
experienced attempts tore-impose Iranian suzerainty: the Khanates of Erivan,
Nakhchivan and Qarabagh across the Aras, and the cis-Aras Khanate of Talish,
with its administrative headquarters located at Lankaran and therefore very
vulnerable to pressure, either from the direction of Tabriz or Rasht. Beyond the
Khanate of Qarabagh, the Khan of Ganja and the Vail of Gurjistan (ruler of the
Kartli-Kakheti kingdom of south-east Georgia), although less accessible for
purposes of coercion, were also regarded as theShah's vassals, as werethe
Khans of Shakki and Shirvan, north ofthe Kura river. The contacts between
Iran and the Khanates ofBaku and Qubba, however, were more tenuous and
consisted mainly of maritime commercial links with Anzali and Rasht.
The effectiveness of these somewhat haphazard assertions of suzerainty
depended on theability of a particular Shah to make hiswill felt, and the
determination of the local khans to evade obligations they regarded as onerous.
This situation completely changed inthe second half of the 18th century, when
the Russians advanced into the Caucasus and Erekle, ValT ofGurjistan, volun
tarily submitted to Catherine II in 1783 in theTreaty of Georgievsk. Agha
Muhammad Khan regarded this as an act of defiance. It led tohis punitive raid
against Tiflis in1795, which provoked Russian retaliation. Hence, by the end of
the century, the Russians were seeking aclearly-defined defensive frontier with
Iran. The frontier they envisaged would have tobe the line ofeither the river
Kura orthe Aras. Inretrospect, Russian expansion into the southern Caucasus
region appears inevitable, but in Fath CA1I Shah's view of the world, the
Khanates belonged wholly to Iran. Agha Muhammad Khan, asproof of his
suzerainty over them, had minted gold and silver coins in Erivan, and silver ones
in Ganja, Nukha (the capital ofShakki) and Shamlkha (the capital ofShirvan),
just as he had done inYazd, Isfahan orTabriz. There was nothing peculiar in
this: he regarded them all, as the Safavids and Nadir Shah had done, as Iranian
cities. Fath All Shah did the same. Before the outbreak ofwar with Russia in
1804, he struck gold and silver coins atthe Erivan and Ganja mints, and silver
ones atNukha. Until 1804 itis probable that neither the Shah nor his entourage
fully apprehended the extent of the Russian threat. Itwould simply be perceived
in terms of the type oftrans-border skirmishing inwhich the Iranians engaged
with their other neighbours, while it would betaken as axiomatic that local
rulers in such circumstances would attempt toplay off one potential overlord
against another. It is unlikely that anyone in Tehran then imagined thatthe

Russian government in Saint Petersburg might be planning outright annex
ation, or that the pro-consular ambitions of local Russian commanders inthe
field would tend to promote just such an outcome. It was the manner ofhis
dealings with the Russians as much as anything else that made contemporary
British observers assume that Fath cAli Shah lived in a world of fantasy.
Ignorant ofthe world beyond his frontiers hecertainly was, butto blame him for
failure to anticipate the subsequent course of Russian expansionism is to read
back into the early years of the reign subsequent developments which few,
around 1800, could have predicted.
When Fath AllShah became king, hewas about twenty-six years old. Born in
the early 1770s, when Karim Khan Zand wasin control of the greater part of
western and central Iran, he grew up in that period when Agha Muhammad
Khan wasmaking an apparently desperate bid to topple Zand hegemony. He
doubtless experienced the vicissitudes characteristic of such a time. Chosen by
his forbidding uncle at an early ageto be his heir, by the time he acquired the
throne hehad already seen a decade of hard campaigning. It cannot have beenan
easy apprenticeship. Agha Muhammad Khan waspitiless towards his enemies,
but he could be no less implacable towards his ownkin.Thefuture Shah must
more than once have trembled for hishead during hisuncle's terrible rages. But
whatever the consequences of such an upbringing, by the time of his accession
Fath A.1I Shah hadcome to evince certain quite distinctive traits. It was not that
he could not exert himself in a crisis (which he would continue to do, intermit
tently, down tothe closing months ofthe reign), butthat hepreferred toenjoy to
the full what had been toiled for so strenuously: to rule with a magnificence
which the ceremony of the court was designed to enhance to the uttermost.
Malcolm wrote that "On extraordinary occasions nothing can exceed the
splendour of the Persian court. It presents a scene of the greatest magnificence,
regulated by the most disciplined order. There is no part of the government to
which so much attention is paid as the strictest maintenance of those forms and
ceremonies, which are deemed essential tothe power and glory ofthe monarch." 2
Sometimes, Fath cAli Shah showed cruelty reminiscent of Agha Muhammad
Khan's, as in his treatment of his first prime minister. He also consistently
displayed the avarice characteristic of his uncle, but he lacked the latter's
extraordinary energy, andhispersonal indifference to ostentatious luxury. Fath
All Shah was indolent, self-indulgent, vain and capricious; but his indolence
generally ensured that he was not the scourge to those close to him that his

predecessor had been. Tohis credit, allobservers agreed that helooked every
inch a king, strikingly handsome, with a typical Qajar physiognomy. In most
respects hewas conventional. He was dignified and affable and, while showing
conventional piety, a pleasure-seeker. James Baillie Fraser wrote that " . . . his
dispositions are by no means bad: for aPersian monarch he is neither considered
cruel, nor disposed toinjustice; he is sincere inhis religious professions". Fraser
goes on to say that the king seldom took wines orspirits and was not debauched.
He had, however, " . . . no title tocourage; on the contrary he is reported tohave
behaved in a very questionable manner on the few occasions where he was
required to face danger". And he was certainly notgenerous. Fraser thought
him ". . . possessed of very little talent, and no strength of mind; sufficiently
calculated tolive as arespectable private character, but quite unfit tobe the king
of such a country; hecould neither have succeeded to the throne, nor kepthis
seat there had not his powerful and crafty uncle worked forhim, removing by
force or guile every individual likely to give himtrouble, and hadnot the
surrounding countries been socircumstanced that no danger could reach him
from abroad".3
The Shah's intelligence remains anopen question. James Morier, the creator
ofHa/jJBaba of Isfahan,and Alexander Burnes in his mocking account of his own
reception in the royal durbar, represent him almost as a figure of fun in the
manner of one ofRossini's comic-opera Pashas. Other Europeans who met him
found him vivacious and inquisitive; and Malcolm thought that Fath All Shah
had, "by the comparative mildness and justice of his rule entitled himself to a
high rank among theKings of Persia".4
Fath AllShah reigned for nearly four decades, and although hewas twice
defeated by the Russians and had to suffer the deviousness of European
diplomats, such matters were temporary aggravations as compared with the
ceaseless quest forready cash, the constant intrigues ofcourtiers and ministers,
the ambitions of provincial governors andtribal leaders, the riotous affrays
which might suddenly engulf whole cities, and above all, the crises occasioned
by the rivalries ofthat enormous brood ofsons and daughters who bore witness
to his sexual potency andappetite.5
The feuding of the Shah's progeny supplied the ground-swell which
moulded the configuration ofthe reign. Fath AIT Shah followed the custom of
earlier Iranian dynasties in distributing provincial governorships among his

sons and grandsons, to prepare them for the exigencies of what was still
perceived to be a shared family responsibility, but also to keep them from
conspiring with, or against, each other. In Fath cAli Shah's calculations, this was
at the same time a means of alleviating the burden on the central treasury, since
the prince-governors were required to maintain themselves from the revenues
of their provinces. In addition, the system implicitly enabled the Shah to
maintain that equilibrium among the diverse political elements in the country
which at least one scholar has diagnosed as the essence of Qajar despotism.6 The
advantages of "farming out" the Shah^adas (the king's sons) to the provinces
were obvious, but were offset by risks of another kind. In his provincial
headquarters, often far removed from the scrutiny of Tehran, the prince
governor might nourish exaggerated ambitions, inflated by his sense of self
importance as lord of his little kingdom, and flattered by his entourage and local
notables; enough encouragement might tempt him to build up a local power
base, as the prince-governors of both Kirmanshah and Fars were to do.
Depending upon the importance of their provinces and the extent of their
resources, the prince-governors (the actual title was beglerbegi) maintained their
own courts; provincial administrations with va^lrs and revenue officials
{mustaufls)', a military establishment of retainers resembling the royal ghulams in
the capital; and all the inevitable hangers-on who sought to fatten themselves
upon the prince-governor's patronage, and gambled on his prospects as a future
contender for the throne. In some instances, the prince-governors were minors,
and in such cases, in addition to their staff of regular officials, they had attached
to their household a tutor and mentor whose role, in relation to his charge,
resembled that of the atabegs of Saljuq times.
Among the band of rival siblings in the Qajar royal house, the most
formidable, until his death in 1821,wasthe first-born, Muhammad All Mirza. A
Georgian concubine's offspring, he wasineligible for the succession, but proved
himself an energetic, resourceful and ruthless leader, with several of the traits of
his great-uncle, Agha Muhammad Khan. All acquainted with him acknowl
edged his audacity and courage, as well as less attractive qualities. Of him itwas
said that, on Agha Muhammad Khan enquiring of him, as a six-year old, what
his first action would be, were he to become Shah, he replied: "To have you
strangled!" Only the intervention of Fath All Shah's mother saved the child
from immediate execution. Muhammad All Mirza was one of five sons to be
born to Fath All Shah in a single lunar year (1203/1788—9). It must have been

obvious that, with the passage oftime, these particular siblings would become
bitter rivals, and such was, indeed, tobe the case. They included the future Vail
cahd (heir-apparent), Abbas Mirza, the son of a Develii Qajar mother and
designated by Agha Muhammad Khan to be Fath All Shah's successor; the
violent and intemperate Muhammad Vail Mirza, future beglerbegi first of
Khurasan, and then Yazd; and also Husain All Mirza, future beglerbegi ofFars
and aninveterate intriguer. Between Muhammad All Mirza and Abbas Mirza,
in particular, intense hostility developed, which, some believed, was not unwel
come to the Shah.7
In 1799,tne y e a r following his father's enthronement, Abbas Mirza, then ten
years old, was granted the title ofNaDib al-Saltana to indicate that he was tobe the
heir tothe throne, and was appointed beglerbegi ofAzarbaljan, with his capital
at Tabriz. His mentor was the venerable Sulaiman Khan Qajar, acousin ofAgha
Muhammad Khan. His vazir was Mirza cIsa Farahani, known asMirza Buzurg,
the nephew of Mirza Husain Farahani, a former vazir of Karlm Khan Zand.
Abbas Mirza remained resident beglerbegi ofAzarbaljan until 1831,8 and it was
he, in the first instance, who had to face the Russians in the war of 1804—1813,
and who unsuccessfully attempted to retrieve his honour in thesecond war of
1826—8. Butthese crisis years, though very significant, constituted two com
paratively short periods inhis extended rule over the most advanced, aswellas
the most exposed, province of the kingdom. In his time, Tabriz flourished as a
commercial and cultural centre, ironically, partly because theRussian frontier
had crept so close. Intimes ofpeace, Abbas Mirza passed his summers in Tabriz
and hiswinters in Khuy, interrupted by frequent visits to Tehran in order to
protect his interests at court. Although he spoke no European language, he
fraternized with Europeans toafargreater extent than any other member ofthe
royal family. Before his premature death in 1833, he wasregarded by those
Europeans who believed that Iran needed reform and alarge degree ofwestern
ization, as the oneman capable of initiating a national revival.9
By way ofcontrast, Muhammad All Mirza, although described as being the
"most able and warlike ofall the princes ofPersia",10 was regarded by European
observers as incurably reactionary. About 1802, his father appointed him
7 Monteith, pp. 58-9. 8 Hedidnotcease to bebeglerbegi of Azarbaljan in 1831, butin that year hewas appointed, in addition, beglerbegi of Khurasan, with theobjective of pacifying that province and extending its frontiers. He remained nominally beglerbegi ofAzarbaljan, but one ofhis younger sons acted ashis deputy and was de facto governor.

beglerbegi of Kirmanshah, Luristan andKhuzistan, an extensive bailiwick of
great strategic importance, since Kirmanshah lay athwart the ancient highway to
Baghdad and the Atabat, the Shici holy places in Mesopotamia: a major
thoroughfare for commerce and pilgrimage. The need to assert control over a
large and turbulent tribal population provided opportunities formilitary action
on thepart of this warlike prince. He could thus enhance his reputation as a
commander inthe field, while, once pacified, the tribes supplied fine recruitsfor
his private army. Inaddition, he was the channel of communication between the
Tehran government and the powerful Kurdish leader, the Vail of Ardalan,
Aman-Allah Khan (c. 1800-24), a potential ally. Muhammad cAli Mirza's
reputation as a stern administrator, asthecreator of an effective military force
devoted to his service, andas thepacifier of warlike tribes was enhanced by
several spectacular campaigns directed against the vilayat of Baghdad and one
brilliant raid into Russian-held territory. Not surprisingly, he began toappear a
serious threat, not only to cAbbas Mirza's succession, but to Fath cAli Shah
himself.
During the early 19th century, the beglerbegi's main concerns were keeping
the peace andcollecting revenue. Outside the larger towns, his effectiveness
depended upon his ability to cajole or coerce prominent landowners and tribal
leaders. In Kirmanshah, Muhammad cAli Mirza kept the tribes ona tight rein,
but in thegovernments of Isfahan andFars there were frequent disputesand
"incidents" involving the beglerbegi's agents and the local tribal leadership. In
urban centres, the provincial administration made its will felt through the town
governors and, below them, through the darughas and kalantars, while it
depended for support and information at the "grass roots" level upon the
kadkhudas of the quarters (see pp. 139—40). Although forday-to-day purposes,
the kalantar and the kadkhudas were the usual channels of communication
through which theurban population expressed its anxieties andgrievances to
their rulers, an alternative source of information and protest, and even a rival
source ofauthority tothe Shah's representatives, lay with the ShIcI Qulama. Only
the most imprudent official would lightly provoke their wrath.
The oppositional role of the culama in Qajar Iran is well documented,11 but
while, at one level, opposition to and non-cooperation with the regime by the
culama was consistent with the belief that, in the absence ofthe Hidden Imam,
exercise of authority bya Shah and hisagents was illegitimate, at another, the
practical workings of society necessitated some degree of compromise to the

point atwhich aruler might be accepted as the Imam's Ncfib-Khass, so long as he
demonstrated atleast amodicum of piety and respect for the culama. Both Agha
Muhammad Khan and Fath All Shah did this. With Muhammad Shah, the third
Qajar ruler, with his Sufi leanings and hisemotional dependence upon Hajji
MIrza AghasI, thesituation changed.
However much the culama were prepared to acquiesce in the status quoand
work with the agents ofgovernment, there were times when anoppressive or
exceptionally high-handed governor, or some other high official, clashed with
the local religious leadership. Such clashes constituted some ofthe most serious
internal crises with which theQajar regime had to deal. A classic example of
confrontation between the government and alocal alliance ofculama and urban
malcontents was thevirtual taking over of Isfahan in thelate 1830's by Hajji
Sayyid Muhammad Baqir, supported by the city's iuth (bands ofruffians) which
only ended with the occupation ofIsfahan bythe troops ofits new governor,
Manuchihr Khan Muctamad al-Daula.12 Manuchihr Khan was one ofa handful
of high officials who, inevery decade, contributed tothe regime's survival. The
typical view of Qajar times, which has been reinforced by picturesque anecdotes
in the writings of 19th-century European travellers, isthat the central bureauc
racy was both venal and vicious. Itmay well have been, but future historians will
have to look again at all the evidence, and with more open minds. At present, it is
enough to say that there must have been some exceptions: otherwise, it is
difficult to understand how thegovernment of Fath AllShah functioned as
effectively as itdid, or how Qajar rule survived for so long. Certainly, there were
some individuals who continued to fit the mould of the traditional Iranian
bureaucrat, and deserve a place beside the ablest servants ofthe Saljuqs or the
Safavids.
One such was MIrza Buzurg, Abbas MIrza's vazlr, who about 1809—10 also
became deputy to the Sadr-i ac%am (prime minister), MIrza ShafTc, and received
the honorific title, Qa'im-Maqam. His distinguished career ended when hedied
of the plague in 1822. Another was his son, MIrza Abu3l-Qasim, known as the
second Qa°im-Maqam, who assumed his father's offices and titles. He had ahand
in negotiating the Treaty ofErzerum of 1823 with the Porte, and also the Treaty
of Turkmanchai in 1828, and played a major role in ensuring the accession of
Muhammad MIrza, Abbas MIrza's eldest son, as Muhammad Shah. It was to be
his tragedy that the newruler, whom he served briefly as prime minister,

disliked his opposition to some of his measures andmistrusted his motives.
Muhammad Shah hadhimstrangled in 1835.
Another model administrator was Mlrza cAbd al-Vahhab Isfahanl, a cele
brated calligrapher and poet whose ancestors had served the Safavids as hakims
(doctors). In 1809, he was appointed munshl al-mamalik (head of the royal
chancellery), and granted the title, Muctamad al-Daula. From then until his death
in 1829, he seems to have increasingly drawn the most important aspects of
government into his own hands. Between 1821 and 1825, he was, ineffect, Iran's
first minister of foreign affairs. Together with his successor in this position,
Hajji Mlrza AbuDl-Hasan Khan, hestrongly opposed going to war with Russia
in 1826, thereby incurring the enmity ofthose mujtahids who were urging ajihad
against theunbelievers, butthis didnotdiminish Fath AllShah's regard for
him. During thelast years of his life, he functioned as de facto prime minister,
although the titular incumbent was Abd-Allah Khan Amln al-Daula.13The
impression which he left onatleast some European visitors was favourable to a
degree. In 1825, James Baillie Fraser found him, ". . .beyond all comparison the
most eminent man at court fortalents, probity, general popularity, and attach
ment to hismaster's interest". Hedescribes hismanners as simple and empha
sizes his honesty and freedom from intrigue. Also, he was able privately to warn
the king of the princes' misdemeanours. What is significant is that Fath All Shah
was willing to listen; and shrewd enough to trust such a man as the one
appointed to deal with European diplomats.14
Few members ofthe bureaucracy possessed any knowledge ofthe state ofthe
world beyond the Iranian frontiers, butone of the exceptions was Hajji Mlrza
Abu^l-Hasan Khan, a colourful figure whose unusual career typified the uncer
tainties ofstate service under the Qajars. His father, Mlrza Muhammad All,an
Isfahani by birth, had served Karim Khan Zand in the military paymaster's
office. He had also made a most successful marriage, tothe sister ofthe kalantar
of Shiraz, Hajji Ibrahim Khan, the future vazir of Agha Muhammad Khan.
Through Hajji Ibrahim Khan's influence, theson ofthis marriage, Hajji Mlrza
AbuJl-Hasan Khan, became deputy-governor ofShushtar. However, during the
spring of 1801, when Fath All Shah's vengeance fell upon almost all the
members of Hajji Ibrahim Khan's family, Hajji Mlrza Abu3l-Hasan Khan
escaped toBasra, undertook the hajj and then visited Hyderabad inthe Deccan,
where he became aconfidant ofthe Nizam, Sikandar Jah (1802—29). On learning

that the Shah hadpardoned the surviving members of Hajjl Ibrahim Khan's
family, he returned to Shiraz and briefly entered theservice of the beglerbegi,
Husain All MIrza, generally known as Farman-farma. He later joined the
service of Hajjl Muhammad Husain Khan Amln al-Daula Mustaufi al-mamalik^
who arranged hisappointment as the Shah's first ambassador to theCourt of
Saint James (1809—n ) . 1 5 His mission to London was satirized in Morier's
Adventures ofHajji Baba in England. He returned toIran in 1811,in time toassistin
negotiating the Treaty ofGulistan with Russia in 1813. In 1815, hewas senton
an unsuccessful mission to Saint Petersburg inaneffort tosecure the restitution
of Russian-occupied territory south ofthe Aras. In 1819, hewas despatched on
diplomatic business to Constantinople, Vienna, Paris and London. In 1825, he
succeeded MIrza Abd al-Vahhab asforeign minister and strongly opposedthe
1826-8 war with Russia, although he was to be oneof the negotiators of the
subsequent Treaty ofTurkmanchai. He accompanied Fath All Shah on his final
journey to Isfahan in 1834, and after the beglerbegi of Fars, Husain All MIrza
Farman-farma, hadappeared at court to explain his suspicious conduct, and
been dismissed from the presence, Hajjl MIrza AbuDl-Hasan Khan, together
with Abd-Allah Khan Amln al-Daula, was ordered toproceed to Shiraz with a
large military detachment, to collect theoverdue taxes andchastise therebel
lious Mamassani leader, Vail Khan. Before these instructions could be carried
out, however, the Shah died. Theexpedition never left Isfahan.
The disputed succession which ensued placed Hajjl MIrza Abui-Hasan
Khan, like other high officials, in a quandary. Hating theVail cahd's principal
advisor and prospective prime minister, MIrza AbuDl-Qasim, the second Qa°im
Maqam, he threw in his lot with All Shah Zill al-Sultan, another of the late
king's sons who, like Husain All MIrza, was a contender for the throne. With
Muhammad Shah's triumphant entry into Tehran, Hajjl MIrza AbuDl-Hasan
Khan's position became extremely dangerous. He took bast (sanctuary) at Shah
Abd al- Azlm, but after theexecution of the second Qa°im-Maqam the new
prime minister, Hajjl MIrza AghasI, restored him tothe foreign ministry (1838
45). Suavity, quick-wittedness, andtheresilience of the natural survivor had
stood him ingood stead, but most Europeans who dealt with him seem to have
mistrusted him. Fraser was no exception. Hewrote that Hasan Khan was less
respected and less deserving of respect than any other leading courtier. He
despised him as mean andutterly false, while hisnotoriously dissolute habits
disgusted every decent person at court.16

The careers of Mlrza Buzurg Qa°im-Maqam, his son, Mirza AbuDl-Qasim,
Mirza cAbd al-Vahhab Muctamad al-Daula, and Hajji Mirza Abu'l-Hasan Khan
exemplified aspects of the profession of the traditional mlr^a. Another successful
career, illustrating a rather different butalso long-established way of climbing
the ladder to royal favour, was that of the influential Georgian eunuch,
Manuchihr Khan Gurji. A trusted household slave and confidant of Fath All
Shah, he rose within the palace hierarchy to be Ishik Aqasi Bashl (court
chamberlain). Inthat capacity he acted with Hajji Mirza AbuDl-Hasan Khan, the
foreign minister, as an advisor to Abbas Mirza in thenegotiations preceding
the Treaty ofTurkmanchai. Following the death of Abd al-Vahhab Muctamad
al-Daula in 1829, theShah bestowed the latter's title on Manuchihr Khan and
thereafter heseems tohave functioned aswhat today would bedescribed as an
official "trouble-shooter", a role which hecontinued to play after Muhammad
Shah's accession in 1834. Thus in 1835, following the refusal ofthe new Shah's
uncle, Husain AllMirza Farman-farma, to acknowledge hisnephew's acces
sion, Manuchihr Khan, acting on behalf of the governor-designate of Fars,
Firuz Mirza, the new Shah's younger brother, marched onShlraz, accompanied
by troops under the command ofSir Henry Lindsay Bethune. Husain All Mirza
was arrested andtheauthority of the central government swiftly re-asserted.
The punitive expedition against the Mamassani ordered by Fath All Shah on the
eve of his death was now undertaken with exemplary brutality.
Two years later, Muhammad Shah appointed Manuchihr Khan to be
beglerbegi of Kirmanshah, Luristan and Khuzistan in place of the Shah's
brother, Bahram Mirza Mucizz al-Daula. Then, in 1839—40, asa consequenceof
protracted unrest in Isfahan, where the mujtahid, Hajji Sayyid Muhammad
Baqir, helped by the city's lutls, had severely damaged the central government's
authority, the province of Traq-i Ajam was added toManuchihr Khan's already
great responsibilities. Hebecame in effect theviceroy of much of centraland

was inviolable, but no longer a serious menance.17 After showing that he would
not tolerate recalcitrance even among the culama, Manuchihr Khan crushed an
incipient demonstration of insubordination by the Bakhtiyari chieftain,
Muhammad Taqi Khan. Henry Layard detested Manuchihr Khan forhis

treatment ofhis Bakhtiyari friends, but grudgingly acknowledged the effective
ness of his methods.18
Until hisdeath in 1847, Manuchihr Khan continued tightly to control his
enormous bailiwick. He governed inIsfahan instyle, but was ever ready tolead
his troops into the surrounding regions to discipline refractory tribes. Healso
seems tohave been aware ofthe upheavals likely tofollow the Shah's death.He
anticipated them by creating a following amenable to hisviews in the Shah's
household. In the 1840s he appeared one of the most powerful menin the
country. It is said that on one occasion he was summoned to Tehran by
Muhammad Shah, who remarked, "I have heard that youare like a king in
Isfahan", to which he replied, "Yes, Your Majesty, that is true, and you must
have such kings as your governors, in order to enjoy the title of King of
Kings."19 Like most effective Qajar officials, he combined ability andenergy
with avarice and cruelty, but as often happened, the more positive aspects ofhis
work quickly vanished with his departure from the scene. What the Qajar
administrative system pre-eminently lacked was continuity and consistency in
its leadership, without which a bureaucracy cannot be said to be truly
institutionalised.20
Under Agha Muhammad Khan, the civil administration ofthe kingdom had
been quite rudimentary, butthesituation changed with theaccession of Fath
CA1I Shah. Whether by design or in response to need, the number of office
holders began to proliferate. This process continued until, during the reign of
Muhammad Shah, Hajji Mirza Aghasi enlarged their numbers beyond all
bounds with his reckless promotion of his kinsmen and proteges. Under
Fath CA1IShah, amustaufi al-mamalik (controller-general) was appointed, with a
number of mustaufis subordinate to him. The importance of this office is
indicated by the relatively lengthy tenure ofsuccessive incumbents, demonstrat
ing the need for continuity and for mastery of the expertise traditionally
associated with exchequer procedures and the techniques ofsiyaq^ the notation
used by the revenue officials. The growing complexity ofthe military establish
ment meant the creation of the post of va^lr-i lashkar (chief muster-master). In
addition, there were established the offices ofmunshl al-mamalik^ to overseethe
royal chancery, of muaiyir al-mamalik (mintmaster), andof sahib-i divan-khana,

whose duties seem to have included authorization of the disbursement of funds.
These offices, or more accurately, their functions were notnew: most were
rooted in Safavid administrative practice. But with the decay of bureaucratic
institutions during the troubles of the 18thcentury and with Agha Muhammad
Khan's preference for only theminimum clerical activity, such ministerial
positions had to be resuscitated.21
This was most obviously the case with the office ofthe principal vazir, or
prime minister. Atotal ofseven served the first two Shahs ofthe 19th century:

Khan Amin al-Daula (1828—34, second term of office); Mirza Abu3l-Qasim
Qa°im-Maqam (1834-5); and HajjT Mirza Aghasi (1835—48). The first Qajar
prime minister, Hajjl Ibrahim Khan, was given the title ofTtimad al-Daula^ a
relic of Safavid times. In 1801,he was put to death in the cruellest possible
manner by Fath All Shah, warned by his predecessor not to trust the man who
had betrayed the Zands. The title of Ttimad al-Daula remained unused again
until Nasir al-DIn Shah's time and his second prime minister, Mirza Agha Khan
Nurl, in 1851. Fath All Shah revived the title Sadr-i A\am. After the dismissal
of the second Amin al-Daula — the first had been his father, who wasalso Sadr-i
Aczam — in 1825,hewas, uncharacteristically, replaced bya Qajar nobleman,
Allah-Yar Khan Qajar Develu Asaf al-Daula. Neither henor his predecessor
were designated Sadr-i Aczam, but had chief minister's functions. In 1826 the
Shah sent Allah-Yar Khan tojoin the Vali cahd, cAbbas Mirza, on the Russian
front where hecampaigned with the Crown Prince, was captured whenthe
Russians took Tabriz in October 1827, but released in time for the negotiations
at Turkmanchai. Fath All Shah appears to have blamed himfor inciting the Vali
ahd to undertake what hadproved to bea disastrous war,22 andat Nauruz,1828,
restored cAbd-Allah Khan Amin al-Daula as first minister, hence his being with
the Shah on the latter's death in 1834. But hefailed to support Muhammad
Shah's accession and waslater exiled to thecAtabat, the Holy Places in
Mesopotomia, where he died in 1847, having hadall his property in Iran
confiscated.23
As has been said, Muhammad Shah's first prime minister was Mirza AbuDl

Qasim Qa°im-Maqam, whom he soon had strangled. The appointment followed
immediately of Hajjl Mirza Aghasi, who was born in Erivan in 1783—4 andhad
studied Sufism and theology in thecAtabat and become a favourite at thecourt
of cAbbas Mirza, to whose son he become both tutor and murshid (spiritual
guide). Thus he exercised an extraordinary influence over hisformer pupil; he
was to bethevirtual ruler of the kingdom from 1835 until Muhammad Shah's
death in 1848.
This brief review ofthose who held the office ofprime minister between 1797
and 1848 suggests a greater deal of administrative continuity, at the highest
level, than might otherwise have been supposed. Fath CA1I Shah had five prime
ministers in thirty-seven years (with one serving two terms of office) and
Muhammad Shah, two infourteen years. Several ofthese men were, bycommon
report, persons of real capacity. Malcolm, writing in 1815, found it hard to
describe these Iranian prime ministers' functions precisely. He said that their
duties depended on how much of their sovereign's favour and confidence they
enjoyed, and onthe king's indolence orcompetence. He added that they were at
the mercy of royal caprice and preoccupied with waiting ontheking, and "the
intricacies of private intrigues"; their lives and property were "always in
peril".24
No permanent ministries or designated offices for thehigh officials of state
existed. Insecurity of tenure andtheprime minister's lack of a regular place in
which to transact business, and his need to keep near the royal presence,
reinforced foreign observers' impression of the capricious and idiosyncratic
character of Iranian government under the Qajars.
The insouciance which European observers attributed to theconduct of the
civil administration extended tothat ofthe military. The general perception was
that, with the death of Agha Muhammad Khan, there had been a rapid
deterioration inthe fighting capacity ofthe armed forces, and that thereafter and
for the remainder of the period ofQajar rule, their performance left much to be
desired. Against this pessimistic assessment, several British officers seconded to
cAbbas Mirza's service pointed out that, on occasion, units of the cavalry
performed well when ledbya trusted commander. Against superior European
discipline and technology, however, Iranian units generally performed poorly,

though often with great courage, as inboth the wars with Russia. Itwas largelya
matter of mismanagement and indiscipline, and in this regard, the European
officered battalions of Abbas Mirza's Ni^am-i Jadzd (new army) did not perform
much better than the traditional militias and tribal units. The British envoy,Sir
Harford Jones, observed that units trained by British officers onEuropean lines
were less impressive than the mounted irregular levies trained and equippedby
Muhammad All Mirza.25
The size and effectiveness ofthe army under Fath All Shah and Muhammad
Shah fluctuated in response to need and fiscal exigency. It was organized into
two distinct sections: traditional forces dating from the time of Agha
Muhammad Khan, and units on the European model favoured by Abbas Mirza.
The traditional part comprised three categories of troops: royal ghulams,
irregular tribal levies, andthemilitia. The ghulams were theShah's personal
bodyguard of well-armed and well-mounted horsemen, many of them Georgian
slaves, commanded by young Qajar nobles. In the 1820s they numbered
between three and four thousand men. Similar establishments on a smaller scale
were maintained by provincial governors; those ruling over particularly turbu
lent or exposed provinces, such asKhurasan or Kirmanshah, maintained what
were in effect personal armies.
Secondly, there were the irregular cavalry levies provided by the tribes,
usually under the command of their respective chieftains. Theoretically, these
levies were atthe Shah's disposal intime ofneed. Inpractice, only certain tribes
were consistently dependable. Thirdly, was the militia raised bythe provincial
and city governors among a population which wasstill armed to the teeth,
although lacking formal training or discipline. Among the provincial militias,
those of Mazandaran and Astarabad were regarded asparticularly formidable.
Taken as a whole, these units were adequate formaintaining a sporadic kind
of order throughout thekingdom, especially if they were ledby a leader like
Agha Muhammad Khan; to withstand the Russians, something more was
needed. Hence Abbas Mirza's regular troops, trained and equipped after the
European manner. These regulars were first instructed byFrench officers, and
then byBritish, aswell assome Russian renegades and other European soldiers
of fortune. After the Treaty of Gulistan, this new army, the Nizam-i Jadid,
comprised horse-artillery with twenty field-pieces, 12,000 regular cavalry, and
12,000 regular infantry. The last consisted of twelve battalions with a nominal
strength of a thousand men in each. They were grouped into nine regiments

FATH CALI SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
according to tribe or region. According to Malcolm, writing in 1815, they
consisted of 2,000 Afshars, 2,000 Shaqaqls, 1,000 Dunbulls, 1,000 Muqaddams,
1,000 Kangarlus, 1,000 men from Qarajadagh, 1,000 from Tabriz, 2,000 from
Marand and 1,000 from the Khanate of Erivan.26 Fraser, a few years later, listed
2,000 Shaqaqis, 2,000 from Qarajadagh, 2,000 from Tabriz, 1,000 from Marand,
1,000 from Khuy, 1,000 from Maragha, 1,000 from Urmiya, 1,000 from the
Khanate of Nakhchivan, and 1,000 grenadiers, described as the Russian battal
ion, perhaps because it was largely officered by Russian deserters.27 Whatever
the precise composition of the individual regiments, however, it is clear that the
Nizam-i Jadld was recruited almost exclusively from Azarbaljan and the neigh
bouring Khanates. This was Abbas Mirza's own army, but in addition to it,the
Shah supposedly maintained a parallel military establishment, composed of
regular infantry, cavalry and horse-artillery. By all accounts this was something
of a token force, less well-trained, less disciplined and invariably below strength.
The only units of it which earned praise from British officers were two battalions
of Bakhtiyarl tribesmen.28
The presence of European officers as instructors with the Iranian army was a
direct consequence of the way in which European Great Power rivalries during
the era of the Napoleonic Wars had penetrated Iran. It is with the diplomatic
wrangling of British, French and Russian envoys at the court of the Shah, and
Iran's two disastrous armed conflicts with Russia, that the reign of Fath All
Shah is most frequently associated; or, to put it another way, in so far as the reign
is regarded as being of significance, it is because it marks the first phase of Iran's
painful encounter with the West. This perception of the reign, however, is
largely conditioned by the wisdom of hindsight and a Eurocentric vision of
world history. It is by no means certain that Fath All Shah and his Iranian
contemporaries would have interpreted the age in which they lived in such a
way. For in many respects, conditions in Iran during the reigns of Fath All Shah
and Muhammad Shah differed hardly at all from those of the preceding century.
Early 1 cjth-century Iran was still a traditional, deeply conservative society, little
affected inwardly by its often disagreeable encounters with the European
powers, and devoted to its Shici faith and the preservation of Islamic values.The
Qajar Shahs, all-powerful autocrats though they seemed, lacking any spiritual
charisma were forced to conciliate the culama and demonstrate piety through
charitable endowments and the building or repair of mosques and madrasas (see
pp. 910—12). Malcolm, who paid close attention to the religious institutions of

FATH ALI SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
Fath All Shah's Iran, recognized the singular importance ofthe mujtahids in
that society when he wrote: "The ecclesiastical class, which includes the priests
who officiate inthe offices ofreligion, and those who expound the law aslaid
down inthe Koran and the books oftraditions, are deemed, by the defenceless
part of the population, asthe principal shield between them and the absolute
authority of their monarch. The superiors of this class enjoy a consideration that
removes them from those personal apprehensions to which almost all others are
subject. The people have a right toappeal tothem inall ordinary cases, where
there appears an outrage against law and justice, unless when the disturbed state
of the country calls forthe exercise of military power."29
European travellers in Iran in the 19th century frequently failed to see the
wood forthe trees, but inMalcolm's case, hewas able to describe the unique
position of the senior ulama in relation to society as awhole. "It is not easy", he
wrote, "todescribe persons who fill nooffice, receive noappointment, who
have no specific duties, but who are called, from their superior learning, piety
and virtue, by the silent but unanimous suffrage of the inhabitants of the country
in which they live, to be their guides in religion, and their protectors against the
violence and oppression oftheir rulers, and who receive from those by whose
feelings they are elevated a respect and duty which lead the proudest kings to
join the popular voice, and topretend, if they do not feel, a veneration for the
man who has attained this sacred rank. There are seldom more than three or four
priests of the dignity of Mooshtahed {sic) in Persia. Their conduct is expectedto
be exemplary, and to show noworldly bias; neither must they connect them
selves with the king or the officers of the government. They seldom depart from
that character towhich they owe their rank . . . When a mooshtahed dies, his
successor is always aperson of the most eminent rank in the ecclesiastical order;
and, though he may be pointed out tothe populace by others of the same class
seeking him as an associate, itis rare to hear of any intrigues being employed to
obtain this enviable dignity."30
Fath CA1IShah endeavoured topresent himself as apious, God-fearing ruler
who listened to the words of theculama and set an example as the fount of justice
and charity. His sons followed hisexample. In the case of Muhammad cAli
Mirza, for example, the prince's intended assault on Baghdad was turned aside in
1804 and again in 1812 by the pleas ofShaikh Jacfar NajafT; in 1818,he accepted
the mediation of Agha Ahmad Kirmanshahi of Karbala in a dispute with
Sulaiman Pasha, the ruler of the Baghdad vilayat. In 1821, hewithdrew from

conduct ofthe royal family towards theculama. In some respects, and withinthe
constraints implicit in the doctrine of the Hidden Imam's exercise of sover
eignty, Fath CA1IShah could pose as anacceptable Na'ib-Khass (Special Deputy)
of the Sahib al-Zanfan (Lord ofthe Age: the Hidden Imam).

PATH CALI SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
Fath cAlI Shah's reign falls into five phases. First, the years of consolidation
between 1797 and 1804, when, had he demonstrated sufficient energy, he might
have integrated northern and eastern Khurasan with the rest ofthe kingdom,
pacified the Tiirkmens beyond the Atrak, and perhaps annexed Marv orHerat.
Instead, he only undertook desultory military progresses which achieved little
and were called ofTwith the approach of autumn, when the Shah hurried back to
his capital. Secondly, the phase of the first war with Russia, from 1804 to 1813,
and of the diplomatic wooing of Iran, first by France and then by Great Britain,
which both flattered the court and aroused its greed, only in the end to provoke
disillusion. The war did not go on continuously, and not all the news was bad,
but the cost was ruinous and, by the time that itwas all over, the new dynasty had
been profoundly humiliated.
During the third phase, the thirteen years between 1813 and 1826, the court
nursed its wounds, consumed the British subsidy and sought to compensate its
loss of prestige by attacking less dangerous neighbours. One of Fath All Shah's
younger sons, Hasan All Mirza Shujac al-Saltana, who had recently replaced his
brother, Muhammad Vali Mirza, as beglerbegi of Khurasan, defeated aforce of
Afghans atKafir Qilac in 1818, while inthe same year Muhammad All Mirza,
beglerbegi of Kirmanshah, raided Ottoman Kurdistan. In 1820 war wasfor
mally declared between the Ottoman Sultan and the Shah, and both Muhammad
All Mirza, operating from Kirmanshah, and Abbas Mirza, from his base at
Tabriz, launched attacks on Ottoman territory. Muhammad CA1I Mirza madea
successful advance towards Baghdad, but was forced tofall back by a cholera
epidemic to which he himself fell victim in November 1821. Abbas Mirza
distinguished himself by taking Bayazit and Toprak Qalca, and moving on
towards Erzerum, while asecond column captured Bitlis and advanced towards
Diyarbakr. The Ottoman counter-attack was repelled by Abbas Mirza at Khiiy
(May 1822), but the cholera was by now also raging through his army, andhe
therefore opted for peace, which was signed atErzerum inthe following July.
The war against theOttomans had provided a much-needed boost to the
hitherto sagging reputation of the Vail cahd, but had not removed the main
preoccupation of the court: the continuous rivalries among the Shahzadas and
the way in which these rivalries might affect the succession.
In theory, of course, this matter had already been settled, atthe time ofthe
marriage of Fath AllShah (then himself heir-apparent) to Abbas Mirza's
mother. This marriage, with the subsequent birth of Abbas Mirza, had been
part of Agha Muhammad Khan's grand design for the perpetuation of the
dynasty. In reality, however, there was no such thing as a fixed law of succession:

FATH ALI SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
at Fath All Shah's death, itwould be acase of the survival of the fittest. During
the first half of the reign, the most obvious threat to Abbas Mirza's succession
had come from Muhammad AIT Mirza in Kirmanshah. Fortunately for Abbas
Mirza, however, and perhaps forFath All Shah too, the cholera epidemicof
1821 removed Muhammad All Mirza from the scene.32
Other contenders remained. Two ofthe most dangerous were Husain All
Mirza Farman-farma, beglerbegl of Fars (1799-1835), andhis full-brother,
Hasan All Mirza Shujac al-Saltana, beglerbegl ofKhurasan (c. 1816/17-1823),
and of Kirman(i827/8-i83 5). The former was the same age as Abbas Mirza; he
ruled a comparatively remote and rich satrapy; and among his subjects were
warlike and turbulent tribes who, half a century earlier, had been among the
bulwarks of Zand ascendancy. Fars, moreover, had atradition of going its own
way, and since Hajji Ibrahim Khan and his family had aroused the resentment of
Fath All Shah in 1801, the Shlrazls had been viewed with suspicion at court.
Husain All Mirza and his entourage were regarded as congenital intriguers, and
were as closely scrutinized as possible. During the last five years of his reign, the
Shah felt compelled on three separate occasions to attend personally to the
affairs of Fars: in 1829, when he himself went to Shlraz;in 1831, when he went as
far asIsfahan and summoned Husain All Mirza tohis presence; and in 1834,
when heagain went to Isfahan (on the eve of his death) and after receiving
Husain All Mirza in audience, despatched the prime minister and other high
officials to Shlraz to enquire into the state of the province.
Hasan AllMirza Shujac al-Saltana was a younger man than Husain All
Mirza, but the size and importance of his charge, Khurasan, made him a person
of great consequence, not least because both the turbulence of the province and
its exposure to Afghan and Turkmen raiders required the beglerbegl to maintain
a considerable military establishment. This, inturn, provided opportunities for
the beglerbegl to acquire amartial reputation. Hasan All Mirza had fought the
Afghans in 1818 atKafir Qilac and claimed agreat victory (or so itwas reported
in Tehran, although there is some uncertainty astothe actual outcome of the
engagement). During the course of the 1820—2 war with the Ottomans, rumours
reached the court of disaffection onthe part of both Husain All Mirza and
32 Fath AH Shah may have regarded Muhammad CA1I Mirza as a potential rival and would not have been happy with the opinion that the prince "is thought by many to be the most powerful of all the governors in the empire, not excepting the Shah himself"; Buckingham, Travels1, p. 178. When news of the prince's death reached Tehran, Fraser noted with surprise the apparent lack of grief on the part of the Shah; op.cit. 1, pp. 148-9. Itwas obvious to all that the death of Muhammad AITMirza, while dashing thehopes of his faction at court, hadgreatly reduced thethreat of a disputed
succession; ibid.1, pp. 145-6. For Fath CA1I Shah's supposed suspicions of cAbbas Mirza, see Fowler, Three Years in Persia 11, pp. 11and 38—9.

FATH CALI SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
Hasan cAli Mirza. Whatever the truth behind these rumours, the signing of the
peace treaty atErzerum and the enhanced reputation of Abbas Mirza as a result
of his performance inthe field probably alerted the two brothers totheir danger.
Husain cAli Mirza urged that both ofthem should hasten tocourt and refute the
charges which were being levelled against them. Husain CA1IMirza appeared in
Tehran inDecember 1822 and Hasan CA1IMirza inMarch 1823. The former was
exculpated and returned to Shiraz, but the latter was stripped ofhis governor
ship andsent into internal exile. Heaccompanied Husain cAlI Mirza as far as
Isfahan and there he remained inrelative obscurity forseveral years until he was
restored to favour andappointed governor of Kirman.
This wasby no means an isolated case of Fath CA1I Shah's willingness to
chastise wayward sons. Hasan CA1IMIrza's predecessor as beglerbegl of
Khurasan, Muhammad Vail Mirza, had been treated with even greater severity.
Muhammad Vali Mirza was another of Fath CA1I Shah's sons to beborn in the
same year as Muhammad All Mirza, Abbas Mirza, and Husain CA1I Mirza. In
the autumn of 1802, the Shah, in the course of besieging Mashhad, which had
been seized byNadir Mirza, the son of the last Afsharid, Shahrukh, appointed
Muhammad Vali Mirza beglerbegl of Khurasan and, himself returning to
Tehran, left his son to continue the investment of the city, which early in 1803
opened its gates to the besiegers. Some years later, Muhammad Vali Mirza
imprudently lavished favours upon the ambitious chieftain, Ishaq Khan of
Turbat-i Haidari, even appointing him sardar (commander) of his troops.
Emboldened by these favours, Ishaq Khan openly dared to challenge the
authority of the beglerbegl, plotted to make himself independent with the
assistance ofother rebellious chiefs and with help from the Afghans (which was
denied him), andeventually made his master his prisoner. Muhammad Vali
Mirza managed to escape and make hisway to Tehran, where he secured the
Shah's approval forthe assassination ofIshaq Khan and his sons, which in due
course was carried out. However, thereafter the affairs ofKhurasan degenerated
into such chaos that Fath CA1I Shah was forced to intervene and replace
Muhammad Vali Mirza with hisbrother, Hasan AllMirza. Muhammad Vali
Mirza wasrecalled to Tehran in disgrace. Inflamed by treatment which he
regarded as unjust, he burst into his father's presence with his sword drawn and
abused him. For this, he was beaten and driven out ofthe palace. The prince was
unemployed and penurious fortwo or three years until sent to govern Yazd.33
33 Fraser, n, p. 28. As governor ofYazd, Muhammad Vali Mirza proved tobethe worst kindof Qajar proconsul, but even before his arrival in Yazd, that province had not been well served by its rulers; asa case-study it may befairly typical. See ibid, n, pp. 23-4.

FATH CALI SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
The fourth phase of Fath All Shah's reign comprised the brief, but disastrous
1826-8 warwith Russia, followed by the Treaty of Turkmanchai. It may be
conjectured that the immediate causes ofthis conflict were Abbas Mirza's need
to restore a reputation tarnished by earlier defeat atthe hands ofthe infidels, the
pressure to renew the struggle put upon him bythe prime minister, Allah-Yar
Khan Qajar, and the campaign fora jihad mounted bymujtahids such asAgha
Sayyid Muhammad Isfahanl.34 Certainly, had the Iranians gained a victory,
Abbas Mirza would have been its greatest beneficiary, but the second war with
Russia was even more disastrous than the first, although briefer and therefore
less costly. It is true that bytheterms of the Treaty of Turkmanchai, Abbas
Mirza could anticipate Russian assistance in hissuccession to thethrone, but
that hardly offset the immediate humiliation ofmilitary defeat. It isnot surpris
ing that, onhis return from Turkmanchai, the prime minister who had encour
aged the Vail cahd to go to war was replaced by the more prudent and
dependable Abd-Allah Khan Amin al-Daula. Thequestion nowwas what
could bedone to improve Abbas Mirza's prospects for a peaceful succession.
This preoccupation continued throughout the last phase of the reign, from 1828
to 1834, and goes far to explain the old Shah's insistence on bringing the
insubordinate administration in Fars to order.
After Turkmanchai Abbas Mirza's position was more precarious vis-a-vis his
fraternal rivals. Moreover, Fath AllShah's many grandchildren were now of
age, which meant that there would be additional contenders for the throne. Fath
All Shah had rarely been able to keep his sons in line. In this last phase of the
reign, hisreputation tarnished, as was the Vail cahd's, asa result of the recent
defeats, he was even more hard-pressed to maintain a semblance of dynastic
unity. Almost everywhere in the south, the south-west, andthe south-east,
unrest threatened.
In 1831, the Shah had toset out from Tehran, ashe had been forced todo in
1829 when hemarched on Shlraz. This time it was toreconcile one ofhis sons,
Muhammad Taqi Mirza Husam al-Saltana, thegovernor of Burujird, and his
grandson, Muhammad Husain Mirza Hishmat al-Daula, governor of
Kirmanshah. This accomplished, he travelled to Isfahan, again primarily to
investigate the affairs of Fars. Earlier that same year, Abbas Mirza had joined
the court from Tabriz and had been sent to quell the disturbances in Yazd and
Kirman. Henow came from Kirman to the Shah's camp near Isfahan and was
appointed beglerbegi ofKhurasan, although he continued toretain the office of

beglerbegi of Azarbaijan, which wasplaced in the charge of one of his younger
sons, Faridun Mirza.
The appointment of the Vail cahd to be beglerbegi of Khurasan was a
decision of great significance. Khurasan offered refractory chieftains to be
brought into line, Turkmen raiders to be punished, and laurels to bewon in
conquering Marv or Herat. Moreover, there had long lingered around the
person of the Vail cahd the suspicion that he wasnot agood Muslim. Itwas not
solely that he had twice been forced to make peace with the infidel Russians.In
Azarbaijan, he had acquired adangerous reputation for innovation, for acquir
ing Western novelties, and for hobnobbing with Frankish doctors, diplomats
and soldiers. In Mashhad, ashrine city, he could appear pious. He embarked on
his new charge with the vigour unexpected inone who had long been in poor
health.35 During the summer and autumn of 1832 hecampaigned vigorously
against rebellious chieftains in an arcstretching from Qiichan to Turbat-i
Haidarl, and staged a massacre of Tiirkmens at Sarakhs. Hevisited Tehran in the
summer of the following year, butwas soon back in Mashhad, having sent ahead
orders to his eldest son,Muhammad Mirza, to prepare for an expedition against
Herat, or perhaps Marv. As itwas, he died in Mashhad in October 1833 an<^w a s
buried in the shrine of Imam Riza. He was only forty-four.
Whatever expectations Abbas MIrza's death may have raised amongst his
erstwhile rivals, Fath cAli Shah proceeded with the succession policy prescribed
by hispredecessor. He nominated cAbbas MIrza's eldest son, Muhammad
Mirza, heir-apparent, granted him the title ofNa°ib al-Saltana, appointed him
beglerbegi of Azarbaijan and Khurasan, and at Nauruz 1834, summoned him to
Tehran from Mashhad, where hehad been with his late father, and formally
installed him as the newVail cahd. Muhammad Mirza then departed for Tabriz,
and the Shah set out for Isfahan in early autumn, on thelast journey of his reign.
He died in Isfahan in October 1834.
Among themembers of the Shah's entourage there wasanxiety that the news
of his death might be the signal for civil war, especially as he had died outside
the capital. Asatemporary expedient, therefore, hisbody was placed in a litter as
if he were still alive, and, accompanied by the royal harem and the household
servants, washurriedly taken to Qum, to be buried close to the shrine of Fatima,
sister of the Eighth Imam. Only then was the news of his death published.
Already, messengers had been despatched to Tabriz to warn Muhammad Mirza,
the Valrcahd. Despite these precautions, the reign of Muhammad Shah opened

FATH CALI SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
with rival contenders staking their claims to the throne. The new ruler,
supported by both the British and Russian envoys, hastened to Tehran and
celebrated hisformal accession in January 1835. Meanwhile, as had long been
expected, Husain CA1I MIrza Farman-farma in Shiraz arranged to have himself
proclaimed Shah. Shortly afterwards, he was joined by his younger brother,
Hasan All MIrza Shujac al-Saltana. However, as has already been related,
Manuchihr Khan Muctamad al-Daula was sent by Muhammad Shah to crush this
revolt, and he did so with such effectiveness and brutality that Fars, atleast, was
quickly secured. Both rebel princes were despatched to Tehran. HusainCA1I
MIrza died there three months later, supposedly ofthe plague. Hasan All MIrza
was blinded on arrival, but lived on as a captive until 1852—3.
Another son of Fath All Shah, All Shah Zill al-Sultan, the governor of
Tehran, also briefly aspired to the throne, but faced with the fait accompli of
Muhammad Shah's triumphal progress from Tabriz, heswiftly capitulated and
was granted the honour ofattending his nephew's coronation. Away from the
capital, and especially inthe south and south-west, news ofthe old Shah's death
provided a pretext for disorderly conduct, if not outright insurrection. In
Kirmanshah province, Muhammad AH MIrza's son, Muhammad Husain
MIrza, had ruled asbeglerbegl since 1821 (apart from aninterval between 1826
and 1829). The news that his grandfather was dead placed him inaquandary.He
himself seems tohave lacked either the capacity orthe ambition tomake abidfor
the throne but, in any case, heno longer possessed themilitary establishment
which had been his father's pride. He had also long since dissipated the good will
of those tribes with which his father had been on such excellent terms. Relatively
isolated in Kirmanshah, it was impossible forhim to estimate the comparative
strengths of the three contending parties. Hence, he sent off assurances of
loyalty to his cousin, Muhammad Shah, supposedly still in Tabriz, to All Shah
Zill al-Sultan in Tehran, andto Husain AllMIrza Farman-farma in Shiraz.36
Meanwhile, although the city ofKirmanshah remained quiet, allthe country in
the direction ofHamadan, and south asfarasShushtar, was ablaze, asthe Faill,
Lur and Bakhtiyarl tribes sought tomake the most ofwhat promised tobe a long
and troubled interregnum. Predictably, Muhammad Husain MIrza's attempts to
maintain good standing with all three parties failed miserably, andno sooner
was Muhammad Shah securely in control than he despatched his brother,
Bahram MIrza Mucizz al-Daula, to replace him. The new beglerbegl reached
Kirmanshah in January 1835. Muhammad Husain MIrza, who had taken

sanctuary in the house of the city pish-nama\ (leader of the congregational
prayers), wasseized and sent to Tehran. He ended his days as aprisoner in the
citadel ofArdabil, along with other members ofthe royal family considered
potential threats tothe new regime.37
Muhammad Shah ruled for fourteen years, andin most respects hisadminis
tration didnotconstitute a significant break with thestyle of government of the
previous reign, except in the important area of relations with theculama. As a
ruler, Muhammad Shah hasnotreceived much praise, least of all among British
writers who, outraged at hisattempts to re-integrate Herat into hiskingdom by
force, denounced him as a Russian pawn. The Russians certainly encouraged
him; they preferred Iranian attention to beturned eastwards. Butthefact is that
in hisattitude to the Herat question, Muhammad Shah was only pursuing what
had been the aim ofall his predecessors. It was indirect continuation of the
avowed intentions of his father, Abbas Mirza, that he first campaigned against
the Tiirkmens in thesummer of 1836 and then advanced against Herat late in the
following year.38 There followed a desultory siege ofseveral months, during
which he never really came close to dislodging YarMuhammad, the energetic
vazir of Kamran Shah Durrani. He was, however, exposed to intensely hostile
pressure from the British, and in the autumn of1838 he abandoned the siege.
Not that Herat was thereafter forgotten: theBritish imbroglio in Kabul during
the First Afghan War, their subsequent disinclination to getinvolved in Afghan
affairs, and the long years ofYar Muhammad's rule as sole master of Herat
(1842—51) provided opportunities for the pursuit ofintermittent but not un
friendly contacts between the Tehran and Herat durbars.
In Iran itself, affairs did notgo well: thesouthern provinces of the kingdom
were frequently in astate of semi-revolt, encouraged by the intrigues of those
members of the Qajar royal family who now lived in exile in Baghdad. Theyhad
a hand inthe 1838 rebellion ofAgha Khan Mahallati in Yazd and Kirman, which
eventually resulted in the relocation of the Ismacili leadership in Bombay. The
Baghdad exiles enjoyed aheightened importance because, for much ofthe reign,
relations between Iran and the Ottoman Empire were strained to breaking-point
on account of border disputes, notably over Muhammara on the Shatt al- Arab
estuary, andthetreatment of Shici pilgrims passing through Ottoman territory.
War nearly broke out on atleast two occasions: when the Pasha ofBaghdad
attacked Muhammara in 1838,during the months when the Iranians were
preoccupied with thesiege of Herat, and again in 1843, when Muhammad Najib

FATH A LI SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
Pasha's entry into Karbala, for the purpose of crushing the local lutis, who had
turned the city into a sanctuary for criminals, resulted ina general massacre of
the inhabitants.39 Both the British and Russian missions intervened to prevent
war between thetwo states, and their good offices ledto theopening of a
conference at Erzerum in 1843, at which all four governments were represented.
Its deliberations continued intermittently for nearly four years, but by June 1847
a treaty was concluded which, although farfrom satisfactory to either party,
brought a measure of peace to traditionally unstable frontier areas.
To what extent Muhammad Shah was infirm control of events throughout
his reign, andhowfar he followed his seemingly insouciant prime minister, Hajjl
Mirza Aghasi, awaits further research. The record does not convey the impres
sion ofa particularly strong orenergetic personality. The murder, early in the
reign, of his first prime minister, Mirza Abu3l-Qasim Qa°im-Maqam, provoked
unfavourable comment among foreign observers, as did the Shah's subsequent
dependence upon his second prime minister, Hajjl Mirza Aghasi, whorightly or
wrongly has remained one ofthe most consistently denigrated figures of the
Qajar period. Sofar as internal developments were concerned, probablythe
most dangerous aspect of the Shah's reliance on Hajjl Mirza Aghasi was the
latter's pronounced Sufi leanings. Muhammad Shah had been drawn to Sufism
at an early age,but under the steadily increasing influence of a murshid who was
also mentor and minister, the Shah became the willing sustainer ofSufis of all
sorts, and inconsequence neglected to maintain the traditional role of the ruler
as patron and benefactor of the Shici culama. Tohave a Sufi Shah was bad
enough; to have his spiritual master raised to be the Sadr-i Aczam wasworse; but
even more serious was the fact that the Shah's devotion toHajjl Mirza Aghasi
ensured that he would notseek thespiritual guidance of a Marja-i Taqlid
(Source of Precedent), for he regarded theHajjl as a sufficient guide. Thus,
throughout his reign, Muhammad Shah's relations with the leading representa
tives of the culama were strained as they never were in the time of Fathc All Shah.
It is from this reign that there first appeared among theculama that bitter hatred
of the Qajars and the conviction of the illegitimacy of their rule which would so
adversely prejudice popular opinion against them during the Tobacco Conces
sion crisis of1891—2, throughout the entire Constitutional period, and down to
the final demise of the dynasty.40
Muhammad Shah's less than cordial relations with the leading culama of his
time were due entirely to his Sufi proclivities and his dependence upon Hajjl

FATH CALI SHAH AND MUHAMMAD SHAH
Mirza AghasI, not to any encouragement of infidel innovations such as had
characterized his father, Abbas Mirza. Indeed, some caution needs to be
exercised in attributing to either Fath All Shah or Muhammad Shah personally
any conscious thrust in the direction of "westernization", although there were at
court individuals who were enthusiastic about foreign novelties. The most that
can be said with regard to these two reigns is that, as contacts with the agents of
foreign powers were becoming fairly frequent during the first fifty years of the
19th century, it was inevitable that some degree ofEuropean influence would
permeate a small circle of Iranians, mainly members of the royal family, courtiers
and senior officials. Fath All Shah's and Abbas Mirza's intentions in cultivat
ing or tolerating representatives of various European governments was primar
ily toease the tremendous pressure exerted onIran by the agents ofthe Tsar.
Mutatis mutandis; Muhammad Shah and Hajji Mirza AghasI, bitterly resentful of
British blustering and sufficiently shrewd totake Russian assurances of friend
ship cum grano sa/is, proved no less persistent in their attempts to escape
pulverization between these upper and nether millstones bytrying to extend
Iran's diplomatic contacts to other European governments, such asthose of
France, Austria, and even Spain.41
The one area in which neither Fath All Shah nor Muhammad Shah shied
away from working with foreign missions was that of military reform. After the
end of the first war with Russia in 1804—13, thoughtful Iranians understood the
necessity for confronting the Russians on their terms, and incidentally contribu
ting to improved internal policing, by raising new units, disciplined in the
European manner and equipped with the latest European weaponry. Abbas
Mirza's enthusiasm forhis Nizam-i Jadld has already been alluded to, but it
would be erroneous to suppose that hiswas a solitary voice crying in the
wilderness. Fath All Shah hadhis ownEuropean-officered battalions, in
addition tothose of the Vail cahd, although he was too lethargic to provide the
personal supervision which their training demanded. Even Muhammad All
Mirza, whom European observers described asa "throwback" to the ageof
Agha Muhammad Khan, understood the value of European training and
weapons, andmaintained a European-officered corps of regular infantry at
Kirmanshah, the equivalent of Abbas Mirza's Nizam-i Jadfd.
Because of the distance from Kirmanshah to Tehran, and also because of the
prince's secretiveness regarding his military establishment, his efforts in this
direction were much less known to European contemporaries than were the

well-publicized activities of cAbbas Mirza. A policy ofdeliberate obfuscation
may account for the admission by Fraser, usually so well-informed, that
"Mahomed Allee Meerza kept upat Kermanshah the most effective military
establishment in Persia; butof its extent or organization I am ignorant/'42
Another English traveller, J.S. Buckingham, who was inKirmanshah in 1816,
heard that the prince maintained a force ofone thousand regular infantry and
five hundred regular cavalry there, in addition to being able to call upon the
tribal levies of the province in an emergency. Healso heard that theprince had in
his service aRussian renegade, known as Yusuf Khan, whom he had appointed
as his Tupchi-Bashl (Commander of Artillery). The versatile Russian, in addition
to establishing apark of artillery and strengthening the city's fortifications, had
set up a foundry for casting brass cannon, and a factory for manufacturing
gunpowder.43 Buckingham's information was more or less confirmed by Sir
Robert KerPorter during a visit to Kirmanshah twoyears later. He testified that
there were troops there organized onthe European model, and spoke of two
French officers and anArmenian artificer in connection with artillery and an
arsenal.44 Another example ofa prominent figure seeking to apply European
methods to thetraining of his troops wastheVail of Ardalan, Aman-Allah Khan
(c. 1800-24), as an English visitor to Sanandaj in 1820recorded in his journal.45
This was,no doubt, the application of western technology upon avery small
scale, but ithad acumulative effect. Thus, writing of the year 1832, theauthor of
the Farsnama-yi Nasirl noted that an Englishman, the former instructor of a
detachment ofQaraguzlu tribesmen, and an Iranian who had formerly beenin
the service of cAbbas Mirza, had both been admitted to theservice ofthe
beglerbegl of Fars, Husain AIT Mirza Farman-farma, and been given unusually

Rich waspresumably referring to Yusuf Khan when he wrote: "Lately a manin Kermanshah, whopractises founding, casting and coining, has greatly contributed to the destruction of the plane forests, fancying that nothing but charcoal made of tchinar [chenar] would answer his purpose"; Narrative 1, p. 106. 44 Porter, n, p. 181. See Jaubert, p. 280, and Keppel, 1, p. 3 20. The two French officers mentioned by Porter may have been de Veaux (or de Vaux) and Court, whom Keppel encountered in Kirmanshah in 1821. Keppel also found twoItalian soldiers of fortune and a soi-disant Spaniard, "Senor Oms" there. He was told that at one time, Muhammad CA1T Mirza, for whom these mercenaries expressed warm praise for his intrepid spirit on thebattlefield, had employed seven or eight European officers inhis service. Keppel, 11, pp. 14-21. To de Veaux, apparently, was attributed the success ofthe prince's advance against Baghdad in 1821: Flandin and Coste, 11, p. 5 20. Following the death ofMuhammad All Mirza, several ofthese European officers indue course made their way to northern India, where they entered the service ofRanjit Singh, the Sikh ruler ofthe Panjab. There, the mysterious "Senor Oms" metwith a premature death, but both Claude August Court (17931861) and Paolo di Avitabile (1791-1850) carved out brilliant careers for themselves in the Sikh service.

high salaries. A year or two later, there was even stranger news to report: the
vazlr ofFars, Mirza Hasan Nizam al-cUlama, had persuaded Husain A.1I Mirza
to recruit three battalions of regular troops and have them trained inthe
European style bya certain Englishman, John Walter. As with Abbas Mirza's
regulars in Tabriz, Husain AIT Mirza's troops were to parade daily on the
maidan-i tupkhanain Shiraz, each battalion consisting of 800 men. One battalion
consisted of men from Shiraz, under the command of the beglerbegl's son,
Nadir Mirza. Another wasformed from Qashqa°I, Baharlu, Nafar and Arab
tribesmen, under thecommand of Jahangir Khan, thesonof the Qashqa°III
Khan. Thethird wasrecruited from the districts of Shiraz, Sarvistan, Fasa,
Darab and Istahbanat, and was commanded by Mirza Abd-Allah Khan, a
kinsman of the author of the Farsnama-yi Nasirz.46
Symptomatic ofthe same preoccupation with European military techniques
was the desire expressed to a passing Englishman by Muhammad Shah's
brother, Bahram Mirza Mucizz al-Daula, the short-lived beglerbegi of
Kirmanshah, that British officers might be stationed in thecity, to be able to
train his troops inthe style ofthe Nizam-i Jadld.47 It was apparently in response
to this expressed wish ofa governor ofa strategically important region, that the
young Henry Rawlinson was sent toKirmanshah inApril 1835 atthe requestof
the Shah, to act "asa sort of military adviser andassistant" to his brother.48
Thus, theearliest concern shown by Iranians for increased knowledge of the
West related specifically towarfare and technology, and while itmay be true that
it is a relatively short step from wanting guns and bayonets to assimilatingthe
more seductive aspects of an alien civilization, forQajar Iran atleast, that still lay
in the future. Throughout the lifetimes ofboth Fath All Shah and Muhammad
Shah, Iran was still, in almost every respect, a medieval Muslim society largely
self-sufficient in most of its material needs as well as in its cultural identity.

CHAPTER 5
IRAN UNDER THE LATER QAjARS, 1848-1922
THE QAJAR POLITICAL SYSTEM
Before discussing the vicissitudes oflate Qajar politics, itwould be useful to try
to understand how 19thcentury Iranian politics worked. Essentially these
workings were only a slight variation onthe general pattern of Iranian politics
since the n t h century, when large-scale invasions ofnomadic Turkish tribes
that accompanied the Saljuq incursions, and the spread of the quasi-feudal iqta
system strengthened the regional power oftribal and other military leaders and
weakened the strength of central governments. Although there were, between
the 1 ithand 19th centuries, governments of very varied powers, ranging from
the strongest ofthe Saljuq, Mongol andSafavid rulers toperiods ofcomplete
breakdown ofcentral government, there were certain similarities that character
ize the whole of this period. Among these wasthestatus of the numerous
nomadic tribes, which ranged from almost total independence to a degreeof
internal autonomy. Tribes managed notonly their own internal affairs, subject
generally totribute and pro-forma confirmation of tribal leaders bytherulers,
but also frequently ruled over villagers who inhabited territories in their
regions. Beyond this internal autonomy, the tribes constituted the most effective
fighting forces in Iran during most of this long period — their mastery of
horsemanship and ofthe latest weapons giving them adecisive advantage over
the city population, whom the Shahs generally showed little inclination to train.
Every important Iranian dynasty from the Saljuqs tothe Qajars was either tribal
in origin orrelied ontribal backing intaking power. In the early 19th century,
nomadic tribes were estimated to form onethird to one half of the Iranian
population.1 Atthe end ofthe century estimates were generally one quarter, but
since the Iranian population was supposed tohave doubled inthe interim, from
about five million toabout tenmillion persons, theabsolute number oftribes
people probably remained stationary. Theimpact of this large, semi-autono
mous, and influential tribal grouping on Iranian life and politics has not yet been
given the theoretical consideration it deserves.

THE QAJAR POLITICAL SYSTEM
If tribal leaders, who could call on well armed and generally devoted
followers, made up a major element of the Iranian ruling group, there were also
other key, often overlapping, elements. In Qajar times the strongest was the
court element, headed by the Shah himself, including legions of royal relatives,
among whom the Queen Mother and favourite wife orwives might be very
influential. Qajars were often named governors of provinces although they were
not exempt from having to purchase these offices. The central and regional
treasurers, or mustaufis,tended to be hereditary, using a code and techniques that
only they could understand. Otherwise, nearly all offices inthe rudimentary
central and regional bureaucracy were to some degree bought, and in Qajar
times there developed an almost annual auction, with governorships going to
the man who offered the most for them, and the governor in turn selling local
tax-collecting and other positions.2 This system, as inmany societies, had the
advantage ofgiving tothe Shah orgovernor a fixed amount ofready cashin
advance, but had the far greater disadvantage, from the viewpoint of production
and prosperity, of encouraging officials toraise as much as they could in taxes
since they could not be certain that they could hold their post against a higher
bidder the following year. There were exceptions to the yearly bidding, such as
the governor-generalship ofAzarbaijan, which the Qajars gave tothe Crown
Prince, with real rule often in the hands of a minister. The use of taxes to extort as
much as posible from the peasant majority was not significantly abated in such
areas, however.
One notable feature of the central bureaucracy was the possibility ofrising
from humble origins within theroyal household to high positions. Prime
examples are Nasir al-DIn Shah's reforming prime minister, Mirza Taqi Khan,
the Amir-i Kabir, and the long-lived later prime minister, Mirza All Asghar
Khan Amin al-Sultan. The father of the first was a steward in the royal
household; the father of the latter a butler of Georgian origin who rose to
become the Shah's most influential confidant.
If aristocratic blood, in the Western sense, had little meaning in Iran, where
titles were usually purchased and were not automatically passed on from father
to son, landholding was ofmajor importance in conferring status aswellas
power. Both the tribal leadership and those in government service tried to get
their hands on large amounts of land, and might purchase tax-farming rights for
their own lands, which meant that the relatively small body of government
officials might never enter their territories. Although no reliable statistics are

available, it seems that most land throughout Qajar times was owned bymen
who did not work their lands themselves but received rents, mostly in kind,
from sharecropping peasants. As the century advanced, more and more mer
chants purchased land and they, along with some traditional landlords, beganto
use their lands increasingly for export crops like cotton and opium.3 Although
estates tended tobe broken down through the operation of Islamic inheritance
laws, which called for the giving of defined shares to varied family members, and
through confiscation bythe central government, lands could bekept together
for the whole family through the creation of a family vaqf or mortmain, and
sometimes through evasion ofIslamic laws. Rich and propertied officials who
incurred thedispleasure of the Shah might have their property confiscated.
Even officials close to the court often had their properties confiscated after their
death. Qajar Iran thus provides arguments to suggest extreme upwardand
downward mobility for afew atthe centres of wealth and power, but most were
far less mobile, enjoying either continuity of wealth and public office, or, in most
cases, poverty and powerlessness. Wealthy merchant families sometimes moved
into landholding and even governmental circles.
Government bureaucracy and functions were limited throughout the Qajar
period, although they tended to increase in the latter part ofthat period. The
chief function of the bureaucracy was to collect taxes and customs duties, and the
chief use made of monies collected was to support the collectors and the
provincial and central courts — especially the Shah and his entourage. Public
works, such as the building and repair ofroads and caravansarais (as had been
carried out by some Safavid and other rulers) were not given priority, especially
during the late Qajar period. Institutions considered tobe the responsibilityof
government in themodern West, such as schools, hospitals, andmostlaw
courts, were mainly left tothose with religious training, supported by income
from religious gifts and taxes.
Strikingly little attention was given by the Qajar Shahs tothe creation of a
modern military force which might protect them from both external attack and
internal revolt. Recognition of the need for amodern army for self-preservation
had launched the modernization programmes of Muhammad CA1Iin Egypt and
of Selim III and Mahmud II inthe Ottoman Empire inthe early 19th century.
Their newmilitary forces required translation bureaux, sending students

abroad, building modern schools athome, and beginning factories tomeet the
needs of the armed forces. In Iran, however, after the death of Crown Prince
cAbbas Mirza in 1833, there were only sporadic attempts to bring in Western
military instructors from various countries to train sections of the armed forces,
and only the Russian-officered Cossack Brigade, later inthe century, became a
serious and disciplined force, though a small one. Otherwise the Iranian army
was noted for its almost total disorganization, andfor the sale of office to
incompetents who appropriated their men's salaries and in return allowedthe
men to make aliving by whatever trade they could, and neglected their drill and
training. Apart from theCossack Brigade, thegovernment mainly relied on
tribal forces that were not part of the regular army and which were mobilized by
the promise of freedom to loot and plunder.
Several explanations canbe suggested for the Qajars' lack of success in
building an effective military force. Iran was notin contact with the West as
early and intensively as were Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, and forces
opposing centralization were also stronger within Iran. Tribal leaders, the
ulama and vested interests at court effectively blocked reformist measures for
different reasons. Moreover, Nasir al-DIn Shah did not feel it necessary to take
such measures very seriously and preferred to rely on limited military forces
along with a vague British guarantee of Iran's territorial integrity (which he
tried unsuccessfully to strengthen).
Lacking astrong army or national police, and lacking roads and railways with
which to reach the provinces, thecentral government hadtherefore to use
largely indirect methods of rule, such as dividing opposing forces, offering
bribes inthe form ofpensions, and holding hostages inthe capital for the good
behaviour of powerful families and tribes.
In addition to these groups, opposition to the Throne was sometimes
forthcoming from the Shici culama, who are described inmore detail elsewhere
(see Chapter 19). Many Imami (Twelver) Shicis regard temporal rulers as, to
some degree, illegitimate — with legitimate power belonging to the Hidden
Imam. With Shictsm there gradually grew up the theory that the mujtahidswere
the most qualified interpreters of the will of the Hidden Imam in many legal and
social matters. Hence, if a mujtahid, andparticularly the leading mujtahid,
should speak out against the practice of a temporal ruler, it was the mujtahid
who should be obeyed. InSafavid times this potential conflict remained muted,
partly because theSafavids claimed to bedescended from an Imam, and also
because they maintained considerable control and influence over the religious
establishment — but even inlate Safavid times there were mujtahids who spoke
177

IRAN UNDER THE LATER QAJARS, 1848-1922
out against therule of wine-drinking, impious Shahs, andclaimed that the
mujtahids themselves had greater right to rule.4
During the eighteenth century, the centre ofShici leadership shifted outside
Iran to the Shicl shrine cities of Ottoman Iraq, where itcould be free of the Shahs'
influence and intimidation. There was enough income at the shrines through
endowments and donations tosupport a large community ofreligious leaders,
scholars and students, independent of the Iranian government. Even within
Iran, as direct recipients ofthe Islamic khums and lakat tax and of considerable
income from pious endowments (vaqfs) as well as other income for services
rendered, the ShIcI culama had considerable independent wealth. Naturally, this
wealth was very unequally distributed, and there were poor, middling and rich
mullas, some of whom carried ontrades or owned much land to supplement
their income from their other functions. As acorporate group, the culama were
well funded, andthis wealth forwarded their power andindependence. In
addition to their own sources ofincome, they were frequently given incomes
and pensions by the government. Many of the culama had close ties with bazaar
merchants and artisans. In addition, luth (urban toughs) as well as religious
students often acted as their private armies.
Many of the functions that modern states would consider governmental were
carried out in Qajar Iran, as inmost traditional Muslim societies, by the culama.
Such functions included most educational, judicial and legal work and such
social and charitable services as existed. Aside from the technical school, orDar
al-Funun, ofTehran, founded by Mirza TaqI Khan Amir-i Kablr in 1851 under
government auspices, there were other forms of secular education conducted by
scribes and tutors, inwhich the government played no part indetermining the
curriculum or structure. The curriculum in religious schools was strictly
traditional and Islamic. It concentrated atthe lower levels on reading, writing,
and the memorization ofthe QurDan by rote, and, higher levels, onArabic and
the traditional Islamic sciences. Only near the end of the Qajar period were there
a fewnew initiatives, largely private, to create modern schools, sometimes
influenced by earlier, foreign-inspired Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian
schools.
The administration of justice was divided between Islamic sharfa courts, run
by the culama, and the courts ofcurf 01 "customary law", presided over by the
Shah, the governors, and their representatives. Some tribal groups had their

own customary law. Ingeneral, the sharica courts dealt with family and personal
status law, with wills, contracts, and other legal documents, and with breaches
of Islamic law, while magistrates' courts concentrated on criminal cases and
rebels against the state. In the case of commercial litigation, the parties involved
might choose between secular mediators or religious authorities. Throughout
the Qajar period there was a tendency for the government to extend the power of
its courts and legal prerogatives, which was generally resisted bythe culama.
Entry into the culama corps, gained through study, was often anavenueof
upward social mobility, and entailed more respect than did entry into the Qajar
bureaucracy. Mosques and shrines as well as houses of mujtahids, foreign
missions and foreign-owned telegraph offices were chief areas of bast or refuge
from thegovernment.5 Although some of the culama, especially the govern
ment-appointed imamjunta's ofthe cities, tended to side with the government,
and others might hoard, cheat, extort, or take bribes, in general they were
thought to dothis less than government officials. Thus, they were sometimes
appealed to with success to represent popular grievances against the govern
ment. Several times inthe Qajar period, and most notably inthe protest against
the British tobacco concession and inthe Constitutional Revolution, an impor
tant sector of the culama became indentified with, and some even led, popular
movements against the government and against the encroachments of foreign
imperialist policies.
In addition to the indigenous and traditional powerholding classes discussed
above — the bureaucracy, court, and royal family; the tribal leaders; the
landholders; and the culama — the Qajar period witnessed the growing power of
a new, non-indigenous group who profoundly affected Iranian history: the
foreigners. Although foreign nationals did not overrun Iran tothe same extent
as they did Egypt, the Levant, or Turkey, Iran was nearly asmuch affected as
they were by thepolicies of foreign governments and of a small number of
foreign businessmen. Beginning with the strategic involvement of France,
Great Britain and Russia with Iran during the Napoleonic Wars, Iran came to be
affected particularly bythe policies ofGreat Britain and Russia. In addition to
their economic interest inIranian trade, and later inconcessions, Great Britain
and Russia had strong political and strategic interests in Iran. The former was
concerned to keep control ofthe Persian Gulf, to keep other powers out of it,
and to safeguard southern and eastern Iran for the defence of India. Russia, after

taking some Transcaucasian territory from Iran in twowars in the early
nineteenth century, wished to make northern Iran an area of overwhelming
Russian influence, and tried, as did Britain, tobe the paramount influence over
the Iranian government. There were some in Russia who hoped to gain more
territory and anoutlet to a warm water port onthe Persian Gulf, but neither
Power was willing toallow the other extensive territorial gains orthe achieve
ment of protectorate status over Iran, let alone the conquest of the whole
country. Itwas this strong mutual desire to stop total control by the other party
more than any other factor that was responsible formaintaining Iran's inde
pendence. This independence was often purely formal since Iran would not
venture to take a step that seriously offended either of the two parties (as the
Reuter concession of 1872 offended Russia) unless it believed it had strong
support from the other party (and the British did not support Iran in the Reuter
affair); even such support was insufficient in many cases, if the other were
sufficiently threatening and displeased. The diplomatic files of the Qajar period
are filled with discussions by Iran's chief ministers and the Shah with British and
Russian representatives, trying to secure their approval of policies that in atruly
independent state would be amatter of internal decision. While itis easy for one
who reads chiefly British sources to get the impression that British intentionsin
Iran were reformist andbenevolent, a fuller acquaintance with Persianand
Russian sources does not bear out this interpretation. On the whole the British
desired those reforms that would facilitate trade and the security of foreigners
and those connected with them in Iran. When really reforming nationalists
appeared, as in thecase of the Democratic Party during the Constitutional
Revolution, who might have limited the privileges of foreigners in Iran,the
British opposed them.
European governments tended to favour, and even aggressively to promote,
the trading and commercial interest of their own nationals. Again the difference
between Great Britain and Russia in this respect is not asgreat asit is often
presented. It is true that the Russian government offered direct subsidies and
rebates toencourage exports toIran, asto other countries, and also promoted
banking and railway schemes, among others, in part asa means of spreading
Russian political influence. TheBritish, however, also considered railway
schemes mainly from astrategic viewpoint, ultimately deciding to oppose them,
as did the Russians, on the same grounds. The British government also playeda
considerable role in encouraging or discouraging investment in particular
schemes; discouraging the Reuter concession, but then using Reuter's claim to
fight Russia's quest for a railway concession, and encouraging Reuter's final

compensation in 1889 with the concession for the Imperial Bank of Persia and its
attached mineral rights. During his mission to Iran in 1888—90, in particular, Sir
Henry Drummond Wolff pushed for a variety of British economic schemes and
concessions, such as the opening of the Karun river to navigation (the Lynch
Brothers who navigated it gota government subsidy), and the disastrous
Tobacco Concession of1890. The D'Arcy Oil Concession of 1901 was similarly
negotiated with help from the British legation.6
Given the favoured position ofWestern traders, who, unlike the Persians,
did not have to pay internal customs, the impossibility of protecting infant
industries or handicrafts due to the enforced low customs duties, and the lack of
any serious government policy to help businessmen, Iran became economically
heavily dependent onthe West. When to this are added Iran's political and
military weakness and dependence on Western advice and approval, and the role
of the Russians and British in protecting the unpopular Qajar dynasty against
revolt orrebellion, it seems legitimate tocall Iran a semicolony inwhich the
independence of both people and government was strictly limited. Thus to
discuss Iranian politics as distinct from Iran's foreign relations istoimplyan
artificial separation between them. It must be borne inmind that the internal
politics discussed below were to aconsiderable degree controlled not only from
behind the scenes, as they are in many countries, but even from beyond Iran's
borders.
THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE LATER QAJAR PERIOD
The middle decades of the 19th century brought promises of change for many
Iranians. First came the Babi messianic movement and revolts which originated
in 1844 with Sayyid All Muhammad, knowrn as the Bab, a young merchant from
Shiraz who, through reinterpretation of Traditions concerning the Hidden
Imam, proclaimed the coming of a "new age" and the Imam's return. The Bab's
radical message attracted enthusiasts from all the urban social classes. Defying
the very bases of the religious and political order of their time, the Babis were
bound tocome into open confrontation with those ulama who were inclose
alliance with the state. The resistance ofthe Babis brought them considerable
success, but the movement was eventually suppressed and its members perse
cuted. The Bab was executed in 1850 and a turning point was reached in 1852
when a few of his followers tried to assassinate Nasir al-DIn Shah. There

followed the brutal torture and execution ofmany Babis including the remark
able woman leader and poet Qurrat al-cAin.7 After this, many Babis left Iran and
took refuge inBaghdad. The Bab had assigned the leadership of the community
to Subh-i Azal, but in the 1860s the latter's half-brother, Baha-Allah, proclaimed
himself to be "He whom God shall make manifest" as promised by the Bab, and
claimed to be a new prophet with a new message. This message, whichwas
humanist and pacifist, discouraged the continuation ofmilitancy. His followers,
known as Baha°Is, advocated moderate social andpolitical reform and later
found considerable success within andoutside Iran.8 A militant minority of
Babis who opposed changes proposed by Baha°-Allah gave allegiance to Subh-i
Azal. Several Azali Babis, as the latter group wasknown, became active in
opposition movements such as the Constitutional Revolution, discussed below. The other promising yet short-lived development, which coincided in time
with the Babi movements, was the reform programme introduced by Mirza Taqi
Khan Amlr-i Kablr (1848—5 2). His execution in the Bagh-i Fin near Kashan in
185 2 on the Shah's orders, ended the promise of social and political change.9 The
vested interests of these who influenced the young Shah against his ex-prime
minister wanted to preclude himfrom ever getting power again, and they
effectively did so.Even in those intervals when the Shah decided he wanted
reform, hewas never able tofind aminister equally capable. With the dismissal
and death ofAmir-i Kabir nearly all his reforms fell into abeyance; courtiers and
ulama regained their former pensions and privileges, and ofhis initiatives only
the Tehran technical and military school, the Dar al-Funun, remained. With the
help ofEuropean teachers it continued to train students from the upper classes
in fields of medicine, engineering, military sciences, music and foreign lan
guages andlater (in the 1930s) served as one of the foundations for modern
higher education in Iran.
The Amir-i Kabir's successor as chief minister, Mirza Agha Khan Nuri, was
reactionary and corrupt, and helped reverse the progress of reform. The only
notable events ofhis rule were a quarrel with the British legation over a trivial

and apparently trumped-up charge, culminating in a temporary break of rela
tions, followed by the Persian siege of Herat and the Anglo-Persian War of
185 6-7. The Treaty ofParis of 185 7, which terminated the war, made Iran give
up all claims to Herat andAfghan territory, butthere remained Iranianswho
hoped to move again into western Afghan territories, which had historically
constituted part of Iran.
After Nasir al-DIn Shah dismissed Mirza Agha Khan Nuri in 1858, strongly
criticizing hislaxconduct of office, the Shah decided, in view of his problems
with his first two chief ministers, totryto rule without a chief minister. Instead,
he divided the government among six ministers; Justice, Finance, War, Foreign
Affairs, Pensions and Auqaf (religious endowments), and the Interior. Each
minister was to report personally tothe Shah, who alone had the power to issue
or approve orders. At the same time, the Shah reinstated an old practice of
holding a personal weekly court to hear petitions from the people.
This system proved unsuccessful. The quarrels and attempts at mutual
sabotage among theministers continued, andthose outside theprivileged six
wanted entry into the circle of power. In 1859, t n e Shah established a wider
consultative body, including princes, notables, clerks, culama, and officials. He
also proposed similar consultative bodies forthe provinces, but not many were
created, andneither the central northeprovincial bodies seem to have func
tioned forlong. Later, the Shah setupa smaller central advisory board, but that
too was short-lived. For atime the Shah tried todivide all authority among three
ministers, butthis toowas abortive. There arereports of the Shah's disgust at
the failure of government to work efficiently and smoothly, and particularly of
his dismay at theterrible condition of the armed forces and the army accounts.
Although the Shah had access to whatever accounts existed, he lacked the
technical knowledge to understand the accounts presented to himand what
might be done to improve the collection andallocation of revenue.
One new development that helped the Shahs maintain and extend the power
of the central government in the provinces wasthe construction of the first
telegraph lines inIran, which began in 185 8-9. Since the Indian Mutiny of 185 7,
the British felt theneed for telegraphic communication with India, andone of
the means they sought toaccomplish this was aconcession foraline which, after
transversing Europe andtheOttoman Empire, would go through Iran to the
Persian Gulf and thence by cable to India. The first telegraph concessionwas
granted in 1862 andthe single line built soon after; further foreign andlocal
construction resulted in a fairly complete telegraph network linking the major
cities tothe capital. The Shah could now know immediately what was occurring

in the provinces, and issue orders regarding rebellion orsedition. On the other
hand, the opposition found the telegraph a useful tool in co-ordinating their
movements in 1891-2 and again in 1905-11.
It may have been frustration at the failure of his central administration to
accomplish anything useful between 1851 and 1870 that led Nasir al-DIn Shahto
reconsider the possibility of appointing areforming government under a strong
minister. The right man - in many ways the successor to Amlr-i Kablr - was
MIrza Husain Khan, son of a high-ranking bureaucrat and grandson of a barber
who had entered the service ofa Qajar prince.10 After a successful career in the
Iranian foreign service, beginning in India and later serving in Tiflis, MIrza
Husain Khan was made ambassador to Istanbul during the great Ottoman
reform period after 1856. Already predisposed toreform and modernization by
his experience in India and Russia, MIrza Husain Khan became aneven more
eager partisan ofreform as a result ofwhat he saw inthe Ottoman Empire. He
seems also to have been influenced by at least two identifiable reformist thinkers
- Fath CA1I Akhundzada, whom hegot to know well in Tiflis, and the Iranian
Armenian, Malkum Khan, whom hemet in Istanbul.
Malkum Khan, for all the dubious elements in his life history, was one of the
main advocates of reform in 19th-century Iran.11 Born of an Armenian father
who had, at least nominally, converted to Islam, he received his higher edu
cation inParis. Returning toIran soon after the founding ofthe Dar al-Funun,
he entered service there as a translator and teacher. Hewas responsible for
setting up the first telegraph line in Iran, from the Dar al-Funun to the palace. He
soon set about founding the first secret society of a Masonic type, though
without any official connection with world Free Masonry. This was known as
the Faramushkhana or"House of Forgetfulness", aterm referring tothe secret
nature of this society.12 The members were mostly of high rank and the Shah was
kept informed, soit seems unlikely that anything really seditious was said or
done. Malkum Khan, however, had areputation as aman of advanced ideas, and
had even written privately circulated treatises recommending governmental
reforms, sothat it was probably not hard forinterested parties to arousethe
Shah's suspicions. In 1861 the Shah issued adecree closing the Faramushkhana,

and he exiled Malkum, who went to the Ottoman Empire. In Istanbul Malkum
was in close contact with Mirza Husain Khan, and some of the latter's ideas on
restructuring government resemble those set forth by Malkum in his treatises.
Mirza Husain Khan was eager to have the Shah travel abroad in order to see
the advantages of progress, and the Shah himself was not averse to the idea of
such travel, provided he could be sure that those he left behind would remain
loyal. Possibly to be politic in his choice of destination for his first foreign trip,
rather than from religious devotion, Nasir al-DIn Shah decided to visit, in 1870,
the Shici holy cities ofIraq. This happened to bea fortunate choice forthe
reformist goals of Mirza Husain Khan, since the governor of Baghdad province
was the famous and effective reformer, Mihdat Pasha, who had greatly im
proved the province during his tenure. Atthe Shah's request, Mirza Husain
Khan accompanied him from near the Ottoman border throughout his tripin
Ottoman Iraq, and this gave Mirza Husain Khan ample opportunity to point out
the benefits of reform. The Shah was so impressed with his ambassador that he
insisted on his company directly back toTehran, and did not even give Mirza
Husain a chance to return toIstanbul to settle his affairs.13
Even before their return to Tehran in February 1871, the Shah made Mirza
Husain Khan Minister of Justice and also Minister of Pensions and Auqaf. He
succeeded in putting some rational organization into these ministries, thus
alienating some of the culama, on whose privileges he encroached. Later in that
year he was made Minister ofWar, and succeeded inmaking some dramatic
improvements in methods of drill and accounting, although he could not bring
about the thorough reform the army needed. Finally, inNovember 1871, the
Shah, having tried unsuccessfully torule without a chief minister since 1858,
appointed Mirza Husain Khan tothis position {Sadr-i A'^am) and announced
his support for a programme of reform to overcome the prevalent disorder.
Under Mirza Husain Khan's inspiration the Shah issued orders regularizing the
cabinet, whose members were to be named by the chief minister with the Shah's
approval. The cabinet was tomeet regularly each week, and all the ministers
were responsible to the chief minister, who had to approve the membership of
each ministry. Each ministry was to have a regular location — abig change ina
country where a ministry might be coterminous with the location of the minister
at any given time. The chief minister infact decided many affairs on his own,
getting only formal approval from the Shah. While he was chief minister, Mirza
Husain Khan remained Minister ofWar and Commander inChief, and con

tinued totry tointroduce better order into the armed forces. He made serious
efforts to create a rational administration and end corruption in government
offices, but he does not seem tohave had the political sense totry tobuild up a
party of supporters within Iran, so that, possibly because of his autocratic ways,
he alienated even reform-minded court figures like the future Amin al-Daula.
Malkum Khan was invited briefly back toIran in 1872, possibly tohelp in the
reform programme, but his brief presence before going abroad again had little
real effect. Having spent most ofhis life abroad and as a relatively free agentin
the Foreign Service, Mlrza Husain Khan may have lacked the skills of political
manoeuvring that were essential to operating successfully in Iranian conditions.
Even with such skills it would have been extremely difficult to cutintothe
corruption, incompetence, overstating, and vested interests that characterized
the traditional ways ofdoing things, without the decisive backing ofa firmer
ruler than Nasir al-DIn Shah. •
The genuine good will toward thecommon people possessed by Mlrza
Husain Khan was shown during theterrible famine of 1870—1, when it is
estimated that asmuch asone tenth ofIran's population might have died. In
addition totaking whatever steps he could tohalt the practice ofhoarding and
speculation bythe rich, including members ofthe court and some culama,he
threw open hisown grain stores and tried to persuade thegovernment to
subsidize his lower-priced bread. This famine was primarily the result of a series
of dry years and bad harvests and conversion ofgrain land toopium or cotton
production for export, as well as of the export of foods for higher prices abroad.
Iran was left more vulnerable than before to famine in bad years.14
In many ways Mlrza Husain Khan's prime ministry, only some of the
achievements ofwhich are noted above, repeated the experience ofthe Amlr-i
Kabir. Inboth cases a reformist chief minister, influenced by what he knewof
Russia and the Ottoman Empire, tried to institute reforms of a strictly "self
strengthening" or "reform from above" variety, which would rationalize the
centre, encourage economic progress, and strengthen the Shah's government
and armed forces. In the course of doing so he antagonized courtiers and culama
without building up a large body of partisans, and he failed to get reliable
backing from the Shah. The opposition ultimately succeeded in bringing about
his dismissal.
There was, however, one major difference between the two. Whereasthe
Amir-i Kabir had understood the importance forIran's independent develop

POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE LATER QAJARS
ment of cutting down dependency on, and ties to, both Great Britain and Russia,
and acted accordingly, Mirza Husain Khan, even before he became chief
minister, believed that it was important to enlist Great Britain asheavily as
possible in Iran's protection and development. Without necessarily endorsing
his position, itis important to understand how he came to hold it. In the 1860s
Russia had swept across Central Asia until ithad bordered Iran to the northeast
as well asto the northwest. It was not clear if Russia had further territorial
designs onIran. Mirza Husain Khan, like many other Iranian leaders, tried
fruitlessly to get a clear guarantee of Iran's territorial integrity and independence
from Britain. Also, in viewing Iran's undeveloped economy, Mirza Husain
Khan was attracted by the idea of trying to raise British capital forrailway
construction and other economic projects, since he regarded Russian capital as
dangerous and other countries were less interested in such investments. Mirza
Husain Khan thus encouraged the grandiose concession negotiated between the
Iranian minister inLondon and Baron Julius de Reuter, a naturalized British
subject of news agency fame. Both during negotiations and in later attemptsto
get work started, Reuter gave bribes to high officials, including Malkum Khan,
but there is no evidence that Mirza Husain Khan took a bribe. Hewas,
nevertheless, astrong partisan of the concession and helped persuade the Shah
to sign it in 1872.
The sweeping Reuter Concession, which even an imperialist like Curzon later
characterized as the most complete grant ever made of control over its resources
by any country to aforeigner,15 is indeed without historical parallel. Although
the key point both for Reuter and the Iranians was the grant of the right to build
a railway from the Caspian ports southward, the Concession also included total
rights for all factories, minerals (except those then being exploited), irrigation
works, agricultural improvements, new forms oftransport, and virtually any
form of modernized enterprise that might be undertaken in Iran. While it is true
that no resource was ceded that was currently being exploited by Iranians, the
foreclosure of future Iranian exploitation, as well as the concentration ofsuch
potential economic control over the country in the hands of one foreigner,
constituted a serious threat to Iran's economic and political independence.
Mirza Husain Khan's belief that Iran's independence and economic develop
ment would best be forwarded by the unification of all schemes under the aegis
of a British subject was sincere, but naive in terms of the realities of international
political and economic life.

IRAN UNDER THE LATER QAJARS, I548-I922
In 1872 Reuter sent a representative toIran tofinish the negotiations, and
began to press forthe help and permits needed to start railway construction.
According tothe Concession, Reuter had toput up £40,000 incaution money,
and this would be forfeited ifrailway construction were not started by a given
date. Throughout 1872 the Iranians procrastinated — partly because of high level
opposition to the Concession, partly because Malkum Khan and others wanted
further bribes, and partly because railway rights had previously been granted to
another party and did not expire until the end of 1872. Even in 1873, however,
Iranian obstacles to Reuter's beginning construction were not removed,but
rather increased as Iranian opposition to the project grew, and was joined by that
of the Russians.
Nasir al-DIn Shah had apparently been toying for several years with the idea
of a trip toEurope. No previous Qajar monarch had travelled outside Iranian
territory, and the success ofhis trip toOttoman Iraq may have encouraged the
Shah tobelieve that he could safely and beneficially travel further afield. Mlrza
Husain Khan strongly encouraged the idea ofsuch a trip, ashefelt that if the
Shah saw Europe's progress at first hand he would become a firmer promoter of
progressive measures at home. Leaving the affairs of Iran in the hands of picked
royal relatives and courtiers, the Shah embarked onhis trip abroad in 1873
accompanied by various ministers, courtiers and women of the harem, including
his favourite wife, Anis al-Daula. The Shah's desire to travel with women
created considerable problems, since the royal wives were, when in Iran,
guarded notonly bythe all-enveloping costume worn by upper-class urban
women, but by guards who forced persons on the street tomove back orlook
away when they passed. No such treatment was possible abroad, and embarrass
ment was created when Russian officials tried to greet or otherwise deal with
these women, while their heavily-covered figures occasioned stares and unwel
come approaches. On ministerial advice, the Shah decided tosend the women
home from Russia, and although Mlrza Husain Khan maintained that hehad
given no advice about this, Anis al-Daula blamed him and became one ofhis
most bitter and influential opponents. Onher return, her palace becamethe
centre of high level opposition to Mirza Husain Khan — opposition that included
both corrupt or reactionary elements whose vested interests were hurt by Mlrza
Husain Khan's reforms and patriots whose opposition had been aroused by the
Reuter Concession, as well as some with mixed motives. Many culama feared the
railway and the influx offoreigners that threatened tofollow from the Reuter
Concession. A false text of the Concession was circulated which said that
Reuter's railway would pass through the shrine ofShahzada Abd al-cAzim near

Tehran, which would be demolished — thus further arousing religious
sentiment.
The Shah's 1873 European journey may be considered a failure, especially for
the hopes of Mirza Husain Khan, who had failed to anticipate the strongly
hostile attitude of the Russian authorities towards the Reuter Concession. His
hopes that this opposition would be overcome by official British support were
also dashed. British Foreign Office officials were inclined to despise Reuter asa
foreigner and aJew, and doubted the wisdom of a concession so calculated to
arouse Russian hostility.16 Without British government support and in the face
of Russia's hostility, private British financial backing, which was neededfor
significant economic projects to be carried out, also fell away.
Worse was in store, however. When the royal party landed at Anzali on the
Caspian, inSeptember 1873, a coalition of notables and culama demanded the
dismissal of Mirza Husain Khan. The threat of hostile action was so strong that
the Shah had togive in, despite his own continued trust inhis chief minister,
whom he now appointed governor of Gilan province. The Shah continued to
write to him secretly that hewould try to return him to Tehran assoon as
possible, and he succeeded in bringing Mirza Husain Khan back as Minister of
War in 1874. He was never again strong enough to attempt wholesale reform,
however.
Meanwhile, Iranian procrastination over Reuter's railway continued, and the
strength ofopposition tothe scheme became clear. Although Reuter tried to
start laying track in time to avoid forfeiting his caution money, his efforts were
blocked and the Shah was able to cancel the Concession on the ostensible
grounds that Reuter had failed to meet its terms. The Iranian government kept
the caution money, and Reuter appealed forredress to the British Foreign
Office. Although the Foreign Office had not hitherto shown any interest in
helping Reuter, it soon came to see his claim asan effective weapon against
Russian railway concession schemes which, London maintained, could not be
granted as long asReuter had a just claim.17
The story of the movement against the Reuter concession presents in embryo
some of the features of later Iranian oppositional movements: a heterogeneous
coalition ofnotables, culama, and common people, some primarily opposing
Western or infidel innovations, some patriotic or progressive, and some simply
self-interested orinfluenced by Russia, united against amove that they saw as
the sale ofIran's resources, and possibly control over the country, to foreign

infidels. What isdifferent about this first movement is not only its smaller size
and scope, but also the fact that some prominent reformers like Mirza Husain
Khan and Malkum Khan were on the side of the foreigner. The opposition was,
however, correct inseeing that the dangers toIranian independence implied by
such a large-scale British involvement outweighed any possible benefits.
In the years after 1873, the Shah returned toruling without a chief minister,
experimenting unsuccessfully with various conciliar and cabinet arrangements.
For much of this period power was divided between Mirza Husain Khan, who
added the Foreign Ministry to his post as War Minister, the reactionary MustaufT
al-Mamalik, who was incharge ofinternal affairs, and the shrewd Aqa Ibrahim
Amin al-Sultan, who became the Shah's closest confidant. They effectively
stopped each other from achieving anything important and Mirza Husain
Khan's further reforms, such as the provincial council scheme of 1875, were
mostly short-lived. Aqa Ibrahim, thesonof a Christian convert, rose from
menial service in the royal household to responsibility for the royal mint,
customs, royal treasury, Ministry ofCourt and several other important offices.
Though he had little education and noadministrative experience, his shrewd
ness, hissimplistic frugal approach to finance, and his expression of extreme
loyalty to the royal household appealed to the Shah. Opposition to Mirza Husain
Khan at Tehran continued, and in 1880 the Shah transferred himto the
governorship of Khurasan and the Mashhad shrine. There he died in November
1881 —under mysterious circumstances, according to some.18 The fall of Husain
Khan once again demonstrated the Shah's reluctance topay the political price
needed to form an efficient bureaucracy as a first step towards achieving
meaningful political and administrative reform.
The 1880s saw the rise topower ofthe most tenacious and long-lived chief
minister ofQajar Iran. Mirza All Asghar Khan Amin al-Sultan was the sonof
Aqa Ibrahim and, when only in his mid-twenties, he took over his father's titles
and positions on the latter's death in 1883—4. The younger Amin al-Sultan soon
rose to become the Shah's chief minister, with considerable authority. From the
beginning Amin al-Sultan was extremely arrogant towards other officials andat
times even treated the Shah contemptuously. Yet he was also aclever opportun
ist with allthe policital skills in party building that Mirza Husain Khan had
lacked, plus the supreme skill of knowing what had to be done tokeep the Shah

POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE LATER QAJARS
by insurmountable opposition; and to conservatives he was the arch conserva
tive. Although often blamed for the generally reactionary and foreign-oriented
policies that characterized the years of his power, itseems likely that he mainly
carried out the wishes of his royal master, since his principal aim was not to be
reformist orreactionary, but simply to stay in power.
Until 1892, Amln al-Sultan followed agenerally pro-British policy. During
his time in office the issue of foreign concessions again came to the fore. Some
concessions were granted in the early 1880s, but the real concession fever began
in 1888 when the forceful Sir Henry Drummond Wolff was sent by London as
Minister to Iran to strengthen the British position. He energetically advocated
economic concessions. Wolff believed that Iran could be made strong enough to
resist Russian incursions only through economic concessions which would both
develop the country and increase Western European commitment to Iran's
future. He had many friends in the financial world, and an unbounded faithin
the ability of foreign capitalists to solve the problem of backward countries. He
was naive in not expecting the Russians to react strongly against his programme,
and tried toreach an agreement with Russia over Iran atthe same time as he
pursued policies that the Russians could only oppose. At Wolff's prompting the
Shah opened the Karun River, in southern Iran, to international navigation in
1888 - a situation that could only be taken advantage ofby the British. The
Russians objected that they had an agreement with Iran whereby Iran could not
give transport concessions without Russian consent, but the Iranian govern
ment replied that opening their own river to navigation was not a concession.
Wolff also promoted asettlement of Reuter's outstanding claims through a new
concession to Reuter for abank with the exclusive right to issue banknotes, and
attached extensive rights in mineral exploitation. This bank, with its head
quarters inTehran and branches inseveral cities, was soon opened under the
somewhat bizarre name for a foreign firm, the Imperial Bank ofPersia. The
exclusive note-issuing privileges of the bank were aconsiderable blow to many
Persian merchants and moneychangers, who had issued their own form of notes
and tried to continue to do so until they were stopped. The competition of the
bank was disliked by the same groups, who more than once organized to make
large withdrawals of silver to undermine the bank's solvency. The Russians
countered these concessions with their own bank concession. The Russian Bank
was widely believed tobe government supported and did not have to make
money and hence could be used even more effectively than the British Bankto
make uneconomic loans to prominent persons in order to buy their loyalty. The
Russians also received road concessions.
On his trip through Russia in 1878 the Shah had been impressed bythe

Russian Cossack forces, and requested Russian officers tocommand and drill a
new Persian Cossack Brigade, which was founded in 1879. This soon became the
one well-trained and reliable force inthe Persian army (as large as2,000 menby
the 1890s), useful mostly for protecting the Shah and his government. Itwas also
another instrument ofRussian influence inIran. Added tothespate ofconces
sions from 1888 to 1890, itmeant that Iran was being increasingly manipulated
by Russian andBritish economic andpolitical pressures.
PROTEST AND REVOLUTION: 1890—1914
The economic and political dislocations brought bythe Western impact in
cluded the undermining ofmany Iranian handicrafts, the turning ofworkersin
the one favoured craft ofcarpets into wage labourers who often worked for a
pittance, the fall ofprices ofIranian exports ascompared toEuropean imports,
and the disastrous fall in the international price of silver, the basis of Iran's
currency. These plus the difficulty ofbeing atrader independent of Europeans
and the impossibility ofsetting upprotected factories led togrowing economic
discontent and resentment against European economic rivals. Increasing West
ern political andfinancial control ofIran was also resented, and thenumerous
Iranian traders and workers who travelled toIndia, Russian Transcaucasia, and
Turkey were able to witness reforms andhear liberal or radical ideas that
suggested ways that governments could change in form andcould undertake
modernizing andself-strengthening policies that might help Iran andfree the
country of foreign control.
In the 1880s and after there were anumber ofmen with official positions who
advocated reform. Among the ministers the most important was Amin al-Daula,
who had held a variety of posts, chiefly that of Minister of Posts, and was
generally considered asincere and honest reformer and westernizer who disliked
the corruption and foreign dominance he sawaround him. Less forceful or
powerful than men like Amir-i Kabir orMirza Husain Khan (with whom he did
not enjoy good relations), hecould achieve only little influence inthefaceof
power maintained by Amin al-Sultan. Mirza Malkum Khan (1883-1908), dis
cussed above, after his departure from Iran became for years the Minister ofIran
to Great Britain, and concentrated hisreform activities onpromoting a modi
fied Persian script and towritings directed toa small number ofelite Iranians.
In 1889 Nasir al-DIn Shah took histhird trip to Europe, a trip that was
heavily promoted byWolff, who hoped to further British financial interest in
Iran, and succeeded toagreat extent. Among the concessions signed by the Shah

was aconcession for alottery in Iran promoted in part by Malkum Khan. After
his return to Iran, theShah was faced with strong opposition to thelottery
concession, coming largely from the religious elements who noted that gam
bling was forbidden by the Koran. The Shah cancelled the concession and so
informed Malkum Khan, who hastened to sell the concesson fora handsome
price before it became known in England that it hadbeen cancelled. This
behaviour resulted in Malkum's dismissal from his posts and the stripping of all
his titles. This somewhat tarnished but influential reformer now decided either
to undermine, or alternatively to blackmail, the Iranian government by produc
ing an oppositional and reformist newspaper, Qanun (law), which was printed in
London and smuggled into Iran. Preaching the virtues ofa fixed legal system
and theevils of arbitrary and corrupt governments, Qanun concentrated its
personal attacks on Amin al-Sultan, and was quite widely read among Iran's elite
during the seven years of its existence, until the death of Nasir al-DIn Shah. The
only other free newspaper at this time, themuch older Akhtar putout by
Iranians in Istanbul, was much milder in its reformism, and hence, unlikeQanun,
was less frequently forbidden entry into Iran. Within Iran there were only
official journals, the one experience ofa freer paper launched with the encour
agement of Mlrza Husain Khan in 1876, the bilingual LaPatrie, lasted for only
one issue, as itsFrench editor called forfree and fearless criticism.
Before 1890 most educated westernizing reformers had been rather hostileto
the culama — as witness Amir-i Kablr, Mlrza Husain Khan, Amin al-Daula, and
the Babi and Baha°I reformers. On the other hand, some culama who felt Western
innovation was dangerous to Islam stood out as opponents of the alarming trend
towards the selling of Iran's resources to foreigners, and the culama's virtual
inviolability and their ties to theguilds could make even secular reformers
recognize them as useful allies inastruggle against foreign control. From 1890
to 1912 and even beyond there were occasions during which some reconciliation
existed between the secularist and culama elements of the opposition. One of the
forgers ofthis alliance, unusual inworld history, between religious and radical
elements was the internationally travelled Muslim reformer and pan-Islamist,
Sayyid Jamal al-DIn al-Afghani, 1839-97.19 He claimed Afghan birth and
upbringing, probably in order to have more influence in the Sunnl world than he
could have had as an Iranian who had a ShIcT education inIran and inthe Shfi

Avicenna and later Iranian philosophers, who were far more widely taught in
Iran than in the Sunn! Middle East, Afghani seems also to have been influenced
by the philosophically oriented Shaikh! school ofShicism. Inabout 1857-8, he
travelled to British India, where he seems to have developed alifelong hatred of
British imperialism. After an unsuccessful attempt inAfghanistan toarouse its
rulers against the British inthe late 1860s, he travelled toIstanbul, whencehe
was expelled in 1870 for a "heretical" talk that restated theviews of some
Muslim philosophers. In Egypt from 1871 to1879 he helped arouse and educate
a group of young men who were prominent in Egypt's national awakening, and
after his expulsion by the foreign-influenced khedive Taufiq, he continued his
modernist and anti-imperialist writing first in India and then inParis, where he
edited the anti-British and pan-Islamic Arabic newspaper, al-QUrwa al-Wuthqa.
After anunsuccessful attempt in London to influence British policy in Egypt
and the Sudan, he returned to the south Persian port city of Bushahr, whence he
had left before for India, and where hehad hisbooks sent from Egypt. He
apparently intended only to pick up his books and go toRussia, where his anti
British views had attracted the nationalist publicist Katkov. The Iranian Minis
ter of Press, Ttimad al-Saltana, who had read al-cUrwa al-Wuthqa,talked the Shah
into inviting Afghani toTehran. There he soon offended the Shah, apparently
by his violent anti-British proposals, but he began to gather around him a group
of Iranian disciples. To them he apparently spoke of the need of uniting religious
and nonreligious oppositions toforeign encroachments. Forced by the Shahto
leave Iran in 1887, he spent two years in Russia and then rejoined the Shah
during his third trip to Europe. He then went to Russia, believing hehad a
mission from Amin al-Sultan to smooth over Russian hostility regarding
concessions to the British, but inIran Amin al-Sultan denied giving him such a
mission and refused tosee him. Inthe summer of 1890 Afghan! heard that the
Shah was planning to exile him and forestalled this by taking bast (sanctuary)in
the shrine Shahzada Abd al- Azim just south ofTehran. Here he continued to
gather disciples towhom he explained such means oforganized opposition as
the secretly posted and distributed leaflet and the political secret society. His
contacts in Iran included his Tehran host, Amin al-Zarb, the largest and
wealthiest Persian merchant andmaster of the mint; Amin al-Daula; some
members of the culama, notably the ascetic and reformist Shaikh Had!
Najmabadi; and various reformers and ordinary people, such as his devoted
servant MIrza Riza Kirmani. InJanuary 1891, convinced that aleaflet strongly
attacking the government for its concessions to foreigners emanated from
Afghani, the Shah sent soldiers who forcibly dragged him from his sanctuary
194

and sent himon a forced march to the Iraqi border in mid-winter. From
Ottoman Iraq, and then from London, where hesoon proceeded and joined
Malkum Khan, Afghani continued towrite and speak against the Shah and his
government, and he left behind a number of disciples, some organized in asecret
society, whom hehad instructed in political action and agitation.
Discontent over the Shah's concession policy came to a head after he
conceded a complete monopoly over theproduction, sale and export of all
Iranian tobacco toa British subject, encouraged by Wolff, inMarch 1890. The
concession was kept a secret for a time, but inlate 1890 the newspaper Akhtar
began a series ofarticles severely criticizing the concession. The January 1891
leaflet that brought about Afghani's expulsion attacked the tobacco concession
among others, and new critical leaflets were issued by Afghani's followers in the
spring. The tobacco concession brought far more protest than any other because
it didnot, like theothers, deal with spheres that were unexploited, or only
slightly exploited, byIranian businessmen, but rather with a product already
widely grown throughout Iran, and profiting many landholders, large and small
merchants, shopkeepers and exporters.
Massive protests against the concession began in the spring of1891,when the
tobacco company's agents began to arrive and to post deadlines for the sale of all
tobacco to the company. The first major protest, led by areligious leader, came
in Shiraz, and this leader was exiled toIraq. There he conferred with Afghani,
who now wrote hisfamous letter to themost important leader of the Shici
culama, Hajji MIrza Hasan Shirazi, asking him to denounce the Shah and his sale
of Iran to Europeans. Some writers to the contrary notwithstanding, Shirazi did
not immediately take any strong action, but he did write privately tothe Shah
making many of the points that Afghani had made to him. A dangerously
revolutionary movement now broke out inTabriz, where the government was
forced to suspend the concession operation, and mass, largely merchant- and
ulama-led protests spread to Mashhad, Isfahan, Tehran andelsewhere. In
December 1891, the movement culminated inanincredibly successful nation
wide boycott on the sale and use of tobacco, observed even by the Shah's wives
and bynon-Muslims, which was based onanorder either issued by, or more
likely, attributed to Shirazi, which he subsequently confirmed. The government
tried to suppress only thecompany's internal monopoly, leaving it with an
export monopoly, but this proved impossible. A mass demonstration in Tehran
culminating in the shooting on an unarmed crowd causing several deaths,
followed by even more massive protests, forced the government tocancel the
entire concesson in early 1892. The affair left the Iranians with their first foreign

debt — £500,000 from the British owned Imperial Bank for exorbitant compen
sation tothe company. The movement was the first successful mass protest in
modern Iran, combining culama, modernists, merchants, and townspeople in a
coordinated movement against government policy. The movement's coordina
tion throughout Iran andwith themujtahids of Iraq was facilitated by the
existence and heavy use of the telegraph. Although many of the culama were
now bought offby the government and some quiet years followed, the "reli
gious-radical alliance" had shown its potential for changing the course of
Iranian policy, and the government did not grant further economic concessions
for several years.
The tobacco movement also encouraged the growth ofRussian influence at
the expense of the British. To preserve hisposition, Amin al-Sultan felt it
necessary toassure the Russians that he would henceforth be oriented towards
them, and hislater policies bore this out. The British policy of 1888—90,of
encouraging economic concessions bythe Shah — a policy favoured by Lord
Salisbury and the Foreign Office, and pushed with special energy by Wolff— had
backfired, as Russian counterconcessions and Russian support against the
tobacco concession culminated in an increase in Russian, and not British,
influence. Those who, looking only at the years 1888—90, dub the WolfT
ministry, which ended in 1890, a success close their eyes tothe implicitly anti
British revolt and the rise of Russian influence which were, in fact, themost
important international political consequences ofthat policy, as many contem
poraries recognized.20
cUlama opposition tothe Shah temporarily died down as many culama were
bought off, but attacks on the government from abroad continued. From
London, Afghani contributed strong articles toMalkum's J2####, and printed a
letter sent out to ShIcIculama in Iraq and Iran calling on them to depose the Shah.
Late in 1892, Afghani went to Istanbul asa guest of Sultan Abdulhamid, who
kept him from publishing further attacks onthe Shah, but encouraged him to
spread pan-Islamic propaganda among Iranians andother Shfls, calling on
them to lend support to theOttoman Sultan-Caliph. With this aim Afghani
formed an Iranian ShicT pan-Islamic circle inIstanbul, two ofwhose prominent
members were Azali Babis who had by now become radical freethinkers — Mirza
Aqa Khan Kirmani, awriter and editor oiAkhtar^ and his close friend, the poet
and teacher Shaikh Ahmad Ruhi, also of Kirman. The circle sent out numerous

letters to the ShicTculama in Iran andelsewhere calling on them to give allegiance
to the Sultan-Caliph. The Iranian Embassy complained of this activity, impli
citly directed atweakening the authority of the Shah (which helps explain the
participation of irreligious anti-Shah radicals in an apparently religious activity).
The Ottoman Sultan agreed to theextradition of Ruhi, Kirmani, and a
third Iranian, Khabir al-Mulk. While the three were waiting in prison in
Trabzon, however, Afghani intervened for them, and the Sultan agreed not to
send them to Iran.
Meanwhile, the devoted Iranian servant and follower of Afghani, Mirza Riza
Kirmani, who had been imprisoned for years for anti-government activities,
arrived to visit Afghani in Istanbul in 1895. There Afghani seems to have given
him theidea of returning to Iran to kill the Shah.21 After his return to Iran, Mirza
Riza made his wayto Shahzada cAbd al-A.zlm, aShici shrine, at the time that the
Shah was planning to visit itin preparation for the celebration of the 50th lunar
anniversary of his reign. Mirza Riza pretended to be apetitioner and suddenly
shot the Shah on 1 May 1896. Immediately after, he was attacked by acrowd of
women present in the shrine and lost an ear before he was saved by Amin al
Sultan. The Shah was whisked away from public view, and his dead body was
propped up in a carriage while Amin al-Sultan pretended to carry on a conversa
tion with him — this inorder toavoid the disorders and rebellions that often
accompanied a change of ruler. TheCossacks were notified to cover Tehran, and
disorder was avoided. Further anxiety concerned possible pretentions to the
throne by two ofthe Shah's powerful sons. Zill al-Sultan, the Shah's oldest
living son who wasexcluded from succession due to his mother's low birth, had
a long history ofpolitical power and ambition. Feared and powerful as the
oppressive governor of a large group of southern provinces, he had built up a
virtual private army ofwestern-trained soldiers that put most ofthe regular
army to shame, and had not hesitated tokill amajor Bakhtiyarl chief and put
down violently anyone he considered a threat.22 His ambition to take the throne
in place of his weak and sickly half-brother, the Crown Prince MuzafTar al-DIn,
was well known. Concern was also felt about his young brother, Kamran Mirza
Na°ib al-Saltana, frequently army chief and/or governor ofTehran, who had
the advantage of being on the scene inTehran. The combination of Amin al
Sultan, the Cossacks, and the clearly expressed support ofboth Russians and

British for thelegitimate heir, however, brought expressions of loyalty to
Muzaffar al-Din byboth brothers.
Nasir al-DIn Shah was scarcely an illustrious or progressive ruler, but he was
a relatively powerful one, under whose rule there were fewserious tribal
disorders orlocal revolts. The disorders he faced were more directly political,
and he orhis advisors had atleast the negative virtue ofknowing when it was
necessary to bend or give in. Unlike his son he did not squander his treasury, and
the loan raised to pay compensation tothe tobacco company remained his only
foreign loan. His interest in reform was sporadic at best, and hesacrificed or
crippled the power of his only two serious reforming chief ministers when faced
by the opposition ofvested interests. In his last years helost even this much
interest in reform —a supposed project for codifying laws after the 1889
European trip came to nothing. Instead, he turned to the consolation of
women and ofa repulsive boy protege, and toacquiring asmuch money and
treasure as possible, without spending it forany public purpose. Heleft no
legacy of a state or army machinery that might weather the eventuality he must
have known was coming — the rule of a weak and sickly successor.
Not all of Nasir al-DIn's actions had negative results however. His patronage
of the arts contributed toinnovations inmusic, painting, and calligraphy.He
also took a keen interest inpoetry, and even tried his hand at writing poems.
Significant literary novelties developed during his reign, many of which origi
nated with court poets. Writers, who became important in political protest
before and during theConstitutional period, took important steps towards
reforming the archaic character of Persian prose. Increased Western contacts
influenced many of these innovations. Several European works were translated.
A few modern schools and medical clinics were established, mostly by European
missionaries. Other new services included the establishment of the first modern
police force in Tehran with the advice of an Austrian officer (1879). City services
in Tehran, such as cleaning, paving and lighting streets, collection of refuse and
maintenance of public parks got their first impetus towards the end of this
period. Inaddition tothese, telegraphs, regular newspapers, and banking and
limited insurance services were introduced in Iran for the first time during Nasir
al-DIn Shah's reign.23 Postal services also expanded and first postage stamps
were circulated (1868). Incomparison with countries like Egypt and Ottoman
Turkey, however, these changes were limited.

Muzaffar al-Dln Shah's relatively mild nature was shown inhis treatment of
Mirza Riza Kirmani, who was extensively interrogated but not tortured before
he was hanged. The Iranian government also demanded from the Ottomans the
extradition ofAfghani and ofhis three followers still jailed inTrabzon. Sultan
Abdulhamid still refused to return Afghani, claiming he was an Afghan and not
subject toIranian jurisdiction. The three unfortunate progressives in Trabzon,
however, who had no connection with the Shah's assassination, were extradited,
and the cruel new crown prince, Muhammad cAli Mirza, had them summarily
executed in Tabriz. Continued Iranian demands for Afghani's extradition
(Mirza Riza having said that Afghani was the only other person involved inthe
assassination) stopped when Afghani became extremely ill with cancer, and died
in 1897.
Muzaffar al-DIn Shah's weak character did not prevent him from being open
to reformist forces. Heallowed thereturn to activity of a man nicknamed
"Rushdiyya" because he had set up a modernized type of"Rushdiyya" higher
school on theOttoman model in Tabriz, where it met with overwhelming
religious hostility. Such schools were now opened for the first time in Tehran.
The Shah also dismissed the unpopular Amin al-Sultan and, later, appointed the
reformist Amin al-Daula to be chief minister in August 1897. The Shah,
however, had paid off his father's huge harem extravagently, and now was
continuously eager to have money to meet the incessant demands ofhis own
courtiers, many of whom had come with him from Tabriz and pressed tomake
up for the years of relatively lean waiting. The Shah's doctors also advised trips
to European watering spots, and he wanted money for this too. When Amin al
Daula was unable toraise a new loan from the British, and when his reformist
attempts in law, administration offinance,and education aroused the opposition
of culama and courtiers, he was dismissed and Amin al-Sultan was brought back
as premier in 1898. Amin al-Daula's efforts forfiscalreform and centralization,
like similar measures attempted by reforming ministers before him, were
frustrated byopposition from court vested-interest groups and some govern
ment officials and culama. His abolition of the baratsystem (assignment of drafts
to becollected from provincial treasuries) made officials dependent for their
salaries on the central treasury, which they saw as an ineffective tax collector and
an unreliable provider of income. Reorganization of finances also meant acut in
court spending, which affected the entire ruling family including the Shah.24

One of Amin al-Daula's projects wasto invite in some Belgian customs
administrators to reorganize the customs, which had been farmed out region by
region, resulting in customs farmers underbidding each other, below the already
low 5 % limit, inorder toattract trade, and also infarmers collecting farmore
than they paid in. The Belgian experiment was extended under Amin al-Sultan,
and theleader of the Belgians, Naus, was made Minister of Customs. This
resulted in anincrease in efficiency and collection, but also widespread com
plaints by Iranian merchants that they were discriminated against infavour of
foreigners, particularly the Russians, with whom the Belgians had close rela
tions. The exact validity of these charges is unclear, but it is clear that many
Iranian merchants had now to pay more than formerly, and that they blamed this
on the Shah, the prime minister, and the presence of foreigners. Naus's influence
soon extended far beyond customs, and he became defacto Minister ofFinance.
In order to pay forthe foreign trips recommended bythe Shah's doctors,
Amin al-Sultan floated two large loans from Russia, in 1900 and 1902. The first
loan required Iran topay off its British debts and not toincur any other debts
without Russian consent, while the second oneincluded major economic
concessions. The Russians also insisted on a new customs treaty, which was
signed in 1902, and gave key Russian goods lower rates than the already low 5 %
advalorem. The income gained from the loans and from customs reform was not
used productively, and went largely for the three extravagantly expensive trips
to Europe which the Shah and his entourage took between 1900 and 1905.
Meanwhile, discontent with the government was becoming organized once
again. Secret oppositional societies became active in Tehran and elsewhere, and
distributed inflammatory leaflets, called shabnamas(night letters) because of
their night-time distribution, against the government in 1900 and 1901. Some
members of the societies were afterwards discovered andarrested. A new
coalition among some of the leading culama, courtiers, and secular progressives
began tofocus on the dismissal of Amin al-Sultan, who was seen as responsible
for the alarming growth of loans and concessions to the Russians that were
leading toRussian control ofIran. Even the British, alarmed atthe growthof
Russian influence, gave some money and encouragement to leading members of
the culama in Tehran and in the shrine cities of Iraq to help arouse activity
against the Russian-favoured trade agreement. This opposition movement also
called for the removal of Belgian customs officials and closure of newly
established modern schools. These agitations were accompanied by an outburst
of anti-foreign and anti-minority feelings ina few cities, instigated by someof
the culama. Chief among these were the anti-Baha°I riots of the summer of1903
200

PROTEST AND REVOLUTION, 189O-I914
which led tothe killing ofdozens ofBaha°Is inIsfahan and Yazd. The Baha^is
were easier scapegoats than the foreign subjects residing in Iran.25
Although unable to stop the 1902 loan from Russia as they had tried,the
opposition became menacing enough to help force the dismissal of Aminal
Sultan (now adorned with thehigher title of Atabak) in September 1903.A
decree execrating theAtabak as an unbeliever attributed to theleading Sh!c!
ulama of Iraq was widely circulated and believed, although doubts were cast on
its authenticity.26
The Shah now appointed a reactionary relative of his, cAin al-Daula, as
premier, but popular protests against the Belgian customs officials and against
high prices continued. Secret societies grew, and some helped toeducate their
members by reading and disseminating critical literature about Iran written in
Persian abroad. This literature formed the basis for the ideological awakening of
many Iranians who had not travelled abroad orreceived modern education. It
included theworks of men of Persian Azarbaijan! origin living in Russian
Transcaucasia, such asFath All Akhundov, whose father had migrated from
Iranian Azarbaijan. His anonymous Kamalal-Daulava Jalal al-Daula^ acollection
of fictitious epistles describing conditions in Iran, was bitterly critical. Asimilar
series of Persian letters was imitated byMlrza Aqa Khan KirmanI, who also
wrote other books and articles critical ofIranian conditions. Also widely read
were the educational works of Talibov, an Azarbaijanl emigre to Transcaucasia,
and especially the "Travelbook of Ibrahim Beg" by Zain al- Abidin Maragha%
a book of fictitious travels inIran that mercilessly exposed the evils of Iranian
society. Less known, but not without influence, were other critical works, such
as the translation of James Morier's Hajji Baba of Isfahan by Mlrza Hablb
Isfahan!, which added sharpness and a more contemporary flavour ofcriticism
to the original. The "True Dream" by the progressive preachers from Isfahan,
Jamal al-DIn Isfahan! and Malik al-Mutakallimin, criticized under false names
such high ranking culama as the notorious Aqa NajafI, who used their position
to add to their wealth and power, and corrupt governors such as Zill al-Sultan.27
Such fiction reinforced the impression created by the reformist political
writings of Malkum Khan and others, and by the newspapers published abroad
and sent into Iran (with greater freedom under Muzaffar al-D!n than under

Hablal-Matln from Calcutta. The legally distributed papers in Iran continued to
be only official orsemi-official ones.28
Some Iranians now began toplan revolutionary action, and revolutionary
sentiment was strengthened bythe Russo-Japanese War of 1904—5 and the
Russian Revolution of 1905. Iranians knew that Russia would intervene against
any attempt to overthrow or undermine Qajar government, but withthe
Russian government fully occupied first with war and then with revolution, it
was clearly apropitious time to move. In addition, the strength shown by the
recently backward Japanese against the dreaded Russians gave people courage,
as did the possibility of shaking by revolution such a potent autocracy as that of
Russia. The sight ofthe only Asian constitutional power defeating the only
major European nonconstitutional power not only showed formerly weak
Asians overcoming the seemingly omnipotent West, but aroused much new
interest in Iran as elsewhere in Asia in aconstitution as a "secret of strength".
The Iranian Constitutional Revolution is usually dated from December1905,
when the governor of Tehran bastinadoed agroup of sugar merchants for not
lowering their raised sugar prices. Merchants were joined by a large group of
mullas and tradesmen who then took sanctuary (bast) in the Royal Mosque of
Tehran, whence they were dispersed by agents ofAin al-Daula with the help of
the Imam Jumca of Tehran, a leading pro-government cleric. A group ofculama
then decided, atthe suggestion of the prominent reforming mujtahid, Sayyid
Muhammad Tabataba°i, to retire to the shrine of Shahzada cAbd al-cAzim, south
of Tehran. There they were joined by a crowd of some 2,000 religious students,
middle- and low-ranking mullas, merchants andcommon people. Thebast took
25days and wasfinanced by discontented merchants and rivals of Ain al-Daula,
including supporters of Amin al-Sultan.29 The crucial demand was for arepre
sentative Qadalatkhana ("house of justice") of which the meaning and composi
tion were not spelled out— perhaps in order to maintain the unity of modernizers
and traditional culama. The Shah dismissed the unpopular governor of Tehran,
and in January 1906, agreed to thecadalatkhana, upon which theculama returned
to Tehran and were received with enthusiasm. The Shah and Ain al-Daula
showed no sign of fulfilling the promise, however, and further agitation against
the government bythe popular and radical preachers, Sayyid Jamal al-DIn

Isfahan! and Shaikh Muhammad Vaciz, increased, and provided apotent means
of mass political enlightenment in the absence ofan open oppositional press.
Sayyid Jamal was expelled from Tehran, and the government ordered Shaikh
Muhammad tobe expelled too. On 11 July 1906, confronting a strong popular
attempt to keep Shaikh Muhammad from being expelled, an officer killed a
young sayyid. After this a great mass ofmullas and some others left Tehran to
take bast in Qum, on 20 July 1906, while even greater numbers of merchants and
tradesmen, reaching 12,000—14,000, took aweek-long bast in the grounds of the
British legation inTehran (British personnel then being insummer quarters in
Qulhak), while Tehran business was atastandstill. Inside the legation grounds
the protesters were organized according to their guild affiliations, each guild
having itsown tent and cooking equipment. Revolutionary propaganda was
propagated by the preachers present. Now the protestors demanded and finally
got not only the dismissal ofcAin al-Daula, but also arepresentative assembly or
majlis— zn idea put forth by the constitutionalists. Although not yet demanded
by the movement, the word constitution, mashrutiyyat, began to be voiced by the
advanced reformers.
At the end of July the Shah dismissed cAin al-Daula, and early inAugust he
accepted the majlis. Thefirst Majlis (Assembly) was elected by a six-class
division of electors that gave far greater representation to theguilds (who
comprised mainly middle- and lower-middle-class elements) than they found in
subsequent Majlises elected by a one-class system dominated by the landlords
and the rich. Tehran, the most politically advanced city aside from Tabriz, got
disproportionate representation (60 out of156 deputies were from Tehran). The
first Majlis opened in October 1906, as soon as the Tehran deputies were elected.
A committee was assigned to write theFundamental Law, which the Shah
delayed signing until he was mortally ill, inDecember 1906. Alonger Supple
mentary Fundamental Law was added in 1907, and signed bythe new Shah,
Muhammad All, in October. These twodocuments, based largely on the
Belgian constitution, formed the core of the Iranian constitution until 1979.
These documents were more honoured inthe breach than the observance after
1912, and especially after 1925. The clear intent of the constitution was to set upa
truly constitutional monarchy in which Majlis approval was required on all
important matters, including foreign loans and treaties, and inwhich ministers
would be responsible tothe Majlis. Equality before the law and personal rights
and freedoms, subject to afew limits, were also guaranteed, despite the protests
of the culama that members ofminority religions should not have equal status
with those of the state religion, Islam. The Majlis also passed laws guaranteeing
203

compulsory public education and free press. The culama opposed these lawsas
being anti-Islamic. The Majlis quickly showed its patriotism by refusing a new
Russian loan and beginning plans for anational bank instead, which, however,
ultimately foundered due tolack of capital. Two conservative provisions, for a
group of mujtahids to rule on the compatibility of laws with Islam and for a half
appointed upper-house, were not enforced, although the Senate was created on
Muhammad Riza Shah's initiative after World War II.
The new freedoms of press and assembly brought about asudden flourishing
of newspapers, which not only carried direct political news and comments, but
also published some of the best new poetry and satire. Particularly noteworthy
was the Sur-i Israfil with its poems and the brilliant political satire ofthe young
Dihkhuda. Revolutionary societies oranjumans were formed throughout Iran,
some of them based on older guilds or fraternal groups, which now became
actively involved in politics. The term anjuman was also used for the city
councils, usually elected, which now appeared forthe first time inmany cities
with parliamentary encouragement.
In January 1907, the mild and ineffectual MuzarTar al-DIn Shah died, and was
succeeded by his cruel and autocratic son, Muhammad All Shah. Although the
new Shah had totake an oath tosupport the constitution, he did not invite any
Majlis deputies tohis coronation, and he recalled as prime minister the Atabak,
who had been travelling abroad since his dismissal in 1903. Since the constitu
tion was not categorical about who really appointed the prime minister, and the
Majlis wished to avoid a direct clash with thenew Shah, they accepted the
appointment despite hostile telegrams from anjumans and internal arguments.
Conflicts over the Atabak's return and over the constitution occurred between
the conservative party in theMajlis, ledby thetwo prime mujtahids of the
revolution, Sayyid Muhammad Tabataba°I and the less principled Sayyid Abd
Allah Bihbahani, and by liberal officials, and the smaller democratic left,
represented especially by the deputies from the progressive city of Tabriz led by
the patriotic young Sayyid Hasan Taqlzada. Tabriz and itssurrounding prov
ince of Azarbaljan made up the advanced body of the revolution. More
modernized economically, heavily involved in international trade, and in con
tact through travel and emigration with the similarly Turkish-speaking areas of
Istanbul and Russian Transcaucasia (where many thousands emigrated tempor
arily or permanently every year, and from whence arms were imported), Tabriz
was uniquely situated to play a vanguard role.
The Atabak did not fulfill the Shah's hope that he would get rid of the Majlis,
but rather tried tostrike acompromise between the Shah and courtiers and the

Majlis conservatives. Inso doing, he aroused the distrust ofboth the autocrats
and the radicals. Hewas assassinated bya member of a radical group on 31
August 1907, but there isconvincing evidence that the Shah was also planning
his assassination and may even have penetrated the assassin's group.30 The Shah
hoped to use the assassination as an excuse to suppress the revolutionaries, but in
fact, it encouraged them and increased their strength and boldness.
On the same date, 31 August 1907, the Anglo-Russian Treaty settling their
differences in Tibet, Afghanistan, andIran was signed. The growth of the
German threat encouraged this treaty, which hurt Iranians, who had counted on
British help against Russian intervention. The treaty divided Iran into three
spheres, with northern and central Iran, including Tehran and Isfahan, in the
Russian sphere; south-east Iran in the British sphere; and anarea in between
(ironically including the area where oil was first found in 1908) in the neutral
zone. The Iranians were neither consulted on the agreement nor informed asto
its terms when it was signed.
After an unsuccessful assassination attempt on the Shah, andan equally
unsuccessful coup attempt by the Shah, the Shah executed a successful coup with
the help of the Russian-led Cossack Brigade in June 1908. The Majlis was closed
and many popular nationalist leaders, especially those of more advanced views,
were arrested and executed. The radical preachers, Jamal al-DIn Isfahan!, caught
while trying toflee, Malik al-Mutakallimin, and the editor of Sur-1 Israft'/,Mirza
Jahangir Khan (the last two hadAzall BabI ties) were among those killed.
Taqizada (and some others) found refuge in the British Legation, whence he
went abroad for a time. While the rest of the country bowed to royal control, the
city of Tabriz which, exceptionally, had anarmed and drilled popular guard,
held out against royal forces. The leaders ofthis popular resistance were brave
men of humble origin. One of them, Sattar Khan, had defied the royal order to
put up white flags as asign of surrender to the approaching royal forces, and had
instead gone around with his men tearing down white flags, thus initiating the
Tabriz resistance. With the help of his co-leader, Baqir Khan, Sattar Khan and
their men held out for months against an effective siege by royalist troops. When
food supplies became critical the Russians sent troops into Tabriz ostensibly to
protect Europeans, but effectively they took over. Many of the popular forces,
known alternatively as mujahids orfidaDis,both implying self-sacrificing fight
ers for the faith, left for the nearby Caspian province of Gllan, where they were
joined by alocal revolutionary armed force, and together they began amarch on

Tehran. Meanwhile the Bakhtiyari tribe, which had several grudges against the
Qajars, and had some leaders who were genuinely liberal and others who wanted
to getmuch of the power of the central government into their own hands,
helped to liberate Isfahan from royalist forces and began moving northwards
toward Tehran. The Bakhtiyaris and the northern revolutionaries converged on
Tehran inJuly 1909; the Shah took refuge with the Russians and his minor son
Ahmad was made Shah with theQajar prince, A.zud al-Mulk and, later,the
conservative Oxford-educated Nasir al-Mulk as regents.
In hisopposition to theMajlis, Muhammad CA1I Shah was assisted by a
number of high-ranking culama. Foremost among them were Shaikh Fazl-Allah
Nuri, later hanged by Constitutionalists in 1909, and Sayyid Muhammad Yazdi
of the Iraqi shrine cities. These clerics initially sawthe movement as an
opportunity to increase their political influence and prevent Westernizing
reforms. By 1907, when the liberals had gained the upper hand in radicalizing
and secularizing themovement, theconservative elements shifted sides and
began tooppose the constitution.31 The second Majlis was elected under a new
electoral law calling for a single class ofvoters, and was marked by differences
between what were now considered parties — the Moderates, led by BihbahanI,
who was assassinated by an extremist in 1910, and the new Democratic Party led
by men like Taqizada, who was forced toleave Iran after Bihbahani's assassina
tion, with which hewas surely unconnected.
Iran's chief problem remained finances, with the related problem of re
establishing control over the provinces, many ofwhich were more subject than
ever to tribal disorders and robberies, and remitted little of their due taxes.
Desiring aforeigner unconnected with the British orthe Russians, the Iranians
brought ayoung American expert, Morgan Shuster, to control and reform their
finances. Shuster proposed to set up atax-collecting gendarmerie, and to head it
he proposed an officer in the British Indian army, then with the British Legation
in Tehran, Major Stokes, who agreed to resign his commission and position.
The Russians protested that theAnglo-Russian Agreement meant that they
should control any such officials in thenorth, and convinced theBritish to
support their position. In November 1911, theRussians sent an ultimatum
demanding the dismissal of Shuster and the agreement of Iran not to engage
foreigners without British and Russian consent. The Majlis rejected the ulti
matum, butas Russian troops advanced toward Tehran the more compliant

dissolved the second Majlis, accepted the ultimatum, and dismissed Shuster, in
December 1911.
These events marked the real endof the revolution, which maybe considered
a short-term failure, but which left a considerable legacy. Inaddition to the
constitution itself, a series of financial reforms ending feudal grants and regular
izing financial practices remained as a legacy, as did a move toward greater civil
jurisdiction inthe courts, and the Majlis as a guardian against certain foreign
encroachments. Another important newfeature of the period before and during
the revolution was the entry of women into the political arena. Although
women had long participated in bread riots, they now staged some political
demonstrations, andTehran hadawomen's anjuman anda women's newspaper.
This trend wasto grow significantly after World WarI, when several short-lived
women's newspapers advocated the need forimprovement of the status of
women, especially through promotion of education. Women's organizations,
however, were often disrupted by conservative culama and others.32
Although the constitution was never abrogated, no new Majlis was elected
until 1914 and Russian troops continued tooccupy northern Iran, while the
anjumans were dissolved, the Press was censored and power returned to a
conservative cabinet under vigilant British and especially Russian control.
Despite the constitution and political awakening that remained as positive
achievements, many people reverted to apathy and cynicism when faced bythe
restoration offoreign and conservative controls.
In 1901, a British subject, D'Arcy, had been granted a concession for oilinall
Iran except the five northern provinces — Russian reaction being forestalled by
the ruse of presenting the (Persian) text of the concession to the Russian legation
at atime when the chief minister knew that the Russians' translator was away.
Although the first years' explorations were discouraging, oil was finally struck
in the southwest in 1908. In 1912 the British navy converted from coal to oil and
in 1914 the British government bought a majority ofshares inthe company
holding theconcession.33 The company backed thevirtually autonomous
Shaikh Khazcal, the most powerful Arab leader in Khuzistan province, and also
entered into independent relations with the adjacent region, and the British
exercised acontrol in the south quite comparable to that held by Russia in the
north. Given their experience with the British and Russians for decades, it was
no wonder that many Iranian nationalists anddemocrats turned to the Germans
for support during World WarI.

IRAN UNDER THE LATER QAJARS, I848-I922
The coronation of the 17-year-old Ahmad Shah in July 1914 took place eight
days before the outbreak of World War I. When World War I began, the Iranian
government declared its neutrality, but Iran was nonetheless used as a battlefield
by four powers, with Turks moving into Azarbaijan in 1914 after the Russians
had to withdraw their troops. Iranians took advantage of the Russian with
drawal to elect the third Majlis late in 1914. It opened in January 1915 and
attempted further abortive financial reforms. As part of a secret Anglo-Russian
treaty of1915 promising Russia control of Istanbul and the Straits, the Russians
granted the British post-war control ofthe Iranian neutral zone inaddition to
the British zone. In 1915 the "German Lawrence", Wassmuss, organized a tribal
revolt in the south against the British. InTehran the government, pressured by
pro-German nationalist deputies, entered secret negotiations with the German
envoy for joining theCentral Powers in return for guarantees of territorial
integrity and military assistance. Meanwhile, the Russians defeated the Turks
and reached QazvTn, 60 miles from Tehran. Fearing a Russian take-over ofthe
capital, the Tehran government decided tomove the capital to Isfahan inorder
to receive German support. The Russians prevented this move by threatening
to depose theyoung Shah and to bring back hisexiled father Muhammad
All.34 However, a group of pro-German nationalist deputies left Tehran to
set up the Committee for National Defence in Qum and thereby
managed todissolve the third Majlis. Inface ofRussian advances, they had to
retreat to Kirmanshah where they received further financial assistance from
Germany to organize tribal forces against the British and the Russians. Once
defeated and expelled, many fled to Istanbul and Berlin to carry out pro-Central
Powers propaganda. Tocounter pro-German activities, the British regained
control of the south in 1916 by forming alocal military force, the South Persia
Rifles, under Sir Percy Sykes, and supplied arms and money to Bakhtiyarl tribes
and Arab tribes, the latter under Shaikh Khazcal.
The war brought devastation, disruption and famine toIran. This political
and economic crisis was exacerbated by an emotionally disturbed and indecisive
Shah, constant tribal disturbance, separatist and rebellious movementsand
foreign intervention. The outcome was a multitude of short-lived cabinets,
which helped reduce the authority of the central government to a bare mini
mum. Popular reformist, secessionist, andrevolutionary movements began
throughout Iran, bringing political disintegration at thecentre. A partially

Kuchik Khan, took control of Gilan province in 1917-18. Revolutionary
feeling was encouraged by the February and especially October revolutions in
Russia. InJune, 1919 the Bolsheviks renounced the unequal loans, treaties and
concessions Russia had been granted in Iran, thus gaining in popularity. Adding
to disruption and discontent was a terrible famine in 1918—19, which was as
usual worsened byhoarders and speculators.
With Russian troops out and the Central Powers beaten, the British were the
only important outside military and economic power inIran. The British, and
especially the Foreign Secretary, Curzon, hoped to extend British rule or
protectorates over most ofthe Middle East, and especially in oil rich Iraq and
Iran. In1919, the British negotiated atreaty (signed after large bribes were given
to premier Vusuq al-Daula and two other ministers), which made Britain the
sole supplier of foreign advisors, officers, arms, communications, transport, and
loans, andpromising a pro-British tariff revision. Involving a loan of two
million pounds sterling, the treaty was widely interpreted as meaning a British
protectorate.
U.S. and French representatives protested, and Iranians noted that according
to their constitution notreaty could beconcluded without Majlis ratification;
nonetheless, theBritish began to actas if the treaty were in force, sending
financial, military, andadministrative missions. Widespread opposition to
wards the treaty was expressed indemonstrations and newspaper articles. The
Democratic Party of Azarbaijan, under the leadership of Shaikh Muhammad
Khiyabani, set up self-government in the province and forced the central
government's agents toquit Tabriz. The autonomous provincial government
formed by Khiyabani inAzarbaijan, came under attack by rebellious tribes and
finally came toan end upon his murder by the Cossacks inTabriz in September
1920.35 In Gilan, Red Army troops landed at Anzall in the Spring of 1920, to
chase out White Russian forces, and there ensued atemporary coalition between
Kuchik Khan and the newly formed Communist Party of Iran, acoalition which
in June declared a Soviet Socialist Republic, even though no socialist measures
were taken.36 This coalition soon came to anend when the landowning, pro
Islamic Jangalis quarrelled with radical leftists.
The combination of Iranian and foreign opposition to the pro-British cabinet
and the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1919 forced Vusuq al-Daula toresign in July

1920. Amoderate nationalist government under Mushir al-Daula now declared
the treaty suspended until foreign troops should quit Iran and the Majlis could
debate freely. Although the next premier, the Sipahdar, was pro-British and put
British officers in command of the Cossack Brigade, and prepared tosubmit the
1919 treaty toa newly elected Majlis, he never dared bring the treaty toa vote,
and in effect it soon lapsed. The government now suppressed theautonomy
movement in Azarbaijan with the aid of the Cossack Brigade, but there
continued tobe risings inthe provinces. The Gilan Jangalis extended their rule
to neighbouring Mazandaran, but were wracked by disagreement between the
Communists and Kiichik Khan.
By early 1921, theBritish stopped pressing for the 1919 treaty, and some
British leaders thought rather oftrying toinstall a strong Iranian government
that would guard against revolutions andwould bring "law andorder" to
disrupted Iran. The manuscript diary of Major General Edmund Ironside, then
head ofa British force inIran, shows that heconsulted with a strong and able
colonel in theCossack Brigade, Riza Khan, and assured him of benevolent
British non-interference in the event of his taking over the government.
Ironside failed to get the young, weak Ahmad Shah to agree to Riza Khan's rule,
and a few days later, in February 1921, Riza Khan's Cossacks entered Tehran and
overthrew the Sipahdar government. Anew government was set upafter this
coup d'etat with a pro-British but nationalist journalist, Sayyid Ziya al-Dln
Tabataba°I, as premier, while Riza Khan was to be the Minister of War. The new
government ordered the arrest of some 60 of the members of the ruling elite who
were soon released. To meet the democratic and nationalist demands that were
widespread inIran, Sayyid Ziya promised land reform, national independence,
and other reforms, and annulled the Anglo-Persian Treaty. He also completed
pending negotiations for an Irano-Soviet Treaty, signed late in February, which
renounced all Russian loans, concessions, and special privileges in Iran with the
exception ofthe Russian Caspian Fisheries concession, which had brought the
Russians great profits from caviare production since its negotiation inthe late
nineteenth century. The treaty had an article permitting the Russians tosendin
troops against the troops of any third power using Iran as abase against Russia.
Directed originally against the White Russians and their foreign allies, the article
was cited after World War II by the Soviet Union against American troops in
northern Iran, although no Russian troops were sent against them. This treaty
and the British strategic retreat inthe face ofthe force ofnationalist sentiment
gave considerable impetus togreater economic and political self-determination
for Iran.

PROTEST AND REVOLUTION, 1890-1914
Quarrels between Riza Khan and Sayyid Ziya forced the latter to resign and
to quit Iran for over two decades. Qavam al-Saltana now became premier, and
the fourth Majlis opened in June 1921, but real power was increasingly in the
hands of Riza Khan. Riza Khan moved to re-establish central control over
rebellious areas, especially Gilan, where, in late 1921, Kuchik Khan expelled the
leftists from his government. Such internal discord made it fairly easy forRiza
Khan to send troops and defeat the Jangalis at the end of1921. The year also saw
a revolt among the tribes and others in Khurasan, where ashort-lived provincial
government of Khurasan was formed under the gendarmerie colonel,
Muhammad Taqi Khan Pisyan, with the help of other Democratic Party
members. This movement came to an end late in 1921 when Colonel Pisyan was
killed righting tribal insurgents. The post-war popular movements had suffered
from geographical and ideological divisions, lack of unified leadership, and the
willingness of the British to be forced into apartial retreat infavour of a strong
non-radical government. These disunited movements could thus be put down
one by one; they had contributed, however, to thenullification of a British
protectorate, and had given impetus tothe need for areformist strongman who
would bring Iran security and political stability. The new regime adopted some
of the modernizing, centralizing, and nationalistic goals of the reformers and
revolutionaries without permitting popular participation in government or
fundamental economic changes toimprove the lives ofworkers, peasants, and
tribespeople. The regime won over many moderate nationalists frightened of
revolution and disorder.
Sprung from a very modest family in Mazandaran andhaving a limited
education, Riza Khan was aself-made man whose successful career and forceful
ness in the Cossack Brigade as well as his political skill gave him the background
needed to be a man of destiny at a crucial turning point in Iranian history.
Rapidly increasing his control over the Iranian government, he first took
complete control of the existing armed forces, including the South Persia Rifles
and the gendarmerie. In October 1923, he became prime minister and continued
to augment his authority. In192 5, he adopted the family name PahlavT, that of an
ancient Iranian language, thus emphasizing pre-Islamic grandeur. Traditional
titles were abolished and Iranians were given the opportunity of choosing their
own last names.37 In the same year, Riza Khan proclaimed himself the new Shah,
putting anend tothe Qajar dynasty inanact which met little resistance in the
Majlis. The dramatic changes that preceded hisabdication in 1941 included

settlement and disarmament of the tribes; introduction of Western clothing and
the unveiling of women; the building of state-owned factories, roads, and Iran's
first modern railroad; the modernization andexpansion of education; civil
codes; and the building ofmodern armed forces and bureaucracy.38 Yet there
was anegative side too; an autocracy made more efficient than ever by the army
and modern transport; the forbidding of strikes and opposition movements and
writings; the jailing and killing ofopponents; and the financing of moderniza
tion through repressive taxes onthe poor, whose economic status appears to
have declined in theperiod.
The Qajar period was one ofvery gradual change, occurring largely under
the surface, butcreating new formations andgroups in both economic and
political life. The following Pahlavl period was one offar more rapid changein
all spheres, inwhich many of the demands of the middle class were met, but not
the demand for popular self-government andeconomic betterment for the
common people. Under Riza Shah Pahlavl two elements among the old ruling
classes were very much weakened — the leading culama and the tribal leaders.
The power of the landlords as a class was not broken, however, but became
largely merged with that of the army, the court, the bureaucracy and the modern
upper bourgeoisie, who formed a new element in Iran's ruling elite.The
ineffective policies of Qajar government led ultimately toits downfall in favour
of a government which, for all its mixed character, at least introduced long
overdue reforms that modernized and strengthened the country.

CHAPTER 6
THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: RIZA SHAH,
1921— 41
The close of the First World War found Iran in a state of near anarchy. Despite
its proclaimed neutrality, it had been invaded and fought over by the troops of
the various belligerents, the eventual outcome being occupation by British and
Russian forces. In some provinces the war had caused serious dislocation of
economic life. Agricultural production had fallen, the presence of the occupying
forces had created acute shortages of basic commodities, while bad harvests over
extensive areas of the country, coupled with manipulation of the grain markets
by speculators, had resulted in devastating famines. Such scanty prestige as the
government of Ahmad Shah had possessed in 1914 had been further eroded by
1918. Ahmad Shah had succeeded his detested father, Muhammad cAli Shah, in
1909 at the age of twelve, but he was hardly more than a cipher.1 Over vast tracts
of the country tribal chieftains or great landlords, such as the Shaukat al-Mulk of
Birjand and Qa°in, exercised a seigneurial authority with little regard for the
Tehran government.2 Since 1906, Iran had been a constitutional monarchy, with
an elected Majlis, or parliament, and a cabinet appointed by the Shah but
responsible to the country's chosen representatives, although the language of
the original Constitutional Law relating to the subject was ambiguous.3 The
deputies of the Majlis constituted, for the most part, fairly obvious "interest
groups": landowners, tribal leaders, the culama, and in the case of the larger
urban centres, the ba^ar. Ministers, Majlis deputies and high-ranking adminis
trators generally belonged to families which had long served the Qajars as
courtiers or officials. Not a few, thanks to the fecundity of Fath cAli Shah and
some other members of his family, were descendants, if sometimes through
rather remote lineages, of the ruling house. Ministers and other prominent
politicians were frequently denounced for being "pro-British" or "pro-Rus

services, and were regarded asbeing more orless "in the pocket" of some
foreign government. Nevertheless, they were not unskilled, within the modest
expectations of an earlier age, at keeping the wheels of government lubricated,
while afew were past masters at handling overbearing foreign diplomats, with
cool urbanity, from a position of obvious weakness. But for all that, they tended
to be lacking inknowledge ofthe outside world, inconstructive managerial
skills or in the breadth of vision needed to address Iran's immediate post-war
problems. They lived and moved in what, in retrospect, can beseen as an
intermediate period between an old order which was passing, and a new one
which had yet to emerge, for the Constitutional Revolution had "destroyed the
traditional centre of despotic power without producing an adequate substitute. "4
Whatever dislocation the war had brought to Iran, the foreign occupation
had been a genuine educational experience, broadening the horizons of a
generation whose outlook, in consequence, differed rather markedly from that
of its fathers. News of the happenings in the world beyond the frontiers of Iran,
direct, ifnot always agreeable, contact with foreigners on afar more extensive
scale than had been the case before 1914, and unavoidable dealings with the
occupying forces, meant that not only the ruling elite, but even quite ordinary
Iranians acquired new perspectives and, with them, new aspirations. Without
this ferment of ideas circulating in the post-war cities, the innovative measures
introduced by Riza Shah would never have been accepted with so little oppo
sition, orhave been implemented so extensively.
Central to the Iranian world-view in the first quarter of the 20th century was
the conviction that the country was held inan inescapable vice by the rival
pressures exerted upon her by Great Britain and Russia. That Iran had not gone
the way of other Asian countries — India, forexample, or the Khanates of
Turkistan - and been formally absorbed into one or other imperial system
seemed entirely fortuitous. A few acknowledged that the survival of an indepen
dent Iran was directly due to the intense rivalry between the two Powers, which
effectively tempered the appetite of both for outright annexation, since neither
would acquiesce in a territorial or commercial gain by its rival without adequate
compensation. This, atleast, gave Iranian politicians room for manoeuvre in
playing off the greed or suspicion of one Power against the other; but to play the
game well required hostility betwreen the two rivals on a broader stage than just
the Iranian plateau. Experience had shown that what was most to be dreaded
was Anglo-Russian rapprochement. The Anglo-Russian Entente of 1907 had

clearly demonstrated this, as had Anglo-Russian collaboration during the war,
when the negotiated partition of Iran into spheres of influence in the 1907
Agreement actually became a reality. By the Constantinople Agreement of19
March 1915, Great Britain had extended her sphere of influence into the central
"neutral" zone in return for accepting full freedom of action for Russia in the
northern zone: formal bifurcation seemed only a matter of time. Iranians witha
knowledge of history and contemporary diplomacy had some grounds for
apprehension: Great Britain, together with France, was about to preside over
the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, while Russia, as the Poles knew
only too well, was not averse tothe partition ofher weaker neighbours.
This latter threat vanished with the Bolshevik Revolution and the sub
sequent Russian military collapse. It was replaced by analtogether different
danger. With the disappearance ofthe Russian presence inthe Middle East,
accompanied by an upsurge of revolutionary activity throughout the Caucasian
and Transcaspian provinces of the former Tsarist Empire, some of Great
Britain's proconsuls began to consider a grandiose scheme for an overall
reconstruction of the Middle East: from the Libyan desert to the Zagros, a chain
of British protectorates — Egypt, Palestine, Transjordan, Iraq — would form a
block of friendly clients guarding the overland route to India. The one weak link
was Iran, with her hundreds of miles of frontier with the Soviet Union. But with
Russia no longer a factor in the equation, Lord Curzon's dream of establishinga
protectorate over Iran, serving British interests while bringing stability and the
opportunity forinternal reform, suddenly became practical politics. In the
words of his biographer: "Always he had dreamt of creating a chain of vassal
states stretching from the Mediterranean to the Pamirs and protecting, not the
Indian frontiers merely, but our communications with our further Empire."5It
seemed as if the dream was about tobe realized.
It was in this spirit that the Anglo-Iranian Agreement was drawn up in
London in 1919. Itincluded provision for the secondment of British officers to
Iranian military units, toassist inthe modernization ofthe army, and for the
supply of military equipment; the despatch of British advisers for the overhaul
ing of the civil administration, in particular the finances; tariff reform;the
development of a modern system of communications; and a British loan to cover
at least part of the cost of these measures. All that was needed was the assent of
the Iranians. The British minister in Tehran, Sir Percy Cox, was instructed to

obtain this. What was wholly unappreciated inLondon was that the eventsof
the past two decades hadeffectively destroyed whatever credibility Great
Britain had once enjoyed in Iran. On the contrary, hostility towards her wasnow
being expressed with an intensity reflecting the fervour of the new, xenophobic
nationalism, which had hitherto passed unnoticed by British officials in the
Middle East, accustomed tothe old, easy pre-war world ofthe Victorian and
Edwardian PaxBritannica.
Yet Curzon and hisadvisers may be forgiven for misreading thesigns.
Ostensibly, the British position in Iran looked strong. The third Majlis, elected
in 1914,had been dismissed in 1915 by the advancing Russians, who had always
been hostile towards the Constitution of1906and preferred to deal directly with
the cabinet. Its rump, intensely nationalistic, anti-Russian and pro-German, had
formed aprovisional government inQum but had then been forced to retreat,
first toKirmanshah and then into exile. Thus, throughout the duration of the
war, the Russians and the British had dealt onanad hocbasis with ministers
appointed bythe Shah, while forallpractical purposes the Constitution had
temporarily lapsed. With the Russian presence in Tehran withdrawn as a result
of the revolutionary turmoil in Russia itself, British influence was now at its
height with the emergence, in 1918, of a new government, apparently pro
British, liberally subsidized by the British legation, and headed by the shrewd
and urbane Vusuq al-Daula. The new prime minister's position was far from
enviable. He was neither unintelligent nor lacking in ability but he was, like so
many Iranian statesmen during thepast hundred years, an individual with
colleagues and clients but no institutionalized power-base.6 Hewas fiercely
criticized as a lackey of the British, but hehad few options open to him.In
Tehran, the British were the only foreigners who counted, while outside the
capital the presence of British military units, together with the South Persia
Rifles, was a reminder that threats could, ifnecessary, be backed by a showof
force. Abroad, the Iranian delegation sent to the Versailles Peace Conference to
claim a seat andto air grievances was, under pressure from the British,
ignominiously denied a hearing.7 In these circumstances, itmust have seemed to
Vusuq and his colleagues in the Cabinet that there was no practical alternativeto
accepting the Agreement.
6 Nicolson found himimpressive nonetheless: "Vossuq-ed-Dowleh . . . was. . . a realist. Upstanding, handsome and reserved, hecombined the traditional distinction ofhis race with that polish which Vevey and Montreux can add to theculture of Iran." Nicolson, op. cit., p. 136. 7 Ibid, pp. 134-1 36.

However, the Iranian Constitution required all foreign treaties to be ratified
by the Majlis. For this to be done, the terms of the treaty had to be made public. It
is not impossible that the Vusuq cabinet, for all its apparent willingness to work
with the British, fully anticipated that the treaty would begiven a hostile
reception throughout the country. Certainly, once its contents were made public
in August 1919, the outcry was immediate and vociferous. Inany case, there
could be no ratification without aparliament, so elections for the fourth Majlis
were set in motion. The British, for their part, proceeded as ifthe ratification
were a foregone conclusion. Sydney Armitage-Smith and his assistants began to
reorganize the finances. General Dickinson and Lieutenant-Colonel William
Fraser embarked upon the modernization of the armed forces. Stretches of a
proposed Tehran—Baghdad railway were surveyed, and the Iranian Finance
Minister was invited to London to negotiate the terms ofthe British loan.
Hardly anyone on the British side seems tohave foreseen the public outcry
which the terms of the treaty evoked in the press and among the general public,
to be followed by formal protests from France, the Soviet Union and the United
States, anxious over what appeared tobe the imminent closing ofthe "open
door" for trade with Iran. Meanwhile, inside Iran, the protests only grew louder
with the passage of time, highlighted by the dramatic discovery of the dead body
of Lieutenant-Colonel Fazl-Allah Khan of the mixed military commission, with
a suicide-note stating that, as a patriot, he could no longer condonethe
subjection of the Iranian armed forces tothe interests of British imperialism.
The growing criticism of the government was not, however, solely due to the
treaty, but was an expression of broad-based disillusion with the general
mismanagement of the country, and of economic and other grievances. The end
of the war had brought little or no respite from endemic shortages, lawlessness
in the countryside, and large-scale official corruption. By April 1920, Shaikh
Muhammad KhiyabanI and his Democrats were in control of Tabriz and much
of Azarbaljan, renamed Azadistan. A patriot and man of wide learning,
KhiyabanI found it impossible to accept the legitimacy of Vusuq's government,
apparently bent upon sacrificing the country to the British. The same was true of
Mirza Kuchik Khan inGilan, of whom one historian has written, "A Shi'ite
Muslim and an unyielding patriot, Kuchik was an indefatigable fighter and an
incorruptible leader whose sole ambition was to rid the country of foreign
imperial domination and domestic administrative corruption."8 Another has

described him as "deeply religious and athorough-going Iranian nationalist'.9
Mirza Kuchik Khan's Jangali (Forest) Movement first surfaced in Gllan in
1917 and embodied, along with aRobin-Hood-style reputation for robbing the
rich and giving to the poor, the nationalist and revolutionary ideals of the
constitutional period, vigorously pursued in a rebellion which the central
government long proved incapable of suppressing. For a while, the Jangalis lost
ground to British and Tsarist Russian units but, by the beginning of1920, they
had again seized the initiative, supported by Red Army troops which had landed
in Anzali to counter British intervention inthe Caucasus. That June, Mirza
Kuchik Khan reluctantly acquiesced in the proclamation of a Soviet Republic of
Gllan.
Amid growing confusion, Vusuq al-Daula resigned on 24 July 1920. The
Shah replaced him with the experienced Mushir al-Daula, who promptly sent
the Persian Cossack Brigade to put down the Azadistan movement in Tabriz,
which it did, although itfailed to follow up with acomparable success against
the Jangalis. The new prime minister, sensing that the Majlis would never ratify
the Anglo-Iranian Agreement, announced that he would not submit the text of
the treaty to the Majlis so long as British troops remained on Iranian soil. He
probably believed that this would help mollify public opinion, but in any case he
may have already decided that the treaty was a dead letter. At the same time, and
indicative of current feeling, he responded positively to a Soviet request for a
new treaty between the two countries. The terms ofthis agreement, asthey
became known, were regarded as highly favourable to Iran, abrogating former
Tsarist treaties, concessions and loan repayment claims. Only theCaspian
fisheries remained in Russian hands. The contrast with the proposed Anglo
Iranian Treaty could hardly have been more striking. A shuffling of cabinet
posts now resulted in the removal of Mushir al-Daula from the premiership and
his replacement by Sardar-i Sipah Fath-Allah Khan. The latter then announced
that, just as his predecessor had postponed the ratification ofthe treaty with
Great Britain until the departure of all British troops, so ratification of the treaty
with the Soviet Union would require the same precondition.10
These prevarications, however, were brought to an abrupt halt when, on the
night of 21 February 1921, between three and four thousand troops of the
Cossack Brigade, led by the forty-two-year-old Colonel Riza Khan, marched
from Qazvln to Tehran and executed abloodless coup d'etat without encounter
ing any significant resistance. The leader of the conspiracy which had triggered

off the coupwas an Anglophile journalist, Sayyid Ziya al-DIn Tabataba°I, whom
the Shah was now compelled toappoint prime minister.11 The man of the hour,
however, was Colonel Riza Khan, who was made Sardar-i Sipah (Army Com
mander). Born in thelate 1870s in thevillage of Alasht in theSavad Kuh of
Mazandaran, Riza Khan joined the Cossack Brigade and rose rapidly through
the ranks by reason of his intelligence, competence and determination to
succeed. All this he had achieved under the command ofRussian officers, from
whom he hadlearnt much without, however, modifying his resentment of
foreign tutelage.12 In 1921, his abilities as a leader were unknown outside
military circles, but his personality, devious and inscrutable, was fully formed
and bore themark of ruthless ambition, sustained by a harsh, inflexible will.
Thereafter, he rose rapidly from colonel to general, from Minister of War to
Commander-in-Chief, rendering himself so indispensable that no government
could survive without his support.
Students of Iranian affairs have long pondered on the ease with whichthe
coupof 1921 was carried out. From the outset, many Iranians believed that the
British were behind it, an instinctive explanation of anything out of the ordinary
which happened in the country. During the Pahlavi period, the voicing of such a
suspicion was unthinkable, since Riza Khan's rise to power had acquired the
aura of heroic legend. The British, for their part, denied any involvement.
Recently, however, the publication of the diaries ofField-Marshall Sir Edmund
Ironside has revealed a British connection.13 Asone historian has put it,
In retrospect it is clear that thecoup was intended as thealternative route to the achievement of the spirit of the 1919 Agreement - that is, apolitical stabilization in Iran which would not pose a threat to the main local regional interests of the British Empire.It is equally clear that Britain was somehow involved in theconception of the coup, although itis improbable that the British Foreign Office itself conceived the idea. The full facts ofthe matter are not yet known; but it iscertain that the commander ofthe local British forces, General Ironside, was directly involved in the conception and execution of
11 Sayyid Ziya al-DIn TabatabaT (c. 1889—1969) was the son ofa conservative religious leader, and passed his early years in Yazd and Shlraz. Journalist and politician, heserved briefly as prime minister in 1921. He was inexile inSwitzerland, 1921-30, and inPalestine, 1931-43. Elected to the Majlis in 1944, hewas imprisoned byQavam in 1946 toappease the Russians. "During the last20 years ofhis life, heremained inhis village of Saadatabad, near Tehran. Although these years were spent on the sidelines of Iranian politics, he met with the Shah of Iran weekly until the Seyyid's death. He served as an effective and sensitive intermediary and political broker between the Iranian masses and themonarch." James A. Bill, Concise Encyclopaedia of the Middle East, p. 331.
12 It isa curious fact that the only effective military units inIran down tothis time were officered by foreigners: the Persian Cossack Brigade, established by Nasir al-DIn Shah in 1879, by Russians; the Gendarmerie, set upin 1911, by Swedes; and, asa wartime exigency, the South Persian Rifles, raised in 1916, by Britons.

the coup. According toboth written and spoken memoirs, there were at first other civilian and military nominees for the leadership of the coup than those who finally led it; many are said to have turned down the suggestion. At any rate, it is certain that Reza Khan had been hand-picked by Ironside who was impressed by the man's personal and martial qualities.14
It ispossible that the British had come torecognize by early 1921 that the
proposed Anglo-Iranian Treaty was impracticable, and that the negotiations for
a new treaty with the Soviet Union showed that the Iranians were still playing
one Power off against the other, although now in rather more favourable
circumstances. They may have viewed Riza Khan and his associates as likelyto
prove more dependable than the old-style politicians. But if it was the British
who set Riza Khan on the road to supreme power, itis certain that he never felt
the slightest gratitude towards his surreptitious patrons.
The Tabataba°I government setto work with considerable alacrity. The
treaty with the Soviet Union was ratified almost immediately, while the pro
posed treaty with Great Britain was cancelled on thegrounds of its non
ratification. The relics of the incipient British "protectorate" were swiftly swept
away. The British military and financial advisers were dismissed, and the South
Persia Rifles, raised in 1916 with headquarters in Kirman, were formally
disbanded, the British government declining to transfer the force to Iranian
officers or leave behind its equipment and supplies. Meanwhile, protests against
those pillars of "informal empire", the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Impe
rial Bank ofIran, and the Indo-European Telegraph Company, became more
virulent. Xenophobia served to unite virtually allIranians behind the new
regime, the British being the obvious targets. InApril 1921, a Soviet ambassa
dor arrived in Tehran to implement the newly signed treaty, while the last
Russian troops were withdrawn from GTlan. Whatever the former affiliations of
Sayyid Ziya al-DIn or the nature of the assistance rendered to Riza Khan atthe
time ofthe coup, it looked asif the government was leaning very deliberately
towards Russia and away from Great Britain.
Sayyid Ziya al-DIn had drawn up an ambitious and wide-ranging scheme of
reform for the country, but he was determined toprecede its implementation
with the prosecution of many politicians and officials of the old regime, whom
he accused of corruption and misappropriation of government funds. The result
was that powerful enemies rallied against him and by May 1921 he had been
ousted from the premiership and driven into exile. He was replaced by a younger

brother of Vusuq al-Daula, Qavam al-Saltana, whowasto become one of the
ablest Iranian statesmen of the 20th century. Qavam, eager to reduce therole of
the British and the Russians in the life of the country, immediately began
exploratory talks with theUnited States government and American oil compan
ies, presumably with theapproval of Riza Khan. Negotiations were begun with
the Sinclair Oil Company and in 1922 A.C. Millspaugh was appointed Adminis
trator-General of Finances.
Riza Khan's reward for hispart in theelimination of Sayyid Ziya al-Dinwas
the post of Minister of War which, combined later with that of Commander-in
Chief, placed him in an unchallengeable position from which to establish a
dictatorship. Thus, thecivilian politicians unwittingly prepared theground for
their eventual downfall. During the five years between Riza Khan's appoint
ment as Minister of War in May 1921 andhiscoronation as Riza Shah in April
1926, he initiated and carried through a reorganization of the security forces
without which the Pahlavl despotism and its concomitant programme of
"pseudo-modernization" would scarcely have been possible.15 Recognized by
the general public asthemoving force behind thecoup of 1921 andasthe creator
of the newarmy, Riza Khan wascoming to be regarded as theembodiment of
that spirit of national pride andself-assertiveness characteristic of the post-war
generation.
From the first, heunderstood the importance ofoccupying centre-stage.The
central government was still threatened bysecessionist or potentially secession
ist movements, and by tribal leaders and local communities bent upon
reasserting a traditional autonomy. These presented the obvious targets fora
man whose ambitions were inextricably linked with thepower andprestige of
the armed services. Thus, having expanded and improved the righting quality of
the Cossack Brigade, helaunched a series of "police-actions" which gave himall
the visibility he required andseta distance between himself, theman of action,
and the politicians in the capital. First, he eliminated the dissident movements
which hadsurfaced in Tabriz and Mashhad. Next, hemarched onGilan to crush
the Jangalis, nowdeprived of Soviet support. Then, he turned hisattention to
Simko and the rebellious Kurds.
While Riza Khan's troops were participating in these vaunted, if rather
minor, campaigns, his reorganization of the security forces was proceeding
rapidly. The 12,000 men of the Gendarmerie were merged with the 7,000
Cossacks, and the foreign officers ofthe former were replaced byIranian officers

from the Cossack Brigade, inmany instances, old cronies. Anew army, 40,000
strong, was recruited, trained and disciplined under his personal supervision,
and it began to acquire an esprit de corpshitherto rare among Iranian fighting
men. Riza Khan knew from the start that he had tobe assured ofregular funds.
He acquired these early in the premiership of Qavam by compelling the Ministry
of Finance totransfer revenues from the public domain tothe Ministry ofWar,
to which wasadded income from indirect taxation, an arrangement which
continued until Millspaugh completed his reorganization ofthe state finances.
With regular pay, improved equipment, and rising morale, the army gave him its
unqualified loyalty. No less important, Riza Khan was surrounding himself with
a core ofdevoted officers whom hecould rely upon tocarry out his orders and
who, in return, were offered ample scope forambition and self-advancement.
Although it was improbable that the Iranian army would be engaged in
hostilities with any external foes inthe foreseeable future, campaigns on Iranian
soil continued to provide experience in the field and to boost morale. In 1922,
the army was employed in Azarbaljan and Fars; in 1923, inKirmanshah; in1924,
in Baluchistan and Luristan; and in 1925, inMazandaran and Khurasan.16 Less
strenuous but more widely publicized than anyof these campaigns was the
occupation ofKhuzistan in 1924, and the overthrow of its ruler, Shaikh Khazcal
of Muhammara. Shaikh Khazcal seems to have regarded himself as virtually
independent, secure inthe favour of the British, towhom he had been extremely
useful in the recent war. Heundoubtedly suffered from folie de grandeur\ which
manifested itself principally in reluctance to pay taxes to the central government,
reflecting both his contempt for the latter and the physical distance of
Muhammara from Tehran. He had allegedly discussed secession with disgrun
tled Lur and Bakhtiyari tribal leaders and with agents from Iraq. Tehran
threatened himfrom time to time, but the Shaikh seemed unassailable. His
British friends warned the Iranian government not todisturb the status quo,and
even moved warships up the Gulf.
Here was asituation which provided Riza Khan with asplendid opportunity
to actin a manner which could notfail to win him theapprobation of most
Iranians, towhom the Shaikh, anArab, appeared nothing more than apawnof
the British. Inthe autumn of 1924, therefore, army units were despatched tothe
south-west, to bejoined byRiza Khan inperson shortly afterwards. Whatever
resistance had been anticipated onthe part of the Shaikh failed to materialize,
and the British made no move to assist their protege. Riza Khan made a

triumphant entry into Muhammara in November before returning to a hero's
welcome inthe capital. By this time, however, important changes had taken
place inTehran. Over a year earlier, on28 October 1923, Ahmad Shah had
appointed Riza Khan Prime Minister, while permitting him to retain the post of
Minister of War. A few days later, the Shah left for Europe, never to return. Riza
Khan was now defacto ruler of the country, but he continued to tread cautiously,
working within the cabinet and parliamentary system established by law. This
was not always easy. The closing session of the fourth Majlis brought into the
open a serious conflict ofpurpose between the Prime Minister and the more
conservative deputies. Riza Khan wanted to have a bill passed to establish
mandatory national service for two years. This proposal was strongly opposed
by the landlords, since such a measure would reduce their work force, and
weaken the traditional dependency ofcultivators inlandlord-owned villages
towards their "aghas". The Qulama objected equally strongly, fearing a measure
which would expose the entire male population toa way of life and an ethos
essentially foreign, Western and secular.
This confrontation led Riza Khan to turn to new allies in the opening session
of the fifth Majlis, to the Revival Party {Hif^b-iTajaddud),from which he would
recruit two future cabinet ministers, cAli Akbar Davar and Abd al-Husain
TTmurtash, and to the Socialist Party (Hi^b-i Sostatist). This fifth Majlis, which
assembled in January 1923, initiated aseries of measures which set the stage for
the subsequent centralizing programmes of the two Pahlavl rulers. The bill for
compulsory military service was passed. A money bill granted tax revenues from
tea and sugar as well as an income tax for the construction of a projected Trans
Iranian railway. Weights and measures were made uniform throughout the
country. The pre-Islamic calendar was resuscitated. Birth certificates were
introduced and everyone was required to adopt aEuropean-style family name,
Riza Khan choosing that ofPahlavT, redolent ofthe glories ofancient, pre
Islamic Iran. Qajar titles ofnobility were abolished. And the prime minister
became inname what he had long been infact: Commander-in-Chief.
During the early part of 1924, an apparently spontaneous movement arose to
declare Iran a republic. The atmosphere was one of change and promise, and
many patriots, particularly among the young, were stirred bythe senseof
direction which Riza Khan's leadership had given the country. The rule of the
Qajar dynasty was thoroughly discredited, while across the border, Turkey had
recently proclaimed a republic. Why, a vocal minority demanded, should not
Iran follow suit? But Turkey's venture into republicanism was soon followed by
the introduction of secularizing measures which disturbed many observersin

Iran, especially among the culama, for whom republicanism thereafter became
identified with Ataturk's anti-Islamic programme. Riza Khan may have at first
welcomed attacks upon the Qajar dynasty but he seems tohave been quick to
sense the potential divisiveness ofthe issue. In April he made plain his oppo
sition topublic debate onthe subject: he had decided that he did not want to
follow Ataturk's path. At the same time, he did not wish tocontinue as prime
minister of an absentee Shah, who could, at least in theory, return at any time and
dismiss him. With characteristic deviousness, he offered his resignation to both
the Majlis and thearmy. Consternation followed thenews of his intended
withdrawal from public life. Reluctantly, asit seemed, he bowed tothe callof
duty, and returned to take upthe premiership again, stronger now than ever
before.17
It is likely that he was already intent upon obtaining the throne. For awhile,
the idea of a life presidency may have appealed to him, but the opposition of the
culama to republicanism probably settled that issue. The traditional aura at
tached to the persona of the Shahanshah, although much dimmed in recent times,
could again become a potent weapon in the armoury of an energetic leader.
Moreover, his greed toenrich himself and a large family could be more easily
satisfied asa hereditary monarch than a First Citizen.
In the opening weeks of 1925, Riza Khan's personal prestige, further
enhanced by his recent campaigning in Khuzistan, soared higher still. In
February, the Majlis further increased his authority, and when, later in the year,
rumours began to circulate that the Shah intended to return from Europe, a
well-orchestrated campaign of abuse and vituperation was launched against the
royal family. On 31 October 1925, the Majlis voted (80 in favour, 5against, with
30 abstentions) todepose the Qajar dynasty and toreconvene as a Constituent
Assembly. Inthe interim, Riza Khan was to act as Head ofState. Finally, on12
December 1925, the Majlis, sitting as a Constituent Assembly, voted almost
unanimously to invest Riza Khan and his heirs with the crown. Descendants of
the old dynasty were to be specifically excluded from the succession or from any
future regency council. On 15 December, Riza Shah, as he was henceforth to be
known, took the oath of allegiance to uphold the Fundamental Laws of the
Constitution, tosupport the Shici faith, and topreserve the independence and
territorial integrity ofthe country. On the following day, he formally received
the heads of missions accredited to the government, and on the 19th appointed

In April 1926, the British author, Vita Sackville-West, visiting Tehran, found
herself invited toRiza Shah's coronation. She wrote: "In appearance Reza was
an alarming man, sixfeet three in height, with a sullen manner, a huge nose,
grizzled hair anda brutal jowl; he looked, in fact, what he was, a Cossack
trooper; but there was no denying that he had akingly presence. Looking back,
it seemed that he had risen in an amazingly short time from obscurity to his
present position. . . . norhad he any rival in thethelaxlimp nation he had
mastered."19 A former German envoy, remembering the Shah years later,
recalled the unfathomable eyes and the head of a bird of prey. Strength, energy,
brutality, cunning andmalice were thewords which immediately sprang to
mind.20 Yet if the man himself inspired fear and respect rather than affection,
there existed a widespread feeling that under him the country wasat last
beginning tomove forward. Ina decade marked by the rise ofsuch dictatorsas
Ataturk, Mussolini, Primo deRivera, Pilsudski and Horthy, the climb ofRiza
Shah tosupreme power seemed toreflect a common enough pattern inthe rest
of the world. He was also, beyond any doubt, thepersonification of certain
distinct aspects ofthe "new" Iran, brash, insensitive and impatient forresults.
Even without him, Iran would surely have experienced many changes in the two
decades between the World Wars, but without such ataskmaster the pace would
have been slower and theoutcome rather different.
Riza Shah's achievement in the years between 1925and 1941 was the
substantial fulfilment of goals already set during his years as Minister of War and
prime minister: thecreation of a modern army andpolice force to maintain
internal security; the elimination of all opposition to his will; amodern system of
communications; industrial development to reduce dependence upon foreign
suppliers; and asfaraspossible, the elimination of outside interference in the
country's internal affairs. Bent upon presenting a modern image of a
quintessentially traditional society, intolerant of opposition or dissent, it was
inevitable that he would view Iran's still extensive tribal population with
enmity. Riza Shah's treatment of the tribes was both vindictive and unnecessary,
but their violent pacification, besides further testing the mettle of his troops,
18 Of the new order, Harold Nicolson caustically wrote: "This bullet-headed man, with the voice of an asthmatic child, now controls the destinies of Iran. . . .Isitfor good or for bad? .. .What has she gained? There is no liberty in Persia today - there is fear, corruption, dishonesty anddisease."

affirmed both his absolute mastery ofall his subjects, and his commitment to
modernity. The major tribes suffered most, although they regained some
ground in the years following his removal, but with the independent spirit of
their leaders broken and their followers defeated bysuperior weapons and
tactics, tribal Iran ceased to have much political significance. At the same time,
the loss of livestock and neglect of the potential for improved animal husbandry,
in acountry so suited to pastoralism, which resulted from Riza Shah's persecu
tion of the tribes, were scarcely less costly in economic terms than they were in
terms of human suffering. There is, however, no reason to suppose that any such
considerations counted for much in Riza Shah's calculations.
At first, he moved cautiously. The larger tribes were well-armed with
weapons acquired from the various European or European-officered units
which had been operating inIran during the First World War. Moreover,he
knew that it would take time totrain regular units toface tough, mobile and
enterprising opponents. Initially, therefore, he chose to play off one tribe against
another, but once he felt sufficiently confident of his own troops, he subjected
the tribal territories, one by one, to taxation and conscription, undertaken with
characteristic brutality and corruption. Unaccustomed to such levies, the tribes
found the government's fiscal demands acrushing burden, while the conscrip
tion of their young men seriously weakened their manpower, thereby reducing
their ability to oppose further government encroachments. Hence, they resisted,
only to be savagely punished by army units which then remained to implement
the policy of forcible settlement, which was enforced with predictable incompe
tence and violence. For the nomads, sedentarization invariably entailed loss of
livestock, areduction in the food-supply and standard of living, disease, higher
mortality, loss of freedom, and exploitation byboth the military and local
government officials. For some tribes, only the abdication of Riza Shah in 1941
saved them from extinction.
While the outlines of Riza Shah's policies towards the tribes are well-known,
the fate of two of the most important, the Bakhtiyari and the Qashqa°i, deserve
special mention. In the case of the former, the Shah moved warily, his intentions
concealed by the confidence which he seemed todisplay towards the leading
Bakhtiyari Khan, Sardar Ascad, whom hetreated as a trusted collaborator,
appointing him first, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, and afterwards, Minister
of War. All the time, however, he was plotting the downfall ofthe tribe. He
knew that the Bakhtiyaris had long been a formidable element in national
politics: he was familiar with the prominent role played during the
constitutional period and with the rumours of a possible Bakhtiyari seizure of

the throne in 1912. As early as June 1922, what appears to have been a contrived
clash between some Bakhtiyaris and government troops was made the pretext
for levying a heavy indemnity upon the tribe. ^ 1 9 2 3 , the Bakhtiyari khans were
forbidden to maintain armed retainers. In1928, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company
was ordered to desist from leasing lands direct from the Bakhtiyaris, but to apply
through the governor of Khuzistan. In1929, the year of the great uprising of the
tribes of Fars, arevolt among the Bakhtiyaris was triggered by the highhanded
ness of government agents. This led to the execution of three khans. In1933, the
offices of ilkhani and ilbegi were abolished. In 1934, three khans were imprisoned
and presumably executed, Sardar Ascad dying under mysterious circumstances
not long after his arrest. Finally, in 1936, the Bakhtiyari country was divided into
two administrative units, one under the jurisdiction of the governor of
Khuzistan, and the other under that of the governor of Isfahan. In this way,
slowly but inexorably, the most prominent and strategically-placed of all the
tribes was "pacified".21
The Qashqa°Is put up a more determined resistance, giving the government
considerable trouble. Accordingly, they suffered even more than the
Bakhtiyaris. It began early in thereign when theQashqa°I Ilkhan, Saulat al
Daula, and his eldest son, Nasir Khan, were spirited away toTehran, atfirst in
the guise of Majlis deputies (1926), but later as virtual prisoners. With the leaders
out ofthe way, the policy ofdisarming the Qashqa°Is could begin, undertaken
with the ferocity ofa dragonnade. The fiscal exactions, the relentless conscrip
tion and thetyrannical conduct of those who carried outthe government's
policies provoked a desperate resistance. In the spring of 1929, the Qashqa°is
rebelled en masse, soon to be joined by theequally battered andbitter Boir
Ahmadls, Mamassanis and Khamsas, although for the time being the
Bakhtiyaris remained quiet. The demands of all the tribes were more or less
identical: an end to disarming and conscription, a reduction of taxation,the
restoration of their former autonomy and the reinstatement of their khans.
During the first weeks of the uprising, the government was caught
unprepared. The Qashqa°Is quickly captured a number ofgendarmerie posts,
penetrated the environs ofShlraz tothe point of occupying the airport, and cut
communications on the Shlraz—Bushire and Shlraz—Abada roads. As the revolt
spread, theMamassanis and Boir Ahmadls went into action, and there were
some scattered risings inthe Bakhtiyari country. InTehran, there was fear that
the unrest would spread to the cities, where the culama were thought to have

been alienated byvarious government-sponsored innovations. Isfahan, in par
ticular, wasviewed as a potential trouble-spot. Characteristically, Riza Shah
played fortime. Until the military situation improved, a degree of compromise
was shown by thegovernment, since it was appreciated that some insurgents
would settle for promises of a general amnesty and redress of grievances.
Accordingly, Sardar Ascad was sent tothe Bakhtiyaris, and Saulat al-Daula and
Nasir Khan to Shiraz to mediate. Meanwhile, themilitary situation gradually
shifted in favour ofthe government. In the recent past, the tribesmen, mobile,
resourceful andthoroughly familiar with theterrain, hadproved formidable
foes to inadequately trained and undisciplined government forces. But Riza
Shah's reforms were now beginning to prove their worth, demonstrated in the
army's superior fire-power and the ability of local commanders, after the
confusion of the first few weeks of the revolt, to take the initiative. The
construction ofa network ofstrategic roads rendered tribal fastnesses nolonger
impregnable, while automatic weapons, armoured cars and observation-planes
tilted thebalance against traditional modes of tribal warfare.
By the end ofAugust 1929, the Qashqa°i revolt was over. During the winter
months thearmy pursued and punished theKhamsas and the Baharlus; in the
following year, itwas the turn of the Mamassanis and the Boir Ahmadls. Finally,
in 1932, the Qashqa°is, exasperated by the government's unwillingness to live up
to the 1929 agreements, revolted again, but the army was ready now, and
punishment was swift andmerciless. Little will to resist remained among the
tribes. "During the last nine years of the reign", writes the historian of the
Qashqa°Is, "Reza Shah had most of the tribal leaders of Persia executed or
exiled."22
The miseries inflicted upon thetribes by Riza Shah have often been over
looked in thegeneral approbation of his reforms by western writers. What, in
reality, enforced settlement involved is vividly conveyed in the following
passage written by onewhowaswell-acquainted with the Qashqa°is in the
period immediately following their ordeal under Riza Shah.
Qashqai intransigence led tothe adoption against them ofincreasingly severe measures and toaspeeding up ofthe policy ofenforced settlement. . . . the means by which it was achieved were barbarous, ruthless, and short-sighted, and ...made little provision for the momentous change-over from apastoral to an agricultural economy....

insidious undermining of their health, with a consequent steep rise in their infant mortality. Refuse . . . rotted in the villages, polluting the springs and spreading typhoid and dysentery; while trachoma of the eyes played havoc with their sight. . . pneumonia, tuberculosis and other pulmonary infections flourished, snatching their heavy toll of life. . . . There is no doubt that Reza Shah's instructions were often exceeded by his depraved officials, whose principle aim, with very few exceptions, was toexploit the situation to their own financial gain and sadistic satisfaction.23
There is hardly a blacker page in the history of Pahlavi Iran than the
persecution to which the tribal population wassubjected by Riza Shah's
myrmidons. More positive aspects of the period were the construction of roads,
railway-lines and port facilities, thebeginnings of industrialization, and the
introduction of European-style legal and educational systems. These develop
ments, together with the changes which went with them, affected virtually all
segments ofsociety: most conspicuously, the emerging Western-educated elite,
the traditionally-educated culama, women and the minorities.
Because Iran lacked capitalists prepared toaccept the high risks of"develop
ment" investment, itwas clear that, as inTurkey, the state would be required to
take the lead increating a modern infrastructure. Inany case, etatisme naturally
appealed to aman of Riza Shah's temperament: itwas to be acardinal principle of
government throughout the entire Pahlavi period that much of the impetus for
development, together with control ofkey organizations and industries, should
be in the hands of the state. The transport system inevitably attracted immediate
attention. There were virtually no metalled roads atthe time ofRiza Shah's rise
to power, the lack ofwhich impeded his plans for improving internal security,
since it was impossible to move troops about thecountry speedily. A high
priority of the new regime, therefore, was a programme of road-building, in
which foreign companies were invited to assist in surveying and constructing
highways tolink major cities and toreach the hitherto inaccessible hinterlands.
Once these were built, motor-transport soon established itself as the main form
of communication across the country. The long-distance lorry became ubiqui
tous oneven the most remote byways, with the picturesque caravanserai of a
former age giving way to thebus-station and goods-depot.
Iran almost missed the railway age, for during the era of European-financed
railway construction, Iran slumbered under the rule of the Qajars, neither Russia
nor Great Britain being prepared totolerate the other using railway-building as
a means to penetrate the country. Riza Shah, however, was free to plan a railway
system without reference to the interests of either Power, although both

benefitted from this development, and during the Second World War the Trans
Iranian railway provided avital lifeline to Russia for Allied war-materials. Riza
Shah pushed ahead with this spectacular feat ofengineering, the line which
linked the Persian Gulf to Tehran, later to beextended from the capital to
Tabriz, Mashhad and the Caspian coast. Its construction was approved by the
Majlis in early 1926, and itwas completed by 1938. Numerous foreign compan
ies supplied technology, personnel and materials, but while the general public
was heavily taxed to pay for it, no foreign loans had to be negotiated. Despite the
subsequent criticism levelled against the project, it enormously facilitated the
importation of heavy manufactured goods as well as the export of agricultural
produce, while its construction and maintenance brought into being an indig
enous labour-force possessing new and valuable skills.
By the end of Riza Shah's reign, private industrial undertakings such as
sugar-refineries and textile-mills were to be found in anumber of major urban
centres, but the most characteristic forms ofindustrialization were the state
monopolies, such as tobacco factories, cement works and power plants. Infra
structure industries had only a very limited appeal for the private sector. The aim
of the new class of entrepreneurs was to reap quick, high and safe profits,
without much regard foraugmenting sales by price-cutting or competition.
They preferred non-competitive monopolies which they could exploit tothe
maximum. Labour conditions were generally bad and there was little or no
concern to replace plant ortoplough back profits with a view to long-term
capital investment. Such attitudes remained conspicuously characteristic.
The growth of a skilled and semi-skilled labour-force concentrated in a few
urban centres posed new problems for agovernment which thought of its role
largely in terms of licences, controls, and regulatory legislation, administered by
an ever-expanding army of bureaucrats intent upon extending government
intervention on any pretext as a means to enhancing their own importance. Riza
Shah's rule was aregime of inspectors and regulators quite as much as itwasa
regime of policemen and informers. The amelioration of working conditions,
and welfare issues in general, lay for the most part outside its range of concerns.
Within the administrative hierarchy, the extent of corruption was believed to be
considerable and it was generally assumed that this extended tothe highest
levels.
Apart from the unprecedented expansion ofgovernmental activity in the
Riza Shah period, the growth of the civil service and of those directly employed
by government was due to two further developments. Partly in order to appease
foreign governments which demanded that their citizens not be subjected to

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: RIZA SHAH, 1921 —41
traditional Iranian forms of justice, partly to weaken the power of the culama and
thereby to reinforce thesecularizing goals of the regime, and partly because it
would be evidence of Iran's progress towards modernity, Riza Shah determined
to introduce a European-style legal system to replace the Shanca courts. In
consequence, commercial and criminal codes were promulgated in 1925 and a
civil code in 1926, for which the inspiration was derived selectively from France,
Belgium, Switzerland and Italy. A Ministry of Justice was created in 1927 and
CA1IAkbar Davar, agraduate ofthe University ofGeneva and one ofthe Shah's
ablest and most intelligent modernizers, began the task of shaping a lay
judiciary. With the founding ofa faculty of law atthe new University ofTehran,
French and Italian professors were engaged toprovide legal training. Evenso,
many members of the legal profession preferred to receive their education in
Europe.
Riza Shah's regime also established the framework of a European-style
educational system, although it long remained under-funded, sothat education
continued to be, forthe most part, the privilege ofthe wealthy and ofthe new
middle and professional classes. Nevertheless, there were more literate Iranians
in 1941 than in 1921, while very many were sufficiently educated to respond to
the growing demands andopportunities of a rapidly changing society. Most
important of all, in founding the University of Tehran in 1935, Riza Shah
provided themeans for thegrowth of an indigenously educated Westernized
elite and of an increasingly articulate intelligentsia, despite the fact that an
education abroad remained the goal of almost allIranians who could afford it.
Between 1921 and 1941, thesocial structure of Iran changed dramatically,
with new occupations, new jobs and the migration ofworkers tonew locations
eroding long-established patterns of living. Most striking of all was the
phenomenon of rapid urbanization, as thesurplus population of the villages
began to move to the cities, responding to rumours of opportunities for an
improved way oflife. Tehran, inparticular, saw the beginnings of that phenom
enal growth which became virtually unmanageable by the 1970s. These changes
were accompanied by atremendous amount offamilial and personal dislocation
and tension, but forthe newly emerging elites the material gains were substan
tial. The rich were undoubtedly getting richer, forunder the protective mantle
of the Shah, who grew continually more autocratic andaloof, the pampered
officer corps, the bureaucracy and the nouveau riche entrepreneurial classes
flourished exceedingly, being themain beneficiaries of Pahlavi rule.
Notwithstanding thecorruption andbrutality of his officials andsoldiers,
Riza Shah was by no means universally unpopular, despite unvoiced resentment

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: RIZA SHAH, 1921-41
in some quarters. Indeed, his strident chauvinism appealed to the mood of
quickening national self-assertion. There was awidespread feeling that the days
when Iran had been the pawn ofthe European Powers were over, and that their
ruler's forcefulness was compelling foreigners to show a new respect fora
hitherto disregarded or despised country, which nevertheless retained a pro
found awareness ofthe splendours ofits ancient past. That Riza Shah's attitude
to that heritage was inconsistent and contradictory seems to have provoked little
comment. On the one hand, his insistence in making Iran as similar as possibleto
his preconceptions ofthe states ofWestern Europe and his rejection of indig
enous tradition (exemplified by his substitution of numbered ustans for the
historic provinces and by his advocacy ofWestern dress) were indicative ofhis
contempt for the inherited past. On the other hand, there was the deliberate (and
often incongruous) identification of the new Pahlavl Iran with the glories of the
pre-Islamic Iranian empires, the short-lived move to purge the Persian language
of foreign (i.e., Arabic) accretions, the introduction ofan anachronistic calen
dar, andthe re-writing of history textbooks with a view to establishing an
unbroken continuum in thenational experience.
In dismissing therecent past, theShah and hisadvisors were intent upon
integrating an ancient pre-Islamic heritage with afuture based upon a European
model, and the generation which came ofage inhis time seemed toacquiesce in
the paradox. Old-style cultural and ethnic nationalism combined with athirst for
whatever was new and foreign. Riza Shah despised intellectuals, but he instinc
tively understood that the Western-educated products of foreign schools and
colleges, andthegraduates of his new University of Tehran, were the only
people upon whom he could rely tocarry out his modernizing programmes.As
one scholar reflected, notlong after his removal from thescene,
Riza Shah,.. .realized that he could only maintain himself in power if he conformed with the desire of the intellectuals for Westernization. . . .Consequently, Riza Shah, although he had infact established a dictatorship, intentionally preserved the outward formsof constitutional government and embarked upon a programme of Westernization and modernization. . . .By thus conforming to the temper of a potentially influential section of the population of the country Riza Shah was able to persuade the people to furnish him with such force aswas necessary to impose his will.24
In his dealings with the culama, Riza Shah, contrary towhat is often asserted,
was quite circumspect, and there is no evidence that he ever considered
launching an assault upon Islam such as Ataturk mounted in Turkey. He

preferred to ignore rather than confront the culama. On one key issue, whether
the new Iran should become arepublic, itis true that he quickly succumbed to
clerical pressure, but in so doing he also served his own and his family's material
interests. Yet the general direction of his reforms was hardly less fraught with
danger for the culama than was outright government hostility in neighbouring
Turkey. In terms of their traditional status, the culama were profoundly affected
by the reduction in their judicial, educational and philanthropic functions, the
inevitable consequence of the introduction of European-type legal and educa
tional systems, and of government supervision oiauqaf. No less significant, the
state implicitly declared its secular character by projecting typically Western
material goals; by interference inthe people's daily lives with regard tostreet
attire, the unveiling of women and female education; by the introduction of such
innovations as European-style family names and anon-Islamic calendar; and by
pronouncements and legislation which made itclear that women and members
of religious minorities were now to be regarded as full citizens of the state on an
equal footing with Muslim males. Finally, the regime brooked no opposition,
jailing critics and even suspected opponents. Members of the culama, like
everyone else, could be exiled, imprisoned, die injail inunexplained circum
stances, or simply disappear. There was no court of appeal, no means of redress.
The response of the culama to this situation was not, and could not be,
uniform or unequivocal. During the reign of Riza Shah, as during the reign of
his son, there were always quietists, who did not believe in involving themselves
in politics, as well as those who endeavoured to come to terms with the realities
of the new regime and who tried, in the tumultuous changes taking place around
them, to find some rationale orjustification within the framework ofIslamic
doctrine and epistemology. Sayyid Abul-Qasim Kashani (c. 1882-1962), the
prominent activist ayatullahofthe early 1950s, seems tohave exemplified the
ambiguous and sometimes anomalous role forced upon individual clerics by the
conflicting aims and policies of the Riza Shah regime. Arriving in Tehran from
British-occupied Iraq at the time of the 1921 coup d'etat and filled with hatred for
the British and their role in Middle Eastern politics, itwas natural for him to be
drawn towards Riza Khan the nationalist and champion ofIran's sovereign
independence. Once elected to the Constituent Assembly, presumably with the
support or approval of Riza Khan, he took an active part in the debates which
were to lead to the petition for Riza Khan to accept the crown. Later, however,
he seems to have developed doubts about the direction in which the regime was
heading and opposed some of Riza Shah's policies. He is said to have distrusted
Timurtash, for atime the Shah's close confidant and Minister of Court, andto

have objected to the 1933 agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.
Nevertheless, he managed to avoid provoking theShah. Probably, along with
other members ofthe culama, he was caught inadilemma. Some aspects ofRiza
Shah's rule must have been abhorrent to him, such astheunmistakably secular
character of the government. On the other hand, Riza Shah's anti-foreign,
especially anti-British, moves enjoyed his unqualified support.25
Some other members ofthe culama were more outspokenly critical, but paida
high price fortheir temerity. Thus, Abu^l-Hasan Talaqani (d. 1932), the father of
the prominent revolutionary leader, Ayatullah Mahmud Talaqani (d. 1979),
vigorously protested against various government measures, such asthe forcible
unveiling of women, for which he was repeatedly imprisoned or exiled to
remote parts of the country.26 Of all Riza Shah's clerical opponents, however,
the most influential andimportant wasSayyid Hasan Mudarris (d. 1937).An
eloquent nationalist, whoespoused pan-Islamic causes, he wasfirst and fore
most the embodiment of the old liberal-clerical alliance of the constitutional
period. As a charismatic politician and a gifted orator, hecame to dominatethe
fourth Majlis of 1921. Recognizing from the outset the personal ambition of
Riza Khan, fuelled by the divisions and drift in cabinet and parliament, he
sought toalert his colleagues totheir danger. It isnot surprising, therefore, that
in the debate onthefuture of the monarchy on 31 October 1925, hewas oneof
the five deputies who opposed the majority vote. Thereafter, hestood forth as a
bitter and fearless critic of the new regime. In 1929, he was arrested and
imprisoned in the remote fort of Khwaf, where he wasmurdered eight years
later.
In contrast to theculama, whose prestige and authority in the new Iran were
visibly reduced, the religious minorities who, as %immisliving under the
protection of the Sharfa, hadknown both institutionalized discriminationand
sporadic mob violence during the Qajar period, now enjoyed enhanced security
and increased opportunities for economic advancement, the result of moves
taken byRiza Shah's government to place allcitizens onanequal footing. This
was notdue to any liberal or egalitarian sentiments onthe part ofthe Shah,but
rather to a desire toplace allIranians onone level vis-a-vis the omnipotent state.
The result, however, was the amelioration of the lot of Armenian Christians,
Jews and Zoroastrians, to whom a broad range of new occupations and
professions became available. Towards Iran's ethnic minorities, however,
whether Arabs, Baluchis, Kurds, Tiirkmens or Turkl-speakers, he displayed a

consistent hostility. This reflected both his suspicion of ethnic and cultural
pluralism, which he viewed asa.threat to the unitary state, and his dreadof
dissident, potentially secessionist movements. Such groups were therefore
exposed to ruthless coercion toforce them to enter the mainstream of Iranian
society, accompanied by systematic attacks upon their cultural identities. Riza
Shah was also highly suspicious of foreign missionary organizations, regarding
mission schools and hospitals as focal points ofsinister foreign influence and
possible espionage. Both were brought increasingly under the scrutiny and
control ofthe central government.
Riza Shah's dream of a self-reliant, self-sustaining Iran called for the harness
ing of all available talent and energy to the service of the state. Thus, in
deliberately drawing both the religious minorities and women into the main
stream of national life, he was emulating already developed countries and
accentuating the image of the new Iran as a nation now wholly committed to the
ideal of modernity. He was also expanding the human potential upon which the
fulfilment of his dream ultimately depended. Riza Shah's reign will doubtless be
remembered forthe very considerable advances made byIranian women in
public life, although inevitably these were most apparent among women of the
upper and middle classes. Women experienced aneasing of the constraints
imposed upon them by traditional norms and values. They now had opportuni
ties for employment innew occupations, such as nursing, teaching and inthe
factories. The official line was that Iranian women must prepare themselvesto
meet the expectations of the new Pahlavi order. Intheir education, dress and
social activities they were urged to emulate their Western sisters, and in 193 6, the
veil was officially outlawed. However, some ofthese innovations were little
more than cosmetic. An aggressively masculine society, preoccupied with the
notion ofmachismo and family honour, was not going tochange its attitudes
towards its womenfolk overnight. In reality, Riza Shah's celebrated civil code,
in so far as it concerned women, still reflected traditional Islamic assumptions
regarding sex-roles and relations between the sexes, doing little to alleviate the
age-old juridical subjugation ofwomen to men.
All this, however, should not obscure the fact that the reign ofRiza Shah
witnessed in the improved status of women one of the most significant develop
ments in the history ofmodern Iran. The introduction ofa European-style
system of education meant female education as well as male. From the outset,
women were admitted on equal terms with men to the University of Tehran.A
new generation of educated women was thereby brought into being which was
to play an increasingly important role inthe country's economic and cultural

life. In course of time, scores of women's organizations would proliferate,
women would begin to acquire some degree of visibility in public life, and
society would come to accept, however grudgingly, thepresence of women in
the labour market.
Unlike Ataturk, Riza Shah had no first-hand knowledge of any European
country and, prior to hisenforced exile, theonly occasions onwhich hehadleft
Iran were a brief visit to Iraq anda formal state visit to Turkey.27 Yetfrom his
earliest years in themilitary he must have been acutely aware of the role which
foreigners hadplayed in shaping the destiny of his country. Born around 1878
and growing up in thenorth, he would have known about thestruggle for the
constitution, subsequent Russian intervention and the notorious Anglo-Rus
sian Agreement of 1907. He had learnt his soldiering under Russian officers, and
had lived through theinvasion andoccupation of his country during the First
World War. However intent Riza Shah might be upon the reorganization and
modernization ofIran, hecould not ignore the international dimension. Indeed,
it has been argued that thedriving force behind hismodernization programme
was his recognition of the fact that until Iran came to resemble a European
nation-state, it would not be treated like one, andwould continue to suffer the
humiliation of being a pawn of the two Powers which had more or less
controlled itsaffairs forthe past hundred years. Asbetween the two Powers,the
Soviet Union in the 1920s must have appeared theless threatening. The turmoil
inside Russia since therevolution seemed likely to continue for some timeand
possibly tolead tothe fragmentation ofthe former Russian Empire. It is unlikely
that either Riza Shah or hisadvisers anticipated theSoviet Union's tremendous
resilience and capacity for recovery. He seems initially to have felt little
apprehension of the new regime. Moreover, the publication by the Soviet
government of secret treaties andagreements negotiated by theformer Tsarist
government, and its unilateral abrogation of the hated Capitulations were
warmly welcomed in Iran as evidence of a new departure in Russo-Iranian
relations, most favourably to be compared in Tehran with Great Britain's
attitude. In the light of the problems facing thenewSoviet government, Riza
Shah might have viewed their intervention in Gilan (see p. 209 above) as being
motivated, asmuch asanything, bya need to counter thethreat from Denikin's
White Russians in theCaucasus andfrom "Dunsterforce" at Anzali.28 Thus, he
seems tohave seen nocontradiction inagreeing tothe Soviet-Iranian Friendship

Treaty of1921, while at the same time eliminating their protege in Gilan, Mirza
Kuchik Khan.
But it is possible that, during the early years, Riza Shah regarded Great
Britain as little less immobilized than the Soviet Union. The post-war world had
not proved easy for the victors. For the British, the situation in India, as in
Egypt, was highly inflammable. Iraq was proving a continuous drain upon
limited money and manpower. £annakale and the rise ofa Turkish republic
brought to anend the long-standing tradition ofBritish intervention in the
affairs of the former Ottoman Empire. British involvement with the Arab world
was increasing, but the Palestine Mandate was clearly a Pandora's Box. What
must have been viewed in Tehran as British attempts to destabilize the Soviet
Union's Muslim underbelly in Baku and Transcaspia had proved afiasco. Riza
Shah, anticipating no hostile moves from the British in the the near future, must
have sensed that the time was most opportune for the emancipation of Iran from
the tutelage of its erstwhile masters. Nor would he have failed to appreciate that
a posture of opposition towards both the Russians and the British, but especially
towards the British, would win him the respect, even ofthose who did not
otherwise support him. Under the Qajars, Iranians had been forced to live with
the humiliation of constant pressure and sporadic threats from the representa
tives of the two Powers. A xenophobic foreign policy, Riza Shah knew, would
command almost universal support. Yet his options were very limited. British
and Russian interference in Iranian affairs in the past had been due to their
physical proximity and tostrategic interests which remained constant despite
other changes. Soviet border-units remained within striking distance of Tabriz,
Mashhad and even Tehran, as their Tsarist predecessors had done, and the oil
fields of Khuzistan, the largest single potential source of revenue for the
government, remained firmly under British control. Thus, for all his bravado,
Riza Shah was forced toconduct a pragmatic, fairly cautious, and not always
consistent foreign policy, which achieved less in the assertion of national
independence than many had hoped or expected.
With the Soviets, he seems to have been able to maintain a reasonable
understanding until the late 1930s, when the approach of the Second World War
forced him to make irrevocable choices. With Great Britain, his dealings were
more ambiguous because, while he was determined to reduce as far as possible
the influence ofthe British inIran's internal affairs, there was a limit to what
could be achieved. His government could and did maintain its international
standing quite assertively and successfully, but could do virtually nothing with
regard to the overwhelming concern of every Iranian nationalist, either at that

time oruntil the oil-nationalization crisis of the 1950s: the fact that Iran's one
major source ofwealth was inthe hands ofa British-owned company which
extracted and sold as much oras little oil as it chose, with most of the profits
going tothe British stockholders and government, while the Iranian govern
ment received inadequate royalties and had no access to the company's accounts.
Furthermore, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company operated in the oil-fields and
refinery-area as if in aforeign enclave. Most company officials knew little about
Iran, beyond what they needed to know to carry out their business, and while the
managerial echelons were the preserve ofEuropeans, and the middle-ranking
employees generally Indian, Iranians were engaged only in the lowest and least
skilled positions. Viewed in this fashion from Tehran, the operations of the
company were a barely-disguised form of colonialism. A gnawing sense that the
nation was being robbed came to be felt with increasing intensity and bitterness,
while the fiscal needs of the new Iran grew ever greater. Without additional oil
revenues, those needs could only be met by the Iranian taxpayer.
These considerations lay atthe heart ofRiza Shah's stance towards Great
Britain, although policy directions necessarily fluctuated with the exigencies of
the moment. His firmest assertion of his position came in November 1932, when
he announced the decision to cancel the D'Arcy Concession of 1901, regarded by
Iranians as exploitive and unfair. This temporarily raised his prestige tonew
heights asa champion of the national interest. However, having taken this
decision, he found himself confronted by difficulties similar to those which were
to confront Musaddiq two decades later: the company remained intransigent,
the British government supported the company and threatened force, while
anti-British demonstrations in Tehran had noeffect onoil production. Riza
Shah finally agreed to a new negotiated settlement in 1933, which was to run for
sixty years and could not be unilaterally cancelled. The terms of the agreement
modestly raised Iran's royalties and there were assurances of increased employ
ment for Iranian nationals. However, the Shah had conspicuously failed to break
the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's hold over the country's principal economic
resource, and that failure helps toexplain his increasing friendship with Ger
many, the main characteristic ofhis foreign policy for the rest ofthe reign.
The Oil Agreement of 1933clearly demonstrated the limitations which could
be imposed from outside upon Iran's freedom of action and contributed further
to the prevailing mood of xenophobia. Yet apart from this set-back, Riza Shah
proved quite successful at drawing the world's attention to what he regarded as
the rebirth of his nation. Much of this renewed interest in Iran sprang from the
government's deliberate policy ofidentifying the new Pahlavi Iran with the
238

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: RIZA SHAH, 1921-41
ancient empires of the distant past, stressing contemporary Iran's historic
origins and cultural continuities, and distancing it from its Arab neighbours.
Meanwhile, Riza Shah was determined to have Iran treated as afully sovereign
state. Of all the symbols ofqualified sovereignty bequeathed from the recent
past, the most humiliating were the Capitulations, which excluded foreign
nationals from the jurisdiction of the Iranian courts. Since the law administered
by these courts was, in origin, Islamic, this exclusion was not without some
justification as regards non-Muslim foreigners, yet the Capitulations were clear
proof of diminished sovereignty and therefore greatly resented. As suggested
above, itseems likely that Riza Shah's vigorous drive for judicial reform early in
his reign was linked with his determination to abrogate the Capitulations as soon
as possible, which hedid in 1928. The case fortheir retention was greatly
weakened bythe introduction of a new legal system and codes based upon
European practice.
While athome Riza Shah remodelled the structure of the Foreign Ministry
and initiated anew generation of diplomats to represent their country overseas,
abroad he extended Iranian diplomatic representation to increase his country's
presence on the international scene. He also sought to ensure Iranian participa
tion in the numerous international conferences which derived from the founda
tion of the League of Nations, to which Iran had been an early signatory. Nor
was it a mere caprice of Riza Shah to insist on the substitution of Iran for Persia as
the official name of the country, but a symptom of the new self-conscious
national pride. Henceforth, the country was to be known by the name which its
people used, not a European derivation from Classical and Biblical usage.
Riza Shah also enjoyed considerable success in making Iran more conspicu
ous as a presence in the Middle East. In an era of regional pacts, his government
worked strenuously to create asystem of alliances with its neighbours, Turkey,
Iraq and Afghanistan, leading to the Sacadabad Pact of1937. There was some
initial hesitation, especially on the part of Iraq, partly as a consequence of British
disapproval but also due to irritation at the revival of Iran's irredentist claims to
Bahrain in May 1934, followed bytension over the Shatt al-cArab frontier,
which paralysed diplomatic progress during 1936. But in the middle of the
following year representatives of all four states assembled in Tehran. On 4 July,
a frontier agreement was signed between Iran and Iraq which defused a
potentially explosive conflict between the two, and afew days later, on 8 July,
the four-power agreement was signed in the Sacadabad Palace. The long-term
consequences of this agreement were negligible, but in the short term it served a
useful purpose for Riza Shah in enhancing his international stature. So also, in

1938, did the marriage of the Crown Prince, Muhammad Riza, to Princess
Fawzia, sister of King Faruq of Egypt: the Pahlavi family had been admitted into
the contracting circle ofinternational royalty.
Set against the reality of a century or more of domination by Great Britain
and Russia, these were gestures which assuaged, but did not heal, the wounds to
national pride inflicted during the Qajar period. There was still a need for
powerful friends in the international community as acounterweight to the two
Great Powers. Riza Shah was not the first Iranian ruler to attempt to find them,
but hewas the first to attain any degree of success. Even at the time of the
abortive Anglo-Iranian Agreement of1919, both France and the United States
of America had shown concern at what they perceived to be the beginnings of a
British protectorate. Now, in the very different circumstances of an Iran reborn
under Pahlavi rule, an extension of diplomatic contacts seemed the logical way
of further distancing Iran from Great Britain and the Soviet Union. Riza Shah
did not woo France. He perhaps assumed that difficulties over the Syria and
Lebanon Mandates, as well as domestic problems, left that country with little
inclination for involvement further afield. On the other hand, the United States
seemed the ideal counterweight to Great Britain and the Soviet Union. It had
emerged victorious and immeasurably stronger and richer from the First World
War, and had no tradition of colonialism as the Iranians understood the term.
American post-war participation on the international stage indicated prudence
and moderation, while in Tehran, the pre-war episode of Morgan Shuster and
his ouster as aresult of British and Russian opposition had left a predisposition
to regard Americans differently from other Westerners. Riza Shah was not alone
in thinking along these lines. Only a few months after the 1921 coup d'etat^
Qavam al-Saltana, having replaced Sayyid Ziya al-DIn, instructed Husain cAla,
Iran's representative in Washington, to make known Iran's need for both loans
and financial advisers, as well as to hint at the possibility of an oil concession in
the north. He thereby hoped todraw the Americans into a situation inwhich
they, merely by their presence, would diminish the likelihood of renewed British
or Russian pressure. What Qavam al-Saltana, and later Riza Shah and his
advisers, failed to appreciate was the growing mood of isolationism in the
United States and that country's unwillingness at that time toarouse British
susceptibilities in aregion which American foreign affairs experts still regarded
as a British preserve.
The United States did provide a financial adviser, A.C. Millspaugh, who
achieved considerable success at reorganizing the country's finances between
1922 and 1927. He was, however, resented by both the British and the Russians,
as Shuster had been, and his position was such that hewas bound to make

powerful enemies. Moreover, he was completely unsuccessful in the one matter
upon which Riza Shah himself set so much store: an American loan.An
increasingly unpopular figure in Tehran, he found that the advice which he gave
to the Shah was frequently unpalatable, and he was finally forced to resign. Riza
Shah's dissatisfaction with the Millspaugh mission, however, was primarily a
reflection of his disappointment with the United States for its cool responseto
his overtures. Initial American interest in an oil concession, to which the much
needed loan would have been linked, produced discussions but provoked the
opposition of the British and Soviet governments, while the Anglo-Persian Oil
Company vigorously protested at an apparent threat toits monopoly ofthe
transit of oil across the country. Soviet complaints were of relatively little
concern to the Americans. The attitude of Great Britain, however, was another
matter. Inthe last resort, the United States government did not regard Iran
worth the price of antagonizing the British. The negotiations were called off in a
manner which left the Shah bitterly resentful: still the fate ofIran was being
decided in London and Moscow. It was this increasing sense of frustration
which led him tolook with favour upon closer ties with the Third Reich.
From an Iranian point of view, such ties were very appealing. Germany had
no tradition of imperial intervention in the Middle East to wound Iranian
sensibilities. It was one ofthe world's most advanced nations inscience and
technology, well able to provide assistance to an under-developed country like
Iran. It had capital, technical advisers, and industrial plant and machinery ready
for export. As an added attraction, ithad been since the late 19th century a rival
to Great Britain and Russia. For Germany too, involvement inIran was an
interesting proposition. Iran was a backward country, but one beginning to
make great strides and requiring assistance for its further development. There
were also great opportunities forinvestment with little risk. These factors
contributed toincreased collaboration between the two.
Germany, in effect, played the principal outsider's role in the economic
development of Iran between the World Wars. Asearly as 1926, Junkers
acquired the right of direct flights from Germany to Iran as well as some internal
links between Iranian cities, while asea-link between Hamburg and the Persian
Gulf at last broke the virtual monopoly on communications with Iran, hitherto
maintained by Great Britain and the Soviet Union. Because Great Britain needed
the co-operation of the Iranian government with regard to her own air-service
to India, she was inno position to oppose these concessions to the Germans.
Inside Iran, German firms were engaged in road-building and the initial survey
of the route for the Trans-Iranian railway. Although the engineering contracts
finally went to Sweden, German companies also supplied much of the material
241

needed for the railway's construction. By the late 1930s, plans were afoot to
assist Iran in building an iron-foundry anda steel-mill. Of even greater signifi
cance, on the eve of the Second World War, Germany accounted for nearly half
of Iran's overseas trade, made possible by German willingness to operate a
barter system favourable to the export of Iranian commodities.
But bythis time, thehighly visible German presence in Iran had aroused the
apprehensions of both Great Britain and the Soviet Union. After Germany
attacked the latter, and Britain and Russia became wartime allies, Germany's
civilian "bridgehead" in neutral Iran became a matter of grave concern to the
former rivals. AstheGerman armies pressed eastwards, Great Britain began to
fear for the safety of the Khuzistan oil-fields, while the Soviet Union, desper
ately in need of war-materials, looked to Iran and its newly-built railway as a
funnel through which supplies could reach her from her western allies. In the
face of these concerns, Riza Shah remained impenitent over hisfriendship with
Hitler's Germany. He reaffirmed Iran's neutrality, refused to expel the large
number of German nationals living in Iran, declined to join the Allies and
refused permission for theTrans-Iranian railway to beused for thetransport of
war-materials. It is possible that his intransigence owed something to his
satisfaction at defying the two Powers which had for solong bullied his country,
but the real justification forhis attitude was the fact that the news was of German
victories on all fronts, especially in the panzer thrust towards the Caucasus.
On 19 July, andagain on 16 August 1941, theBritish andSoviet representa
tives in Tehran demanded that the Iranian government adopt measures to
reduce the danger ofa German take-over. Riza Shah's refusal, onthe groundsof
Iran's declared neutrality, to respond to what was essentially an ultimatum
resulted in invasion by British andSoviet units on 25 August, thebeginning of
an occupation which continued throughout theduration of the war. In theend,
Riza Shah had erred in much the same way as some of his despised Qajar
predecessors. Hehadforgotten that whenever thetwoPowers were in accord,
Iran automatically reverted to the role of a pawn. Only when the two were
seriously embroiled in conflict with each other did Iran acquire some room for
manoeuvre.
With no other option open to him,Riza Shah abdicated on 16 September
1941, thereby ensuring thesuccession of his son, Muhammad Riza, an arrange
ment acceptable to the Allies. He then boarded a British warship at Bandar
Abbas, accompanied bymembers ofhis family, expecting to bepermitted to go
into exile ineither the FarEast or in Latin America. Instead, hewas taken first to
Mauritius until his deteriorating health led to his transfer to the Transvaal,
where he died in 1944.

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: RIZA SHAH, 1921-41
Although historians will differ in their assessments of the first Pahlavi Shah
and his impact upon the country, the two decades of his rule must be regarded as
a highly significant phase in the recent history of Iran. There can be no disputing
that, even without his dynamic leadership, many changes would have come to
Iran in the period between the World Wars, but itis difficult to imagine what the
1920s and 1930s would have been like without that formidable presence in the
foreground. He was both admired and hated, sometimes bythe same person.
The early years of his rule saw the introduction of measures of the greatest
importance for the entire country, but as the years passed, the inherent limita
tions of the quintessential dictator—his greed, suspicion and cynicism —took on
a heightened dimension. In the end, he governed alone, without able executives,
intelligent counsellors or honest critics. Those whose abilities seemed threaten
ing, whose motives he mistrusted, who challenged his opinions, or who
opposed his will were disgraced, imprisoned, murdered or driven into exile.
One ofthe shrewdest estimates ofhis impact upon his contemporaries was
made bya distinguished scholar only a few years after his fall.
It was unfortunate for Persia that by the 1920s when Riza Shah rose to power the better had not learned to control the worse, and thus it was that Riza Shah, by acting through the worse, was able to maintain himself in power. Itwas unfortunate, too, that the political judgement of the people had had by this time little opportunity to develop through experience; itsdefects were inevitably reflected in the dictatorship. External circumstances, no doubt, also contributed to therise of Riza Shah and to hissuccess in maintaining himself in power. . . .Nevertheless, the fundamental cause both of his rise to power and his ability to maintain himself in power must be sought in the internal condition of the country prevailing at that time, in the political incapacity and incompetence of the people, andtheinternecine struggles, which prevented effective cooperation for the common end of resisting brutal oppression. . . .Riza Shah was the price Persia had topay for undue delay inmaking the political and social adjustments which were implied in herincorporation as a national state into Western Society. . . . The house had been swept of much of the past that remained, but nothing solid had been put in its place. Riza Shah had failed to create a situation in which the unimpaired faculties of the people could find scope in effective and creative social action. They had been denied all share in political and social activities. No outlet had been left for the ambitions and capacities of the individual citizens. As a result the more sensitive natures had become even more quietist, while the less sensitive had occupied themselves with, and finally become engrossed in, the sordid pursuit of making money. The inevitable consequence had been a degradation on the moral plane. When Riza Shah went, and with him the hollow regime which he had built up, there remained a spiritual vacuum.29

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: MUHAMMAD
RIZA SHAH, 1941-1979
THE ASCENDANCY OF QAVAM AL-SALTANA, 1941—7
In Iran, as 1941 ended, the fact that it was an occupied country was more
important than the departure ofthe former ruler and the accession ofhis twenty
two-year-old son. British and Soviet military units maintained order inthe
major urban centres and ensured that the communications system contributed to
helping the war effort. None ofthe three allies had any immediate interest in the
country itself. Their concern was primarily strategic: to keep theGermansout,
ensure the flow of oil, and assist the Soviets with war-materials transported
across Iran's mountains and deserts by rail and road. In these circumstances,
Iranian politicians found themselves relatively free to pursue their own goals,
constrained only bytheAllies' preoccupation with internal security. Although
public opinion took it for granted that thefate of the country depended once
again upon thewhims of the British andRussian ambassadors, reviving mem
ories of conditions under the last Qajars, the reality wasrather different. Iran
was beginning a decade in which Constitutionalism, accompanied by factional
strife, could enjoy free play. The power struggles now being played out were,
once again, the politics ofelite politicians, landowners orwealthy entrepreneurs
for themost part, or their agents; butwhat was important was that parliament
mattered again, asdidthe office ofprime minister. Parties assignificant entities
did notexist; party slogans andparty groupings did. Perhaps a more accurate
measure of the resuscitation of political life, febrile though it often appeared to
be, was the flowering of a press now comparatively uncensored. Most newspa
pers and periodicals proved extremely ephemeral (one scholar has counted 464
titles,ofwhich43 3were inPersian, appearing between 1941 and19471) but their
quantity is evidence that, politically, the country wascoming alive again.
Muhammad Riza Shah was at this time inexperienced and insecure. His
father's overpowering presence hadbeen suddenly withdrawn, andfrom what
he knew ofhis country's past history, hemight well have felt, when hereadthe

texts of speeches in the Majlis or received visitors from the British and Soviet
embassies, inmuch the same situation asthe young Ahmad Shah Qajar during
the First World War. He seems tohave reacted by devoting himself to physical
recreation and acting as a playboy.
The politicians who emerged during the war years were, forthe most part,
elderly representatives of the generation which had grown upbefore the First
World War. They regarded the twenty-year rule ofRiza Shah asan oppressive
interlude best forgotten. Fewpossessed much direct experience of cabinet
government, an exception being Qavam al-Saltana. Their personal ambitions
and prevailing roles called more for mental agility in intrigue and strong
negotiating skills than forqualities ofconstructive statesmanship. In any case,
theirs was "a holding operation" until theAllies left.
The chronic political instability ofthe war years might well have continued
for long afterwards butforthe swift subordination of all other issues to what
became known as the Azarbaijan crisis. The background tothis episode was the
Soviet occupation of much of north-western Iran during the war, which enabled
them to create thecircumstances for the future secession of Azarbaijan and
neighbouring territories by encouraging Soviet-trained orpro-Soviet political
groups. In pursuing these goals, the Soviets enjoyed the advantages of operating
in apolitically sophisticated part of the country which had atradition of political
activism and radicalism dating back to the Constitutional Movement, and which
had deep grievances against theTehran government. Moreover, some Azari
speaking Turks ofthe region were not immune tothe blandishments of fellow
Azarbaijanis north ofthe Aras. When British military units withdrew from Iran
in March 1946, aSoviet military presence remained behind and under its mantle
two autonomous, and potentially secessionist, regimes came into being in the
northwest: one, in Azarbaijan, headed bythe veteran Iranian Bolshevik, Jafar
Pishavari, whose political career extended back to the short-lived Soviet Repub
lic of Gilan in 1920—1; and theother, in those Kurdish districts west of Lake
Urmiya, for which thetown of Mahabad was a focal-point.
While Great Britain and the United States ofAmerica discreetly enquired as
to Soviet intentions, andpoliticians in the capital became anxious, the two
Soviet satellite regimes consolidated their positions. It was fortunate for Iran
that atsuch atime aconsummate and far-sighted statesman was athand toguide
the country through acritical period which could have seen permanent territo
rial loss. The crisis built up throughout the last months of1945 and into the new
year. On20 January 1946 the prime minister, Ibrahim Hakimi, resigned and a
few days later, by a margin of one vote, theMajlis chose Qavam al-Saltana

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH, 1941-1979
(Ahmad Qavam) as his successor. On his record alone, Qavam was eminently
qualified forthe task, with a political career extending back to the pre-1914
constitutional period. During the years immediately following the First World
War he had held a succession of high offices, including the premiership. A Qajar
by birth and an aristocrat by temperament, he was urbane, sceptical and wary,a
man offew illusions.2
Qavam had always sought to evade the damning label of being aprotege of
any embassy, and as early as the 1920s had advocated bringing the Americans
into Iran to serve as a counterweight to the British and the Soviets. Of the latter,
he knew something at first hand, having been educated partly in pre-revolution
ary Russia, and having established during the Second World War an amicable, if
realistic, working relationship with the Tuda (Masses) Party. At that time this
was the only significant political association in Iran, although increasingly seen
as the tool ofthe Soviet Union. Originally, the Tuda Party had been ledby
radical politicians who had been educated inGermany, orhad spent yearsof
political exile in that country. Some had political origins as Majlis deputies who
had fled from Tehran, first to Qum and then to the protection of German
Turkish units in Kirmanshah in 1915. After the Second World War this
leadership was increasingly replaced by men trained in the Soviet Union. Both in
the capital and outside they were a fact of Iranian political life, which no
government could ignore. Itwas a positive asset for Qavam that, unlike some of
his rivals, he was able to communicate with the Tuda leaders and to some extent
retain their confidence; most important, he was aware oftheir activities.
As hebegan to address the dilemma ofwhat to doabout the potentially
separatist regimes in Tabriz and Mahabad, Qavam deliberately assumed a
posture of caution. To unfriendly or uncomprehending observers he seemed to
shift well to the left of centre. As a public gesture of where his sympathies
seemed tolie, on16 February 1946 he dismissed the Chief ofthe Army Staff,
General Hasan cArfa, who had the reputation of being aprotege of the British.
Two days later, he left for Moscow for what were assumed tobe conciliatory
discussions with the Soviet Foreign Ministry. On his return he had nothing
specific to report but appeared hopeful of fruitful exchanges with the new Soviet
ambassador, due toarrive shortly, atwhich time the question ofa Soviet oil
concession in the north could also be explored. Soon after this, with or without
Qavam's prior knowledge, the Iranian representative at the United Nations,

THE ASCENDANCY OF QAVAM AL-SALTANA, 1941-7
Husain Ala, brought up thequestion of the continuing presence of Soviet
troops onIranian soil, thereby exposing to international view a matter which
had hitherto escaped world attention.3 Qavam, ostensibly embarrassed, sought
to disavow this move as an unnecessary irritant to the Soviets. Perhaps as atoken
gesture of goodwill towards theTuda Party, he ordered thehouse-arrest of
Sayyid Ziya al-DIn Tabataba'i whose Hi^b-i Trada-ji Milll(National Will Party)
was strongly anti-Tuda and whowasregarded as a staunchly Anglophile
conservative.
On 24 March 1946, the Soviet ambassador informed Qavam that Soviet
troop-withdrawals would begin that day, atthe same time reminding him about
Soviet concern regarding the autonomy of the Tabriz and Mahabad regimes,
and also about a Soviet oil-concession. The Soviets did not welcome the
publicity which their relations with Iran were receiving atthe United Nations,a
further debate being scheduled in the Security Council for 6 May 1946, but their
main preoccupation was clearly the question ofa concession. On5 April 1946,
an agreement was signed specifying that within six weeks from 24 March 1946
Soviet army units would leave Iran; that the Soviet Union acknowledged the
affairs of Azarbaljan to beaninternal matter forthe Iranian government; and
that both parties were committed to negotiating a fifty-year oil-concession,
which would be submitted to the Majlis within seven months of24 March 1946.
This requirement ofparliamentary ratification forthe projected oil-conces
sion was Qavam's trump-card, the result ofa 1944 law introduced by Qavam's
kinsman, Dr Muhammad Musaddiq, the object of which was tocurb foreign, in
particular British, concessionary activity. Parliamentary discussion of so emo
tive a subject was bound to bestormy, yet even while Qavam was negotiating
with the Soviets, the life ofthe current Majlis was drawing toaclose, and there
could beno new Majlis without elections. Qavam seems to have assured the
Russians that he could guarantee the election of a parliament favourably
disposed towards an oil agreement, but that while Russian troops were stationed
on Iranian soil, their presence was bound to affect political discourse in the
capital and to determine the public postures of parliamentary candidates and,
eventually, the elected deputies. The Soviets could therefore appreciate
Qavam's anxiety when he pressed to have all Soviet troops withdrawn as soon as
possible as a precondition for holding elections. They were genuinely concerned
about the prospects of their clients in Tabriz and Mahabad, but the oil

concession was apparently of higher priority. In themonths that followed,
Qavam therefore pursued two distinct lines of policy, seemingly contradictory,
but intended in theend to converge.
First, he showed himself to be ostensibly pliant in hisdealings with the
Soviets, allowing them no grounds for complaint. He allowed them to circulate
their propaganda, and that of their Iranian clients, without constraint; he
publicly and assiduously upheld the cause of Iranian—Soviet friendship by means
of cultural activities and social conviviality. Indeed, he seemed so well disposed
towards the Tuda Party that his attitude caused considerable concern in Western
diplomatic circles which failed to recognize the artistry of a Talleyrand. Perhaps
anticipating Soviet suspicions over his behaviour, Qavam introduced three
prominent Tuda Party members into his cabinet, reinforcing this leaning tothe
left with the appointment ofPrince Muzaffar Flruz ashis deputy. Prince Firuz
had the reputation of an extreme radical, besides being bitterly hostile to the
Shah, whose father had murdered his father.4 To the Soviets, this cabinet
reshuffle must have confirmed the impression of Qavam asa fellow-traveller.
While Qavam was publicly assuaging Soviet doubts and arousing Western
suspicions as to his intentions, he could not afford to wait upon events inTabriz
and Mahabad. Both regimes, especially that of Tabriz, were becoming assertive,
secure in their certainty of Soviet protection. Their achievements had been by no
means negligible, despite thehostile reporting of Western journalists. Land
redistribution was beginning ona modest scale, with more expected later; the
region acquired a much-needed university at Tabriz; there was evidence of a
concern for public welfare. Both regimes were continually consolidating, and in
so doing forging new loyalties and anew governing infrastructure. The danger
of secession, followed by integration with Soviet Azarbaijan, was real.For
Qavam, the problem was that intervention could lead todisorder, hence giving
the Soviets apretext for the return of their troops tothese provinces. Thus, the
risk intaking action was as great as the danger of not doing so. Fortunatelyfor
Qavam, the forthcoming elections required the central government to become
more than usually involved in provincial matters. On the grounds of ensuring a
proper climate of opinion in which to conduct a peaceful election, he moved
loyal army units into Azarbaijan. This tactic seems to have unnerved the Soviets,
who had to weigh aninstinctive desire tocome to the aid oftheir proteges in
Tabriz andMahabad with a more pressing concern for the outcome of an

election which would result in anoil concession. Caught between these two
alternatives, they failed to react to the pressures which were now applied by
Tehran to bring the "rebel" provinces into line.
Unfortunately for Qavam, theneed to employ thearmy in thetask of
coercion brought the Shah, as Commander-in-Chief, into the affair, which made
it certain that ruler and army would gain most ofthe credit for restoring the
errant provinces, asproved to bethe case. The Shah, drawing closer to the
officer-corps which had not hitherto seen inhim his father's mettle, won the
advantage in both the short and the long term from Qavam's skilful resolution
of the Azarbaljan crisis. But the premier knew that the army had to be employed
if the country were toremain intact, so the order was given. On 12 December
1946 the army, led by the Shah, entered Tabriz, toinaugurate a blood-bath of
reprisals and areign of terror, action soon to be repeated in Mahabad. Pishavarl,
the veteran Bolshevik, and the wily Kurdish chieftain, Mulla Barzanl, both
escaped: the former, to the Soviet Union, where he died shortly afterwards in a
road-accident; the latter, to Iraq, to play aleading role in the Kurdish rebellions
of the 1950s and 1960s. Their followers wTere less fortunate. As one historian
wrote,
After the reoccupation of the provincial cities, the gallant central Iranian troops inflicted mass "punishment" on innocent and defenceless people on the express orders of their high command and the supreme commander, Muhammad Reza Shah, himself. There was wholesale killing, burning, looting and rape. For this time Azerbijan had been invaded not by foreigners but by fellow Iranians! Since then, 10 December, "the day of the Iranian army", has been apublic holiday on which "the liberation of Azerbijan" iscelebrated with pomp and circumstance.5
Meanwhile, Qavam had been proceeding with the complex arrangements for
a parliamentary election. On the one hand, he had to ensure that the Soviets were
convinced of the sincerity of his endeavours on their behalf, and on the other,
that the new Majlis would be certain to do what was required. Paradoxically, for
his plans to succeed, he needed an assembly which would not be too pliant. So far
as electoral rigging was concerned, the rural seats, usually inthe gift of oneor
more local notables, were rarely indoubt. The urban constituencies, however,
were becoming less predictable. In some, theTuda Party was strongly en
trenched. But it was inthese urban constituencies that candidates had to take
account of the depth and intensity of nationalist feeling, which was most often
anti-British but could swing swiftly against anyone or anything smacking of

foreign exploitation. Mention of oil concessions, invariably associated with
the notion offoreigners filching the nation's resources, could instantly arouse
strong nationalist fervour. The possibility of a Soviet oil agreement was already
doing so, as Qavam had known and hoped it would.
When at last the long-delayed elections were completed, the new Majlis
clearly didnothave theradical composition upon which the Sovietshad
counted. The question was whether it would respond to Qavam's persuasion, as
the Soviets hoped, or follow its own will. Either way, the Soviets were forced to
rely upon Qavam's good-will, having no alternative to him. As promised, once
the new parliament was in session, on 22 October 1947, the prime minister gave
the house his account of the oil negotiations with the Soviet Union. The Majlis,
responding enthusiastically to Musaddiq's oratorical gifts, passed an almost
unanimous resolution (102 to2) declaring the government's negotiations with
the Soviets null and void. The prime minister was only grudgingly exempted
from the penalties prescribed in thelaw of 22 December 1944 concerning
members of the government who undertook unauthorized oil negotiations with
foreigners. It was resolved that Iran would grant no further oil concessions to
foreign powers or companies, and; "In all cases where the rights of the Iranian
nation . . . have been impaired, particularly in regard tothe southern oil, the
Government is required to enter into such negotiations and take such measures
as are necessary to regain the national rights, and inform the Majlis of the
results".6 This last statement referred directly tothe Anglo-Iranian Oil Com
pany. Qavam appeared tohave suffered acrushing reverse, and infact he had,
but it is probable that this is exactly what hehad planned from the outset.
The prime minister remained in office for nearly another two months but his
authority was waning fast. While he was abused by the Soviets and maligned by
the Western allies, the Shah and the army were being acclaimed as the restorers
of the recalcitrant provinces to the nation. Few understood, then or later, what
Qavam had achieved. Azarbaljan is the sole example of a territory passing to the
Soviets during the Cold War, and being then restored. But the prime minister
could not survive without a following inside or outside parliament. He had
neither, and thecourt detested him.7 On 10December 1947, he resigned,
following avote of no confidence in the Majlis. Although he returned for afew
days as premier in the crisis of 1952, hiswork was done. Nevertheless,his
handling of the Azarbaljan crisis, with its implicit threat to the nation's integrity,

century.
THE RISE AND FALL OF MUSADDIQ, I 947— 5 3
For the next two and a half years, the government continued to function
through the established instruments ofprime minister, cabinet and parliament,
the last still without an effective party system. Apart from the Tuda Party, which
continued to expand, particularly in urban centres, there seemed to be little
choice between left or right, nationalists, democrats, conservatives or monar
chists. Theaffiliations of these factions were subject to sudden shifts. There
were noleaders ofQavam's stature. Hakimi was very old; Ala was essentially a
courtier-politician; Suhaili was tarred with the reputation of being pro-British.
It iscertain that during this period the Shah was gaining inpolitical importance.
No single personality strong enough to counter this trend existed to replace
Qavam. The prestige and patronage which inevitably accrued to the court
encouraged this process, as did the loyalists who had survived from the
preceding reign. They saw a strong Shah as a bulwark against factional turmoil.
Most important was thealliance between thethrone and thearmy. The army's
reputation hadbeen tarnished since themilitary debacle of 1941, butwas now
enjoying renown for the "liberation" of Azarbaijan, as wasthe Shah. Thus,
when the former Chief of Staff, General All Razmara, wasappointed prime
minister on 26 June 1950, he was considered to be the Shah's man, not
parliament's. It was taken for granted that his government's direction would
differ from that taken by thegovernments of former premiers, who hadbeen
preoccupied with playing off one Majlis faction against another.8
Abused as aman ofstraw inthe pay ofthe British orthe Americans, criticized
by the Western Allies forhis gestures ofgoodwill towards the Soviets and later
execrated as apawn ofthe Shah, Razmara also managed toarouse deep fears that
he would prove an authoritarian reformer and provoked theenmity of several
influential courtiers. In fact, he seems to have been an intelligent, serious
minded, patriotic and cultivated soldier, certainly capable of the requisite
ruthlessness, butcaught between forces tooextreme to allow himto follow a
middle course. Shah and court expected him topursue their goals by facilitating

a shift in real political power from parliament to palace. Conservatives expected
him topreserve the status quo. Radicals called forreform but were unwilling to
support real change which might jeopardize their interests. Above all, national
ists, whether of right or left, called for action against the Anglo-Iranian Oil
Company (A.I.O.C.). Having neither a parliamentary power-base nor the self
assurance of a Qavam, and regarded rightly or wrongly by virtually everyone as
the Shah's man, Razmara had few options from which to choose. Above all,
neither henor any other Iranian politician at that time could circumventthe
issue which now occupied the centre stage of national politics: oil
nationalization.
Already in the summer of1949, the Iranian government and the A.I.O.C. had
been under pressure to renegotiate their relationship. They had signed arevised
agreement, known as theSupplemental OilAgreement or,at that time,the
Gass—Gulshayan Agreement, after its principal negotiators, which Iranian law
required to be submitted to theMajlis for ratification. Even if the fifteenth
Majlis had been willing toratify it, the fact was that ithad failed to do so before
its session ended. During the protracted elections which preceded the conven
ing of the sixteenth Majlis, opposition to theCompany andits operations,
echoed byvirtually allsignificant political groups and parties, assumed over
whelming proportions. Expressions of moderation were seen as treason. Aware
of Iran's financial dependency upon the oil industry, lacking the survival
instincts ofthe true politician, and scornful ofthe martyrs' rhetoric which held
that Iran could stand against the world, Razmara indicated to the new Majlis that
he supported the Supplemental Oil Agreement. However, the special
commission, established by the assembly toreview the agreement, rejected it in
its entirety. Razmara's support for what was essentially a compromise settlement
with the company thus allowed his enemies to portray him as atraitor in the pay
of the British.
Nevertheless, forthe remainder of 1950 the prime minister appeared to be
very much in control, helped by arather more favourable economic climate than
in the recent past. Then, in February 1951, the Majlis flatly rejected the
company's proposal for fifty-fifty profit-sharing,9 while the Assembly's Special
Oil Commission, chaired by Dr Musaddiq, proceeded to review alternative
options open tothe government. Few doubted that the commission's delibera
tions would lead to a recommendation for outright nationalization, which it
made on 19February 1951. Facing this recommendation head on,Razmara

repudiated it as simply impracticable, but in thecurrent emotional atmosphere
nothing was easier than to misrepresent the prime minister's position. On 7
March 1951, he was assassinated by a member of the extremist Fidc?iyan-i Islam.
Such was themood ofthe time that the assassin was acclaimed asa saviour of the
nation and granted a pardon by parliament.10
Whatever Razmara's record hadbeen — and hehadgiven evidence of energy
and resourcefulness - it can be said that no premier who did not support
nationalization could have survived. Isolated bya court which dreaded drawing
upon itself the opprobrium of opposing or even qualifying nationalization,
Razmara was thevictim of the notion that pragmatism canprevail in a political
milieu charged with intense emotion. The Shah, it seems, viewed his removal
from the scene with mixed feelings, despite Razmara's ostensible butnot,
according to recent research, unquestionable loyalty to thethrone. Muhammad
Riza Shah feared strong-willed, independently-minded prime ministers, and he
may well have come to regard Razmara with the same kind of suspicion with
which he had regarded Qavam before him. Writing thirty years later in his
memoirs, his assessment of Razmara was not generous.
Razmara . . . could not or would not bring negotiations with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to a conclusion. His performance in Parliament was terrible. He failed to articulate clearly thegovernment's positions andwas widely perceived asan ineffective
parliamentarian.11
With Razmara gone, the Shah turned to the faithful cAla as a caretaker
premier, knowing, like most political observers, that this could only be an
interim appointment. The political mood in Iran was frenetic. In the Majlis
debates, especially those relating to policy on oil, one man,Dr Muhammad
Musaddiq, hadcome to dominate the Assembly. Musaddiq hada loosely-knit
and broad-based coalition of supporters in the Majlis, known as]abha-yi Milll
(The National Front). Hewas also gaining an increasing following in the streets
and bazaars, which made hima formidable figure who, in thepast months, had
risen to prominence, nationally and internationally, as chairman of the Parlia
mentary OilCommission. Histime hadnow come. With grave misgivings, the
Shah accepted the inevitable, and appointed him prime minister. Hewas bowing
both to the will of the Majlis and to that of the overwhelming majority ofhis
people.

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH, 1941-I979
For the historian, Musaddiq remains something ofan enigma.12 During his
premiership, the western Press persistently derided and misrepresented him. In
his own country, however, during the dark years ofPahlavi repression, he came
to be seen as aselfless patriot and the lost leader, the victim ofcourt intrigue and
foreign intervention. His personality, as reflected inhis public life and speeches,
does not allow easy categorization. It hasbeen said that he was a peculiarly
Iranian phenomenon. On the international scene, he stood out as the leader of an
emerging country who dared to defy Europe's established political and econ
omic hegemony, asdid such other "revolutionary" figures ofthe day as Nasser,
Nehru, Nkrumah orSukarno. For Musaddiq tochallenge the Anglo-Iranian Oil
Company was as courageous and reckless as Nasser's nationalization ofthe Suez
Canal; butsuch analogies must notbepursued too far. In spite of a century of
subjection toRussian and British domination, Iran had never been acolony, and
Musaddiq's roots were very different from those ofcontemporary anti-colonial
nationalist leaders. To the British, for example, Nehru, educated at Harrow and
Cambridge, or Jinnah, theimmaculate barrister-at-law, were readily compre
hensible figures; Musaddiq was not. Musaddiq's political style didnotaccord
with the West's preconceptions ofhow aThird World leader would be likely to
act, and this incomprehension on the part of his foreign adversaries substantially
exacerbated the tragedy of his career. Musaddiq exasperated the Americans
almost asmuch asheinfuriated the British, who felt that negotiation with him
was impossible. From the perspective of Washington, Nkrumah wasa not
untypical product ofAmerican college education and Nehru could berepresen
ted asa kind of Indian Jefferson. By comparison, Musaddiq, with his flamboy
ant rhetoric and histrionic performances, would have been a figure of fun, had
he not seemed to imperil a Western bastion against the U.S.S.R. Westerners in
Iran who thought that they understood thepoliticians of the oldschool, and
found the soldierly Razmara relatively straightforward todeal with, seem not to
have known what to make of Musaddiq.
Unfortunately, it will never beknown what this man might have achieved.
His two years in office asprime minister, a period of extreme political tension,
provide few clues astohow he would have behaved ina more peaceful time.In
foreign affairs, hewould presumably have followed a neutral course, avoiding,
like Nehru, close ties with either ofthe Super Powers, and taking Iran intothe
non-aligned grouping of the Bandung Conference (195 5). Hewould probably

have introduced welfare legislation in an attempt to ameliorate the appalling
conditions under which most Iranians lived. Hewould surely have avoided the
vast military expenditure, and the accompanying extravagance and waste, which
characterized the last twenty-five years of the Shah's reign.
But Musaddiq subordinated what many would consider a realistic appraisal
of what was politically possible and economically desirable to adeeply ingrained
sense of the wrongs which he, with somany others, felt that Iran hadsuffered at
the hands of foreign exploiters. Theexplanation for this is partly biographical.
Although in theearly years of his career he hadheld high office andbeen at the
centre of the governing process, he wasnow, in 1951, at the age of seventy, a
national figure long excluded from the exercise of authority as a result ofhis
unwavering opposition to the Pahlavi dynasty and its unconstitutional proce
dures. Embittered by years in the political wilderness, which had only ended
with his election to the Majlis in 1944, he had become the quintessential
opposition politician who could indulge in the luxury of disregarding the
compromises bymeans ofwhich men inpower stay there. Hehad inhis complex
make-up certain self-destructive qualities. He was a spell-binding orator who
could mock and deride, expose and wound, but he had little talent for
conciliation. Essentially, he lacked Qavam's sagacity. It sometimes seemed that
his political acts were inspired almost exclusively byhistwo lifelong obsessions:
implacable hatred of the Pahlavi dynasty and no less implacable opposition to
Great Britain's interventionist role in Iran's internal affairs. Neither obsession
was hard to understand or unusual in theIran of the 1950s. What seems to have
been imprudent of Musaddiq was his attempt to pursue both simultaneously.
A passing judgement on Musaddiq in office might hold that, on tactical
grounds, he should have avoided open confrontation with the court and
supported the Shah until a satisfactory settlement with the A.I.O.C. had been
achieved. Then should have come thetrial of strength with themonarchy. Even
before Qavam's resignation inDecember 1949, theShah hadbeen moving intoa
more active role on thepolitical stage, a reality which anyprime minister of the
day had to face; and Muhammad Riza Shah never liked prime ministers to be too
successful or too much in thepublic view.
Musaddiq could reckon on little or no support from the throne as he
challenged the A.I.O.C, meaning theBritish. Yethe still required support,and
in this regard hisposition was somewhat ambiguous: hehad neither an ideology
with which to reinforce hischarisma, nora party through which to disciplinehis
supporters. In place of ideology, there wasthe rhetoric of fervent nationalism,
which fell upon receptive ears, but was no substitute for a well-articulated
255

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH, 1941-1979
programme of reform. Asfor party, he commanded no stable cadres in the
Majlis, let alone organized support in the bazaars, or in workshops and factories
such as the Tuda Party commanded. What he did have was the National Front.
This, however, was not somuch a party asa coalition: anaccommodation of
personalities, dauras(circles), alliances and groupings.13 What its members had
in common were strong nationalist sentiment, resentment offoreign interfer
ence in their country's affairs, support for oilnationalization and, in varying
degrees of intensity, a commitment to modernizing and reformist legislation.
The individuals ranged widely across the political spectrum: liberals and
conservatives, progressives and radicals, secularists and Islamic modernizers.
Yet it isimpossible not tobe impressed by an organization, however loosely it
wTas held together, which counted among its founder members such men as
Karim Sanjabi and All Shaygan, both professors of law, the latter, aMinister of
Education under Qavam; the Paris-educated journalist, Husain Fatimi; the
mercurial Husain Makki; and from Qavam's former Democrat Party {Hi^b-i
Demokraf), Ahmad Razavi, Shams al-DIn Amir Ala°I, Abu3l-Husain Ha°irzada,
and Muzaffar Baqa°I ofKirman, the future co-founder, with Khalll MalikI,of
the Hif^b-i Zahmatkishan-i Millat-i Iran (The Iranian People's Toilers Party).14
For all its shortcomings, the National Front contained most of what was
positive, humane, and progressive in Iranian public life, and itsleaders were,
generally, thebest of their generation.15
As apolitical movement, the National Front was seen togreatest advantage
when compared with its opponents: fervent monarchists, religious conserv
atives, or radicals and communists. But itlacked coherence. There was too much
indiscipline and volatile behaviour, with individuals coming and going, chang
ing positions, regrouping in alliances, and pursuing private ambitions. Cer
tainly, it provided Musaddiq with a following, and included a number ofloyal
and courageous supporters, but itwas not enough. Itwas in part the inefficacy of
the National Front as a political tool which led Musaddiq toturn to dangerous
and finally self-destructive expedients: to enlist the Tuda Party as an ally; toseek
supra-parliamentary powers; and, perhaps most hazardous of all, to appeal to the
frustrated dispossessed who, for a brief moment, seemed convinced that all their
griefs would behealed if the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were to be evicted

from Abadan. But once he had stirred up popular emotion he could not control
it. Heused thefear of the mob to overawe theMajlis, threaten the throne,
discourage opposition anddemand special powers, but in so doing he was
clearly taking great risks. As duly appointed prime minister, operating within
the framework of a Constitution which he had upheld at some personal risk
throughout his career, he now found himself undermining the very institutions
in which he had so long put his faith. In sodoing, he appeared asa demagogic
dictator, losing support even amongst his own supporters. This reckless appeal
to mob rule was afactor which undoubtedly contributed to the ease with which
his government was overthrown inthe August 1953 coup d'etat. Demagogy lost
him the political middle ground and set an example to his adversaries of the right,
who exploited itmore cynically and more ruthlessly than he had known how to.
Musaddiq also failed to comprehend that what, in his eyes, was an internal
crisis concerning the operations within Iran ofa foreign company unavoidably
involved international politics. Forced to take these extraneous factors into
account, helacked Qavam's sense oftiming and negotiating skill. In addition,
the oil nationalization bill, which at hisprompting theMajlis hadhurriedly
passed days after Razmara's assassination, effectively closed his options for
bargaining with the A.I.O.C., which wasincreasingly perceived to be an
extension ofthe British government. InGreat Britain there was now a Labour
government, with its own large-scale programme of nationalization. Neverthe
less, the Iranian move against the A.I.O.C. provoked great concern and resent
ment in London, where Musaddiq's nationalization project was regarded,
especially among Conservatives, as being both an expropriation of a great
imperial asset and anational humiliation. Itwas argued that the loss of accessto
cheap Iranian oil would have serious consequences for the British economy. In
the harsh circumstances of the post-war years, access tocheap oil and the ability
to earn foreign currency through its resale abroad were matters of prime concern
to the British government, which also derived more tax revenue from the
A.I.O.C. than the Iranian government earned in royalty payments. Whatever
the justice of the Iranian case, not even a Labour government was willing or
politically able to back down.16
Musaddiq's one hope, in a conflict which seemed to begrowing ever more
serious, was to discourage theUnited States from supporting its British ally.
From the outset, Musaddiq seems tohave assumed that American oil interests
would take advantage of the dispute with the A.I.O.C. by encroaching on what

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH, I941-I979
had hitherto been a British preserve. This development did not,in fact,
materialize. This was due to Washington's perception of Musaddiq's cavalier
attitude to the international community and his flirtation with the left as asource
of risk tothe neutrality ofIran. It was argued that although Musaddiq was not
pro-communist, his reckless handling of both friends and enemies in Tehran,
and increasing dependence upon the Tuda Party for support, were turning him,
intentionally orotherwise, into a Soviet tool. The growth of this perception in
Washington, as well as loyalty tothe Atlantic alliance, led the United States to
join with the British and the monarchists in Iran in overthrowing the Musaddiq
government. The rise and fall ofMusaddiq istherefore closely linked with the
oil nationalization crisis. In March 1951, the Majlis had approved the recom
mendation ofthe Special Commission onthe oil industry, ofwhich Musaddiq
was the chairman, in favour of nationalization, and with that asthe principal
objective ofhis administration, Musaddiq became prime minister. The Majlis
voted Musaddiq into the premiership on30 April; on 1 May, he anounced the
nationalization of the A.I.O.C., promising compensation.
The British, anticipating the course of events in Tehran, had already appealed
to the International Court atThe Hague, which ruled that ithad no jurisdiction
in the case, aposition which seemed torecognize Iran's right tonationalizeits
assets ifcompensation were paid tothe company. Neither the A.I.O.C. nor the
British government were prepared to accept this, and although the United States
had not hitherto appeared toobject tonationalization, the realities of Cold War
politics brought Washington increasingly behind London in opposing the
Iranian fait accompli. This caused the major oil companies to support the
A.I.O.C, so that Iran was faced with a boycott of her oil by all buta few
maverick Italian andJapanese companies. Negotiations between theparties
failed to produce results; there was intransigence on both sides. Increasingly
confident of American support the British stood firm, persuading the United
States that Musaddiq was becoming aprisoner of the Tuda and that loss ofoil
royalties would facilitate a communist takeover in Iran. Moreover, they had
additional means of putting pressure on theIranian government. These in
cluded freezing Iran's sterling balances in Great Britain. Faced with a deteriorat
ing economic situation, Musaddiq's government wasforced to introduce
unpopular measures. This lost the prime minister some ofhis centrist support,
on the one hand tempting him to claim emergency powers; on the other, to look
towards theTuda andits allies for support. In so doing, he found himself
bargaining with theleft from a position of weakness, whereas Qavamhad
negotiated with it from one ofstrength. This shift to the left further inflamed
American anxiety over a possible communist takeover. It also raised doubts

among the clerical supporters ofthe National Front, inparticular the redoubt

Abadan refinery, Musaddiq went to Washington to ask President Truman to
provide a loan, now urgently needed. The request was brusquely shelved until
such time as Iran patched up its quarrel with the British. Musaddiq returned to
Tehran empty-handed, toface further deterioration ofthe economy, while the
settlement of the oil dispute seemed as remote as ever. There were signs of
popular discontent in street demonstrations and violent clashes between oppos
ing factions. Resentment and rage against Great Britain and the United States
naturally predominated in the political rhetoric of the times, but there was alsoa
strong undercurrent ofdemands forsocial reform, with calls for radical change
in the machinery ofgovernment. Although preoccupied with the oil crisis and,
increasingly, with the hostility ofthe palace, Musaddiq was not unsympathetic
to calls for reform. In theelections for theseventeenth Majlis, the National
Front moved towards the left and urged major electoral reforms, but in so doing
it alienated thelandowners andtribal leaders, who now drew closer to the
monarchists and the military. The National Front did well inurban constituen
cies, but badly in rural areas. Musaddiq, realizing that he wasunlikely to
command a majority in the new house, stopped the vote once a parliamentary
quorum had been elected.
The Majlis assembled in February 1952. Several months of manoeuvring
followed inwhich the National Front called fora programme ofsocial justice,
while conservatives sought inevery possible way tohinder ordistract the work
of government. Then, quite suddenly, events came toahead. On16 July 1952,
Musaddiq insisted on exercising the prime minister's legitimate right to nomi
nate the Minister ofWar. When the Shah refused toaccept this, he resignedon
the grounds that themonarch had violated theConstitution. The Shah then
appointed as premier the aged and ill Qavam, but the public responded with five
days of demonstrations, strikes and rioting, inwhich Ayatullah Kashani played
the leading role. Unnerved bythe scale and intensity ofthe protests, the Shah
capitulated, and recalled Musaddiq. The date, 21 July 1952 {Siyyum-i I7r), was
commemorated as marking a popular and national uprising.17
Musaddiq's position after July 1952 was apparently far stronger than before.

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH, 1941^1979
The Shah had been forced to back down, and with him Musaddiq's conservative
and foreign enemies had lost ground. Among the masses Musaddiq's popularity
increased. He seemed to embody an unflinching courage and incorruptible
patriotism which had once defied Riza Shah himself and now defied his son. He
had stood upto the detested foreigners and overcome them, and was the one
hope ofthose liberals who dreamed ofsocial and economic reform. The prime
minister was quick toassert his new strength and humble his enemies. He took
the post of Minister of War (renamed Defence) himself, appointed Qavam's
nephew, General Vusuq, ashis assistant, purged the upper ranks ofthe officer
corps, transferred 15,000 soldiers tothe gendarmerie, reduced the secret service
allocations and cutthemilitary budget by fifteen percent.
Musaddiq demanded extraordinary emergency powers from the Majlis,
initially granted for six months, then extended for another twelve, to enable him
to balance thebudget and initiate electoral, judicial and educational reforms.
Using these special powers he decreed a land reform law which required
landlords to forego 20% of their share of the crops grown on their land, of which
half was toberestored tothe cultivators, and half to beused forthe establish
ment ofrural banks toprovide credit forfarmers. This law did not address the
larger issue of land being chiefly owned by asmall number of great landowners,
but it indicates the direction which Musaddiq's administration might have
taken, but forhis overthrow a year later. He also tackled another problem, the
loopholes through which rich and influential men avoided payment oftaxes, a
matter of even greater urgency now that income from oil royalties had ceased.A
new tax law was drafted which increased the tax liability of the wealthier classes.
The Majlis, predictably, resisted such measures, which affected somany of its
members, ortheir patrons. Faced with parliamentary intransigence, Musaddiq
appealed tothe people through anational referendum inJuly 1953 which gave
him a massive vote of confidence.
He had not,however, forgotten that the ultimate enemy wasthe Shah
himself. He appointed as Minister of Court Abu3l-Qasim Amini, a former
member of Qavam's Democrat Party andthe elder brother of his Finance
Minister, CA1I Amini; he reduced the court budget, diverting the savings to the
Ministry of Health; hebrought the royal charities under government surveil
lance and transferred the estates acquired by Riza Shah into the public domain.
The Shah was prohibited from dealing directly with accredited diplomats, who
had now toconduct their business with the Foreign Ministry. The Shah's twin
sister, Ashraf, regarded as aperson who encouraged his absolutist leanings and
disregard for theConstitution, was sent into exile. Asone historian wrote:

THE RISE AND FALL OF MUSADDIQ, 1947-5 3
Iran, like many other Asian countries, appeared to be taking the road of republicanism, neutralism, and middle-class radicalism. Not since 1925 had so much power been concentrated in the office of prime minister and so little in the hands of the shah.18
Notwithstanding the tremendous pressures to which the Musaddiq govern
ment was subjected, its last year of life witnessed some solid achievements:
irrigation projects were launched in the countryside; plans were initiated to
improve agriculture; new factories were set up, and there was a modest increase
in industrial production. There were also attempts at institutional change. As
one historian has written, ". . . in the field of administrative, judicial, and other
reforms, the record of the democratic government is . . . impressive".19 But the
problems were also impressive. There was inflation, due partly to British
punitive measures. The loss of oil revenue was serious. The conservative
opposition and the threat of an army coup clouded the horizon, and fissures
began to emerge within the National Front itself. Musaddiq was manifestly
moving in a popularist direction, leading the Front from a position left of centre.
No doubt his immense popularity with so many of his countrymen and his faith
in the power of his oratory emboldened him to accept the risk of attempting
genuinely radical reforms. He could not have been under any illusion about the
hostility of his opponents: the court, great landlords, the very rich, and certain
senior army officers. But his greatest problem lay with the National Front. As he
tried to strengthen his grip on the administration and embark on a programme
of reforms, the National Front began to disintegrate. An uneasy assortment of
factions, its basic incompatibilities now came to the fore. The prime minister had
the support of the progressive and liberal elements for his radical measures, but
colleagues and allies of more traditional or conservative views became uneasy
and prepared to abandon him. This was particularly true of his clerical allies, led
in the Majlis by Ayatullah Kashani and Shams Qanatabadi, who considered that
the government's proposed measures smacked of atheism and Marxism, and
were in contravention of the Shaft a. They found the secular outlook of a man
like Husain Fatimi, the Foreign Minister, or the anti-clerical past of AbuDl- All
Lutfi, the Minister of Justice, utterly abhorrent. Kashani was also alienated by
Musaddiq's not admitting that the success of the anti-Qavam demonstrations
had been largely due to his skilful orchestration, and not acknowledging the
debt owed to him. But Kashani's alliance with Musaddiq had always been

primarily tactical: initially, they had shared the same enemies and, for different
reasons, similar goals.
As Musaddiq found himself increasingly alienated from the right wing of the
National Front, he inevitably turned tothe left for allies. This inexorably drew
him closer to the Tuda Party, to which, during the early part of195 3, he seemed
to grant the freedom of the streets. However, the support ofthe Tuda Party
enabled hisenemies to portray him as a pawn of the left. The British and,
increasingly, the Americans had been saying this forsome time. Kashani was
uncomfortable atthe prospect of being part of such an alliance, and itdrew him
nearer to themonarchist culama, such as Ayatullah Muhammad Bihbaham.
Indeed, even Ayatullah Aqa Husain Burujirdi, thesupreme Marja-i Taql'id
(Source of Emulation), who was opposed to clerical involvement in politics, was
known to beworried bythe direction events were taking.
Although during the last twelve months of his premiership Musaddiq
seemed to be fully in control, his enemies were gathering, while his own
inchoate political base was rapidly crumbling. The arrest ofGeneral ZahidIin
February 1953 for plotting tooverthrow the government with foreign support
should have alerted Musaddiq to imminent danger.20 The General was soon
released asa placatory gesture, but bythen the conflict ofprime minister and
monarch had become the most important issue ofthe day. The 1906 Constitu
tion required that both thecivilian administration and thearmed forces be
immune to pressure from thethrone. TheShah, as his subsequent actions
demonstrated, was no more inclined than his father before him to let the
Constitution stand inhis way. But to subvert the constitutional government of
the country, absolute control over the armed forces was essential. Both he and
Musaddiq understood this. The contest forcommand ofthe army was fought
out through the spring and summer of 195 3. The prime minister's allies ofthe
right had abandoned him; his allies ofthe left were behaving timorously and
deviously; he possessed fewsupporters in thehigher ranks of the services.
Hence, he found himself almost singlehandedly facing the Shah and a network
of conspiring generals, supported by most army units and fortified by foreign
encouragement and funds. Still popular, still prime minister, hewas a leader
without a following to support him at local level. Kashani's supporters, who had
acted on Musaddiq's behalf on 21 July 1952, were unavailable, and the masses
whom the Tuda leaders were supposed to command failed tomaterialize. Even
so, the first attempt at aroyalist coup failed. On 16 August 1953, the Shah having
20 Fail-Allah Zahidi (1890-1963) entered the army in 1916. In the Second World War hewas military governor of Isfahan until his pro-Nazi activities compelled the British to exile him. His arrest in 1942 bya British unit is described in McLean's Eastern Approaches, pp. 263—74.

THE RISE AND FALL OF MUSADDIQ, 1947-5 3
withdrawn to theisolation of one of his Caspian residences, an attemptwas
made, by Colonel Nicmat-Allah Nasirl, later thehead of SAVAK, to dismiss
Musaddiq byroyal decree and replace him with General Zahidl. The attempt
failed due tothe Chief ofStaff, General Riahi, one of Musaddiq's few supporters
in the highest ranks of the army. On 17 August the Shah fled the country, first to
Iraq and then toItaly. By18 August, Musaddiq seemed to beincontrol ofthe
situation but, concerned with the threat ofa breakdown ofpublic order or,as
one version hasit, to reassure theAmerican ambassador that he was still in
charge,21 he ordered thearmy to clear thestreets, thereby cutting himself off
from the urban masses, ultimately his one sure support. Thenext day, 19
August, the conspirators launched acoup d'etat, inthe course ofwhich the prime
minister's house was attacked andlooted, despite thebrave resistance of his
bodyguard. Two days later, Musaddiq, who hadbeen taken to safety by his
supporters, surrendered to the new regime. On23 August, theShah returned
from Europe. A new chapter in the long history of Iranian despotism had begun.
The background andcourse of the coupd'etat of August 1953 have been
frequently recounted, usually from the point of view of the victors. The
monarchist version played down therole of outside assistance, preferring to
describe the events of19August as proof of the loyalty of most Iranians towards
the throne, dutifully celebrated thereafter with a public holiday on every 28
Murdad, the date ofthe event according tothe Iranian calendar. Opponents of
the new order, on the other hand, stressed foreign support for the coup as the key
factor in its success. The two countries allegedly involved, the United States and
Great Britain, both officially denied involvement, preferring to give credit for
the operation tothe Shah's loyal officers, and thereby avoiding the opprobrium
of having removed an elected prime minister. Nevertheless, Iranians have never
had theslightest doubt that theC.I.A., acting on behalf of the American and
British governments, organized the conspirators and paid the pro-Shah mobs
led bytoughs from southern Tehran which, together with army units, were in
control ofthe streets by nightfall on 19 August. By 1982 this tenacious rumour
had been fully confirmed andis now seen as incontrovertible.22

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH, I941-I979
Thus ended what appears, in retrospect, tohave been Iran's last chancefor
the establishment of a liberal reformist government, functioning within a
parliamentary constitution. Musaddiq's overthrow owed something to his
personal errors of judgment as well astothe inherent failings ofthe National
Front. Itcertainly provided the occasion for the establishment of an increasingly
authoritarian regime which, in the end, could only beoverthrown by revol
ution. For Iranians ofall political persuasions, whether pro- oranti-Shah, the
coup of 19 August 1953 confirmed a long-held conviction, that the source ofall
effective political action was to be sought in the machinations of foreigners.
Inevitably, the Shah came to be seen as the puppet of Western, primarily
American, interests, which had directly intervened tooverthrow the legitimate
government of Iran and torestore him tohis throne inthe pursuit of their own
ends. If, two decades later, it seemed to some foreign observers that the Shah
manipulated hisAmerican allies, the Iranian perception was very different.
FROM ZAHIDI TO AMINI, I953—62
The autocracy which characterized the years between 1963 and1978 did not
immediately come into being inthe wake ofthe August 195 3 coup d'etat. That
event was indubitably a royalist restoration, but the returning Shah did not at
first command the lonely eminence to which helater laid claim. For the time
being, he was apartner of those who had made possible his return, or who were
committed to the political scenario implicit in his restoration: the military
leaders who had engineered the coup; those landlords, entrepreneurs and clerics
who had come tofear Musaddiq's potentially disruptive policies, and who had
also feared aTuda Party takeover; and the fickle Tehran mob headed by brutish
hooligans. This partnership was led by the suave and ambitious General Zahidl.
Behind these indigenous elements were theforeigners. The Americanshad
made it allpossible by co-ordinating and financing theconspirators, having
come toappreciate the strategic significance of Iran for the Cold War, while the
British had been the prime movers in the whole affair due to their hostility to
Musaddiq and their anxiety for future access toIranian oil. The Shah could not
yet overshadow these diverse and formidable interest groups.
Zahidl became prime minister. He was the inevitable choice, but whilehis
cabinet and the neweighteenth Majlis reflected prevailing anti-Musaddiq
sentiment, neither was composed exclusively of the Shah's placemen. The
cabinet was sufficiently broad-based toinclude, as Minister ofFinance, Dr All
Amlni, who hadserved in thesame office under Musaddiq, andwho soon

distinguished himself in negotiating aspeedy settlement ofthe oilproblem. The
Majlis elections, although obviously not "free", returned many former depu
ties with noparticular court affiliation. Musaddiq's constitutional and national
ist ideals could not yet be completely disregarded. Not for a decade would
cabinet andparliament be composed exclusively of the Shah's creatures.
As conciliator and restorer of order, Zahidi proved shrewd, tough and
pragmatic. Themost pressing tasks of the newgovernment were to restore
economic confidence at home and abroad, to beachieved with the assistanceof
the United States, and to renew oil production through the agency of a
consortium of international oil companies in which British Petroleum was to
have a 40%interest. Local operations in Iran became theresponsibility of the
newly-created National Iranian OilCompany (N.I.O.C.).23 Thenew govern
ment was also determined to root out supporters of the old regime and
opponents ofthe new. Inthis last area, Zahidi's approach predictably reflected a
Cold Warmentality. The new regime veered between harshness and compara
tive leniency towards the National Front and its supporters, punishments
ranging from execution or imprisonment to house-arrest. The radical right
suffered less, despite itsrecord ofcollaboration with theMusaddiq government,
because Ayatullah Kashani andhissupporters haddistanced themselves from
the former premier during the past months and seemed to support the monar
chy. The radical left felt the full weight of royalist vengeance, although public
repentence could earn pardon, eventual rehabilitation and even official prefer
ment.24 Opportunists came to terms easily enough, while some of the
irreconcilable foes of the neworder managed to escape into exile abroad.
The work ofrepression was carried outmainly bythemartial law administra
tion headed by Brigadier Timur Bakhtiyar, later promoted to the rank of
general, to become the first head of SAVAK {Sa^man-i Ittilcfat va Amnlyat-i
Kisbvar), the State Intelligence and Security Organization. There were also
some vigilante outrages committed by non-official groups, inspired or tacitly
approved of by the government. Thereign of terror set a precedent for the
future, especially with regard to the practice ofmilitary tribunals investigating
"political" offences, an abuse which continued down to the last days of the
monarchy.

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH, I94I-1979
Musaddiq the centre-piece ofthese punitive measures. But it badly misjudged
the effect of his show-trial. In open court, facing military prosecutors and
obviously prejudiced judges, Musaddiq's courage, defiance and eloquence won
him the admiration of even those who had never supported him. As prisonerin
the dock, in asetting intended todegrade and demean him, he became the "lost
leader" of later legend, whom the Shah might deride for his "negative national
ism", and foreign journalists mock for his histrionics, but who thereby acquired
an abiding place inthe hearts of the Iranian people and inthe history of Iranian
constitutionalism. Musaddiq's sentence of three years solitary confinement was
followed by house-arrest on his estate until his death in 1967. Others were less
fortunate. The former Foreign Minister, Husain Fatimi, whose call for an end of
the monarchy had aroused the rage ofthe Shah, was brutally assaulted at the
time of his arrest, tried andexecuted; AbuDl- CA1I Lutfi, former Minister of
Justice, was murdered. Other National Front leaders were treated less severely,
although for some years theNational Front was a proscribed organization.
Meanwhile, a modern police-state began to take shape. From this time, fear
became second nature to theIranian people, even to those who considered
themselves above suspicion.
In foreign affairs, the government, while trying to avoid aclient relationship
with a single Great Power, seems tohave recognized its dependence upon the
United States. Naturally, it sought to develop other relationships, and there are
indications that during this period the Shah toyed with the idea of playing off the
Soviet Union against his American ally.25 Even inthese early years of Iranian
American collaboration, Muhammad Riza Pahlavl seems tohave resented the
patron-client relationship implicit in accepting American assistance. Equally
galling was the suspicion inhis mind that the Americans perceived ZahidI asa
virtual king-maker and the real power behind the throne. What ifthey were to
conclude that the able and ambitious premier might prove more reliable than the
hitherto equivocal Shah? Nearly a decade later, the monarch's resentment
towards another strong prime minister, Amini, was tobe fuelled by American
praise ofone whom he regarded as amere executor of the royal will. Through
out the reign, Muhammad Riza Shah remained acutely alert tothe dangers of
Ministers upstaging him. His preference was formen wholly dependent upon
his favour, but who had the capacity to run a"modern" state.26 As for ZahidI, he
had been well rewarded for hispart in therestoration. Hehad attained the

premiership, and his son had married Princess Shahnaz, the Shah's daughter and
only child by his first marriage. Nevertheless, the Shah continued to regard
Zahidi as a latent threat. InApril 1955, therefore, under the pretext of concern
for Zahidi's allegedly failing health, herequested his resignation and ordered
him to Switzerland forconvalescence. It was toprove a terminal exile, serving
notice to royal servants that they should not grow too great. Athis departure
from Mihrabad airport, Zahidi is supposed to have said to his assembled friends,
"Poor Dr Musaddiq was right after all!"27
The appointment of Husain cAla as Zahidi's successor was intended as an
interim measure, but lasted until April 1957. Meanwhile, the Shah was searching
for a suitable way ofimplementing his two prime objectives; the concentration
of all executive authority inhis own person, and modernization, with the latter
serving as ameans by which toachieve acquiescence inthe former. Thus, from
the late 1950s, direct and attentive control and surveillance by the monarch over
virtually every significant aspect of government became normative, andthis
continued until the end of the reign. Naturally, the intensity and perspicacity of
the royal scrutiny fluctuated, butas a generalization, it canbe said that the
phrase, "Uetat, c'est mof\ accurately describes how the country was managed.
The Shah found his instrument in the person of Dr Manuchihr Iqbal, who
unashamedly described himself to the nineteenth Majlis asmerely his master's
voice.28 The first in aseries of courtier-politicians who, apart from Amini's brief
incumbency ofthe premiership, headed successive governments during the last
two decades ofPahlavi rule, Iqbal held office for over three years (April 1957 to
August i960). While Iqbal was prime minister, Iran conveyed to theoutside
world an impression of modest economic progress and apparent social stability,
an impression which owed much to generous financial and military assistance by
the United States, and to the elimination of virtually all opposition to the regime.
From this time, censorship and the dread of attracting the attention of SAVAK
created a climate of opinion in which conformity to therequirements of the
regime and acquiescence inthe statusquo seemed the most obvious way toavoid
trouble. The lively if often irresponsible political activities in which educated
and articulate Iranians had indulged during the post-war years were curtailedin
order not toprovoke the curiosity of informers and agentsprovocateurs who were
suspected of being in every office, cafe and classroom. Notsurprisingly, the
ambitions and appetites of the expanding middle class turned to the fulfilment of

expectations ofmaterial gain, accompanied by a galloping consumerism and a
thirst toacquire and display the artefacts and gadgetry taken tobe evidence of
Western "progress". As an ideology, the State carefully fostered a euphoric and
complacent brand of nationalism in which the more recent Islamic centuries
were overshadowed by the evocation of the glories of the Achaemenid and
Sasanid eras, andwhich promised an even more glittering and materially
rewarding future under the benign rule of the Shahanshah. Meanwhile, a
sizeable number ofurban Iranians, although still a minority even inthe cities,
were coming toacquire astake in political stability and economic growth. This
minority within a minority was willing to forgo constitutional rights (which
perhaps had never meant much) for a place in the new Iran of the developers and
the land-speculators, and, more especially, in Tehran, that concrete jungle of
high-rise office-blocks and apartment-buildings, hemmed inby architecturally
eclectic villas and supposedly American-style suburban residences, with their
imported European furnishings. Evidence ofthe new order was manifested in
construction-projects, new apartment blocks, motorways, international hotels,
department stores andboutiques, andin the emerging new skyline which
conveyed the illusion of a thoroughly westernized capital.
The insistence on emulating the West is easy to deride, but it can be
understood as, in part, amechanism for escaping from the reality ofrepression.
Political energies were being channelled into desires for material improvement
and higher standards of living. Thus, bythe late 1950s, a small but growing
minority was enjoying a more comfortable and secure life than it had ever
known before. At the same time, expectations were being aroused, while fewat
the time perceived the cost involved indislocation and alienation inthe rapid
changes which they were witnessing. Gradually, however, the sharply rising
prices of basic commodities and urban rents, thecost of building-land and
house-construction, the rumours of prodigious waste of public money, includ
ing foreign aid, and the general corruption commensurate with the opportuni
ties for quick profits, which was said topenetrate deeply into the royal family,
began to instil a widespread mood of anxiety and disillusion.
Thus the Iqbal years saw both evidence ofmaterial progress and growing
social tension, although the latter was at first ignored. Eventually, murmurs of
discontent prompted the Shah toreact with cosmetic changes: new faces inthe
cabinet, conciliatory speeches, promises ofnew developments. Such measures
would merely dampen, but not eliminate unrest. The beginning of the 1960s was
a testing time both for the Shah's increasingly rigorous exercise of personal
government, and for the opponents of his regime. The crisis, when itcame, was
set off by the elections for the twentieth Majlis inthe late spring of i960. There

were signs that American attitudes towards Iran were veering in favour of
increased liberalization. Accordingly, the Shah seems tohave concluded that it
would be expedient toorganize a two-party system inparliament, possibly asa
genuine experiment with democracy, but also as window-dressing. The two
parties thus willed into existence were the Hi^b-i Milll (National Party) and,in
May 1957, the opposition Hi^b-i Mardum (People's Party), headed respectively
by Iqbal and by Asad-Allah cAlam, a close confidant of the Shah who was to play
a major role in Iranian public life until shortly before hisdeath in 1977. In
addition to candidates putforward by these two parties, some independent
candidates, including former members of the National Front, were permittedto
stand for election. Considerable opposition to the Iqbal government was
expressed during the campaign period. Particularly hard-hitting were the
speeches of Dr CA1I Aminl. His economist's training and experience in the
Cabinets of both Musaddiq and Zahidi gave weight to hiswords. He had
recently served as Iran's ambassador to the United States, but had been recalled
in 1958, for alleged involvement in plotting against the Shah's government. He
had, however, favourably impressed those in Washington who were anxious
about the course of events inIran and who believed that vigorous reform from
above, particularly land-reform, was the panacea forthe country's ills.
The months immediately preceding the elections of i960 saw a sharp rise in
the political consciousness of people who, since 1953, hadbeen cowed by
censorship and the fear ofGeneral Bakhtiyar's secret police. This reawakening
of widespread political consciousness had certainly not been the intention of the
government when itrevived party politics. When the results of the voting were
finally announced, it became obvious that the whole process had been rigged.
The two official parties had neatly distributed the seats between them. Public
expectations hadbeen sufficiently aroused for these results to produce an
indignant outcry. The Shah promptly voiced displeasure at the way the elections
had been conducted. The resignation of the newly-elected deputies and the Iqbal
cabinet followed. Iqbal was replaced byJacfar Sharlf-Imaml.29
The new cabinet, which assumed office in September i960, faced a very
difficult situation. The country was in an economic crisis. Foreign exchange
reserves were falling, and clearly austerity measures were needed to restrict
domestic credit, impose foreign exchange controls, and curb inessentialim
ports. Inflation was hurting all but the profiteers. Anger against speculators and
the extravagant nouveaux riches extended to members of the royal family. Foreign
commentators, especially in the United States, stressed the dangers of Iran being

unable to solve its internal difficulties. Glaring corruption, the misuse of foreign
aid, and the "feudal" land-system inthe countryside seemed toprovide fertile
soil for communism. Inside Iran, the scandal ofthe elections focused attention
on political remedies. Sharif-Imami's first task was to prepare for fresh elections
for the twentieth Majlis, but when it eventually metearly in 1961 in an
atmosphere of anticipation, it was still far from being a truly representative
assembly. The Hi%b-i Miltl had sixty-nine seats, the Hi^b-i Mardum sixty-four,
but there were also thirty-two independents whose presence, it was hoped,
would restore some vestige ofgenuine debate tothe Majlis. Among the latter
was Allahyar Salih, formerly Musaddiq's ambassador in Washington, as deputy
for Kashan and parliamentary spokesman for the National Front, which,
although no longer proscribed, continued toendure official harassment. Many
of its leaders had suffered imprisonment or exile, or had withdrawn from public
life inthe eight years since the coup d'etat of 195 3. However, between 1961 and
1963, there was a relaxation of the pressure applied to political opposition
groups, and the National Front re-formed around figures like Karim Sanjabi
and Daryush Furuhar, as well as younger men such as Shahpur Bakhtiyar. They
waited inthe vain hope that, asthe crisis deepened, the palace would summon
them. More significant than the new National Front inthe support which they
drew from some professional people and students, were two leading members of
the newly-founded Nah^at-i A^adl-ji Iran (Liberation Movement ofIran), the
French-educated engineer, Mahdl Bazargan, and the cleric, Sayyid Mahmud
Talaqani. Both advocated a radical Islamic socialism and were fearless in their
criticism ofthe regime.
Had the Shah felt free to act, hewould probably have swiftly silencedthe
disruptive debate on the central issues of Iranian political life which had
developed since the fiasco ofthe i960 elections. He had, however, to consider
his American friends. John F. Kennedy hadbeen inaugurated as the new
President ofthe United States inJanuary 1961, and sentiment in Washington
was running in favour of more democracy and reform in Iran. Thus there could
be no return to the autocratic style of the Zahidi period. The choice seemed to lie
between a National Front administration orone headed by DrCA1I Amini. As
the former was unacceptable tothe Shah, he chose the latter as the lesser evil.
Amini was the third and last of the post-war prime ministers who might have
initiated reforms within the constitutional framework which the Pahlavls had
systematically undermined intheir pursuit of absolute power.30 But he was not

to beallowed the opportunity to undertake the task forwhich he wassowell
equipped. TheShah, byallaccounts, hadlong distrusted this former protege of
Qavam and former colleague of Musaddiq, this aristocrat with radical views,
able, ambitious and outspoken, whowasa grandson ofboth MuzafTar al-Din
Shah andAmin al-Daula. Hehadserved hispolitical apprenticeship in thedays
of Qavam's ascendancy, andhadbeen very close tohim. He had held office in
Musaddiq's government as Minister of Finance (1951—2), and had displayed
both thepolitical sophistication andthepersonal charm to maintain open
communication with men atopposing ends of the political spectrum. Suchhad
been his reputation that, after Musaddiq's fall, Zahidi had turned to him to settle
the dispute with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and negotiate the establish
ment of the Consortium andtheNational Iranian OilCompany. Between1956
and 1958 he hadserved as Iranian ambassador inWashington andhadwon the
confidence ofthe Americans, a fact his sovereign could not ignore. Undoubt
edly, the United States exerted pressure to have Amini appointed premier.31
The Shah yielded, but seems to have determined to beridof him assoon as
possible.32
Ironically, it should have been possible forthe Shah to have developed a
constructive partnership with his newprime minister. Amini possessed, from
the monarch's point ofview, several real assets. He enjoyed the confidence of the
Americans, his appointment was seen asunexceptionable and many educated
Iranians held himinhigh esteem, while there wasnot attributed tohim either
Qavam's high-reaching ambitions or Musaddiq's unswerving hatred ofthe
Pahlavis. However, itwas tohis detriment that helacked the support ofany kind
of political organization, and hewasnot widely known tothe public at large.
Furthermore, like allpoliticians who were not part of the inner circle of the
court, he had enemies in high places, ready to take advantage of the Shah's
known dislike of him. His one trump-card was the assumed goodwill of the
Americans.
AMINI AS PRIME MINISTER, 1 9 6 1 - 2 : THE LAST CHANCE
Without the Shah's support, Amini's government was bound to fail, but itsbrief
tenure isofspecial interest, for it canbe argued that this wasthecountry's last
chance ofevolving along the path laid down bythe Constitutionalists of the
early 20th century, and within theinstitutional framework in which Qavam and
Musaddiq hadendeavoured togovern. Amini, like Musaddiq, recognized that

the inherent divisiveness and irresponsibility of the Majlis called for strong
remedies, if his ambitious programmes were to have any chance of success.
There was, however, a world of difference between his desire temporarily to
curtail parliamentary factionalism by substituting abrief period of government
by decree, andthe determination of both Pahlavi rulers to emasculate the
Constitution in their pursuit of absolute authority.
On the eve ofassuming office, Amini must have had noillusions asto the
difficulties confronting the new government. He was fully aware of the dangers
of inflation, high prices, the unfavourable balance ofpayments, and the weak
infrastructure ofthe economy. But throughout the weeks which had preceded
the fall of both the Iqbal and the Sharif-Imami governments, debate had centred
upon political ills and the necessity forpolitical remedies. Amini himself had
publicly condemned the tworecent elections and the electoral law which
allowed them to be rigged, and ithad been widely assumed that, were the Shah to
appoint him the new prime minister, he would insist upon the dissolution of the
present Majlis, to befollowed bynew elections under a revised electoral law.
Some assumed that a slight alteration of the Constitution to obtain a more
representative assembly would miraculously solve the country's problems.
This, however, ignored that fact that loopholes and abuses in the parliamen
tary system were not the only reasons for growing public frustration and anger.
The Majlis was not the only target ofsustained criticism. Resentment was also
directed towards the bureaucracy, inept and bloated; towards the entrepreneurs,
grown rich with government contacts; and, sotto voce, towards the pampered
officer corps and the court. There was aground-swell of indignation at what was
perceived to be ubiquitous corruption and profiteering in high places. The
demand was for reform at all levels, especially land-reform. There was also being
aired opposition towards the blatant pro-Western slant of the country's foreign
policy, together with calls for Third-World neutralism. But the issue which had
been the direct cause of the downfall of the Sharif-Imami government had beena
Tehran teachers' strike which had culminated in ademonstration in front of the
Majlis during which security forces had shot two demonstrators. Endingthe
strike, therefore, had to be the new government's highest priority. The teachers'
leader, Muhammad Darakhshish, aformer supporter of Musaddiq and a parlia
mentary deputy, was understood to be willing to work with the new
administration.
Amini understood the situation very well, but his forceful articulation of the
need for radical solutions necessarily exposed him to two dangers. Thefirstwas
the risk ofarousing expectations which could not be satisfied. The second was
272

AMINI AS PRIME MINISTER, 1961—2
that implementation of his programme would provoke bitter hostility among
landlords and entrepreneurs, who could expect to suffer from such measures as
land-reform and increasingly efficient tax-collection. The Times of London
commented that Amlni's first broadcast was
so forceful and sweeping that unless he quickly follows itup with remedial action he may have only armed the critics with arguments to fire back athim . . . His long description of the "plague" besetting the country, due towidespread corruption, misuse ofgovernmental positions, wastage of capital, and flouting of financial regulations, led him to a bleak conclusion. "Our financial and economic projects areat their last breath."33
Unrealistic hopes led todisappointment, and the initial announcement ofthe
composition of the Amini cabinet produced an anticlimax. Several ofthe
appointments won general approval, a few were virtually unknown, while four
Ministers were retained from the discredited previous administration, and allin
important posts: Foreign Affairs, War,the Interior and Commerce. These
reappointments may have been made atthe behest ofthe Shah. One outstanding
appointment wasthat of Dr Hasan Arsanjani as Minister of Agriculture. A
former National Front member andreformer of great energy andability, he
moved into prominence as the spokesman for the prime minister, and as
unofficial deputy leader. In time, the visibility which heacquired asarchitect of
the land reforms provoked the envy ofhis sovereign, who, himself determined
to assume therole of emancipator of the peasantry, forced this distinguished
politican out of office and into exile. Another appointment which caused
surprise was that of Nur al-DIn Alamutl asMinister of Justice. A judge with a
radical past, having been a member of the Tuda Party between 1941 and1945,
before drawing close to Qavam, it was said that theShah detested him.34 The
Education Ministry went to Darakhshish, an appointment indicative of the
priority which Amini gave to educational reform.
As soon as the cabinet wasappointed Amini took firm control. Political
demonstrations were banned in the interest of public order, while the Shah
announced the dissolution of the Majlis and ordered newelections under a
revised electoral law. Despite some disappointment at thecomposition of the
cabinet, the public sensed that the new government meant business, and
apparently enjoyed the support of the Shah. There was an atmosphere of
expectancy and some evidence of political debate in the press and amongst the
public. Despite the coup of 1953 and the events which followed it, neither
government censorship norSAVAK had yetsilenced completely the political
voice of the capital.

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH, 194.I-I979
The new government quickly settled the teachers' pay dispute, and the
schools reopened. Amlni then announced a far-reaching fifteen-point pro
gramme. Proposed reforms included the break-up of great estates, reduced
government spending, newtax laws with improved enforcement, a balance
between imports andexports, curbs on the import of luxury goods, greater
decentralization of the bureaucracy anda degree of local autonomy, reduced
inflation, improved education, andstrong anti-corruption measures. It was a
diverse programme, and pessimists suggested that no government could expect
to achieve success onso broad afront. The anti-corruption drive attracted much
public attention. Four generals were arrested on charges of embezzlement,
interference inelections and accumulating private fortunes from public funds.35
Ten senior officials in the Ministry of Justice were dismissed, and the Prosecu
tor-General announced that hisoffice would examine thedossiers of all mem
bers ofthe electoral councils of the last two elections, with aview to prosecuting
cases of gerrymandering or vote-rigging.
In Iran, anti-corruption drives invariably evoke scepticism. Public opinion
typically takes it forgranted that the wrong men orlow-level scapegoats willbe
held to account, while the real culprits andthose with influence will escape.
However, in the present instance, Amini's strong line and theensuing arrests
were taken seriously enough to cause restlessness within the officer corps at
what was taken to be a traducement of the army's honour. Arsanjani, as
government spokesman, publicly denied rumours of unrest in the armed
services. He declared that most officers were honourable and patriotic: rumours
to thecontrary were inspired by a minority who dreaded exposure, andwere
encouraged by landlords opposed to the government's policies. He also
reaffirmed that the government must either pursue its policy of introducing
peaceful but drastic land reform now, or face bloody revolution later. The
speech, however, was a reminder that the government was treading a very thin
line, hoping tointroduce radical changes while trying to avoid intervention by
the army or the Shah in favour of the statusquo.
As for the new government's foreign policy, the beneficiaries ofthe 1953 coup
were committed to ties with the West, especially the United States. Those

The government went out of its way, however, to assuage potential outrage among members ofthe officer corps by stressing that the charges related to exclusively non-service matters.

defeated in 1953, the supporters ofthe National Front and the now-outlawed
Tuda Party, favoured neutralism. Amlnl was widely regarded as aprotege of the
United States, buthiscabinet included men of National Front or left-wing
antecedents, who were presumed tofavour non-alignment and disengagement
from the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) into which the Shah had led
Iran in October 1955. Amini reaffirmed Iran's commitment to C E N T O but
admitted favouring improved relations with the U.S.S.R. Nevertheless, a shift
of direction inforeign policy was highly unlikely. The prime minister was well
disposed towards the United States and securing substantial American aid in the
current economic crisis was amatter of urgency. Moreover, itwas clear that the
Shah would nottolerate a shift in alliances. T o that extent, the international
scene was theleast of Amini's concerns.
More urgent was the need toimpress upon the public the seriousness ofthe
economic situation, andthereby to obtain acquiescence in a programme of
austerity. Amini's well publicized austerity-drive centred upon stricter import
controls on consumer goods, which, it wasreckoned, would produce an
improvement in the balance ofpayments oftwenty million pounds sterling in
three months. Restrictions on foreign travel andtheabolition of exchange
allowances to parents educating their children abroad were of more cosmetic
value. Apart from saving foreign currency, these measures were meant to show
the world thegovernment's determination. This was essential, since it was
estimated that the economy required some thirty to forty million dollars,
presumably from the United States, and further credit from the International
Monetary Fund, in order to emerge from thecrisis.
The government introduced various economy measures. Darakhshish's
reorganization of the Ministry of Education brought an annual saving of around
£1,500,000, while many abuses were discovered and publicized. These would
not have surprised the average Iranian, generally extremely cynical aboutthe
running ofthe country, but the publicity given to corruption and the govern
ment's attempts to curb it seemed to promise a fresh start.
Those affected by these activities, orthreatened by major changes, could do
little to attack a still popular administration, but they intrigued against it
whenever possible. However, strident criticism was also voiced by membersof
the National Front, some of whose ideas hadbeen adopted by the Amini
government. Thus, during this relatively liberal interlude of 1961—2, the
National Front constantly berated the government forits slowness to fulfil its
promises and its lack of constitutionality, demanding immediate elections.

This call for elections exposed the government's Achilles' heel. Amini was
vulnerable tothe charge that, unlike Iqbal orSharif-Imami, he lacked even the
pretence ofa parliamentary mandate. He was not insensitive tohis anomalous
situation. He asked the Shah to authorize elections for a new Majlis and
expressed the hope that anew Assembly would be convened within six months.
This short space oftime was not, however, sufficient for the passing ofa new
electoral law. Amini found himself trapped. On the one hand, the Constitution
required that parliament be reconvened within three months of dissolution. On
the other, heknew that while a reformed assembly was needed to achieve his
legislative goals, a change in the electoral law required parliamentary ratifica
tion, which was only possible when parliament was insession. Faced with this
dilemma, he settled for the appointment of a panel of jurists to recommend ways
of reforming the existing electoral system. Amini was not disloyal to the
Constitution: his entire career had shown his commitment to it.But until the
composition of the Majlis could be changed, it would not support his bold and
controversial proposals, while to continue ruling bydecree was to be prime
minister at the Shah's pleasure. Misrepresented either as a prime minister turned
autocrat in disregard ofthe Constitution, or asthe Shah's lackey, this manof
vision found himself increasingly hamstrung. Even so, he might have survived
much longer but for his very success in initiating land-reform andfor his
determination to prune the military budget.
By the early 1960s, there were few, other than conservatives, who did not
consider that some form of land reform would offer a national panacea.
Foreigners had been saying so for some time, and itwas widely believed that the
Kennedy White House saw land reform as asinequanonfor progress. The Shah
favoured it for thepolitical benefits which might accrue to him as a royal
reformer, freed from the constraints of having to consider landlord interests. No
politician orobserver could ignore the issue. Amini had no wish todo so. He
was infavour of far-reaching reforms, although he seems tohave seen theseas
long-term social goals rather than as the eye-catching expedients advocated by
royal advisers. Arsanjani's position resembled the prime minister's: he wanted
radical change, butknew that mismanaged reforms might prove worse than
useless.
It was clear that action of any kind could prove aPandora's Box. Practically
every Third World government which had attempted land reform had discov
ered that the consequences differed from the original intention. What appeared
straightforward as ablueprint had proved otherwise in practice. To be success
ful, cautious planning andskilled implementation were essential. Arsanjani

seems to have understood this, but had to act under the gaze of the national and
international press and the scrutiny of a monarch who desired the introduction
of programmes which would bring about profound changes without threaten
ing political destabilization, while enhancing the image of the ruler asa
progressive dedicated to his people. The Shah had to ensure that neither Amini
nor ArsanjanI acquired the popularity which he sought for the throne. For his
ministers, it was not aneasy assignment.
By 1961, the crown lands had been largely distributed to individuals who
were given twenty-five years to pay forthem, interest-free, at approximately
one-third ofthe current market value. Attention now shifted to government
lands already leased out toindividual farmers orleft uncultivated, and tolarge
estates still privately owned. The question of their distribution provoked heated
debate. Inthe first month ofits existence, the Amini government had decreed
limitations upon the size of individual holdings, a measure denounced as
unconstitutional and un-Islamic by Ayatullah Burujirdi. Undeterred, the gov
ernment continued on its course and by January 1962 had proclaimed the first
decree defining the nature of the land reform. Predictably criticized by right and
left, especially galling were thearguments of those who maintained that a
measure of such importance forthe country's future should have been intro
duced by parliamentary legislation, and not byroyal decree, the direct conse
quence of there being no Majlis insession. The National Front was particularly
vociferous inits attacks upon the government, seeming tofavour speedy land
reform inprinciple, but making no substantial proposals as alternatives to the
government's programmes.
Indeed, the National Front's response tothe government's policies went far
beyond disagreement about how land-reform should be implemented. A rough
and-ready appraisal of the political situation in 1962 revealed two significant
political groupings: the implicit alliance of court, conservatives and army under
the Shah; and what popular support the National Front could muster. If the
prime minister was not to appear the mere instrument of the Shah, he needed the
tacit endorsement of the National Front. The composition of the cabinet
suggests that Amini attempted toobtain this, but the Front grew more hostile,
either because its leaders did not trust Amini, seeing him as an American hireling
unlikely to pursue a non-aligned foreign policy, or as onewhose political
fortunes depended upon the Shah. National Front opposition became overt and
indirectly contributed to Amini's eventual downfall, confirming exactly what
the Shah wanted to know and what Amini's American supporters had to accept:
that the prime minister was politically isolated, and therefore expendable.

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH, I941-I979
The land-reform decree of January 1962 had fulfilled theAmini govern
ment's historical mission by inaugurating an agrarian revolution ofa kind, but
the end was very near. That month a student demonstration atTehran Univer
sity, inspired by National Front opposition tothe government, was crushed by
the army with extreme barbarity. Amini disclaimed all prior knowledge ofthe
decision to use such force against the students, which left either the Shah himself
or General Bakhtiyar, the head ofSAVAK, as the instigator ofthis atrocity. If
the Shah had been responsible, then the prime minister, by disassociating
himself from the decision, was, byimplication, laying the blame at the Shah's
door. If,on the other hand, Bakhtiyar had acted alone, itwould mean that he was
acting as aprovocateur\ seeking to be rid of the prime minister in order to take his
place. Amini demanded Bakhtiyar's removal and exile. The Shah, not yet ready
to dispose ofhis prime minister and perhaps fearful that the head of SAVAK
would become uncontrollable, dismissed Bakhtiyar. This act restored toAmini
some of the lustre lost in the previous months. The Shah also gained by showing
that he could control even the strongest of his officials. But the inherent conflict
of interest between Amini, with his programme of reform, and Muhammad Riza
Shah, with his concern forthe future ofthe monarchy, was reaching a climax.
The economy was still faltering, and Amini continued toinsist upon austerity
and cut-backs ingovernment spending. He even demanded massive reductions
in thearmy allocations. This, theShah would nottolerate. Amini therefore
resigned in July, complaining of insufficient American financial aid. Hemay
have believed that in aconflict with the Shah over the running of the country, he
could rely upon American support. Inthis he was wrong. Given the courseof
events, the Americans preferred tostay with what appeared tobe the one fixed
point in the bewildering Iranian firmament, theShah himself.
From the resignation ofAmini until the disintegration ofthe monarchy in
1978, Muhammad Riza Shah was more than ever theabsolute ruler of the
country. With Amini out of the way, the Shah could now assume the appealing
role ofroyal reformer, and the architect ofwhat hewas pleased to term "The
White Revolution." There was to be acalculated temporary cooling of relations
with the United States, while the Soviet Union was wooed in thehope of
reducing the barrage of hostile propaganda broadcast towards Tehran. To
project the image of emancipator of the peasantry from feudal bondage,the
Shah retained ArsanjanI for another year. He wished to preserve the appearance
of continuity, even though the land reform programme wasabout tobe
harnessed to hispolitical objectives, and thereby emasculated. A new prime
minister was already waiting in the wings, Asad-Allah cAlam, a longtime

confidant and acourtier. After Amlni, there were to be no more challenges from
the political establishment.
H E I R O F T H EA C H A E M E N I D S , I 9 6 2 —77
By the summer of1962, the Shah had reigned for twenty years. He had survived
assassination attempts, the plots ofhis enemies, flight abroad during the 195 3
coup, apervasive undercurrent of anti-royalist sentiment, and the hostility of his
Soviet neighbours. His survival had been chiefly due toAmerican support. As
an opportunist, he now proceeded with hisplans for hisso-called "White
Revolution", a grand design intended tomake him the ultimate beneficiary of
both his people's longing for material improvement andof the American
conviction that reforms were essential if further modernization were to be
achieved. He therefore promulgated asix-point reform programme such as had
originally been drafted by Amini in 1961, andsubmitted it to a national
plebiscite in January 1963. Apart from land reform, already in operation, the
other five points were: thesale of government-owned factories to provide
additional funding forbuying out great landlords; profit-sharing in industry;
the nationalization of forests; a new electoral law, including the enfranchisement
of women; and the creation ofa Literacy Corps, intended to take elementary
education into the rural areas not hitherto adequately reached bythe existing
system of state education. Predictably, being government-sponsored, the plebi
scite was overwhelmingly affirmative. Inview, however, ofthe government's
claim that the result was a vote of confidence in theShah's policies, it was
embarrassing that massive anti-plebiscite demonstrations and riots took place.
The government derided this opposition as "black reaction", the work of a
handful ofreactionary clerics opposed tothe extension ofwomen's rights and
the prospect oflosing vaqf income. The opposition was in fact much broader
than either the government admitted orforeign observers realized. It objected
not so much to reform as to the way in which the Shah was using the widespread
desire forsocial amelioration to legitimize his autocracy.
The new National Front chose toboycott the plebiscite: it considered that
such important measures should be ratified by the Majlis. Its actions, however,
were of little importance, for its leaders were soon afterwards imprisoned,
thereby revealing their political impotence. From this time, the National Front
was ofonly marginal significance as apolitical force. But one group, formerly
linked with theNational Front, remained vigorous. This was the Nah'%at-i
A^adi-yi Iran (Liberation Movement ofIran) founded by the deeply religious

layman, Mahdi Bazargan,36 and the progressive cleric, Sayyid Mahmud
Talaqani.37
Significant opposition to the White Revolution came not from the National
Front, but from a broad-based alliance of the discontented. In June 1963,
"thousands of shopkeepers, clergymen, office employees, teachers, students,
wage earners, and unemployed workers poured into the streets to denounce the
Shah".38 These demonstrations lasted three days, occurring inTehran and all
major provincial towns. They were ferociously suppressed and the government
held firm: there was no general strike, no disruption in the oil fields, no unrest
among the armed services. Thenumber of dead is still uncertain, and many more
were imprisoned and tortured. Henceforth, naked force ruthlessly stamped out
all opposition, while the Shah continued to pursue his grandiose schemes. After
1963, itseemed that only revolution could end the systematic violence so freely
indulged in by the regime.
In the protests of1963, the religious authorities emerged for the first time in
Muhammad Riza Shah's reign as the leaders of a broad alliance of opponents of
the regime. Some clerical spokesmen were already well-known opponentsof
despotism and advocates of an Islam which combined progressive and socialist
ideals with traditional religious and ethical values. Chief among these were
Talaqani and Ayatullah Sayyid AbuDl-Fazl Miisavl Zanjani from Azarbaijan,
who had been asupporter of Musaddiq. Others, such as Ayatullah Muhammad
Had! Milan! and Ayatullah Sayyid Muhammad Kazim Sharicatmadari, eschewed
politics but were concerned atthe Shah's disregard for the Constitution, the
revival of militaristic attitudes characteristic of the worst years of Riza Shah's
despotism, and the brutal repression committed by the regime. Even political
36 Mahdi Bazargan (1906-), a merchant's son from Azarbaijan, was trained in Paris as a civil engineer and became ateacher in the Tehran College ofScience and Technology. He did not become politically active until after Riza Shah's abdication. In October 1941, he founded the Engineers' Association and participated in theestablishment of the Hi^b-i Iran (Iran Party). 37 Sayyid Mahmud Talaqani (1910-79) was the son ofa cleric who had supported the Constitution and had suffered for his opposition toRiza Shah. During the early 1930s, the son studied at the Faizlya madrasa and between 1938 and 1940 worked as a secondary-school teacher in Tehran. In 1940, he was given the first ofmany jail sentences for criticizing the regime. Between 1949 and 1953 he was an ardent supporter of Musaddiq, and when KashanI and other clerical supporters of the prime minister abandoned him in 1953, Talaqani remained loyal. Forced to withdraw from active politics after the coup,hewrote two influential tracts, maintaining that Shicism was irreconcilable with despotism because its nature was essentially democratic, and that Islam and socialism were not incompatible, since God had not created the world for it to be polarized between "haves" and "have nots". Among leading clerics, Talaqani's following was especially strong among the urban poor and the young, and his writings were much read and admired by the Mujahidin-i Khalq and their supporters. Just prior tohis death (9 September 1979) he had polled the greatest number of votesin the elections for theMajlis-i Khibragan (Assembly of Experts).

conservatives such as Ayatullah Muhammad Bihbahani and Ayatullah Abd
Allah ChilsutunI seem to have felt disquiet at the direction events were taking.
More imposing than any of these, however, as an opposition leader of national
stature was the charismatic Ruh-Allah Khumainl.
Born in 1902, and now sixty-one, he came from a modest landowning and
clerical family from Khumain, not far from Gulpaygan. Educated at Arak and
Qum, he taught at the Faiziya madrasa in the latter city, establishing close links
with Ayatullah Burujirdi, the current Marjac-i Taqlid. During the Musaddiq
years, when Ayatullah Kashani dominated clerical politics, Khumainl seems to
have maintained an apolitical posture. He was presumably unsympathetic to
Musaddiq's secular aims for Iran, probably considering that the premier leaned
excessively towards the Tuda Party; but more importantly, his links with the
quietist Burujirdi must have restrained him from active participation in politics.
But after Burujirdl's death in 1962, that constraint was removed. Thereafter, he
became an outspoken critic of the regime, fiercely denouncing the fraudulent
referendum of January 1963. The government retaliated with a brutal assault by
paratroopers on the Faiziya madrasa, killing a number of students and ransack
ing the building. This punitive action, the claims made for the White Revol
ution, the government's dependence upon the United States, and its support for
Israel provided Khumainl with grounds for a broad-fronted attack upon the
regime. The government, loud in its denunciation of the "black reaction" of the
clergy, had dubbed both culama and theological students as parasites. On 3 June
1963, Khumainl replied:
Now, these students of the religious sciences who spend the best and most active part of their lives in these narrow cells, and whose monthly income is somewhere between 40 and 100 tumans - are they parasites? And those to whom one source of income alone brings hundreds of millions of tumans are not parasites? Are the culama parasites - people like the late Hajj Shaykh cAbd al-Karim, whose sons had nothing to eat on the night that he died; or the late Burujirdi, who was 600,000 tumans in debt when he departed from this world? And those who have filled foreign banks with the wealth produced by the toil of our poverty-stricken people, who have erected towering palaces but still will not leave the people in peace, wishing to fill their own pockets and those of Israel with our resources they are not parasites? Let the world judge, let the nation judge who the parasites are!39
39 Khomeini, Islam and Revolution, p. 178. After the March 1963 attack upon the Faiziya, the Shah went to Qum, where he denounced the religious authorities as "Black reactionaries" and as "Sodomites and agents of the British". The four senior Ayatullahs in Qum, Gulpaygani, Khumain!,
Marcashlal-Najafiand Sharfatmadari then protested this defamation of the culama, as did Ayatullah Milan! and Ayatullah Tabataba°I-yi Qumm! in Mashhad. Milan! commented subsequently, "The son was like the father . . . Only he was more vulgar and lacked the moral courage of Reza Shah." Quoted in Taheri, The Spirit of Allah, p. 136.

This wasextraordinarily courageous, and it wasfor such courage that
Khumaini won nationwide adulation. Many had thought the same way: only he
dared to utter thewords.
The dayafter he made this speech, Khumaini was arrested and taken to
Tehran. He was released in August 1963, and the government announced that he
and other leading clerical opponents had agreed to abstain from further political
activities. Denying the existence of this agreement, Khumaini proceeded to urge
a boycott of the elections scheduled for October 1963. He was again imprisoned,
and not released until May 1964, but by then his name had become a household
word. InOctober, a public issue arose which was perfectly suited to engaging
him in a cause with which the majority of Iranians could identify. T w o
government bills were before the Majlis. One concerned atwo-hundred million
dollar loan from the United States to purchase military equipment from that
country. The other, obviously linked toit, extended diplomatic immunity toall
American military and technical personnel and their families in Iran. O n 27
October 1964, Khumaini attacked these bills before acrowd assembled in front
of his house in Qum. In thecourse of his speech, he said,
If some American's servant, some American's cook, assassinates your marja in the middle of the bazaar, or runs over him, the Iranian police donothave theright to apprehend him! Iranian courts do not have the right to judge him! The dossier must be sent to America, so that our masters there can decide what is to be done! [. . .]They have reduced the Iranian people to a level lower than that of an American dog. If someone runs over adog belonging toan American, he will be prosecuted. Even if the Shah himself were to run over a dog belonging toanAmerican, he would be prosecuted. But if an American cook runs over the Shah, the head of state, noone will have the right to interfere with him.
Why? Because they wanted aloan and America demanded this in return [.. .]Iran has sold itself to obtain these dollars. The government has sold our independence, reduced us to the level of a colony, and made the Muslim nation of Iran appear more backward than savages in the eyes of the world!40
Arrest swiftly followed, and on 4 November 1964, he was exiled to Turkey.
He was subsequently permitted to go to Najaf in Iraq, which, as theIranian
government might have foreseen, was an ideal residence for aclerical opponent
of the regime. The Shicl shrine-cities ofIraq had a history ofsheltering culama
opposed to tyrannical Shahs. Najaf, with its large ShIcI population, regularly
reinforced by numbers ofpilgrims from Iran, provided Khumaini with a ready

audience for hissermons, and with agents at hand to smuggle pamphlets and
cassette-recordings into Iran.
But in Tehran, inthe mood ofeuphoria which followed the inauguration of
the White Revolution, what was regarded asthedemagoguery of a turbulent
cleric did not disturb the complacency ofeither senior government officials or
foreign observers. The Shah considered that his policies were winning the
approbation ofhitherto sceptical supporters abroad. Athome, opposition was
silenced byforce and drowned in a flood ofofficial propaganda. The Shah had
surrounded himself with men whom he could trust to obey him. While the prime
minister, cAlam, kept thelow profile befitting a royal servant, the monarch's
self-confidence and arrogance increased visibly. Meanwhile, foreign capital
flowed in, responding to international press reports of the success of land reform
and foreign assessments of Iran's capacity to equip itself forthe 21st century.
The international Press carried photographs ofHis Imperial Majesty opening a
new dam or a new highway, inspecting an agricultural research institute, or
trying out new pieces of military equipment. Foreigners, mainly American, were
commissioned to submit plans for rapid modernization. Advisers and experts
crowded into the country. Their presence drove uprents and servants' wages,
and their salaries provoked envy. Bythe late 1970s, they were numbered in
thousands. Imported consumer goods also poured in,to the pecuniary advan
tage of customs personnel andretailers. The latter sold them at prices many
times their value in their country of origin. Fortunes were being made, especially
in imports, urban real estate, andthe construction industry. Everyonewho
could afford it,and many who could not, aspired to live insuburban affluence.
Exhilarated byhisself-perception as a royal modernizer, Muhammad Riza
Shah now decided torevive the system ofofficial political parties competingfor
favour, despite the fact that his earlier attempts had not proved conspicuously
successful. Hence, the Hi^b-i Iran-i Novln (New Iran Party) was formed,
supposedly as the voice of a new pro-western generation of technocratic
politicians. TheHi^b-i Mardum wasretained as its sparring-partner. cAlam
resigned aspremier early in 1964 but remained close to the Shah asMinister of
Court. He was replaced by the leader of the Hi^b-i Iran-i Novln, Hasan cAli
Mansur, young, personable and articulate, but his tenure ofoffice (March 1964
January 1965) was toprove brief. He was assassinated bya member ofa group
apparently linked with theoutlawed Fida°iyan-iIslam, an event which, taken
with anattempt upon the Shah's life a few months later, was a reminder of the
deep undercurrents ofhostility tothe regime which continued to flow through

obscure and murky channels. The Shah, however, preferred tobelieve that his
only serious opponents were the communists, a term which he applied to anyone
who questioned his policies or his goals forthe country. Mansur's place was
taken byAmir cAbbas Huvaida, deputy-chairman of the Hi^b-i Iran-i Novln,
who was to hold thepremiership longer than anyother twentieth-century
Iranian prime minister (January 1965—July 1977). His opponents dismissed him
as the Shah's mouthpiece, but others discerned the complex personality ofthe
survivor, until he finally succumbed to his master's need fora scapegoat and
later became one of the first prominent victims of the revolution.
The Huvaida years (at least until the mid-1970s) seemed like a halcyon time of
economic growth and apparent stability, with thespectacular increase in oil
revenues after 1973 resulting in vast government spending. There was no
political life inthe conventional sense of the word, and the repression was such
that frustrated young men andwomen, lacking other channels for protest,
turned to terrorism. Several small urban guerilla movements appeared, the two
most prominent being the Fidc?lyan-i Khalq (Selfless Devotees for the People),
broadly Marxist in inspiration, and the Mujahidin-iKhalq(Holy Warriors for the
People), whose tenets were both Islamic and socialistic, reflecting the influence
of Talaqani.41 The activities of such groups never came near to undermining the
self-confidence of the regime, or seriously disrupting it. They did, however,
keep alive acommitment tothe overthrow of tyranny, and toarmed resistance,
which made them the harbingers of the later revolutionary struggle. The regime
hated them with an intensity it expended upon no other foes. When captured,
the guerillas, men and women alike, were relentlessly tortured and their mortal
ity rate was very high.42
Apart from the irritant ofguerilla activities, which naturally did not receive
much publicity, the regime now enjoyed almost universal acceptance. It was a
staunch ally of the West and afavourite protege of the United States, but it also
maintained relatively good relations with the Soviet Union and China (with
which formal diplomatic ties were established in 1973). The Shah's international
visibility, the constant flow of distinguished visitors tohis court, and his much
publicized reciprocal state visits abroad provided his regime with the
legitimation and the respectability which he had long sought. His ultimate effort
in this direction was thecostly celebration of what was publicized as two

HEIR OF THE ACHAEMENIDS, 1962-77
thousand five hundred years ofIranian monarchy, ofwhich his reign was to
mark the culminating phase. In retrospect, the Persepolis "party" of1971, as it
came to becalled derisively, appears to have marked the beginning ofan
obsession with personal aggrandisement and with military might which sub
stantiallv contributed to the Shah's eventual overthrow. The heartless extrava
gance in acountry where the majority of the population still lived in grinding
poverty, and the vulgarity of this pretentious display of "the pompe of Persian
kings", made even those foreigners who were impressed by the Shah's record,
wonder atsuch evidence of megalomania. Few foreign observers understood
the depth of the unvoiced contempt felt by theIranian people. Once again, it was
the exile in Najaf who most eloquently expressed those feelings in his denunci
ation of "these frivolous and absurd celebrations" and ofthe violence and
tyranny characteristic of the rule of Shah after Shah. According to theProphet of
Islam, he declared, "thetitle of King of Kings . . . is the most hated of all titles in
the sight of God. Islam is fundamentally opposed to the whole notion of
monarchy."43
The event to which KhumainI referred was closely followed by three
developments which brought the Shah to the pinnacle of personal hubris^ but
which also unwittingly hastened his fall. First, in that same year of1971, as a
result of Great Britain's withdrawal from hertraditional role of policeman ofthe
Persian Gulf, the Shah volunteered to take over in place of the British, an offer
which they and the Americans accepted with alacrity. This conferred upon Iran
the status ofa regional power, provided that she could acquire the military
might to sustain the role. It washere that the United States proved so helpful. In
May 1972, President Nixon and Secretary of State Kissinger flew to Tehran fora
brief but momentous meeting with the Shah. Its outcome was to enhance the
Shah's international standing even further, for before his guests left, they had
assured him that he could purchase whatever weapons he wanted from the
United States, nuclear weapons excepted. This placed Iran in aunique position
among America's allies, and the Shah now had carte-blanche toindulge in his
"obsession with everything that flies and fires".44 All that was missing wasthe
means, but once this was found, the third link in the chain would be forged.
During 1973, the Shah made itplain that he was not satisfied with the current
43 Khomeini, op. cit., p. 202. 44 The phrase is quoted from anentry in the diary ofthe Iranian ambassador to Great Britain, written on 9 September 1978, inwhich he criticizes the Shah for "his false priorities and disastrous economic policies, his military grandiosity and obsession with everything that flies and fires, his unquenchable thirst for flattery and his breathtaking insensitivity to the feelings of his own people, his vainglory and his ceaseless lecturing . . .

level of oil prices. Prudently, he did not join the Arab states in their blackmail of
the industrialized world, but he insisted that, inhis view, the West was paying
too little fora diminishing resource. In any event, Iran benefited, along with
every other oil producer, from the Arab embargo and the subsequent rise in oil
prices. In this way, theShah now acquired themeans to embark upon an
incredible programme of arms procurement and the purchase ofanything else
which took his fancy.
Yet even during the first half of the 1970s, doubts were being expressed
abroad regarding the premises upon which the Shah's Tamaddun-i Bu^urg(Great
Civilization) rested. In the United States, in the wake of the Vietnam War, there
was increasing scepticism as to the desirability of supporting repressive dictator
ships which lacked popular backing, despite the assumption that the Shah's land
reforms had won him widespread support at home. He certainly received ashare
of the blame for the increase inoil prices which led tothe inflation of themid
seventies. Moreover, after Watergate, the American press developed a sharp
nose for smelling out unsavoury goings-on, and corporate dealings with Iran,
especially inthe area ofweapons sales, came under close scrutiny. Gradually,
criticism of the Shah's regime, formerly deemed irresponsible and not conduc
ive to western interests, became more outspoken. In particular, accounts of
internal repression, and the torture and execution of opponents by SAVAK,
began to receive widespread attention.45 Amnesty International's 1975 report
on the treatment ofpolitical prisoners in Iran was extensively covered inthe
European and American Press, and in March 1975, an article in TheSunday Times
of London reported that "no country in the world has aworse record in human
rights than Iran".46
Anti-Shah demonstrations by Iranian students at foreign universities at
tracted support ontheir host campuses, especially in West Germany and the
United States, and informed academic opinion began to swing in thesame
direction. In 1969, Bahman Nirumand had published an indictment of the
regime which constituted the first attack upon the Shah's record easily accessible
in English. In the mid 1970s, the writings of the poet, Riza Barahinl, as a prisoner
of conscience, attracted considerable interest. Two books ofhis published in

THE COMING OF THE REVOLUTION, 1977-8
English, God's Shadow (1976) andThe CrownedCannibals(1977), revealed for
those willing to be convinced the hideous reality behind the glittering facade.In
the months preceding the revolution, what had formerly been no more than a
trickle of protest became a swelling stream. Ironically, growing American
scepticism regarding conditions inIran was probably heightened by the public
relations activities of the Iranian mission in Washington, where the ambassador
was the son of the man who had ousted Musaddiq in 195 3. The gossip columns,
on the one hand, revelled in accounts of lavish and ostentatious parties hostedat
the ambassador's residence while, onthe other hand, elsewhere in the press,
there were grim reports from Tehran ofextensive poverty, an ever-widening
gulf between rich and poor, and the growing unpopularity of the government.
All this contributed to widening the credibility gap.
Thus, by the mid-1970s, the Shah's image was becoming tarnished. American
opinion no longer viewed him as an indispensable bulwark against communism
on an exposed flank. The increase inoil prices and the Shah's habitual criticism
of the West for its shortcomings and its onset of decadence increasingly irritated
a public well-informed asregards the Iranian government's extravagance, the
record of internal repression, corruption in high places, and the general misman
agement of the country's resources. Behind the ballyhoo of an imperial Iranian
renaissance it was now possible todiscern the realities of under-development,
poverty, slums and shanty-towns, malnutrition and illiteracy. This growing
awareness raised the question as to how far American public opinion, especially
after theelection of President Carter in 1976, would be willing to support
intervention on behalf of its Iranian client, should the need arise. The conflicting
points ofview of American policy-makers as tohow torespond tothe crisis of
1978 reflected what had become bythen a thoroughly ambiguous climate of
opinion in Washington vis-a-visthe Pahlavl regime.

In the opening months of 1977, on the eve of the revolution, it seemed as if the
Pahlavl autocracy had attained the apogee ofpower and prestige. Yet beneath
the surface all was far from well. The anticipated economic miracle had failed to
materialize, leaving expectations unfulfilled, while the government, despiteits
rhetoric, became more and more enmeshed in flawed planning and bumbling
implementation. The Shah's preoccupation with creating a military establish
ment worthy of a great power involved not only digging deep into the
enormous post-1973 oilrevenues, but also further distorting the economy by

drawing into thearmed services and away from thecivilian sector suchfew
technical skills andsuch little "know-how" as were available. This further
diminished the pool ofskilled labour and necessitated the recruitment ofcostly
foreign experts. Meanwhile, the Western industrialized nations were respond
ing tothe rise inoil prices by further raising the price oftheir consumer goods
and services, anuntoward development which infuriated the Shah, and which
produced a spiralling pattern of inflation. It was becoming clear that the Shah's
determination to transform Iran into afully industrialized country at breakneck
pace was placing tremendous strain upon an over-extended economy, which
was suffering simultaneously from inefficient and wasteful management, mas
sive corruption, and social dislocation.
For ordinary Iranians, the consequences of the Shah's megalomaniac dreams
were rising prices, shortages of food and other basic items, lack of adequate
housing, the breakdown of essential services, and rising unemployment among
the unskilled, exacerbated bythe drift ofthe rural poor into the fast-growing
urban slums and shanty-towns. For the middle classes, the cost and scarcityof
urban housing was perhaps the most serious cause of complaint, and they
blamed the presence offoreign workers and their families as the prime cause of
both inflationary rents and actual shortages. Ofall foreigners, theAmericans
tended tobe the most conspicuous, and while their high standard ofliving was
bitterly resented, it was also widely believed that they were occupying jobsfor
which there were Iranians already qualified, orones for which Iranians should
be trained. The ubiquitous American presence also contributed to the notion
that the Shah was little better than a puppet ofthe United States' government.
The tide of popular xenophobia was running unusually strong.
While American, European and Japanese corporations were rushing tosell
the Iranian government and Iranian entrepreneurs whatever they wanted,the
road, rail and port facilities were on the verge ofcollapse, unable tohandle the
burden ofincoming freight. The Gulf ports were brought toa standstill, with
lines ofships waiting inthe roadsteads tounload onto congested jetties cargoes
which could then only beshifted to equally congested rail-sidings or loading
bays. In any case, much of the industrial plant and sophisticated equipment
being acquired was beyond thecapabilities of most technicians to work or
maintain.
While the Shah dreamed of making Iran amilitary power the equal of any but
the two Super Powers, the country could nolonger feed itself. As a result of
increased population, changes in dietary habits and the poor performance of the
agricultural sector, Iran had now become a massive importer offoodstuffs. In
288

consequence, food prices rose sharply. Land reform had not made agriculture
more efficient orproductive. Now, as part ofthe preoccupation with modern
ization atany price, agrobusinesses were introduced inanattempt to increase
productivity. Yet where these were setup, they failed to produce sufficient
quantities of foodstuffs to bring down prices, while the concomitant contraction
of the agricultural labour-force further disrupted the traditional village econ
omy and hastened the flood of pauperized peasants to the cities.
Historians will long debate the remote and immediate causes ofthe Iranian
revolution, but it isprobable that most future analyses will include among the
contributory factors Muhammad Riza Shah's obsession with accelerated devel
opment beyond the country's capacity to absorb it, and with the creation of
armed forces which the country did not need and could not pay for; pervasive
corruption, which permeated the highest levels of government, and which bred
envy and resentment among those who could not share in it; and the disenchant
ment and alienation of the young and the educated. To these must be added the
Shah's contemptuous disregard for the traditional religious culture of his
subjects; his equally contemptuous rejection of meaningful participation inthe
political process by apopulation made increasingly familiar through education
and the mass-media with life in democratic Western societies; and the ferocious
repression which was directed mindlessly against all opponents or critics of the
regime.
In considering the various factors which contributed to making Iran ripe for
revolution, two further developments must be taken into account: the Shah's
decision in 1975 to found asingle, monolithic party to serve as awatchdog over
both government and society in the interests of the "Shah and People's
Revolution", and the move towards greater liberalization, which heinitiated
two years later. The decision to found a new party, Hi^b-i Rastakbl%-z Iran
(Resurgence Party ofIran), was preceded early in 1975 by the abolition ofthe
Hi^b-i Iran-i Novln and the Hi^b-i Mardum, Tweedledum and Tweedledee in the
art of obsequiousness. The object now was to create a one-party system in
which, in theory, the entire society was supposed to participate, in order to
hasten the goals of the "Shah and People's Revolution", of which the Rastakhiz
Party would become the official mouthpiece, functioning in much the same way
as other totalitarian parties. Those who refused to join the new organization
were, inthe Shah's view, communists ortraitors, for whom there could beno
place in the new Iran: for such persons, there were only two alternatives, jail or
exile.
Thereafter, a party organization was soon set up by self-seeking zealots
289

THE PAHLAVI AUTOCRACY: MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH, I 9 4 I - I 9 7 9
whose activities alienated all those Iranians who were brought into contact with
it and who immediately recognized it for what it was, an opportunist deviceto
monitor and interfere in their lives to an even greater extent than the regime had
done heretofore. In particular, intellectuals, ba^arls and culama were targeted for
harassment. In fact, the Rastakhiz Party was the ultimate folly which fuelled the
fires of popular resentment, and itis likely that the reversal of the Shah's policies
two years later, which permitted relatively open debate on matters of public
concern, was inresponse tothe swelling undercurrents of discontent provoked
by Rastakhiz activists.
It is possible that the Shah may have come to feel that the men with whom he
had surrounded himself had failed him. He was later tocomplain, ingenuously,
that his advisers had cut him off from his people. There was also the matter of his
failing health, still a close-kept secret. Finally, there was the new man in the
White House, an unknown factor but adeclared libertarian who had spoken out
unequivocally regarding human rights. Throughout 1977, therefore, the
Iranian government displayed anunprecedented willingness to tolerate criti
cism. Representatives of the Red Cross were allowed toinspect certain prisons,
and foreign lawyers were allowed to bepresent at the trials of some political
dissidents. Former leaders of the National Front, jurists, professors and leading
intellectuals were permitted to air their grievances in open letters and communi
cations to the Press. There were demands for the restoration of the Constitution
of 1906 (upheld inname but subverted infact by the Pahlavis), the rule of law
and the democratic process, while censorship, police harassment and the activi
ties of SAVAK agents and Rastakhiz officials were loudly excoriated. Mean
while, and largely unknown to middle-class liberal protesters, the sermons in the
mosques and the rumours in the bazaars were becoming increasingly subver
sive, fuelled by cyclostyled letters and sermons oncassettes smuggled into the
country from Najaf, where Ayatullah Khumaini was denouncing the godless
tyranny of the Shah, agent of United States' and Israeli imperialism.
Even aslate as 1977 it seems that neither the Shah nor his security forces
diagnosed a serious threat from organized religion. The activities of the reli
gious "Left" were doubtless well known to SAVAK. There were, in Iran itself,
the Mujahidin-i Khalq, with their support coming mainly from students and
their ideology from the writings of Talaqani, Ayatullah Murtaza Mutahhari
(1920-79) and Dr All sharfati (1933-77).47 Abroad, there were those students,
of whom AbuDl-Hasan Ban! Sadr and Sadiq Qutbzada in Paris were not

untypical, who rather idiosyncratically melded theteachings of Islam with
ideological borrowings from the European Left. The first were to be liquidated;
the second, watched and, when appropriate, harassed.
Of more conservative enemies, especially among the culama, the government
appears to have known far less, or else rated them no serious danger. Neverthe
less, since the crisis of1962—3, SAVAK had not hesitated to persecute clerics or
theological students whom it deemed irreconcilable. Some (like Ayatullah
Muhammad Riza Sacidi, who dared toraise his voice against further American
investment in Iran) were tortured to death, while others, who survived, were so
brutally handled that they never fully recovered. Talaqanfs unlooked-for death
in 1979 may have been due to the appalling treatment which he had earlier
received at the hands of his interrogators. Many of the leading clerics of the
revolutionary period had first-hand experience of the Shah's prisons. Neverthe
less, by the close of1977, despite the fact that the best known clerical opponents
of the regime were either in exile, as inthe case of Khumaini, or in prison, as in
the case of TalaqanI, the work of creating anunderground network of like
minded enemies ofthe government was proceeding rapidly. Former pupilsof
Khumaini, such as Mutahhari and Muntaziri, were disseminating his teachings
and forming the infrastructure for future revolutionary activity through a web
of associations — madrasas^ mosques, hafats (informal groups meeting to discuss
religious matters) andhusainlyas(religious clubs for staging the Muharram
passion plays) — of which the security forces were apparently unaware.
Among the senior clerics, attitudes ranged from quietist non-involvement in
politics to outspoken opposition to the government. In Qum, with Khumaini in
exile, thethree resident Marjac-i Taqlid (Sources of Emulation), Ayatullah
Muhammad Riza Gulpaygani, Ayatullah Shihab al-DIn Marcashi al-Najaf!, and
Ayatullah Sayyid Kazim Sharlcatmadarl, acted as an informal triumvirate. Not
one of them could be described as an activist, inthe way Khumainf clearly was,
but all three had been scarred by the events of 1962—3 and subsequent happen
ings. TheAzerbaijani, Sharlcatmadarl, enjoyed a justifiable reputation for
sanctity andlearning. Benign in appearance, andgentle andpersuasive in
manner, he was a patrician cleric who only gradually and grudgingly came to
acknowledge the necessity for active participation by the culama in the engulfing
crisis of the time. Even so, he foresaw and dreaded the inevitable compromises,
entanglements, and ultimate loss of spiritual freedom which were bound to
accompany clerical involvement in the day-to-day business of running a govern
ment. It was tobe his personal tragedy that, apprehensive atthe notion ofthe
culama seizing thecommanding heights of the revolutionary struggle,and

willing to keep all channels of communication open for negotiation, he would be
so swiftly upstaged by the vehemence and certainty ofpurpose ofthe clerical
activists.
If any one event can be said to mark the beginning of the Iranian Revolution,
it was the publication of an article in the Tehran daily, Ittilacat, on7 January
1978, grossly vilifying Ayatullah Khumaini. It obviously originated very high
up in the government and the editor o£lttilacat was instructed to print it without
alteration. Within amatter of hours, the newspaper's offices had been ransacked
by an outraged mob. Two days later, in Qum, acrowd of perhaps five thousand,
many of them theological students, assembled in the shrine to protest at the
insult directed against the man who was not only the symbol of resistance to the
government but also arevered spiritual leader. The list of demands read out on
that occasion — implementation of the Constitution, freedom of speech, freedom
for political prisoners, freedom to form religious associations, an end of
censorship and police violence, the dissolution of the Rastakhlz Party, etc.
constituted most of the proclaimed goals of the opposition during the early
months of1978, although itwould not be long before they would be replaced by
more radical ones. Then, when the crowd began toleave the shrine, shouting
anti-government slogans, the police were waiting for them and opened fire.
Some died instantaneously; others, later, from gunshot wounds. It was alleged
that the security forces refused to allow blood to be donated atlocal hospitals,a
recurring accusation throughout the coming months.
As the senior Marjac-I Taqlidc inQum, it fell toAyatullah Sharicatmadari to
voice the public outrage atthis atrocity, which he did promptly and unambigu
ously. For the government to authorize such action was, in his judgment, clearly
unlslamic. He declared amoratorium on public prayers and threatened to leada
funeral procession ofthe coffins ofthe victims tothe gates ofthe royal palace.
Most important of all, the traditional forty days of mourning were to be
observed in all major cities, thereby initiating those cyclical waves of protest and
violence which regularly punctuated the course of the following months,
beginning inTabriz on 18—19 February, when anger and resentment on behalf
of the "martyrs" ofQum led toattacks on banks and liquor shops, symbolsof
Westernization, and the offices of the hated Rastakhlz Party. The police, taken
unawares, called in the army to assist them, and violent confrontation led to
further deaths, which in turn ushered in another forty-day period of mourning.
So itcontinued. During the course of protracted demonstrations inQum on10
May, a brutal assault was launched on the house of Ayatullah Sharicatmadari bya
band of paratroopers, allegedly led bytheir commander, General Manuchihr

THE COMING OF THE REVOLUTION, 1977-8
Khusraudad, in person. The Ayatullah was away from home, but two theologi
cal students who were present and who refused toshout "Long Live the Shah"
were shot dead.
The authorities were clearly caught by surprise by the large numbers, as well
as by the determination and discipline of the demonstrators who appeared on the
streets during the course ofthese periods ofmourning. But the fact was that,
during the preceding decade, the urban population, in provincial centres no less
than in Tehran, had grown enormously, as floods of migrants from an impover
ished and neglected rural hinterland poured into them insearch of work. With
the economic boom over and unemployment rising, these migrants, whether
single male workers or whole households, found themselves in a chilling
economic climate, cut off from the comforting certainties of village life and the
support of an extended kinship structure. Alone in an unfamiliar world of urban
slums and shanty-towns, without resources and without hope, they naturally
gravitated for comfort and assistance tothe local mosque or hafat. It was from
these musta^afin, these deprived and dispossessed, as KhumainI called them,
that there came alarge part of the huge crowds which, as the revolution gained
momentum, took over the streets, seemingly indifferent to the threat of police or
army retaliation. With the recurring cycles ofmourning, inwhich demonstra
tors participated in ever-increasing numbers, the revolutionary struggle became
a mass movement in which the existing forms of government, and eventually the
Shah himself, were swept away. He left the country on 16 January 1979, thereby
paving the way forthe return of Ayatullah KhumainI on 1February andthe
eventual proclamation ofan Islamic Republic. The Shah died in Egypt on 27
July 1980, an exile ashis father had been.

CHAPTER 8
IRANIAN RELATIONS WITH THE OTTOMAN
EMPIRE IN THE EIGHTEENTH AND
NINETEENTH CENTURIES
The basis for the relationships between the Iranian and Ottoman empires in
modern times was the Treaty of Qasr-i Shirin (17 May 1639). I*ended the war
which had gone on between the two for over a century and it established the
boundaries which were to survive with little change into modern times. The
salient division of the Middle East was preserved: the Tigris—Euphrates basin
and eastern Anatolia remained under the Ottoman Sultan while the Caucasus
remained in Iranian hands, later to fall to Russia. The Ottomans thus failed to
achieve their long-standing objectives in the Caucasus and Azarbaijan, but
Mesopotamia and the route to the Persian Gulf were definitely restored to them,
with the removal of the principal foreign stimulus to revolt in Anatolia, thus
greatly simplifying the efforts of subsequent Ottoman reformers to revive the
empire from within and so save it from foreign attack. During the next century
the treaty was observed by both sides, but less out of genuine friendship than as a
consequence of internal weakness, preoccupation with reform, and foreign
aggression.
The spark for renewal of the conflict came, strangely enough, from these
modern reforms introduced into the Ottoman Empire during the "Tulip
Period" (1718-30) under the leadership of Sultan Ahmad III (1703—30) and his
Grand Vizier, Damad Ibrahim Pasha. The financial burdens of modernization,
when combined with popular hostility towards the European modes and
frivolities then fashionable in the palaces of the Sultan and among members of
the ruling class, so threatened the Establishment that the Grand Vizier was
enticed into an attack on Iran, in the hope that advantage might be taken of the
internal disintegration during the reign of the last Safavid, Shah Sultan Husain
(1694-1722), to replenish the Ottoman treasury and lessen the burden of
taxation on the Sultan's subjects without diminishing the Sultan's pleasures.
When the Afghan invasion caused Iranian society to disintegrate, Shah Sultan
Husain's son, Tahmasp, fled to Tabriz, where he declared himself Shah and
appealed to the Ottomans for help. At the same time, the Georgian Vali of Tiflis,
Wakhtang VI, used the situation to declare his own independence, attacking the
297

IRAN AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
Sunni Muslim inhabitants of Shirvan who, in turn, also asked for Ottoman
assistance. When Peter the Great responded to Tahmasp's appeals to him also by
moving his army toAstrakhan during the summer of 1722 and then occupying
Darband in the autumn, the Ottomans were faced with asituation in which they
could not have moved towards the Caspian even had they been ready todo so.1
Soon afterwards, early in 1723, Tahmasp granted his Russian protectors control
of all his Caucasus provinces along the western shores of the Caspian, and Baku
was soon occupied. Thus Damad Ibrahim was confronted with a situation in
which major territories once possessed by the Ottomans seemed certain to fallto
Russia unless immediate Ottoman action were taken.
The Ottomans, of course, hadlong been disturbed by thepossibility of
Russian moves to the northern shores ofthe Black Sea and into the Caucasus.
The long struggle over the Sea of Azov was only one aspect ofthis. Now, in
response to the anarchy in Iran and the Russian threat to benefit by it, Damad
Ibrahim felt the time ripe to make major new conquests and secure large
additional revenues. As early as May 1722 orders were sent tothe governorsof
the eastern provinces of Anatolia to mass their forces and move into Iranian
territory without delay.2 These orders were repeated and reinforced as soon as
Isfahan fell tothe Afghans inOctober, Tahmasp's appeal for help was received,
and the Russians took Baku.3 Officially, however, the Iranian campaign was not
publicly proclaimed till April 1723.4 The purpose stated was the expulsion of the
Afghans and Russians from Iran, the regaining of territories once Ottoman, and
the replacing of Shicism by Sunnism throughout Iran.
The Ottoman army was organized into three divisions, each under its own
sardary for the purpose ofcampaigning inthe Caucasus, Azarbaljan, and Traq-i
Ajam,5 and each campaign was almost entirely successful between 1723 and
1725. In theCaucasus, forces from Kars and Diyarbakr took Tiflis and Gori
relatively easily.6 Once the Russians had occupied Baku, these Ottoman forces
hastened to take Erivan (September 1724), Nakhchivan, Lori (August 1725) and
Ganja (September 1725) from their Safavid garrisons before the Russians could
reach them. In western Iran (Traq-i Ajam), Ottoman forces from Baghdad, Van
and Shahrazur, including large Kurdish contingents, took Kirmanshah (12

October 1723) and Luristan with the help ofthe local Sunni inhabitants during
the summer and autumn of1723 .7 They then moved on against both Safavid and
Afghan garrisons tocapture Hamadan (31 August 1724), Ardalan and Maragha
the following summer.8 The Azarbaijan front was commanded by the Ottoman
governor of Van, Kopruluzadeh Abdallah Pasha, son of the famous Fazil
Mustafa, who occupied Khuy, Quschi, Tasuj and Marand during the summer of
1724, but was forced by bad weather to lift the siege of Tabriz, its conquest being
postponed until the following summer.9 However, astrenuous five-day popular
resistance against the Ottomans in the streets of this capital of Azarbaijan led the
Ottoman commanders toallow their troops toravage and pillage Tabriz for the
last time inthe long series ofOttoman conquests ofthat city.10 Urmiya and the
shrine city of Ardabil were taken late the same summer, thus completingthe
Ottoman reconquest of Azarbaijan.
For the moment Istanbul was inecstasy. All the major objectives had been
secured. The Russians had been forestalled, the Afghans and Safavids defeated,
and Da°ud Khan installed as Shirvanshah under Ottoman suzerainty and
protection. However, Russian moves past Baku into Georgia and efforts toraise
the Cossacks and Circassians north ofthe Black Sea threatened conflict, while
the Ottomans were also receiving appeals from various Muslim peoples in the
Caucasus asking for protection against then Russians. The British and Austrian
ambassadors inIstanbul were atthis point actually working to secure a resump
tion of the Ottoman—Russian war which had been ended atPassarowitz.11 They
had the strong support ofthe Crimean Khan aswell asthe old Istanbul "war
party", which still hoped to regain lost territories ifonly the war were resumed.
However, their intrigues were successfully countered by the efforts of the
Russian and French ambassadors, supported behind the scenes by the Sultan and
the queen mother, who were even more desirous for continuation of peace than
was the Grand Vizier.12 The result was a series of Ottoman—Russian negotia
tions in Istanbul, mediated bythe French ambassador.13 Atfirst, the Russians
demanded that the Ottomans evacuate all occupied Iranian territory, including
Georgia, Shlrvan, Daghistan andAzarbaijan, but the Ottoman negotiators
refused on thegrounds that these territories were being held in trust for the
Safavids (August 1723). While the Russian representative was onhis way back

IRAN AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
to Moscow for instructions, Peter the Great announced his recognition of
Tahmasp II as Shah of Iran and the restoration to him of all provinces taken,
except Gllan, Mazandaran and Astarabad, which it was intended to include in
the Russian Empire (September 1723). It was at this point that the Ottoman
advance into Iran ceased. Da°ud Khan was officially proclaimed an Ottoman
vassal and under Ottoman protection, with the river Kura the boundary
between his territory and that of the Tsar. TheOttomans were willing to accept
this much, but demanded that Darband and Baku be turned over to them,
because they were formerly under Ottoman rule. On this point the negotiations
foundered for a time (15 January 1724), but the French ambassador finally
persuaded the Sultan to accept Russian control of these twocities. The stalemate
was broken and an agreement reached on 24 June 1724.
By its terms, theRussians accepted Ottoman control of Georgia, Shirvan and
Azarbaijan, including the cities of Tabriz, Maragha, Urmiya, Nakhchivan,
Krivan, Hamadan, Kirmanshah and Ardalan, with Da°ud Khan as ShTrvanshah
under Ottoman protection. In return, theOttomans accepted Russian control of
the Caspian provinces of Gllan, Mazandaran and Astarabad. If Tahmasp II
accepted this agreement, both parties would recognize him as Shah of Iran, and
the Ottomans would stand aside and remain neutral if the Russians chose to
provide him with military assistance against the Afghans. However, if the
Afghans attacked Ottoman territory, then theOttomans would join in the move
to push them out of Iran altogether.14
For the moment at least, both Russia andthe Ottomans seemed satisfied with
an agreement which achieved their own objectives at Iranian expense. Damad
Ibrahim's prestige in Istanbul washigher than usual, both with the Sultan, who
had more money available than ever before, andwith thepopulace, which forgot
its troubles and complaints when besotted with thenews that the Sunni Muslims
of the Caucasus had been saved and that steps were being taken to regain the
remainder of Iran for Sunnism; but events in Iran soon upset the settlement and
led to the fall of both Sultan and Grand Vizier.
At first, Damad Ibrahim adhered strictly to his agreement with the Russians
by refusing to receive the ambassadors sent by the new Afghan ruler, Ashraf
(January 1726),15 who replied by attacking the Ottomans in the vicinity of
Hamadan, supported by border tribes. He achieved small success and,when he
offered to support Sunni Islam in Iran, a peace settlement was reached (4
October 1727)16 at Hamadan. The Afghans abandoned border areas which they

had taken and retired into the interior of Iran, where Tahmasp demanded their
attention. Inreturn the Ottomans recognized Ashraf as Iran's sovereign. This
was torecognize that Tahmasp IIhad apparently proved about as incapable of
resisting the Afghans ashad his father.
Finally, the fugitive Shah fled to Gurgan andthence to neighbouring
Khurasan. There he was joined by a number of Turkmen nomadic tribes,
including the Qajars, commanded by Fath All Khan, and the Afshars, whose
leader, Nadir Khan, was soon able todrive the Afghans out ofIran, forcing
them into the hills of Baluchistan. Ashraf himself was beheaded and his Ghilzai
followers scattered. Tahmasp II therefore was restored to Isfahan with a
powerful Turkmen army commanded by Nadir Khan, to whom thename
Tahmasp Qull Khan had been awarded to indicate his position as "slave" of the
Shah. Itwas accompanied by the title of Ttimad al-Daula. No longer a fugitive,
Tahmasp IIdeclared he could not recognize the Ottoman—Russian agreement.
He demanded that both parties should evacuate Iranian territory.17 Damad
Ibrahim attempted to solve the problem without war by agreeing to giveup
Kirmanshah, Tabriz, Hamadan, Ardalan, and all of Luristan in return for
Iranian recognition of Ottoman rule in Tiflis, Kartli, Kakheti, and Erivan, and
of Ottoman suzerainty over the Shlrvanshah. Indeed orders were at once
despatched for the evacuation tostart. It was explained that the Ottomans had
occupied these western Iranian cities only to save them from the Afghans.18
Tahmasp was glad to regain lost territories, but, as Damad Ibrahim had been
earlier, when Iran was disturbed, he was encouraged to obtain more by the news
of the Ottoman government's unpopularity in Istanbul and the provinces; news
evidently confirmed by the Grand Vizier's willingness to give up so much
territory. Tahmasp instructed Nadir Khan to use the implementation of the
peace agreement as a cover for a full-scale assault against the Ottoman positions.
Even as the Ottomans retired, therefore, Nadir Khan moved to the attack,
capturing Farahan and Yazdikhwast, smashing Kopruluzadeh Abdallah's army
before Tabriz, which he then occupied as well as Hamadan (July 1730).19 The
Sultan immediately ordered his garrisons in the Caucasus and at Kars and Van to
prepare foranenemy attack.20 The Iranian ambassador was imprisoned, and
preparations were made for a new campaign into western Iran, starting latein
July 1730. Atthis point, however, the news from the east finally ignited the
tinder of revolt in Istanbul which had been smouldering forsolong.

IRAN AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
Preparations for war were interrupted by themost bloody revolution in
Ottoman history, known from itsleader's name asthe Patrona Revolt. Sultan
Ahmad III and Damad Ibrahim were eliminated, and while thenew Sultan,
Mahmud I (1730—54), did not share the rebels' desire forreaction, it was some
time before he could establish sufficient authority over the state to resume either
the war against Iran orthe programme of reforms. Thus, while Nadir Khan's
campaign against the Ottomans on behalf of Shah Tahmasp IIwas not halted by
the revolution in Istanbul, the Ottoman response, in the form ofa retaliatory
expedition, had tobe postponed. It was not until the new Sultan had driven the
rebels outof Istanbul that Hakimoglu cAli Pasha, who hadbeen appointed
sardar of the eastern front, beat back anIranian effort to take Erivan (March
1731). He routed the enemy and captured all its artillery and supplies. He then
went on toretake Urmiya (15 November 1731) and Tabriz (4 December 1731),
thus winning for himself the title of gha^l (hero), awarded by a grateful Sultan.
At the same time, the governor ofBaghdad, Ahmad Pasha, retook Kirmanshah
(30 July 1731) andHamadan(i8 September 1731), the latter after routing alarge
Iranian force led by the Shah himself (15 September 1731). With authority
previously granted him bythe Sultan, Ahmad Pasha then entered into peace
negotiations with the Shah, resulting inan agreement by which Erivan, Ganja,
Tiflis, Nakhchivan, Kartli, Kakheti, Daghistan and Shlrvan would remain
under Ottoman control, while the areas of western Iran and AzarbaTjan,
including Hamadan, Tabriz, Kirmanshah, Luristan, Ardalan and those areas
inhabited by the Hawiza tribe would return to the Iranians. The River Aras now
became the boundary between the two states in the north, and the boundaries
established by thetreaty of Qasr-i Shirin remained unaltered in the south.21
For the moment peace reigned, yet neither side was satisfied. The Sultan had
not expected his plenipotentiary togive away so many territories conquered by
his army, and he had particularly wanted to retain control of Tabriz. Apparently,
Ahmad Pasha had agreed to give up the latter either because he had not received
information that it had been reconquered byHakimoglu cAli, or because that
information reached him too late tochange the course of the negotiations. This
was oflittle solace to the Sultan, particularly since the old rumours of bribery
and corruption once again were spreading among thepopulace. The Grand
Vizier, Topal Osman Pasha, was sacrificed tothe clamour. He was replacedby
the conqueror of Tabriz, Hakimoglu cAli Pasha (12 March 1732).
Iran meanwhile was equally unhappy with theagreement: large areas of

IRAN AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
Iranian territory had been left in Ottoman hands. Although Tahmasp soon
afterwards succeeded in urging the Russian evacuation of the districts south of
the Saliyan river by the Treaty of Rasht (February 1732), he remained strongly
criticized throughout his realm because of his military failure before the Otto
mans (see p. 30), and subsequent acquiescence intheir continued presence in
Iran. Nadir Khan in the meantime was in Herat, righting the Afghans. When he
heard of the Shah's surrender, he marched back to Isfahan and exploited
personal prestige and popularity among the people, as well as his military might,
to dethrone Tahmasp infavour of his infant son, Abbas, Nadir retaining real
power as chief minister (Vakil al-Daula) and regent (Na°ib). The deposed Shah
was sent off to imprisonment in Khurasan (7July 1732).22 Nadir Khan very
quickly gathered power into his own hands, appointing his own men to all the
key positions inthe government. He then declared his primary aim tobe the
recovery of all those territories ceded to the Ottomans by an agreement extorted
from the former Shah after hehad found himself in a position of military
disadvantage.23
In fact, Nadir Khan's ambitions went farbeyond the mere reconquest of
Iranian territory, as victory after victory led him deep into territory previously
held by the Ottomans. His first aim was western Iran and Iraq, both north and
south. When the Ottomans attacked through the areas of Shahrazur and Derne,
he replied by pushing them back and then going on totake Kirkuk and Irbil
before laying Baghdad under siege on 12 January 1733. For the moment he was
frustrated in his goals when Ottoman troops from Van, Erivan, and Tiflis,
commanded bythe governor of Erzerum, the former Grand Vizier, Topal
Osman Pasha, passed by Kirkuk to surprise and rout Nadir's besieging force (20
July 1733). Nadir Khan himself escaped only with difficulty. All his supplies and
ammunition fell into Ottoman hands. Kirkuk and Derne were retaken. Anatolia
was saved from what in Istanbul had appeared to be the certain threat of
invasion. Topal Osman Pasha was now the man ofthe hour.
Nadir Khan, however, was no ordinary man. Demonstrating the tremendous
vitality and energy which were to characterize his entire career, he reformed his
army in a far shorter time than anyone could expect. Simultaneously, the
Ottoman troops which had triumphed at Baghdad returned home for the winter
and Topal Osman Pasha was stricken with an illness which prevented him from
taking the measures necessary toreform his forces for the spring.24 Neverthe
less, Nadir Khan's effort to regain Mosul was beaten off by its garrison (October

1733); but, with the Ottoman provincial forces still largely demobilized, he
moved towards Kirkuk. Here he met and routed Topal Osman Pasha's armyat
Lailan, five hours distant, killing the Ottoman commander and capturing his
entire camp (30 November 1733)before going on to reoccupy Kirkuk, Derne,
and Shahrazur. Now Nadir Khan hoped fora new peace treaty restoringall
Iranian territories without further struggle, but this time itwas Sultan Mahmud
who resolved tofight on, sending the Grand Vizier, Hakimoglu cAli Pashaas
supreme commander, while Kopruluzadeh Abdallah Pasha was appointed
commander on the Iranian front (12 March 1734).25 The Crimean Khan, Qaplan
Giray I,was sent to the Caucasus to maintain Ottoman power there despite the
defeats tothe south. In January 1734, Nadir Khan again laid Baghdad under
siege, threatening to continue the attack until Tiflis, Shirvan, Kartli, Ganja and
Rrivan were turned over tohim. Baghdad had still not replenished itsstores
following the last long siege: it seemed unlikely it could withstand a second
investment of equal length. The governor, Ahmad Pasha, consequently in
formed Nadir that he would consider his terms, but would have to ask Istanbul
for instructions. Nadir, hoping very much for a peaceful outcome, withdrew his
forces and returned to Iran, thus foregoing what might easily have been a major
victory. Baghdad was immediately resupplied and fortified.26 Nadir Khan's
demands were rejected in spite of the entreaties of the Grand Vizier. Because the
latter advocated peace he was recalled to Istanbul, with Kopruluzadeh Abdallah
Pasha left in sole command of the eastern front.
His second peace proposal rejected, Nadir Khan again moved to the attack,
this time in the Caucasus. While the Shlrvanshah was busy suppressing revolts
along the Caspian inDaghistan, Nadir seized his capital ofShamakhi (August
1734), with the help of a large number ofShici Qizilbash living in and near the
city. The Shlrvanshah hesitated to return and take up the challenge, fearing the
loyalty ofmany ofthe Qizilbash tribesmen who formed the bulk ofhis own
army. He waited for help from the Crimean Tatars and the governor of Tiflis
before attacking Nadir Khan, but even so was routed twice and finally forced to
flee the scene, leaving Shirvan and Daghistan open to complete Iranian occupa
tion. With help from the Russian garrison in the north Caucasus, Nadir Khan's
next aim wasGanja, which he laid under siege in November 1734, while sending
another force to incite aGeorgian revolt against the Sultan and,with the help of
these new allies, he captured the town ofOrdubad and the fort of Gori, while

IRAN AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
Nadir again proposed peace on thebasis of the Ottoman surrender of all
towns on the right bank of the Aras. Inresponse to the Ottoman defeats, as well
as to the intrigues of the Chief Eunuch of the Palace, Hakimoglu cAli Pasha was
dismissed. He was banished toMetylene (12 July 1735) and replaced by Gurcu
Ismail Pasha, a Georgian convert whohad been one of Abdallah Pasha's
lieutenants and was aprotege ofthe Chief Eunuch (29 September—2 5 th Decem
ber 1755). Gurcu Ismail Pasha now put his own men, representing theChief
Eunuch's party, into the chief positions ofthe central government as well as of
the provinces, but he himself soon fell to intrigues and was replaced by Silahdar
Muhammad Pasha (9 January 1736—6 August 1737), whom the difficult taskof
arranging peace awaited.
Having now gained everything he had wanted in Azarbaljan and the
Caucasus, Nadir once again proposed peace. This time the Ottomans were much
more receptive, due not only tothe apparent hopelessness of the situation inthe
east, but because troubles with Russia seemed to presage afresh major outbreak
in the west. Inthe meantime, Nadir Khan summoned the tribal leaders and the
representatives of the major elements and classes of the Iranian population to
orchestrate a request that he become Shah. Threatening to retire unless they
agreed, he mounted the throne only on the conditions mentioned elsewhere (see
p. 3 6): the assembly had to promise never to support or assist any members of the
Safavid family and to accept Nadir's sonas hisheir, thus to establish a new
Afsharid dynasty inplace of the Safavids. Also the Shfi practices ofcursing the
first three Caliphs and persecuting Sunnis were to beabolished. These condi
tions accepted, Nadir was proclaimed and crowned Shah in March 1736. His
novel religious policy was intended notso much to establish Sunnism as the
official religion of state asto counteract and undermine the power ofthe Shlci
zulama(see p. 707 for further discussion); but, as suggested above inthe chapter
devoted to Nadir Shah, this policy had what might be termed an Ottoman side to
it. For this innovation meant that orthodox Islam had returned to Iran, which
made it easier for theSultan and Grand Vizier to sign a peace agreement by

anxious for peace because already planning toinvade India, where he could and
subsequently did gather wealth far beyond anything he could gain out of
Ottoman provinces, unless he succeeded in marching all the way to Istanbul and
taking thewhole Empire.
With both sides, therefore, eager for peace, negotiations opened atTiflis and
were then moved to Nadir Shah's camp at Mughan, in Azarbaljan. The initial
Ottoman request wasfor Iranian agreement to re-establish the boundaries

delineated in theTreaty of Qasr-i Shirin, for ending the alliance with Russia and
for forcing the latter to abandon Daghistan, which was inhabited largely by
Sunni Muslims. Nadir Shah replied that the Russians had, in fact, already
abandoned that region, therefore the matter need not bediscussed.29 Hewent on
to declare that all Shicis were infact adherents ofa fifth orthodox school (maf^hab)
of Islam, theJacfari (sonamed after theImam Jacfar al-Sadiq thesixth Imam of
the descendents ofthe Prophet Muhammad through CA1T, his son-in-law). In this
way Nadir hoped to facilitate peace negotiations with the Ottomans, and gain
the support of the Sunni Turkmen, Kurdish andAfghan tribesmen in his own
army while at the same time something of Iranian pride might be salvaged by
this Jacfarl sect being fully accepted as the fifth orthodox school, with special pro
visions accordingly being made for its Iranian adherents on pilgrimage tothe
Holy Cities. Such provisions would include their own Amir al-Hajj tolead them.
It was also required that ambassadors and prisoners should beexchanged
between thetwo empires, between which Nadir seems above allto have sought
parity and to suppress sectarian animosity. His ideas shocked theIranian culama
as much astheOttoman, butthey provided thefoundation for anarmistice.As,
however, the Ottoman representatives lacked authority to modify any ofthe
Sultan's demands ortotreat onthe religious questions, negotiations were finally
transferred to Istanbul.30 There they continued through the summer months,
July—September 1736, interminable religious disputes occupying much of the
time. In the end, aformula was developed inanattempt to satisfy allparties. The
Iranian Shicis would indeed have their own Amir al-Hajj, but he wouldbe
allowed tolead them only as faras theShicT holy places at Najaf in Iraq and Lahsa.
Those wishing to goviaSyria to the Holy Places ofMecca and Medina could do
so under this Amir al-Hajj leadership, but, tosatisfy Sunni sensibilities,he
would notbe allowed to usethetitle of Amir al-Hajj. Thequestion of whether
the Jacfari Shici beliefs of the Iranians should be accepted as a fifth school of
Islam was left unacknowledged onthegrounds that the adherence ofIranians to
that sect hadnothing to do with the Ottomans andin no waydamaged them;
however, the question ofwhether this sect would beallowed toestablish its own
relics in theKacba was relegated to further discussion between theculama of the
two empires. Each government was to have an ambassador in thecapital of the
other, with changes to be made once every three years, and both sides were to
release the prisoners ofthe other, with the prisoners deciding where they should
go; the Ottomans were thus not forcibly compelling Sunni Muslims to go to

IRAN AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
Iran. By now war between the Ottoman Empire and Russia was imminent.
Nadir Shah was beginning preparations to march into India. Neither side
wanted to haggle over religious points, so an agreement was signed, with
Mahmud I recognizing the Iranian occupation ofthe disputed areas and also
accepting Nadir as Shah, while the religious question was left unsettled.31
Mahmud was willing to make peace with Iran at this time because of the
urgent need to deal with anew war which now broke out with both Austria and
Russia (1736-9). It has been claimed that the treaties of Belgrade and Nissa,
which ended that war, gave die Ottomans three decades of peace. Peace did not,
indeed, come in Europe, with Russia and Austria diverted first by the War of the
Austrian Succession (1740—8), and then by the Seven Years' War (1756—63). But
before the Ottomans could benefit from the new situation in the west, they still
had to engage in another five years of warfare with Nadir Shah in the third and
final phase of clashes between the Ottoman Empire and Iran which had already
dissipated somuch manpower and energy earlier in the century.
For a time, Nadir Shah had been occupied conquering Afghanistan and
pushing conquest into India asfar as Delhi (1737—40). But not long after his
return from these areas he began to move once more against the Ottomans. At
first he made an unsuccessful effort toget the SunnI Muslims ofDaghistan to
transfer their loyalties from the Sultan to him (April—May 1741), an attempt
which may throw further light on his religious policy as awhole; then again he
attempted to get the Ottomans to recognize the Jacfari sect, to allow the Jafaris
to have arecognized place in the Kacba, and to let him provide its mantle {kiswd)
every other year, thus giving him a share inthe religious prestige previously
enjoyed by the Ottoman Sultans from their monopoly ofthe right torule and
maintain the Holy Cities (April 1742), but once again nothing definitive was
agreed to. While Mahmud would have liked to give in to at least some of Nadir
Shah's demands in order to avoid further conflict, he feared that any gestures of
concession would expose him to the wrath of the SunnI culama, placing his own
throne in danger. In the end his answer was to declare war, on 30 April 1742.32
Preparations were made for expeditions into the Caucasus and western Iran, and
as aprecaution forces were sent to Hotin to guard against any possible Russian
intrusion in support of its ally. A Safavid pretender, Safi MIrza, was also
officially proclaimed Shah of Iran and sent first to Izmit and then to Erzerum,to
be used asa rival to the authority of Nadir Shah.
The war which followed was fitful and once again bloody. Nadir Shah first

raided the environs of Baghdad tokeep its garrison hemmed in, after whichhe
rapidly moved north, to take Kirkuk in August 1743. In response to these
challenges, the declaration ofwar inIstanbul was renewed, and Safi Mirza sent
to Erzerum (23 September) as thefirst step towards ostensibly reinstating him in
Iran. Nadir Shah had meanwhile begun the siege ofMosul (14—22 September
1743), subjecting it toa heavy bombardment,33 but hewas finally beaten back
with heavy losses. The next summer, while the main Ottoman defence was
concentrated foranexpected attack in the Caucasus, Nadir first attempted to
take Kars (July 1744), but again wasbeaten off, after which he advanced toward
Erivan, but wasalmost routed by Yegen Muhammad Pasha, now sardar onthe
eastern front, at the nearby strong point of Baghavard.34 However, when Yegen
Muhammad Pasha died in battle and thelevends (irregulars) and other volunteers
in his army scattered, an Iranian victory wras assured, and the Ottoman army
withdrew toKars. Following the battle, Mahmud I issued new orders, forbid
ding hisprovincial governors from employing levends in their armiesand
inviting the mass of the people to join the struggle to eliminate the levends once
and forall.35 Hakimoglu Ali Pasha was ordered to lead a campaign against
them, and by November 1745, most ofAnatolia was almost completely cleared
of them, a notable accomplishment.36
Both sides now saw that neither could win a decisive victory, andthat
continuation ofthe war would only drain their strength. Nadir Shah hoped to
use his victory atBaghavard to secure afavourable settlement, finally abandon
ing his claims on behalf of the Ja'fari sect, and instead concentrating on the
demand that all of Iraq, including Baghdad, Basra and the Shici holy placesof
Najaf and Karbala, be turned over to himalong with the Kurdish area of Van.37
A series of letters and exchanges ofambassadors followed, and eventually an
agreement washammered out on 4 September 1746, by which the Qasr-i Shlrin
treaty boundaries were restored without change, with provisions made for the
exchange ofprisoners, aswell asfor the exchange ofambassadors once every
three years. Nadir Shah thereby abandoned all hisformer demands and the
Ottomans accepted peace in accordance with the earlier agreements.

inconsequential reign ofcUthman III (1754—7) and much of that ofAhmad Ill's

IRAN AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
longest continuous period of peace in its history. This was not because opportu
nities for war were lacking, but because of a conscious policy pursued by Sultans
and Grand Viziers alike, to safeguard the empire from the kind of conflicts
which had for so long drained its resources and threatened its very existence. As
for Iran, there were numerous opportunities for renewed Ottoman adventures
there following Nadir Shah's assassination in 1747, with anarchy preceding and
following the rule of Karim Khan Zand (1750—79), and with Afsharid, Zand and
Qajar chieftains struggling for mastery. Yet the Ottomans resisted the entreaties
of their frontier governors that the situation should be exploited to regain lost
territories. They remained faithful to the agreement signed with Nadir Shah.38
When the putative Safavid prince, Safi Mirza, attempted to upset the peace
agreement and secure further Ottoman aid in support of his own claims, he was
imprisoned, first in Samsun and then at Rhodes, to stop him undertaking
intrigues in Istanbul.39 Other Iranian princes and politicians in exile who might
have endangered the statusquo were treated in a similar manner. Karim Khan, on
the other hand, pursued an actively aggressive policy against the Ottomans. He
used local dynastic struggles in the Kurdish areas round Shahrazur as pretexts
for unsuccessful intervention, followed by large-scale raids into eastern Anato
lia, inFebruary-March 1774 and inMarch 1775. Next, using as his excuse this
time the alleged mistreatment ofShici pilgrims toKarbala in Mesopotomia, he
intervened in the mamluk political struggles then going on in Baghdad and tried
to install his own candidate, while he took advantage of the situation to besiege
and capture Basra.40 Abd al-Hamid I (1774—89) responded with a declaration of
war on Iran in June 1776. He renewed ties with the local princes of Azarbaijan
and Georgia to prevent them from joining Karim Khan, and he tried to use the
situation toreplace the mamluk governors of Baghdad with regular Ottoman
governors. The latter subsequently made attacks on Iranian territory from
Mosul and Baghdad, but disputes among the mamluks, and between them and
these regular Ottoman governors, prevented effective action against Karim
Khan; Basra remained in Iranian hands.
Karim Khan also made an agreement with the Russians for a joint invasion of
eastern Anatolia (1778), but his own death on 1 March 1779 and the quarrels
which followed among hisheirs putan end to this expedition. Ottoman
acquiescence in the restoration of mamluk power in Baghdad under the leader
ship of Buyuk Sulaiman Pasha in 1780, enabled him to eliminate rivals and

IRAN AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
establish a rule which lasted until his death in 1802. The danger from Iran now
receded, leaving Sulaiman and his successors in Baghdad better able at least to
attempt to control thetribes of the mountains and deserts. Though frequent,
these attempts could not be said ever to have been highly successful; the Bedouin
were in a good position to flee into theexpansive deserts, andincursions of
the Wahhabis and their Bedouin allies from Central Arabia made matters worse.
In the end, it was the desert Bedouin, rather than the Iranians, who posed the
main menace to Ottoman rule in Mesopotamia.41
Hence relations between the two regimes remained relatively quiet forhalf a
century. Hostile engagements began again early in the 19th century, due not so
much to Iranian strength, as had been the case in thetime of Nadir Shah,but
rather toIranian weakness inthe face ofRussian attacks and a resulting desire to
compensate losses to Russia with gains at the expense of the now weaker
neighbour inthe west. By this time Iran was under the rule ofthe Qajar dynasty
(1794-1925), and during the reign of Fath CA1T Shah (1797-1834), Iranian
intervention across the Ottoman frontier, while sporadic, was quite persistent.
After 1813, while the British worked to rebuild theShah's army, the Russians
tried tocurry favour by encouraging Fath CA1I tocompensate forlosses to them
by seizing coveted territory elsewhere. Taking advantage of Mahmud II's
diversions in Europe and at home, aswell asofthe resistance ofchieftains near
the Ottoman—Iranian borders to the Sultan's efforts to endtheir autonomy,
Iranian raids into the areas ofBaghdad and Shahrazur began as early as 1812 and
continued relentlessly, despite Ottoman missions of protest and demands for
compensation. At times, Fath CA1I Shah's begkrbegis openly supported the border
chieftains against the Ottomans, and even helped the Baghdad mamluks and the
Muntafiq Bedouin against the Sultan. In 1817—18 Iranian troops ravaged the
area of Van with the help of some local Kurdish tribes. Mahmud II (1808-39)
was not at all anxious for warwith Iran. He wasfaced with long-standing
difficulties inthe Balkans as well as the beginnings ofthe Greek Revolution. But
the progression of border incidents finally ledhim to declare war in October
1820. He assigned tothe governor ofP>zerum, his old favorite Khusrau Pasha,
command of the campaign inthe north, while the mamluks ofBaghdad took the
lead in the south. With the main Ottoman army away in Europe, however, the
Iranians could be quite successful in twobrief encounters. Fath cAli Shah's
eldest son, Muhammad CA1I Mirza, beglerbegi of Kirmanshah, advanced in the
direction of Baghdad, as he haddone previously in 1804 and 1812, but was
forced to retreat asa result ofa cholera epidemic which depleted his forces and

resulted in his owndeath in November 1821 before he could return to his base at
Kirmanshah. Abbas Mirza, the Crown Prince, captured Bayazid and Toprak
Qalca in September 1821and advanced on Erzerum, while a second force took
Bitlis and advanced towards Diyarbakr, assisted by several refugee Anatolian
notables, who had been dispossessed by Mahmud and who hoped to use the
Iranian presence to regain their former positions. Butafter taking Ercis (Arjish),
the main Iranian army retired to Tabriz for thewinter, allowing theOttomans to
regroup their forces, this time under the leadership of the former Grand Vizier,
Muhammad Amin Rauf Pasha. When cAbbas Mirza advanced again from
Tabriz, he routed the Ottoman army at Khuy (May 1822), but cholera then
devastated his own troops, forcing himto seek peace from the pliant Sultan. By
an agreement signed at Erzerum (28 July 1823), the peace treaty of 1746 was
restored without change, the Ottomans again allowing Iranian merchants and
pilgrims to enter the Sultan's territory, and even accepting Iranian claims to
sovereignty over several border tribes in order to secure the peace which the
Porte so urgently needed before turning to fight the Greek rebels. Thesub
sequent Russian invasion of the Caucasus and their capture of Erivan and
Nakhchivan ended Ottoman ambitions in that region and left Iran too weak to
attempt new adventures in the south for some time to come.
During the remaining century of the Ottoman Empire's existence, military
relations with Iran were limited to border conflicts and raids, stimulated largely
by the movement of tribal groups across the frontiers. The major task of the
Ottoman governors of Iraq and the provinces of eastern Anatolia was to erect
strong defences against such incursions, but their efforts were largely unsuccess
ful, and local tensions remained throughout the 19th century. However, com
mon economic interests made actual conflict disadvantageous for both sides.
Quantities of silk and other exports from Iran passed through Ottoman terri
tory, via Trebizond to the west, and while this gave the Sultan's government a
certain leverage with its eastern neighbour, the considerable income and other
advantages derived from keeping the route open also provided an incentive to
maintain the peace, especially in view of the increasing competition from the
Persian Gulf-Suez Canal andthe Russian Caucasus routes, which developed late
in the 19th century.42 Both Iran andthe Ottoman Empire were seriously affected
by 19th-century European economic imperialism, thus boosting their common
concerns, which included the manifestation on both sides, of somewhat similar
reform movements, particularly after the Iranian Revolution of 1905 and the
Young Turk Revolution, which occurred only three years later.

CHAPTER 9
IRANIAN RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND
THE SOVIET UNION, TO 1921
Before the 18th century relations between Iran and Russia were sporadic.
Though some Persian goods found their waytoMuscovy while the duchy was
still under theTatar yoke, travel andcommerce remained insignificant until the
mid 16th century, when theRussian conquest of the khanates of Kazanand
Astrakhan opened theVolga route totheCaspian Sea.Soon Moscow became a
minor entrepot forEurope's Persian trade. From the north and the west there
flowed into Iran a small stream of furs, cloth, metals, leather, amber, crystal.
From Iran came silk, pearls, rugs, embroidered cloth, velvet, rice, fruit, and
spices.1
Political anddiplomatic relations between thetwo states were less important.
After a brief clash of interests in Daghistan early in the 17th century, the
Russians withdrew from the northern Caucasus. The raids onIran's shoresby
Sten'ka Razin's cossacks were a large-scale bandit enterprise conducted against
the wishes of Russian authorities. Razin's mobs pillaged coastal towns, indis
criminately massacred their inhabitants, raped and abducted women, then
disappeared without trace. Occasionally Muscovite envoys would appear in
Isfahan orPersian envoys inMoscow, but thecontacts they established wereof
short duration. It was Peter theGreat who broke through thebarrier ofthe
Caucasus andfor thefirst time confronted Iran with theRussian threat.
Though Peter I was primarily concerned with Europe, "hehadfrom his
earliest years taken alively interest inAsia". Inhim, B. H.Sumner has written,
"The enthusiasm of the explorer was allied with the gold-dazzled phantasy of
the prospector and themerchant."2 Persia, Central Asia anddistant India excited
his imagination. When Peter wasdefeated by the Turks inthe Pruth campaign
(1711), he turned hisattention further East, to theCaucasus andIran.
As early as 1701 the Tsar had been approached byone Israel Ori,who had
arrived inSmolensk from Lithuania, claimed tobe an Armenian nobleman and
had a plan for theliberation of his people from Persian rule.

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE SOVIET UNION
There exists aprophecy [Ori wrote to the Tsar] that at the time of the end the infidel will be infuriated and will begin to force Christians to accept their obscene law; then will appear from themost august House of Moscow a great sovereign, who will exceed Alexander ofMacedon incourage. He will take the Armenian kingdom and deliver the Christians. We believe that the fulfilment of this prophecy is approaching.3
Later other Armenians as well as Georgians pledged Russia their support should
she undertake thetask of liberating them from Muslim rule.
To explore the possibilities of both commerce and conquest Peter dispatched
to Iran a young, bright official, Artemii Volynskii, who wasgiven written
instructions tonote, when passing through the possessions ofthe Shah, every
thing about harbours, towns and settlements, and especially about rivers that
flow into the Caspian; then inPeter's own hand was added, "and how faralong
such rivers can one sail from the sea, and whether there isa river that flows into
that seafrom India". Volynskii was to gather and record in a secret journal
intelligence on Persian fortresses andtroops. He wasto impress upon the
Persians that theTurks were their worst enemies whereas theRussians were
their friends. Finally, he was to propose a commercial agreement that would
give Russia a monopoly of Persia's silk trade.4
It took Volynskii more than a year to reach Isfahan, where hewas initially
well received. The attitude ofthe Persians changed abruptly a few days after his
arrival, when they began tosuspect the nature of his mission. Itturned hostileas
they learned ofa Russian expedition under Prince Bekovich-Cherkasskii land
ing on theeastern shore of the Caspian. Three audiences with Shah Sultan
Husain and long negotiations with various officials, including the Ttimad al
Daula, ledto theconclusion of a commercial treaty that permitted Russian
merchants to trade freely in Iran.
More important was the knowledge ofIranian affairs gathered by Volynskii
and transmitted by him to the Tsar. Volynskii reported that the Persian state was
on the verge ofcollapse. The Shah did not rule and was soincapable "that one
could seldom find such a fool even among the common people". Officials were
lazy and conducted affairs irrationally and fitfully.
I think this Crown [Volynskii wrote] isnearing its ruin. . . . My weak reason cannot but conclude that God is leading this Crown to its fall, to which they themselves are enticing us through their folly. Seeing their stupidity I do not wonder, but think that this is God's will forthe fortune ofyour Tsarian Majesty. . . . As I see the weakness here, we could begin without any apprehension since not only with an army but even with a small corps a great part [ofIran] could beannexed without difficulty to Russia . ..5

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE SOVIET UNION
For the next several years Russia was too deeply absorbed in the Northern
War to conduct an active policy toward Iran. InAugust 1721 the war came to an
end with the treaty of Nystad and the victorious Tsar made ready for acampaign
that would, if successful, turn theCaspian into a Russian lake.
Events inIran provided the pretext for the Russian invasion. Da°ud Khan of
the Lezghians, a rebel mountaineer chieftain long held captive inthe citadelof
Darband by the central authorities, was released after the Afghan attack on Iran.
The government hoped that he and his Daghistani allies would come to the help
of the Shah. Instead, Da°ud, amilitant SunnI, eager to overthrow the oppressive
Shicl regime of the Safavids, puthimself at the head of a tribal coalition and
launched acampaign against the Shfl population and Persian forces.6 Together
with Surkha°i Khan of the Ghazlghumuq, on 18 August 1721 he took by storm
the commercial city of Shamakhl, massacring thousands of Shfls.7 In the sack of
Shamakhl several resident Russian merchants were killed. Others, among them
Matvei Evreinov, reputedly the wealthiest merchant in Russia, suffered heavy
losses.8
As soon as the news reached Artemii Volynskii, now governor of Astrakhan,
he informed the Tsar that Da°ud Khan and Surkha°i Khan had conquered
Shamakhl and asked the Sunn! Ottoman Turkish Sultan to accept them as his
subjects andsend troops to protect theareas they hadoccupied.9 Volynskii
urged the Tsar to intervene. Conditions would never be more favourable.
Persian territory could beoccupied while the claim was made of fighting the
common enemies of Russia and Iran. If the Persians protested, a promise to
withdraw could be made, conditional on the payment of an indemnity. In
December Peter replied that heagreed with Volynskii: orders had been issued
for troops to gather at Astrakhan.10
The Iranian government could nothave been aware of Peter's intentions.
Shah Sultan Husain and his ministers were ill-informed, ineffective men caught
in a raging storm that they could neither understand nor control. The Afghan
rebellion wasthe climax of a long series of disturbances which had been
plaguing Iran for decades. InDaghistan, Azarbaijan, Khurasan, Kurdistan, and
elsewhere, central authority had gradually atrophied and theShah's will had
ceased to be enforced. TheEmpire was breaking up,each constituent part

seeking to protect its own immediate interest or atleast to ensure itself against
disaster.
Husain Quli Khan, the Vail (governor) of Georgia, better known as
Wakhtang VI, who had been earlier mistreated by the Shah and had sworn never
to fight for the Safavid dynasty, sent emissaries to Saint Petersburg with
proposals for joint Georgian—Russian action against the Persians.11 There is no
evidence that the Shah knew of this move or would have done anything aboutit
if he had known. The passivity of the government, itsinability to organize
resistance toinvaders, its disorganization were such that ineffect the country
was left without anactive foreign policy.
The Russian decision toinvade Iran's Caspian provinces was greatly rein
forced by the news that Mahmud, son ofMir Vais, had reached Isfahan at the
head of his Afghan tribesmen. Less than a month later Russian troops began the
march to Astrakhan, the Tsar himself arriving there on 29 June 1722. Simulta
neously, instructions were sent to Semyon Avramov, Russian consul in Iran,to
tell Shah Sultan Husain, orhis successor, that the Russians were marching to
Shamakhl not to make war on Persia but to eradicate the rebels. Avramov was to
offer Iran help in expelling and subduing all her enemies, provided she cededto
Russia certain provinces along the Caspian Sea. Russia knew that a weak Iran
would fall victim to Turkish occupation but had no wish to see the Caspian
shores inOttoman hands. Without an agreement with Iran, Russia wouldbe
unable to help her but would still take the Caspian provinces "because we cannot
admit the Turks there".12
Avramov transmitted the Tsar's message toShah Sultan Husain's son and
heir, Tahmasp, who had found refuge from theAfghans in the northern
provinces. However, the consul said nothing about the cession of Caspian
provinces ascompensation for Russian aid toPersia. The topic could notbe
broached because of "the frozen haughtiness andpride" of the Persians.
Avramov reported that Tahmasp was being betrayed by the khans who should
have been his henchmen. He could not raise more than four hundred men for his
army. Ismacil Beg, whom Tahmasp had appointed ambassador to Russia, with
tears in hiseyes told Avramov: "Our faith and ourlaw arebeing utterly
destroyed, yet the mendacity and pride ofour lords donot diminish".13
While Avramov conducted negotiations with the fugitive claimant to the
Safavid throne, Russian troops were attacking Persian fortresses on the western

coast of the Caspian. The original plan of the campaign called for landings on the
shore tobe followed by an expedition inland, where Russians, Georgians, and
Armenians would jointly attack Da°ud Khan in Shamakhi, Wakhtang VI of
Georgia had gathered 30,000 men, the Armenians provided 10,000 more.
However, the Russians, whometwith serious difficulties soon after they
occupied the fortress of Darband, did notappear.
In early September they lost a large number of boats in a storm at sea.
Without naval support it was impossible to supply land forces. Anepidemic
killed off the horses, virtually destroying the Russian cavalry. Disease and death
spread among the troops who were not used tothe hot and humid climate and
did not know how to protect themselves. The Russians were therefore com
pelled towithdraw the bulk oftheir forces toAstrakhan, leaving behind a few
garrisons near Tarqu, Darband, and Baku, atfortresses such as that of the Holy
Cross. Plans foranexpedition inland were abandoned, leaving the Georgians
and the Armenians toface Da3ud Khan ontheir own.14 Wakhtang's participa
tion inthis abortive campaign was ultimately tocost him his throne, doom him
to exile and putanend to his dynasty.
The abandonment ofplans toconquer Shamakhi did not indicate that Peter
had lost interest in Persia. In late autumn, 1722, taking further advantage of
Tahmasp's desperate situation, Russian forces entered Rasht ostensibly to help
defend the city. InFebruary 1723 the governor assured the Russians that their
help was not needed, the Persians being able to protect themselves, and that
Russian troops should leave. The Russian commander, Colonel Shipov, prom
ised to send away his artillery andequipment first andthen to withdraw.
However, hefailed to keep his promise and found himself under siege in the
barracks. Late at night on 28 March 1723, adetachment of Russian troops crept
through the Persian lines. The Russians attacked from two directions, taking the
Persians by surprise. As the Persians fled, the Russians pursued, killing over one
thousand men.15
Under the circumstances Shah Tahmasp had no choice but tonegotiate. On
23 September 1723, his ambassador in Saint Petersburg, Ismacll Beg, signed a
humiliating treaty which stipulated that the Tsar would accord the Shah
friendship and help against rebels, and would maintain the Shah "intranquil
possession" ofhis throne. Inreturn the Shah promised permanently tocedeto
Russia:

.. .the towns of Darband [Derbend], Baku, with all the territories belonging to them, as well as the provinces: Gilan, Mazandaran, and Astarabad, so that they might support the forces which His Imperial Majesty will send to help His Shahian Majesty againsthis
rebels, without demanding money forit.16
The text ofthe treaty was brought toIran byPrince Boris Meshcherskii, a
sub-lieutenant of the Preobrazhenskii guard regiment. When heand his suite
entered Persia inApril 1724 the population was fully aware ofRussia's actions.
Unruly mobs met Meshcherskii and his fellow-diplomat Avramov with violent
threats. Shots were fired. The Shah received the Tsar's envoys with customary
ceremoniousness but refused to ratify the treaty of Saint Petersburg. He knew
by then that Russian forces on the Caspian were small and incapable ofhelping
him expel the Afghans. He may also have known that Russia had entered
negotiations with Iran's oldenemy — the Porte.
Meshcherskii's return to Russia without a treaty precipitated a review of
Russian policy toward Iran. The ministers suggested to the Tsar that Iran be
informed of a proposed Russo-Turkish treaty. If Iran refused to ratify the
agreement signed by Ismacil Beg in Saint Petersburg, shewould pit herself
against two great powers and would surely perish. However, the Tsar decided
against such a course ofaction, fearing that Iran might ratify the treaty and ask
for military aid against the Turks, whose armies had moved into Transcaucasia
and western Iran. It would bebetter to destroy the last vestiges of Tahmasp's
authority, either by persuading the Georgians inhis entourage to abandon him,
or byinducing them to kidnap him.17
The appearance ofthe Turks had greatly complicated analready confusing
situation. The Ottoman Empire could illafford the establishment of Russian
power in Transcaucasia on both the Caspian and the Black Seas. After three wars
with Peter, the Porte had emerged victorious. Russia had lost Azov at the mouth
of the Don, the Crimea was secure, the Balkan Christians were quiet. A Russian
conquest of Iran's Caspian provinces would drastically affect thebalance of
power and provide Russia with abase of operations from which tothreaten the
Armenian provinces of Anatolia.
To forestall such adevelopment, the Porte informed Russia that DaDud Khan
the Lezghian and Mahmud, son of Mir Vais the Afghan, had acknowledged the
suzerainty of the Porte.

. . . itfollows that the kingdom of Persia having fallen into the hands of Muslims, and the troubles and confusion having subsided, the provinces - those which are in the possession of Davud Khan as well as those in the possession of the above-mentioned Mir Mahmud, have entered under the shadow of the protection of our most august and most puissant monarch . . .18
Moreover, the Russian Ambassador in Constantinople, I.I. Nepliuev,
learned that the British were telling the Turks to beware ofthe Tsar who was
collecting a large army in Daghistan. The French Ambassador, the marquis de
Bonnac, advised Nepliuev to report to hiscourt that further intervention in
Persian affairs would lead to war with Turkey; but Peter was not easily
frightened, especially since he considered the acquisition of the Caspian littoral a
necessary addition tothe acquisition of the littoral of the Baltic. InApril 172 3, he
wrote to Nepliuev that Russia would not permit any other power to establish
itself on theCaspian Sea.19
Early the next year Constantinople learned of the conclusion of a treaty
between Peter and Tahmasp. Inaconversation with Nepliuev held on 3 January
1724, the Rais-efTendi expressed surprise atsuch an action since inOttoman eyes
Iran nolonger had a Shah but was a Turkish possession, and therefore the Tsar
was signing treaties with some unknown person. Nepliuev maintained the
legitimacy ofTahmasp's title and the validity ofthe treaty ofSaint Pertersburg.
The twopowers had reached a deadlock. However, behind the scenes the
French ambassador worked feverishly toprevent war.20 His mediation led tothe
conclusion on 24 June 1724 ofa treaty between Russia and the Porte, dividing
north-western Persia between thetwo powers in such a way as to leave the
Caspian provinces of Iran in Russian hands, the Turks acquiring most of
Azarbaijan and much ofTranscaucasia. Peter undertook, moreover, "to see that
Tahmasp gives up, either voluntarily or under compulsion, allthe provinces"
acquired by the Turks.
But if Tahmasp should oppose stubbornly the implementation of this treaty and refuseto surrender the provinces already conquered by the Sublime Porte from the Persian Empire, as well as those on the Caspian Sea which he has granted tothe Tsar under the treaties concluded between His Tsarist Majesty and Tahmasp, the Tsar and the Sublime Porte will take common action to place the Persian Empire, apart from the provinces already partitioned between themselves, under aruler who shall possess it inperpetuity . . .

provinces which thetwoEmpires have conquered, the two Empires will unite to obtain
redress with their combined forces.21
Now that the Persian state had virtually ceased to exist, the Tsar thought of
the future. He wasconcerned for the safety of his newly acquired territories and
ordered the fortifications at Holy Cross and Darband tobe strengthened.He
sought economic information, asking questions about preserved and dried fruit,
copper, "white oil", and lemons, samples of which, cooked in sugar, had to be
sent to him in Saint Petersburg. Hewas determined to attach Gilanand
Mazandaran permanently to Russia. In May 1724 the Tsar wrote to Matiushkin,
Russian commander in Rasht, that he should invite "Armenians and other
Christians, if there are such, toGilan and Mazandaran and settle them, while
Muslims should be very quietly, so that they would not know it, diminished in
number asmuch aspossible".22
Yet the Tsar's Persian adventure was afailure. In spite of Iran's prostration,
the campaign proved costly. Of the 61,039 m e n who took part in it 36,664 did
not return.23 Grave damage was inflicted onareas occupied by the Russians.
Thus inGilan one of the consequences of occupation was the rapid decline of
sericulture "when many of those involved in the production of silk fled the
province. It took years for the industry to revive."24 Perhaps the only long-term
consequence was the consciousness onthe part of Russia's rulers that their
armies had once marched beyond the Caucasus, that the Russian flag had flown
over the southern shore ofthe Caspian Sea.
Peter the Great died early in 1725. His immediate successors, the Empress
Catherine I, a woman of far less intelligence and experience than Peter, and Peter
II, adissolute young boy, were much more interested in Holstein and Kurland
than in Iran. Though the government quickly embarked upon a policy of retreat
from the East, Shah Tahmasp was unable to take advantage of the change. Iran
was still ruled by the Afghans, whose new leader, Ashraf, Iran's second Afghan
ruler, had won some successes against the Turks and was seeking accommoda
tion with Russia to consolidate his position. Before the Russians began negotia
tions with the new usurper, they had already decided that the seventeen infantry
regiments and seven cavalry regiments still on duty in Persia would no longer be

reinforced. Yet Ashraf made no demands. Quite the contrary. He was willingto
recognize the treaty of Saint Petersburg which Shah Tahmasp had long ago
repudiated. InFebruary 1729 inRasht a treaty was signed between Ashraf and
the Russians, confirming the treaty of 1723 and exchanging Mazandaran and
Astarabad, neither of which Russia ever held, for Shirvan in the Caucasus.
Russian merchants were granted free transit across Iran to Bukhara and India.25
The treaty with Ashraf never came into force. Afghan power in Iran
collapsed as quickly as it had arisen. Early in 1730 Shah Tahmasp, whose cause
had revived with the support ofNadir, anAfshar tribesman, sent anenvoy to
Moscow. The purpose of the mission was to secure Russian support for the
expulsion ofthe Afghans, even at the price of belatedly ratifying the treaty of
Saint Petersburg and conceding toRussia the Caspian provinces. Tahmasp was
prepared to pay an exceedingly high price for help heno longer needed and
Russia could not provide. Inthe negotiations inMoscow the Persian ambassa
dor emphasized that ifIran received no Russian help against her enemies, Russia
would have togive up all Persian territories, though friendship and commerce
would notbe affected.26
The Russian College (ministry) ofForeign Affairs discussed the entire range
of problems raised by Shah Tahmasp's proposals. In a paper entitled "A
Dissertation on Measures for a Successful Termination of Persian Affairs"
presented tothe new empress, Anna Ivanovna, the College stated that initially
Russia and Turkey had undertaken to act in Iran with mutual consent. However,
Ashraf's power had compelled the Turks tobreak their agreement with Russia
and conclude atreaty with the Afghan chief without Russian acquiescence. Now
Ashraf was defeated by the legitimate Shah who was likely toestablish himself
firmly on the throne. The Porte was arming forwar to defend the territorial
acquisitions she had made in Iran. The Turks were asking Russia to act in
accordance with the treaty of 1724 and inviting joint action against Tahmasp.
However, while Russia, following the Ottoman example, had made her own
peace with Ashraf, she never broke relations with Tahmasp. War and occupa
tion of Persian territory were costly and the advantages were far below original
expectations. Russian commanders in Iran, Field Marshal Prince V.V.
Dolgorukov and his successor, General V.I. Levashev, had already been
instructed that ifthere appeared inPersia aruler capable of maintaining himself

in power, Russia should make peace with him "even at the cost of ceding the
occupied territories".27
The Empress approved thepolicy outlined by theCollege of Foreign Affairs
and opened negotiations with Tahmasp. Russian diplomats were most
unfavourably impressed by conditions at the Persian court which they called
"bad, astonishing, and depraved". Though the Persians were disunited and
afraid of one another, they were full of pride and ambition that made them feel
the wisest in theworld. Such opinions from itsdiplomats, coupled with thenews
of a Persian defeat at Yerevan (Erivan), made the Russian government reverse
its views, arrest the Persian ambassador in Moscow, and prepare for a resump
tion of hostilities.28
However, the fear that Tahmasp might give in to the Turks or even enter an
alliance with them induced theRussians to return to negotiations. V.I. Levashev
and P.P. Shafirov, an outstanding diplomat, urged himnot to permit Ottoman
expansion at theexpense of Persia, but to gather an army andusetheservices of
Tahmasp Quli Khan (the future Nadir Shah). They were not optimistic.
We doubt that ourrepresentations would succeed inview ofhis weakness after the defeat [by the Turks] and of his mad actions resulting from drunkenness. If he were notso debauched, hadgood commanders, andpreserved order, with thenumerical superiority of his forces over the Turkish forces he would have emerged victorious from the
struggle.29
To prevent Tahmasp from giving in to the Turks, Levashev and Shafirov
sent an emissary to Tahmasp Quli Khan (Nadir) to assure himof Russia's good
will and urge him to act against the Ottomans.
Negotiations dragged on for more than a year. With the expulsion of the
Afghans and the revival of the Iranian state it became clear to the Russians that
withdrawal from the Caspian provinces wasinevitable. On i February 1732, a
treaty of peace, amity, and commerce wassigned at Rasht, restoring Astarabad,
Mazandaran, and Gilan to Persia, and establishing regular commercial, diplo
matic, andconsular relations. Provinces north of the River Kur (Kura) were to
remain in Russian hands until the Shah expelled his enemies (read the Turks)
from all his domains.30
Events moved swiftly. Shah Tahmasp's incompetence finally cost himhis
throne. The brilliant warrior, Nadir, assumed the regency and the conduct of

foreign affairs. Seeing in the Ottoman Empire Iran's main enemy, hewent to
war with theTurks, which was, of course, pleasing to Russia. Prince Sergei
Dmitrievich Golitsyn was sent to Iran to prevent Nadir from making peace with
the Turks. Before Golitsyn reached Isfahan inMay 1734, helearned that peace
had been made. Nevertheless, he attempted to influence Nadir by promising him
Russian help against thePorte.
Nadir assumed a proud andindependent stand. He told Golitsyn that if
circumstances compelled him to break with the Turks, he would prevail without
help from outside. He was angry because Russia made the return of Darband and
Baku conditional upon the liberation ofall Iranian territories from the Turks,
and went so far as to threaten to ally himself with Turkey and to march on
Moscow. Yet healso promised to resume his campaigns against the Turks if
Russia returned to Persia Darband andBaku.31
When shortly thereafter Persian troops laid siege to Ganja, Golitsyn sent
Nadir an engineer and four bombardiers in Persian attire. They were to help
reduce thefortress, an art in which Nadir and hiswarriors had limited skill.
Golitsyn also informed Nadir that the Empress was prepared to relinquish the
remaining Persian territories onthe sole condition that they never be surren
dered to a third power. The Russian government felt somewhat uneasy about
such concessions but hoped tocompensate itself at Turkey's expense now that
Nadir had once again resumed hostilities against thePorte.
Though unable to take Ganja quickly, Nadir attacked theTurks at Kars,
defeating them in two major battles. This "favourable turn of events" prompted
the Empress, who was anxious to start a warwith Turkey, to conclude a
definitive treaty with Iran in 1735, at Ganja, giving up all of the Petrine
conquests, including Baku, Darband, and even the fortress of the Holy Crossin
the khanate ofTarqu. Thus came toan end the first serious encounter between
Iran andRussia.
For nearly half a century thereafter Iran's relations with Russia were ofsmall
significance to either state. Nadir Shah's foreign wars and domestic terror
undermined thenation's economy andinflicted severe damage on thesocial
order. His assassination brought no relief but plunged the country into a long
period of internal dissension and anarchy. Even Karim Khan Zand, much
idealized by historians, did not create the base on which amodern state could be
built. It was precisely in the years following the death of Nadir Shah thatthe
disparity between Iran and Russia grew tothe extent that made itimpossible for

Iran to withstand Russia in the first three decades of the 19th century. When
Catherine II undertook tointerfere inTranscaucasia and todispute Iran's claims
to Georgia, the enormous difference in thepower of the two states was not yet
obvious. By 1828 it wasclear to all but the most foolish.
Of Nadir Shah's successors not one had an explicit policy inregard to Russia.
The ephemeral rulers who followed him had only the vaguest notion asto what
Russia was and what could be expected of her. Karlm Khan Zand was no
exception, neither was Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar. The Russian emperors
and empresses whosucceeded one another between 1725and 1762 were no
better informed about Iran. Catherine II was the best read ofthem all, yet she too
had inadequate knowledge of Persia. Her advisors were deeply ignorant. Thus
Platon Zubov, oneof Catherine's favourites anda "self-proclaimed expert on
Iran, was ofthe opinion that the Iranian new year's day, NoRuz, was May 14",
and General Gudovich, after many years ofservice in the Caucasus, believed that
the conflict between the Shfis and the Sunnls wasof no importance.32
Catherine's interest in Iran was,on the one hand, a consequence ofher
Turkish policies and, on the other, the result of the view long prevalent in
Europe that trade with India could make any nation rich. Pursuing schemesfor
the encirclement of the Ottoman Empire, Prince Grigorii Aleksandrovich
Potemkin turned to theCaucasus where hehoped to create an Armenian state
from the khanates of Qarabagh, Qarajadagh, Erivan (Yerevan) and
Nakhchivan, "then addGanjeh andother parts of Azerbaijan to Georgia,and
use thetwo enlarged states as a bulwark against thePorte".33 Potemkin's plan
called formilitary intervention in the Caucasus in 1784, but the outbreak of war
with Turkey the previous year made it necessary to use other means.
It was then that Russia approached cAli Murad Khan Zand, one ofthe
numerous contenders for thePersian crown, who hadindicated that if Russia
helped him against his rivals, he would be willing to give up to her certain
territories inthe north. Unknowingly cAli Murad Khan was opening the door to
foreign involvement in the problems of succession, an involvement which
would increase with time and become a source of many difficulties. cAli Murad
Khan, who developed second thoughts about allying himself with Russia, died
in 1785without having made any serious commitments.34
Anarchy in Iran provided Russia with opportunities to penetrate the
Caucasus and to re-establish her power onthe Persian shores of the Caspian. In
Transcaucasia her principal ally was Christian Georgia, whose ruler, King

Erekle II, constantly begged Catherine for protection against his Muslim
neighbours. Along the Caspian the Russians began to cultivate local rulers,
established a fortified depot near Rasht and, in 1781, landed near Astarabad.
Count Voinovich, head ofthe expedition, was instructed by the Empress to
create a fortified base in theGulf of Astarabad to protect merchants against raids
by Transcaspian Turcomans. TheRussian historian V.A. Potto writes that the
Voinovich expedition was closely connected with Catherine's plans for the
conquest ofthe northern provinces of Persia.35
Russia chose Astarabad because of its strategic location on thetrade route to
Bukhara andIndia, whose attraction Catherine II felt as strongly as hadPeter I
half a century earlier. Astarabad was considered particularly suitable because
Valerian Zubov believed it tobe "only about one thousand versts across the
mountains" from India, or about half the actual distance.36 Voinovich was
instructed to obtain the co-operation of the ruler of Astarabad, Agha
Muhammad Khan Qajar, another contender for the throne of Iran.
Agha Muhammad Khan waswilling topromote international trade and to
secure Russia's good will, which might prove useful in his struggle for power;
but he wasnot prepared to seetheerection of a fort large enough to hold 1,000
defenders. Later he claimed to have received a report that theVoinovich
expedition wasdirected against him. Strong willed and resolute, Agha
Muhammad Khan acted atonce. Themembers of the Russian expedition were
arrested and expelled from Iran. Catherine never forgave this offence against
her, andtold Zubov fifteen years later that Agha Muhammad must be punished
for it.37
Agha Muhammad Khan did not permit feelings tointerfere with political
calculation. Having expelled the Russians, he had no desire toexacerbate his
relations with them. In 1783 he sent an envoy to Saint Petersburg in an attempt
to ease tensions between himself and the Empress. She refused toreceive his
ambassador and sent him back with a note that she did not consider Agha
Muhammad Khan the legitimate ruler of Mazandaran and Astarabad, and that
his actions hadputhimin danger of "stern punishment".38 In spite of the insult
and of the deep suspicion with which he regarded Russia since the Voinovich
incident, Agha Muhammad Khan continued to seek a modusvivendiwith the
Empress.

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE SOVIET UNION
One ofhis rivals innorthern Iran was Hidayat-Allah Khan, who owedhis
position as ruler of Gilan to Muhammad Hasan Khan Qajar, Agha
Muhammad's father. After Muhammad Hasan's death, Hidayat-Allah owed
allegiance to Karim Khan and All Murad Zand. In 1781-2 he refused to submit
to Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar and was driven into exile inShirvan. Return
ing four years later, he again antagonized the formidable Agha Muhammad by
sheltering thelatter's rebel brother, Murtaza Qull Khan. Imagining Russian
suzerainty less severe, Hidayat-Allah asked forRussia's protection. The Rus
sians asked him to pay token tribute, to surrender to them his son as hostage, and
to cede to Russia the port of Anzali (Enzeli). Since Agha Muhammad had turned
his attention elsewhere, Hidayat-Allah felt no compulsion to accept such terms.
Offended by Hidayat-Allah's behaviour, the Russian consul inAnzali urged
Agha Muhammad Khan to attack Gilan. Agha Muhammad washappy to
eliminate a rival. He quickly defeated Hidayat-Allah who took refuge aboard a
Russian ship. The Russians surrendered the unfortunate Hidayat-Allah to his
mortal enemy, theKhan of Shaft, who promptly puthim to death.39
However, relations between the victorious Qajar and the Russians deterio
rated again when Agha Muhammad, accusing theRussian consul of having
secretly appropriated Hidayat-Allah's treasure, demanded payment of2,000,000
roubles. The Russians refused. Inretaliation Agha Muhammad imposed a tariff
on Russian imports. On their part the Russians began to support Agha
Muhammad's brother and rival, Murtaza Qull Khan, who was willing to cede
Anzali and to promise thesubmission to Russia of Gilan, Mazandaran,and
Astarabad. Fora short time he received minor military assistance from the
Russians. Later they subsidized him and permitted him to live in Russia as a
refugee.40
In the closing decades of the 18th century Georgia was a more important
element in Russo-Persian relations than Astarabad or even Gilan. Unlike Peter I,
Catherine viewed Georgia as thepivot of her Caucasian policy, for Georgia
could be used as abase of operations against both Iran and the Ottoman Empire.
Moreover, a port onthe Georgian coast ofthe Black Sea would provide great
advantages to the Russian navy. Catherine invoked the example of Peterthe
Great, but only asa justification fordecisions and policies arrived at on other
grounds.41

heavy price for their enmity: both lost their thrones, one dying in exile, the other
in captivity. Nadir Shah restored Persian suzerainty over Georgia. The young
and brilliant ruler of Kakhet i-K3art3li, Erekle IT, who accompanied him in many
battles and earned hisadmiration, was able to maintain Georgia's autonomy
through the Zand period. When threatened from outside, Erekle asked for
Russian protection, which became especially desirable because ofthe Ottoman
threat. General Count Pavel Sergeevich Potemkin, commander of Russian
troops north ofthe Caucasus, urged Erekle torecognize Catherine's suzerainty
over Georgia. In July 1783 at the fortress of Georgievsk the kingdom of
K3artDli-Kakhet3i, the principal Georgian state, was placed under Russian
protection. In November 1784 a token detachment of Russian troops entered
Tbilisi (Tiflis) andKing Erekle swore allegiance to the Empress.42
The arrival of Russian forces in Georgia upset thedelicate and unstable
balance of power among the Turks, the Georgians, the Persians, and the
Azerbaijani khans ofTranscaucasia. Turkey communicated her fears to France
whose ambassador in Saint Petersburg, Louis-Philippe de Segure, remonstrated
with Prince G. A. Potemkin and gained from him the impression that Russia was
prepared to defend her new acquisition byforce. Such, however, was notthe
case. With the start ofanother Russo-Turkish war in 1787 the Russian troops
were withdrawn from Georgia, leaving Erekle todefend his country as besthe
could.
In the next several years Russia was too concerned with Turkey, Poland, and
the European consequences of the French revolution to give Georgia much
attention. Even the consolidation of the power of Agha Muhammad Khan, who
had gradually emerged as the sole ruler of Iran, did not divert the Empress from
her preoccupation with the West. In 1791, when Agha Muhammad was in
Tabriz, Erekle asked General I.V.Gudovich, Russian commander of the Cauca
sian Line, formilitary aid, butSaint Petersburg didnotjudge it expedient to
send troops to Georgia.43
For Agha Muhammad Khan the reintegration of Georgia into the Iranian
Empire was part ofthe same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, Tabriz,
and Kirman under his rule. Georgia was a province ofIran like Khurasan. Its
permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way as
one would resist an attempt atthe separation of Fars orGilan. Itwas, therefore,
natural for Agha Muhammad to make every effort to subdue the khans of
Azarbaijan and put down what in Iranian eyes was treason on the part of the Vail

of Georgia. Cruel, suspicious and bloodthirsty even by the standards of his time
and place, Agha Muhammad conducted the reunification ofIran with a total
disregard for human life. Dreadful massacres were the usual accompaniment of
his conquests; smoking ruins marked the path of his troops. In 1795 Georgia,
abandoned by Russia, fell toAgha Muhammad's cavalry and experienced the
full force of his wrath. Tbilisi (Tiflis) was sacked. Ten to fifteen thousand
persons, mostly children and adolescents, were led away tocaptivity in Iran.
After only a week Agha Muhammad was gone.
Upon learning of the fall of Tbilisi General I.V. Gudovich put the blame on
the Georgians themselves. He also proposed a plan for the invasion of Iran.
With the encouragement of the Zubov brothers Catherine adopted the proposal
and put Valerian Zubov incharge, thus giving additional importance to the
enterprise. Theobjective of the campaign wasthe overthrow of Agha
Muhammad Khan and his replacement with the tame Qajar, Murtaza QulT. An
air ofoptimism pervaded Saint Petersburg. Before he left for the Caucasusin
January 1796, Valerian Zubov boasted to F.V. Rostopchin that he would be in
Isfahan by September.44
Catherine and Agha Muhammad were not fated to see their armies meet. The
Empress's death brought Tsar Paul tothe throne. Paul's dislike ofhis mother
extended not only to her favourites but to her policies as well. The Zubov
brothers were dismissed and the troops recalled from theCaucasus. Agha
Muhammad Khan, the recently crowned Shah of Iran, was jubilant, attributing
Russia's retreat from Georgia to the fear he thought he inspired in all his
enemies. Nothing stood between him and the helpless Georgians. In mid June
1797, three days after he had occupied Shusha, Agha Muhammad Khan was
murdered in his tent. The Persian army fell apart. Khans, military commanders,
provincial governors, allexpected another struggle forsuccession, perhaps
another period of anarchy, but this time there was to benoanarchy. Agha
Muhammad Khan's favourite nephew and designated heir, Baba Khan,
mounted the throne with relative ease asFath cAli Shah.
At the beginning of his reign, Fath cAli Shah, not yet secure in his position,
sought improved relations with Russia. Tsar Paul received Iran's peaceful
overtures favourably, making it possible to settle a number of outstanding issues
amicably. Thus he agreed that Russian warships should not enter the port of
Anzali needlessly; that Russian merchants pay duty ongoods imported into
Iran; that the export to Iran of 18,000 tons of iron, a prohibited item, be

permitted. Paul was determined to protect Georgia, but hewas anxious to
negotiate with the new ruler whom he regarded as only one of several contend
ers for thePersian throne and to whom he continued to refer in official
correspondence as Sardar Baba Khan even after Fath CA1I Shah had been
crowned on21 March 1798.45
Minor improvements in relations between Iran and Russia could not disguise
the essential fact that short of a Persian surrender of Georgia, peace could not be
preserved. Yet itwas impossible for any Persian who had ambitions to rule the
whole of Iran rather than govern asection, — as Shahrukh, Nadir's grandson in
Mashhad, had done, or Karlm Khan Zand - to abandon Transcaucasia, an area
which had formed part ofthe concept ofIran for centuries. The ancient ties
could be severed only by a superior force from outside. It was therefore
inevitable that Fath CA1I Shah should continue Agha Muhammad Khan's policy
of restoring central authority beyond the rivers Aras and Kur.
In the summer of 1798 the Shah wrote to Giorgi XII,the new king of KDartDli
Kakhet^i, commanding him to submit.
Our lofty standard will proceed to your lands and, just as occurred in the time of Agha Mohammed Khan, so now you will be subjected to doubly increased devastation, and
Georgia will again be annihilated, and the Georgian people given over to our wrath.46
Once again the King ofGeorgia appealed for protection tothe Tsar. Paul
listened with sympathy. His policy in Europe was undergoing a change that
made him contemplate anti-French action inanalliance with Turkey. Napo
leon's Egyptian campaign drew Paul's attention to theMiddle East,and
imparted afresh urgency to old schemes of dominating Georgia. He ordered a
small force to proceed there, making inevitable renewed conflict with Iran.In
September 1799Giorgi formally requested the Emperor to establish a protector
ate over Georgia. Two months later Russian troops entered Tiflis, to the cheers
of the inhabitants.
Petr Ivanovich Kovalenskii, the Tsar's envoy, assumed control of Georgia's
foreign relations and informed the Shah of Russia's determination to defend her
client. In reply Hajji Ibrahim Shirazi, the prime minister, reaffirmed Iran's
sovereignty over Georgia, threatened to enforce it with troops, and left no
doubt of the position of his government, to whom Paul's latest actions appeared
as acontinuation of the aggression initiated by his late mother. The subsequent
death ofKing Giorgi, the abolition ofGeorgia's monarchy, and her outright

annexation to Russia could only beinterpreted in Tehran asthe opening of a
general offensive that would, unless checked by force, tear away from Iran some
of her fairest provinces.
The need for assistance against Russia made Iran willing to contemplate
alliances with European states. Emissaries of revolutionary France had ap
peared in Tehran as early as 1796, when Agha Muhammad Khan was campaign
ing in Khurasan. Jean-Guillaume Bruguieres and Guillaume-Antoine Olivier,
both of whom believed in private that Agha Muhammad was acruel despot and
his attack onTiflis merely a looting expedition, warned Hajji Ibrahim Shirazi
against Russian encroachment on Georgia and advised resistance. French
attempts toenlist Iran asa collaborator against Russia and Britain alarmed the
British whose hold on India was still uncertain. Captain John Malcolm's mission
resulted inthe conclusion ofan Anglo-Persian treaty directed against possible
French penetration of the Middle East. Napoleon's offer ofalliance, brought to
Fath CA1IShah by Colonel Romieu, was ignored in spite of the French promise of
support against Russia.47
Tehran's diplomatic maneuvering had noeffect on Saint Petersburg.The
assassination of Tsar Paul in March 1801 only accelerated the growth of anti
Persian sentiment. Alexander I quickly restored Catherine's friends Platon and
Valerian Zubov to positions of influence. Valerian was particularly insistent that
the annexation ofGeorgia was amoral obligation. To him the frontier between
Russia and Iran should be drawn along the Kur and Aras rivers, which implied
the conquest of the khanates to the east and the south of Georgia. Alexander
shared such views. Moreover, like most Russians of his day, he hada low
opinion of the Persians andnothing but contempt for the Muslims of the
Caucasus.
The appointment in 1802 of Prince Pavel Dmitrievich Tsitsianov as com
mander-in-chief in the Caucasus marked the acceleration ofRussian expansion.
In spite of his Georgian origins, Tsitsianov was astrong Russian imperialist. His
"Europeanism" had the convert's ardour, and his loathing for the "Asiatics" or
"Persians", terms heused interchangeably, was intense. Hedenounced "Asi
atic" intrigue while acting treacherously toward the khans; fulminated against
"Asiatic" brutality while massacring Muslims; deplored "Asiatic" manners,
while writing toa local chieftain, "you have a dog's soul and a donkey's mind
. . . So long as you do not become afaithful tributary of my lord, the Emperor, I
shall harbour the desire to clean my boots inyour blood." Uniformly praised by
47 Ahmad Tajbakhsh, Tarlkh-i ravabit-i Iran va Riislya, p. 27. For further details, see Chapter 11, pp. 377-80.

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE SOVIET UNION
Russian historians, and frequently admired by Europeans, Tsitsianov was, to
the Persians and Caucasian Muslims, "the blood-letter".48
Tsitsianov proceeded systematically to impose Russian rule on the territories
adjacent to Georgia. Some khanates, among them Baku, Shakki, Shirvan, and
Qarabagh, submitted; others, such as Ganja and Erivan, refused, exposing
themselves to military attack. Tsitsianov was not even content with the Aras
Kur line asthe proposed Russo-Persian border. He actively worked forthe
annexation of Khiiy, Tabriz, and Gilan, and opposed every attempt at a peaceful
settlement ofthe conflict between his country and Iran.
Tsitsianov's attack on Ganja was a challenge to Abbas Mirza, heir to the
Persian throne andgovernor of Azarbaijan. The capture of the city was
accompanied by a massacre in which the Russians killed between i, 5 00 and 3,000
people. Among the victims were 5 00 Muslims who had taken refuge in a mosque
but were slaughtered nevertheless as an act of revenge, said Platon Zubov.49 The
town was sacked, its main mosque was converted into a church, and its very
name obliterated by being changed to Elizavetpol. Thousands of local inhabi
tants fled to Iran, spreading the news and arousing fear among the Persians. In
Tsitsianov's attack on Ganja the Iranians saw a direct invasion of their country's
territory. The issue was no longer one of imposing tribute on distant Lezghians
or even reasserting Persian suzerainty over Christian Georgia. The integrity of
Shici Iran had been violated. Fath All Shah, Abbas Mirza, and their leading
ministers feared that the fall of Azerbaijani bastions would expose the rest of the
empire to the Russians. Such afear of Russian aggression, of continued Russian
expansion, of the imposition of alien rule, explains the emotional intensity of the
Iranian response, and the way in which the clergy and the educated classes
encouraged resistance.
In the spring of 1804 Tsitsianov threatened Muhammad Khan of Erivan,
demanding that he recognize the Russian candidate as Catholicos of the Arme
nian Church at nearby Echmiadzin, give hostages, pay 80,000 roubles of tribute
annually, and surrender to the Russians all military supplies. Muhammad Khan,
whose family was held hostage in Iran, vacillated. At the end of June Tsitsianov
appeared before Erivan with 3,000 Russian infantry and Georgian and Arme
nian auxiliaries. Almost simultaneously Abbas Mirza arrived atthe head of a
Persian force of some 18,000 horsemen. The opening battle of the first Russo
Persian war was fought on 1July with indecisive results.
Contrary to Russian hopes and expectations, the war proved long, arduous

and costly. A year after the start of hostilities, the Russian government, now at
war with Napoleon against whom Tsar Alexander personally led an army, was
prepared tonegotiate a peace settlement. Count Adam Czartoryski informed
Tsitsianov ofthe possibility. Tsitsianov's reaction was entirely negative.He
bombarded the government with arguments that peace with Iran was neither
possible nordesirable. ThePersians must bepunished for having dared to resist.
Later he repeatedly expressed the opinion that the Shah would not in any event
make peace.50 Tsitsianov, who exercized enormous influence over the Tsar,
offered hisown"peace" plan. It included a campaign against Gilan, a foray asfar
as Qazvln, and insults tothe Shah, who was tobe told that ifhe gave up the
Caucasus down tothe Aras and paid an indemnity of 1,000,000 roubles, Iran
would be saved and Tehran spared destruction.51 Soon after Tsitsianov himself
perished in the war he had so vigorously promoted, the victim of a trap set for
him by one ofthe despised "Asiatics", or "Persians", Husain Qull Khan of
Baku.
Whatever hopes the Shah might have hadof British assistance vanished atthe
outset ofthe war because England was now Russia's ally against Napoleon.
However, the French were anxious toenter onto the scene. In May 1807 at
Finkenstein in Prussia, Iran and France signed a treaty of alliance openly
directed against Russia. Article 2proclaimed that "H. M. the Emperor of the
French, King of Italy, guarantees to H. M.the Emperor of Persia theintegrity of
his present territory." Article 3stated: "H. M.the Emperor of the French, King
of Italy, recognizes Georgia as belonging legitimately to H. M. the Emperor of
Persia." Napoleon promised to make every effort to compel Russia to withdraw
from Georgia, and to help reorganize the Persian army "in accordance with
principles of European military art". In return Iran would goto war with
England, urge theAfghans to attack India, andpermit thefree passage of French
troops should Napoleon decide to send anexpedition to India.52
To implement the treaty Napoleon sent a military mission to Iran under
General C M . de Gardane. The mission had not yet arrived atits destination
when Napoleon defeated Russia andat Tilsit forced upon Alexander a
humiliating treaty, making Russia his reluctant ally. Thereupon the Emperor of
the French quickly lost interest in Iran. General Gardane managed to hang onin
Tehran till heeventually had to leave when a British mission arrived in the
capital to conclude yet another treaty. French attempts to mediate between

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE SOVIET UNION
Russia and Persia were doomed to failure because Alexander would not relin
quish Georgia and Fath AllShah would notaccept its loss. Napoleonhad
neither the will nor the means to compel agreement. The Franco-Persian alliance
was annulled. Britain promised to assist Iran in any war with aEuropean power,
provided Iran were not the aggressor, astipulation certain tolead tocontradic
tory interpretations.53 The war in theCaucasus dragged on for several more
years. With Napoleon's invasion ofRussia in 1812, Russia and Britain became
allies once more. Iran was largely isolated. The defeat of Napoleon enabled
Russia to allocate greater resources to the Caucasian front. The difference
between modern, well-drilled, well-equipped, disciplined armies and the tribal
levies of Abbas Mirza was decisive. AtAslanduz onthe Aras 2,260 Russians
under General P.S. Kotliarevskii fought a two-day battle with 30,000 Persians
under Abbas Mirza, killing 1,200 enemy soldiers, and capturing 5 37 atalossto
themselves of only 127 dead and wounded. Though onoccasion the Persians
fought well, for instance atLankaran, where the same Kotliarevskii lost 950 of
1,500 men under his command and was himself permanently disabled, the war
was obviously lost.
British mediation made itpossible for the two sides to negotiate a peace treaty
which was signed on 14 October 1813, at the village ofGulistan. By itsterms
Iran lost many of its Caucasian provinces: Qarabagh and Ganja, Shirvan and
Baku, Georgia and parts ofTalish. No power other than Russia was permitted
warships on the Caspian Sea. This provision left the Persian shores vulnerableto
Russian attack. The treaty also dealt with commercial matters andwith the
establishment ofpermanent diplomatic missions. Perhaps the most dangerous
provisions of the Gulistan treaty were those that promised Russian recognition
and support of the legitimate heir to the Persian throne and those which
delineated the border between the two states. These provisions were so vague as
to invite misinterpretation and conflict.
It is likely that neither the Shah nor the Tsar regarded the treaty of Gulistan as
definitive. Abbas Mirza considered it merely a truce and prepared foranother
war.54 In the interim the Persian government sent Abu^l-Hasan Khan Shirazi,
formerly ambassador inLondon, to Saint Petersburg toplead forthe rectifica
tion of the frontier, particularly in areas where Russian troops had advanced
beyond the original demarcation line, as happened in Talish, for instance.
Russia's foreign minister, Count Karl von Nesselrode, rejected AbuDl-Hasan
Khan's plea. However, the Russian government was prepared to make minor

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE SOVIET UNION
concessions. In 1817 it sent thenew Commander-in-Chief in the Caucasus,
General A.P. Ermolov, to Tehran.
Ermolov was no peace-maker. Arrogant, tyrannical, filled with contempt for
"Asiatics", he was dedicated to the expansion of Russia and firmly committed to
violence asa means ofachieving his ends. His conquests, his punitive expedi
tions, hissavage inhumanity struck hatred andfear into all those whom his
power could reach. Inspite of specific instructions to make an attempt at settling
the issues outstanding between the two states, Ermolov behaved asif he had
been sent toIran toprovoke war. His very passage from the frontier to Tabriz
and Tehran turned into military reconnaissance.
In his dealings with the Persians Ermolov deliberately violated the rulesof
etiquette, refusing totake off his shoes and toput onred socks before entering
the presence ofthe Shah orthe heir tothe throne. When it was pointed out to
him that the French and British envoys complied with the custom, he "categori
cally refused to fulfil Abbas Mlrza's demand, stating", quite illogically, "that he
had come 'notwith the sentiment of a Napoleon-spy [sic], not with profit
calculations of a store-clerk from a merchandizing nation', butwith sincere
intentions to improve Russo-Iranian relations".55
Ermolov put before the Shah a series ofrequests which, coming from him,
assumed the character ofdemands. Russia wanted an alliance with Iran against
the Porte, free passage for Russian troops through Astarabad toCentral Asiato
fight Khivans and Bukharans who plundered Russian merchants, the opening of
a permanent Russian consulate in Gllan, and the employment of Russian officers
to train the Persian army. Fath All Shah, unwilling to break with the Ottomans,
was evasive about the alliance but turned down all the other proposals. When he
asked Ermolov forterritorial concessions, the general replied that the areas in
question had been conquered by the sword and not one inch would be returned
to Iran.56 In a report to Saint Petersburg, written upon hisreturn to Tim's,
Ermolov argued against restoring any territory to Iran because the slightest
concession would shake Russia's prestige among the peoples of the Caucasus.57
Ermolov's opposition to the improvement of relations with Persia continued
over the years. In 1818 Abbas Mirza sent Muhammad Hasan Khan to Saint
Petersburg with gifts forthe Tsar and the request that Alexander I recognize
Abbas Mirza asheir to the throne. Ermolov advised against recognition,but
the Tsar disregarded the advice. Undaunted, Ermolov became a champion of
Muhammad AllMirza, who was A^bbas Mirza's elder half-brother butwas

excluded from succession because his mother was a commoner. Muhammad All
Mirza's frustration and envy made him willing toserve any party that opposed
Abbas Mirza.58 Several years later, Count Ivan Fedorovich Paskevich, himself
an imperialist and aproponent of conquests, submitted to Nesselrode areport in
which he challenged Ermolov's Iranian policy. Paskevich, whose expert advisor
was the brilliant playwright Aleksandr Sergeevich Griboedov, found that
Ermolov's support of Muhammad AH MIrza was harmful andhis general
attitude partly responsible for the outbreak ofthe second Russo-Iranian war.59
Fath CA1I Shah and cAbbas MIrza placed high hopes in the efficacy of the
Anglo-Persian treaty of 1814 which promised Iran either aforce from India or a
yearly subsidy if Iran became a victim of aggression by a European power.
British officers were already drilling A.bbas MIrza's troops, helping him and his
capable minister, MIrza AbuDl-Qasim Qa°im-Maqam, to modernize the army,
though noone in Iran seemed to have a true picture of the vast inequality of
economic, demographic and technological resources between Russia and Persia.
The lessons of 1804—13 had notbeen learnt.
In the years preceding the second Russo-Iranian war Russia followed two
mutually contradictory policies. Saint Petersburg was cautious and slow, while
Ermolov was provocative and impulsive. The death of Alexander I, the military
mutiny of December 1825 in the capital, and the uncertainties felt bythe new
Tsar, made his government wish to explore the possibility of reaching an
understanding with Iran. Nicholas I sent Prince A.S. Menshikov ostensibly to
inform the Shah of the new Tsar's accession. The Prince was also totry making
arrangements for the stabilization of the frontier. Yet Menshikov, like Ermolov,
was not prepared forsubstantive concessions. His mission failed asa waveof
anti-Russian sentiment fanned bytheculama swept the country.
The steady encroachment of Russian troops along the frontier in the
Caucasus, Ermolov's brutal punitive expeditions and misgovernment, drove
large numbers of Muslims, and even some Georgian Christians, into exile in
Iran. Aqa Sayyid Muhammad IsfahanI, a prominent mujtahidm Karbala, agitated
tot jihad. In June 1826, the time ofMenshikov's visit, a number of prominent
ulama waited on the Shah at Sultanlya. The clergy issued 2ifatvadeclaring that
opposition to jihad was a sign of unbelief.60
Subject tothis wave ofclerical pressure, Fath All Shah treated Menshikov
coldly. Perhaps the Persian ruler, asa perceptive Russian visitor pointed out,

that the internal disorders which occurred in the bosom of our fatherland and the rivalry of two brothers seeking the throne forced the Sovereign to take such humble action and seek the protection orthe help ofthe Persian court.61
Whatever Fath cAli Shah's analysis of the situation may have been, his actions
were not calculated towin over the overbearing and tactless Menshikov.
On his side of the border Ermolov watched the progress of Russo-Iranian
negotiations. InJanuary 1826 Nicholas I,preoccupied with the Turkish ques
tion and thefate of the Balkans, wrote to thecommander-in-chief in the
Caucasus that
It would not be wise to contemplate arupture with the Persians or to increase mutual dissatisfaction. On the contrary, we must make every attempt amicably to terminate the quarrels that have arisen and assure them of our sincere desire to establish peaceful ties with them.62
Ermolov disregarded the wishes of the Tsar.
In May 1826 Russian troops occupied and fortified Mirak, a locality in the
Erivan khanate. The Persians protested against the new encroachment justas
they protested against Russia's advance in the area of lake Gokcha. Mirza
Muhammad Sadiq, whom the Iranian government sent toSaint Petersburg to
discuss the issue, was detained by Ermolov inTiflis. Meanwhile the Russian
occupation of Mirak effectively closed the Persian border and disrupted
Erivan's commerce.63 Goaded byErmolov, cAbbas Mirza struck on28 July
1826. However, of Ermolov his eventual successor in the post of commander
in-chief in the Caucasus, General Paskevich, wrote that "the present chief's
ambition produced the new war — in this everyone is agreed".64
At the onset Iranian troops achieved considerable success. Ermolov dis
played strange passivity and was eventually removed from his command. A
Persian corps approached Tiflis, other Persian detachments advanced along the
Caspian shore. Then the Russians moved in their reserves. Denis Davydov, the
famous cavalry leader of the Napoleonic war, barred the way to Tiflis. General
V.G. Madatov utterly defeated the army led by Muhammad Mirza, the future
Shah. Abbas Mirza himself was badly beaten by Paskevich at Ganja. Sooner or
later the Iranians had to realize that they could not defeat Russia in war. Their
newly modernized army was no match for Russian troops led by veteransof
Smolensk, Borodino and Leipzig. This time the struggle was short and the
outcome decisive.

RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE SOVIET UNION
The treaty signed by the two states at Turkmanchai on22 February 1828
recorded in an international document the new inequality of status between Iran
and Russia. To the territories lost by the treaty of Gulistan were now added the
khanates of Erivan and Nakhchivan. Iran agreed to pay Russia an indemnity of
20,000,000 roubles, a vast sum fora country with a primitive economy. All
prisoners of war, no matter when captured, were to be returned. Iran was not to
permit the many hundreds of Russian deserters who joined Persian forces, and
even formed their own very effective battalion, tobe stationed near the new
frontier. The commercial treaty appended tothe peace treaty accorded Russia
further privileges and laid the basis of Russian influence in Iran. Russian subjects
there were permitted to buy houses and shops which Iranian officials were
prohibited from entering, "at least without having recourse in case of necessity
to the authorization ofthe Russian Minister, Charge d'Affaires or Consul".65
Moreover a regime of capitulations was established, virtually exempting Rus
sian subjects from Iranian jurisdiction. The Treaty of Turkmanchai set the tone
for the relations between Russia and Iran for the next ninety years.
The Tsar appointed as his first post-war minister to Tehran A.S. Griboedov,
the author of the sparkling comedy Woefrom Wit. As a diplomat Griboedov was
raised in the Ermolov—Paskevich school, though his native intelligence and
personal refinement saved him from the excesses typical of an average imperial
ist. He set himself the goal "through long and uniform action, always correct
and frank . . .to triumph over Asiatic suspicion and to turn into conviction on
the part of Persia that fateful necessity which has compelled her toaccept our
peace conditions".66 Griboedov also believed that Iran should be compelledto
fight Turkey with whom Russia was then at war. The Tsar did not wish to
endanger his relations with the British and the ministry of foreign affairs deleted
from its instructions to Griboedov references to the minister's freedom, in case
Russian and British policies clashed in Europe, to exercise anti-British influence,
based upon the presence of Russian troops on the border and the availabilityto
Griboedov oflarge sums of money.67
In the Ermolov tradition, Griboedov, who did not entirely agree with the
"somnolent ministry of foreign and superannuated affairs", urged Paskevich to
write directly to the Tsar that to "order him [cAbbas MIrza] to fight the Turks"
and to promise that Russia would put him on the throne would cost her nothing,

"yet ourinfluence in Asia would overcome that of any other power".68
Griboedov's behaviour in Tehran conformed to his beliefs in the uses of power.
He offended the Persians by entering the Shah's presence with his boots on and
sitting in a chair during audiences, but most of all by his ruthless implementation
of Article 13 ofthe Treaty of Turkmanchai.
Griboedov not only extended protection tothose Caucasian captives who
sought to go home but actively promoted the return of even those who did not
volunteer. Large numbers of Georgian and Armenian captives had lived in Iran
since 1804 or as far back as 1795. Many had embraced Islam and married
Persians. Afew had risen tohigh positions at court and in the government.
Persuading them toleave necessitated the invasion of Muslim households and
the violation of the Persian notion of the sacredness of the home.69 When
Griboedov gave refuge inthe Russian legation toone ofthe Shah's eunuchs,
Yacqub Markanian, and detained some women from the harem ofthe former
prime minister, Allahyar Khan Asaf al-Daula, rumours spread that Yacqub had
foresworn Islam and that the women were being forced todo the same.
It was the prominent Tehran mujtahid, Mirza Masih, who precipitated the
crisis by reminding the crowds that the penalty for apostates was death. He also
sent aclerical delegation to the Zill al-Sultan, governor of Tehran, todemand
that the Russians release the women they had extracted from the harems. In spite
of being aware of the gravity of the situation Griboedov fanned theflamesof
Persian discontent. On 10February, in a note to Mirza Hasan Khan, the foreign
minister, heblustered: "The undersigned, having become convinced by the
dishonest behaviour of the Persian government that Russian subjects cannot be
assured . . .even of personal safety, will request the most gracious permission of
his great Sovereign to leave Persia for the Russian borders".70 That same night
Manuchihr Khan Muctamad al-Daula, a Tiflisi Armenian captured in 1804
who had risen topositions ofgreat power, warned Griboedov ofdanger and
advised him to leave the legation. Griboedov refused. The very next day an ugly
crowd, inflamed by the culama, attacked the Russian legation and massacred all
but one member ofits large staff.
The Russian government, not wishing to break relations with Iran while

waging war on Turkey, took a conciliatory attitude. Moreover, Saint
Petersburg knew that Griboedov "in all probability tosome extent provoked
the terrible catastrophe . . .In any event, I share entirely your opinion that the
Persian government had nothing to do with it", Nesselrode wrote to
Paskevich.71 A special mission led by Fath CA1I Shah's fifth son, Khusrau Mirza,
travelled to Saint Petersburg to apologize to the Tsar. On 24 August 1829 ina
solemn audience the Tsar expressed his willingness to forgive.
Once the Treaty of Turkmanchai had freed Iran of her preoccupation with
Transcaucasia, the Shah could turn to other parts of the Empire where insurgent
khans were still in control. A.bbas Mirza, now of necessity a friend of the
Russians, proceeded to Khurasan, where according to the Imperial Farman, he
was to eliminate rebels and enemies. He took Amirabad, Turshiz, Quchan,
Turbat, Sarakhs, and prepared to attack Herat. Russia was happy to see Iran find
compensation in the east for territories lost in the north and encouraged Abbas
Mirza to dream of the conquest of Herat, Qandahar, and Kabul, promising him
every kind ofhelp.72
The Russian minister in Tehran, Count Ivan Simonich, was a Dalmatian who
had served in Napoleon's army; he was captured by the Russians and stayedto
serve them first as a soldier and later as a diplomat. Inspite ofthe changeof
allegiance, Simonich remained an ardent Bonapartist and ahater of Britain. His
energetic activity in Tehran alarmed the British who began to feel that the
Persian government's interest in Afghanistan was part ofa sinister plot.
The open rapprochement between Persia and Russia became a fact that would not let the London cabinet sleep at night. The most ordinary steps appeared toit as craftiness
directed tothat which it feared most - the conquest ofIndia.73
When Abbas Mirza died in 1833, hisson> Muhammad Mirza, was pro
claimed heir, ascending thethrone in 1834 as Muhammad Shah. Russian
influence increased further as Muhammad Shah pushed forward his late father's
designs on Herat. Count Simonich enthusiastically promoted a plan for an
alliance ofTehran, Qandahar, and Kabul under Russia's patronage. Acertain

dominance over Afghanistan. Russia, though willing to promote Iran's east
ward expansion, was not prepared to risk an all out confrontation with Britain in
Asia.
The next two decades ofRusso-Persian relations were fairly tranquil. Even
the Crimean War did not have much effect. For a moment Nasir al-DIn Shah
toyed with theidea of joining Russia against Turkey, andreceiving from a
grateful Tsar afew slices of Turkish territory. However, Mirza Agha Khan Nuri
dissuaded the Shah from such a course. Next Nasir al-DIn tried to enter an
alliance with theBritish against Russia butreceived noencouragement from
London.75
Defeat in the Crimea propelled Russia into Central Asia. Directed by General
Dmitri Alekseevich Miliutin, Russian armies in anumber of effective campaigns
destroyed theforces of Khiva, Bukhara, andQuqand (Kokand) and, in one
generation, built agreat empire inthe heart of the continent. Inher drive south
Russia crossed an imaginary line somewhere to the north of the Turkmen
village ofQizil-Su that Persia considered tobe her frontier. To Persian protests
about this new intrusion Russia replied that the Iranian border ran alongthe
Atrak river and that Iran had never exercised any authority over the Tiirkmens.
The Russian minister in Tehran, A.F. Beger, formally notified the Persian
government on25 December 1869 "that the Imperial Government recognizes
Persian dominion up to theAtrak".76 The issue was closed.
Russian advances in Central Asia kept theBritish in a state of perpetual
discomfort punctuated by occasional panics. Against its will Iran was drawn
into the great imperial game. However, her forces had diminished to suchan
extent, her position had sunk solow inrelation tothe great powers that sheno
longer had apolicy beyond her frontiers. All that her diplomats could do wasto
keep a precarious balance amidst the tensions produced by Anglo-Russian
rivalry. No British promises of support could induce theimpotent Persian
government totake astrong stand against the Russians as they moved eastward
through the Akhal oasis toward Sarakhs and Marv. When the Russian advance
finally halted, it was only because British power barred theway.
Within Iran Anglo-Russian rivalry took the form of struggles over economic
concessions, each side trying togain anadvantage over the other. The stupen
dous concession granted in 1872 toBaron Julius de Reuter, anEnglish subject,
evoked aviolent reaction in Saint Petersburg, leading tothe cancellation ofthe
Reuter concession and to the acquisition of a concession by Baron von
75 Tajbakhsh, pp. 140-4. 76 A. U'iasov, pp. 31-2.

Falkenhagen, a Russian subject. The Falkenhagen concession, like the Reuter
concession, was eventually cancelled. Thus great-power jealousies kept Iran
alive and simultaneously prevented all commercial and industrial development.
Reuter, Falkenhagen, some enterprising Frenchmen, groups of Russian busi
nessmen, all tried at one time or another to build railways, dams, or factories. All
invariably failed. Businesses that succeeded, such as the Imperial Bank ofPersia
or the Loan and Discount Bank of Persia, were enterprises either directly
sponsored or strongly supported bythe British and the Russian governments
respectively for political reasons.77
Some of the concessions were incredibly costly to Iran. A Major Gerald
Talbot was granted amonopoly tobuy, sell and manufacture tobacco through
out Iran. Iranian merchants and the culama organized a movement against this
foreign monopoly and received strong Russian support. The movement soon
assumed an anti-Shah character and was, indeed, the precursor ofthe Constitu
tional Movement of 1906. Nasir al-DIn Shah attempted to resist but the
opposition was too great. The Talbot concession was cancelled, leaving Iran
with a debt of £500,000. Since there was nomoney with which to pay it, the
Persian government had to increase itsborrowing. When they had exhausted
their credit with theBritish, theRussians provided loans.
In 1898 Russian activity in Iran increased sharply. Russian businessmen
negotiated for mining concessions in Qarajadagh. The Russian government
obtained a concession tobuild a lighthouse at Anzall. Inspired byS.Iu. Witte,
the energetic minister of finance, the Russian government began a large-scale
political and economic offensive that gradually gave Russia almost complete
control of Nasir al-DIn Shah's successor, Muzaffar al-Din. The British fought
back, scoring occasional successes. They supported anoil concession obtained
in southern Persia by their subject, William Knox D'Arcy. They also prevented
Witte from building a Russian pipeline from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf.
Nevertheless, in thecentury-old struggle Britain was rapidly losing ground.
To reverse this trend andrecover herposition Britain needed allies.Her
treaty with Japan (1902) provided a distant butpowerful instrument against
Russia. InFebruary 1904Japan struck. After much heavy fighting on land and a
naval disaster Russia lost the war in the far East but not her determination to
maintain her position in Iran. Even a domestic revolution and financial insol
vency could notprevent the government of Nicholas II from granting more
loans to his client, Muzaffar al-Din Shah; opening consulates in two towns on
the Persian Gulf; promoting the purchase of land by Russian citizens in

Khurasan and Gllan; advancing £100,000 to Muhammad CA1IMIrza, heir to the
throne, and engaging in other such activities.78
In 1906arevolution broke out in Tehran. The movement had for its goal the
establishment ofa constitutional government, but in essence it was directed
against Russia. The weak Shah capitulated, signed a constitution (7 January
1907) and died a week later. His successor, Muhammad cAli Shah, was a Russian
puppet and a determined upholder of autocracy. Only the Persian Cossack
Brigade, a force officered by the Russians, kept him onthe throne.
European politics, Britain's fear of the growing power of Germany, and
Russia's need to recover from war and revolution brought the rival powers to an
agreement that marked the end of Persian independence. The Iranian govern
ment had not even been informed ofthe negotiations that produced a treaty
which divided Iran into spheres ofinfluence, while it paid lip service toher
territorial integrity. During the subsequent ten years Russia acted as if Iran were
another conquered province. Russian troops occupied Khurasan, AzarbaTjan,
and Gllan. Russian consulates became governing bodies and the consuls some
times collected local taxes. The Constitutional Movement was severely
limited, if not destroyed, when Morgan Shuster, an American financial advisor,
was forced to leave Iran by Russian diplomatic and military pressure(27
December 1911).
The outbreak of World War I temporarily strengthened the hold ofRussia
and Britain on Persia. InMarch 1915 inreturn for British acquiescence in the
Russian annexation of Constantinople, the Tsar agreed that Britain should take
over theso called neutral zone in central Iran. However, this potentially
significant development proved ephemeral. Under the blows ofthe German
army the Tsarist regime collapsed. The Provisional Government that succeeded
Nicholas IItried its best to continue his foreign policies, but ittoo fell, giving
way tothe Soviet regime led by V.I. Lenin.
Three weeks after assuming power, the Soviet government published an
appeal to the Muslims of Russia and the East. Couched in highly inflammatory
language, itaddressed those whose faith and customs had been trampled upon,
whose mosques and houses of worship were destroyed by the Tsars and Russian
oppressors. The appeal stated among other things that the treaty partitioning
Persia was null and void, that troops would be withdrawn from Iran and the
Persians would beaccorded the right "freely to determine their fate".79 In
January and February 1918 diplomatic contacts were made between Soviet

advantage ofthe opportunity, for inthe summer of 1919 the British, moving
into the power vacuum left by the collapse of Russia, attempted to impose upon
Persia a virtual protectorate bymeans ofa proposed Anglo-Persian Treaty.81
Gaining the cooperation ofa few high officials, whom they bribed with large
sums ofmoney, the British brought token forces tothe north, provoking the
population of Gilan into guerrilla action known as the Jangatimovement.82 In an
address tothe workers and peasants ofPersia, Foreign Commissar Chicherin
proclaimed:
At the moment when the triumphant victor, the English beast of prey, is trying to puta noose of final enslavement around the neck of the Persian people, the Soviet government of the workers and peasants of the Russian Republic solemnly declares that itdoes not recognize the Anglo-Persian treaty bringing about this enslavement . . . The Soviet government of Russia regards as a piece of paper to which it will never accord legal force, the shameful Anglo-Persian treaty through which your rulers have sold themselves and have sold you tothe English predator.83
The civil war that raged in Russia in 1919—20 made further contacts between
the Soviets and Iran difficult ifnot impossible. However, inthe spring of 1920
the Soviet n t hArmy put an end to the brief existence of the independent
republic of (Russian) Azerbaijan and occupied Baku. On 18 May Soviet troops
landed at Anzali. Though the original motive of the invasion was the recovery of
some ships taken to Anzali by retreating Russian counter-revolutionary forces,
once the Soviet army was there, itwould not withdraw in spite of pleas from the
commissariat offoreign affairs, which was anxious to normalize relations not
only with Iran but with Britain as well.84
The presence of Soviet troops in Gilan encouraged the Jangali movement to
extend itsactivities and become a serious threat. In Tehran the government
began to fear an attack on the capital. Firuz Mirza Nusrat al-Daula, minister of
foreign affairs, asked Lord Derby, the British Ambassador in Paris, what course
of action to pursue. The British had nothing to contribute. They had debated the
Persian issue within the highest government circles and come to the conclusion
that there was noforce they could spare to repel a Bolshevik occupation of
northern Iran. The Persians had nochoice but to deal directly with Soviet
Russia.
Again, as often in the past, necessity dictated policy. Firuz Mirza entered into
negotiations with Chicherin. In anote dispatched on 12 June 1920, he stated that
to win theconfidence of the Iranian people and government, Russia must

withdraw her troops from Iran, promise never to commit any aggression against
Persian territory, abstain from conducting propaganda among and giving
support "to the elements of disorder inPersia", and make restitutions for the
property taken by troops or representatives of the Soviet government.85 On 20
June 1920, Chicherin replied that this and other messages that FIruz Mirza had
sent him were full oferroneous information, and that there were no Soviet
troops anywhere in Iran.
The guilt for the movement of the Persian population against the central Government cannot be imparted to us. In general [and here Chicherin instinctively assumed atone reminiscent of a Tsitsianov or Ermolov] all statements you make against our Govern
ment are based on erroneous data that absolutely do not correspond toreality.86
The Persians repeatedly asked theBritish for diplomatic, military,and
financial support in dealing with the Soviets. None was given. Lord Curzon
could not persuade the War Office tospare one ortwo divisions for Iran; yet,
blinded by obsolete notions, he pushed with what appeared an insane insistence
for the ratification of the Anglo-Persian treaty of 1919. By late summer 1920 that
treaty was, of course, a dead issue, whereas theRussian troops in Gilan,
Chicherin to the contrary notwithstanding, were very much alive. InJuly and
August British troops evacuated Manjil. There was nolonger a doubt that
Tehran itself would soon be open toany force that chose to move infrom the
north.
The Persian government offered Moscow recognition and the establishment
of diplomatic relations. CA1I Qull Khan Ansari, Mushavir al-Mamalik, then
ambassador in Constantinople, was sent to Russia where he had served before
the Revolution. The negotiations between Mushavir al-Mamalik and Chicherin
took many months. The Iranian side pressed for the evacuation of Soviet troops
from Gilan, troops that Chicherin first claimed were not there and which later
were labelled Azarbaijani detachments, thus presumably freeing Russia of
responsibility for their movements or actions.
The Soviet government was facing adifficult choice. Persian radicals, joined
by a number ofBaku Bolsheviks, had taken over Kuchik Khan's xenophobic
movement in Gilan. Under the leadership of the idealistic extremist, Ihsan-Allah
Khan, they proclaimed aSoviet republic of Gilan which was instantly endorsed
by Trotsky. The new regime proceeded to conduct reforms that had no basis in
economic and social conditions of the area. Italso launched an offensive across
the mountains inthe direction ofTehran. The offensive failed, but its threat

stiffened the British position in the quiet negotiations that were being conducted
by the Soviet government with their chief enemy. Lenin realized that the Soviet
regime was nearing economic collapse and desperately needed trade with the
West. The British would nottrade unless theSoviets gave up revolutionary
activity in Asia and, first of all, withdrew from Iran. Thus the British and the
Iranian positions coincided and Lenin had to choose between continued support
of the Soviet Republic ofGilan and normalization ofrelations with Britain and
Persia. Hechose the latter.
On 16 February 1921, inMoscow G.V. Chicherin and Mushavir al-Mamalik
signed a treaty oftwenty-six articles. The Soviet government, Article 2 stated,
"unequivocally rejects this criminal policy [of Tsarist Russia], which not only
violated the sovereignty of the states ofAsia, but also led toorganized profound
violence of European predators against theliving body of the peoples of the
East". Thetreaty reaffirmed the permanence of Russo-Iranian frontiers, re
nounced interference in one another's domestic affairs, and pledged not to
permit the formation of groups on the territory of one state that would engagein
activity directed against the other, nor to permit the presence on their territories
of armed forces of some third state. Tsarist loans to Persia were cancelled and
Russia gave up allrailways, highways, port facilities at Anzali, and barges on
lake Urmiya. Article 11 explicitly cancelled the Treaty of Turkmanchai. Persia
on her part promised not to transfer to a third power or itscitizens any of the
concessions formerly held by Russia. The regime of capitulations was abolished.
This treaty, so favourable to Iran, contained one sinister clause, Article 6
which stated that:
[. . .] if there should occur attempts onthe part ofthird powers toconduct via armed intervention on the territory ofPersia apolicy ofconquest, ortoturn Persian territory into a base for armed action against Russia, ifthere arise therefore a danger to the borders of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic or powers allied with it, and if the Persian government, after being warned by the Russian Soviet Government, should be powerless toturn aside such a danger, the Russian Soviet Government will have the right to introduce its troops on to the territory of Persia in order to take the necessary measures in the interest of self-defence.87
In spite of an exchange of letters which specified that Article 6 referred to
Russian White groups, anumber ofwhich were still operating onthe fringes of
the Soviet territory, the Russian government in later years chose to interpret itas
a right to unlimited military intervention. The article was so used in 1941.

detachments of the Persian Cossack Brigade, the only effective force that had
survived years of turmoil and anarchy inIran, marched on Tehran atthe orders
of their commander, Colonel Riza Khan. Acoup d'etat installed anew cabinetin
which Riza Khan as minister of war had a dominant position. The new
government did not repudiate the treaty of26 February. However, it succeeded
in hastening the departure ofBritish troops from southern Persia, thus depriv
ing theSoviets of a pretext for staying in Gilan.
Soviet leadership was divided on theGilan issue. In Baku firebrands de
manded a further extension ofrevolutionary struggle. G.K. Orjonikidze went
so far as to disobey Moscow's orders for withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Anzall. Lenin sided with Chicherin and F.A. Rothstein, the newly appointed
ambassador to Tehran, both of whom had nothing but contempt for Kuchik
Khan and his movement, which was rent by murderous dissensions. Since Persia
procrastinated and postponed ratification on onepretext or another in the
expectation of the Russian evacuation of Gilan, Moscow atlast compelled Baku
to carry outits orders.
The Persian consul in Baku, Muhammad Khan Sacid al-Vizara, acknowl
edged to the Soviet authorities of Azarbaijan that with the exception of some 15 o
persons who were apparently awaiting transport, Soviet troops had evacuated
Persia, andadded that thelegitimate Persian authorities would immediately
enter areas evacuated by the Soviets "in complete certainty that not one soldier
of Soviet republics friendly toPersia would stand inthe way ofthe advanceof
government garrisons . . ."88 Sacid's apprehensions were groundless. The last
Soviet troops left the country before the end of the year, and for the first timein
more than a decade no foreign soldiers stood on Iran's soil.
In the decades that followed, the course of Russo-Iranian relations was never
smooth. Iran was subject to unrelenting pressure in all its dealings with its
northern neighbour. Minor border disputes frequently assumed the propor
tions ofmajor issues. Economic relations were often difficult and painful as the
Iranian government tried to protect the interests ofhundreds ofsmall traders
who found themselves at the mercy of a huge government monopoly. The
Soviet spy and subversion apparatus under a variety of initials (G.P.U.,
N.K.V.D., etc.) rana large and active network in Iran. Persian Communists
found a refuge and a base of operations in theSoviet Union.
However, Russia was no longer occupying the same position vis-a-vis Iranas
she did before 1917. Within Iran itself there emerged acentralized government,

a national army, and a national spirit which made old style imperialism less
effective. The world balance ofpower, and the insecurity felt bythe Soviet
Union itself, made it follow a cautious policy that excluded risk-taking and
adventure. Anglo-Soviet hostility made impossible, at least until 1941, another
division of Iran into spheres of influence. Conversely, the same hostility
provided Iran with insurance against excessive pressure from Great Britain. The
policy of balancing the two great powers that had broken down after 1905 was
effective once more and would serve Iran well until the collapse of British power
in the aftermath ofWorld War II.

CHAPTER IO
IRANIAN RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN
TRADING COMPANIES, TO 1798
"A barbarous nation, called Afghans . . . rushed like a torrent into Persia, and
took Ispahan, after aviolent siege." This was the way inwhich Sir William Jones
described the ascendancy which the Ghilzai Afghan leader, Mahmud Shah,
achieved in Iran in 1722.1 The Afghan occupation lasted for eight years and
precipitated the end of Safavid rule. Notuntil theestablishment ofthe Qajars by
Agha Muhammad Khan in 1794 didIran know another period ofrelative overall
stability.2
In 1722 the East India Company represented theprincipal British interest in
Iran. The Company had begun trading in the Persian Gulf in 1616when the
James was sent from Surat to Jask with seven factors bound for Iran. By the
summer of 1617 they had taken up residence in Shiraz and the Safavid capital,
Isfahan. The expulsion of the Portuguese in 1622from Hurmuz left Bandar
Abbas (Gombroon) theformer's replacement as theGulf's major trading port
while, from 1623 till 1765, theDutch East India Company became Britain's chief
commercial rival in Iran.3 In the late 17th andearly 18th centuries British trade
prospered. British factors reached thewestern coast of the Caspian "where they

sold great quantities of the woollen manufactures of Great Britain", and British
and Dutch traders inIsfahan braved the Afghan invasion in 1722.4 The French,
with consular representation there, made better terms than their rivals, although
the terms involved religious orders more than trade.5 The French East India
Company was established byColbert in 1664, but, toa greater extent than the
Dutch orBritish companies, it was seen, inthe context ofIndia, asa meansof
French national expansion and rivalry with Britain. Thus the decline from 1761
of the French political position in India hastened the Company's abolition in
1769. The French company had also been adversely affected by John Law's
schemes, and by its neglect of the country trade.
Initially, Mahmud Shah theAfghan's overtures to foreigners resident in
Isfahan seemed promising, but he later seized the British and Dutch companies'
assets. Meanwhile, trading prospects worsened with invasions by the Ottoman
Turks and the Russians, and revolts within Iran. Inthe north a Safavid prince
had, with support of some chieftains ofthe Qajar tribe, established himself as
Tahmasp II. In 1727 he was joined by Tahmasp Quli Khan (later Nadir Shah),
who rapidly extended his own authority over much ofthe country. Two years
later the Afghans were crushed. In 1732 Tahmasp II was deposed infavour of
another Safavid, the infant, cAbbas III, butwith the coronation of Tahmasp
Quli Khan as Nadir Shah in 1736 pretence of Safavid rule was abandoned.
Nadir Shah first encountered European merchants in 1729 when he wrested
Isfahan from the Afghans. During his six-week stay in the capital he seemed well
disposed towards the foreigners buthopes soon faded. Indeed, the spread of
violence and disorder in all directions led the Bombay authorities to believe that
the British factory at Isfahan should beclosed, and asa result of increasingly
unfavourable trading conditions and the growing prominence ofMashhad, the
Isfahan establishment wasleft in the hands of the "linguist" (interpreter),

RELATIONS WITH EUROPEAN COMPANIES
although in 1742 the activities of a British venture innorthern Iran, incompeti
tion with the East India Company, briefly revitalized the Isfahan agency.6
It had occurred to Captain John Elton, an Englishman employed by the
Russian government onthe Orenburg frontier, that trade between Britain and
Iran might be routed through Russia. The Russia (or Muscovy) Company had
already been established by charter from Queen Mary in 1555, though not until
1734 had a treaty of commerce been concluded between Russia and Britain.
Thus the mechanisms fortrade already existed. In 1739 Elton travelled to Iran
where hewas impressed with the trading prospects. He wrote about them so
persuasively that an Act of Parliament providing for the Caspian commerce was
passed in 1741, enabling the Russia Company totake up the venture. Its British
representatives were soon inIran, where a factory was set up atMashhad. This
enterprise, for a time, caused consternation both to the East India and the
Levant Company.7
Elton not only engaged inthis trade. He also agreed to"build ships after the
European manner, with aview tonavigate the Caspian Sea" on behalf ofNadir
Shah. InApril 1744, the Shah's health was drunk on completion of the stem and
stern of the first ship — "intended tomount twenty cannons, which isofgreater
force than the Russians ever navigated onthe Caspian". The building of this
ship, and the prospect ofmore tofollow, aroused Russian hostility. By a decree
of 1746 Empress Elizabeth forbade the Caspian trade through Russia in British
cloth and manufactured goods, sent in exchange for raw silk. In 1751 Elton, the
last remaining British merchant in northern Iran, was killed in Gilan in the chaos
following Nadir Shah's death in 1747. The British factors in Isfahan did not
escape the general deterioration ofconditions, and were sobadly handled that
one died. The factory was closed in 1750.8
Nor, with factories atBandar cAbbas, Basra, Shiraz, and Lar, were the Dutch
exempt from worry; but the French, whose effort in 1740 to resume a position
trading inthe Gulf region failed, were no longer involved onland. Dutch and
British prospects were damaged between 1737 and 1744 by Nadir Shah's Omani
expeditions, the crippling taxation andrequisition of shipping which these
entailed adversely affecting trade. The principal legacy of Nadir's campaigns

against Oman was the future rise of the family of Bii Sacid as rulers of Oman and
Zanzibar.
Construction was one of the ways inwhich ships for Nadir's naval enterprise
in the south, parallel tothat on the Caspian, were furnished. His Admiral ofthe
Gulf, Latif Khan, appointed in 1734, was empowered by this sovereign to obtain
vessels from the British and Dutch atGombroon and did so from this post, also
from Surat, both by purchase and byrequisition. Conditions were sufficiently
adverse fortraders acting forthe British representatives to note that shipping
was a sure way togain Nadir Shah's goodwill and therefore not tobe neglected
while he was busy building up his "Naval Affairs" toapitch which, though the
attempt collapsed with his assassination in 1747, ensured Nadir's place in history
as one who attempted to project Iran as a maritime power.9
In Nadir Shah's later years the trading outlook became so discouraging that
the East India Company considered quitting the area altogether. Nadir Shah's
excesses after he hadblinded hisoldest sonin 1742 reduced thecountry to
confusion anddesperation. A report from Basra stated that the"variety of
Troubles that have lately happened inthese parts has occasioned an entire Stop
to Trade".10 The following year conditions and had worsened: "there isa great
appearance of everything going to confusion in the Kingdom of Persia".11
Nadir Shah had so "long and grievously oppressed" those he ruled that Thomas
Grendon (the Resident at Basra) conveyed the opinion that the "Generality of
Mankind inthese Parts are inclined to believe hecannot hold out long".12He
was assassinated in June 1747 and political disintegration swiftly followed.
In the north, the Qajar khans controlled much ofGurgan, Mazandaran and,
eventually, Gilan. As affairs settled down, the province of Khurasan was
virtually separated from the rest of the country andpassed under Afghan
domination, with therise of the powerful Durrani monarchy under Ahmad
Shah. Already master of Sistan and Qandahar, Ahmad Shah conquered Herat
and followed this bythe successful siege of Mashhad in 1751. Tohim Nadir
Shah's blinded grandson, Shah Rukh, owed such authority ashe exercised for
many years in and around Mashhad.
In the south another Safavid descendant, Ismacil III, was installed in 1750 by
the combined support of the chiefs of the Bakhtiyarl and Zand tribes, but he was
never more than a puppet. After long exertions Karim Khan Zand gained

control and consolidated his position as aparamount ruler centred upon Shiraz,
to survive until 1779.Malcolm was to write of "the happy reign of this excellent
Prince",13 butBritish observers frequently commented on hisonerous tax
exactions, especially in the years when he was struggling to establish himself. In
1761 they reported:
Carem Caun had ordered twenty thousand Tomaunds to be taken from Carmenia topay the Military, five thousand for himself, and five thousand for his Choppars: That when the distribution came to be made, it wasfound to be seven times more than the usual Tax; That the Kingdom seemed to go very fast unto Ruin the Great Men paying no regard to the Subject, but only to the gratifying their Soldiers and Dependents.14
Francklin observed that Karim Khan "encouraged and protected trade with
his utmost favour".15 He did this not only to revive the country but also to enlist
European co-operation inthe Gulf, yet the European trading powers did not
thereafter begin toenjoy a new era ofharmonious prosperity. In 1752 Francis
Wood described Karim Khan as "little better than Governour ofSpahaun, as
the Country remains inthe same distracted Condition now as, it has done for
many Years past, every City with the Adjacent Villages, being as it were a
distinct Principality at Variance with the next".16 Such were the widespread civil
disturbances and the multiplicity of his rivals that Karim Khan did not extend
his control to the Gulf coast until the 1760s. By the time he did, Iran was facing a
serious specie drain which necessitated restrictive measures. Both the British
and the Dutch became preoccupied with the more pressing matters of global
rivalry with the French, the Seven Years War (1756-63), and the acute financial
troubles ofthe trading companies themselves.
After 1747the Dutch displayed great energy in the Gulf, especially when they
established themselves onKharg island in 1753 under the direction of Baron
Kniphausen. These impressive activities, although alarming to theBritish,
brought the Dutch no lasting benefit nor much immediate commercial success.
When they were driven from Kharg in 1765 by Mir Muhanna Zacabl, shaikh of
Bandar Rig, forty miles north of Bushire along the coast, their whole position in
the Gulf collapsed and was not revived. Meanwhile, by 1763 the East India
Company emerged with effective control over Bengal and the foundations for
the British territorial empire in India had been laid.

While confusion prevailed in Iran during the middle decades of the 18th
century, the British in India had been fully occupied with the French. In the
Persian Gulf region the instability was such that the agent at Bandar cAbbas
recommended moving to one of the islands. In the late summer of 1750 Danvers
Graves summarized the bleak outlook inPersia ina letter to Bombay which
pictured thechaos following Nadir Shah's death andbefore Karlm Khan gained
a measure of ascendancy.
This Kingdom is so far from being settled under any regular Government that itis now almost fallen beyond hopes of Recovery. Spahaun and the adjacent Villages are in the Hands of the Lhores under Careem Caun, the Province of Ghuloon has submitted to a wild Tribe of People called Cajarrs. Muscat, to the Chords, the Chorasson Countries are divided between the Chords, Ophgoons, and Persians, the Chorasson Governours of Yezd andCarmenia have set up separately for themselves, Shyrash remains in Possession of the Lhores who plundered Spahaun, and the Countries extending from the City of Shyrash to Lhor, while Nasser Caun remained there with hisForces were under Subjection to him, but since hisarrival here most of the Villages & People have revolted, so that the whole isdivided as it were into different Principalities independent of one another, without the least Prospect of their ever being united.17
The agent at Gombroon wasattracted to Bahrain, where the fort was reputed
to be in good repair, but availability of good water was aproblem. So were the
Huwala Arabs. He had also suggested that what remained of the Iranian navy
(four ships in the vicinity) beseized. These suggestions found nofavour at
Bombay, but settlement on one of the islands was authorized "till the Troubles
in the Kingdom of Persia are subsided".18 Anew agent carried out surveys in
1752, and suggested that Qishm island suited the Company's needs. The project
was dropped when Henry Savage, who had proposed transferring to Bahrain,
died in 1751, and his successor, Danvers Graves, who preferred Qishm, died in
September 1752.19 Death was indeed "familiar inthose parts caused by ill aire
staying so long in it in Gombroon".20 Francis Wood as agent then conducted his

own investigations. Heconcluded that no advantage would be gained by
moving to an island. It would forfeit thefriendship of the Iranians, might lead to
war with them, and it was upon their goodwill that "the sale ofour Woollen
Goods entirely depends".21
Despite persistent "shocks andconvulsions" theEast India Company traders
somehow carried onin Iran during the Afghan occupation, throughout the
oppressions of Nadir Shah, andduring thedisorders following hisdeath. In fact,
in the 1750s a lively and substantial trade was carried on in spite of the
breakdown of the authority of the central government and increased instability
in the Gulf caused by Arab pirates and tribal rivalries.22 Silk, once akey item in
East India Company trade with Iran, had for anumber of reasons — restrictive
legislation byBritain, the availability of supplies elsewhere, and vicissitudes
within Persia — lost its pre-eminence. Aconsistently sought-after commodity,
however, was "Carmanian wool", used for making hats and shawls inBritain.
This wool, from Kirman province, came from goats and was available in
different colours — black, white, and red. The red had long been highly prized.
Instructions written asearly as 1684 required double the quantity of former
years to besent ofthis "most stable Commodity".23
Arrangements for obtaining Kirman wool form an appreciable part of the
Company's Gombroon diary. InFebruary 1727an entry dealing largely with
Dutch rivalry in Kirman recorded the view that cash "can be returned to
Bombay no ways so advantageously as in Wooll".24 In April an entry stated that
one ofthe objectives at the Gombroon factory was "to give asmuch life as
possible tothe Investment ofWool atCarmania".25 InMay it was noted that
while goats had been plentiful, "theOphgoons had been there and drove many
of them away which with Entirely plundering those parts, had made wool very
scarce".26 Still, asubstantial sumwent to purchase wool, despite its extravagant
price. Though of primary significance, Kirman wool wasonly oneitem of trade.
An entry for July recorded the arrival from Shlraz of 280 chests of wine and 100
chests ofrosewater.27 Old copper was also in regular demand.
In June 1729William Cordeux was instructed on his arrival inKirman "to

as much red wool as possible but not white".28 Since the merchants would not
sell red wool alone he had tocontract for mixed wool. In 1736 a shortageof
Kirman wool was caused by the requirements ofNadir Shah's military cloth
iers.29 By 1747the agent in Gombroon doubted whether the amount of Kirman
wool specified could be procured because, this time, Nadir Shah's oppressions
had forced the people "to sell their goats in the market to raise money for their
tax & the village circumjacent had been plundered & their goats destroyed".30
Edward Ives, who visited Gombroon in 175 8, described it as a "place of no kind
of consequence except what itreceived from the English and Dutch factories".
He observed that "constant wars and their attendent confusion and anarchy
deprived England ofalmost all their commercial advantages, and the place of
almost all its inhabitants". Nevertheless, it was to this place that the Company
sent fine quality woollen cloth and some lead inreturn for Kirman wool and
copper.31
Under itsCharters the East India Company undertook to export British
goods. This meant mostly woollen textiles which, according tothe Venetian
ambassador in 1610, formed the chief wealth of Britain. Interest in Iranian
markets was stirred in 1614 when Richard Steel reported that the East India
Company might be assured "of the vent of much cloth, in regard their country is
much cold and men, women and children are clothed therewith some five
months in the year".32 Both at Bombay and in the Persian Gulf, representatives
of the Company received frequent reminders of the high priority attached to the
sale of their annual consignments of British woollens. As itwas put in instruc
tions to Francis Wood, "Your utmost abilities and attention must on all
occasions be exerted to promote the consumption of British Woolen Manufac
ture at Bunderrieck [Bandar Rig], which is the Chief reason of your being
employed there."33 John Home had years earlier written from Gombroon ofhis
hopes that the kingdom would settle so that the consumption of woollen goods
would greatly increase. "It shall be my duty", he wrote, "to Improve the Vend

of that commodity to the utmost as well as to Encrease theWool Investment, for
I am very sensible how advantageous these two Branches are tomy Hon'ble
Employers."34
To avoid total loss, inthe 18th century quantities of cloth went toIran but
there keen demand wasincreasingly combined with inability to pay. The quality
of the goods was high. Care was taken to ascertain and meet Iranian needs and
taste. According to one setof statistics, in 1753 of 2,700 bales of woollen
manufactured goods for the India and China trade, some 600went to the Persian
Gulf; mainly to Iran. Other figures for later years confirm this trend: e.g. 1,060
out of 1,234for 1756; and 1,089out of 3,65 7in I759-35 Writing in March 1758 the
Court of Directors told the agent at Bandar Abbas of a sizable consignment of
woollen goods being sent "for the Persia Market". Colours in avariety "usually
sent for the Turkey Market" were mentioned, but the agent was enjoined to be
"very particular in finding out those that are best liked as well as those that are
disliked" in Iran. He wasalso urged to attempt purchasing Kirman wool of"the
Red Sort" without the black and white, on which, "owing tothe high price it
was purchased at", loss had been incurred.36
After three poor years in 1761—3 the Persian Gulf trade once more improved
as shown by the sale of 1,581 out of 5,653 bales in 1764;but the sharp decline
witnessed in 1768 became continuous. In 1783—4, only 145 bales were sold at
Basra and none at Bushire. The total net loss on sales of woollens at Basra in the
decade 1780—1 to 1789—90 was £11,305; atBushire itwas £1,232.37 Sir Harford
Jones recalled that in histime at Basra theaverage loss had amounted to about 16
per cent "altho' these Sales were managed by Persons of the strictist Integrity &
great Ability, Messrs. Latouche & Manesty".38
The vigour ofthe Persian Gulf trade inthe 1750s calls for explanation and
several have been offered. First, the dispersal ofNadir Shah's immense booty
from India contributed inthe short term toincreased prosperity. It has been
asserted that long before the century ended India had recovered by trade the
riches Nadir Shah had taken by conquest. William Milburn described the trade
between Iran and India as "very considerable", but he noted that most of Iran's
products were not suited tothe Indian market. Asteady drain on Iran in gold

while not of prime importance to the East India Company, "contributed largely
to the income ofthe Western Presidency [i.e. Bombay]".41
In 1754 the decision was taken toestablish a factory at Bandar Rig.42 This
reflected the need to find aplace less exposed to piratical Arabs and raiding tribal
chiefs. Italso seemed necessary to move nearer to the head of the Gulf to meet
the competition from theLevant Company, theDutch on Kharg, and the
French, who were beginning to make headway in the woollen market. The local
ruler atBandar Rig encouraged Europeans. Through the resident at Basrahe
invited the British to build a factory. The Court of Directors approved this
enterprise and entrusted itsexecution to the former agent at Bandar cAbbas,
Francis Wood. In 1755 he received an appropriate raqam (decree) from Karim
Khan and began construction. Upon hearing disquieting news from the Dutch,
Wood left Bandar Rig without warning the local authorities of possible trouble.
Mir Muhanna brought about a murderous revolution in 1756 and usedthe
Company's buildings as materials for a city wall. Wood, authorized toretaliate
and rebuild, wasgiven the useof Company vessels for this purpose. Since Wood
refused to actbecause heconsidered the forces inadequate, the Bandar Rig
undertaking collapsed.43
Because of disturbances around Bandar cAbbas and simultaneous disruptions
which suspended trade around Kirman, the British company searched for a
more suitable place inthe Persian Gulf. The French had delivered a crushing
blow by capturing the Gombroon agency in 1759, but some of the damage done
by fire and plunder occurred after the French had departed. In1760 aletter from
Gombroon reported
That the interior parts of Persia were still in the utmost confusion and Carem Caun who had been endeavoring to bring the empire under his subjection met with somany
powerful competitors that he really believed he would not succeed.44
This soon changed: by 1762 Karim Khan's rivals were inthe "utmost aweand
subjection, so that he is really possessed of the Sovereign power", though hehad
not assumed the royal title.45

In 1762 the London Directors gave instructions that the old factory at Bandar
Abbas bewithdrawn and a new one established elsewhere. Consequently, in
1763 a factory was founded at Basra. Bandar Abbas (Gombroon), one of the
earliest British factories in the Persian Gulf, was closed. Until the plague in 177 3,
Basra became the pivot of the British position in the Gulf. It had drawbacks.
Both Turks and Iranians vied for authority over it, as did others, including the
Kacb and the Muntafiq Arabs.
In the course ofinvestigations made in 1761, Alexander Douglas had been
favourably impressed byBushire. It had a thriving merchant community and
roads into the interior, being only fourteen days' journey from Shiraz and thirty
from Isfahan. Shaikh Nasir invited the company tosettle there, and, as directed
from London and Bombay, the agent atBasra, William Price, negotiated terms
with the shaikh for a factory. He instructed Benjamin Jervis, Resident at
Bushire, "more particularly to introduce the vend ofWoollen Goods into the
Kingdom ofPersia." Price concluded: "the Country from this place to Ispahan

being entirely under the Command of Carem Caun whom itis generally allowed
governs with great justice and moderation gives us good hopes of success."46 In
July 1763,Karlm Khan gave the Company47 amonopoly over the woollen trade
in all Iranian ports, exclusive rights to build a factory at Bushire, andother
advantageous commercial terms, such as exemptions from duties. In return,
Karlm Khan secured that Iranian merchandise would be accepted in payment, or
part payment, for British goods inorder toreduce the export ofspecie. He also
hoped for British assistance inconsolidating his rule inthe south, and offered to
pay for British help in subjugating Mir Muhanna at Bandar Rig. In 1764 he
directly requested British aid. The Bombay Government gave a limited autho
rity for a loan of vessels. This Anglo-Iranian undertaking wasbadly co
ordinated andfailed miserably, so that Mir Muhanna's position was further
strengthened.
British involvement with the Banu Kacb (a local Arab tribe inthe area of the
River Karun) complicated relations with Karlm Khan.48 The Banu Kacb had in
earlier years been subject to the Turks and occupied substantial territory
bordering on Iran, for which an annual payment was made to the Ottoman
Pasha atBasra. After Nadir Shah's death the Kacb spread into Iranian territory,
thereby becoming subject to both Turks and Iranians. Turkish authority
declined, disturbances continued in Iran, while theinfluence of local tribes
increased. The Banu Kacb grew independent. Byrefusing to pay any annual
tribute they accumulated wealth. When able, both their suzerains claimed
arrears of revenue. The Turks had been engaged in hostilities with theKacb
since 1761.Karlm Khan moved against them in 1765.To counter these threats,
the Banu Kacb developed their maritime strength. Unable to defeat them
although he had hurt them severely, Karlm Khan made an accommodation and
used them militarily against the Turks, and as alever in his negotiations with the
British.
The Banu Kacb had seized some British vessels just after the attack onMir
Muhanna was abandoned. The Government of Bombay sent several vessels
with detachments of infantry and artillery to Basra to act in concert withthe
Turks against the Banu Kacb. In September 1766 when the British and Turks
were besieging the Banu Kacb, Karlm Khan claimed them asIranian subjects
and insisted that the Turks and British withdraw. The Turks complied, but the

British protested. They asked for and received substantial reinforcements from
Bombay. Land operations were not resumed because ofthe arrival of Karim
Khan's envoy atBasra totreat on his behalf. The British continued their sea
blockade until 1768 when itwas lifted after the death of the forceful Banu Kacb
leader, Shaikh Salman.
The Bombay Presidency saw Karim Khan as the key to trade in Iran. They
wanted the right to build afactory in Iran ata site of their choice, and control
over an island in the Gulf— preferably Kharg — or at the least they wanted to be
sure that no other European power should control it. The Company's agent at
Basra, Henry Moore, who was responsible for conducting these negotiations,
seems thoroughly to have distrusted Iranians, and especially Karim Khan. He
sent one ofhis staff, George Skipp, whom he also disliked, to Shiraz, while
simultaneously he wrote to the Directors in London outlining his objections to
the policy being pursued. With an agent at Basra who was working actively for a
reversal of the policy determined upon in Bombay, and with arepresentative in
Shiraz with little authority, the stage was set for a split between London and
Bombay, aswell asfor unsatisfactory relations with Iran.
The Bombay Presidency, in attempting to reach a diplomatic settlement with
Karim Khan, had agreed reluctantly to join with Iranian forces against Mir
Muhanna, who threatened British trade not only by sea but also by interfering
with the caravan traffic with Shiraz. The Presidency instructions of January
1767 for the guidance ofthe negotiator sent to Shiraz directed him totry to
obtain the following:
1. Confirmation of earlier grants forsettling at Bushire, expressly giving
permission to build there any fort or factory thought proper and to fortify it
as necessary.
2. An annual sum of at least 20,000 to 25,000 rupees to be paid the Company
from the rent of the customs of Bushire, to meet the expense of keeping a
cruiser always inthe Gulf.
3. Grant ofany one ofthe islands inthe Gulf considered most suitable for
settlement if it were required.
4. Compensation for losses out of booty which might be taken from the Banu
Kacb, whose vessels, ifnot destroyed or surrendered, were not again to be
employed against England.
5. Claim on half ofbooty ofwhatsoever nature taken from Mir Muhanna.
6. Inthe event ofa successful joint expedition against Mir Muhanna it was
agreed that Karim Khan might keep Kharg if he undertook not to deliver it
to any European power other than British.

It was further desired topromote the trade inraw silk from Gilan. Apresent to
Karim Khan notexceeding 10,000 rupees was authorized.49
Karim Khan held that, ashis subjects, the Banii Kacb should bethreatened
neither by theBritish northeTurks. Heagreed to see that theBritish were
compensated for their losses. Heoffered to pay for British help against Mir
Muhanna, and togive them Kharg when Mir Muhanna was destroyed. Henry
Moore atBasra recalled his representative at Shlraz and strongly recommended
rejection of these terms. Heproposed that theBritish, cooperating with the
Turks and even with Mir Muhanna, should move against both the Banu Kacb
and Karim Khan. The Bombay Government disagreed, ordered acceptanceof
Karim Khan's proposals, and sent ships for another joint operation against Mir
Muhanna, who was then on Kharg; butin London theCourt of Directors
accepted Moore's arguments. They hadalways foreseen disagreeable conse
quences from a settlement at Bushire. They disapproved of negotiating with
Karim Khan, wanted neither a quarrel with Mir Muhanna, nor a residency under
the protection of such anotorious robber, and recommended that the Gllan silk
enterprise bedropped. They were too late: Skipp was already back in Shlraz
where in 1768 he made an agreement with Karim Khan, and it included
provision for ajoint expedition against Kharg. Moore, who had the local British
forces under hisauthority, ordered theattack before theIranian troopshad
assembled and arrived from Shlraz. The British sustained considerable damage
and casualties so that their commander suspended the attack until the Iranians
arrived. Moore then ordered the ships back to India: when the Iranians
eventually came, theBritish had gone.
In March 1769 a revolution drove Mir Muhanna from Kharg. He sought
refuge in Basra but was there ignominiously put to death by the Ottoman
authorities for hisoutrageous conduct. The representatives of the Company
considered that the Mir ought to have been turned over tohis rightful sover
eign, Karim Khan, butin any event the end of Mir Muhanna was a relief to
merchants in theGulf.
Because of uncertainties about Mir Muhanna and Kharg, the British Resident
at Bushire, James Morley, withdrew in February 1769 to Basra, ending direct
relations with Iran, a move ofwhich Moore atBasra approved. Moore, whose
relations with Bombay had become acrimonious, endeavoured togain a British
footing on Kharg, but retreated when the Governor resisted and claimed Karim
Khan's protection. Moore's proceedings had been thoroughly unacceptable to

Bombay: his handling of the joint military venture with Karim Khan, orders to
Skipp to annul all engagements and leave Shiraz, and finally the withdrawal of
the Bushire Residency. The Bombay Government wTas in favour of again
approaching Karim Khan.
Much discussion regarding the relative merits of Basra and Bushire ensued.50
One committee reported that Bushire was well suited for the wool trade into
Iran, with abranch silk trade with Gilan. Shortage of specie had already forced
Karim Khan to accept part of his revenues in silk, hence itwaspredicted that he
would take two or three lakhs of rupees in woollens annually in return for raw
silk. The committee considered that Iranian merchants would trade with the
British in Bushire in preference to trading with Russian merchants in the
northern provinces, while British traders with Basra faced insecure roadsby
land, pirates bysea, and customs duties either way. By expenses thus saved,
trading with Bushire could add 20% towhat the seller atBushire could safely
charge the buyer. Moreover, the decline of Ottoman power and influence, and
the growing strength ofthe Banu Kacb and Muntafiq Arabs seemed to doom
Basra to years of instability. The Wahhabis were also beginning to cause
concern. By contrast, Karim Khan had steadily gained strength. In 1765 the
Carmelite Bishop Cornelius ofIsfahan listed the towns and provinces under
Karim Khan's control as: Isfahan, Shushtar, Shiraz, Gilan, Tabriz, AzarbaTjan,
Hamadan, as well as part of Greater Armenia and Luristan, his native province.
The Bishop added that "various other usurpers" controlled other regions,
including Khurasan, Qandahar, and Lar from Kirman to Bandar Abbas.
Further afield, the Uzbeks had their own chief, and Sind, Hurmuz, Muscat,
Georgia, Baluchistan and various other provinces were also under independent
rulers. Except for Bushire, individual Arab chiefs held the towns and ports of
the Persian Gulf.51 Nevertheless, Karim Khan had subsequently consolidated
and extended his power. By 1769he wasin aposition to threaten an expedition
against the Imam of Muscat for the return of an Iranian ship and arrears of the
annual tribute formerly paid toNadir Shah. The Imam responded that Nadir
Shah had been adreaded tyrant but Karim Khan was only aprovincial pakll, to
be answered, if his demands persisted, with "Cannon andball". TheBritish were
apprehensive: the dispute threatened todisrupt further the Muscat coffee fleet
on which they levied customs atBasra. In 1765,coffee from Muscat toBasra,

conveyed in one of the Imam's men-of-war, had been unloaded at a Dutch
warehouse on Kharg for fear of the Kacb. Mir Muhanna raided this warehouse
early in 1766.In the next year, over a thousand bales of coffee had been collected
at Muscat, whence they could not be shipped to Basra because of Mir Muhanna's
ravages. To supply aconvoy for the coffee would annoy Karim Khan further: a
settlement with him seemed even more urgent, yet the London authorities
expressly vetoed an establishment at Bushire or elsewhere in Iran (any existing
settlement wasto be withdrawn), since such an agency's costs would offset any
increased profit from its sales. Further embassies to Karim Khan were
forbidden.52
Moreover, the East India Company in London gave additional proof of its
perturbation over affairs inthe Gulf when, inMarch 1769,it approached the
British government, something it did not dolightly, and asked fora naval
expedition to the Persian Gulf. It pleaded that, being "embroiled" with "almost
every Power" in the Gulf, the Company's interests were materially disrupted, to
the injury of British and Indian trade. The "Commerce between Persia and
Bengal" wasin particular "exposed to the Depredations lately suffered from . . .
Maritime Enemies" inthe region. This plea went as high as George III who
determined that restoration of peace and security in the Gulf should receive full
support. The expedition of Sir John Lindsay followed. He was given wide
powers in Indian affairs and plenipotentiary powers in those of the Persian
Gulf.53
Lindsay sailed in September 1769but by the time he reached his destination
Mir Muhanna was dead, the Banu Kacb were no longer a threat, the British
blockade had been lifted and Karim Khan's authority had been extended to
Kharg, whose vail was the Admiral of the Iranian fleet. Lindsay sent one ship to
the Gulf to investigate and concerned himself with India. In April 1770 he
reported that since Karim Khan hadgained Kharg island, trade had been carried
on without difficulty, and that the Khan was "by all accounts" agreat Prince.54
So much for arare instance of direct British government intervention inthe
affairs ofsouthern Iran and the Gulf before 1800;but it was soon to become
evident how powerful inthe area Karim Khan had become when three years
after Lindsay's appraisal of him he held a British factor hostage asa persuasive to

the Company toreopen their Bushire factory, part ofhis scheme to eliminate
Basra from the Indian-Iranian trade. Plague in 1773 atBasra forced the factors
there to take ship for India. Vessels from Bandar Rig seized one of the
Company's ships and held Beaumont and Green, two British agents, prisoner,
sending them toKarim Khan at Shiraz whence Green was sent toBasra with
Karim Khan's terms while Beaumont was kept in Shiraz as a hostage, to
emphasize Karim Khan's desire that the Bushire factory should be reopened.
Karim Khan was fortunate in his timing. Financial difficulties whichre
sulted, in combination with other causes, in the 1773 Regulating Act, preoccu
pied the Company in London. Hastings, in the middle of reforms of the Indian
administration andhaving troubles with theMarathas, hadmore urgent
business in India than in Iran. He could spare no troops, ships or money for that
quarter. Karim Khan's hostage-taking and the theft of the eight-gun Tjger in the
Gulf only produced adiplomatic response.
Robert Garden, another East India Company servant, and a former Agent in
Council at Basra, reached Bushire in April 1775 to negotiate with Karim Khan.
It was the very day Karim Khan's brother laid siege to Basra, where Abraham
Parsons ascribed the act tothe determination of the ruler ofShiraz todestroy
Basra's monopoly of the Indian trade, which was so much to Iran's detriment.
Moore had gone back to Basra the year before and now energetically helped in
its defence against Karim Khan's forces, even asking London for aid, a request
which was refused. Iranian ships appearing from Bushire hastened Moore's
departure, but as his vessels sailed down the Shatt al-cArab, he had his chance to
engage the Iranians and drive their ships into the mouth of the Karun. Itwas an
Omani fleet which eventually reopened the Shatt al-cArab to the passageof
supplies, but in April 1776 Basra had to capitulate.
Garden had already obtained Beaumont's release from Karim Khan, who
was satisfied that the Bushire factory would be restored. As master of Basra he
promised that the Company's property there would be duly protected. Thus
when Karim Khan died in 1779 there were again two East Indian Company
factories in thePersian Gulf, one at Basra and, quite contrary to explicit
instructions from the Board in London, another at Bushire.
In the turbulent period after Karim Khan's death two contending groups, the
Qajars and the Zands, resumed their competition for supremacy. When Karim
Khan breathed his last in 1779, Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar, atthat time a
prisoner in Shiraz, escaped. He and his family had suffered much at the hands of
both Afsharids and Zands. cAdil Shah, in his brief rule following Nadir Shah's
death, had ordered Agha Muhammad Khan's emasculation. Following his
367

father's fatal contest with the Zands, Agha Muhammad Khan became Karim
Khan's hostage. Although heenjoyed much freedom in Zand custody, he
nursed bitter hatred for the Zands and entertained the thought oftaking the
sovereignty ofPersia from them.
Following the outcome of a series of ferocious succession struggles, Karim
Khan's nephew, Jacfar Khan, consolidated hisauthority over much of the south,
with Shiraz as his headquarters, but, visiting Shiraz in 1787, the Company agent,
Harford Jones, saw that both Zand and Qajar leaders would be in competition
with each other and each would have to contend with disaffection in his armies.
But he considered the fact that Agha Muhammad Khan was a eunuch advanced
in years was a great disadvantage tothe Qajar cause since further succession
struggles following his death would be inevitable. By contrast, the promising
qualities of Jacfar Khan's son, Lutf All, were an advantage for the Zands, while
Agha Muhammad Khan's brothers were looked upon asmen of the "most
abandoned principles" whose sole ambition was plunder. Moreover, Jacfar
Khan seemed to enjoy firm support in the provinces over which he ruled, and
especially from the merchant community.55
All through the 18th century French activity in the area of the Gulf waxed
and waned. The British watched the signs anxiously. William Latouche in
Baghdad in 1784wrote apprehensively of energetic French enterprise and the
journey oftwo Frenchmen toIsfahan.56 In 1785 and 1786 Samuel Manesty at
Basra reported French ships first at Muscat, where they met with a "cool
reception", since the depredations ofFrench privateers there in 1781 had not
been forgotten, and subsequently at Basra, where the Kacb were hostile.57 While
in Shiraz in 1787, Jones took alarm at the visit of another French ship to Muscat,
and foresaw designs on Bandar Rig and Kharg. Orders issued to the provincial
government to prevent any French settlement on Kharg probably owed some
thing toJones's influence. Jacfar Khan was, commented Jones, "reluctant to
permit Foreigners topossess any part of Persia".58

by theBritish, this time by Jones and Manesty. Manesty favoured Basra
particularly as Shaikh Thuwainl ofthe Muntafiq Arabs was in control there,
issuing enlightened regulations which augured well for trade. Jones arguedin
favour of Bushire's potential for attracting theentire Gulf commerce. He
thought that the Turkish Pasha would never acquiesce in Shaikh Thuwaini's
continuing rule over Basra, and would be bound toattack him, so that Basra
would continue tobe a battleground, to the ruin of the local trade. Jones also
wanted toopen a factory at Shiraz towork inconjunction with Bushire. He
argued that, if the Company really wanted to make Kirman wool apart of their
European investment, it was at Shiraz that negotiations should take place.A
contract should be concluded with the local merchants for the purchase and
delivery of an annual quantity of wool at Bushire. In 1786 the Court of Directors
had asked why none ofthis once-regular item oftrade had been received for
several years, and directed that red and white wool (as much red as possible) be
sent to England.59 When this request reached Basra in 1787Kirman wool was
not available, and subsequent enquiries by Jones and Manesty estimated that the
annual quantity ofKirman wool available on the market amounted to 3,000
Tabriz maunds. (In 1764a Tabriz maund was said toamount to between 7.38
and 6.66 English pounds in weight.) In any event, Jacfar Khan had prohibited
the export of Kirman wool. As he collected duty on shawls manufactured inthe
province of Kirman it appears that heaimed at protecting his own nascent
industry. Some wool, however, did reach outside markets illegally, and it was
thought that Jacfar Khan, if approached in theproper manner, might lift his ban.
Since he wanted four field-pieces from Bombay, complete with gunners, Jones
considered a deal that would include wool possible.60
Jacfar Khan issued zfarman eminently favourable to English interests, but it
did not inaugurate fruitful commercial co-operation between Britain and Iran.
Nor was the long-standing conflict between Jacfar Khan and his Qajar rival
decided on the battlefield. Jones and Manesty in their letter of25 March 1789
informed the Secret Committee of his murder on 20 January by rival kinsmen

whom he had been holding prisoner. His twenty-year-old son, Lutf CA1I, took
refuge in Bushire.61 He gallantly and resourcefully continued a losing battle with
the Qajars until, betrayed during the siege of Kirman, he was taken prisoner at
Bam, blinded, and sent to Tehran, where he was strangled in 1794. Agha
Muhammad Khan's revenge included frightful massacres and destruction in
former Zand territories. These extreme measures completely disrupted the
Kirman wool trade. Jones reported that it wasthe "terrible Desolation that Aga
Mahammed Khan . . . carried into theProvince of Kerman in the year 1793/4 that
injuriously affected the Stock and consequently the breed of goats & not the
want oj Attention in theInhabitants". He related how, earlier, during their former
contests, the Zand and Qajar leaders had protected trade, each party aimingat
the "complete destruction" of the family of the other, and needing the revenue
which only production andcommerce could provide. Hence "thesafe passage of
Carravans . . . wasrespected".62 Now,as victor, Agha Muhammad was pursuing
a "scorched earth" policy. Not surprisingly, in the last quarter of the
18th century the Company's trade with Iran declined. The factories at Bushire
and Basra stayed open only with difficulty. The Resident at Bushire had to make
extensive repairs to the Company's buildings in 1779—80, since heavy rains had
"destroyed a fourth part ofthis Rotten Factory, and the rest is inDangerof
falling from every Shower". Disturbed conditions coupled with a personal
dispute at Basra in 1792 caused the Company's establishment, andits small sepoy
guard, tomove temporarily to Qurain [Kuwait].63
Karim Khan, described as "deficient inthe accomplishments of Literature
and Politeness", had nevertheless seemed to appreciate what tended to Persia's
advantage, "embracing and comprehending the more complicated, and exten
sive schemes, for its prosperity". He undertook numerous measures to promote
trade and manufacture and to bring back people lost through emigration. But
much of his time was spent in establishing his ascendancy and little remained for
consolidating gains and overseeing development. As has been seen, violent
disturbances followed his death. Although, in the eyes of Jones and Manesty at
least, Jacfar Khan and Lutf cAli Khan showed a "disposition toprotect and

encourage foreigners in their trade"64 similar to Karim Khan's, neither had time
to bring their objectives to fruition. In 1792Lutf cAlI Khan's seizure of Bushire
and blockade of Shiraz in hisdesperate struggle against Agha Muhammad Khan
Qajar caused the Resident at Bushire to report that, "although many revolutions
have happened of late years in this country", these were the most injurious
incidents todate.65 Yet in 1793, with over a year to go before the Qajar's final
defeat of Lutf AllKhan, theoptimistic vision of a potential prosperity,
apparently so hard to realize, is seen in one of the East India Company's reports
to the Privy Council, which referred to the extraordinary advantages Iran
derived from its geography. Sharing an Iranian tendency tolook back on the
halcyon days of the Safavids, the report stated that to geographical advantages
might beadded recollections of former times "of prosperity, affluence, and
splendour, with fertility of soil and... numerous natural productions", so that it
would be reasonable "to form great expectations from such a combination of
circumstances". However, it wasseen that only the"peace andtranquility which
. . . results from a steady well-regulated government" could turn these natural
advantages to good effect.66 This report may have been influenced by the
hopefulness of Harford Jones, but even hehad likened Iran to "a Paradise
inhabited by Devils".67
In the 1780s and 1790s, Gulf trade shifted from Basra to Muscat. First
plague, and then Basra's capitulation tothe Zands and later tothe Muntafiq
Arabs, had destroyed it as the Gulf's main commercial emporium. There had
long been aserious specie drain from Iran, not only to India through trade, but
also arising from the pilgrim traffic to the Shici Holy Places in Iraq, andto
Mecca. This had also affected Baghdad and Basra. Moreover, throughout the
area political convulsions resulted in depopulation and emigration. Basra,
Bushire and both the Company's and private trade suffered; but outside the
Strait of Hurmuz, Muscat showed acontrasting increase in wealth. Gone were
the days when the Imam had topurchase peace from the Zands after Karim
Khan had mastered Basra. Muscat itself now had a respected naval force.Its
ships traded with India, Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, East Africa and the
Yemen. Goods entering the Persian Gulf generally passed through Muscat and

paid customs there. Kuwait's and Bahrain's trade also showed an upward trend,
but not to the same degree asthat of Muscat.
Jones and Manesty singled out Muscat in their comprehensive Arabian and
Iranian trade review of 1790. They attributed Oman's increased "exertions" and
their success to three factors. First, the decline and eventual "extinction" of "the
Commerce of Gombroon". Secondly, the impetus to ship-building which initial
advantages in mercantile ventures gave. Dhows and "Dingies" had increased in
size aswell asnumbers, and "private merchants" ofMuscat "caused square
rigged Vessels ofdifferent kinds and considerable Burthen, tobe constructed
for them in different Parts of India". Thirdly, Muscat's development as a major
port, with its merchants trading far afield, caused it tobe "frequented by the
Vessels ofEuropean Nations", and made it "amore rich and flourishing Sea
Port than any of those bordering on the Persian Gulf". An additional factor was
the Imam's appointment of an effective and just deputy to govern the port,so
that merchants' persons and property were considered immune from violation.
The commerce at Gombroon (Bandar cAbbas) was indeed extinct. The
Dutch factory remained, but those of the English and French were in ruins. The
road thence toIsfahan had for years been unsafe and unused. Bushire was the
only port of importance onthe Gulf coast of Iran, but the specie problem
inhibited its trade with India because Iran required money rather than goods in
exchange for its exports. Further, as Jones and Manesty observed, "the spirit of
Mercantile Adventure inthe Merchants atBushire, will always rise orfall, in
proportion to the Stability or Instability of the Government at Sherauze".
Commercial conditions in Zand territories were inauspicious. The port of
Bandar Rig had been abandoned. Kharg no longer had any commercial signifi
cance, but because of inland trade movements with Basra and elsewhere, and a
local government which encouraged trade, the inland city of Shushtar had
attracted considerable interest in its key position where routes from the Iranian
plateau entered the southern plains of Khuzistan, facilitating access to Mesopo
tamia and Syria.
Shushtar thus provided an example, in the generally gloomy scene observed
in 1790,of Iran's capacity never to justify total pessimism; and of the survival of
an East-West overland and local trade depending on animals rather than ships,
and on inland entrepots rather than on offshore islands inpiratical seas, or on
ports on insecure shores. Ineffect, Shushtar showed increased prosperity at a
time when East India Company and private European maritime trading in the
Gulf, with Bushire and Basra in decline as seaports, showed theopposite.
Harford Jones and Manesty were not blind to what might be termed Iran's "old

RELATIONS WITH EUROPEAN COMPANIES
inland trade". They noted how the size and variety ofthe kingdom occasioned
"considerable inland commerce, as thedifferent Provinces naturally stand in
need, of the productions of each other". Their analysis of various regions'
products and natural wealth turned their attention inland. The British had the
alternatives of total withdrawal or of adopting new methods of penetration.
Jones and Manesty advocated the latter, with a peripatetic Resident based on
Bushire butleaving a deputy there while he travelled andresided where he
thought fit. Much more information about the country was needed and direct
contacts with its merchants seemed desirable. The specie shortage might be
surmounted by recourse to barter deals, and aproposal put forward in 1787 was
repeated, that British goods, woollens, glass, hardware, not to mention Axmin
ster and Wilton carpets, might profitably be offered in exchange for medicinal
drugs needed by hospitals in India.68
In spite of depressing trading conditions, the East India Company stationsat
Basra andBushire retained a degree of viability. Basra was a keystage in
overland despatches going toand from India and England, and, should some
thing unforeseen occur at Basra, then Bushire would be ready for use. As
hostilities with France approached, this became increasingly a consideration.
Both stations were posts for collecting information. Hope continued that
conditions within Iran would stabilize to produce a more favourable trading
climate. Trade was theparamount British interest in 18th-century Iran:few
British people lived or travelled in thecountry who were notengaged in it.
Trade would continue to bea preoccupation, but not a main function of that
new phase ofBritain's and British India's relationship with Iran, which opened
with the new century. It was political and strategic imperatives, beginning to
take shape towards the end ofthe 18th century, which were toendure through
the 19th century and into the 20th.

CHAPTER I I
IRANIAN RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN
AND BRITISH INDIA, T798-1921
The European power geographically closest toIran was Russia. Peter the Great
had brought thetwo countries into conflict as a result of his ambitions in the
Caspian and the Caucasus regions, thereby threatening Iran's northwestern
provinces. Extended into Central Asia these Russian ambitions set a pattern
which lasted long beyond the 18th century, although Peter's death in 1725 and
Nadir Shah's campaigns temporarily halted Russia's advance. In the distracted
decades later in the century Iran's position inthe Caucasus grew steadily weaker,
and when it attempted tore-establish relationships asthey had existed under the
Safavids, Georgia sought theprotection of Catherine the Great.
In 1795 theurge to recover one of the Safavid kingdom's richest provinces
prompted Agha Muhammad Khan's march into Georgia. Catherine responded
by sending a Russian expedition (1796) under Count Valerian Zubov, and the
Qajar Shah was again on his way toGeorgia when he was murdered in 1797. The
problem ofthe northwest frontier and Iran's relations with Russia were among
the most difficult his nephew and successor, Fath CA1I Shah, hadto face. To
obtain help in this problem was themain objective of Iranian statecraft in the
complicated negotiations conducted throughout the Napoleonic period, but
neither France nor Britain could provide the kind of support Iran needed.
Britain's diplomatic and strategic interest inIran arose initially not from the
perception ofa Russian, but aFrench threat. In 1796, the Chairman ofthe Board
of Directors of the East India Company, Stephen Lushington, was in correspon
dence with Henry Dundas, President of the Board of Control, regarding the
French menace to India through Egypt. An alliance with Iran was a possible
countermeasure. Theterms envisaged resembled those which had beensug
gested by Major John Morrison earlier and which he nowagain urged on
Dundas. Morrison, a former East India Company army officer, hadbeen for
some years in theservice of the Mughul padshah, Shah cAlam. Hehad visited
Shlraz in 1787 and saw inJacfar Khan Zand apossible useful ally. For thirty-six
years Morrison had pressed onvarious Ministers proposals forsuch analliance.
His visit to Shlraz hadprompted hisappeal to theauthorities in London for
powers to make a treaty with Jacfar Khan. His arrangement envisaged making

officers available, with arms and supplies, forthe Zand army in exchangefor
commercial privileges and rights. He too had been attracted bythe "wool of
Carmania which issuperior tothat ofSpain and would alone make a consider
able article ofcommerce", but his efforts bore little fruit. Dundas understood
Iran's strategic significance, but refused totake any action. Apower-centreno
longer existed in south Iran, and he was anxious not to antagonize Russia in view
of the general hostilities with France.1
Late in 1795, two French botanists with an interpreter appeared in Iran.
These naturalists were empowered by theRepublic of France to undertake
political negotiations, and in an exchange of views with Agha Muhammad Shah
they had encouraged him toattack his Ottoman neighbours and to send 12,000
horsemen to the assistance of Tipu Sultan in India. They also sought permission
to open a factory at Bandar Abbas. TheShah, however, refused all their
requests.2 These and other French activities inIran and the Gulf, especially at
Muscat, made the British extremely apprehensive. In July 1798, the Court of
Directors appointed Harford Jones "Resident at theCourt of the Pacha of
Bagdad" to counter the intrigues ofthe French. Shortly thereafter, the Com
pany's talented and versatile Iranian employee, Mahdl All Khan, was appointed
Resident atBushire. He was togo first toMuscat toreport on French activities
there, and then to Bushire, to take charge of the factory. Hewas to make
recommendations for stopping the spread of French influence inIran, but "the
great object ofyour appointment isthe extension ofthe Company's European
imports into Persia, and the improvement to the highest possible degree of their
selling price". Thus itwas hoped to revive the trade atBushire and make it once
more commercially rewarding.3
After Karim Khan's death the fragmentation of Iran had spread tothe Gulf,
where the ruler of Muscat had emerged as the most important power, militarily

as well as commercially. Hecontrolled most of the islands and much of the
Iranian shore. As farmer of the port of Gombroon he could, ifso inclined, grant
rights there again to theDutch and theFrench, with whom Muscat had a
longstanding relationship. Mahdi CA1I Khan received profuse assurances of
friendship from theruler, a promise to expel the French, and permission to
establish a factory in Muscat - anidea which hedid not pursue, since there
seemed an established tradition that a factory for one meant afactory for all.4 He
then proceeded to Bushire. The threatened combination of the French with
Tipu Sultan ofMysore and also with Zaman Shah ofAfghanistan, had intensi
fied British interest in Iran. One idea was toask the Russians topersuade the
Iranians toharass Zaman Shah. Lord Grenville, the British Foreign Secretary,
opposed this. Lord Wellesley (then the Earl of Mornington) frequently referred
in his correspondence to Zaman Shah, who had advanced to Lahore in 1796 and
threatened to do so again. The despatches reveal how little was known about the
regions beyond the Indus at that time. Lord Wellesley sent Mahdi All Khan into
Iran to persuade "Baba Khan [Fath All Shah] or whatever person may be in
exercise ofthe sovereignty ofPersia" todistract Zaman Shah. To accomplish
this, military supplies could beprovided, but Wellesley confessed:
I am not possessed of sufficient information respecting the state of Persia, or the views of the ruling powers in that country, to enable me at present to furnish Mehdi Ali Khan with
any specific instructions or powers for the attainment ofthe object incontemplation.5
Mahdi All Khan, by his own account, "raised such a flame, &Commotion in
the Country ofZamaun Shah, that to extinguish &overcome the same will not
be aneasy matter forthe stars themselves".6 Fath All Shah had, in fact, for
reasons of his own, sent an advance force of cavalry against Herat, tobe joined
by larger forces later, but the Bombay authorities in their alarm at Zaman Shah's
approach to India, seen in the context of European dangers, took satisfaction in
Mahdi cAli Khan's "marked success" and wrongly attributed to his measures
"the sole or principal means of obliging Zaman Shah toreturn from his Indian
Expedition".7
Harford Jones at Baghdad strongly disapproved of Mahdi All Khan's
mission. To set the Iranians against the Afghans was like setting abull to attacka

lion. Or, as he put it in another way, the "arrow launched" against Zaman Shah
would "irritate but not wound". He deplored touching off a Shfi-SunnI war.
Sending a mission toKabul seemed a better way todeal with Zaman Shah.8
Jonathan Duncan, the Governor of Bombay, told Jones that he would reverse
the Bull and Lion metaphor, that he had made overtures to Kabul and had
received no response, and that Jones's letters would be forwarded to London
since inthe coming decisions all points of view were needed.9 Thus, inthese
early diplomatic moves, there emerged oneof the most perplexing and continu
ous problems in the formulation of British policy: which of the two to support
and rely upon, Iran or Afghanistan?
Mahdi cAlTKhan claimed to have created asadiversion theexpedition sent by
Fath CA1TShah towards Herat. According to one of Mahdi All Khan's reports,
the Iranians came to within about a day's distance of Zaman Shah before turning
back.10 Thus Zaman Shah was not crushed, although as a consequence of
internal dissensions within his kingdom hewould shortly bedeposed and
blinded (1800). In 1799, however, the British in India were still agitated bythe
Afghan threat. Moreover, theFrench hadinvaded Egypt, andtheRussians were
in Georgia. Both were intriguing in Iran. Lord Wellesley determined to send
another "more important and dignified" mission toTehran.11 Captain John
Malcolm, selected to lead this mission, explained how he perceived his
objectives:
To relieve India from the annual alarm of Zemaun Shah's invasion, which isalways attended with serious expenses to the Company, by occasioning adiversion upon his Persian provinces; tocounteract the possible attempts ofthose villanous but active democrats theFrench; to restore to some part of its former prosperity atrade whichhas
been in great degree lost.12
In Baghdad, Jones felt that the Tehran mission should have been given to him,
and he was also worried that Malcolm's splendid embassy would arouse jealousy
at Constantinople; an Anglo-Turkish mission to Kabul which he had suggested
would, it seemed, be rendered superfluous.13
Malcolm followed much the same route as Mahdi All Khan. He attached

great weight to strengthening the connection with the ruler of Muscat, the only
Arab ruler able togive effective aid toa European enemy attempting an attack
on India by way of the Red Sea or thePersian Gulf, and entered into an
agreement with him before visiting the islands of Hurmuz, Qishm, Hinjam, and
Kharg, on hisway to Bushire. There, he wrote his report on the trading
prospects of the Persian Gulf. This had much in common with that of Manesty
and Jones tenyears before and with the more recent report of Maister and
Fawcett atBombay.14 All cited the prolonged disturbances inIran as the main
reason for the decline of trade. All stressed the alluring commercial potential of
Iran. Malcolm saw grounds for optimism in the attitude of the Qajar rulers
towards commerce, but his report differed from earlier ones inits emphasison
political matters.
An attack upon India by way ofthe Red Sea orthe Persian Gulf might,he
supposed, in thefuture come from Syria and Aleppo bythe Euphrates and
through Baghdad, or from the direction ofthe Caspian. The latter would, of
course, involve the"great Northern Power". Toguard against such future
danger he recommended gaining a firm footing inIran and the Gulf. Bushire
seemed the most advantageous place for a settlement on the mainland.
Malcolm's report also described and compared various islands in the Gulf.
Qishm seemed to meet British needs, and Malcolm subsequently discussed with
Fath All Shah its possible cession to the British. However, he dropped the idea
when it became clear that this issue involved other parties in the Gulf.15
While at Bushire and during his progress to Tehran, Malcolm collected as
much information as he could about Iran. Inan early assessment, he described
Fath All Shah,as:
universally represented as aMonarch of a humane disposition and a lover of Justice but he is said to be more bent on sensual gratifications and magnificant ease, than on the great and ambitious projects which constantly haunted the active mind of his Predecessor Aga Mahummud from whom, however, he inherits the vice ofavarice.

His chief minister, Hajji Ibrahim Ttimad al-Daula, he thought tobe one of the
best statesmen Iran had ever had.16 Jones's somewhat different assessment of
HajjT Ibrahim was probably nearer the mark. His betrayal of Lutf CA1I Khan had
shown him to be a man "without honor or principle", but his conduct as
minister at the Court of Tehran revealed his "ability and resource".17 Malcolm's
long description ofthe Iranian army concluded that Georgia was irretrievably
lost. The Iranian soldier was extraordinarily brave, the unequal contest with
Russia would not cease, but there could be only one outcome: the Iranian army
was no match for European organization and discipline. Given Fath CA1I Shah's
character, Malcolm doubted whether he would persevere long in his contest
with Zaman Shah. As Malcolm described Khurasan, it "properly speaking
stretches from Candahar to Yezd east and west and from near Kirman tothe sea
of Arriel". It was further divided into three parts ofwhich Zaman Shah ruled
one part, from Qandahar to Herat. Fath CA1I Shah would, Malcolm thought,
advance on Khurasan. Pride alone demanded that he do something. Inany case
Iran would keep up the alarm for atleast another year and thus occupy Zaman
Shah ata critical time.18
Malcolm reached Tehran in November 1800. Early in 1801 he concluded
commercial and political treaties with Fath CA1I Shah. The commercial treaty
allowed the British to settle in anyIranian seaport or city. Several other
provisions encouraged trade. By the political treaty the Shah undertook to "lay
waste anddesolate theAfghan dominions", should an attempt be made to
invade India. Should an Irano-Afghan war break out, Britain would supply arms
to Iran. Other provisions committed Britain to help the Iranians in any war with
the French, and, on their side, theIranians would prevent theFrench from
establishing themselves onany islands oron the coast. Malcolm had found his
negotiations in Tehran difficult. Ashe put it:
This Government has ever considered the English . . . asTraders and Merchants that benefited by a Commerce with Persia, and as such has often granted them Firmauns of Protection and Privilege but never thought for a moment ofentering into any regular alliance with them . . . it is almost impossible to explain to them the nature of the Honorable Company's Government and of the delegated Powers vested in the Governor

General inamanner to satisfy them ofthe latter's competency to treat immediately and on a footing with an independent Sovereign.
Malcolm tried tocounteract this by attention toform and precedence, and bythe
lavish distribution of gifts.19
By the time these treaties were concluded, the threat from both Afghanistan
and France had receded. Consequently, British interest inIran waned. None the
less, there were people such as Jones who thought that a permanent mission
ought tobe maintained atTehran. He also thought himself uniquely qualified to
fill the post. He strongly advised that the appointment ofa minister toTehranbe
made "from home".20 In 1802, Britain and France concluded the Treaty of
Amiens, which lasted only into 1803.The Shah made unsuccessful attemptsto
obtain British help inhis renewed struggle with Russia intheCaucasus, and,
failing, drew closer toNapoleon. The resulting French missions of 1805-6 were
sufficiently alarming tostir the Government ofIndia toratify Malcolm's treaties
of 1801 in 1806.21
Meanwhile, however, the Russian invasion of Georgia in 1803had prompted
Fath CA1I Shah to take the initiative in renewing ties with France. This overture
and Talleyrand's correspondence with Jean Rousseau, consul-general at Bagh
dad in 1803—4, stimulated Napoleon's interest. The missions of Alexandre
Romieu and Amedee Jaubert toTehran in 1805were the result. Napoleon wrote
two letters toFath CA1I Shah, in February and March 1805, in which herecalled
the military exploits of Nadir Shah and Agha Muhammad Khan, pointed outthe
dangers toIran from Russia and from British India, and called for aclose alliance
with France. Romieu reached Tehran inOctober 1805. He wasonly able to
deliver Napoleon's letter to the Shah andtosend home onereport before he
died. His assistant, Georges Outrey, brought back to France thenews that the
Shah intended to send anambassador to Paris — a decision ofgreat significance.
Jaubert, meanwhile, had been imprisoned formonths atBayazit onthe way and

did not arrive in Tehran until June 1806. Though in poor physical condition, he
was able to present Napoleon's second letter to the Shah, who suggested thata
French ambassador be sent toTehran, and offered togive support toFrance
against the British in India. The Shah, fearing that two successive French envoys
might die on his soil, speeded Jaubert's departure. The court physician attended
him as faras Turkey. The Shah's ambassador went with him to meet the
Emperor atFinkenstein inApril 1807. An alliance was signed there in May.
General Claude Mathieu Gardane's subsequent mission brought Iran, although
only briefly, into Napoleon's grand designs.22
Lord Wellesley had been recalled as Governor-General of India in 1805 as a
direct consequence of his expansionist policies. In the instructions given to his
successor, Lord Cornwallis, the latter wascommitted to retrenchment and tothe
reversal of Wellesley's principles, withdrawing from all connections and alli
ances outside India. The dispute about how and where to defend India was to
continue throughout the 19thcentury. More immediately, this reversal of policy
led tothe initial success ofthe French inIran in 1807. Two documents, the
Treaty of Finkenstein and Gardane's instructions, illustrate the scope and
seriousness ofNapoleon's ambitions.
By the Treaty of Finkenstein, France acknowledged the territorial integrity
of Iran and her historic claims toGeorgia; promised tomake every effort to
obtain the Russian evacuation ofthat province, and to bring about a peace
between Iran and Russia; and meanwhile, to assist the Iranian army with
weapons and military advisers. Iran, in return, undertook todeclare war on
Great Britain; to expel British citizens from Iranian territory; to work with the
Afghans and the Marathas to attack the British possessions in India; and, should
Napoleon embark upon the invasion of India, to give the French army passage
across the country.
In his long and precise instructions to Gardane, Napoleon stressed that Iran
was important to France as being a natural enemy of Russia, and as a "moyen de
passage" forthe invasion of India.23 He emphasized the need for detailed
geographical information and for an analysis ofIran's military potentialities.

Gardane was a man ofhigh calibre and great resourcefulness, with a family
connection with Iran. He was accompanied by animpressive contingent of
military and civilian assistants, but his instructions became irrelevant as aresult
of events inEurope. When Napoleon reached his accommodation with Tsar
Alexander at Tilsit, two months after Finkenstein, no provision was made for
the return of Georgia to the Shah. This need not have meant the endof
Napoleon's interest in Iran. The combination of France, Russia and Iran against
British India would have proved formidable. But the rising against Napoleon in
Spain extinguished any possibility for close co-operation between France and
Iran for the achievement of their very different objectives.24 The events in Spain
and Portugal, Lord Minto (Governor-General in India, 1807—13) wrote in1809,
"appear to insure this country [India] from any European attack atleast fora
considerable period if not forever".25 Gardane's position in Iran became
untenable. When the commander of the Russian forces in the Caucasus, General
Gudovich, besieged Erivan, headquarters of a vassal khan of the Shah, Gardane
was unable togive the Iranians any assistance.
In the spring of1808 French designs in the East had been for the British in
India "the important subject which now engages so deeply all our thoughts and
attention".26 Lord Minto, from the time he became Governor-General in June
1807, had taken animmediate interest in the regions beyond India. French
diplomacy, particularly in Iran, worried him. It was seeking, he thought, "with
great diligence, themeans of extending its intrigues to the Durbars of
Hindoostan". Napoleon had long looked towards India and had "pushed as
usual his diplomacy in front of his military operations". Added to this was the
precariousness of British rule: "We must not forget the nature of our tenure on
this Empire, and that it would not require a great European army to disturb our
security inIndia." With so much atstake, steps needed tobe taken to guard
against a "remote but possible danger".27
Gardane's arrival inIran brought anew urgency to the problem of Indian
defence. The "leading principle" ofMinto's "most secret thoughts" on the
subject wasthat "we ought to meet the expected contest in Persia or the adjacent
countries". He authorized another mission, Malcolm's second, to go from India

to Tehran. Simultaneously, the authorities in London hadappointed Sir
Harford Jones astheir envoy to Iran. Jones had, in January 1807, written a
memorandum arguing that although Iran had been won over to France by
promises of relief from Russian pressure, France had, in fact, neither by
mediation nor by arms, furnished that relief. Jones recommended that England
appoint an envoy to go to Saint Petersburg to discuss apossible settlement, and
to proceed from there toGeorgia for further negotiations. "If he succeeds in
accommodating matters between Russia and Persia the Task of attaching Persia
exclusively tothe Interests ofEngland will be aneasy one."28
Jones was given authority to sign a treaty with the Shah inHis Majesty's
name, "but any promise of pecuniary or military assistance wasto be made only
in reference tothe Forces actually inIndia, and to the Funds of the East India
Company: bywhom also the expenses attending the Mission are to be de
frayed".29 The Malcolm and Jones missions became involved in prolonged and
bitter squabbles. Minto explained his conduct as follows:
When I first determined todepute Col. Malcolm to Persia, all that was known of Sir Harford Jones, was his departure from England, to Petersburgh on his way to Persia about the time that I sailed for India: we did not afterwards learn whether he had accomplished the object of his journey to Petersburgh, whether he wasto proceed from thence, to Persia, or whether, in that event, itwas possible to find his way through so many hostile Countries. Everything that related to his mission was uncertain, and especially thetime of his arrival at hisdestination. It wasin these circumstances and after Genl. Gardanne [sic] had actually reached the Persian Court, and the French ascendancy there wasevery dayadvancing, that Ithought it impossible to leave the British Interests in that important quarter totally unprovided for any longer, anddirected Col. Malcolm to proceed thither without a moment's delay.30
Minto's decision in fact formed part of a larger frontier policy. Napoleon was
not alone in appreciating the value of accurate topographical data. Charles
Metcalfe received instructions to travel to thePunjab; Mountstuart Elphinstone
was sent to Afghanistan. As Minto put it to Dundas: "Wehave not till of late had
much inducement to frequent, or make much enquiry concerning the countries
beyond the Indus";31 but the advance ofknowledge ofregions hitherto little
known and the spread of this information in Europe became one of the striking
features of the Napoleonic years. When Malcolm was setting out on his third

mission in 1809, his second having proved abortive, hemet Captain Charles
Christie and Lt Henry Pottinger atBombay. They had just returned from Sind.
Under Malcolm's auspices, they undertook another journey and explored routes
through Sistan and Herat into southern and central Iran. Pottinger's account of
this expedition, together with Elphinstone's Accountof theKingdom ofCaubul, and
Malcolm's History of Persia^ provided their contemporaries with first-hand
information about these areas and their inhabitants. Like the books of James
Morier, Harford Jones and others, their works sold well. Malcolm paid tribute
to the work of his contemporaries in advancing knowledge of the geography of
Iran, especially of the routes between "the territories of that Kingdom and
India". Much had been known before "regarding the usual road to Indiaby
Meshed, Candahar, Cabul &Lahore, but. . .previous to the journies of the late
Captain Grant, Lieutenant Christie and Ensign Pottinger", little was known "of
the practicability or otherwise of an Army penetrating to India by the routes of
Seistan, Balochistan orMekran". Now "future measures ofdefence" couldbe
grounded onfresh information about "the nature of the Countries and their
inhabitants".32
Minto was right inattributing Fath CA1I Shah's refusal toreceive Malcolm's
mission of the summer of1808, and his reception of Harford Jones early in 1809,
to thedegree of influence Gardane still retained. In hislast uncomfortable
months in Iran Gardane felt the falseness of his position acutely. But he
resolutely made it a condition of his continued residence there that a British
mission should not enter the country. The Shah had still enough faith in the
French to refuse Malcolm, but not enough to refuse Harford Jones. When Jones
arrived, Gardane left, as he had said he would, although this ran counter to what
was expected of him in France.
When Harford Jones arrived in Tehran in February 1809 he found the Shah
seriously menaced by the Russians. In just over a month heconcluded a new
treaty. By itsterms, Iran cancelled other treaties with European powers, and
agreed to oppose anyEuropean force attempting to pass through Iranian
territory to India. Britain undertook to give financial and military assistance,
should aEuropean power attack Iran, mediating initially ifBritain was atpeace
with that Power, but thereafter rendering Iran military aid if such mediation
failed. In case of war between Iran and Afghanistan, Britain would not intervene
unless both parties requested mediation. Lord Minto had toaccept the treaty,
with areluctance all the greater because of his sensitivity regarding the Govern

ment of India's authority, and because Jones's activities in Tehran ran directly
counter to Minto's own frontier policy. After the news of events in Spain and
Portugal, heregarded asvisionary the idea of any French menace to India. He
thereupon lost interest in involvement beyond India's northwestern frontiers,
and abandoned the idea of expeditions to the Persian Gulf, including any
question of occupying Kharg.33
In thesummer of 1809 Minto had again sent Malcolm to Iran. In 1810,for
some months, Tehran witnessed unseemly wrangling between the two envoys,
which was settled by the appointment of a fresh envoy, Sir Gore Ouseley, whose
powers superseded the others. Hisinstructions referred to "some misunder
standings between the Governor General of India andYour Predecessor Sir
Harford Jones" regarding the latter's relationship to the former (his mission had
been funded bythe East India Company), and this time it was made clear that,
while hewas strictly enjoined to attend to the Company's interests, Sir Gore's
"appointments shall be defrayed byour Royal Treasury and that you shall only
receive our Instructions and Directions through the Channel ofour Secretaryof
State ofthe Foreign Department and that you shall only be responsible tous for
your conduct andbehaviour during your Embassy".34
Ouseley converted Jones's Preliminary Treaty of 1809 into what was to
become theDefinitive Treaty of 1812. It committed theShah to obstruct any
European force attempting to reach India across Iran. In return, the British
promised military aid anda subsidy should anyEuropean power invade that
country. Events in Europe, however, overtook this treaty when, in 1812,
Napoleon invaded Russia, and Britain made agreements with Sweden and
Russia. Consequently when hostilities were renewed between Russia and Iran,
despite the 1812 treaty Britain failed to provide direct help toIran. Nevertheless,
some ofthe British officers ofthe 1809 contingent, sent toreplace the French in
Iran, fought alongside the Iranians, and Ouseley played a mediating role in the
Russo-Iranian armistice of 1813, but was only able toprevent harsh terms from
being harsher.35 Iran was compelled to accept substantial territorial cessions,
including Georgia, and had to grant rights to Russia on the Caspian. A lull in
what hadbeen bitter fighting then ensued until 1826.
With the end of the Napoleonic era several trends became clear. First, politics
had replaced commerce asthe chief European concern in Iran. For Britain and

France alike, policy in the East turned upon alignments in Europe. AsMinto put
it to Malcolm in 1809: "The Policy in Persia must follow theevents in Europe",36
a point by no means evident to the Shah, whohad tried to achieve his aims first
by aBritish and then by aFrench alliance. Success had eluded him because Iran
was not ofthe first order ofimportance tohis European allies. The priority
Europeans attached to European interests and the facts of geography made this
inevitable.
Russia, by contrast with Britain and France, had pursued aconsistent policy
which geography helped rather than hindered, and which gathered momentum
from territorial gains. For British India, on the other hand, the Afghan threat
and the French menace had proved only a transitory diversion. The contrast
between Russia's perennial and Britain's fluctuating preoccupation with Iran
was not lost on observers such as Manesty, Malcolm, andJones. In theearly part
of the century they had called attention to the Russian danger, which became
better understood after British officers had served as advisers to the Iranians.By
1810, when Malcolm dubbed Russia oneof the "chief obstacles to our success in
Persia",37 hewasonly stating what hadbecome common knowledge. The threat
was not only of Russia's outright territorial ambitions at Iran's expense, but also
of the impact on India ofan Iran subservient to Russia.
Fruitful co-operation between nations generally requires common interests.
During the 19thcentury Russian pressure might have provided Britain, British
India and Iran with grounds for common action, but the Napoleonic years had
revealed how shifting these grounds could be. They had demonstrated that
Britain and Iran had frequently changing priorities. In their struggle with
Napoleon the British followed whatever course forwarded their cause, sacrific
ing anywhich didnot. At thesame time, Iran, threatened on hernorthern border
by Russia, had to find help wherever shecould. If, in theend,neither the British
nor theFrench could provide effective aid,Iranian statesmen hadto settle forthe
best accommodation they could make with Russia, an alternative from which
they derived little benefit.
It wasin the Napoleonic era that regular diplomatic relations began between
Britain and Iran. The Shah responded to Malcolm's first mission by sending an
envoy toIndia who was accidentally killed ina riot inBombay in 1802, an
episode which caused profound anxiety inIndia. Both Mahdi All Khan and
Malcolm were called upon to smooth things over with the Persians. Finally, in

1804, Manesty delivered a letter apologising to the Shah at his camp at
Sultaniya.38 The Shah's second representative arrived inIndia inopportunely in
1805, the year Romieu arrived, in October, in Tehran and Fath All Shah's
flirtation with Napoleon began in earnest.
Jones's mission initiated more formal diplomatic exchanges. Onconclusion
of his treaty, Jones was confirmed as minister to Iran and theShah's envoy to
George III was received in England in November 1809. He was found to be
conversant with thestrategic significance which theBritish attached to Herat,
knowledge which Ouseley thought had been gleaned from the French.39 George
Forster's description of Herat in 1783had called attention to its strategic
location.40 Herat was ofvital concern to 19th century British policy-makers. It
caused wars with both Iran and Afghanistan. Early in the 20th century,
however, views changed. In 1904, SirGeorge Clarke expressed theconviction
that if Russia attempted to rehabilitate herprestige by a strike against Herat:
"We must keep our heads quite cool and imprison the idiots who will say that
Herat is the 'keyof India'."41
When theIranian envoy left for England, James Morier accompaniedhim
with the treaty negotiated by Jones. In 1811, both returned to Tehran with
Ouseley tomake those adjustments which turned Jones's preliminary treaty into
the definitive treaty ofMarch 1812. This was subjected tofurther revisions until,
in a form agreed to in 1814, the Treaty ofTehran became the basis for relations
between Iran and Britain until the Anglo-Iranian warof 1856. TheShah, in
exchange fora subsidy, agreed to resist any encroachment upon his country by
European armies hostile to Britain, and to use his influence with the rulers who
controlled "Karezan, Taturistan, Bokhara, Samarkand, or other routes", to
stop any invasion aimed atIndia through these territories. Articles four and six,
providing for aid to Iran "in case of any European nation invading Persia",
caused trouble later. Malcolm's commercial treaty of 1801 was not reaffirmed.
Not until 1841, in spite of frequent efforts, wasa commercial treaty at last
concluded. It provided for "most favoured nation" treatment and allowedthe
British to have consulates at Tabriz and Tehran.42
It will have already become evident that Britain's former exclusively com
mercial concern with Iran hadyielded to new political andstrategic consider
ations. At the same time the different and sometimes conflicting policy goals and

assessments in London and Calcutta remained anissue throughout the period.
Twice control passed to India, from 1822 to 1836 and again forabout a yearin
185 9—60,43 and India bore a large share ofthe cost even when the Foreign Office
exercised control. In 1871 investigations disclosed that forthe past thirty-eight
years the total expenditure onthe mission had amounted to£510,000, ofwhich
India hadpaid £450,000. In 1879 theIndia Office secured a reduction of the
annual charge from £12,000 to£10,000, but the issue continued tobe a boneof
contention well into the 20th century.44
Another feature ofAnglo-Iranian relations inthe earlier decades ofthe 19th
century was the fluctuation in the degree of British interest in Iran and
willingness to beconsistently concerned. For example, it was felt after Napo
leon's defeat that there wasless need for an active policy. British efforts to
mediate with Russia onIran's behalf had proved disappointing. In 1815, Henry
Ellis believed that they "did not inthe least mitigate the calamities ofPersia, but
that on the contrary . . . accelerated the signature of a Treaty bywhich all the
countries then inthe possession ofthe Russian Troops, were formally cededby
the Shah".45 The prevailing view inIndia was that any Russian threat shouldbe
met nearer India, perhaps atthe river Indus, which meant that little attempt was
made to cultivate relations, learn more about, or build upon the alliances with
the states tothe north and west, ofwhich Iran was then the most important. In
September 1815, Henry Willock was appointed charge d'affaires inTehran. One
of several British officers serving in the East India Company's army who went
with SirHarford Jones to Persia in 1808 to train Iranian troops, he hadseen
action in 1812 against the Russians atTalish and in 1814 had commanded Iranian
forces in an expedition into Kurdistan. Nevertheless, his appointment was a
deliberate move tolower the standing of the mission. When Ouseley left Tehran
his instructions toMorier had pointed toreduced involvement, especially inthe
training which British officers were giving to the Iranian army.46

ment ofIndia in 1822.47 This opened up again the question ofwhat kindof
mission there should be in Tehran. George Canning, in a Foreign Office
memorandum, recalled that the "hopelessness" of attempting to ameliorate
peace terms imposed by Russia upon the Shah had forced the withdrawal ofthe
British ambassador, andtherelegation of the mission to a look-out post to watch
the intrigues and encroachments of Russia. No attempt to counteract them was
authorized. He believed that as it was India's view that a good understanding
with Iran was important, it seemed logical that "an Asiatick mission to an
Asiatick Court would, for objects essentially Asiatick, be more expedient than
the maintenance ofa Charge d'Affaires from London incompetition with a
Russian Minister of higher Rank and Allowances". Thus, in spite of strenuous
objections from the Shah and from British officials in Iran and in India, control
of the British mission in Tehran was transferred from theCrown to the
Company, from London to India.48
In 1826 thesecond Irano-Russian warbegan andcontinued into 1828, ending
in the defeat of Iran. The subsequent Treaty of Turkmanchai deprived Iran of
further territory in addition to that already lost, imposed upon it a large
indemnity, and affirmed Russia's exclusive rights in the Caspian. Britain had not
provided the support the Shah had expected, but British officers had taken part
in the war and the British representative had tried to ease the peace terms. For
Britain, the timing of the war wasacutely embarrassing. Canning was involved
in negotiations with Russia aimed to help the Greeks without breaking upthe
Ottoman Empire: even indirect involvement in hostilities against Russia in
another theatre was unthinkable. Replying to Williams Wynn's analysis of
British obligations, Canning not only maintained that no casus foederis existed,
but that the Iranians had started the war. Russian encroachments had taken
place, he agreed, but there had been no Russian attack on Iran. Malcolm and
Ellis contended, not unreasonably, that Fath All Shah had been forced by
internal pressures, especially from the religious zealots, to engage the Russian
forces.49

RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN AND BRITISH INDIA
After thepeace of Turkmanchai in 1828, theIranians felt thefutility of
resistance to Russia and suffered further humiliation by having to send an
embassy to St. Petersburgh to apologize for the murder of the Russian envoy in
Tehran. They were thoroughly disheartened by Britain's inability or unwilling
ness to help them, particularly in view of the British interpretation placed upon
the treaty of1814, by which Britain undertook to give aid ifa European power
attacked. As part of the price of peace, the Russian indemnity was some
£3,500,000, which Iran could not afford. The British envoy, Colonel (later Sir)
John Kinneir Macdonald, agreed topay £250,000 inexchange for the abroga
tion of the entangling articles in the Treaty of Tehran of 1814. Thus Britain
bought her way out ofher obligations ata time when Iran was too helpless to
protest. As Jones put it, Iran was "delivered, bound hand and foot, to the Court
of St. Petersburgh".50
Prince Menshikov, visiting Tehran in 1826, had urged the Iranians to shift
their war aims from the Caucasus to Khurasan. This advice coincided with Iran's
ambition to re-establish her frontiers as they had existed under the Safavids and
Nadir Shah, but a severe outbreak of cholera followed byfamine postponed
serious military operations. InJune 1830, Sir John Macdonald died at Tehran.
Within an hour, Major Isaac Hart, serving since Christie's death with the army
of the heir-apparent, cAbbas Mirza, also died. Captain (later Sir John) Campbell
did nothave the standing of his predecessor at Tehran. Nor did the young
officer who succeeded Hart have the latter's influence over military affairs. In
1831—2 Abbas Mirza successfully subdued several of the autonomous tribal
chiefs inKhurasan and enlarged the area over which Iran exercised authority.
The prize he aimed for was Herat. While British advice deterred him from
moving against Khiva in 1831, and postponed his move onHerat in 1832, his
son Muhammad Mirza was leading an expedition against Herat when newsof
his father's death at Mashhad (25 October 1833) forced him to return.
In 1834 Fath All Shah died at Isfahan, aged eighty, in the thirty-seventh year
of his reign. This raised the question ofthe succession. cAbbas Mirza's eldest
son, Muhammad Mirza, had been named asheir apparent onthe death ofhis
father the previous year. However, two of Fath cAli Shah's sons also coveted the
throne. For thirty-eight days one contender, All Shah Zill al-Sultan, claimed
Tehran, while the other, Husain A.1I Farman-Farma, governor ofFars, began
the march north towards the capital. Sir John Campbell gave strong diplomatic
support to Muhammad Mirza. Palmerston had extensive exchanges with St.

Petersburg. Britain also provided military and financial assistance, enabling
Muhammad Shah to enter Tehran with an armed force ledby Sir Henry
Lindesay-Bethune, who later defeated Farman-Farma's army near Isfahan. A
protracted succession struggle wasthereby avoided. Thenew Shah owed much
to British support, but this was not enough to ensure good relations.
Muhammad Shah's ambition to recover thelands lost in theeast was too strong.
This ambition, especially over Herat, brought him into direct conflict with
British interests.51
Canning haddied in 1827. Thedisastrous course of the second Irano-Russian
War and the terms ofthe Treaty ofTurkmanchai shocked the British into a
reconsideration of policy, while British observers on the spot repeatedly sent
home forecasts of further Russian interference. In particular, the significance of
Russian expansion east and southeast of the Caspian prompted dire warnings.
From Astarabad to Mashhad itwasonly a twelve-day journey through country
well-supplied with forage and water. Caravans going from Mashhad to Herat
had a choice oftwo routes, taking fifteen days each through easily-traversed
territory. Russian missions had gone to Khiva and to Bukhara. Willock wanted
to send John McNeill to Khurasan to gather information about the region from
Astarabad to the Indian borderlands. In his opinion, the extension of Russian
influence posed amore formidable threat to India than had the French in 1807,
"to counteract which we took such vigorous precautions".52 Henry Ellis also
pressed fordoing more in Iran. While Britain's relations with Iran were a
secondary interest in terms of European politics, they were of primary impor
tance in Asia.53
Two tangible measures now indicated a stronger British line. In 1833, a
regular British detachment reinforced those British officers still serving in Iran.
Later, Sir Henry Lindesay-Bethune joined them with special instructions from
Palmerston and with an officer and eight NCOs under his command, who were
to develop a rifle corps, forwhich arms and ammunition were provided.
Bethune also had authority to engage adirector and artisans for the establish
ment of a cannon foundry. The British government met these expenses partly
out of the secret service vote.54 Palmerston encouraged further exploration of
routes and territories.55

RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN AND BRITISH INDIA
In 183 5, itwas decided to transfer the Iranian mission back to the control of
the Foreign Office, although the newminister to Tehran received his credentials
both from the King and the Governor-General in India.56 Harford Jones had
long advocated this change. He observed that Iran had been flattered when her
friendship had been considered valuable, but neglected when circumstances
changed. He considered that both Britain's position in Iran and Iran's own
political position had changed for the worse since 1811. Improvement required
Iran tobe paid the "proper compliment ofa Minister directly accredited &
directly proceeding from the Throne of England to the Throne of Tehran". His
recommendation regarding thelanguage to be used in conversation with
Russian representatives was repeated in the instructions to British representa
tives appointed to Iran in later years, for example the instructions toWolff in
1888:
The Integrity and Independence of the present dominions of Persia is a matter of such consequence, that noattempt to violate them canbetamely permitted - wetherefore feel
ourselves called on to afford Persia all means of increasing her internal Strength . . .57
Sir John Campbell had also tried to persuade the government to improve its
relations with Iran. He was alarmed byRussia's increasing strength, Iran's
weakness, and the decline ofBritish influence.58 Henry Ellis recommended a
special embassy to Tehran toinitiate the change in the Iranian mission and
negotiate new political and commercial treaties.59 Instructions were drawn up
for the special ambassador, who would congratulate the new ruler, Muhammad
Shah, on his accession (1834). King William IV minuted: "Appd. But The King
is of Opinion that the Commercial Arrangements should be pressed. H.M. is
decidedly convinced that the East India Company ought to pay the Expence of
Maintaining the British Officers and Non Commissioned Officers in the Empire
of Persia." Palmerston opposed an ostentatious embassy toTehran, but sent
Ellis out on a special mission in advance of the newminister, Sir John McNeill.60
Ellis reported pessimistically. The Shah would persevere over Herat. Russia
was encouraging himandpromising assistance.61 Pessimism wasnot diminished

Abbas-i Erivani, also known as Hajji Mirza Aghasi) as "shrewd, cunning,
unprincipled", and undoubtedly "inRussian pay". The Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Mirza Mascud, described as clever, was also "aPensioner of Russia".62
In spite of Palmerston's interest in repairing, if possible, Anglo-Iranian
relations, he was beginning tolook toAfghanistan instead ofIran as the main
bulwark for the defence of India. In 1832 Willock had warned in a memorandum
that Russian probing east of the Caspian Sea must reduce Iran's effectiveness as a
barrier toRussia's advance towards India. Once he accepted this assessment of
the situation, Palmerston was bound to recognize that the best ground on wrhich
to defend India from invasion was territory in closer proximity toBritish India.
As aresult, the focus of British interest naturally moved eastwards from Iran to
Afghanistan.
In the summer of183 7 the Shah advanced against Herat. The siege of the city,
in which the British officer, Eldred Pottinger, played a notable part in its
defence, began in November. A year later, British-Indian forces moved into
Afghanistan, and in 1839 the Russians marched against Khiva. None of these
three enterprises was tomeet with success. The Russian expedition was almost
totally annihilated, severe cold forcing the remnant toturn back while stillfar
from Khiva. The British invasion of Afghanistan ended in the disastrous retreat
of 1842. The Shah, in his advance on Herat, had been actively encouraged by the
Russians and trusted totheir promises ofmoney and material support. Buthe
found that their assistance did not materialize in sufficient quantity in his hour of
need. After several months of investment, Herat still held out and the besiegers
were suffering badly. Then, in order to reduce the pressure on the besieged,
British military and naval contingents occupied Kharg in June 183 8. InSeptem
ber, the Shah abandoned the siege and returned to Tehran.
The forceful British response to the Shah's move against Herat resulted from
Palmerston's conviction that an advance by the Iranians into Afghanistan would
mean the establishment of the Russians there too, and this would pose a threat to
India. Already in May 1838, Palmerston had ensured that the Shah should be
informed that Iran's move into Afghanistan was seen as a hostile actwhich
terminated Anglo-Iranian friendly relations. Palmerston also wished the Shah to
be discouraged from any military activity, including subduing Turkmen tribes,
on Iran's northeastern borders and inthe neighbourhood ofAfghanistan. For
Palmerston intended to rely on an Afghan State, or if necessary two, one centred
on Kabul and Qandahar, the other on Herat, that asanIndian protectorate, a

"regular outwork of India", would for the future constitute British India's main
barrier against Russia. Afghanistan might, therefore, be reckoned British In
dia's answer toRussia's Persia, Afghanistan being drawn into British India's
orbital influence, as theRussians were attempting to attract Iran into theirs. This
line of thinking, however, wasquickly overtaken by thecourse of events, forthe
British disaster at Kabul and its repercussions, and the change of government at
Westminster, meant the abandonment of what would later come to be known as
"forward" policies. As for the aftermath of the Herat affair, by January 1839
Palmerston had come to realize that the Shah's retreat from Herat stemmed less
from British demands than from internal difficulties. The Shah would renew his
attempt to take the city when he could, and meanwhile would use intrigue and
diplomacy, asopportunity allowed. Not until October 1841 were the issues
between Great Britain and Iran smoothed over, and diplomatic relations
resumed. The British occupation of Kharg continued until March 1842.Then,
in spite ofpressure from India toretain it,British forces on the island were
withdrawn as part of a general settlement with the Shah's government. Only a
coal-depot remained thereafter, supervised by aBritish officer, but that too was
evacuated in 1844.
In 1842the Russians occupied the island of Ashurada, near Astarabad, and
erected buildings on it. In the years before the Crimean War (1854-6), Russian
probing andpenetration of the Caspian area had continued, but had met Iranian
opposition, which hadsome British support. At thesame time, Russia continued
to encourage Iranian ambitions to the east.63 After several threatening moves,
the Iranians captured Herat in October 1856. War between Britain and Iran
immediately followed. Relations had deteriorated earlier, during the Crimean
War. A disagreeable affair involving theBritish minister, Charles Murray, added
complications. Murray withdrew the mission from Tehran late in 185 5.64
Britain did not declare war against Iran until Herat's capture. This Irano
British war of 185 6—7 did not have full cabinet support in England, and was not
viewed enthusiastically in India where many believed in the principles of

established positions at Bushire and Kharg, and prepared for penetration inland.
The British advanced uptheriver Karun as far as Ahvaz, and engaged the
Iranian army at Khushab in February 1857, and at Muhammara (Khurramshahr)
in March, but peace terms were arranged before a sustained campaign into the
interior took place. The terms were lenient. Britain neither sought territory nor
asked foran indemnity. This to some extent reflected the opposition led by
Gladstone, party divisions within England, and the distaste with which military
adventures of any type, however successful, were then regarded. The Times, ina
leading article entitled "Where Herat is, we neither know or care", mirrored the
views of many people in England who were unfamiliar with the issues involved
and saw noreason forwar with Iran. Palmerston barely avoided a full scale
debate in Parliament, which would have exposed thedeep divisions within
England and weakened Britain's negotiating position. Hetherefore quickly
settled the essentials: Iran was towithdraw from Herat; Britain could appoint
consuls ather discretion inIran; and the slave-trade convention of 1851 wasto
be renewed.65
After the Sepoy Mutiny of185 7, the India Act of185 8 transferred the powers
formerly vested in the East India Company to the British Crown. From
November 1858 until December 1859 t n e administration of the legation in
Tehran was transferred from theForeign Office to theIndia Office. Lord
Stanley, as Secretary of State for India, in hissearch for a replacement for
Murray, offered the Tehran post toSir Henry Rawlinson, an authority on Iran,
who argued that Persian and Afghan affairs, asthey related toIndian defence,
"must be organised inIndia and executed from India". He, contrary to the
traditional view, believed that Herat under Persian control served British
interests. The instructions drawn up for Rawlinson gave evidence of renewed
interest in Iran and of a stronger policy in Central Asia.
On his arrival in Tehran, in 1859, Rawlinson received agrand welcome from
Nasir al-DIn Shah, but hopes of an active and co-operative policy quickly faded,
for on 8 January 1860 Rawlinson received the news that the Iranian mission was
again being transferred to the Foreign Office. At the time of his departure from
England he had left a letter of resignation which was to take effect immediately if
such achange occurred. Rawlinson therefore left Tehran in May 1860, muchto
the Shah's displeasure. His successor, Charles Alison, remained in Tehran until
he died in 1872. He came in for much obloquy, but itis perhaps ameasure of the

importance Great Britain by that time attached to Iranian affairs that he was not
replaced.66
In February 1858 Lord Derby formed his second cabinet, which lasted until
June 1859, a n d stronger lines of policy were formulated for the Indian border
lands. Reports ofthe "ceaseless endeavours" ofRussian agents toextend their
influence through Central Asia seemed to call into question thepolicy of
continued passivity. The activities of one of the Russian agents, N.V. Khanikov,
were particularly alarming. Inthe autumn of 1858 Khanikov arrived at Herat
with a large diplomatic suite. He spent money lavishly and undertook surveys
into Sistan. He asked Dost Muhammad atKabul toreceive him there, but was
refused; inHerat, however, he was an unqualified success. He promised a loan
and negotiated a Russo-Herati treaty, to be approved by Iran during the
forthcoming visit to Tehran of Sultan Ahmad Khan, the ruler of Herat. The
treaty provided for closer trade-relations and for a permanent Russian agencyat
Herat. TheRussian minister at Tehran, Count Anichkov, courted Sultan
Ahmad Khan assiduously. Rawlinson too had several conversations with Sultan
Ahmad Khan while the latter was in Tehran, and persuaded him toreject the
treaty, thereby apparently regaining lost ground for Britain. Sultan Ahmad
Khan professed friendship with Rawlinson and offered tosubmit the affairs of
Herat tothe Government of India for advice, adding that he would welcome a
British agent at Herat.
In June 1859 a change of government in Britain ushered in a radically
different policy. Sir Charles Wood succeeded Stanley inthe India Office, with
Thomas Baring (later Earl ofNorthbrook) asUnder-Secretary. It was agreed
that no agent would reside in Afghanistan: he might be murdered and thus bring
on another Afghan war. Military expenditures were to be cut and activities in the
Indian borderlands were to be curtailed. Arguments in favour of "masterly
inactivity" again prevailed. Rawlinson was accordingly instructed that aBritish
officer might visit but not remain at Herat. Sir Lewis Pelly went to Heratfor
three weeks in October 1860. He endeavoured to ascertain how the Heratis felt
towards Iran and how much remained ofthe impact ofKhanikov's diplomatic
efforts. Pelly thought that the Iranian alliance would endure "only until better
prospects should appear. Like most strict Afghan Sunnees, Sultan Ahmad Khan
entertains in his heart a contemptuous hatred forthe Persian Sheeah". More

over, the ruler's visit to Tehran had given him an insight into Iranian politics, so
that he no longer counted on theShah for "solid strength and permanent
support".
Sistan, like Herat, was claimed by both Iran and Afghanistan. Muhammad
Shah had intended not only to recover Herat but also Sistan as far as Ghazni. His
son and successor, Nasir al-DIn Shah, pursued the same objectives. We have
seen how his attempts against Herat failed and led to war with Great Britain, but
he was more fortunate in the southeast. In the ten years following the Irano
British war the Shah advanced his frontiers south of Sistan eastward through
nearly five degrees oflongitude. The frontier met the sea on the Makran coast
between Gwadar and Chahbahar. It should, moreover, be remembered that
from thedeath of Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1773 the Iranians had gradually
regained territory in Afghanistan which they had formerly possessed, so that in
the 1860s the Afghans complained tothe British in India about these encroach
ments. By article six ofthe treaty of 1857 Iran undertook not toresort toarms
but tosubmit territorial disputes with Afghanistan toBritain for adjudication.
Iran claimed sovereignty over all ofSistan, arguing that abantiqua ithad formed
part of herempire. Iran hadalso protested bitterly to Britain when Dost
Muhammad, theBarakzai ruler of Kabul, hadincorporated Herat into his
Amirate in 1863 after a siege which had lasted forten months. The Foreign
Secretary, Lord Russell, responded that Iran and Afghanistan should settle their
frontier disputes between themselves, byforce of arms if necessary.67
By the 1860s Britain's policy inIran and also inrespect ofAfghanistan was
being determined, not so much by those two countries' potential role as agents
of Russia as by Russia's own presence, encroaching ever nearer toIndia as she
expanded across Asia. In 1844, after the disastrous attempt against Khiva in
1839, Russia came toanagreement with Britain whereby she pledged to leave
the Central Asian khanates "as aneutral zone between the two empires inorder
to preserve them from dangerous contact". This gave the khanates a respite,
although in the late 1840s Russia built forts in the steppe south of Orenburg and
on the Aral Sea. Inthe early 185 os two lines of advance began from Orenburg
and Semipalatinsk, a process which was accelerated after the Crimean War. In
67 The correspondence on this is voluminous. See, for example, L/P&S/18, A and C memoranda; Council of India memoranda, C141 and 142; L/P&S/9/3 and L/P&S/3/64. The appropriate Foreign Office volumes are full and rewarding. Khanikov who spent 27 years in Central Asia published some of his findings. His book was translated from the French as Memoiron theSouthern Part of Central Asia. Khanikov's work was widely quoted. See, for example, Sir F.J. Goldsmid, Eastern Persia 1, p. 11.

1859-60, Russia penetrated Khokand. The taking of Chimkent in 1864 closed
off the Kazakh steppe bya line of forts. In 1866 Tashkent and Khojand were
annexed, andinroads against the Amirate of Bukhara gained momentum.
Russia's advance towards this last city prompted a comprehensive British
review of the whole Central Asian question in 1868—9. Rawlinson's minute of 20
July 1868 elicited other evaluations, including a critical analysis by Lord
Lawrence, who hadbecome Governor-General of India in 1864 andwas a
powerful advocate of "masterly inactivity" on the northwest frontier.
Rawlinson's recommendations included taking steps for reviving the strong
British policy which hadprevailed in Tehran in theearly years of the 19th
century. Supplying officers forthe Iranian army had been part of this policy.
The vast expenditure that we incurred inthe days of Harford Jones and Malcolm,in expelling the French from Tehran, is no longer required. What is required is an indication of renewed interest in thecountry, and a disposition to protect it against Russian pressure. Our Officers should be again placed inpositions ofinfluence and power with the Persian troops, as in the days of Christie, of Lindsay, and of Hart. Presents of improved arms, andperhaps artillery, would testify to ourawakened interest. The Persian nobles should be encouraged to send their sons for education to London, rather than to Paris. Investments of English capital in banks, in railways, in mining operations, and other commercial enterprises are freely proffered, and if supported by our authorities would create a further bond ofunion between the countries.
After British officers had been compelled to leave Iran in 1838 because ofthe
Shah's move on Herat, officers ofother nations — France, Austria, and Italy
had been tried. When Rawlinson had represented Great Britain at Tehran in
1860, the Shah had asked him for forty British officers and for £ 100,000 annually
for their expenses. Rawlinson had supported this request, but had been over
ruled. However, the question of British officers for Iran frequently recurred and
Rawlinson revived it again in 1868. Despite the objections of Lord Lawrence,
who wasViceroy of India until 1869, t o a vigorous policy in Iran, and
specifically to the stationing of British officers there, the measure attracted
substantial support, but it was temporarily buried in 1872 in interdepartmental
correspondence.68
In 1868 the Shah had also proposed that the British furnish Iran with steam
driven warships to protect its commerce in the Gulf and to enforce his authority
along the coast. The project collapsed when the Admiralty objected and the

RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN AND BRITISH INDIA
Government of India feared that such ships might be used to recover Bahrain.
British interests in the Persian Gulf, which included curtailing the slave trade
and piracy, had led the British to make aseries of treaties with the independent
rulers around the coasts. These dated from 1819-20 and were revised and
extended asneeded throughout the 19thandearly 20th centuries. Great Britain's
direct relations with Bahrain went back to 1805, and although Iran had historic
claims tothe island, the British government rejected these claims nine times,
beginning in 1822. Italso rejected Turkish claims nineteen times, beginning in
1839. Nevertheless, theSecretary of State for India, the Duke of Argyll,
described as "unreasonable" the traditional British policy of opposingthe
extension of Iranian authority in the Gulf, which, he supposed, would be better
than "alot ofpetty and barbarous tribes".69
When Lord Mayo became Governor-General of India in 1869 he changed the
course of the Indian government's relations towards Afghanistan, Iran, andthe
Gulf. He thought that Central Asia was bound tofall toRussia one day but,
unlike Argyll, he favoured missions by Douglas Forsyth and others into Central
Asia in order to delay the inevitable. This meant increased activity inthe
borderlands. By then, Russia had conquered Samarqand (1868) and had forced
Bukhara into tributary status: a Russian road connected Tashkent and
Samarqand, and Russian steamships carried on alively traffic, especially on the
Amu-Darya. Khokand's forces had been defeated. An advance against Khiva
had been delayed only because the financial departments refused the funds.In
the great row between the rouble and the sword the latter prevailed despite
Count Shuvalov's special mission in January 1873 t o London to assure the
British: "Not only is itfar from the intention of the Emperor to take possession
of Khiva, butpositive orders have been prepared to prevent it". Khiva
capitulated in June 18 73, asLord Mayo hadanticipated twoyears earlier. Central
Asia in his time was certainly "inflammable", and the end of Russian expansion
was not yet in sight. Lord Mayo thought that Charjuy would go, and so would
Marv, although the latter would prove costly. Marv inRussian hands would
directly threaten India.70

RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN AND BRITISH INDIA
Annexation of Khiva brought Russia into contact with the Tiirkmens. After
1873 Russia began to advance against the various Turkmen tribes east of the
Caspian, and this had serious implications forIran. Established as a Caspian
power in the first half of the 19th century, Russia now consolidated and
expanded her territory inthat region. In 1869 Krasnovodsk had been taken for
the purpose of opening aroute to Khiva and Turkistan. In 1872 Russian forces
invaded Akhal and followed this by an attack on the Yamut Tiirkmens across
the River Atrak in 1873. These actions and other reconnaissance probes raised
the question of the extent of Iranian authority in the northeast.
Alarmed by this Russian drive, a group ofIranians came tobelieve that the
country faced grave danger and that its salvation demanded thoroughgoing
reform and closer association with Great Britain. These Iranians included Mirza
Husain Khan Mushir al-Daula (1828-81); Mirza Malkum Khan (1833-1908);
and Mirza All Asghar Khan Amin al-Sultan (18 54—1907). They endeavoured to
turn theEuropean threat into a source of strength. Their efforts for basic
changes in thestructure and methods of government were accompanied by
enthusiasm for western institutions like banks, roads, andrailways.71The
construction ofa network oftelegraph lines in the 1860s vitally affected Iran,
both in bringing about closer contact with Europe and in strengtheningthe
authority of the central government within the country itself. But above all, the
railway symbolized the West. InJuly 1872 the Iranian government granted the
famous Reuter concession.
Earlier, theIndo-European Telegraph Company, a British concern,had
obtained a concession forthe construction of a line from Khanaqin through
Tehran, Isfahan, andShlraz, to connect at Bushire with the Persian Gulf
submarine-cable, which joined theTurkish and Indian telegraph lines. The
Reuter concession, likewise a British concern, was much more far-reaching,
including extensive rights over Iran's natural resources aswell asthe right to
build a railway from the Gulf to the Caspian and any branch lines considered
practicable. It represented anattempt byIranian reformers to involve Euro
peans directly in the country's internal development on a massive scale. Arguing
that ifGreat Britain had a stake inthe country she would protect it, Mushir al
Daula, then vazir, had persuaded Nasir al-DIn Shah to take this step. The
Persian minister inLondon later explained the motives toLord Tenterden.

When the Reuter Concession was granted it was owing to the influence of the Grand Vizier & himself who saw it inaway of saving Persia from theoverwhelming influence of Russia. They supposed that by giving these great advantages to aBritish Subject they were rescuing them from thegrasp of Russia. They hadbelieved that theEnglish Foreign Office wd. be ready to support and protect this scheme; but they had found themselves mistaken. Where they looked for sympathy they had only metwith coldness & indifference. On the other hand from the very first Russia had striven her utmost to break the Concession and toget it transferred toRussian hands.72
The reform party also thought that avisit to Europe by the Shah would have
a good effect both inimpressing Nasir al-Din with western accomplishments
and in persuading Europeans of Iran's seriousness about reform. The Shah,in
the course of his first European tour in 1873(to be repeated in 1878and 1889),
found the Russians angered by the Reuter concession, which wasalso criticized
in England because ofits sweeping provisions. He cancelled the concession
soon after his return home. For many years Baron Julius de Reuter negotiated
for compensation, which was finally arranged byhis son in 1889. The first
spectacular attempt to bind Iran and Britain closer had failed.
After the capitulation ofKhiva (1873), t n eShah, inan autograph letter in
August 1874, asked for moral and material support from Great Britain, and help
in preventing Russia from acquiring thedistrict of Marv. TheIranian minister in
London, Malkum Khan, argued that without British guidance and assistance
Iran must belost. In Tehran, Ronald Thomson recommended that British
officers be sent to Iran to reorganize the army. The long minutes written bythe
Viceroy's Council show that the policy of "masterly inactivity" still prevailed in
India, even though the importance ofIran toIndia inthe new circumstances
created by Russia's changed position in Central Asia was recognized.73
In the 1870s both Iran and Afghanistan figured more prominently in British
calculations. Lord Mayo's reception of Shir CA1I at Ambala in 1869 was a
recognition of the Amir's success in having put the pieces of his kingdom
together again. It also signalled a departure from the policy of "masterly
inactivity", and made both Lord Lawrence and the Russians nervous. There
were two problems. The Amir wanted a territorial guarantee, althoughhis
northern territories were ill-defined and the Russians were already making
inroads. Secondly, ayear had hardly gone by before he wasagain facing serious

disaffection at home. Lord Mayo could do little to help. Shir All would certainly
not retain any degree of popular support if he turned for assistance to the British.
Although Lord Mayo could not provide all that Shir All wanted, he took great
satisfaction from a renewed association with the Amir. Lord Mayo's efforts were
cut short early in 1871, however, when aPathan convict assassinated him, while
he was inspecting the Port Blair penal colony. His replacement, Lord
Northbrook, followed the Lawrence tradition of frontier policy.74
The turning-point inBritish relations with Afghanistan came in 1873. Shir
All was displeased with the British arbitration decision over Slstan which,he
thought, favoured Iran. Hesorely resented Britain's refusal to recognizehis
favourite son, Abd-Allah Jan, as his heir. Finally, he was offended because the
Viceroy would not give him a direct promise of aid against Russia. All this made
him receptive to overtures by General K.P. von Kaufmann, Governor-General
of Turkistan (1867-82), who had carried on acorrespondence with Shir AH for
nearly ten years, directly contrary toRussian undertakings.75 These exchanges
came to fruition in theRusso-Afghan treaty of 1879 anc^ t^iereception of a
Russian mission at Kabul. Shir All refused to give permission for a British agent
to reside at Herat and, later, would not receive a British mission at Kabul. British
forces again entered Afghanistan in November 1878.
As suggested above, the outcome of the Slstan arbitration had figured largely
in theAmir's dissatisfaction with theBritish. Shir All had appealed to the
Government of India for assistance in forcing Iran's withdrawal from the
territories occupied during his years of troubles. TheShah's government
maintained that allSlstan had always been a part ofIran. In 1870 both rulers
agreed to British arbitration and Major-General Sir Frederic Goldsmid, who
had recently surveyed the Makran coast for a telegraph line, as well as the Iranian
frontier with Khalat, was sent out to investigate the situation. His award of1872
gave Slstan to Iran, but not the lands onthe right bank of the Helmand.
Sistan's importance to Britain increased as Russia continued to advance
across Central Asia and as Afghanistan seemed tobecome aless reliable barrier
for India's defence. Charles Christie had crossed Slstan in 1810 onhis way to
Herat, butit was notuntil thesecond half of the 19th century that British
concern became serious about the ease with which a hostile force might use
Slstan as abase from which to threaten India through one of the more accessible

of the western passes, the Bolan. When Lord Salisbury became Secretary of State
for India in 1874, one of his reasons for urging the Viceroy, Lord Northbrook,
to have an agent at Herat or Qandahar, or both, was thelack of reliable
information about Afghanistan and Iran. By 1879, Lord Salisbury (now Foreign
Secretary) hadevolved a policy which emphasized Iran instead of Afghanistan as
the main outwork of Indian defence, since existing circumstances in Afghani
stan seemed topreclude that country being either strong orfriendly towards
Great Britain in the foreseeable future. The terms, to which Lord Salisbury
obtained the Cabinet's and the Government ofIndia's consent, provided that
Nasir al-Din Shah would acquire Herat and more of Sistan, and receive a
subsidy. The Shah would allow British officers tobe resident inHerat, would
not object to arailway from Qandahar to Herat, would resist Russian encroach
ments, would co-operate in improving transportation from the Gulf inland, and
would undertake measures for internal reform.76 In India, Sir Alfred Lyall told
Lord Roberts: "Herat affairs are drawing swiftly to acrisis. I think the place will
go to her western neighbour, and will be lost to Afghanistan henceforward."77
Lord Beaconsfield's summary to Queen Victoria has interesting insights into
the government's thinking at anearly stage in the negotiations.
Lord Lytton would like to fall back onthe Treaty of Gundamak, but feels that is impossible: he, therefore, contemplates agroup ofquasi-independent chieftains underthe influence and protection of the Imperial Crown of India, but combining this, for some time, with adequate military occupation of the Country by Yr. Majesty's forces. Ifthis were effected, & Candahar, for example, in possession of Yr. Majesty's army, & intwo years time connected by a rail-way with Herat, Ld.Lytton would not be unwilling to see the Shah of Persia, Lord of Herat on the same terms as the chiefs of Candahar, Caubul, Ghusnee, etc. Such arrangements cannot be made off hand. Lord Salisbury, on theother hand, thonotdisapproving of this general policy, wishes to close with Persia atonce, for the fear, that Russia will forestall us. [. . .] Lord Salisbury proposes, in hiscontemplated Convention, many engagements on the part of Persia, wh.wd.practically make the Shah Yr. Majesty's feudatory: not as Shah of Persia, but as Shah ofHerat, as inthe case ofthe King ofthe Netherlands, who is a feudatory, it isbelieved, as G.-Duke ofLuxembourg. Your Majesty justly enquires what guarantees have we, that the Shah will observe these conditions - The same guarantees that made him observe the treaty of Paris for thirty years, &, in addition, theincreased guarantee arising from hisincreased proximity to Yr. Majesty's Empire, & its military resources, while the Persian Gulf is at all times, open toYr. Majesty's fleet.78

RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN AND BRITISH INDIA
Lord Salisbury's negotiations were well advanced when the Shah suspended
them in 1880. This action was widely attributed to Russian pressure. The
substance of the proposals had been published by a Saint Petersburg correspon
dent. Writing some years later, Salisbury recalled:
As regards the negotiations for the occupation ofHerat by Persia a reference tothe correspondence which took place over the subject in 1880 will sufficiently show that it was not tothe action ofHer Majesty's Government that the failure ofthe negotiations was due. Itwas the Persian Government who suddenly changed their attitude for some unexplained reason, which there was every reason to attribute to secret communication with Russia.79
Nasir al-DIn Shah's attempts torevive the discussions about the agreement
came after the Liberals had returned to power, and met with a cold response.
The opportunity fora close relationship with Britain ofthe kind envisaged in
Lord Salisbury's scheme of 1879 never returned. Russian pressure intensified
and under agreements made in 1881 the Shah relinquished claims to consider
able territory in adjusting his Khurasan boundary with Russia. Unaware of these
concessions, the Government ofIndia in 1882 agreed togrant a subsidy of five
lakhs of rupees a year fora limited period to enable the Shah to reinforce his
authority in the area south of Marv between Baba Dormuz and Sarakhs,but
neither this nor Foreign Office efforts could be effective since Nasir al-DIn Shah
had already acquiesced in Russia's continued advance eastwards from the
Caspian.
A Turkmen victory over the Russians in 1879 atGeok-Teppe brought about
a decision at the highest levels in the Russian government to crush them. Revolts
might otherwise break out throughout Central Asia. General Skobelev, who
took charge of the campaign, slaughtered the Tiirkmens at Geok-Teppe in 1881.
Russia annexed the Akhal Turkmen country inMay. The submission of Marv
followed in 1884.
This led toastrong reaction inBritish India. First, the decision toextend the
railway to Quetta was taken. Secondly, there was renewed interest in Iran.
Finally, there was undertaken the joint delineation bythe British and Russian
governments ofAfghanistan's northwestern boundary. But while the Liberal
government inEngland saw the danger inRussian advances which had turned
Afghanistan's flank, itseemed more preoccupied with ensuring that the frontier
policies ofLord Roberts did not prevail.80 Both Russian and British authorities

agreed that the former's advances from the Caspian had grave implications for
British India. The construction of the Trans-Caspian railway in the 1880s
reinforced Russia's position. It ran close to Iran's northeastern border for almost
three hundred miles. Numerous Russian proposals projected lines into Iran, to
Mashhad and to the Gulf.81
By 1885 British reports from Iran described, and MIrza Malkum Khan
confirmed, a discouraging trend of internal misgovernment and growing
Russian influence. The latter was reinforced by the Panjdeh incident of March
1885, when the provocative Russian annexation of the Panjdeh oasis north of
Herat very nearly led to war between Russia and Britain; but the latter gave way
and the demarcation of Afghanistan's northern frontier proceeded.82 The Shah
asked for a territorial guarantee. What he got was advice about improving his
administration and the routes between the Gulf and Tehran; but the British
minister in Tehran recommended going further and giving some limited
assurance to the Shah. An understanding, connected with earlier succession
questions and dating from 1834, already existed between Russia and Great
Britain pledging the two countries to maintain the "integrity and independence
of Persia", and it had been reaffirmed in 1838, and in later years.
In 1865,however, Great Britain had failed to obtain from Russia agreement
"to respect the independence of the Persian Monarchy, to abstain from en
croachments upon the territory of Persia, and to act in such a manner as might
best support and strengthen the Sovereignty of the Shah".83 In 1879 Malkum
Khan (the Shah's representative in London from 1872 to 1887) asked Lord
Salisbury if the Iranian government could count upon the moral support of
Great Britain if Russia attacked the northern provinces. Salisbury replied in
terms of "moral support" and strong protests, but said it would be misleading to
suggest that the Iranian government could "count on material assistance from
us; the distance of the scene of operations would make that exceedingly
difficult". Malkum Khan seemed to deprecate the idea of his expecting "material
assistance",84 but Britain's refusal and apparent inability to commit itself to such
assistance constituted one of the basic obstacles to effective Anglo-Iranian co

operation. The Shah naturally wanted a firm territorial guarantee, but until a
railway or at least good roads connected the Persian Gulf ports withthe
northern provinces Britain could provide no effective aid against Russian
pressure in the north. In 1888, when the Tsar visited the Caucasus, the Shah had
been particularly overawed by his northern neighbour's military might, and the
British minister in Tehran suggested that the appearance of one or two ships in
the Gulf might serve as a counterpoise todisplays ofRussian strength. Lord
Salisbury, however, ridiculed the idea: "For the purpose ofinfluencing the
destinies of Khorassan we might as well cruise in the White Sea as in the Persian
Gulf. "85
In consequence, the possibility of the involvement of other powers in Iranian
affairs was canvassed, notably in 1885 by both Thomson inTehran and Lord
Randolph Churchill at the India Office. Approaches to Bismarck were aimed at
securing his good offices as mediator in the crisis with Russia over the Afghan
dispute which had developed in connection with the Panjdeh incident of March
1885, and to associate Germany with Great Britain in Iran's commercial
development. On the former, more explosive issue, Germany said "the water is
too hot for us to put our finger in". The second and more specifically Iranian
issue stemmed from suggestions put forward by Baron Julius de Reuter. He still
hoped for ways to operate at least part of his concession and proposed to form an
international company, with the support of Bismarck and Lord Rothschild,to
build a railway and attract capital for other enterprises in Iran. In discussions at
the Foreign Office questions were raised about whether capital would be
available for Iran unless Germany and Great Britain gave some kind of territo
rial guarantee. Lord Salisbury encouraged association with Germany and said
that Great Britain would go asfar as Germany did, but Bismarck expressed
himself "unwilling toside for oragainst England orRussia on points where
their interests were opposed".86
In office from 1886 to 1892, Lord Salisbury endeavoured to reassert in a more
modest form the principles he had developed for Iran in 1879. The mainspring
of his policy was that Iran, noless than Afghanistan, formed an essential
outwork for India, and the implementation of that policy was tobe through
reform ina land which inthe 1890s was no shining example of progressive
achievement in government, administration, or technological advance. Not that
Salisbury considered the fundamental British position changed. As he explained

in a private letter to Lascelles, "What we have to do in Persia maybe summed up
in two sentences: wehave to make Persia as strong as wecan by internal
development to resist the supposed aggression: and we have to obtain for
ourselves the amount and kind of influence which will enable us when the crisis
comes to turn the efforts ofPersia into the right direction."87
The problem was,how could Great Britain help Iran? For more than twenty
years the Shah, Malkum Khan and others had been asking for advice and aid.
Advice was worthless unaccompanied by aid. In forbidding promises of ma
terial aid, Salisbury insisted: "we arereally powerless till there is railway
communication with the Coast".88
A more energetic British policy was signalled in 1888by the appointment, as
British Minister toTehran, ofSir Henry Drummond Wolff, who was consid
ered to have "great talent in Oriental diplomacy".89 Wolff's tour in Tehran was
not lacking in the devising of schemes. His observations on the internal state of
the country convinced him that Iran needed to improve the general living
conditions of her people as much asthe country needed to build roads and
establish banks. In this he was in agreement with many other observers, one of
whom reported in 1886 on what he saw as successive corruption and decayas
well as the violence of lawlessness and alack of security inimical to development
of resources, while "Rulers andMollahs" opposed outside influence and
techniques because these would cause their "downfall". Others gave a more
hopeful picture. General Robert Murdoch Smith, who had along acquaintance
with the country, wrote in 1887:
When we began our Telegraph work in 1863the prospects were most gloomy. Our unfortunate warwith Persia was still fresh in theminds of all. Wewere looked upon with distrust and suspicion, & welived in a constant state of friction. In thecourse of 24 years intercourse all this hashappily changed.

What the Telegraph has already done the railway will repeat &multiply [. . .] The Country is not so badly governed as people suppose. Life & property are as a rule wonderfully safe and the remarkable freedom of speech and behavior which prevails does not indicate that the people are cowed by oppression [. . .] The people are one of the finest races in the world, physically & intellectually. They are imbued with a strong sense of nationality, and through their art, literature & general culture exert an influence inthe East out of all proportion totheir military power.90
Wolff, supported bythe Shah's most powerful minister, Amin al-Sultan,
persuaded the Shah to issue a decree declaring his people secure in their lives and
property subject to theworking of the religious and civil laws. This was
designed to create an environment which would encourage enterprise and
strengthen Iran from within aswell asimprove the way it was viewed from
without. The proclamation was not enforced. Deterioration rather than advance
characterized the later years of Nasir al-DIn Shah's reign. Writing in 1895, ayear
before the Shah's assassination, the British military attache argued that emphasis
on development through encouragement of trade and improving communica
tions had been the wrong approach: effort should have been directed to the
administration since maladministration was the chief evil. He was convinced
that no good was possible without a reorganisation ofthe system of govern
ment. This diagnosis, whether accurate or not, did not go any way to furnishing
a remedy; reorganisation of the system of government was impossible withouta
degree of control comparable to that which the British exercized in the Indian
Native States. At no time didBritish policy-makers contemplate such an
extension ofresponsibility to Iran.91
Among Wolff's successes in 1888 and 1889 was the Shah's proclamation, in
October 1888, which opened the river Karun to the trade of all nations. Flowing
through Khuzistan, the Karun had special significance for British trade, and
facilitated entrance to the interior provinces. A project which Sir George
Chesney and other British officials had advocated years before was thus accom
plished. Early in 1889 George deReuter received permission to establish a
national bank as part settlement of his father's long-standing claims: the

Imperial Bank of Persia was to function until the early 1950s. Finally, in
December 1889, two important Orders in Council relating to consular jurisdic
tion in Iran and the Gulf were promulgated,92 but thereafter Wolff's effective
ness was gravely undermined, if not shattered, by the events of 1890— 1.
The Karun proclamation and the bank concession provoked an angry
Russian reaction. The key to internal change and a genuine community of
interest with Great Britain wasrailway construction. Iran had only two railway
lines. One, between Tehran and the shrine ofShah cAbd al-Azlm ran for six
miles andwasworked by a Belgian company. Theother extended for a few miles
from Amul in Mazandaran to the Caspian. Built by an Iranian merchant, it had
fallen into disrepair. Yetin spite of this virtual lack of any railway, in March 1889
the Shah gave in to Russian pressure and agreed not to allow any railway
construction for five years. In amore formal agreement in November 1890 the
Iranian Government undertook "neither itself to construct arailway in Persian
territory, norto permit nor grant aconcession for theconstruction of railways to
a Company or other persons". It waswidely believed that the railway agreement
also bound Iran to allow the passage of Russian troops through her territories
should hostilities break out between Russia and "any other Asiatic Power".93
The Shah's capitulation wasin the face of strong British efforts to persuade him
to retain his freedom of action, including theoffer of diplomatic support in Saint
Petersburg.94 Once Russia succeeded in obtaining the ban on railway construc
tion, Lord Salisbury became far less hopeful of schemes "for stiffening Persia",
and more inclined to look to the protection of British interests in the south.95
The Tobacco Concession granted toa British subject inMarch 1890had
further grave consequences. This concession has, in the Parliamentary debate
which itprovoked and in more recent historical writings, been represented as
capitalist exploitation of the weak. An examination of the documents does not
bear out this simple interpretation. The cancelling of the tobacco concession
undoubtedly represented a further triumph for Russian intrigue and a corre
sponding decline in British influence. Itturned the shrewd and powerful Amin
al-Sultan away from the British in favour of the Russians. It dangerously

undermined such authority as the Shah retained. Itgreatly increased the power
of the culama. The compensation which had to be found in 1892 for the
cancellation of the concession inaugurated Iran's national debt. Some have seen
the agitation connected with the tobacco concession as marking the beginning
of the manifestation ofpublic opinion inIran, and asthe forerunner of the
constitutional movement inthe early 20th century and ofthe recent Islamic
revolution.96
Early in the disturbances resulting from this concession Wolff's health broke
down and he wasforced to leave Iran. For the next decade Britain hadno strong
representative in Tehran. In 1892 Lord Salisbury's ministry ended, ushering ina
Liberal government opposed to anactive policy in Iran. Iranian conditions
worsened. When Lord Lansdowne, as Governor-General of India, pointed out
the critical state of affairs, Lord Kimberley's attitude was that "the Shah will
become a vassal of the Tsar in reality tho'not in name. I cannot seewhat we can
do to avert it."97 The reviews of conditions in Iran in 1892—3 and Durand's long
memorandum of 1895 vividly describe the internal disintegration, Russian
infiltration, and British impotence. The Shah's assassination in 1896 bequeathed
the throne to two undistinguished successors, Muzaffar al-Din Shah (1896
1907) and Muhammad CA1IShah (1907—9).98
Thus with the close ofthe 19th century, it seemed that Russia, although
frustrated inher persistent efforts to dominate the Porte, had won the long
contest for supremacy inTehran. In 1900 and again in 1902 Muzaffar al-DIn
Shah borrowed heavily from Russia, accepting dangerous political conditions,
including the prolongation ofthe ban on railway building. Muhammad CA1I
Shah had become a Russian tool while still heir-apparent and wasfinally forced,
after severe and prolonged civil strife, into exile inRussia in 1909. Northern
Iran, where new roads afforded the Russians improved mobility, seemed firmly
in Russian hands. The penetration of Sistan and the south began with Russian
anti-plague officials going into remote areas in pursuit of political rather than
medical objectives. In 1897 a Russian Consulate-General was established at
Isfahan. This was followed by a consulate atBasra in 1899 and, in 1901, by a
Consulate-General atBushire, with an escort of Russian Cossacks. Engineers

surveyed Iran forlines to connect the Trans-Caspian railway system with the
Gulf. Plague studies were also made in the Gulf region, anda subsidized
steamship line began to make regular voyages in the Gulf in 1901."
Looking back on along career at the Foreign Office, Lord Sanderson recalled
how, ". . . during the last 25 years Russia by persistent effort and considerable
expenditure hasvery greatly strengthened her hold over Northern Persia.
During allthat period we have steadily (and perhaps rightly) refused to make
any corresponding expenditure - and have played a losing game. I am accutely
sensible of the fact because I sat at the table without aCourt Card or trump in my
hand." He continued that when Lascelles was inTehran (in 1893), "his instruc
tions were that ifthe Russians got to Isfahan they were tobe stopped. He wrote
back toask howthey were tobe stopped. Lord Rosebery replied that he had sent
to the India Office tofind out what their policy was, but found that they had no
policy. He hoped Lascelles' Despatches might suggest one!" Inan earlier letter,
Sanderson had summarized the salient features inthe changing balance in Iran,
with its growing internal problems and its helplessness in face of the pressures of
its northern neighbour. Sanderson told Lord Curzon:
... for the last fifteen years we had been repeatedly warned by the Intelligence Dept. ofthe W.O. that the improvements made in railways and roads had rendered theRussian occupation of all Northern Persia a comparatively easy and inexpensive operation, instead ofbeing, as previously, alengthy, onerous costly undertaking partaking of the nature ofa mountain campaign [. ..] As regards railways . .. trains run regularly from Tiflis through Erivan to Julfa on the Aras, the boundary of Persia, from whence there is now agood road to Tabriz and on to Tehran. The line has certainly been made within the last few years and the I.D. were never tired of telling us of the network of railways converging through Voronez, KherkofT and Rostoff on Astrakhan, Petrovsk and Baku by which troops could be brought from all parts of Russia to Persia and Transcaspia. When Wolff went to Persia in 1887and Idrew up his instructions, there was,I believe a single carriage road in Persia from Tehran to Kum. Five years later the Persians under pressure from Russia made aroad from Askabad on the Trans-Caspian Ry. toMeshed. The road from Resht to Teheran was not really completed till about 1899and cost some £350,000 found by a Russian co. and guaranteed by the Russian Govt. After that we heard of improvements of the road between Teheran and Hamadan, and from Kasvinto Tabreez. Up tothe time ofWolff's arrival orperhaps a little later, the Persian revenues had

covered theexpenditure. When on thetopof recurring deficits thefailure of the Tobacco Regie made aloan necessary I had some long consultations with Sir A. Lyall, whosaid that an Oriental country which once began to borrow wasgenerally lost. Youof course recollect our struggles to bolster the Persian government up, Hicks Beach's insistence that anyfurther loan should bemade by Great Britain andRussia jointly, andthe manner in which Russia stepped inandguaranteed singly a Persian Loan of z\ millions. Since then the only chance ofa recovery seemed tolie inthe discovery ofpetroleum.100
Thus Britain had managed little more than to remain in the contest with
Russia. In an atmosphere of overwhelming Russian success, the Shah, as a
gesture, had granted to aBritish subject, William Knox D'Arcy, aconcession in
1901 giving extensive rights over petroleum, aconcession which at the time did
not seem to amount to very much. Reports on the mineral resources of Iran had
long been widely circulated. TheTimes; for example, on 10April 1890, published
a special article on themines of Iran in which thepetroleum of a certain district in
the southwrest was described as "perfectly colourless and exceptionally pure".
WolfT had been impressed by theprospects of the development of an oil
industry. The Persian Bank Mining Rights Corporation, associated with the
Imperial Bank, made some moves toestablish an oil industry, but the cost of
extraction and transport in that and other enterprises inhibited profitable
operations. The Mining Corporation went into voluntary liquidation, which
was finally completed in 1901.There was no compensation.
The French archaeologist, Jacques de Morgan, had observed oil seepages in
Iran. InFebruary 1892 he published an account ofthem which made D'Arcy
conclude that Iranian oil might be commercially profitable. D'Arcy, an English
man whohad made afortune from Australian gold, never went to Iran, but was
approached bySir Henry Drummond WolfT, Edouard Cotte (who had been
Baron Julius deReuter's secretary and who was related to deMorgan), and
Kitabgi Khan (whohad been Director-General of the Iranian customs), when it
became apparent that the Persian Bank Mining Rights Corporation could not
continue oilexploration. D'Arcy sent his representative, A.L. Marriott, to
Tehran in 1901 tonegotiate for the oil concession signed on 28 May 1901.101
Hardinge, then British Minister in Tehran, lent Marriott some support, but
only toa very minor degree. Inhis report on the granting ofthe concession,
Hardinge recalled many other schemes for the development of Iran put forward
near that time, but he thought that the wrecks ofthese hopeful undertakings
precluded further optimism, although hewasready to admit that, should Iranian

oil be developed to compete with that of Baku, itmight become really signifi
cant. At the time, however, oil negotiations seemed less important than such
matters as Iran's growing financial dependence on Russia and the considerations
leading to theRusso-Iranian commercial convention of 1903. Russia had
demanded and obtained some compensation for the D'Arcy concession. The
Novoe Vremya had carried aseries of articles pointing out disquieting aspects of
the concession: the exacerbation oflocal influences hostile to Russia which
would result from its being excessively opened to European enterprise, and the
increased uncertainty and risk of leaving Iran, "as ameal, so to speak, until the
time came when we [the Russians] had gathered sufficient strength and re
sources", effectively toenjoy it.102
An indication that the British did not intend this "meal" to be left for Russia
came in a Parliamentary debate in January 1902. Joseph Walton, who had
recently visited the country, initiated the first debate on Iran since that on the
Tobacco Concession ten years earlier (26 May 1892). Walton proposed that
"adequate measures should be taken for the safeguarding of the commercial and
political interests of the British Empire in Persia". This debate was significant
because it foreshadowed both the stronger British line in Iran then being
formulated and also the line which Sir Edward Grey was later totake.
Viscount Cranborne (later, 4th Marquis ofSalisbury), Under-Secretary of
State of Foreign Affairs, defined the government's policy. Important political
and commercial interests had been developed in Iran wThich would be protected.
As he put it, "it would be impossible for us, whatever the cause, to abandon what
we look upon as our rightful position in Persia. Especially is that true in regard
to the Persian Gulf." Grey, by contrast, passed over British interests, questioned
whether any other power was jealous of Britain's position there, and ridiculed
Curzon's attitude towards the concession of a Gulf port. He doubted that the
buffer-state principle could be applied in an Iran in process of disintegration and
nothing more than "a w^eak state propped up by two strong Powers". Instead of
dwelling onthe fiction of an independent Iran, the British should exercise
"unrelaxed efforts to come to an understanding with the Russian Government".
Britain should look attheir policy in Asia as awhole and settle questions with
Russia on the basis ofthat whole. They should find out what Russia really
wanted, and in the Hght of the whole, try to meet those demands.103 The Times in

its leading article the next day (23 January 1902), described Grey's remarksas
"cryptic and perplexing". Its editors were jubilant over the government's firm
declaration of policy. In India, Baron Hermann Speck von Sternburg, represent
ing the German government, wrote to his friend Theodore Roosevelt:
I seethat at last theBritish Government hasgiven expression to herpolicy as regards the Persian Gulf. ..Russia is bound to have herport there andto connect it with herTransCaspian system. This would mean afatal blow to India, as itwould isolate India from Minor Asia. Curzon is putting on all possible pressure to establish British supremacy in the Gulf & keep out the rest of the world there. Heis perfectly right in doing so,only1 don't see how hecanstop Russia byforce onheronward march through Persia... Well,I hope for the sake ofold England, that her great Asiatic problems will meet with a peaceful solution- Asthings stand now after Lord Cranborne's declaration of England's policy in the Persian Gulf, the attitude the leading Russian papers take in relation tothe same questions, andCurzon's statement that Russian occupation of a port in the Gulf or of Southern Persia would mean a warwhich would ring "from pole to pole", theways to a peaceful solution of the greatest question of the old world seem to be honeycombed by mines. - Then comes Germanies [sic] railroad tapping the Gulf.104
In August 1902 MuzafTar al-DIn Shah visited England. Hardinge tried to
please the Shah by avoiding factories, long speeches, operas, and naval reviews
which entailed setting foot onboard ship. Landsdowne paid him personal
attention, transacting amidst the festivities business in the form of full and frank
conversations with the Shah and his prime minister, but the whole trip was
soured by the Garter episode. Queen Victoria had bestowed the Order of the
Garter on Nasir al-DIn in 1873. His son and successor coveted it too,and would
accept no substitute. King Edward VII refused toconfer the distinction ona
Muslim and resented being told what decorations he should give. The Shah left
England "very unhappy" without the Garter, but amends were made by the
special mission to Iran of Viscount Downe, whoinvested MuzafTar al-DIn with
the Order inFebruary 1903, toarouse the jealousy of Constantinople and the
resentment of Japan.
The Shah's visit contributed to the revival ofBritish interest inIran. The
Times sponsored the long tour of Valentine Chirol through the country in
1902—3. His articles appeared in twenty instalments from October 1902to April
1903 and recall those written by Curzon more than ten years earlier. Chirol, like
Curzon, used his opportunity for observation as the basis for abook.105 Several

leading articles accompanied Chirol's special contributions. TheTimes (21 April
1903) supported Chirol's conclusions and declared that the time had cometo
stop mumbling old phrases about the status quoand the integrity of Iran. The
government must, before it was too late, "breathe into them a real life and
meaning".
Nevertheless, theyear 1903opened inauspiciously for theBritish in Iran. The
bestowing of the Garter early in February wasdesigned to bring the Shah closer
to Britain, but on the day of the ceremony inTehran an announcement from
Saint Petersburg made public the details of the revision of the Russo-Iranian
trade treaty. Hardinge had known that negotiations were in process in 1901 and
had hoped that theShah's visit to England would have an impact. The
announcement disclosed that the new commercial convention had been signed
at Tehran on 27October 1901, ratified shortly after, and would come into force
on 14 February 1903.
This newcommercial convention of 1903 shifted Iran's tariff from the 5 % ad
valorem basis, set up atTurkmanchai in 1828, to an elaborate system of specific
duties which promoted Russian trade in Iran to the detriment of Anglo-Indian
commerce. For example, piece goods which under the old system were charged
5% ad valorem•, were raised to9%. These goods came mainly from England.
There was also a 10% duty on tea, which came almost exclusively from India.
Iran's principal exports toEngland and India were wheat, barley, and sesame
seed, charged 13J, 25,and i o | % respectively. On the other hand, Russian sugar
was reduced to z\% and petrol (from Baku) to ii%.106
Spurred by this Russian trade victory, the Commercial Intelligence Commit
tee of the Board of Trade in London sponsored H.W. Maclean's investigation
into conditions and trade prospects in Iran. He made an extensive tour in Iran
and published a comprehensive and not altogether pessimistic report in 1904.107
Percy Sykes, the British Consul atKirman, complained that the southeastern
section of Iran had not received proper coverage. Curzon succeeded in interest
ing only the Upper India Chamber of Commerce, which sent A.H.Gleadowne
Newcomen on amission to Iran which was more of a private business venture
than agovernment-sponsored tour. The mission set out in 1904 and completed

its task in 1905. Gleadowne-Newcomen's report emphasised that "one of the
axioms adopted byRussia is the absolute identity oftrade and politics".108
The most decisive statement about British policy was Lord Lansdowne's
declaration in the House ofLords of 5 May 1903. He said:
we should regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace toBritish interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means atour disposal.
Lansdowne thought that economic development in the south should be encour
aged, and admitted that the consular service had been undermanned.109 The
Times (7 May 1903) "unreservedly congratulated" the government and called
Lansdowne's pronouncement "the Monroe Doctrine of the Persian Gulf".
Curzon was jubilant. It was what he had sought for years. InNovember and
December 1903 Curzon toured the Gulf, accompanied byHardinge. French
diplomats in Tehran perceived Hardinge as aman of a different calibre from his
predecessors. The struggle with Russia promised tobeinteresting to watch.
Hardinge obtained from the Government of India aforce of mounted guards,
mostly Sikhs, to act as an escort for the British minister as a counterweight to the
escorts of the Russian minister and consuls. Hardinge's most notable achieve
ment was to break the Russian loan monopoly in 1903. Along with this activity
in India and Iran went a thorough review, inLondon, ofBritish options and
interests, which largely owed its impetus toA.J. Balfour. But just as it gained
momentum Iranian policy was overshadowed byother developments.110
At the beginning of the 20th century far-reaching revisions were under way
in the formulation of British foreign policy, and in 1905 three widely separated
events changed the course of Iranian history besides altering the British position
in Iran. First, Japan's decisive defeat of Russia in the Pacific proved that one of
the two Powers which dominated Iran was not invulnerable, while it strength
ened the conviction in influential circles in Great Britain that Germany, not
Russia, was the power to fear. In Britain, aLiberal government came into office
at the end of 1905. The Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, worked for a
settlement with Russia. How farthe real drive came from Grey is open to

question, since strong evidence points toSir Charles Hardinge and Sir Arthur
Nicolson as thearchitects of Britain's Russo-Iranian policy before theFirst
World War. For Grey, Iran was more anirritant than a cornerstone of Indian
defence. Meanwhile, inIran itself national stirrings culminated in the Constitu
tional Movement which came to a head in 1905-6. The British minister, Sir Cecil
Spring Rice, wrote that the spirit ofpatriotism had come and seemed to have
come to stay. These developments, which promised to transform the country
into an effective buffer-state, the professed objective ofBritish policy through
out the 19th century, coincided with a radical transformation of British priorities
in general foreign policy, with particularly unfortunate consequences for Iran.
In Russia, the disasters of the Japanese war promoted drastic revisions of
policy, as the Boer War had done inEngland. The proceedings ofthe Russian
Special Council forPersian Affairs in 1906 stated that, "In Persia the aim had
been the striving towards an outlet to the Persian Gulf, which idea had included
that ofbuilding railways inthe south". While the main Russian interests lay in
the north, it had been envisaged that eventually Iran would become dependent
in its entirety on Russia. To accomplish this Russia had already spent 72 million
roubles in Iran. In the changed circumstances the traditional policy could not be
sustained. Therefore, the decision was taken to respond to British overtures for
an agreement over the Indian border territories, including Iran.111
Fear of Germany advanced Britain's determined efforts to reach an under
standing with Russia, and kept the understanding together through the stresses
which were put upon itin the years before the outbreak of the First World War.
After the promulgation of the Anglo-Russian Convention in 1907, relations
between Britain and Iran steadily deteriorated. According to aPersian proverb,
enemies are of three kinds: "enemies, the enemies of friends, and the friends of
enemies". To the Iranians, Russia was anenemy in the first category. Britain
joined her and became an enemy too, although, as a result of those revisionsin
British foreign policy already referred to, Iran had become a distinctly peripheral
concern for the British cabinet inLondon. Soon Britain was so eager to reach
agreement with Russia, that anearly draft of the Anglo-Russian Convention
document indicates Britain's readiness not to oppose the opening of the Darda
nelles to warships ofall classes. As early as 1903 Lord Selborne had apprized
Lord Curzon, in India, of the way the cabinet's thinking was likely to develop. In
a letter written some ten months before Curzon's "flag-showing" tour inthe
Persian Gulf, hewarned the advocate ofvigorous policies towards Russia in

Asia that European military andnaval balances were seen to need heavier
expenditure onnaval than onmilitary requirements. Inother words, a policy
was already being envisaged in London that Harold Nicolson could later
pinpoint, when he wrote "the Anglo-Russian Convention had been concluded
solely inthe interests of the European balance of power". As Selborne told the
Viceroy, this balance meant augmenting naval estimates at the expense of the
army, with the inference that diplomacy with Russia would have to be resorted
to over areas of potential friction in Asia.112
Meanwhile inIran the search for oil went on. There was a widely circulated
story that G.B. Reynolds received a cable instructing him to dismantle the
drilling-rig and move everything away (probably inApril 1908) but he decided
to wait for the confirmatory letter — adecision which he knew would give him
another month or five weeks towork. Before this letter arrived, No. 1 wellat
Masjid-i Sulaiman struck oil on 26 May 1908. Thus, according tothis version,
the D'Arcy venture only just escaped being another addition to the list of Iranian
business and investment failures.
By the time oilwas struck the Anglo-Russian Convention had been con
cluded. Negotiations forit reveal noevidence of any attempt being made to
protect economic interests, the oil concession being no exception. The Liberal
government was committed to widespread domestic reform and to reducing
naval and imperial expenditures. In 1907 it dissolved the Admiralty Petroleum
Standing Committee. But when Winston Churchill became First Lord of the
Admiralty in 1911, renewed activity resulted inthe formation ofnew govern
mental committees, which began negotiations with the Anglo-Persian Oil
Company which had been formed in April 1909.
The Iranian oilfield was about 110 miles north northeast of Khurramshahr
(then Muhammara). The pipeline, completed in June 1911, hadan annual
capacity of400,000 tons. Asite for a refinery was chosen on Abadan island.In
1909 A.T. Wilson (later Sir Arnold) noted in his diary: "I am onmy way to
Mohammerah fora preliminary survey ofland needed onAbadan bythe Oil
Company fora refinery. They want a square mile of desert." The farman by
which the Arab tribes held Abadan forbade its sale, so the British by an
agreement with the Shaikh ofMuhammara leased the land fora yearly rental

during the period of the concession. Wilson described the negotiations which he
and SirPercy Cox conducted. These lasted:
... for three or four days: for the Shaikh it was a momentous occasion. He was called upon actively to assist in the establishment within his bailiwick ofa company which, as he foresaw, would eventually overshadow all the other commercial and other interests and would inevitably cause the Persian Government toseek toextend their administration (hitherto delegated to him) to every part of Arabistan - a country as different from Persia as is Spain from Germany. As an Arab he hated and feared such a prospect as did his people. Could he rely upon us to protect him? Without aguarantee that we would assist him to the utmost of our power in maintaining his hereditary and customary rights and his property in Persia it would be suicidal for him to meet our wishes. The Home Government authorized Cox to give such assurances, and to extend them to his heirs and successors.
The assurances to the Shaikh of Muhammara were to hold good only for so long
as he and his descendants "observe their obligations toHMG and to the central
Government and are acceptable to the tribesmen". Though hesent his sons to the
American mission school at Basra inorder toequip them forthe challenges of
the future, an independent Shaikhdom of Muhammara did not survive, in spite
of the fact that maps drawn in the course ofWorld War I provide forsuch an
independent Arab state.113
Despite early problems, the refinery was operational by the summer of1913.
By the time war broke out in 1914 crude oil and refined products were being
exported from Iran, thefirst of the great Middle Eastern producers.114
The boundary separating the Ottoman Empire andIran had remained
undefined, occasioning a never-ending succession of frontier incidents.The
development ofthe oil fields insouthern Iran revived this problem. As earlyas
1843 negotiations for asettlement of the frontier had been started. From 1843to
1865 a large correspondence had accumulated and considerable work had been
done by therepresentatives of the four powers, Iran, theOttoman Empire,
Great Britain and Russia. There were disputes over the area between Mount
Ararat and Baghdad where Kurdish tribes lived, over the region betweenthe
confluence ofthe Tigris and Euphrates, and over the head ofthe Persian Gulf,

involving the question of sovereignty over the Shatt al-cArab. Conferences were
convened, surveys were made, and recriminations exchanged.
The first stage of these negotiations hadlasted from May 1843 to May 1847.
The main lines of settlement arrived at were incorporated into the Treaty of
Erzerum of May 1847, ratified in March 1848. Thetreaty stipulated that in the
survey of the boundary itself, which had yet to be undertaken, British and
Russian commissioners would be associated with the two parties directly
involved. The Crimean war and the Anglo-Iranian war of 185 6 suspended work.
In 1859a progress report estimated that another twoyears would be needed to
produce a map. By 1865 theBritish hadcompleted their map. Discussions took
place in Saint Petersburg in 1867 and amendments were agreed to in 1869.By
1870, all thegovernments involved hadcopies of the maps. Neither the Iranian
nor the Ottoman government was satisfied. A commission of Iranian, Turkish,
Russian, andBritish members was still deliberating in Constantinople when the
Serbian warbroke outin 18 75. By 1885 Britain alone hadspent £ 100,000 on the
boundary question, but there wasno agreed frontier. Themaps had narrowed
the problem to a strip of territory ranging from twenty to forty miles wide
somewhere in which the frontier would be drawn.
In the conditions of the early 20th century the question definitely had tobe
resolved. The oilcompany had carried outsome ofits earliest drilling operations
in disputed territories, which might belong wholly or partly to theOttomans or
to the Iranians. Therefinery wasbuilt at Abadan on the Shatt al- Arab estuary,
where the frontier wasstill a bone of contention. The boundary survey, again
composed of the same four nationalities, finally completed its work just after
war broke out. A.C. Wratislaw, for many years British Consul-General at
Tabriz, was the head of the British commission. Sir Arnold Wilson was also
associated with the demarcation, as wasG.E. Hubbard, whowrote an account
of the undertaking. M.V. Minorsky headed theRussian commission. In the final
adjustment some oil-bearing territories went to the Ottomans.115
Great Britain and Russia pursued a joint policy in Iran until the Russian
Revolution, butit was hardly acase ofmutual co-operation. ForGreat Britain, it
meant an association, at least in the minds of the Iranians, with Russia inthe
suppression ofthe Constitutional Movement, inthe occupation ofnorthern Iran
by foreign troops, in the bombardment of the Majlis by theCossack Brigade in
1908, in the violation of the shrine at Mashhad in 1912, andin theexpulsion of

the American financial mission headed by William Morgan Shuster in 1911. But
at the same time British people of liberal principles, not least prominent
members of the Liberal Party, were deeply concerned about events in Iran,
especially when Shuster's mission was terminated and Anglo-Russian relations
severely strained inDecember 1911 asa result. The London "Persia Commit
tee", presided over by Lord Lamington, an advocate both of British imperialism
and of British good understanding of Eastern peoples, was described in The
Timesof 1 o September 1909 as containing radicals who had used "Platonic" pro
Persian sympathies as a "cloak for. . . Russophobia", which The Times leader
writer thought out ofplace when StPetersburg was proving conciliatory. In
fact, membership of the two committees (Parliamentary and non-Parliamentary)
included 40 MPs and, although the majority was Liberal, members of the other
main party were not absent.116
In the melancholy years before the First World War Iran all but ceased to exist
as anindependent state. The Majlis was dismissed and did not meet againfor
three years. Ministries were of a makeshift kind and dependent upon the will of
the two legations. The titular head of the country was the young Ahmad Shah,
destined tobe the last ofthe Qajars. Acritical state offinancial embarrassment
prevailed, which Russia used to strengthen itsposition in exchange forsmall
loans. The central authority fell into disrepute in the provinces as the penniless
Iranian government failed tomaintain order. The Anglo-Russian Convention
had not contemplated, as Grey put it in 1914, a "political or commercial
partition of Persia". He added that events not "foreseen in 1907 have resulted in
a military occupation by Russia of the north of Persia and the establishment of a
political protectorate there". In a letter to theBritish ambassador in Saint
Petersburg, Grey set out the essentials ofthe problem intwo sentences: "The
weakness ofour position inPersia isthat the Russians are prepared to occupy
Persia, and we are not. We wish Persia to bea neutral buffer state; theyare
willing to partition it." By the time the First World War came itwas obvious that
the Anglo-Russian Agreement had failed and would have to be redesigned.
Grey spoke frankly to the Russians:
... the northern part of Persia, notably Azerbaijan, was now a Russian province ruled by Russian officials. The governor-general refused toacknowledge the authority ofthe Persian Government inany matter, and did so with the full approval ofthe Russian authorities. No Persian officials were allowed to collect taxes. These were levied by the Russian consuls and paid into the Russian bank. . . .Land was under every kind of open illegality transferred to Russian immigrants by the square mile, whole villages and their

outlying populations were taken formally under Russian "protection," which meant that for all practical purposes they ceased to be Persian subjects. The Cossack brigade paid for by the Persian Government was removed from their control by the simple expedient of the officers declaring that they were under the orders of the Russian Minister of War. The Russian bank used its whole so-called banking machinery for substituting itself for the Persian Government administration and seducing what remained of loyalty to their Government oflocal chiefs and small people alike.
In this way Persia, whose integrity and independence the Russian Government had solemnly pledged themselves touphold, had been shorn ofher most important provinces. This Russian activity was now systematically pushing further south. . . .unless the situation was remedied . . . the whole policy of Anglo-Russian friendship, on which His Majesty's Government had built, andwhich was thecorner-stone of their foreign relations, would come toa disastrous end . . . The Russian Government had made all government of Persia impossible, and had undermined that State so effectively that it now began to look doubtful whether itcould ever be expected to recover. We could not go onpretending to beblind.117
Dispositions over Iran formed part of the Constantinople agreement of 1915.
Britain received a free hand in theneutral zone, which contained the now
important oilfields, in exchange forallowing Russia unfettered action in the
large northern zone. In the event ofan Entente victory Russia would control
Constantinople andthe Straits.118 TheSoviet government repudiated these
arrangements in 1917.
In the First World War Iran was a battleground forRussian, Turkish and
British forces. German agents actively fomented trouble and with considerable
success. The Anglo-Russian Convention had created a favourable atmosphere
for such activities. To counteract this, theBritish in 1916 formed the South
Persia Rifles, which were not disbanded until 1921. Iran emerged from the war
in a state of administrative and financial chaos. The Shah was unsuited to the
task of rebuilding acountry rent by every sort of internal disorder and racked by
famine, malaria, and influenza.119
British interests inthe country had increased. Oil was an element ofnational
power of the first order. In addition to their Indian commitments, the British
were established on Iran's western border. Lord Curzon's perception of Iran asa
buffer-state considerably influenced his ardent promotion of the Anglo-Persian
Agreement of 1919. This Agreement was toprovide for extensive financial and

military assistance to Iran, under the supervision of British officials. The Iranian
government rejected the 1919 Agreement in 1921. Thus, after more than a
century of close, although by no means harmonious intercourse, the two
governments went their separate ways. But by then Iran was moving ina new
direction in response to thework and will of one man, Riza Khan, soon to
become Riza Shah PahlavL120 Whatever his shortcomings may have been, it
cannot be denied that Riza Shah controlled Iran with an energy and firmness of
purpose which had few precedents. Foreign influence, so long the dominant
characteristic of an enfeebled regime, declined markedly.
In conclusion, it can be said that from Napoleon's time until theAnglo
Russian Convention of 1907 Iran mattered to Britain primarily because of its
proximity toIndia. The inconsistencies prevailing inBritish attitudes towards
both India and Russia affected policy towards Iran. There was first the contro
versy between masterly inactivity and mischievous activity: between a station
ary or an active frontier policy. Then there was the complicated character ofthe
relationship between England and India. Balfour once likened them to allied
states. One, supposedly subordinate, retained enough independence to make
effective common action difficult. Lord Northbrook's tenacious and successful
refusal to carry out the home government's decision (which hadnot only
cabinet approval butcabinet initiative) in 1875—6 to send a British officer to
Herat, is only one example of many. The Anglo-Russian Convention decided
the issue conclusively. The Government ofIndia's role in policy-making was
reduced almost to extinction.
A third deterrent to close Anglo-Iranian relations was the belief held by many
British statesmen that Russian power was already dominant in the north of Iran,
which included the seat of government. Geography put both beyond England's
reach and somade effective co-operation impossible. Finally, the cumbersome
administrative arrangements involving the Foreign Office, the War Office, the
India Office and the Government of India - sometimes the Law Officers, the
Treasury, and the Admiralty - even when not inconflict, made policy formula
tion slow and ponderous. Salisbury alluded to the "inconvenience of divided
rule" in 1879:
In the last twenty years Central Asian politics have been agame of chess in which itwas necessary to sacrifice either Persia or Afghanistan in order to leave room for the other to move. But the two being under two co-ordinate authorities instead ofunder one, our

RELATIONS WITH BRITAIN AND BRITISH INDIA
policy has never represented the distinct choice of a single mind, but a compromise between two conflicting claims: . . . Shir Ali learned to distrust us - & Persia has never
even been disposed to like us.121
There were five broad themes in the British diplomatic connection with India
and Iran during the 19th century. First, the predominant place of India in the
general formulation of British foreign policy. Until recently this has been
underrated. Secondly, Britain's Indian policy had almost always to be subordin
ated to European considerations. Thirdly, the defence of India was a lively issue
in British party politics. Fourthly, the policy the British followed in Iran
depended primarily upon the needs of India. Finally, it was difficult, if not
impossible, to stand, as Salisbury put it, upon the Persian and the Afghan legs at
the same time. Therefore, British policy in Iran was neither consistent nor
strong. Attitudes in England towards overseas involvements were sharply
divided. India was at least thought to be worth keeping, but there were
dissenting voices even here.122
Marzieh Gail, in her book Persiaand the Victorians, has said that in the 19th
century the two countries became "psychologically interactive".123 In England,
there was certainly a lively demand for the fiction and descriptive writings of
James Morier, Malcolm, and James Baillie Fraser. Their works gave tothe
educated Englishman of the day such ideas as hehad about Iran. Morier's
picaresque tale of the Isfahan barber, Hajji Baba, first appeared in print in
London in 1824 and had a great popular success, and many subsequent
reprintings. In 1853 Matthew Arnold, inspired at least in part by Burnes's
account of his travels to and from Bukhara, brought out his rendering of
Firdausi's story of Rustam and Suhrab. Six years later, Fitzgerald's Kubaiyat of
Omar Khayyam appeared. Lady Sheil's Glimpses of Life and Manners inPersia
(London, 1856)and E.B. Tiastwick's Journal ofa Diplomat's Three Years9 Residence
in Persia (London, 1864) were only two accounts among many which gave tothe
English reader impressions of the Iranian scene. Eastwick also translated Sacdi's
Gulistan.The Persian dictionary of Edward Henry Palmer, of Cambridge, came
out in 1876 and went through a second edition in 1884. Scholarship, and not
least that related to Persia, was also indebted to Sir William Jones's founding of
the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784, and later to Henry Rawlinson's decipher
ment of the "Persian Cuneiform Inscription at Behistun" (published 1846
121 Salisbury to Northcote, 5December 1878. Balfour MSS, 50,019. Brit. Lib. 122 Mohammad Anwar Khan, "England, Russia and Central Asia, pp. 243-4, quoting Argyll. 123 Persiaand the Victorians, p. 105. The best treatment of the interaction of the British and the Persia is Wright, op. cit.

18 51), which yielded not only fresh information about ancient Iran, but ancient
Babylonia and Assyria aswell, to say nothing ofits philological importance.
Thus in different ways Iran and its history and literature became known to the
British reading public. Then Nasir al-Din Shah set anexample which later
Iranian rulers followed when hefirst visited Europe in 1873. Regarding the
English part of his tour, Sir Frederick Ponsonby, wrote "Wherever the Shah
went", he was "met byan enthusiasm and a curiosity that it would be as
impossible to describe astoaccount for."124
But there was aless constructive side to this Anglo-Iranian relationship. The
Iranians, especially after the Russo-Iranian war of1826—8, developed ahabit of
mind which blamed the British for many of their misfortunes. Promised British
aid had not materialised when ithad been badly needed against Russia. Then, it
was Britain which stood in the way of the reconquest of Herat — in spite of many
descriptions by British travellers of Herat as atypically Iranian city. Later, in the
19th and 20th centuries, British economic projects were seen as exploitation, not
development. The sense of discontent and futility was immeasurably intensified
by the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907,and by Iran's vulnerability during
the First World War. Toingrained pessimism was added keen resentment.
British power came to beridiculously exaggerated and British influence re
garded asall-pervasive. In 1940 this attitude was set out ina Foreign Office
minute:
The idea that we are what Mr Lascelles once called 'the silent, omnipotent Power' which put the Shah on histhrone, keeps himthere, andarranges andaccepts his apparent rebuffs because itsuits us to do so for some deep and mysterious reason of our own, is prevalent to anastonishing degree, even among well educated and well informed
Persians.125

CHAPTER I 2
IRANIAN FOREIGN POLICY, 1921-1979
In recent times, a significant aspect of Iran's foreign relations has been foreign
interference in the country's affairs, with varying Iranian response to this. Three
major factors have played a determining role in this: Iran's growing strategic
and economic importance as an oil producer in a zone of major power rivalry;
the national features of Iran as a predominantly ShIcI, but socially heterogeneous
society, with no consensus over the appropriate form and functions of govern
ment; and the need of the rulers of Iran to ensure the continuation of their rule
and to govern Iran effectively in these circumstances. Iran's foreign relations
between 1921 and 1979 must be studied in this context. This period covers the
rule of the Pahlavl dynasty, begun by Riza Shah's accession to the throne in
1925, following his seizure of political power through a coup in 1921, and ended
with the overthrow of his son, Muhammad Riza Shah, in 1979. The collapse of
the Pahlavi dynasty opened the way for its major opponent, Ayatullah Ruh
Allah Khumaini, to declare Iran an Islamic Republic and abolish the monarchy.
For historical and analytical purposes, the Pahlavi period is best examined in
three parts: Riza Shah's rule (1925—1941), Muhammad Riza Shah's reign (1941
53) and his rule (1953—1979)- During each of these periods, foreign powers
subjected Iran to different types of pressure and encroachment, influencing the
country's domestic and foreign policies in distinct ways. Under Riza Shah, while
Anglo-Russian rivalry over Iran was kept in abeyance as the two powers'
changing interests dictated, Iran's foreign policy reflected various short-term
attempts to maintain this situation and benefit from it in the assertion of Iran's
independence. During Muhammad Riza Shah's reign;which commenced im
mediately after the wartime Anglo-Soviet occupation which lasted until 1946,
Iran entered a phase of renewed striving for independence and for some sort of
"democratic" order, but remained unable to follow a consistent foreign policy
until Musaddiq practically eclipsed the Pahlavi regime with his firmly nationalist
policy that the Shah later called "negative nationalism". The situation under the
Shah's rule changed drastically. His reassertion of power was encouraged and
aided by the United States. Thus the course was set for Iran's foreign policy to be
determined mainly by his regime's "dependence" on Washington, with the
resulting convergence of Iran's interests with those of the West.

IRANIAN FOREIGN POLICY, 1921-79
In the 19th century, the strategic location of Iran between Russia and Great
Britain's colonial presence in India rendered the country of concern to both
powers. While Russia regarded Iran as vital to its security and as a gateway to the
"wealth of India", Britain found it increasingly important to the defence ofits
colonial interests. As a result, the two powers engaged ina prolonged rivalry
over Iran. The rivalry grew so intense that the British Viceroy of India, and one
of the major protagonists of British imperialism, Lord Curzon, commented that
Iran, together with Afghanistan, Turkistan and Transcaspia, constituted "the
pieces on achessboard upon which is being played out agame for the domina
tion ofthe world . . ."*
The broad objective of the two powers was to consolidate the position of Iran
as a buffer zone, so that neither would be able to threaten the other's security and
interests directly. They could not, however, achieve this without influencing
Iranian politics. A quest therefore developed for respective spheres of influence
in Iran. The powers divided the country into aRussian zone of influence in the
north and a British zone in the south, with a "neutral" area under the nominal
administration ofthe Tehran government between the two zones (cf. map 8).
While the Tehran government was to be responsive to the powers' pressures and
needs, "each zone was to be dependent on its respective patron power for
protection and the conduct of its political and economic affairs".2 The rival
powers formally agreed tothe division inthe Saint Petersburg Convention of
1907, although Russia did so reluctantly, under pressure from growing domestic
unrest and after defeat byJapan in the war of 1904— 5.3
In the meantime, the discovery ofcommercially viable quantities ofoil in
southern Iran added anew economic dimension to the strategic significance of
Iran, and consequently to Anglo-Russian rivalry. In1901, the Iranian monarch,
Muzaffar al-DIn Shah, granted the first oil concession toan English entrepre
neur, William Knox D'Arcy, for the exploration and exploitation of oil through
out Iran for sixty years, except in the five northern provinces, the Russian sphere
of influence. Fourteen years later, the British government acquired a majority
share-holding in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which had been formed in
1909; the British government undertook not tobecome involved inthe Com
pany's commercial activities. The British soon managed to develop the Iranian
oil industry into a leading export concern, giving Britain far more influence in
Iranian economic and political matters than Russia.4 The Russian government

IRANIAN FOREIGN POLICY, 1921-79
could do little more than accept this, given its increasing domestic problems and
the need to forge an alliance with Britain in the mounting tension before World
War I. The overthrow of the Tsarist regime and subsequent seizure of power by
the Bolsheviks, together with Russia's collapse into civil war, provided Britain
with more reason and further opportunity to strengthen its position in Iran,
encroach on the Russian zone ofinfluence, and touse it as a base against the
Bolsheviks. Hence, the British were able toforce the Iranian government to
consent to the Anglo-Iranian Treaty of1919. Had the Treaty been approved by
the Iranian Majlis (National Assembly), it would have enabled Britain to control
the country's foreign, defence and financial affairs, and thus to reduce its
position to that ofa virtual British protectorate.5
Anglo-Russian rivalry owed much ofits scope tothe weakness of Iranian
government, which left the country's foreign policy vulnerable to manipulation
throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. During this period Iran suffered
from frail political, economic and social structures, under the autocratic, but
impoverished, Qajar dynasty. Although the Iranian people were accustomedto
absolute monarchy, the Qajar dynasty suffered from inefficient and corrupt
administration and and a weak and unreliable army. The constitutional and
political system provided little room for reform. Asa result, thesense of
nationalism was tentative, contending "with the country's widely dispersed
population, difficult terrain, absence ofan effective communication network,
and above all, volatile society. The society rested upon acomplex and delicate
web of interactions"6 between the monarchy, ShIcI clergy, the professional and
commercial strata, and the diverse ethnic groups. Whenever these interactions
were upset, Iran was exposed toviolent stress. There was undoubtedly a link
between the international situation and Anglo-Russian interference in Iran. The
two processes were exacerbated at the cost of Iran's national cohesion, stability
and progress, while the country had no defence against Anglo-Russian competi
tion and its consequences, one of which, however, was that, ironically, Iran was
never completely eliminated asa distinct political entity.
If the forces opposing foreign domination were to acquire the necessary
strength tomount a successful challenge toAnglo-Russian interference, Iran
had to implement certain domestic changes. A movement, ledmainly by
Western-inspired intellectuals, merchants, and ShIcI theologians, began at the
start of the century. The movement, whose members subsequently became
known as Constitutionalists, made demands for constitutional reform to subject

the monarchy tothe rule oflaw and modernize the political and social system in
order to bring about national consensus and unity. The movement initially
secured theliberal Constitution of 1906, which prescribed a constitutional
monarchy with parliamentary and theological checks andbalances and en
forced, with some interruptions, a semblance of constitutional government
between 1909and 1921. In regard to foreign affairs, the Constitutionalists
opposed, although through noclearly articulated policy, Anglo-Russian inter
ference, anddemanded respect for Iran's sovereignty andterritorial integrity.
The foreign policy of the constitutionalist governments indicates that they
sought to reduce the effects of the Anglo-Russian rivalry by maintaining a
balanced relationship with the two powers, close friendship with athird power
(preferably the United States, ageographically distant and largely non-colonial
country) and Iran's neighbours, and Iranian neutrality in international disputes
which did not threaten Iran directly.7
The constitutionalist achievement, inboth domestic and foreign fields,was
limited. This was duetotwomain causes. First, theConstitutionalists lacked
unanimity ofopinion. They also faced opposition from the Qajar dynasty, which
sought support against them from both Russia andBritain, inreturn for its de
facto recognition oftheir zones ofinfluence inIran.8 This, together with someof
the Constitutionalists' adhoc "democratic" changes, worsened the country's
social andeconomic situation, allowing various tribal groups to grow strong
and claim autonomous rule, sometimes with encouragement from foreign
powers.9 Secondly, Russia and Britain had not yetreached parity in Iran to
enable them tolessen their interference; instead, they had entered a temporary,
wartime alliance, which allowed both ofthem toengage infurther operations
within their respective zones and, ifpossible, beyond them. Thus, the Constitu
tionalists could not effectively challenge theforeign powers. Because of this,
Iran had toawait anew leadership toconduct the country's domestic and foreign
affairs.

This leadership came with the dramatic rise ofRiza Khan, commander of Iran's
Russian-trained andonly effectively disciplined military force, the Cossack
Division. Riza Khan rose topower andassumed theposition ofSardar Sipah

(Commander-in-Chief) of the armed forces in a political partnership with a
leading pro-British nationalist figure, Sayyid Ziya al-DIn Tabataba°i, who
became prime minister in acoup in 1921. Riza Khan, however, soon proved to
be the major figure. He quickly rid himself of Tabataba°i and, in 1923, became
prime minister. He became Shah in December 1925, by avote of the Majlis after
an amendment to the Constitution of 1906. Hethus superseded the Qajar
dynasty. He established the Pahlavl dynasty and, although constitutional forms
were observed, in effect succeeded in imposing absolute rule. He thus appealed
to Iranians both socially and traditionally, whilst retaining the Constitution of
1906 and the Majlis asa source oflegitimacy for his actions.
Riza Shah has been labelled both a British agent and a sophisticated national
ist modernizes He was, however, primarily a self-educated soldier, who op
posed Iran's chaotic national condition and the country's humiliating position as
a pawn in Anglo-Russian rivalry. Hewanted to rescue Iran from national
collapse and reassert its national identity. His vision for Iran was enlightened but
authoritarian. He emphasized a balanced approach to the conduct of Iran's
foreign relations, and the achievement of national unity, stability and modernity
under a centralized leadership. He believed that only thus could Iran conduct its
own affairs and avoid the vulnerability to foreign interference that ensued from
domestic weakness. He understood both the Iranian people's traditional respect
for powerful leadership, and the causes of Anglo-Russian involvement in Iran.
Meanwhile, both regional and international circumstances had changed
favourably for Iranian independence. In Russia, the Bolsheviks had undertaken
the transformation of the country into a Marxist-Leninist state. They faced
formidable opposition from the White Russian and British forces that operated
from bases in northern Iran. While the Bolsheviks twice occupied Gilao, in
1920—1, and supported the ethnic, quasi-communist Mirza Kuchik Khan in
setting up a pro-Moscow independent republic there, they were also eager to
pursue good relations with Iran in order to neutralize British activities there.It
became clear to the Bolsheviks that they should refrain from any action that
could increase Iran's dependence on Britain. Lenin and Rothstein, who, in
November 1920, became Soviet Ambassador to Iran, held that "any attempt on
. . . [the Soviet] . . . part to start revolution in any part of Persia would
immediately throw itinto the arms of the British, who would be received as the
Saviours ofthe Fatherland".10

RIZA SHAH'S REIGN
By this time, Britain had realized that it could neither rely ona successful
counter-revolution inRussia nor sustain the cost ofits military support ofthe
White Russians. Ithad also come under pressure from anti-British feeling in the
region, especially in India, Afghanistan and Turkey, which required itto reduce
its competition with Russia in favour of maintaining its position in these areas.
Britain therefore reduced its support for Shaikh Khazcal (cf. p.222) inthe oil
producing Khuzistan province and adopted a low profile in regions formerly
comprising itszone of influence in southern and south-eastern Iran, while it
withdrew from the north-west, whence it had mounted support for the White
Russians.11
Thus, both Russia and Britain, after a long period ofintervention in Iran,
found themselves having to curtail their involvement in the country. They both
favoured astable Iran under an effective leadership, capable of assuring the rival
powers that it would respect their interests whilst maintaining its neutrality.
This helped Riza Shah prove to Iranians that he had the necessary attributes for
government, and tothe rival powers that he had the capacity and prudence to
rule Iran without undermining the security and interests of one in favour of the
other. He was therefore able to begin the process of centralizing power,
reorganizing and strengthening the government and security forces and imple
menting social and economic reforms. He considered success inthis absolutely
essential for the attainment of political and eonomic stability and the improve
ment of conditions in Iran on the one hand, and, on the other, for proving to the
rival powers that hewas capable of making Iran anindependent state.12
Riza Shah at first relied on the surviving diplomatists of the Qajar period for
the conduct of Iran's foreign relations. He could not immediately dispense with
their experience. However, hesoon brought the Ministry forForeign Affairs
and the entire foreign policy process under his personal control. He had no
choice butto link this policy closely to both changing domestic needs and
Anglo-Russian attitudes. He could not adopt afixed foreign policy, but instead
engaged in short-term, variable decisions as the situation demanded. He stressed
the same three foreign policy aims ashis Constitutionalist predecessors, how
ever: good relations with Russia and Britain; neutrality inworld politics; and
close friendship with a third power, toprovide a counterweight tothe British
and Russians.
His main priority was thereduction of Iran's dependence on these two

powers and the lessening and eventual eradication of their influence inIranian
politics. He pursued these ends bybalancing Iran's relations with them and
playing them off against one another, so that neither side would undermine the
stability of Pahlavi rule. Although he always regarded Russia as a greater danger
than Britain, one of his first acts was the endorsement ofthe Soviet-Iranian
Treaty of Friendship (1921). In response to prevailing public opinion, he
encouraged the Majlis finally to reject the Anglo-Iranian Treaty of1919 in 1922.
While stressing the value of friendly relations with both powers, he pursued a
policy of centralization to crush their respective surrogates, Kuchik Khan and
Shaikh Khazcal. He undertook social and economic modernization, turning to
European countries and Turkey for expertise, technology and capital, rather
than to Russia or Britain. He also implemented judicial reforms tolimit the
authority of the traditional Islamic legal system and to supplement it with
western legal codes, hoping thereby to eliminate one of the most hated symbols
of foreign influence inIran; the system of"capitulations". Under this, foreign
powers had secured legal privileges for their nationals in Iran, including the
right to be tried by their own consular courts.13 By 1928, Riza Shah was able to
abolish capitulations.
All this, however, did not disguise the fact that Britain still owned and
controlled the Iranian oil industry and therefore had great influence on Iran's
economy and, ultimately, its politics. Dissatisfaction over this grew in Moscow,
as well asin Tehran. The latter had long felt that the terms of the D'Arcy
Concession were unfavourable to Iran and that Britain hadbeen able to
monopolize the Iranian oil industry as an export sector with little benefit to the
Iranian economy, and much for the oil company.14 Riza Shah shared this feeling,
and asked for the renegotiation ofthe D'Arcy Concession inorder to reduce
Iran's dependence on aforeign power, and, atthe same time, toobtain higher
revenue with which tofinance his social and economic reforms. The Anglo
Persian Oil Company (A.P.O.C.) was, at this stage, unresponsive, while, due to
the Depression, it paid markedly reduced royalties to the Iranian government in
1931—2. This caused Riza Shah to cancel the original Concession in November
1932, and demand arenegotiated agreement. The British rejection of this move
precipitated a crisis in Anglo-Iranian relations. After a period of intense negotia
tion, Britain signed a new concession with Iran on 29 April 1933, valid until
1993, with the condition that it should not be unilaterally cancelled. Although

RIZA SHAH'S REIGN
under the new concession the A.P.O.C. agreed to pay Iran more than beforein
royalties and dividends, and agreed toincreased Iranian participation in the oil
industry, the British still maintained their monopoly on Iranian oil from
production to shipment, and later hesitated to implement the agreement fully.15
Nonetheless, this moderate success provided Riza Shah with the opportunity
to demonstrate the strength of his leadership and to intensify his efforts towards
the achievement ofother foreign policy objectives. Iran was already anearly
member of the League of Nations, a signatory of the Kellogg Pact,and
"generally encouraged the peaceful settlement ofdisputes".16 Riza Shah now
laid more emphasis on foreign policy and devoted himself to strengthening
Iran's relations with its immediate neighbours; Turkey, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He signed a series of agreements over disputed frontiers, "with the aim of
forming a 'small-power bloc' that could resist pressures from theimperial
powers".17 This eventually resulted in the Sacadabad Pact of non-aggression and
consultation between Iran and these three neighbours, in 1937.
Moreover, heshared the conviction ofmany ofhis compatriots that close
friendship with a third power would provide Iran with the leverage that it
needed todefend its integrity and independence. He made continual efforts to
establish close ties with theUnited States andconvince it of the value of
friendship with Iran. Following Tehran's invitation, in 1922, tothe American
financial advisor, A.C. Millspaugh, to reorganize Iran's finances, Riza Shah
hoped to nurture close relations with the United States; but he soon discovered
that Washington was less interested in such arelationship than he was, given its
policy of isolationism in world affairs, particularly in aregion that it recognized
as aBritish sphere of influence. After his direct approach had failed, Riza Shah
resorted to seeking to involve American oil companies in theIranian oil
industry, and toprovoke Washington into concluding a treaty similar to the
Treaty ofCommerce and Navigation that Iran eventually concluded with the
U.S.S.R., in March 1940. However, Moscow demanded that if the American
companies were granted an oil concession, the Soviet Union should be given an
equal concession, whilst his second move brought no reaction from Washing
ton.18 Riza Shah could finally secure nothing more than limited diplomatic and
trade links with the U.S.A.
The second "third power" that Riza Shah approached was Germany. The
rise of Nazi Germany had impressed the Iranian leadership, as it had other

nationalist governments and movements in Asia and the Middle East. In an
attempt to weaken the British position, Hitler gave generous economic and
technical assistance to Iran, as to Turkey and Afghanistan. Growing friendship
with Germany resulted. By the end ofthe 1930s, some six hundred German
experts were employed in various industrial, commercial and education
projects, and, by 1938-9, Germany accounted for 4 1 % of Iran's foreign trade.19
Consequently, as Churchill stated, "German prestige stood high" among
Iranians.20 While Britain was alarmed, Moscow also had cause for concern,
given its position towards Germany before the signing of the Soviet—German
Pact of Friendship, in August 1939. The situation changed when Germany
attacked the Soviet Union, prompting Stalin to enter into alliance with Britain.
This sudden development, unforeseen byTehran, proved to beRiza Shah's
downfall. In face ofthe German invasion ofthe U.S.S.R., Moscow urgently
needed military supplies from Britain and the United States. Riza Shah was
unwilling either todenounce Germany orto allow the Allied Powers to use
Iran's railway network for the transfer ofwar supplies tothe U.S.S.R. Britain
and the Soviet Union jointly invaded Iran inAugust 1941. They occupied the
country along almost the same lines asthose onwhich they had previously
divided Iran into spheres of influence. They created aSoviet zone of occupation
in the north and a British zone inthe south, with a central strip designated as
being under the authority of the Tehran government, provided that the latter
responded to the two powers' needs and dictates.
Riza Shah had already declared Iran's neutrality and was not willing to sever
his links with Germany. As hecould neither accept nor prevent the Anglo
Russian occupation, heabdicated in favour of his twenty-one year-old son,
Muhammad Riza, who was crowned on 16 September 1941. Riza Shah left for
exile, and died in Johannesburg in 1944. He has been severely criticized for his
absolutism, and hisreforms have often been overlooked. His government
structure, and, indeed, his social and economic reforms, began rapidly to
crumble. This underlined the fact that throughout his rule, Riza Shah failed to
construct a durable domestic system or foreign policy which could have enabled
him to defend Iran against changes in international circumstances, and especially
in Anglo-Soviet relations with it. Itbecame clear that he had been able to resist
British and Soviet pressure only because the rival powers had allowed him to do
so. He left little behind to help his son to govern the country effectively.

MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH'S REIGN
MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH'S REIGN
Young, inexperienced andamenable to their dictates, Muhammad Riza Shah
proved more acceptable than his father tothe occupying powers. He succeeded
to his father's office without inheriting his authority andpowers. While the
occupying forces largely governed the conduct ofIran's domestic and foreign
affairs, the Shah could not control the power structure, administration and
security apparatus. Riza Shah's autocratic and centralized system rapidly dete
riorated, opening a new phase inIranian politics. Numerous social and political
groups, including the tribes, reappeared on the Iranian political scene, with
various demands for freedom, reforms and autonomy. "Some sought the
evolutionary institution ofsome sort of 'democratic' mass participatory system
with the retention of monarchy; others demanded revolutionary 'socialist'
structural changes, with the establishment of a republic."21 This did not,
however, hinder the development ofa nationalist current, led by those political
figures, intellectuals, bureaucrats and theologians, who, unhappy with the
absolutism ofRiza Shah, were now anxious over the chaotic domestic situation
and humiliation that Iran faced at the hands offoreign powers. The monarchy,
backed by the conservatives, tried to maintain its hold on the main, but
demoralized, area of support and means of rule, the armed and security forces,
and to work for the eventual withdrawal of foreign troops. Meanwhile, the
nationalist current gained strength in theMajlis, which, after twenty years of
subordination to Riza Shah's dictates, rapidly emerged as a national forum
capable of political expression.22
Although divided andunable to articulate a national strategy for Iran, the
Majlis began tomanifest its opposition tothe foreign powers and todemand the
creation ofa more democratic political system subject to the rule oflaw. There
was thus aninevitable conflict between the executive, dominated by the monar
chy, and the legislature. The two sides distrusted each other and could not deal
with theoccupying forces from a position of united strength. This was in the
interests ofthe occupying powers. The more disunited the Iranians, the easier it
was for the powers to prevent them developing a national resistance and to
control them by making, as Churchill said, "the Persians keep each other
quiet".23 The powers were thus able to useIran for their purposes. Initially,

London and Moscow declared their occupation ofIran to betemporary. In
response tourging from Tehran, they concluded the Tripartite Treaty of 29
January 1942,in which they undertook "to safeguard the economic existence of
the Iranian people against the deprivation and difficulties arising as a result of
the present war", as well as "to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of Iran" and to withdraw their forces from Iran "not later than sixmonths" after
the end of hostilities in all war theatres. They subsequently confirmed this in the
Anglo-American-Soviet Declaration of 1 December 1943.24
However, the two powers' objectives inIran soon developed contrary to
their treaty commitments and their stance as allies of Iran. Once they had
occupied it, some of their former preoccupations over Iran apparently
reappeared, although initially the Russo-British concern was to facilitate, with
American technical assistance, the transit of urgently needed war supplies to the
Soviet Union beleaguered by the armies of Hitler. Later, the Soviets attempted
to profit from the occupation by closing their zone to free entry and beginning
its "sovietization". They allied themselves with dissident Kurds and
Azarbaijanis, who had ethnic counterparts onthe Soviet side ofthe border.
They also revived the small, but pro-Soviet Iranian Communist Party, banned
by Riza Shah in 1937, under a new name, Tuda (The Masses), asa basefor
ideological expansion. They supported the Kurds and Azarbaijanis in their
quest forautonomy, and enabled the Tuda to emerge as a force in Iranian
politics. They established an autonomous regime inAzarbaljan, for which the
Tehran government was barred from appointing a governor in1944—5.
Similarly, the British, suspicious of the Soviets, found itexpedient and, with
the risk of German infiltration, necessary to entrench themselves in their zone.
They reactivated a policy of "divide and rule", supporting theforces of
"conservatism" and"tribalism" against the elements that sought radical
changes either against the British or in favour of the Soviets. They supported
conservative elements, led by the monarchy, and assisted in the formation and
activities ofa pro-Western political party, Irada-ji Mill! (The National Will).
This was led bythe pro-British former prime minister, Sayyid Ziya al-DIn
Tabataba3!.25 ••
The two powers competed with one another and sought toundermine the
other's position, in a manner reminiscent, in certain respects, of their past rivalry
in Iran, irrespective of their commitment to its sovereignty and territorial
integrity. Thus, while pursuing a policy ofco-operation at the international

level, they engaged in a local "cold war", although some observers found
Britain more than a little lukewarm, even lax, in its pursuit. Meanwhile,the
United States, asa signatory tothe Atlantic Charter and the Anglo-American
Soviet Declaration, could no longer remain indifferent to developments inIran.
In retrospect, as suspicion ofSoviet activities grew, it seems as ifa rehearsal for
the future "Cold War" between East and West had already begun in Tehran.
Until 1940, despite Riza Shah's desire forclose relations, the United States
paid little attention toIran. Inthe early 1940s, however, in are-evaluation of its
global position following itsentry in to the Second World War, Washington
became conscious of Iran's economic and strategic importance. A number of
American policy-makers realized that if Iran, as a front-line state, fell to
communism, all Western economic and political interests inthe region would
become vulnerable to the Soviet Union. Wallace Murray, ofthe Near Eastern
Division in the U.S. State Department, advocated opposition to Soviet activities
in Iran and the resumption of trade negotiations "for reasons of political
expediency and in order to safeguard American trade interests in Iran during the
post-war period".26 During 1943, Washington responded tothe request ofthe
Iranian government by sending another financial mission, headed by Arthur
Millspaugh, to reorganize the country's finances. Millspaugh subsequently
wrote, "our control of revenues and expenditure not only served as a stabilizing
influence, but was also indispensable to the full effectiveness of Americans in
other fields".27 Patrick Hurley, the American Special Emissary to the Middle
East, advised President Roosevelt that the U.S. needed to exert much greater
effort and leadership to help Iran build a"democratic government", based upon
a "system offree enterprize", ifthe country were toremain independent inthe
post-war era.28 Washington became more favourably disposed towards Iran,
and, in 1944, raised itslegation in Iran to embassy status, and publicly joined
Britain against the Soviet Union in Iran. The Tehran government was delighted,
as it had long hoped for friendship with theUnited States.
Thus afavourable climate was provided for American oil companies toseek
access toIranian oil-fields. During the first half of 1944, Standard Vacuum and
Sinclair by-passed the British and Soviets in seeking to negotiate oil concessions
directly with the Tehran government. This displeased the British and added to
the discomfort ofthe Soviet Union, unable tooverlook the growing American
involvement inIran. Ina counter-move, the Soviet government demanded an

oil concession that would cover all five northern provinces under Soviet
occupation, stretching from Azarbaijan to Khurasan.
For allits weakness, the Tehran government under prime minister Sacid
refused oil concessions to all powers and postponed all current discussion of oil
concessions. This largely reflected the mood ofthe Majlis, which passed a bill
prohibiting any government official from either discussing orsigning any oil
concession agreement with any foreign company or person. The principal
architect of this measure was DrMuhammad Musaddiq, who emerged as a
leading spokesman for the nationalists in the Majlis.29 The Soviets suspected the
Iranian government ofhaving made its decision incollusion with the United
States and Britain, and voiced deep displeasure over the matter.30
The Soviet Union's relationship with its Western allies and theIranian
government sank to its lowest depth when Moscow showed reluctance to
honour its treaty commitment to withdraw its forces from Iran within six
months of the end of the war. The final date for troop withdrawal, as agreedat
the Allied foreign ministers' conference ofSeptember 1945, had been set for 2
March 1946. However, the Soviet Union continued to strengthen its forces in its
zone of occupation, and to support the autonomous regime in Azarbaijan, led by
the Tuda. In January 1946, the Iranian government, with U.S. and British
support, demanded the withdrawal ofSoviet troops, and formally charged the
Soviet Union before the United Nations with interference in its internal affairs.
This brought the Anglo-Soviet dispute over Iran to the forefront of global
politics, enabling the United States to take a leading part in the affair. Despite the
advice of the Security Council to Tehran and Moscow to settle their differences
bilaterally, Washington and London, which had withdrawn their troops from
Iran by 1 January, sent two separate protest notes tothe Kremlin, demanding
immediate Soviet withdrawal. The American note warned Moscow that Wash
ington "cannot remain indifferent". For President Truman, asfor the British
Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, the dispute over Iran was no longer regional.
"Russian activities in Iran", Truman wrote, "threatened thepeace of the
world." He stressed, moreover, that, "if the Russians were to control Iran's oil,
either directly or indirectly, theraw material balance of the world would
undergo serious damage, and it would be a serious loss for the economy of the
Western world". While Washington considered itworthwhile to oppose Soviet
influence in Iran at allcosts, Stalin had also found it imperative for Soviet
security and ambitions not to ignore Iran's strategic and oil importance.31

MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH'S REIGN
As the tension between the Soviet Union and Western powers increased, the
Iranian government, under thepremiership of Ahmad Qavam, who replaced
Sacid in January 1946, achieved a breakthrough in the bilateral talks with
Moscow. On24 March, Moscow unexpectedly announced that it would with
draw all Soviet troops from Iran. The two sides agreed that Soviet forces would
leave within a month and a half, that a joint-stock Iranian—Soviet oilcompany
would besetupand ratified bytheMajlis within seven months, and that Iran
would pursue policies in Azarbaijan in accordance with existing conditions
under Tuda leadership.32
The agreement enabled Moscow and Tehran to defuse the potentially
dangerous Azarbaijan crisis. But, inthe long run, it proved costly for the Soviet
Union. It had amarked impact on the Iranian people's view ofthat country, and
reinforced their belief that the Soviets were determined to turn Iran into a
socialist satellite. TheIranian monarchy, the British and the Americans ex
ploited the crisis tostrengthen anti-Soviet feeling and their own position in Iran.
To this end, the U.S. increased its military andeconomic aid to the Tehran
government, while American police and military missions became active in
reorganizing andequipping theIranian security andmiltary forces.
This enabled Muhammad Riza Shah to exert his leadership forthe first time
as constitutional Commander-in-Chief ofthe Iranian armed forces, bysuccess
fully directing operations against the secessionists inAzarbaijan and Kurdistan,
in October 1946. In October 1947, the Majlis, led byDrMusaddiq, denounced
the Iranian-Soviet agreement over Azarbaijan, especially in as far as this
agreement had involved discussion of an oilconcession. The Iranian govern
ment also outlawed theTuda Party following anattempt on theShah's life in
1949. There was no ideological alliance in this, rather a mere coincidence of
interests between the monarchy andthe Majlis. Thewhole Azarbaijan crisis
provided an opportunity both for the monarchy to regain some of its lost
leadership, and for the United States, now replacing Britain as the major
Western power, to secure a foothold in Iranian politics. This provided a
necessary basis for Washington to widen its involvement in Iran andto
transform the country into ananti-communist Western ally, dependent on the
United States.
Until the withdrawal of foreign troops, the Tehran government could initiate
little policy independently ofthe powers' needs and wishes. As aresult, itishard
to state that, during the war years, Iran maintained any consistent foreign policy.

IRANIAN FOREIGN POLICY, I92I-79
After the war and the withdrawal of all foreign troops, the Tehran government
gained some control over the management of its foreign relations. But this
control was heavily qualified byitsacceptance of American support, which
tilted Iran's position tothe West, forestalling Soviet hopes of obtaining influ
ence. There was, however a recrudescence of nationalism, which found all
foreign influence in Iran inimical to the country's well-being. This feeling,
which dominated the Majlis, became more assertive in Iranian politics following
the withdrawal offoreign troops and the consequent discrediting ofthe pro
British Irada-yi Mill! and pro-Soviet Tuda parties. Dr Musaddiq, adeputy from
Tehran, who had first appeared in Iranian politics in support of the constitution
alist movement inthe second decade ofthe century, continued toadvocate a
democratic parliamentary system with the monarchy subject to the rule of law,
the exertion of Iran's ownership andcontrol over its resources, and the
implementation of major social and economic reforms as a means of ensuring
that Iran's national identity, progress, and independence were protected against
foreign domination.
In the Majlis during the war, he had realized that one of the main causes of
foreign interference in Iran was the British exploitation of Iran's most vital
resource, oil. He had therefore successfully initiated the 1944 Oil Bill, barring
further oilconcessions to any power. By the late 1940s, Musaddiq gained
increasing support from the newly formed]abha-ji Mill!(National Front). This
was a loose grouping ofdiverse elements, ranging from ultra-nationalists to
socialist reformists and religious extremists.33 Musaddiq became a leading
spokesman forthe Front. Relying ongrowing popular support, hefound it
opportune toadvocate, above all else, Iran's ownership and control ofits oil
industry. His aims were tomaximize Iran's income from its major sourceof
foreign exchange, eliminate the possible pretext for both British direct activities
and Anglo-Soviet rivalry in Iran, and thereby improve Iran's relations with the
Soviet Union. Above all, he wished tomobilize Iranian resources inorder to
implement political, social and economic reforms, and to deprive the throne of
initiative in this respect.34
However, the Iranian government's efforts failed to secure a more favourable
oil agreement with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.). The Majlis
elected Musaddiq to the premiership on 30 April 1951, whereupon he declared
the nationalization of the A.I.O.C., on 1May 1951. While promising compensa
tion, and providing forthe continuation ofemployment ofBritish staff and

expertise, hesetupthe National Iranian Oil Company (N.I.O.C.) to manage
Iranian oil, on thebasis of full ownership and control. The nationalization,
however, proved unacceptable to the British Petroleum Company, as the
A.I.O.C. now came to be called, andto the British government. London
considered that its acceptance would not only be a serious economic loss,
possibly opening the way for other Middle Eastern oil producers tofollow suit,
but also another blow to itsdeclining position asa world power. It therefore
rejected the nationalization. This precipitated acrisis in Anglo-Iranian relations.
While British Petroleum counted on the solidarity of six other Western oil
companies toboycott Iranian oil, and the A.I.O.C. withdrew its personnel and
expertise from Iran, the British government imposed a trade embargo onIran
and resorted toaction in the International Court of Justice toforce areversal of
the decision. As the crisis deepened, Musaddiq not only had Iranian nationalist
support, but also that of the United Nations. The United States, given its
interests in theregion and its global opposition to communism, took great
interest in the crisis; it felt much sympathy forMusaddiq, and was concerned
that Britain might drive him into alliance with the Soviet Union. It offered to
mediate in the crisis, but this wasprevented by Britain, leading the U.S.
Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, to conclude that the British were "destructive
and determined on a rule orruin policy inIran".35 The Soviets, despite having
no particular liking for Musaddiq, who hadnever shown them anyspecial
favour, supported his nationalist stance, and urged the Tuda to support him, but
were cautious of nationalization, which would have ended any hope of a Soviet
oil concession.36
In view of Britain's weakening position, London concluded that thebest
solution to the crisis was the removal of the Musaddiq government. The British
Foreign Secretary, SirAnthony Eden, advocated its replacement by a pro
Western conservative government, headed by themonarchy.37 This seemed
feasible because, while the Shah had initially supported Musaddiq's nationaliza
tion, he was subsequently unwilling toapprove either Musaddiq's methods or
his attempts to limit the powers of the monarchy, attempts which forced the
Shah to leave Iran temporarily in mid-August 1953. In the meantime, the
situation worsened forMusaddiq athome. The British economic blockade and
the international oil companies' boycott ofIranian oil caused the country'soil
production to drop to 10% of its pre-nationalization capacity. The country's oil
revenue fell dramatically. These factors "resulted inserious economic hardship

and polarization of Iranians into pro- and anti-Mossadeq forces. The anti
Mossadeq forces were centred around the monarchy, which had the support of a
large section ofthe armed forces".38
This finally prompted theEisenhower administration to put America's
global strategy against communism above all other considerations, to accept the
British assertion that Musaddiq was being influenced bythe Tuda, and to
replace his government by apro-western regime under the Shah.39 In late 1953,
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, aided by the British Intelligence Service
and Iranian conservative forces, engineered theoverthrow of Musaddiq's
government in favour of the Shah. Musaddiq was arrested, tried, and sentenced
to solitary confinement for three years. The Shah returned from abrief exile to
begin his rule^but under the aegis ofthe United States.40 The Shah accused
Musaddiq of having been under communist influence and of "treason".He
charged him.with pursuing a doctrine of "negative equilibrium", which stressed
"the ending ofIran's suffering from the influence and domination of foreign
powers" by granting "no concession toany foreign power and acceptingno
favour from any". He branded his own regime's policy "positive nationalism",
promoting Iran's sovereignty, independence and development under his own
absolute leadership, but in alliance with the West, and the United States in
particular.41
THE SHAH'S RULE
The Shah's rise to effective power entailed major changes in Iranian politics. His
regime faced a broad based domestic opposition and strong hostility from
neighbouring powers, especially from the Soviet Union and the "radical" Arab
nationalist forces, which considered the Shah an agent of Western imperialism.42
With this opposition from abroad, the depressed Iranian economy andthe
weakness of the Shah's power base and armed and security forces, he found it
necessary torely on the United States. For its part, Washington continued its
original intervention to ensure the continuity of his regime in line with America's
regional interests and global opposition to communism. While the Shah drew

THE SHAH'S RULE
on what he perceived asa Soviet and radical Arab threat inorder to secure
increasing American aid, the Eisenhower Administration set out to transform
Iran, under the Shah, into a dependent American ally. It declared its full political
support for the Shah's regime and, toenable it tomeet its urgent economic
needs, extended grants to itunder the U.S. Technical Assistance Programme.It
sought to consolidate along-term dependence of Iran on the United States and
to foster the convergence of the country's interests with those of the West, and
deepen American involvement in the Iranian oil industry, economy, armed
forces and social institutions.
Washington intervened to find a solution to thenationalization crisis
favourable to American interests. It succeeded inthe formation ofan Inter
national Consortium torun the Iranian oil industry inplace ofthe A.I.O.C.
Details of this consortium's composition will be found in Chapter 20 below:it
included British Petroleum, with a40% share; five American companies, with
8% each; Shell, with 14%; and the Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (C.F.P.),
with 6%. Intheory, the consortium was toact as a customer of the National
Iranian Oil Company. But in practice, while acknowledging Iranian ownership
of the oil industry, the consortium controlled most of Iran's oil, from exploita
tion to pricing and marketing, although Iran received more in royalties, had a
bigger share in company policy than before, and received 50% of the consor
tium's profits.43 The arrangement, the major architects of which were the U.S.
Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, and the petroleum advisor, Herbert
Hoover, Jr, was accepted by both London and Tehran. The latter signed an
agreement with the consortium inNovember 1954,and resumed diplomatic
relations with London shortly after. The settlement of the "nationalization
crisis" wasa major gain for the United States, which wona determining share in
the Iranian oil industry and thecapacity to influence thecountry's economic and
political development. Theagreement fell short of achieving Musaddiq's aim of
nationalization, but revived oil resources asthe major source offoreign ex
change for the Shah's regime. The Shah later remarked that, in the prevailing
circumstances ofhis rule, "itwould have been difficult at that time to have
concluded a better agreement".44
Washington then arranged a multi-million dollar programme of financial and
economic aid for Iran. From 1953 to 1957,when the Shah's rule was passing
through its most difficult phase, American aid amounted toa total of$366.8
million, followed by an average of$45 million per annum for the next three

years. In 1961, when aid wasincreased to an annual level of $107.2 million, Iran
was oneof the major recipients of American economic aid outside the N. A.T.O.
alliance.45 "Along with the inflow of American aid,a large body of U.S. official
advisors and technical experts, employees ofaid agencies and technical and
commercial organizations, and private investors came toIran. They were to
assist the Iranian government in itseconomic planning and allocation of
American aid,provide technical skills, andestablish joint ventures with both the
Iranian government and entrepreneurs, who were now once again confident
that Iran was firmly set indeveloping a free enterprize system."46
The U.S. reinforced itsposition in theIranian oilindustry andeconomy by its
involvement in strengthening the Shah's armed and security forces as the major
instrument of his rule. The Shah hadbeen well disposed towards a slow increase
in American military assistance ever since he received the first American military
advisory mission in 1942. It wasnot, however, until his assumption of effective
power that Washington began to reorganize andbuild up hisarmed and security
forces on a massive scale, to guard against both domestic and regional oppo
sition. In 1957,the C.I.A. helped the Shah to establish the State Intelligence
and Security Organization (Sazman-i Ittilacat va Amniyat-i Kishvar, or
S.A.V.A.K.), which became the Shah's most potent force in dominating Iran. In
all, during 1953—63, total U.S. military grants-in-aid to the Shah's regime
amounted to $535.4 million, the largest post-war military grant to anon
N. A.T.O. country. Thenumber of American military personnel present in Iran
reached some io,ooo.47
Washington also strengthened its position by linking the Shah's regime with
the West within a formal military alliance. Under theexigencies ofthe ColdWar,
Washington had even considered such an alliance with Musaddiq's govern
ment. In February 1953, President Eisenhower hadargued that a U. S. sponsored
"system ofalliance" was required in the region against what hecalled the
"enemies who are plotting our destruction".48 John Foster Dulles envisageda
"Northern Tier" Alliance, comprising Turkey, Pakistan and Iran.49 Although
Musaddiq had opposed such an alliance and the "Northern Tier" scheme never
materialized, largely because ofBritish opposition, Washington induced the

THE SHAH'S RULE
Shah's regime to sign, on n October 1955, theBritish-sponsored defensive
Baghdad Pact, whose other signatories were Iraq, Turkey and Pakistan, and
which the United States wasexpected to join. In July 1958, however, a
"revolutionary" republican group overthrew the pro-British monarchy inIraq
and withdrew that country from the Baghdad Pact. This led to the redesignation
of the Pact as the Central Treaty Organization (C.E.N.T.O.), of which Iran was
a member. Yet once theShah's regime realized that thetreaty was neither
designed to help the regional members in their regional disputes, nor capable of
preventing aradical group from seizing power, Washington found it expedient
to conclude a bilateral military agreement with Tehran inMarch 1959. Under
this treaty, Washington committed itself, incase ofaggression against Iran, to
take "such appropriate actions including theuse of armed force as may be
mutually agreed upon".50 Although afriendly observer, the U.S.A. did not join
C.E.N.T.O.
The extensive U.S. involvement inIran resulted not only in great American
influence upon that country's politics and economic affairs, but also inincreas
ing Western social and cultural influence, "particularly among those educated
urban Iranians who found the Shah's pro-Western stance desirable and benefi
cial [. . .]This influence consolidated the overall structure of Iran's dependence
on and vulnerability tothe United States."51 This implied a narrowing of the
Iranian regime's policy options toapro-Western, mainly pro-American, stance
in its domestic and foreign policy. Thus the regime, both officially and unoffi
cially, tied Iran's national development and foreign policy objectives to the
interests of the West, which ensured Iran's "dependence relationship" with the
United States.52 In this relationship, Washington acted asa "Patron Power",
preserving the Shah's regime and influencing the direction and the content of its
policies in line with western regional and international interests. Iran was largely
subjected tothe role ofa dependent ally, increasingly susceptible to American
dictates. All this confirmed Iran's opposition tocommunism and radical Arab
nationalism, at the cost of its past policy of non-alignment and opposition to any
type of foreign domination. The Shah served as the bridgehead in the process of
this transformation of Iran's position. Hedeclared, in December 1954, that
"Iran hasa great deal in common, in conviction, with theWestern world
(particularly the United States) regarding freedom and democracy. The way of
life of the Western world fits in with ourscheme of Islamic values."53 He
subsequently declared that "Westernization is our ideal", that Iran's interests

were best served in alliance with the West, and that his regime was determined to
combat "internal communism" or"the new totalitarian imperialism" inspired
by Moscow in order to build a modern, strong Iran, replete with "social
justice".54
In return for Iran's dependence on the United States and alliance with the
West, the Shah expected the consolidation of his rule. Extensive American
support enabled him to manipulate the nation in favour of his regime. He
centralized politics to an unprecedented degree around the monarchy, repressed
domestic opposition, and rearranged Iran's national objectives in favour of his
regime. He succeeded in personally formulating a foreign policy that suited both
his domestic policy and, initially, his dependence on the United States.
Although, at first, the Iranian Foreign Ministry played a role in advisingon
foreign policy, he soon reduced its role to that of a policy-implementing body,
and decided major foreign policy issues himself, with some assistance from a
foreign affairs group he created within the Ministry of Court, the latter being an
informal, but effective, government within agovernment, headed by asucces
sion of loyal Court Ministers. Incontrast tothe uncertainties and lack of clear
direction in Iran's foreign affairs during the 1940s and Musaddiq's premiership,
the Shah built and enforced a structured, though dependent, foreign policy.
This position gave a consistency to Iran's dependence on the U.S. and the West,
and to its responses to the changing international environment of the 1950s. He
attributed this to his regime's policy of "positive nationalism", stressing Iran's
reliance on exclusive alliance with the West, and friendship with the countries of
the region that shared his firm opposition to communism and Arab radicalism.55
While helping the Shah toestablish his absolute rule, and Washington to
secure an ally in avital region, the Shah's foreign policy did not prove beneficial
for either side in the long run. Itantagonized the Soviet Union, which perceived
Iran's pro-Western policies, especially within the Baghdad Pact and
C.E.N.T.O., and its military treaty with the United States, as aserious blowto
Soviet regional security and interests. In denouncing the regional pact, Moscow
warned Tehran that its membership was "incompatible with Iran's neighbourly
relations with the Soviet Union and the known treaty obligations of Iran". With
regard to the military treaty, Premier Khrushchev stressed that it would convert
Iran into an American military base, enabling Washington to install missiles on
the Soviet border.56 Despite these outbursts, however, Moscow was careful not

THE SHAH'S RULE
to sever all its links, particularly diplomatic relations, with Iran, fearing that this
would push the Shah's regime further into the Western camp. For its part,
Tehran was interested in maintaining a relationship of some sort with Moscow.
Nonetheless, relations between the two states continued to deteriorate through
out the 1950s.
This coincided with the worsening of Tehran's relations with the Arab
world, particularly the growing radical Arab forces, led by President Nasir of
Egypt. The latter's enthusiasm for revolutionary Arab nationalism, and Pan
Arabism against Zionism, colonialism, imperialism and pro-Western conserva
tism inthe region, left him opposed tothe Shah's regime. President Nasir's
condemnation, supported by the new revolutionary regime in Iraq, of the Shah's
alliance with the West and his defacto recognition of the State of Israel, resulted
not only in the breakdown of diplomatic relations between Cairo and Tehran in
i960,57 but ina reluctance on the part of the pro-Western Arab states, led by
Saudi Arabia, to strengthen their ties with the Shah's regime for fear of possible
reprisals. Moreover, certain other /w/z-Arab countries ofthe region, such as
Afghanistan and India, which had adopted non-aligned positions in world
politics, also had reason to be suspicious of the Shah's regime; Afghanistan had
border disputes with Iran, and Iran's regional ally, Pakistan, and India were
engaged ina struggle over Kashmir.
This growing regional isolation was complicated by the fact that the Shah's
foreign policy meant that he had always to be mindful of U.S. wishes and shifts in
the policies of the West. This situation became such that, in 1961, the Shah was
not allowed to choose his own prime minister, but had to accept Washington's
choice of All Amini, Iran's former Ambassador to the U.S. The Kennedy
administration considered Amini more capable than the Shah of shaping Iran to
America's liking.58 Given the widespread domestic and regional discontent with
his regime, the Shah was powerless against Washington's directives. The Shah's
realization of this made him aware, by the start of the 1960s, that he neededto
make certain changes in his foreign policy. Itwas clear that he could not do this
without first trying towiden his domestic power base. Like Washington,he
recognized the need to initiate a number of social and economic reforms,
although he was at first reluctant to agree with Washington's assessment of the
urgency ofsuch reforms.
The Shah took over areform programme which prime minister All Amini
had initiated with Washington's support; on 26 January 1963, he launched what

he called "The White Revolution", subsequently known as "the Revolutionof
the Shah and the People". The Revolution was to encompass a wide rangeof
innovative changes affecting the whole spectrum of life in Iran. TheShah
visualized this in terms of democracy and Westernization, for social justice, self
sufficiency and political and economic independence, in putative accord with
Islamic values. The reforms involved land redistribution and industrial, educa
tional and administrative "revolution".59 Nomatter how fruitless theWhite
Revolution reforms were forthe Iranian people, the Shah reaped a number of
short-term political gains from them. While maintaining his position inIranian
politics, by thelate 1960s, he "had generated a process of controlled mass
mobilization and opened upnew bases of support among peasants, industrial
workers, women, andyouth, andamong those intellectuals, professionals,
technocrats, and bureaucrats who had previously been unhappy with his regime
for other than ideological reasons. He had stimulated a higher degree of
economic activity, which, together with his mass mobilization, improvedthe
prospects forimmediate social and economic stability, and raised the people's
hopes for abetter future. Iran's middle class grew more quickly than before - a
feature necessary for the Shah's regime inpursuing a guided capitalist mode of
socio-economic development."60
This, together with Iran's growing income from oil, helped the Shah to
improve his regime's domestic image. Together with these improvements, the
Shah had grounds for initiating and pursuing certain changes in his foreign
policy in support of the White Revolution's goal of a "national independent
foreign policy". He declared, "non-interference in the internal affairs of other
countries and peaceful coexistence" tobe the essential principles of this policy.
He stressed: "We must . . . convert peaceful coexistence into international co
operation and understanding especially tocountries with different political and
social systems from ours . . . theestablishment of understanding and peace
cannot be achieved without sincere respect for theprinciple of coexistence
between different ideologies and systems of government, orwithout respect for
the principle of non-interference of countries inthe internal affairs of others."61
The Shah therefore sought thenormalization of Iran's relations with the
Soviet Union at government level, while still opposing communism. Following
his assurance to the Soviet leadership, in 1962, that hewould not permit any
foreign power to have military bases in Iran able to threaten the Soviet Union, he
moved to redress one of the underlying causes of Soviet displeasure, Iran's

membership of C.E.N.T.O. While he had hitherto concentrated on the aspect of
C.E.N.T.O. asa defensive pact, henow stressed the organization's economic
importance. Since it had become clear that C.E.N.T.O. had not been set up to
help solve regional disputes, and that a direct Soviet threat was not imminent,
C.E.N.T.O.'s members formed the Regional Co-operation for Development
(R.C.D.), in July 1964. The latter was to be an adjunct to C.E.N.T.O. in
expanding "thefield of mutual co-operation into those areas where the
C.E.N.T.O. alliance had not been effective".62 The founding members, Iran,
Turkey and Pakistan, originally hoped that Afghanistan and other states of the
region, excluding the U.S.S.R., would join R.C.D., but this was not to be. In the
meantime, in the light of Iran's growing income from oil, and Washington's
confidence that Iran was committed to the West, the Johnson administration
classified Iran as a "developed" country in 1965 and announced its intention to
end American grant-in-aid by November 1967. Since this decision did not affect
Iran's special relationship with the United States, the Shah found it helpful in
normalizing relations with Moscow.
These developments were pleasing to the Kremlin, which realized that onlya
domestically and regionally secure Iran could reduce its dependence on the
United States. Soviet desires to gain access toIranian natural resources, espe
cially natural gas, to improve its regional ties, and to manifest ageneral image of
"friendship" with Afro-Asian countries, made the Kremlin more receptive to
the Shah's gestures. This resulted in the conclusion of two major economic and
military agreements between Iran and the Soviet Union. Under the economic
agreement, signed in January 1966, Iran undertook to supply the U.S.S.R. with
more than $600 million worth of natural gas, beginning in 1970, in return for the
U.S.S.R.'s building Iran's first large steel complex in Isfahan, a machine-tool
plant in Shiraz, and a pipeline from northern Iran tothe Caucasus. Under the
military agreement, initiated inFebruary 1967, Moscow agreed tosupply Iran
with some $110 million worth of light arms in return forthe natural gas.63
The agreements marked a turning point in Iranian—Soviet relations. The
improved ties with the Soviet Union provided the Shah with a new sourceof
technical assistance and bargaining power with the West. It also strengthened
his position against Cairo and Arab radical forces in the region, strengthened his
image with Afghanistan and India, which had developed close ties withthe
U.S.S.R., and reduced the chances of co-operation between his domestic
opposition and hostile regional forces. By the end ofthe 1960s, the Shah was

thereby in a stronger position to conduct Iran's external affairs with greater
independence.
He was also able to participate in the "O.P.E.C. revolution", to challenge the
international oil companies' monopoly of the Iranian oil industry to realize the
country's potential as an "oil power". Although the Shah had supported
Musaddiq's oil nationalization plans, he had disapproved of his "revolutionary"
method ofachieving that objective. While accepting the American solution to
the oil crisis, he was conscious that that solution was far short of what Musaddiq
had wanted to obtain for Iran. He adopted a gradual approach to gaining control
over Iran's oil. This conformed with his alliance with the West at a time when the
international oil companies still controlled Middle Eastern oil industries and the
regional producers were weak and divided. As changes in global politics and the
world oil market allowed, Iran set outin theearly 1970s fully to exploit
O.P.E.C.'s collective strength against the weakening position of the oil compan
ies. The Shah played a determining role in leading O.P.E.C. to a policy of "price
rise, price and production control", between 1970 and 1975. He made use of
every development, including the Arab—Israeli war of1973 and the consequent
Arab oil embargo, torealise the new policy, posing as the champion of the oil
producers and of the Third World against "domination and exploitation".64
By 1974, the Shah had substantially achieved Musaddiq's aims of Iranian
control and had realized Iran's potential as an oil power. This brought the Shah's
regime unprecedented wealth and diplomatic strength, with increasing influ
ence inregional and world politics. Industrialized countries found themselves
more dependent than ever before on Iranian oil, given themilitancyand
"unreliability" of the Arab producers. They found itexpedient to acknowledge
the position ofthe Shah, and set out towin his favour in order to secure the
recycling ofoil revenue to the West.
This occurred against the background of other developments. In the late
1960s, Britain announced that, by theendof 1971, as part of its overall
withdrawal from East of Suez, itwould pull out its forces from the Persian Gulf,
which had been under British protection for over a century. Secondly, there was
an increase in the activities ofrevolutionary groups inthe Persian Gulf. The
most active and publicized of these was the Popular Front for the Liberation of
the Arab Gulf (P.F.L.O.A.G.). This group, opposed to the pro-Western
governments of the Gulf, had turned Dhofar, the southern-most province of the
Sultanate of Oman, into a centre of revolutionary activity, challenging the

authority of the Omani government.65 Thirdly, theborder dispute between Iran
and Iraq over the Shatt al-cArab waterway, andtheir ideological differences, had
resulted in anumber of frontier clashes.66 Meanwhile, Iran's C.E.N.T.O. ally,
Pakistan, was weakened as the country's eastern flank seceded with full Indian
military support in 1971,to form Bangladesh. This development encouraged the
Baluchi and Pushtoon movements, backed by Afghanistan, tointensify their
demand for independence orautonomy inPakistan's Baluchistan and North
West Frontier Provinces.67 These developments were accompanied by
Moscow's growing friendship with India, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia andthe
P.D.R. Y., to which Ethiopia, Angola and Mozambique were soon to be added;
and by sporadic but increasing acts of urban terrorism against the Shah's regime
within Iran, acts which the Shah attributed to the growth of religious and leftist
opposition tohis rule, from what he called "Islamic Marxists".68
The Shah could neither overlook these developments, nor avoid perceiving
them on thebasis of his owninterests andunderstanding of the region. With the
growing significance ofthe Persian Gulf, which provided Iran with its best
outlet for exports, particularly oil, through the strategically located Strait of
Hurmuz, the Shah agreed with London and Washington that the intended
British withdrawal from the Gulf might create a power vacuum, which the
Soviets and radical Arabs might fill unless Iran were prepared to take over some
of the formerly British role. Moreover, the Shah could not help but seethe hand
of Moscow and its allies in the disturbances which increasingly threatened the
stability ofIran and the region.
The Shah therefore re-evaluated Iran's regional position. Heset outto
transform Iran into a regional power. This wasunderstandable in thelight of his
vastly expanded oil-based financial and political power, and Washington's
desire to apply the "Nixon Doctrine" to Iran. This doctrine, coming in the wake
of America's humiliation inIndo-China was "to construct a world systemin
which the United States, thecentral power, would help generate strong regional
actors, who would secure their own and American interests in their respective
regions".69 The Shah resolved to achieve several objectives. Iran was totake

over Britain's role as the regional power in the Persian Gulf after its withdrawal,
and resist any attempt by outside powers, especially the Soviet Union, to replace
Britain. The Shah considered this essential for the security of Iran and the Gulf
against foreign or regionally sponsored subversion; for ensuring uninterrupted
passage through the Strait ofHurmuz, the Shatt al-cArab, and the Gulf asa
whole; for protecting Iranian oil resources and facilities on- and off-shore in the
Gulf against sabotage or destruction; and for boosting the psychological
stability of the smaller Gulf states, which in the past had relied upon Britain
against threats in the region. Iran was to continue to pursue an anti-communist
policy, since it needed to continue to strengthen its national defences in
convergence with Western interests, against possible direct or indirect hostile
Soviet action. However, this did not have to undermine good relations with the
U.S.S.R. Nevertheless, Iran had to acquire the capability to deter the rise ofany
Soviet-backed or leftist force in the region, south and south-east of its borders. It
had to conduct balanced relations with allfriendly or potentially friendly
countries of the region. These countries comprised, onthe one hand, the
moderate and conservative Arab states, including Egypt under President
Anwar al-Sadat, who succeeded Nasir following the latter's death in 1970, and
had set out to disentangle Egypt from the tentacles of the U.S.S.R. in the hope of
securing better ties with the U.S.and peace with Israel; and on the other, Iran's
weak regional ally, Pakistan, as well as Afghanistan and India. With regardto
the last three, in the process of balancing relations, Iran sought to strengthen its
alliance with Pakistan; to support it against further dismemberment; to mediate
between Pakistan and its neighbours; and tohelp Afghanistan and Pakistan
reduce their dependence on Soviet aid.70
By the early 1970s, the Shah defined the Iranian region ofinterest well
beyond the geographical perimeters of West and Central Asia and the Persian
Gulf; "I will not state how many kilometres we have in mind, but anyone who is
acquainted with geography and the strategic situation, and especially with the
potential of air and sea forces, knows what distance from Chah Bahar this limit
can reach."71 He set out to turn Iran, as rapidly as possible, into a paramount
regional power, capable of maintaining the regional status quo in accordance
with Iran's changing interests, in pursuance of what the Shah later declared tobe
his ultimate goal: Tamaddun-iBut(urg (The Great Civilization).72 He therefore

intensified his efforts, on the basis of Iran's increasing oil wealth, and with the
full support ofthe United States' Nixon Doctrine, and the West's desire to
recycle oilrevenues, to build upIran's military and economic capabilities,
thereby substantiating Iran's claim to be a military power. In May 1972,
President Nixon assured the Shah that theUnited States would sell him anything
short of nuclear weapons.73 The Shah engaged in intensive diplomacy to ensure
that Iranian oil revenues secured the maximum of capital goods, expertise,
technology and sophisticated weaponry, and to sell Iranian products abroad on
the best possible terms. He gave aid to countries that would help him secure his
political ends, and attempted to gain the backing ofinfluential individuals,
organizations and governments to improve international perception ofhis
leadership.
The Shah increased state expenditure in accordance with increases in Iranian
oil revenue, and undertook accelerated industrialization in the hope of eventu
ally creating a non-oil-based, self-sufficient economy, since he estimated that
Iranian oil would be exhausted by the end of the century. He ordered revision of
Iran's Fifth Economic Development Plan (1973—8), which took effect inlate
1974. He declared that this would be "equal toall four previous plans com
bined". He promised that, by the end of the Fifth Plan, Iran "will be in a quite
distinguished and unprecedented position", leading the country tothe thres
hold of the "Great Civilization". He declared that the overall objective of the
Plan was "to achieve a stage at which the Iranian society, enjoying utmost
privileges of social and economic development, could betransferred into a
strong . . . and most advanced [industrial society] ofmodern times".74
The Shah planned that the industrial development of Iran be coupled with
the emergence of the country as a military power. He stated that, "In view ofthe
regional andinternational problems, the strengthening and consolidation ofthe
country's defence power [should] enjoy special priority . . . so that itshould act
as the main factor in safeguarding the country's stability and independence,
maintaining the precious fruits of economic and social expansion and securing
Iran, as before, as an area of peace and reliance in today's turbulent world".75 He
therefore embarked on a multi-billion dollar programme tobuild one of the
most impressive military forces in the region, aspiring that Iran would become
the world's fifth conventional military power by the end of the 1980s. As a U.S.

and 1981 ofequipment ordered todate, Iran, on paper, can be regarded as a
regional super-power".76
Although the Shah sought to undertake his economic and military drive with
equipment from various sources, including the Soviet Union, the United States
remained the major supplier. "Under the agreement [of August 1976] trade
between the two sides was to rise from $10,000 million between 1974 and 1976 to
$40,000 million during 1976—1980; and their military trade, which had totalled
about Si0,000 million between 1973 and 1976, was tobe extended by another
$ 15,000 million during the same period." In November 1977, President Carter
pledged himself to support the Shah, and praised him as a"strong leader", and
Iran as"a stabilizing force in the world at large".77
Although Iran's regional policy lacked a definite pattern, it manifested two
consistent concerns: the Shah's persistance with what he called "regional co
operation", and his opposition to what he perceived as "communist-subver
sive" forces within Iran and the region. The Shah sought touse the formerto
acquire consensus in support ofthe latter, which resulted in Iranian military
intervention inthe region.
He also sought to settle some of Iran's disputes with its neighbours and use
oil wealth to offer capital aid, inreturn for the opening of new sources ofraw
materials and markets for Iranian products. He hoped to expand the concept of
the Regional Co-operation for Development to form a "common market". He
succeeded in resolving several disputes. Following the trilateral settlement
between Iran, Britain and the U.N. of the Bahrain problem, which entailed
Iran's abandoning its traditional claim to this British protectorate in 1969, an act
of self-determination bythe Bahraini people, under U.N. auspices in 1970,
resulted in the independence of the island.78 The Shah also resolved some
territorial and off-shore differences with the Persian Gulf's littoral Arab states, a
border difference with Afghanistan, and the long-standing border dispute,
chiefly over the Shatt al-cArab, with Iraq. Inthe latter case, the Shah used his
economic and military power and diplomatic skill to induce the Iraqi regimeto
sign an agreement in March 1975. The agreement provided for joint control of
the Shatt al-cArab and demarcation of land frontiers, and called on the two sides
to end their support for hostile groups against one another, including Iran's
support ofIraq's Kurds. Both sides resolved todevelop good relations inall
fields, and agreed that the Persian Gulf be free from foreign intervention,an

THE SHAH'S RULE
issue stressed by the Shah and affirmed by Iraq.79 The Shah also stepped up his
efforts for mediation between Pakistan and its neighbours, Afghanistan and
India, in their border disputes, and promised financial aid to all three countries.80
Since Egypt's position had changed under President Sadat, the Shah developed
close ties with that country insupport ofa common anti-communist perspec
tive, and also provided, orpromised, aid to Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco
and the Sudan. In1974, he suggested that the nations from Australia to the Gulf
Arab states should join Iran informing a "common market". Under pressure
from India, hesubsequently limited his notion ofthe market tothe Gulf and
Iran's eastern flank, but the scheme never materialized.81
The Shah was never specific inhis stance against communism and subver
sion. He considered all those who opposed his objectives, whether for religious,
ideological, or pragmatic reasons, as subversive. He took a resolute stand
against the opposition at home, and engaged in a number of limited military
adventures in the region. These included the occupation ofthe islands of the
Great and Small Tumbs; and the acquisition of Abu Musa in the Persian Gulf at
the Strait of Hurmuz, shortly before the British withdrawal in 1971, sincehe
considered that the strategic location of these islands might enable a subversive
force toblock the Strait ofHurmuz, ifundefended by Iran; the deployment of
some 3,000 Iranian troops in Oman from 1972, which, by 1977, succeeded in
suppressing the P.F.L.O.A.G.; military assistance to Zu3l-Fiqar All Bhutto's
government in Pakistan from 1971 to 1977 against the Baluchi and Pushtoon
resistance movements seeking autonomy; andto Muhammad Said Barre's
government in Somalia which, in 1977, loosened its ties with the U.S.S.R. and
sought aid from the West against thenew Soviet-backed Marxist-Leninist
government in Ethiopia. In the hope ofbuilding a formal framework forhis
anti-subversion policy, he even proposed the formation of a regional "collective
security" arrangement in the Gulf.82
However, his drive totransform Iran into a formidable policing and deter
rent power was over-ambitious and short-sighted. He had to rely on western
countries, particularly the United States, for key resources, especially expertise
and arms. By 1977, it was clear that the Shah's economic and military pro
grammes faced difficulties in meeting their targets. His economic efforts and
selective social reforms had failed to generate the necessary base for the success
of his military build-up, while the latter hadtaken a heavy toll on Iran's
development. His regional policies of "co-operation" and "anti-subversion"

were undermined by his claim to economic and military supremacy, which few
states of the region accepted. Nor did they welcome his proposals for a regional
"common market" and arrangements for "collective security", which they saw
Iran as keen to dominate. While his policies of economic, industrial and military
build-up caused imbalance inside Iran, they made other states, particularly the
oil producers and India, question the Shah's motives. This resulted in a regional
arms race. The fall of the Afghan government of Muhammad DaDud in apro
Moscow communist coup in April 1978 also showed the failure of the Shah's
regional anti-communist policy. By the time that mass opposition threatened the
Shah's rule, all that he could claim was to be a "dependent regional power", a
"power that achieved certain economic and military capabilities based on oil
income, but that lacked the self-generating potential to sustain itself and
function effectively without heavy long-term reliance on the United States".83
Even this was not sufficient, and the Shah was rejected in 1978 by his own
people, as a "stooge" of the United States, placed and sustained in power by
Americans, and an "enemy" of the Iranian people. In the face of this uprising,
which the Shah's military forces were unable, and ultimately unwilling, to quell,
Washington could do nothing but abandon its support for the Shah, and reflect
bitterly on events. The Shah was forced to leave Tehran on 16 January 1979, for
exile abroad. His opponent Ayatullah Khumaini returned, after 14 years of exile,
to put an end to the Persian monarchy and establish the Islamic Republic of Iran.

CHAPTER I3
LAND TENURE AND REVENUE
ADMINISTRATION IN THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY
The Qajar land system was inherited from the Safavids and goes back through
the ilkhans and Saljuqs to the early centuries ofIslam. The earlier systems had
resulted from the historical incidents ofconquest and had been moulded by local
custom and thetheory of the sharlca. This was also to some extent true of the
Qajar system, but though there was a correspondence between it and the earlier
systems there was not necessarily identity between them. Although abuses
similar tothose found inWestern European feudalism, such asthe existenceof
private armies andthe subjection of the peasantry, were associated with the
Qajar land system, and although there wasa close connection between the
revenue assessment and thelevy of troops, it was not, in the technical sense, a
feudal system, and nor had itdeveloped out ofa feudal system. Itis tobe seen not
only in relation to the idea of property but also against the background of
demographic movements andeconomic change.
The urban life and extensive commerce which had developed under the
Safavids had been severely damaged by the disorders which had followed the fall
of that dynasty. Agriculture suffered from thegeneral recession of the eight
eenth century and wasprobably also adversely affected by the depopulation
which occurred in some parts ofthe country atthe time ofthe Afghan invasion
and in the latter years of Nadir Shah. The nineteenth century witnessed a
reversal of these trends, but the revival was not uniform throughout the country
or throughout thecentury. Lack of communications continued to impede the
movement of goods andto accentuate regional isolation.
The sharica recognizes the right of property to rest upon two types of
appropriation: the first that of individuals, expressed in the phrase al-nas
musallatunzalaamwalihim} and the second that ofthe Muslim community, which
derived from conquest. It recognizes also the right ofalienation and the fact that
various rights and easements can beexercised over property or may accrue to
1 "Men are incontrol oftheir possessions." This phrase isused by al-ShafVl and other jurists after him. Cf.also the phrase man qutila dunmalihifa huwa sbabld(zl-Suyuti, al-Jamfal-saghlr n, p. 435), "he who is killed in defence of his property is a martyr".

individuals from its possession. Shaikh Ja'far Kashif al-Ghita° (d. 1812), the well
known Ithna- Ashari jurist, asserts the sanctity ofprivate property inhis work
Kashj' al-ghita\ inwhich he states "the property ofa Muslim, and not only the
property of a Muslim, but all property, such as the lawful property of an infidel,
is sacred and immune".2 He also states "No one has any power over the property
of another."3
Perhaps because it was tacitly assumed that Muslim property rested largely
on the right of conquest, the jurists, whether Sunni or Shfi, discuss the
classification of land and the taxes which were levied upon it, namely cushr(tithe)
and kharaj, primarily in those sections of their works which are devoted tojihad,
though the fiscal and financial obligations which derive from the ownership and
exploitation of land are also mentioned under %akatand tijarat (trade). Many
treatises were written onkharaj and the various interpretations put upon it by
the jurists, both Sunni and ShILT. All regarded itas asharc7obligation due on land
to which the conditions ofkharaj applied. Hence the first task was to establish
the tenure of the land. This involved at allperiods, including the nineteenth
century, reference to the early conquests and the works of former jurists.
The Ithna-Ashari jurist, Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-TiisI (385—460/995
1067-8), whose exposition forms thebasis for thework of many later Shici
writers, recognizes four kinds of land:
(i) land left inthe possession ofits inhabitants who had, oftheir own accord,
accepted Islam: such land paid cushr (tithe) or mm cushr (half tithe). It
remained their property andthey hadthe right to buyand sell it,to
constitute itinto vaqf, and, provided that they cultivated it, to exercise every
kind of possession over it. Ifthey ceased tocultivate itand abandoned it so
that it fell out of cultivation, it became the property of the Muslim
community, and it was for theimam to give it to someone who would
undertake its cultivation, paying half, onethird or onequarter of its
produce as arent, and cushr or mm cushr to the treasury after he had deducted
the rent and the expenses of cultivation.
(ii) Land conquered bythe sword, kharaj land: this belonged to the Muslim
community. It was forthe imam, orthat person who was incharge of the
affairs of the Muslims, to give it, as he saw fit, to someone who would
undertake its cultivation, paying as a rent tothe treasury half, one third or
one quarter ofits produce, and cushrormm cushron what remained to him

after that. Such land could not be bought or sold, made into private
property, or constituted into vaqf, or given asa gift byway ofsadaqa. On
expiry ofthe agreement, the imam had the right totransfer the property to
someone else. It was for the imam totake possession of it as the interests of
the Muslims demanded. Such land belonged to all theMuslims and its
usufruct was to bedivided among them.
(iii) Land held by %immh, who hadmade a sulh agreement (i.e. a treaty of
capitulation) with the imam, according to which they paid one half, one
quarter, or some other fraction of its produce to the treasury. The holders of
such land exercised full rights ofpossession over the land. When thesulh
agreement expired, it was for the imam toincrease ordecrease the payment
made. If a Muslim bought such land, itbecame his property and he exercised
over it full rights of possession and ownership.
(iv) Anfal, i.e. all land which had been abandoned by its owners or become dead
land and been revived, forest land, land which had been newly brought into
cultivation, land on thetops of mountains, river-beds, mines, and the
crown lands of former rulers — all these belonged to the imam. Itwas for him
to take possession of them, tokeep them, give them away, or sell them as he
saw fit, and to impose upon them half, one third or one quarter of the
produce asrent. When the term of the agreement expired, hecould take
them away from the holder and give them to someone else, except inthe
case of dead land which had been revived, when the one who revived it had
priority. Should the latter be unwilling to continue its cultivation, itwas for
the imam to give it to whomsoever he saw fit, such person then being
responsible for the payment ofcushror nimcushr,after the deduction of the
rent payable to theperson who hadrevived theland andthecosts of
cultivation. In the case of dead land, the owner of which was known, it was
incumbent upon the person who revived it to pay the rent to the owner,
who could not deprive him of the land as long as he wished to cultivate it. If
the land had no owner, itbelonged to the imam and itwas incumbent upon
the person who revived it topay rent tothe imam, who could only take it
away from him and give ittoanother inthe event of his failing tocultivate
it. The person who revived theland could sell his right of possession

LAND TENURE AND LAND REVENUE
The fact that none of the Ithna- cAshari ShIcI imams, with the exception of
cAli, the first Imam, had held political power and that during the occultation
{ghaiba) allgovernment was regarded as "unjust" (see pp. 71 iff.), limitedthe
operation ofthese laws. Faced with the problem of whether to co-operate with
an "unrighteous" government, the general body of believers, admitting that
coercive government was necessary, held that in ordinary circumstances col
laboration was incumbent upon believers. Life had togo on and livelihood and
property had to beprotected, and so in general terms the rule of the de facto
holder ofpower was accepted. Further, it was held that the duty topay kharaj,
since it was a sharcl obligation, did not lapse when the ruler was illegitimate.
With the rise of the Safavids in the ioth/i6th century, when the Ithna- cAsharI
Shlca formed apolitical organization, the question ofthe tenure of the land and
the levy and expenditure of kharaj acquired anew urgency and bitter controver
sies occurred among the Qulama. Shaikh A.1I b. Husain b. cAbd al- CAH al-Karakl
in his treatise entitled J2<Z//C at al-lajaj fi hillal-kharaj,written in 916/151o— 11, held
that permission was given bythe Imams to their shlca, i.e. their followers, to
take possession ofzanwa land during the ghaiba and toexercise over it rightsof
ownership and disposal. Shaikh Majid b. Falah al-Shaibani, writing rather later,
is explicit onthis point and states that allland bought or inherited belonged
during the ghaiba to those who held it.
Al-Karaki affirms that in the ghaiba the Imam permitted their shica to receive
kharaj from unjust rulers {salatin al-jaur). After adetailed discussion of the early
conquests, the tenure of conquered lands, the levy of kharaj and the expenditure
of its proceeds, he states that the purposes on which the proceeds of kharaj were
expended, namely the allowances of fighters for the faith, governors, judges and
others charged with public office, were not suspended during the ghaiba.
Further, the duty of those who worked the land of the Muslims to pay kharaj did
not lapse; itwas tobe paid into the public treasury {baital-mal), tothe revenues
of which the Muslims had a right. He also maintains that kharaj land could be
alienated and that those to whom ithad been alienated could dispose of it by sale
or gift, make itinto vaqf or transmit itby inheritance. Kharaj was thus legal even

Ibrahim al-Qatifi, on the other hand, was uncompromizing in his rejection of
the legality of kharaj during the ghaiba. In his refutation ofal-Karakfs work,

was therefore not legally kharaj even though it might be collected by the bait al
mal as kharaj. Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Ardablli (d. 993/1585) also held that
kharaj was illegal during the ghaiba.5
Although treatises on these subjects continued to be written in later cen
turies, no major changes are tobe found ineither the classification of the landor
its taxation. It would seem that a consensus was reached among the culama that
kharaj was legal. Shaikh Jacfar, who deals fully with land laws under jihad,
following the same general lines as Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-Tusi, concedes
the possibility of action bythe holder ofpower during the occultation of the
Imam and so implicitly extends the operation of these laws tolater periods when
power was in the hands of "unrighteous" rulers. Towards the end of sub-section
three in section nine on jihad he states,
If land in Arabia, Persia, India orelsewhere was inMuslim hands, and onwhich their amirs had imposed kharaj, itwas to be treated as land conquered by force and its produce was to be spent on the well-being of the Muslims, whether ithad been conquered by "the people oftruth" among the Muslims [i.e. the Shica] orby the people ofcorruption [i.e. Muslims who were not Shici] in the time of the imam or during the occultation. If the writ of one of the successors [caliphs] of the prophet (upon him and his family be peace) ran, he, or the deputy he appointed over the matter, had authority over the land to give itas a qabala,6 to lease it, or to make itfree to whomsoever he wished and to expend its revenue on the wellbeing ofthe Muslims . . . Ifthe caliph's writ does not run, the na°ib al-camm from among the great culamd will exercise authority inthis matter. Itis not permitted to anyone to take possession [of the land] except with his permission so long as he exercises this authority and reference tohim is easy. Otherwise authority isvested inthe Muslim governors who assemble militia and soldiers who know how to defend Muslim territory and the Muslims, and they [the Muslim governors] will lease it orgive it as aqabdla to whomsoever they will and spend its revenue on soldiers and militia who protect Islamic territory and the roads of the Muslims and prevent aggression against them by tyrants.It is not permitted to take possession of this land except with his [the Muslim governor's] permission.
Finally Shaikh Jacfar states:
And inthis time it isnot permitted toanyone toexercise possession [tasarruf] [of land conquered by force] during the time ofthe occultation except by the permission ofthe mujtahids, provided there is no sultan whose attention isdirected towards the well-being of the affairs of the Muslims - but if such a one exists itis forbidden to exercise possession

without his permission. And whoever is seen tohave some landed estates [amlak\inhis possession and there is a presumption that he may be their owner, they will be considered as his property.7
It ispossible that the theory that the Shah was the ultimate owner ofthe land
(see further below) may have developed out of this recognition by the jurists that
the rights of the Imam with regard to certain classes of land were exercised by the
holders of temporal power. Inany case, from the fact that the jurists recognized
the validity of action by the holders of temporal power in matters concerning the
land, itfollowed that the theory of the sharlca would continue to play apart, even
if a somewhat uneasy one, and would continue toinfluence the classification of
the land and the basic rates of taxation. Further, the possibility always remained
of reactivating the theory, so far as it had fallen into abeyance. Thus, during the
reign ofthe Afghan Mahmud, who overthrew the Safavids in 1722, zfatva was
issued declaring that the kingdom had been taken by force and therefore
belonged to thebait al-mal.8
It is more difficult to determine what was the position with regard to the right
of property under local custom. This differed from place to place, particularly in
tribal districts, where customary law tended to be stronger than elsewhere.9
Whatever its influence in practice, custom could not, by the nature of the case, be
seen asa rival to the religious law, and sothere is nowritten body of material
upon which to draw, nor can it beassumed that what prevailed in one district
necessarily held good in another. The pre-eminence of the sharica was not
disputed, however much it might becontravened inpractice. Malcolm hasan
interesting passage which illustrates this. Discussing the situation ofthe king's
officers, he states,
nor has he [the Shah] a right to seize or confiscate any property which their family possessed before they entered his service and which is guarded by legal titles, and has either been granted to, orpurchased by them or their ancestors. Such property isunder the peculiar protection of the Sherrah; and the violent seizure ofit would bea most tyrannical outrage. However, itcontinually occurs, that, when the king imposes aheavy

Customary recognition of property rights did not of itself, any more than
sharcl recognition, ensure their maintenance. Governments, themselves origin
ally established byforce and conquest, sofarasthey maintained the rights of
individual property only did sountil another and stronger usurped them. The
essentially arbitrary nature of kingship and of the activities of the king's officers
resulted in the repeated reallocation andredistribution of land, not to say
usurpation oftitle. The Qajar period was no exception tothis. Supporters and
favourites were rewarded bygrants of land: opponents and defeated enemies
were punished and weakened bythe confiscation of their lands. Thus, Agha
Muhammad Khan, after hehad established his power, allowed the Tiirkmens
among whom his father, Muhammad Hasan Khan, had frequently taken refuge
when in difficulty, to remove from the banks ofthe Atrak tothe rich plain of
Gurgan and gave them villages intuyulon. the banks of the Qara Su.11 Fath cAli
Shah, in 1806, assigned to cAbd al-Rahim Pasha, the governor ofBaban, who
had been turned out by CA1I Pasha, the vail ofBaghdad, and taken refuge at the
Persian court, adistrict of Kurdistan where he and his 5,000 tribal followers and
dependents might reside.12 Some years later, after he had driven Mustafa Khan
Talish, who had fought onthe side ofthe Russians in 1812, out of Lankaran,
Fath CA1I Shah distributed the whole of Persian Talish among the remaining
families, confirming to each such portions of the country as it hadbecome
possessed of and created them khans by way of increasing their importance, with
a view to weakening the power of the family of Mustafa Khan.13
It isconceivable that the Qajar rulers regarded their empire as having been
taken by the sword — as indeed itwas — and therefore as vesting in themselves, in
the same way as land taken by the sword had belonged tothe Muslim commu

Mazandaran) like a conquered nation; and his only concern is how to extract
from them the greatest possible amount ofmoney."15 No doctrine concerning
the land other than the sharcl doctrine, however, was clearly enunciated, andit
would seem that the government was mainly interested inland from the fiscal
rather than the tenurial point of view. There was,however, acurious episode in
1844. Muhammad Shah, on the occasion of disputes between the Persian
government and the Russian government over the payment ofdebts bybank
rupts toforeign subjects, issued afarman dated Jumada I 1260/May—June 1844
to Bahman MIrza, who at the time was governor ofAzarbaijan. Inthis itwas
stated that three parties had aright to landed property in Persia, namely the royal
diwan, the proprietor, and the cultivators, and that should the proprietor wish
to mortgage his property, he must previously obtain permission from the other
two parties.16 This theory, however, does not appear tohave been put forward
in other contexts and sofarasthe cultivators were concerned there is little to
show that they were generally regarded as having any right to the land as distinct
from a right to the crops which they had planted.
E.B. Eastwick, writing in 1861, states that "it seems to have been the original
idea in Persia, as in Turkey, that thefee-simple of all lands belonged to the
king".17 Major (later Sir) Percy Sykes, writing in 1910, also appears to have
believed the government to be the real proprietor of all the land.18 In the absence
of any systematic doctrine, these statements must be accepted with reserve.At
the same time, the fact that the ruler assigned fiscal rights and jurisdiction over

Subsequently on 19 Zu3l-Hijja 1270/12 September 1854a notice was inserted in theofficial gazette (Ku^nama-yi vaqayi'-i ittifaqiyyd)tothe effect that the subjects offoreign powers residing in Persia orengaged in mercantile pursuits could not become the owners of landed property and that the Persian government had reserved the right from ancient times tomake possession ofland by foreigners dependent upon three conditions: first the permission of the Shah, secondly theconsent of the proprietor, and thirdly the satisfaction of the peasants. If, however, such a right had ever been reserved, which is doubtful, it had fallen into abeyance. During thereigns of Fath AIT Shah and Muhammad Shah foreigners had bought land freely; and only inexceptional cases had the permission ofthe Shah been sought. On 12 August 1857, the official gazette again referred to the notice of 1854and added a paragraph invalidating any sales of land to foreigners which had been sealed bythe provincial authorities only and notbythe Shah. Such sales of property had hitherto been legalised in the provincial capitalsby the seals of the local governors and fiscal authorities. Henceforward title deeds were only tobe considered valid if the government had given itspermission for the transfer of the property and the deed had been registered in the offices of the central government and the Ministry ofForeign Affairs {GreatBritain,PublicKecordOffice, F.O.6o: 218.

of escheat.
In the first half of the nineteenth century, the territorial structure of the Qajar
empire, apart from the contraction of its frontiers, did not differ in broad outline
from that ofearlier Persian empires. It consisted ofprovinces under provincial
governors appointed by and more or less closely attached to the central
government and provinces under tributaries who, while acknowledging the
nominal sovereignty of the Shah, remained autonomous in their local affairs.
This was also true ofmany local tribal chiefs and large landowners. The most
powerful ofthe tributaries was the vail ofArdalan, who was virtually indepen
dent. Many ofhis followers passed the summer inArdalan and removed tothe
neighbourhood of Baghdad in winter, habitually crossing the Ottoman—Persian
frontier. From the reign of Fath CAHShah onwards, the province of Ardalan was
brought under a greater degree of control bythe central government, but it
remained under local governors until 1868 when Farhad Mirza Muctamid al
Daula, the uncle ofNasir al-Din Shah, was made governor on the death ofthe
vall^ Ghulam Shah Khan.
The district of Bakhtiyari, which under the Safavids had formed a semi
independent government, was included inthe province ofIsfahan. Inthe early
19th century the Chahar Lang Bakhtiyari chief, Muhammad Taqi Khan, hardly
admitted the interference of government officials in the country under his
jurisdiction, but paid a small tribute and provided a small body ofsoldiers. He
owned many villages inFiraidan and also farmed the Ram Hurmuz plain from
the governor ofShlraz. When Manuchihr Khan Muctamad al-Daula, the gover
nor ofIsfahan, demanded arrears of tribute from him in 1840 he temporized,
being unwilling to risk war. He was then accused ofrebellion, and Manuchihr
Khan, who had marched through the Bakhtiyari district to the south, intending
also tocollect arrears oftaxation from Shushtar, Dizful and Khuzistan, seized
and murdered him.19 The Bakhtiyari district continued thereafter to be adminis
tered from Isfahan. It was opened up during the latter part of the reign of Nasir
al-Din Shah, but the Bakhtiyari tribes, although called upon to pay taxes and
provide soldiers, continued toenjoy aconsiderable degree of freedom from the
interference of government officials.

plshkash ("gifts") by way of tribute, butfor the rest administered their own
affairs. Inthe latter part of the reign of Nasir al-DIn Shah there was an attempt,
which met with some success, tobring cArabistan, and the tribes inhabiting it,
under closer government control. Luristan, which hadalso formed a semi
independent government under the Safavids, continued to enjoy a considerable
degree of independence while coming, usually, under the jurisdiction of the
governor of Kirmanshah, Azarbaijan also had a large tribal population. The
largest andmost powerful of the tribes in that province, the Afshar, were
attached atan early period to the Qajar cause, but in the wild mountain country
to the west and south ofUrmlya there were Kurdish and other groups, which
were from time to time in open revolt. The tribal chiefs along the Aras River
between Georgia and Azarbaijan, while usually recognizing the overlordship of
Persia, sometimes sought the protection of Russia.
The Turkmen tribes in the north-east, the Guklan (Goklen) between
Astarabad and the Atrak and the Yamut between the Atrak and Khiva, were
only loosely attached to the Persian government, while the Tekke inhabiting the
region between the source of the Atrak and Marv, although nominally under
Persian suzerainty, were outside its control. When Aqa Muhammad marched on
Mashhad in 1796, various local chiefs, including Amir Guna Khan Zacfaranlu of
Khabushan and Ishaq Khan ofTurbat-i Haidari joined him. On his death only
Mashhad and the districts along the main road to the capital remained in the
hands of the central government, andeven these suffered inroads from the
Tiirkmens. Turbat-i Haidari, Kalat-i Nadirl, Darra Gaz, Bujnurd, Chinaran,
Khabushan, Turshiz, Tabas and Qa°in openly defied the governor of Khurasan,
and itwas not until 1831—2 that cAbbas Mirza finally forced the submission of all
the most turbulent chiefs, deposing the Ilkhanl of the Kurdish tribes of
Khabushan and replacing him by his son. Rebellion again broke out at the end of
the reign of Muhammad Shah. Asaf al-Daula, the governor of Khurasan, was
recalled in 1847. His son, Salar al-Daula, continued the rebellion and was joined
by Jacfar Quli Khan of Bujnurd. In 1848 they seized Mashhad. The city was
besieged by the royal troops and fell in 1850. Salar was put todeath but Jacfar
Quli Khan made his peace with the government and was appointed governor of
Astarabad. That the government maintained the local leaders in power in
Khabushan and Bujnurd in spite oftheir rebellion is witness toits inability to
bring thetribal districts under itsdirect control. Sistan, Baluchistan andthe

government forcibly asserting possession of western Baluchistan in 1866 and
occupying Sistan.
The Qajar kingdom wasthus not,at least in its early years, a highly
centralized or uniform kingdom, and in matters of social organization, land
tenure and land revenue there was, infact, much local variation. Inthe second
half of the nineteenth century there was an increase in centralization andthe
authority of the government wasgradually extended to the more remote
districts.
Estimates of the total population vary widely. No general census was carried
out over the country asa whole in the nineteenth century. General Gardane,
writing in 1807, estimates the total population at nine million at the most.20 This
may have been an over-estimation. SirJohn Malcolm is more cautiousand
thinks that a figure of six million might be more nearly correct, though he points
out theimpossibility of arriving at an accurate estimate on thebasis of the
available information.21 By the middle ofthe century the population may have
been nine or ten millions. In the 1850s and 1860s the population increase was
limited by periodic outbreaks of famine andcholera22 andby 1868 it was
probably no more than nine and ahalf to ten millions. From 1869—72 there wasa
country-wide famine accompanied by cholera and other epidemics. This
brought about a sharp decrease inthe total population. Estimates ofthe loss of
life vary, but theprobable figure is about oneanda half million. On this
assumption the population would have been no more than eight toeight and a
half millions in 1873. In the last quarter of the century there was renewed growth
and by the end ofthe century the population was probably about ten millions.

This list, compiled from the reports ofBritish officials in Persia at the time, while it does not give a full record ofthe loss of life occasioned by outbreaks of cholera, gives an indication of the magnitude ofthe figures. Outbreaks of plague, smallpox and typhus, with high mortality rates, were also frequent.

Throughout thecentury there were considerable regional fluctuations in the
distribution of population, due not only to famine and epidemics, which
sometimes resulted in thedepopulation of villages or whole districts, butalso to
internal disorders andto commercial movements. Theratio between urban and
rural population varied; and their relations were affected in some parts ofthe
country by thepart-time employment of the rural population in urban districts.
In the last thirty years of the century there wasa marked growth in the size of
many towns. This wasdueboth to an influx of peasants and, to some extent, of
nomads, andalso to a migration from thelesser towns to theprovincial centres.
Tehran in the 1840s had, during the winter months when the Shah wasin
residence, a population of 90,000. In 1846 and 1852 cholera reduced the number
so that thepopulation fell to about 70,000. In 1873, after thegreat famine years,
the population of Tehran was probably again at about this figure. By 1891, it had
risen to 210,000 andby 1900 to 2 5 0,000. Tabriz, which was thelargest city of the
empire in the middle of the century with a population of about 130,000, hardly
grew at all in the second half of the century. This is to be accounted for by the
decline in its commercial importance, which was due, in part at least, to the
decline of the Trebizond—Tabriz trade route. Thepopulation of Isfahan appar
ently decreased rapidly in the first half of the century as a result of economic
decline, epidemics and political disturbances. In the 1850s and 1860s the city
would seem to have had some 60,000 to 70,000 inhabitants. By 1873 the figure
had fallen to 50,000. Numbers then increased; by 1882 the population had
reached 73,600, and by 1891,90,000. This growth isto beattributed inpart to the
growing commercial importance of Isfahan, which hadresulted from the opium
trade and the increase of Persia's trade through the Persian Gulf ports, andin
part to the fact that under Zill al-Sultan the city enjoyed a period of firm
government.
At the beginning of the century the great majority of the population was
engaged in agriculture andthe rearing of livestock, andthis continued to be the
case throughout thecentury, though it would seem that theproportion of those
so engaged to the total population dropped somewhat in the latter part ofthe
century. The nomads, who had possibly formed athird of the total population in
the first half ofthe century, fell bytheendof the century to about aquarter of the
total. There were various reasons for this. First, the mortality rate among the
nomads during the great famine years of 1869—72 wasapparently considerably
higher than that among the settled population. Their only wealth consisted of
their flocks andwhen these were decimated by lack of fodder, they had nothing

to fall back upon. Secondly there was some migration ofTurkmen tribes from
Khurasan to Russia during the last twenty years or so of the century; and thirdly
there was some sedentarization of nomads andmigration into thetowns, though
this wason afairly small scale. Inaddition tominor regional and inter-regional
movements, such as that of peasants from onevillage to another and the
migration ofnomads from winter to summer quarters, there was in 1871—2a
substantial migration from the southern and central provinces to the Caspian
littoral, andin the 1890s amovement ofpeasants from Azarbaijan, because of the
economic depression inthat province, and, toa lesser extent from Kirman and
Yazd to north-eastern Persia, which was becoming more prosperous.23
The various demographic movements outlined above are likely to have
affected theownership of land, agricultural production, andtheamount of
revenue accruing to the state from the land. Their results, however, are difficult
to quantify andtheevidence available is inadequate to trace precisely their
interaction. None butthe most tentative conclusions can be drawn.
In the early years of the century tribal policy and military policy were closely
connected. Tribal contingents formed an important part ofthe military forces of
the country especially before the military reforms inthe reign ofNasir al-Din
Shah (see further below). According to James Morier registers oftribes were
kept in thegovernment archives (daftarkhana).24Tenure in tribal districts was to
some extent affected by, though not precisely dependent upon, the provision of
military contingents. Inthe early nineteenth century the irregular horse formed
by thetribes in many cases received grants of land andliberty of pasture in return
for military service.25 Not all the tribes were nomadic orsemi-nomadic. Some,
like the Bakhtiyari, carried out long annual migrations from their summer to
their winter pastures. Others moved shorter distances, while yet others merely
took their flocks topastures outside their villages. The wealth ofthe majority
came from sheep. Some also bred horses or camels. In the early years of the
century theBan! Shaiban in Tabas, MirIsmacll Khan in Qa°in, andIshaq Khan in
Turbat-i Haidari were rich in camels, which they let outto merchants engaged in
local trade and in the Indo-Persian trade, and themselves participated in that
trade. TheQa°in district wasalso rich insheep and a flourishing trade incarpets
had developed. In Khabushan, Chinaran and Bujnurd stock-raising was com

bined with agriculture and these districts enjoyed a considerable degreeof
prosperity inthe first half of the century.26
Animal husbandry, which was mainly, though not entirely carried on by the
nomadic orsemi-nomadic tribes, played an extremely important part inthe
economy and was the basis of wealth in many districts. There was a constant
intercourse between the nomadic tribes and the towns and villages, which they
provided with milk products, meat and wool and from which they received in
return grain, cloth, money and articles of hardware. In the long drought of
1869—72 flocks and baggage animals, especially in the south, were decimated.
Once the drought was over numbers again began to rise and continued to do so
during the 1880s and 1890s, stimulated bythe increased volume of both
domestic and foreign trade and the growing demand for baggage animals and
also by the demand for wool for the expanding carpet industry.
The relationship between the nomadic tribes and the settled population was
extremely delicate, especially in the neighbourhood ofthe tribal migration
routes. The tribes often grazed the crops in the districts through which they
passed during their annual migration and committed other acts of destruction.
The borderlands between rival tribal groups were also subject to much depreda
tion. In periods when the tribes were expanding, they tended to encroach upon
and usurp property in the border zones of the tribal areas. On the other hand, in
periods of weakness they were subject to oppression and provocation from the
government. Hostages from the tribal leaders were normally kept at court as a
guarantee for the good behaviour of their relatives. The title of the tribes to their
pastures was in some cases only customary; in others itwas held by the tribal
leaders and derived from royal grant, inheritance, purchase, conquest or
usurpation. So far as the tribal leaders held government office, this facilitated
their acquisition of territory. In this their position did not differ materially from
that of other officials.
On the whole the government was unable to administer the tribal districts
directly. In the case of the larger and more important tribes, the offices of Ilkhani
and llbegl were government appointments, but in practice the government could

Wheat and barley, grown both as irrigated and unirrigated crops, provided
the staple food of the population (except in Gllan), and were the basis of the
village economy. A considerable variety of other crops was also grown, depend
ing upon theclimate, availability of markets and other local conditions. As
commercial farming became increasingly important in the second part of the
century, so Persian agriculture became more dependent upon economic devel
opments in other countries. By the end of the century, production had increased.
It had not only become much more diversified than had been the case in the first
half of the century, but cash crops constituted a larger share of the total
agricultural output than had been the case formerly. More land was brought
under cultivation. In Gllan there was some clearing ofthe forest; in Khurasan
and Astarabad the pacification of the Tiirkmens by the Russian border authori
ties and, to a limited extent, by the Persian authorities enabled lands
which had earlier been abandoned tobe brought back into cultivation; and asa
result of improved security in Kirmanshah, Khuzistan and Sistan land which
had been neglected wasagain cultivated. Various other lands were more
intensively worked, andmerchants, landowners and others invested more
capital in agricultural production.27
The main grain-growing areas were western Azarbaijan, north-eastern and
central Khurasan, Hamadan, Kirmanshah, Garrus, Khamsa, Isfahan and Fars.
Following the sharp decrease in raw silk production as a result of the outbreak of
silkworm disease in 1864, wheat and barley were grown in Gllan and Astarabad
in the early 1870s, a development which was also encouraged by the high price of
wheat during the famine years of 1871—2. In the 1890s when sericulture again
increased, the cultivation of wheat and barley in Gllan was largely abandoned.In
the 1860s wheat and barley production, notably in Isfahan, Yazd, Fars, Kirman,
Khurasan, Khuzistan and Kirmanshah, lost some ground to opium cultivation,
because this gave higher returns. The resulting decrease inthe supply ofwheat
and barley was felt mainly in the towns and to some extent bythe nomadic
tribesmen — the peasants for the most part retained enough for their own needs.
Rice production in Gllan, Mazandaran and Astarabad rose substantially from
the second half of the 1860s, duepartly to a redirection of resources to

compensate for the failure of the silk crop and partly to the high prices paid in the
domestic market for rice during the famine years. When the price of rice
dropped in 1872—3 tonearly its pre-famine level, output fell. Itincreased again,
however, in the 1890s because of a demand for rice in Russia.
Opium, already cultivated in the nth/17th century, remained a marginal
crop until the second half of the 19th century, when itbecame one of the major
crops in terms of its contribution to the national income andto exports.
Increased cultivation began inthe mid 185 os. By the late 1860s itwas cultivated
in Isfahan, Yazd, Fars, Khurasan, Kirman and Khuzistan. The growth in its
cultivation waspartly a response to the need in the central and southern
provinces forforeign currency to pay forimports of sugar from Java and to
finance the huge deficit in commercial relations with India.28 Raw silk, which
had been the country's most important export and the second major contributor
to the national income after grain, lost its position after the outbreak of the
silkworm disease in 1864. From 1865—73 the average annual production fell by
over 67 per cent. In 1874 it rose and then again decreased. During the 1890s it
rose once more, but did not return tothe level of the early 1860s. Inaddition to
the increase in rice cultivation consequent upon the decline in the production of
raw silk, there was also some expansion in the cultivation of tobacco and olives,
and, temporarily, ofwheat, barley and sugar-cane inthe Caspian provinces. In
Azarbaljan fruit orchards were extended inthose areas inwhich silkworms had
been reared. The prolonged failure ofthe silk crop, however, and the effect of
this onthe balance oftrade inthe northern provinces resulted inaneconomic
depression which lasted until the early 1890s. The production of raw cotton also
fluctuated considerably. Itgreatly increased as aresult of the sharp rise in cotton
prices inworld markets caused by the American Civil War, but when prices fell
during the second half of the 1860s as cotton production in the USA again rose,
Persian production fell. It was once more stimulated inthe 1890s, especiallyin
28 As Dr Gilbar has pointed out, the cultivation ofopium, although not unaffected by the sharp decline in the production of raw silk, was not itsdirect result. Large scale opium cultivation had already begun some ten years before the silk crisis started. Further, since commercial transactions between the north andthe south were limited, an import surplus in oneregion could not be completely offset by an export surplus in the other: the export surplus in the Caspian provinces in the period prior to the silk crisis did not ease the shortage of foreign currency in the southern provinces and merchants had to find ways of increasing the inflow of foreign currency within the southern region itself. Similarly the shortage offoreign currency inthe north after the silk crisis had started had tobe solved within that area. Hence the expansion ofrice cultivation and the efforts to resume raw silk production. The great increase of opium output in the latter half of the 1860s was primarily a result ofthe sharp decline ofcotton prices in the world market once the American Civil War had come to an end. Following this development, thecultivation of cotton in southern Persia was reduced and theproduction of opium increased {op. cit., p. i2ff.).

cotton in Russia. Fruit production also rapidly increased in the latter part ofthe
century.29
Various categories of land were recognized according to the nature of its
ownership orthe mode ofits exploitation. Their extent and distribution varied
with theexigencies of the moment. First there was private property {milk,
pi. amlak, if at, pi. iiiyac), secondly crown land (khalisa, pi. khalisajat, khassa)30,
thirdly land immobilized for charitable or other purposes (vaqfypi. auqaf,
mauqufa, pi. mauqufat), and fourthly dead land, which comprised land which had
no owner {mavat) and land which had fallen out of cultivation and was aban
doned (bayirai).These categories were all recognized by the sharlca, and so faras
auqaf and mavat were concerned detailed provisions for the constitution of the
former and the revivification of the latter were laid down in the sharica.
Superimposed upon these various categories of land were the tenures known as
suyurghal and tuyul.
Water rights were closely connected with land tenure andthe relations
between the landlord and peasant, and, similarly, were governed by the sharfa
and custom. According to the former only the channel through which water
flowed and the right touse the water could be the subject ofpurchase and sale.
Large rivers were considered to beowned in common by allMuslims, andjust as
the responsibility of the Imam for theadministration of the land which belonged
to the community had in due course devolved upon the state, soalso did his
rights with regard to the administration of large rivers and the levy of water
dues. Lands higher up a river had a prior right tothe use ofthe water to those
situated lower down. The amount of water which could beled off depended
upon changes in thevolume of the water, local needs and custom, and was
normally subject to careful regulation. Channels dug to lead water off from
rivers belonged to those who dug them, and the cleaning and repair of such
channels wasthe responsibility of the owners. In landlord villages the upkeep of
irrigation works was often done bycorvee. The division of the water flowing
along a canal was made by a dam orsluice dividing the water into a number of

This distinction disappeared with the fall of the Safavids. Crown land was also sometimes known asdlvam land. The terms khalisajat-i daulatl and khalisajat-i divariiare also found. Eventually theterm khalisasuperseded other terms andwas applied to crown lands only andnot to the personal estates of the Shah.

shares, or by an opening or outlet hole through which the water flowed from the
main channel into each plot of land; and the rotation period was bydays or
hours.31
Qanats, underground water conduits which, by using less slope than thatof
the soil surface, bring water tothe surface, were a special feature ofthe Persian
plateau.32 For the most part, the ownership ofa qanat was inthe same handsas
the ownership of the land which itwatered. In some districts, on the other hand,
land and water were separately owned, inwhich case water was purchased from
the owner ofthe qanat by those who held the land. The water was distributed
according to a regular rotation, the different pieces ofland watered by a qanat
normally having aprescriptive right toa certain share of the water. Water dues
were usually charged bythose who had sunk wells forprivate use in personal
property or pastures if the water was used by others. In thecase of natural
springs, he who first used the spring to reclaim land had aright of priority. The
sharica and custom defined the harlm, i.e. the amount ofland bordering a water
channel, qanat, stream, orthe like which was necessary tothe full enjoyment of
the land, and prohibited certain actions within it.
Water was one of the main limiting factors onagriculture. Its distribution
was often the cause of violence and dispute. Usurpation of water rights was
frequent. It was not uncommon for powerful individuals to deprive their
weaker neighbours of water and so force them to sell or abandon their property.
During the Qajar period there was some capital investment inirrigation andin
the construction and repair ofqanats and dams, especially inthe second half of
the reign of Nasir al-DIn Shah.33 Such investment, however, was haphazard and
sporadic: thegovernment had no settled policy for the construction of new
irrigation works or the repair and maintenance of existing dams.
Private property derived from inheritance, gift, purchase, royal grant, and
from therevivification of dead land. It was also acquired by conquestand
usurpation. It was transmitted by inheritance, gift34 andsale. It sometimes
carried with it immunities from taxation, which were capable of transmission
with the land by sale and inheritance.35 The rules of inheritance laid down in the

sharfa militated against the passing down of large properties intact overthe
centuries. The device of sulh,36 bywhich land could bemade over during the
owner's lifetime, however, lessened the tendency towards fragmentation, while
the fact that land was often held on a joint, or mushcf:, tenure avoided the
parcellation of the land among thejoint heirs andmade itpossible to runthe land
thus held as one unit, the joint owners insuch cases usually appointing one of
their number to run the property. The size ofestates varied from small family
holdings37 to large properties sometimes extending to a hundred or more
villages. There was a good deal of absentee ownership, especially amongthe
large landed proprietors. Peasant proprietorship was not widespread, and was
largely confined to theless fertile districts of the country.
Government office, because of the power and wealth which it conferred,
gave much opportunity for the acquisition oflarge estates by purchase and by
more dubious means. Property waseasily acquired by those in power, but it was
also easily lost: thefall of a minister was often followed by theconfiscation of his
property. Hajji Mirza AghasI, when his fall seemed imminent, bequeathed his
property to Muhammad Shah, perhaps in the vain hope ofavoiding disgrace.
When in 1849Nasir al-DIn ordered a list ofthis tobemade, it was found that
many ofthe villages sobequeathed had been taken byforce, while others had
only been paid forin part.38
Large landowners, from whatever source their lands and wealth derived,
played animportant part in thelife of the country, andwere often able to exercise
a considerable degree of independence. K.E. Abbott pointed outin 1844 that the
landed proprietors of Gilan, who were often very wealthy and in many cases
lords also of districts, were almost independent of the authority of the governor
of Gilan, and shamefully abused their power.39
So far aspatterns of settlement andtheexploitation of the land was concerned
there was much local variation inmatters ofdetail. The village was the typical
settlement andto it were often attached a number of hamlets {ma^rda, pi.
mat(aric).Thedistinction between thevillage andthe mazraca was not oneof size
or method of exploitation, but of fiscal practice: the village had an independent
tax assessment whereas the mazraca was assessed under a parent village. The
village land was usually divided into ploughlands (/#//), the size ofwhich was

affected by such factors as the amount of land available, the nature of the soil, the
irrigation system, and the draught animals used; or into a number of shares
(sahm, pi. asham).The equality ofthe ploughlands was not strictly quantitative
but also took into consideration quality. The individual holding varied from
several ploughlands to fractions ofa ploughland. Pressure onthe land varied
from district todistrict. Over the country as awhole it was not high — as stated
above, Persia had suffered from depopulation in theeighteenth century and
periodic outbreaks of famine and disease in the nineteenth century had
occasioned further losses —but round some of the towns the amount of
cultivable land may have been inadequate in relation to thepopulation.
Each ploughland was usually divided into a number ofparcels, held in the
different fields or sahra (dashf) into which the village land was divided (though in
this respect also there was much local variation). In each sahra the same rotation
and fallow practices were usually followed in all theploughlands. In some
villages the land was permanently divided among the peasants and the
ploughlands could not be altered except by their common consent;40 in others
redistribution was carried out annually or periodically. Insome villages groups
of peasants worked their lands together asa unit. One of the most important
rights attaching to the ploughland was the right to use the village pastures andto
collect scrub for fuel inthem. There was also often communal organization for
irrigation works, harvesting, the protection of the village crops, the pasturing of
the village flocks, and the upkeep ofpublic buildings such asthe mosque and
bath {hammam)yso far as these existed.41
In the more fertile irrigated districts, especially round the towns, cultivation
was intensive, the land being fertilized by household sewage mixed with earth
and bythe broken-down earth of old walls and buildings. Animal dung was
mainly used as fuel. Afairly common rotation inirrigated districts was a three
field system, one third being left fallow each year. There was, however, great
variety inrotation and fallow practices, dependent upon the nature ofthe soil,
the amount of land available and the plentifulness or otherwise of irrigation
water. In dry farming districts the land was left fallow for long periods. Seed was
sown broadcast. Ploughing was carried out by ahook type plough, with a large
or small steel share. Grain was cut with a sickle and threshed bya threshing
board or wain or trodden out byoxen or other animals. In most districtsthe
draught animal was the ox. Shortage offodder limited the number of draught
animals and also the number of stock in some districts, but in general flocks
played an important part in the village economy. They grazed in the pasture land

round the village, onthe stubble after harvest, or were taken farther afield in
summer to mountain pastures.
In the landlord villages, which formed the majority of villages, the peasants
either paid a rent in cash or kind, or more usually cultivated the land under a
crop-sharing agreement {mu^araa) with the landlord. These agreements which
were for the most part oral agreements, were largely determined by local
custom, though the sharica laid down detailed provisions for such agreements.
The type of agriculture practised, dry orirrigated, and, ifirrigated, the method
of irrigation, the crop grown, the ownership of the draught animals, and the
provision of the seed affected the share of the crop which the peasant paid tothe
landlord. Responsibility forthe payment ofthe tax onthe land under a crop
sharing agreement was, according to the sharica, the landlord's unless otherwise
stipulated in thecrop-sharing agreement. In practice there was considerable
variation; sometimes both parties paid apart of the tax demand, the proportion
which each paid varying with different crops and local custom.42
In many districts the landlord exacted, inaddition toa share ofthe crop,so
many days free labour from the peasants and their draught animals and duesin
clarified butter, firewood, and chickens, and sometimes also apoll-tax or hearth
tax, and entertainment for himself and his bailiff. It isdifficult toascertain how
widespread these dues were, but it isprobable that they were common practice
in many parts of the country, especially in the more remote districts. There isan
interesting minute ondues and labour service made by the Council of Statein
1881 ona memorandum proposing their abolition among the Nestorian com
munity inthe district ofUrmiya. This reads: "Since this is [an old] custom and
the [day's] labour is taken also from Mahommedans, Armenians and Nestorians
should also give it. Otherwise the landlord will lose his rights over the
peasantry, and Moslem peasants will require the same [concessions]. The
custom hasbeen that allthepeasants shall give oneday's labour, oneload of fuel,
etc., and that if these were notwanted, they paid their value."43
42 In the tribal areas the situation was often more complex. For example among the MukrI Kurds in Saiij Bulagh in or about 1838 the Baba Amlra tribal chief who held the property received one fifteenth of the crop, theagha (minor chief) to whom it was assigned and who was the responsible agent vis-a-vis the government, one tenth, and the %iraLatchis, who superintended the cultivators, one fifth. The remainder wasshared between the costs of tillage and labour equally or in some other proportion (Rawlinson, "Notes on a journey from Tabriz", pp. 35-6). 43 British andForeign State Papers, vol. LXXIII (1881-2), London, 1889, ed. SirEdward Herslet and E.C. Herslet, p. 341. This memorandum confirms and re-establishes regulations drawn upin 1864 by the Persian government with respect to certain grievances of the Nestorians in the districts of Urmiya and accepted by the landowners and chiefs of those districts. On the occasion of their reestablishment, Mr Ronald Thomson, the British Minister, raised certain points which were submitted by the Minister forForeign Affairs tothe Shah and byhim tothe Council ofState and gave rise to the minute quoted above.

The landlord's share in grain was normally paid in kind and the crop divided
on the threshing-floor. His share on summer crops wasprobably usually
reckoned by valuation and sometimes commuted into a cash payment.The
village headman, who, inlandlord villages, was normally the landlord's bailiff,
also commonly received a share of the crop or some other payment from the
peasants. Inaddition tothe crop-sharing peasants there were also, inthe larger
villages, labourers who worked for other more prosperous peasants, as servants
of the landlord, or as village craftsmen and servants.
In a country with so capricious a climate as Persia, the crop-sharing system
had the advantage that itprotected the peasant from demands for rent when his
crop failed and made himless vulnerable to changes in prices and depreciation in
the value ofmoney, which was an important consideration inQajar Persia. On
the other hand, the crop-sharing system, coupled with the prevailing insecurity
of tenure, was a disincentive to increased agricultural production.
Yields were low and after the peasant had paid the landlord's share, set aside
seed for the next year andprovided for his own and his family's subsistence there
was usually little left over for sale or barter. He was thus seldom able to
accumulate reserves, and was often in need of money for capital requirements to
replace livestock and agricultural implements and forcurrent expenses suchas
the provision of seed. In many cases hehad to borrow, often at high ratesof
interest, toprovide these and, not infrequently, tofinance the interval between
sowing and harvest. The money-lender was often alandowner, merchant, corn
chandler, peddler, or a rich calim. The root cause of the peasant's poverty,
however, was not the crop-sharing system as such or the tax system (see below)
but rather the arbitrary nature of society and the exactions to which he was
subject from other classes of the population.
Morier, who travelled widely in Persia in the early years of the century, states
that the prevailing extortion killed any initiative. He writes: "No one would
undertake tocultivate apiece of land because he knew its produce would fall to
anyone but himself. He is therefore content to live from hand to mouth, without
permitting himself to indulge inany hope that he may lay up a store for himself
to serve intimes ofscarcity."44 Fraser, who also had wide experience ofPersia,
similarly draws attention to theextortion and injustice practised against the
peasants. Hestates, however, that they nevertheless often appeared to enjoy
relative comfort, that their food appeared tobe enough and that their clothing
was coarse but sufficient.45 There is some evidence to suggest that the increase in

agricultural production which took place in thelast forty years or so ofthe
nineteenth century was accompanied by a certain improvement inthe standard
of living of the peasants. Insome districts itseems that their daily diet was more
diversified, that their consumption of foreign and locally made industrial goods
increased, and that they were able to accumulate a few small savings.46
Sir Justin Sheil, writing in the middle of the century, considered officials and
others whohad been assigned rights over the land or its produce asthe source of
oppression rather than the landlord. He points out that in a thinly populated
country such as Persia it was in the interests of the landlord to conciliatehis
tenants and perpetuate their residence onhis property. "Landlords", he states,
"treated their tenants well which it is obviously intheir interest to do. Itis from
teeool-holders, mohessils, and irregular arbitrary taxation that thepeasantry
suffers vexation and extortion."47 Mrs Bishop, who travelled widely inthe late
nineteenth century and viewed the country with a sympathetic and perceptive
eye, reported that the peasants enjoyed a tolerable security oftenure solongas
they paid their rent,48 butshe also points out that they, like allother classes,
suffered from theprevailing insecurity. The peasant had no security for the
earnings of his labour, and was "the ultimate sponge to besucked dry by all
above him".49 Although eviction was rare, the peasants only exceptionally had
by local custom security of tenure, apart from that accorded bythe principle
enunciated by the Islamic jurists that "what is cultivated belongs to the
cultivator". They often had noright to compensation forany improvements
they might have made to theland if they were evicted or for buildings they might
have constructed. In spite of Sir Justin Sheil's assessment, itwould seem that the
general tendency of landlords wastowards extortion, and that this had a
stultifying effect on development. William J. Dickson, commenting on the fact
that the peasants inGilan had not reverted in 1881-2 tothe cultivation of raw
silk onthe scale they had practised before the outbreak ofsilkworm disease in
1864, states that the peasants "have found from experience, that rice suits them
better. Itrequires less trouble to cultivate, andis,moreover, in itself an article of
food upon which they principally subsist, whereas the richer commodity [i.e.
raw silk], byexciting the cupidity of the landed proprietors, not only left the
peasants noprofit, butsubjected them to constant oppression."50

Economically, crop-sharing peasants and tenants were at the mercy of the
landlord. There was, however, a practical limit setto the demands which the
latter made. Dead peasants were no use and so he had toleave them enough to
keep alive; further the peasants were not serfs, and if pressed too hard they might
seek refuge in flight, as they sometimes did, though the fact that they mightbe
burdened byindebtedness to the landlord made this more difficult.51
The value of property varied widely, depending primarily on the amount of
water available, the nature ofthe soil and the accessibility of markets. Malcolm
states that during the latter years ofthe Safavid dynasty "land sold for twenty
five and thirty years' purchase; and that all the late revolutions and the heavy
imposts have never reduced it below half its former value".52 J. Macdonald
Kinneir, writing about 1810, puts land values rather lower and states that the
usual price did not exceed tenyears' purchase.53
Ahmad cAli Vaziri, who wrote his Jughrafiya-yi mamalik-i Kirman between
1874 and 1876, asserts that there was a marked increase inthe value of landed
estates inthe whole ofthe province ofKirman and especially inthe districtsof
Sirjan, Rafsanjan and Arzuya, between about the year 1844 and the time when he
was writing. This, heclaims, was due to the high prices paid forcotton and
madder which were exported to India and the scarcity of grain in Yazd and most
of Persia in the famine years (1869—1872). He alleges that not only had the wealth
of the landowners greatly increased but also that the peasants were much better
off than formerly. Many ofthose from Rafsanjan had become hajjls. The risein
the price oikurk (fine goat's wool) and wool had, he states, made rich men of the
owners of sheep and goats.54
Crown lands were accumulated by conquest, usurpation, confiscation for
arrears of taxation, rebellion or some other cause, escheat and purchase;
dispersal by gift and sale was also frequent. In, orabout, 1854 the Minister for
Foreign Affairs, MIrza AbuDl-Hasan Khan, claimed that khalisa land could not
be permanently alienated and that all grants of khalisa fell in to the crown on the
51 About the middle of the century there appears tohave been a movement into Tabriz from the outlying districts in search of the security which was to be found in the anonymity of the large town. Abbott reported that the growing population of Tabriz atthis time was due tothe gradual removal of the "wretched inhabitants" from the surrounding districts to Tabriz where, being in a dense mass, they had more security than when scattered in small communities (F.O. 60: 197. Abbott to Thomson, No. 149, Tehran, 21 December 1854, incl. No. 5in Abbott to Clarendon, No. 81, Tabriz, 26 December 1854). Towards the end of the century there was also alarge movement of peasants and others from north-eastern and north-western Persia into Russia. This was partly due to the economic crisis innorthern Persia which had resulted from the decline inthe silk trade and Persia's adverse trade balance in general, as well as the decline of the Tabriz-Trebizond route after the 1860s. 52 History of Persia n , pp. 349-50. 53 A geographical memoir of the Persian empire, p . 47. 54 E d .Bastani Parlzl, in Farhang-i Iran %amln x i v , 1-4 (1345/1966-7), p p . 158, 168-9.

granted on khalisa or other land. Nothing came of this attempt and khalisa
continued to bedisposed of by gift and sale. The border-line between crown
land and the personal estates of the ruler was in the early Qajar period somewhat
shadowy, but as the conception of state revenue as something distinct from the
personal income of the Shah became stronger, crown lands ceased tobe
considered as theruler's personal estates.
Many of the crown lands acquired by Nadir Shah fell to the Qajars, who also
created new crown lands by purchase andconfiscation. Agha Muhammad
bought considerable areas of land in Mazandaran, Astarabad and elsewhere,
which he made into khalisa.56 Fath All Shah, Muhammad Shah, and Nasir al
Din Shah acquired many estates by confiscation for arrears of taxation orother
reasons and some by purchase, and constituted them into khalisa. There were
various categories: khalisajat-i dlvani, which remained inthe full possessionof
the government; khalisajat-i tuyulT, the possession ofwhich carried with itthe
obligation to furnish military contingents and which were mainly found in tribal
areas; khalisajat-i intiqali, which were handed over to individuals forlife or a
shorter period, with the right oftransfer; khalisajat-i zabti, land confiscated by
the government for arrears of taxation, rebellion or some other cause, a portion
of the revenue of which might be allowed to the former owner or his relatives as
a pension (mustamarri), theestate remaining annexed to thecrown until its
former owner, or hisheirs, were restored to favour, when the estate might,
according to the pleasure of the sovereign, be returned; khalisajat-i zabtl,
consisting of lands mainly in theIsfahan district which had been entered as
khalisa inthe Afghan and Nadir! registers, although they had never been in the
effective possession ofthe government; and khalisajat-i ba%rl. The last named,
also mainly in the Isfahan district, were estates which had fallen out of
cultivation towards the beginning of the reign of Muhammad Shah. With aview
to preventing a loss ofrevenue, diwan officials had been instructed to provide
the peasants with seed, and to include the names of the villages concerned in the
lists of khalisajat. Although these lands were subsequently returned to their
owners, they continued to be known as khalisajat-i bazri.57
At the beginning of the century itwas estimated that only one eighth of Fars
and Persian cIraq was crown land.58 By the middle of the century crown land had

become an increasingly important and extensive category ofland and was to be
found all over the empire. In 1861, Eastwick stated that one third, or according
to some accounts, one half ofthe land ofPersia was khalisa.59 The latter figure
would appear to be unduly high. Sistan and Baluchistan also became crown land
after 1866.E. Stack, writing in 1882, notes that there was aconstant tendency of
arbabz land to become dlvamhy resumption of religious grants, confiscation, and
by escheat.60 On theother hand in theforty years or so leading up to the
constitution much khalisa was sold.
As inearlier periods, khalisa land was either directly administered on acrop
sharing agreement, letona tenancy, or itsrevenue farmed, the tenant or the
farmer then concluding acrop-sharing or tenancy agreement with the peasants.
The rate of tax paid by those who held crown lands varied in different places and
at different times. Karelin, the commander of a Russian expedition to the eastern
shores ofthe Caspian Sea, ina report made tothe Russian Minister of Finance
and Commerce in 1836, states that the villages in the Astarabad district, whether
they belonged tothe crown orwere granted to the khans and begs (presumably
as tuyuls), paid heavy taxes. Besides the work the inhabitants were obliged to
perform fortheir masters, every house paid a due in kind onIndian corn and
wheat, and acash payment on silk and horned cattle. They were further boundin
time of war to provide one man, fully equipped and armed, out of every twenty
grown men. Should amilitary movement be made, the peasants were requiredto
furnish supplies; and the local people were also obliged toentertain the officers
of the crown and to conciliate them with presents. It was difficult in these
circumstances forthem to exist and many who possessed property employed
every means toconceal it and avoid being robbed by both their own chiefs and
the government.61 In the Bampur khalisa towards the end ofthe century,the
peasants were said toobtain a bare subsistence and their condition tobe one of
degradation.62
If khalisa land was rented orfarmed on amuqatda contract,63 ora tuyul was
granted on it, thelessee or tuyuldar was responsible for thepayment of the
government tax, unless he was granted immunity for some reason orother. In
the case of a tuyul granted on khalisa land, the taxes were sometimes remitted in

return for the provision of a military contingent. Malcolm states that in a desire
to encourage the new regular army which was being trained by Abbas Mirza,
crown lands were granted to soldiers onmore favourable terms than to other
tenants.64 These grants were presumably not tuyuls but leases. Sometimes
khalisa land appears to have paid a lower rate of tax than neighbouring land
which was not khalisa, while khalisa land which had been disposed ofby sale
seems occasionally to have paid a higher rate of taxation than neighbouring
villages which had from the outset been held as private property. For example,
villages inMaku which had come to the chief by inheritance were paying, in the
early twentieth century, twenty per cent ofthe cotton and wheat crop, whereas
villages bought from the crown paid one third ofthe cotton, wheat and barley
crop.65
In theprovinces thetaxes on khalisa land, so far as its revenue wasnot
assigned, were collected bythe provincial governors, asalso was the govern
ment's share of the crops or its rent. The grain obtained in this way was stored in
government granaries and used toprovision the army, and topay, inpart, the
salaries of government officials. Price levels on the whole tended to follow grain
prices. Adequate supplies of grain were thus crucial to price control. No
government could lightly regard the possibility of bread riots and civil disorders
such as might occur ifgrain supplies failed. The possession of crown lands gave
governments the possibility oflessening the impact of crop failures and famine
and also of breaking rings set upbyhoarders, though it was itself sometimes
guilty ofholding grain till prices rose. The inadequacy ofcommunications and
transport reduced the effectiveness of the release of grain bythe government
from its own granaries toalleviate crop failures, which were normally of a local
nature but sometimes, asin 1871—2, countrywide. Such measures asthey took
were seldom successful for these and other reasons.
By the second part of the century, much crown land had fallen into astate of
decay and made little contribution to the revenue. In Isfahan at the beginning of
the reign of Nasir al-DIn Shah about a thousand villages and hamlets, some
khalisa, some vaqf,and others in private ownership were in a state of ruin. A
large sum ofmoney, together with a considerable quantity ofgrain, was made
available onthe revenue of Isfahan to Mirza Abd al-Husain, the head of the
finance department of Isfahan, to enable him to bring them back into
cultivation. Hemisappropriated themoney andrebelled. After the ensuing
disorders had been put down, the estates of those implicated, and of a number of

other people also, were confiscated tothe crown. Subsequently, possessionof
these estates was regained by their former owners by various means. In 1863 an
attempt was made to bring khalisa land in Isfahan back into astate of prosperity.
An order was issued for the provision of the necessary expenses and the
conclusion of five-year leases.66 Nothing came of this. The efforts of
Muhammad Ismacil Khan Vakil al-Mulk, who became governor ofKirman in
1860 and was sent about the same time toKirman tolook into the conditionof
khalisa property there, were apparently more successful.67 More khalisa land fell
out of cultivation in Isfahan during the famine years of 1871-2, and further
confusion ensued in the land registers. Finally in 1874, Zill al-Sultan, the
governor of Isfahan, in the hope of restoring the situation, concluded muqataca
contracts forthe cultivation ofthe khalisajat of Isfahan fora ten-year period,
instead of for the usual three years.68 In general Isfahan prospered underthe
government of Zill al-Sultan and it may beassumed that the condition ofthe
khalisajat improved with that of the province as a whole.
Meanwhile, increasing financial stringency inthe latter years ofthe reignof
Nasir al-DIn Shah led to the issue ofa farman in 1306/1889—90 forthe saleof
khalisajat, excluding those in the capital. Much khalisa wasin due course sold, in
the reigns of both Nasir al-DIn and Muzaffar al-DIn. Round Isfahan agreat deal
was bought byrich notables, culama and merchants. This had certain adverse
effects on the economy. Formerly the peasants who cultivated the land had paid
their rent in grain to the government. The latter then resold the grain atlow
rates. In 1897-8 the new owners wTere reported tohave held the grain against a
rise in prices and to have ground down the peasants. As aresult the latter had no
money tospend in the bazaars and trade was adversely affected.69 In 1901—2,the
major part ofShulistan was sold toMucln al-Tujjar Bushahri, one ofthe Shah's
private bankers, inorder to ease the government's financial difficulties,70 and in

(vaqf-icamm)or in favour of specific beneficiaries {vaqf-ikhass). A condition of
the constitution of a vaqf was that thefounder should have full rights of disposal
of the property which he intended to constitute into a vaqf. Thefact that land
could bemade into vaqf implies, therefore, the existence ofprivate property over
which the owner had full rights of disposal. Land was sometimes constituted
into a vaqf-i khass in thehope of protecting theproperty from confiscation. The
process limited thefounder's freedom of disposal butenabled theproperty to be
transmitted to succeeding generations.
Vaqf properties ranged from large and very wealthy properties to those
whose income wasminimal, perhaps barely sufficient for the subsistence of the
servant of the shrine for the benefit of which it might have been constituted.
Some auqaf survived through the centuries. Others were usurped, resumed,72
fell out of cultivation, or became null and void because the purposes for which
they were constituted had ceased to exist. The Safavids made many properties
into vaqf, notably when Shah cAbbas constituted his personal property into a
vaqf for the twelve imams^ Muhammad and his daughter Fatima. He made
himself mutavalli,or administrator, of the vaqf, vesting this office in the ruling
Shah after him, who thus hadan interest in thecontinuation of the institution. A
large number of Safavid auqaf survived the fall of the dynasty. The most
important were those belonging to the shrine of the Imam Riza at Mashhad,
which held many valuable properties in different parts of the country, especially
Khurasan, as also did some other ShIcI shrines andmadrasas. Fraser reports that
the revenue of the shrine of the Imam Riza had amounted under Shah Sultan
Husain, the last of the Safavid Shahs, to 15,000 Khurasan! tumans (3,000,000
rs.). Many of the properties were subsequently usurped, andwhen Fraser was in
Persia in 1821—2, theincome of the shrine was, hestates, probably notmore than
2,000 or 2,500 tumans (40—50,000 rs.).73 Curzon, writing some seventy years
later, puts the shrine revenues at 60,000 tumans in cash and 10,000 kharvars in
grain.74
The office of administrator of a large vaqf was usually extremely profitable.
The administrator was entitled to aproportion of the revenue, greater or smaller
according to the terms of the vaqf-nama.Further, control of large properties

brought with itsocial and political influence. Many of theculama were adminis
trators of auqaf, often holding these positions by hereditary right. For example,
the office of mutavalli of the shrine ofFatima, the sister ofthe Imam Riza, at
Qum, held by Hajji Mir Sayyid Muhammad Baqir atthe turn ofthe nineteenth
century, hadbeen in hisfamily since hisancestor, Hajji Mir Sayyid Husain
Khatim al-Mujtahidin, had been appointed mutavalli under the early Safavids.
Sayyid Muhammad Baqir was reported to have animmense personal fortune
and was alleged toown one third of the villages inthe province.75 The position
of the culama as administrators ofauqaf implicated them inthe economic, and
especially the agricultural, fabric of the country. This, coupled with the fact that
they were often also the beneficiaries, inone way oranother, of the revenuesof
charitable auqaf, inevitably affected their attitude to theland system and to
agriculture and made them reluctant to take, or support, steps to change its basic
features.
The terms tuyul and suyurghal covered both the grant ofthe revenue of a
district, with orwithout the grant ofimmunities and jurisdiction, and also, by
extension, the land onwhich such a grant was made. The terms first became
current in Ilkhanid and Timurid times. Whatever the original concepts ofthe
tuyul and suyurghal, they became assimilated to the iqtcf^ which the Sunni jurists
had earlier, rightly or wrongly, seen as a development from early Islamic
precedents, thus bringing itwithin the cognizance of the sharica.76 Like the iqtac
of the Saljuq period, the tuyul tended, by usurpation, tobecome hereditary. In
Ilkhanid and Timurid times the term suyurghal wasprimarily used to denote the
grant of a provincial government with immunities or agrant in lieu of a pension.
In the former sense the term suyurghal wasin due course superseded by the term
tuyul, and in Safavid times its use was mainly confined tothe designation of a
hereditary or life grant on crown lands, vaqf land or usufructory property in lieu
of a pension. Such suyurghals, so far as they were granted on property belonging
to the beneficiary, carried with them immunities and sometimes jurisdiction.
Under the Qajars theterm suyurghal, although occasionally found at the
beginning of the period, became obsolete, and was replaced in its varying senses
also by the term tuyul. This was now used tocover the grant of a sum of money
made on some fund, the realization ofwhich was usually, though not necessar

ily, entrusted tothe beneficiary,77 agrant ofmoney with orwithout immunities
and territorial jurisdiction in lieu of salary or as apension, or simply the grant of
an immunity, and, by extension, the land on which such grants were made. Agha
Muhammad Khan, after defeating Murtaza Quli Khan in 1781, gave Bistam as a
tuyul to Jacfar Quli Khan and Simnan as a suyurghal to cAli Quli Khan.78 Itisnot
clear what the distinction between these two grants was.Perhaps the terms were
loosely used synonymously. For example, Riza Quli Khan states that Fath CA1I
Shah, when he visited Sultanabad in 1828-9, conferred upon Yusuf Khan GurjT,
the governor and army commander ofPersian Traq, his estates (raqabat)as "a
permanent tuyul and everlasting suyurghal".79 Although the term tuyul was no
longer applied to what was,in effect, a provincial government, in many cases the
position of a tuyuldar (the holder of a tuyul) was not very different from that of
the muqtd\vali ofearlier times. Sir Justin Sheil, writing in 1854, describesthe
system asfollows: "Every village in the kingdom pays a fixed tax onthe land
appertaining toit. It is customary to make agrant of this revenue in payment of
salaries and pensions, sinecures, etc. This is called Tioo/, and the holder of it
becomes lord ofthe village, especially ifhe isaperson ofrank and position."80
Sheil seems, thus, tohave believed that it was, intheory atleast, simply a grant
on the revenue of a district. He goes on to describe the tuyul "as a most
pernicious system: whether inrecompense forservices orin remuneration for
salary. The tiooldar being only aholder of the land for aperiod usually short and
always uncertain, has no object but tolevy all the contributions he possibly can
during his tenure. Bysome means not very intelligible hemakes himself the
temporary owner of the land to the complete exclusion of the real proprietor."81
Almost everyone holding a position at court, from the Prime Minister down
wards, was, he states, a tuyuldar.82 Intheory, the tuyuldar had no authority to
77 The chief of the Jacfar Bay Tiirkmens held as a tuyul the customs house dues at Hasan Quli, which were levied on the traders in naphtha of the Oghoorjellee tribe (F.O. 60: 122. Taylour Thomson to Sheil, Tehran, 15 April 1846, incl. inSheil to Aberdeen, No. 5 o, Tehran, 4May 1846). It was possible tofarm atuyuldmwn onsome fund toathird person. Thus Mirza Jacfar Khan, who held the taxes onthe butchers ofTabriz as a tuyul, farmed these toa third person (F.O. 60: 152. Stevens to Sheil, No. 51, Tabriz, 23 May 1850, incl. in Sheil to Palmerston, No. 83, camp near Tehran, 20 July 1850). Cf. also Rawlinson, "Notes on a journey from Tabriz", p. 5, note. 78 rAbd al-Razzaq b. Najaf Quli, The dynasty of the Kajars, p. 15. There is also thestatement in the Fars-nama-yi Nasirtof Hajji Mirza Hasan Fasa3! that the Gavbaz, atribe who fattened cattle, were the tuyul and suyurghal of the naqlbof the qalandars and darvishes of Fars (Tehran, lith., 1894-6,11, 314). This presumably means that the taxes of the Gavbaz were allocated to the naqlb of the qalandars and darvishes of Fars. 79 Riza Quli Khan, Rau^at al-safa ix, p. 704. 80 F.O. 60: 194, Sheil to the Shah, n.d. si Ibid. 82 Ibid.

alter the tax assessment83 but in practice, as Sheil states, he often levied
contributions in excess of the basic assessment.
A tuyul for the beneficiary's salary as governor, or to provide for his
subsistence, was not necessarily given onthe area of which hewas governor.
Nasr-Allah Mirza b. Husain cAli Mirza, whowasfor years governor of Shulistan
and Mamasani, for example, held the buluk of Ardistan as a tuyul for his
subsistence.84 Certain districts were also sometimes allocated as a tuyul in
payment of the salary of a specific office.
Traces are tobe found of a grant comparable tothe iqtac given tosoldiersin
earlier times. Morier states that thetroops of Husain AllMirza, theGovernor of
Fars received, about the year 1809, in addition to their annual pay and daily
allowance of fodder, a certain allotment of land in their own country for the
maintenance oftheir families, which they tilled and sowed, and ofwhich they
reaped the annual fruits.85 Scott Waring, writing in or about 1802, states that the
soldiers ofthe state who cultivated land were exempt from all taxes but thatin
the event oftheir being called upon forservice, they were obliged to abandon
their crops to the superintendence of their friends.86 Similarly in thelatter part of
the century, thejambat^militia ofBampur, who were only called up intimesof
emergency or onspecial occasions, received nopay but cultivated their lands
free.87
In the latter half of the nineteenth century various tribal groups incertain of
the north-eastern frontier areas held land free in return for the provision of
military contingents or for the military services which they performed in
connection with frontier defence. This was the case inDarra Gaz and Bujnurd.
Capt. G.C.Napier records in 1874 that the khan of Darra Gazmaintained a body
of 800 horsemen mounted and armed asa condition ofhis tenure. He held his
lands free of land tax but subject to thepayment of a yearly tribute in the shape of
presents of money and horses, the amount of which regulated the treatment
which he received at thehands of the provincial andcentral governments. A sum
was allotted annually from the treasury of the governor of Khurasan for the
payment of a portion of the horsemen but thearrangement wasnominal since, in
the words ofCapt. Napier, "no portion ofthe subsidy leaves the hands of the

officials at Mashad".88 Similarly the llkhani of the Shadilu of Bujnurd was
exempt from the payment ofland tax inreturn for guarding the Atrak frontier.
He also paid an annual tribute inhorses and money tothe Shah. No taxes were
taken from the people save such as thellkhani himself might choose to take. The
militia he raised to guard thefrontier held rent-free lands andhada small
assignment of grain in lieu of pay. Some of the cavalry recruited by thellkhani of
the Shadilu, and also the body ofhorse raised by the llkhani ofthe Zacfaranlu
similarly received assignments ofgrain.89 These grants were presumably made
to individuals, not by the central government, but by the local leaders to whom
the central government granted the exemption from taxation.
There are also cases somewhat reminiscent of the iqtacs granted to Saljuq
women and the grants made to Ilkhanid women. When Agha Bajl, the daughter
of Ibrahim Khan Shisha3!, came to join Fath cAli Shah's haram,shebrought with
her two hundred personal servants (^amalajat-i shakhsl) from Qarabagh and they
were given a sum from therevenue of Qum as a suyurghal.90 Similarly,the
diwan dues of Niyasar and its hamlets inthe province of Kashan were the tuyul
of Muhammad Shah's sister and were alienated from the control of the governor
of the province.91 Lastly the element of "protection", as found in the earlier
taljlca?2 played some part in the spread of the tuyul (though itwasnot one ofthe
main reasons for its emergence). Small landowners or peasant proprietors would
sometimes request aneighbouring landowner or powerful individual toask for
their land as a tuyul so that they might obtain his protection against the
government.93
Much crown land was alienated as tuyul. For example, the greater part of the
Shahsevan country inAzarbaijan, which was crown land, was granted towards
the middle of the century in tuyul to the family of Abu3l-Fath Khan, a Qarabaghi
chief ofsome consequence.94 It was, however, not only crown land that was so
granted (although Sykes, writing in 1910, appears to consider that tuyul land
was state land).95 Grants were also made on private property and vaqf land. If a
tuyul drawn onthe tax or taxes of a district was granted to the owner ofthe
district, this in effect amounted virtually to a grant of fiscal and judicial

immunity. In fact, it was often stated in the document granting the tuyul that
government officials should not enter the district.96 Insuch cases the advantage
to the owner was considerable. A similar situation arose if a tuyul was granted on
khalisa land or on vaqf land.
Unless otherwise stipulated the tuyul was normally granted forlife. Some
times the document for its grant would state that it was given tothe holder and
his heirs inperpetuity. Infact, however, tuyuls were resumable atwill, and, in
theory at least, fell in with the death of the ruler unless confirmed by his
successor. On the death of the tuyuldar his heirs were frequently able to securea
regrant of the tuyul. There was, infact, amarked tendency for tuyuls to become
hereditary and tobe assimilated toprivate property. Rawlinson, who travelled
widely in Persia in the first half of the century, writing in 1838, thought that
about one fifth of the land revenue was alienated from thegovernment in
tuyul.97
There was considerable variety in the matter of the payment made to the
government by atuyuldar on institution and on the regrant of a tuyul. Probably
no uniform practice prevailed. Those who held large tuyuls were possibly also
expected to offer "presents" (plshkash) at the New Year and, in the event of a
royal "progress" through or in theneighbourhood of their tuyuls, to offer
extraordinary presents and entertainment, but these were ad hoc levies towhich
any person of substance might be subjected.
The obligations ofthe tuyuldar varied. Ifthe tuyul was inlieu ofa pension,
the obligations, ifany, were minimal. Ifit was attached to an office, the situation
was different, though such tuyuls often became sinecures inthe course oftime.
In the case of a tuyul granting fiscal and judicial immunity, the holder's
obligation was in effect to carry out the functions of government, transmit to the
central or provincial government any surplus revenue from the district after
local expenses and any sum specially allocated to him had been paid and, in some
cases, especially infrontier districts, to provide troops. Fraser, writing in 1821
2, states that lands held in tuyul for the payment of military or other services paid
nothing tothe government. The holder took the proprietor's share of the crop,
all government dues and anything else he could get when the land belonged to
the government; if,however, the assignment was on the estate of a third person,

Fath CA1I Shah, the property of the governor, Faraj Allah Khan, the chief
executioner (nasaqcht-bashi). Itpaid no revenue but furnished the king with 5,000
horsemen who were paid, fed and clothed by its produce." Sheil mentions that a
Hazara chief visited Tehran in 185 2 inthe hope ofobtaining an extensive grant
of land for the settlement ofa portion ofhis tribe atJam under the engagement
of protecting it from Turkmen inroads.100 Sometimes, however, the obligation
to provide troops was converted into a money payment.101
With themilitary reforms of Mirza Taqi Khan Amir Nizam in 18 51, the
obligation to provide troops ceased, at least in theory, to be the direct
responsibility of the tuyuldar. Each village, district, or tribe was required to
provide under theassessment ibunlchd) of the village a number of soldiers or
government servants (naukar-i daulat) proportionate to the amount of its rev
enue assessment. The men served in theory for six months of the yearand
returned to their villages for the other six months. Their pay for the latter period
was acharge on the village, as also was the small allowance paid totheir families
while they were away onservice.102 Further reforms were carried out byMirza
Husain Khan, who was appointed first minister orsadr-i' a%am on 12 December
1871 and held office until September 1873.103 Subsequently, adecree stating that
the army would in future beraised byconscription and the term of service be
twelve years instead oflife as heretofore was issued in 1307/1889—90, which laid
down that one man for every 180 male Muslims ineach village should be taken
for military service and 150tumans for every 180non-Muslims, was also
probably never fully operative. Nominally the law applied toall parts of Persia
and all classes of the population with theexception of Christians, Jewsand
Parsees, peasants on crown lands, sayyids and culama, and theinhabitants of
towns were subject to conscription. Some districts such as Yazd and Kashan,
because ofthe supposedly poor quality oftheir recruits, were also exempted.104

With thegrowth in theregular army following thereforms of the Amir
Nizam, the demand for recruits increased, and with it the harassment of the
peasantry.105 On receipt oforders for the enrolment ofa regiment, the colonel,
who was often a large landed proprietor, thelocal chief, or tuyuldar of the
district, would, with his subordinate officers, tour the villages responsible for
his recruits. The richer members of the community would often buy themselves
ofT. Those enrolled, ortheir families, received grants, known as khanavara, paid
by their fellow villagers (the amount ofwhich varied from district todistrict).
They also received, in some cases, a payment known as padarana, which was
made once only onenrolment. So faras the tribal cavalry were concerned, the
chief responsible for their maintenance was paid a varying sum per manper
annum. This was seldom paid in cash; it was usually deducted from the tribal
revenue due to the government.
The tuyul system, while it did not lead to the emergence of a landed
aristocracy, supported the position of the tribal leaders, many of whom were
tuyuldars, and contributed to the power of the local landowners. As long as the
central government was strong, the opportunity toconvert tuyuls into private
property was limited, butinevitably thegrant of a tuyul to a powerful and
prominent individual, whether he was a tribal leader, landowner, military
commander or government official, frequently enabled him to usurp possession
of the land within, and on theborders of, histuyul.
Provided that the central government was strong, the abuses of the tuyul
system could becontrolled, and it could even beargued that the system had
certain advantages. To alarge extent itrelieved the government of the need both
to establish a district tax administration and to transfer funds toand from the
provinces. It also enabled the government tocall upon auxiliary military forces
in an emergency and obviated theneed to maintain and pay in cash a large
standing army. On the other hand ithad the disadvantage that the troops were
apt todisappear atharvest time and inthe sowing season and were reluctant to
serve on distant campaigns, and, more importantly, itplaced power in the hands
of others ifthe government was weak. Further, so far as the tuyul was regarded
as a temporary grant, its holder often made many exactions upon the peasants.
These sometimes provoked the peasants toflight and occasionally to insurrec
tion. It was, however, often when the central government was weakest that the
tuyul became most widespread. Geographical conditions — theobstacles to
communication provided by the central desert and the very extent of the empire

- made itdifficult for the government to control the outlying provinces and the
nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, and so the functions of government tended to
devolve upon the tuyuldars. On the other hand, sofaras government officials
tended tobe extortionate, apowerful tuyuldar could, insome measure, protect
the peasants residing on his land, but the advantage to them from this was offset
by theelement of subjection inherent in thesystem. Bythelate nineteenth
century, under the weak rule of MuzafTar al-Din Shah, alarge part of the country
was alienated as tuyuls to hisentourage andfavourites, who performed no
service in return. The main revenues ofthe state were thus stopped at source
with no advantage accruing in return to the government. With the changes that
took place in the administration ofthe country and in the concept of govern
ment resulting from the Constitutional Revolution, one ofthe first acts of the
National Consultative Assembly wasto abolish tuyiil tenures, which had
outlived bythat time any usefulness they may once have had.
Since rights over the land were often acquired and exercised inanarbitrary
manner, it isnot surprising that insecurity of tenure was acharacteristic feature
of the land system. This was further exaggerated by the fact that there wasno
regular system ofland registration, except inthe case ofkhalisajat, which were
entered in special registers. Royal grants were presumably registered in the
central or provincial archives, but the registers were not open to public
inspection and subsequent changes inthe ownership ofthe property were not
necessarily recorded. The title toprivate property rested, inthe case ofa royal
grant, on aroyal farman, otherwise, ifat all, on atitle deed or transaction ofsale
witnessed by religious dignitaries. Sometimes titles were corroborated by a
certificate (istishhad-nama), also attested by religious dignitaries and local
notables,106 which might be further corroborated bya raqam or deed from a
provincial governor or by a royal farman. There was noregular provision for
the cancellation of titles, and disputes over conflicting titles were common. The
farman relating to bankruptcies dated 1844 (referred to above, p. 466) mentions
the validation of deeds of sale of real estate by the divan-khana, but registration in
the divan-khana does notappear to have been mandatory.107 Land disputes
between private individuals were normally heard in the sharica courts or referred
for decision to a religious dignitary.108
There appears to have been some sporadic registration of sales and mort
gages of land toforeigners. The farman relating tobankruptcies, besides laying

bankrupts, made provision forthe registration of deeds ofpurchase and sale,
bonds andother documents. Sheil reported an attempt in 1851 to exercise
supervision over the registration of sales and mortgages in Rasht, Astarabad and
Bushire, with the object of checking a growing desire by foreigners, mainly
Russian subjects, to acquire landed possessions in Persia. It would appear,
however, that inthis case it was mainly property intowns that was at issue.109
Engagements were taken from the qa'^Js in Bushire that they would not ratify any
mortgage orsale, deeds ofland, houses, orproperty without the cognizanceof
the governor. Renewed engagements tothis effect were taken in 1854. In July
1867 the Persian Minister forForeign Affairs gave instructions that no landed
property should be alienated toBritish subjects or the subjects of other nations.
Further discussion took place in 1882.110
In theory the revenue administration was highly centralized. In fact, how
ever, thegovernment was often unable to place effective restraints upon the
actions ofthe provincial governors, tuyuldars and local magnates. All revenue
matters went through the offices ofthe mustaufi al-mamalik, whose diwan was
organized ona geographical basis. Each province was under a special mustaufi
and the tax records ofthe districts and villages ofthe province were entered in
the registers forthat province. Separate departments dealt with crown lands,
auqaf, and other special matters, including arrears (baqaya).xn The mustaufi in
charge of each province prepared annually a statement of the income and
expenditure of the provincial revenues, including the drafts made on the
revenue. This would be completed before the New Year, signed by the mustaufi
al-mamalik and the first minister, submitted to the Shah for approval, and sentto
the province for action. The distribution of the village assessment (bunicha) was
made locally orby the provincial tax officials. Local expenses were defrayed by
locally raised taxes {tafavut-iQamal),usually levied as apercentage of the regular
taxes, which varied from province to province. Any excess remaining in the
provincial treasury after the payment oflocal expenses and ofdrafts drawnon
the provincial revenue, was, intheory, remitted to the central treasury, unless
the provincial governor farmed the province, inwhich case he kept the surplus.
The provincial governor, ontaking up his appointment and atthe New Year,
was required to make a "present" (pishkash) to theShah — as had been the
practice under theSafavids. The amount of these presents, which formed a
recognized part ofthe revenue, was regulated by custom. To fall short in their

amount was to lose office and to exceed was to increase in favour. Presents were
also expected when the Shah visited the residence of an official, favourite or
other person and on the occasion of royal "progresses". Similarly the great men
of the court and provincial governors themselves expected toreceive presents.
To provide forthese expenses the people were burdened with extraordinary
exactions. Their occasional protests tothe Shah against these exactions tended
to be blocked by those who hadprovided presents. The tribal chiefs were
similarly expected to transmit their tribute at the New Year.
Although intheory the mustaufis could strike a balance ofincome and ex
penditure at anymoment, in practice much confusion often prevailed. There was
no audit. Further, the mustaufis, among whom there was a strong hereditary
tendency, tended toregard the account books as their personal property and so
there was no regular government archive. Two further factors complicated the
situation: the practice of making indiscriminate drafts onthe revenue and of
farming the revenue. Neither practice was new; both had been adopted from
time to time by earlier dynasties. Officials and others, whohad claims against the
state, were commonly paid by drafts drawn on the revenue which they collected
from the treasury, the local tax officials, the tuyuldars or the revenue farmers,as
the case might be. The practice ofwriting drafts on the revenue, which became
increasingly widespread after the death ofFath All Shah, gave rise to repeated
disputes. Drafts were sometimes drawn in excess of the revenue, as happenedin
the reign of Muhammad Shah. Their value was, therefore, nominal and the
holders, unless persons ofinfluence and able to insist onthe payment of their
claims before those of other persons, were glad to sell them at adiscount of 70 or
80 per cent. The principal governors had their agents inTehran to purchase the
drafts drawn upon their province. The full amount of them would afterwards be
charged in their accounts with the government, although only a small partof
them might in reality have been paid.112 The situation in the early years of Nasir
al-DIn Shah was little better.113
Revenue farming had often been practised inearlier periods, partly because
of the central government's inability to exercise control in outlying areas and
partly forreasons offinancial stringency. It became common inthe nineteenth
century for similar reasons. Abbas Mir2a, when governor of AzarbaTjan, issaid

the province on a systematic scale andenforcing their collection,114 but his

reforms were limited and short-lived. Towards the end ofthe reign ofFath CA1I
Shah revenue farming was common throughout the empire. It was oftwo kinds.
The first resembled themuqataca contract of early Islamic times, according to
which powerful landowners farmed the duty of their estates to prevent the
vexatious interference of the subordinate officials of the revenue. Thesecond,
and more pernicious, was the system bywhich governors bidfortheir districts.
From the latter part ofthe reign ofNasir al-DIn Shah and under MuzafTar al-DIn
Shah this type of revenue farming became increasingly widespread because of
the government's ever-pressing need formoney. It was found at various levels:
from the provincial governor, who would offer alump sum atthe New Year, or
on appointment, for thetaxes of his province, to the provincial andlocal tax
officials, who farmed the taxes from the provincial governor inasimilar fashion.
The general taxstructure and broad division into first "fixed" taxes (known
as malvajihat and later as maliyaf) and secondly extra levies and requisitions were
largely the same as they had been under earlier dynasties, as also were the
purposes onwhich the revenue was expended, namely the payment ofthe army,
salaries of officials, pensions, and the upkeep of the royal court. The "fixed"
revenue consisted of taxes on the land, animals, flocks, herds, shopkeepers,
artisans and trade, revenues from crown lands, customs, rents andleases. Very
little quantitative material onrevenue matters appears to exist in either Persian
or European sources, though an examination of the records of the mustaufis
would, no doubt, yield further information.
According to Malcolm the "fixed" revenue amounted in 1810to some
£3,000,000. Macdonald Kinneir, writing about 1813, gives a figure of some
three million tumans for the total revenue and states that the land taxesand
revenue from crown lands probably amounted to two-thirds of the total.115 By
the end ofthe reign ofFath All Shah the revenue had fallen to 2,081,5 32 tumans
in cash while payments in kind were worth 379,217 tumans. The main constitu
ents ofthe latter were 163,084 kharvars (675 lbs each) ofwheat, at 2 tumans each,
12,850 kharvars of rice, at 3 tumans each, and 965 mann of silk at 6 tumans
each.116 It isnot clear to what the fall in the revenue was due. It ispossibly to be
accounted for bythe contraction in the area ofthe Persian empire and partlyby
deficiencies inthe system ofrevenue collection. By about the middle ofthe reign
of Nasir al-DIn Shah, despite the sharp fall in silk production in Gllan, the
revenue amounted to 4,361,660 tumans (or £1,744,664) in money, most of

which was from land tax, besides payments in kind in barley, wheat, rice, and
silk, valued at 550,840 tumans (or£220,3 36).117 The great famine of 1869-72
adversely affected the collection of revenue, especially from the southern,
central and north-eastern provinces, which were the most severely affected and
took several years torecover. Only in and after 1884 did the revenue from direct
taxes surpass in nominal terms the revenue of the pre-famine years. Assessments,
however, were not adjusted to the fall in the real value of the qiran (kran) or tothe
growth in agricultural production which took place in many districts. As a result
by the late 1890s government revenue from direct taxes at constant prices had
fallen compared to the pre-famine years. Curzon gives the budget for 1888—9,
which shows anincrease innominal terms due tothe depreciation inthe silver
currency, but not in real terms. The total revenue was calculated at 5 5,369,516
qirans (10 qirans = 1 tuman). Maliyat contributed 54,177,740 qirans (taxes paid
in cash 36,076,757 qirans, taxes paid in kind 10,100,933 qirans and customs
1,119,776 qirans), and revenue from other sources 1,191,776 qirans.118 By1900
the total revenue had ostensibly risen to 7,000,000 tumans,119 but the proportion
of the whole formed by land tax wasprobably slightly less than had been the case
earlier. In 1905, the year preceding the grant of the constitution, the total
revenue wasput atroughly £1,425,000. Maliyat, which consisted mainly of land
taxes, amounted to£800,000. The percentage which itformed of the whole had
fallen, but it was still the largest single item and almost double the next highest
item, which was customs.120
In the late 18th century or early 19th century the rate at which land taxwas
levied was alleged tohave been 10 per cent ofthe produce. It was raised inthe
reign of Fath CA1TShah to20 per cent, orone fifth, of all agricultural produce,or
its value inmoney, when various additional cesses, which had been imposed to
make good the deficiency ofthe revenue, had been compounded for a figure of
10 per cent of the produce.121 According to a report byR.F. Thomson, dated
1868, the figure of20 per cent was,as a general rule, somewhat exceeded and 2 5
per cent could be taken tobe the average assessment (excluding dues leviedon
cattle and flocks and duties forprovisions brought to market in the principal
towns).122

LAND TENURE AND LAND REVENUE
There was anabortive attempt under a decree of 1889—90 to return to the
standard rate of 10 per cent onagricultural produce.123 In practice, however,
there continued tobe great variety and inequality inthe rate levied in different
districts and on different crops.124
Land tax wasassessed in cash and kind, as ithad been formerly, in three main
ways: bymeasurement (butthere were no provisions for a cadastral survey of the
country as a whole), as aproportion ofthe produce, orinalump sum.The last
was the most common. Ithad the advantage of avoiding annual visits by the tax
collectors to assess the amount of the crop. Orchards were assessed by measure
ment orby the number of trees planted. Taxes paid ingrain were normally paid
at harvest time; taxes in cash in two or more instalments.
In districts not self-supporting in grain thetax,although assessed in cash and
kind, was paid wholly in cash, thepart assessed in kind being converted into cash
at one of several prescribed rates of conversion. This was also sometimesthe
case in districts from which, owing to their remoteness, theremoval of grain was
impractical. Malcolm states that according tothe general rule taxes ought to be
paid incash and kind inequal proportions. Inpractice, the proportion varied.
About the middle of the century the proportion of the total paid in kind was
rather less than one eighth, but there were many local variations. Some villages
whose inhabitants were poor paid almost entirely inkind. Wealthy landlords on
the other hand preferred to pay in cash in order to avoid the interference of
minor government officials when they came to thevillages to collect the revenue
in kind.125 From the point ofview ofthe peasants, it was totheir advantage to
pay their taxes in kind. Ifthe taxwasdemanded in cash, having small reserves, or
no reserves atall, they were often forced tosell their produce immediately after
harvest when prices were at their lowest in order to realize thecash to paythe tax.
It was also in thegovernment's interest to collect thetaxpartly in kind to
supplement its stocks of grain from crown lands.
The assessments were not kept up todate. Once made an assessment tended
to remain in force irrespective of changed conditions. It frequently happened
that a village which haddeclined in prosperity andwhose inhabitants had
decreased onaccount of war, famine, sickness or some other cause, would be
123 See further Landlord and Peasant, p . 169.
124 Rawlinson's account of practice among theMukrI Kurds in Sauj Bulagh quoted above shows something of the complexity prevailing. Ostensibly, hestates, one tenth was the government's share of the crop. In fact, however, the revenue to be realised wasdistributed by the chief among the different districts at an average rate of 2 tumans perfamily andthe minor chief or agha, or the Baba Amlra chief himself if he farmed hisown land, was at liberty to apportion theassessment among his peasants ("Notes on a journey from Tabriz", pp. 35-6). Eastwick, writing in 1861, notes that the Parsees, apart from, and in addition to, the capitation tax levied upon them, paid more than Muslims (Report, op. cit.,p. 70). 125 Malcolm, History of Persia11, 338-9.

over-assessed and conversely avillage which had increased in prosperity orbeen
newly developed would be under-assessed oreven omitted altogether from the
assessment. Broadly speaking, it would appear that the assessments made under
previous dynasties remained in force in many districts under theearly Qajar
rulers. Mirza Taqi Khan Amir Nizam, Nasir al-DIn Shah's first minister, carried
out anew assessment in 1851, many alterations in the value of the land having by
then taken place. There is, however, no evidence to show that the new
assessment infact covered the whole ofthe country. What happened atthe local
level, moreover, continued to have little relation to the rates authorized by the
central government. Whenever the latter, or the provincial authorities, felt
disposed to alter the amount of the taxes of a given district government assessors
would be despatched to the district in question. Although they were supposed to
perform their duty inaccordance with the rates authorized by the government,
great injustice wasoften done on such occasions, since the assessor would
commonly over-estimate orunder-value the taxes inproportion tothe induce
ment paid to him.126 Between about 1878 and 1882 a number of reports were
compiled onthe villages, lands and population ofmost ofthe provinces. These
were presumably intended to prepare the wayfor greater efficiency in the
assessment and collection ofthe revenue and the levy oftroops, and in 1885-6
and 1889—90 decrees were issued with a view to unifying andreforming the
assessments over the country asa whole.127 These measures, however, proved
abortive.
So far as assessments were made inalump sum, changes incropping orin the
area under cultivation were not taken into account. The government, therefore,
reaped no advantage from the increase in cash crops orfrom the expansion in the
area under cultivation which took place in the second half ofthe 19th century.
Similarly it was slow toadjust its demands toadecrease inproduction. Gilan is a
case inpoint. Before the decline inraw silk production which had resulted from
the outbreak ofsilkworm disease in 1864, Gilan ranked second toAzerbaijan in
the amount of land taxes levied on its population on behalf of the central
government. Although silk output decreased sharply in 1865 and1866, the tax
assessment remained unchanged. Many ofthe landed proprietors were conse
quently "obliged to sell their household furniture and jewelry to raise money
wherewith tosatisfy the demands of the tax-gatherer".128 In 1867-8 the govern
ment reduced its assessment forGilan byabout 20 per cent, but this was much

less than the decline in silk output. In 1869William G. Abbott reported that the
inhabitants ofentire villages had abandoned their homes and sought refuge in
shrines. Inview ofthe likelihood ofa popular commotion, further reductions
were then made in the assessment (though these reductions were misused bythe
governor and nobenefit reached the peasants).129 In 1877 there was another
reduction granted, again in response to a popular demand.130
Additional levies (farc,furuQ, sadir^sadirai) usually reckoned at somuch per
tuman of the basic tax{asI), formed an important part of the total revenue
demand. These were made on account of arrears, in response to some emergency
or special need, or simply to meet the need of the state for more revenue without
increasing the nominal rate oftaxation. The tendency was forsuch additional
levies to become permanent additions to the regular tax. Onthe other hand,
remissions on account of natural calamities or in return for some special service
were granted from time to time and these, too, occasionally became perma
nent.131 Malcolm states that the sum derived from sadir was calculated attwo
fifths ofthe fixed revenue. In theory it was levied according to definite rules,
each person paying in the same proportion as he paid the basic tax,but he alleges
that thegovernors of provinces usually exercised an arbitrary discretion in
collecting the sadir.132 Although, as stated above, various additional cesses had
been compounded not long before 1821for afigure of 10per cent and added to
the regular taxes, the government nevertheless continued to make additional
levies incapricious and arbitrary forms. Thomson reported in 1868 that "it is
impossible to discover what people really dopay in excess ofthe fixed assess
ment. Some pretend that the irregular exactions amount toa sum equal to the
legal assessments, and there does not appear to be any reason for supposing this
is an exaggeration."133
Taxes were levied onthe tribes according tothe number oftheir cattle and
flocks, or sometimes as apoll-tax orfamily tax. Insome cases they paid pasture
taxes.134 Villagers also paid taxes on cattle, sheep and other animals (maracl,

mavashi). Great variety prevailed intheir levy. InKashan, for example, mara I
was levied on sheep and goats atso much per animal which bore young and was
in milk, and mavashi, on cows, mules and asses atso much per head. Only those
living in the village and benefiting from its grazing, water and firewood werein
theory liable tothese taxes. Anyone cultivating land elsewhere and grazing his
flocks elsewhere wasexempt from these taxes in the village in which he
resided.135 Apoll-tax {sarana) was also exacted. This had nothing todo with the
poll-tax (Ji^ya) sanctioned by Islamic law and levied on ^immls, but, liktji^ya, it
implied an element ofsubjection. Inthe middle ofthe century its levy seems to
have been widespread. Thomson states that apoll-tax of one qiran was exacted
from each male over 18 years of age but that the inhabitants of towns did not pay
this tax.136 In the villages of Kashan sarana was exacted from males from the age
of fourteen.137
Among the extra levies made upon the villagers one of the most grievous was
suyursat (purveyance), which was claimed by officials travelling on government
business. Its exaction was usually attended by violence and oppression.
Muhassik (officials sent bythe central government to the provinces on some
business such as the collection of arrears of taxation or the investigation of some
dispute) were the chief offenders. Government and other functionaries travel
ling to and from their posts were also ascourge to the countryside. Mihmandars,
who conducted foreign envoys and other foreigners through the countryside,
also claimed suyursat. Referring to the practice, Morier states: "The villager
groans under the oppression, but invain shrinks from it; every argument of his
poverty is answered, ifby nothing else, atleast by the bastinado."138 An attempt
in 1851 toabolish suyursat, except forsoldiers onthe march, proved abortive.
Under the decree of 1885—6, mentioned above, the village assessments were to
be fixed according to the registers of the mustaufis and the advice of a local
council for provincial reforms. The tax was tobe paid inmonthly installments
by the kadkhuda, and as long as it was paid the tax-collectors were forbidden to
enter the village. Extraordinary levies were to be discontinued and the powerto
make levies tomeet local expenditure was tobe removed from the competence
of the tax-collectors andreferred to the local inhabitants. This decreewas
abortive. Extraordinary levies continued to bemade and virtually no change
took place inthe collection of the taxes. Further, under a decree for the making
of roads, issued in 1889—90, anew burden was laid on the village population,in

that all males from 16 to 5 o years of age were bound to give anumber of days free
labour per annum on the roads; all pack animals had tobe made available for the
same purpose. Only those persons who had performed road service were to be
given travel permits. Although there isno evidence that these regulations were
operative throughout the country - road building proceeded extremely slowly,
if at all — the fact that the government could in law exact services of this kind and,
by withholding travel permits, tiethe peasant, in effect, to his village further
emphasized thesubjection of the peasant.139
The various threads which went to make up the land tenure and land revenue
systems of 19th-century Persia were not, all in all, very different from those
which had constituted the medieval systems. The border line between the Qajar
period and preceding periods was not clear-cut. That between the 19th and the
20th centuries is more definite, though there was no sudden break. The
Constitutional Revolution marks, itis true, abreak in theory, but in practice the
change was less noticeable. The Qajar land system was rooted in the past. It was
little touched byeconomic movements until the latter half ofthe 19th century
when agriculture began gradually to beorganized ona commercial basis to a
greater extent than had been the case formerly. This development was accom
panied by, or coincided with, some change in the composition ofthe
landowning class, but it did not materially alter the status ofthe landowner or
the social philosophy upon which the land system rested. Achange inthis was
not to come until later. Further, although westernization had begun, the gulf
between thewesternized element of the population and therest had not yet
reached the dimensions it was later toattain. There was a contrast between the
wealth and influence of the landowner on the one hand and the poverty and
weakness of the peasant onthe other, but they both lived in the same world.
Society still derived its material wealth mainly from the land but the burden of
taxation rested on thepeasantry. Land ownership gave political, socialand
economic power, and the privilege it conferred was ratified (though not
necessarily controlled) by association with the state. The local communities had
no ties toeach other. So far as they were joined to any centre of authority it was
to the provincial orcentral government. This vertical organization of society,
which had been acharacteristic ofthe Abbasid empire and had survived its fall
to agreater or lesser extent, had played an important part in bringing the various
local regions and communities, with all their diversity, within the general
structure of successive empires and, perhaps, in preventing movements of revolt

based on asense ofcommon interest. Movement meant disturbance, and so the
object of government was not to foster individual initiative but to prevent social
dislocation. The aim was stability and the enemy was whatever menaced the
established order. The ideal ofthe medieval philosophers — the rule of justice
which would ensure prosperity and afull treasury toprovide for the defence of
the realm - had become tarnished, and, perhaps, was no longer sought. On the
one hand, the government, by failing to establish a regular and equitable
distribution oftaxation based on the varying extent, fertility and production of
agricultural land, deprived itself of badly needed revenue, while on the other, it
ignored the restraints which public interest required tobe placed on the use of
land. Further, by the various measures which it took tothe disadvantage ofthe
rural population, it deepened the gulf between the rural and the urban popula
tion. In short, the arbitrary nature of governmental power coupled with
insecurity from natural causes — drought, insufficient rainfall, sudden storms,
pests, earthquakes, disease — placed a check upon prosperity, while the
insecurity of tenure of the peasants and theprevalence of crop-sharing pre
vented the full development ofthe resources ofthe land and ofthe potentialof
those who cultivated it, killing their initiative and preventing them from
accumulating savings with which they could better their own position.

CHAPTER 14
THE TRIBES IN EIGHTEENTH- AND
NINETEENTH-CENTURY IRAN
The contemporary social organization of individual tribal groups in Iranhas
recently been the focus ofsome detailed studies. Historical studies ofthe tribes
have been few, however, and research into their social history has hardly begun.
The available source material forsuch a social history is mostly written from a
distance, byoutsiders viewing the tribes with hostility or some other bias. For
example, the information onthe tribes that can be gleaned from sources suchas
Persian court chronicles, manuals and local histories, and from European
agents' and travellers' reports, largely concerns such matters astaxation, mili
tary contingents, disturbances and measures taken toquell them, and inaccurate
lists of major tribal groups, numbers and leaders. Economic and social organiza
tion aretreated superficially if at all, and even for thelast two centuries their
basic features must be inferred circumstantially or deduced from later, more
complete studies.
This chapter gives in the first instance a general survey, based on available
source materials, ofthe distribution ofthe tribes and their political history as a
"problem" for the Iranian government in the 18th and 19th centuries. The
second part of the chapter attempts an analysis, on the one hand, of the processes
of ecological adaptation andsocial andeconomic organization which may be
considered tohave contributed tothe "tribal problem", and, on the other, ofthe
development of different tribal groups during the period as the product of
interaction between these various kinds of processes: ecological, economic,
social andpolitical.
At this point it should be made clear that the concept of"tribe" is notoriously
inexact, and that this isparticularly true inthe context ofIranian history, where
groups defined by a wide range of different criteria have been referred to as
"tribes". Moreover, the tribal groups commonly comprise several levels of
organization, from the camp tothe confederation; again, different criteria define
membership ofgroups at each level, and it isby no means agreed atwhich level
the term "tribe" isappropriate. Definition isnot aided by the Persian terminol
ogy, including as itdoes avariety ofwords ofTurco-Mongol and Arabic origins
(J/, cashira, qabila^ tcfifa^ tira, uymaq, ulus), many of which have been used

THE TRIBES IN l 8 T H - AND 19TH-CENTURY IRAN
interchangeably and without precision.1 For example, although there has never
been inIran a simple correlation oftribes with pastoral nomads, the usage of
several names of particular tribal groups would seem tosuggest that there was.
Thus, invarious parts ofthe country, terms such as "Kurd", "Lur", "cArab",
"Shahsevan", and "Baluch" are used synonymously with "tent-dwelling pas
toral nomad", yet these names are also used, inother contexts, ofand by tribal
groups whose members are bynomeans allnomads or even pastoralists.2
Some of these difficulties are resolved, however, in adiachronic perspective,
as will be shown below in the discussion of development and settlement
processes among the tribes. For the moment, it is enough to note that in Iran at
this period the economic life of most tribal groups was based onnomadic or
semi-nomadic pastoralism, though they varied in the degree to which other
activities (cultivation, hunting, gathering, raiding, trade) were practised; that a
common basic feature oftribal organization was a combination ofnotions of
egalitarianism, individualism, independence and primary loyalty to paternal
kinsmen; and that groups sobased, under conditions ofcomparatively dense
population and political autonomy, evolved larger, frequently militaristic con
federations, while under conditions ofstrong government control they devel
oped very different "feudalistic" class structures.
Defined in broad terms, the tribal population of Iran during the 18thand19th
centuries probably varied between one and a half and three millions, forming
from a quarter toa half ofthe total population, and predominating in frontier
districts and in areas better suited to pastoralism than agriculture.3
The essence of the "tribal problem" hasbeen summarized by Professor
Lambton as follows:
Control ofthe tribal element has been andisone ofthe perennial problems of government in Persia. Allexcept thestrongest governments have delegated responsibility in thetribal areas to the tribal chiefs. Oneaspect of Persian history is that of a struggle between the tribal element and the non-tribal element, astruggle which has continued in a modified form down to the present day.Various Persian dynasties have come to power on tribal support. In almost allcases thetribes have proved an unstable basis on which to build the future ofthe country.4
These observations apply particularly to theperiod from thefall of the
Safavid dynasty tothe rise ofRiza Khan. Throughout the period, aspirants to
power relied ontribal support, while established rulers cultivated the tribes as

sources of revenue, military levies and agricultural produce, but also feared
them as disruptive elements prone to raiding non-tribal society, to damaging
crops, to armed opposition to government, and often to dynastic ambitions of
their own. To deal with the problem, a variety of policies was pursued, the
choice and effectiveness of which depended on the strength of government and
the accessibility of the tribes concerned. Usually a form of indirect rule was
attempted, whereby the tribes were allowed autonomy so long as they kept
within certain bounds defined by the government. They were controlled by
nominating their leaders, keeping members of the chiefly families as hostages,
establishing marriage alliances between chiefly and royal families, executing
dissidents, or fostering dissension between rivals for leadership or between
neighbouring tribes. Stronger rulers, especially in the 18th century, practised
wholesale transportation of tribal groups, a more drastic policy which could
achieve several objects, not all of which were necessarily deliberate. Later rulers
sought to assimilate the tribes to the rest of the population, and attempted to
break the power of the tribes and to extend government control in the tribal
areas by replacing the hereditary chiefs with local governors, by developing
disciplined and non-tribal troops in the army, by improving communications,
and in some cases by the forced settlement of nomadic elements. However, at
times during the period, and almost continuously in some areas, government
was unable to follow even indirect rule methods, and had to recognize that its
claim to the allegiance of certain tribes was purely nominal or geographical. It
might occasionally be able to mount a predatory military expedition whose sole
aim was the collection of revenue.5
Many of these policies had been used with effect by previous rulers. Shah
Abbas I, for example, was able to replace the Safavid dynasty's reliance on its
waning charismatic appeal to the Qizilbash tribes, and tried to counter, by mili
tary and administrative reforms, the fatally weakening effect of persistent inter
tribal squabbles. Thus, he formed new non-tribal regular troops to balance the
Qizilbash cavalry, and he broke up and relocated unruly tribes on a large scale.
Among those said to have been dispersed in this fashion were the Qajar, Afshar
and various Kurdish tribes. Most of them were from the northwestern parts of
the country, which were systematically stripped of both settled and nomad
population and turned into a "scorched earth" zone to keep the Ottomans at
bay. Peasants and townsmen from Transcaucasia were sent to Isfahan, while

Khurasan was repopulated with tribespeople as a defence against Uzbek and
Turkmen raids.6
On the whole, Shah cAbbas' successors did not continue his policy of
resettling the tribes in new areas, so that the distribution of tribes at the
beginning of the 18th century probably differed little from the situation at his
death in1629.
In thepast, thetribes of Iran were commonly classified by language group or
supposed ethnic affiliations. Such criteria areoften inconsistent, misleading and
little relevant to socio-political realities,7 and it is more useful to enumerate the
tribes according to their geographical locations. For this purpose, Safavid Iran
may be divided into a number of regions, each characterized by somewhat
different geographical features affecting the tribal population.
Khurasan in Safavid times included much of present-day Afghanistan and
Turkistan, inhabited by Sunni tribes such astheGhilzai andKakar Afghans near
Qandahar, the Abdali Afghans around Herat, and the Taymani, Taimurl,
Firuzkuhi and Jamshidi Aimaqs in the Paropamisus mountains, as well asthe
Shf 1 Hazara to the east. In the mountain and plateau districts west and
northwest of Mashhad lived Gira°Ili andBayat Turks, and substantial groups of
Kurdish nomads introduced by Shah cAbbas. North of Mashhad, Afshar Turks
held Darra Gaz andTus, while towards Marv were Qajar andJalayir Turks,and
to the south Qara°I Turks and numerous cArabs. The province of Astarabad
near the Caspian was occupied by the Sunni Turkmen tribes, Yamut and
Goklen, andfurther groups of Qajar andJalayir. Beyond the northern frontiers
of Khurasan and along the Oxus lived the Sunni Uzbeks.
In the arid southeast, the Baluch and Brahui tribes were more or less
autonomous and remained so until the 19th century. The largest tribe near
Kirman was thelocal branch of the Afshar, but there were also several groups of
Arabs; their flocks may have contributed to the fine quality wool of Kirman
which was of considerable commercial importance at the time.
Westwards, in the lusher mountain and coastal pasturelands of the province
of Fars, lived a heterogeneous collection of nomad tribes. Ranging north and
south of Shiraz were those groups, mainly Turks, which were soon to form the
Qashqa°i confederation. The Il-i cArab, the Inallu, Nafar and Baharlu Turks,
and the Persian Basiri, were not to achieve political unity as the Khamsa

that name. 7 cf. F. Barth, Nomads of South Persia, pp. 131-2.

confederation until the 19th century. On the southern coast were Sunni "Arabs
such as the Huwala. To the west of the Qashqa°I were the various Luri tribes of
the Mamasani and Kuhgiluya.
Between the high central Zagros and the torrid plains ofcArabistan ranged
the largest concentration of nomadic tribes in Iran, numbering up to a million
people. Neighbours of the Kuhgiluya were the Bakhtiyari Lurs, whose chief had
equivalent status to the four Vails, the main provincial governors. At
Khurramabad, the Vali ofLuristan proper ruled over the Fail! and an amor
phous collection of other Lurs. The tribes of Luristan supplied the capital,
Isfahan, and neighbouring districts with pastoral produce. In cArabistan ranged
the Banu Kacb, Al-Kathir and Mulla°i tribes, under a Vali from the Sayyid
Mushacshac tribe, settled at Huvaiza. Many of these cArabs appear to have been
Shfl.8
The mountainous provinces of Kurdistan, Azarbaijan and the southern
Caucasus are marked by higher rainfall and colder winters than other areas to the
southeast of them. In spite of the excellent grazing grounds, pastoral nomadism
is comparatively precarious in such conditions; most tribal groups in this region
practised agriculture and tended to settle, or at least to spend the colder season in
villages. The frontiers of the region were occupied byindependent Sunni
mountain tribes, Lezgi and others to the north in Daghistan, and the Kurdsin
the west. There were also numerous Kurdish tribes in the south, bordering on
Luristan: the Zangana and Kalhur (partly ShTcT) near Kirmanshah on the main
road between Baghdad and Khurasan, and the Mukri towards Sauj-Bulagh and
Maragha. The Ardalan of Kurdistan proper were under a Vali at Sanandaj.
Elsewhere in the region Kurds were intermingled with Turks, tending to
become "Turkicized" in language, religion, and sometimes culture. Muqaddam
Turks dwelled atMaragha, and a large branch ofAfshar held Urmiya, while
north of Lake Urmiya were Kurdish tribes such as Shadlu (Shadilu) near Ararat
and the Turkicized Dunbuli atKhuy. There were Bayat Turks atMaku, and a
further branch of the Qajar in Erivan and Qarabagh, where the Javanshlr Turks
and the Qarachurlu Kurds also lived. Mughan and Ardabil were occupied by
Shahsevan, Inallu and Afshar Turks, and Mughanlu and Shaqaqi "Turkicized"
Kurds.
Finally, the tribal population of the central region of Traq-i cAjam comprised
for the most part fragments of former Qizilbash Turkic groups: Shahsevan and
Afshar in Khamsa, Qaraguzlu near Hamadan, but also Sunni Dargazin and

Garriis Kurds near the latter city. Other tribes in the vicinity of the Alburz range
would seem to have been too small to feature in the records of the time.9
The general decay of government under the later Safavids was accompanied
by other processes affecting the tribes. Chardin refers briefly to the Qizilbash
nomads, but otherwise the tribes receive little mention intravellers' accounts
from the later 17th century, which might seem toindicate a general declinein
their importance.10 Some chiefs were located in towns as provincial governors,
and their tribal following probably also settled inthe vicinity. In many cases,
tribes lost their identity, broke down or were absorbed into others. The former
Qizilbash tribes like Shamlu, Ustajlu, Zulghadir, Tekkelu, Turkman, which had
been prominent incAbbas Fs reign, were no longer so after 1700, many oftheir
surviving sections joining more resilient tribes such asthe Afshar, Qajar and
later the Shahsevan. Three quarters of a century of peace on most of the frontiers
rendered the army inexperienced and ineffective, and the tribal reserve militia
could nolonger berelied on.11
However, the peaceful conditions probably encouraged agrowth in human
and animal population among the pastoral nomads, and consequent overcrowd
ing would have accentuated the tribal disorders and raiding which appear to
have been spreading, leading in turn to aresurgence of nomadic tribalism atthe
expense of the settled population. This was occurring, it seems, particularly
among the non-Turkic, non-Qizilbash tribal groups. The Bakhtiyari and Lur
had been raiding constantly in the Isfahan district in the mid 17th century,12 but
after 1700 these tribes became more loyal to the Safavids, and the troubles were
concentrated among the Sunni tribes which predominated on the margins of the
empire. The Ghilzai made themselves independent at Qandahar in 1709, and the
Abdali followed by taking control ofHerat in 1715, while raids and incursions
by Baluch, Uzbek, Turkmen, Lezgl and Kurds intensified.13
The beginning of the 18th century found Iran in a condition of steadily
worsening administrative and military decay under the weak and misguided
Shah Sultan Husain. The death throes ofthe Safavid dynasty began with the
Afghan invasions in the south and east, culminating in 1722 in the siege and
capture ofIsfahan byMahmud Ghilzai and his tribesmen, while the west and

northwest soon fell to the Ottomans and Russians, both newly freed from
military commitments elsewhere to expand in the direction of Iran. Ghilzai rule
was shortlived, however: after gaining control of the province of Khurasan, in
1729 Tahmasp Quli Khan of the Afshar tribe subdued the Abdali Afghans at
Herat, and drove the Ghilzai from Isfahan, where he restored nominal Safavid
rule in the person of Shah Tahmasp II. In the following years, he recovered all
the lost territories.
Tahmasp Quli, or Nadir Shah as he became in 173 6, was a military adventurer
rather than a tribal chief.14 Several branches of his tribe, the Afshar, remained
opposed to him, and his following consisted of Turks, Afghans, Kurds, and
Lurs, whose basis for unity was military discipline and a common interest in
plunder. Nadir himself had little time for civil administration. Although he
established "security" in the country, his exactions, in the interest of his
perpetual martial exploits, caused much of the settled population to emigrate.
Having deposed his Safavid puppets, he broke away from the precedents of that
dynasty, establishing Mashhad as his capital and favouring Sunni tribes such as
the Afghans and Turkmen. However, he revived elements of the tribal policy of
his great Safavid predecessor, cAbbas I. Generally he governed the tribes
through their own leaders; in some cases he appears to have nominated
paramount chiefs, such as All Salih Khan head of the Haft Lang Bakhtiyari,
Muhammad Husain Khan llkharii of the Zacfaranlu Kurds at Quchan
(Khabushan), and Badr Khan Sarikhanbeglu founder of the Shahsevan confed
eration in Mughan and Ardabil.15 To punish rebels and to discourage the
Ottomans during his campaigns against them, he devastated the provinces of the
Caucasus, Azarbaljan, Traq-i Ajam and Fars. Numerous tribes were trans
ported to the northeast, where they could be supervised, defend his metropoli
tan province, and supply pastoral produce and — most important — manpower
for his army.
Thus, Nadir is said to have moved the following tribal groups on various
occasions to Khurasan and Gurgan: 12,000 Afshar families from several regions;
the Qajar, Javanshir, Turkman, Muqaddam, Inallu and Shaqaqi from greater
Azarbaljan; some A.marlu from Kurdistan; the Qashqa°i from Fars; the Zand
from Traq-i-Ajam; and some 13,000 families of Bakhtiyari from Luristan.
There were also large-scale introductions of Afghans from Herat and Qandahar.

THE TRIBES IN l 8 T H - AND 19TH-CENTURY IRAN
In all, over ahundred thousand tribal families are reported to have been moved
to Gurgan and Khurasan. Inaddition, from Kurdistan the Khwajavand were
sent toMazandaran and further cAmarlu, to Gilan.16
Nadir was assassinated in mid 1747. His reign left much of Iran, particularly
the west, drastically depopulated. Many groups escaped transportation,
slaughter and the ravages and requisitions of his campaigns by flight beyond the
frontiers orinto mountain or desert fastnesses. After his death, various exiles
began to return, though itwas not until Karlm Khan Zand came to power that
serious attempts were made to restore the country's population. In1748 or soon
after, large numbers of tribespeople who had been sent toKhurasan seized the
opportunity to return to their original homelands. These included several
branches ofAfshar, the Shaqaqi, Javanshir, and others from Azarbaijan, Zand
and Bakhtiyari from cIraq-i cAjam and Luristan, and the Qashqa°I from Fars.17
However, groups of Javanshir, Kurd, Afshar, Bakhtiyari, Shahsevan, Talish
and Bayat tribesmen joined Ahmad Khan Abdall at Mashhad on Nadir's death,
and went to Afghanistan to form the main part of the Durrani household troops.
Eventually as ShIcIs they became known as Afshar or Qizilbash, settling and
prospering in Kabul and elsewhere.18
Meanwhile Nadir's empire disintegrated under the conflicts of his succes
sors. For two years his surviving close relatives strove against each otherfor
control, before succumbing to the efforts of leaders of various other tribes,
particularly those returned from exile. Azarbaijan was for some years occupied
by one of Nadir's Afghan generals, Azad Khan Ghilzai, against the opposition
of most of the local tribes. In the central western provinces, Lurs, Laks and
Kurds came together intheir opposition tothe Afghans, and were led first by
All Mardan Khan ofthe Bakhtiyari, then byKarlm Khan ofthe Zand Laks.

CA1TKhan Afshar, whocontrolled Urmlya and Tabriz. He then established the
comparative security and prosperity which lasted throughout his domain, with
few interruptions, until his death in1779.
While Azad Ghilzai, Muhammad Hasan Qajar, cAli Mardan Bakhtiyari and
Fath CA1I Afshar were tribal chiefs, Karim Khan, like Nadir Shah, was not. He
was more of a bandit by origin; his owntribe, the Zand, amounted at most toa
few hundred families, and his following wascomposed of a mixed collection of
Lak, Lur, Kurd and Turk tribesmen. His final success in winning much ofthe
western part of Nadir's empire was due less to tribal loyalties or military
conquests than to diplomacy and luck.
Karim Khan wasrenowned for hispeaceful and equitable rule. He attracted
back many of the craftsmen and others who had fled the country during the
troubles of Nadir's reign andafter. With thetribes, heemployed similar policies
to his predecessors, though on a smaller scale. Themore important tribes were
governed through their chiefs. Karim Khan is said to have appointed, asthe first
paramount chief of the heterogeneous Qashqa°f confederation, the leader of the
Shadilu clan, who were among his early supporters, and to whom he is said to
have granted permission to return to their original pastures in Fars, his metro
politan province.19 Hesent punitive expeditions against rebel groups, andin one
case carried out a wholesale transportation: in 1763, the Haft Lang Bakhtiyari
were moved to Qumand Varamin, and the Chahar Lang to Fars. The LIravi of
Kuhgiluya too were resettled in Fars, as were some Kurd and cArab groups, to
supplement his standing army.20
He made no attempt to devastate or colonize his frontier regions, which
remained virtually independent of him. In cArabistan, the K a b under Shaikh
Salman, after long resistance, for a while accepted his sovereignty. Khurasan
served as a buffer state against the Durrani Afghans of Qandahar, under whose
influence Nadir Shah's and Shah Sultan Husain's grandson Shahrukh reigned at
Mashhad. To the northwest, the Ottomans and Russians were no threat, but
rather were preoccupied with each other. TheTrans-Araxian districts were only
nominally in Karim Khan's domains, while he managed to claim the allegiance
of the Azarbaljani chiefs by taking hostages to Shiraz. Tabriz was controlled
through the Dunbuli chiefs of Khuy. Other prominent tribal groups in the
region were the Afshar at Urmiya, the Javanshir in Qarabagh, the Shaqaqi and
Shahsevan near Ardabil, theQaradaghi, theBayat of Maku, andthe Muqaddam
of Maragha.

THE TRIBES IN l 8 T H - AND 19TH-CENTURY IRAN
Karim Khan's death was followed by a further period of dynastic struggles
and the usual accompanying insecurity anddevastation in the countryside. In
the south Zand chiefs fought for the succession, while elsewhere local leaders
pursued their own ambitions. The most influential in thenorthwest were King
Erekle II of Georgia, Fath CA1IKhan of Darband, Ibrahim Khalil Khan
Javanshir of Qarabagh, and Sadiq Khan Shaqaqi of Sarab, the last two being
tribal leaders. In Mazandaran andAstarabad theQajar chief Agha Muhammad
Khan carefully united the dissident elements of his tribe; he then recruited
support from the Turkmen of the Atrak, reduced most of the chiefs of
Azarbaljan and by 1794 had defeated the Zands inthe south. The next year, in the
face of the Russian threat, he took swift measures to reassert Iran's hegemony
over Georgia and other Transcaucasian areas, then in 1796 took Khurasan from
the Afghan puppet Shahrukh, having severely chastised the Turkmen — these
tribesmen had been allowed to move south to the Gurgan plain in return for
their aid to Agha Muhammad and his father, but had not ceased their marauding
expeditions into Khurasan.
During the short reign of "the last and most brutal of Iran's tribal con
querors"21 order was established in his domains through terror ofhis wrath and
the might of his army, but the countryside was laid waste in his continual
campaigns. He secured theallegiance of tribal leaders by keeping members of
their families in or near Tehran, the newcapital. A newaxis for the statewas
established between Astarabad and the Khamsa region of Traq-i cAjam, and
various tribal groups were brought into this area, especially into Mazandaran,
which, while facing the Turkmen raids, remained the Qajar tribal centre. Inearly
1785, when he first took Isfahan and defeated the Bakhtiyari tribes, he evacuated
Zand, Afshar and Mafi tribesmen to Mazandaran. Later some Khwajavand
Kurds, who hadreturned home to Garrus, were brought back to Mazandaran;
also to that district came other Kurds from Sauj-Bulagh, Gira°ili Turks from
Khurasan and Usanlu from Varamin. They were joined by 5,000 families of
Abd al-Maliki from the Qashqa°I confederation, which was dispersed after
opposing Agha Muhammad Khan. Another 2,000 Qashqa°I families aresaid to
have been sent to join the Bakhtiyari; however, many groups from the Zand
confederation, which was also broken up, joined theQashqa3! when they later
reformed. To Qazvin came 4,000 families of Chardauli Lurs from Fars. The
Inallu Shahsevan taken from Mughan by Nadir Shah, then located by Karim
Khan Zand inthe Qazvin area, were now joined as Shahsevan by the Baghdad!,a

large tribe brought from Baghdad by Nadir Shah or Karim Khan and now
moved to Kharaqan and Sava.22
On Agha Muhammad's assassination in Qarabagh in 1797 there were further
outbreaks of tribal dynastic ambitions in Azarbaijan, notably by Sadiq Khan
Shaqaqi, but Fath CA1IShah established control of his uncle's realm and set about
consolidating the state. He deliberately revived Safavid concepts of the absolute
and irresponsible power of the sovereign.23 No warlord, hedevoted himself
rather to civil administration and court life, and to riding and hunting,the
traditional tribal alternatives to warfare, and left the active generalship of his
numerous campaigns to his heir, cAbbas MIrza.
A major threat to the stability of the state and peace in the countryside was the
tribal system, which hadboth caused andthrived on the disorders of the
previous century. Thetribespeople were a valued source of revenue and
irregular cavalry, but leaders of larger tribes could withhold their dues, while in
the more remote regions, particularly among SunnI and non-Turkic groups,
virtual autonomy prevailed. Seeing the hereditary chiefs, andthe fanatical
devotion with which they were regarded in many cases, as a central feature of the
tribal system, Fath CA1IShah determined to destroy or at least to limit the chiefs'
power. The policies he initiated tothis end were continued by his successors.
Like previous rulers, Fath CA1I kept the chiefs ortheir relatives near himas
security for the good behaviour of their followers. At the same time, tribal
leaders used to have their representatives at court, to keep them informed of
matters concerning them. Also, Fath CA1I Shah created a wide network of
marriages linking his family with those of the important tribes.24 In addition, he
took advantage of the inability of the tribal leaders tounite, and of the endemic
state of rivalry in the chiefly families and jealousy between different groups in a
region. The principle ofdivide et impera was widely practised. When necessary,
punitive expeditions were sent, a force recruited from one tribal group being
used to chastise another, often their traditional enemies. Rebel chiefs were
arrested, often bydeceit, and many were executed. The Qajar rulers, further,
themselves appointed llkhariis and/or llbegis over themore important tribal
groups, although they usually had tonominate individuals acceptable to their
tribesmen, most often the hereditary chiefs. Recognized chiefs were expectedto

collect and pay the taxes, tomaintain order and organize military levies, which
were due both to the Shah and often to the provincial governor as well. Irregular
tribal levies continued to form the main body of the army, though attempts were
made to introduce more regular disciplined troops.
Some of the tribes were broken up and others relocated. Fath cAli Shah is said
to have brought the Duvairan and Afshar-Duvairan tribes from Mughan and
Ardabil toKhamsa, where they joined the local Qurtbeglu; together with the
Baghdad! and Inallii of Qazvin, these tribes formed a second Shahsevan
confederation. The Chardauli tribe were now sent to southern Azarbaijan,
ousting Afshar tribespeople of Sa°in-Qalca, who had tomove toUrmiya. The
policy offorced migration tothe metropolitan area was continued under later
rulers.25 The tribal list given byJouannin indicates that already by 1800 the
tribes of Iran were in astate of extreme dispersal, and Morier also observed that,
apart from the Arabs, whose chiefs were still feared, "the different tribes are
now so much spread throughout the provinces, that they have almost lost that
union which could render them formidable".26
In fact, dynastic ambitions on the part of the tribes ceased to be realistic with
the advent inIran ofGreat Power rivalry, whereby the Qajar succession was
virtually guaranteed. This new factor also gradually brought to an end the
Qajars' own military endeavours on the frontiers, and hence limited their ability
to provide the tribal militia with alegitimate source of plunder. Thus, with the
advance of the Russians in the Caucasus, Iran's northwestern frontiers were
contracted. During the two Russian wars, ending in the Treaties of Gulistan
(1813) and Turkmanchai (1828), a major preoccupation of the Shah was to
ensure the continued allegiance of tribes on both sides of the Aras. cAbbas MIrza
succeeded in bringing various tribes south of the Aras and settling them in
Azarbaijan, such as the Turkic tribes Airumlu inAvajlq, and Qarapapakh and
Shams al-DInlu in Sulduz, and several Kurdish and Turkic groups now included
among the Qaradaghi and Shahsevan. Migrations across the frontier in both
directions appear tohave continued after 1828, and also occurred extensively
among Kurds onthe Ottoman frontier.27
The northeastern frontiers were a major problem for the early Qajars. They
carried on constant military activity both intheir attempts toregain Herat and

the eastern parts of Afghanistan, and against theTurkmen and other slave
raiders, whose expeditions depopulated Khurasan, penetrating at times as far as
the vicinity of Isfahan, andseriously disrupting theimportant trade of the
northeast. British protection of Afghanistan brought an end to Iranian efforts in
that direction in the 185 os, and Russian victories in Turkistan later in the century
terminated raids from that quarter, but within Iran the nomad sections of the
Yamut Turkmen continued to resist domination bythe Qajars into the 20th
century.
Other tribal groups in Khurasan, the Kurds of Quchan and Bujnurd, and the
Arabs, Aimaq, and Baluch towards the south and east ofthe province, were
more amenable to the authority of the government. The Baluch sardars of SIstan
and Baluchistan had, under the earlier Qajars, evaded all but trifling paymentsto
the government, butthey now saw more of the tax officials, though they
otherwise maintained considerable autonomy until the 1920s. The Mamasani
and Kuhgilu Lurs were pacified by 1882, and authority was also extended over
the Arab tribes ofKhuzistan during Nasir al-Din Shah's reign. The Vilayat of
the Ardalan Kurds was effectively taken over in the 1860s, and the Kurds of
Kirmanshah were by 1907 administered bythe Kalhur ilkharii. Onthe other
hand, the settled Lurs under the Vali of Pusht-i Kuh were inaccessible enough to
remain independent during Qajar times, as were the nomad Lurs of Pish-i Kuh
and also most ofthe Kurds ofwestern Azarbaijan, the location ofthe abortive
Kurdish rising under Shaikh cUbaid-Allah in 1880.
In the second half of the 19th century, during the reign of Nasir al-Din Shah,
the power of many other tribal leaders was further weakened. Some were
replaced bylocal government officials. Security in the country generally im
proved, and raiding was suppressed. In many areas, nomadic elements were
settling in increasing numbers. This tendency was strong, as always, in
Azarbaijan, where theonly major tribal group to remain nomadic was the
Shahsevan ofMishkin, who retained comparatively temperate winter quarters
in Mughan and were not yet tempted to exchange their tents for more substantial
dwellings. Settlement was also widespread among groups recently introduced
to the north-central region, between Mazandaran and Khamsa.
Soon after 1900, Aubin held that ethnic and tribal identities were losing their
importance ina general increase of national consciousness; the only exceptions
to this process of integration were the small religious minorities, the larger tribes
and those which were remote from thecentre or could take refuge in the
mountains, though none of these could escape the royal power completely.28 In

fact, this general impression of settlement and detribalization wassuperficial and
deceptive. The conduct of the administration insome tribal areas, so far from
undermining the system, served rather to accentuate its evils. For one thing, the
Iranian army had little to do in the latter part of the 19thcentury, as in the period
two centuries before. It waslacking in experience and had deteriorated in quality
since the introduction of "disciplined" troops. The nomad tribes remained the
only effective militia, but they could be relied on only when defending their own
territory.29 Tribal levies, which had been drawn from the families and retinues of
the chiefs, were now unemployed for long periods, and increasingly turned their
energies tobanditry. At the same time, the main emphasis of administration
being onthe collection ofrevenue, in some areas the demands ofofficials
including the appointed chiefs — were so oppressive, extortionate and arbitrary
that ordinary tribesmen sought the security of joining the most effective of the
local brigands, thus forming new,non-tribal groupings under unofficial leaders.
Meanwhile the official chiefs themselves, whether through assimilation to the
government bureaucracy or through detention as hostages, became urbanized
and estranged from the majority oftribesmen, and could no longer exercise
direct control over them.30
This wasparticularly the case in some frontier areas of Kurdistan,
Azerbaijan, Gurgan and Khurasan, where the government of the later Qajars
appeared to foster both nomadism and tribalism. In the territories of the Kurds,
Qaradaghi, Shahsevan and Turkmen, where the nomads had continued for
much of the 19th century to cross the Ottoman or Russian frontiers seasonally
for grazing purposes, apolicy of maintaining a frontier strip of endemic "tribal
disorder" seems to have been tacitly revived at the end of the century as a defence
against possible incursions. Local authorities did little to curtail raiding activi
ties there, and indeed were sometimes said to be reaping a share of the proceeds.
When punitive expeditions were sent, they frequently chastized not the real
culprits but some more accessible group. Often itwas only when the tribesmen
raided across the frontier and the neighbouring power complained, that the
Iranian administration took measures, usually half-hearted. Inextreme cases,
such as with the Shahsevan of Ardabil and Mishkln in i860, a programme of
enforced settlement was initiated, but without permanent effect.31
The tribes on the northwest and northern frontiers, preoccupied with a near
anarchic situation of generalized brigandry, posed no major threat to security in

THE TRIBES IN l 8 T H - AND 19TH-CENTURY IRAN
the period before the first World War, except at a local level. Only rarely did any
of them unite in groups of more than a few thousand warriors under a leader
with ambitions on a national scale, on occasions such as the Kurdish revolt of
1880 already mentioned, and the support given to Muhammad All Shah against
the Nationalists, by the Turkmen and by the union of some Qaradaghi and
Shahsevan tribes under Rahim Khan Chalabiyanlu. None of these lasted more
than a few months. It was otherwise with the large and powerful tribal
confederations of the central and southern Zagros, the Bakhtiyari and Qashqa°i,
whose leading families were among the most influential in the country and,
whether among their tribesmen or in Tehran, played an increasingly important
part in political affairs of the later Qajar period.
The Bakhtiyari tribes, numbering up to 5 0,000 families, mostly nomads, were
the source of much trouble to the government, and were never wholly brought
under control. Their chiefly families were constantly split by rivalries, a factor
which the government was able to exploit. In the first half of the 19th century,
the Bakhtiyari chief Muhammad TaqI Khan carried out various measures
beneficial to the tribes, but excited the jealousy of the governor of Isfahan, and
was arrested by deceit in 1841. Bakhtiyari influence grew under Husain Quli
Khan, who was appointed the first official IlkhanI in 1846. After his assassina
tion in 1882, his successors continued to dispute the leadership and the inheri
tance of the considerable landed property which he and his brothers had
accumulated. With the discovery of oil in their territory, the main contenders for
leadership were able to compose their differences and play a deciding role in the
restoration of the Constitution in 1909, and they also dominated the government
in the period immediately before the first World War.32
In Fars, the Qashqa°i confederation emerged under Jam Khan early in the
19th century, and his successors as Ilkhanis of the Qashqa°I rivalled the family of
the merchant Hajjl Ibrahim at Shiraz for influence in the province. This rivalry
was exploited by the Qajar government to prevent an alliance (such as was nearly
formed in 1247/1831-32) which might threaten their own position. In 1278/
1861—62 the government created the Khamsa confederation from the Il-i Arab,
Inallu, Baharlu, Nafar and Basiri tribes, under the leadership of Hajjl Ibrahim's
grandson Mirza CA1I Muhammad Khan Qavam al-Mulk, to balance the
Qashqa°i power in Fars. The Qashqa°i were stricken by the famine of the 1870s,
their numbers falling from around 30,000 to under 15,000 families, many
sections joining the Bakhtiyari or the Khamsa, but they became powerful again

under Ismacll Khan Saulat al-Daula. During the Bakhtiyari hegemony, which
had the support ofthe Qavam al-Mulk and the Khamsa tribes, Saulat al-Daula
made apact with the Vail ofPusht-i Kuh and the cArab Shaikhs of Khuzistan,
but this alliance came to nothing. The settlement of the Baharlu, Inallu and
Nafar, initiated by the government, was largely complete before 1900. The Il-i
Arab andBasin tribes, andthemajority of the Qashqa°i, continued to be
nomads.33
Government control over the tribes weakened, in frontier areas before the
turn of the century, elsewhere during and after the Constitutionalist regime.In
most tribal areas, the period from the 1890s tothe 1920s was one of anarchy,
known as khankhanl or ashrarlikh. Some tribal chiefs managed to maintain a
degree of local stability within the general turmoil, but other areas were simply
battlegrounds for rival brigands, where raiding went unchecked, taxes were not
collected, trade was disrupted, and farming peasants were forced toleave land
and village to take refuge in town or among the brigand leaders' retinues. At the
same time, measures had already been undertaken to establish the infrastructure
necessary for the ultimate control of the tribes: a telegraph network was
spreading, roads were improving, and plans were made for railways. There were
occasional gleams of light, as when a small butwell-disciplined force under
Yeprem Khan and Sardar Bahadur Bakhtiyari dealt piecemeal with the
Qaradaghl and Shahsevan rebels in 1910,34 to show that, atthe end of the Qajar
dynasty as atthe beginning, it needed only astrong leader to subdue the tribes,
which were as incapable as ever ofuniting against determined military action.
The foregoing account, following the main emphasis in the sources, has
summarized tribal political history in the post-Safavid period in terms of theway
successive rulers dealt with the "tribal problem": how both tomake use of and
to control the warlike tribal elements in the population. For the most part, only
the activities ofthe major tribal groups and their leaders have been discussed.
Indeed, as stressed earlier, the sources rarely deal specifically or in reliable detail
with thebasic social and economic organization of tribal communities, and
mention individual tribes only when prominent insupporting oropposing the
government, when involved in inter-tribal disorders, or when transported from
one region to another.
The general view of tribal society among contemporary writers contrasted it
with settled urban society, the civilized Islamic ideal. While the city was the

source of government, order and productivity, the tribes had a natural tendency
to rebellion, rapine and destruction, a tendency which might be related to the
starkness of their habitat and its remoteness from the sources of civilization, and
also to the under-employment inherent in their pastoral way of life. Such a view
has some justification, but it is superficial and oversimplified. A better under
standing of the nature of tribal political organization, and of the relations
between tribal and non-tribal society, can be sought in a closer examination of
the social and economic basis of the tribal system. For this, the sparse informa
tion in contemporary records may be interpreted through the insights gained
from more recent studies of tribal and nomadic societies.
Many observers have noted how pastoral nomadism in Iran was closely
related to geography and ecology. The terrain and climate made much of the
country uncultivable under pre-industrial conditions, and suitable only for
seasonal grazing; as only a small proportion of such pastures could be used by
village-based livestock, vast ranges of steppe and mountain were left to be
exploited by tent-dwelling nomads. Variations in terrain and climate influenced
the kinds of animals herded and the length and type of nomadic movements. The
main herding animals in most of Iran were sheep and goats, the former
predominating in more favourable regions and the latter in more arid. There
were further variations in transport animals: camels (dromedaries, Bactrians and
their hybrids), donkeys, and horses — the latter kept formerly for military, later
chiefly for prestige reasons, often at great expense and in unsuitable conditions.
With regard to migrations, in much of Iran, especially the western half,
nomads could predict with some reliability where and when rain would fall, so
that movements of people and animals took on a regular form from year to year,
typically involving a "vertical" transhumance, between alpineyailaq (summer
quarters) and lowland qishlaq (winter quarters), in response to seasonal vari
ations in temperature rather than rainfall, a fact reflected in the terms sardslr
(cold region) and garmslr (warm region) used in southern and western Iran as
equivalents of yailaq and qishlaq. Such areas were able to support a relatively
dense animal and human population. The distances they migrated depended at
least partly on the distance between available mountain and plain pastures, and
varied from a few days' journey each year, to several weeks and hundreds of
miles. In the eastern and southeastern regions, where the time and place of
rainfall were less predictable, it was water, not temperature, which ultimately
controlled the nomadic movements. In many areas, however, there were
departures from these patterns of movement, due to the nomads' involvement in
agriculture or other economic activities.

THE TRIBES IN l 8 T H - AND 19TH-CENTURY IRAN
The basic corporate interests of nomads, as Barth has argued, lead tocertain
forms of social and political organization.35 Thus, efficiency in herding requires
the pooling of labour resources among households, which therefore co-operate
in herding units. Inmost tribal groups inIran these averaged four orfive tent
families, rarely enough toform a separate camp. Inareas with lusher and more
predictable grazing, and hence denser population, competition for pasture and
considerable inter-tribal contact, there is a need to control access to pasture,
keep outsiders away and distribute grazing among insiders, which is met by the
allocation of grazing rights to groups with membership limited by clearly
defined rules. The more predictable the grazing, the smaller such groups may be,
and occasionally (as with theShahsevan of Mughan) small groups such as
herding units and even individuals may have rights to specific pasturages to
which they can return year after year inexpectation ofgood grazing. In more
arid, variable and hence sparsely populated areas, nomads need to befree to
move "horizontally" over broader territories within which there is a reasonable
chance that rain will fall, green the steppe and fill the wells — though even here
there were well-defined territories and fairly regular movements. With denser
population and extended migrations, and particularly where the routes passed
among non-tribal villages, as in much of Fars and Kurdistan, the vulnerability of
nomad dwellings and animal property necessitated bodies ofarmed men orga
nized for defence. In such conditions, moreover, movements and grazing
patterns of different tribes must be ordered on fixed schedules and controlled by
some authoritative leader. Where the migration routes were shorter and sea
sonal grazing grounds adjoining ornearly so, as with the Turkmen in Gurgan
and many Lur groups, such problems did not arise tothe same extent, and this
was also true of the more thinly populated regions of the southeast.
Camps (khel, mal, oba)varied considerably in size, depending partly onthe
need for defence, and the extensiveness ofthe pastures, but also simply on the
gregariousness of the nomads. The usual size was 20 to 30 tent-families,but
camps ofover 100 tents were sometimes observed. Camps were led byelders
{risk safid, aq saqal).
The structure of nomadic groups was affected by cultural features common
to the area. Thus, given the legal and cultural emphasis ofthe Islamic Middle
East, the pasture-holding groups among Iranian nomads were usually based on
descent from a common paternal ancestor, andmost marriages took place
between members ofthe group. These pasture-holding descent groups (aulad,

korboh, gobek, ho^, tlrd) ranged from 20 to 200 tents and formed one or more
nomadic camps. However (to judge from recent nomadic studies) there were
variations inthe structure ofsub-divisions ofthese groups, such as camps and
herding units, apparently because the strength of the patrilineal and patriarchal
principles varied. Inthe Basiri, these smaller groups were based on avariety of
ties ofkinship and affinity, while inthe Shahsevan, Kurds, and Turkmen they
were normally smaller replicas of the larger patrilineal descent group. Similarly,
although households were allmarked bythe common principle of individual
ownership of animals, their size and composition varied. Among the Basiri and
other groups of southern Iran, aman received his share of animals and set up an
independent household onmarriage, sothat households were small and most
often based onnuclear families. Among the Turkmen and Shahsevan, onthe
other hand, aman did not separate from his father until he had children capable
of work, and sohouseholds tended to be larger and patriarchal. The Kurds
appear to fall between these extremes. Inany case, the common estimate of five
persons per household is probably fartoo low, even in the Basiri case where
Barth records an average of 5.7, while in the Shahsevan it is 7-3.36
The basic political groups, the tribes (to* if a, 11), typically numbered from 500
to 5,000 tents. Some tribes claimed common descent as a"clan", but more often
they were composed of heterogeneous elements, the essence of whose unity
seems tohave been allegiance toachief {kalantar,tushmal,khan, beg), who, with
such a following, had the power and influence to deal with local and perhaps
national authorities on terms of mutual respect. These were the "tribes" which
composed the Khamsa, Qashqa°i, Bakhtiyari, Qaradaghl, Kuhgllu, Mamasani
and other confederacies, and they correspond also towhat I have called "tribal
clusters" in the Shahsevan of Mughan.37 Often the chief found itconvenient to
recognize sections {tlra, to*if a) of his tribe, numbering from 50 to 1,000 families,
each led by an appointed headman (katkhuda or kadkhuda); sometimes the
sections coincided with thepasture-holding descent groups, and sometimes
they formed nearly autonomous "sub-tribes". Finally, theconfederacies (II,
ashlra),led by an IlkhanI or Ilbegl, numbered from 2,000 to20,000 tents; larger
unions seldom lasted long.
These various groups formed on the basis ofecological, economic, cultural
or political factors. However, other processes ofgroup dynamics, asyet little
understood, appear tohave operated toproduce two kinds of"moral commu

nity" among thenomad tribes, which usually coincided with oneor other ofthe
groups already analysed.
The first, a primary community of between 15 and 50but averaging 20to30
tents, may beuniversal among thenomads. Barth implies that throughout south
Iran this community is the main camp group, of variable structure but usually a
subdivision of the pasture-owning descent group.38 Among the Shahsevan too,
such a community (jamcfat, obd) is the main migratory camp, but here it also
usually coincides with both a descent group {gobek) and a tribal section (tlra);
moreover, it is the focus of the main religious rituals. The Turkmen oba, the
northern Kurd oba, the Bakhtiyarl ma/,and the southern Kurd khel seem also to
be communities of this kind. Probably they were the "communities" of which
19th-century observers like Morier write.39
The second kind of community is a named group of from 50to 500or more
tents, but averaging a few hundred, who occupy a distinct area of pasture and
usually trace common descent andorigins. Asthe Shahsevan ta°ifa, theJaf Kurd
tlra, theTurkmen II, andperhaps theBakhtiyarl ta°ifa, this community coincides
with a political group under some kind of leader; though this is notthecase with
the Basirl tlra, which has no political unity at all. Theessential features of such
communities are that around 90% of marriages take place within them, that
members share anumber of cultural symbols which areheld to distinguish them,
and that they exhibit great continuity as named groups over the generations.40
These two kinds of moral community mayhave been the basic constants of
tribal nomadic society in Iran, where there was so much variation in the
structure, size and composition of other groups, formed on other principles.
They are clearly based on the kind of "group feeling" Ibn Khaldun held to be
characteristic of tribal organization (see below), andthey arealso consistent with
the idea ofIranian tribalism asbased onnotions ofegalitarianism, individualism,
independence and loyalty to paternal kinsmen; cultural principles which were
otherwise belied by the political facts of strong autocratic chiefship and hetero
geneous tribal confederations.
Before chiefship andconfederation areconsidered, there arefurther implica
tions about nomadic society that canbedrawn from thenature of pastoralism. In

THE TRIBES IN l 8 T H - AND 19TH-CENTURY IRAN
Iran aselsewhere, it was a specialized form ofproduction, and never the sole
source of a community's subsistence needs. Pastoral nomads were dependent on
settled society. They needed many ofthe products oftown and village, which
they might acquire by trade, exchanging their animals or animal produce
directly or indirectly for grain or dates (their staple foods), often also for stubble
or fodder for their livestock. Nomads relied on settled artisans for a variety of
manufactured goods, some even forimportant parts oftheir tents. If political
conditions favoured them, they might extract their needs as tribute or"protec
tion money", or simply by raiding. Sometimes, nomads raised crops themselves
on their own land, orthey might have their land cultivated by share-cropping
peasants. In many cases, asingle village community included both permanently
settled cultivators and semi-nomadic pastoralists who spent half the year or
more away in the pastures.
Settlement appears to have been a continuous process among the nomads, for
demographic reasons. They could usually boast a healthier life than settled
villagers, in terms of diet and sanitation. Mobility enabled them to scatter in the
face of human and animal epidemics, and they did not stay long near their refuse,
advantages commonly reflected ina high rate ofnatural population growth.41
This led in the long term to the settlement of the surplus population, but at times
to an expansion of nomadic grazing grounds at the expense of cultivation, and to
an increase inraiding, both between nomadic groups and by nomads on settled
society. Settled people, however, whether tribal or non-tribal, were not slowto
take advantage of the vulnerability ofthe nomads' property, and historically
raiding bynomads on settlers was often provoked bythe latter.42
Settlement occurred in various ways, among both rich and poor, by individ
uals or groups, andgradually or suddenly as a result of flock disasters.43
Pastoralism is an unstable economy compared with settled cultivation. A
farmer's main asset, land, though the harvest fail totally through bad weather,
disease or depredation, remains unharmed to produce again next year. Pastoral
ists, on the other hand, have intheir animals an asset which not only is highly
susceptible to starvation, disease, exposure andtheft, andcanthereby be
virtually annihilated in a fewdays or even hours, butunlike farmland (or
pasture) will not automatically recover next season. A flock of sheep can be
reconstituted only after years of hard and careful husbandry. Apastoral house
holder, in fact, needs acertain minimum number of animals inorder to provide

food, produce for exchange, and replacement stock. Once they fall below this
number he finds it increasingly difficult to remain independent asa nomad.
Unless he can find employment as ashepherd or servant, or join a raiding band,
sooner orlater the destitute nomad drifts into village ortown asa landless
labourer. The critical size of flock depends partly on how far kinsmen are willing
to help each other out and whether the wealthy are willing to hire the poor as
shepherds. The wealthy, however, feeling the high risks involved in pastoral
ism, may sell their surplus stock; they may buy jewellery or carpets, but they are
more likely, in times of security, to choose the highly profitable investment of
farmland; they build houses and eventually become members of a wealthy
settled elite. Investment in land is not always feasible or profitable, in which case
wealthy nomads may use their surpluses to recruit employees and followers
among the poor. The result, given the nomad population growth, will then be
an increase inraiding and inencroachments on cultivated land.44
To summarize the analysis sofar, a number of processes affecting tribal
organization has been considered, some originating inthe ecology, economy
and demography of pastoral nomadism, and some in cultural premises such as
ideas of patriliny, patriarchy and individual property rights. For the most part,
these processes occur at the level of households, camps and economic organiza
tion, and lead to certain basic similarities among the tribal groups: the ability to
field large bodies of armed men, the allocation of grazing rights to patrilineal
descent groups, an expanding population, and a long-term tendency to settle
ment or encroachment on settled society. But already variations between tribal
groups with regard to camp and household size and structure have been noticed
as due to the differential impact of these processes, while other variations have
been related to external political factors, notably inter-tribal relations, nomad
settled relations, theinfluence of towns and the incidence of government
control. These factors clearly affect the higher levels of tribal organization even
more than the lower, and their importance was implicit in the summary of tribal
political history in the first part of this chapter; it is to this area of analysis that we
now return.
The main factor differentiating the political conditions and roles of individ
ual tribal groups is the degree and kind of government interference and control.
This depends partly on theability of the government, and partly on the
accessibility ofthe tribe concerned, interms both ofdistance from cities and
roads, the main organs of government, and of terrain, for example the proximity

of mountain or desert refuges. Tribesmen themselves have commonlycon
trasted "tribal" with "government" periods in their history, and itis convenient
to use these terms here too. Also, since at any one time government control
extended over only some ofthe tribal areas, and any one tribal area came under
control only part of time, the term "situation" will be used, implying aparticular
area at a particular time.
Thus, the frontier between nomad and settled, beween pasture and
cultivation, has always fluctuated with these wider political conditions. In
"tribal" situations, where governments were unable to check the encroach
ments of nomads, peasants might be forced toleave their farms and join them,or
flee totowns for protection. In"government" situations, although the nomadic
tribes were often used formilitary purposes, nonetheless farmers were usually
encouraged to extend their cultivation into the pasture lands and thus to
accelerate the natural settlement ofthe surplus nomad population. On the other
hand, nomadism has sometimes been aresponse to agovernment seeking simply
to taxandcontrol those subjects whose settlements areaccessible.45
The two situations give rise to contrasting types oftribal leadership, which
may be termed thebrigand and thechief. Following theanalysis of previous
pages, in "tribal" situations, where neither rich nor poor nomads settle, differ
ences of wealth and hierarchies of status develop, compared with "government"
situations, where the settlement process "drains off" both the wealthy andthe
destitute, and the remaining nomads are roughly similar in socio-economic
status. In the former case, moreover, with raiding unchecked, there are opportu
nities for successful brigands to collect followers and challenge hereditary
chiefs. Wherever the nomads accept the authority of government, however,
there is always a difficulty of communication between them, especially when
there are disputes between nomads and settled villagers, and there isaneed felt
by both sides for a recognized hereditary chief who has theresources both to
represent his nomad followers and to deal on equal terms with settled
authorities.46
Quite different abilities andstrategies seem called for by thetwo types of
leadership. The contrast corresponds to that made by Bailey between the
"hirelings" and the "faithful", bound totheir leader by transactional and moral
ties respectively.47 Actual leaders combined elements of the two. A brigand
commonly began with moral authority over a core of his fellow tribesmen,
though the allegiance ofother followers depended on his ensuring a continuous

flow of booty, and his authority over them was strictly limited tothis transac
tion. Then, unless he had the abilities of a Nadir Shah, he reached the limits of
expansion, andto retain his wider leadership he hadto extend his moral
authority by establishing a hereditary dynasty, orbeing recognized by a more
powerful ruler as the legitimate, official leader of his followers. Achief, on the
other hand, hadto prove himself more able to command than his kinsmen; then,
however strong the moral and symbolic authority ofthe chiefship, hehad to
maintain his personal position not only by performing the specific functions of
chiefship, but by rewarding his followers, ifnot with booty, atleast with lavish
entertainment and hospitality. Otherwise they might abandon himand support
a rival, even the chief of another tribe.48
With respect to the problem of succession, there wasin effect little difference
between the twotypes of leaders. In both cases, the practice of polygyny and the
absence of strict, recognized rules of succession ensured a proliferation of
possible heirs. The only distinction wasthat most often the surviving members
of a brigand's family were unable to display the unity and decision necessaryto
oppose rivals from another tribe, as occurred with the Ghilzai, Afshar and Zand
rulers. Achief was more likely tobe succeeded by amember of his family, but
frequently it was some time before asuitable heir emerged. All the major tribal
dynasties of the period — Qajar, Bakhtiyari, Qashqa°i - had recurrent succession
problems, though they were alleviated in theQashqa°I case by the chiefs'
avoidance of polygyny.49
However, it would appear tobe an easier task for a chief with government
support tomaintain his position than for a brigand towiden his authority. A
chief had duties to both government and his followers, and his position was
close to that of a feudal lord. Typically, he collected tax and military levies and
maintained order for the government; for his followers, he conducted external
political relations of all kinds, co-ordinated the migrations, adjudicated dis
putes, and allocated the pastures.
Little is known about the ownership, distribution andmanagement of
grazing rights in the past. Some pastures were khalisa ("Crown" land; land not
locally claimed as anindividual's property), others belonged legally to settled
villagers. Probably in most cases, grazing rights were vested in thetribal leaders,
who allocated them — usually on asemi-permanent basis, but sometimes subject
to reallotment — to patrilineal descent groups among their followers. Sometimes

pastures were treated like cultivated land, in that titular owners demanded fees
for their use,and indeed in at least one case (the Shahsevan of Mughan), the sale
and rent of specific pastures for cash were practised by the mid 19thcentury.50 In
Fars, southern Kurdistan, the Gurgan plain, and probably elsewhere, pastures
were used in successive seasons by different groups with herds of different kinds
of animals.51
The right toallocate pastures, particularly when it was recognized by the
government, wasoneof the main sources of a chief's continuing power over his
tribal followers. Inaddition, apart from various customary dues, he took for
himself a large proportion of the tax he collected, and he was given land grants
for his services by some rulers. With this wealth, supplemented by his private
land and flocks, a chief could not only display conspicuous hospitality and
generosity tohis followers and others, he could also support a large retinue
(commonly called the camala) of servants and armed henchmen to coerce
opponents.
The degree towhich a hereditary chief can monopolize wealth and power
within the tribe varies. One determinant has already been mentioned — howfar
wealthy nomads can invest in land, and hence whether or not rich and poor tend
to settle. Even in "government" conditions, this channel of investment was not
everywhere possible or profitable, less so for example among the Qashqa°I tribes
than the Basiri, with the result that the former were characterized by a wide
range ofwealth differences and hierarchy ofchiefs, sub-chiefs and headmen
subordinate to the Ilkhani, while the Basiri khan had no rivals in wealth among
his followers, who were all politically equal before him.52 Also, tribal groups
appear to have differed in their attitudes to authority. For example, among the
Kurds hereditary chiefs were rarely challenged even in "tribal" conditions,
while with government backing the begs often emerged as powerful and oppres
sive autocrats. Bycontrast, the Yamut Turkmen would recognize no hereditary
chiefs even in "government" conditions, when outsiders hadto be setover them
to collect taxes.
The size and duration of a tribal leader's following depends on anumber of
other factors, such as the kinds of ties uniting them, and the political geography
of their situation in terms of the proximity of cities, trade routes and frontiers.
First of all, tribal dynasties, atboth national and regional levels, appear to

pass through four phases of development. In the phase of expansion, a leader
recruits followers from different tribes, rewarding them usually by booty from
successful banditry. Those tribesmen most likely to leave home on raiding bands
or military expeditions with the hope of booty, are the otherwise unemployed,
usually, in "tribal" times, men from families wealthy enough to employ others
to tend their pastoral property, and men who have lost their own flocks and are
unwilling to herd those of another. The leader uses this support to gain control
of a city and its surrounding region, including the dependent cultivators.
Eventually, the expansion ceases and the establishment phase begins, whereby
the leader settles in the city and takes over the administrative machinery with the
aims of collecting revenue and controlling the tribes, who are now frustrated in
their drive for booty. In due course the dynasty becomes used to urban life and
enters the phase of decay. The peripheral tribes, now alienated from the dynasty,
refuse their support, rebel infavour ofother leaders, take over the outlying
regions and begin to converge on the city, which is now helpless without tribal
support. In the final phase, replacement, one peripheral tribe, or a coalition
under a strong leader, invades the city and a new cycle begins.
Such a cycle is similar to the model developed by Ibn Khaldiin with reference
to early Islamic history, largely on the basis ofhis observations ofnorthwest
Africa. He laid down avariety of rules defining the relations between cities and
tribes, the nature and importance of the "group feeling" which characterizes the
tribes and their original attachment to the leader, and the development, duration
and other features of the dynasty. His model and the associated rules may, with
some adjustments, be applied to Iranian history — as indeed they have been, on
both the national and the regional levels.53
Economic exchanges linking cities and nomad tribes seem to have been
considerable. Cities provided the nomads with manufactured goods and other
items, and often depended on them for supplies of meat, milk products, wool
and charcoal.54 Politically, too, the rise of the important tribal confederations of
the 18thand 19th centuries was closely related to the proximity of both cities and
trade routes. As already mentioned, this factor affected the ease with which
government could control the tribes, but italso affected the ease with which, in
"tribal" times, a tribal leader could acquire a source of wealth and security and a

base forfurther expansion. Theremoter tribes were not only comparatively free
from interference by government, it was also more difficult for a leader to
persuade them to leave home and join him in anexpedition to capture a distant
city. Ambitious leaders, local or national, needed both urban bases and tribal
support, and noruler could rely on just one of these elements.55 In fact, each of
the four tribal ruling dynasties after the Safavids had a different metropolis,
though each conqueror had first to capture that of his predecessor. Rulers then
had to make thechoice between installing tribal chiefs as official governors of
their local towns, andthereby recognizing their autonomy, orsending theirown
state officials asgovernors with the difficult task of conciliating and controlling
the local tribes.
Of the four capitals ofthe period, Isfahan, Shiraz andTehran were important
in the rise of tribal dynasties other than the rulers. The Bakhtiyari grew in
influence in Safavid times as the tribal group closest to the capital, Isfahan,
occupying at thesame time comparatively inaccessible mountain territory.The
Qajar capital, too,wasclose enough for the Bakhtiyari to occupy it in 1909.
Meanwhile, therise ofthe Qashqa°i was probably connected with thelocationof
the Zand capital at Shiraz.56 In the 19th century, the Bakhtiyari, Qashqa°iand
Khamsa chiefs gained power from their ability to control the increasingly
important trade crossing their lands. Later, these groups acquired further
influence from their relations with theBritish. Mashhad, theAfshar capital from
about 1740until 1796, was themost important trading centre in eastern Iran
apart from Herat, which waslater lost to the Afghans - andthe early Qajars
made great efforts to retain control there. The last tribal confederation to
establish a base there wasthat ledin revolt byIshaq Khan Qara°I in thereign of
Fath All Shah.
Hambly estimates that there were seven other cities of over 20,000 people in
early Qajar times.57 Three of these, Yazd, Kashan andQazvin, were important
internal trading andmanufacturing centres, but being close to Tehran and far
from major tribal areas, andmoreover situated in terrain not easily capable of
supporting large tribal armies, were not attractive as bases for expansion by
tribal leaders. Tabriz, ontheother hand, wastheconstant object of competition
between Afghan, Afshar, Dunbuliand ShaqaqI leaders during the "tribal" years
of the 18thcentury, before becoming strongly defended as the Qajars' most
important provincial capital; then in 1908-9 it was held by the Nationalists

against the pro-Qajar tribal confederation of Rahim Khan Qaradaghi. Two
other major cities were frontier trade emporia, and thus unsuitable as bases for
the control of the rest of Iran, but were themselves dominated by tribal groups
during the period: Khiiy by the Dunbull, Kirmanshah by the Kurds. Hamadan,
finally, another trade andmanufacturing centre, wascomparatively accessible to
Tehran, and dominated by the Qaraguzlii chiefs, who remained loyal to the
Qajars.
Many of the smaller cities were left in thecontrol of one of the local tribes for
all or part of the period. Although no other confederacies developed centralized
leadership on the same scale as the Bakhtiyari and Qashqa°I, some, such asthe
Shahsevan, Turkmen and Baluch, became of as much concern to the Qajar
government as were the former groups, mainly because of their widespread
raiding activities and disruption of the main trading routes. Thus, the
Shahsevan, whose chiefs had controlled the small city of Ardabil until 1808,
were prominent in the later Qajar period for their pillaging in Russian Mughan
and on the caravan trade from Tabriz to Julfa, the Caspian and Tehran, which
caused theRussians to putpressure on theIranian government. In the southeast,
the Baluch raided widely, while Turkmen forays, particularly on the Tehran
Mashhad road, made both cultivation and trade highly perilous in northeastern
Iran throughout the period, as has been mentioned above.
Except in the Turkmen and Baluch cases, there was always a necessary
relation between theimportant tribes andthecities. An ambitious tribal leader's
first aim was the capture of a city; a hereditary chief, on the other hand, would
find himself in a city either as hostage or on official business, and he too
inevitably made a base there. When either type of leader came to town, he
brought some of his immediate followers, and they would settle as his servants
or henchmen.58 Theparadox often developed, as Ibn Khaldun observed, that a
tribal dynasty needed a settled base, but once established there it was corrupted
by the luxuries of urban life, and sooner or later drew away from most of its
original tribal support.
Ibn Khaldiin's "group feeling" is a moral sentiment, arising from common
descent andethnic and cultural similarity. Such a sentiment would seem to have
played a minor part in the rise of the ruling dynasties of 18th- and 19th-century
Iran, which all came to power with the support of coalitions of disparate ethnic
elements, held together for themost part bynon-tribal, transactional bonds such
as military discipline anda desire for plunder. However, the religious fellowship

which united the Qizilbash tribes under the Safavids had its legacy under their
successors. Both Nadir Afshar and Karim Khan Zand used Safavid puppet
Shahs to help legitimate their authority, while the Qajars, apart from reviving
Safavid notions of absolute sovereignty, depended in the first place on a tribal
cohesion akin to the "group feeling" of Ibn Khaldun. Nonetheless, the tribal
forces which brought the Ghilzai, Afshar, Zand and Qajar rulers to power were
heterogeneous and all except the Zands included substantial Sunn! elements.
As for the duration of the ruling dynasties, the quick demise of the Ghilzais
and Afshars was due in part to the behaviour of Ashraf and Nadir, but in both
cases, as in that of the potentially better founded Zands, there wasa fatal lack of
moral commitment in their tribal support.59 The Safavid andQajar dynasties, on
the other hand, owed much of their longevity to the "group feeling" established
in their original rise to power, though both were in theenddecisively affected by
quite external factors. Thus, the long peace on the Safavid frontiers was oneof
the factors which allowed that dynasty to decay to the extent that it quickly fell
when finally attacked, while the Qajar dynasty wasboth confined and supported
by the rivalry of Britain andRussia, which both accelerated its decay and delayed
its end.
On a local level, populations are more likely to be united by moral senti
ments, especially within regions such as Kurdistan, Luristan, Baluchistan and
Azarbaijan, which are of comparative ethnic homogeneity. But this does not
mean the people of such regions are necessarily all tribally organized, let alone
likely to form large tribal confederations. Actually, the history of tribal trans
portations in Iran meant that many areas such as Fars, Kirman, Khurasan, and
the region between Hamadan, Tehran, and Mazandaran, were quite mixed
ethnically, and anyway, the major confederations, some of which came from
these regions, were of composite origins. Nonetheless, tribal groups in a locality
are capable of developing "group feeling" even when they are of different
origins and speak different languages. When such groups occupy neighbouring
territories and give their allegiance to a common chiefly dynasty, although this
political union mayhave begun fortuitously as a result of a forced migration, or
with quite material objectives, it may well, after a few generations, develop
cultural symbols of common identity, and disparate origins may then be
discounted as politically irrelevant. For example, in Fars, where the component
tribes of the Khamsa andQashqa°i confederations have lived for some centuries,
the former areknown as " Arab", andthelatter as "Turk", even though they are

of highly varied languages and origins.60 Similarly, the Shahsevan tribes of
Mughan, which were partly Kurds indigenous to thearea and partly Turksand
others introduced before 1700,hadby themid 18th century achieved political
unity andby the 19th century were regarded as ethnically one. Bycontrast the

more recently by Nadir Shah ortheearly Qajars, have remained forthe most part
distinct politically and ethnically.
Other processes affect inter-tribal politics. In the absence of effective supe
rior authority, relations between autonomous political units within aregion take
on afamiliar chequer-board character: neighbours maintain relations of hostility
on their boundaries, butally themselves with their neighbours, forming a larger
pattern of two coalitions or blocs throughout or even beyond theregion. Such
chequer-board andbloc patterns have been recorded at several levels: in Fars,
where recently the Khamsa opposed the Qashqa5! butallied with the Mamasani,
who opposed the Boir Ahmad who were consequently allied with the Qashqa°I;
among the Kuhgilu tribes in the early years of this century; among the
Shahsevan tribes ofMishkin andArdabil around 1920; inthe case ofthe Sherep
and Choni blocs of the Yamut Turkmen in Gurgan; andamong the Khanates
and tribes of Transcaucasia and Azarbaljan during the 18th century.61
Where government or other supra-tribal leadership wasabsent for a long
period, andparticularly among Sunni tribes near the frontiers, groups of Sayyids
or other religious authorities living ontheborders between hostile neighbours
might be employed to mediate between them.62
The factional opposition of tribes in a region mainly involved theleaders of
the political units, andsubordinate leaders frequently upset a balanced relation
by defecting, with their followers, to theother side. Sometimes the alignments
extended into urban society, aswith theQashqa°i and Khamsa leaders in Shiraz,
or the Shahsevan in Ardabil in the early 20th century when therival Qojabeglu
and Polatlu tribes supported the local factions of the Nicmati and Haidari
respectively.63 Outof this factional tendency arose thenotorious reluctance of
tribal groups to combine on a regional, let alone a national basis; but tribal

combinations were still the largest and most effective organized political
groups. When a strong leader did seek to control a whole region, he usually
gained support first from one bloc alone, andformed it into a confederation to
overcome the other; such tactics were employed both by the main conquerors of
the period, and by established rulers in their tribal policies.
It remains to be considered how far, in 18th- and 19th-century Iran, the
nomads lost their tribal identity and organization upon settlement. The available
information istoo sparse topermit detailed discussion, butsome general trends
can besuggested. Settlement meant the abandonment ofpastoralism and mobile
tent-camps for cultivation and fixed dwellings; it clearly also involved a loss of
political mobility andprobably of independence. The degree to which settlers
became detribalized depended toagreat extent onwhether they settled inanarea
where they could identify with thedominant ethnic group. Forexample, when
Kurds settled in the mountains where they were the majority element, they
maintained their identity and forms oftribal organization; but where they settled
in the plains among communities of Turkic peoples, they were quickly
Turkicized. The tribes settled near Tehran under the Qajars soon became
detribalized, while the Qajars themselves maintained the forms of their tribal
organization until the 20th century. Thesettled cArabs of the Gulf Coast and
Khuzistan retained their identity, yet the cArabs of the Khamsa, even when
remaining nomads, became assimilated with the Persian-speaking majority.64
Other factors were also important: whether the nomads settled as individuals
or in kinship-based communities, and whether propertyless or asowners of the
land. Where nomads settled aslandless individuals inpeasant villages, they very
quickly lost their tribal identity. On the other hand, where kin-groups of
nomads settled to cultivate their own land or the land oftheir chief, they might
well retain their tribal identity fora long time, asdidseveral Shahsevan groups
which settled inthe vicinity ofArdabil. Yet the loss oftheir physical and political
mobility and the fluidity of their nomadic groups, and the acquisition ofan
attachment toplots ofland and greater security ofhome and property, gave their
social organization characteristic peasant forms: notably atendency to factional
ism within the community, usually arising from bitter quarrels between kinsmen
and neighbours over land. Not surprisingly, settled nomads lose their martial
qualities and become even less willing to leave home for a campaign.65
Chiefs and other wealthy nomads who settle as landowners may continue to
be known as tribal leaders, buttheir relation with tenants andother cultivating

dependants, even when of tribal origins, cannot betermed "tribal" leadership,
as it is usually indistinguishable from non-tribal landlord-peasant relations.
Many settled tribal leaders maintained mobile retinues ofarmed henchmen,but
so did all local khans, tribal or non-tribal, in many areas.66
At any one time, substantial parts ofmany tribal groups were settled or semi
settled. Considering the demographic process of constant flow of population
from nomadic camps to villages andtowns, these settled tribesmen canbe seen
as in a state of transition, sooner or later to endin detribalization. The basis of
tribally organized society in Iran was pastoral nomadism. The politically
important tribal groups inthe period were almost all nomadic or semi-nomadic,
and their importance must berelated to their potential, when united bya strong
leader, for raising considerable bodies of cavalry. Although these armies, when
mobilized for campaigns away from tribal territory, rarely exceeded a few
thousand men, they were still the best organized and most formidable in the
country atthe time. Onthe other hand, the forces that settled tribal leaders could
muster were numbered only in hundreds andwere usually active only locally.
However, those tribal elements active asa"problem" innational political affairs
were bynomeans drawn exclusively from the nomads. The core ofthe military
forces wielded by the larger confederations comprised first, warriors from the
leading families, who tended to form part ofboth settled and nomadic society at
once, and secondly, their armed retinues, recruited from the destitute, both
nomad and peasant.
The political organization of tribal groups in Iran during the 18th and 19th
centuries has been analysed here as resulting partly from the bases of group
solidarity, partly from thevarying influence of government and wider political
relations, and partly from the nature ofongoing relations with urban and settled
society. The possibility of some general evolutionary trend in tribal organiza
tion has notbeen considered, butthere is in fact little evidence for this.67 Apart
from the general process ofsettlement ofthe surplus population, major changes
in nomadic society that didoccur were largely duenotonly to theinfluence of
government butultimately to that ofthe Great Powers, Russia in the north and
Britain in the south. Atthe same time, the tribal situation at the end ofthe Qajar
period in many ways resembled that at the endof the Safavids, two centuries
earlier, and to agreat extent coincided with that predictable from Ibn Khaldun's
model. The tribal leaders were urbanized; the tribal groups located near the
cities were settled and becoming detribalized; while inthe mountains and on the

frontiers there wasa resurgence of martial nomadic tribalism. The significant
difference between the early 20th century and the early 18thcentury, in this
light, is that — again largely due to external influence — the dynasty that replaced
the Qajars was of a totally new character to those that succeeded the Safavids.
APPENDIX
A number of writers have putforward ideas on the evolution of the tribal system in Iran during this period. Forexample, dePlanhol, seeing the period from the 18th century to the present asthe heydey ofthe large composite confederations ofnomadic tribes such as the Qashqa1!, Bakhtiyari and Khamsa, argues that they emerged in conditions of maximum grazing density of the pastures, extended migrations, andclose contacts with non-tribal villagers, and that they represented the final evolutionary stage before settlement.68 However, this view does not account for the facts that numerous tribal groups which lived in such conditions didnotform confederations, that others did not live in such conditions andyetbecame settled, andthat geographical location, national and international politics were major factors in the rise of the three confederations mentioned. Besides, several Qizilbash tribes under the earlier Safavids had been composite confederations of the same order as these,69 though by 1700, when thenew groups were emerging, the Qizilbash hadmostly been broken up, settled or widely scattered.
Another writer, Vilchevskiy, discussing thenorthern Kurds, held that by 1800, the chiefs having become vassals of the Ottoman or Iranian rulers, a feudal system of relations developed among thenomads, accompanied by a breakdown of the old tribal system of kinship solidarity and communal organization. Under the feudal system the pastoral economy collapsed, revolts broke out, and the current organization of oba communities developed, each led bya capitalist oba-bashl.10 The unilinear evolution from tribal to feudal to capitalist stages implied in this argument seems too rigid, and the timing suggested is certainly premature for other Kurdish areas. In southern Traqi Kurdistan, for example, Barth argues that there aretwocontrasting systems, the tribal (democratic and lineage-based) and thefeudal (hierarchical and land-based), which tend to alternate over time, though in thepresent century thetrend away from tribalism has been irreversibly established.71
A further Soviet writer, Rostopchin, basing his argument on the account ofthe Tsarist officer Tigranov, maintained that the Shahsevan tribal confederation, formed with military purposes by Shah cAbbas I, flourished in the 17th century butby the 18th had broken into its constituent parts. One ofthese, the Shahsevan ofArdabll, developed a feudal system of relations based on the chiefs' control ofpastures. The system was in the last stages ofdisintegration when the Russians became familiar with it inthe 19th century.

THE TRIBES IN 18TH- AND 19TH-CENTURY IRAN
Actually, there is no evidence for the formation of a Shahsevan tribal confederation before the 18th century; the Ardabil group did not exist as a political entity until then, and might have reached its peak in the 19th century had it not been for the advent and policies of the Russians in Shahsevan territory, crucial factors in the tribes' development which Rostopchin quite overlooked.72

CHAPTER I 5
THE TRADITIONAL IRANIAN CITY IN THE
QAjAR PERIOD
The heading for this chapter is deliberately imprecise. It refers tourban life inthe
period immediately preceding that when the many changes occurred which
thrust Iran into the 20th century: large-scale importation of European goods;
the development of an export market for some indigenous commodities; the
increasing effect upon theeconomy of foreign banks and currencies; and, at a
humbler level, the appearance of the kerosene lamp and cooking-stove, the
sewing-machine and, later, thetypewriter, thebicycle and radio. There are no
dates to mark the passing of the traditional Iranian city, butwhat this chapter
endeavours topresent isaportrait, along the lines ofPeter Laslett's enquiry into
the social conditions of pre-industrial England, of the world that the Iranians
lost in that transition.1 Such an undertaking is fraught with problems of
description, analysis and interpretation. The documentation which served as the
starting-point for the researches into medieval and early modern France of the
A.nnales School, so influential inthe development ofthe "new" social history, is
almost wholly lacking for 19th century Iran. Statistical data isscarce. Surviving
records, personal memoirs and correspondence from Qajar times, while attract
ing increased attention from historians, have survived haphazardly. The re
searcher remains dangerously dependent upon the subjective accounts of
European diplomats, travellers and missionaries. Thus the chapter which
follows, focusing mainly upon the reigns ofAgha Muhammad Khan, Fath CA1I
Shah and, to a lesser extent, Muhammad Shah, is based upon an amorphous
body of random facts andpersonal observations.
How many Iranians were there inthe world which they have lost? The size of
the population of early Qajar Iran cannot be known with any degree ofcertainty.
In thefirst quarter of the 19th century SirJohn Malcolm proposed the round
figure of six millions. The French diplomat and orientalist, Pierre-Amedee
Jaubert, opted for just over six and ahalf millions. ABritish diplomatic report of
1868 (by R.F. Thomson) suggested that thepopulation was between four and
five million. Lord Curzon, in 1891, reckoned nine million and Colonel A.I.

Medvedev, in 1909, tenmillion.2 What can bestated with certainty is that the
way of life of the majority of Iranians in the early Qajar period was rooted in
sedentary agriculture or pastoral nomadism. Only a small proportion lived in
anything approaching a truly urban environment. Nevertheless, cities and
towns had animportance which had nothing to dowith the sum total of their
inhabitants. As religious and administrative centres, as focal points for the
exchange of goods and services, and asthe repositories of literacy, culture and
material comforts they continued to nourish traditional civilization.
The most prominent urban centres were, with few exceptions, those which
enjoyed a continuous history going back toatleast the beginning ofthe Islamic
era: Isfahan (the largest city inIran atthe beginning ofthe 19th century), Shiraz,
Mashhad, Tabriz, Kashan, Yazd, Kirman, Hamadan andKirmanshah. Only
Tehran, selected by Agha Muhammad Khan for his capital, wasa relatively
recent foundation where villages had been. After these major centres came those
with a more restricted regional importance, Shushtar, Dizful, Sanandaj,
Maragha, Sari and Astarabad, and the special category of ports and entrepotsfor
foreign trade, Enzeli (Anzali), Bushire, Bandar cAbbas, Rasht and Khuy. There
were also market-towns, often little more than overgrown villages, which owed
their existence tobeing located atapoint where roads ortracks converged, or to
being a natural outlet for local agricultural produce. Sometimes, such modest
settlements served the needs of a quite extensive (and typically, transmontane)
hinterland.3 Ingeneral, most urban centres were situated atgreat distances from
each other, most villages were similarly isolated from their neighbours, and the
entire countryside wascharacterized by a sparsity of population, dueto the
prevailing aridity, except in such atypical areas asAzarbaljan and Mazandaran.
In much of Khurasan the raids of Tiirkmens and Baluchis had,over many
decades, contributed to the depopulation of once-flourishing districts.
Contemporary European estimates of the size of early 19th-century towns
and cities were mostly guesswork, based upon a combination of personal
observation andinformation provided by local Iranians. The latter may have
been less well-informed than their interrogators assumed, andthey may have

Juvain looks to Sabzavar, Isfarayin to Bujnurd, Jajarm toBujnurd and Gumbad-i Qabus. Centres ofplains onthe plateau are often saline, waterless andsometimes treacherous; mountain ranges areinvariably dissected by river courses which arepassable for most of the year" (pp. 99-100).

had their own reasons for exaggerating or minimizing thefigures. A local
revenue official, for example, might be inclined tounderestimate the size ofthe
population upon which the revenue-assessment was based. Moreover, foreign
ers who asked many questions may have provoked suspicion, and a consequent
desire tomislead them. Inthe absence ofany reliable statistics, however, these
estimates possess an intrinsic interest, and even a qualified authenticity.The
most complete setof figures forthe urban population in the early part of the
reign ofFath CA1T Shah is that assembled by John Macdonald Kinneir prior to
1813. In thefollowing paragraphs thediscussion is based on hisestimates.4
In the first part of the 19th century Isfahan was the most populated city inthe
kingdom. Malcolm believed that what had been apopulation of some 100,000at
the close of the 18th century had doubled tonearly 200,000 by 1815 as aresult of
improved administration andincreased security, a view shared by Kinneir.
Herat, viewed by the Qajars as part of Iran, although in actuality occupied by the
Durrani Afghans, came second with approximately 100,000.5 Its size goes far to
explaining the preoccupation of successive Shahs with itsrestoration to Iran.
After Isfahan and Herat came tencities of which the population of each was
reckoned to exceed 20,000. Among the largest of these may have been Yazd,
which Kinneir thought "large and populous . . .Yezd is the grand mart between
Hindostan, Bokhara, andPersia, and is, consequently, a place of considerable
trade. Theba^ar is well supplied, and the city contains twenty thousand
houses".6 The last figure may be an exaggeration butreflects contemporary
opinion that Yazd was a large, flourishing commercial centre. Tehran, the
capital, was believed to have a population which reached 60,000 in the winter
months, although when the Shah, with his troops, made his annual progress into
the provinces in late spring or passed the summer encamped at Sultaniya, and
those who could quit the heat of the city forthe cool of the villages around
Shamiran, the population wassaid to fall to 10,000. Butthe city grew in
population year byyear. Asone observer put it,
. . . since the city has become so populous, houses are found more profitable than trees or flowers; and in few parts of the empire do so many handsome and commodious buildings
4 Kinneir, Geographical Memoir. An officer in the East India Company's Madras Native Infantry, Kinneir was attached to the 1808-9 mission of Sir John Malcolm (his cousin) to the court of Fath AIT Shah, and thereafter travelled extensively in Iran and in the eastern vilayats of the Ottoman Empire. He was the Company's Minister in Tehran between 1824 and hisdeath in Tabriz in 1830. The population figures quoted in this chapter are taken from the Memoir, which is fully indexed. 5 For Herat, see Kinneir, op. cit., p. 182, and Elphinstone, AnAccount of theKingdom ofCaubulw, p. 216.

appear on the same space of ground. Here every man of rank and fortune, all who aspire to the sovereign's notice, endeavour toprocure a dwelling; the rent therefore, and the price of land, elsewhere comparatively trifling, have risen here so considerably, that, asI understood, Tehran in these articles of expense, nearly equalled any European metropolis.7
Mashhad, Kashan and Kirmanshah were probably all of a similar size.
Mashhad was said to contain apopulation of5 0,000. Kinneir omitted afigure for
Kashan but thought it "oneof the most flourishing cities in Persia".
Kirmanshah was described as possessing 12,000 houses: Kinneir seems to have
reckoned on four persons toone house.8 Hamadan and Shiraz were said tohave
a population of 40,000 each. The population of Shiraz had declined following its
demotion from being the Zand capital and itsterrible chastisement by Agha
Muhammad Khan, but its fortunes began to recover with the appointment of
Fath CA1I Shah's son, Husain cAli Mirza, asbeglerbegl ofFars in 1797. Contem
porary estimates ofits size varied greatly.9 The same was true ofTabriz, which
Kinneir put at 30,000, describing it as"one ofthe most wretched cities I have
seen in Persia", despite thefact that it was theusual residence of the heir
apparent (vall-Qahd), cAbbas Mirza. But Kinneir was not alone in his opinion: Sir
William Ouseley also thought that thegreater part of the city was in ruins,
despite evidence of bustle and enterprise in the bazaar. Qazvin, transmontane
depot for the Caspian trade, was reckoned tohave a population of25,000, and
the same size was attributed to Khuy, the entrepot through which passedthe
commerce with eastern Anatolia and theBlack Sea ports.10
After these twelve major urban centres (ifHerat be included among them),
there were atleast fourteen more with populations between approximately ten
and twenty thousand. Tabas, Turshlz and Kirman (the last recovering slowly
from Agha Muhammad Khan's sack of 1794) were said tocontain 20,000 each.
7 Ouseley, op. cit. in, p. 121. See also Kinneir op. cit., p. 119, and Ouseley, op. cit. in, pp. 119—20. 8 Kinneir, op. cit., p. 132. In the late 18th century, Kirmanshah was described as "alarge village" (Buckingham, Travels 1, pp. 175-6). In1796 itappeared to have no more than eight or nine thousand inhabitants (Olivier, Voyages in, p. 23). A visitor in 1836 reckoned a population of thirty-five thousand, but by this time Kirmanshah had experienced, first, aquarter ofa century of expansion, and then, a decade of decay. See Southgate, Narrative 11, p. 137. 9 Against Kinneir's figure of 40,000, others estimated the population of Shiraz to be considerably less. Ouseley believed itto be nearer 20,000 than 30,000 (Trave/si, p. 26). James Morier went to some effort to obtain an accurate figure on the basis of bread consumption patterns, as well as information provided by local notables. He concluded that the population was between eighteen and nineteen thousand. See Morier, Second Journey, p. i n . 10 For Khuy, see Kinneir, op. cit., p. 154, and Ouseley, op. cit., in,p. 377. Morier, however, believed Khuy tohave a population offifty thousand, ofwhich the majority were Armenians. See Morier, op. cit., p. 299.

Turbat-i Haidarl, ruled during the early part of Fath CA1I Shah's reign by a
virtually independent adventurer, cIsa Khan, had 18,000. Nishapur, Maragha
and Shushtar were reckoned to have 15,000 inhabitants, with Dizful somewhat
less. Close to these wasErivan, with a population estimated at between 13,000
and 14,000. It had suffered from the passage of Agha Muhammad Khan's troops
in 1795, felt at first hand the effects of the wars of 1804—13 and 1826—8, was
occupied bytheRussians in 1827 andformally transferred to Russia bytreaty in
the following year.11 Urmiya, Burujird and Lar had populations of around
12,000; Zanjan, between 10,000 and 12,000; andBihbahan, 10,000. There were
also several cities and towns for which Kinneir omitted figures altogether.
These included Ardabil, Astarabad, Qum, Rasht, Sabzavar and Sari. Ouseley
reckoned that Qum contained 1,700 to 2,000 families, butseems to have madeno
allowance for students, pilgrims andmendicants.12 Rasht was a major commer
cial centre, and Fraser, who visited it in 1822,judged its population to be
between 60,000 and 80,000 (which seems excessive), while he put Sari at between
30,000 and 40,000.13
The remaining towns were extremely small. Bushire, despite its importance
in the Gulf trade, was said to have no more than eight to nine thousand
inhabitants, andtheother ports were substantially smaller. Most, however,had
potential for growth, andso hadmany small marketing-centres whose location
pointed to future expansion, ranging from Kazarun, with three to five thousand,
to Ahvaz, containing only six or seven hundred.
Kinneir's figures constitute a serious attempt to collate such information as
was available during the first ten or twelve years of the 19th century. It is
interesting to compare these with estimates made half a century later by two
other British officials, K.E. Abbott between 1847 and 1866,14 and R.F. Thom
son in 1868.15
When considering therelative importance of different cities inthe early Qajar
period, it is interesting to note those which possessed sufficient commercial
importance to serve asmints. In the tabulated list which follows, themint-towns
of Agha Muhammad Khan and Fath CA1IShah are placed against those ofthe last
Safavid ruler, Shah Sultan Husain, and of Nadir Shah. That a few cities
continued as mints throughout a century and a half of great instability is
undoubtedly significant, but the fact that so many cities and towns served as

In general, city life seems to have benefited from the relative tranquillity
which characterized the reign of Fath CA1IShah and was in such marked contrast
to the anarchy that had prevailed throughout much of the 18th century. Tehran,
as the capital ofthe new dynasty, was the most conspicuous example of urban
growth, but several provincial centres gained from being the residence of the
beglerbegi (or provincial governor), especially when the latter was one ofthe
Shah's sons. The Qajars reverted tothe Saljuq and Safavid practice ofappoint
ing the ruler's brothers, sons, or grandsons to provincial governorships. When
the appointee was aminor, an experienced va^ir was attached tohis court, with
duties similar tothose ofthe Saljuq atabegs. The practice ofdistributing royal
princes throughout the provinces contributed towards the social and economic
revival of provincial capitals, since each prince maintained hisown court, a
miniature version ofthe Tehran court, and this stimulated anincreased local
demand for essential and luxury commodities, and for services ofmany kinds.
On the other hand, the proliferation of petty courts (in effect, ameans of easing
the fiscal burden ofmaintaining Fath cAli Shah's vast progeny onthe central

treasury) meant that the provinces had to bear the expense of the prince's
household and entourage, while being exposed to the extortion and tyrannical
behaviour which frequently characterized a prince's attendants, servants and
soldiers. Moreover, at a local level, each prince followed his father's example in
relieving himself of the maintenance of his ownoffspring by a process of further
delegation of authority. Thus, in the early 1820s, the beglerbegi of Mazandaran,
Muhammad Qull Mlrza, had appointed his eldest son as deputy-governor of
Barfurush; another, of Astarabad and Ashraf; a third, of Amul; and a fourth, of
Tunakabun. "This practice", wrote acontemporary British observer, "gener
ally proves asevere aggravation to the burdens of the respective governments;
for they have tosupply the expence [sic]ofkeeping up a petty court and its
rapacious officers, while they are relieved of little, if any, of the regular taxes due
to the crown."17
One positive aspect of the system deserves some emphasis. While the Qajars
were not patrons or builders on the scale of the Timurids or the Safavids, they
were responsible for the construction of a substantial number of public struc
tures, the building of which involved the employment of considerable numbers
of both skilled craftsmen andunskilled labourers, as well as stimulating a market
for bricks, wood, stonework, marble, decorative tiles, and other materials (see
below, Ch. 24). Agha Muhammad Khan hadpalaces erected andgardens laid out
at Astarabad, Sari and Tehran. Fath All Shah built extensively both in Tehran
and elsewhere.18 His example was followed bysome of his sons, including
Muhammad cAli Mirza at Kirmanshah and cAbbas Mirza at Tabriz, while
subordinate notables such as the Vali of Ardalan, the sardar of Erivan and the
khans of Turshiz and Turbat-i Haidari attempted to do the same, although on a
more modest scale.19 Occasionally, members of the royal family (including
women) provided such public amenities as water-cisterns, fountains and
bridges, as well as commissioning bazaars and caravanserais as private invest
ments. A few courtiers and high officials followed suit. Most 19th-century
towns contained fine public residences, often elaborately designed and decor
ated, built for local notables and rich merchants.20

The Qajar Shahs actively sponsored the building ofnew mosques orthe
extension of old ones. Existing examples can be seen in Tehran (Masjid-i Shah
and Masjid-i Sipahsalar), Qazvin (Masjid-i Shah), Kirman (Masjid-i Bazar-i
Shah), Kirmanshah (Masjid-i Jamic), and Simnan (Masjid-i Shah). Almost all
date from Fath CA1I Shah's reign. Fath cAli Shah also spent generously on
additions tothe two shrines at Qum and Mashhad, aswell as on the tombof
Shah-Chiragh in Shiraz and of Shah Nicmat-Allah at Mahan. Nor were the Shfl
sanctuaries in Iraq forgotten.21
There wasneither incentive nor the resources for the Qajars to undertake the
founding ofnew settlements oreven the renovation ofolder sites, inthe way
that Shah cAbbas I had remodelled parts of Isfahan. Tehran, which had been a
relatively unimportant meeting-point ofconverging roads under the Zands,
was the dynasty's only enduring exercise in urban development, although Fath
A.1I Shah was said to have been planning the construction of a new capital near
Karaj along European lines, with broad streets and open squares.22 He also
founded anew town at Sultanabad (nowArak) in 1808and seems to have toyed
with theidea of reviving theoldIlkhanid site of Sultaniya.23 Sometimes,
however, anew settlement or suburb would grow up spontaneously in response
to local needs. Typically, this would occur ifthere were a natural failure in the
water-supply, calling for the sinking ofnew wells orthe construction of new
channels in aqanat system. Amodest example of this process of urban renewal
was late 18th-century Turshiz, where the initiative came from the local ruler,
cAbd-Allah Khan. George Forster, perhaps the first European to visit the town,
wrote ofit in 1784:
Adjoining to old Turshish, called also Sultanabad, which isof small compass, and surrounded with awall, Abedulla has built a new town, in an angle of which stands the karavansera, the only one I have seen inPersia, which isnot interiorly supplied with water. Thechief and hisofficers reside in thenewquarter, where isalso held the market.24
During the 19th century, itwas those cities located closest to the frontiers,
and therefore most exposed toattack, which were most likely to experience
efforts at restoration and revival. The most conspicuous evidence of such
activity was the repair or reconstruction of town walls and gateways. Tabriz, as

THE TRADITIONAL IRANIAN CITY IN THE QAJAR PERIOD
a city of both commercial and strategic importance on account of its proximity
to the Ottoman and Russian frontiers, began to recover from the state of
decrepitude which had characterized itthroughout the preceding century, but
the pace was slow. Perhaps the authorities mistrusted their ability to prevent it
falling into Russian hands.
There are a number of references to the repair of the fortifications of
Kirmanshah, Khuy, Erivan and Astarabad, all of which were adjacent to
exposed frontiers. Khuy may have earned more praise from foreign visitors than
any other city in Iran. Kinneir wrote raptuously of it: "There is no town in Persia
better built ormore beautiful than Khoee: the walls are ingood repair; the
streets are regular, shaded with avenues of trees; and the ceilings of many of the
houses are painted with infinite taste."25 Fraser, writing in 1834, thought that
"Khoee, one of the few fortifications in Persia that approaches regularity, is a
town of considerable size, and rather better laid out than usual . . .I observed
many good houses in i t . . . and though there was no want of ruins, the aspect of
the place upon the whole was less mean than that of most towns in Persia. The
bazar, . . . though dull and rather ill-filled, was extensive, and kept in tolerable
repair."26 Erivan was renowned for its strong natural defences and the impres
sive fortifications maintained byits governor between 1807 and 1827, the
famous sardar, Husain Quli Khan, which were said to be the strongest inthe
country.27
Thus, restoration and renewal were not unknown to Iranian cities in the
Qajar period, and some of the more elaborate construction schemes involved a
considerable expenditure, the employment of large numbers of craftsmen and
manual workers, and a demand for building-materials. Nevertheless 19th
century European travellers inIran generally regarded the cities which they
visited with contempt. Whether or not their attitude was the result of failure to
encounter the anticipated splendours of the Orient of The Thousand andOne
Nights, of Lalla Rookh, or of Sir William Jones, with few exceptions they
condemned Iranian cities for their squalor, dirt and decay. They repeatedly
stressed the crumbling walls, dilapidated buildings, and neglected monuments,
all of which clearly pointed to a marked decline in economic activity and
population over the past century and a half since the time when Chardin and
Tavernier were writing. These views were largely the expression of personal
impressions, but they can not be dismissed. The decades of political anarchy and
social disintegration which separated late Safavid from early Qajar times had

THE TRADITIONAL IRANIAN CITY IN THE QAJAR PERIOD
undoubtedly pressed hard upon the urban population. The results were obvious
to virtually all foreign observers.
The general outlines of all the cities in Persia are the same. They are surrounded by a mud, and sometimes a brick wall, flanked at regular distances with round or square towers. The streets are narrow and dirty, having a gutter running through the centre; and the houses, which are low, flat-roofed, and built of brick or mud, have each a small court surrounded by a high wall. They have seldom or never any windows to the street; and that part of the sitting-rooms which fronts the court is entirely open, with alarge curtain to let down when the rooms are not in use. The palaces of the nobility, although mean in their exterior appearance, are both convenient and elegant within . . .The bazaars, or market places, in some cities, particularly those of Lar and Shirau^ may be accounted handsome buildings, but the mosques, minarets, and colleges, are the chief ornaments of the Persian cities.28
Kinneir's summary description of a typical Iranian city in the first quarter of the
19th century issustained repeatedly inthe vignettes of contemporary ornear
contemporary travellers, such as inHenry Layard's account of Burujird: "The
town . . . contains about twenty thousand inhabitants, and isthe largest inthe
province. It possesses several handsome mosques, whose domes and minarets
give ita striking and picturesque appearance from a distance, and stands in the
midst of extensive gardens and orchards, irrigated by streams coming from the
hills."29
Writers such as Kinneir and Layard sometimes misinterpreted what they saw;
sometimes their reactions were idiosyncratic and their comments blandly opin
ionated; and they almost never had access to the kind of statistical data prized by
modern social historians. As noted above, despite these limitations, such
writings remain the most extensive source-material available for a conspectus of
urban Iran on the eve of those profound changes which would take place as a
result of increasing contact with the West. In order to illustrate both the
usefulness and the limitations of the genreof travel-literature as applied to urban
history, descriptions oftwo cities have been included here virtually in extenso.
Although Sari and Astarabad differed from urban centres onthe plateau on
account of terrain, climate and proximity to the Caspian, both were provincial
capitals, both were major commercial entrepots, both were affected by proxim
ity to the frontier (Sari, by the Russian maritime presence in the Caspian ports,
and Astarabad, by the Turkmen marches and, beyond them, Khiva), and both
had been intimately connected with the early history ofthe Qajar dynasty.
George Forster, travelling in disguise from India to England, reached Sari in
January 1784, at a time when that city was still thecapital of the rather

circumscribed territories controlled byAgha Muhammad Khan (atthat junc
ture, absent from thecity), and the entry in hisdiary reads:
On the 26th, atSari, . . .afortified town and the residence ofAga Mahomed Khan, the chief of Mazanderan, Asterabad, and some districts situate in Khorasan ... The market of Sari isplentifully supplied with provisions, among which is seen the grey mullet, a fish abounding in allthe rivers which fall into the southern shore ofthe Caspian sea. Sari is rather a small town, butcrowded with inhabitants, many of whom are merchants ofcredit, who resort thither forthe purpose ofsupplying the chief and his officers with articles offoreign produce. Asociety of Armenians is established in the vicinity of the town, where they exercise a various traffic and manufacture a spirit distilled from grapes, of which Aga Mahomed drinks freely, though this habit does not seem tooperate tothe prejudice ofthe people. This chief has the reputation ofbeing attentive to business, and of possessing an extensive capacity, which is indeed obviousto common notice, throughout all parts of his government. The walls of the town are kept in good condition and the ditch though narrow isdeep, and sufficiently tenable against any forces now existing in this country. A palace has been lately built at Sari, acommodious neat structure, though of limited size, and has amore compact appearance than any building which I have seen inPersia. The front is occupied by a small esplanade, on which are mounted three pieces of cannon, with carriages ofgood workmanship fixed onthree wheels.30
At first glance, this account may not strike the reader as particularly informa
tive, but it is notwithout itspoints of interest, including the market in fish,
indicative ofthe source ofprotein inthe Mazandarani's diet. It shows Sari as a
resort of merchants, anda place which is both well-provisioned andwell
protected, as well as being the headquarters of an able and effective local ruler.In
fact, the three elements ofa flourishing commerce, anadequate supply ofbasic
commodities, and certain security went together. Forster noted that the mer
chants were drawn to Sari to service the court, and from this the city benefitted.
Agha Muhammad Khan's firm control over the surrounding countryside,
symbolized bythenew palace, with itsguardian field-pieces. Were the latter
made locally, or were they evidence of increasing commercial contacts with
Russia?
Thus, in theearliest decades of Qajar hegemony, the link between urban
prosperity anda stabilizing political presence was clearly, if inadvertently,
recorded by this travelling Englishman. Nearly forty years later, his compatriot,
James Baillie Fraser, visited Sari, and his impressions were rather different.
It [Sari] was for along time the residence of Aga Mahomed Khan, who . . . retreatedto this province, and established himself at Saree, long before he gained the supreme power.
30 Forster, op. cit. n,pp. 197-8.

THE TRADITIONAL IRANIAN CITY IN THE QAJAR PERIOD
The town may have been more populous and prosperous in former times than itnow is; but there are no traces of it ever having covered more ground. Its circuit does not, I think, exceed two miles; and it issurrounded by a wall and ditch, which till lately have been suffered to fall so much into disrepair, that aman might, in many places, run down the ditch and up the face of the wall without difficulty. Some repairs were, however, at this time inprogress . . . There is noattempt at order or regularity within the town. The streets are left altogether unpaved, and are often quite impassable in bad weather, owing to the depth of the mud . . , Large open spaces are to be met with in many quarters, which are perfect swamps, and which in rainy weather become ponds of water, into which all sorts of filth are thrown. These cannot fail tohave a very prejudicial effect upon the health ofthe inhabitants . . .
These strictures applied equally tothe commercial quarters ofthe city:
The bazaars, which all communicate together, are extremely miserable, consisting of double rows or lanes of shops, few of them better than huts, which cross each otherat right angles, and are covered from the sun and rain by sheds constructed of wood, tiles, and thatch. There are a few rows of booths of a still worse description at the end of these; and a dirty open space in the vicinity of the bazaars serves as a market-place, where every Thursday the produce of the country round, as sugar, cotton, grain, fruit, meat, fish, and vegetables, is brought to be exposed for sale. Articles of consumption are plentiful and cheap . . .
The last sentence echoes Forster's comment upon the availability ofprovi
sions in Sari, but Fraser was farless impressed than his predecessor by the
gubernatorial residence:
The palace, which was built by Aga Mahomed Khan, makes no great appearance externally; but Ihave been told that it formally contained much comfortable accommodation; certainly those parts of it which I saw were far from magnificent . . . All was clean and tolerably spacious, but without any splendour whatever. The whole of this palace, though not regularly fortified, is surrounded by a wall, and capable, to a certain extent, of defence.
There are five medressas or colleges in Saree, none of which arein any way conspicuous; and there are likewise five public baths of note, besides several smaller, and a few belonging to private individuals. 1know of no other public buildings in the place.31
On the subject of Sari's water-supply, animportant matter fora Middle
Eastern city, henoted that
there isa very fine old abumbara, orcovered water cistern, of immense size, which is always used in the hot weather, and from its great depth and capacity, and the thickness of its vaulted roof, which protects the water from the heat of the sun, itis always cool and

refreshing. Several of these ancient cisterns are tobe found indifferent quarters of the
town; and there is one of modern date, built, asI was informed, bythe mother of
Mahomed Koolee Meerza [governor ofMazandaran].32
Fraser, like all 19th-century travellers in Iran, was faced with the problem of
trying to estimate the population of the cities which hevisited. OfSari, he
complained:
1 have found that my attempts to ascertain the population of Saree were attended with the imperfect result too common to such enquiries. According to the best accounts, the town contains between three and four thousand houses; but as it is the seat of a court, and the residence ofseveral noblemen attached toit,many ofthese houses contain from twenty to one hundred persons, so that ahigher average than usual must be allowedto each house; probably there may be thirty toforty thousand souls within the walls.33
For all its obvious limitations, Fraser's account of Sari provides considerable
information on the capital ofMazandaran, even ifhis observations need to be
collated with those of other visitors. Like Sari, Astarabad exemplified in many
ways the typical Iranian city of the Qajar period. Itwas of considerable strategic
importance because itwas located close to the Turkmen frontier, and itwas the
departure-point for caravans bound for Balkhan andMangishlaq, and for
Khiva. Once again, Fraser is anadequate guide.
The circuit of the present city [of Astarabad] is about three miles and ahalf; and it is surrounded with a wall of mud, once lofty, thick, and formidable, strengthened by numerous towers, and defended by awide and deep ditch; but the wall has mouldered down to amere mound of earth, upon which has lately been raised aparapet, of height sufficient to screen a man, and little more than a foot thick, loop-holed for musketry, and serving to connect such of the towers as yet remain, orhave been rudely repaired; the ditch isnearly filled up with rubbish, and inmost places has been converted into rice fields. It is needless to add, that the whole would prove quite indefensible against troops of the least resolution.
In former times the city was still more extensive, and the wall embraced within its circuit astrong fort called Kallah Khundan; but Nadr Shah [sic], jealous probably of its strength, and of the disposition of the inhabitants to rebel, ordered the fort to be demolished, and the town to be contracted to its present limits. Like most cities in Persia, the greater part is in ruins, and there are not now more than from two to three thousand houses within its walls.34
Fraser found the bazaars of Astarabad to be "tolerably extensive, but poorly
filled", and he thought that there were " n o buildings, either public o rprivate,
deserving of particular notice".35 On the other hand, unlike travellers to other

THE TRADITIONAL IRANIAN CITY IN THE QAJAR PERIOD
Iranian cities, who commented so unfavourably upon housing arrangements,he
was much struck bythedomestic architecture of Astarabad:
the extensive gardens and numerous trees which are mingled in allquarters withthe buildings ofthe place, produce a very agreeable and varied effect, inopposition to the monotonous and sterile aspect of the grey mud-walls and roofs of the southern towns and villages. The houses, too, are picturesque and pleasing, both in shape and colour: they are constructed chiefly of wood, and frequently furnished with verandahs resting upon wooden pillars. The style of their architecture islight and open, more in the Indian than the Persian taste; theroofs raised to a pitch arecovered sometimes with redtiles, sometimes with thatch, and extend far beyond the walls. Many houses are fitted up with lofty baudgeers [badglrs], literally "wind-catchers", square towers having openings on each side that act like windsails, conducting the wind into the rooms of a house, and which are used in many eastern towns, as Bushire and Bussora. They are built in the shape of towers, roofed with tiles, and produce an enlivening effect, equivalent to that of spires, in the landscape. There are besides numerous detached buildings of irregular forms, that contrast happily with the dead and lofty walls bywhich others are surrounded.
This account conveys the impression of an isolated but quite prosperous and
self-contained community, quite typical ofthe more positive aspects of urban
life inthe early 19th century, but inone respect Fraser found Astarabad unique:
all the streets are well paved with stone; a regular drain runs along the centre of the principal ones, while a slighter hollow is seen in the smaller lanes and alleys, towards which the sides have agradual inclination. This carries off the water, which in most other Persian cities stagnates in pools, or ploughs up and destroys the streets in its course. The inhabitants owe this essential addition to their comfort to Shah Abbas, who probably,at the same time that hemade the great causeway through Mazunderan, ordered all the bazars and public streets to be paved, that they might be rendered passable in all weathers, which, it may beremarked, they could hardly ever be in somoist and rainy a climate, without such aprecaution. The people are so sensible of the great utility of this measure, that they not only keep up the pavement of the public streets, but have causewayed all the small lanes leading to their private houses; an attention to neatness which gives to Astrabad anairof comfort and cleanliness to which we had long been strangers.36
Fraser thought that the palace of the deputy-governor, Badic al-Zaman
Mirza, a ten or eleven year old grandson of Fath CA1I Shah, " a miserable
establishment" and apparently he knew little or nothing of Astarabad's long
association with theQajars, especially Agha Muhammad Khan. Ashas been
mentioned already, such dynastic connections could be ofgreat significance for
the survival and growth ofurban communities during the early Qajar period.
36 Ibid,pp. 8-9. Compare Layard on Isfahan: "threading our way between mud-built houses, the most part falling inruins, through narrow, paved streets, deep indust and mud, and choked with filth and rubbish", Early Adventures, 1, p. 309.

THE TRADITIONAL IRANIAN CITY IN THE QAJAR PERIOD
Astarabad hadbeen Agha Muhammad Khan's birthplace andit seems that
during the course ofhis lifetime he lavished upon it considerable attention.He
repaired and strengthened the walls and gateways, had the ditch cleaned and
widened, and converted a substantial amount ofurban property into vaqf?1 He
also ordered the construction of a palace forhimself (an inscription overthe
main gateway dates its construction to 1206/1791-2), and although Fraser found
it tobe so insignificant in 1822, James Morier, who viewed it in 1814, thought
otherwise. It was, he wrote,
still an excellent building, even superior to the palaces of Teheran. Itis entered as usual by a maidan or square, that leads to the principal gate, which islofty, and well ornamented with gilding and paintings. . . . From the gate we entered into alarge well paved court, planted with orange trees, now loaded with fruit. The farthest end of the court is occupied by a very lofty Dewan Khaneh orhall ofaudience, supported by two immense wooden pillars, and painted all over with the portraits of the old Persian heroes. On the sides are large rooms, also very curiously painted . . . and over them are suites of upper apartments, from the windows ofwhich a great tract ofthe country surrounding the town is to be seen. Behind theDewan Khaneh is a large anderoon^ or thewomen's apartment, strongly secured byvery massive doors.38
Both Sari and Astarabad were the residences ofgovernors who were mem
bers ofthe royal family. When such "prince-governors" were themselves able
men, ambitious to develop the resources of their provinces, their capitals gained
accordingly. Such was the case, to alimited extent, with Tabriz under the rule of
cAbbas Mirza, and Shiraz under Husain cAli Mirza, another ofFath CA1I Shah's
sons, but the most conspicuous example ofa provincial capital benefitting from
princely patronage was Kirmanshah under Fath CA1IShah's eldest son,
Muhammad cAli Mirza. This prince was beglerbegi ofKurdistan, Luristan and
Khuzistan for some eighteen years prior tohis death in 1821. During that time
Kirmanshah, as theofficial headquarters of his government, grew and pros
pered as a result ofhis deliberate efforts toimprove it. His motives were partly
political, partly pecuniary. Muhammad CA1IMIrza held fiercely to the conviction
that heshould be his father's successor and, had heoutlived him, there canbe
little doubt that he would have vigorously disputed Muhammad Shah's acces
sion.39 With such ambitions, Kirmanshah, strategically situated on the highway

39 Although Muhammad CA1I MIrza was Fath CA1I Shah's eldest son, his mother was merely a Georgian concubine in the Shah's harem, and therefore hewas excluded from the succession in
favour of his half-brother, cAbbas MIrza, who was of Qajar descent on both sides. Muhammad CA1I MIrza, an able, energetic warrior, bitterly resented this exclusion and competed, with great success,
against cAbbas MIrza for the loyalty ofboth the military and the zulama. Probably it was only his premature death in 1821 which prevented alife-and-death struggle with the heir-apparent, of which the outcome would have been far from certain.

between Tehran andBaghdad, anda natural strongpoint from which to overawe
the tribes of the province, possessed forhim a special importance. First, it
provided anexcellent base where he could recruit and train a military force
capable of keeping in check hisKurdish neighbours, andespecially the powerful
Vail of Ardalan; of threatening the Ottoman vilayatof Baghdad; and, when the
time was ripe, ofsallying forth towin for him the Peacock Throne. Further
more, it served as a safe refuge where, if threatened orattacked by rivals, he
could maintain himself for an extended period, knowing that his family, his
treasure and his arsenal were secure. Finally, itprovided an appropriate setting
for his growing prestige and pretensions.
In this way, Kirmanshah, which had been a conspicuous casualty of the
disorders of the 18th century, acquired a newlease of life. First, Muhammad cAlI
Mirza strengthened and extended the city's fortifications. Then, he constructed
a suitable palace to serve as the setting for his court, which was an imitation of
that of his father in Tehran. Thereafter, he commissioned various public
buildings, including bazaars and caravanserais, which he leased to traders at a
profit.40 Finally, he offered positive incentives for merchants and craftsmen to
settle inhis capital, thereby increasing his annual revenues and providing the
means for himto expand his forces andenlarge hisauthority. Thelife of the city
acquired a quickened tempo. Its appearance wasrefurbished byMuhammad All
Mirza's building programme, which created a demand for labour and materials.
The court and garrison provided an expanding market for goods and services.
This, in turn, stimulated the circulation ofcoin inthe bazaar and promoted
mercantile activity both within the city itself and inthe surrounding villages,
since there was now an increased demand for foodstuffs and fodder.41 Further
more, Kirmanshah was situated ona major trade-route used extensivelyby
merchants and pilgrims passing between the Iranian plateau and the vilayatof
Baghdad, where the Shici shrine-cities of Najaf and Karbala were under Otto
man rule. Muhammad CA1I Mirza's strict administration of justice and his firm
40 A contemporary was told that Muhammad All Mirza was "agreat speculator and trader, and encourages commerce in others, as far as such a disposition in himself will admit of it without thwarting his own personal interests", Buckingham, op. cit., i, p.178. 41 No reliable figures are available for the size ofthe garrison ofKirmanshah under Muhammad AITMirza. In 1809, according to an eye-witness (Monteith, Kars andEr^eroum, pp. 5 8-9), the prince led adaring raid into Russian-occupied territory between Erivan and Tiflis with 25,000 cavalry, but it is unlikely that this force was made up exclusively ofhis own provincial levies. Buckingham, in 1816, heard that a force of a thousand infantry and five hundred cavalry was maintained in and around Kirmanshah distinct from the tribal auxiliaries upon whom the prince could call in an emergency (Buckingham, op cit.y 1, p. 180). These, with their families and servants, together with numerous hangers-on ofthe court, would provide local grain-merchants, suppliers of fodder, and market-gardeners with regular business.

handling of the tribes within his jurisdiction undoubtedly increased the security
of the caravans passing through his territories, and from this he benefited both
materially and in reputation.
Even without such measures, Kirmanshah, with itsfavourable location on
the caravan-routes, would probably have benefitted from the relative stability
which characterized the early Qajar period and which some observers believed
had greatly enlarged the commerce of the kingdom.42 But with Muhammad cAlT
Mirza's death in 1821, Kirmanshah entered upon aperiod of internal dislocation
and economic decline asthe city passed from one governor to another, all of
whom seemed to be venal, weak, or acombination of both. An English traveller
in 1844 noted the city's "mean appearance" and felt that "decay presents itself
whichever way the eye of the spectator turns".43 Of Kirmanshah in 1845, a n
acute French observer wrote:
Mohamed Ali [Muhammad All MIrza], feeling the necessity of attaching the population to his interests, administered the affairs of his government in a truly paternal manner. His chanties had enriched thetown, and thepeople lived in theenjoyment of plenty. Unhappily they were driven out of it by the tyranny ofhis successors, who considered nothing buttheir personal interests. Now thesplendid bazaars of Kermanshah are deserted; nine tenths ofthe shops are shut; and if some unlucky fellow, imagining the possibility of gaining a trifling profit, exposes a few goods, his venture rapidly disappears under the hands of an undisciplined soldiery, who give themselves up to every description ofexcess, certain that they dosowith impunity.44
On the subject ofthe administration ofone ofMuhammad cAlI Mirza's suc
cessors, Muhibb cAli KhanJMaku^I Shujac al-Daula (beglerbegl of Kirmanshah,
1841—8), yetanother traveller wrote:
When I was inKermanshah, in 1846, I witnessed the most distressing spectacle I ever beheld. The province was fearfully oppressed by this fiend inhuman shape, Mohib Ali Khan, who had bought its government from Hadji Mirza Agassi. He had coolly seized what every man possessed, and had driven away their flocks and herds to his own estates at Makoo near Ararat. The people were picking grass in the fields to eat, and the children were naked and emaciated, except the stomach which was unnaturally swollen . . . In one street Ipassed through in the town, the people were lying on each side at the last gasp of death from starvation. I shall never forget one whole family, father, mother, and several children, lying together ina heap, unable to move from inanition.45
Whether such horrors were directly due to the extortions of the governor,or
to factors beyond the control ofthe rather ineffective provincial bureaucracy, it

is significant of public feeling that, as soon as thenews of the death of
Muhammad Shah in September 1848 reached Kirmanshah, the inhabitants rose
against their oppressor, who fled to Azarbaijan, never to return. This is not an
isolated instance of the way in which, given half a chance, outraged townspeople
would turn on their oppressors.
The passages quoted above reflected the contemporary viewpoint that the
fortunes of a particular town ordistrict atany given time depended to a very
large extent upon the character and competence of the local officials. Obviously,
there were other, noless volatile or unpredictable factors at work, but the
personal element cannot be disregarded in assessing the fluctuating fortunes of
different urban centres. Not only Kirmanshah, but the well-being of 19th
century Isfahan, Mashhad, Shlraz and Tabriz was inextricably linked with the
actions of successive governors. Astarabad benefitted from royal favour to
wards a city whose history had been so intimately connected with that ofthe
Qajars. Sultanabad in Arak was literally willed into being as aresult of Fath All
Shah's decision to found a new town there. Yet even more significant than
dynastic caprice, itwas good and bad harvests, storms and drought, protracted
outbreaks of lawlessness in ahinterland or along atrade route, and changes in
supply and demand in distant markets, perhaps the result ofmovements in
world trade beyond the comprehension of those who were the victims of them,
which had most effect upon the lives ofthe urban population.
The distance betwTeen the larger cities, as well as most of the smaller towns,
contributed not only totheir physical and psychological isolation, and toan
abiding parochialism, but made it impossible to move bulk commodities (and
especially food) over considerable distances. Thus, urban communities could be
exposed to quite local but extremely severe shortages of basic needs as a result of
regional crop-failures which, because of the distances involved, the condition of
roads unsuitable for wheeled vehicles, and the lack of navigable rivers, could not
be offset by imports from other regions. As a result, famine conditions could
develop very quickly, and although only a limited area might be stricken, the
authorities were incapable of doing anything about it. The accounts of Euro
pean travellers in 19th-century Iran are replete with references to droughts,
crop-failures, local shortages, and sometimes (as in the case of Kirmanshah in
1846), devastating famines. The extent of these disasters and their impact upon
the economic life and social fabric of the communities involved deserve detailed
research.
Another sporadic but ever-present hazard was the outbreak of an epidemic
for which no cure was known at the time and from which there was no respite

until the particular scourge disappeared as mysteriously (inthe eyes of its
victims) as ithad come. Cities which attracted large numbers of pilgrims, such as
Mashhad, or through which pilgrims and corpses passed to the shrine-cities of
Iraq, such as Hamadan and Kirmanshah, were particularly vulnerable to sudden
outbreaks. In 1830, forexample, cholera and plague, sweeping through the
eastern vilayats ofthe Ottoman Empire, eventually spread into Iran asfar as
GUan, Mazandaran and Gurgan.46 Naturally, Kirmanshah and Hamadan were
among the first Iranian cities to be affected as the pilgrims returning from Iraq
mingled inthe crowded bazaars and spread disease. Both cholera and plague
continued to take their toll for aperiod of some four years, depopulating towns
and villages, and disrupting commercial and manufacturing activities. What all
this meant in terms of population-growth can only be a matter of guesswork, but
Fraser, entering Kirmanshah in February 1835, has left a graphic picture of utter
desolation.
Till within these three orfour months, the place has been constantly ravaged by the plague, which clung to itfor three years uninterruptedly, and carried off nine-tenths of the inhabitants. The first object we observed on approaching the place, was an extent of acres, absolutely, of fresh graves - that is, all within these two years. The next were the roofless walls of the houses whose inhabitants now tenanted these graves. The gate of the town itself was fallen in, so as scarcely to leave apassage for our horses, and we rode along almost entirely through ruins tothe caravanserai where we put up.47
Similar accounts ofother places in other years indicate a fearful mortality
from epidemics, famine, and the diseases which accompany protracted malnutri
tion. Survival in 19th-century Iran could be precarious. Thus, in 1840, Layard
wrote: "Shushtar was at one time aprosperous and wealthy city, as is proved by
the many well-built houses which it contains, forthe most part, however,
deserted and falling to ruins. The plague, cholera, and bad government had
reduced it to a very poverty-stricken and desolate state. The plague alone, which
had desolated the province of Khuzistan in 1831 and 1832, had, it was said,
carried off nearly 20,000 ofits inhabitants." InDizful, it was the same story.
"These frequent feuds [between rival families in the town], added to the plague,
cholera, and misgovernment, had greatly reduced the population, and left a
considerable part ofthe town in ruins. . . ."48
In spite of these hazards, however, the comparative isolation of19th century
Iran's urban communities enabled them to maintain their traditional patterns of
life, subject to only sporadic interference from outside. The growing literature

THE TRADITIONAL IRANIAN CITY IN THE QAJAR PERIOD
relating to the Muslim city has frequently addressed the question of the extentto
which the traditional Middle Eastern city was able to develop autogenous, if not
autonomous institutions.49 What is clear is that, if it never came close to
evolving the kind of self-governing corporate institutions characteristic of
medieval Europe, its inhabitants did enjoy (although defactorather than dejure) a
substantial degree ofinternal self-government, if, by that term, is understood
the day-to-day regulation of the city by its own indigenous patriciate, rather than
by external regulatory agents. These patriciates were, typically, composed of
inter-related families ofprominent merchants, but might also include leaders
among the city culama and some local landlords. In19th century Iran, the leaders
of ward and city, the kadkhuda and the kalantar, spokesmen on behalf of the
citizens with theShah's representatives, were recruited from this patriciate.
In Qajar times formal relationships between the Shah's government and the
cities were derived from Safavid precedents. Most large centres were the
headquarters of a provincial government and served as the permanent residence
of the provincial governor, or beglerbegl, but the latter was concerned with
much more than the affairs of his capital. Itwas the business of the province asa
whole (and sometimes more than one province) which absorbed much of his
attention, and he often spent long periods of time away from his headquarters,
pursuing rebels, mediating with restless tribes, and forcibly collecting taxes. Not
all provincial governors were Qajar princes. Some were men ofquite humble
origin and these would notbeexpected to maintain the quasi-royal state of
Husain All Mirza in Shiraz or Muhammad All Mirza in Kirmanshah. Hajjl
Ibrahim Khan, who was appointed beglerbegl of Fars byAgha Muhammad
Khan before becoming his Sadr-i Aczam, came from a merchant family of Shiraz;
Muhammad Husain Khan Amln al-Daula, appointed beglerbegl of Isfahan
province by Agha Muhammad Khan, was a former grocer; and Manuchihr
Khan Gurgi Muctamad al-Daula, the beglerbegl of Isfahan province during the
reign of Muhammad Shah in the 1840s, was a Georgian eunuch. In the case of the
former two it can be taken for granted that they were more familiar with local
conditions in Shiraz and Isfahan than any scion of the royal house. But
irrespective of the background of the beglerbegl, the presence of his entourage
was a fact oflife tothe inhabitants ofthe city inwhich he resided. On the one
hand, as has been noted above, they had tobear the cost of court and courtiers,
and put up with the extortions and brutality of petty officials and soldiers; on the

other, the material requirements of the governor's civil and military establish
ment boosted local business.
What was the nature ofthe relationship between these governors and the
people among whom they resided? Who were the agents who rendered the will
of a distant Shah into specific fiscal and other directives? In most instances, the
governor and his entourage were "outsiders" to the townspeople and, by
definition, parasitic in relation to the community in which they lived, so that, in
general, individuals in trouble must have found it prudent not to bring them
selves tothe attention ofthe authorities, but torely upon the experience and
judgement of locally-appointed leaders who were drawn from the patriciate of
the city. In 195 4 Professor A.K. S. Lambton published an authoritative review of
urban institutions during the Qajar period which subsequent researchhas
expanded but not substantially altered.50 The difficulty in attempting to clarify
the mechanisms ofprovincial and local government in 19th-century Iran is
primarily due tothe fact that the relevant data derives from specific examples
embedded in surviving documents, personal or family biographies, or foreign
travellers' reports, and as such defy reduction to general principles of adminis
tration. The individual references contradict as often asthey tally with each
other; oneexample relates to a particular city or area, while another is taken from
another part of the country, or a different decade. Moreover, in Qajar Iran there
was none ofthat concern forconsistency of title and function which isthe
instinctive hallmark ofthe modern administrative historian.
Bearing this in mind, itis clear that the usual intermediary between the city
populace and the Shah's representative, the beglerbegi, was the office-holder
known as the kalantar. Under the Safavids, the kalantar wasto be found in everv
major city, with a role and functions not very dissimilar from those of the rals of
Saljuq times. He was appointed to his office by the Shah, but he was usually a
local man of some standing, and in selecting him consideration seems to have
been given to the community's preferences.51 His principal duties consisted of
the regulation ofthe craft-guilds and supervisory responsibility forthe city
wards (mahal), each one of which was in the charge of a kadkhuda. Itseems that
during the interregnum between the fall of the Safavid dynasty and the consoli
dation ofQajar rule, the office ofkalantar acquired increased importance and
independence as a result of the collapse ofthe central government, and there

must have been times when the kalantar wasthe only effective voice for
continuity and order in acity. The Qajars, no great innovators in administration,
retained the office, having no reason to dispense with it, and itis likely that those
kalantars who were quick to accept the new order, contributed substantially
towards the stabilization and legitimation ofthe new regime among the urban
population, while atthe same time helping tomitigate the ferocity and rapacity
of the new ruling elite. Certainly, they provided the link between the old and the
new as far as local political authority was concerned. Indeed, some kalantars
passed effortlessly into the ranks of the higher office-holders ofthe Qajar court.
Hajji Ibrahim Khan, for example, had been kalantar ofShiraz atthe time when
he attracted the notice ofAgha Muhammad Khan; Muhammad Husain Khan
Amin al-Daula had been kalantar ofIsfahan before becoming beglerbegi ofthe
province and, later, mustaufi al-mamalik. T o 19th-century European observers,
the kalantar was the Shah's "eyes and ears" while, atthe same time, helping to
alleviate the naked despotism ofthe regime. Thus, like the qai(ioi a city, he not
infrequently found himself in the invidious position of having to mediate
between tyrannical authorities and desperate subjects. But for those Europeans
who took an interest inlocal government, he was simply the Iranian equivalent
of a mayor or, perhaps more accurately, un maire. Morier, for example, described
him as
the medium through which the wishes and wants of the people are made known tothe King; he is their chief and representative on all occasions, and brings forward the complaints ofthe Rayats, whenever they feel oppressed. He also knows the richesof every Rayat, and his means ofrendering the annual tribute; he therefore regulates the quota that every man must pay.52
The allocation of taxes among the wards of the city, and the detailed
commission of royal orders, devolved upon the kadkhudas, the officially
appointed heads of the various wards into which every city was divided. The
ward, or quarter, wasa distinct entity within the larger unit of the city,
delineated spatially by walls and gateways, which atnight orinperiods ofcrisis
enabled each ward to function as an urbs in urbe.Wards might have their origin in
initial settlement patterns, ethnic ortribal exclusiveness, sectarian solidarity or
occupational definition, but each one perceived itself as a self-sufficing unit in
relation to neighbouring wards or the city asa whole. Since Safavid times the
official head of each ward had been the kadkhuda, who had been almost
invariably selected from among themost prominent residents of that ward.

THE TRADITIONAL IRANIAN CITY IN THE QAJAR PERIOD
According to the Ta^kirat al-Muluk, a Safavid administrative manual of the late
17th century, the kadkhuda wasappointed at the endof the following process.
The leading inhabitants of a ward presented the name of a preferred candidate
for the office of kadkhuda to the kalantar, together with a testimonial and an
agreed figure for his salary, to be paid by the whole ward. If the person named
was acceptable to the kalantar, the latter issued a formal confirmation ofhis
appointment andthen presented thenewly-appointed kadkhuda with a robe of
h o n o u r (khiicat).53
The office of kadkhuda, like that of kalantar, lost none of its importance
during theinterregnum between Safavids and Qajars. InFars, atthe opening of
the 19thcentury, what impressed Edward Scott Waring was the way in which
almost all aspects oflocal government seemed t o fall within the purview of the
kadkhuda. His account is sufficiently detailed to beworth quoting in full, not
least because it implicitly brings out the concept ofa hierarchy ofcontrol: from
kadkhuda to kalantar, from kalantar t o hakim (city governor) and, although
Scott Waring omits this link in thechain, from hakim to beglerbegi.
The city of Sheeraz is divided into Muhuls [wards], over which a Kud Khoda or superintendant presides, butwho receives no salary for executing this duty. This office is generally conferred onthe most respectable man ofthe ward, and over all these Khud Khodas another isappointed [presumably, thekalantar"is meant here], who receives their reports, andcommunicates them to thegovernor. Itwas formerly thecustom for them to report theminutest transaction which might happen in their wards; thebirth of a child,a marriage or death was instantly conveyed to the ears of the Hakim. This practice is dispensed with atSheeraz, but is still, I believe, observed insome cities. It isthe duty of the Kud Khoda to acquaint himself with thetrade andoccupation ofthe different persons who reside in the ward, and of the means they have of subsistence.
But the great advantage which results from this division ofthe city, not only to the government, butalso to theinhabitants, ison thesudden arrival ofa large body of troops, or when the city islaid under contribution. Ineither case, the Kud Khodas attend the governor, whoinforms them what number ofmen their wards must accommodate, or what sum of money it is requisite they should contribute. They are responsible to the governor; anditis their business to make such anarrangement, that each individual shall suffer in proportion tohis capacity tobear this act of violence. Thepeople are generally satisfied with their decisions; for itis needless for them to desist, andoften dangerous to delay.
The licentiousness ofthe troops is thus prevented bytheir finding houses ready to receive them; andan indiscriminate plunder is averted by acompliance with theterms of the conqueror . . .

THE TRADITIONAL IRANIAN CITY IN THE QAJAR PERIOD
As in the case of the kalantar, the kadkhuda functioned as amediator between
government and people, and as a cushion against extreme oppression.
There is often adegree of weight attached to the representations of the Kud Khodas, which serves as astrong restraint on the oppression of a governor. In the event of their suffering greatly from the rapacity or tyranny of the Hakim, they sign a petition, representing the cause ofcomplaint, and praying for redress. It isseldom that the king refuses togrant their request. They are the mediators for the poor people; and despots have the sense toknow, that oppression, carried beyond acertain extent, can be but of short duration.
In addition, Scott Waring represents the kadkhuda as a kind of family
guidance counsellor as well as ombudsman:
In all the little trifling disputes which occur among neighbours, the Kud Khoda exerts his influence to bring them to an amicable termination, and frequently with good success. If a husband and wife disagree, he endeavours to effect areconciliation by remonstrating with the husband, and through the medium of a Kud Banoo (a kind of governess), with the wife. In short, itis his business to be a peace-maker, and to exert himself for the good of the community over which hepresides.54
This account of the kadkhuda's place insociety appears excessively benign
some kadkhudas must have been petty tyrants of their mahah - yet most
contemporary notices confirm Scott Waring's impressions. The kadkhuda was
the principal agent by means ofwhom the government ensured that its wishes
were carried out among the urban population, while he kept it regularly
informed as to the state of public opinion anddrew attention to popular
exasperation with official exactions. Inthis way, hebecame a genuine mediator
between those for whom he was answerable (of which world, he himself was a
part) and the authorities above (hakim, beglerbegl, etc.) who were expected to
behave capriciously and harshly. Thus he was apart of what Emmanuel Le Roy
Ladurie has termed the "intermediary stage of intercession", for in 19th-century
Iran, asin 14th-century Occitan, "an intercessionary stage did exist, providing
always some possibility of reconciliation between the oppression practised by
the dominating forces and theordinary people's need for security".55
The kadkhuda and the kalantar, despite some ambiguity in their functions
and loyalties, served as spokesmen of a kind for the urban population, although
doubtless they used their influence in the first instance to advance the interests of
family, friends and clients. Distinct from them, however, were those govern
ment-appointed officials whose functions were primarily law-enforcement and

who were universally feared for their brutality andvenality. Among these
officials the most important was the darugha-yiba^ar, the superintendant of the
markets, who was in fact the city chief of police. In some form or other, the office
had long been ubiquitous throughout the Muslim world, in Safavid Iran, in
Ottoman Turkey or Mughul India. The Qajars inherited the office from their
predecessors and naturally retained it, although thefunctions attached toit
changed during the course of the 19thcentury. The darugba's duties as
superintendant of markets areprecisely described by Fraser, as he observed
them in the bazaars of Rasht in 1822: "A darogha, or supervisor, sits all day in an
office near the centre ofthe bazar, whose duty it isto regulate all disputes and
matters ofmarket police, towatch over weights and measures, and be answer
able for order, cleanliness, and regularity."56 Scott Waring's description, based
upon observations inShiraz, bears out the general accuracy of Fraser's account,
but alludes to some of the broader and more sinister activities of the post.
The Darogha, or superintendant of the Bazars, holds his office from government; itis his duty to settle the disputes that may occur in the markets, and to hear the complaints of the people ofthe Bazar. Ifa shopkeeper refuses toexecute, orviolates his agreement, you make your complaint tothe Darogha, who obliges him toperform it; or, if he should prove that he is totally unable, hegrants him a certain time forits performance. The humanity of the Moosulman law grants a merchant an opportunity of recovering himself from unforeseen misfortunes. But if the person complained against is ofan infamous character, afineis imposed on him, and the Darogha orders him either to be punished or put in confinement. The Darogha ofthe Bazar likewise superintends the morals ofthe people; and ifhe detects any ofthem drinking wine, orinthe society ofcourtezans, he compels themto purchase his connivance at nosmall expence. [. . .] He has a large establishment under him, who are employed inpreserving the peace of the markets, and in apprehending persons whom they detect acting contraryto the orders of the Darogha. This appointment isconsidered tobe very lucrative; for, inadditon tothe presents and bribes he is in the habit of receiving, the people of the Bazar furnish him with every thing herequires, that they may ensure his protection and favour.57
Some of the functions of the darugha-yi bazar were among those often
undertaken elsewhere by the muhtasib (as in the case of late Mughul India), but in
Qajar Iran the division of responsibility between the muhtasib and the darugha
yi bazar seems to have been ill-defined. Regarding thebackground to these
overlapping jurisdictions, Professor Lambton writes: "The affairs of the citi
zens were also closely affected by the muhtasib, who since early times had been

in charge, among other things, of weights and measures, the fixing of prices and
the affairs of the bazaar in general. His functions were largely concerned with the
enforcement of the provisions of the sharfa. There was, however, some clash of
jurisdiction between the muhtasib and the 'civil' officials. In Saljiiq times this
clash was mainly with the sahibal-shurta, and in the later period with the kalantar
and the darugha. From early Islamic times down to the 17th century the
muhtasib's powers were broadly speaking unchanged... Towards the end of the
Safavid period, however, it seems that those functions ofthe muhtasib which
had concerned the prevention of offences against the shar^a were taken over by
the darugha."58 This development may have reflected a general withdrawal of the
ShIcI culama from involvement in state-associated matters, butsuch was cert
ainly the prevailing situation atthe beginning ofthe Qajar period, and it seems
that theoffice of muhtasib, as it had existed for centuries, withered away in
the early and middle decades of the 19th century. Robert Binning asserted that it
had been abolished in the mid 18 5 os.59 Itwas tobe subsequently revived during
the reign of Nasir al-DIn Shah, butas a non-religious office.60
The darugha-yi bazar had, in addition, another, apparently separate police
establishment charged with the overall protection of the city, and especially with
guarding the bazaars at night. The subordinate officers in charge ofthis force
were known variously as mir casas, mlr ahdath, and keshlkchlbashl. Regarding the
rnir casas in Shiraz, Scott Waring writes:
It is his office to preserve the peace of the city, to take up persons who may be out of their houses atimproper hours, and toprevent robberies. He has a number of people under him forthis purpose, who patrole [sic] the streets, and keep watch onthe top of the houses. Each shopkeeper in the Bazar contributes about two or three pence amonth to defray the expences of this establishment. Ifa house-keeper is robbed, the Meer Usus, or Kucheek-chee-bashee (the head ofthe watch), are accountable for the robbery, and are obliged either to produce the property stolen, or pay the amount. This rarely happens, for the Meer Usus isgenerally connected with all the thieves in the city, and can answer for their obedience to his orders. They rob, therefore, in places not under his protection; and, as itis commonly supposed he participates in their plunder, they are connected with each other bya common interest.61
Whether this "connection" is to be regarded as a case of setting a thief to
catch a thief, or asevidence of blurred distinctions between law-breakers and
law-enforcers at the lower levels of society, it appears that public opinion
generally made little distinction between those who were designated criminals

and the representatives of the law, who were commonly regarded with fear and
loathing. Moreover, both were to be found, side-by-side, in those gatherings of
hooligans which formed so quickly toprotest a government edict, assist in a
clash of rival dervishes, insult aforeign embassy, plunder Armenian or Jewish
shops, or in the second half of the 19th century, lynch aBabl or a Baha'L62
Frequently, such hooligans are termed littls. Binning, for example, in mid
i9th-century Shlraz, believed that the so-called lutis were recruited from all
segments of society and involved themselves in arange of activities in which the
fraternal, the vigilante and the criminal were scarcely distinguishable. He wrote:
"These villains have akind of freemasonry among themselves, and their society
includes not only those who live by their wits, such as thieves, robbers, pimps,
gamblers, etc.,but also aconsiderable number of the shopkeepers, artisans, and
even some of the higher classes."63 Charitably, their behaviour might be
explained away as ameans of burning up excess youthful energy, but clearly the
role ofthe lutis inurban society under the Qajars presents the historian with
some real epistomological problems. These are implicitly stated in Professor
Lambton's able summary of the place of the luti in the 19th century Iranian city:
There is evidence of the existence in the nineteenth century of associations which are not dissimilar tothe earlier associations ofcajyar, namely the associations ofluth or dashha. These were local associations, whose objects were the preservation ofpublic morality in the district to which they belonged, the protection of the district from robbers, to which end they would patrol the district at night, and the education of the orphans and the poor children of the district. They caused levies to be made on the rich people of the district and distributed the proceeds to the poor. They had a gild organization. Only persons ofgood character were admitted . .. The ^urkhanas, institutions where acertain type of wrestling and gymnastic exercise were practised, were in many cases run by these local associations ...These associations, like the craft gilds and thefutuwwa orders, had an cAlid tinge. As in the case of the gilds ofcayjar these associations of luth also frequently degenerated into bands of hooligans, and as such would levy toll upon the people ofthe quarter inwhich they were . . . Inmore modern times the luti and dashhas become something of a term of abuse, but even among the lutiha and dashha of the modern Persian city the old conception ofchivalry isnot wholly absent, and a certain esprit de corps prevails among them.64
Until adefinitive investigation into the structure of Qajar urban society has
been undertaken, analysis of the social composition and diverse roles of the lutis
must remain largely tentative, but the beginnings of a scholarly debate have been

articulated. William M. Floor, inparticular, has sought todifferentiate among
several categories of persons hitherto designated lutis.65 He suggests differenti
ation into three groups: first, entertainers (i.e., singers, dancers, storytellers,
actors, acrobats and wrestlers); secondly, members ofcayyar-\ike fraternities,
whom hecalls lutigars and whom Reza Arasteh styles javanmards, and whom
both associate, inparticular, with the f^urkhanas;and finally, gangs of ruffians
(aubash) who flourished whenever the authorities seemed weak or indecisive,
largely because they enjoyed the protection of influential patrons. The latter
might be local landlords, ambitious merchant families (like the Qavam family in
Shlraz), or members ofthe culama. Affiliation to any one ofthe three groups
identified by Floor would not necessarily exclude the possibility of linkages with
the other two. What seems certain is that whether they are called lutis, lutigars or
aubash, and whether they are regarded as lower-class vigilantes or gangs of law
breakers, these associations were an ever-present factor in practically all the
larger cities during the Qajar period, and that they were sometimes able, with a
little prodding from their patrons, to take over wards and even an entire cityin
times of acute crisis.
Luti violence, especially when it was directed against religious minoritiesor
foreigners, was often culama-inspired. The social role of the culama in Qajar
society has yet tobe researched definitively, but it can be safely postulated that
no town ofany consequence was without its clerical families, and that whilein
some, a clerical preponderance wasmore in evidence than in others, the
influence ofthe culama upon Iran's urban communities was extremely perva
sive. To speak of clerical families is no misnomer. Since celibacy wasnot
required of the culama, clerics were normally married men with families, and the
occupation tended, like any other, to be passed from father to sons and from
uncle to nephews. Collectively, the19th-century culama encompassed a very
broad spectrum ofprofessional and economic interests. Some were mua^^jm
attached to particular mosques; others were scholars and teachers; others, again,
exercised judicial authority, were qazis or muhtasibs, and played a conspicuous
part inpublic affairs. Some culama were comfortably placed. Afew were very
wealthy. Others, incharge of a small mosque orshrine inadecaying hamlet,or
dependent upon revenue from a mismanaged vaqf, or a vaqf of diminishing
income, were little better than their neighbours who earned their bread by the
sweat of their brows. Butindividually, as well as collectively, theculama
exercised enormous authority, although often exerted quite informally. They

mediated disputes and defused conflicts, they enforced moral and social confor
mity by exemplification and exhortation, and they sometimes even defied the
officials appointed bythe Shah, to the point of bringing the mob onto the
streets. The Qajar regime placated and sustained the culama, but instinctively
feared them. Public opinion viewed them not very differently from the way in
which lay Christians in late medieval Europe viewed the Christian clergy.
Genuine piety and learning, eloquence in preaching and acharismatic person
ality won wide recognition and sincere reverence, but the greedy, lustful or
hypocritical akhund or mulla was the butt ofteahouse gossip and ribaldry.
In terms of the social structure, those culama who were accorded high status
in the community usually enjoyed close familial links with other local leaders
such as merchants of substance or landowners who possessed urban property or
whose agricultural produce found a market in a particular town or city. Without
intending to draw too close aparallel, it can be said of the urban patriciate of
Qajar Iran what Richard W. Bulliet has said ofthe urban patriciate of pre
Mongol Nishapur, that it was composed, typically, of "a group of families, often
intermarried, with landowning, merchant, orreligious backgrounds, and not
infrequently all three, who monopolized political and religious power in the city
. . . all share alocal base and alocal allegiance". In the time of Fath CA1I Shah, as
much asin that ofAlp Arslan orMalik Shah, "The reality ofthe patriciate
consisted in individuals and families who knew each other as being above the
ordinary run of people. There wTas no formal membership in the patriciate . ..
There is nothing extraordinary in all of this; upper classes frequently lack formal
definition."66
Together with the ulama, the merchant class was the most prosperous and
stable element in early Qajar Iran, being largely immune from the conspicuous
consumption and extravagance which, typically, characterized the military and
official classes. Itwas also less vulnerable to the hazards of public life.67 Foreign
visitors thought that Iranian merchants lived well, that their houses were
comfortable and sometimes opulent, and that the wives of the richest were
reputedly as well dressed as the women of the royal household.68 For all that,
however, their style oflife remained unostentatious, soasnot toattract the
attention of envious or greedy neighbours.69 Despite occasional acts of individ
ual extortion, the authorities generally protected and even cherished geese

which could lay such truly golden eggs. The merchant who possessed consider
able capital and real local influence, who traded between cities and sometimes
even engaged in risky, if rewarding, commercial ventures beyond the frontiers,
and who practised a calling deeply respected in traditional Islamic society, was a
most valuable subject of Shahs, princes and governors.70 When called upon, he
could provide loans (whether voluntary or otherwise) to cover unanticipated or
non-recurring expenses such asunseasonal campaigning, the cost of foreign
missions, or special celebrations. In Shiraz, in 1787, Francklin observed the
entire trading community pressed into contributing alarge plshkash to meet the
costs of the extravagant festivities which accompanied the circumcision of a son
of Jacfar Khan Zand.71 Such "benevolences" were customary and acquiesced in.
No less useful was the merchant in procuring the foreign-manufactured luxuries
which were in such demand among the ruling elite. In return, he was sometimes
able to put unostentatious pressure upon local officials, and even make himself
heard at court. In1808—9, f°r example, merchants with interests in the Persian
Gulf and India trade were believed tobe exercising considerable influence in
both Shiraz and Tehran in regard to the dispute between the rival envoys of the
East India Company and the British government.72 Moreover, compared to the
rest of the population, the merchant, at least during the reign of Fath CA1I Shah,
enjoyed the privilege of being virtually tax-exempt, his sole contribution to the
exchequer being customs dues, estimated at being one-tenth ofthe value on
imported goods.73
Beneath the merchants of ample means, the lower strata of urban society were
composed of successive layers of petty traders and itinerant pedlars, craftsmen
and artisans, caravan-guides and guards, entertainers and mountebanks, down
to those whose muscle-power was almost their sole marketable asset, suchas
packers and porters, handlers of transport-animals, manual workers, servants
and beggars. The certainty and regularity of work for such people was far from
assured. Much labour wras seasonal, and underemployment may have beenas
serious a source of urban poverty as unemployment. For those who bought and
sold with little in the way of working capital, and for those with craft-skills who
lived a little above the subsistence-level, a precarious dependence upon the laws
of supply and demand, and upon the operation of distant markets was afact of
life. Superficially, the middling and lower ranks of urban Iran seemed to serve as
the ballast of a conservative and apparently stable society, but in fact, almost all
below the ranks of the patriciate were liable to unpredictable changes of fortune

as a result of drought, famine and epidemics, ephemeral or protracted political
crises, fluctuating prices and changing market-conditions. Life's certainties
were more apparent than real, with the result that the urban population
constituted avolatile, potentially explosive element insociety, capable of violent
eruption when pressed too hard.
As to spatial organization, the core ofevery town and city was the bazaar, its
commercial and social significance reflected in the scale, complexity and central
location of the bazaars of such cities as Isfahan, Kashan, Shiraz and Tehran.
Often, these were, as in the case of Karim Khan Zand's bazaar in Shiraz or
Muhammad cAli Mirza's in Kirmanshah, monuments not only to the public
spiritedness of rulers, butalso to their self-interest. The latter consideration did
not escape Francklin's attention ashesurveyed the Shiraz bazaar in the late 18th
century:
Shirauz has many good bazars and caravanserais: that distinguished by the appelation
of the Vakeel's bazar (so called from its being built by Kerim Khan), is by far the
handsomest; it is along street, extending about aquarter of a mile, built entirely ofbrick,
and roofed something in thestyle of the Piazzas in Covent Garden; it is lofty and well
made; oneach side are the shops of the tradesmen, merchants, and others, inwhichare
exposed forsale avariety ofgoods ofall kinds: these shops are the property ofthe Khan,
and arerented to themerchants at a very easy monthly rate.74
Franklin's enthusiasm for the bazaars of Shiraz was shared by Scott Waring:
The Vakeel's Bazar is a most noble work; it isbuilt of brick, arched, and covered in
like Exeter Change. It probably extends half a mile, and is,I should suppose, fifty feet
wide . . . It has agrand appearance atnight, when it islighted up; and as every trade has a
separate quarter, you know where toresort toforwhat you may require . . . Many ofthe
other markets arevery handsome, but none so magnificent as theVakeel's.75
Not allbazaars were asgrand or ascommodious asthose of Shiraz, buttheir
functions and general arrangements were the same. Those ofRasht, for example,
although quite different in appearance from the brick-built complexes on the
plateau, fulfilled an identical role. Fraser writes:
The bazars are the objects certainly best worthy of attention in Resht; they are
extensive, regular, clean, and well kept. They consist ofa series ofthree orfour narrow
streets, running parallel to each other, crossed at right angles byothers, and including
several caravanseries; sothat the whole forms a very extensive assemblage ofshops and
warehouses. These bazars are well paved, but not entirely covered in from the weather,as
in most other places. Instead of arched or domed roofs extending from one side of the
street tothe other, there are long pent-house roofs, projecting from either side nearly to

Adjacent to the bazaars were caravanserais, and in addition to providing
shelter for travellers and their beasts, and security for goods intransit, these
acted as enclosed markets where bulky or valuable commodities were handled
and stored, and where leading merchants hired rooms in which to transact
business. As a consequence, caravanserais located in or close to the bazaars
acquired the character of a common meeting-place for merchants and akind of
informal exchange.77 Some caravanserais were frequented by merchants with a
particular line of goods. Thus, cloth-merchants, needing security for bulky bales
of textiles, might assemble at a particular caravanserai where, at night, their
stock would be protected by high walls and locked gates. Inthe larger cities,
certain caravanserais were theresort of foreign merchants (in Shlraz, for
example, the Indian traders had their own caranvanserai) or of Armenians. Like
the bazaars, some caravanserais in the cities were built and then let out to tenants
by royal or gubernatorial entrepreneurs. Also like the bazaars, their utility
ensured that they were kept ina tolerably good state ofrepair. Francklin was
clearly impressed by these institutions when hewrote:
Leading out of this bazar [Karlm Khan Zand's] is a spacious caravanserai, of an octagon form, built of brick; the entrance through a handsome arched gate-way: in the centre is a place for the baggage and merchandise, and on the sides above and below commodious apartments for the merchants and travellers; these are also rented at a moderate monthly sum. About the centre of the above-mentioned bazar is another spacious caravanserai, of a square form, the front of which is ornamented with ablue and white enamelled work, in order to represent China ware, and has apleasing effect to the eye. This buildingis larger than the former, and is chiefly resorted to by Armenian and other Christian merchants. . . .78
In contrast, the caravanserais which had been built at various times along the
main trade-routes, linking each town or city with its immediate neighbour, were
often ina dilapidated condition, and sometimes little more than ruins. A few,
located close to the capital or onthe more frequented roads, were properly
maintained but there was no certainty as to the kind of accommodation a
traveller would find at the end ofa day. Forster, travelling by caravan from
Herat to Sari in mid-winter in the late 18th century experienced widely different

conditions from one night's stop to the next, but his overall experience was
typical.
In Herat, Forster lodged in relative comfort in a caravanserai reserved for
travellers (i.e., it had not become the business rendezvous of local merchants),
but after leaving Herat the caravan did not find any shelter for several nights,
and at some stopping-places there was barely sufficient water at the solitary well
to meet the travellers' needs. At Khwaf, Forster encountered a frequent diffi
culty for travellers in Qajar Iran. The place was,he noted, "a populous, andin
this country a large village, which maintains a moderate traffick with Herat,
Muschid, and Turshish", but provisions were virtually unobtainable. "Markets
and public shops being only seen in the cities and principal towns of Persia and
Afghanistan, travellers are obliged to apply for provisions to the housekeepers,
who are often unable to provide the required quantity. Though Khauff is a
village of note, bread in no part of it is publickly vended."79
Leaving Khwaf, the party spent the next night on the ground floor of a
windmill. Two nights later, a heavy fall of snow forced them to halt in a small
fortified village where there was no public accommodation. "Our party went
into the fort to seek shelter, and after earnest intreaties, were conducted into a
small dark room", but there was no food. "The inhabitants aware of our
distress, furnished an abundant supply of fuel, which became as necessary toour
existence as food; but when the cold was a little qualified, we experienced an
urgent want of provisions; not an article of which was to be procured at
Ashkara."80 At Turshiz the local caravanserai was full, but after offering a
douceur to the gatekeeper, Forster obtained a half-share of a room and thereafter
"extolled the comforts of a commodious apartment, and savoury messes, made
in rotation of beef, mutton, and camels flesh".81 The first stop after Turshiz was
"at a small karavansera, where being plentifully supplied with fuel by oneofthe
villagers . .. we passed a cold snowy night very comfortably."82 Thenext night,
the chieftain of a small village through which they passed, knowing theleader of
the caravan, invited them into the fort for the night.
In this uncertain way,the journey continued until Shahrud, although even
there no provisions were to be had andthefuel wasdamp, and a further night on
the road was spent in a ruined hammam. Only in Mazandaran did the travellers
encounter some degree of comfort. Forster travelled on roads which were not
the most frequented, but his adventures crossing Afghanistan and Iran in

disguise, would have been quite familiar to those Iranians - traders, pilgrims,
dervishes, etc.— who were frequently on the move. The authorities showed little
concern for the safety or comfort of travellers, and there is scant evidence of
government initiative in building or repairing caravanserais. The better-pre
served dated from Safavid times, and those built since were generally the gift of
local benefactors.
By the standards of contemporary Europe, the roads of19th century Iran
were far from satisfactory, but they adequately met the needs of a society where
mules and camels were the normal forms of transport. Wheeled vehicles were
hardly used, but in any case, the mountainous country through which so many
roadways passed ruled out the use of carts or wagons. In fact, the so-called roads
were nothing more than hoof-marked tracks used by caravans since time
immemorial. Many were impassable inwinter. Under the early Qajars the
government took little or no interest in improving communications, assuming
perhaps that anon-existent road-system constituted adefence against foreign
invasion.83 When, during the reign of Fath cAli Shah, repairs and improvements
were made to the dangerous track up the Kutal-i Dukhtar, between Kazarun and
Shlraz, they were paid for by a local merchant on his own initiative, not by the
provincial government of Fars.84
Most transport was by mule. Mule-trains varied in size from small strings,
such as the thirty-nine beasts which accompanied Harford Jones and a friendly
merchant, Hajjl Ibrahim Isfahan!, from Shiraz to Bushire in 1791, to the
hundreds which escorted persons of consequence. Good mules were valuable
property. Especially famous for the excellence of its mules was the village of
Zarqan, north of Shlraz, where there were two thousand available for hire.85
Merchants and other travellers usually hired mules and muleteers to carry on
their business or move about the country, rarely owning their own transport
animals. Hence, the muleteer was one of the mainstays of the commercial life of
the country, and although foreigners complained of his cunning and idleness, he
was regarded as something of a superior person, more independent and self
reliant than most, and hewas frequently entrusted with the transport of
considerable sums in coin orprecious metals from one city to another.86
Sometimes, he acquired a modest sufficiency. Harford Jones met muleteers
richer than the merchants who engaged them, and he mentions one who owned
250 mules and 20 pack-horses.87

THE TRADITIONAL IRANIAN CITY IN THE QAJAR PERIOD
Officials were stationed at intervals on the principal roads to levy tolls
(rahdarT) and to protect travellers.88 In the time of Agha Muhammad Khan these
tasks seem to have been effectively carried out, but during the reign of Fath cAli
Shah the rahdars frequently extorted money from road-users by force or fraud,
and were sometimes in league with local bandits.89 The latter were by no means
uncommon, although the frequency and range of their activities depended upon
the vigilance and vigour of the forces atthe disposal of the local government.
They were, however, aninevitable hazard in an underpoliced countryside.
Occasionally, caravans would suffer the depredations oftribal raiders, moti
vated by want or by a desire tochallenge the authority of the central govern
ment. In Isfahan in 1811, for example, it was rumoured that the city itself was
about to become the objective of a Bakhtiyari foray, which in fact never
materialized.90 In Khurasan, however, there was the much more serious danger
of Turkmen slave-raiders. Consequently, travellers to thenortheast were
warned togo heavily armed.
Throughout the 18th and much of the 19th century, the inhabitants of
Khurasan and Gurgan were exposed to relentless persecution by slavers from
beyond the border, against whom little orno protection was tobe had. The
perpetrators of these atrocious activities were members of the Turkmen tribes
living along Iran's extended, undelineated and largely defenceless northeast
frontier. The tribes most frequently involved were the Goklen, the Tekke and
the Yamut. The raiders themselves retained very few of the Iranian slaves whom
they captured, the ultimate destination of their human chattel being the flourish
ing slave-markets ofKhiva, Bukhara and other towns inthe Uzbek country
north of the Qara-Qum. The justification offered by the Sunnl ulama of
Bukhara for this enslavement of fellow-Muslims was the Shici heterodoxy of the
Iranians.
The number of Iranian victims of Turkmen slave-raiding, although
unrecorded, must have been very great, and included persons ofall ages and
occupations, and of both sexes. In fact, so extensive was this involuntary transfer
of people across the Qara-Qum and the Amu-Darya that the descendantsof
Iranian slaves and of unions between Uzbek males and Iranian females consti
tuted a distinct minority among the diverse ethnic elements of the population of
the Central Asian khanates. Male slaves were engaged inagriculture and to a

lesser extent in craft occupations and domestic service. Most women slaves
became household servants. The more attractive were purchased for purposes of
sexual gratification, and naturally commanded higher than average prices.
The most obvious targets for attack by Turkmen raiding-parties were
isolated villages and unprotected caravans. When the raiding-parties were
sufficiently large (some numbered several hundred) small towns, and even the
environs ofMashhad and Astarabad, were not immune toattack. Caravans,
however, were especially tempting prey, since they provided opportunities for
plundering as well as slaving, while merchants and other travellers ofmeans
could be ransomed for large sums. No traveller was safe from attack, unless he
was able to provide himself with awell-armed escort. On one occasion, even a
brother ofthe King ofAwadh was seized.
Europeans who travelled innortheastern Iran described the population as
living ina state of perpetual fear and uncertainty, convinced that the govern
ment authorities would notor could not provide protection or even the
assurance of punitive retaliation. Left to their own defence, the local people took
whatever precautions they could. Most villages were fortified, and in the more
exposed districts of Gurgan and Khurasan, the cultivators worked the land with
their weapons within arms' reach, or with a line of sentries standing on guard at
the edge of the fields. Manned watchtowers and regular patrolling of strategic
mountain passes could reduce the dangers of sudden attack, but so widespread
was the terror inspired by the Tiirkmens that even close to the walls of Mashhad
good agricultural land was left uncultivated. In Khurasan as a whole, and in the
frontier districts in particular, the population was said to be on the decline,
except in the territories controlled by the khans of Bujnurd, Quchan, Darra Gaz
and Kalat, who gave the Tiirkmens as good as they got. In fact, assured
protection required effective lordship, so that everywhere villagers were depen
dent for their security upon local landowners or military leaders who had seized
control inthe absence ofany effective provincial government. Such, at least,
could offer the protection of one of the many petty forts dotted over the
Khurasan countryside as a refuge for men and animals.
The urban communities of the province were no less aware of the Turkmen
threat, which undoubtedly contributed towards a decline in commercial ac
tivity. Walls and gateways had to bekept in constant repair, and departing
caravans needed to know the likelihood of attack in open country before they
reached the safety ofthe next town. It seems incredible that the Qajars were
unable to put an end to asituation which led to areduction of the population,
agricultural production and state revenues of a large part of the kingdom, as well

as patently demonstrating theregime's inability to defend its own subjects.
Nevertheless, there were a number of interlocking factors which explainthe
continuation ofthis state ofaffairs down tothe end ofthe century. First, there
was theapparently inexhaustible demand for slaves in theUzbek khanates.
Secondly, there was theprevailing poverty of the Tiirkmens, balanced by
opportunities forreaping great profits from slave-raiding in circumstances in
which the risks of retribution were almost negligible, given the feebleness of the
provincial administration inintercepting or punishing raiders. Then, there was
the failure of the Iranian government to police thefrontier or maintain a
permanent military presence inthe districts most exposed toTurkmen attacks.
Finally, there was the inescapable fact that, on the Iranian side ofthe frontier,
and as adirect result of the pusillanimous attitude of government, local officials,
traders and others, either out of fear or tempted with a share of the profits,
assisted the Tiirkmens with information onthe state ofthe country and with
warnings of contemplated counter-attacks. Only Russia's annexation of the
khanates in the second half of the 19th century, leading to the eventual conquest
of the Tiirkmens andto theRussian delineation of the frontier with Iran,
brought this evil traffic to an end.
Eighteenth andnineteenth-century Iran offers the curious paradox that
while theIranian inhabitants of Khurasan and Gurgan were thevictims of
incessant slave-raiding bythe Tiirkmens, and while large numbers of Iranian
subjects lived out their lives as slaves of the Uzbeks, Iran itself remained aslave
owning and slave-importing society. Slaves reached Iran from several direc
tions: from across the Aras river, from across the frontier with the vilayat of
Baghdad, and by way of the Persian Gulf. Christian Armenians and Georgians
from the Caucasus region were brought back in border forays. After the sack of
Tiflis in 1795, Agha Muhammad Khan is said to have carried off 15,000
Georgians into slavery, mainly women andchildren. Thewomen became
household slaves, while the more attractive were placed in the harems of the
nobility. Young males were frequently castrated. The court or household
eunuch of19th-century Iran, often his master's trusted confidant, was, typically,
a Georgian. However, the flow of Christian slaves from Caucasia decreased toa
trickle after the Treaty of Turkmanchai of 1828, although the abducting of
women across the frontier continued throughout the century.
Apart from Caucasian Christians, most slaves in Iran were of African origin.
They were employed mainly as agricultural workers in the south, and especially
in the date-plantations of the garmsir, but they were to be encountered in all the
larger cities, where they lived as household dependents. African slaves were

brought to Iran by two routes: by ship from East Africa or from the shores of the
Red Sea, often in vessels of Muscat or Zanzibar; or overland via Baghdad,
having been purchased by merchants or pilgrims inthe Hijaz orinthe vilayat
itself. Foreigners inIran identified three main groups: Swahili-speakers from
East Africa, Ethiopians (or Habashis, as they had long been called in the Middle
East), and Nubians, a term used to describe allslaves originating from the
Sudan. The last were shipped mainly from Egyptian orRed Sea ports suchas
Sawakin and Massawa.
Nineteenth-century European observers showed more than apassing inter
est in black slaves in Iran. The abolition of the slave-trade everywhere had long
exercised British public opinion, and the Royal Navy was regarded as the
foremost agency for bringing the traffic to an end. In the United States, as well,
slavery was becoming aburning issue. Thus, in writing of Iran in 1849—5 o, Lady
Sheil commented in detail upon the nature of Iranian slavery. She thought that,
on balance, the Iranians were fairly tolerant and easy-going masters, while of the
slaves themselves, she wrote:
They are highly esteemed as being mild, faithful, brave and intelligent, and are generally confidential servants in Persian households. Ill-treatment must of course sometimes take place when there is unlimited power on one hand, and entire submission on the other. The fact is proved by the occasional instances in which slaves have taken refuge in the Mission to escape from punishment by their masters. Still itis believed that in general, cruelty, or even harshness, is rarely practised towards slaves in Persia. Their customary treatment is similar to that of the other servants of a family, or even something better, particularly when they happen to be Nubees or Habeshees. They are never employed as field labourers, their occupations being confined tothe duties ofthe household. It is probable that in the anderoons more suffering is inflicted on the women slaves thanis endured by the men.
All things considered, she felt that the lot of slaves in Iran was probably to be
preferred tothat ofslaves elsewhere:
They are not treated with contempt as in America; there are no special laws to hold them in a state of degradation; they are frequently restored to freedom, and when this happens, they take their station in society without any reference to their colour or descent. White slaves frequently rise to the highest employments, but these are commonly captives taken in war. Itis said not to be easy to make an estimate of the number of slaves imported annually into Persia from the Red Sea and Zanjibar (sic). They certainly are not numerous, judging by the few to be seen in the streets of the large towns in the north of Persia. In those of the south they are doubtless in greater numbers, and particularly in the low, level tract bordering the coast, of which Bushire and Benderabbas are near the extremities. The difficulty of forming a correct calculation on the subject, arises from the practice of each petty chief in the Persian Gulf being an importer in his own vessels, and from the slaves

being landed at avariety of small harbours extending over agreat length of coast. The number is supposed not to exceed two or three thousand annually, of whom a great many die after leaving the hot region of the Persian coast.91
There can be no doubt of the existence of considerable numbers of African
slaves ortheir descendants insouthern Iran: inKhuzistan and Fars, in Ahvaz,
Bihbahan, Bushire, Kazariin and Shiraz; and in the southeast, in Lar, Bam,
Bandar cAbbas, Jiruft, Kirman and Minab. K.E. Abbott, writing in 1851,
thought that the inhabitants of the Kuh-i Jabal Bariz between Bam and Jiruft
were the descendants of unions between indigenous tribals and imported blacks,
and he supposed the same to be true of many of the cultivators in Sistan.92 Local
nomenclature in the southeast also pointed to settlements offormer African
slaves: inBaluchistan, there was a village ofZanjiabad, and a Qalca-i Zanjian,
both close to aMount of the Blacks.93 On the Gulf littoral and in the immediate
hinterland, the role ofAfrican slaves inharvesting dates and other crops may
have been more extensive than has hitherto been realized.
However many blacks were imported into Iran during the first half ofthe
19th century, the trade thereafter gradually withered away, just as the tradein
Caucasian Christians had done a quarter ofa century earlier. British concern
with slave-trading inthe Persian Gulf touched Iran no less than the Ottoman
authorities in Iraq and the Arab shaikhs of the west coast. In August 1846,
Muhammad Shah was formally requested to prohibit the slave trade in the Gulf
ports, but he refused, asserting that slavery was permitted inIslam, and that
enslavement hastened conversion. Eventually, under pressure, he relented and
in 1848 issued zfarman forbidding the importation of slaves into Iran by sea. At
the same time, he sent instructions to the beglerbegl of Fars, acknowledging the
Royal Navy's right to search and seizure. This was confirmed subsequently ina
farman of 185 2, although the smuggling of small numbers of slaves into the less
frequented harbours continued for some time.94 Likewise, as early as 1846 the
Vali of Baghdad issued an order prohibiting the slave trade in the Ottoman ports
of the Gulf, although some years were to elapse before the illicit transit of slaves
from the vilayat toIran, through Kirmanshah, could be brought toan end.95
Most Iranians during the 19th century enjoyed a very precarious tenure of life
and property. Virtually all were vulnerable to exploitation or oppression by
someone above them. Access tojustice was apt tobe costly, and the outcome
uncertain. Yet within these encompassing generalizations, some were more

vulnerable than others. At a guess, half the population of Iran was female.In
19th-century writing on Iran, whether native or foreign, women receive virtu
ally nomention. Even the most naive European diplomat, army officer or
globetrotter knew better than to question a Muslim male regarding his women
folk, let alone attempt direct communication with them, while European female
travellers were very rare, consisting of the occasional diplomat's wife and,
towards theendof the century, the lady-missionary.96 In consequence, the kinds
of questions which historians now ask about the lives of women in times past
(the ageof puberty andmarriage, the span of the child-bearing years, thesizeand
mortality rates of families, the role of mothers and others in child-rearing,
women in the work-force, and thepractical implications of their social and legal
status) cannot be answered for Qajar Iran.97 What can safely be affirmed is that
every woman, without exception, wassubordinate to theauthority of and under
the restraint of a particular man(i.e., father, brother, husband, son), and that her
material well-being and personal happiness were entirely dependent upon the
benevolence, sense ofjustice, worldly success and good fortune of whatever
male happened tobe exercising that authority over her at any given time.
Having no first-hand contact with Iranian women, European commentators
were reduced to supposition, gossip, and stereotypical commentary. Thus, they
liked to reiterate that, despite the apparent subordination ofwomen to men
enjoined by Islam, there were numerous traditions toshow that the Prophet
required that women be treated with justice and generosity. Some travellers,
familiar with other Muslim countries, thought that insocial matters Iranians
were more easy-going than their neighbours, and that this contributed to the
alleviation of an otherwise hard lot. Evidence for this, itwas asserted, was the
relative freedom with which, inthe cities, women left their houses and went
visiting, although always modestly concealed in a chadur. A few thought that the

Forbes-Leith, Checkmate,pp. 180-93. 97 Lacking statistics of any kind, the historian is compelled to make the most of random contemporary comments, such as the view of Nasir al-DTn Shah's French physician, Ernest Cloquet (1818-5 5), that not more than three Iranian children inten lived beyond their third year. Sheil, op. cit., p. 149. IfCloquet kept adiary ofhis years inIran it would make fascinating reading. The son of one distinguished French physician, Hippolyte Cloquet, and the nephew of a second, Jules-Germain Cloquet, Ernest was invited in 1846, having just completed his training, tobecome the physician of Muhammad Shah. With his professional skill, he soon won the Shah's confidence, and was awarded the Order of the Lion and Sun. In Tehran, he studied cholera and other infectious diseases and communicated his findings tothe Academie de medecine inParis, for which he received the Legion d'honneur. After Muhammad Shah's death, he continued as physician toNasir al-DTn Shah until his death in 1855. He must have possessed a rare familiarity with the medical and sanitary practicesof Qajar Iran.

chadur, because itconcealed awoman's identity, contributed to her freedom of
movement. Others, again, held that the lot of women in the villages or amongst
the tribes was less circumscribed and less debilitating than that of their sisters in
the towns.
Europeans fancied that they knew most about the lifestyle of upper-class
women, and especially ofthe women ofthe palace, whom diplomats' wives
occasionally met under rather formal and constrained circumstances. In particu
lar, the notion of the harem fascinated Europeans, for whom itwas asource of
constant speculation and fantasy. In the early 19th century, polygamy was
widely practised by the ruling elite, as was the keeping of concubines, among
whom light-skinned Caucasian women were in greatest demand. Border-raid
ing and slave-trading ensured aregular supply of the latter, at least until Russia
annexed the frontier khanates of the northwest. In Tabriz, for instance, in 1810 a
good-looking Georgian girl could sell for eighty pounds on the open market.98
The existence ofan extensive traffic in female slaves, aswell asthe helpless
position of any woman bereft of the protection of family or kinsfolk, goes far to
explaining the ubiquitous presence ofdancing-girls, courtesans and common
prostitutes. Officially, such occupations were frowned upon, and in some
places, outlawed, although venal agents of the law would turn ablind eye for a
price. Forster was echoing the public posture of the authorities when he wrote
that "neither Afghanistan nor the northern provinces of Persia, permit the
residence of courtezans, or any women that dance and sing forthe public
entertainment",99 but Scott Waring probably came closer to reality. "The most
beautiful women in Persia are devoted to theprofession of dancing;the
transparency of their shift, which is the only covering they use to conceal their
persons, the exquisite symmetry of their forms, their apparent agitation, and the
licentiousness of their verses, are so many incentives to a passion, which requires
more philosophy than the Persians possess to restrain."100 Furthermore, he was
adamant that dancing-girls and prostitutes were officially recognized bythe
authorities, and taxed accordingly: "the description of people who pay the
heaviest tax to government, are the female dancer, and the votaries of pleasure.
They exercise their professions under the immediate patronage of the governor;
their names, ages, &c. are carefully registered, and ifone should die or marry,
another instantly supplies her place. They are divided into classes, agreeably to
their merits, and the estimation they are held in; each class inhabits separate
streets, so that you may descend from the doo Toomunees [two tumans] to thePooli

Seeahs ["black money" - copper coins], without thechance of making mis
takes."101 In fact, consorting with public women, like consuming alcohol, while
forbidden by the Sharfa, was far from unknown. Layard in Isfahan in 1840— 1, to
quote a single example, participated inwhat he described as an "orgy" ata Lur
chieftain's house, during which his host and the guests drank huge quantities of
araq in the company of obviously lubricious dancing-girls.102
The complacent comments of European writers regarding the status of
Iranian women, ranging from aconviction that relations between the sexes were
conducted strictly inaccordance with Quranic injunctions, tohumorous asser
tions that the Iranian housewife inher andarun ruled her menfolk with a rod of
iron, totally ignored the fact that women were peculiarly exposed to ill
treatment and violence ina society where the normative manner of exercising
authority was capricious andbrutal. Women were frequently the principal
victims when misfortune struck afamily or acommunity. Much has been made
of a traditional Islamic code of chivalry in the treatment of women and children,
but such was certainly not the case in Qajar Iran. If a minister or high official was
disgraced or executed, his family suffered too. Sometimes, his wives and
daughters were handed over to his enemies, or to the grooms of the royal stables.
If such was the treatment meted out to the families of nobles, it needs little
imagination to visualize the fate of less prominent offenders. If a military
detachment was raiding in aborder region, ifa rebel district was being pacified,
or ifa village was being punished for some misdemeanour, the men frequently
escaped, but itwas their women who were handed over to the soldiers, or sold as
slaves. Anepisode of this kind occurred in Azarbaljan in the 1830s, when a
village in Salmas district, which had already paid its taxes to Abbas Mirza,
declined to pay them again to his younger son, Jahanglr Mirza, who was in need
of cash. After plundering the village, the prince had the entire population carried
off to Khuy, where the men were immediately executed. "The females, after
being given over to the soldiery and furoshes, were likewise put to death, or had
their lives spared secretly by being made slaves of; accounts differ as to the
treatment ofthe children . . . the number of sufferers has been stated at three
hundred."103
Obviously, the role of women in 19th-century Iran is only one of many lacunae
in our understanding of the way in which that society functioned. Research into
Iranian social history has hardly begun, and the task ahead isaformidable one.

CHAPTER l 6
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC PENETRATION, 1872
1921
In the course of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, the foreign
economic impact on Iran was far weaker than on its neighbours: India,
Transcaucasia, Turkey, Syria, Egypt and, after 1865, Central Asia. A few figures
illustrate the difference. In 1913, Iran's foreign trade (exports and imports) per
capita was $10, Turkey's $15, Egypt's $24 and India's $4. Foreign capital
investment totalled about §15 o million, compared to over % 1,000 million each in
Egypt and Turkey and nearly $2,000 million in India. There were, to all intents
and purposes, no railways in Iran, as against some 3,500 kilometres in Turkey,
4,300 in Egypt and 56,000 in India, and practically no modern factories. It may
be added that the foreign social and cultural impact - as indicated, for example,
by the number of alien residents, foreign schools, books and newspapers
published or films shown — was also much weaker in Iran.
Several factors explain this situation. First, there was Iran's geographic
isolation: until the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 it was over 10,000 miles
away from Western Europe and 1,500-2,000 miles from the main centres of
Russian economic activity; and in the era of sea trade, Iran, unlike its Middle
Eastern neighbours, lay off the world's great commercial routes. Secondly there
was its physical structure: its inhospitable coast lines, rugged terrain, and the fact
that its most fertile and richest provinces are cut off from the open seas by
mountain ranges and deserts which, coupled with lack of navigable rivers,
inhibited facility of communications. Thirdly, there was the political and
economic collapse of the 18th century, which had left Iran an exhausted and
impoverished country with little economic surplus and led to a marked decline
in its foreign trade. Moreover, the weakness of the central government, and its
very tentative control of large parts of its territory and population made Iran a
less attractive field for foreign penetration than India, Transcaucasia and Central
Asia, for example, or such relatively secure countries as Egypt and Turkey.
There was also a social factor: unlike the other Middle Eastern countries, Iran
did not have large non-Muslim minorities whose early contacts with Europe had
enabled them to obtain Western education and knowledge of business methods,
and who consequently formed valuable links with foreign capital and enterprise.

TRANSPORT
Lastly, there was the powerful retarding factor of Anglo-Russian rivalry, which
stultified many attempts at development. For all these reasons, foreign econ
omic penetration started later in Iran, and proceeded more slowly, than in the
surrounding areas. It may be studied under the following headings: transport;
trade; finance and capital investment; manufacturing and petroleum.
TRANSPORT1
Modern transport first reached Iran in 1836, when Colonel Chesney's steam
boat, which had sailed down the Euphrates, arrived at Bushire. But this
development was not extended until 1862,when the Burmah (later British India)
Steam Navigation company established a six-weekly steamer service, eventually
converted into a weekly one, between Karachi and the various Iranian and Arab
ports of the Persian Gulf. In the same year, a regular service was established on
the Tigris, between Baghdad and Basra. The opening of the Suez Canal gave a
great stimulus to navigation in the Gulf, putting it within reach of steamers
sailing from Europe. By 1870, the British line had been joined by an Iranian
(sailing under the British flag) and a Turkish line, as well as by tramp steamers.
The next forty years saw the failure of the attempt to establish a French line, and
the inauguration of Russian (in 1901) and German (1906) lines to the Gulf, to
continue service until the First World War. The latter, the Hamburg-Amerika
line, competed successfully with the British companies, which, as late as 1909
10, accounted for 90% of the Gulf's shipping, and forced freights down. In
1914, three-quarters of the total tonnage was British and one-eighth German.
The foreign lines presumably drove many Iranian and Arab sailing ships out
of business, but their expansion was made possible mainly by the huge increase
in traffic. In 1871,the tonnage of steam ships entering Bushire was well under
5,000; by 1889 it had risen to 115,000 and in 1911, 200 steamers aggregating
319,000 tons entered the port. Most of these ships also called at other Gulf ports
and, in 1913, more than 4,000 ships, with a total tonnage of over 2,000,000
stopped at Iranian ports.
At the same time, there were parallel developments in the Caspian Sea.
Starting in the 18th century, growing numbers of Russian commercial ships
began to sail on the Caspian; in the 1840s, steamships made their appearance and,
by the 1850s, crossed over to Iran with increasing frequency. This expansion of
Russian shipping on the Caspian was accompanied by the decline of Iranian

EUROPEAN ECONOMIC PENETRATION
shipping, which, by the mid-19th century, had been almost eliminated. In1861,
a regular service, subsidized by theRussian government, was started by the
Kavkaz-Merkuz Company, which had been operating onthe Volga since 1849,
and other Russian lines came intobeing during the next two decades. The total
number of Russian steamers rose from 10, aggregating 2,600 tons, in 1867 to
139, aggregating 74,000 tons, in 1893 and265, with a tonnage of 118,000, in
1907. The total traffic entering Iranian ports onthe Caspian in 1907—8 consisted
of 2,171 steamers, with a tonnage of 800,000, and 584 sailing-ships of 15,000
tons.2
This traffic was stimulated byimproved transport in both Russia and Iran.
The fact that the Russian rivers freeze in winter greatly impeded communica
tions between the Caspian and central Russia, butthe inauguration of a steam
service on the Volga in 1843 somewhat eased the situation. More important was
the extension ofthe Russian railways toBaku in 1884 and toAstrakhan in 1909.
On the Iranian side, the poor condition of the ports caused great delays,
accumulation and deterioration of merchandise and appreciable costs. To
reduce this, between 1905 and1913, Russia invested 1,300,000 roubles in im
provements at Enzeli; a larger programme was interrupted bythe First World
War. After thedisruption caused by theBolshevik Revolution andtheCivil
War, services on theCaspian were resumed bytheSoviet Kaspar Company.3
Lastly, mention should be made of steam navigation on the Black Sea.
Regular services between Constantinople and Trebizond (Trabzon) were estab
lished in 1836, and greatly expanded thereafter. This helped the trade of
northern Iran, by diverting theexports andimports of Tabriz to Trebizond,
instead of to Constantinople, Smyrna or Aleppo, and about the middle of the
century that route carried nearly half of Iran's total imports and aslightly smaller
fraction of its exports.
Iran's links with the outside world were further increased by telegraph lines.
In 1860, aline was laid from Tehran toTabriz and soon extended to Julfa, where
it connected with the Russian network. In 1863, work began on a British
sponsored line linked atone end tothe Turkish telegraphs atKhanaqin, inIraq,
and, atthe other, by a submarine cable toKarachi. By the 1880s, Iran possessed
4,000 miles of telegraph lines.
Already by thepreceding decade, with theloss to Iranians of most of the
carrying trade, thebulk of Iran's external trade was probably being carried by
the steamers ofmaritime powers. Internal transport trade was slower. Several

TRANSPORT
rather ambitious railway schemes, including a line linking India to Iraq and the
Mediterranean, were put forward by various foreign interests in the 1850s and
1860s, but none of them materialized. In 1872, however, a concession was
granted to a British subject, Baron Julius de Reuter, which, in Lord Curzon's
words, "was the most complete and extraordinary surrender of the entire
industrial resources of a kingdom into foreign hands that has probably ever been
dreamt of, much less accomplished, in history". Its main provision was a
seventy-year concession for a railway from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf, with
branch lines "either to join the provinces and towns in the interior of the
Empire, or to join the Persian lines with foreign railways at any point on the
frontiers in the direction of Europe or of India". In addition, the concession
granted vast exclusive mineral and irrigation rights, and gave a prior claim in
banking, roads, factories and other activities. The government was to receive
20% of the net profits on railways and 15% on other enterprises. Naturally, this
sweeping alienation of resources aroused both Iranian and Russian opposition,
and, since Reuter received no official British support, he was forced to with
draw, after having prepared one kilometre of railway bed. But the Russian
diplomatic thrust generated by his intrusion pushed through another conces
sion, the Falkenhagen concession of 1874, for a line from Julfa to Tabriz; this
also had additional provisions, including mineral rights. However, the Russian
government failed to provide the necessary funds, and the concession lapsed.
Various schemes put forward by French, British, American and Belgian pro
moters between 1878 and 1888 also failed.
By the latter date, both the British and Russian governments were thor
oughly involved in the railway question, and both were divided by conflicting
considerations. Britain was the leading railway builder of the 19th century, and
British-built lines had stimulated its exports both directly and indirectly. More
over, faced with growing Russian commercial competition, the British increas
ingly felt the need for modern transport in southern and central Iran, but at the
same time feared that railways in the north, where, interestingly enough,
Reuter's line had been started, would facilitate Russian economic penetration.
Still more serious was the threat posed by Russian railways to Britain's position
in the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea and Afghanistan, and to the defence of
India. Hence, in 1888,the British induced the Shah to concede "the priority of
the English Government over others in the construction of a southern railway
to Tehran". They seem to have intended to use this agreement, and the still
unlapsed Reuter concession, either to restrict the Russian railway to the north
ern part of the country - with the possibility of building a British line in the

south - or to insist on the line's being "an international one", "in which English
capitalists should have a share".
Simultaneously, a group of Russian businessmen, with the tentative financial
banking of the French Banque d'Escompte, put forward a scheme for a line from
the Caspian to the Arabian Sea, and, in 1889, the Shah agreed with the Russian
government to "grant to a Russian Company the construction in Persia of
railways to anywhere where itmay be advantageous to the commercial interests
of both Governments". But theRussian government was having second
thoughts too, fearing that railways would not only undermine its position in the
Iranian market, but also open up the Russian provinces toBritish orGerman
economic — and possibly political — penetration. Hence, on 11 November 1890,
Russia secured an agreement by which "the Persian Government engages for
the space of 1 o years — neither itself to construct a railway in Persian territory nor
to permit nor grant a Concession for the construction of railways to aCompany
or other persons". This agreement, described by the British as "sterilizing", was
renewed in 1900 and fortwenty years blocked allrailway projects, whether
British, such as theQuetta-Sistan scheme; German, such as the line from
Baghdad toTehran; orRussian, such as the various suggestions for a railway
through Khurasan and the ambitious Sakhanskii project for a line from Rasht to
Bushire and Bandar Abbas.
After the expiry of the agreement, various new schemes were presented.In
1911, aBritish syndicate, including the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and Impe
rial Bank groups, secured a concession fora line from Muhammara and/or
Khaur Musa to Khurramabad. A Russian-sponsored scheme for aline from the
Caspian to the Arabian Sea, to be jointly financed by Russian, French and British
capital, was also considered. Neither was implemented, but the concession
given, on 6 February 1913, to the Russian Discount and Loan Bank, for an 85
mile Julfa-Tabriz line, with a 30-mile branch to Urmiya, was actually carried out
during the War, the line reaching Urmiya in 1916. At the same time the British,
who in 1905 had linked Quetta to Nushki, extended theline to Duzdab
(Zahidan). Thus itmay be said that, until the First World War, Anglo-Russian
rivalry prevented all railway building in Iran.
Therefore, other means had to be found for moving goods within the
country, especially to the ports. The British turned to the rivers, supplemented
by roads, and the Russians tothe roads alone. Steam navigation on the Tigris
made the shipping of goods to Baghdad and thence transport by pack animals to
Tehran through Qasr-i Shirin and Kirmanshah advantageous. In 1888, under

distance of 120 miles, and a steamer service was quickly started by the Lynch
company that operated on the Tigris. Shortly after, the upper stretch of the river
from Ahvaz to Shushtar pack animals carried goods to Isfahan and the interior.
Traffic on the river increased rapidly, and was further stimulated by the
development of the oil industry in the 1900s.
The Russians concentrated on road-building in the northern part of the
country. Between 1893 and 1914, they built nearly 500 miles of roads, connect
ing Tehran with Enzeli (379 kilometres), Tabriz with Julfa (135 kilometres) and
Qazvin with Hamadan (243 kilometres). Other roads were built by a British firm
between Tehran and Qum (147 kilometres) and Qum and Arak (135 kilometres).
Shortly before the First World War, motor vehicles began to circulate in Iran,
but the transport of both goods and passengers continued to be very slow and
expensive. During the war, military operations caused severe damage to the
roads, but this was partly offset by the 1,000 miles of roads built in the British
sector from the coast to Shiraz and beyond; motor traffic also showed an
increase in this period. The port of Bushire was also improved.4 However, by
the end of the Qajar period, Iran was still almost devoid of internal modern
transport and the impact of the latter on the country was negligible.
TRADE5
On the other hand, the transport developments described above greatly facili
tated the expansion of foreign trade. In the 18th century, Iran's trade had sharply
declined, but the first thirty years of Qajar rule saw a marked recovery, by way of
both the Persian Gulf and the Black Sea. By i860, total trade (imports and
exports) amounted to some £5,000,000, or about twice as much in current
prices, and perhaps three times as much in real terms, as it had been at the
beginning of the century. By the 1880s, the total was around £7,500,000; in
1901, just over £9,000,000; in 1912—13 £18,250,000, and in 1913—14,
£20,000,000. Since world prices in 1913 were close to those of i860, the
quadrupling of value between those two years represents a four-fold increase in
real terms. It also implies a twelve-fold increase in 1800—1913, far below the
corresponding growth in India, Transcaucasia, and most of the Middle Eastern
countries.
Until the middle of the 19th century, imports and exports seem to have been

fairly well balanced. After that time, imports increased rapidly and, by the
beginning ofthis century, exceeded exports bya third toa half. It isnot clear
how this trade deficit was covered: remittances by Iranian workers in Russia and
elsewhere, foreign loans andinvestments, foreign travel, andsome release,
through revised minting procedures, ofspecie held inprivate hands,6 seem to
have been the main balancing factors, but there was also asignificant amount of
unrecorded exports.
The expansion of Iran's trade took place within the administrative frame
work set up by the Treaties of Gulistan and Turkmanchai. These provided that
both Russian imports into Iran and exports from it would pay a 5 % ad valorem
duty, thesame terms applying to Iranian trade with Russia. In 1841, Britain
obtained the same privileges, as did the other Powrers in the next few years. And
although Russia had been the first to secure acommercial treaty, Britain, then by
far the leading trader, proved the most vigilant in ensuring enforcement and
preventing the Iranian government granting any monopolies, which had pre
viously represented alarge source ofrevenue, orthe imposition of any prohibi
tions or restrictions on foreign trade.
No change was made inthe tariff until 1903, when a new treaty was signed
with Russia, followed immediately by Britain and other countries. This replaced
the general ad valorem duty by specific ones, which favoured certain imports
from Russia, notably cotton goods, tea, kerosene and sugar, over those from
Britain andother countries. It also reduced or eliminated export duties on
certain goods that chiefly went toRussia, such as cotton and rice, while raising
those on some goods exported mainly to the British Empire, such as opium,
wheat and linseed.
Those treaties and, more important, the world-wide economic forces at
work, brought about significant shifts in thedirection of trade. Malcolm's
estimates for 1800 show that some five-sixths ofIran's trade was with Turkey,
Afghanistan, Bukhara andIndia, practically all the rest being with Russia.
However, asignificant proportion of imports from Turkey and India consisted
of European goods, some of which were re-exported to Central Asia. By the
1850s, a drastic shift had taken place. According toBlau, imports of European
goods through Trebizond alone accounted forhalf ofIran's total imports, to
which should be added asubstantial fraction of the quarter consisting of imports

TRADE
from India. In both cases, the bulk of the merchandise was British, and it seems
probable that, in the 1850s and 1860s, Britain supplied well over half of Iran's
imports and took about a half of its exports. Russia's share of imports was put at
under a tenth and in exports at about a third.7
Official Russian trade figures show a relatively small rise in terms of gold
roubles between the 1830s and 1860s, but contemporary observers pointed out
that much smuggling took place, and Blau's estimates tried to take this into
account. However, starting in the 1870s, trade with Russia gathered momentum
and the Russian customs returns show a rise in total trade from an annual
average of 6.3 million gold roubles in the 185 os to one of 87.7 millions in 1909
14.8 By then, Russia took some 70% of Iran's exports, supplied over 50% of her
imports, and accounted for almost two-thirds of total trade. The share of the
British Empire had fallen to a little over 25% of imports, 12% of exports and
20% of total trade; of this, somewhat under half was accounted for by India. The
remaining 10 to 15% was shared by the Ottoman Empire, France, Germany and
others.9 Trade with Central Asia dwindled, since, once the railways had reached
its borders, Afghanistan could more easily trade with India. In addition, the
Russian economy absorbed the khanates after 1865.
The shift in Russia's favour can be partly explained by economic factors,
especially lower costs of transport to Iran's well populated and relatively
prosperous northern regions. But political factors also played a part. The
Russian government actively promoted trade by sponsoring and subsidizing
steamship services and roads, by extending help through a Loan and Discount
Bank, and by putting export premiums on cotton goods and sugar.
The shifts in the composition of Iran's trade were no less drastic, with
profound repercussions on its economic and social life. The commercial treaties
prevented the Iranian government from using tariff protection to shelter local
industry against the competition of European machine-made goods. Hence, the
most striking feature of Iran's trade in the 19th century was the sharp rise in
textile imports, particularly cotton goods, which, by the 1850s accounted for
some two-thirds of the total imports. The value of textiles continued to increase
until the First World War, but their share dropped slowly to a little over one half.
The other main import item was "colonial goods", i.e. sugar, tea and spices.
Tea-drinking, introduced from Russia, spread rapidly in the 19th century and
both tea and sugar consumption increased greatly. By the 1850s, these two items

accounted forwell over one-tenth ofthe total imports and, by 1900, forover a
quarter. The balance consisted ofhardware, glassware and, increasingly, kero
sene. The very slow development ofIran isreflected inthe very small amount of
capital goods imported; forthe years 1900—27, the proportion oftotal imports
represented by capital goods hasbeen put at only 3%.10
The impact of the massive import of cheap textiles on Iranian handicrafts was
devastating, and aggravated by changes in taste and fashion, which made
consumers prefer foreign styles tonative. Various foreign observers writing in
the 1840s and 1850s, describe the decay of such ancient and flourishing handi
craft centres as Kashan, Isfahan, Shlraz, Kirman and Yazd, owing to these
factors, was well as to theremoval of the capital andcourt to Tehran.11The
decline ofhandicrafts, together with the growth ofthe central government and
bureaucracy, also caused a weakening ofthe guilds that had previously played
such an important part in Iranian cities.12 However, figures forthe end ofthe
19th or thebeginning of the 20th century show that many of the old textile
handicrafts did manage tosurvive until the First World War and even later, and
exports of textiles tothe Caucasus and Central Asia, which had been very largeat
the beginning of the 19th century, did notcompletely cease until the war.13
While foreign trade undermined the most important traditional handicrafts,
it stimulated those connected with expanding exports. Among these was leather:
increased demand from Russia led to an expansion of production and the
replacement, especially inMashhad and Hamadan, oftraditional workshopsby
factories employing upto40 or 50 workers. Similar developments forthe same
reasons occurred inthe production of henna in the Kirman district and ofopium
in various parts of the country. But the outstanding example of the expansion
and transformation of a craft owing to foreign demand was carpets. Inthe 1870s,
growing affluence in Europe and the United States began to create a large
demand for Persian carpets, and improved steam navigation reduced thehigh
costs oftransporting them. British, Russian and German capital was invested in
the industry and factories and large workshops, some employing several hun
dred workers. Iranian merchants from Tabriz and elsewhere also setup large
workshops, but the bulk ofproduction continued tocome from the traditional
centres, financed andsupervised by merchants. Output expanded greatlyand

TRADE
exports multiplied, amounting in 1914 to about £1,000,000, or nearly one
eighth of Iran's total exports.14
No less significant, and more widespread in its impact, was the effect of
foreign trade on agriculture. Silk production had sharply declined in the 18th
century, but rose steadily in the 19th, to a peak of 1,000 tons in 1864. An
important part in this growth was played by Greek and other exporters, who
advanced funds to the growers directly or through small merchants, many of
them Armenian. In 1864, however, the muscardine disease reached Iran and, by
the 1870s, the crop was reduced by about four-fifths. Once more, the foreign
exporters helped silk to recover, this time by introducing disease-resistant
silkworm-eggs from Japan. However, at the outbreak of the First World War,
output was still well below the 1864 peak.
Opium also expanded thanks to foreign demand. A successful shipment to
China in 1823 by an Iranian merchant was followed by a slow increase in
production and trade and, by 1859, exports amounted to nearly 60,000 lbs, rising
thereafter to nearly 1,600,000 in 1880; after that, production levelled off, while
rising domestic consumption diminished the amount available for export.
Opium was estimated to have a net monetary return three times as high as wheat,
and displaced that crop in many areas, contributing to the grain shortage of the
1870s.
Rice and cotton also responded to foreign demand, particularly Russia. The
growing output of rice had been consumed domestically but, after the 1880s, it
went increasingly to the Russian market, helped by both the imposition by
Russia of a high duty on imports of rice from other countries and the completion
of the Transcaspian railway which reduced costs of transport to Turkistan.
Exports to Russia rose from £25,000 in the 1870s to over £200,000 in the 1890s
and averaged £500,000 in 1904—8, by which time they amounted to nearly half
the total output of GTlan.
Cotton exports, quite significant in the 17th century, seem to have ceased in
the 18th and the first half of the 19th. Around 1852, however, American cotton
was introduced in the Urmiya region, presumably by American missionaries
and, a few years later, small exports to Russia were recorded. The American
Civil War gave a temporary stimulus to cotton production and exports in Iran,
as in other parts of the world, but a more permanent one came from growing
demand in Russia. Russian and Armenian merchants helped the process, by

advancing money, setting up ginneries, distributing seeds and raising standards
of production. As with rice, Iranian cotton was helped by higher duties imposed
in Russia on other foreign cottons and by improved transport. The area under
cotton cultivation expanded rapidly, toover 100,000 hectares on the eve ofthe
First World War, and output was estimated at 33,000 tons of which 25,000,
worth about £1,500,000, were exported, almost entirely to Russia.
The expansion incrops for export had repercussions on Iranian agriculture.
With theexceptions noted above, there were no important changes in tech
niques. Butthe opportunity of higher income for landlords and increased
participation of foreign and Iranian merchants and moneylenders in agriculture,
replaced traditional agrarian relations bymore "capitalistic" ones. Land rents
seem to have risen sharply, there is evidence of growing concentration of
ownership, and some large landlords appear to have taken amore active interest
in their farms.15
Lastly, a fewwords may be said about theagents of this trade. At the
beginning ofthe 19th century, practically all the foreign trade ofIran seems to
have been in Iranian hands. By the middle of the century, aconsiderable part had
passed into European control and itis probable that the foreign share continued
to increase until the First World War, by which time itaccounted for the bulk of
Iran's foreign trade. Perhaps themost important factor in this shift wasthe
favourable status enjoyed by foreigners due to the Capitulations and the
Commercial Treaties. Although this did not fully protect them against arbitrary
action onthe part ofIranian officials - British and French consular despatches
frequently complain of this — it severely limited thescope of such acts. The
Iranians had nosafeguard against their own government and hence were not
only farless secure in their property, but had to pay higher taxes. A despatch
from theBritish Consul in Tabriz in 1851 shows that whereas a European
merchant paid 5 % on his imports, an Iranian paid ~]\%on textiles and 14% on
sugar and, inaddition, was subject torahdarlik (road tax) every time his goods
passed through an Iranian town.16
As regards the trade of Tabriz — which atthat time constituted about half the
national total - more specific information isavailable. The Russian traveller L.
Berezin, who visited Iran in 1842, states that, "The trade ofTabriz . . . falls into
two sharply defined periods: until 1837 the Persians themselves were predomi
nant and after that date foreign merchants, including Russian, were preponder

TRADE
ant."17 Berezin attributes the shift to the effects of the 1837 international
financial crisis, which found Iranian importers overstocked and indebted to
various firms in Constantinople, making many of them bankrupt. At this point,
the Greek firm of Ralli of Constantinople opened a branch in Tabriz. With
offices in Manchester, Marseilles, Odessa, and elsewhere, operating first under
Russian and then British protection, Ralli soon became the leader in the field and
later developed into a major international firm, with headquarters in London.
Its example was swiftly followed by others, and, writing in 1849, a well
informed Austrian, Rudolf Godel, listed three Greek firms, one Austrian and
five belonging to Armenian or Georgian Russian subjects.18 The Iranian
merchants of Tabriz attempted to fight back by forming a combination in 1844,
as did those of Kashan in 1845, but both broke down.19 Nor was the Iranian
government more successful when, in 1841,it banned the consumption of tea; it
claimed that the "Chinese mixed poison in their tea", but the true cause,
according to the British Consul, was that the merchants wanted to embarrass the
Russian Georgians "who have the principal traffic in that article, whereas native
merchants have none".20
In other parts of the country, Persian Gulf trade was increasingly handled by
such British firms as Gray, Paul and Co., in the second half of the century, while
the rapidly expanding Russian trade was conducted mainly by Armenians,
Georgians, and other Russian subjects. A list compiled by a German observer
shows 14 large British and 23 Russian trading firms in Iran in 1914.21 In addition
to the diplomatic support of their governments, these firms received credit and
other aid from the British Imperial Bank and the Russian Discount and Loan
Bank.
The expansion of Iran's foreign trade was halted by the First World War and
the great dislocations it caused in Iran and the neighbouring countries. Cotton
output fell to a negligible level and the main market for carpets was lost. The
volume of exports other than oil declined from an average of over 276,000 tons
in 1911—13 to a low of 49,000 in 1918, with an almost equal decrease in value, and
imports fell from 323,000 tons to a low of 130,000 in 1920. It was not until the
early 1930s that the level of pre-war export and import values was regained.
There was also a sharp drop in Russia's share of the trade, and a corresponding
increase in that of Britain and India: as regards imports, a shift took place during

the war, but Iran's exports to Russia continued at ahigh level until the Russian
Civil War. It should be added that in 1920,when British influence was at its
height, the tariff was again changed. Duties were considerably increased, giving
Iran both some protection and added revenue, butcharges on traditional
exports from Russia such as sugar, matches and petroleum rose more than the
average and those on certain leading imports from the British Empire, such as
tea and cotton, were either reduced or remained unchanged. These duties
remained in force until Iran recovered its autonomy as regards tariffs in 1928.22
FINANCE, FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND CONCESSIONS23
During theperiod under review, Iran was on a silver standard andthevalue of its
currency steadily depreciated — from 10krans (1 tumari) to the pound sterling in
1800 to 20in 1840; 25 in1870; and 5 5or over on the eveof the First World War.
Until the early 1870s themain factor depressing the kran wasthe reduction inits
weight and fineness but,after that date, the rapid fall in the world price of silver
relative to gold — due to the shift of most advanced countries from asilver to a
gold standard — wasan even more powerful force. During the war,the value of
silver rose, and with itthe rate of the kran to apeak of 25 in1919, but itthen fell
steadily again, even after the introduction of exchange control in 1930.Such a
large decline in the value of the currency was, naturally, accompanied by a sharp
rise inprices. This, inturn, affected various sections ofthe population differ
ently, and the data suggest that skilled workers suffered adecline in real wages,
and the same may also have been true ofunskilled workers.24
Modern banking came late to Iran. In 1888, aBritish bank, the New Oriental
Corporation, opened offices in sixIranian towns. The following year,the
Imperial Bank of Persia, also aBritish firm, wasfounded in settlement of claims
related to therescinded Reuter concession. Among its privileges was the
exclusive right, for sixty years, to issue banknotes. In addition to ordinary
commercial transactions, itmade loans to the government. In 1890, ittook over
the New Oriental Corporation and thereafter opened other branches. At the
outbreak ofthe First World War both its note issue and deposits had almost
reached £1,000,000.

des Prets was formed, also incompensation fora cancelled railway concession
originally granted to Poliakov. In 1899, it was taken over by the Russian
government and its name changed to Banque d'Escompte de Perse
(Uchyetnossudny Bank). In addition to supporting Russian enterprises and lending
freely to Iranians for both financial and political purposes, it too made large
loans to the Iranian government.
Iran began contracting foreign loans rather later than its Indian, Middle
Eastern, and North African neighbours. The first, for£500,000, was from the
Imperial Bank, in 1892, tocompensate the British Tobacco Corporation. Two
Russian loans, in 1900 and 1902, followed, aggregating 32.5 million roubles
(about £3,250,000), part of which was used to pay offthe British loan. In the
following tenyears, two more Russian loans were contracted (for 60 million
krans or £1,100,000 in 1911 andfor £200,000 in 1913), andfive British or
Anglo-Indian, aggregating £1,85 0,000. By 1913, Iran's consolidated debt stood
at £6,75 4,000, with an annual service charge of £5 37,000. The latter represented
about a quarter ofgovernment expenditure, absorbing the greater part of the
customs revenues pledged as a guarantee for thevarious loans. These were
rising steadily, due toexpanding trade and the reorganization ofthe Customs
Administration by Belgian and other advisers. There were also floating debts of
nearly £900,000 to foreign creditors.
During the war, the Iranian government received large advances from the
British government and, by 1922, itsdebt to Britain amounted to£5,590,000.
But two developments greatly lightened the debt burden. First, the Soviet
government cancelled all thedebts owed to Russia, andsecondly, thelarge
expenditure by the belligerents in Iran and the depreciation of the pound sterling
raised theexchange rate of the kran and practically halved thevalue of the
sterling debt. The rise in the general price level at home and abroad, andthe
increase of government revenue further reduced theweight of the debt and
made redemption easier. By the mid 1920s the total outstanding debt had been
brought down to an insignificant amount.25
In the search for revenue, numerous concessions were granted to foreigners.
The most important have been mentioned, and those in manufacturing and
mining are discussed below. Here three concessions will bebriefly reviewed.
That given to Lianozov, an Armenian of Russian nationality in 1873, f ° r t n e
caviar fisheries in the Caspian, proved the most durable. It was regularly
renewed, the annual rate ofpayment to the Iranian government rising slowly

from 410,000 krans (£16,000) in 1873, t o 480,000 krans (£19,000) in 1911. In
1927, theSoviet government, which had taken upLianozov's rights, setup a
company that operated the fisheries until 1953.
In 1888, a Belgian firm received exclusive rights to build railways from
Tehran to Qazvin andto Qum. In fact it built only a 30 kilometre line from
Tehran tothequarries ofShah cAbd al-cAzim, and ranthree lines of horse-drawn
trams in Tehran.
The third concession wasthe most controversial, and hadtoberescinded.In
1890 aBritish company, the Imperial Tobacco Corporation ofPersia, received a
monopoly ofthe purchase, processing and sale ofall Iranian tobacco, which by
then constituted animportant export item. In return, thegovernment was to
receive £ 15,000 ayear plus 25 % ofnet profits after payment ofa 5 % dividend to
share-holders. Theopposition of the tobacco merchants, backed bythe religious
classes and the Russians, resulted ina major political crisis, and the concession
was cancelled. TheCompany obtained compensation of £500,000.
It isvery difficult toestimate accurately the amount offoreign investment in
Iran before the First World War. The best available figures are those compiled
by Litten who, states, however, that they areonly "rough estimates andmakeno
claim to accuracy".26 Russian investments were putat 163,750,000 roubles,
perhaps £16,000,000; of this, 44.5 million roubles represented loans to the
Iranian government; 48million in mortgages, 38million in roads, railways,
ports and telegraphs, 11.8 million intheshare capital ofthe Russian bank, 10
million in theLianozov caviar fisheries and20 million in various shipping
companies and trading firms. British investments were estimated at £9,700,000;
of this £1.7million represented loans tothe Iranian government, £2.75 million
the Anglo-Persian OilCompany's capital, and £1 million that ofthe Imperial
Bank, while thePersian Railways Syndicate's capital wasputat£3 million, a sum
not actually invested in Iran. Belgian investments, in railways, streetcars and
factories, were putat 13million francs, or£500,000, and German investment,
mainly ina carpet-making firm, ata slightly higher figure. Altogether, foreign
investment in Iran cannot have exceeded £30million.

MANUFACTURING, MINING AND PETROLEUM
manufacturing wasimpeded by the usual obstacles: the small size and dispersion
of the population, the poverty of the masses, the absence of water or mechanical
transport, the lack ofwater power and the high cost offuel, the lack of skilled
labour and technical and supervisory personnel, the scarcity and timorousness
of capital and, not least, the fact that the government was uninterested in
industrial development, and, even had it been, it would have been unable to
protect local industries against foreign competition, because of the Commercial
Treaties. A few government attempts in 1849to set upmodern factories, and
similar private ones in thenext thirty years, ended in failure. Sodida more
ambitious undertaking by aBelgian company in the 1890s, to establish glass and
sugar factories and a gasworks.28 But, concurrently, several small factories in
fields such as cotton ginning, spinning and weaving, silk reeling, matches, soap
and brewing, and afew electric power plants were set up by Iranians. However,
the low level ofindustrialization on the eve ofthe First World War is indicated
by theestimate of total employment in modern factories: 1,700 persons, as
compared with about 100,000 inhandicrafts.29 There was nofurther develop
ment during thewar and very little in the 1920s.
Mining, too, made very little progress. Iran possesses a wide variety of
minerals, notably iron, copper, and coal, but most of these are insmall deposits.
In the period under review, they continued to be worked by traditional methods
and output wassmall.30 In 1890, the British-owned Persian Bank Mining Rights
Corporation was formed, with a capital of£ 1,000,000, to take over the rights
given to theImperial Bank of Persia as part of the settlement of the Reuter
concession. Surveys were made but nomining undertaken, except in oil (see
below) and in 1894 the company went into liquidation. Two concessions
granted toRussians inthe Qaradagh region in 1908and along the Julfa-Tabriz
railway in 1913also failed toproduce results. The only foreign-operated mines
in Iran were the iron oxide deposits onHurmuz Island, worked by the British
firm of Strick and Company, exporting some 3,000—4,000 tons a year. In 1906,
the Wonckhaus, a German enterprise, received a concession forthe iron oxide
deposits of Abu Musa, but British opposition, resulting in an international
incident, ledto its cancellation thefollowing year.31
No mention has, so far, been made of Iran's most valuable resource, oil. Until
the beginning of this century, Iran wasof greater interest to the outside world as
a consumer, rather than producer, ofpetroleum. Russian oil had been brought
into the country by ship across the Caspian for centuries, and,with the

EUROPEAN ECONOMIC PENETRATION
development of the modern petroleum industry, kerosene and crude oil were
shipped in increasing quantity; some of the refining was done at Enzeli until
1896 when, dueto a refund of duties, Russian exports came to consist entirely of
refined products. In 1908, Nobel Brothers started operations in Iran, building
storage tanks in Enzeli and Rasht and a 16 kilometre kerosene pipeline.
Thereafter, Russian products captured almost all the Iranian market. In the
south, however, the Standard Oil Company competed sucessfully and, starting
in 1912, the products of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company began to take over an
increasing share of the market, completely driving out Russian oil by the end of
the 1920s.
Iran also drew Russian attention as a transit point between the oil fields of
Baku and India and the Far East, where high transport costs were making
competition against American oil difficult for the Russians. In 1884, a n d more
vigorously in 1901, projects were presented by the oil industry to the Russian
government for a kerosene pipeline to the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean.
However divisions on this question within the Russian government weakened
the project, and it was finally ended by the British government's contention in
1902 that such a pipeline would violate the concession granted to D'Arcy the
previous year.32
The first wells sunk by a foreign concern in Iran, Hotz and Company of
Bushire in 1884,failed to produce oil and three attempts by the Persian Bank
Mining Rights Corporation, in 1889—92, were equally unsuccessful. In 1892,
however, aFrench geologist, deMorgan, published an article on theoil seepages
he hadstudied at Kend-i Shirin, in western Iran, andinterested W.K. D'Arcy, an
Englishman who had made a fortune in Australian mining. Backed by the
British authorities D'Arcy secured, on 28 May 1901, a sixty-year concession for
the exploration, exploitation and export of petroleum. The conceded area
covered 480,000 square miles, excluding only the five northern provinces in
deference to Russian susceptibilities. The Iranian government was to receive
16% of the net profits, as well as 20,000 shares of £1 each and £20,000 in cash.
Exploration began in 1902. The results were at first disappointing and,in 1905,
D'Arcy had to turn for financial aid to the Concessions Syndicate, which was
formed for the purpose by the Burmah Oil Company. Operations were then
resumed and,in 1908, abundant oil wasstruck at Masjid-i Sulaiman. This ledto
the formation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on 14 April, 1909, with a
capital of £2,000,000. A refinery was built at Abadan, supplied by a 140 mile

pipeline and, in August 1912, the first shipment of oil was made. In 1913, a
contract was signed with the British Admiralty for the supply of fuel oil and, on
20 May 1914, the share value of the company was slightly more than doubled,
the balance being taken up by the British Treasury which thus secured a51%
interest in the company. Output of oil rose steadily: from 43,000 tons in 1912to
273,000 in 1914, 897,000 in 1918 and 2,327,000 in 1922, and continued increasing
until 1930. The Iranian government received a total of £1,330,000 in1912—18,
and thereafter averaged over £500,000 a year, inaddition to a special payment,
under the "Armitage-Smith agreement" of £1,000,000 in 1920, in settlement of
claims and counterclaims.33 By then, the industry was employing some 20,000
men and making asignificant contribution to the development of southern Iran.
Yet it would have been difficult to predict (in 1922, or even ten or twenty years
after) itsenormous growth over the next decades and the crucial role it later
played in the Iranian economy, as described in Chapters 17 and18.

CHAPTER I7
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, 1921-1979
THE IRANIAN ECONOMY IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE CENTURY
Economic conditions in Iran before 1912, when commercial oilexports were
first made, were perceived byforeign travellers to bedeteriorating. Curzon's
sweeping conclusions on the state of manufacturing industry in Iran, that
"factories, asthe term isunderstood in Europe, do not exist inPersia; and the
multiplication andeconomy of labour-force, by the employment of steam
power, or even water-power, is hardly known" and that "there was a decadence
of native ingenuity, consequent upon the importation of cheap European
substitutes,"1 were found to hold true in the early years of the twentieth century.
Issawi noted that "Iran . . . was relatively little affected by the [economic]
changes taking place inthe world until the exploitation ofoil."2 Even as lateas
1934, European assessment of the Iranian economy stressed the lack ofdiscern
ible development of a modern economy,3 while there is evidence that theoil
industry operated asaneconomic enclave with few linkages created into other
domestic activities.4 Agriculture, too, while notlacking entirely its owndy
namic of change5 arising from natural events such as occurrence of good and bad
crop years, or political interventions for reasons of taxation and competition for
land ownership, was for the most part unaffected by systematic improvements in
production and yields.6 Not until 1937 was there anattempt to provide a new
basis for modernization,7 amove that came tonothing as aresult ofRiza Shah's

lack of conviction in the need foragricultural change and, later, the difficult
position of the government after his abdication in 1941.8
The base on which economic development took place after 1921 was ex
tremely poor. Population estimates suggest a total of 11,370,000 persons in
1921, atwhich time growth, according toBharier,9 was less than one per cent
each year, constrained by high levels ofinfant mortality and losses, among the
rest of the population, due todisease and famine. More than eighty per cent of
the population were resident invillages and small towns with less than 30,000
inhabitants. Few areas boasted population densities above one hundred persons
per square mile outside the Tabriz, Caspian and Karun agricultural districts.In
much ofcentral and eastern Iran densities rarely exceeded ten per square mile.
Rural communities lived in comparative isolation, often because of the mor
phology of the village agricultural lands or limited access to water resources, and
were physically distinct from nearby settlements, almost as individual oases.A
tribal population probably numbering more than two million persons occupied
the Zagros Mountain system and the Persian Gulf coast.
Government finances were in a chaotic condition in the aftermath ofthe
revolution of 1905—6 and the economy was depressed byregional revolt and
maladministration.10 Other than the oil industry in the south,11 the economy was
concerned almost entirely with subsistence. Estimates of national income in
1921 are not reliable though one economist suggested that the total valueof
goods and services atprices of 1959 was not more than 80,000 million rials, a
level little above the "breadline".12 Agriculture was the main concern ofthe
majority of the people of Iran atthat time; as much as 85 % of the active labour
force was engaged directly or indirectly in farming.
THE ECONOMY UNDER RIZA SHAH
Following the coup d'etat ofFebruary 1921that brought Riza Khan topolitical
power as Commander-in-Chief of the army and Minister of War, itwas quickly
appreciated that modernization of the army and the prosecution of the cam
paigns against dissident tribal groups would require considerable and expand
ing financial support. In 1922 thegovernment recruited theservices of Dr

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, 1921-79
Millspaugh and a small team ofspecialists infinancial administration from the
United States of America. By means of special legislation and the activities of the
American financial advisers, a beginning was made in reform ofthe economy,
though this by and large concerned itself more with improving the efficiency of
existing production and its revenue yield than with creation of new productive
assets.
Modernization ofIran byRiza Shah began immediately after he took over
effective leadership ofthe state. Insummer 1922 a first important attempt was
made to reform the generally chaotic and ineffective system of domestic
taxation. Dr Millspaugh arrived to act as senior financial adviser. He put in train
a series of changes affecting taxes foragriculture and theMajlis passed laws
enabling the registration of land to beundertaken from 1922. The approach
tended, however, to be largely administrative, with improvement of an existing
system rather than thorough-going reform. Ultimately, Riza Shah appeared to
be more interested inaugmenting and making more reliable the flow of funds
with which to finance development ofthe army and his own power base than
with changing the basics of the Iranian economy.
In agriculture, the bedrock of the economy, Riza Shah initiated a modest
level of change in land ownership. He abolished the tuyul(land assignment) and
even began acadastral survey of the country, but he stopped far short of taking
up thereform of land ownership that had been proposed at thetime of the
Constitutional Movement earlier in the century. He appeared unwilling to upset
either the major landowners or his own position as an important holder of land.
There was aprogramme for the distribution of public domain lands in 1932 and
1933, affecting parts of Luristan, Kirmanshah and Azerbaijan, together with
further legislation in 193 7 providing for land allocations from the public domain
in Sistan. Inpractice, the division ofthe public domain lands inthose areas did
little toserve the interests ofthe peasants. Corruption and inefficiency ensured
that the best lands were acquired bythe existing landowners and by regional
officials of the government.13
A tax on land was promulgated in 1926, under which there was tobe a three
per cent levy on the produce taken from the land. Unfortunately, this tax relied
upon completion of the cadastral survey to be effective and progress in that area
was extremely slow even in the comparatively accessible areas ofthe country.
Acknowledgement of the failure of the land taxcame in 1934 when it was

THE ECONOMY UNDER RIZA SHAH
replaced by atax on agricultural output together with aform of income tax, both
payable in kind.
Few financial rewards accrued from the modernization of agricultural tax
ation and Riza Shah ultimately turned to other means of raising funds from rural
areas. A number of state monopolies and monopoly trading companies were
created during the 1930s. Most important agricultural products were managed
by the monopolies, including cotton, tobacco, tea, dried fruits, sugar and
opium. Inaddition tothe revenue effects ofthe monopolies, they also helped to
stimulate better yields and improved quality of products, though activities of the
state in agriculture also fostered a growing bureaucratic intervention in rural
areas, notalways to theadvantage of the peasants or landowners.
Perhaps foragriculture the most positive outcome ofRiza Shah's reign was
the innovation ofnew crops that was encouraged by the government as partof
Riza Shah's policy of reducing thestate's dependence on external supplies of
basic products. Sugar beet cultivation was introduced into the country on awide
scale and rapidly became a prime cash crop inthe better irrigated areas. There
was an expansion ofthe cotton acreage and abeginning totea cultivation inthe
northern districts of Gilan and Mazandaran as a result of direct government
encouragement, innovations that were to alter land use and agricultural econ
omy deeply throughout theCaspian coastlands.
Riza Shah's interventions into the livestock sector were not initially designed
for economic purposes.14 Enforced settlement of tribal groups as part of his
attempt to weaken politically the tribal groups that practised nomadism, par
ticularly inthe Zagros region ofthe country, had the effect ofpermitting more
secure forms of sedentary agriculture, both within tribal territories and lands
adjacent to them that had formerly been threatened by pressures from the
nomads. The livestock holding of the pastoral nomads did, however, decline
and itis thought that numbers of sheep and goats in Iran never reached the levels
prevailing in the 1920s.
In addition to concern with thetraditionally important areas of the agri
cultural economy, thegovernments under Riza Shah gave some attention to
modernization of manufacturing.15 Although some minor essays in industry had
been attempted before 1921, Iran possessed only an, albeit sophisticated,
handicraft industry before the drive to industrialization embarked upon in the
years 1931—41. Inthis period the government set up plants tomanufacture light

weaponry and ammunition but also became involved in textiles, manufacture of
construction materials, and processing of agricultural raw materials. Industrial
ization went hand inhand with modernization ofthe transport systems within
the country and the improved provision ofbanking, credit and storage ser
vices.16 The construction of the Trans-Iranian Railway was a major achievement
in this sphere though less dramatic investments in roads and ports also provided
new opportunities forthe domestic economy to take advantage ofa slowly
growing internal market.17
In keeping with the nationalistic element within Riza Shah's policies, a new
national bank was established in 1927 as Bank Melli. Itwas given authorityto
control the note issue, replacing the British Imperial Bank inthis role. Other
banks for agriculture, industry and mortgages, as also aNational Savings Bank,
were set up inthis period with the same objectives inview.
It has been suggested with some truth, that Riza Shah's concern with the
economy arose solely from hispreoccupation with military requirements.
Construction of roads and railways enabled rapid deployment of troops in this at
times unsettled country, while creation of monopolies for the agricultural sector
simply enabled abetter form of taxation to be imposed with which to sustain the
growing military infrastructure Riza Shah required. Yet, the additions to the
transport networks and the provision of improved banking permitted amodest
beginning to industrialization and gave thecountry a first experience of a
modern economy outside the oil sector.
THE IRANIAN ECONOMY IN THE TIME OF MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH
It may beargued that Iranian domestic economic policies under Muhammad
Riza Shah were formulated in large degree to achieve both internal and external
political objectives. In particular, economic and related social developments in
the years after 1947 were intended increasingly to separate the supporters of the
young Shah from the conservative elements ofthe population, including the
nationalists, who saw the main economic task as the removal of British and other
foreign control from the oil industry, and the religious classes, who feared that
modernization of the economy would undermine thestrength of Islam.18
During the period ofthe fifteenth Majlis, aproposed seven year development
plan and legislation enabling the establishment ofa Plan Commission, which
became the Plan Organisation, served to divide the two sides, the Shah gather

THE TIME OF MUHAMMAD RIZA SHAH
ing around himself those who saw salvation of the country in speedy economic
transformation. From the early 1960s the regime sought to improve its political
standing by generating support from the masses through improving standards
of living and the provision of greater welfare benefits. Increasing national
prosperity also enabled the Shah to enhance his regional strength and pay for a
growing military machine. Itmight be suggested, too, that the Shah justified the
concentration ofpolitical power in his own hands during the late 1960s and
1970s on thegrounds that such a system permitted a rapid and successful
expansion of economic activity.19 Economic growth certainly allowed the
regime toprovide opportunities for economic gain and positions ofwell-paid
authority for the middle classes, and assisted in the process of co-option of those
who otherwise might have been the government's most intelligent critics.20
It may be said that the Shah succeeded in restraining political opposition to
his rule for as long as the economic condition of the people showed demonstra
ble improvement year by year and there remained scope for entrepreneurs and
others to find satisfactions as available resources increased. The years 1964to
1973 outstandingly exemplified this. Comparative political quiescence was the
concomitant of prosperity. After the considerable increase in oil revenues from
October 1973, the linkages between the economic and political policies ofthe
government were eroded and had ceased to exist by the Iranian year 1977—8. It is
notable that within two years ofthat date the Shah's regime had fallen. Other
powerful forces were at work in thesituation, butit is significant though
negative evidence that there was close correlation between economic distress
and political unrest between 1977 and 1979.
Part of the Shah's motivation in economic policy arose from understandable
but often underrated humanitarian and nationalist sentiments. In 1945 the
ambassador of the United States of America in Tehran reported that the Shah is
"deeply distressed over poverty anddisease among his people, their low
standard of living and bad working conditions".21 The Shah refused, with
apparent sincerity, tobe crowned as ruler of the country for twenty years after
his accession since hehad nowish to bemonarch of a backward state. His
devotion to economic change brought with it high costs forIran. In what
remained throughout his reign an oil-based economy, growth was purchased
mainly through expanding oil revenues, themselves largely a function of
increased volumes of oil exports. Not only did this result inwithdrawal of the

nation's clearly finite oil reserves atan accelerated rate, but itmeant continuing
dependence onforeign markets together with reliance onforeign technology,
high levels of imports andtheceding of appreciable control over domestic
economic policies to foreign interests.22
Possibly the most pronounced characteristic ofthe Iranian economy since
1941 was itstendency towards cyclical patterns ofgrowth and decline, often
with great frequency. Among theeffects of the Second World War and the
occupation ofIran bythe Allies was destruction ofthe embryonic industries
created by Riza Shah, the loss of control of the economy by the Iranian
government, severe price inflation, andaccelerating migration of rural peopleto
the towns. Aminor recovery inthe situation after the end ofthe war was cut
short bytheintervention of the Anglo-Iranian oilcrisis. A short period of
growth inthe economy between 1955 and i960 ended inthe onset offinancial
disorder andthe imposition of an economic stabilization programme from i960
to 1963. Thereafter, a slow return to economic health, that ran until 1973in an
ultimate peaking of the economy, wasended by a hiatus in theoil boom, and the
recession that affected theeconomy adversely from 1976.
But while the period ofrule ofMuhammad Riza Shah wassubject tocyclical
effects of growth andrecession, it also experienced what appeared to be a
magnification ofthe swing between the two,especially after 1964. There was a
political cost to the movement ofthe economy from high rates ofgrowth to
periods ofsevere depression. The ordinary people became increasingly affected
by changes inthe economic situation. They benefitted more and suffered more
from thegreater amplification of trends towards boom andslump. There is
some evidence that thepopulation, especially that element of it in thetowns,was
unable andeven unwilling to bear thestrain of uneven andunpredictable
changes intheir economic fortunes arising from what increasingly was inter
preted asinept management bythegovernment, particularly after 1976.
STRATEGIES FOR DEVELOPMENT 1941-79
Iran began its first stumbling attempts atnational economic planning inthe late
1940s.23 Atthat time thecountry had access to credits accumulated with the
Allies during the war and was hopeful that the USAwould bewilling tomake
22 Katouzian, p. 324. In reality Iranian perceptions of the degree of control wielded byoverseas interests were exaggerated. Foreign investment averaged only $65 million perannum in the period 1972/3-1977/8 and it may be argued that Iranian problems sprang more from too little than too much foreign involvement in modern industry. 23 In July 1947 Morrison-Knudsen submitted a report oneconomic development to theIranian government. This wasfollowed bya full economic study byOverseas Consultants Inc., in 1948-9, which in large measure became the basis for the first seven-year plan.

STRATEGIES FOR DEVELOPMENT, 1941-79
available generous volumes of economic aid. The Iranian ruling classes were not
united ina belief that economic development was the first priority ofthe state.
Policies ofthe strongly nationalist groups inthe National Front together with
albeit uncertain support from the extremist factions ofthe right and left, were
directed towards liberation ofthe Iranian oil industry from the control of the
British. Other considerations were secondary and, in consequence, the young
Shah's plans for rapid economic change within Iran were frustrated and brought
to ahalt in the Anglo-Iranian oil crisis of 1951. Dr Musaddiq and his colleagues
in the National Front, while offering a radical economic programme in their
policies, attempted little and achieved even less in practice.
The return torule by the Shah after the overthrow of Dr Musaddiq brought
with it a renewed measure of US support for theIranian economy. A new
economic plan was formulated and launched with US assistance. The main
elements ofthe plan were construction ofwhat were then large multipurpose
projects such as the dam schemes atKaraj, and on the rivers Diz and Safid Rud,
which had thepolitical advantage of being highly visible even though they
carried economic disadvantages, absorbing the bulk of financial resources
available to the government. Privately sponsored industrial developments made
appreciable progress in this same period and were directed towards factories
making consumer goods for local markets, particularly Tehran.
Oil revenues accruing toIran grew rapidly inthe period 1954—60 as the new
oil consortium in the south sought to recover ground lost during the Anglo
Iranian dispute. The rate ofeconomic expansion proved tobe greater than the
immature infrastructure could stand. In consequence, inflation affected the
economy with growing severity. Atthe same time, the flow ofaid funds from
the USA began to fall off and the government found itself short offinancein
view ofthe commitments toeconomic development and defence expenditures
already made. As thegovernment's problems became apparent, the private
sector suffered a loss ofconfidence and few immediate benefits were purchased
by the large-scale water resources projects, none ofwhich were yet in usefor
productive purposes. In i960 there was need for economic retrenchment,
enforced bythe International Monetary Fund in return for financial backing,
which brought the economy to virtual stagnation until early 1964. The country
had proved unable toadjust the rate of economic growth to the creation ofreal
domestic resources,24 a situation that recurred several times later, without the
24 Penrose, Iraq, p. 479. Professor E.T. Penrose makes the point that "fundamental weaknesses remained . . . The constraint on the size ofthe plan was clearly the money expected tobe available rather than the rate atwhich available real resources could be effectively organized in production." For Iran, inmuch the same position during the 1950s as that described for Iraq atalater date, the gap between stated objectives and theavailability of resources to effect them was toolarge to
overcome.

government having learned any lessons from it.The most disastrous manifes
tation of the problem occurred after 1973 andthe inflow of increased oil
revenues following the oilprice increments of 1973 and1974.
Events from 1964-5 indicated that Iran had great powers ofrecovery. They
also proved that the country was capable of sustaining a steady course of
economic development, since progress in this area went on until 1973. The great
period of economic expansion after 1964 covered two plans, thethird plan
(1963—8) and the fourth plan (1968—73). In fact, the plans themselves were in
many ways less important than a parallel range of objectives set for the economy
by the Shah's "White Revolution", especially in the mid 1960s when the six
point reform programme had adeep impact on both the economy and societyin
Iran. Additionally there were many projects for the economy that were arranged
outside the formal framework of the economic plans in aseries of adhoc schemes
that began with the deal with the USSR, signed in 1965, and which persuaded
the government that the state had tobe the innovator for projects developing
the heavy industrial base if rapid change was to beachieved. Some successes
were also scored in encouraging private sector involvement in development,
mainly through provision of cheap and plentiful credits.
The strategy of the government under the influence, among others, of those
at the head of the Ministry of Economy, became to pursue economic growth as
rapidly as possible, with the sole caveat that each project fitted within the
priorities of the national plan. Anumber of those in power were strongly of the
belief that Iran had to accept its opportunities to industrialize unreservedly
while it had the chance todo so. For much of the period, however, there wasa
degree of constraint placed on the speed of development, since the availability of
funds was linked to sales of oil in a competitive international market and external
financial credits were forthcoming from suppliers only after cautious assessment
of each project. Given this inhibition onthe pace ofdevelopment, the human
resources and physical infrastructure were improved tocarry added burdens of
growth more or less in line with the rate of economic change.
Strategies adopted in the 1964—73 period were largely successful. Basic
industries were built up and the private sector followed with the establishment
of new factories. Development activities spread to most regions of the country.
Banking, insurance and commercial services became important features ofthe
main urban settlements. Only agriculture lagged seriously behind changes
elsewhere. In agriculture there was no sustained strategy, only a series of
ministers often without a grasp of the real needs of the sector. Confidence
waned, labour moved away from agricultural employment and production was

NATIONAL INCOME, 1941-79
virtually stagnant. Growing needs for imports of food and agricultural raw
materials were apparent. Despite this problem area ofthe economy, the govern
ment was able to stimulate growth ofnational income and per capita incomes in
a way that had noprecedent inIran. By 1973, Iran was industrializing rapidly,
had few problems with domestic price inflation, enjoyed great economic
confidence and hadreasonable prospects of becoming an economy mature
enough to exist in some prosperity even after oilexports ended.
The strategy of the years 1964—73 was sustained after the boom in oil
revenues at the end ofthat year. Unfortunately, government spending on other
areas was also expanded almost without constraint. What hadbeen anappro
priate policy under conditions of relative capital scarcity became disastrous in a
situation ofcapital abundance. Government attempts toadjust economic strate
gies after 1973 brought intheir wake hyperinflation, overheating ofthe econ
omy and failure of an overburdened infrastructure.
An attempt bytheAmuzgar (Amouzegar) government in 1978 to stabilize
the economy came too late. By this time, itwas known that atleast two yearsof
economic retrenchment were needed before incomes and employment could be
expanded. Intheevent, theregime was simply unable tohold itsline against a
nation whose aspirations had been raised, whose social structure had been much
damaged and which wassuffering from economic distress among its poorer
groups. Economic concessions tothepopulation by way ofwage increases in
1978 were inadequate to save the situation and tended to worsen economic
problems rather than improve them.
NATIONAL INCOME 1941—79
Performance of national income is poorly documented and is especially
unreliable inthe period before 1962. Itisaccepted however, that the years ofthe
Second World War brought a sharp decline inGross National Product in real
terms. Bharier estimated that gross domestic fixed capital formation dropped
from Rs. 10,000 million in 1941to 8,900 million in 1944.25 Thesituation
recovered after 1945 but a further period of stagnation affected the economy
during theyears 1951—3. Capital formation between 1954 and 1959 was strong
(Table 1),the total for 1959 rising to Rs.76,800 million. Asthe recession in
economic life setin towards the close of the 1950s, the rate of fixed capital
formation declined.

The decade 1964 to 1973 witnessed a consistent expansion ofthe economy
without parallel incontemporary Iranian history. By the end ofthe period Iran
was not among the ranks ofstates with highly developed economies, but it had
moved perceptibly along the road towards that objective. Itstructural terms, in
1973 the country was quite different from what ithad been in 1964. In particular,
the agricultural sector declined appreciably asother activities grew in impor
tance, especially the industrial and services sectors. Absolute and comparative
changes inthe contributions toGross Domestic Product are shown inTable3.
Even under relatively stable economic management during this period,the
country was experiencing difficulties inmaintaining growth inits main produc
tive sectors — agriculture andindustry — adequate to offset rapid growth in
services andpetroleum. It would bedifficult to argue thecase that Iranwas
anything other than an oil-based economy in 1972/3, though its efforts to
develop non-oil resources had kept the country from becoming wholly domi
nated by exports ofone commodity. Within the Middle East, Iran was moving

towards parity with Egypt and Turkey in ownership of industrial capacity and,
of the Gulf oil exporting states, had been most successful in creating alternative
productive assets.
Growth rates in the economy attained over the decade to 1972/3 were high
(Table 3.3). Gross National Product grew on average by 9.5 % annually in the
period 1963/4 to 1967/8, rising to 11.8 per cent in the five years to March 1973.
Agriculture performed badly, partly for structural reasons associated with

agriculture world wide, but also as aresult of inconsistent government policies.
The official figures of 3.4 per cent annual average change for 1963/4-1967/8 and
3.9 per cent for 1968/9—1972/3 rather overstate real advances inagriculture.27
Other areas of the economy performed well over the decade, giving some
encouragement to the view that afuture economy less rather than more reliant
on petroleum exports was feasible in Iran.
Patterns of change noted above were reflected in rising personal incomes for
many Iranians. Calculations indicate that per capita income rose from approxi
mately $130 in 1959/60 to$180 in 1963, thereafter going up to$265 i n 1968.28
Estimates of income per head in 1972/3 vary according tosource, though the
Central Bank put the average at$566, more than four times the level ten years
earlier.29 There was maldistribution of income between the richer urban areas,
especially Tehran, and poorer rural areas, arising from an increasing imbalance
between agricultural wages and wages paid in other sectors. While itis true that
a number of politically influential families were enhancing their financial
positions, itis afact that the mass of Iranians, including aproportion at village
level, experienced improving living standards.
Distinct discontinuity occurred in thestructure of and growth rate in
national income after 1973, occasioned by arapid rise in oil revenues following
the Arab-Israeli war of1973. So rapid was growth of the oil sector and services
closely related to it, that petroleum came to dominate the Iranian economy. This
exaggerated the adverse features of the economic structure previously present
and negated any positive aspects that might have existed. Expenditures by the
government advanced at so brisk apace that growth was principally stimulated
by theoil sector and it virtually ceased to reflect trends elsewhere in the
economy. Estimates ofchange innational income are shown in Table 4.
As a consequence of events after 1973, agriculture became all but eclipsed as a
contributor to Gross Domestic Product. By 1977/8 itrepresented less than ten
per cent of the total. Industry performed a little better, with the group as a whole
returning about 20% participation in GDP by 1977/8. Manufacturing industry,
which had added 16.1% toGDP in 1972/3 dropped to 13.1% by1977/8. The
productive sectors ofthe economy provided only a quarter oftotal domestic
goods and commercial services by 1977/8, bywhich time the economy had
become more oil dependent than at any previous time.
Significantly, despite very high growth rates in the economy during the years
following the oil boom of 1973, performance at some 6.9% average change over

the five-year period was poor compared with that experienced inthepreceding
decade. National accounts data suggest that uncontrolled rates of expenditure
by the state anderratic performance of the Iranian economy during the mid
1970s contrasted unfavourably with theconsistency ofthe earlier plan periods.
Although growth until 1972 hadbeen achieved without accompanying trends
towards increasing inflation, after that time inflation became serious and
damaging. Official statistics (Table 5)tend to under-state this situation.30
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES I94I—9
After World War IIthe first steps were made tochange the situation inwhich oil
revenues made little impact on theeconomic development of the country.
Before 1945 income onaccount ofoil was channelled todefence and ordinary
budgets. During the reign of Riza Shah the need andscope available for
productive investment had been perceived butonly modest successes had been
achieved. During the political turmoil ofthe post-war years, there was a change
in government approaches tooilrevenues, brought onbygrowing nationalism
and resentment offoreign exploitation. Gradually, also, it was appreciated that
petroleum andnatural gaswere diminishing resources. Theoilindustrywas
nationalized in 1951 but, once political order hadbeen restored following the
Anglo-Iranian oildispute which arose from nationalization, governments in
creasingly addressed themselves to using oil revenues to create productive
capacity insectors other than oil. The vehicle utilized for translating oilreceipts
to usein the domestic economy wasnational economic planning.

Formal economic planning was facilitated by thenature ofthe Iranianoil
industry, which was export-oriented and which earned taxes and royalties that
accrued into the hands of the state. The government, therefore, carried
responsibility for allocation ofoil receipts for thenational benefit andcould
dictate that funds be allocated to investment rather than to consumption.
Particularly from 1956, after which oil revenues began to flow in on alarge scale,
the government ofIran found itconvenient and necessary to spread benefits of
oil income among thepopulation through planned development.31 Hence,
analysis ofdevelopment inthe years 1941-79 ismainly areview ofthe achieve
ments or failures of successive administrations informulating and implement
ing budgets andprogrammes of the plan. Iranian policies towards economic and
social development canbe understood only within thecontext ofthe Shah's
political requirements formaximization of economic growth, as a means of
vindicating the gathering of effective political power into his own hands andthe
exclusion ofall others from positions ofreal authority. The role chosen for the
formal organization ofthe plan by the Shah varied from time totime,32 though
the broad guidelines ofthe plans tended, even ifincompletely, toprevail during
the period to 1973.
THE ECONOMIC PLANS
The first seven-year development plan was begun in 1949. The plan was
originally prepared by the American company Morrison-Knudsen in 1947but it
was modified byOverseas Consultants Inc. before being officially accepted by
the Majlis in 1949.Expenditures under the plan were set atatotal ofRs. 26,300
million ($350million) gross orRs.21,000 million ($280 million) net. These were

to be financed by oil revenues and loans from Bank Melli and the World Bank
(IBRD). Government factories and mines were transferred to anew agency that
was set up tomanage the plan (Plan Organization). Inthe event, the planning
processes had been begun but few projects put in hand by 1951, from which time
political crisis terminated allocation of funds forthe plan.
After settlement of the dispute with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company,the
work of the Plan Organization was resumed with an interim plan, followed bya
second seven-year plan ending inSeptember 1962. Atotal of Rs.70,000 million
($935 million) was allotted to the plan, a sum increased to Rs.84,000 million
($1,120 million) in 1956. The second plan was similar in many ways tothe first.
There were no quantitative growth targets and itprovided for the public sector
only. Funds were drawn from oil revenues, IBRD loans and domestic credit.
The plan did make a contribution toeconomic development and stimulated a
degree of private sector industrial development. Unfortunately, the rapid
growth which characterized the period resulted in balance of payments difficul
ties and price inflation. This situation was corrected by imposition ofa severe
economic stabilization programme, which itself undermined confidence in the
private sector and helped to bring ona general economic recession.
Specialists from Harvard University, financed by the Ford Foundation, were
recruited toassist formulation ofa third plan. This new plan was comprehen
sive, covering both public and private sectors. It provided forpublic sector
investments of Rs. 191,000 million ($2,500 million) andRs. 141,000 million
($ 1,900 million) for the private sector in the period 1963—8. Disbursements were
Rs. 230,000 million, priority being given to transport and communications with
26% of funds spent, agriculture with 23% and fuel/power with 16%. Despite a
slow beginning made tothe plan, with almost two and a half years affected by
recession, allocations were later raised considerably and 89% of forecast expen
ditures were made (Table6).
Major projects begun under the second plan were the reservoir dams on the
Karaj, Diz and Safid Rud rivers, which dominated the construction programme
in the plan and were not completed by the end of the period. A number of other
projects, mostly in industry, were postponed and retained forthe succeeding
plan period.
The fourth plan began in an atmosphere of optimism in view of the success of
the third plan anda promise of rising oil revenues.33 It was forecast that
allocations of government funds todevelopment would be concentrated inthe

years 1968/9 to 1972/3, with emphasis on development of infrastructure and
industry. Aspecial role wasforeseen for the private sector in industrial develop
ment, which increasingly emerged as one of the most favoured areas. Oil
revenues rose more quickly than forecast and funds available to the plan were
augmented. The completion ofmajor irrigation projects begun earlier and the
inception of new schemes in industry, including the Isfahan steel mill, a
petrochemical unit, anautomobile assembly plant and an aluminium smelter,
generated amood of growing confidence in the capability of the regime, bothat
home and abroad. The relative balance between sectors and aclose if coinciden
tal correlation between the pace ofeconomic expansion and the training of the
workforce, provision ofinputs such aswater and power, and development of
the Civil Service resulted insteadily accelerating rates of change without undue
price inflation orsocial disruption. The fourth plan was an economic threshold
in other ways: the government took over the leading role asinvestor from the
private sector. From more than 70% in i960 and 55% in 1966, theshare of
private sector investment dropped to less than 45% during thefourth plan
period.
Stress onagricultural development ofthe country, which had characterized
earlier development plans, was replaced bypreoccupation with industry and
construction of infrastructure designed to support industrial expansion.
In balance, mode ofexecution and results, the fourth plan was one of great

achievement. None theless, the rush to development was perceptibly losing
momentum by 1972.34 Newand significant projects were no longer being
brought forward. Inflation was rising in urban areas to embarrassing propor
tions.35 Pressure on labour supplies was pushing up wage rates rapidly. More
importantly, theShah, having achieved some economic gains, was tending to
turn his attention away from the problems ofthe economy tooil affairs, foreign
policy anddefence. In 1973, when themost critical of decisions affecting the
economy were made, he appeared to be lacking in interest in this area.
Iran's economic development programmes were devised by the Plan Organi
zation. It suffered adecrease inpolitical authority during the late 1960s, and was
thereafter often ignored by the ruler and his ministers. Economic planning had
an especially uneasy history since the Shah had his own views onthe role of the
national economy and altogether disregarded the plan where it conflicted with
his programmes. It isalso atruism ofthe years after 1954,and particularly from
1964, that plans and their rates ofeconomic change were dictated by changes in
the flow of oil revenues. That theoverall trend in oil revenues was upwards
could be tolerated by the economy since, prior to 1973, all increases in oil
revenues were on a relatively modest scale.
Directions inthe course ofeconomic change inthe period after 1962/3 were
determined not only by the economic plans but by the Shah's reform pro
gramme —the Inqilab-i Safid ("White Revolution")36 - which became the
guideline for thecabinet under MrHuvaida. In effect, thethird development
plan, 1963—8, was put aside to make way forthe land reform. The fourth plan,
too, was modified over its course by the growing list ofitems within the Shah's
programme.
A first and significant step by the Shah to impose his ownwill on the
economy came in 1962 when land reform was promulgated. After an uncertain
beginning, the Shah took over the land reform as ameans of political reform that
allowed him totake power from the landlord class while mobilizing supportfor
himself in rural areas. In 1963 the Shah made useof the success of the land
reform, which hadcreated a positive impact abroad, by adding five further
points to hisprogramme — workers' profit-sharing, nationalization of forests
and pastures, creation of a literacy corps, sale of state-owned factories, and
enfranchisement ofwomen. The reforms affected the heart ofIranian economic
and social life. They were seen as so significant that sacrifice ofthe supremacyof

THE ECONOMIC PLANS
the plan was totally justified by the results of the programme. The reform was
later extended and took in a number of points which were less basic, even
irrelevant to ordinary Iranians, and the reform became much devalued.
By the late 1960s the regime appeared content that it had done enough to
provide for continuing economic development. The Shah engaged himself in
vital areas of petroleum and,with greater dedication, defence. Expenditures on
defence rose markedly after 1968. Budgeted allocations to defence rose to $1,18 5
million in 1972/3, excluding parts ofthe transport/communications andcon
struction budgets that were in support ofthe defence sector but not directly
attributed to it.
At the beginning of the fifth plan, 1973/4 to 1977/8, it seemed that Iran was
well placed for thecontinuation of the successful industrialization of the
preceding plan period.37 Existing rates of growth in the economy were already
high. Commitment to major newindustrial schemes hadbeen made and, in some
cases, construction had begun. The Shah's personal espousal of the industrial
ization drive, marked by signature ofthe agreement with the USSR in 1965,
appeared asif it would begin to yield results during the 1970s. There were
continuing problems affecting agriculture, but it was felt that reform ofland
ownership having been achieved and appropriate institutions for dealing with
credit andagricultural extension having been established, thesector would settle
down to a productive and regular pattern of development.
The fifth plan became synonymous with economic failure, despite the
optimism that surrounded its inception. The original version of the plan, while
not without faults in respect of blindness to economic problems appearing atthe
close of the fourth plan period anddisregard of worsening social problems, was
a rational approach to sustaining thepace of change and systematically strength
ening the productive sectors.38 Overall growth targets set at 15.4% average per
year for Gross Domestic Product were designed to lift GDPto $36,400 million
by the end of the period. The pattern of expansion confirmed the direction of
change setearlier. Industry andmining were expected to average a rate of 15.3 %
and agriculture, with misplaced hopefulness, 5.5%.Oil was expected to givea
growth rate averaging 11.8%during the five-year period.
Structural changes expected to come from the scheme of investment outlined
above were continuations of established trends. Oilandservices were forecast to
stay dominant inthe economy, contributing 38.0 and 26.3%, respectively, to
Gross Domestic Product by 1978. Industry at23.2% and agriculture at 12.5%

both retained some importance. The plan objectives included keeping inflation
at anaverage of about 4% annually.
The philosophy of the Shah and his senior ministers, strengthened by
successes in the fourth plan, was that the tide of opportunity for development of
those areas of the economy other than oil had to be taken at the flood. There was
a conviction that chances for sustained and controlled development might not
appear again before oil exports began to fall as reserves became depleted.
Pressing Iran's advantages during the fourth plan worked well and it was taken
for granted that the process could be continued despite the emergence of
noticeable political dissent from conservatives on the right and radicals onthe
left, andregardless of the necessity to reduce flows of resources to welfare
schemes. The balance in financial allocations of the original fifth plan leaned
towards the economic sectors, with some 62% of allocations of a total of $22,700
million dedicated to them. Welfare, including health education, received only
30% offunds, ofwhich half went toeducation and much ofthe remainder to
housing. It was stressed when the plan was published in 1973 that theShah
wished forlarger allotments to welfare. In the event, financial resources were
not toremain so constrained as originally thought and, atthe first opportunity,
the government increased allocations to the social sectors with quite different
results from those expected or wanted.
Among difficulties that the fifth plan bore against was a concentration of
development inthe petroleum and industrial sectors on asmall number oflarge
projects. Large resources were committed to the Trans-Iranian Gas Pipeline and
to projects for treating and exporting natural gas. Some $1,900 million was
claimed by these items. Development of petrochemicals was an extension of the
planning strategy ofupgrading exports of processed hydrocarbons. By the end
of the fourth plan Iran had oneof the most sophisticated petrochemicals
industries in the Middle East with major complexes at Bandar Shahpur, Abadan,
Shlraz and Kharg Island. The fifth plan saw expansion of existing units and the
creation of new large plants by the state, contracts for most of which were either
already signed or nearing completion.
Elsewhere, completion of the steel mill close to Isfahan, establishment of
three iron and steel plants in the south, expansion of the automobile industry and
the opening up of Sar Chashma copper field and its facilities absorbed large
proportions of available financial resources.
The aggregate effect of these major projects in industry and petroleum wasto
localize the impact of state investment and to reduce scope forschemes other
than small-scale plants handled bythe private sector. Constraints imposed by
628

THE ECONOMIC PLANS
this strategy adopted bythe planners and the dominance ofmajor projects arose
partly through limitations on finance, but there was the advantage that short
ages offunds tended torestrain implementation ofinessential schemes and toact
as an automatic regulator, keeping development in approximate step with
availability of resources such as labour and elements of physical infrastructure.
The view ofthe planners atthe beginning ofthe fifth plan period appeared to be
that employment-creation was a principal function of growth. It was necessary
to create approximately 760,000 new industrial jobs during theplan, to inhibit
growth of unemployment in the cities.
Whereas thestrategies which were adopted in thefifth plan by the govern
ment for oil,petrochemicals, natural gas andindustry were consistent with a
serious philosophy for economic development, the same could not be said for
agriculture. The original land reform39 programme did much to improve
conditions for rural peoples. Later extension of the reform, to include amalga
mation of traditional villages into single units and establishment of capital
intensive agro-industries, destroyed most of the earlier gains of the reform.40
The lessons of low growth rates in agriculture during the fourth plan period
were not learned andthe fifth plan formalized continuing structural change in
rural areas, designed to bring agriculture under direct state control. Large farm
units were to beset upduring the fifth plan and were to receive credits of$3,900
million andinvestment of $2,200 million. Worse, theplan also provided for a
channelling of state funds from education, housing and health budgets intonot
more than 8,000 rural development poles at the expense ofall settlements ofless
than 250 persons, which were to receive negligible investments, and other rural
centres, which were to suffer much reduced financial allocations. State-runco
operatives or farm corporations were to take in 900,000 hectares of traditional
farmland, while agro-industries were expected to absorb 400,000 hectares. The
effects of these policies were to reduce the confidence of private farmers,
particularly of smaller farmers in traditionally cultivated areas, and to accelerate
movement offthe land by the younger generation. Under the original text ofthe
fifth plan, the programme for concentrating rural populations and increasing
productivity might have worked, and a deliberate inducement of movement to
urban districts might have been of benefit to industry asa cheap and increasing
labour force. In theevent, conscious uprooting of the rural population was to
lay thefoundations for an economic andsocial tragedy in theperiod of the oil
boom beginning in late 1973.41

THE ECONOMIC PLANS
The fifth plan as originally proposed (Table 7) offered theIranian govern
ment severe problems inits implementation. Real resources were scarce. Trans
port, banking and civil service infrastructures were inadequate to support the
ambitious expansion of the economy proposed under its $20,600 million invest
ment programme. Senior members of the Ministry of Finance and Economy,
Bank Markazi and cabinet were aware that the country was pressing ahead with
development toorapidly for economic and political comfort. Whether views
dissenting from those ofthe disciples ofsuch men as Mr Ansari, the Ministerof
Finance and Economy, were allowed to filter to the Shah is not documented. It is
unlikely, in view of the increasingly authoritarian spirit then pervading the
court, that serious objections were raised in the Shah's presence to the signifi
cant risks involved in theoriginal fifth plan proposals.
In the wake of the 1973 Arab—Israeli war, oil prices rose rapidly, leading toan
immediate and appreciable increase in oilrevenues received byIran. Revenue
assumptions of the fifth plan were made redundant, andthe $22,050 million
expected onoil account over the five-year period were received in less than the
first two years ofthe plan. Revenues from oil in 1973/4 ran at $5,066.6 million.
They rose inthe following year to$18,670.8 million. The Huvaida cabinet held
to theoriginal plan for only a short time once oil revenues began to rise. A
revised plan was declared on 3August 1974, inwhich budget allocations to the
plan were raised by 279% to$122,800 million and the forecast rate ofgrowth in
national income was raised to 25.9%.42 Table 7 indicates the degree ofchangein
the revised plan against the original proposals of 1973. Only oil revenues
showed real change. O nthe expenditure side, increases were scheduled for all
sectors. Total fixed investment was set at$42,200 million under the terms ofthe
revised plan, ofwhich social affairs took the largest share with $19,060 million,
followed by industry and mines with $12,5 39 million. Agriculture was felt to be
incapable of absorbing very much larger funds and was allocated only $4,582
million.
In effect the Shah and the government decided to retain a "big-push"
philosophy,43 that had served sowell in the preceding period, and to press on
with development regardless ofapparent economic and social strains. This was
done despite knowledge that the scale of development expenditures was far
greater than in the past and that human and other resources would have been
stretched to the utmost even under the original plan. The country was already
feeling the effects of social dislocation and inflation. In such circumstances the

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, 1921-79
revised fifth plan waseconomically indefensible. Given that the Shah authorized
simultaneous increases in welfare budgets, spending on defence and augmented
expenditures on government current account, the scene was set for a scale of
demand on goods and services which the domestic economy could not supply,
and which could not be met from abroad as a consequence of Iran's limited port
and transport facilities. In planning terms, the government failed to appreciate
that the "big-push" strategy was appropriate in conditions where capital wasin
short supply and where constraints arising from limited fund availability kept
growth generally in step with the supply of supporting resources. This strategy
ceased to be relevant once capital became abundant, since then spending could
run ahead of provision of other assets and create unbridgeable imbalances
between demand for and supply of resources.
The Shah must take much ofthe blame foreconomic events after 1973,
together with Iranians and foreigners who flattered Iran bysupporting an
expanding scale of state spending and byconfirming the mischievous and
mistaken view that Iran was rich in resources and talent.44 The problem was one
not of planning strategy, but of total economic indiscipline. Provisions of the
revised fifth plan were abandoned almost completely. Expenditures were in
creasingly undertaken outside the framework of the plan as the Shah apparently
came to believe that he could transform Iran into astate economically the equal
of countries of Western Europe, and could encourage a resurgence of Iranian
civilization.45 Political hegemony in the Persian Gulf and an important role in
the international arena were tobe parallel aspirations inthis grand plan.
The hastily revised fifth plan took over the major projects of the original but
catered for an accelerated pace of implementation. In the atmosphere of expan
sion of 1974 and 1975, new schemes were added to the development pro
gramme, often through the conclusion of bilateral trade agreements with those
industrialized states eager to gain access to oil supplies in return for foodstuffs,
materials and equipment.46 These agreements had the effect ofraising import
levels of consumer goods and of materials for aseries of large-scale projects in
petrochemicals, nuclear power, and iron and steel. Many of the projects didnot
materialize and those that did competed for scarce resources and helped to push
up wages and prices. It would appear that adoption of grandiose new schemes by
the government served to delay completion of projects already in hand and put
up the costs of both. In aggregate, the government achieved little more after the
oil boom than it would have done under the original fifth plan, but at enor

mously inflated economic and social costs. By the close of the fifth plan period
not one new additional petrochemical plant, steel mill or nuclear power station
had been completed. The same was true of most projects for industry that were
begun or contracted for atthe end ofthe fourth plan.
Expansion affected private industry in the same way. A scramble for profit
able development was setin train byrapid growth in disposable income.
Established industrial groups such as Behshahr and Iran National increased the
scale of their activities and diversified into new fields. Smaller businesses
proliferated, aided by generous credits from the banking system and support
from foreign suppliers anxious to secure ashare of the Iranian market. Official
statistics became less reliable after 1973, though it is apparent that private
enterprise was encouraged to compete forscarce resources mainly by state
agencies in the licensing and credit fields.47 Credits allotted to private industry
and mining inthe period 1970—8 by the major banks are given inTable 8.
What was true ofindustry was true of the economy as awhole. Growth in
public expenditures was astimulus for rapid expansion in domestic demandin
the years 1973/4 and 1974/5. The private sector was relatively quiescent in this
period in the field of investment, but by 1975/6 itlaunched itself headlong into
industrial investment.48 Results of the awakening of the private sector included

prolongation ofthe period ofboom, since thegovernment, which had rapidly
expanded its consumption in 1973/4 and 1974/5, cut back its demands on
resources in 1975/6 only topermit the private sector totake over and provide a
renewed push to growth (Table 9). Private demand rose by 45% in 1975/6
against 37%in 1974/5 and11% in 1972/73 at constant prices.
The flow ofoil revenues failed tolive uptoexpectations. Receipts of foreign
exchange on account of oil exports rose only gradually, standing at $19,074
million in 1975/6, $20,671 million in 1976/7 and$20,926 million in 1977/8.
Revenues from exports ofcrude oilandnatural gasfortheperiod ofthe fifth

million. Worse, thevalue of revenues wasmuch reduced by theeffects of
inflation ofprices ofimported goods. The adverse trend inthe terms oftradefor

THE ECONOMIC PLANS
The combination offalling real oil revenues and worsening price inflation,
though particularly the former, persuaded the government tointroduce mea
sures to reduce thegrowth rate. Government consumption was curtailed.
Growth in 1975/6 was held at 15% against 47% in the preceding year. In 1976/7
the figure dropped to 8%. Government construction activity was not so easily
cut back, peaking ata growth rate of 57% in 1975/6 but remaining at 12%in
1976/7. The latter year saw an,albeit belated, attempt to restrain private
activities with imposition of ceilings on bank advances and increases in the bank
rate. The impact of these measures was slow to show itself and increases in
interest rates and limitations on building licences were necessary in 1977/8,to
reduce domestic demand.
With ill-advised optimism, the government stepped up its own expenditures
just as private sector activities seemed tobe coming under control. In 1977/8
government fixed investment rose by almost 8% inreal terms (24% at current
prices). Together with the fact that measures against the private sector suc
ceeded only in reducing investment while consumption, especially in construc
tion, continued to expand (by 15 and 7%, respectively), the financial position of
the country deteriorated. Public sector dependence on thebanking system
increased by some 30%. Inflation worsened. Wage rates, even in modern sector
industry, began to fall behind the level of prices. Shortages of electricity, water
supply, labour, some foodstuffs, cement and other inputs tothe construction
industry became markedly worse. Overall growth in national income fell to
3.1% in real terms in 1977/8 after many years of sustained high level expansion.
The country sustained its balance of payments position only by resort to
expensive short-term borrowing abroad.
From 1975/6, when the economy first showed signs of malabsorption of
capital inputs and imbalances between supply and demand, until the end of the
plan period, the government appeared unable orunwilling tomake a realistic
diagnosis of the ills of the economy and use fiscal cures for the symptoms of the
problems such as it perceived only hesitantly and erratically. Application of non
fiscal measures to reduce inflation andoffset economic distress tended to
concentrate on the effects rather than causes of the problem. A campaign against
profiteering was introduced in July 1975, affecting manufacturers and thosein
the distributive trades. Rigid price control succeeded in reducing profit mar
gins, led to afall in investment in new industry in 1976/7 and 1977/8, and had an
adverse impact on theconfidence of private entrepreneurs. The campaign
brought, however, only abrief period of relief from rising prices. As a parallel
political concession to Iranians suffering erosion oftheir standards of living

through inflation, it was decreed in June 1975 that shares inprivate companies,
to aminimum of 49% for companies' equity, should be disposed of through the
Tehran Stock Exchange or sold directly to workers. Shares in anumber of state
owned concerns were similarly dealt with. Itwas hoped that aredistribution of
ownership inmodern industry would act as palliative to growing criticism that
modernization was benefitting only afew large families. Uneven application of
the law was enough toundermine support ofindustrialists for the regime, but
was not enough to stem alienation of many Iranians from the regime's policies,
as inflation undercut the existing social structure and created worsening econ
omic distress.
Inflation had resulted from the government's unrestrained pumping of funds
into the economy from early 1975. Itcompounded an already deteriorating rate
of domestic inflation and wascoincident with a severe bout of inflation
worldwide. Half-hearted fiscal controls, which were rarely applied consistently
to public and private areas ofactivity simultaneously, together with draconian
price controls, failed to ease the situation. It must berecognized that official
statistics under-stated the problem ofinflation in Iran,49 under-estimating the
acuteness ofit inthe capital and other major centres while generally ignoring
events inrural areas. High rates ofinflation were not new toIran. During the
Second World War and in the late 1950s inflation took place at destructive
levels. Yet theperiod 1963 to 1973 experienced low rates of inflation, the
consumer index rising atan annual average of 3.8 to4.0%. After 1973, though
rising prices were apparent even in 1972, inflation gained way, averaging 15.3%

THE ECONOMIC PLANS
each year between 1973 and 1978 according to IMF sources. Ifofficial figures are
to be believed, two peaks occurred in 1974/5 and in 1977/8 respectively.
Wholesale prices grew inline with the consumer price index but atlower levels
(Table 11). The degree of failure ofthe government in controlling inflation is
clearly apparent from thedata in Table11.
A death blow tothe planning process inIran came with abandonment of the
sixth plan, expected to begin in March 1978. Dr Amuzgar, who was prime
minister in 1977, suspended most of the large-scale schemes of development and
introduced aneconomic stabilization programme that began to bite deeplyby
the beginning of 1978. During the first year ofthe sixth plan anannual budget
was imposed reducing expenditures onall but vital and productive projects or
developments, such as nuclear power stations, favoured by the Shah. Even
defence expenditures were reduced, falling from $8,051 million in 1976/7 to
$7,970 million in 1977/8 (though still much greater than earlier levels such as
$1,999 million in 1973/4). As a result of measures taken by the Amuzgar
administration, inflation began toabate and the over-heating of the economy to
lessen, albeit at the expense of diminishing job opportunities and falling real
incomes.
Dr Amuzgar was inhibited from taking the economy more firmly inhand by
the unwillingness of the court to reduce itsoutgoings, especially in thefields
of defence and nuclear energy, and bythe disarray ofthe economy asa whole
after 1975. Agriculture suffered very badly from the economic boom. Ithad lost
labour on an unprecedented scale as rural peoples responded to higher wage
rates and growing job opportunities in the construction and industrial sectorsin
urban development areas. Wage rates generally moved against agriculture.
While agricultural work received a reward ofapproximately 50 per cent of the
average national wage in 1965/66, this ratio had fallen toless than 30 per cent by
1975/6. Despite official claims to thecontrary, production from agriculture
stagnated or fell after 1973as demand rose. Iranian imports of agricultural goods
rose from $142.5 million in 1968/9 to $926 million in 1974/5 andto $2,550
million in 1977/8.50 The government had little chance ofrestoring production
from agriculture in the short term and could not enforce return of rural migrants
to their villages oforigin. Inflexibilities inagriculture had their counterparts in
industry. Raw materials, spare parts and skilled labour were in short supply.
Costs ofoperation had risen rapidly while prices were artificially kept down.51

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, I92I-79
Numbers of successful capitalists, too, had been unnerved by the arbitrary
actions of the Shah against their interests in 1975 under the anti-profiteering and
share-distribution laws and, as the Iranian economy crumbled, confidence was
eroded. A flight of capital began in 1976 and there is evidence (see Table 9) that
many factory owners held back from investment and renewal of existing plant
from that year. Disruptions caused by scarcities inelectricity supply in 1976/7
and 1977/8 created further industrial chaos. By the time that Dr Amuzgar came
to need arapid expansion in domestic industrial output to save on imports, the
confidence and, in some cases, the capability were nolonger there.
In order to put the economy back on course and toreturn toan absorbable
level of growth, the Amuzgar government calculated that itneeded at least two
years of retrenchment from March 1978. The political costs ofthe economic
stabilization programme were considerable. Sustained inflation, deteriorating
real wages, falling numbers of job opportunities and worsening levels of welfare
benefits combined to create a measure ofeconomic distress that left Iranians
from all social classes disillusioned and with their aspirations in ruins. Maldistri
bution of income, and corruption (at which, itmust be said, most Iranians had
connived for years), took on moral and political significance once people were
already suffering acute economic distress, or could look forward only to
deteriorating standards of living.
The Shah had justified hisstyle of political rule by achieving economic
success. This formula worked well till 1975. As economic failures occurred,
demonstrated toall by electricity failures across the country, factories closing,
villages dying and the important basic necessities becoming difficult to find,so
his vindication of benign authoritarianism vanished. By the endof 1977,
discontent found open manifestation on the streets and inthe factories. From
early 1978 strikes and worker obstruction brought the economy of the country
into an increasingly parlous state, stimulated a flight of capital of large propor
tions, and destroyed any chance ofeconomic recovery under the established
regime. Attempts by the government tocontrol the economy ended from mid
1978. Inmany ways the government's ability tomanage it was removed as the
one critical sector of the economy, petroleum, was affected bystrikes in the
closing months of1978. By February 1979 the economic ambitions of the Shah
modernization and prosperity — were in ruins, and the economic achievement of
his reign rejected bythe mass of his countrymen.

CHAPTER I 8
THE IRANIAN OIL INDUSTRY
INTRODUCTION
The oilindustry has played a notable role in the economy of modern Iran,
especially asasource of foreign exchange and asafactor in industrial develop
ment. Itsmajor production operations have, however, been confined to the
province of Khuzistan in the south west of the country and offshore in the
Persian Gulf. Moreover, its impact upon and contribution to the domestic
economy should not be exaggerated and needs tobe related tothe context ofthe
whole national economy. As Dr All Amini, when prime minister in 1961,
reminded his countrymen "the economy ofour nation is based primarilyon
agriculture. The majority of our people are engaged in agricultural activities."
As late as 1956 theurban population constituted 30% ofthe total population
whilst that of the rural area was 70%. Twenty years later over half of the
population still lived inthe countryside. Inthe mid 1960s the agricultural sector
was still providing some 25% oftotal gross national income.
The most impressive contribution of the oil industry tothe national economy
has been since the late 1960s, especially 1967—74, when Iran was the leading
producer in theMiddle East. Production peaked in 1974 at 301.2 million tons,
doubling that of 1968 in six years, but declining thereafter byhalf to 15 8.1
million tons in 1979, a vast rise and fall in a decade (seeAppendix 1). Oil
revenues helped toaccelerate the pace of industrialization, but the fall innational
income experienced when oil revenues began todecline inthe late 1970s caused a
slowdown in industrial activity and precipitated an economic crisis. This
coincided with the damaging effects ofan inadequate infrastructure tocope with
the massive projects associated with therevised Fifth Year Plan, with serious
political consequences.

deposits were used for thecaulking of ships, the bonding of bricks and medicinal
purposes, though probably not in usefor the sacred Zoroastrian fires. In the mid
and later 19thcentury the first scientific examinations of sites were carried out by
W.K. Loftus and Jacques de Morgan.2 It was the reports ofthe latter which
aroused the interest of Antoine Kitabgi, who had been director of the Iranian
Customs Service and wasorganizer of the Persian exhibition in Paris in 1900. At
the end of that year he contacted Edouard Cotte, formerly an intermediary inthe
granting of the Reuter Concession, and Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, who had
been British minister in Tehran 1887-90.3 Drummond Wolff in turn interested
William Knox D'Arcy, an English solicitor, who had returned to London after
making afortune from the Mount Morgan mine in Queensland, Australia. The
D'Arcy Concession was thus, in origin, a speculative commercial project
promoted on the personal initiative of an Iranian to acquire British capital for
concessionary purposes.4 It was not dissimilar toearlier attempts by Malkum
Khan and others in the 1870s to promote industrial enterprise for Iran.5 Earlier
efforts by a Dutch Company, A. Hotz and Co., to search for oil near Bushire and
by the Persian Mining Bank, an offshoot of the ill-fated Reuter Concession,to
develop the mineral resources of Iran had proved unsuccessful. D'Arcy's role
was tocontribute the necessary finance and provide the appropriate technical
expertise. Kitabgi was responsible for facilitating the negotiations in Tehran.
Through his standing in court circles andhisfriendship with Amin al-Sultan,
the Persian prime minister, Kitabgi assisted D'Arcy's emissary, Alfred L.
Marriott. It wasa time of intense Anglo-Russian rivalry and by omitting the five
northern provinces from his proposed concession, D'Arcy hoped to avoid
offending Russian susceptibilities. Thenegotiations with the Shah and members
of the Council ofMinisters were protracted. Going against his initial instruc
tions, but on the advice of Kitabgi, Marriott offered some financial inducements
to the Shah and the concession was eventually signed on 26 May 1901for sixty
years inreturn for a royalty of 16% ofthe profits. The views ofthe Russian
Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs and their officials in Tehran conflicted
about the importance ofthe proposed concession. In the confusion effective
Russian opposition was not mounted until it was too late.
Within a few years the nature of the undertaking changed. Ofthe three

THE CONCESSIONARY PERIOD
Iranians who stood most togain from a successful oil discovery, Kitabgi died
before hecould dominate the operations in Iran, Amin al-Sultan was assassi
nated and Muzaffar al-DIn Shah also died. Thedifficulties of drilling, the
inhospitable countryside, the trying climatic conditions, the complete absence
of industrial resources and trained workers, the lack of communications and the
divided political responsibilities in the areas surveyed caused escalating costs
and brought about a financial crisis forD'Arcy, who had never contemplated
exploiting the concession by himself. He intended forming a syndicate to
discover oiland then float a company to undertake the work from which he
would derive dividends. After hehad spent some £250,000 and failed to find
additional capital, because of the extreme scepticism about the prospects for oil
in Iran, from American and French sources and Calouste Gulbenkian, E.G.
Pretyman, parliamentary secretary to the Admirality, suggested that D'Arcy
should seek short term financial support from the Burmah Oil Company.
Burmah was concerned tosafeguard its Indian interests in the event of oil being
found in adjacent territory.
Inevitably, this enlarged the scope ofthe venture, giving it an institutional
aspect rather than a venture ofpersonal speculation. Besides, inanarea where
the authority of the central government, which hadno effective army,was
circumscribed by theautonomy of Shaikh Khaz^al of Muhummara and the
Bakhtiyari khans, local arrangements hadto be concluded.6 When oil was
discovered at Masjid i-Sulaiman on 26 May 1908, the Burmah Oil Company,
which by then had the principal interest, created anew organization, the Anglo
Persian Oil Company (APOC). This assumed all responsibility for activities in
Iran and ithad to honour pledges to the local rulers, such as the Agreement of 15
November 1905 with the Bakhtiyari khans, without whose acquiescence, for
example over the provision ofguards, operations would have been absolutely
impossible. Later, theIranian government resented this state of affairs and
claimed that the Company was imposing itsown authority onthe country,an
allegation which recurred frequently in relations between the Government and
the Company.
In some respects the remoteness of the operations inKhuzistan, far from the
capital, was an advantage for the Company whilst it was constructing a refinery
and accompanying facilities like jetties, roads and housing, and building the 140
mile pipeline with pumping stations from the oilfield to Abadan. This wasan
extraordinary achievement, because Abadan was no more than an uninhabited

and resourceless mud flat island when it was leased from Shaikh Khazcal on 16
July 1909. Within a few years it was transformed into a self-sufficient, complex
industrial site, the creation ofa single company ina remote part ofthe country.
Not surprisingly, as the operations developed inmagnitude and importance into
one of the great industrial feats of modern times, a kind of enclave mentality
manifested itself. Inthe area involved, the monuments ofpast civilisations were
more visible than signs ofeconomic growth, especially asindustrialisation was
not part of the Iranian scene until theearly 20th century.
The newly formed Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) asserted itsentre
preneurial strength without any British government interference. Although the
various technical difficulties in commissioning the refinery caused a serious
financial crisis, the directors were adamant inpreserving their independence and
in not associating themselves with any other oil company. By offering supplies
of fuel oil ona long-term basis atfavourable prices, acontract was secured with
the Royal Navy in 1914. This self-confidence resulted in the offer by the
Company, finally accepted after two years of prolonged negotiations onthe part
of the British government, of a majority shareholding inthe company, subject to
non-involvement ofthe Government in the Company's commercial activities.7
It was a financial mariage deconvenance, not anarranged marriage, but it radically
altered the nature ofthe Company and appeared toidentify it with the activities
of the British government. Thereafter Iranian governments judged its oper
ations on political rather than commercial criteria. The Company's position was,
unfortunately, prejudiced as this relationship became thecause of a suspicion
from which noother concessionary company inthe Middle East suffered to the
same extent.
By 1919, different interpretations arose between the Iranian government
and APOC over therespective obligations andresponsibilities implicit in the
text ofthe concession, and over other developments which could not have been
envisaged in 1901. There were problems related to the protection ofthe
operations, which hadbeen interrupted anddamaged by sabotage during the
First World War, obliging APOC to claim compensation. There were also
differences over the definition of profits. There were disagreements over
activities ofthe Company which were not part ofits Persian operations, suchas
shipping and subsidiary distribution companies. These had to beconsidered in
the light ofincreasing technical change and expanding market opportunities in
which the company was involved. There were Iranian complaints about alleged

inequitable accounting practices and insufficient employment of Iranians.An
attempt to solve some of these issues was made through the mediation ofSidney
A. (later Sir) Armitage-Smith, financial adviser to the government of Mushir al
Daula, who had been selected in 1919 by Nusrat al-Daula, Prince FIruz, Foreign
Minister, when he was in London. Prince Firuz appointed Sir William
McLintock, the eminent Scottish accountant, as consultant.
It was after theassumption of power by Riza Khan, first as Minister of
Defence in 1921, then prime minister in 1923 and finally Shah after December
1925, that these issues were first brought into the open. There was no criticism
of the technical activities of APOC in exploration, production or refining. There
was, however, Iranian suspicion that APOC was opposing theextension of
central authority bysupporting Shaikh Khazcal and the Bakhtiyarl khans, to
whom certain British government officials were clearly sympathetic. The oil
company wasunderstandably grateful for their earlier protection and co
operation, but itwas not in its interest to have aweak, insecure and divided Iran,
which was unable topromote the modernization ofthe country, orto provide
the trained personnel that was needed. Wells, rigs, pipelines and installations
were vulnerable tounrest inthe countryside when the government was weak,
which had earlier been thecase. Asa senior member of the management of
APOC expressed itin 1922, "our salvation lies ina strong Central Government
. . . it is ourcommon interest to assist a proper central Government, and
gradually get rid, on the one hand, ofthe suspicion that we are out to partition
Persia, and on theother, of the belief entertained by local elements that we
should support them against any Central authority desirous of putting its house
in order".8
Sir John Cadman, Deputy Chairman and later Chairman, wished to initiatea
frank andfriendly dialogue with theIranian government after Riza Shah's
coronation inApril 1926. He hoped for anew and mutually beneficial relation
ship. International competition was increasing as rising consumer demands
stimulated theconsumption of oil products. The discovery of new areas of
production inSouth America, particularly Venezuela, and inthe United States,
expanded the supply of crude oil closer than Iran to the principal world markets.
Instead of concessional uncertainty, Cadman wanted asecure base of trust upon
which preparations could bemade for greater investment in new fields, new
refining capacity and new marketing outlets to increase both profitability and
revenue. In pursuit of this policy, at talks in Lausanne with Mirza cAbdal

Husain Timurtash, Minister of Court, in August 1928 andnegotiations in
Tehran in March and April 1929, Cadman offered the Iranian government a
remarkable shareholding partnership inthe company, by which it would have
been enabled to participate directly in the Company's commercial prosperity. He
proposed a 20% holding ofordinary shares inaddition toroyalty on tonnage,
and requested a prolongation of the duration of the concession.
It was a proposition farin advance ofits time, but the Iranian negotiators
were divided onits significance and wanted a larger immediate return on oil
production rather than trusting topotentially better future revenue prospects.
The Iranian government wanted money on current account to implement a
programme ofmodernization, which was already incurring large expenditure,
in order to obviate the need to raise foreign loans to which the Shah was strongly
opposed. It was anunderstandable dilemma but caution was preferred.9 The
increased goodwill that could have been gained by the acceptance ofthe offer
was lost byits rejection. Meanwhile the impact ofthe world depression, with
falling oil consumption and profits, lowered rather than increased the levelof
possible terms for a settlement on the old profit basis. The increasing financial
demands of Riza Shah's modernization programme exacerbated the foreign
exchange requirements ofthe Iranian government, making a compromise less
easy to attain.
This time ofeconomic crisis coincided with political unease as disturbances
took place in the country. In 1929, Khuzistan, centre ofAPOC's activities, was
threatened by strikes and tribal unrest for the suppression of which armed force
was needed.10 The heads of ministers, such asPrince Firuz, then Minister of
Finance, rolled. Infact, the company's operations were only threatened for one
day in early May and, because of the loyalty of its staff and workers, never ceased
working. Russian trade embargoes added tocommercial discontent and uncer
tainty. The working of the Iranian Trade Monopoly bill, a measure of
Timurtash, to control the import and export trade, was hard to administer. The
taxation ofprimary products like sugar and tobacco tofinance expenditureon
the railways was resented. An aggressive diplomatic policy was launched inthe
Persian Gulf in opposition toIraq, and Iranian claims toBahrain were revived.
Orders were placed for anavy tobe constructed inItalian shipyards. The Shah
became suspicious of the competence and allegiance of Timurtash, towhom he
was so much indebted.11

THE CONCESSIONARY PERIOD
In this tense climate of recrimination and adversity asthe Iranian ministers
struggled with an ambitious programme of modernization, including the Trans
Iranian railway, the acquisition of a navy and the establishment of new factories,
the royalty payments fell disastrously for 193 i to£306,872 on 5,750,498 tonsof
oil, the lowest amount since 1917 when they were £146,734 on644,074 tons. It
was almost 20% of what it had been in 1929, £1,436,764, but in the final
settlement of 1935 the royalty payments for 1931 were made up to a figure
comparable to the previous year (see Appendix 2). An enraged Riza Shah,
furious with his ministers andappalled at theassumed duplicity of APOC,
cancelled the concession on 27 November 1932. He tried to wipe the
concessionary slate clean, but recognizing that he could not manage the Iranian
oil industry without the assistance of the Company, he wasdetermined to
bargain for thebest terms with theleverage he believed he had gained.12
In the diplomatic moves which followed, the British government tookthe
case to the Council of the League of Nations, under whose aegis negotiations
were resumed inTehran. A settlement was reached, regarded by some Iranians
as a betrayal, because of the Shah's intemperate action but which, in the
economic and political circumstances ofthe time, resulted innot anideal but a
practical agreement, which became known as the 1933 Concession. Sayyid
Hasan Taqizada's allegations in January 1949 that the agreement had been
reached under duress were an attempt to exculpate himself, as the principal
Iranian negotiator after the dismissal of TImurtash, from criticism. Infact all the
main Iranian oil negotiators were subsequently censured for allegedly failing to
defend their country's interests; Amin al-Sultan, 1901, Taqizada, 1933, Abbas
Quli Gulshayan, 1949, and AllAmini, 1954.
In the 1933 Concession royalty payments were based on tonnage atan official
gold exchange rate instead of 16% of profits. Provision wasincluded for
participation in the company's profits by the Iranian government to the extent of
20% of dividends declared. The extent of the concessionary area was reduced to
100,000 square miles (see map 12). Adefinite obligation toincrease Iranian and
reduce foreign employees was included. A refinery was to be constructed in
Kirmanshah to process the crude oil from the Naft-i Shah field straddlingthe
Iran-Iraq border, and the concessionary duration was extended by60 years to
1993.13 There had been noactual interference with the company's operations
12 Conflicting analyses ofthe significance ofthis negotiated concession can be found in ElwellSutton, Persian Oil, p. 67; Lenczowski, Russia andthe West, pp. 80-1; Ramazani, Foreign Policy, p. 256; Stobaugh, "Evolution", p. 205. 13 A useful summary ofthese terms and much general information about the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is to be found in International Court of Justice, pp. 43-68.

during the negotiations, and, though plenty ofinvective was published in the
press, the damage to relations was minor. Riza Shah, however, had served notice
that along with the abolition of the Capitulations in 1928 he was not preparedto
accept economic dependence indefinitely. The timing may have been accidental,
perhaps premature, but the intention was perfectly clear.
It is an indication of what had been achieved in almost aquarter of a century
that Iran had become the first of the great oil producing countries in the Middle
East. Unprecedented well-head pressures anddifficult refining problems of
sulphurous crude oil hadbeen solved in the development of the Masjid-i
Sulaiman field. Research had been undertaken into oil reservoir behaviour and
its special characteristics as energy was released when the oil and gas surged to
the surface like bubbling froth. Understanding the significance ofbottom hole
temperatures and oil and water levels resulted in oil field production techniques,

pioneering in their time, which have constituted the "unitisation" basis of
modern methods throughout the world. They were first successfully applied at
the Haft Kel field, which was discovered in 1927. The superior technical skill
applied in the early days of the Iranian oil industry enabled production to be
economically maintained with minimal loss of gas pressure andwithout pump
ing. It prevented any water-flooding or blow-outs apart from the spectacular
fire at Rig 21 in 1951. Multi-stage gasseparation plants were developed by 1930
to enhance the recovery of some of the more useful gases and reduce the risk of
explosion. Early automated systems were introduced a decade later. Theexten
sive geological surveys conducted in the years 1924—5 led to the prospect of
further discoveries at Gach Saran, Naft Safid, Lali, Agha Jari and Pazanun
which were in production in the early forties. Geological, geophysical and
topographical surveys identified most of the principal features of the Iranian oil
scene.14
Employment rose in theindustry from 1,706, of whom 1,362were Iranian in
1910 to the peak year of 1930 with 31,246, of whom 20,095 were Iranian,
excluding contract labour and certain minority groups such as Armenians and
Arabs living in Khuzistan (seeAppendices 3 and 4 for details of numbers and
locations of the workforce, 1919—51). Artisan technical training schools were
started in 1922 andwithin a decade covered most trades, gradually diversifying
and advancing in scope. It has to be recognized that among the various
communities inhabiting Abadan and working at the refinery there were social
reservations and distinctive national characteristics, not only between Iranian
and British employees, but also between Iranian, Arab andIndian nationalities.
Abadan was a boom town in the 1920s, lacking many amenities. It was
administered inefficiently at first by Shaikh Khazcal till 1924, and then for a few
years by an inept local authority under weak central government supervision. It
was not an attractive place. The climate was humid, hot and oppressive, quite
unappealing to Iranians from the north, who,at first, showed little desire to
adapt to the industrial discipline inseparable from running a refinery. Those
more privileged regarded Khuzistan as a social backwater. Relations between
the different communities, while not unfriendly and occasionally close, were
generally distant. In statistical terms a production of 80,000 tons in 1912-13had
grown to 5,750,498 tons in 1931. Refinery throughput rose in the same period
from 33,000 tons to 4,3 88,000 tons in 1931, a tremendous increase. Theroyalties

reached their peak at£1,436,764 in 1931. By the end ofthe 1931, from 1913,
cumulative tonnage was 56,479,703 tons and the total royalty £11,265,627, an
average of4s.od. a ton.
The 1933 Concession
The signing ofthe 1933 Concession coincided with the ending ofthe worst
effects of the depression and the beginning of a recovery in the world economy.
This was reflected in a growing demand for oil products, which resulted in
Iranian production rising from 6,445,808 tons in 1932 to apeak of 10,195,371
tons in 193 8. At that rate its increase was proportionately higher than that of the
rest of the world (seefig.1). Refinery throughput also increased, the quality of
products improved and their range widened asnew processes were devised.
Geological exploration and aerial reconnaissances undertaken in the 1930s over
most of the area produced a mineral and topographical survey of potential value
and accuracy then unparalleled elsewhere in the Middle East. Itwas a period of
considerable improvement in medical care, housing, welfare, education and
training. Revenues to the Iranian government increased from £1,525,383 in
1932 to £4,270,814 in 1939. In 1936 agreement was reached on a General Plan in
accordance with Article 16 of the 1933 Concession. The apparent slowness of the
Iranianization programme was later resented bygovernment officials, but,
given the generally low level of Iranian technical education, the actual reduction
in foreign technicians and their replacement by Iranians were not unreasonable
in a highly technical industry (see table 1). Moreover, at that time most educated
Iranians had a predeliction for the pen and the office rather than the spanner and
the bench. According to the International Labour Office in 1950, "There is no
reluctance onthe part ofthe Company to recruit and promote Iranians . . .
positions are open toall who acquire the necessary qualifications and experi
ence."15 (For the gradual replacement of foreigners by Iranians over aten year
period, see table 2). The institution ofscholarships and training coursesfor
Iranian students in England, especially at Birmingham University, brought
Iranians into technical positions inthe service of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Com
pany (AIOC), as it became known in 1936 when Iran became the official name of
the country ininternational use, instead of Persia.

For many Iranians itwas the opening of a career in the oil industry which ledto

Mustafa Fatih, was incharge of APOC's petroleum distribution over mostof

the increasing modernization of the Iranian economy and the growth of
industrialization, oil consumption was rising and the years between 1933 and

THE CONCESSIONARY PERIOD
most of its foreign exchange earnings, apart from the important credit facilities
negotiated with the German government, trade with whom was encouraged to
lessen dependence on Russian imports and exports.
The relatively calm relations between AIOC and the Iranian government
were broken as a result of events in the Second World War. The success of
German submarine warfare caused the implementation of a short haul policy
over tanker sailings andsupplies in order to economize on vessels and reduce
voyage times, diverting them from loadings inMiddle Eastern ports tothose in
the United States and South America. Inevitably this changed the pattern of
supply and caused a reduction in Iranian oil revenues. Riza Shah, arguing that
the outbreak ofhostilities between Great Britain and Germany was no concern
of his, threatened to abrogate the 1933 Concession in July 1940, but finally
agreed toa guaranteed fixed payment of£4,000,000 inroyalties until the revival
of oil exports should bring about a revenue which would exceed this amount,
which was arbitrarily based upon that of 1939. He had been expecting an amount
of £14,000,000 which would have borne no relationship tomarket realities, only
to his ownbudgetary requirements.
The security of the refinery and the oil installation during the war was a
problem. The entry ofBritish and Russian forces into Iran on25 August 1941 as
a result of the German invasion of Russia and German infiltration into Iran,
while it ensured the protection ofthe operations from ground attack, was not a
complete defence from aerial bombardment. The useof Abadan as a base for
supplies to Russia with American assistance was important during the war, no
less than the establishment of a vital plant for the production of 100 octane
aviation spirit in 1943. Gradually oil demand increased and exceeded that ofpre
war production as war activities developed ineastern territories. Iranian opinion
was not convinced ofthe necessity forviolating the country's neutrality in1941,
whatever the provocation offered bythe pro-German stance of Riza Shah. The
British government received itsshare ofthe criticism fordisrupting the Iranian
economy and political life. The company too was not immune from such
accusations andit was a target of abuse, particularly after the termination of
hostilities and the revival ofpolitical activity following years of suppression by
Riza Shah, who abdicated on 16 September 1941 in favour of his eldestson,
Muhammad Riza, andwho died in South Africa in 1944. Theentry of allied
troops into the country frustrated Iranian national aspirations and caused some
among a new politically alert generation to question the political occupation of
northern Iran byRussian troops, while others objected to the economic subser
vience of the southern oil fields to the control of AIOC.

THE IRANIAN OIL INDUSTRY
It must not be forgotten that although the D'Arcy Concession was the most
successful, itwas not the only oil concession or example of foreign interest in its
time in Iran. During the First World War, A. Khostaria, an Iranian of Russian
origin, was granted a concession on the basis of an even earlier one in northern
Iran. It was the subject of much controversy when Khostaria tried later to
dispose of it individually to Gulbenkian, the APOC, the Standard Oil Company
(NJ) and the Sinclair Oil Corporation in the early 1920s. He was also involved in
the Kavir—Khuriyan Concession of 1925, which, with Russian participation,
was interested inthe possibility of discovering oil inthe Simnan region. Riza
Shah and Timurtash also had personal interests in this project. There was some
minor American and Royal Dutch Shell interest at the end ofthe 1930s.
It was, however, during the Second World War that the possibility ofoil
discoveries in northern and, to a lesser extent, in southeastern Iran was revived.
Two American oil companies and the Royal Dutch-Shell made approaches to
the prime minister, Muhammad Sacid in 1943. These overtures were politely
accepted, examined by the American oil consultants Herbert Hoover Jnr. and A.
Curtis on behalf of the Iranian government, but received a non-committal
answer. The American interest and thepresence of Herbert Hoover had
significance in the longer term for American concern over Iran in the late 1940s
and later, particularly over the nationalization issue in 1951 and the composition
of the consortium in 1954. The Russian government was seriously concerned
over these developments, which conflicted with itspolitical and economic
interests in Iran. On 15 September 1944, Sergei Kavtaradze, Deputy Commissar
for Foreign Affairs, arrived in Tehran to demand a concession in the north of
Iran. Sacid pleaded that hewas precluded from granting one bya cabinet
decision of 2 September prohibiting the offering of oil concessions to foreigners
during thewar. Russian pressure was intense and Sacid was subsequently
obliged to resign.
He was succeeded by Murtaza Qull Khan Bayat, who was believed to be more
amenable to Russian requests, but shortly after taking office, and withhis
agreement, Dr Muhammad Musaddiq made his first memorable and important
intervention in oil affairs by successfully tabling a bill in December 1944, which
prevented any member of the Iranian government from concluding any negotia
tions for oil concessions with any foreigner without reference to the Majlis. The

conditions. These occurred in 1946 when Russian troops were still stationed in

THE CONCESSIONARY PERIOD
was virtually being administered byan autonomous regime under Russian
protection, which was asserting itself and acquiring political support in oppos
ing the policies of Muhammad Riza Shah. Qavam al-Saltana, who became prime
minister in January 1946, was determined to preserve the political and economic
unity of Iran. He had to reconcile the short term objectives of Russian insistence
on an oil concession with the long term objectives of Iranian independence. He
temporized by signing an oil concession for fifty years on 4 April in Tehran, after
a month-long visit to Moscow in February. Among other provisions, he agreed
to the formation of a company, in which the Russian government would holda
51 per cent shareholding in return for providing all the capital, equipment and
senior members of the staff. The agreement, in any event, had to be ratified by
the Majlis; this was the crucial point.
Shortly afterwards Russian troops withdrew from Iran. The independent
republic of Azarbaijan collapsed in the face of a show of strength by the Iranian
army towards the end ofthe year. Qavam completed the discomfiture ofthe
Russians by delaying the submission of the oil agreement to the Majlis until the
new session had been convened inOctober 1947. It was then rejected on22
October by 102 votes to 2 and animportant bill sponsored byQavam was
approved, effectively laying down anIranian oil policy forthe first time, a
subject which was ofconsiderable national concern. It proposed:
(1) Iran was to explore and exploit her own oil resources during the next few
years with her own capital.
(2) The prime minister's negotiations for an oil agreement with Soviet Russia
were tobe null and void.
(3) Iran was not to grant any concessions to foreign powers or to have foreign
partners orhelp in oil exploration.
(4) Ifoil were found in the country within the following 5 years, the govern
ment might negotiate with Russia with a view toselling oil tothe latter.
(5) In all cases where the rights of the Iranian nation, in respect of the country's
national resources, whether underground or otherwise, had been impaired,
particularly in regard to the Southern Oil, the government was required to
enter into such negotiations and take such measures as were necessary to
protect the national rights, and inform the Majlis ofthe result.
It may have been a statement of principles rather than an immediate practical
programme. It may have been part ofthe traditional balancing act between
Russian and British interests asQavam informed the British ambassador, Sir

John Le Rougetel; Qavam denied that he had any intention whatsoever of
suggesting any change inthe concession.17 Qavam had never really trusted the
Pahlavi dynasty and the Shah doubted his loyalty, particularly after his notable
part inhelping tosettle the Azarbaijan crisis and bring about the evacuation of
Russian troops. Preliminary discussions only had been held with the AIOC,
before the smouldering antipathy between monarch and prime minister erupted
at the beginning of December and Qavam was suddenly dismissed. Polarization
of the political situation followed, the middle ground was lost and the moderates
were silenced by the passionate partisans ofboth the Shah and the opposition,
each group claiming ultimate sanctity for its own profession of patriotism and its
own brand of national policy. It was a political misfortune.
Attempting to keep its political neutrality, AIOC was suspected by both sides
of partiality, if not interference inthe affairs ofthe other side. It isessential to
understand the dilemma in which the Company was placed in attempting to
handle its relations with the Iranian government on acommercial level when the
context was fundamentally political. This attitude may have been naive, but it
was consistent since Cadman's discussions with Riza Shah in 1926 and with
Timurtash in 1928. The same policy was pursued elsewhere, for example in Italy
and Germany in the 1930s. The Company was exposed andvulnerable to
criticism because it loomed solarge onthe Iranian political horizon. It was a
scapegoat not only because ofits presence and success but also because ofits
shortcomings. These were sometimes visible, as when strikes occurred inMay
1946, which although politically motivated, did also represent grievances over
inadequate housing inthe then overcrowded Abadan area, and the high cost of
living; butthese factors also involved themunicipal responsibilities of the
Iranian government noless than the moral obligations of the Company.
Indeed one ofthe main reasons ofdiscontent in Abadan was the conflict of
interest between the Iranian government and AIOC over the welfare amenities
and facilities ofthe town. The Government claimed that Abadan was entirely
dependent on AIOC, for without ititwould not have existed, since the origin of
its existence was oil. The AIOC was prepared to and didshare some of the
expenditure, but itconsidered that the provision of basic services was essentially
the responsibility ofthe Government. The dilemma was never really resolved
satisfactorily forthe inhabitants. Nevertheless, between 1946 and 1950 AIOC

THE CONCESSIONARY PERIOD
spent some £34.5 million on social amenities, housing, ancillary services,
medical andeducational buildings, as well as some £2,250,000 on shops, stores,
restaurants, and sporting facilities. Health services costing some £2,000,000 in
1950 were provided and included 101 medical officers, 7 dentists, and 130
nursing staff with 853 hospital beds available as well as 35 clinics and
dispensaries catering for 12,162 admissions (6,956 employees, 5,206 others)and
1,530,815 attendances (504,418 employees and 1,026,397 others).
Apart from its owneducational schemes, AIOC contributed to thecost of 3 5
primary and secondary schools in Khuzistan. TheCompany never claimed that
this expenditure was altruism. It was enlightened self-interest, which also
contributed to the benefit of the population and on which the ILO mission
commented that, "theworking and living conditions of the oil workers appear
as anencouraging example of what can bedone".18 It was notto beexpected that
the Company would not be involved in political or social controversies, even
disturbances, in theareas of its operations. Occasionally individual incidents ofa
regrettable kind did occur. Generally relations were good. Investment in Iran
was considerable; between 1931 and 1950, for example, some £93 m. wasspent
on capital expenditure for fixed assets, which would have reverted to Iran on the
expiry of the concession, £16 million on mobile assets and £10^ million on
drilling wells.
The Company was with reason, over-cautious about its "Iranianization"
programme because of a perceived low standard of technical education. Itdid,
however, institute a wide range of training facilities from the early 1920s to
compensate for the poor level of educational attainment in Khuzistan. It was,
perhaps, in retrospect, excessively worried about the safety of its operations,
particularly at the refinery during a time of rapid technological development.
Moreover, the unattractiveness of the area to better-educated Iranians from
Tehran and the north of the country did not then encourage many of them to
seek employment in thehotandhumid climate of Abadan, engaged in work that
was not congenial to their temperament, and where opportunities of rapid
promotion to senior positions were not commensurate with their expectations
of good living conditions and high remuneration. There were more attractive
opportunities elsewhere for those interested in industry or government, where
the demands for better trained and technically knowledgeable management
were growing but in short supply. Nevertheless, whatever the educational
inadequacies, the social implications and the prevailing circumstances, the

THE IRANIAN OIL INDUSTRY
transition from the concessionary to the national period was largely accom
plished operationally by those who had been trained by and worked for AIOC,
including some who had studied at universities and technical institutes in
England.
Besides those who held managerial posts inthe oilfields orinthe process
plants in the refineries, on whose competence the continuity and efficiency of the
actual operations relied, there were several other Iranians who achieved more
senior positions. These included alater first Secretary-General of the Organiza
tion of Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC), an Assistant General Man
ager, the highest appointment reached by an Iranian in the company, and a later
Deputy Chairman ofthe National Iranian Oil Company.
When negotiations foranadjustment ofthe 1933 Concession were being
considered in 1947, there was some antagonism towards AIOC and its British
affiliations because of Iranian experience during the Second World War. This
was combined with excessive Iranian expectations about the possible terms for a
new settlement, stimulated by some American encouragement. In the same way
anti-foreign sentiment had been mixed with ambitious demands inthe earlier
negotiations of1928—33. With hindsight the haggling over details seems insig
nificant in the context of the explosion of oil demand which took place inthe
early 1950s and continued at anescalating pace until the late 1970s. Such a
development, however, was not apparent in 1948. Many experts were inclined to
be more pessimistic than optimistic over theprospects for oil in energy
consumption, and were apprehensive about the future demands for energy itself
in a depressed post-war world economy. The importance of General Marshall's
plan for Europe's economic rehabilitation, proposed in June 1947, had still not
been sufficiently taken into account.
Moreover, it has to be recognized that the serious financial situation affecting
the United Kingdom in the post-war period was not properly understood and
played apart in creating suspicion among Iranian politicians. It was not to be
expected that they should be sympathetic, just as itwas unreasonable to assume
that they should have been appreciative of the motives which led to the allied
forces entering their country in 1941. It was understandable, however, that they
should have objected to the British government's austere fiscal policyan
nounced in the Budget of 1948, whereby the payment of dividends for 1947 were
kept at the level of-1946. Although the Company declared adividend of30 per
cent for 1947, it had toconform tothe Government's dividend stabilization
policy, thus reducing the amount which would have been payable to the Iranian

government under the concessionary provision ofa sum equal to20 per centof
any dividend distribution to theordinary stockholders above £671,250.
The British Treasury in the face of the terrible financial position of the
country,19 at first refused to make an exception for AIOC in respect of its
payments to the Iranian government and neither the representations of AIOC
nor the intervention ofthe Foreign Office was persuasive inchanging its mind.
Before thefinal negotiations of the Supplemental OilAgreement in 1949,an
accommodation had been reached with theTreasury, butby that time confi
dence had already been damaged. Furthermore, the Treasury was unwilling to
revalue the rate forgold exchange to which part ofthe royalty payments were
pegged. This was a complicated issue with commitments to international
agreements, but Iranians argued rightly that the official price bore no relation to
the prices current onthe open markets. The annoyance ofIranian negotiators
was directed against AIOC, which was wrongly alleged to have connived in
depriving the Iranian government of its revenues. Relations between the British
government and AIOC were sometimes uneasy, and their views did not
necessarily coincide. It was with reluctance rather than enthusiasm that Abbas
Quli Gulshayan, Finance Minister in Muhammad Sacid's second government,
signed the Supplemental Agreement on 19 July 1949, after a final negotiating
session of almost six months. It offered better terms than were currently
available in Saudi Arabia or Iraq, although much below Iranian expectations.
Between 1943 and1950, production tripled from 9,705,769 tons to 31,750,147
tons and royalties quadrupled from 1944 to 1950, £4,464,438 to £16,031,735.
Iranian employment totalled 75,853 in 1950. Some idea of the growth of the
Iranian market for oil products from 1933 may be gauged from the deliveriesof
AIOC to it up to 1950 (seeAppendix 5 which does not include Russian
supplies). Aview ofoil field development inthe concessionary period is shown

THE IRANIAN OIL INDUSTRY
cally motivated atmosphere of the time, did not presage a rapid legislative
passage forthe Supplemental Agreement at the end ofa charged session of the
Majlis. A few deputies of the National Front took the initiative and by
filibustering tactics, prevented a vote onthe agreement being obtained before
the final meeting of the 15th Majlis. Muhammad Sacid, arespected elderly prime
minister, lacked the political will toassert strong leadership and was indecisive.
He resigned in April 1950 to make way for CA1I Mansur, of whom the Shah
expected much, but who accomplished little. Inanattempt totake the sting out
of the oil controversy anddisguise his own inaction, Mansur set up an Oil
Committee of the Majlis. This special committee actually became the most
effective platform forthe dissemination ofDr Musaddiq's ideas, because it was
he who quickly succeeded in dominating its proceedings. The Supplemental
Agreement languished with other measures forbudget appropriations andthe
launching of the Seven Year Plan, while the economic situation deteriorated and
financial requirements became more pressing during thelast full year of the
operations of the AIOC.
The political crisis became more confused. Inan attempt to reassert himself,
the Shah, with the approval of the U.S. State Department, reluctantly appointed
General cAli Razmara prime minister inJune 1950. Inthe event it was a gamble
that failed. Razmara may have been inclined to liberal sentiments but,asa
soldier, hewas suspected of having dictatorial intentions. Moreover, he never
mastered his contempt forpoliticians and was devious in attempting to dodge
oil decisions. Above all, the circumstances of his appointment imposed an
American dimension upon the Iranian political scene, turning domestic contro
versies into international issues in theemerging Cold War confrontation.20
A further important factor was the American decision, inthe face ofits own
concessionary difficulties inSaudi Arabia, which were aggravated by Ibn Saud's
excessive personal expenditure, tosimplify its concessionary payments thereon
the general basis of a 50:50 share of profits. This introduced a radicalnew
approach to concessionary payments in theMiddle East in December 195 o.21
The concept ofprofit sharing had been introduced into Venezuela in 1948 and
was facilitated byAmerican tax concessions, not applicable toBritish compan
ies. Moreover, many people insufficiently appreciated or disregarded the fact
that the shared profit arrangement applied to the subsidiary producing compan
ies ofthe foreign oil companies operating inVenezuela and Saudi Arabia; it did

NATIONALIZATION AND THE OIL CONSORTIUM
not involve the activities of the parent Company. AIOC was not organized in
that way and was not prepared any more than any other oil company, to share its
total earnings with any one concessionary country. Itwas, however, prepared to
set up a subsidiary production company inIran and toshare the profits from
such a company with the Iranian government and informed Razmara accord
ingly in February 1951.He refused to commit himself and kept the offer secret.
The Iranian government would have almost doubled revenues between 1948
and 1950 if it had accepted the Supplemental Agreement, but it mistakenly
believed that AIOC was completely dependent on Iran.
The Supplemental Agreement entangled inthese controversies never had
another hearing in the Majlis onitsown merits. Razmara received financial
advances from AIOC on account for royalty payments of £11 million with £25
million more in promises, but disclosed neither of these financial offers of
assistance publicly as he waited vainly for a political miracle or American magic.
His advisers proposed accepting the Supplemental Agreement. He was assassi
nated leaving amosque on 7March 1951.Husain cAla succeeded him as prime
minister. DrMusaddiq, chairman of the Majlis Oil Committee, movedthe
rejection of the Supplemental Agreement, which he had consistently opposed.
Within a few weeks Dr Musaddiq became prime minister and the Majlis
formally approved of the nationalization of the oil industry in abill which the
Shah signed on 1 May 1951.
It was a personal triumph for Dr Musaddiq and his National Front group, for
he had constantly opposed foreign intervention inthe industrial enterprise of
Iran, especially inthe oil sector.22 Moreover, he had scored avictory over the
Shah in having obstructed parliamentary proceedings to further hisown
political programme. The oil issue had provided him with a platform for his
opposition to royal policies. He was not alone, however, for it was clear that the
religious agitation provoked by Ayatullah Abu3l-Qasim Kashani had also been
instrumental in sustaining the campaign for oil nationalization, especially after
his return to Tehran from exile in June 1950.Kashani believed that industrializa
tion was having a harmful effect on Iranian society and undermining its spiritual
values. Supported by many members ofthe bazaar, he denounced the Seven
Year Plan as a"godless enterprise".23 These opinions were later echoed in the

views ofthe Islamic Republican Party, who credited Kashani, not Musaddiq,
with the triumph ofthe oil nationalization policy.
The AIOC has been criticized for ignoring the auguries of the time as if it was
engaged in some sinister conspiracy against the Iranian people. Indeed, Dr
Musaddiq himself persistently proclaimed that the Company was an instrument
of repression on behalf of the British government, particularly during proceed
ings before the International Court of Justice at the Hague in June 1952.
Members of the World Bank on their mediating mission to Iran in March 1952,
were impartial in their approach to finding a solution of the oil problem.
Nevertheless, one of the members, Hector Prud'homme remarked, "It would be
difficult to reach any agreement in the atmosphere that prevails in Iran now. The
oil problem is mainly a political problem. Our difficulty was that we were
dealing with political men and not businessmen."24 There was nothing intrinsi
cally wrong inthe Iranian government's insistence on political priorities, but
there was nothing essentially wrong in acommercial company's assertion of its
economic constraints. The misfortune was that because ofa lack of mutual
confidence both sides misjudged the moment for compromise. Yet, while the
histrionics and rhetoric of the time are explicable, they should not obscure the
commitment and co-operation of other Iranian governments and AIOC in
developing the oil resources and using the skills of the oil workers for Iranian
economic progress, which emerged from the positive rather than negative
aspects oftheir relationship.
The Nationalization was a unilateral appropriation not a negotiated settle
ment, irrespective of its political inevitability or its economic desirability. Iran
had crossed its oil Rubicon. There was no going back. AIOC took measuresto
defend its interests, the Iranian government took action to establish its rights,
the British government moved toprotect its nationals, wThile intermediaries
made attempts to reconcile the differences. The United Nations, the Inter
national Court of Justice and the World Bank became involved. The American
and British governments, with their differing assessments of the state of Iran and
the chances of it resisting alleged communist influence, tried to present a joint
approach. In spite of public statements, in reality they were divided not only on
their attitudes to the Iranian government, but on their appreciation of its
attitude tothem and its international stance.
In Iran, too, divisions appeared between the National Front and its associates

NATIONALIZATION AND THE OIL CONSORTIUM
as the promised panacea for allpolitical and economic ills was painfully not
proving to be the appropriate prescription. Abrief political struggle took place
in July 1952 when Qavam al-Saltana failed to oust DrMusaddiq. Diplomatic
relations were severed with the United Kingdom in October 1952. The oil issue
was enmeshed in political anddiplomatic complexities andnobody had the
authority to unravel the difficulties. Elsewhere, the world soon ignored the lack
of Iranian oil production but was fascinated by its political consequences. Few
were willing tohandle disputed oil, not only because ofthe legal consequences
but because of condoning action to which they toomight be exposed ifa
precedent were set. Production increased inother countries of the Middle East,
particularly inKuwait and Iraq, and the loss ofIranian oil was made good and
forgotten.
It was a chastening and deeply unfortunate experience. The financial failure
of his post-nationalization oil policy partially weakened Musaddiq and his
supporters and affected their political power, while strengthening the credibility
of the Tiida Party. After his arrest on 26 August 1953, following a controversial
coup engineered bythe CIA and principally carried out byforces loyal to the
Shah, Musaddiq's political idealism, although noteffaced, was momentarily
eclipsed.25 The Shah, almost disgraced, emerged andgradually asserted his
authority, becoming inthe early 1960s increasingly conscious ofa sense ofhis
divine mission for his country and intolerant of political opponents. Freed from
concessionary restraints, oil resources were thereafter more closely linked to the
destiny ofIran as perceived by the Shah and his ministers. Rising oil revenues
increased the power of the state and began to dominate the political economy of
the nation. The government, although dependent on theconstitutional ap
proval ofthe Majlis for additional taxation, became almost financially indepen
dent, since it was effortlessly supplied with unprecedented revenues, with little
or nodebate over the priorities for state expenditure.
There were no restrictions on royal ambition other than economic prudence,
which had little relevance forthe achievement ofthe White Revolution or the
"Great Civilisation". Growing world consumption of oil products and increas
ing OPEC production power caused anupward ratcheting ofworld oil prices
from the late 1960s tothe end ofthe 1970s. The disintegration and collapseof
Musaddiq's administration, like the earlier dismissal of Qavam in 1947, once
again left the Iranian political middle ground a "no go" area and compromise

was spurned. The revival of the Iranian oil industry in its nationalized form had
actually buttressed the power ofthe Shah rather than having moderated the
exercise of it.
Following the return of the Shah from his brief exile after the deposition of
Dr Musaddiq's government in August 1953, General ZahidI became prime
minister. The country was confused and the economic situation depressed.
Zahidi, reviewing his political and diplomatic options, agreed to renew relations
with the British government and reopen negotiations foranoilsettlement.
There were consultations between the American and British governments over
a solution of the oil problem. Discussions took place among the international oil
companies involved in Middle East operations, who would have to adjust their
production schedules inorder toaccommodate the return ofIranian oil pro
ducts to world markets: itwas not just asimple matter of resuming diplomatic
relations or turning onthe oil taps. Intricate supply equations needed to be
carefully resolved in order to preserve commercial equilibrium and prevent the
hostility of other oil producing countries, which had raised their production to
compensate for the loss of Iranian crude oil. No less important was the nature of
the settlement toreplace the old concessionary structure, to take into account
the principles of nationalization which had been accepted, and to introduce the
new 50:50 profit sharing arrangement which, following the ARAMCO agree
ment with Saudi Arabia at the end of 1950, was now the pattern of concessionary
relations. All this required inter-governmental and inter-company agreement.
Gradually and with difficulty a consensus emerged during January to March
1954, settling a negotiating position to take up with the Iranian government. Mr
(later Sir) Denis Wright, British ambassador in Iran (1963—71) resumed Anglo
Iranian relations as charge d'affaires in December 1953 and reported to the
Foreign Office that the AIOC would not be able to resume its former role in the
Iranian oil industrv.
A consortium ofcompanies was provisionally established by 1 April 1954
and itsrepresentatives, Orville Harden (later replaced byHoward Page) of
Standard Oil (N.J.), Harold Snow of AIOC and J.H. Loudon of Royal Dutch
Shell arrived in Tehran on 11 April 1954. The Iranian negotiators, led by cAli
AmlnT, Minister of Finance, were Abd-Allah Intizam, Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Fath-Allah Khan Nurl Isfandiyarl, formerly charge d'affaires in London
(1930-1), and Murtaza Quli Khan Bayat, Chairman of the National Iranian Oil
Company, who attended occasionally. Sir Roger Stevens, British ambassador in
Iran, and Snow negotiated in separate meetings with Amlnl on the question of
compensation for AIOC. The talks, conducted with goodwill on all sides, were

long, arduous and challenging. The Consortium Agreement was initialled by
Howard Page and CA1I Amini on 5 August 1954, ratified by the Majlis by 113
votes to 5 with 1 abstention on 21 October and signed bythe Shah on 29
October.
In form itwas an agency contract in which Iran retained sovereignty over its
oil resources and assets in the concessionary area, but permitted the Consortium
to operate and use them on behalf of the Government for twenty five years, with
the provision ofthree five-year renewals at its option. For this purpose two
operating companies were formed and registered in Holland, Iranian Oil
Exploration and Producing Company and the Iranian Oil Refining Company,
over which the Iranian government had the right of inspection and to audit their
accounts, which it delegated tothe National Iranian Oil Company. The two
companies were non-profit making and not directly engaged inexporting or
selling oil, which was undertaken by the trading companies of the Consortium
members, which were established in Tehran and operated until the early 1970s.
In London a holding company, Iranian Oil Participants Ltd. (IROP), was
established to conduct Consortium business and a servicing company, Iranian
Oil Services Ltd. (IROS).
Those companies finally constituting the Consortium and their
shareholdings were:
British Petroleum Company Limited 40%
Shell Petroleum N.V. 14%
Gulf Oil Corporation 7%
Mobil Oil Corporation 7%
Standard Oil Company ofCalifornia 7%
Exxon Corporation 7%
Texaco Incorporated 7%
Compagnie Francaise des Petroles 6%
The Iricon Group of Companies:
American Independent Oil Company
Atlantic Richfield Company
Getty Oil Company

belongs to All Amlnl, who had, perhaps, the weakest hand but played it with
integrity, patriotism and understanding. He acknowledged the great political
impetus which had been given to theIranian oil industry by theact of
nationalization, but herealized its economic limitations. He reported tothe
Majlis on 21 October that "the solution that I bring you is perhaps not the ideal
solution . . . but we do not yet have the means to compete in the international
markets because we do not possess a marketing organization." This explanation
was practical wisdom. As a result ofthe Agreement, exploration, production
and refining were to be carried on within its area by the Consortium, whilst all
the ancillary services were administered by the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC), which was responsible for all activities outside the designated area,
including the refineries and internal distribution.
THE NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL COMPANY
External Relations
The first seriously considered project for anational Iranian oil company arose
from the report of the Plan Organization in 1949in which it was stated that "The
Seven Year Plan stipulates that a Government-owned joint stock company shall
be created for the purpose ofexploring for, exploiting and marketing oil, all
implicitly under the direction of the Plan Organization, since funds for the
purpose are tobe provided by it."26 Details ofan exploration programme, a
widespread distribution network, budgetary provision and an administrative
organization were given. Emphasis was placed on increasing the consumption
of petroleum products throughout the country and the importance of"the
delivery by pipeline of oil and gas from the present fields in the south to the more
densely populated areas north ofthe Zagros Mountains". "Pipeline distribu
tion", itwas argued, "of both oil and gas will certainly become apart of Iran's
economic programme." Like much else inthe Seven Year Development Plan
which was not implemented, the suggestions for the oil industry provided just a
sketch of a blueprint for future action, although an exploration programme was
initiated discovering a show ofoil near Qum.
The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) was constituted after National
ization to manage the domestic oil industry. Following the Consortium Agree
ment attention was paid to theconstitution of NIOC, approved in 1955.

THE NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL COMPANY
Afterwards, first cAbd-Allah Intizam until 1962, then DrManuchihr Iqbal until
he died in 1978and Hushang Ansarl were chairmen. The Iranian Petro
leum Act of 1957 vested in the NIOC definite functions and responsibilities as
the owner ofand the authority forall national oil resources. It was a favourable
moment forthe new company. It was not long before NIOC was exercising its
rights and implementing the national oil policy. It wasnot just a matter of
managing the national oil resources but maximizing revenues as a powerful
stimulus for national economic growth, producing a favourable political re
sponse andpromoting Iran's influence in international relations.
The late fifties, sixties and early seventies, were an eraof growth and great
expectations.27 NIOC and the oilsector played their parts indomestic progress
and international affairs. Thus, forexample, anextraordinary contribution was
made to GNP bytheoilsector between 1959 and 1974, rising from 28million
rials to 1635 billion rials andtherising contribution of oil receipts to foreign
exchange earnings between 1954 and 1974, from $34.4 million, 15percent, to
£18,000 million (see chapter 17). Oil revenues constituted twothirds of the
finance available tothe second, third and fourth plans. Posted prices forIranian
light crude oiladvanced tenfold from $1,790 in 1971 to $11,875 by theend of
1973 (see Appendix 6), and crude oil production increased tenfold from
24,000,000 tons in 1956 to 251,900,000 tons in 1972 peaking at 301,200,000 tons
in 1974 anddropping by half to 158,100,100 tons in 1979.
The NIOC hadbeen empowered to negotiate joint venture contracts with
other organizations both on-shore and in maritime sovereign areas. In August
1957 the first such agreement was concluded with theItalian state company,
Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI). Within fourteen years another ten contracts
had been signed with companies from the United States, France, Germany and
Japan. The intention was tolessen dependence onthe Consortium and enhance
oil revenue-making opportunities by insisting on more advantageous terms.
Iran pioneered this type of arrangement, but only three joint venture companies
struck oil inany commercial quantities, so there was little possibility oflessening
dependence onthe Consortium (see Tables 3.1—3.2).
Other developments included service style contracts in which the foreign
operator had noownership rights inIran, but provided the initial expertise and
finance for exploration. Once oil wasdiscovered NIOC assumed control of
production and anincreasing share ofmarketing, and paid aservice fee to cover
the preliminary expenditure, either in cash or oil. Three such contracts were

were contractual innnovations in Iran and stimulated a widening interest in
Iranian oil. For the location map of these agreements see map 14.
Because the search to discover other sources of oil in Iran outside the area of
the Consortium's operations wasunsuccessful and as the size of Iranian budgets
grew inexorably larger, the Shah was determined totighten the screws on the
members ofthe Consortium to make them produce more, although they had
fulfilled allthat had been required of them and more under the terms of the
Consortium Agreement. The Shah, however, like his father, wanted toacceler
ate economic take-offin order to get into ahigher orbit of industrialization more
quickly within his own lifetime. This was critical because hefelt that hisown

THE NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL COMPANY
production. Heshrewdly exploited and played off differences between the
member companies and revealed details of their agreed production quotas. The
majority of the Consortium members, with other Middle Eastern interests,
having revived the flow of Iranian oil, were engaged in delicately balancing their
various concessionary interests, about which the Shah was little concerned. He
was prepared to play his Russian card in order to persuade the American
members of the Consortium to toe the line, particularly those with interestsin
Saudi Arabia. Iranian competition with Saudi Arabia at this time was a feature of
diplomatic relations and the proceedings in OPEC. The Shah was knowledge
able about petroleum affairs and held his own in conversations with representa
tives ofthe Consortium.
The Shah exerted moral pressure byappealing forsympathy forhis now
more populous and water-short land. He stressed the strategic importance of his
country to western governments and after the Arab restrictions on suppliesin
the wake ofthe Six Day War of 1967, and that ofYom Kippur in 1973, he
emphasized his reliability. With the British declaration of pulling out from East
of Suez and the Nixon doctrine of regional security, the Shah was able to exert
considerable leverage to achieve his own objectives. He was astute, knowledge
able and persistent, the fiddler who played the tune to which others danced.
Abd-Allah Intizam, the Chairman of NIOC, opened negotiations in 1961 and
prevailed upon the Consortium to exceed its accepted production levels. In 1965
Consortium production dipped as demand dropped in the market and because of
certain competitive pressures which put Iranian oil ataslight economic disad
vantage, but not below stipulated levels. The Shah was unimpressed with any
excuses and requested that the growth in production offtake be restored to a17
per cent increase because, he argued, he was suffering from the effects of
inflation imported from the western economies, and his large and increasing
population required more expenditure onindustrial development. Although
the Consortium members increased production by some 12 per cent, the Shah
was unappeased and demanded that the Consortium relinquish some of its area
and sell oil toNIOC which would then be able to commence its own overseas
marketing operations. This it did, mostly to East European countries.
The British and American governments, as much interested in Iran's strate
gic co-operation as in oil income, advised the Consortium not to rock the Iranian
economy orthwart the Shah's ambitions. The advice, like the reasoning, was
familiar. It rested on the fear of Iran quitting the western alliance and nobody
was prepared to call the Shah's bluff. It was the oilcompanies who had to
perform a balancing act with the Arab oil producing countries, not the diplo

mats or politicians. The Consortium in 1967 agreed to increase production by
11% fortwo years, relinquish a quarter of their area and make oilavailable to
NIOC for four years on the understanding that it was to be sold to certain
Eastern European countries so as not to destabilize the markets in which
members ofthe Consortium traded. Ayear later, the Shah, taking advantageof
the increased Iranian production of 22% asa result ofthe Arab-Israeli Six Day
War, which caused an interruption in Arab oil supplies, pressed home his
advantage when production fell tothe previous level. He expected the increased
production to be maintained andwhen members of the Consortium dragged
their feet they were warned that thecriteria for production levels was to be
based, not on their judgment of market demand, but toguarantee the budgetary
requirements of the Iranian government, almost a repetition ofthe arguments
which preceded thesigning of the Supplemental Agreement in 1949 and the
1933 Concession. The dilemma was the same.28
It was not market forces but political priorities which were setting the pace,
as in Musaddiq's time. Inevitably, such a fundamental clash of interestswas
difficult to meet by compromise and neither time nor circumstances were
propitious for more than a rearguard action whilst the Shah maintained his
claims. On 14 May 1969 MrD.E.C. (later SirDavid) Steel forthe Consortium
and Dr Manuchihr Iqbal for the Iranian government signed an agreement which
raised Iranian royalty payments for ayear, but without further specific commit
ments. It would be an exaggeration to imply that the Shah was following a
consistent strategy, but by adroit opportunism he had restored Iranian output to
its former importance, second in the Middle East league. It appeared an
appropriate moment to capitalize onthis success and enhance the value of the
barrel, butthis he felt he could do best in association with other producing
countries, who would have tobe persuaded tofollow his line. The Shah was not
long in setting thepace for higher prices, encouraged by thesuccess he had
already achieved. These successes, however, may then have encouraged the
Iranian government to exaggerate itsown oil importance, and pursue an over
ambitious programme ofeconomic development beyond the administrative or
structural capacity of the country.
The creation in September i960 of the Organization of the Oil Producing
28 Stocking, Middle East Oil, p. 449 described thesituation of the Consortium: "They havethe delicate task of maintaining anequilibrium ofsatisfaction among the several host governments . .. They take the position that the increase inoutput of any one country is limited by the general levelof output for the Middle East as a whole."

THE NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL COMPANY
Exporting Companies (OPEC), of which Iran wasone of the founder members
and provided its first Secretary-General, established aforum for the exercise not
just of national pressures to safeguard andincrease oil revenues, but for
collective international action toachieve those ends.29 After almost adecade of
successful passive resistance to attempts to lower posted prices onwhich oil
revenues were based, members of OPEC in thelate 1960s and early 1970s
initiated negotiations with the principal international oil companies toincrease
the level of posted prices. Provoked by the success of Libya in 1969—70 in raising
its revenues, the Shah responded by requesting further similar increases for Iran.
He succeeded inpromoting and leading a Gulf Committee comprising the oil
producing states inthe Persian Gulf area. Threatening to cancel the agreement
with the Consortium, the Shah on 14 February 1971forced the members of the
Consortium to accept higher prices. The oil companies were unsupported by
their national governments, which preferred to ensure immediate security ofoil
supplies than worry about the dangers of higher prices. The consumer govern
ments ofWestern Europe and the United States disbelieved the warnings they
received from the oilcompanies. The Shah's able Finance Minister, JamshTd
Amuzgar, handled these negotiations with realism and understanding with
Lord Strathalmond, the leader of the companies' negotiators inTehran during
January andFebruary 1971. Thechanging producer—consumer relationship and
its global implications caused considerable anxiety in those years.30
In return for a five-year agreement wanted by the oil companies tostop the
leap-frogging ofdemands from the producing countries the Shah obtained:
(1) A change in the taxation rate from aminimum 50:50 to 55145 % in favour of
the Persian Gulf OPEC member countries.
(2) A straight increase of33 cents per barrel in Persian Gulf crude oil prices, an
additional two cents per barrel for transportation costs, a 2.5 cents annual
increase to offset inflation in the West, and a 5 cents per barrel annual
increase to counteract increases inproduction prices.
(3) The elimination ofall discounts previously deducted from posted prices.
The Shah wasaspiring to be the dominant force in the region, following the
British government's decision to withdraw from the Persian Gulf by the endof
1971. To advertise this ambition inNovember 1971he annexed Abu Musa and

the Tumb Islands, claimed and possessed by Sharja and Ras al-Khaima respec
tively, at the entrance to the Persian Gulf. Colonel Qadafli responded by
nationalizing BP's (the former AIOC) assets in Libya. The Shah embarked on a
massive military build-up, which hebelieved hecould afford with the revenue
increases from therise in oilprices. The interplay of oil revenues with foreign
affairs wasno less close than its connection with domestic policies.
The Shah's aggressiveness was resented by Arab countries within and
without OPEC, particularly Saudi Arabia, whose Oil Minister, Shaikh Zaki
Yamani, was notintimidated because of the massive crude oilreserves andthe
productive capacity of his country, aswell asthe experience and support of the
four major American oil companies operating there. Whilst Shaikh Yamani
from 1971 to 1973 was endeavouring to persuade theoilcompanies to partici
pate in partnership agreements with the oil producing states, the Shah was
striving toexorcise the spectre offoreign influence over the Iranian oil industry.
By a number of shrewd political manoeuvres, anunexpected temporary break
down due to sabotage in the pipeline from Saudi Arabia tothe eastern Mediter
ranean and because of tight market demand, heforced theConsortium in July
1973 to renegotiate its privileged position in the Iranian oil industry and
relinquish its operations in Iran in return for a twenty year supply agreement.
At a Press Conference in London on 24 June 1972 he forecast "a better
relationship with members of the Consortium, a period of close collaboration
and co-operation with oil companies which I think is in theinterests of both
parties, and certainly is in ourinterest . . . ourrelationship with them is a new
kind of relationship, between free partners. They respect ourrights and we do
the same with them."31 A programme was elaborated of increased productive
capability, more exploration, the relinquishment of the Abadan refinery to
NIOC and the prolongation ofthe contractual duration toits fullest extent. The
detente in oilrelations with theConsortium lasted for some six months before
the Shah imposed his conditions for anykind of continuing relationship ata
meeting with Consortium representatives in Saint Moritz. He stated in January
1973 that "there are two courses ofaction open tousnow. Since we are the kind
of people who know our contracts, one choice isto letthe companies continue
their operations for the next six years up to 1979, provided that the total earnings
from each barrel of our oil are not less than those earned by other regional
countries, provided our exporting capacity is increased to eight million barrels
of oil perday . . . Alternatively, a new contract could be signed which would

return to Iran all the responsibilities and other things which are not at present in
Iran's hands."32
After serving notice of his intentions andfurther discussions with representa
tives ofthe Consortium heannounced at the ceremonial inauguration of the
Soviet-built steel mill near Isfahan on 16 March 1973 that Iran had secured
"complete and real ownership and management . . . the major foreign oil
companies will become mere customers ofthe quantities ofoil we are able to
supply them."33 Also included inhis speech were disparaging remarks about
Musaddiq. On the day when hehad fulfilled his father's steel dream, he was
enjoying adouble success of independence. ASale and Purchase Agreement was
signed on 31 July 1973and ratified by the Majlis. Its main provisions included:
All exploration, extraction and refining activities and installations were to come under Iranian control. A Service Company registered in Iran andsubject to Iranian regulations would perform certain technical functions in relation to exploration andextraction fora period offive years only. Control ofoil reserves was tobe transferred from the former Consortium toIran. Iran assumed the rights to allgasreserves in theAgreements Area, andcomplete control of gas exports, with anoption open to theformer Consortium to secure a 5 0% share of the operation for the export ofgas through Persian Gulf ports. Iran was guaranteed per-barrel profits atleast equal to those secured by other Persian Gulf oil producing states.
The Consortium relationship seemed tohave served its purpose, but it had
residual responsibility with a company, owned by itself, the Oil Service Com
pany of Iran (OSCO), which had afive year service contract with NIOC. OSCO
had responsibility for operations inthe former Consortium area related to (1)
exploration, development and production of crude oiland natural gas; (2)
natural gas liquids processing and; (3) transportation to and loading at the
several crude oil and product export terminals. OSCO also acted as a technical
and purchasing advisory organization forNIOC. A major programme was

decision was reached by the end of1978. The Consortium had brought Iranian
oil back into the marketplace again and ensured the technical development of

in the world. Proficient Iranian technicans and technical experts from members
of the Consortium hadcollaborated with understanding andconviction in
advanced petroleum technology. The activities of the Consortium had been vital
to the recovery of the Iranian oilindustry, restoring the balance between its
undoubted political importance and itsneed fortechnical efficiency.
The Consortium contributed greatly tothe infrastructure ofthe Iranian oil
industry by its capital investment between 1954 and 1977. Production increased
sevenfold intwenty years, from 1957 to 1977, and it sustained a good drilling
performance, a tenfold increase from 1957 to 1962, reaching nearly amillion feet
in 1975. Employment in relation to national manpower figures wassmall
because the oil industry iscapital- not labour-intensive and highly automated.
The most spectacular achievement was the Cham Project, an initial investment
of $150 million forthe development ofvast oil export facilities. These linked
firstly the fields of Gach Saran and Agha Jari by large diameter submerged
pipelines with tank farms on Kharg Island and loading jetties there. Moreover,
the products processed by the refinery at Abadan were connected with export
terminals situated on the Khaur Musa inlet atBandar Mah Shahr 67 miles east of
Abadan. By 1978 six pipelines from 30 inch to 5 2 inch went from Ganava on the
coast to Kharg Island where there were 13 tanks with aneffective capacityof
8,5 94 million barrels of light crude and 19 of 8,663 million barrels of heavy crude
oil and 10 loading berths forthe largest tankers. The design and construction
were vast in scale to satisfy most of the projected productive capacity of 6 million
bbi/day of crude oil from the southern oil fields of Iran. The central location of
Ganava and Kharg Island with respect to these oil fields is shown in map 15.
The National Iranian OilCompany was directly responsible for (1) the
domestic marketing of all petroleum products except lubricants; (2) inter
national marketing of crude oilsales; (3) controlling the domestic refining of
five refineries; (4) managing an extensive and expanding crude oil and product
pipeline network of some 10,000 kilometres; (5)provision of all non-basic
services, such as housing, medical care, welfare activities; (6) production from
the Naft-i Shah field; and (7)exploration and production in NIOC reserved
areas.
In Autumn 1973, atight oil-supply position developed leading to higher and
rising oilprices. The representatives of the major oilcompanies and OPEC
negotiators failed toreach an agreement on oil prices ataround $7 a barrel at a
meeting inVienna, September-October 1973. Shortly afterwards, ata specially
convened meeting of OPEC in Kuwait on 11 October, the momentous decision
was taken byOPEC to set oil prices themselves. Meantime, the Yom Kippur

war had broken out on 6 October which further exacerbated the supply situation
following selective Arab oil embargoes sanctioned on 17 October. This reduced
Arab oil supplies by 25 per cent, enough to cause panic buying and soaring spot
market prices upto $17.34 a barrel. Then, at another conference in Tehran in
December 1973 theShah took the occasion to upstage hisother OPEC col
leagues and announce another formal increase incrude oil prices to $11,875 a
barrel despite Saudi Arabian opposition. The Shah's ambitions for Iran in the
1970s following his White Revolution of the 1960s, provided his justification for
sevenfold oil price rises inthe five years between 1971 and 1976 (see Appendix
7)
These increases, whilst they did not alone cause the years of creeping
depression inthe industrialized countries and financial pressure inmany ofthe
Third World countries, nevertheless gradually resulted in checking the rising
demand for oil. The Shah was atthe pinnacle of his oil power. Yet, prices began
to fall in relative terms in 1976. The Iranian economy suffered. Oil production in
197 5was down by over 11%, adrop of some $3 billion in Iran's budgeted oil and
gas revenues of $21.4 billion outof a total of $27.6 billion. Revenue from
Consortium members amounted to some $17.4 million, over 81% oftotaloil
revenues. Itwas the collapse of the Shah's regime and the outbreak of the Iran
Iraq war in 1981 which took the OPEC market price of Saudi Arabian light to its
peak of$34 abarrel. Between 1957 and 1975 Iranian oil income had grown 100
fold to $20 billion annually.
Domestic affairs
NIOC activities were widespread for it was the hub ofthe Iranian oil industry
(see figure 2). From 1951 when the oil fields and the refinery at Abadan were
mainly on a care and maintenance basis, limited operations forinternal con
sumption requirements were kept going. After 1954 the NIOC provided
increasing supplies ofpetroleum products to the domestic market; fuel oilfor
power raising, gasoline and diesel oil for the rapidly increasing use of cars,
lorries and coaches over the long distance roads ofIran, which were gradually
knitting together the dispersed rural areas with the capital and larger towns, and
aviation spirit forthe expanding internal airservices.34 These developments,
which included supplies of light oil products for heating and cooking purposes,
certainly contributed to an improving standard of living and virtually

eliminated earlier reliance on charcoal inall but the most inaccessible areas of
population.
The increasing prosperity of the country resulted in a growing internal
consumption of petroleum products in comparison with other sources of
energy. Associated with this was the extension of the pipeline network to cover
more ofthe country, some 4,500 kms in 1976, and the construction of new
refineries in Tehran (1968 and 1974), Shiraz (1973), Tabriz (1974) and Isfahan.
Between 1950 and 1979 there was anenlargement ofdistribution operations
(see Table 4). By 1976 some 8,000 NIOC employees were engaged, practically
half the workforce, in distribution activities, which were administratively
divided into five main areas, of which the northern area took two thirds of the
four major products. An analysis of Iranian oil demand between i960 and 1974
shows an annual growth rate of 13% overall with residential and commercial
usage predominating, followed by an increasing share of the industrial sector
and a fairly constant share taken by road transport. Some idea of the volume and
range ofproducts refined with their respective deliveries for exports ortheir
supply for internal consumption from 1957 to 1972 may be gained from

Complementing these internal activities, NIOC engaged inother activities
abroad, going unsuccessfully into partnership in an area of the North Sea with
British Petroleum (BP) in 1972. In 1975 it entered another concessionary
partnership with BP and others, toexplore for oil on the continental shelf of
Western Greenland, again without success, but the managerial exposure and
experience were useful. The National Iranian Tanker Company was established
in 1955, but not until the mid-1970s did it grow with the acquisition of four
ocean-going tankers. Itordered two supertankers (230,000 tons dwt each) from
Japan and was associated with BP in ajoint tanker company in 1976, the Irano
British Shipping Company. At the end of1978 the fleet included seven vessels,
totalling some one million deadweight tons. Besides its exploration and ship
ping interests, NIOC participated in two joint venture refineries abroad and
some distribution activities. Thus in 1969 NIOC took a 14 percent shareholding
with AMOCO (14%) and the Indian Government (72%) in the 58,000 b/d

refinery at Madras and had a 24.5% share in the adjacent Madras Fertilizer
Company. NIOC had a 17.5 % shareholding inthe Sasolburg 75,000 b/d refinery
in South Africa. In 1974 NIOC exported 1.1m and 1.9m tons of crude oil tothese
two refineries respectively. Yet, it actually proved more difficult than it seemed
to escape from reliance on the Consortium for export sales. A small direct
distribution relationship was negotiated with Afghanistan over aviation spirit
for the airports at Kabul and Qandahar.
Meantime, another activity associated with the oil industry, indeed part ofit,
contributing to the general national euphoria of the early 1970s, was the
exploitation ofthe vast gas resources ofthe country. The National Iranian Gas
Company, nominally under the control of NIOC, was established in 1966, but by
1977 along with National Petrochemical Company had become virtually
autonomous. Formany years gaswas separated from oil and flared because it
was difficult to handle with its volatile constituents, and there was only a very
limited market for its successful utilization. Gradually over the years on an
increasing but nonetheless small scale, gas was used in refining and production
activities as fuel forfurnaces. Slowly gas technology improved and its transpor
tation over long distances under pressure orby liquefaction became possible in
commercial quantities. It was also re-injected into the oilreservoirs for second
ary recovery. Liquefied gas had been utilized inIran in 195 5forthe first time and
in 1963 a 10-inch pipeline supplied gas toShiraz from the oil field atGach Saran.
In 1966gas became an important counter in the diplomatic exchanges
between Iran and the Soviet Union when anagreement forfifteen years for the
export of gas from Iran to Russia was concluded on 13January at a price of 6
roubles (1 rouble = $1.11) a thousand cu.ft. at Astara on the Iranian—Russian
border. Under Iranian pressure the Russians subsequently and reluctantly
agreed torevisions, bringing the cost up tonearly 20 roubles by 1978. Relations
between Iran and the Soviet Union were both close and distant during the last
two decades ofthe Pahlavl period. The Shah visited Moscow inJuly 1956 but in
195 8 he rebuffed Nikita Krushchev over his negotiations forabilateral pact with
the United States and he brusquely dismissed aRussian delegation inearly 1959.
The Russians riposted with undisguised hostility, but this abated after Septem
ber 1962, when Iran informed them that "noforeign power will be given the
right to have bases for missiles of any type on Iranian soil."
This reassurance was welcome to the Soviet Union and was followed by an
Iran—Russian Co-operation Agreement signed on 27July 1963. The Russians
pledged economic assistance in constructing dams with power plants and
irrigation facilities, and the building ofgrain silos ona 12 year credit. This was

acceptable but modest. The Shah was angling for bigger fish and the Russians,
after the breach with the Chinese, were looking for more export outlets for their
heavy industry. When western companies shied away from the Shah's steel mill
project and the World Bank refused funds, atthe end of1964 he invited Russian
experts to do a feasibility study, on which they reported favourably.
In mid 1965the Shah visited Moscow and proposed that the steel mill project,
instead of being financed by credits, should be paid for by supplies of gas, which
would bedelivered to the Soviet Union bya large diameter pipeline from the
southern oilfields, from which it would be pumped northwards tothe Russian
border. The Iranian Gas Trunkline (IGAT) was completed and operational in
1970, with an annual capacity of 10 billion cubic metres up to 1985. An
international consortium designed and constructed the facilities, which in
volved gas gathering centres inthe southern oil fields and the construction of a
40-42-inch large, 1100 km pipeline with nine pumping stations from the
oilfields northerly through Iran to the Russian border. After the line became
operational in 1970 anumber ofspur lines in 1974 connected cities like Tehran,
Isfahan, Ahvaz and the Alburz area with gas supplies from the main trunk line
system. Pilot plant locations were also tested for the construction of further lines
to village communities and specially designed industrial sites.
The Russians were initially sceptical about the practicality of the project and
were doubtful about becoming dependent on Iran for some of their energy
supplies, but their own southern supplies of gas for the industrialized regions of
Transcaucasia were declining. Thus there were predictable commercialand
diplomatic advantages in completing such an advanced development, providing
an opportunity for an impressive installation ofRussian heavy industry andan
example ofinternational collaboration. Gas supplies were also an insurance for
the payment ofand support for the steel mill, for which the normal trade ofthe
two countries was quite inadequate. For the Shah itwas economically preferable
to utilize the gas than flare itwastefully. Diplomatically, asensible flirtation with
the Russians would excite some jealousy from the United States. Above all, the
gas agreement facilitated theconstruction of the steel mill, a long coveted
industrial undertaking of prestigious pride. It is also undeniable that the
amelioration of Iran—Russian relations and economic co-operation was founded
upon their mutual interests converging on thegas pipeline.
Another purpose of this expensive and technically difficult project was to
diversify domestic energy supplies and provide the basis for the application of an
ambitious programme for national gas consumption. Nevertheless, it was of
doubtful profit at first, before being revised and until adequate provision was

taken into account for investment costs and the returns based on fuel oil prices.
However, with the discoveries of further natural gas reserves in the early 1970s it
was decided in 1975 to proceed with another ambitious gas pipeline providing
Russia with more gas supplies, which inturn would allow more gas from its
more northerly sources to flow to Europe. The capacity of the second pipeline
was double the first and estimates for completion were $i—$bn at 1978 prices.
Plans and contracts were drawn up on 30 November 1975 and revised later in
1976 to deliver 600 billion cu.ft. from a southern field near Bushire to a
consortium of European companies at the Russian border for onward transmis
sion to Europe by Russian pipelines. It was never implemented because the idea
was shelved after the establishment of the Islamic Republic. In 1977 the Russians
purchased 2.2 million tonnes ofoil, an interesting development.
The discovered gas reserves ofIran have enormous potential value tothe
Iranian economy. They rank second only to those of Russia and exceed the total
reserves ofall other Middle East countries together. In 1977 gas exports to
Russia were 327.0 billion cu.ft. A project for the export of liquefied natural gas
(LNG) by Kangan Liquefied Natural Gas Company (Kalingas) originatingin
1972 between six foreign partners and NIGC was proceeding in spite of rising
costs and the dropping out of most of the foreign partners. Unfortunately, final
agreement had notbeen reached by 1978, after which it was abandoned.
Additionally, another major natural gas project was under way in the 1970s to
develop the gas reserves discovered at Khangiran near Sarakhs not far from
Mashhad, where initially most ofthe gas was to beconsumed. It has to be
remembered that large volumes of gas have also been utilized in gas injection
programmes in some of the oil fields to increase oil recovery rates. In 1976 some
18 per cent of all gas produced was reinjected and ithad risen to 30 per cent in
1977 (for Iranian gas statistics for 1977 see Appendix 8.)
Thus, Iran was engaging in extremely advanced and massive technical
enterprises in association with foreign contractors, but the gestation period was
prolonged and their cost effectiveness was doubtful. When the country was
afflicted by cash flow problems inthe late 1970s, the delay inthe returnson
investment helped to exacerbate aworsening financial situation and precipitate
an economic crisis. Included in this pressure along with the gas ventures was the
development of the Iranian petrochemical industry. There was every incentive
to participate inthe manufacture ofpetrochemicals, given the availabilityof
natural gas as a feedstock and the waste involved in flaring it, toimplement a
policy of increasing the added value of exports, to respond to the need to
diversify the industrial base and to upgrade the use of oil. So, in 1965 the
684

THE NATIONAL IRANIAN OIL COMPANY
National Petrochemical Company of Iran was formed as asubsidiary of NIOC.
The first working plant had already been established at Marvdasht near Shiraz in
1963, the Iran Fertilizer Company, in conjunction with French interests and was
opened by General de Gaulle. Inthe late 1960s a $iobn programme over ten
years was planned to establish a major export-led petrochemical industry in Iran
in collaboration with foreign interests who would bemostly responsiblefor
technical expertise and marketing skills.
By 1975, apart from the Shiraz fertilizer plant, there were five other main
petrochemical complexes operational and functioning under the control of NPC
alone or in collaboration with foreign partners. A massive petrochemical
programme costing some $3bn was under way inthe late 1970s, including the
world's largest contemplated petrochemical investment, a joint Iranian—Japa
nese venture at Bandar Shapur costing $1.83 3m with an estimated annual
production of3.2 million tons of products. This was not completed at the time
of writing but the scale of the project can be imagined from the fact that the total
production in 1975 from theexisting sixplants, Iran Fertilizer Company,
Abadan Petrochemical Company (B.F Goodrich 26%), Shapur Chemical Com
pany, Kharg Chemical Company (AMOCO subsidiary ofStandard Oil Com
pany, Indiana 50%) and Iran Carbon Company (Cabot Corporation 50%), was
producing some 1.79m tons of products. These included urea, ammonium
nitrate, nitric acid, soda ash, caustic soda, PVC, sulphur, sulphuric acid, phos
phoric acid, propane, butane and carbon black, most of which was consumed
domestically. Some five private companies, mostly with some foreign invest
ment, forthe manufacture of polyester, nylon and acrylic fibres, resins and
moulding compounds were operating by1979.
All these formidable projects (which encountered financial, constructional
and manpower problems) were part ofthe industrialized base ofthe "Great
Civilization". Itis, in retrospect, easy to be cynical about the realization of this
advanced and far-reaching industrial ambition. There was a strong element of
national pride which regarded the advice to adopt intermediate technology as an
insult. The confidence of most Iranian forecasters coincided with the conviction
of most foreign contractors and investors in continuing economic growth.
There was some caution about, but little warning of an impending depression,
which would threaten Iranian financial calculations anddisturb economic
prospects. Up to 1976 there was almost aglobal conspiracy of optimism. Then
the attractions of instant industrialization began to fade in the face of the
escalating cost and thecapital-intensive nature of the undertakings, com
pounded by the shortage of skilled manpower and additional expenditure on the

necessary energy, administrative and social infrastructure on largely "green"
sites. On aminor scale this would have been aprivate inconvenience but with
state involvement the repercussions were more penetratingly critical. More
over, the advanced technology, the capital requirements and the large market
needed induced a higher volume to achieve theeconomies of scale, andincrease
the margin ofreturn, setting up a vicious circle ofcompetitive pressures.
There were arguments among the Iranian planners about the opportunity
cost factor, andtension in thecouncils of state over theformulation ofan energy
policy which, if it existed, might have reconciled thedifferent options proposed.
It became politically easier to postpone rather than take decisions, in the hope
that it would be possible to spend one's way out ofcontroversial dilemmas.
Most economists contend that theplanning process failed to perform its
function because of the magnitude of its task and the failure in its direction.35
This was certainly true ofthe revised Fifth Plan which, practically riderless,
galloped out of control with disastrous results for the political economy ofthe
country. In the original plan oil revenues were 47 per cent but rose fivefold in
value to 80percent in the revised plan (seeTable 7, p. 630).Different ministries
disagreed on priorities andstrength of ministerial personality or accessibility to
the Shah became the criterion of budget allocation or personal influence. The
administrative machinery wasinadequate for the load itwascarrying in sucha
personalized system and political arbitration wastoo centralized to be effective
in such conditions. Factional in-fighting absorbed more attention than solving
the difficulties of bottlenecks, port congestion, shortages of transportation,
scarcity ofhousing, power cuts etc. Corruption had a corrosive influence.
The moment the modernization programme seemed to be faltering, its
opponents siezed theopportunity to show their opposition to the abandonment
of the traditional employment ofeconomic resources andpower inthebazaar, or
to make theShah responsible for theeconomic downturn which hadoccurred.It
is perhaps the final paradox of the Pahlavl period that it was the oil revenues
which ushered inthe modernizing achievements ofRiza Shah, but it was an
excess ofthose revenues which presaged the decline andfall ofits over ambitious
and over personalized regime. It was ironical that the oil workers, who were
regarded as patriotic in mounting strikes against APOC in 1929 and AIOC in
1946 and 1951, were prominent among those whogave the coup degrace tothe
Shah's government at theendof 1978.36 Thecurtailment of oil exports began in
35 Moghtader, "The Impact". 36 Fesharaki, "Revolution and Energy Policy". See also Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani, Revolution and Energy Policies in Iran.

late October 1978 because of unrest atthe Kharg Island and Lavan terminals,
when workers protested at the imposition of martial law and called forthe
replacement of foreign technicians by those from Iran. To underline the message
one such technician was murdered. The September average production of 6. im
b/d fell to 1.4m b/d in the first half of November, recovered to 3.5m b/d and then
gradually dropped throughout December, when offshore production stopped.
Exports ceased on 26 December and by the beginning of January 1979 produc
tion was only averaging about 250,000 b/d for internal purposes. This caused
industrial disruption and the virtual cessation of supplies for transportation. It
was asignificant demonstration of industrial strength and political opposition,
indicating the plight of the Shah when set against the previous successful period.
It would be tempting, but probably unfair, to see the Iranian oil industry as a
symbol of progress and nemesis forthe Pahlavi period. It had served as a
national broom sweeping away a resented foreign presence, but whilst that may
have been politically desirable, it was not really feasible forlong, given the
general levels of technical education in Iran. It might once have been possible to
have praised the oil industry foritstriumph of modernization over the tra
ditional approach to economic affairs, but neither of these judgments reaches to
the heart of the matter. For all the attempts of both Shahs and their advisersto
promote the idea that Iran could pursue policies of grandeur with little reference
to the rest of the world, the oil industry is in the highest degree international and
interdependent, subject tothe principles ofsupply and demand, even if these
might be manipulated for short periods. Many of the problems and opportuni
ties ofthe Iranian oil industry were comparable and similar tothose in other
countries at different times.
It was certainly obvious in the mid 1970s, and to some even before, that too
much was being attempted too quickly. Unfortunately a rentier-type political
economy frequently takes for granted its productive base without paying
sufficient attention to industrial productivity, managerial competenceand
agricultural enterprise and, unduly complacent towards its own success, seldom
contemplates the problems of the future. When the whole process is compressed
into an unrealistic timescale and financially dependent upon a single resource,
whose price is ultimately influenced by market forces, there is the possibility of
the spinning-top of national economy slowing down, wobbling or falling over.
When oil revenues began to decline inthe middle 1970s and when national
expenditure was at its greatest and the pressure on national resources unprece
dented, itwas not just the demurrage charges at Iranian ports or the bottlenecks
in transportation which affected the economy and dispelled the myth of continu

ous progress. Italso involved the failure of power supplies in the capital, which
stopped thelifts andruined thecontents of the deep freezes, spoiling the lifestyle
of the privileged. These developments lead tofrustration and disillusion with
the proclaimed objectives ofthe "Great Civilization". This programme, the
centrepiece of the Shah's achievement, was funded upon massive financial
investment almost wholly derived from oil revenues. Itexacerbated the effects
of an infrastructure inadequate to cope with the prodigious projects envisaged,
accelerating inflation and precipitating social deprivation that resulted from
serious migration from the rural areas to towns in search ofemployment in
industry and services, to the neglect of agriculture.
The resulting stresses and strains, coupled with political insensitivity which
encountered determined opposition, were a major factor in the collapse of the
monarchy.37 Oil wasboth the trump card and joker in the Pahlavl hand; amixed
blessing.38 Whatever the glamour of its political power, oilis essentially a
commercial commodity inthe exchange oftrade. The question posed by the
Sbah in October 1976remains aproblem for Iran: "What, then is going to take
the place of our oil? What is going to replace our oil income, which now enables
us to give so many services tothe nation?" Oil was the catalyst in the national
development of modern industralized Iran during the Pahlavl period.

Ina cautionary assessment Fred Halliday concluded that Iran's oil-lead growth in 1979 "though not inevitably catastrophic iscertainly farfrom optimistic", Iran: Dictatorship and Development, p.140.

CHAPTER I 9
RELIGIOUS FORCES IN EIGHTEENTH- AND
NINETEENTH-CENTURY IRAN
The Safavid period marks anobvious watershed inthe religious history of Iran
in that it witnesses the elevation of Twelver Shicism to the position of state
religion and the practical fusion ofIran and Shfism into asingle religio-national
entity. Although the proximate causes of this process are to be sought ina
Turkmen military invasion of Iran from the west and north-west, followed by an
influx of Shll scholars from Arab lands, there can benodoubt that a speciesof
marriage between Shicism and the Iranian national consciousness had been
concluded bythe close ofthe Safavid era. The marriage has proved lasting, and
its effects irreversible. Yet theprecise content of the Shicl-Iranian identityand
the forms ofexpression that were tobe assumed byShicism onIranian soil were
not fully formulated inthe Safavid period. Indeed, it was only when the Safavids
were driven from the scene in the first quarter of the 18th century that Iranian
Shicism became emancipated from all essential dependence on the state, and was
able to embark ona process of self-elaboration and internal differentiation that
makes of the post-Safavid period one of great interest and richness. The 18th
century hasbeen called "by far the blackest period in the history of Islamic
Iran",1 and the anarchy that prevailed throughout much of the period goes some
way to justifying this judgement. The 19th century, too, wasoneof almost
uninterrupted socio-political decline, arrested only bythebeginnings of west
ernizing reform. Yetthevitality of religious thought andinterest during the
same period indicates that there is no simple correlation between the two spheres
of life and activity.
The decline of the Safavid state in thelate 17th century coincided with the
career of one of the most prodigious scholars of the whole period, Mulla
Muhammad Baqir Majlisi (d. 1110/1699), whose vast compendium of Imamite
hadith,Bihar al-Anwar, is one of the chief monuments of all ShIcI scholarship. Not

RELIGIOUS FORCES, l8TH AND 19TH CENTURY
only in the capital of Isfahan, where Majlisi and his pupils lived, but also in a host
of provincial centres, learning continued to flourish into the early decades of the
18th century. The remarkable discipline of hikmat —a fusion of the esoteric
dimension of Shicism with Neo-Platonism and the Sufism of Ibn Arab! — was
cultivated by such figures as Maulana Muhammad Sadiq Ardistani and Jamal al
Din Khwansari, as an adjunct to the exoteric sciences of religion.2
In one respect, however, the destinies of Shici scholarship and the Safavid
state in the early 18th century were intertwined. There took place a recrudescene
of the same militant hostility to SunnI Islam that had marked the beginning of
the Safavid dominion, and this proved fateful both for the dynasty and for the
centres of learning it had established and patronized. Since military realities
precluded an attack on the Ottomans, the main target of sectarian hatred was
furnished by Sunn! minorities living on the fringes of the Safavid realm: the
Kurds, Baluchis and above all the Afghans. As if to make matters deliberately
worse, the instrument chosen for the affliction of the Afghans consisted of
Georgian mercenaries, either Christian or only superficially Islamized. When
Mir Vais, leader of the Ghilzai Afghans centred on Qandahar, visited Isfahan in
1120/1707, he was exposed to insult as a SunnI. He travelled on to Mecca, taking
with him certain Shicl books that contained matter abhorrent to Sunnis.
Showing these to the scholars at the Kacba, he obtained a fatva authorizing
rebellion against the Safavids.3 The rebellion began with a slaughter of the Shici
minority in Qandahar, and ended with the capture and destruction of the Safavid
capital in 1135/1722, and the virtual extinction of the Safavid dynasty.
Iranian Shicism thus lost the dynasty that had fostered it, and for the first time
since the brief reign of IsmacU II (984/1576-985/1577), who had manifested
proto-Sunni tendencies,4 the supremacy of Shicism was placed in doubt. During
their brief and unstable rule, the Afghan conquerors sought to have their control
of Iran legitimized by the approval of the Ottomans, and even hinted at caliphal
ambitions, claiming descent from the Quraish.5 Nadir Shah, who displaced the
Afghans and initially acted in the name of the Safavids, posed a more persistent
challenge to Shici hegemony in Iran by seeking a revision of the very nature of
Shicism.
Nadir Shah first adumbrated his proposed reforms at the gathering he
convened on the plain of Mughan on the occasion of his self-elevation to the

throne in 1148/1736. He declared that his exercise of rule would require
abandonment by the ShIcIs of two of the practices traditionally most offensive to
SunnI sentiment: the ceremonial vilification of Abu Bakr and cUmar, as well as
other Companions of the Prophet, and rejection of the legitimacy of the first
three Caliphs. Purged of these excrescences, Shicism was henceforth to be
known as the Jacfari mazhab, both to efface the connotations of sectarianism the
word Shicl inevitably carried, and to facilitate the absorption of the reformed
school into the main body of Islam as a fifth SunnI mazhab. "This ShIcI mazhab,
which is contrary to that of our noble forebears, must be abandoned. Since,
however, his excellency the Imam Jacfar ibn Muhammad al-Sadiq, upon whom
be peace, is a true Imam [imambafoaqq],let the Iranians follow the path of that
excellent one in the branches of the Law \Jurucat-isharciyya\."6
Coercion and fear were able to secure at least outward compliance. At
Mughan, only Mirza Abu Dl-Hasan Mullabashi was imprudent enough to object,
and even he thought he had voiced his opposition in private. Denounced by a
spy, he was put to death.7 It is to be presumed that the consent of the culama to
Nadir's proposals was made possible by their recourse to traditional taqiya
(prudential dissimulation). None of them ventured to write in support of
Nadir's measures, and the mullabashi he appointed, Mulla All Akbar Talaqani,
appears to have been a man of little scholarly accomplishment, recommended to
the sovereign chiefly by his pliancy and willingness to serve. He shared his
master's fate, being assassinated on the same day in 1160/1747.8
Even a more active espousal of his religious policies by the Iranian culama
would not have fully satisfied Nadir Shah, for he also sought recognition of the
Jacfari mazhab by the Ottomans as a legitimate and authentic school oifiqh and
an equal of the four Sunn! mazhabs. This external dimension of his religious
policies first became apparent in the peace negotiations with the Ottomans that
came soon after the coronation at Mughan. It was demanded of Gene Ali Pa§a,
the Ottoman envoy, that the Ottomans should recognize the Jacfari mazhab and
as outward sign of their recognition permit the erection of a fifth maqam
("station") at the Kacba, similar to the maqams of the SunnI schools. A related
demand was that the Ottomans should permit a separate hajj caravan to convey
Iranian pilgrims to Mecca, under the command of an Iranian amir al-hajj.9
Mulla All Akbar Talaqani accompanied Gene Ali Pa§a to Istanbul for further

discussion of the matter with representatives of the Ottoman culama. Eight
sessions took place in this initial exchange of views, but no sign emerged of
Ottoman willingness to accede to Nadir's demands. He repeated them on several
occasions and delegations travelled back and forth between Istanbul and Iran.
At no time, however, was it even likely that the Ottomans would recognize the
Jacfari mazhab, although at one point Koca Ragip Pa§a, the reis ul-kuttab, seemed
attracted by the possibility of a permanent end to sectarian warfare with Iran.10
Traditions of hostility ran deep, and as late as 1135/1723, the Ottoman
§eyhulislam had declared, in support of a campaign against Iran, that the blood
of male ShIcIs might be legitimately shed and their children and womenfolk
taken captive.11 The Ottoman culama found unacceptable a Shicism that had
been only partially reformed, and that, by the coercive power of the State.
Political considerations were equally important. The Ottomans had refused
to legitimize the Afghan conquerors of Iran, despite their indubitable Sunni
affiliations, and they were even more reluctant to permit Nadir Shah to establish
an energetic and expansionist state to their east. His military prowess had proved
itself from the Caucasus to Delhi, and with the disability of Shicism removed, he
might well have aspired to rule over a broad Islamic realm that transcended the
frontiers of Iran.
Only in one instance was Nadir Shah able to obtain Sunni approval of the
Jacfari mazhab, and apparent recognition of it as the simple equivalent of one of
the four Sunni mazhabs. During his protracted campaign in Arab Iraq in 1156/
1743, Nadir Shah convened a meeting of Sunni and ShIcIculama at Najaf with the
purpose of reconciling the two groups and grafting the branch of the Jacfarl
mazhab onto the trunk of Sunni Islam. The chief spokesman for the ShIcI culama
was Mulla CA1IAkbar Talaqani, while the Sunnls were represented by the culama
of Bukhara and Afghanistan. At Nadir's request, the governor of Baghdad
delegated Shaikh cAbd-Allah al-Suwaidi, Hanafi qa^l of the city, to observe the
discussions and arbitrate between the participants. Argument centered on
mukaffirat— matters of ShIcI doctrine and practice found heretical by the Sunnls.
Four items were mentioned by Hadi Khwaja, qazi of Bukhara; the vilification of
Abu Bakr and cUmar; the declaration of almost all the Companions to have been
apostates; the practice of temporary marriage; and denial of the legitimacy of the
first three Caliphs. Mulla CA1I Akbar replied that the first two had been
abandoned since the beginning of Nadir Shah's rule; and that temporary

marriages were contracted "only by idiots". As for the fourth point, he
promised that in future the Shlcis would give satisfaction to their Sunnl
brethren. After certain other Sunnl arguments and objections had been met, the
Shici culama promised to abandon definitively all that Had! Khwaja had men
tioned, and the Sunn! culama undertook for their part to cease regarding the
Shicis as unbelievers.12
In reality, the meeting was quite inconclusive. The Ottoman learned estab
lishment was unrepresented on the Sunnl side, and it is probable that the Sunnl
scholars of Bukhara and Afghanistan were hardly less subject to constraint by
Nadir than were their ShIcI counterparts. It has also been suggested that Nadir
deliberately refrained from inviting the most prominent Shici scholars resident
in Najaf, preferring instead to rely on his obedient mullabashl.X2> The agreement
obtained at Najaf thus represented neither Sunnl nor Shici aspirations; it was
merely an attempt at state manipulation of religion.
In 1159/1746, Nadir Shah finally concluded peace with the Ottomans,
renouncing his demand for recognition of the Jacfari mazhab, and he was
assassinated soon after. His successors, who managed for a time to retain control
of his capital Mashhad and adjacent areas of Khurasan, showed no interest in the
project of the Jacfarl mazhab, and it died with its originator. Nadir's motives in
promoting a revision of Shicism may safely be presumed to have been political;
there is no evidence of personal piety in his life. He told al-Suwaidl that he
intended to lead Iran back to pure Sunnism by stages, but the truth of this may be
doubted.14 One Iranian Sunnl community, the Shaficis of Lar, certainly regarded
him with no sympathy.15 Although we have suggested that one of the most
notable developments of the eighteenth century is the emancipation of Shicism
from dependence on the state, a certain religiously tinted loyalist sentiment
toward the Safavids did persist for some time after the downfall of the dynasty.
Traces of it are to be found even in the early nineteenth century. The revision of
Shicism was one means whereby Nadir might hope to suppress or break that
sentiment. His confiscation of the extensive vaqj'lands around Isfahan should be
seen in the same light, for it too tended to dissolve a visible link between the
religious establishment and the departed Safavid dynasty. It should be men
tioned too that the majority of his soldiery was recruited from the Sunnl
borderlands of Iran, and it was necessary to accommodate their religious
susceptibilities by the suppression of the more objectionable features of Shicism.
12 A detailed account of the occasion is provided by Abd-Allah al-Suwaidl in al-Hujaj al-Qafiyya.

RELIGIOUS FORCES, l8TH AND I9TH CENTURY
Finally, as the last of the great military conquerors of West Asia, Nadir Shah
doubtless sought to rule over an empire whose population would have been
mostly SunnI; he wished to revise Shfism in the light of that ambition.
His failure is to be attributed not only to political contingencies, but also to
the fact that he implicitly demanded abandonment of the very essence of Shicism:
its Imamology, with all the spiritual and doctrinal consequences that flow
therefrom. To present Jacfar al-Sadiq as having been an Imam in the same sense
as Abu Hanifa was a verbal sleight of hand that had no chance of passing
unnoticed. Concentration on the Imams as the divinely appointed and charis
matic guides of the ShicT community, with a cosmic function that by far
transcended the codification of legal principles, continued unabated, and in fact
inspired a whole series of new doctrinal definitions and insights that proliferated
long after Nadir Shah's rule had ended.
The unsoundness of his initiative was demonstrated too by the renewed
establishment of unrevised Shicism as state religion by the next serious
contendant for power in Iran, Karim Khan Zand. Each of the twelve districts of
Shiraz, Karim Khan's seat of rule, was held to be under the patronage of one of
the Twelve Imams, who was formally commemorated every Thursday
evening.16 Coins were struck in the names of the Imams, and the Friday khutba
began with the invocation of blessings upon them.17 Welcome though this
reassertion of state loyalty to Shicism must have been to the culama, it remains
true that the close association of state and religion had been irretrievably broken
by the downfall of the Safavids. Before the Safavid period, Shicism had existed
almost always as a minority persuasion, one infused moreover with esoteric
intent. Alliance with the state in the Safavid period had been something of an
anomaly, one made necessary for attaining a secure position of hegemony in
Iran. Once this position had been reached and autonomy secured, the necessity
came to an end. The religious policies of Nadir Shah and Karim Khan Zand both
served, in their differing ways, to emphasize the permanence and autonomy of
Shfism in Iranian soil. From the firm roots it had struck, Shicism continued to
put forth numerous branches; and it became apparent that the Shicism of Iran,
far from being a mazhab capable of assimilation with SunnI Islam, contained
within itself a variety of mazhabs.
First among the instances of internal differentiation that took place in the
Shicism of the late 18th and early 19th centuries was that furnished by the
16 William Francklin, p. 199. 17 Abu'l-Hasan Gulistana, p. 460; Mlrza Hasan HusainI Fasa'T, p. 219.

struggle between the Akhbarl and Usuli schools of fiqh. Their dispute was
apparently centred on the principles and methodology of fiqh, and above allon
the related issues oitaqtid— submission to the directives of the learned in matters
of religious law- and ijtihad— the exercise of rational judgment by the learned in
the application of religious law. The Akhbaris rejected both principles, holding
that the entire community, learned and non-learned alike, should submit
exclusively to the guidance of the Imams, and contending that legal reasoning
was a borrowing from Hanafi fiqh, alien to Shicism and its strong emphasis on
the authority of the Imams. The Usulis by contrast proclaimed the legitimacy of
submission to the directives of the learned, and of the practice by them of
ijtihad.18 The outcome of this seemingly technical dispute between the two
schools determined the whole spiritual tone of Iranian Shicism as well as its
socio-political expression throughout the 19th century, and can even be said to
be responsible for certain features of the contemporary religious scene in Iran.
The origins of the Akhbari-Usuli divide go far back beyond the 18th century.
Each side in fact identifies its own position as the perennially authentic doctrine
of Shicism, and regards that of the other as an innovation. Akhbarls have seen in
al-Hasan ibn Yusuf ibn Mutahhar (d. 726/1326) "the first who trod the path of
ijtihad", i.e., the first Usuli.19 It has also been suggested that Usulism originates
three centuries earlier with Abu Jacfar al-TusI (d. 460/1067), whowasthe first in
Shicism to expound the permissibility of qiyas(analogical reasoning).20 On the
Usuli side, Mulla Muhammad Amin Astarabadi is generally regarded as the
founder of Akhbarism: "he it is who first divided this salvation-destined [Shici]
community into Usuli and Akhbarl, and evil was his deed", wrote the 18th
century Usull scholar, Yusuf al-Bahrani.21
It may be said that the Akhbarl and Usuli schools represented two possible
responses to the jurisprudential problems caused by the occultation of the
Twelfth Imam. When still on the physical plane, the Imam had been the sole
authentic source of legal guidance and interpretation, but after his occultation
the practical need arose for a new source of direction. One response was to
minimize the need by emphasizing the continuing directive function of the
Imam despite his absence from the physical plane; given the perpetual link
between the Imam and his community, it was not necessary to establish new
processes for the elaboration and implementation of the Law, but only to
18 A detailed discussion of the differences between Akhbarls and Usulls is to be found in Gianroberto Scarcia, "Intorno alle controversie tra Ahbari e Usuli presso gli Imamiti di Persia". 19 Muhammad Amin Astarabadi, quoted in cAbd al-Nabi al-Kazimi, Takmilat al-Rijal 1, p. 314. 20 Corbin, En Islam Iranien iv, p. 249. 21 Shaikh Yusuf al-Bahrani, p. 117.

examine and assimilate the existing sayings and traditions {akhbar). This re
sponse gradually crystallized as the Akhbarl school. The alternative view was
more pragmatically oriented, and saw the need for some institutional guidance
of the community, through the use of ijtihad by the learned, in its implementa
tion of religious ordinances. According to this view, the task of the scholar was
not merely the investigation of akhbar; legal methodology {usut)was of equal
importance. Hence the designation of the Usuli mazhab.
The Akhbarl and Usuli positions remained only partially formulated as long
as Shicism maintained its original nature as a minority persuasion and ShIcI
scholars were not called upon to participate in the administration of a society
with a ShIcI majority. They became gradually more explicit after the triumph of
Iranian Shicism in the Safavid period. It was then that MIrza Muhammad Amln
Astarabadi wrote the chief text of Akhbarism, al-Faw<zidal-Madaniyja, and then
too that one of the earliest Usuli refutations of the book, Niir al-Din Amili's al
Fawa'idal-Makkiyja, waswritten. Throughout most of the period, however, the
state dominated the religious institution with little opposition, and the precise
role of the learned in matters of law was a question of slight practical
importance.
When the nexus between state and religion was severed by the fall of the
Safavids, theculama came to occupy a position of some influence as leaders ofthe
community, one enhanced by the absence of effective political authority
throughout much of the eighteenth century. The Akhbarl and Usuli teachings
became correspondingly sharpened through debate and mutual recrimination,
and the outcome of their contest was endowed with immediate significance.
The decisive stages of the Akhbarl—Usuli controversy took place outside the

and thecatabat- shrine cities — of Iraq. The latter sheltered many Iranian scholars
who had fled from the instability of the immediate post-Safavid period, and
continued indeed to act both as a refuge and as a base of operation for Iranian
culama throughout the 19thcentury. The Akhbaris initially enjoyed a position of
complete dominance in the catabat, to such an extent that anyone carrying with
him books of Usuli fiqh was obliged to cover them up for fear of attack.22 Their
hegemony was brought to an end by the great Usuli scholar, Aqa Muhammad
Baqir Bihbaham (1117/1705—1206/1791), a figure of central importance who
dominated the religious horizon of Iran at the end of the 18th century much as
Mulla Muhammad Baqir MajlisI had done at the end of the 17th. Such, indeed,

was the nature of his achievement that he came to be regarded as the mujaddid
the inspired renewer of religious thought and practice - for the twelfth Hijri
century.
He had come to Karbala in his early youth with his father, and after
completing his studies intended to return to Iran. A dream in which the
Occulted Imam appeared to him dissuaded him from leaving, and he stayed in
Iraq to break the supremacy of the Akhbaris. The means he employed were
various. He wrote a refutation of al-Fawciidal-Madaniyja, entitling it al-Fawa'id
al-Usuliyya^ and taught a number of pupils who themselves expounded the UsulT
position in a number of important works and attained great influence in Iran in
the following decades. But at least as effective as his writing and teaching
activities was his practical vindication of the function of the religious scholar as
arbiter and enforcer of the law. This lesson was learned most effectivel} by his
son, Mirza Muhammad AH Bihbahani (d. 1216/1801), of whom Shaikh Ja faral
Najafi (d. 1227/1812) records that he was constantly accompanied by a ni mber
of armed men who would immediately execute any judgments that he pas id.23
The example set by the younger Bihbahani was to be followed by num :ous
Iranian Lulama.
Bihbahani was the first in the line of great mujtahids — practitioners of ijtihad
that have left their distinctive mark on Iranian history down to the present age.
The vindication and elaboration of the principles of taqlld and ijtihad by hirr md
his successors has provided the ShIcT community with a living, continuous
leadership, fully participating in its historical development and providing
guidance and direction in affairs not only personal and religious, but also
national and political. The triumph of the UsulT position divided the Shici
community into muqallid- the one obliged to practise taqlld — and mujtahid— the
one entitled to practise ijtihad. According to a recent statement of the matter,
"the belief of a Muslim in the principles of the faith must be based on a logical
proof, and he may not accept anyone's pronouncement without a proof.
Concerning, however, the ordinances \ahkam\ of religion, he must either be a
mujtahid and be able to deduce the ordinances according to logical proof, or
submit to a mujtahid, that is, act according to his instructions/'24 The mujtahid
may not claim absolute authority for himself, for the result of ijtihad is never
more than %ann —a contestable expression of personal opinion —so that
mujtahids may pronounce different or contradictory rulings on the same matter.
Since, however, it is incumbent on the muqallid to choose one mujtahid whose

directives he will follow, in practice the mujtahid comes to enjoy a wide degree
of authority. Choice of a mujtahid as source of direction — marjd-i taqlid
depends primarily upon the observation of a superior degree of learning and
piety, such as to inspire confidence in his worthiness. If the marjac-i taqlid dies, it
becomes necessary to choose a new one; only the pronouncements of a living
mujtahid satisfy the requirement of taqlid, except in unusual circumstances (for
example, lack of access to a living mujtahid, in which case the writings of a
deceased marjac-i taqlid may be referred to). The institution of taqlid is thus
continuously renewed.25
Since religious ordinances embrace the political sphere, the function of
mujtahid hasacquired animportant socio-political dimension. Asmarjac-i taqlid,
the mujtahid is liable to dispense guidance on political matters in a sense
opposed to the will of the state, and to become ipsofacto a leader of opposition.
More important still, the institution of monarchy cannot be accommodated in
the system of Shici belief in any but the most formal and superficial fashion.
Being himself a mere muqallid, the monarch is theoretically bound to make the
state the executive branch of culama authority. This logical consequence of the
Usuli distinction between muqallid and mujtahid remained shrouded in the
Safavid period, when the monarchy laid claim to religious legitimacy through
alleged Imamite descent.26 The Qajars, who brought the post-Safavid interreg
num to a close at the end of the 18th century, could advance no such claim, nor
did they consistently and in good conscience defer to the directives of the
mujtahids. One of the dominant themes of Qajar history thus became persistent
tension between the monarchy and theculama, that frequently expressed itself in
open confrontation and led ultimately to the participation of an important
segment of the culama in the Constitutional Revolution of 1905—n. The
establishment of the Qajar dynasty coincided chronologically with the vindica
tion of the Usull mazhab by Bihbahani and his pupils, but the two phenomena
were opposed in fundamental tendency.
Much of this became apparent in the reign of the second Qajar monarch, Fath
CA1I Shah (1212/1797—12 5 0/18 34). A brief return to prominence of the Akhbaris
was achieved by Mirza Muhammad Amln Akhbarl (d. 1233/1818), who appar
ently achieved by magical means the death of Tsitsianov, commander of the
Russian forces besieging Baku during the First Perso-Russian War. But the
25 For a fuller discussion of these matters, see Algar, op. cit.^ pp. 6—11. 26 Instances of rejection of the royal authority by culama were not however lacking; cf. the exchanges between Shaikh Ahmad Ardablll (d. 922/15 84) and Shah cAbbas (Hirz al-DIn, 1, pp. 536).

opening decades of the 19th century were clearly dominated by the pupils and
associates of Bihbahani: his son, Mirza Muhammad CA1I, resident in
Kirmanshah; Shaikh Jacfar al-Najafi, principal antagonist of Mirza Muhammad
Amin Akhbari and author of two important books on Usuli fiqh, al-Haqq al
Mubln and Kashf'al-Ghita', a resident of Iraq but a yearly visitor to Iran; Shaikh
Jacfar's son, Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi, author of Jawahir al-Kalam\ Hajj
Muhammad Ibrahim Kalbasi and Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Shaft!, both of
Isfahan; Sayyid Mahdi Bahr al-cUlum of Najaf; and Shaikh AbuDl-Qasim
Qumml of Qum, author of Qawaninal-Usul. The monarch sought their favour
through the patronage of shrines and other means, but conflict between State
and culama was already frequent. The mujtahids were instrumental in forcing
Fath CA1I Shah into his second war with Russia, and obtained the dismissal of
several provincial governors.
The reigns of the next two Qajar monarchs, Muhammad Shah (1250/183 4
1264/1848) and Nasir al-DIn Shah (1264/1848—1313/1896) saw a persistence and
deepening of the opposition between culama and state. The first forfeited all
hope of peaceable relations with the culama through his patronage of the Sufis, a
group bitterly hated by the majority of the culama; while the reign of the second
witnessed the beginnings of that process of governmental reform, foreign
encroachment and westernization which was to threaten the whole traditional
context of culama thought and activity with destruction. It is true that there
always existed a certain group of culama associated with the state, headed by the
Imam Jumca of Tehran, but of greater importance were those who shunned it as
illegitimate and its property as unclean. In the early 1860s there took place a
development of great portent when a single mujtahid, Shaikh Murtaza Ansari
(d. 1281/1865), author of the important work on fiqh, Fare?id al-Usul, achieved
the position of sole marjac-i taqlld of the whole Shici community and thereby
won immense theoretical power.27 The function of mujtahid asserted by
Bihbahani and thus raised to its highest potential degree by Ansari received its
clearest political application when in 1309/1891 Mirza Hasan ShlrazI, next sole
marjac-i taqlld after Ansari, forbade the use of tobacco after the establishment of
a British-owned tobacco monopoly and succeeded in forcing its cancellation.28
It is against this background of growing culama power and assertiveness that the
participation of the culama in the Constitutional Revolution should be
considered.
The Qajar period was not only one of great political importance for the

ulama, but one in which their participation in the daily affairs of society was
marked, the literature flowing from their pens proliferated, and their institu
tions of learning flourished. The culama operated a judicial system which in many
areas competed with that of the state, and their courts were often preferred to the
secular jurisdiction as swifter in operation and more just in decision. Their seals
were affixed to vital documents of everyday life such as marriage contracts and
deeds of possession, and the activity of the bazaar was quite dependent on their
services. The residences of the culama and the mosques over which they presided
often provided refuge for those in flight from the jurisdiction of the state, and
they would practically assume the administration of provincial cities at times of
instability, particularly in the interval between reigns. Cities in which their role
was especially important were Isfahan, where a succession of determined culama
culminating in the notorious Aqa Najafi disputed rule of the city with the
governors appointed from Tehran; Tabriz, which lived under the sway of
powerful mujtahids such as Mirza Aqa Javad, whose religious authority was
solidly reinforced by vast wealth; and Mashhad, where the auqafattached to the
shrine of Imam Riza supported a large number of culama and their students. In
all three of these cities, as well as Tehran, Qum and Shlraz, important madrasas
existed. The catabat continued, however, to hold a significant place throughout
the Qajar period; it was there that decisive developments were initiated, and
most figures of importance either resided permanently or studied before return
ing to Iran. When the culama passed over to open opposition to the monarchical
regime, the location of their chief directive focus in the catabat, outside Iran, was
of great convenience. The study of the religious sciences at all these centres was
much facilitated by the lithographing of the abundant fiqh literature of the
period, as well as earlier classics of Shicism, on the presses both of Iran and India.
It may be thought that this extensive role of the °ulama in 19th-century Iran
would not have been possible without the triumph of the Usulls over the
Akhbaris. Devoted to a doctrinal purism, a narrowly literal form of devotion to
the Imams, the Akhbaris were bound to be defeated by a school that offered a
living form of direction to the community. It is no coincidence that the period of
Akhbari dominance came when the identity of Iran as a unified Shici state was
cast into question. The reaffirmation of that identity was due at least as much to
the Usulis as to the Qajar dynasty.
Almost at the same time that the contest between the Usulls and the Akhbaris
was settled in favour of the former, a new branch of Shicism, the Shaikh! school,

arose, contributing a further element of variety to Iranian Shicism and another
instance of its internal differentiation. The distinctive teachings that set the
Shaikhis apart from the main body of the Shlci community were also concerned
in essence with the implications of the occultation of the Imam, but were
directed more to the spiritual and cosmological than the legal dimensions of the
problem. Akhbaris and Usulis were agreed that the Imam continues to exercise a
guiding and directive function even while in occultation, but evinced little
interest in the precise mode whereby his function is exercised, concentrating
instead on the juridical problems resulting from his physical absence. The
Shaikhis, by contrast, devoted intense speculation to the continuing reality of
the Imam's spiritual presence, seeking thereby, it has been suggested, a
restoration of the esoteric dimension of Shicism that had suffered by the Safavid
establishment of the faith and the consequent loss of the traditional minority
status.29 Hence the doctrine of the rukn-irabf: the "fourth pillar" of religion that
served as a species of intermediary with the Occulted Imam;30 and the
concentration on Hurqalya, the intermediate realm between the subtle and the
manifest, where the Imam dwells in occultation, and where resurrection shall
take place.31
The school originates w^ith Shaikh Ahmad Ahsa^i, the shaikh par excellence in
the view of his followers; hence the designation of the school. He spent the early
part of his life in Bahrain, and from his youth onward began to experience a
series of compelling visions of the Twelve Imams. He claimed, for example, that
Hasan ibn All had taught him a special form of supplicatory prayer, and that he
received authorization to teach religion from the Imams themselves, thus
freeing him from the necessity of studying under living masters. He did,
however, frequent the catabat and associate with the most important contem
porary scholars there. In 1221/1806, he came to Iran, and spent a number of years
between Mashhad, Yazd, Tehran and Kirmanshah. In all of these places he was
enthusiastically received, not only by many of the culama, but also by provincial
governors and Fath CA1I Shah himself. This popularity was unable to protect
him from the bitter opposition of some of the culama which resulted in the
formal declaration of him to be a kafir by the culama of Qazvin. Envy may have
played a role in the excitement of hostility against Shaikh Ahmad, but the
doctrinal grounds appeared clear enough: the apparent denial of the bodily
nature both of the Prophet's ascension (mfraj) and of the resurrection, by

asserting that the locus for both of these is the realm of Hiirqalya. After the
incident in Qazvin, Shaikh Ahmad left Iran, first for the catabat, and then, still
pursued by enmity, for the Hijaz. He died in Jidda in 1241/1826.32
It is sometimes doubted that he wished to found a new school, but his
appointment of a successor {ncFib al-manab) made it inevitable that a group of
followers should crystallize in defence of the doctrines he had expounded. The
successor was Sayyid Kazim Rashtl, who had once been told by his master, "no
one understands me but you". He, too, claimed to see the Imams in a series of
visions of increasing intensity, and it was in the course of one such vision that
Fatima, the Prophet's daughter, appeared to him and instructed him to seek out
Shaikh Ahmad, then resident in Yazd. He followed himto Iraq after the incident
in Qazvin, and settled in Karbala where he spent the rest of his life. His
numerous and complex writings were devoted chiefly to the defence and further
elaboration of Shaikh Ahmad's doctrines, especially the denial of the corporeal
ascension of the Prophet and the description of the Imams as the efficient cause
(^illat-i gha^T) of Creation.33 Several claimants to the leadership of the Shaikh!
school arose after his death in 1259/1843, but the claims of Hajj Muhammad
Karim Khan Kirmani, a member of the Qajar family, found wide acceptance.
Thereafter the direction of the Shaikhis remained among thedescendants of Hajj
Muhammad Karim Khan (d. 1288/1870). He wassucceeded first by his son, Hajj
Muhammad Khan Kirmani (d. 1324/1906); then by his younger son, Hajj Zain
al-cAbidin Khan Kirmani (d. 1361/1942); and finally by his grandson, AbuDl
Qasim Khan Ibrahlml (d. 1389/1969), known as Sarkar Aqa. Not surprisingly,
Kirman became one of the two chief centres of Shaikhism, the other being
Tabriz, and the controversy that had first erupted in Qazvin in the lifetime of
Shaikh Ahmad continued to inspire sporadic but violent clashes in both cities
down to the early years of the 20th century. Shaikhis were constantly excluded
from the bathhouses of Tabriz as heretics and therefore unclean;34 and in
Kirman in 1905,a minor war between Usulls and Shaikhis erupted over the
control ofauqaf.^
In common with other groups that flourished in the 19th century, the
Shaikhis produced a vast literature, much of which still remains in manuscript.36

important of which are Shark al-Ziyara al-Jamfa, al-Fawifid and Jawamf al
Kalim. Kazim Rashtl and Muhammad Karlm Khan Kirmani were similarly
prolific; their major works were Datll al-Mutahayyirin and Irshad al-'yiwamm
respectively. Without a detailed examination of this literature, it is difficult to
attempt a concise definition of the school. Without necessarily suggesting an
incoherent eclecticism, we maypoint out first the wide variety of reminiscences
awakened by Shaikh! doctrine. The concept of Hurqalya, for example, is clearly
derived from Suhravard! Maqtul and the Ishraqi school, for whom it also
constituted an intermediary realm, mirroring in itself the forms of the hereafter
and the suprasensory realm which are reflected in turn on the earthly plane.37
Other formulations andteachings suggest a late recrudescence of Ismacilism: the
concept of an unseen spiritual hierarchy headed by a bab ac%am ("supreme gate");
the interpretation of the six days of creation as indicating the six realms that
constitute the macrocosm; and the very term rukn-i rabf itself, which first occurs
in a text written by Nasir al-Din Tusi in his Ismacili period.38
Secondly, there was a clear emphasis on a special mode of closeness to the
Imams, and especially the Twelfth Imam, and a fearless claim to have been
inspired and infallibly instructed by them. Wehave seen that Shaikh Ahmad and
Kazim Rashtl both enjoyed frequent communication with the Imams through
visions and dreams, and Hajj Muhammad Karlm Khan also felt himself to be
constantly guided by the Imams.39 There was no need to examine akhbar with
the methods of exoteric science; intuition correctly guided by inspiration from
the Imams could immediately distinguish the authentic from the false. The
Shaikh! leaders also claimed the ability to interpret the teachings with an
infallible authority derived from the same source, and if there wasan appearance
of novelty to any of the Shaikh! doctrines, it was only because the Imams had
authorized removal of the veil oitaqlya from what it had previously concealed.40
It is true that the Shaikhis never claimed for their leaders any of the ranks in the
hidden spiritual hierarchy, and that neither Shaikh Ahmad nor Kazim Rashtl
explicitly identified himself with the rukn-i rabic. But it is clear that the Shaikh!
leaders claimed a certain mode of spiritual proximity to the Imams and an
authority deriving from them not totally dissimilar to the concept of the bab, the
gate of communication between the Occulted Imam andhisfaithful community.
It would be wrong, however, to see in Shaikhism simply the seedbed of
Babism. Rather we would characterize it as a school of esoteric intent that
37 Henry Corbin's anthology, Terre Celeste et Corps de Resurrection, makes clear the continuous transmission of these notions from pre-Islamic Iran. 38 Corbin, En Islam Iranien iv, pp. 262, 286, 293^*. 39 Ibid., p. 239. 40 Ibid., p. 285.

sought, on the eve of the modern age,to develop a vast and complex metaphysic
and cosmology centred obsessively on the traditional ShfI theme of the
Imamate, and in so doing draw on a wide variety of schools that had flourished
in the Iranian spiritual world. It was in fact the last great school of esoteric
speculation to be provided by Islamic Iran, a phenomenon totally different from
Usulism, but like it a proof of the vitality of Shicism in the early 19th century.
The late 18th century also witnessed the recrudescence of another type of Shlci
esoterism, tarlqat ("way" or "path") Sufism approximately of the Sunni kind, a
form of the religious life abhorrent to Akhbaris, Usulls and Shaikhls alike.
Sufism bore a certain resemblance to Shicism in its concern with the esoteric and
in its acknowledgement of the spiritual pre-eminence of CA1Iamong the Com
panions of the Prophet, but the two streams had always been opposed to each
other in their historical expression. There was the simple fact that the great
majority of Sufi masters were of Sunni affiliation, and, moreover, when the
shaikh-murid relationship of the tariqats became formalized, the preceptorial
function exercised by the shaikh appeared to the Shfa to contradict the mon
opoly of true spiritual guidance held by the Imam.
In the post-Mongol period, however, certain Sufi orders of Shici affiliation
arose, generally through the gradual transformation of an originally Sunni
order. Such was the case with the Safavids, who accomplished a further
transformation into a dynasty and state. Other examples are furnished by the
Zahabiyya, an offshoot of the Kubraviyya, an order which in its main line
maintained a Sunni identity; and the Nicmat-Allahi tarlqat, which owes its name
to the Sunni master, Shah Ni'mat-Allah Vail Kirmani (d. 834/1431). The
absorption of the ShIcI elements by these and other groups may be thought to
have resulted from the ubiquitousness of the tarlqat phenomenon in the post
Mongol period, both as a form of social organization and as a refuge for
minority persuasions, not only Shicls but also Ismacilis.
Little is known about the fate either of the Zahabiyya or the Nicmat-Allahiyya
in the Safavid period. The Zahabiyya claim to have maintained an unbroken
initiatic chain throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, but nothing is known
about the identity of the links in the chain.41 The leaders of the Nicmat- Allahiyya
appear to have enjoyed close and friendly relations both with Shah Ismacil and
his successor, Tahmasp, but fell into disfavour in the time of Shah cAbbas

because of alleged oppositional activities. Thereafter there is barely a trace of
them in Iran until the end of the Safavid period.42
In the 18th century both orders re-emerged, more importantly the Nicmat
Allahiyya. Many Nicmat-Allahis had fled in Safavid times to the Deccan, and
now the traffic was reversed. Riza All Shah Dakkani, the head of the order,
dispatched Shah Tahir Dakkani and Macsum All Shah Dakkani to Iran in the
late 18th century to revive the order in its homeland. They met with much
success, attaining a large following very swiftly, but also with a determined and
intransigent hostility on the part of the culama which went as far as murderous
persecution. Muhammad All Bihbahani not only wrote two treatises in bitter
condemnation of the Sufis, Kisala-ji KhairatiyjazndQaf al-MaqalflRadd Ahlal
Dalal, but also directed against them the same vigorous enmity that his father
had nurtured for the Akhbaris; it was on his orders that Macsum All Shah was
killed in Kirmanshah in 1212/1797. Numerous other Nicmat-Allahis were also
put to death by the culama or at their instigation, in Shiraz, Kirman and
elsewhere.43 In this campaign of persecution, the culama were able to enlist the
support of royal authority: first Karim Khan Zand, who expelled from Shiraz
Nur All Shah, Macsum All Shah's successor as head of the order in Iran, and
then Fath All Shah Qajar, who surrendered two of Nur All Shah's followers to
the wrath of Bihbahani.44 Matters changed with the accession of Muhammad
Shah, who under the influence of his minister, Hajji Mirza Aghasi, began instead
to patronize and protect the Sufis, particularly members of the Nicmat-Allahi
order, and himself to cultivate Sufi affiliations.45 Nasir al-DIn Shah appears to
have had no Sufi proclivities, but culama hostility to Sufism in his reign was
restricted to debate and written controversy; open persecution had definitively
ceased.
By the middle of the 19th century, the Nicmat-Allahl order was then firmly
established. Already Nur All Shah had acquired a following of thousands in the
area of Kirman, and his followers were able to make it one of the chief centres of
the order, adding a further element of diversity to the religious life of the city.
Other Nicmat-Allahl centres grew up in Shiraz, Isfahan, Hamadan and Tehran.
The expansion and strengthening of the order went together with a division into
several branches. Muhammad Jacfar Kabudar AhangI Majzub All Shah (d.
1239/1823) was the last leader to exercise undisputed control over the whole
order. Three separate claimants to the leadership arose after his death, the most

successful being Zain al- Abidin Shirvani (d. 1253/1837), author of a number of
important works on the history of the order and on Iranian Sufism in general.
When Shlrvanl's successor, Zain al-Abidin Rahmat CA1I Shah, died in 1278/
1861, a further trifurcation took place, and the main body of the Nicmat-Allahls
became divided into the lines of Zu3l-Riyasatain Munavvar All Shah (d.1301/
1884), Safi AlIShah(d. 1316/1899) and Sacadat cAlIShah(d. 1293/1876), this last
being later known as the GunabadI line. Each line had its own characteristics,
the line of ZuDl-Riyasatain holding more strictly to traditional Nicmat-Allahi
belief and practice. The line of Safi CA1I Shah had aristocratic affiliations; his
successor, Safa All Shah Zahlr al-Daula (d. 1342/1924) was minister of court. In
1317/1899, the practice of individual leadership of this branch of the order was
abandoned in favour of a ten-man directorate, possibly under the influence of
masonic models. The order itself was renamed Anjuman-i Ukhuvvat, The
Society of Brotherhood. As for the GunabadI line, this developed into the most
powerful and well-endowed of all branches of the Nicmat-Allahiyya, under the
direction of Mulla Muhammad Sultan All Shah, a forceful and controversial
figure who was murdered in 1909.46
This diversification of the Nicmat-Allahl order by no means signified a
weakening of Sufism; it was rather an instance of secondary differentiation
within post-Safavid Shicism. The Nicmat-Allahls not only established a wide
spread following but also produced a prolific literature in both prose and verse,
much of it banal and unoriginal, but some of it of genuine value. Of particular
interest in these writings are the responses formulated by the Nicmat-Allahis to
the attacks of theculama on the permissibility of Sufism as a path to be followed
by the Shica. We may refer, for example, to Zain al-Abidin's Kashj al-Maarif.
The son of an Usuli mujtahid, he nevertheless attacks theculama as a class, saying
that they cannot rightfully claim the rank of heirs to the prophets to which a
celebrated hadlth apparently entitles them, because of the dissensions existing
among them, and their lack of a "sacred faculty" (quvva-yi qudsiyyd) that would
permit them to grasp the esoteric as well as the exoteric dimension of religion.47
Only those culama can function as heirs of the prophets who join the practice of
Sufism to their study of fiqh: as examples he lists A.bd al-Samad HamadanI,
Muhammad Jacfar HamadanI and Maulana Ibrahim KhuDI, all of whom joined
the Nicmat-Allahl order after first being mujtahids.48 There exists, it is true, a
saying of the Imam Riza that "whoever hears the Sufis mentioned in his presence
and does not condemn them with his tongue or in his heart is not one of us; and
46 Concerning all of these developments, see Gramlich, op. cit., pp. 50—66. 47 Kashf al-Mcfarif (Tehran, 1350/1971), pp. 5-6. 48 Ibid., pp. 17-18.

whoever does so condemn them is like one who is fighting against the unbeliev
ers in the presence of the Messenger of God". The saying should be understood,
however, as referring exclusively to false Sufis who "cloud the sun of the
Imamate", i.e., SunnI Sufis.49 "True Sufism", it was asserted by Macsum All
Shah, son of Shirvani's successor, "is true Shicism; the path of the Immaculate
Imams is outwardly the sharfat of the Imami Shfa, and inwardly the divine
truths of Sufism."50
As for the objection that the pretensions of the leader of the Sufi order
clashed with the prerogatives of the Imams, and that his very title of qutb
("pole") was usurped from them, Nicmat-Allahls replied that a distinction
should be made between the supreme guidance exercised by the Imam and the
partial guidance exercised by the qutb. The Imam was termed by them a "solar
pole", and the Sufi shaikh a "lunar pole", deriving his authority and efficacy
from the Imam. Expressed differently, the Imam had "solar authority" (yilayat-i
shamsiyya) and the qutb "lunar authority" {yilayat-i qamariyya). The true precep
tor {pir-i haqlqat)is indeed the Imam, but since he is in occultation his guiding
functions devolve practically upon the qutb, just as his juridical functions
devolve practically upon the mujtahid: in both instances final authority is the
Imam's alone.51
Despite their counterattacks upon theculama, and their attempts to reconcile
the function of the qutb with the doctrine of the Imamate, the Sufis remained
permanently suspected of irreligion and heresy. Zain al-Abidin Shirvani re
marked with some bitterness that whoever in Iran deals with such matters as
ritual purification after menstrual discharge and the legal stratagems that permit
the taking of interest counts as the most pious scholar of age; but whoever so
much as mentions the purification of the soul and the practice of asceticism is
unhesitatingly dismissed as a heretic.52 His complaint was justified insofar asthe
overwhelming emphasis of Iranian Shicism in the 19th century was on law and
the external dimension of religion. Neither the speculations of the Shaikhis nor
the protests of the Nicmat-Allahis could alter this, the most signal consequence
of the triumph of Usulism. The Sufis were destined to remain a minority,
however well-entrenched, sought out by those who found attractive the spiri
tual possibilities and the intimate welcoming circle that the tariqat offered.
Less important than the Nfmat-Allahis but also deserving of mention are
two other Sufi groups, the Zahabiyya and the Khaksar. The Zahabiyya were

first concentrated in Shiraz, where their leader held by hereditary right the post
of administrator at the shrine of Shah Chiragh. They later expanded into
Azerbaijan, and divided into two groups toward the end of the 19thcentury. As
for the Khaksar, they consisted originally of unorganized dervishes of tra
ditional antinomian, qalandar type, who gradually coalesced into an order along
more disciplined lines.53
We have stressed so far doctrinal developments and debates among the culama
and their competitors in religious leadership, the Sufi orders. Popular religiosity
should not remain unmentioned, for the affective loyalty of the masses to
Shicism was secured primarily by a variety of emotionally laden devotional
practices that expressed the genius of Shicism as a religion of conflict and
suffering. An important place was held in popular religious life by visits to the
shrines of the Imams and their relatives, whether the great centres of pilgrimage
at thecatabat, Mashhad and Qum,or the more modest imam^adasto be found in
every corner of the country. Such pilgrimages afforded the opportunity of
intimate discourse with the sacred figure buried at the shrine, of seeking his
intercession and favour, and of offering a vow and making atonement. It was
possible, too,to participate vicariously in the imagined struggles of CA1I against
cUmar, theperennial butt of Shici execration, by celebrating annually the murder
of cUmar in the festival o£Qumarkushan or making pilgrimage to the tomb of his
assassin near Kashan.
Most important among these props of popular piety wasthe commemoration
of the martyrdom of Imam Husain at Karbala through the recitation of verse and
dramatic performance, a form of sentimental religiosity that flourished through
out the Qajar period. Poetry celebrating the heroic death of Husain had long
existed, both in Persian and Arabic, and had been much fostered by the Safavids
as one means for the inculcation of Shici sentiment. The 19th century saw a
continuing enrichment of this genre. Particularly celebrated were the poems on
the tragedy at Karbala composed by Yaghma Jandaqi and Qa°anl ShirazI,
otherwise known chiefly for their ribald and satirical poetry.54 A more extensive
work on the same subject that enjoyed continuing popularity throughout the
Qajar period was the Kau^at al-Shuhada of Husain ibn All Kashifi (d. 910/1504),
which was ceremonially recited by professional readers not only during
Muharram but on other suitable occasions during the year. These recitations,

known as rau'^akhwarii, counted as acts of charity as well as pious remembrance.
They were frequently held in the homes of grandees or prosperous merchants,
and those invited received bodily as well as spiritual nourishment.
The full significance of the tragedy at Karbala for the ShicT soul was
manifested in the tcf^iya, the so-called passion play of Iran (see also Chapter 20).
Through witnessing or participating in the dramatic re-enactment of the
martyrdom of Husain, the believer experienced the defeat of the Imam in direct
and vivid fashion, not as a mere historical memory, but as a living piece of
metahistory. In the person of Husain the aspiration for justice was seen to have
confronted the tyranny of an impious regime, and when the spectators at the
taziya wept in memory of his martyrdom, they were lamenting too the recurrent
temporal defeat of the same aspiration. Husain's struggle against the Umayyads
was transfigured into an archetype of the conflict between justice and tyranny,
endowing the remembrance and re-enactment of it with a particular intensity of
devotion. Cathartic and atoning tears were shed, and vicariously the faithful
joined the company of the martyrs.
The historical origins of the tacziya are unclear, although it is probable that it
first developed in Safavid times. The earliest reference to dramatic performances
in commemoration of Karbala appear to date from the late 18th century.55 The
Qajar era, and particularly the reign of Nasir al-DIn Shah, was indisputably the
period of the greatest flourishing of the tacziya. It enjoyed popularity in all
classes of society, and was performed in settings that ranged from the simplest
open-air stage to the royal theatre (takya-yi daulat) of Nasir al-DIn Shah that
could accommodate up to 20,000 people. Frequently the taLziya was staged by
anjumam that fashioned, accumulated and maintained the necessary props and
assigned each member a permanent role in the performance. These fraternities
were affiliated with traditional chivalrous and artisan organizations such as the
liitls or javanmardan\ indeed they were sometimes identical with them. There
subsequently arose, however, a class of professional performers that was
patronized by local princes and the court in Tehran. Royal patronage led
inevitably to a partial secularization of the tacziya: ambassadors were invited to
watch the proceedings at the royal theatre, and one well-travelled member of the
court remarked that the performances there were more laughable than the
comedies of Europe.56 At a popular level also, the tacziya gradually gave rise to a
secular drama that drew its themes from the classics of Persian romance. Despite

these developments, the tacziya has remained a powerful means for both
nurturing and expressing the affective loyalty of the Iranian masses to Shfi
Islam.57
The 19th century was, then, a period in which Iran witnessed a multiple
deployment of Shicism in its varying forms, exoteric and esoteric, legalistic and
Sufi, learned and popular, completing theprocess of identification between Iran
and Shicism that had been initiated by the Safavids and lain dormant through
most of the 18thcentury. The Qajar period also gave final proof, on the verge of
the modern age, of Iran's lasting fecundity in eclectic and heterodox doctrine,
with the rise of Babism and its twin successors, Azalism and Baha^ism.
In Jumada 11260/May 1844, Sayyid CA1IMuhammad, a former student ofthe
Shaikh! leader Kazim Rashti, declared himself in Shlraz to be the Bab,the
"Gate" or intermediary between the Occulted Imam and his faithful commu
nity. Soon, however, the nature of his claims changed, and it wassuggested that
he wasthe Imam himself, returned to theplane of manifestation. Thus oneofhis
earlier followers, Mulla CA1TAkbar ArdistanI, appended to the call to prayer he
sounded from the mosque of Aqa Qasim in Shlraz: "I bear witness that cAli
Muhammad is the remnant of Allah [baqiyatt?llah\\ this being an epithet
traditionally bestowed on the Occulted Imam.58 Later the Babascended to still
higher status, proclaiming himself the recipient of a new scriptural revelation
and a new divine law.
These claims met with immediate opposition on the part of the culama, and
several confrontations took place between them and the Bab. After thefirst such
debate, the Babwas restricted to his house, before being removed to somewhat
lenient imprisonment in Isfahan. In 1263/1847, he was banished to Azerbaijan,
being held first in Maku and then in the castle of Chihriq near Lake Urmiya,
under far more rigorous conditions. While the Bab wasbeing transferred from
one place of confinement to another, his followers were engaged in rebellion in
various parts of the country under the direction of a number of remarkable
leaders: Mulla Husain Bushravaih, Mulla Muhammad All and the celebrated
poetess Qurrat al-cAin in Mazandaran; Mulla Muhammad Zanjani in Zanjan;
and Sayyid Yahya Darabi in NIriz. In the hope of definitively quelling all such
insurrectionary activity, MIrza Taqi Khan Amir Kabir, the great reforming
minister, ordered the Bab to be executed in Tabriz in 1266/1850, more for
reasons of state than of orthodox piety.59
57 For a good survey of the whole subject of the ta\iya, see Enrico Cerulli, "Le theatre persan". 58 MIrza Husain Hamadani, Tarlkh-i Jadld, p. 200. 59 These events are well summarized in W.M. Miller, The Rahai Faith, pp. 13-47.

Enthusiasm for the cause of the Babdid not wane with his death, and in 1268/
1852, three Babis attempted to assassinate Nasir al-DIn Shah in order to avenge
their dead master. A widespread persecution of Babis ensued, including Mirza
Yahya Nuri and his half-brother, Mirza Husain Nuri, whowere to preside over
the bifurcation of Babism in its next stage of development. Various explanations
have been offered for the positive, indeed dedicated, response that many in Iran
accorded to the cause of the Bab. It hasbeen suggested that histeachings in some
way foreshadowed the modernization that was later to overtake Iran. It is true
that he wished to abrogate the Islamic sharfat, forbade polygamous marriages
and abolished all notion of ritual purity. But it is difficult to seein these measures
even a proto-modernizing spirit, considering the context in which they were
enounced, the Bayan,a book that also instructed all Babis to carry a talisman of
2001 squares60 and recommended that no conversation between unmarried men
and women should exceed twenty-eight words.61 In any event, it is unlikely that
the early Babi enthusiasts would have had access to the Bab's writings, any more
than they did to the man himself; it has been justly remarked that their devotion
was more to leaders than to books and precepts.62 We would suggest rather that
a pre-existing potential for revolt was activated by the invocation of the
powerful theme of the messianic return of the Occulted Imam, and that Babism
was the very opposite of a modernizing phenomenon. There are to be found in
Babism a large number of Ismacill echoes and reminiscences, in its terminology,
cosmology and numerology; it can in fact be regarded from onepoint of view as
the last surfacing of the perennial Ismaclli ferment in Iran.63
An immediate precedent for Babism is provided by the Shaikh! school, and
Shaikh Ahmad Ahsa°i and Sayyid Kazim Rashtl have been claimed by the Babis
as the spiritual ancestors of the Bab. To regard the Shaikhls simply as forerun
ners of Babism would no doubt be erroneous, and Hajj Muhammad Karim
Khan, successor to Sayyid Kazim Rashtl, was in fact bitterly opposed to
Babism.64 But insofar as the Shaikhls had not remained content with awaiting
the return of the Occulted Imam, and spoken of the rukn-i rabic, an ill-defined
species of intermediary between the Imam and his community, they had
disturbed the delicate traditional equilibrium between a patient endurance ofthe
Occultation and a desire for its ending. It is surely no coincidence that a large
proportion of those culama who embraced Babism were originally Shaikhls.65

The Bab had appointed as his successor one of the brothers that went into
exile in 1268/18 5 2, MIrza Yahya Nun, who was commonly known by the title of
Subh-i Azal, "The Morning of Eternity".66 He had also written, however, of
one who was to come after him with yet another new dispensation, designating
him as "he whom God shall manifest."67 In 1280/1863, MIrza Yahya's half
brother, MIrza Husain Nun, adorned with the title of Baha°-Allah, "The
Splendour of God", first declared himself in a garden near Baghdad to be that
promised manifestation, and thus the legitimate successor to the Bab. A number
of the Babls accepted him as such, and others, encouraged by his example,
advanced similar claims, but attained no notable success. The dispute that then
arose between the two brothers reached critical proportions when Baha°-Allah
made a public affirmation of his claim in Edirne in 1283/1866, about three years
after the Ottoman government had removed them there from Baghdad.68 A
schism occurred, with the followers of Subh-i Azal adhering to the teachings of
the Bab and those of Baha°-Allah following him in the elaboration of a new
religion. It became necessary to separate the two groups physically, and thus
Subh-i Azal and his disciples were sent to Famagusta, while Baha°-Allah went
with his following to Acre. The former died ^1330/1912, and the latter in 1310/
1892.
The majority of the Babls that had remained in Iran ultimately rallied to
Baha°-Allah's claims, and the Azalls sank into obscurity, with the exception of a
few figures who, concealing their identity, played a role of some importance in
the Constitutional Revolution.69 It may be thought that Baha^ism, maintaining
the original doctrinal dynamism of the movement and refusing to settle into a
stable, fixed form, was bound to predominate over Azalism, which sought to
remain rigidly faithful to the teachings of the Bab. BahaDism also made claims to
universality, espousing such dominant concerns of modern Europe as the
congruence of religion and science, universal peace, female emancipation and
the unity of religions. Indeed, the whole subsequent development of Baha^ism,
with its further disputes over succession and revisions of doctrine, belongs more
to the history of the reception of Oriental sages by the post-Christian West than
to the millennial traditions of Islamic Iran. It is true that, despite continued
hostility, the Baha°Is have maintained their existence in Iran, drawing a number
of converts especially from the Jewish and Zoroastrian communities. But the
challenge presented by them and their Babi predecessors to the hegemony of

RELIGIOUS FORCES, l8TH AND I9TH CENTURY
ShIcI Islam in Iran in the 19th century was never profound, and their story is
incidental to the main themes in the religious history of the period.
In conclusion, developments affecting the religious minorities in Iran may be
briefly reviewed.
The Ismaclll Nizarl Imams, after a long period of almost complete obscurity,
emerge in the 18th century to renewed participation in Iranian history. In 1170/
1756, we find Imam Abu3l-Hasan Shah as governor of Kirman for the Zands, a
post he held until his death in 1206/1791. His son and successor as Imam, Shah
KhalU-Allah, enjoyed good relations with Fath All Shah, but was killed in Yazd
in 1232/1817. A mulla responsible for the disturbances was brought to Tehran
and bastinadoed, and Fath All Shah sought to compensate the new Imam,
Hasan All Shah MahallatI, known as Agha Khan, for the death of his father by
giving him one of his daughters in marriage and appointing him governor of
Kirman. Agha Khan rebelled against the central authority, and, defeated by
government forces, was obliged in 1258/1842 to withdraw into Afghanistan.
Thence he proceeded into India, to inaugurate the long association between the
Ismacili Nizari Imamate and the British Raj. It is probable, indeed, that his
rebellion took place at British instigation, or at least that it enjoyed British
support, as a diversionary move aiding British efforts for the final detachment of
Herat from Iran. There were other motives also at work , especially rivalry for
the leadership of the Nicmat-Allahi tarlqat: Agha Khan's support of Zain al
Abidin Shlrvanl earned him the hostility of Mirza Aghasi, Muhammad Shah's
minister. Although the revolt marked the final exit of the Ismacill Imamate from
Iran, almost six centuries after the fall of Alamiit, small Ismaclli communities
persisted in the areas of Mahallat in central Iran, Qa°in in the east and Shahr-i
Babak in the southeast.70
Of greater significance were the Sunn! minorities inhabiting the fringes of
Iran. Developments of some importance, all connected with the Naqshbandl
tarlqat, affected the Hanafi minority of Khurasan in the east and the Kurds in the
northwest. The resistance of Herat to Iranian rule resulted not only from British
encouragement but also from the desire of the majority Sunnl element in the city
to be rid of ShIcI dominance. The wars over Herat can in fact be regarded as a
minor resumption of the Sunni-Shicl confrontation on the eastern border of
Iran that had pitched the Safavids and Uzbeks against each other. An important

part in the organization of Herat! resistance to the Iranians was played by a
Naqshbandi dervish from Bukhara, Sufi Islam. Although he died in battle in
1222/1807, he left behind him a distinctive branch of the tarlqat which, based at
Karrukh in Afghanistan, extended a powerful influence across the border
among the Hanafis of Khurasan.71 Somewhat later, a certain Khwaja
Muhammad Yusuf Jam! established a centre of another branch of the
Naqshbandi tarlqat, the Mujaddidi, at Turbat-i Jam near the Afghan border.
The Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi shaikhs of Turbat-i Jam were a source of strength
for the beleaguered Hanafis of Khurasan in their resistance to Shfl governors
and culama intent on imposing Shicism upon them, and attracted devotees from
Turkistan, Afghanistan and India as well as Khurasan.
The first quarter of the 19th century witnessed the establishment of an
important derivative of the Naqshbandi-Mujaddidi order in the western Islamic
world, the Khalidiyya. It was founded by a Kurd from Sulaimaniyya, Maulana
Khalid (d. 1243/1827), and soon took root among the Kurds of Iran. The
Khalidiyya is militantly anti-ShIcI, and Maulana Khalid himself, when travelling
through Iran to India, engaged in bitter polemics with the Shici culama.72
Leadership of the order in Iranian Kurdistan became intertwined with tribal
authority, and inspired a number of prolonged Kurdish revolts against Iranian
rule that are to be regarded equally as opposition to Iranian rule and as acts of
anti-Shfl hostility.73
Among the non-Muslim minorities of Iran, the Christians, both Armenians
and Assyrians, were able to attain a new position of prominence in government
and commerce during the Qajar period. They acted as intermediaries between
Muslim Iran and the Christian West, functioning as interpreters, agents of
European commercial enterprises, and even furnishing some of the first Iranian
envoys to be posted to Europe. For the Armenians, this was a continuation of
the analogous role they had played in the Safavid period. Most prominent
among the Iranian Armenians of the Qajar period was MIrza Malkum Khan,
who made an opportunistic profession of Islam but remained true to the role of
the Armenian community by acting as an agent of modernization in several
important respects.74
Missions —Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian —proliferated in Iran
throughout the 19th century, and found their attempts to convert Armenians

and Assyrians from one denomination of Christianity to another more profitable
than proselytizing activities among the Muslims. Thus a whole series of "na
tive" churches came into being, at the expense of the Nestorian and Gregorian
communities.75
Jews and Zoroastrians also benefited from an outside interest in their
welfare. The Alliance Israelite Universelle constructed schools for the Jews in
Tehran, Hamadan and elsewhere, and despite losses to both Baha^ism and
Christianity, the Jewish community of Iran strengthened its position through
out the 19th century.76 The Zoroastrians received assistance from their more
prosperous coreligionists in Bombay, who founded the Persian Zoroastrian
Amelioration Fund in 1854 and some thirty years later were able to obtain the
suppression of the ji%y]a levied on the Zoroastrians.77
The 18th and 19th centuries constitute then a period in which Shicism
underwent a process of internal differentiation that marked its final emancipa
tion from the patronage of the state and its conclusive coalescence with the
national spirit of Iran. The challenge mounted by Babism was effectively
repulsed, and ShIcI Islam, in all its manifold forms of expression, passed into the
20th century, thus entering a period of unprecedented peril and unexpected
triumph.

CHAPTER 2O
RELIGIOUS FORCES IN TWENTIETH
CENTURY IRAN
It would, nodoubt, betheresult of selective hindsight to regard the first eight
decades ofthe 20th century asthe ineluctable prelude to the Islamic Revolution
of 1978—9. The cultural andpolitical orientation of Iranian society was placed
repeatedly in question asthePahlavl family sought to transform the monarchy
into a modern, authoritarian state, andsecularist, leftist andnationalist forces
emerged on the political scene. For several decades, moreover, most of the
leading culamamade noeffort to exert a decisive influence outside the relatively
narrow confines of the religious institution. Nonetheless, the tenacity ofreligion
as a major force throughout the modern history of Iran is remarkable and
unmistakable, and we may legitimately discern in a whole series of Islamic
personages, institutions andmovements theantecedents that made possible
although bynomeans inevitable - the great transformations ushered in by the
revolution of 1978—9.x
The preponderant role played byculama inthe Constitutional Revolution of
1905—11, especially inits earlier phases, iswell known. The alliance concluded in
November 1905 by two leading mujtahids of Tehran, Sayyid cAbd-Allah
Bihbahani and Sayyid Muhammad Tabataba°I, to bring about the overthrow of
Ain al-Daula, prime minister ofthe day, isoften considered the starting pointof
the revolution.2 The revolution had been preceded, moreover, by almost a
century ofsporadic conflict between leading culama and successive Qajar rulers.
Following onthe tobacco boycott of 1891—2, culama-led protests against loans
taken from foreign powers andtheconsequent alienation of the Iranian econ
omy became increasingly frequent in the opening years of the 20th century.3
Some culama encouraged their followers to boycott foreign goods, citing both

concern for ritual purity and political considerations.4 The mosques and shrines
of the capital and its environs were the principal bastions of the constitutional
ists, and their speeches and declarations were suffused with the concepts and
emotions ofShfi Islam. The first triumphs of the constitutionalists - MuzafTar
al-DIn Shah's agreement to institute anQadalatkhana ("House ofJustice") in
January 1906; his dismissal of cAin al-Daula in August 1906; and the convening
of the first Majlis soon thereafter — would have been unthinkable without the
mass movement led by Bihbahani, Tabataba°i and their colleagues among the
culama.
It is equally obvious, however, that there was no straightforward derivation
of constitutionalism — with all that it implied for the concepts of sovereignty and
legislation — from established religious precept. The initial demand of the culama
was for ancadalatkhana or majlis-imetdilat ^ Assembly of Justice"), the functions
of which were never clearly expressed. As for constitutionalism more strictly
conceived {mashrutd)^ this was a notion first promulgated in Iran bysecular
intellectuals with direct orindirect experience ofEurope; asSayyid Muham
mad Tabataba°i put it, "We [the culama] had no direct experience ofconstitu
tionalism. But what we heard from those who had seen countries with constitu
tional regimes was that constitutionalism conduces to the security and prosper
ity of a country. So we conceived an enthusiastic interest and made
arrangements forestablishing a constitution in this country."5 Matters were
clearly not that simple, forTabataba3! himself was chary of using the word
mashruta^ evidently because itwas felt to carry undertones of republicanism and
irreligion.6
Nonetheless, the confusion or vagueness sometimes attributed to leading
ulama in their support of the Constitutional Revolution should not be exagger
ated. The two mujtahids of Tehran were joined in their approval of the
constitutionalist cause bythree of the most prominent religious authorities
resident in Najaf: Shaikh Abd-Allah Mazandaranl (d. 1912), Akhund
Muhammad Kazim Khurasanl (d. 1911), and HajjIMIrza Husain Khalili Tihrani
(d. 1908). Their vigorous activities in favour of the cause continued
unhesitatingly throughout the period known as istibdad-i saghir ("the minor
autocracy", from June 1908 toJuly 1909), and the reasons they cited for their
stance may be taken as typical for the constitutionalist culama as a whole.

According to one of the telegrams they sent to Iran, those reasons werethe
protection of religion; thestrengthening of the state; the progress and well
being of the people; and the protection of the life and honour of the Muslims.7 So
clear, indeed, was the connection between constitutionalism and the attainment
of these goals that they invoked the celebrated Shfl formula tot jihad: "Any
effort to establish theconstitution is equivalent to a jihad waged under the
command of the Lord of the Age".8
Other culama came to oppose the theory and practice of constitutionalism
with equal vigour. Chief among them was the powerful mujtahid of Tehran,
Shaikh Fazl-Allah Nurl. After participating in the early stages of the movement,
he began, inthe spring of 1907, toturn the weight ofhis authority against the
constitutionalist cause. He claimed that the original purpose of the movement
the establishment ofan assembly that would enact the laws ofthe sharfa — had
been subverted by the emergence among the constitutionalists of"membersof
the new sects and the naturalists".9 Despite asignificant victory in the debates on
the Supplementary Fundamental Law — the establishment of a committee of
mujtahids to ratify all legislation — he withdrew tothe shrine at Shah cAbd al
Azim inJuly 1907 asa gesture ofprotest. Ina series ofbroadsheets published
from the shrine, he further developed his objections to constitutionalism,
denouncing it as an importation from Europe incompatible with Islam and
therefore bid1at ("reprehensible innovation"), and called instead for mashruta-ji
mashruca,i.e., a constitutional government based upon, or at least compatible
with, the sharfa.10 This slogan soon became abbreviated to mashrifa, so that the
culama and their followers were polarized around the issue ofmashruta versus
mashruca. As Tabataba°I and Bihbahani had their supporters in Najaf, so too did
Nurl: Sayyid Muhammad Kazim Yazdl (d. 1919), at first inclined to neutrality
on the issue, was gradually persuaded to oppose constitutionalism, supported by
the Arab Shicls of Iraq and theOttoman authorities.11
The most detailed and coherent response to Nun's attacks on constitutional
ism came from the pen of another calim at Najaf, MIrza Muhammad Husain
Na^ni (d. 1936), apupil of Akhund Khurasan!. Inhis TanbJh al-Umma va Tan^ih

Na°inl threw back thecharge of bid cat at Nurl and hisparty, claiming that the
rejection ofconstitutionalism led ineluctably to support fortyranny, which was
bidcat in itself. Addressing himself to the undeniable novelty of constitutional
ism, Na°Ini presented it as a means of reducing the usurpatory nature of rule
during the occultation of the Imam, whose authority heinvoked bycastinghis
arguments in the form of a dream where the Imam hadaddressed him.12
Highly significant, and not always properly appreciated, is the common
ground that existed between theconstitutionalist culama and their opponents.
Both parties were agreed, for example, that the legislative functions of the Majlis
should be restricted tocurfiyat, i.e., matters not already decided onby the sharica;
that freedom of expression should notextend to matters deemed repugnant by
Islam; and that equality should not be taken tomean identical rights forMuslims
and non-Muslims orfor men and women.13 Their convergence ofviews on these
and associated matters was hidden by the passions ofthe time and by the fact that
each ofthe parties had itstactical allies: the constitutionalist culama, thesecular
liberals in the Majlis; and the so-called reactionaries, the royal court. Both
groups ofculama were motivated primarily by a concern forthe preservation of
Iran as an Islamic entity, and they differed primarily in their estimate of
constitutionalism as a means to that end. This became fully apparent with the
Russian attack onIran in 1911, when the culama sank their differences tocallfor
the defence of Muslim territory against the invaders.14
Even before that event, theconstitutionalist culama's enthusiasm hadbeen
dampened bythe execution of Shaikh Fazl-Allah Nuri inJuly 1909 at the hands
of revolutionary forces, which was seen by them as an affront to the whole
clerical estate, and still more bythe assassination, almost exactly a year later, of
Sayyid cAbd-Allah BihbahanI, by secular extremists associated with one wingof
the Majlis. Akhund Khurasan! is said to have foresworn allfurther support for
constitutionalism, and Na°InI tohave had all available copies ofhis book thrown
in the Tigris.15
The netresult of the Constitutional Revolution for theculama - their most
sustained and substantial exercise inpolitical involvement to that date — was to
induce in them distrust of constitutionalism and related forms of political
activity. After 1911, various independent culama, unconnected with the reli
gious institution, like Sayyid Hasan Mudarris during the early years ofthe

Pahlavl regime and Ayatullah Abui-Qasim Kashani in the postwar period,
continued toinvolve themselves inefforts for implementing the constitution.
But the leading culama, especially those enjoying the prestige oimarjalyat, held
determinedly aloof; for several decades their political activity remained sporadic
and reactive. cUlama in general, however, continued to be prominent in
movements ofresistance toforeign powers.
Thus when in 1911 Russia invaded Iran, attempting to restore Muhammad
All Shah tothe throne, coincidentally at a time when Italy had launched its
onslaught on Libya, fatvas were issued in Najaf by Akhund Khurasan!, Sayyid
Muhammad Kazim Yazdl, Shaikh cAbd-Allah Mazandaranl, and Shaikhal
Sharlca Isfahan!, calling for resistance tothe infidel invaders inboth Iran and
Libya.16 Not content with theissuing of fatvas, Mazandaranl organized a
military force to fight the Russians inIran, but partly because ofthe sudden
demise of Khurasan! and partly because of reassuring messages sent bythe
Iranian government, the force never proceeded beyond Kazimain.17
In the First World War, Iran officially proclaimed its neutrality, but both
Britain and Russia undertook military operations on its territory. A large part of
Iranian opinion sympathized inany event with the Ottomans and their allies,
and a national government, opposed toBritain and Russia, was establishedin
Qum; before long, it had toretreat first toKirmanshah and then to Istanbul.
One of the leading figures of this government was Sayyid Hasan Mudarris, later
to attain fame as the exemplary foe of Riza Shah. While generally sympathetic to
the Ottomans, Mudarris is said tohave had sharp exchanges with officials in
Istanbul, largely because of suspicions that the Ottomans were planning to
annex Azerbaijan.18
At the catabat, many of the Iranian culama, together with their Arab col
leagues, issued fatvas calling for jihad against the foes of the Ottomans.19 In this,
they were motivated not only by Pan-Islamic feelings (which had been revived
after the Young Turk Revolution of 1908), but also by fear for the ShIcI holy
places, menaced by the British invasion of Iraq. Decrees for jihad were given by
Sayyid Muhammad Kazim Yazdl, Mirza Muhammad Taq! Shlraz! (d. 1920), and
Shaikh al-Shar!ca Isfahan!. Some ofthe culama participated personally in the
fighting against the British, playing aparticularly notable role inthe long and
bloody battle atKut al-cAmara in 1916. Sayyid Mustafa Kashani, the father of

Ayatullah Kashani, was wounded there, and when the British finally triumphed,
a number ofculama, including Shlrazi, were taken prisoner.20
Jihad movements arose within Iran itself, especially in Fars. When a British
force occupied Bushahr (Bushire), local khans organized a resistance movement
that enjoyed the support of several culama, chief among them Shaikh
Muhammad Husain BurazjanI (d. 1936). Even before the occupation, BurazjanI
had clashed frequently with the British Consul-General in Bushahr, and now he
issued afatva calling for jihad that was distributed along the Persian Gulf coast.
Although the British succeeded in occupying Burazjan, center of the jihad,
resistance continued. InShlraz, additional fatvas were issued by Sayyid Abd
Allah BiladI Bihbahani, a mujtahid from Bushahr, and Shaikh Jacfar Mahallati
(d. 1938); the latter organized a column of volunteers which heled toward
Bushahr by way of Kazarun. The British evacuated Bushahr before he could do
battle with them. Mahallati was also influential in instigating an uprising of the
Shiraz gendarmerie that led tothe temporary expulsion from the city of the
British Consul.21
Distinct from the jihad around Bushahr was the struggle against the South
Persia Rifles, a force organized by theBritish to protect their interests in
southern Iran. The struggle was led by a khan ofthe Qashqa°i, Ismacil Khan
Saulat al-Daula, with the support ofSayyid Abd al-Husain Mujtahid Larl (d.
1924). A pupil ofMirza Hasan Shlrazi, Larl had already distinguished himself
through activities in support of the constitution and frustrating Christian
missionary efforts inFars. He too issued a fatva calling forjihad against the
British and recruited volunteers for Saulat al-Daula's force. Despite initial
successes, the mujahidin fell prey to internal dissension, and their movement
effectively collapsed some months before the end ofthe First World War.22
The aftermath of the war saw the rise of two insurrectionary movements of
general Islamic and patriotic inspiration. Unlike the jihad movements, these
both took place in the north of Iran.
Shaikh Muhammad KhiyabanI, leader of the Tabriz insurrection, was a
religious scholar of medium standing: all his studies hadtaken place in
Azarbaijan, and he never attained the rank of mujtahid. Nonetheless, he enjoyed
great prestige in Tabriz, and he represented the city in the second Majlis. He was
active during the First World War against the Ottoman forces in Azarbaijan. In
1920, together with his colleagues from the Democrat Party of Azarbaijan,

Khiyabani instituted anautonomous revolutionary government inTabriz that
renamed Azarbaljan asAzadistan ("Land ofFreedom"). Khiyabani's govern
ment lasted forsixth months before its suppression atthe hands ofthe Iranian
Cossack Brigade.23 Although restricted to Azarbaljan, Khiyabani's movement
was not separatist in intention; an echo of the constitutionalist movement, itwas
patriotic in its aims, and Islamic in itsemotional underpinning.
A more prolonged and significant movement was that launched in the forests
of the Caspian littoral byMirza Yunus, better known asMirza Kuchik Khan.
Not only was it the first guerilla movement in modern Iranian history; it also
posed for thefirst time theproblems inherent in any collaboration between
Muslims and the left. Mirza Kuchik Khan began life as astudent of the religious
sciences, first inhis native city and then atthe Mahmudlya madrasa in Tehran.
The royalist coup of 1908 caused him to abandon his studies andjoin the
constitutionalist fighters inhis native Rasht. In 1917, he launched a movement
of armed revolt directed both against the authority ofthe central government
and against thepresence of British andRussian forces in Iran. The Jangali
movement (so-called because ofits use ofthe forests ofGllan asa base) passed
through numerous vicissitudes before its final defeat in October 1921, when
Riza Khan (later Shah) entered Rasht atthe head of the Cossack Brigade. At the
height ofits power, the Jangali movement had 6,000 men under arms; was able
to extend its influence into Mazandaran; and gained defactorecognition from the
British for the government it established.24
The ideological identity of the movement is a confused and controversial
matter. Mirza Kuchik Khan isreputed tohave been punctilious infulfilling his
devotional duties; the newspaper ]angal,organ of the movement, proclaimed its
aims to be "protection of the rights of the Iranians and the enlightenment of the
Muslims"; and its first organizational core was provided by the HaiDat-i Ittihad-i
Islam ("Committee for Islamic Union") of Rasht.25 However, the Jangali
movement also counted among its members many of the first generation of
Iranian Marxists; the government it established in June 1920 bore the official
designation of the Soviet Republic of Gilan; and it established military and
political links with the Bolshevik Revolution. Mirza Kuchik Khan himself was
wont tospeak of"red revolution", "the struggle ofthe toilers against capital
ism", and socialism; and when heprotested to Lenin about the anti-religious

propaganda conducted by Russian Bolsheviks posted to Gilan, he cited only the
intensity of popular religious feeling in Iran, not any question of principle.26It
would be tempting to see in Mirza Kuchik Khan the Iranian equivalent of the
Muslim "National Communists" of Russia. Apparently, however, hemain
tained his Islamic beliefs and identity while borrowing heavily from the Bolshe
vik vocabulary of revolution andbelieving — erroneously, ashe came to realize
in the possibility ofa tactical alliance with the Bolshevik Revolution.27
Eight months before he marched into Rasht, to suppress the last remnants of
the Jangall movement, Riza Khan had carried out acoup d'etat in Tehran which
was to be the first step on his path to dictatorial power and the foundation ofthe
Pahlavi dynasty in December 1925. The sixteen years of rule by the first Pahlavi
can fairly be described asa period ofintense hostility toIslamic culture and
institutions; what western authors have approvingly called "reform" and
"modernization" was experienced by many — ifnot most — Iranians as a brutal
assault on their culture, traditions and identity.28 Nonetheless, no significant
obstacles were placed in thewayof Riza Shah by thechief religious authorities as
he rose to power. This wasin part dueto their disillusionment with constitution
alism, and in part due to the misleading effect created by Riza Shah's assiduous
and visible attendance atreligious ceremonies before his position was consoli
dated. But important, too, were aset of political contingencies connected with
Iraq.
The political activities of the Iranian culama resident in Iraq did not come to
an end with the First World War. Both Mirza Muhammad Taqi Shirazi and
Shaikh al-Sharfa IsfahanI opposed the British mandatory regime inIraq, and
when they died within afew months of each other in 1920, others came forward
to take their place: Na°Ini; AbuDl-Hasan IsfahanI (another student of Akhund
Khurasani); and Shaikh Muhammad Mahdl Khalisi, an Arab calim. In 1922, the
three organized a meeting in Karbala, attended by about 300,000 people,
protesting against British policy. The following year, Khalisi was deported to
the Hijaz, while Na^ini and IsfahanI, together with other Iranian culama, were
compelled to leave for Iran. There they were well received, by both the

government and the public, and in August 1923 they took up temporary
residence in Qum.29
In March 1924, negotiations with King Faisal of Iraq made it possible for
them to return to thecatabat, but their unsure position in Iraq may have
predisposed them tolook favorably onRiza Khan. Shortly before they set out
for Iraq, they met him in Qum, together with Shaikh cAbd al-Karim Hariri,
revivifier of the teaching institution {hau^ci) in Qum. They asked Riza Khan
(then Minister of War) to quell rumors of the impending substitution of a
republic, under hisauspices, for theQajar dynasty, republicanism being re
garded with abhorrence because ofthe association it had acquired with irreli
gion in neighbouring Turkey. Riza Khan complied soon after, in a telegram
addressed to the culama ofTehran.30 His wish to found arepublic, as ameans of
installing himself in power, had probably been authentic, and the fact that he
now renounced it in response toappeals from the culama tended tobestowon
him, in the short term, an appearance of legitimacy he would not otherwise have
had. InOctober, 1924, afatva was published over the signatures of Isfahani and
Na°ini declaring obedience toRiza Khan a religious duty.31 Doubts have been
expressed on the authenticity ofthe fatva, but it was never repudiated by either
Na°InI orIsfahani. Inany event, they consented toreceive Riza Khan whenhe
visited Najaf after their return to Iraq, and the meeting appears to have been
cordial. Na°ml died in 1936, and Abu^l-Hasan Isfahani, who from then until his
own death in 1946 was virtually thesole marjac-i taqlid of the Shici world,
refrained consistently from all political activity and comment for the rest ofhis
life.32
An important exception to the rule ofculama acquiescence in Riza Shah's
conquest of power was provided by Sayyid Hasan Mudarris. Born in 1870 intoa
family of preachers, he studied first in Isfahan and then at the catabat, under
MIrza Hasan Shirazi in Samarra and both constitutionalist and anti-constitu
tionalist scholars in Najaf. He became himself a convinced constitutionalist, and
was elected to the second and third Majlises as adeputy from Isfahan. Prominent
in theaffairs of the National Government during the First World War, he
returned to parliamentary life at the end of the war asDeputy Speaker of the
fourth Majlis. Re-elected tothe fifth Majlis, hestrove energetically but unsuc
cessfully —in collaboration with Dr Muhammad Musaddiq - against the

Pahlavl dynasty. He was able to survive for a time verbal and physical assaults by
the supporters of Riza Shah, but in 1929 he was arrested and banished to Khwaf
near the Afgan border. Eight years later he was transferred toKashmar, where
he was killed by a combination of poisoning and strangulation.33 The example of
Mudarris' militancy, coupled with the simplicity, even ascetism, of his personal
life, helped tokeep alive culama traditions ofhostility tomonarchy during the
years of Riza Shah's otherwise weakly contested autocracy.
The Pahlavi assault onthe position ofthe culama in Iranian society began
with a conscription law in May 1925 that arrogated to thestate theright to
examine religious students with aview to their exemption from military service.
Then came the promulgation ofa Civil Code, under the auspices of CA1IAkbar
Davar, Minister of Justice, ratified in May 1928. The attack onthe legal and
juridical functions of the culama that this implied continued, in November 1931,
with the restriction of the competence of sharica tribunals to matters of marriage,
divorce, and the appointment of trustees and guardians; and in March 1932,with
the termination of all notarial functions exercised by theculama. The latter
measure reduced to penury many lesser religious scholars who didnothave
access to the resources of the auqaf(endowments). Similarly, in 1936, legislation
was passed that effectively excluded culama from holding the position ofjudge.
Riza Shah was not content toexclude the culama from the administration of
law. In 1928, a law was passed providing for state examination of religious
students and the licensing ofreligious teachers. Taken further by a law in 1931
that provided forthe establishment of a syllabus forallmadrasas,this was an
unprecedented attempt to carry the hegemony of the state into the very heart of
the religious institution. In December 1928, Riza Shah promulgated (in imita
tion of Atatiirk, his mentor in many such matters) the Uniform Dress Law which
made it obligatory formen to wear a round peaked cap; exempted only were
religious scholars and students whose status, inthis case too, the government
took it upon itself to confirm.34 Still more offensive to most of contemporary
Iranian opinion was the compulsory uncovering ofwomen which was decreed
in alaw promulgated on 7 January 1936and enforced with considerable vigour.
Finally, mention may bemade of the Endowments Law of November, 1934
which gave the state wide discretionary powers tointervene inthe administra
tion of the auqaf and assume functions formerly fulfilled bytheculama.35

In addition to allthese measures, religious ceremonies, especially those
connected with the commemoration of Imam Husain's martyrdom atKarbala,
were subject to harassment or outright prohibition; this was true even ofQum
and Mashhad.36 Thewhole Pahlavi enterprise was, moreover, undergirded with
the attempt tocreate a surrogate, state-sanctioned culture, based on a cult of
modernism andethnic nationalism, that wasdesigned to destroy by attrition the
cultural hegemony ofIslam in Iran.
So ambitious aprogramme could not fail to elicit occasional expressions of
powerful hostility, despite thequiescence of the leading culama anddespite Riza
Shah's fairly effective apparatus of repression. Already in 1924, a minor uprising
had occurred inIsfahan, led by two culama, Hajj Aqa Nur-Allah Isfahan! and
Mulla Husain FisharakL It was occasioned in the first place by government
attempts to turn opium cultivation into astate monopoly, but other and more
general grievances were expressed. Hajj Aqa Nur-Allah gathered a throng of
merchants, artisans andpeasants, at thehead of which hemarched on Qum, with
the intention of picking up additional support and proceeding to Tehran. Once
in Qum,the movement stalled, and Hajj Aqa Nur-Allah died under suspicious
circumstances.37
Four years later, anculama-led movement of protest against compulsory
military service took place in Tabriz. The bazaar merchants closed their shops
when therecruiting mission arrived from Tehran, andwere persuaded to reopen
only when three recently imported machineguns were set up atthe entranceto
the bazaar. The two chief mujtahids of the city who had co-ordinated the
movement, Shaikh AbuDl-Hasan Angajl (d. 1939) and Mlrza Sadiq Aqa (d.
1932), were banished, first to Kurdistan and then to Qum.38
In March ofthe same year, ancalim in Qum, Ayatullah Muhammad Taqi
Bafqi (d. 1946), found himself confronting Riza Shah inperson after he had
publicly upbraided women from the court who were visiting the shrine bare
headed. Bafqi, who had already written to Riza Shah in protest againsthis
policies, sent the women a message saying: "if you are Muslim, why have you
come here in this state, and ifyou are not Muslim, why have you come hereat
all?" Riza Shah then came to Qumat the head of an armoured column, dragged
Bafqi down from the minbar, and carried him off to prison in Tehran.39
36 In an interview granted the present writer in December 1979, Ayatullah KhumainI recalled that the practice of rau^a-khwariim. the shrine at Qum would often lead tothe arrest ofthe participants. See K h o m e i n i , Islam and Revolution, p . 3 3 3 .

The most serious incident in the reign of Riza Shah — that which most closely
foreshadowed the events of 1963 and beyond - took place inMashhad in1935.
One of the chiei'ulama of the city, Hajj Aqa Husain Qummi, left Mashhad with
the intention of presenting his grievances, principally concerning the wearing of
European-style hats, to Riza Shah in person. He took up residence atShah cAbd
al- Azlm and soon a flood ofpeople came from Tehran to see him. The house
where he was staying was sealed off by the police, and Qumml found himself a
prisoner. When news ofhis predicament reached Mashhad, on 12 July, people
gathered in protest atthe shrine of Imam Riza. Troops entered the shrine, firing
indiscriminately, and dispersed the protestors. Ithappened to be the anniversary
of the day in 1912 when Russian troops had fired on the shrine. Two days later,
the well-known preacher Buhlul addressed a second protest meeting, at the
Gauhar Shad mosque. Once the gathering was underway, the army closed all
gates to the mosque, machineguns were mounted onitswalls, and the troops
began firing.40 The result was the largest single massacre enacted by the Pahlavis
before the events ofJune 1963. Buhlul himself managed toescape to Afghani
stan, where he was imprisoned for many years before making his way to Iraq and
then, after the Islamic Revolution, back to Iran.41 Qumml was exiled to Iraq,
where hedied in 1949. Numerous other culama — notably Aqazada Kara3!, the
son of Akhund Khurasan! — were arrested and imprisoned in Tehran.42
In effect, although not in intention, themost important response of the
culama to the policies of Riza Shah was therenewal and development of the
religious teaching institution (hauza) inQum by Shaikh cAbd al-Karim Ha°iri.
His scholarly andadministrative achievements, amplified andconfirmed by
those ofAyatullah Burujirdi, enabled Qum tobecome a bastion first ofIslamic
learning and then of Islamic militancy, thus defying the secularizing tendencies
of the twoPahlavis. Born near Yazd in i860, Ha°iri studied under great
authorities ofthe catabat such as Mirza Hasan ShlrazI and Akhund Khurasan!,
who were notable for their political as well as their scholarly activities. Early on,
however, he displayed an aversion topolitical involvement that remained with
him throughout his career. When controversies surrounding the constitution
erupted in Najaf, heleft forArak, only to find even that relatively minor city
engulfed inpolitical turmoil. He therefore returned to Iraq, moving back and
forth between Najaf and Karbala to avoid the storm of politics. In sharp contrast

to themajority of his colleagues, he was notinvolved even in thejihad
movement of 1911. In 1913, hemoved back to Arak, leading there an uneventful
life ofteaching and scholarship until 1922.43
It was then that he was persuaded to move to Qum and revive the hauza of
that city. Qumhadbeen an early centre of Shici scholarship, and its madrasas had
enjoyed high repute as recently astheearly 19th century. Bythebeginning of the
20th century, however, many of them had fallen into disuse and ruin, andthe
chief significance of Qum wasas place of pilgrimage. The first steps to reviving
the hauza were taken by Ayatullah Faiz Qummi, who established his teaching
circle inQum in 1916;Ayatullah Bafql, who settled there in 1919; and Sayyid
Abu^l-Hasan Rafil Qazvini, a teacher ofgnosis and philosophy. It was Bafql
who went to Arak at the head of a delegation of the scholars of Qum to persuade
Ha°iri tomove there.44 •
Ha°irl was followed toQum by many of his students from Arak, including
Riih-Allah Khumaini, then twenty years old.Hispresence in Qumalso proved a
magnet for many other prominent scholars, such as Ayatullah Sadr al-Din Sadr
(d. 1954), Ayatullah Muhammad Kazim Sharicatmadari (d. 1986), and Ayatullah
Shihab al-Din Marcashi (still living).45 Ha°iri remained, however, the
undisputed director (%aclrri) ofthe entire hauza until his death in 1936,and as
such might have provided a focus for religious opposition toRiza Shah. But
only once was he moved to protest, in circumspect terms, against government
policy: in 1928he sent atelegram tothe Shah objecting tothe Uniform Dress
Law.46 Recent writers, seeking to uphold the thesis of an unbroken lineof
culama opposition to the state, have attributed Ha°irfs quietism to a far-sighted
concern for the welfare and preservation ofhauza at a time ofintense autoc
racy.47 It is more probable that it was the product of his temperament, a habit
established before hecame to Qum. Nonetheless, the effect of his apparent
indifference to the policies of the regime was indeed to secure for the hauza the
minimal government tolerance it needed to survive.
In September 1941, Riza Shah was deposed by the Allies, and after a brief
period in which the British contemplated a Qajar restoration, his son,
Muhammad Riza, waspermitted to succeed him. Thechange of ruler, combined

with the disruptions brought about by the Second World War and the compet
ing interventions inIran ofBritain, the United States and the Soviet Union,
permitted a resurgence of political activity under conditions of relative freedom.
cUlama soon came forward to explore the new possibilities: they demanded an
end to the ban on Muharram celebrations and to the prohibition of Islamic dress
for women.48 Muhammad Riza Shah, still unsure of himself, assented tothese
demands.
These were relatively unimportant matters, unconnected with the main
issues that agitated Iran between the deposition ofRiza Shah and the royalist
coup of August 1953: limiting thepowers of the monarchy and securing national
independence, primarily through the nationalization ofthe oil industry. The
most prominent among theculama whoaddressed themselves to these issueswas
Ayatullah Abu^l-Qasim KashanI, whohadearly imbibed the lessons of militancy
from his father, Sayyid Mustafa, in Iraq. After the death of Sayyid Mustafa,
Ayatullah KashanI had founded theMadrasa-yi cAlavi in Najaf, including
military training in its curriculum, an unheard of innovation. Participating, like
many other Iranian culama, in the resistance to the British, he found itnecessary
to leave Iraq for Iran in 1921.There heestablished initially friendly contacts with
Riza Shah, and although he is said later to have protested against certain of his
policies, there is no evidence of significant political activity on hispart before the
Second World War. He was arrested by the British in 1943 because of contacts
with German agents and not released until 1945.49
His first postwar clash with the government came in 1946 when he wasplaced
under house arrest near Qazvln for opposing a law restricting freedom of the
press. In May 1948, he called publicly for the dispatch of Iranian volunteersto
Palestine to help forestall the establishment of a Jewish State; this was the first
sign of emphatic interest shown byleading Iranian culama in the Palestine
question and its ramifications. It wasalso the beginning of about three years'co
operation between KashanI and the organization ofthe Fida^Iyan-i Islam. In
1949, KashanI was exiled to Beirut, ostensibly because of suspicions that hewas
involved in an attempted assassination of the Shah, but more probably because
he had articulated — for the very first time — thedemand for the nationalization of
the Iranian oil industry. In the spring of1950, he returned triumphantly to Iran
and was elected tothe Majlis.
Now began a period ofcollaboration between KashanI and the National

Front ofMusaddiq (who was appointed prime minister in April 1951), aimedat
securing the nationalization ofthe oil industry. Ahighpoint was reached when
Kashani played adecisive role in organizing the mass demonstrations of21 July
1952 that led to the fall of the government of Qavam al-Saltana and the return of
Musaddiq to the premiership with greater public support than before. Musaddiq
showed himself unwilling to acknowledge his debt to Kashani, and relations
between the two men came increasingly under strain. Attempts undertaken in
January 1953 toeffect a reconciliation proved fruitless, because of Musaddiq's
insistence on retaining extraordinary powers and the fears that were aroused in
Kashani — as well as other culama — by his increasingly friendly relations with the
Tuda Party. Whether Kashamplayed arole in the royalist coup of August 1953,
orchestrated bythe British and American intelligence services, is a matter of
controversy. What is certain is that he did nothing to stop it, and that individuals
close tohim — notably Ayatullah Muhammad Bihbahani — played some rolein
securing its success.50
Kashanl's old oppositional habits resurfaced under the post-Musaddiq
dispensation: he protested against the resumption of diplomatic ties with
Britain, themanipulation of elections to theMajlis, and the 1954 agreement
concluded with an international consortium for the operation of the oil industry.
In 1955, hewas arrested, belatedly accused of complicity with the Fida°iyan-i
Islam in the assassination of prime minister Razmara in March 1951. Butthe
government could afford to release him, in January 1956, for his political
influence was atan end, and his death inMarch 1962 went largely unnoticed.51
Kashani was nottheonly calim active in politics between 1941 and1953.
Mention may also be made of Ayatullah Muhammad Taqi Khwansari (d. 1952),
who issued a fatva in support of nationalizing the oil industry;52 Ayatullah AbuDl
Fazl Zanjani, who was continuously loyal toMusaddiq and the National Front;
and Ayatullah All Akbar Burquci, who had links with Tuda-affiliated organiza
tions.53 The first post-war decade was also the time inwhich Ayatullah Sayyid
Mahmud TalaqanI (d. 1979) began his long oppositional career: he broadcast on
behalf ofMusaddiq; attempted toprevent the split between him and Kashani;
and preached atthe Hidayat mosque in central Tehran on themes both religious
and political.54 Firmly set against all political activity onthe part ofthe culama

was Ayatullah AqaHusain Burujirdi, supreme religious authority of the period.
After the death ofHa°iri in 1936,atriumvirate composed of Ayatullahs Sadr,
Hujjat and Khwansarl had administered thehauza in Qum, butthis was
understood to be atemporary expedient. In December 1944, agroup of culama
from Qum persuaded Burujirdi to move to their city and assume leadership of
the hauza. A little less than two years later, AbuDl-Hasan IsfahanI, chief marjac-i
taqlld ofthe day, died, and within roughly a year Burujirdi had emerged as
successor to hisposition. Hethus came to combine in hisperson thefunctions of
zaclm of the hauza and supreme marjac-i taqlld, and he remained the chief
religious authority ofthe Shlci world until his death in March, 1961.55
Born in Burujird in 1875, Ayatullah Burujirdi began to acquire his vast
erudition in hisnative city before leaving for Isfahan in 1892andNajaf in 1901 or
1902. There hebecame a favoured student of Akhund KhurasanI, without
acquiring his constitutionalist proclivities, as well as studying with Sayyid
Muhammad Kazim Yazdland Shaikh al-Shar!ca IsfahanI. In 1910,hereturned to
Burujird, where he remained almost uninterruptedly until the move to Qumat
the end of 1944.
The hauza flourished under Burujirdl's stewardship. Hewasa master of fiqh,
and is said to have created anewschool of that discipline, onegoing back beyond
the well-known manuals of recent composition to the sources of Islamic lawin
QurDan andTradition.56 Butequally important were hisadministrative and fiscal
capacities. A central register of agents for the collection of revenue around the
country for the support of the hauza wasestablished for the first time, and it is
estimated that by 1961 five million rials a month were being channelled to
Qum.57 This revenue permitted considerable building activity both in Qum (the
Masjid-i Aczam next to theshrine wasbuilt at Burujirdl's behest) and elsewhere,
and also helped to increase the number of the students at the hauza to some six
thousand by the time ofBurujirdi's death.
Burujirdi was a man ofunusually broad vision. He patronized schoolsof
modern type, where natural sciences were taught together with Islamic
knowledge; sent emissaries to various countries in Africa, Asia and Europe; and
instituted friendly contacts with theAzhar with a view to a SunnI—ShIcI
rapprochement. However, he was almost unwaveringly quietist in political
matters, going so far as to convene a conference ofculama in February 1949 that
sought to ban culama participation in political activity. Not averse to quiet

pressure on the government for limited purposes, he was inoccasional touch
with the court, both before and after August 1953. His only overt political
activity came in the spring of1955, when he lent his authority to the anti-Baha^I
campaign of that year, and inFebruary i960, when he denounced the planned
limitation of private agrarian holdings as contrary to Islamic law.58 On the great
political issues ofthe 1941—53 period, heremained adamantly silent.
The history of the first postwar decade is notable for the emergence of Islamic
organizations that, radically different intheir aims, had incommon independ
ence from direction or even significant participation by the culama. Itcan even
be said that these organizations were motivated, to some degree, by what they
perceived as the shortcomings of the clerical class, particularly its upper
echelons.
Early in 1945, a26-year old student of the religious sciences, Sayyid Mujtaba
MIrlauhl, better known as Navvab Safavi, founded the Fida°iyan-i Islam, the
first political grouping in 20th-century Iran to conceive of the goal of an Islamic
state and towork actively toward attaining it.59 Although the Fida°Iyan were
briefly allied with KashanI and for long enjoyed the support of TalaqanI, their
organization did not include even middle-ranking culama. As for BurujirdI, he
was bitterly opposed to the Fida°Iyan and insisted on the removal of their Qum
headquarters from the FaizTya madrasa.60 The constituency addressed by the
Fida°Tyan-i Islam was the religiously oriented segments of the disaffected urban
poor; hence the radical methods they used and the programme they proposed.
The most conspicuous method used by the Fida°Iyan was the assassination of
persons considered dangerous to the interests of Islam and Iran. The first to be
struck down by the Fida^iyan was the anti-ShIcI writer and ideologue, Ahmad
Kasravi, killed in 1946. Then came the elimination ofMinister ofthe Court,
Abd al-Husain Hazhir, in September 1949, and Prime Minister Razmara in
March 1951,both men being identified as agents of British policy in Iran. It is
possible, though notproven, that theman who attempted to assassinate
Muhammad Riza Shah in February 1949 was a member of the Fida^Iyan-i
Islam.61
Like KashanI but earlier than him,the Fida°Iyan-i Islam distanced themselves
from Musaddiq, despite their support for hisnational goals; accordingly,
Musaddiq had Navvab Safavi arrested in June 1951. The organization
nonetheless survived and briefly renewed its collaboration with KashanI. It was

thoroughly dispersed after thecoup of August 1953. Safavi and his chief
lieutenant, Khalil Tahmasibl, were executed in January 1956, after manfully
undergoing severe and prolonged torture. Although claimants to the mantle of
Navvab Safavi emerged after the triumph ofthe Islamic Revolution (notably
Hujjat al-Islam Sadiq Khalkhall), the Fida°iyan-i Islam had no real prolongation
beyond the 195 os. Their example of militancy did, however, foreshadow the rise
of the Islamically oriented guerilla movements of the late 1960s and the 1970s.
Also of lasting interest was the radical political and social programme that the
Fida°Iyan~i Islam put forward. In Kahnama-yi Haqa^iq ("A Guide to Truths"),a
manifesto published inlate 1950, they demanded that the Shah be boundby
Islamic law and constitutionally subject to dismissal and replacement if he
contravened it.62 They further demanded that "the legitimate rights of the poor
must be given to them, in accordance with the criteria of Islam", and proposed
measures such as the provision of free health-care, the construction of low-cost
housing, andthefree distribution of all uncultivated agrarian land. This
programme, couched in harsh, uncompromising language, was the first sign of
the concern for social justice that became marked among Muslim thinkers and
writers ofthe 1970s.63
By contrast with the FidaDiyan-i Islam, the Anjumanha-yi Islam! ("Islamic
Associations") that came into being in the 1940s reflected theneeds and
preoccupations of pious sections of the middle classes: their overwhelming
concern was educational, to present Islam as a religion compatible with
modernity, science and rationality, and to free it from what their members
regarded as superstitions. Although few of those involved inthe work ofthe
associations were culama, they owed their origin to the Kanun-iIslam ("Islamic
Association"), an educational group founded inTehran in 1941 by Ayatullah
Talaqani. In1942, former members of the Kanun-i Islam who were studentsat
the Faculty of Medicine of Tehran University, established an Islamic Students'
Association under the patronage of Mahdi Bazargan, then professor of
thermodynamics. Similar organizations soon came into being in Mashhad,
Shlraz and Tabriz. When the members of these student associations graduated,
they went on tofound a series of Islamic professional organizations, the most
important being those of the doctors, engineers and teachers. The chief activity
of the associations was the organizing oflectures, many ofwhich were later
published inbook form. Most of the writings ofBazargan - important inthe
development of a modernist Islamic literature in Iran — had their origin in

lectures delivered to the Islamic associations. With their concentration on
cultural activity, directed to overcoming the alienation from Islam of many of
the secularly educated, the Islamic Associations had considerable success; they
paved theway for CA1I Sharicatl, who addressed thesame problem more
thoroughly and radically.64
Although the discussion of political topics was forbidden in the associations
as amatter of policy, many of their members were active politically in parallel
organizations: the Nahzat-i Muqavamat-i Milll ("National Resistance Move
ment"), founded in 1953by Ayatullah Talaqani, and the Nahzat-i Azadi-yi Iran
("Freedom Movement ofIran") founded in 1961 by Talaqani, Bazargan and
Yad-Allah Sahabi. Thelatter movement, loosely affiliated to the National Front,
was one of the most important oppositional organizations during the 1960s,a
fact attested bythe repeated imprisonment of its leadership.65 Essentially a
reformist group, it demanded implementation ofthe 1907 Constitution and
attempted to harmonize Islamic and liberal-nationalist sentiment. Most
members of the provisional government appointed by Imam Khumaini as the
revolution was reaching its end belonged to theNahzat-i AzadI, and the
movement has survived — although with increasing difficulty — down tothe
present.
The death of Burujirdi in 1961 prompted not only the customary search fora
successor (orsuccessors) to the position of marjac-i taqlid, butalso a re
examination ofthe function ofthe marjac and, more broadly, ofthe roleof
religion in Iranian society. Burujirdfs political role had proved disappointing,
although few people (least of all his pupils) were prepared to say so openly, and
in any event the modernist outlook fostered by men like Bazargan sought to
rationalize and make more effective the functioning of the marjac. Thus a
collective volume published in 1961 (soon reprinted because of its popularity)
called for a collective marjaciyat, based on specialization by mujtahids in
different areas of concern; complete financial autonomy for the religious
institution; and the presentation of Islam, within the religious institution and to
the public at large, asa total system oflife and belief — an ideology.66
The first of these demands was made obsolete, and the last of them fulfilled,
by the appearance of Imam (then Ayatullah) Khumaini (d. 3June 1989), first asa

marjac-i taqlid and then as a spokesman for national grievances capable of
reaching a mass audience. Khumaini first gained recognition as a marjac in Qum
and was soon followed as such bymany people across the country. Other
mujtahids, however, also emerged as partial successors to theposition of
Burujirdl: Ayatullah Muhsin al-Hakim (d. 1970) and AbuDl-Qasim Khu^i in
Najaf; Ayatullah Had! Milan! (d. 1975)inMashhad; and Ayatullahs Marcashi,
GulpayganI and Sharfatmadari in Qum. Even after the triumph of the Islamic
Revolution, Khumaini did not become sole marjac-i taqlid. Decisive for his
unique historical impact was not the mechanics oftaqlid but the vibrant and
powerful vision of Islam he developed early in life coupled with the abilityto
transmit it, imperiously and convincingly, toothers: first tohis students, and
then to the Iranian nation atlarge. In 1962, the realization began to dawn that
with Khumaini a completely new type of religious leadership had become
available.67
Born in September 1902, in the south-west Iranian city of Khumain, toone
Sayyid Mustafa, son of an Iranian calim whohad recently migrated back to Iran
from India, Ruh-Allah Khumaini lost hisfather in thefirst year of his life, killed
by bandits as he wastravelling to Arak.68 He wasbrought up by his mother and
his paternal aunt, aresourceful and strong-willed woman, and then, after both
women had died in a single year, by his elder brother, Murtaza (now know
known as Ayatullah Pasandida). At the age of19he joined the circle of Shaikh
cAbd al-Karim Ha°iri inArak, whom he promptly followed toQum the next
year. Abrilliant scholar from the outset, Khumaini first excelled in cirfin, that
distinctive ShIcI form ofgnosis that led a marginal and sometimes dangerous
existence in the religious institution. Most ofhis early writings were onthis
topic, and itwasalso the first subject in which he offered instruction, having as
his pupils such close associates as Ayatullah Hasan cAli Muntaziri (whowas at
the time of writing thedesignated successor to Khumaini's constitutional
functions as leader of the Islamic Republic) and Ayatullah Murtaza Mutahharl
(d. 1979). As teacher and writer, Khumaini later moved on toother concerns,
but practical involvement with cirfan andtheinner life remained an integral part
of his personality, touching even onhis political activity.
Early inhis career at Qum, Khumaini also aroused attention through the
67 Interview of the present writer with Hujjatal-Islam cAlIAkbarHashimIRafsanjani, Tehran, 22 December 1979. 68 On the life of Khumaini before 1962, see Algar, "Imam Khomeini, 1902-1962: The Prerevolutionary Years". My use of the title "Imam" for Khumaini, instead of the obsolete "Ayatullah", still favoured by most Western writers, reflects current Iranian usage, which is based on theperception that he exerted a directive andguiding role beyond that of any Ayatullah.

lectures he gave on ethics; having as their point ofdeparture the well-known
book onethical advancement, the Mana^il al-Sciirin of Khwaja cAbd-Allah
Ansari (d. 1089), the lectures also touched on matters of political concern, and
they drew alarge audience from places as far afield as Tehran and Isfahan.69 In
general, however, as a still junior member of the religious institution, Khumaini
was bound todefer tothe example ofquietism set by Ha°iri.
Some three years after the removal ofRiza Shah, Khumaini made his first
written proclamation of a political nature. Taking ashis text Qur3an, 34:46
("Say: 'Ienjoin upon you one thing only, that you rise up for God,singly andin
pairs'"), averse that he has often cited in different contexts, Khumaini stressed
that theprophets themselves had "risen up for God"; while fully absorbed inthe
contemplation of God, they had fought tobring about transformations in the
social and political conditions of men. Bycontrast, contemporary Muslims were
"rising up" for the sake of worldly interests alone; the result wasrule by foreign
powers and their agents, like Riza Shah, "that illiterate Mazandarani".70
Also in 1944, Khumaini wrote Kashfal-Asrar ("TheUnveiling of Secrets"), a
book which wasin thefirst place the refutation of Asrar-i Ha^arsala ("Millennial
Secrets"), an anti-religious tract written bya certain Hakimzada (pseudonym for
the errant son of Hajj Shaikh Mahdi Qummi, an calim in Qum),as well as the
works of Ahmad Kasravl. Butequally important wasthepolitical component of
Kashfal-Asrar. a sustained and bitter attack on the policies of Riza Shah (and, by
implication, his successor) coupled with KhumainFs first adumbration of
vilayat-ifaqlh ("the governance of xhefaqih"), the doctrine which was to become
the cornerstone of the constitution of the Islamic Republic. InKashf al-Asrar,
vilayat-i faqlh is not yet presented as aself-evident truth, and some allowance is
made for the institution of monarchy, providing the monarch ischosen by an
assembly of properly qualified mujtahids and adheres to Islamic law. Even such
an arrangement, however, would be provisional; itshould obtain only "as long
as nobetter system \ni%am\ can beestablished".71 Thirty five years later, he
judged that possibility tohave arisen.
Khumaini wasamong theculama of Qum whoencouraged Burujirdi to settle
there in 1944. Itis said that his support for him wasinspired by the hope that he
would engage himself more effectively in the political realm than Ha°iri had
done.72 This hope was disappointed, although Burujirdi is reputed occasionally

to have consulted Khumaini on political matters.73 Apart from Burujirdi,
Khumaini had some contact with both Navvab Safavi and Ayatullah KashanI,
but between 1944 and 1962 he eschewed political activity in favour of the
teaching of fiqh. In his classes on this subject, the core of the madrasa
curriculum, Khumaini trained and inspired a whole generation ofculama who
went on to become the organizers of revolution. Hisclasses were marked byan
unusual ability to relate fiqh to gnostic, rational andpolitical concerns, and were
so popular that they became thebest attended in Qum, with thesingle exception
of those ofBurujirdi. After the death ofBurujirdi, the number attending them
rose to 1,200, an unprecedented figure in the history of the hauza.74
Khumaini's public campaign against thePahlavi state began in theautumn of
1962 when heled a successful campaign forthe repeal ofnew laws governing
elections to local and provincial councils. Those laws were regarded as
objectionable because they removed the requirement that members of the
councils be sworn into office on the Qur^an; the fear wasthat this would permit
Baha^is open participation in political life.75
More significant clashes with the government came early the following year.
A referendum washeld on 26January 1963toobtain the appearance of popular
support fora package of measures known officially asthe White Revolution.
The referendum wasaccompanied by widespread fraud and intimidation,
especially inQum,and the measures proposed for approval were perceivedby
many, including Khumaini, as strengthening thedictatorial authority ofthe
Shah and American hegemony in Iran76. Hence Khumaini — foremost butnot
alone among theculama — began denouncing theShah's regime with rising
vehemence, criticizing also the unofficial but important links that the Shah was
forging with Israel. On 22 March 1963, paratroopers attacked the Faiziya
madrasa inQum, the site ofKhumaini's classes and preaching, inwhat was the
largest and bloodiest assault on a religious gathering since the Gauhar Shad
incident in 1935.Undeterred, Khumaini continued hiscondemnation ofthe
government, focusing ever more specifically on the Shah himself. On the day of
Ashura, the anniversary of Imam Husain's martyrdom (which fell in 1963 on 3
June), he denounced the government as "fundamentally opposed to Islam" and
in league with Israel and the United States in hostility tothe Qur^an. He then

warned the Shah that a day might come when he would have to flee Iran and the
people would rejoice in the streets — an exact prediction of what happened on 16
January 1979.77
Khumaini was thereupon arrested, and an insurrection broke out in several
cities across the country, everywhere led by culama sympathetic tohis cause.
After several days of slaughter bythe security forces, the Shah was able to
surmount this, the most serious challenge to his position since the coup of195 3.
However, the uprising of15 Khurdad (the day in the Iranian calendar on which
it began) marked the beginning of a new period in Iranian history in general, and
culama—state relations in particular. As the repressive and dictatorial nature of
the Shah's regime hardened thereafter, fortified by the unwavering support of
the United States, thegoals of a growing segment of the culama, led by
Khumaini, became progressively more radical and ambitious; they also became
more attractive to Iranian public opinion. The uprising can therefore be
designated asthe forerunner ofthe Islamic Revolution. It foreshadowed the
revolution also in that secular political personalities and parties played no
significant role in it.
Khumaini was released from arrest inAugust 1963, as a result of popular
pressure onthe regime, articulated byall the leading culama ofthe day. He
continued to denounce the government with the result that he was rearrested in
October, being held this time until May 1964.Again he resumed his campaign,
his denunciations of the government reaching acrescendo on 27 October 1964
when he condemned the recently concluded agreement on the status of
American personnel in Iran as high treason.78 Arrested for the third time, hewas
now sent into exile in Turkey. There he stayed until October 1965, when hewas
permitted - again as a result ofpressure on the government — to leave for the
more congenial and appropriate destination of Najaf, which was destined to be
his home for thirteen years.
Contrary to what is sometimes supposed, Khumaini did not disappear from
the public consciousness in Iran to re-emerge, almost accidentally, as the leader
of the revolution in 1978. His name frequently surfaced inthe course ofanti
governmental demonstrations: for example, inthose at Tehran University in
December 1970and those at Qum in June 1975.Nor was itaquestion simply of
memories from 1963: throughout his period ofresidence inNajaf, Khumaini
issued proclamations and messages concerning events in Iran (such as the
coronation in 1967,the commemoration of2,500 years of monarchy in Iranin

1971, and the formation of the one-party system in 1975), which were smuggled
into Iran and circulated there.
There also found its wayto Iran the printed text of a series of lectures onthe
subject ofIslamic government that hedelivered in Najaf early in 1970.The
subtitle of the book, vilayat-i faqih ("the governance ofthefaqih") was a surer
guide to its contents than the title, Hukiimat-i Is/ami ("Islamic Government"),
for it wasnot Khumaini's concern to provide either a full account of the political
philosophy of Shici Islam or a detailed sketch of the structure of an Islamic state.
His aim was rather to elucidate, in amore detailed and decisive manner than he
had done inKashf a/-Asrar, the doctrine that the culama were the heirs to the
political authority of the Twelve Imams, by reviewing all the relevant textsin
Qur3an and Tradition. To this textual discussion he appended acritique of the
"pseudo-saintly" within the religious institution, whoeven after the uprising of
June 1963 persisted in a pious avoidance ofpolitics; and a summons tothe
culama torise up and mobilize the people toestablish Islamic government.79
Individuals and organizations were active inside Iran propagating
KhumainFs messages andconsolidating themovement that hadcome into being
in 1963. Ayatullahs Mutahharl, Muntaziri, Bihishtl and Anvar! were known, in
many circles, to be his representatives and to speak (although not explicitly) on
his behalf. Occasionally some ofthem were able tovisit him inNajaf, as did
leaders of the Iranian Muslim students in Europe and North America, a group
that became important in the aftermath of the revolution.80 Soon after the
exiling of Imam Khumaini, there came into being the HaiDatha-yi Mu3talifa-yi
Islam! ("Allied Islamic Associations"), anorganization based in Tehran but
having branches throughout the country.81 Active init were individuals who
assumed important responsibilities after the revolution, notably Hujjat al-Islam
All Akbar HashimI Rafsanjani, Dr Javad Bahunar, and Muhammad All Raja3!.
In January, 1965, four members of this organization, ledby Muhammad
Bukhara0!, assassinated Hasan All Mansur, the prime minister responsible for
the exiling of Khumaini. They were executed soon after, and the organization
came under severe attack, in spite ofwhich it managed to survive.
The example ofdirect, armed action, given by Bukhara3!, was taken up in
1965 by the Hizb-i Milal-i Islam! ("Islamic Nations' Party"), a group led by
Muhammad Kazim BujnurdI, son of an calim resident in Najaf. Before they

could put their plans into effect, the members of the group were discovered by
the security police.82. Despite its short life, the Hizb-i Milal-i IslamI, withits
assumption that guerilla activity was more profitable than mass uprisings
against the regime, influenced the rise ofthe more protracted guerilla move
ments ofthe 1970s.
Less overtly political than these organizations was the Husainiya-yi Irshad,
an institution innorth Tehran designed — like the Islamic Associations led by
Bazargan and hiscolleagues —to win thesecularly educated to Islam. Its
immediate forerunner had been the Anjuman-i Mahana-yi Dim ("The Monthly
Religious Society"), organized in i960 by Ayatullah Mutahhari. Incollabora
tion with Ayatullah Bihishti and other well-known scholars, Mutahhari ar
ranged for monthly public lectures that sought to demonstrate the relevance of
Islam to contemporary concerns; published under the title of Guftar-i Mah
("Discourse ofthe Month"), these lectures proved very popular. The associ
ation was banned in March 1963.83
The Husainiya-yi Irshad opened its doors in 1965, administered by a board of
governors that included Ayatullah Mutahhari, who also lectured at the institu
tion and edited and contributed to many of its publications. However,the
dominant and most influential figure atthe Husainiya-yi Irshad came to be the
celebrated Dr All Sharicati. Mutahhari found himself at odds with several
points inSharicati's outlook, and accordingly he discreetly withdrew from the
Husainiya-yi Irshad before its closure by the government in 1973.84
All Sharicati was born at Mazinan near Sabzavar into a traditionally religious
family that later settled in Mashhad.85 His father, Muhammad Taqi Sharicatl, was
prominent in local Islamic circles, and compiled acommentary on parts of the
QurDan that was well received. The younger Sharicati's political engagement
began early, while he was still a student at the University of Mashhad. Active on
behalf of a short-lived group known as the Susyallstha-yi Khudaparast ("The
God-Worshipping Socialists") and Ayatullah Talaqani's Nahzat-i Muqavamat-i
Milli, he was jailed in 1959. Not long after his release, he went to study in Paris, a
cardinal event in his life that allowed him to become acquainted with numerous
currents of political and sociological thought. He studied under scholars such as
Louis Massignon and Jacques Berque; established contact with the activists and

ideologues of the Algerian Revolution, most importantly Frantz Fanon, whose
Wretched ofthe Earth he translated into Persian; and helped to bring into beinga
European branch of the Nahzat-i AzadL Thechief result of Sharfati's sojourn in
France was that, merging the insights and knowledge he had gained there with
the traditional Islamic education he had received from his father, he was able to
create a new form ofreligious discourse that proved immensely attractive in
Iran, particularly tothe young.86
Returning to Iran in 1964,Sharfati was arrested at the frontier and detained
for several months. In 1965, he was able to obtain a teaching post at the
University of Mashhad, strangely enough in the Department of History, despite
his well-known aversion for that discipline (at least as itwas then cultivatedin
Iran). Soon dismissed because of the content of his teaching, Sharfati moved to
Tehran, where his remarkable lectures soon became the principal source of
attraction at theHusainlya-yi Irshad. After theclosure of this institution,
Sharfati went into hiding, but he was soon discovered and imprisoned for some
eighteenth months. After his release, he was kept under strict surveillance until
May 1977when he was permitted to leave for England. There, on 19 June, he
died suddenly under mysterious circumstances that aroused immediate suspi
cions of foul play and earned for him, in the eyes of many, the rank of martyr.
The thought of Sharfati defies easy condensation into afew central theses.87
Unfinished, restless, speculative, subject to endless revision, his ideas represen
ted —toborrow one ofhis own formulations —a "becoming" (shudan), nota
"being" (budari). Most ofhis books were, moreover, the slightly edited tran
scripts of the numerous lectures he gave, not carefully conceived philosophical
or ideological exercises. But it wasprecisely in this urgent, provisional, explora
tory quality of Sharf ati's work that much ofits attraction lay.
Central to Sharfatfs thought and the influence it exerted was a radical
distinction between Islam as culture and Islam as ideology. He denounced the
former as devoid of social value, moral commitment and revolutionary poten
tial, and espoused the latter as "the true Islam" — a revolutionary creed refusing
compromise and imbued with the spirit of self-sacrifice. "I seek a return to Islam
as ideology; what exists now (among the masses and the religious scholars) is
Islam as culture."88
86 A whole series ofwriters were indebted toSharicatl for their terms and ideas; not significant as individuals, as a group they testify to thedepth of his impact. 87 S e e f o r a n a l y s e s o f h i s t h o u g h t : A k h a v i , op. cit.y p p . 1 5 0ff;idem, " c A l i S h a r i c a t l s Gesellschaftstheorie"; Richard, Der verborgene Imam, pp. 113-22; Algar, "Social Justice"; and Yavari-d'Hellencourt, "Leradicalisme Shfite de cAli Sharicati". 88 Sharfati, Islamshinasl (Tehran, n.d.), p. 97.

A related distinction was that which he drew between Safavid Shicism and
cAlavi Shicism, the former being a reactionary distortion of the authentic creed
and practice ofthe Twelve Imams, a reduction ofit tosuperstition and empty
formality.89
The return toIslam as ideology meant a new emphasis onthe social roleof
religion, coupled with animpatient rejection oftheological and metaphysical
niceties. Thus he once described tauhld^^ "descending from the heavens to the
earth" and "leaving circles ofdiscussion and debate . . . to enter the affairs of
society andpose thevarious questions that areinvolved in social relation
ships".90 Tauhid implies an egalitarian, classless society; shirk, the clash of
competing social classes. In the same connection, Sharicati elevated to the
position ofuniversal paradigm the struggle ofCain and Abel, mentioned only
elliptically in the Qur3an: everywhere in history and society he discerned a "pole
of Abel", led bythe prophets and their true successors, and a "pole of Cain",
composed ofthe usurpers ofpower and wealth and the official clergy subordi
nate to them.91
All of this meant a critical and revisionist attitude to theculama themselves.It
would befalse to portray Sharicatl asa simple anti-clerical. In one celebrated
passage, hecompared favorably the culama's record ofopposition to tyranny
and foreign intervention with the treachery of numerous secular intellectuals.92
Nonetheless, hedid propound the fateful thesis ofan "Islam minus akhunds*'\
and the language and terminology he used was of a nature to alienate many
senior culama. Thanks tothe discretion ofMutahhari and a prudent silenceon
the part ofAyatullah KhumainI inNajaf, the tensions that were created by the
phenomenon of Sharlcatl were held in check until the revolution, and the impact
of his person and ideas counted formuch in the triumph of that movement.
Afterwards, however, the same tensions erupted with considerable force,
providing some of the ideological background to thepolitical contests that
raged during the first two or three years of the Islamic Republic.
Politically and ideologically, Sharicatl may beregarded asbelonging to the
line of Bazargan, although hewas aninfinitely more radical and imaginative
thinker. Likewise, the best-known Islamic guerilla movement of the 1970s, the
Sazman-i Mujahidm-i Khalq ("The Organization ofPeople's Strugglers") also
can be characterized as the radical offspring of the Nahzat-i Azadi.93The

movement wasfounded in 1971 by three members of the Nahzat-i Azadi, closely
associated with Ayatullah Talaqani, Muhammad Hanif-Nizhad, Sacid Muhsin,
and All Asghar Badlczadagan, allthree of them men with university back
grounds. They were later joined bya number of others, including Ahmad Riza°i,
who wrote the first ideological text of the movement, Nahzat-i Husainl ("The
Movement of [Imam] Husain"). This book presented the goals of Islam almost
entirely in terms of a political struggle against capitalism and imperialism.
Together with theopening formula, "In theName of God and the Heroic People
of Iran", itprovided early evidence of the tilt to the left that propelled the main
body of the Mujahidin to an open espousal of Maoist-style Marxism. The change
in ideology came in May 1975, and wasaccompanied by the murder or betrayal
to the security police of members still insistent on adhering to Islam.94 Nonethe
less, benefiting from the support of Talaqani, an Islamically-oriented group of
Mujahdin continued to exist and beactive.95
In addition to theMujahidin, smaller andless well-known groups devoted to
armed struggle also came into being in the 1970s: the Guruh-i Inqilabi-yi Abu
Zarr ("TheAbu Zarr Revolutionary Group"), the Mahdaviyun ("Followers of
the Mahdi"), the Guruh-i Allahu Akbar ("The 'God is Greatest' Group"), and
several others. Less burdened with ideological baggage than the Mujahidin,
their remnants came together after thetriumph of the revolution in the Sazman-i
Mujahidin-i Inqilab-i Islam! ("The Organization ofMujahidin ofthe Islamic
Revolution"). By 1976,the guerilla organizations, both those ofIslamic and
those of Marxist inspiration, had effectively been crushed, and it was not until
the closing stages ofthe revolution that they re-emerged, mostly under new
leadership.
The immediate antecedents of the Islamic Revolution canbetraced to the events
of the summer andautumn of 1977, when letters of protest against the repressive
policies of the regime began to circulate openly, demanding freedom of expres
sion and the respect of legality. These were reformist rather than revolutionary
aims, and itwasin conjunction with the person of Ayatullah Khumaini that the
series ofevents constituting the revolution properly speaking began.
In late October, 1977,Hajj Sayyid Mustafa Khumaini, the eldest son of the
Imam, aman of great talent and aprincipal aide of his father, suddenly passed
away in Najaf. His death — like that of Sharfati earlier in the year — was widely

ascribed to the Shah's security police, and demonstrations condemning what
was held tobe murder were held inTehran and elsewhere. Afurther affront to
Ayatullah Khumaini and to public feeling came on 7 January 1978, whenthe
semi-official daily Ittilctat published ascurrilous attack on him, accusing him of
treachery and collusion with foreign enemies ofIran. The next day, a furious
mass protest took place in Qum; it was suppressed by the security forces with
heavy loss oflife. This clash was the first link ina chain ofpopular confronta
tions with the Shah's regime that, gathering momentum throughout 1978, soon
turned into a vast revolutionary movement, demanding the overthrow of the
Pahlavi regime and theinstallation of an Islamic government.
The demonstrations in Qum were followed bya more serious uprising in
Tabriz in February, the intention of which was to commemorate those who had
fallen in Qum. The killings that now took place in Tabriz provided the occasion
for demonstrations of mourning forty days later that were held in no fewer than
fifty-five cities and towns: the casualties were heaviest inYazd and Tehran. By
June, theShah found it politic to make conciliatory gestures in thehope of
slowing the gathering momentum of revolution, without shrinking atthe same
time from further bloodshed. In August, popular fury reached anew pitch when
400 people were immolated behind the locked doors ofa cinema inAbadan. A
point of no return was reached on September 9 when the Iranian army
slaughtered not fewer than 2,000 people at the Maidan-i Zhala in the south of
Tehran, an event that passed into the history of the revolution as Black Friday or
Bloody Friday.
Throughout, the proclamations of Ayatullah Khumaini urging steadfastness
in the face of the regime's brutality were reaching Iran in ever-increasing
quantity. The Shah therefore decided topress the government ofIraq toexpel
Khumaini from its territory, on themistaken assumption that once he was
removed from thesacred soil of Najaf, hisability to influence events in Iran
would be reduced. After a fruitless attempt to enter Kuwait, and a brief
consideration of Algeria and Syria aspossible places of refuge, on 6 October
1978, Khumaini flew unexpectedly to Paris. At the town of Neauphle-le
Chateau, heestablished a modest but highly efficient command centre forthe
revolution. From France, communications with Iran were infinitely easier than
they had been from Iraq. The Ayatullah received an endless flow of visitors from
Iran itself and from the Iranian exile diaspora, and soon his words and image
became a frequent feature of the world media.
Thus ironically, the expulsion of Ayatullah Khumaini from Iraq soon proved
beneficial to the revolution; it also exacerbated popular anger in Iran. Clashes

continued all across Iran throughout October; the oilworkers began acrippling
strike; and the first serious signs of strain and discontent within the armed forces
became apparent. On 6November the Shah formed a military government in
preparation forMuharram, due to begin on 2 December, a month rich in
emotive and historical associations, described by Khumaini as "the month of the
triumph of blood over the sword".96 As soon as Muharram began, demonstra
tors wrapped in shrouds unhesitatingly defied the government-imposed curfew.
On the ninth day of the month, as many as amillion people marched through
Tehran to Shahyad Square — a monument to monarchy that now ironically
became a focal point of the revolution and was renamed Maidan-i Azadi
(Freedom Square). The following day, some two million demonstrators, led by
Ayatullah Talaqani (who had been released from his final imprisonment on 30
October), again converged on thesquare, and approved by acclamation a
seventeen-point charter that called for the abolition ofthe monarchy and the
establishment of an Islamic government under the leadership of Imam
Khumaini.
Thereafter the removal ofthe Shah and the triumph ofthe Islamic Revol
ution was only a matter oftime. The expedient of the Bakhtiyar government,
installed shortly before the Shah fled Iran on 16 January 1979, never had any
chances ofsuccess; nor was there any real possibility ofmounting a military
coup, despite the fond hopes of key elements in the United States government.
Two weeks after the departure of the Shah, Imam Khumaini ended his fourteen
year exile and returned to a mass welcome in Tehran. On 5 February he
appointed the provisional government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, headed
by Mahdl Bazargan, and one week later, after a final burst of savagery, the
remnants of the old order finally collapsed. The Islamic Republic was born,in
what was arguably the most profound transformation since the first coming of
Islam to Iran.
In the revolution of 1978—9, two interrelated features were conspicuous: the vast
extent of popular participation in the movement, unparalleled in any other
revolutionary upheaveal ofthe 20th century; and its overwhelmingly Islamic
nature, interms of ideology, organization and leadership. Virtually every city
and town in Iran was mobilized against the Pahlavl regime as men and women
from almost all classes of Iranian society demonstrated their desire for an end to
the monarchical system and the foreign hegemony it was seen to represent.

Although drawn outfor a number of years, earlier instances of revoltand
protest, such as the Constitutional Revolution in the first decade of the 20th
century andthepost-war struggle for thenationalization of the oilindustry, had
been unable to elicit so broad and profound a popular response.
Those earlier movements hadbeen based on coalitions of Islamically-led and
inspired elements with secular andnationalist groups, mingled together in
varying proportions; the revolution of1978-9 was,by contrast, fully Islamicin
its substance. Theparticipation of non-religious elements wasstrictly marginal:
at nopoint did, for example, either theNational Front or theTuda Party playany
role of importance.97 Most of the armed insurrectionaries who fought the
Iranian army inthe final stage ofthe revolution on 10-11February 1979were
not, as issometimes claimed, drawn from the guerilla organizations ofthe left;
they were menbased on the mosques and revolutionary committees who, loyal
to Imam Khumaini, went on toform the nucleus ofthe Revolutionary Guards.
The slogans uttered during the mass demonstrations were predominantly
Islamic;98 the weapons ofthe revolutionaries were — until the very last stage
mass prayer andmartyrdom; anditwasdates of religious significance, especially
the month of Muharram, that marked the forward movement of the revolution.
Most importantly, it was the mosques that proviaed the basic organizational
unit of the revolution. In Tehran, particularly significant were the Masjid-i
Quba, presided over byDr Muhammad Mufattih (assassinated in December
1979), andthe Masjid-i Amir al-MuDminin, directed by Ayatullah Musavl
Ardabill (later chief justice ofthe Islamic Republic). The activities ofthese and
other mosques were co-ordinated by the Sazman-i Riihaniyat-i Mubariz (Orga
nization of Militant cUlama), agroup established late in 1976or early in 1977 at
the initiative of Ayatullah Bihishti. Based in Tehran, it had branches in key
provincial centres, and it played anindispensable role inassuring communica
tion and strategic co-ordination across thecountry.99
It has been suggested that the mosque was enabled to seize central stage in
this fashion bythe Shah's repression of secular political parties hostile to his
regime. However, mosques and religious personalities had bynomeans been
exempt from government hostility. Several culama were killed by the regimein
the 1970s, most notably Ayatullah Muhammad Riza Sacldl in May 1970 and
Ayatullah Husain Ghaffari in December 1974, anda large group of them,
including many who later became prominent in theIslamic Republic, were

subjected to repeated arrest and banishment to remote parts ofthe country.
More importantly, the secular forces - whether leftist orliberal-nationalist
completely lacked outstanding personalities able to gain the loyalty ofthe
masses or inspire in them active devotion to anideological goal; there was
nobody on the horizon remotely comparable to Imam Khumaini in his appeal.
Khumaini's towering figure was at all times integral to the course and
outcome of the revolution. Physically removed from his countrymen for
fourteen years, he nonetheless had an unfailing sense of the revolutionary
potential that had surfaced, and was able tomobilize the broad masses of the
Iranian people for the attainment ofwhat seemed tomany inside the country,
even as late as the autumn of1978, adistant and excessively ambitious goal. His
role pertained, moreover, not merely to moral inspiration and symbolic leader
ship; he wasalso the operational leader of the revolution. Although occasionally
receptive to suggestions on details of strategy from persons in Iran, he took all
key decisions himself, silencing early on all advocates of compromise with the
Shah with his magisterial insistence on the abolition of the monarchy and the
foundation of an Islamic government. Without this insistence, and without the
Imam's ability to sustain the loyalty and obedience of the Iranian masses, what
ended as a triumphant revolution might well have passed into Iranian history as
one more confrontation between governmental and oppositional forces, incon
clusive in its outcome.
Every revolution generates its own historiography and view of the past, andthe
Islamic Revolution of Iran has been no exception. Ithas become customaryin
Iran to regard the revolution as the culmination of almost acentury of ^lama
led struggles against the monarchy,100 and Khumaini himself made frequent
reference to those among theculama whom he implicitly regarded as his political
and spiritual forebears. Against this emphasis on continuity it may be argued
that quietism wasthe choice of many leading culama in the 20th century, and that
the demand for an Islamic republic was wholly unprecedented. However, the
question ofculama—state relations had remained acute throughout the period;
numerous movements and individuals had pursued political goals inseparable
from their vision ofIslam; and the unshaken loyalty ofthe Iranian masses to
Islam —to what Jalal Al-i Ahmad once called "the secret government of
religion"101 — had never been empty ofinsurrectionary potential. Thus it was
that at atime of acute cultural, social, political and economic discontent, Imam

CHAPTER 2 I
POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT, MEDIA AND
SOCIAL CHANGE IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY
IRAN
The 20th century haswitnessed a dramatic change in the kind and form of
entertainment inIran. This isparticularly true ofthe period since World WarII.
Some traditional entertainments have disappeared, others have undergone
radical transformation, some are dying. New foreign forms have appeared and
become popular. Thecrucial point, however, is that for the majority of the
population, especially those living in towns, their major entertainment is no
longer connected with theseasonal festivals such asthespring solstice andthe
autumn harvest, nor with religious holidays. Entertainment has become more a
leisure pastime unrelated to calendar determinants. These changes result from
rapid urbanization, increased means ofcommunication, and the overall shifts in
the socio-economic andpolitical structure.
Festivals from pre-Islamic times and connected with the seasons, like
Barnishastan-i Kusa (the ride ofthe beardless man), which used totake place on a
cold day at the beginning of spring, had already died outbythe opening of the
century,1 as hadMir-i Nauru^l (the Prince of the New Year). cUmarkushan, a
farce played out in town streets from the 16th century onwards, is now
forgotten.2 Khaima-yi Shab-ba^i,the puppet theatre, with glove-dolls and mario
1 Anjavi claims that the remnants ofthis festival are still to be found insome Iranian villages; see Jashn va A.daba va Mutaqidat-i Zamtsian i, pp. 78—85, 11, pp. 92—115. Anjavi's view is further supported and documented byMuhammad Mirshukra°i in his article "Kusagari" in Sahna Muasir published by Anjuman-i Tiatr-i Iran (Tehran, Isfand 1359). The observances mentioned by both authors should be considered as exceptions which prove the rule. More information about the entertainments ofpre-Islamic origin in 20th-century Iran are to be found in "The Secular Theatre in Iran" by Farrokh Gaffary.

It is carried in a procession by a multitude of people who then assault it and ultimately burn it. This effigy takes itsname from two villains in the early history of the Shicis, both named cUmar,
who were infamous for their treachery against the house of CA1I. (1)cUmar ibn al-Khattab, the
second caliph, who in the view of the Shfls prevented cAli from becoming caliph; in addition, the

nettes, is on the wane, although this tradition has been adapted and used by some
contemporary playwrights. Tamasha:acrobats and conjurers, snake charmers,
monkey tamers, andUttis who performed in thepublic squares and coffee
houses are only now rarely seen. Pardadariis story-chanting with the aid of a
huge illustrative painting on acanvas usually measuring 3 x 1J metres, and held
up between poles atboth ends. Thepardadar would point to various episodesas
he sang the progression of the story. The paintings could illustrate the tragedy of
Karbala or a tale from the national legends and could berolled upforeaseof
transportation. In recent years ithas become fashionable for private collectorsto
buy these paintings. Very few pardadars now survive.3
Naqqati (story telling) originated long before the Islamic period and played
an important role in disseminating literature, folktales, legends, and current
information. This isalso a one-man show encompassing pantomimic gestures
and vocal modulations which move the audience to tears and laughter. In the last
decade naqqah have found fewer and fewer candidates to train as apprentices.
They are being replaced by more sophisticated amusements which have come
to pervade the cities and towns. Traditional forms such as Td^iya andRiihau^J
have not died out, but have moved from their natural urban surroundings to the
rural areas where they still persist in a modified, less glamorous form.
Qahvakhana, the coffee house, has played a very important role in the
development ofentertainment, either as aplace for Naqqali, the improvisatory
comedic theatre Ruhauzi, or for feasts following Ramazan fasting days. As
Qahvakhana are usually located along travelled routes and onthe outskirtsof
towns and villages where these functions came into play, they are now generally

treatment of the effigy ofcUmar is similar to that of the effigy of Guy Fawkes, who is ritually incinerated in Britain every year on November 5 th. During the 1978—9 revolution, the effigy of
cUmar was replaced by those of President Carter and/or thelate Shah. See Chelkowski, "Iran:
Mourning Becomes Revolution." Sometimes cUmarkushan is performed as a skit for a small audience. According toGaffary, it could also take a satirico-erotic form, and isperformed secretly even today, by and for the women in Azarbaljan; see "The Secular Theatre in Iran". See also Chapter
19, p. 724 for the religious significance ofthecumarkushan. 3 Originally when such paintings were made, not only on canvas but on glass, they were called ShamayilGardanl(The Exhibition ofHoly Pictures). Their origins may go back tothe 16th century. In the 20th century, the technique ofpainting holy Shfl personalities ornational heroes onglass, known as Pusht-i shhha isstill done on a limited scale. Now the glass pictures are hung on wallsor placed on aneasel, instead of being carried about. 4 Qahvakhanahas been an obsolete term for along time, as qahva (coffee) is almost never servedin these places. Tea has supplanted it. Tea has been cultivated on acommercial scale in Gilan since the second half ofthe 19th century, therefore chaikhana (tea-house) has taken the place of qahvakhana. Until the late 1960s and early 1970s, the qahvakhana served as anatelier forthe Parda painters who

ENTERTAINMENT, MEDIA AND SOCIAL CHANGE
The new kinds of entertainment which have done much to change Iranian
manners are films and, to a lesser extent, the theatre, while radio and television
function countrywide; the offspring of the Naqqali is the transistor radio.
In the larger cities, especially Tehran, night clubs and cabarets have sprung
up for the well-to-do. Popular singers, live, or on radio and television and
records andcassettes, have become young people's favourites.5 Singers with
amplified voices also provide entertainment at urban weddings. One huge
cabaret inTehran called Shikufa(-yi) Nau not only showed traditional dances and
the songs ofvarious parts ofthe country butfeatured modern cabaret troupes
from all over theworld. As in traditional Iranian entertainment all classes of
society happily mingled in the audience.6
The Daura are small groups of friends meeting in each others' houses
sequentially, not only toeat, talk politics and business, but also toplay cards and
backgammon andlisten to music andpoetry recitations. Daura activities are
particularly common in provincial towns.
The Zurkhana (the traditional gymnasium ofpre-Islamic origin) which later
became interwoven with Shica rituals and beliefs, in recent years unfortunately
became a mere showcase for foreign tourists in themain cities.
Though the Zurkhana group-displays and individual competitions provided
a breath-taking and visually pleasing spectacle, the main purpose of the
Zurkhana was as a service to the community, and for individual character
building. As A. Reza Arasteh aptly puts it:
Through regular participation the member (of the zurkhana) acquired approved character traits, his religious ties and social values were strengthened, and he saw his purposein community life more clearly . . .On abroader basis, the zurkhana fostered acommon aim and feeling of unity among its members. It penetrated social class boundaries and brought together individuals from different backgrounds and professions . . . Inspite of their varied backgrounds, the zurkhana members disregarded social status in order to
received food, lodging and small monetary remuneration for their artistic creations. These paintings in turn would adorn the walls ofthe qahvakhana orwere used by the pardadar%. This kind of painting was dubbed "coffee-house painting" inthe 1960s — the qahvakhana still serve as aplace of exchanging information andgossip. A television or a radio set then often replaced thelive entertainer. The artist and producers of traditional entertainment now usetheqahvakhanaas their booking offices. 5 It is worth noting that some ofthe famous singers received their vocal training as apprentices to the traditional Rauza-khwan. 6 Shikufa-ji Nau was famous inthe 1960s and 1970s. Inthe late 195 os Bihisht-i Tihran was the place where the famous singer Mahvash used to appear. Mahvash could serve as a prototype for the popular female singers who also became heroines ofpopular adulation by all classes ofsociety in the 1960s and 1970s. Another cabaret of repute was Ufuq-i talcfl which hadfloor shows produced on three stages.

serve the community more effectively. Intime ofemergency they defended their own mahala against outsiders. Moreover, theathletes actively participated in national and
local festivals and inreligious ceremonies, especially during Muharram and Ramazan.7
Traditional sports, which were connected with the Zurkhana, like wrestling
and weightlifting, have now been adapted to contemporary world normsand
standards, and geared into international competitions, many Iranians winning
international recognition and Olympic medals inthem. InTehran thousandsof
people attend soccer matches. This sport is popular nationwide, even at the
village level. Audience participation is highly emotional, whether during live
action or when matches arewatched on television or heard on radio.8
When at thebeginning of the century themajority of the (predominantly
illiterate) Iranian population was scattered in villages throughout the country,
they had limited means of communication with the urban centres. There were
neither roads nor telephones, nor means of transport other than quadrupeds. On
the other hand, religious institutions such as amosque, amadrasa, aHusainijya, a
Fatimiyja, orakhaniqah provided centres of local social and political information
in addition to their religious functions, moulding the ideas and perceptions of
the people.
A change occurred inthe 20th century when the press began tohave a great
impact on thepeople, mainly in theurban centres. Even in small townsand
villages acopy of a newspaper would be read aloud togroups, although it might
have been considerably outof date. Since World War II,radio started to gain
wider distribution. In the last twenty years there has been a dramatic change in
the means of communication: new roads, automobiles, rail andair transport,
telephone and telegraph, and finally radio and television have spread overthe
whole country. To the major media, controlled by the government, were added
cassettes, tapes, and photocopies, which were free of government regulation.
Modern media and entertainment have created a major change inthe whole
life-pattern ofsociety. However, traditional means ofcommunication have not
been entirely eliminated, aswas demonstrated bythe 1978—9 revolution, when

8 In the 1960s and 1970s Iran hosted many international sports events, and many sport facilities were built during these two decades. Especially, the huge sports complex on the outskirts ofTehran, on the way toKaraj, must be mentioned. These sports facilities were built for the observances ofthe 2,500th anniversary of the Persian Empire in 1971. Sportsmen were used by thegovernment for mass youth displays on national holidays and during theinternational events which took place in Iran. Coaches from East European countries were imported to train theyoung athletes for these mass demonstrations.

mass mobilization was activated by acrossing of modern with traditional means
of communication and ritual. William O. Beeman sums itup aptly in connection
with traditional performances:
Iranian traditional performance forms have been able tosurvive and retain adegree of vitality because they are important to the lives of the people who support them; not just as a kind of residual "escape valve'', but as part of the complex of cultural institutions which provide the meaningful symbolic material helping the public deal with the realitiesof their own situations in the idealized past, the harshly real present, and the uncertain, variable future.9
In recent years playwrights have been most active, and more plays have been
written than there were theatres toshow them. Audiences were also still lacking
and unprepared fordrama.10 The future fordramatic production lies rather in
radio and television, which are not only government-controlled means of
communication, but are also now the chief forms of entertainment. The Islamic
Revolution of1978—9 brought about major political, social, cultural, and artistic
changes, as well as alterations inthe recent life-style of the Iranians, particularly
in the urban centres. These changes have naturally had agreat impact on popular
entertainment and themedia.
It isimpossible to predict the future. However, emphasis may beplaced on
the fact that the revolution reversed "progressive" trends: theyear 1979 was
unusually rich and creative, but now many places ofentertainment have been
eliminated or closed. The new and stringent forms of religious, political, and
moral censorship have ledIranians back to their own homes, where banned
music ortapes of various kinds, card-playing orother disallowed activities may
take place privately among family members or close friends. On the other hand,
the street provides the spectacle and the excitement of countless pro-and
counter-revolutionary marches and rallies, to arouse cathartic sentiments
among a multitude of spectators, participants and passersby, forwhom many
other kinds of entertainment have been curtailed.
The following isa description offour major forms ofentertainment in 20th
century Iran. Two are traditional, Tacziya and Ruhauzi. Two are western
imports, the drama and the film. It isdifficult tospeculate onwhat will become
of the traditional modalities. After a period of decline, there were attempts
recently to preserve theindigenous forms. The above-mentioned traditional
forms have had agreat impact on the imported modalities, although much more
than has been could be derived from them.
9 Beeman, "A Full Arena", p. 286. 10 Although audiences were still largely unprepared fordramatic productions inmodern form, the thirst for theatrical stimulation was felt among the people.

MUHARRAM OBSERVANCES; RAUZA-KHWANi; DAST A - G A RD ANI;
TACZIYA-KHWANI
The tragedy of the murder of Husain, his sons and his followers, on the plain of
Karbala in A.D. 680 became the prototype for the only indigenous dramatic form
in the world of Islam. During the month of Muharram, Husain, the third Imam
of the Shlcis and the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, was on his way to the
Kufa community, whose leader hewas to become. He was ambushed in the
desert bythe troops of the Umayyad Sunni Caliph, Yazld. After refusing to
surrender his claim tothe Shici legitimacy, and according to tradition, after a
siege often days on the blazing sands of Karbala without water for his family and
followers, abattle ended on the day of Asmara inthe massacre ofall the ShIcI
men. The women and children were taken captive and brought to Damascus
together with Husain's head, which was displayed to the Caliph.
For several hundred years there were pilgrimages to Husain's tomb in
Karbala, followed in the 10thcentury by parades during the month of
Muharram stimulated by the Persian ShIcI Biiyid dynasty.11 These reproduced
the bloody scenes ofthe death ofthe martyrs for the benefit ofmourning and
loudly lamenting crowds. When inthe 16th century Shicism became the state
religion of Iran under the Safavid kings, these parades became elaborate: the
martyrs were represented by men bleeding and with missing limbs, mounted on
caparisoned horses or camels. Funerary music accompanied floats graphically
representing the scenes ofKarbala, while the bystanders beat their breasts and
moaned " OHusain, King of the martyrs".
The processions are known as dasta.Until the present time they constitute the
major Muharram observances. Groups of men and boys rhythmically beat their
heads and breasts with their palms or else with swords, knives, orstones. Back
beating with chains isstill common. These blood-letting activities are often
interspersed with mournful chants initiated by aleader. Others carry elaborate

standards, called calams, which are symbolic of Husain's army, so that the
standard-bearers and participants of the parade become the equivalent of
Husain's troops, ready for self-sacrifice.
The dramatic modality ofthe Husain passion is based upon the movement
and theatricality ofthe annual parades and also upon the dramatic accounts of
the tragedy written by Husain Vaciz KashifT in the early years of the 16th
century, under the title Rau^ac al-Shuhada ("The Garden of the Martyrs"). In
early days the public recitation from that book gave birth to Raui^a-khwanl}1but
soon this modality began to serve as aframework for professional narrators who
improvised creatively upon thesuffering anddeeds of many Shici martyrs.
Rauza-khwani, popularly called rau^a, is participated in by all classes of
society and takes place in special black tents erected in the public squares of a
town oravillage. Performances also take place inmosques, orinthe courtyards
of private houses, as well as inspecial buildings known as Husainiyya orTakya.
These places are usually well carpeted anddecorated with black mourning
standards and flags as well as with avariety of weapons reminiscent ofthe battle
at Karbala. In private houses refreshments areprovided by thehosts for the
rauza participants.
There could be awhole range ofRauza-khwani for the general public, either
elaborately grandiose, or ona small scale in private forhousewives. The main
activities of Rauza-khwani take place in the month of Muharram and the
following month ofSafar, but the performances may take place atany time of the
year, especially on Thursday evenings. There may bea rotary arrangement in
which Rauza occurs in thesame household on a periodic basis, or a group of
guild members or neighbours maysponsor performances in their various
households.
Rauza usually begins with the singing of panegyric to the Prophet andthe
saints by a man called Maddah(encomiast). It isa combination ofrecitation and
singing in slow cadences. This paves the way for aRauza-khwani (also knownas
Vaciz) who is a well-trained preacher who alternates storytelling with songs
about Husain and the attendant martyrs. Through the choice of episodes and the
modulation ofhis voice, he isable toexcite and manipulate the emotions ofthe
audience and to arouse among the participants a unity of feelings of great
intensity, sothat they identify with the sufferings ofthe martyrs, who, in turn,
will serve as intercessors for the participants on the day ofthe Last Judgement.
12 The recitation and chanting of eulogies for theShIcT martyrs goes back at least to the ioth century A.D.; mourning literature, known as maqtal, was mainly written inArabic. Kau^at al-Shuhada is a maqtal in Persian.

Rapid chanting in ahigh-pitched voice is interrupted by sobbing and crying.
Towards the end ofthe performance, when the audience has been aroused to
intense emotion, weeping, breast-beating and flagellation may occur. The
Rauza-khwani ends with congregational singing of dirges called nauha. The
performances may last for several hours tothe end ofthe day and well into the
night, with alternating characters. TheRauza-khwan may be considered a
preserver ofclassical Persian musical forms, singing them alternately with his
recitations.
Muharram mourning observances, like Rauza-khwani and Dasta-gardani,
are regarded asmanifestations of devotion and piety, but they should not be
excluded from thecategory of entertainment. After many interviews during
1963—6 with informants across the country, itbecame evident to this writer that
people, particularly in small towns and villages, long for the month of
Muharram and for the time when they might participate in these rituals. Rauza
khwani recitations also became amedium for the exposition of current local and
governmental problems for the benefit of the audience.
Around the middle of the 18th century the fusion of the movement13 and the
costumes ofthe parades with the text of The Garden oj the Martyrs produced the
Tac%iya plays which, some hundred years later, in 1879, w e r e described by Sir
Lewis Pelly inthe following words: "If the success ofdrama istobe measured
by the effects which it produces upon the people forwhom it is composed, or
upon the audience before whom it ispresented, no play has ever surpassed the
tragedy known in the Muslim world as that of Hasan and Husain."14
During the presentation of the Tacziya passion plays, the identification of the
people with the performance is such that present time and place merge imper
ceptibly with the past, while the martyrdom ofHusain leads to breast-beating
and tears in anidentification with the suffering of the martyrs centuries ago.
In the second half of the 19th century, Tacziya not only received support from
the royal court of Nasir al-DIn Shah but became the centrepiece of entertainment
and devotion across the nation. The aristocracy and well-to-do in the towns
competed for the best actors and tried to outshine each other in the splendour of
their production and the decoration ofthe areas where the performances were
held. This is also the period when many special edifices were built, known as
Takya or Husainiyya. The grandeur of those buildings, the forceful production
of the plays, and above all the active participation ofthe spectators inthe plays
themselves, produced an immense impact on the westerners who either wit

nessed orread about this theatrical activity. Suffice ittomention that the Comte
Joseph-Arthur de Gobineau, in 1865, Samuel G.W. Benjamin, in 1887, and
Matthew Arnold, in 1871, allwrote moving accounts of the Tacziya pageants
and staging.15
The plays were at that time not confined to the mourning months of
Muharram and Safar, butwere performed allthe year round. The number of
plays notdirectly related to themartyrdom of Husain and hisfollowers was
greatly increased. Dramas about various local saints took the lead in expanding
the Tacziya repertory. These, however, were linked tothe Karbala tragedy bya
device which isknown 2.sgurl^ (digression). Other stories were taken from the
Qur3an and national legends, buteven profane stories could be incorporated
into theTacziya framework. By this device, thesagas of non-religious heroes
were reduced to shallow and unimportant events vis-a-vis the supreme Karbala
martyrdom. Moreover, audience participants were enabled in their private gurlz
to compare their ownpersonal suffering with the supreme martyrdom of
Husain.
Basically, the Tacziya performance is "theatre in the round". The action takes
place on acentral stage and expands onto atrack surrounding it, usually utilized
for duels andbattles. Further expansion of the acting space canbe made on
auxiliary stages on the periphery tothe audience, and even beyond the audience.
This principle applies tothe open air performances ortothose inaTakya under
an awning.16
The actors are divided into good and bad characters. The protagonists sing
their parts and are dressed mainly in green, whereas the villains wear redand
recite their lines. Inthe 19th century, thanks toroyal and upper-class patronage,
the costumes, although symbolic, were highly elaborate. Twentieth-century
troupes could not afford such finery. Thevillagers make do with whatever
wearing apparel is available. Women arealways played by veiled men.
It has been atradition that there are no stage props other than symbolic ones,
such as a bucket of water standing for theRiver Euphrates.
Pivotal to the Tacziya drama is the proximity of the audience, enablingthe
participatory reliving ofthe Husain legend. The genius ofTacziya drama isthat
it combines immediacy and flexibility with universality. Uniting rural folk art
with urban and royal entertainment, itadmits no barriers between the archetype

and the every-day man, the wealthy and the poor, thesophisticated andthe
simple, thespectator and theactor. Each participates with and enrichesthe
other.
At the end of the 19th century, Tacziya was on the verge of giving birth to an
Iranian secular theatre but, due to the turbulent history of the Constitutional
Revolution atthe beginning of the 20th century and the fundamental social and
political changes in the big towns of Iran, Tacziya lost royal and upper-class
patronage. Although it managed to stay in urban areas, it was slowly on the
move into the countryside. Losing glitter and pomp, itoften became a commer
cial enterprise with acting troupes competing forthe most lucrative places in
which to perform.
The retreat to the provinces had a constructive effect onTacziya in that it
enabled participation of the villagers in the preparations for thedrama, and
sometimes in the acting of it. The function and the essence of the play itself came
to have greater significance forthe audience.
In away, the Iranian village tradition, with its simpler more popular religion,
purified and preserved Tacziya by slowly stripping away the elaborate pageantry
and investing it with anunvitiated intimate interaction between the audience
and the actors, based on their common humanity. This simplified form, in turn,
also reacted upon the urban acting troupes.
There are two main categories of Tacziya performances: those produced and
performed by professional actors who largely depend upon acting fora liveli
hood, and non-professional Muharram village performers usually organized by
a former regular actor. This second type often confine their activities to the day
of cAshura, performing anact ofcommunal piety without great artistic value,
thus providing a kind ofarchetypical framework into which the spectators can
pour their own sufferings and hopes. It arouses their deepest emotionsand
permits them toexpress them publicly. Such performances seem rather crude,
particularly to the outsider. They are responsible in part for the criticism Tacziya
has received from the progressive elements of society during the last fifty
years.17 The opposition of the culama to Tacziya stems from the theological
principle against human representation in art, and from the competition with
Rauza-khwani, which had customarily been organized by the clergy and from
which they derived an income.
With the coming topower ofthe Pahlavi dynasty, Muharram observances,
and especially Tacziya, were forbidden. Tacziya was thought tobe a backward

religious entity which Riza Shah considered an obstacle to modernization.
While Muhammad Riza Shah Pahlavi officially disapproved of Tacziya, it was
nevertheless permitted to take place in the rural areas, the small towns, and even
in the suburbs ofthe cities. Inthe country, performances were atthe discretion
of the local authorities. However, officials, orthe gendarmerie, were sometimes
bribed for permission, or were so sympathetic to Tacziya that they provided
soldiers to play drums andtrumpets or to participate in cavalry charges.
In the mid 1960s, tiring of modernization, the intelligentsia had a nostalgic
longing for Tacziya, which they no longer regarded as areligious ritual, but asa
very important social and cultural tradition. In 1966 Tacziya was shown on a
modern stage and on television for the first time. Then in the Shiraz Arts
Festival there was a Tacziya performance in 1967.18 In 1976 an International
Symposium on Tacziya was organized by the Shiraz Arts Festival. Inaddition to
scholarly deliberations, seven Tacziya plays were performed at Husainiyya
Mushir in Shiraz and in a nearby small village, Kaftarak, where thousands of
people from near and far attended the plays. Millions also watched on television.
The Empress Farah attended one ofthe Shiraz performances. Additionally, asa
result ofthe Symposium, the Institute forTraditional Performance and Ritual
was established in Tehran in August 1976.19 In 1977 several Tacziya perfor
mances which didnot belong to theMuharram tradition were staged at the
Festival of Popular Traditions in Isfahan.
Tacziya acting is, in most cases, a familial tradition and occupation. As
children the actors play child roles, as teenagers they may become the performers
of the leading roles such as CA1I Akbar or Qasim. Those who play the antagonists
undergo similar training, but need not be able to sing. Actors do not earn
enough in this fashion and must have other occupations as well. Despite the
recent interest of the intelligentsia, young people now do not wish to continue in
this tradition but prefer more modern occupations. This mayoccasion the
extinction ofthe Tacziya actors. Though recently most ofthe Tacziya activities
were village oriented, themajority of the actor-producers live in towns. The
months ofMuharram and Safar are still the most often chosen for Tacziya plays,
but seasonal agricultural activities, such as rice planting or harvesting take
precedence over fixed dates. Tacziya plays are still preferred to cinema or
television in areas of dense population, like Gilan and Mazandaran.
18 Parviz Sayyad organized the "Iranian Collection" {Majmtta-yi Irani) of traditional entertainment and staged it at Tiatr-i 25 Shahrivar in Tehran. Parviz Sayyad organized, produced and directed three Ta^iya plays atthe Shiraz Festivals. The most interesting was Ta\iya Hurr. Later, the critical edition ofthis Ta\iya was published inTehran by Festival ofArt Series, Tehran 13 50/1971. 19 Proceedings ofthe Conference are published inChelkowski, Tac%zya: Ritual andDrama in Iran.

ENTERTAINMENT, MEDIA AND SOCIAL CHANGE
The fascination with Tacziya among westerners was revived in thelate 1960s
and early 1970s when leading theatrical pundits like Peter Brook and J.
Grotowski rediscovered Tacziya during their quest for Asiatic theatrical
modalities. Peter Brook, inhisinterview with theParabola Quarterly devoted to
ritual and drama, said: "I sawin a remote Iranian village oneofthe strongest
things I have ever seen intheatre: agroup of four hundred villagers, the entire
population ofthe place, sitting under atree and passing from roars oflaughter to
outright sobbing — although they knew perfectly well theendofthe story — as
they sawHussain indanger ofbeing killed, and then fooling hisenemies,and
then being martyred. And when hewasmartyred the theater form became a
truth - there was nodifference between past and present. Anevent that was told
as a remembered happening in history, thirteen hundred years ago, actually
became a reality at that moment. Nobody could draw theline between the
different orders of reality. It wasanincarnation: at that particular moment he
was being martyred again in front of those villagers."20
The paradigm ofHusain isdeeply rooted inall the strata ofPersian society. In
the recent revolution inIran these rituals were converted into mass mobilization
and the symbols ofthe paradigm were utilized as the signposts for the Islamic
revolution. The Rauza-khwani served asthemain traditional medium to arouse
revolutionary fervour by comparing therulers ofIran with Yazld's henchmen.
The demonstrations of1978 inthe towns ofIran, in which millions participated,
were patterned after the Muharram parades. Theforty-day cycle of mourning
observances, known as Arbacln, were utilized as mourning demonstrationsfor
the fallen heroes of the revolution. White shrouds like those worn by the
Muharram marchers were used bythe vanguard ofthe revolutionaries asa sign
of their readiness forsacrifice and death. Even the symbolic colours ofgreen and
red, standing for good and evil, were used ontheballot cards inthe revolution
ary referendum, green standing forthe Islamic republic.21

modality hascertain similarities with comic improvisatory theatre in Western

Asia, the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, and even with the Commedia dell'Artein
Italy. One ofthe reasons forthe lack ofdata about itshistorical development is
precisely the fact that it isimprovised. Therefore, we do not possess any written
text totrace it backwards inhistory. One can look forroots ofthis theatre in the
jesters ofmany princely and royal courts scattered round the country before and
during theIslamic period. Persian miniature paintings provide us with a rich
body ofvisual documents depicting acrobats, buffoons and musicians together
with their acts, costumes, props, andmusical instruments.
The corpus of classical Persian literature attests to thefact that the courtly
clowns could saythe unspeakable and dared tocriticize even the most influential
court andgovernment officials. From thetime of Shah cAbbas onwards, the
principle clowns would join hands with court musicians toproduce short comic
and satirical skits in pantomime about social mores, against a musical back
ground.23 This led tothe development ofa theatrical modality known asTaqlld,
literally, "imitation". This comic form later became popular in the coffee
houses. Inthe 19thcentury, and especially during the reign ofNasir al-Din Shah
the comic theatrical productions ofthe royal court ofTehran became a regular
event. Nasir al-Din Shah's favourite clown, Karlm Shlri3! and his troupe,24
greatly helped to shape and to popularize this comic theatre, which was
commonly known as RuhauzT, andwhich spread into private courtyards in
urban settings.25 Its apogee falls into the second half ofthe 19th century andthe
first half ofthe 20th. The basis of this theatre "in the round" isimprovisation on
an outline plot ofwhich the proponents are stock characters. The costumes and
makeup of the stock characters and their movements are simple yet exaggerated,
and are easily recognizable by the audience since they reflect the people's
impression of the stage parts. These are thearchetypes reflecting allclasses of
Iranian society. This improvisatory theatre has undergone some cosmetic
changes in appearance in the course of its development andlocality, and is,

performance on the pool. The traditional urban Iranian dwelling is ahouse built
around acourtyard in the middle of which is awater tank {haui(}. Its raised edges
lend themselves as supports for planks laid across them. In this fashion astageis
erected and the surrounding area becomes the auditorium. Ahauz also used to
be situated in the centre of the coffee-houses. In the first half of the 19th century,
Tacziya was likewise sometimes performed "on the pool". Though todaythe
pool isalmost never used for this purpose the name Ruhauzi persists, not as an
exclusive, but as the most common term by which this improvisatory theatreis
known. Today the acting takes place "in the round" onthe ground, which is
covered with carpets and mats, either in private houses or courtyards and on
village commons. Children occupy the proximal circle and important people
may be seated on chairs. The action can be extended or contracted in accordance
with the requirements of the moment, so that interruptions and resumptions are
quite possible. This worries neither the actors nor the audience, as improvisa
tion applies notonly to words and deeds but also to time and place.
M. Haeri describes the mechanism of improvisation in the following way:
"The interrelationships of Ruhauzi actors are imperative in their improvisa
tions. Their perceptions of one another are so acute that their actions seem to be
dictated by one individual. The success of every actor is wholly dependent upon
his becoming one inthought with his fellow actors."27 Therefore one may say
that teamwork isthe secret ofRuhauzi success. The more intimate two actors
are, the more elaborate their improvisations become. Tobe a good actor in
Ruhauzi, one not only has tobe able toact and interact, but also tobe intuitive
and witty enough toimprovise new variations on the spur of the moment. The
second most important aspect of Ruhauzi is its relationship tothe audience: the
wit and artistic abilities of the actors are released by the spontaneous reactions of
the audience, which in turn leads to verbal and physical participation. This is an
outstanding characteristic of Persian audiences.
One can see certain similarities between Ruhauzi and Tacziya asfaras the
chemistry of the performers and spectators isconcerned. The main difference is
that the purpose ofRuhauzi istocreate laughter by all possible means, whereas
Tacziya provokes tears.
The plots of these plays arebased upon everyday life, on fairy-talesand
legends, and on stories based on national and religious epics. Although the
purpose ismainly humorous, Ruhauzi isa perfect vehicle for satirizing Iranian

society. Even performances based on legends and religious stories can be
exploited to satirize contemporary conditions.28
Since the text is not written down, the players are at liberty to mock with
impunity local officials, society, social taboos, even the government and reli
gious preachers and authorities. They are, in this fashion, immune to censorship.
In recent years, since tape recording has become ubiquitous, acertain degree of
caution has become necessary.
The main characters of the Ruhauzl plays are: Hajji - a typical bazaar
merchant, money-greedy, who uses religion as a shield forhis doings. He may
have several wives who do notknow of the other's existence. This leads to
trouble when they discover each other.
Siyah isa servant known for his black facial make-up (in some provinceshe
has a white make-up). He is the dominant character who speaks with an
uneducated accent and confuses messages heis to deliver, creating a chain of
misunderstandings which arethoroughly risible. Heis thecentral character
dispensing humour. He distorts not only linguistic and social patterns but also
moves in an unco-ordinated fashion. His actions appear to be bad, but in the last
analysis lead togood ends. His contorted actions and words make itpossibleto
refer to sexual taboos andgestures, or governmental or political iniquities,
provoking good natured cascades oflaughter. He also brings characters from
classical literature into theevery day life of the Ruhauzi repertory.
Zan-i Hajji — the main wife ofHajji, atypical middle class scold, pretentious
and dissatisfied about money. She mistreats servants and badgers her husband.

28 Stories from classical Persian literature entered theRuhauzl repertoire, such as Rustam and Isfandiyar; BTzhan andManizha; Yusuf and Zulaikha; Khusrau andShirin; Farhad and Shirin; stories which glorify such rulers asTlmur and Nadir Shah. The popular fairy tales contributed to such plots as Chahar Sanduq or Hulard-i Hind. Western influence could also be detected inRuhauzl by integrating parts of translations of western plays. The typical example of this could be Moliere's Medecin Malgre Lui. However the most commonly performed plays are those based on everyday life such as Hajji Masjadldu %ana\ Naslb vaQismat; 'Arusi-yi Haiti; Siyah-i Rastgu; Tablb-i Ijbarl; Damad-i Firarl; Hajji Ba^arl va Zanish; Mushtl va Nlm Mushtl; Tablb-i Kashl.

pitiful man who either pretends tobe superior to his peers or else is confused
about hisplace in society. He is the butt of Siyah. Sometimes this man represents
a European with absurd and laughter-provoking manners.
There are additional characters for all walks of life.
In the 20th century some ofthe Ruhauzi troupes moved into the newly
established theatres. The placing of Ruhauzi in the big city theatres, as in
Tehran, was not an easy task; changing from the theatre "in the round" to the
proscenium setting somewhat altered the rapport between actors and audience.
As Beeman says: " the traditional performing troups outside of the main urban
centers ofthe country had anauthenticity intheir performance that existing
urban troups lacked, particularly those who performed onthe proscenium
stage".29
Female roles had previously been played by men. Inthe theatres, women
came on stage to thehorror of the clerics. Interference by the religious
authorities took place to the point of setting fire to theatres. Today the use of
women in performances is also common in the country-side. W. Beeman's field
research in the years 1976—77 hasfurnished enough examples to prove the point:
"we located four principle troups in Nishapur. All contained excellent perform
ers. Two of the troups used artistesin women's roles, and two used men dressed
as women — %an-push?° The use of actual women in performances was an
important variable throughout the country. In some areas residents preferred to
have women asperformers, in other areas, it was not thought proper. For
Khurasan, the division was about half and half."31 Itis since the end of World
War II that, under the pressure of modern competitors, Ruhauzi has been onthe
move from its natural urban ambiance tothe rural areas. Those few Ruhauzi
companies which stayed behind are based in town theatres adapting many
modes ofthe day totheir repertory.32
Today Ruhauzi has mainly provided entertainment for wedding and circum
cision celebrations. These chiefly take place before the month of mourning,
Muharram, and the month of fasting, Ramazan. The troupe provides theatrical
performances, music, occasional shows ofjesters, acrobats and jugglers, thus

integrating the different parts ofthe whole affair.33 In recent years a wedding is
usually a one-day happening in thetowns. It is in thevillages, andespecially
among the tribes, that it cango on for many days. This provides an opportunity
to a Ruhauzl troupe to exhaust its repertory, which according to Beeman, can
consist ofas many as seventy toeighty plot-plays.34 Thepressure ofthe modern
competitors, however, isnot limited today tothe urban environment. It can be
felt even inthe most remote corners ofIran. Thefindings ofthe field researchin
the eastern and southern provinces of the country, carried out byateam from the
Tehran Institute forTraditional Performance and Ritual in 1976—77, stress this.
"It wasclear atthis point that traditional improvisatory theatre inIran wasalive
and still possessing agreat deal ofattraction forpeople inrural areas. We began
to see signs oferosion inthe tradition, however. Some troupes had broken up.
Others had reduced their numbers to the point where they could only present
musical performances and nottheatre. The principle reason for the erosion of
the traditional theatre seemed tobe the incursion of the urbanized wedding with
its emphasis on popular music, formal dress and polite reserved behavior. As
this type ofcelebration gained inpopularity, people were beginning tofeel that
Ruhauzi theatre was not modern enough for their celebration."35
Nevertheless, according to Beeman, "there may beasmany as 250 troupes
regularly presenting improvisatory plays throughout thecountry today".36
As inTacziya, actors are recruited mainly from thelower strata ofsociety and
carry on a family profession. Also like Tacziya actors, they need additional
sources ofincome andplay only those roles for which they arephysically suited,
progressing according to their ageandability. Actors are role-bearers (dast
pusti), so that amanplaying Siyah iscalled Siyah-push (TheMandressed inBlack)
but remains hisown private person andtherefore bears no responsibility for
what hesays ordoes onstage. As in Tacziya there are minimal stage properties,
some ofwhich may besymbolic, aswhen a pillow represents a bed. Moving to
another place is indicated by walking about or by stating the locality of the
moment.
33 It is an old tradition that troupes which present plays are also musical troupes. They provide music for the play's background and music and dance for general entertainment. In the past the musicians were known as Mutrib and Lutl. Today they do not like these terms and like to be called
Nava^anda, Hunarmandor Mu^lsjan. The principal instruments used are tar, kamanchaand %arb. In most cases, the head of the musicians is the head of the entire troupe. 34 William O. Beeman, "Traditional Improvisatory Theatre-Iran", p. 54. M.Haery believes that this is an exaggerated number. Usually a troupe is known for several plays and in addition can perform a few others. 35 Beeman, "Through Iran in Search of Ru-hozi". 36 William O.

Whereas inthe old days the coffee houses served asplayhouses, today they
have become booking offices for Ruhauzi troupes. In 1977, under the auspices
of the Institute for Traditional Performances andRitual, the International
Conference on Ruhauzi took place atthe Shiraz Festival of Arts. Troupes from
Khurasan, Fars and Kirman performed there, to thedelight of the ordinary
people and the cognoscenti. Hundreds attended nightly.
As early as 1922 Hasan Muqaddam wrote aplay called "Jacfar Khan isBack
from Europe" reminiscent of Fukuli, the dandy in the Ruhauzi plays.37 Here the
roles were scripted. In Tehran in the 1960s All Naslriyan produced aplay called
Siyah, based on the black servant of Ruhauzi. His second scripted "Ruhauzi
play", called Bungah-i Tiatral, wasstaged in the 1970s. Oneof the most
interesting comedies fashioned after Ruhauzi was written by Bizhan Mufid and
called ]an Nisar. This play was first performed in Tehran in 1973, andwas
directed by the playwright himself to the acclaim ofaudiences and critics. This
play is the best proof that the traditional forms can be successfully adapted to the
modern artistic modalities.
In conclusion is should benoted that, from the time of the jesters to the
Ruhauzi characters, humour and laughter have generally been the only outlet for
grievances against the harsh and autocratic governments, rulers and fathers. No
other defence was available or exempt from punishment. Rigid social codes and
mores were also softened bythe antics of Siyah and the other comedians.38
DRAMA
Goethe, though agreat admirer of Persian literature, noted apeculiar absence of
drama in Persian poetry: "Had adramatic poet made his appearance, the whole
literature would have assumed a different appearance."39 Goethe's view, how
ever, was through the prism of Western dramaturgy: he was looking for the art
of producing and writing plays. This form ofdramatic artdid not yet exist in
Iran.
The Persians, however, hadanother form of drama - an extraordinary
performing modality known as Naqqali. Naqqali is an ancient art of storytelling
which originated in simple minstrel shows and bySafavid times had evolved

DRAMA
into a complex form of entertainment. Naqqall storytelling was not performed
in theatres, but in coffee houses. The story enacted by the Naqqal (storyteller) is
based freely upon the major literary masterpieces, predominantly the Shahnama
of FirdausT. The story is serialized, so that a new segment is told daily. In this
fashion it may take a storyteller as long as a year to complete the entire tale. Mary
Ellen Page, who conducted field research on storytelling in Iran from 1974—5
writes:
Each storyteller is associated with a different coffeehouse where men would come daily at specified times to see him perform. A storyteller may perform in two coffeehouses in one day, or two storytellers may perform at different times in the same coffeehouse. The storyteller . . . may split up his year, spending some time in one town and some time in another town. The clientele is primarily composed of regulars who come every day to hear the story. These men form an attachment to the storyteller, to the coffeehouse, and to the time of day.40
In conformity with the other performing modalities of Iran, the Naqqal not
only digresses and deviates from the text, but interprets the material in accor
dance with the situation of the day, making it more relevant and meaningful to
the audience. Though not everything is acted out as in real theatre, the Naqqal
can still bring his listeners to laughter and tears by hand and body movements
and variable voice pitches and mimicry. A good Naqqal can fire the imagination
of the audience to such an extent that they can see scenes which could not be
provided by the best-equipped rotating stage, cleverly costumed actors, or any
of the special effects available in modern conventional theatres.
Despite the many efforts to revive Naqqali at the four festivals of the arts
devoted to storytelling at Tus-Mashad from 1975 to 1978, this art is rapidly
dying out. As Page reports:
In major cities, one may still find the traditional storyteller performing daily before a crowd of as many as 100 to 200 men. While the craft is certainly one that has been practised for centuries in Iran, it is now rapidly falling off. In the city of Shiraz in 1974
1975, there were four full-time storytellers.41
The dramatic tradition of Iran owes much to such indigenous performing
modalities as Naqqali and puppetry, but a different dimension is also contributed
by uniquely Iranian religious dramas and pageants. Though Tacziya has been
discussed elsewhere in this chapter at greater length, it deserves mention here for
the role it has played in the evolution of the secular theatre in Iran.

ENTERTAINMENT, MEDIA AND SOCIAL CHANGE
The evolution of western drama from the cycles of mystery and miracle plays
is well known. Less well understood is the parallel development in Iran. Bythe
late 19thcentury, the mystery play, Tacziya, wason the brink of giving birth toa
secular Iranian drama. Had this happened, it isunlikely that religious theatre
would have disappeared; rather, it would have paralleled the newly emerging
secular theatre. However, the successful conversion ofreligious ritual drama
into secular drama was thwarted for two reasons. The intellectual elite consid
ered Tacziya to bea backward superstition-ridden ritual, and were farmore
attracted towestern-style theatre.
From the middle ofthe 19th century onward, the production of western
dramas was encouraged. After Nasir al-DIn Shah and his entourage began
extensively to visit Europe, a theatre hall wasestablished at thelocal polytechnic
in Tehran. In this early period, theIranians merely adapted French plays, mostly
by Moliere. Characters from the French dramas and ambiance were Persianized,
and local proverbs and stories were incorporated. The audience consisted
chiefly ofthe members of the court. Perhaps because ofreligious opposition,
this theatre had a short life.42
At about the same time as western dramas were being adapted, Persian
playwrights began experimenting with writing plays in the western manner.
The father ofthis period ofPersian drama was Mirza Fath CA1I Akhundzada.
Ironically, though his parents were from Iranian Azerbaijan, Akhundzada lived
in the Russian Caucasus and wrote in Azari Turkish. Today, many nations claim
him as their own.
His dramas, translated into Persian, served formany years asmodelsfor
playwrights in Iran.43 The spoken idiom of Akhiindzada's comedies became the
mode for literary expression, and the themes of his plays became vehicles for
42 Dar al-Funun was founded in 1850, and theatrical production began in 1886 and lasted six years. LeMisanthrope was translated into Persian byMirza Habib Isfaha.nl, and published in18691870 in Istanbul, where he lived. Following the example of the Turkish translators, who gave French characters Turkish cultural characteristics, Isfahanl also Persianized the characters and locationsin his translation of the same play. Another Moliere play staged at thepolytechnic was Le Medicin Malgre Lui (Tablb-i IjbarT).See also CA1T Naslriyan, "Nazarl bi hunar-i namayish dar Iran." 43 InRussian he is known as Akhundov. His six comedies were translated into Persian by Mirza Muhammad Jacfar Qarajadaghi in 1874, and had a great impact on the development of drama in Iran, and also on its prose. The translator in the introduction to the Persian edition emphasizes both the educational value ofthe theatre and the importance ofthe simple colloquial language when he writes: "both the literate and the illiterate, bymeans of reading and hearing, may benefit from the lessons exemplified in the plays". H. Kamshad, p. 28. French translations appear in M.F.A. Akhundov, Comedies (Paris, 1967). For a list of other translations, see Gaffary, F. in L.P. FJwellSutton (ed.), Bibliographical Guide toIran (Brighton, 1983). See also F. Adamiyyat, Andishaha-yi Akhundzada.

social criticism. Akhundzada wrote, in the introduction to his plays, that "The
purpose of dramatic art is to improve people's morals, and to give the reader or
spectator instruction." Thus, the corruption of judges and officials, the abuse of
power, and the superstition and ignorance of the average citizen were severely
and wittily — criticized in his works. This maintains a certain continuity with the
skits of the traditional Iranian improvisatory theatre, the Taqlids.
Akhundzada's influence can be best be seen in the three plays written in
Persian by Mirza Aqa Tabriz!, the great pioneer of Persian drama. Though his
plays were more suitable for reading than for staging, they nevertheless achieved
a great breakthrough in the development of Persian drama, and had a powerful
effect on the audience. The plays so cleverly criticized Iranian political institu
tions, corrupt officials, and the passivity of the people that the author had to
conceal his identity. By attributing the plays to Mirza Malkum Khan, who was
living in exile in Europe at thetime, TabrizI wasprotected from the wrath ofthe
Shah and his government.44
The first modern dramatist to write in Persian, according to Yarshater, was
Mirza Ahmad Mahmudi (1875—1931). "Writing in colloquial Persian marks a
great break with the tradition of using polite speech in writings."45 This is
especially apparent in Mahmudrs play entitled UstadNauru^ Plna-Du^ ("Master
Nauruz the Cobbler"), published in 1919.
Persian drama in the 20th century was by turns stimulated or impeded by
social and political conditions. After the Constitutional Revolution of 1906,
many of the dramas written resembled political pamphlets rather than dramatic
productions.
Riza Shah's advancement to the throne did little to enhance the development
of the theatre. Patriotic and didactic subject matter pervaded the scene. A good
example of this sort of play is MrusJ-ji HusainAqa ("Mr Hussain's Wedding"),
by cAli Nasr. In this work the author stresses the need for literacy and education
for the advancement of the nation, and the continual fight against ignorance and
drug addiction.
Another negative characteristic of this period was the proliferation of
second-rate sentimental plays. Discouraged by the unfulfilled expectations of
the Constitutional Monarchy, playwrights of this period, like novelists of the
time, were escaping into theglory of the past. Many of the patriotic plays were so
44 In 1908 three plays were published in Tabriz paper Ittihad; Sargu^asht-i Ashraf Khan; TarJq-i Hukumat-i Zaman Khan-i BurujirdIand Hikayat-i Karba!a Raftan-i Shah Quti Mlr^a. It was only in 195 6 that the Soviet Azarbaijani scholars discovered the real author of these plays. See Algar, Mlr^a Malkum Khan. 45 Yarshater, "Development of Persian Drama", p. 30.

sentimental, unsophisticated, andidealistic that they were suitable only for
staging byhigh school students. The best representative of the sentimental
patriotic play, is the play by Mirzada Tshqi, Kastakhl^-i Salatln-i Iran dar
Kharabiha-ji Made?in ("The Resurrection of Persian Kings in the Ruins of
Ctesiphon").
However, thepositive side of Persian drama in this period must not be
neglected. Perhaps in reaction to social injustice and political censorship, which
was very powerful at the time, playwrights began writing exquisite satires. A
comedy, referred toabove, by Hasan Muqaddam entitled Jacfar Khana\ Firang
Amada ("Jacfar Khan isback from Europe") could serve as the best example of
an early satire, one sopopular that forty years later the same theme, but in a
serious tone, was continued inGharb^adagJ ("Infatuation with the West"). The
butt of jokes inthis play isan Iranian who, after avisit toEurope, apes western
speech patterns, attire, body motions and manners. Nevertheless, E.G. Browne
aptly sums up the state ofdramatic art inIran in 1924 when he concludes: "In
short, the drama has notsucceeded in establishing itself in Persia."46
The abdication of Riza Shah in 1941 prompted two developments inIranian
theatre: political and technical. The removal of unremitting censorship enabled
many theatrical companies to come into being. Freedom ofexpression helped
the development of drama, theatrical craft, and playwrighting. However, many
of the companies started using the theatres for political ends, particularly for the
expression ofleftist political ideas. One ofthe outstanding men ofthe theatre
was cAbd al-Husain Nushin, playwright, director, actor, andproducer. He
attracted to his theatre in Lalazar street the intelligentsia and members of the
middle class.
After World War II this theatre closed, andNushin moved to the Sacdi
Theatre, where he produced modern Persian plays andwestern classics. In
addition tothe Sacdl Theatre, three others should bementioned: the Firdausi,
the Dihqan, and the Barbad. CA1INasr organized adrama school attached to the
Dihqan Theatre.
Technical developments inthe theatre inthis period were also striking, and
the greatest innovations were in staging and production. Itis significant that the
most interesting and original development, the forestage skit, was a byproduct
of the traditional Iranian performing arts. This acting in front of the curtain was
invented as a "time killer" toamuse the audience during the entr'acte while the
decor was being changed on stage. Outside Tehran, the short but full theatrical

life in Tabriz must be mentioned, particularly in 1946. Under the Soviet
influence, the nationalized theatre, with salaried actors and technicians,
thrived.47
This period of expansion and experiment was eclipsed somewhat by the
return of strict censorship in 1953, and playwrights had to use symbolic
language in order to circumvent it. However, this temporary decline was
arrested in some measure by Iranian radio dramas when more theatrical plays
were broadcast. Yarshater, however, is critical of this development: "The radio
plays were mainly romantic, moralizing, or farcical, and they often exhibited
weak dramatic construction and unconvincing character development. For
dramatic impact, the writers of these plays relied much more on external
expressions of human emotion than on internal tensions derived from the
unfolding of the action."48
Towards the end of the 1950s Guruh-i Hunar-i Milti (National Art Group)
helped to re-establish theatre in Iran, by assimilating the best playwrights, stage
directors and actors, and by sending the first Persian theatre group to the
Theatre des Nations Festival in Paris in 1959. They took to Paris Bulbul-i
Sargashta ("The Bewildered Nightingale"), written by Naslriyan, in which
Persian folklore is featured.
In the 1960s Persian drama andtheatre came of age. TheDepartment of Fine
Arts, subsequently taken over by theMinistry of Arts andCulture, established a
school of acting, Dabiristan-i Hunar-plshagi\ and a School of Dramatic Arts,
Danishkada-i Hunarha-ji dramattk. In 1965 the Fine Arts College of Tehran
University established a drama section, Guruh-iNamayishi. The Ministry ofArt
and Culture created a theatre bureau, Idara-ji Tiatr, which wasto look after the
affairs of national theatres, actors, translators, and playwrights.
National Iranian television (NITV) sponsored theatrical programmes as well
as a theatrical workshop, Kargah-i Namayish, which promoted theproduction of
experimental plays both on television and the stage.
Other factors which contributed to thematuration of Persian drama were the
commercial and state-supported theatres which were active at this time, and the
establishment of the Shlraz Arts Festival in 1967, which often had theatre asits
central theme. Thus it is not surprising that drama became a potent and
appreciable artistic genre in the 1960s. The economic and social changes, the
urbanization of society, and the growth of the middle classes all helped drama
from the environmental side. As for its dramatic style:

ENTERTAINMENT, MEDIA AND SOCIAL CHANGE
Iran has masterminded one of the major innovations of all Persian writing. Drama has been the forerunner in adapting colloquial speech and its phonetic spelling toliterary expression. Original Persian comedy, written as far back as the late twenties, has attempted to portray speaking as they do in daily intercourse. Its influences are everywhere. Phonetic colloquial dialogue is used in fiction as well as in poetry, and has been advanced to the stage where even regional and class distinctions are discernible and are used skillfully in the service of characterization. It seems clear, moreover, that the theater was a natural breeding ground for this development. It is essentially an aural innovation, one that is meant to be heard, and while it can be effective in a text, it is more so on stage.49
There are two main schools ofplaywrighting inIran. One group, though
familiar with western drama, borrows very little of it, mainly the structural
setting ofplays. This school turns instead to Iranian folklore and traditional
entertainment, and reuses the traditional stock characters. All Nasiriyan isthe
earliest playwright of this school. Before hestarted to write his own plays,
Nasiriyan produced onstage the adaptations ofthe two works ofthe leading
Iranian writer, Sadiq Hidayat. Naslriyan's The Golden Serpent (1957) was inspired
by thetraditional public square and coffeehouse performance of huqqa-ba\
(conjuror) and mar-glr (snakecharmer). His Siyah (i960) is the principal character
of the traditional improvisatory Iranian comedy, adapted for the modern stage.
Ruhauzi, discussed earlier, had an impact on many contemporary play
wrights. Bizhan Mufid seems tohave taken more of Ruhauzi elements into his
Jan Nisar play than any other dramatist. The play was first performed in Tehran
in 1973 under the direction of the author. In addition to its grotesque stock
characters, the play is constructed in such a way that it encourages actors to
improvise. Another playwright inspired byRuhauzi is Ashurbanlpal Babilla,
whose Tonight is Moonlight was well-received atthe Shlraz Festival in 1974. Iraj
Saghiri's Qalandar-khana, woven on the canvas of folklore and Tacziya, was
acclaimed in Shlraz at the following festival in 1975.
The main representative ofthis traditionally influenced school ofdrama is
Bahram Baiza°i, playwright, film director, theatre historian, and professor of
drama. His SihNamayishnama-ji carusakl (Three Puppet Shows) is thebest
example of this genre. Baiza°i not only utilizes Persian folklore but makes use of
classical Persian literature and Islam toemphasize the struggles oflife and the
futility ofover-emphasis on man's destiny. The perennial fight between good
and evil is represented in this play by the characters Hero and Demon, who are
reminiscent ofthe pre-Islamic and Zoroastrian entities. The trilogy uses the
same set ofcharacters throughout, four ofwhom, Puppeteer, Hero, Girl, and

DRAMA
Monster are derived from Khaima-yi Shab-bazi. Girl represents love; andthe
jester Black Man{Siyah) stands for faithfulness andthesufferings of an outsider's
unrequited love. Hisis a superficial blackness; notthewickedness attributed toa
monster, but a skin-deep attribute which makes him socially unacceptable, just
as the Girl's blue eyes represent her innocence and desirability to Hero.
The puppeteer, whom one mayalso consider as another main character, has
made these puppets and is responsible for their performance. He depends on
them to please theaudience andearn hima living. Like allPersian puppeteers, he
is also a participant in their dialogue, as though he were oneof them. When they
try at times to escape from their predetermined actions to develop a life and
defiant actions of their own, thepuppeteer threatens them with imprisonment in
their trunk unless they obey him. He even has the power to destroy them.
In all of these traditionally inspired dramas, the symbolism of light and dark
play an important role, andall badthings happen at night. Thunderstorms stand
for violence, and colours represent different qualities: green is the colour of
paradise, red flowers probably represent passion, and blue is the colour of pure
love.50
Fal Gush, written by a leading Iranian painter and poet, Manuchihr Yakta°i,
(1922-) belongs to this school. Actually, it belongs in a class by itself, as it fuses
traditional and modern elements in a unique way. Yakta°I has written an epic
poem in the dramatic language of story-telling, thus fusing two traditional
modalities, thewritten (epic poetry), andthe spoken (story-telling). Further, the
author hasemployed modern idiom to produce a work to be staged, rather than
read or spoken. Its Brechtian qualities of narrative theatre areanother facet ofits
dramatic and theatrical dimension. When it was staged at the Festival of Shiraz
in 1973—4, the actors were professional story-tellers.51
This is another example of how thedevelopment of drama and theatre in Iran
has had an intrinsic relation with the traditional Iranian culture.
The second school of dramatists in Iran base their work to a great extent on
western patterns, especially those of the post-World WarII playwrights such as
50 An excellent annotated English translation of the Three Puppet Shows appears in Gisele Kapuscinski's Ph.D. dissertation PersianTheaterin the 1960s (Columbia University, 1982). 51 Fal Gushwas published in Tehran in 1970. It contains 2,480 lines. To appreciate the unique qualities of this work, one must have some understanding of Persian storytelling. Traditional storytelling is not merely the recitation of a literary work; rather, the storytellers combine their recitation with a tumar, which is an accompanying story outline which provides detailed descriptions of the circumstances in the story, psychological motivations, and other information necessary for the successful interpretation of the story. Normally, the epic poem and the tumar are two separate works. The genius of this author was in fusing the poem and the tumar into one piece, producing a new dimension in the dramatic tradition.

Beckett and Ionesco. The action is set predominantly in an Iranian environment.
The best representative ofthis group is Ghulam Husain Sacidi (b. 1935) who
writes under the pen name of Gauhar-i Murad. A doctor of medicine, Sacidi
practised in the slums of Tehran for a nominal fee. Heis also a psychiatrist,
writer, and amateur anthropologist, who asanactive opponent to the Shah's
regime spent some time inprison. His plays are filled with political symbolism
and allegory. Yarshater has commented that, "Character delineation and dia
logue sequences in Sacidi's plays are achieved with a sure hand and a natural
sense of dramatic effect, while the tension of the situation is periodically relieved
by humorous episodes or remarks."52
Sacidi's play A-yi ba-kulah A-yi bi-kulah(1967), the title of which is difficult to
translate, but may be rendered into English as Long A, Short A,53is aplay in two
acts which satirizes contemporary Persian behaviour. It takes place in a small
square at the intersection of several streets in amiddle class neighbourhood. The
plot deals with the reaction of the neighbourhood tothe fear that athief is in an
uninhabited house. Though there is virtually no action, the conversation
between the various participants produces avivid characterization of an old man
who discovers the activity in the empty house; his terrified daughter, a bour
geois know-it-all, who is as much acoward as the rest of the frightened crowd;a
charlatan doctor, a mechanic, a helpless policeman, and a reporter who makes
himself ridiculous. The entire play is a skit on acertain Persian milieu, showing
the members of the neighbourhood in the worst possible light. Suspense
pervades both acts, interlarded with mistrust, suspicion, rancour, and the
occasional absurd minor activity. Anoutstanding feature of both acts is the
interplay of personalities brought into vivid relief by what people say. They do
very little, apparently because there is no one to take the lead and tell them what
todo.
Under the smoke screen of symbolism and non-realistic situations, Sacidl's
ten plays carry on afrontal attack against the establishment. Another theme dear
to hisheart is thegeneration gap in Iranian society, andthe confrontation
between East and West, and between the traditional way of life and the modern
westernized lifestyles.
To the same school of drama belongs Ismacll Khalaj, whose Howareyou, Mash
Rahlm?znd Gulduna Khartum (Shlraz, 1977) focus on the plight of simple people.
Other playwrights who emphasized similar themes are Akbar RadI, Bahman
Fursi, Parviz Kardan, Arsalan Purya.
Another major figure in contemporary drama is cAbbas Naclbandiyan (b.

1947). He developed his talent while working with the experimental group ata
theatrical workshop, Kargah-i Namayish.54 His Profound, Important, and Modern
Researchin theFossils of the 2jth Geological Era won the second prize at the Shlraz
Art Festival in 1968. Thetitle of this play, like thelong titles of three of his other
works, resemble the lengthy titles common to the Tacziya plays and those ofthe
chapters of the Iranian national epic. Despite theuseof this andother features of
classical Persian literature, particularly Sufi literature, Naclbandiyan's theatrical
expression is that of Sartre and the Theatre of the Absurd.
Iranian playwrights were helped enormously by developments in the western
theatre in the 1950s and 1960s. At that time, western dramatists were breaking
away from the established conventions of time, space and action, and the
restrictions of the box-style theatre. These innovations were closer to the
traditional Iranian performances and characters, and greatly enhanced the
development of drama in Iran. It would have been impossible for them to have
developed theatre in the highly structured western conventions in so short a
period of time.
Another important aspect of this period of dramatic development in Iran was
the rising prominence of women playwrights. The prime representative is
Khujasta Kiya, whowrote and directed TheTestimony oftheMartyrdom ofHallaj
(Tehran, 1969). One of the most active authors of the modern school is Farlda
Farjam (b. 1935), a noted author of children's books who has received
numerous national and international prizes for children's literature. Interested
in women's affairs in Iran, shemade a documentary film, Islam and Women in Iran
(1981). Her plays, Tajmah, and especially jArus ("The Bride") should be
mentioned as plays about women. 54rzis, a one-act play, takes place in an old
house in the poor section of southern Tehran, and concerns the problems
encountered by childless women whose husbands take other, usually younger,
wives. This play well delineates the psychology of the traditional Iranian
working-class family.
Though the developments in Iranian theatre, both of form and content,
encouraged thespread of drama in Iran, therevolution put an endto this.55 After
the revolution in 1979,there was a short-lived period of theatrical fervour. A
54 The main artistic directors and actors of' Kargah-i namayish were Arby Ovanessian, Iraj Anvar, Shahru Khiradmand, and later Ismacil Khalaj. The importance of this theatrical workshop was not only in the development and strengthening of the technique of acting, directing, and staging, but also in attracting greater audiences to the modern Iranian theatre. 55 Of the major theatres in Tehran, two were The 25th ShahrTvar Hall and Tiatr-i Shahr. Outside Tehran a theatre run by Arham Sadr in Isfahan must be mentioned. In the years 1976-8, a Festival of Provincial Theatrical groups took place. In the years 1977-8 five issues of Theater Quarterly were published. After the Revolution a magazine devoted to theatre, under the name Sahna-yiMuasir appeared.

play by a leftish writer, S. Sultanpur, entitled Abbas Aqa, the Worker, was
staged. Itsauthor, however, was executed in June 1981, and theschools for
dramatic and theatrical arts were closed.
Despites these setbacks, what was accomplished in a short a period of time
was a remarkable leap forward in thehistory of Iranian drama and theatre.
Kapuscinski writes:
The most distinctive quality of the new genre is its uniqueness. Ontheone hand, although ithas roots in age-old customs, itcannot be considered to be descended from an ancient theatrical tradition .. .On the other hand, itowes only its inspiration and some of its dramatic techniques to the folk and religious theaters of post-Islamic Iran, or to Western drama. It must therefore beconcluded that this istruly anoriginal art form. Voicing with moving accents criticism and despair about life incontemporary Iran,its intrinsic value stems from the authors' ability to transcend the contemporary local scene and address themselves to universal themes.56
Had Goethe lived today, hewould have realized that Persian literature has
found themissing component, namely, a vibrant dramatic literature.
FILM
One would expect that incontrast tothe origin oftraditional Iranian entertain
ment, the origin and early history of film would be fully documented and clear,57
but this isnot the case. There is even adifference of opinion about when the first
film in Iran was made and by whom.
According tosome sources, the first (now non-existent) film, a documentary
of MuzafTar al-DIn Shah's coronation in 1896, was made byan Anglo-Russian
living in Iran and named Russikhan. F.GhafTari, however, claims that the first
movies were made bythe Shah's official photographer, Mirza Ibrahim Khan,
who began film-making in documentary fashion during the Shah's visit to
Europe in 1900.58
56 Kapuscinski, op. cit., p. 134. 37 I am indebted to Mr Bahman Maghsoudlou for making his manuscript under the title ¥ ilmography of Iranian Cinema, 1929-1979, available tome; this excellent manuscript isnow ready for publication. 58 While in Contrexeville, France, in the summer of1900, MuzafTar al-DIn Shah ordered his royal photographer, Mirza Ibrahim Khan, to buyequipment to make movies in Iran. Thenewly appointed royal movie maker tried out the newly purchased equipment on 18 August 1900, when he filmed "La Fete des Fleurs" on the Belgian beaches in Ostende. Thus the first Iranian film was made. As for Russikhan, Gaffary proves his point on the one hand by using the text ofMuzafTar al-DIn Shah's travelogue, and on the other by the correspondence and personal interviews with Russikhan. (Russikhan spent the last years of his life in the Parisian suburb of Saint Cloud, where hedied in 1968). GafTary proves that contrary towide-spread tradition, Russikhan did not start making films in Iran until 1907.

FILM
The traditional entertainments in Iran had been for the most part indigenous
productions intrinsically connected with the rhythm of the religious and social
life of all thepeople. They occurred in stated months, in set forms. It is therefore
not strange that movies were first shown in private houses on festive occasions
such as weddings, circumcisions, and so on, following traditional Iranian
practice. The ladies sat separately.
With the establishment of cinemas a complete change took place. Not only
was the medium foreign, but it also had no connection with former socio
religious modalities. Moreover, difficulties arose as occasional entertainment
became a mere pastime, defying traditional convention.
When the first cinema was opened in 1905 by a certain Sahhaf Bashi, it met
with immediate opposition from the clergy.59 The main difficulty lay in the
appearance of women in public, so that for a long time cinemagoers were men,
mostly from the upper classes. Later, women were admitted to separate
showings; then cinemas were established specially for women. Later, the sexes
were separated in the same theatre, and finally, they were mixed after World War
II. The attitude concerning the public appearance complicated the recruitment
and training of women for film roles. Initially, these roles were played by
elaborately disguised and/or veiled men. During the phase of silent movies, in
order to overcome the difficulty of reading the captions for the greater part ofan
illiterate audience, men walked about the theatre telling the stories, while
women performed this function in the ladies' sessions.60
Most of the foreign feature films that entered the country, usually via Russia,
were comedies. Indigenous films were chiefly newsreels. None of the early ones
have been preserved. Although Hamid Naficy has stated: "From its very
beginning, film production fell within the realm of one centralized government,
and the Iranian film industry in its infancy was limited to the role of recording
royal ceremonies and newsreel footage . . .",61 it seems that this state of affairs
was particularly true with the coming to the throne of Riza Shah. Film
production consisted mainly of newsreels of such events as Riza Shah's corona
tion, the opening of the railway system, or the establishment of the National
Bank of Iran.62
However, the royal edict to unveil women helped to increase the size of the
59 This cinema was declared illicit by Shaikh Fazl-Allah Nuri. 60 Actually, these were inserts rather than captions, which appeared every few minutes giving a summary of the dialogues and events. 61 Naficy, "Iranian Feature Film: A Brief Critical History", p. 445. 62 These newsreels were made by a professional film maker, Khan Baba Mu'tazidl. He should be considered the first man to have entered the Iranian film industry by training, and not by chance. He trained specifically in film making at Gaumont in Paris.

female audience. The development of the film industry inIran depended upon
acquiring technical skill, sophisticated film directing and better acting. It was
also a question ofeducating the public toappreciate artistic and social values
foreign to them. Unfortunately, the quality of imported films wasinferior. This
reacted upon both local production and audience values in a negative way.
The first feature film was produced in 1929—30 by the Mayak Cinema
Company, directed by Avans Ohanian, entitled Ablva Rabl\AbiandRabi). This
was animitation of a series of Danish comedies called Patte and Patachon.63
Ohanian had learned histechnique in Russia and hadestablished aworkshop for
actors in Tehran in the same year to prepare them for film production.
The first Iranian movie with asoundtrack was produced in Bombay in 19 31—2.
cAbd al-Husain Sipanta (1907—69), an Iranian writer and poet, had been
settled for some ten years among theParsees in Bombay to help with the
transliteration into Persian of the works of Zoroastrian scholars.64 He wrote the
script and acted in a film called Dukhtar-i Lur ("TheLur Girl") which Ardashir
Irani, a Parsee, directed and produced. The story was about a government
official, Jacfar, travelling to Khuzistan where he met Gulnar, acaptive dancer, in
a roadside cafe. Their love affair wasinterrupted by an attack of the bandits who
had originally kidnapped her from her father. Eventually Gulnar and Jacfar
succeeded in procuring the capture of the bandits and restoring peace tothe
region. The film was agreat success in Iran. Itwas alove story outstanding for
its musical, technical and artistic qualities.65
A parallel canbe drawn at this point with the developments in other
contemporaneous Iranian media, such as thepress. In the last quarter of the 19th
century the newly born press in Iran reflected only the opinions of the royal
court and the government. Due to strict censorship and lack of experience, the
press remained backward fora long time, while in Turkey, Egypt and India,
Iranian expatriates, like Sipanta inBombay with his films, published excellent
Persian newspapers which had an impact on Iran, especially during and after the
1906 revolution. Sipanta remained fora time in India and branched out into
films on Iranian historical heroes and literary legends, but these films were not
63 The stars of these Danish films were Schenstrom and Madsen. Mu'tazidi was a cameraman in this Ohanian film. 64 Sipanta left Iran for India in 1306/1928. In Bombay between 1306 and 1315 hetranslatedand authored nine books ontopics ranging from the life of Zoroaster topoetry ofthe 20th-century bard Arif; healso tried, however unsuccessfully, to publish two newspapers in Bombay; see Gauhar Taj Sipanta, pp. 24-9. 65 The Lur G/r/was first shown inTehran inJanuary 1933, and continued tobe shown forthe next seven months. Atthat time there were eight cinemas in theIranian capital, including a luxuryone called the Cinema Palace, where the first film with a sound track in English was shown. There were only a few cinemas in the provinces.

well enough produced to be successful.66 Meanwhile in Iran a silent feature film
called HajjJ Aqa ¥ilm Star (1932) was made by Ohanian. In it a traditionally
religious father, antagonistic to the film industry, is brought to approve of it bya
film made without his knowledge of himself and his way of life. This film
illustrates the social mood of the times and the difficulties confronting film
makers.
In addition to the shortage of equipment, new governmental taxes created
more difficulties and slowed down further production until after World WarII.
In 1937Sipanta returned to Iran in the hopes of helping with the development of
the Iranian film industry, but the state of Iranian film production discouraged
him and he turned to journalism.67 As has already been said, the low quality of
imported films had an impact not only on local imitative production but on the
taste of the slowly increasing audiences.
As is evident from Table 1 (see p. 806),not a single feature film was made in
Iran during the decade 1937—47, which included the Second World War period.
Yet statistics show that some 250 foreign films were exhibited annually
throughout the same ten years.
Like the first Persian sound movie, which was produced in India, the first
dubbing into Persian was also done outside the country, fifteen years later, in
Turkey in 1946.68 The man responsible for this was Dr Ismacil Kushan (1914
81). In Iran he established the Mitra Film society, which was involved both in
dubbing and film production. Subsequently, Mitra split into two companies of
which Pars Film Studio is still in existence.
His first film, Tufan-i Zindagl ("The Tempest of Life"),69 showed the
weakness of the Persian film industry both in technique and plot writing. The
public preferred foreign dubbed films, but Dr Kushan did not give up and in
1949—50 he produced a film called Sharmsar ("Ashamed"), the plot of which
66 To make films on Iranian history and literature which Sipanta undertook would be too ambitious for the most sophisticated film producers of today. The film about Firdausi was intended for the poet's millennium; Chashman-i Siyah ("The Black Eyes") (1935) was about the reign of Nadir Shah; the next two films, Khusrauva Shlrln (1934) and Laila va Majnun (1936) were based on the celebrated romantic and mystical poems by the 12th-century poet Nizami. Several unsuccessful attempts were made in recent years to film these stories so dear to the Iranian spirit: Lai/a vaMajnun in colour (1956) by Muhsin Nurbakhsh and in cinemascope (1970) by Ibrahim Zamani Ashtiyani; Shlrln va Farhad in colour (1970) by Ismacil Kushan; Yusuf va Zulaikha (1956) by S. Yasimi and in cinemascope (1968) by Mahdl Raisfiruz; Rustam va Suhrab (1956-7) by Jannati cAta:T and Mahdl Raisfiruz; Bi^ban va Manl^ha (1958) by S. Yasimi and Ismacll Kushan.
67 Sipanta, op. cit., pp. 36-42. 68 The first film dubbed into Persian was a French movie called Premier Rendezvous directed by Henri Decoin. 69 The importance of this film is mainly historical - it was the first sound feature movie fully produced in Iran. Screenplay written by Nizam Vafa; directed by Muhammad CA1T Daryabigl; producer, 1. Kushan; by Pars Film Studio. It was first shown in Tehran on 26 April 1948.

became a model for many subsequent productions. In this one, Maryam, a
betrothed country girl, isseduced by ayoung man from the city. Ashamed, she
goes to town and becomes awealthy and famous singer. Her lover finds her, but
so does her ex-fiance, who murders her lover. Years later the pair return tothe
village together. The producer, inorder tomake his film profitable, cast a very
well-known singer, Dilkash, in the leading role. This made the film very popular
and lucrative, but unfortunately the banal scenario became aprototype for many
films to follow. The success of Dr Kushan's enterprise induced other Iraniansto
enter the film business. Many film companies were established hastily, addingto
the low quality ofthe current films, in which dancing and singing were major
features.
The plots of these films may be generalized as follows. The scene often
originates in avillage or tribal community. Agirl is either engaged to aman she
does not love, or is in love with aninappropriate man disapproved of by her
father. She usually escapes to town with her lover and becomes either a dancer or
a singer in a cafe. The lover may or may not have made her pregnant. If he has she
may contemplate suicide inthe event ofdesertion by him. Sometimes the man
she was betrothed to kills the lover and takes her back to the village. In each case
the emphasis is upon the pure life in the rural area, and the corruption of the
town.
Revenge is a traditional Iranian theme and greatly utilized byIranian film
makers. Not only does it add to the suspense ofthe plot, but it wins over the
audience who empathize with the passionate settling ofaccounts, particularly
when family honour is at stake. Revenge is carried outmainly by themale
members ofa family ortribe. Sometimes two men love the same girl and fight
over her. Great stress is laid upon masculine strength and dominance,
reminiscent of the wrestlers and of Rustam, the traditional superhero.
Musclemen abound onthe screen.
Excitement isgenerated by strength rather than sexual overtures. Violence
plays aprominent part. (This was also more acceptable to the religious element.)
To underscore this point itshould be mentioned that one of the greatest money
earners of the Iranian cinema was a wrestling champion, Muhammad cAli
Fardin, who began tostar in 1959. Inthe 1970s the most popular actor, localor
foreign, was Bruce Lee, the "Kung Fu" champion. The Way of the Dragon, in
which he shines, broke all popularity records.70 The use of physical strengthin
the service of the poor, wronged, and oppressed has been atraditional themein

FILM
selfless musclemen are the men with the corrupting power of money. One may
note, however, that this theme has been greatly overworked by the Iranian film
makers.
Women on the other hand are billed as dukhtar which can either mean
daughter or a girl. Veiled girls are faceless and identified only as the father's
possession, to be bartered in marriage. In the films where the veil is dropped a
woman becomes a degenerate and a sex symbol in the cafe. Stress is placed upon
the traditional values of women, such as self-sacrifice, purity, and motherhood.
Dilkash was the first woman to make the transition to popular acceptance as an
actress and singer. Scanning the titles of the Iranian films produced in the last 50
years, it is apparent that more titles contain the word dukhtar than any other
word. This could be a tradition established by the first successful film with a
soundtrack, Dukhtar-i Lur, or else the word is used as an eye-catching sex
symbol on a billboard. The latter seems more probable.
The second archetype for many films in the later period was Ganj-i Qarun
("The Treasure of Qarun"),71 produced and directed by Siyamak Yasimi with
the famous former wrestler Fardin in the leading role. The structure of the
screenplay, written by Yasimi, was influenced by American films of the late 30s
and early 40s. A young man prevents a rich man from committing suicide and
takes him home and cares for him. At home the mother of the rescuer reveals the
identity of the would-be suicide as the young man's own father who had left the
family many years before. Drinking and debauchery had finally led him to the
suicide attempt. The young man then turns against him until his father repents
adequately and wins the son over. Though the structure of the film was foreign,
the treatment of the themes was very Iranian. This is especially apparent in the
depiction of family relations, the portrayal of the corruptive influence of bad
friends, and the treatment of the complex aspects of forgiveness.
The dubbing technique, a blessing immediately after World War II when the
first foreign films thus became comprehensible to Iranian audiences, developed
into a peculiar tool in the local Persian production because well-trained actors
were by-passed in favour of good looking muscle-men, who often were
untrained and counted from one to ten while the Persian text was being read by
someone else, sometimes by real actors. This procedure did a disservice to the
artistic dimension of Persian film. Dubbing was also utilized as a useful means of
getting around both the political and moral censorship. Thanks to the dubbing,
the dialogue could be easily altered.
Fortunately not all film-makers followed the sterotyped model. The first
71 This half-colour movie was the biggest box-office draw in the history of the Iranian cinema; in Tehran alone, more than one million viewers saw it.

Cine club "Kaniin-i Mill! Film" was established atthe end of 1949 and had a
significant impact on producers, directors, actors andthe audience. Itorganized
the first film festivals inIran, one for English films in 1950,and another for
French films in 1951. Criticism, which had always been aweak point in Iranian
tradition, had a constructive impact on the film milieu. Slowly the qualityof
Iranian films improved.
In 1955the "Pars Film Productions" made afilm based on a popular Iranian
novel, Amir Arsalan Namdar, which could be considered the most successful
film of the half century. However, soon afterwards, additional government
taxes were imposed and caused a setback.
It was not until 1958 that a real breakthrough occurred. Up to that time
programming was oriented toward amusement and commercial gain. Farrukh
Ghafrarl, educated in France, made afilm called Janub-iShahr ("South Endof the
City") which was arealistic portrayal of the slum dwellers in southern Tehran.
This was the beginning of serious attempts of a sociological kind to show the
misery of the life of the underdog in achanging society. This film was censored
out of existence. Realizing that the time hadnot yet come to expose the realities
of society, GhafHri escaped into 1001 Nights and used one of those stories asthe
basis of his next film, produced in 1963 andcalled Shab-iQui(i'("The Night of the Hunchback").72
Three other important films were produced in the 1960s. Siyavash in Persepolis
(1963/1964) by Firaidun Rahnama (1930—75), whowasalso agood poet, so that
there is a poetic quality to his film, concerns one ofthe heroes of Firdausi's
Shahnama. This film wasvery well received by the critics of the West, but made
no headway inIran.73 Khisht va Ayina (1965) ("Mudbrick and Mirror") was
produced and directed by Ibrahim Gulistan74 and Parastuha ba Lana
Barmigardand (1963) ("The Swallows Return to Their Nests") was written,
produced and directed by Majid Muhsinl.75 These films could not, however,

Working very hard, hemanages to send his second son to Paris tofurther his education. After a time when he learns that his son isnot doing well and hasno intention of returning home, the father sends the son a letter containing a bit of Iranian soil. Touched, the sonis moved to finish hisstudies andreturn home.

FILM
time when GhafTari produced his first film in 1958 the first commerical televi
sion modelled on American programmes was established in Iran. Television
further exposed Iranian audiences to cheap western films.
It is interesting to regard Iran's own cinema from the mid 1950s as a social
phenomenon.76 Differences in local environment must be considered, as be
tween thecapital andtheprovincial towns. In Tehran showings usually began at
10 a.m. and were repeated every two hours until midnight. In Tehran teenage
girls going to movies would be accompanied by their brothers or cousins, which
did not prevent the Tehran youth from leaving school clandestinely and meeting
in the cinemas for their ownpurposes during the daytime. In the evening shows,
men viewers predominated, particularly in the provinces.
Whereas Iranian graphic artists produced some artistically appealing and
interesting film posters, unfortunately the majority of the billboard displays
were vulgar and offensively revealing of parts of the body.
In the movies nuts and seeds are constantly eaten. Shells litter the floor,
instead of the soft drink cans and chocolate wrappers as in the West. Audience
involvement is far greater than in western theatres, because spectators identify
closely with the actors. In the small provincial towns, if couples or whole
families went to the cinema, the women would be veiled, in sharp contrast tothe
women on the screen, who unrestrainedly exposed their flesh.
Criticism of the film industry appeared in the Press. Already in 1930 the
newspaper Ayanda-yi Iran wrote: "Cinema is primarily the best form of enter
tainment and the most noble invention . . . Unfortunately, in Iran it has not
achieved the desired result since it has fallen into the hands of a group of cheats
whose only aim is to fill their purses. Cinema provides two useful purposes: the
refinement of morals and secondarily, recreation. As far as its ethical value is
concerned, the movies in Tehran have achieved the opposite of this aim:
censorship only prevents those films from being shown which are considered
politically unsound, but as far as morals are concerned, no one pays any
attention. Films in the Iranian cinema are predominantly French. They are
sexually arousing, concerned with love making, and even excite octogenarians.
What about young unmarried men and innocent girls who come to the cinema
for the refinement of their morals? . . . In order to remove these obstacles, one
remedy suggests itself, namely, that all films should be censored not only for
political but also for moral purposes".77
76 In 1950 there were 80 cinemas in Iran, of which 20 were open-air theatres, operating some six months of the year. 77 Ayanda-yi Iran, 31 TTr 1309, the article on cinema is entitled "Ma/iyat bar SJnama"'.

The religious authorities never relaxed opposition to the cinema, particularly
in or near the pilgrimage centres like Qum. The greatest tragedy took place
during the revolutionary upheaval in Iran in 1978 when acinema in Abadan was
destroyed byfire while 430 young viewers were trapped inside. The origin of
this fire remains a mystery.78
This study has so far only dealt with full length feature films. Before entering
upon the final successful phase offilm production, when Iranian films received
international recognition, we should examine the short-length, predominantly
documentary films, which paved the wayfor the "new wave" of Iranian
cinematography. The short story is the most vibrant genre of Persian prose, the
one in which public issues and art are equally served. Parallel to the success of the
short story inmodern Persian literature isthe success ofthe short-length film.
The number ofIranian film directors who received international prizesfor
short films is astonishing. Starting with three films by Gulistan, an accom
plished short story writer, we have A Fire^ awarded a prize at the Venice Festival
in 1961; Wave,Coral,andRock^ awarded aprize at San Francisco Festival in 1962;
MarUk, awarded the prize ofthe Pessaro Festival in 1963. In 1963, the famous
young poetess, Furugh Farrukhzad (1935—1967), directed a short film entitled
Khana SiyahAst ("The House is Black") about aleper colony. The photography
of this film and its poetic insight are very moving. Kamran Shirdil directed The
Mirror',which received an award inJapan, in 1967; his The Night It Rained was
awarded the Grand Prix at Tehran International Film Festival in 1974. Nasir
Taqva3! received awards for his Deliverance atthe International Film Festival for
Children in Tehran, 1971, andagain in 1972 and 1973 in Venice and San
Francisco. Bahram Baiza°I received a prize forhis Journey at the Tehran Inter
national Film Festival for Children in 1972. Parviz Kimiyavi received awards for
Oh, Protector of the Gazelle! in Turkey and at Monte Carlo, and at Monte Carlo
and in Switzerland for his film, (P' hike Pelican. Amir Nadir! received the Grand
Prix for his short film called To Wait at. the eleventh International Meeting of the
Young Film Directors atCannes in 1975. Other young directors who achieved
international recognition forshort length films are: Hazhlr Daryush; Ahmad
Farughi; Sadiq Misqali; Abbas Kiya Rustami; Hushang Shaft!; Khusrau SIna°I,
Manuchihr Tayyab.
The success ofthe short film could not have been fully achieved without the
help of the Ministry of Art and Culture, of the Iranian National Radio
Television (NIRT) and of the Institute for Intellectual Development of Children
and Young Adults. These institutions sponsored, commissioned, financially

supported or equipped thedirectors andtheir crews. A full-length documentary
film called TheHouse of God, produced and directed in 1966 by AbuDl-Qasim
Riza°i, about the pilgrimage to Mecca, achieved great success in Iran and other
Muslim countries. The 1970s also witnessed a rapid increase in the number of
amateur film producers who organized Sinama-yi A%ad (The Free Cinema) in
1969. They used super-eight movie film. With theassistance of NIRT this group
also became active in theprovinces. Theextent of their talent is evidenced by the
number of festival prizes they won.
In the decade 1966—77 the Iranian cinema came of age. The new spirit grew
and a new way of film making came into being. Naficy spoke of " . . . a
progressive national film movement".79 This development wasthe result ofthe
influence of many important factors. Many talented and foreign-trained film
directors, camera men, film technicians and other skilled people appeared.
Writers, poets andplaywrights joined in preparing socially oriented and realisti
cally written screen plays. Suffice it to mention only three of these men: Gh.H.
Sacidi, a playwright; S. Chubak, a prose writer; and A. Shamlu, a poet. The
activities of filmmakers and screenwriters coincided with the flowering of film
festivals in Iran such as The Tehran International Educational Film Festival,
1963—77; International Children and Young Adults Film Festival, 1966—77;
Tehran International Film Festival, 1972—7; Iranian National Film Festival,
"SEPAS", 1969-75; Asian Youth Film Festival, 1973-7; Super-8 International
Film Festival, 1975—7; Shiraz Arts Festival — Cinema Section, 1967—77.
The participation of Iranian films in international festivals outside Iran must
also be mentioned. The drama schools and the film school were expanding and
young film lovers and critics could exchange ideas in the film clubs. Money was
generously injected into specially formed film companies, sponsored by NIRT
and the Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young
Adults. Paradoxically, the same institutions which sponsored the new progres
sive national film movement often banned the films made for political and social
reasons. Films which had won prizes at international festivals were shown
promptly, but most films were released to the public only after two or three
years' delay. The opposite situation occurred when a film produced by NIRT
and called Mughulha ("The Mongols") (1973)80 was released in spite of the fact
that it criticized television as destroying Iranian culture as the Mongols had
done.
An outstanding film of the new progressive wave in Iranian cinema was
79 Naficy, op. cit., p . 4 5 2 . 80 TheMongols was written, directed, and acted by Parviz KImiyavi, a graduate of IDHEC, Paris. This fantasy film with powerful social content has been acclaimed by many international film critics.

Qaisar (1969), directed by M. Kimya°i, which wonthe Grand Prix at the Ministry
of Arts and Culture Film Festival in 1971.81 The leading actor was Bihruz
Vusuql, who subsequently became the most famous Iranian cinema actor,
winning several other prizes both inIran and outside the country.82
The film called Gav("Cow") (1969), directed by Daryush Mihrju^I wasthe
first Iranian film to win amajor international award, at the Venice International
Film Festival in 1971. In the same year the film received aspecial mention at the
Chicago Film Festival. The leading actor, Intizami, won the prize for the best
actor atthe same festival. The simple plot ofthe film tells ofhow a villager,
whose only source ofsustenance ishis cow, acts like the cow after the animal
suddenly dies. This scenario, written by Sacidi, manages by its progression to
encompass the misery and limits of village life.83 The fact that this film made no
money was of no significance since itwas subsidized, but italso shows that the
Persian general public was unready for such an expose of village life. It had been
produced by the Ministry of Art and Culture but wasbanned in Iran for political
reasons. The director, Mihrju^T, smuggled acopy of the film out of the country
to the Venice Art Festival. After ithad been widely acclaimed, the government
felt obliged to show it in Iran.
Another film, also directed by MihrjuDi, wascalled the Dayira-ji Mina ("Mina
Cycle") (1975).84 This time the criticism was of the urban environment wherea
Mafia type organization sells polluted blood to hospitals. The juxtaposition of
affluent people who became rich illicitly and the poor contains the seedsof
revolution. This film wasfinallyreleased in 1977,when the Iranian revolution
was about to start.
One of the most interesting film directors is Bahram Baiza°i. His background
is unusual in that hebegan his career as anacademician doing research in
traditional Iranian theatre, which led him tobecome a playwright and afilm
director. Ragbar ("Downpour") (1972) was his first film; the second wasThe
Stranger andthe Fog(1974), and the third, The Crow,in 1977. Although he is very
"Persian" inhis theatre plays, inhis films he becomes cosmopolitan.85
In addition to two well-known screenplays written by Sacidi, four films based
81 Inthis film, a traditional theme ofrevenge, received a completely new treatment inthe sociopsychological convention andachieved a new dimension in film technique. 82 B. Vusuql was chosen as the best male actor at the Tehran International Film Festival in 1974 and at theDelhi International Film Festival in 1975. 83 The screenplay ofGav is based on the short story by Gh. H. Sacidi, called TheMourners of Bayall. 84 Thescreenplay by Gh.H. Sacidi and D. Mihrju^i is based on the novel by Sacidi called Ashghaldurii. Producer: Telfilm NIRT. This film received an International Critic's prize atthe Berlin Film Festival in 1978. 85 His last film was finished in 1980 and is called The Ballade of Tara.

on contemporary Iranian literature deserve mention. Dash Akul (1971)86 was
based on a short story by Sadiq Hidayat. It won the Grand Prix at the Iranian
Film Festival, and Honorable Mention at the Tashkent Film Festival. Tangsir
(1973) was based on the novel of that name by S. Chubak and directed by
Klmya^i. Shauhar-i Ahu Khartum(1968), "Ahu Khanum's Husband", byCA1I
Muhammad Afghani, wasa novel turned into a screenplay andthen made into a
film under the direction and production of Davud Mullapur. Fourth in this
series of films derived from contemporary literature wasPrince Ihtijab^ based on
the story written by Hushang Gulshlri and directed by Bahman Farmanara in
1974.
Bahman Maghsoudlou sums up the state of the art of film-making in Iran
when he says that the Iranian film has so far failed to achieve "a blend of
traditional village life andcustoms, or therichness of Persian art forms andways
of the past, with a western film medium". Attempts, he says, to combine the
Iranian vision of the world with details of Iranian life and manners "have not
been completely successful".87
In 1976 there were great plans for foreign film-making on Iranian soil.
Additionally, Iranians wished to cooperate and co-produce with International
film companies, mainly from the U.S.A., France, Britain and Italy. A huge
complex of modern film studios was envisaged for the town of Karaj in the
vicinity of Tehran, but these ambitious plans for the future failed to materialize
because of the financial crisis of that year.
After a production peak in theearly 1970s, runaway inflation ledto a decline.
Many commercial producers were priced out of the market and the owning of
cinemas was no longer profitable. As Majid Tehranian observed, "one factor
inimical to the prosperity of the film industry was the increase of television as
popular entertainment; also price control and the low investment return on
cinemas helped to make the industry decline".88 Very low admission rates had
been maintained for years in spite of inflation. In addition to the pressure from
producers, cinema owners, international film companies and even the govern
ment, the main government security force (SAVAK) insisted upon the mainte
nance of low prices for reasons of its own.89
At the beginning of the 20th century the film became the entertainment for
86 Dash Aku/, screenplay and directing: Mascud Kimya3!. 87 Maghsoudlou, op. cit. 88 Tehranian, "Socio-economic and Communication Indicators", p. 70. 89 A percentage of the gross income was distributed according to the following formula: 20% was taken by the municipality; 40% was taken by the cinema owner; 40% by the film owner. If the film was imported and in a foreign language, the film owner was responsible for dubbing as well as distribution.

the upper classes. By the middle of the 1970s as Tehranian expresses it, "The
cinema has been increasingly reduced to the role of a lower class urban leisure
activity" . . . "There had been a heavy concentration inTehran (some 20%).
The number of cities with cinemas increased from 80 to 140 between 1968and
1975. Iran could claim about eleven cinema seats per 1,000 of population in 1975;
this fell, however, below the UNESCO standard of 20 seats."90
In 1976 the urban population of Iran was only 46.7% of the total popula
tion.91 Iranian cinema attracted 45 million spectators inTehran alone in 1975,
and 65 million inother cities ofIran. There isno doubt that among the n o
million viewers there was also a percentage of rural inhabitants visiting the
towns, but on the whole itappears that the majority of the rural population was
excluded from this popular entertainment.
It is rather unfortunate that the movies which were made bythe young
directors in the late 60s and 70s have not stirred the imagination of the general
public, since these films are mostly about the simple and ordinary people, likea
film bySuhrab Shahid Salis TabTat-i Bijan ("Still Life") (1974) in whichhe
portrayed the life of a railway-crossing keeper in a remote place, who after 30
years of service must retire without any security or care forhim; a sad and
impressive picture. Or like another film by the same director called Dar Ghurbat
("Far from Home") (1975 inGermany). This film deals with the alienation of
Asiatic workers from their native populations and culture, in the European
cities to which they have migrated for the higher wages which their families need
for abetter life at home. Shahid Salis is probably the best known director in the
West, with many prizes to his credit. He is now living in Berlin making films for
German producers. According to Ronald Holloway, "like Chekhov, Suhrab
Shahid Salis is not a social idealist, nor is heinterested in penetratingthe
mysteries of life to offer a ray of hope or understanding. His only weapon against
the exploitation of man (which he takes pretty much for granted) is the unveiling
of hypocrisy — and the Chaplinesque glee in doing so brings humour and satire,
irony and tragicomedy, to play whenever the chance is offered. This distinctly
Chekhovian quality inhis films makes them both simple and complex: he is a
silent observer oflife inits truest, most unadulterated light."92
It is only fitting that this exciting decade inthe Iranian cinema (1966-77)
should be closed by reference to Iranian women. In 1977Marva Nablli's feature
film Khak-i Sar ba Muhr ("The Sealed Soil") was proclaimed the "Most Out

standing Film of the Year" at the London Film Festival, and a year later at the
San Remo Film Festival Nablli received the "Best New Director Prize" for the
same film. Another Iranian woman, Meri Apik, received the "Best Actress"
prize for her role in Bunbast ("The Dead End") at the Moscow International
Film Festival. This is the clearest indication that the Iranian cinema had come a
long way, from the time women were excluded not only from acting but from
the audience as well, to the time they were winning international prizes for film
directing and acting. Andrew Sards, a leading film historian and critic, writes:
"Under the adverse conditions within which Iranian film-makers have had to
function, it is amazing that an Iranian cinema of any magnitude has come into
existence at all. Yet what is even more amazing is the evolution in the past few
decades of a genuinely critical and ironic cinema despite the repression of an
official censorship."93
Hamid Naficy, in a chapter called "Cinema as a Political Instrument" charges
that the film industry in Iran was at the service of the Pahlavi regime.94 This is an
exaggerated claim, as is visible from the same chapter, when the author
contradicts himself while analysing the themes in Iranian feature films. No
doubt, the censorship was sometimes extreme, but the main characteristics of
the Iranian cinema were not its subservient role to the government, or its useas
their tool. Rather, the main characteristic was commercialism. The film-makers
were primarily concerned with producing commercially viable films with broad
public appeal. In the last decade, the younger Iranian film-makers, who were in
most cases educated with government money, started to make films of a political
nature, and even fancied themselves as opposition film-makers. Their films, not
all of which were released immediately, were made with government money.
These films, however, did not have a wide appeal, and were popular only among
a selective audience. H. Naficy writes: "Infatuation with the West soon led to the
imitation and assimilation of its cultural products. The growth and development
of the Iranian film industry serves as prime example . . . ."95 Film is indeed a
western form, but Iranians knew how to adapt it to their culture and enrich it
with their artistic abilities, far better than many other peoples of Asia.
Despite the anti-western feeling in post-revolutionary Iran, the cinema
remains a major entertainment form for the people. Some cinemas have been
closed, and the films the Iranians see are rather selective, old, and third rate. The
scissors of the censors are the most active tools in the post-revolutionary Iranian
film industry. In addition to the heavy-handed politico-religious censorship, the
film-makers in Iran are urged by the government to impose on themselves a

" P A S T , PRESENT AND FUTURE"
THE HUMAN BRIDGE BETWEEN PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE
Parvl^ Sayyad
It isvery difficult topreserve tradition, beit inthe way oflife orofentertain
ment, when the nation isengulfed in"total modernization". Iran isnot the only
case of accelerated modernization where traditions have been dying rapidly.
Modernization need notwipe outtraditional morescompletely, provided that
there are institutions orindividuals ready towork for their preservation.The
harmony of the past andthe present in the field of entertainment in Iran is
illustrated byParviz Sayyad andhis family.
His grandfather was a Tacziya performer aswell asa charcoal burner and a
fisherman in the northern province ofGUan. His father, cIsa, was apoet known
by the pen name Mahbub All Shah. He composed epic poetry, acted in Tacziya
plays, and was amaster Naqqal (story-teller). His mother was also adaughter of
a Tacziya performer.
Parviz Sayyad was born inLahljan in 1937 where his father was engaged in
playing the role of All Akbar in a Tacziya drama. Hischildhood was spent
following his father about, after the death ofhis mother when he was two years
old. Inthis fashion he was immersed inTacziya, Naqqali, and gained familiarity
with Ruhauzl and other traditional entertainment. Parviz played children's roles
in Tacziya before going tohigh school in Tehran, where hewrote short stories
and his first play.
At the age of22 he received aprize for a play from the Office ofDramatic Art
in Tehran (1959). This opened the wayto a scholarship at theInstitute of
International Education in NewYork in 1962. After a year in America he
returned to Iran, entered business college, but continued with his theatrical
activities. While in America he had become convinced that the indigenous
Iranian theatrical modalities should bemaintained, thinking that they could be
successfully merged with modern forms.
For the opening ofthe newly built governmental theatre called Twenty-fifth
Shahrivarin 1965, heproduced andstaged Majmtta-yi Irani ("Iranian Collec
tion"). This was a medley oftraditional forms ofentertainment which was a
great success. This collection was also broadcast on radio andshown on
television. In 1967 he organized astorytelling festival inTehran. Afterwards, he
produced and staged aseries oftraditional Iranian performances fortelevision.
To theinauguration of the Shlraz Arts Festival in 1967 he brought the
Tacziya play oiHurr in which professional Tacziya actors and musicians from all

over the country participated. For subsequent Shiraz Festivals he produced two
other Tacziya plays.
The cross-breeding ofthe past andmodernity could beseen in Sayyad's
adaptation for the stage of a poem by awell-known Iranian poet and painter, M.
Yakta'i, called Fa/ Gush.
In 1968 Sayyad established atheatrical group which performed on various
stages, butmainly in television programmes. They played both classicaland
modern plays.
In 1975 hesucceeded in establishing his own theatre, The Little Theatre of
Tehran. Although this venture was notfinancially profitable, it was a fruitful
experience forthe actors and the audience inthat both contemporary western
and Iranian plays were performed. The influence ofTacziya and Ruhauzi and
other traditional forms was nevertheless clearly visible.
Between the years i960 and 1977, Sayyad produced or staged, directed,
filmed orplayed arole in, or wrote screenplays forsome 900 programmes for
Iranian television. He is well known among television viewers for the character
istic roles both of rural and urban heroes which he played.
One of the best examples of the crossbreeding oftradition with modernity is
the character of Samad whom Sayyad created and developed for many television
programmes and nine full-length feature films. Samad, the simple good-hearted
peasant patterned after Shull ofthe Ruhauzi tradition, became the beloved hero
of Iranian television and cinema audiences in the 1970s. Particularly outstanding
were twenty-one feature films for which Sayyad either wrote the screenplays,or
which hedirected or acted in,or produced. He also published three plays and
translated several plays into Persian. The Hurr Tacziya play was editedand
published byhim. Healso has articles inIranian literary journals.
Parvlz Sayyad has been inthe U.S.A. since the autumn of 1979. At a time
when western experimental drama is interested in"total theatre" and the re
investment ofwestern drama with ritual, it isto behoped that Sayyad, whois
now at theother endof the spectrum, may re-invigorate western theatrical
activity.

the 1930s, it was not until 1939 that short news broadcasts inPersian cameto
Iran from Turkey's Radio Ankara. Station Tehran Radio was inaugurated in
1940.
Subsequently Tehran Radio began to transmit in French, English, German,
Russian, Arabic and Turkish for foreign consumption, while short daily news
casts covered Iran, in addition to a variety of programmes for five hours a day. A
news blackout during the final months of Riza Shah's reign was finally broken
by his son, Muhammad Riza Shah, whose radio address spoke ofhis oath of
accession and appealed to the people forsupport on 25 August 1941. This
established aprecedent for the king to address his subjects annually at Nauruz
(New Year).
The country at large was introduced to abroadside of propaganda in World
War II. Thereafter, the radio network in Iran was in a period of rapid outreach.
By 1966 Radio Iran had installed 22 transmitters broadcasting 130 hours every
day. Twelve provincial radio stations relayed Tehran Radio Iran's news broad
casts, aswell asinitiating programmes oflocal or regional interest, often in
appropriate dialects orin Arabic, Turkish, Urdu, orPashtu. More powerful
stations than those originally constructed were subsequently built.100
Radio in Iran, always subject to dominant political groups, finally came
under thecontrol of the Ministry of Information in 1964, after previous
successive takeovers by other governmental agencies. Majid Tehranian says,
"During the political turmoils of the early fifties, radio was often used for
political mobilization both by the prime minister Mossaddeq and later by the
succeeding governments".101
In 1971 radio was joined with television in the organization called National
Iranian Radio and Television (NIRT).
The most outstanding radio advance occurred with the importation of cheap
battery-operated transistor sets. In the old days, the population received infor
mation from the government by means ofa man, called ajarchl^who would
travel from one district toanother and ina loud voice spread the news; this
action was known 2^jar %adan. The people had an entirely oral tradition so that
when the transistor radio was imported in huge quantities, it was readily
accepted. While illiteracy had been reduced, hearing was still more acceptable
than reading.
The programmes were often family oriented, being extensions of the educa
tional programmes ofthe Development Corps. Religious programmes, plays

and contests were offered, aswere very frequent musical events, both ancient
and modern. There was much emphasis on child development. The farmers and
the army also had special programmes. However, Amin Banani writes: "Aside
from music, radio has had a formidable effect upon popular culture, whereits
impetus has been toward the acceleration ofwesternization - and more specifi
cally Americanization - ofthe more superficial aspects ofthe life style in urban
society. Inthe late 1950s and early 1960s, a significant portion ofthe entertain
ment programmes of Radio Iran was made up of translations of American radio
detective series and "soap operas". Inthis area, however, television has already
surpassed the radio."102

According to Tehranian, "The AM radio network covers almost all of the

stations, inTehran and Abadan.106 Named TVI (Television Iran) this company
used American equipment and programmes dubbed into Persian. These were
westerns and quiz shows catering for an unsophisticated public.
A separate National Television Network (NITV) was established in 1966,
using the French system. These programmes appealed to the more educated
population.
TVI was finally nationalized in 1969. There were now two stations serving
various countrywide needs. This wasagovernment monopoly employing some
9,000 people by 1979.107
Television had fourteen production and transmission centres inthe region,
covering 70%of the country's population. There were even satellite broadcasts
of world events. Colour television was delayed forlocal technical reasons.108
An educational television station wasopened in 1973 covering about 75 % of
the intermediate schools. Programmes on Persian history andliterature, foreign
languages for primary and secondary schools, science, programmes for new
literatures, etc.were broadcast. "Among its most successful programs are series
that combine a visual, descriptive, and historical introduction of remotebut
significant areas inthe country; biographical sketches ofhistorical personages;
folkloric performances; Persian music; andWestern classical music. Itpresentsa
view of Iran that includes more of its essential variety and identity."109
In 1968 Amin Banani observed that television was a status symbol. "In
middle-class homes, the set isusually turned on as soon as guests arrive, and is
kept oneven during the serving of dinner. Children's addiction to the set is
complete; they constitute a large part ofthe audience ofthe American Forces
Television (AFTV)."110
With thespread of television, a traditional form of entertainment, called
Shahr-ifirang,popular for about acentury, disappeared almost totally. Children
were particularly attracted to this show, which consisted of a portablebox

In 1971, radio andtelevision merged into National Iranian Radio and Television (NIRT) - an independent government corporation. 108 "While the technical resources for introducing color television unquestionably existed earlier (the Asian Olympic Games of 1974 were broadcast in color), full color programming was delayed until 1978 in view of the domestic manufacturers' projected ability to fulfil theanticipated demand for color television sets."

containing either a stereoscope ora simple roll covered with scenes of foreign
landscapes andcities, which the storyteller would turn as he produced an
amusing running commentary in a high-pitched voice. The storytellerwas
usually the owner of the contraption, which he carried on his back from placeto
place. This was nota purely Iranian convention: other versions existed in
neighbouring countries. The Arabic word forit was sanduq al-dunya.
According tostatistics, in 1979 some four million households were covered
by television transmission though only about 1.7million people owned their
own television set.
In summary one may say that NIRT was the best functioning organizationin
Iran during the last decade. It wras a professional organization of broadcasters
trained both at home andabroad, andit operated smoothly under efficient
supervision. As Tehranian has said: "It enjoyed some measure of independence
from both the government and the security forces."112 More importantly, NIRT
was looked upon by the population as an organization with some integrity,
which was, however, lost when the secret police and the authorities began to
interfere in themid 1970s.
Moreover, NIRT, as a national broadcasting monopoly was in later years
considered "by the regime as a substitute forreal political communication".113
In turn, instead ofserving asa national cohesive element, pulling together
various ethnic and religious minorities and social classes, the NIRT inthe end
played adivisive role: "the TV portrayal of upper- and middle-class standards of
living must have augmented the sense of injustice, envy, and outrage felt by the

poor and the devout. . . . Entertainment programmes probably had an even
more disastrous impact. Both domestic productions andimports imposed the
cultural tastes of an urban elite, and their metropolitan preferences, upon a
premodern population that inevitably experienced strong feelings of impropri
ety."114 On the other hand, one should give credit to NIRT for excellent
programmes and serials in which traditional Iranian arts and modes oflife were
displayed in themost enterprising fashion, even towards theendof the 1970s.
The number ofart and culture festivals, research institutes and training facilities
founded, supported, and associated with NIRT is most impressive. They were:
1 Festival of Arts, Shlraz/Persepolis;
2 Festival of Arts, Tus/Mashhad;
3 Festival of Popular Tradition, Isfahan;
4 Centre for Folklore (Markaz-i Farhang-i Mardum);
5 Centre for the Preservation and Diffusion of Persian Classical Music;
6 Centre for Gathering of Persian Traditional Music;
7 Centre for Musical Training of Children and Young Adults;
8 Performance Workshop (Kargah-i Namayish);
9 Institute for Traditional Performance and Ritual;
10 Centre for the Study of Civilizations;
11 Centre for Film Culture;
12 Centre for "Free Cinema";
13 Iran Communication and Development Institute;
14 Soroush Press;
15 Tamasha^ weekly magazine.
These are the best proof ofNIRT's genuine commitment tothe preservation
and propagation ofIranian traditions inthe face ofmodernization; although it is
true that some ofthese centres played adouble role ofpreserving and mixing the
Iranian traditions with the current Western trends, experiments, and even
passing fashions.
To summarize this chapter, the modernization ofIran is well reflected in the
media and entertainment ofthe country. The inevitable consequence ofmodern
ization was westernization. This, in turn, was unavoidably associated with
urbanization, a strong central government and a definite trend toward secular
ization. Thespeed of westernization was such that thetraditional network of
communication and traditional entertainment lost inthe competition with their

ENTERTAINMENT, MEDIA AND SOCIAL CHANGE
modern western counterparts. Yet, when it looked asthough tradition was
about to be completely submerged, it rejuvenated itself and made some of the
imported modalities conform with it.
The interaction of the media and entertainment in recent Iran can be
subdivided into three parts. One is predominantly verbal, informal and tra
ditional. The second isthe state-controlled modern technological network of
communication and entertainment and its submission to censorship. The third is
modern technology in the service of both of the above categories. Verbal,
informal, and traditional media include: mosque, madrasa, Husamijja, Fatimijya,
takya, tac%iya, rau^ji-khwarii, dasta, pardadarl, haiat-i ma^habi, khaniqah,^urkhana^
qahvakhana,ruhau^l, naqqali,daura^ asnaf, and khaima-yi shab-ba^l. State-controlled
media include: radio, television, and the press. Technology in the service of both
the above categories includes: printing, duplication (xerox), cassettes and small
recordings, telephone, film, theatre, and sports.
The first two categories are self-explanatory. The third, however, shows the
plasticity of the social system's capacity to join traditional modes with moder
nity. For example, tape recording machines and cassettes were used to great
effect in preparing the way forthe 1979 revolution. The recorded voice of
Ayatullah Khumaini, or other leaders, had almost the same impact as ifit had
been delivered from amosque or in a Husainiyya. Duplicating machines were
used in order to spread revolutionary leaflets. The telephone had the same
function in that messages and sermons were dialled from the outside into Iran,
or from one Iranian location to another. These means of communication were
not interdicted as they would have been in the authoritarian countries of Eastern
Europe.
As to the film industry, some films shown in Iran emphasized the traditional
modalities whereas, per contra, others stressed alien values and morals. This
applies also to modern drama and theatre.
In the post-revolutionary period, the traditional network and the state
controlled mass communications were in a sense fused. This is not necessarily to
the advantage of the country, in that the politico-religious values now control
the whole state, including themedia, communications and entertainment
whether modern or traditional. The noted exceptions would be daura and
khaniqah inthe traditional category, and printing, duplication, cassettes, and
telephone in the mass communications category. However, the government
suppression of the use of these media by the forces of dissent is now greater than
ever before.

CHAPTER 22
PRINTING, THE PRESS AND LITERATURE IN
MODERN IRAN
In the Preface to the first volume of his Tankh-i Jam id va Majallat-i Iran
("History of the Press and Periodicals in Iran") Muhammad Sadr Hashimi
considers the proliferation of newspapers andperiodicals in Iran during the
Constitutional period to be the principal cause of the dearth of book and
monograph publication by scholars and creative writers inthe four decades that
followed. The lack ofsuch publications, which has certainly not been noticeable
since the 1960s sofaras non-fiction isconcerned, and isamply compensated for
in post-revolution Iran, was, hesays, unprecedented in times before the advent
of the newspaper and periodical. Insupport ofhis argument he cites one literary
scholar, Vahid Dastgirdi, who, as any student of Persian literature knows,
devoted hislife to its study, butproduced nota single book. Hepreferred to
confine himself to articles inArmaghan ("The Keepsake"), the literary journalhe
edited fortwenty-two years. Hence, according toSadr Hashimi, the need toturn
to newspapers, weeklies andmore infrequent periodicals, in order to read the
speculations andconclusions of researchers, as well as writers' expression of
their genius. Howephemeral many of these repositories of Iranian literary
output in the first forty years of the 20th century were, was proved when their
historian and cataloguer began hiswork. Hediscovered that of some no trace
could befound. There were instances when, after a lapse of several years,not
even former editors and publishers could remember anything about their
defunct enterprises.
News, akhbar, and happenings, vaqayf,inthe month ofMuharram A.H. 1253
(April to May 1837) in the"Abode of the Caliphate, Tehran" aregiven in the
Journalof the Royal Asiatic Society v (1839), pp. 35 5-71, in the transcription and
translation ofthe first issue ofwhat isconsidered the first Persian newspaper to
be published inIran. This transcription and translation are, inthe absence ofany
survival of the original, a memorial to thelithographed paper produced in the
reign of Muhammad Shah Qajar (1834—48) by Mirza Salih Shirazi, one of the
first group of Iranian students to be sent to Europe when cAbbas Mlrza

despatched them to England for technical andprofessional training. Salih
Shirazi used his spare time to learn about printing; aswill beseen below, he
returned with apress. The first issue ofhis paper came out inMay 1837. Other
issues appeared monthly, but only fora year ortwo. The precise date of their
cessation is not known, butby thetime theRussian Berezin,1 was in Iran
between 1842 and 1843, the paper was no more. Berezin found Mirza Salih
occupied as a controller ofbarats, bills ofpayment onstate revenues issuedby
the government to its creditors. He wasserving a Shah who gave little
encouragement to literature or cultural advancement. Hence thedemise of
Mirza Salih's newspaper, and, after it had produced a Qur^an with a Persian
translation between the lines, a commentary on the Qur^an and a Ta^jya-narna(a
book of the Passion of the Martyr Husain), also the closure of his printing press.
Owing to the paucity of information he was able to gather about this paper, Sadr
Hashimi refused itrecognition as the inauguration of an Iranian Press, which he
dates instead to Mirza TaqI Khan, the Amir-i Kablr's Vaqayf-i Ittifaqlya
("Current Events") in the reign of Nasir al-DIn Shah (1848-96).
The article inthe Journalof the Royal Asiatic Society describes the manner in
which the earlier paper appeared, lacking atitle but adorned with the Lion and
Sun Emblem ofIran. It consisted oftwo large folios lithographed on one side
only, and "closely written inaplain hand". The anonymous contributor ofthe
article explains that theexample was "given as a specimen of the political
advancement of the Persians, among whom aprinting press is of but very recent
introduction". Adamiyat comments on the lack of a title. He takes itas evidence
that Mirza Salih might have been unaware ofpioneering papers already pub
lished in other Muslim lands, the Vaqayf Misrlya published in 1828 in the Egypt
of Muhammad cAli (1805—48), and the first Turkish newspaper, the Taqvim-i
Vaqayf ("Calendar of Events"), which began in 183 2. The comment indicates the
supposition that Mirza Salih Shirazi bypassed developments in theOttoman
Empire and derived his inspiration directly from his English experience,
narrated in his Safar-nama("Travelogue"); in his Prospectus for the newspaper,
the Mirza referred to a kagha^-iakhbar, literally "newspaper". In this context the
word, anciently in use forannals of events, ru^nama^"daily record", didnot
come into use until later.
The Mirza's Kagha^-iakhbar opened with news of"Eastern Realms", begin
ning with events in Tehran. There is alengthy description of the visit to Tehran

of the Imam, Muhammad Mahdl, of Isfahan and his reception by the Shah,
whom theImam spoke of as protector of the Sharfa, buturged to beready to
sacrifice allin support of the "army ofIslam". News is given of tax remissions
and thesuppression of rebels. News of western countries, besides speaking of
the sumptuous entertainment given bythe British envoy onthe occasion ofhis
sovereign's birthday, quotes in detail a letter from New York describing the
launching ofa new paddle steamer. It would complete the voyage toLondon in
twelve days rather than a month, much to the relief of "merchants and persons
connected with commerce". Coupled with this information from the New
World, the Yankl Dunya,isnews ofa steam man-o-war's arrival inBombay and
its having stopped for bunkering atthe Cape ofGood Hope, situated at"the end
of the Maghrib", the"West", that is to say, of Africa: thegeography was not
quite accurate. Also reported is thefact that Mirza AllShirazI had at last been
paid two hundred tumans, then equalling one hundred pounds, for "translating
the New Testament with Henry Martyn" twenty-five years before. News from
Constantinople is extensive.
It is clear that, in addition to liberal propaganda for the throne, for a
venerated religious dignitary and for the throne's amicable and respectful
relations with him, Mirza Salih Shlrazi's aim was to introduce readers to the
outside world, itsgeography and especially the West's new inventions, suchas
the steamship. Indeed, in the Prospectus hehad published four months before
his first issue came out, hestated the need forIranians to beinformed of world
events aswell asofthe projection ofnew industries inIran itself, forexample, a
paper factory, asugar refinery, agunpowder works, and of"the encouragement
of artisans".2 Before proceeding further, however, it isnecessary toexplain why
in 1837—9, according tothe journal ofthe Royal Asiatic Society, the printing press
was still of "but very recent introduction" in Iran.
What was meant was printing in the Persian language, in theArabic script.
Armenians inJulfa had brought printing forbooks inArmenian toIran in1641
when an Armenian Lives of theFatherswas printed inJulfa by acertain Vardapet
Katchatur. AService Book appeared two years later and examples of both books
are extant.3 Moreover, this printing enterprise was with metal type, chap-i surbi,
not chap-isangl,lithography which, as will be seen, held the field for Persian
books during thenineteenth andearly twentieth centuries. Tavernier reports
that the Armenian press at Julfa was soon broken upbecause the printer could

not find good ink and "many persons [were] undone byit,who got their living
by writing".4 Carswell comments that Julfa wasimportant for manuscript
copying in the seventeenth century, but in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries theprinting of Armenian books wasresumed there.
As forprinting in Persian, Chardin says that in his time at Isfahan the desire
for printing was marked, as was realization ofthe need for it, yet nobody had set
up a press. The "Grand Maitre", whom, interestingly, Dihkhuda suggests
might have been thechief Mujtahid (Lughat-nama, under chap), commissioned
Chardin to import a press in 1676, the king having liked Arabic and Persian
printed texts Chardin had presented to him from Europe; butwhen it came to
assessing thecost thebusiness was dropped. Langles in a note to this part of
Chardin's narrative points out that the Carmelite Fathers had earlier established
an Arabic—Persian press, as had the Armenians theirs for Armenian;5 the
Carmelite Isfahan convent hadbeen founded by 1611. Langles disagrees with
the notion that thefailures of these early presses hadanything to do with the
dryness of the climate in Isfahan affecting the ink. Langles observes how
printing, begun in Constantinople in 1727, was halted there in 1732 by people
who were hostile to any form ofenlightenment. Thus hewas apparently of the
opinion that bigotry similarly played apart inthe failure topromote printing in
Safavid Iran. Armenian and Carmelite auspices would not, of course, do it much
good in a climate so fanatical that theworks of Jalal al-DIn Rum! were only
handled with tongs and those of Hafiz considered the vehicle ofkufr, unbelief;
but theconclusion must bethat the bigotry accorded well with theattitude of
calligraphers, who sawtheir livelihoods jeopardized.
A press was brought from Europe to Tabriz by Zain al- Abidln Tabriz!in
1817. Under theaegis of the Prince-Governor of Azarbaijan, Abbas Mirza, a
small printing house was opened. Then in 1819—20 Mirza Salih ShirazT returned
from England with a press which also began operating in Tabriz.6 In 1824—5
Zain al- Abidln was summoned to Tehran, where heopened a press underthe
patronage ofone ofthe most influential courtiers, Manuchihr Khan, later called
the Muctamad al-Daula. Shortly afterwards, in 1826, a history ofthe Qajars,the
Maasir-iSultantya by Abd al-Razzaq ibn Najaf Qull "Dunbuli", was printed in
typography (moveable type) in Tabriz. Atthe end ofthis work, which remains
an excellent specimen ofthe artoftypography, Dunbuli lists the benefits of the
governorship ofhis patron, Abbas Mirza, inTabriz, among them the importa

tion of European technology. He mentions foundries, surveying, artillery and
ordnance works, but also, "from all the wondrous processes, the operation of
printing", by which his Qajar history was produced by Abbas Mirza's
operatives under the supervision of "a master, the reverend Mulla Muhammad
Baqir Tabriz!, one of the notables of this province". The religious title of the
man responsible issignificant, and the combination ofthe religious with the
commercial classes in the production of modern Persian letters became a
commonplace. Also evident from the extended colophon cited here, is the zest
with which under Abbas Mirza the educated of Tabriz, and those shrewd
enough to encourage them, received European arts and techniques. Itwas not,
however, until the next reign, that of Muhammad Shah, had ended and Nasir al
Din Shah's begun, that a fresh attempt was made at importing western ideas and
technology. After Abbas MIrza's death in 1833, chap-isurblstopped in Tabriz, as
it did in Tehran after 1845.
Even in 1826, while typographical printing was respectable, lithographed
works were also being produced. In lithography, the skill of the calligrapher still
had scope to display itself, and it gained the upper hand. A certain Jacfar Khan of
Tabriz was sent to Moscow to learn lithography. He brought a lithograph press
to Tabriz in 1824 while, with encouragement from Mirza Salih Shirazi and at his
own considerable expense, a certain Mirza Asad-Allah of Shiraz was sent for the
same purpose to Saint Petersburg. He returned to establish a press in Tabriz that
survived until at least 1912, in partnership with the merchant family of MashhadI
Asad Aqa Basmachl("the printer").7
It is noteworthy that one of the first fruits of the fashion for lithography was a
Qur3an in the hand of "the celebrated calligrapher", Mirza Husain. Other works
included mathematical and astronomical compendia, almanacs, histories of
Peter the Great, Charles XII and Alexander the Great (translated on the orders
of Abbas Mirza); a geography of the world; a dictionary derived from the
Burhan-iQatf , a most important lexicon of Persian; the complete works of Sacdl,
the Shahnama of Firdausi, and other works of classical Persian literature.
Tarblyat, translated by Browne, expresses surprise at how rapidly typographical
printing gave way tolithographic. He says the former did not again become
current until after MuzafFar al-DIn Shah's enthronement in 1896. The chro
nology is significant. It coincides with events leading to the Constitutional
Movement of 1905—6, from which, as has been seen, Sadr Hashimi dated the
flood oflocal and quasi-national journals.

PRINTING, THE PRESS AND LITERATURE
The cultural geography ofthe Persian tongue does not stop at the Iranian
borders. Adamiyat avers that "the first Persian newspaper" was in fact pub
lished in India by Ram Mohan Roy (i772-183 3),8 whose services to Persian
letters included an edition ofthe Divan ofHafiz. No trace ofthe paper remains
although itis known that at least one issue was sent to Iran. A Mirza Muhammad
All Shirazi published another Persian newspaper called Ihsan al-Akhbar va
Tuhfat al-Akhyar ("The Best of News and the Gift of Blessings"). Issues reached
Iran from Calcutta in July 1851. Itwas so anti-British that Colonel Sheil wrote to
Lord Palmerston suggesting that, while he was ignorant of the Press regulations
in India, he would be happy if this paper's distribution in Iran could be
prevented.9 Another Persian journal, Rast Guftar ("Straight Speaking") was
begun in 1267/18 50—1 by a Parsi nationalist named Narojji, anda weekly,
Chapuk ("The Rapid"), had appeared in Bombay in 1846, while Browne
discusses evidence for Persian-language papers produced inIndia several years
before theAmir-i Kabir's news-sheet in Iran, in theentry forJam-i jamshid
("Jamshid's Cup") in Press and Poetry (p. 68).
No doubt some if not allof these publications were known to the Amir-i
Kabir. From the outset of his ministry toNasir al-Din Shah atthe beginning of
the latter's reign, in 1848—9, he had shown appreciation of the foreign Press as a
means of informing Iran of world affairs. He soon established adepartment for
the translation of selected items from foreign journals, which heread himself
and passed ontothe Shah. Included were papers from India and Istanbul. An
Englishman named Edward Burgess and Abd-Allah Tarjuma-navis, cAbdullah
"the Translation-writer", were the officials responsible forthis bureau.
They were also engaged on the Vaqayf-i Ittifaqlya newspaper, ofwhich the
first weekly number appeared in early February 1851. Itwas called the Ru^nama
yi Akhbar-i Dar al-Khallfa-ji Tibran, "The Journal of Events of the Abode of the
Ruler, Tehran"; the name was changed in thesecond issue. It remained the
Vaqayf-i Ittifaqlya until 1860—1. Then itbecame the Ru^nama-yi Daulat-i Atlya
yi Iran, "The Journal of the Exalted State of Iran", and began to carry
illustrations, portraits of eminent people. Later its title was shortened tosimply
"Government Gazette", and then "The Iran Journal", a title retained into the
twentieth century.
These name changes might be said in some wise to parallel language changes
that mark stages in the development of a country subject to shifts in outlook and
expectations. The wording ofthe earlier titles match a situation when Arabic

words and inflections wTere still the norm. With the wording, Ku^nama-ji Iran,
the Arabic element disappears. More rigorous experiments in rejecting Arabic in
favour of Persian words and derivations, of which Ahmad Kasravi (1890—1946)
was anotable exponent, are not in question atthis stage, but the beginnings of a
tendency that was tobecome marked inthe time ofRiza Shah (192 5-1941) are
evident. Since the 1979 revolution the tendency infavour of Persian words has
been somewhat reversed. Nevertheless, aswill be seen, a distinctive feature of
the task of modern Iranian writers has been the shaping of styles suitable for new
purposes and a fresh ethos, which included anationalist consciousness and the
need to assert Iran's position as anindependent world entity.
Increased contacts with foreign Powers in theearly 19th century set the
process in train. Officials in the Qajar bureaucracy, notably Mirza Abu^l-Qasim,
the Qa°im-Maqam (1779—183 5), son of Mirza cIsa of Farahan, the Mirza Buzurg,
began toadjust the idiom ofdiplomatic correspondence tomeet fresh require
ments. Readers of AbuDl-Qasim's prose do not find it by any means clear ofthe
flourishes of an older convention, nor is itcharacterized by any manifest attempt
to avoid Arabic vocabulary.10 Butwhat Qa°im-Maqam did achieve was a
natural, fluent style. It exemplified anescape from the entirely artificial and is
seen at its best in the letter to the Tsar of Russia apologizing for the murder of the
Russian envoy Griboedov in Tehran in 1829.11 Ineffecting this revolution in
Persian prose the Qa°im-Maqam showed himself possessed ofinstinctive liter
ary genius rather than just being another well schooled imitator of the conven
tions ofinshcf, the artof(official) composition. No doubt recollections of the
idiom of Farahan, whence his family came, also played their part, as is clear in his
private correspondence.12
Mirza Taqi Khan, theAmir-i Kabir, was Qa3im-Maqam's protege.The
Amir's lithographed newspaper adopted thestraightforward style whichac
corded with the aim repeatedly declared in early issues, that it was not to be
restricted to areadership comprising government officials, although these were
under compulsion to purchase and read it, but also intended forthe general
public. Conditions of its sale, emphatically for theprovinces as well as the
capital, were carefully advertised. Tarbiyat, edification, of the people was as

men's horizons. Minds had tobe opened tothe world beyond Iran. The Amir-i
Kabir's remarkably forward-reaching outlook can be authenticated from these
pronouncements.
A former Iranian consul inBaghdad, Hajji Mirza Jabbar, was the editor. His
assistants were the two officials from the translation bureau who have already
been mentioned. Ofthem, Burgess, whose brother Charles was also active in
Iran, had apparently arrived there on abusiness venture promoted by a Persian
Armenian known asSadiq Beg, a merchant and associate of Abbas Mirza.He
engaged Burgess in 1826—7. Burgess rapidly learnt Persian and became a
translator in Abbas Mirza's Tabriz, but heseems to have continued in trade
with his brother until hewent bankrupt. The Amir-i Kabir, while no doubt
anxious not to lose Edward Burgess's skills asa linguist, was at the same time
generous in keeping a man whose bankruptcy in Muhammad Shah's time had
not lacked elements of scandal sufficient to provoke correspondence between
Hajji Mirza Aghasi, the prime minister, and Britain, when Anglo-Persian
relations were strained.13
The desire on the part of men like Amir-i Kabir to cater for general
"edification", in order that Iranians of the new age might manage increased
contact with and pressure from foreigners, meant that the presence of certain
foreigners was considered anadvantage. Mirza Taqi Khan had himself visited
the Russian and, atErzerum, sojourned inthe Ottoman Empire, where he had
known European officers on theTurco-Iranian Frontier Commission which
culminated inthe Treaty ofErzerum in 1846, and on which he was the Iranian
representative. Robert Curzon testifies to the good impression Mirza Taqi Khan
gave.14 On his visit to Russia he hadsimilarly impressed Nicholas I, who
remembered him when they met again in Erivan. These experiences made the
Amir value aliens who could be useful, but whose presence aroused xenophobia
when there was reaction against ambition to reform. Such areaction, against the
Amir's wish to see Iran emulate what he regarded as superior western efficiency,
contributed tohis downfall. Lady Sheil reported how this first va^ir to Nasir al
Din Shah "had improved and increased the army, the finances were thriving,
and economy was the order of the day, tothe great increase of his own personal
enemies".15 He had, however, reduced the twenty-one year-old monarch, whom
he had accompanied from Tabriz to Tehran on hisaccession in 1848, "to a
cipher". He treated him as aschoolboy, itwas said, but was married to his sister.

She stood by him when he was dismissed in 1851. He in the end refused an offer
of asylum under British auspices,16 was kept under house-arrest at Kashan and
eventually murdered inJanuary 1852.
One ofthe declared aims ofhis newspaper was that it should explain and
verify the actions of the government in such a way that rumours and unfounded
assumptions might be obviated. In this context the word ^37/ was introduced
from the European "gazette". The fact that from i860 the paper gained the
adornment of illustrations was an innovation, due to the artistic talent of one of
the officials engaged on it, Hasan Khan, the Sanf al-Mulk and Naqqash-Bashi,
Artist in Ordinary.17
The Dar al-Funun, Polytechnic, was another monument to theAmir-i
Kabir's hopes. This college was established in the same year as the newspaper,
1851,and the two were closely linked. The State Printing Press was in the Dar al
Funun, in the curriculum of which pride of place went to modern science and
foreign languages, the latter with a view to building a trained cadre of diplomats.
European professors were enrolled. European works of literature and history
were translated, and officers from France, Austria, Italy and Germany compiled
military and mathematical manuals as well as scientific text-books and Persian
French phrase-books. Teachers in the Political Science department supervised
the production of Persian versions of Greek and Roman history, and studies of
economics and political systems. Riza Quli Khan Hidayat's supplement to
Mirkhwand's history, the Raui^atal-Safa, and his (not always reliable) antholo
gizing history of Persian poetry, the Majmac al-Fusaha, were prepared under the
Dar al-Funun's aegis. The "brief summary" given in Browne's Press and Poetry of
ModernPersia (pp. 157—66), listing publications ofthe Dar al-Funun, gives a
hundred and sixty-odd titles. Several are still valuable for the study of Persian
literature, history and biography. They recall the fact that the Dar al-Funun was
the predecessor ofthe first University, tobe inaugurated in 1934 in Tehran.
Obviously such an institution fundamentally influenced the minds and styles
of expression ofthe well-to-do young men fortunate enough to be enrolled
there. Through it, French became the second tongue of the educated, a position
it has lost since the Second World War. Yet, in spite of the Amir-i Kabir's hope
that his newspaper would enlighten all, including tribal khans, its scope, as also
enrolment in the Dar al-Funun, were inevitably restricted. Neither could reach
beyond a relatively small section ofthe population; how few they were, in
relation to avastly expanded population, was dramatically evinced when other

elements ofthe Iranian people were brought into action during the 1979
revolution. It then became clear how comparatively small the Europeanized
educated element still was, a fact that can be traced back to origins in the Dar al
Funun and its membership. At the same time the Dar al-Funun brought a new
type of Iranian into existence and changed the course of the development of the
country's cultural surface. Moreover, although much more recently imported
attitudes and expectations have obscured this, the Dar al-Funun produced a
cosmopolitan outlook in older scholars and writers, influenced by the examples
of European institutions and including radically new criteria by which the
Iranian could reassess his own cultural assets at the same time as he satisfied his
curiositv about those of other nations.
An American mission was sent among the Nestorian Christians in northwest
ern Iran in 1834.18 Anglicans were exploring the situation in the early 1840s.
E.G. Browne dates the flooding of the tide of missionary activity in the
Nestorian area round Urmrya to about 1856. The American and British were
followed by French Catholic and Russian Orthodox missionaries, "all of whom
. . . founded numerous religious institutions, such as colleges, hospitals, and
printing presses . . . The Americans in particular have for long possessed an
important printing press for the publication ofEnglish, Syrian and Persian
works".19 Certainly the gradual penetration of Christian missions in the second
half of the 19th century cannot be ignored in the context of increased Iranian
contact with the outlook of other cultures and language-groups; but any
appreciable impact of mission schools and colleges so far as Iranian intellectuals
were concerned was a later phenomenon. It was related tomore centrally
situated cities like Tehran and Isfahan, but also Tabriz and Kirman, and to the
1920s and 30s, the time of Riza Shah and, ironically, the eve of his nationaliz
ation of foreign missions' schools, which were partly nurseries for the new
Weltanschauung he favoured.
Muhammad Hasan Khan, the Ttimad al-Saltana, as Minister for Publications
began a lithographed, but later typographed, paper called Iran in 128 8/18 71. To
this single-worded title were added two significant sub-titles, Millatl, "Nation
al", and cIIm7, "Scientific". Muhammad Hasan Khan's own career illustrates
the extent towhich, since the Amlr-i Kabir's time, newspaper production,
besides its close association with the Dar al-Funun, had become a concern of the
Court. A graduate of the Dar al-Funun versed in foreign languages, Muhammad
Hasan Khan, whose own diaries are now in print,20 was the Shah's translator and

abstract-compiler of foreign news, to be read to the Shah while he lunched.
These services gained himseveral titles until he was made Ttimad al-Saltana,
"Pillar of the Sultanate", in 1881. The citation acknowledged that tothe
stewardship of this royal translator andhead of "the whole of Iran's printing
establishment" was due the fruitful progress ofthe imperial printing enterprise.
This enterprise had not ceased toproduce voluminous works onhistory and
geography. They belauded on their title pages the era ofNasir al-DIn and remain
monuments to the eagerness and industry of the time. In the Nama-ji
Danishvaran ("Record of the Learned"), they include a work of encyclopaedic
proportions, and demonstrate a consciousness of Iran's owncultural splen
dours.21 Many of these efforts were in theTtimad al~Saltana's name, but both
Browne andRiza-zada Shafaq22 make it plain that he probably wrote little of
them himself, while the editor ofhis diary gives areport that he was ignorant of
Arabic and Persian literature, but had read much ofthem inFrench translations
after being in France in theearly 1850s.23 Less highly-placed scholars acted as
amanuenses and compilers, which does not detract from the credit attaching to
this phase of literary effort.
It becomes clear, however, that once the Amlr-i Kablr had established the
Press and Daral-Funun, and been put to death the next year, the Shahand
subsequent advisers had been shrewd enough to ensure that credit forthe new
means of enlightenment wasassociated with the throne. Meanwhile men of
education and intelligence were furnished with aninnocuous but praiseworthy
means of employment. Sadr HashimI indicates how the Iran office was staffed.
Under Hasan Khan, whose title was then Sanic al-Daula, andwho was Court
Secretary, were Muhammad Husain Adib ("theCultured"), also known as
Furughl, "the Enlightened", whowas the paper's proof reader; MIrzaCA1I
Muhammad, the office manager; MIrza Abu3l-Qasim, clerk; MIrza cAbd al
Rahim, writer; MIrza cAbbas, illustrator and in charge of printing; andMIrza
Aqa Sayyid Vail, compositor of European and Persian types. There were other
writers and contributors permanently on the books, and the print-shop workers,
eight messengers, a MIrza Muhammad Riza, translator from French, and MIrza
CA1I Khan, translator from French and English, and Colonel MIrza cIsa Khan,
another French translator, and the Christian, Marius Khan, who translated from
French and Russian. Several of these mendoubled on the staff of the paper

involved in practically all earlier newspaper ventures, in thecapital or the
provinces. It appears that occupations were found in journalism andbook
compilation for men who might otherwise have had nothing to fall back on but
being active members ofthe religious classes. The step from the clerical tothe
clerkly sphere was not awide one; but in this instance those who took it became
the progenitors, metaphorically and literally, of a new class of literatiand
scholars. Their descendants, as the reference above to Muhammad Husain
Furughi recalls, lived until recent times and continued tocontribute toletters,
often to a celebrated degree.
As has been observed, reading the Ittifaqlya was obligatory for government
officials. In issue 51 of this weekly,24 on 23January 1852, thirteen or so days after
the Amir-i Kablr's death, anotice from issue 42 was repeated toaffirm that the
paper should be regarded as the official vehicle of government orders. Govern
ment agents, governors, officials, superintendents, khans, eminent persons in
cities, districts and provinces must, therefore, purchase and peruse it. Mer
chants, traders and communal representatives might take the paper voluntarily.
The names of those who did would beregistered forreceipt of it. Failure to
comply with this notice would be visited on the heads of Governors, who were
to be responsible for the paper's distribution and the collection of its
"'abonnemenf at the end of each year.
In May 1867 Nasir al-DIn Shah gave the Minister ofFinance, Mustaufi al
Mamalik, instructions about subscribers' registration for "the four newspa
pers", termed ru%namajat-idaulati, "government newspapers", and published by
the government. A separate dastkhatt, rescript, laid down regulations.The
instructions referred tothe publication of decisions on current affairs as wellas
home and foreign news; but also, "research into the lives and works of ancient
and modern poets, and a parcel oftopics freely written".25 No one was to be
exempted from the obligation to take "state, millafi (here "communal") and
learned journals". The Minister of Sciences, cAli Quli Mirza, theTtizad al
Saltana, was responsible for thedistribution of the requisite number of the
papers in the provinces.
These publications included the Ku^nama-yi cIlml-yi Daulat-i y\llya-yi Iran
("The Scientific Journal of the Exalted State of Iran"), begun as a weekly,
although it appeared irregularly, inJanuary 1868. There isan example toshow
that itgave Arabic as well as Persian material, and published an article on prose
verse, referring this style's invention to AbuDl-cAli al-Macarri (d. 449/1058).26

Scholarly research into literary matters seems to have become a legitimate
branch of learning in an Iran which was gaining awareness of western efforts and
methods applied toits own major asset ina great literature.
Of the eleven hundred registered recipients of newspapers and journals, two
hundred andeighty in the capital comprised the majority. Secondwas
Azarbaijan, with one hundred and sixty-six, which betokens the cultural and
educational zeal ofthe Iranian northwestern province that has been termed
Iran's window on the West. Another northern province with trading connec
tions across the frontier was Khurasan, which, after the Russians had pacified
the trans-frontier area and begun railway construction through itin the 1880s,
communicated with Azarbaijan by the Caspian—Caucasus route in preference to
caravan travel through Tehran to Tabriz. Khurasan registered eighty news
paper-takers. Fars and Kirman, in the south, enjoyed close commercial relations
with British India; they registered sixty-six and eight respectively. Sadr Hashimi
(vol. i,p. 6) praises the excellence of newspaper production in Nasir al-DIn and
MuzafTar al-DIn Shah's time as much as he deplores its later decline.
He dates the liberation of the Press from state control and the issue of "free
newspapers" by private individuals, to MuzafTar al-DIn Shah's reign (1896
1907). More precisely, to Muhammad Husain Isfahan!, Zaka° al-Mulk's publica
tion of Tarbiyat,a weekly "lithographed in very fine nastaQllq'm Tehran A.H. I 314
[ =A.D. 1896-7]".27 This man has already been alluded to and assumed the pen
name Furughi — it later served as asurname for his family — by grace of Nasir al
DIn Shah. Muhammad Husain had been taken up by the Ttimad al-Saltana after
an adventurous early life which had embraced trading, contacts in western Iran
with Sufi brotherhoods, and extensive travel in southern Iran. He was born in
125 5/1839 and died in 1909. In 1308/1890—1 he became head of the government
Press. He also taught in the Dar al-Funun's department of political science, and
he worked on the newspapers Sharaf("Honour") (1882) and Iran (1871), which
he superintended until 1882. He became Zaka° al-Mulk, The Light of the Realm,
in 1894.
Furughi, both by his distinctive style and publishing many of his own poems
in it, conferred on Tarbiyat a literary importance which, in the opinion of some,
was marred by flattery of notables.28 Although Sadr Hashimi makes this
publication signal the advent ofa "free Press", he is at pains toexplain the
restrictions still affecting publications other than the government's. In 1871 the
Ministry of Sciences lost control of newspapers to a Press Ministry, the Vi^arat-i

Intibcfat. This Ministry recommended to the Sadr-i Aczam, Prime Minister,
which journals should be licensed topublish. One example ofa paper which
encountered problems was al-Islam, produced by Sayyid Muhammad All, the
Daci al-Islam ("Propagator of Islam"). His al-Islam was later changed to
Guftagani-yi Safa-khana-yi Isfahan, "Some Discourses of the House of Purity of
Isfahan". It was suspended by the authorities for five months in 1903; but in
keeping with a practice tobe noticed inmore recent days, its proprietor had
recourse to another of his publications, in thesafety of Bombay, called the Dacvat
al-Islam, "Islam's Call".
Topics tobe published were subject toinspection by officials ofthe Press
Ministry andtheir provincial representatives. Under theprime ministers, Mirza
CA1I Asghar Khan the Amin al-Sultan, later Atabak-i Aczam, and the cAin al
Daula, between 1903and 1906,restrictions on the Press were increased. This
was the period when Sayyid Muhammad All fell foul of the government. His
paper was devoted only to religious topics, but itwas the Ain al-Dauia whom
Sayyid Jamal al-Din Asadabadi (seep. 193) described, in a famous letter of 1891
to Mirza Hasan of Shiraz, the Chief Mujtahid of the time andat Samarra in Iraq,
as "awicked freethinker".29 Nevertheless, Sadr Hashimi considers the appel
lation "free newspaper" appropriate for papers issued in the reign of Muzaffar
al-Din Shah when, as he says, "Zaka° al-Mulk wasthe first to make the style of
the newspaper in Iran other than that dry and spiritless one of government
Court journals".
In addition to thecontrols referred to above, censorship wasfirst introduced
in Nasir al-Din Shah's time when he became incensed over a verse satire
published in Bombay. The author was aShaikh Hasan-i Shlrazi, who ridiculed
the aspirants tolearning patronized by the Court. The Shah demanded of the
Ttimad al-Saltana howsuch pernicious attacks printed abroad andcritical of his
regime might be stopped entering Iran. The Ttimad al-Saltana explained how
European states had an arrangement called Sansur, "Censor". The Shah com
manded the establishment of such asystem so that "henceforth the way of this
vice might be blocked and the thread ofthis traffic broken".30
While still Crown Prince and governor ofAzarbaijan, in 1879Muzaffar al
Dln Shah had himself shown an interest in promoting the Press by being
instrumental in having aweekly called Tabrl^ produced. In 1872Fars appeared
in Shiraz while seven years later the Prince-Governor of Isfahan, Mascud Mirza,
the Zill al-Sultan, had instituted publication in that city, ofa journal called

Farhang ("Culture"). It was under the direction of a polymath said to be
acquainted with European sciences aswell asthose ofIslam. This Mirza TaqI
Khan Kashanl was a writer celebrated for clarity of expression. Hewasthe
author of treatises on natural science and astronomy.
These events marked the beginnings of a provincial Press, although, as might
be expected, Tabriz had blazed the trail as early as1859, for which year a paper
there called Kut^nama-ji Millatl ("The National Journal") is mentioned by
Aryanpur.31 An innovation early in the new reign was the appearance of the first
daily paper, Khulasat al-Havadis ("News Summary") in October 1898, soon after
Muzaffar al-Dm's accession. Itwas adigest of world news received in telegrams
destined for India from Reuters in London and furnished by the British
Legation mTehran. The Khulasatwas agovernment sheet and as such bore the
Lion and Sun emblem, but it was the brain-child ofMuhammad Baqir Khan.
The latter had succeeded his uncle on the latter's death, just before Nasir al-DIn
Shah's assassination in the spring of1896, both as head of the Press Ministry and
in the title of Ttimad al-Saltana. The paper survived until December 1903.
The pretexts for censorship, to inhibit publication of material harmful to
infants and also contrary to religious law, were set out in issue number 5 5 2 of 22
December 1863, ofthe Daulat-i "Allya-yi Iran newspaper. This item, probably
written by the Ttimad al-Saltana himself, is of interest because itrefers more than
once not only to readers, khwanandagan, but to listeners, shinavandagan, and
because itcan be compared for its style to an official announcement on the same
sort oftheme inthe Iran of 1 March 1901, which might have been by Zaka° al
Mulk FurughL The reference tolisteners issignificant because, while it would
be legitimate to ask how newspapers might have such adangerous influence ina
land where themajority of people were illiterate, features of that land were
declamation, song, recitation and reading aloud. These were the natural con
comitants of widespread illiteracy and more than apalliative to alack of literacy
which was not necessarily regarded as disastrous orunnatural. It was probably
one reason why illiteracy forall but a few persisted; the popularity of poetry,
which has permeated Iranian society in a manner characteristic of few others, can
also be related to widespread illiteracy. The power of the spoken word remained
sufficiently influential, when credited, forAyatullah Khumaini's use ofexhort
atory cassettes when he was in exile in the period leading upto 1979, to be
important in mobilizing the crowds who made the Iranian Revolution.

schools after increased contact with Europe inthe last half of the reign ofFath
cAli Shah (reigned 1797—1834).32 The conservatives wished toadhere to the old
style ofwriting. The new school sought toeschew prolixity, Arabic synonyms
for Persian words, and redundancies. Nasir al-DIn Shah himself espoused the
new style in thetravel diaries published after his journeys to Karbalaand
Europe. When that of the visit to Karbala was lithographed in 1874,the
secretary responsible for preparing the manuscript for publication wrote a
preface, inthe old style, inwhich, lest it should be supposed that the Shah was
incapable of anything better, he explained that the Shah had restricted himself to
straightforward descriptions in a laconic style "amenable to plebian
understanding".33
Of the two official announcements about the need to avoid publication of
things harmful to morality and the state, the first, of 1863, is written in a not
excessively "conservative" style but ina good blending ofthe somewhat old
fashioned style with the directness originally aimed forbythe Qa°im-Maqam
Farahanl. The 1901 proclamation differs from that of 1863 chiefly inthe choice
of vocabulary. Oddly enough it still shows the redundancies of the older piece,
but the words chosen are simpler and this is where the evidence lies for its being
more modern than the piece of thirty-eight years earlier. But a factor to be
noticed isthat the second piece isaltogether less reflective ortentative than the
first. It isaimed atimported newspapers inPersian produced outside Iran, the
government ofwhich they severely took to task forthe "lack ofsecurity, the
tyranny, lawlessness, ruin, poverty and ignorance" ofthe country, and it was
issued under the prime-ministership ofMirza cAli Asghar Khan, the Amin al
Sultan, later the Atabak-i Aczam.
The words quoted above come from Bahar's extracts from the notebooks of a
man very different from theAtabak. Hewas Mirza cAli Khan, the Amin al
Daula, who lasted hardly ayear as Muzaffar al-DIn's first prime minister. He was
a liberal and a reformer, encouraged the Press, and was innovative both in the
style of hand-writing and simplifying of expression, as exemplified by his
Safarnama-yi Bait-Allah, ("Record of a Journey to the House of God"), record
ing hisMeccan voyage.34 Hewas replaced as prime minister by Mirza cAli
Asghar Khan in 1899. In 1901 Mirza CA1I Asghar proscribed Persian journals

editors. He simply confiscated the imported papers his minions could discover,
but when Sultan cAbd al-Majid Mlrza, the cAin al-Daula (whose title, Mirza,
came after and not in front of his name, for he was aroyal prince, agrandson of
Fath CA1T Shah), assumed office in 1904, the movement demanding a Constitu
tion, mashruta, was growing. It was met head-on by the cAin al-Daula's
dictactorial policy. Meanwhile the nation atlarge was easily tutored into the
belief that he was responsible for the raising of foreign loans. His dismissalin
August 1906 was one of the Constitutionalists' requirements. His treatment of
the Press was as high-handed as doubtless he considered the situation called for:
distinguished editors and proprietors were maltreated and exiled to remote
coasts and mountain strongholds. He died a natural death in 1926.
The papers printed outside Iran were important enough in both the develop
ment ofjournalism within it and in the fostering of the Constitutional Move
ment of1906, to deserve special comment. Irshad ("Guidance") was a Turkish
daily printed in Baku. Adib al-Mamalik had founded two papers under the title,
Adah ("Civility") in Tabriz and Mashhad. That from Tabriz was moved to
Tehran in 1904, but from 1905 Adib al-Mamalik joined Irshad's editor, Ahmad
Beg AghayorT Qarabaghi, in Baku and began to contribute aPersian language
supplement to Irshad.
Akhtar ("The Star") was the first "modern style" Persian paper printed
abroad. It was promoted originally by an Iranian official in Istanbul, the Tabrlzl,
Mlrza Najaf-qulT Khan.35 Its editor was Muhammad Tahir, but according to
Sadr Hashimi, it was mostly written byMlrza Mahdl of Tabriz, son of a
merchant ofthe same city, Hajji Ibrahim, so that once more the social back
ground and urban ethos of these workers in journalism becomes evident. The
paper lasted from 1875 until its suspension by the Turkish authorities some
twenty years later. Itwas so highly regarded in so wide an area that newspaper
sellers came to be nicknamed "Akhtar".36 The Persian original of Browne's
Pressand Poetry in Modern Iran records that the "light of civilisation shone from
its pages". Ordinary folk inthe Caucasus and elsewhere called the educated
Akhtari-Ma^hab, the "Akhtarite Sect", as if it were, asina sense it was, the
harbinger of a new religious doctrine. Discussion groups based their debates on
its latest words. It was particularly influential among Iranian exiles, a category of
Iranian with which the world has become, not least in the 1980s, familiar. Itis a
category that has shown itself too eager to publish journals and pamphlets,
periodicals and manifestos, for any survey of modern literary output to ignore it.

PRINTING, THE PRESS AND LITERATURE
However adverse their circumstances may be, Iranians never lose sight of the
great asset they have in their language, and are ever adept in putting itto use.
Among Akhtar's contributors, in addition to itslater editor, Hajjl Mirza
Ahmad ofTabriz, were Mirza Aqa Khan and Shaikh Ahmad-i Ruhi, both of
Kirman. This latter was a correspondent ofE.G. Browne and must be men
tioned again in the context of the translation of Morier's Hajjl Baba ofIsfahan.
Both men were executed in Tabriz in 1897. Two of those engaged on Akhtar
later edited Surayya ("The Pleiades"), Parvarish ("Education") and Hikmat
("Wisdom") in Egypt. Akhtar began as adaily, then itbecame atwice weekly
and finally a weekly publication. Instyle, Persian words and derivations were
preferred to Arabic, but the latter were used when helpful for the sake of clarity.
Repetitive synonyms, afeature of the old style, were avoided and an element of
terseness prevailed, but not to such an extent as to mar either the attractiveness
or message of what was communicated. It should, however, be observed that
this laconic tendency, besides being in marked contrast to what critics abhorred
in the older conventions of Persian prose, no doubt owed much to the fact that a
number of items inAkhtar were taken from foreign, mostly London, papers.
Based ontelegraphic reports, this system of news-gathering resulted in the
shaping of a succinct Persian, adevelopment in which the telegraph obviously
played a part. There is copious evidence for the skill in translation from
European languages those employed on Akhtar generated. They seem to have
worked as ateam to such adegree that, as will be seen below, confusion could
arise over who translated what.
Issues of Mirza Malkum Khan's Qanun ("Law") generally bore no date, but
the first appeared in London on21 February 1890. Itsstyle is exhortatory,
rhetorical and often Arabicized, as ifthe better to reach the religious fraternity
by using their familiar idiom. E.G. Browne gives some originals, with transla
tions, of its sometimes vituperative political asseverations in his ThePersian
devolution, 190j—1909 (pp. 35—42).Qanun ran to forty-two monthly issues. Itwas
rigorously banned in Iran but, even though they suffered ifcaught with them,
people obtained copies. Itsmajor theme was Iran's need forimpartial and
competent administration of justice,cadalat^ which was reflected in the Constitu
tionalists' initial call for an cAdalatkhanayHouse of Justice. Ultimately came the
call for a representative assembly. After the latter came into existence, Qanun, of
which copies had become scarce, was in 1908 reprinted, adecade or so after its
publication had ceased with the forty-second issue in 1898.37

Surayya was published from October 1898toOctober 1900inEgypt, aswas
the weekly Parvarish, from June 1900until March 1901. The latter's quality was
enhanced bythe writing of Mirza CA1IMuhammad Khan KashanI (d. 1903).
llikmat, published in Cairo, was edited by Kashani's former colleague on
Akhtary Mahdl Tabriz!, the Zaclm al-Daula. It was published every ten days.
MIrza Mahdl later visited Tehran, where he waspraised by the Atabak-i-Aczam,
in 1899. Soon after MuzafTar al-DIn's accession and some six years after the
founding of Hikmat he was gazetted (in Iran) in November 1901 asZd~im al
Daula, "Spokesman of the State", for services abroad to "the State and the
Faith". Ahmad Kasravi later remarked that neither this honour nor a state
pension of three hundred tumans ayear diverted him, "so far as we know, from
the Path".38
This episode, and the Ain al-Daula's raising of the ban on another Persian
language publication from Egypt, Chihra-numa ("Face Revealer"), which began
in April 1904 and was forbidden entry into Iran the same year, indicate that
Iranian ministers were not above attempting tomollify their critics, oratleast
bending to persuasion that aprohibited paper was not in fact obnoxious. MIrza
Hasan "Rushdiya", the educational reformer, succeeded in influencing the Ain
al-Daula in this respect, although thelatter would certainly have political
motives of his ownfor anyfeints he might try with organs of the Press. Yetofthe
Chihra-numa he wrote in September 1907 that he was satisfied that no impedi
ment should beput onitsdistribution in Iran since "the more the means of
knowledge and understanding are spread, the greater will be their yield for the
State and the people".39 In such anobservation the influence of Rushdiya is
apparent.
The Qur°an, Chapter III, verses 98 and 108, enjoins taking refuge in the bond
of Allah, bihablillah^ and men not bound in abond from Allah and abond from
the people, hablin min Allah wahablin minal-nas, are threatened with degradation.
The Hablal-Matln, "Firm Bond", — the idea is co-operation through unity - was
probably the most important and most enduring of the papers of the Constitu
tional period. The first number, lithographed, appeared on 19December 1893 in
Calcutta under the control ofSayyid Jalal al-DIn al-Husainl, Mu'ayyid al-Islam.
It was still inproduction in 1912,but in 1905 had gone over tometal type. It
carried a supplement devoted entirely to religious topics. Its appeal went beyond
the nascent lay intelligentsia to the religious classes, as if to portend the
combination of concerns and outlooks which is afeature of Iranian protest and

reformative impulses. All Asghar Khan, the Amln al-Sultan, prohibited its
importation into Iran in 1901, but it was still read, and published a takfir-nama, a
declaration that All Asghar Khan was a kafir (unbeliever), which the Shlci
authorities in Najaf had endorsed. Itwas very active during the Constitution's
first setback between 1908 and 1911, the period ofthe Istibdad-i saghlr, "The
Lesser Despotism", when Muhammad All Shah reinstated autocracy. The Habl
al-Matln urged the zulama to action on behalf of democracy. As did the Persian
presses in Istanbul, Cairo and Alexandria, the Calcutta Habl al-Matln press
produced books as well as the newspaper and various periodicals. These
activities included journals in English and Urdu.40
Ahmad Kasravi says that one of the ways in which the Habl al-Matlrfs
influence was spread (it went to religious teachers in Najaf and other Seminary
centres free), was through the bounty of Hajjl Zain al- Abidin TaqiyofT. He had
already munificently supported the pre-revolution movement to bring edu
cation to Iranian towns and cities. He provided money and teaching materials
for the establishment ofsecondary schools, with which Mirza All Khan, the
Amln al-Daula, and especially Hajjl Mirza Hasan Rushdiya of Tabriz were
associated; the latter also edited two newspapers. The first ofthese dabistans,
schools, was opened by Rushdiya in Tabriz in 1896. Shaikh Hasan Maqami
urged the faithful to read the Habl al-Matln and so gave it the blessing of the
Marjac-i Taqlld, the supreme religious exemplar of the time. Although he reports
that the Habl al-Matin was constantly in debt, Sadr Hashimi repeats the informa
tion that each week five thousand copies of the paper went free to members of
the religious classes, out of a total of thirty-five thousand printed, which will be
seen to be a large number even by comparison with circulation figures for the
Iranian Press in more modern times.41 Among solutions this paper offered for
the evils it criticized was Constitutional government and government according
to the Law ofthe Faith, Hukumat-i Mashruta and Mushrtta.A1
It is said that Mu3ayyid al-Islam, Jalal al-DIn al-Husainl, wrote most of the
Habl al-Matln himself. Assuming that this means the political and religious
articles, it also means that this scion ofhigh-ranking religious authoritieson
both the paternal and maternal side was immensely influential. Copies ofhis
paper went to Persian-speakers throughout the Islamic world and, in Urdu,to
the Muslims of the sub-continent. After his death in 1929 inCalcutta, he was
buried at Mashhad with the reverential obsequies considered the due of a man
who had conspicuously served theConstitutional cause. Hewas born in

December 1863 in Kashan, of a line of culama and mujtahids. The respect so many
later accorded him was not, it must be said, subscribed to by Ahmad Kasravl. He
describes him as a time-serving opportunist.43 His allegation that HabIaI-Matin's
editor was ready to publish flattery of men in power might be an indication of al
Husaini's preference for conciliation, ashtl, seen by prudent and properly pious
Iranians as avirtue to be pursued instead of vindictiveness, and, at the outset of
his paper,Qanun, also urged by Mirza Malkum Khan. Neither man was short on
invective against those powerful personalities they conceived to be implacably
opposed to their principles. Iranparast's biographical note on the MuDayyid al
Islam in the magazine Armaghan^ would not have Ahmad Kasravi's peculiarly
anti-clerical bias, and was written by aclose associate of its subject. Itmight err
towards flattery, but it attests to the Sayyid's asceticism and simple life, in
harmony with the sacrifices he made for the sake of the aspirations he professed
to serve.
Comment on the life of the proprietor and chief composer of Hablal-Matin is
not out of place: it holds before the glass of posterity the type of Iranian engaged
in writing in order to promote what has been called Iran's Awakening.
Iranparast, the son ofthe Dacl al-Islam already mentioned (p. 828), provides
useful details of al-Husaini's foreign and domestic travel, allover Iran and
outside it, in Singapore, Oman, Mesopotamia, and of times spent with a variety
of important teachers before settlement, first in Bombay in 1890— 1, and finally
Calcutta. There the Sayyid began in commerce. He was obviously aman of the
world as well as one versed in the religious life, but there is evidence that he was
no bigot. Iranparast interestingly suggests that Habl al-Matin's, appearance some
three years after Qanutfs may berelated to the earlier publishing event.He
speaks of Jamal al-DIn Asadabadi and Mirza Malkum Khan as having been in
correspondence with Mu^ayyid al-Islam, and of how they together concluded
that the "revolution inthinking ofwhich Iran stood inpoignant need could
come about only under the auspices of the Press". Hamid Algar shows evidence
that, inhis turn, the publisher of Qanun was influenced by the Turkish Press,
especially Hiirriyat ("Freedom"), to which, in August 1869, Malkum Khan sent
an important letter urging reform of the Arabic script, which he saw as a barrier
to the clearing away of ignorance. This script was, he implied, a bastion
defended by the religious authorities, the culama, whom he blamed for persisting
in "a state of ignorance and absolute rejection ofEuropean science and prog
ress", so that the Islamic Faith was heading for destruction.45 Algar points out

that the Turkish paper Hiirriyat "was explicitly an organ of opposition in exile",
first produced inLondon, later Geneva, and ofa pattern adopted for Habl al
Mattn\ predecessor, Qanun.A6 Whatever Malkum Khan's and Sayyid Jalal al
Husaini's sources of inspiration were, they relentlessly used their papers to
prepare their compatriots' minds for change. InLondon and Calcutta, and on
their travels, they saw evidence of the challenge which made the need for change
in the Islamic world seem so urgent.
Papers also called Hablal-Matin appeared in Tehran, edited by Sayyid JalaTs
brother, Hasan-i Kashani, from the year 1907, and, likewise under Sayyid
Hasan's control, in Rasht in 1909, when he had been inexile inthe Caucasus
during the first year of the Lesser Autocracy. As for the style of Habl al-Matln,
Iranparast remarks that Sayyid JalaTs formal education had mainly been in
theological and juridical studies, thetraditional education of the religious
classes. He was also acquainted with mathematics, but far less with poetry and
letters. Hence hewrote anidiosyncratic style inwhich rather out-of-the-way
metaphors, similes and allusions occurred, but which was free from literary
flourishes. As much as tothe writer's educational background, these stylistic
characteristics might be attributed to his sense of urgency and having a definite
message to deliver. The articles read with what can bedescribed asa fluent
toughness arising from a clear mind, from which a sense ofhumour, a lively
sense ofthe ridiculous, isnot as conspicuously absent as, for example, in the
composition oiQanun. There is mockery, but itis too intelligent to be, perhaps,
as bitter and waspish asthe serious Kasravi might have expected.
Besides being humorous, the Sayyid was practical. He wrote, in September
1910, on the desirability of theoretical and practical teaching and training being
combined in educational programmes, and hetook Japan ashis model:
National educational enterprises' ultimate reason being to know rights and to obviate dependence on foreigners, whenever the Iranians imitate the Japanese in the principles of general education, benefits will follow. In Japan's public schools, the teaching of theoretical and technical subjects have been twinned. One stream of their educational process is in practical techniques. Each of their Primary Schools isequipped for one ortwo manufacturing operations, towhich the pupils are obliged todevote themselves for a time each day. No individual among the Japanese people isincapable of doing a job: whether he would or not, he knows a few technical processes. Thus in time of need he might at least earn a livelihood . ..

Here, in the original, phrases like dast-shikasta, "shiftless; unable to do ajob",
more colloquial than literary, are frequently used throughout the paper's issues,
as are popular adages. The plain and often popular style ofHabla I-Matin helped
to open the way forliterary developments to bediscussed below.
The first Iranian Parliament, Majlis-i Shura-yi Mi I11, National Consultative
Assembly, Majlis for short, was opened on 7 October 1906. By December a
newspaper appeared, to report its proceedings and called Majlis. This paper
marked an innovation. Inkeeping with the sense of liberation conferred by the
winning ofa Constitution (5 August 1906), the paper's founders, Muhammad
Sadiq and Aqa Mirza Muhsin Tabataba°i the Mujtahid, both sons of the fighter
for the Constitution, Aqa Sayyid Muhammad Tabataba°i, obtained a rescript
from Muzaffar al-DIn Shah which confirmed that the Majlis was afree paper, not
subject to the Ministry of the Press or any state control. This rescript was the first
imtiya^-namaor licence officially granted to persons wishing to publish ajournal
not a government gazette. To have theword at(ad,"free", included in this
document was a victory forthe deputies in the first Parliament.
At first, however, with the Majlis quickly followed bythe weekly, Nida-yi
Vatan ("The Call of the Homeland"), under Majd al-Islam of Kirman, and Sur-i
Israfil ("The Trumpet Call of Israfil"47), and with theincrease in provincial
papers in 1907, the Ministry ofthe Press, reigned over by Ttimad al-Saltana's
successors, was slow to adjust to the new situation. This new situation meant, as
the radical Sur-i Israfilput it, that the authors of a book or article need no longer
"leave off work for several days and start running about, going to the door of the
office ofthe Head of the Press Department orhis deputy, and his clerk, and the
registrar and the office messenger-boy, tomouth athousand flatteries and hand
over two rials in cash and two copies of the work inquestion, for its margins to
receive the impress of a seal and a signature".
For publishing this Mirza Jahangir Khan ShlrazI was summoned by the
Mukhbir al-Saltana, of the Ministry of Education and Endowments, to appear at
the Dar al-Funun and explain himself, and in particular the reference to handing
over cash. His article also stated a fervently held assumption of the Constitution
alists, that "our government isaConstitution and publications must also, as in
other constitutional states of the world, be free". Asubsequent piece, "Half an
Hour at the Daral-Funun", expressed the opinion that the hateful word

"censor" should be consigned toschool history books, toteach children how
matters had stood before Constitution. But while the Majlis had been granted
freedom, Nida-ji Vatan was subject to state control.
The deputies representing Tabriz arrived in Tehran inFebruary 1907 and
were ardent in supporting the new freedoms. An anjuman, society or club, called
the Gulistan and one of the first of many such associations, was formed by Majlis
deputies in Tehran. It included inits deliberations the question of continued
overseeing of publications inspite ofArticle 20 ofthe Supplementary Funda
mental Laws of7 October 1907: "All publications, except heretical books and
material harmful tothe Perspicacious Religion [of Islam], are free and exempt
from censorship." In February 1908 a Press Law was passed to confirm the
intention of this Article. Even this did not go far enough for some of its critics. A
newspaper called Musavat ("Equality"), founded under Sayyid Muhammad Riza
Shirazi in October 1907,published satires on the new law. These satires have a
special literary significance. In addition to theMulla Nasr al-DIn Turkish
newspaper, published in Tiflis in 1906—7, they helped to set the tone for the
facetiae which Sur-i IsrafiPs chief contributor, Mirza CA1I Akbar Khan
Dihkhuda ofQazvin (c. 1880—1955) wrote as"Dakhau", Qazvini dialect for
dihkhuda (village head). His satirical pieces were called Charand Parand, "Stuff
and Nonsense".48 At least the Musavat pieces were evidence that such facetiae
were not without precedent. Rather, they were in a tradition of innuendo ancient
in a land experienced in ways to survive under oppression. It is a tradition
associated with the name Buhlul, which was the title of one of the comic satirical
papers published in the period under review.49 Shaikh Abu Vahib ibn A m r Siriji
Kufi, who flourished in A.D. 806 in the time of Harun al-Rashid, was the
historical Buhlul. He was alearned man who posed as alunatic, thus to becomea
prototype forthe Wise Fool. Jalal al-DIn Rumi (d. 1273) has a verse inthe
Masnavl in which the word Buhlul occurs:
Kau ki na-shanasam tura; a%man bi-jih: carif-i bi-khmsh-am u buhlul-i dih Go for I know you not. Get away from me. I am a gnostic beside myself: the Buhlul ofthe village.
Sayyid Muhammad Riza "Musavat", who, like many ofthe editor-propri
etors, was surnamed with the name of his paper, spoke for other editors when he
demurred over a law exempting all but whatever writings someone might allege
to be "heretical" and opposed to the Faith. He called his nonsense pieces "The

Celebration ofthe Press Law's Appearance". He justified this farrago ofidle
tales and phantasies as achange, from the rational treatment of topics once the
characteristic of his paper, that had been imposed upon him by the need to keep
on the right side of the "auspicious" new law. He did not succeed: these sallies
and an article headed "How's the Shah?" resulted in Musavafs suppression and
his being hunted after the bombardment of the Majlis on 23June 1908. He began
Musavat again inTabriz in 1909, after his escape from Tehran.
The Lesser Constitutional Period of 1906 to 1908 and the beginning of the
Lesser Autocracy, saw an increase innewspaper publication that can be mea
sured by allusions to every paper extant at the time contained in a poem
published on 2 June 1908 by the editor ofChihra-numa, the illustrated Persian
paper published first in Alexandria and later in Cairo. Mlrza Abd al-Muhammad
Isfahan! returned to Iran forfour months. Back in Egypt he recorded his
acquaintance with the Iranian Press of the first days of freedom in a poem which
opens,
Pen, bearer of my secrets, Precious purveyor of my thoughts. . ..
He goes on to name some eighty newspapers, of which only about nine or tenof
those published in Iran pre-date the Constitution.50
Another phenomenon of the Constitutional period was the shabnama, Night
Letter, single-sided "jelly-typed" sheets which were unsigned and distributed
nocturnally, hence their name. To the surprise of some, since asupposedly free
Press had come into existence, they were continued long after the Constitution
had been ratified. As did the anjumans, these shabnamas profoundly excited the
suspicion and ire of Muhammad All Shah, the anti-Constitutionalist monarch
who succeeded MuzafTar al-DIn Shah in January 1907.A few reformers, as we
have seen, had originally raised an Iranian voice abroad. Oneof them was Sayyid
Jamal al-DIn Asadabadl. In 1884, with thecollaboration of the Egyptian
modernist theologian, Muhammad Abduh, he had published a paper in Arabic
called al-cUrwa al-Wuthqa ("The Indissoluble Link").51 Others have already
been mentioned, but now this voice-in-exile became a clamour in Iran itself as it
gathered resonance after the inauguration of the first Majlis. Especially, how
ever, in media like the shabnamas, although more substantial journals were not
exempt, scurrility and the pursuance of personal vendettas soon began to
manifest themselves. This was alapse from the high-mindedness and virtuous

aspirations of earlier publications; but the wit of the "buhlulism" alluded to
above, and the brilliant caricatures, meant tobe funny as well as critical, which
appeared in anumber of publications of the time, should not be counted part of
the deterioration here being noticed.
Early newspaper illustration, which has been dated to i860—i,52 has already
been alluded to, but the caricature became a feature of certain journals during the
Constitutional Movement, a prominent element in which was protest against the
granting of concessions toforeigners, so that a Sadr-i Aczam might be depicted
carving up the map of Iran into lots to sell to aliens. The skill shown in these
cartoons demonstrates the Iranian genius for finding oradapting ways towitty
expression of protest and forthe exposure of social and political ills andthe
malfeasance of those in authority. As with the cassette tapes bearing the voice of
Ayatullah Khumaini and imported on the eve of the 1979 revolution, so with the
caricature, Iranian critics ofthe ruling regime were quick toadopt an effective
technique for their purpose, and one which would overcome thebarrier of
illiteracy.
Muhammad All Shah ordered the Cossack Brigade under the Russian
officer, Colonel Liakhoff, to bombard theMajlis building on 23 June 1908.
Leading members of the Press fled orwere captured. Several were put to death,
including MIrza Jahanglr Khan oiSur-ilsrafil, and the proprietor of the Rub al
Quds, ("Holy Spirit"), Sultan al-cUlama Khurasan!.53 The latter had published
an attack on theShah, whom he had reminded of the fate of Louis XVI of
France. Among those who escaped was Dihkhuda, who in 1909 published
another Sur-i Israfi/ horn Switzerland, for four issues. As has been seen,Musavat
re-emerged under the Sayyid Muhammad Riza in Tabriz, in January 1909.
When the Constitutionalists achieved the Fath-i Mz/II,National Victory, in
Tehran, Muhammad All abdicated in favour of his son, Ahmad Shah, pro
claimed king in July 1909. Newspapers were revived andbegan to show
identifiable allegiances topolitical parties or, rather, factions and often ephem
eral groupings, anextension ofthe traditional Iranian dauras (coteries), which
now adopted political slogans andcame out into the open. These groups
themselves promoted papers tocarry their call. Newpapers proliferated. With
the forcible dissolution of the third Maj lis on 24 December 1911, aperiod of ten
years ensued without aParliament. Itwas during this interval that Sadr Hashimi
says the Iranian Press really "came of age" (vol. 1,p. 25). A large number of
papers came into action to ensure that Iran's first steps towards democracy

would not be forgotten and would be retrieved. The titles ofsome of these
papers furnish a roll-call indicative of the political mood of the time: Sitara-ji
Iran, "Star of Iran"; Iran-i A%ad, "Free Iran"; Racd, "Thunder"; Barq, "Light
ning"; Asr-i Jadzd,"The New Era"; Nau Bahar, "The New Spring"; Shafaq-i

Mard-i A^ad, "The Free Man"; Rahnama, "Guide"; Badr, "The Full Moon";
Taufiq, "Divine Aid"; Gul-iZardva Zambur, "The Yellow Rose and the Bee". In
the provinces, inRasht, Isfahan, Tabriz, Mashhad and Shiraz particularly, the
national spirit was raised bypapers with titles like "The Voice of Gilan",
"Young Thought", "Perseverance", "The Way ofSalvation", "The Spark".
The First World War provided topics which excited extensive reporting and
comment in the columns and leading articles of Iranian newspapers. They were
as if obsessed with foreign news ofevents that it was perfectly naturalfor
intelligent Iranians towatch carefully, weighing up their consequences, most
probably detrimental, but perhaps susceptible to being turned to advantageto
Iran in its vulnerable geo-political position. Iranian intellectuals may have lived
in what for them was an Iran-centred universe, but they were exceedingly aware
of the international scene. In December 1918 theChihra-numa, in Egypt,
reported the suppression of Racd, Shurd ("Consultation", an organ of the
Moderates' patty) and Iran-i Nau ("New Iran") in 1917, and the suspension of
further papers in the capital the following year. The proprietor ofRacd left for
Russia. Only official or trade journals were exempt from waves of suppression,
which were generally attributed to pressure exerted on the Iranian authorities by
the British and Russian envoys inTehran. It is, therefore, interesting thatin
reporting these suppressions, Chihra-numd says the Tehran papers "were banned
. . . on account of attacking each other and, taking sides with leading figures,
degrading others and themselves". The inference is that the newspapers' own
ofTensiveness made their continuation intolerable.54 This does not, ofcourse,
rule out pressure on the part of the representatives of the Allies to have certain
papers closed, but Malik al-Shucara Bahar is said to have written such a scathing
poem about another editor, of the newspaper Shurish,that when his poems were
later collected for a complete edition, this satire was considered unfit for
retention. Regulations governing the granting oflicences were made stricter
during the war years. Licences had been granted by the Minister of Education
latterly, onhis own. Now they had to have the approval ofthe Council of

Ministers. Those already granted but not yet taken up were rescinded and had to
be applied for under the new system.
While the state of the Press was unhappy and apparently somewhat degraded
during these years, which were certainly disillusioning years for Iran — with no
Parliament, atimid and inexperienced youthful king, and the country aprey to
the inroads and plots of the Allies, the Central Powers and their Turkish ally — it
is refreshing to turn to the publication, from 24 January to 15 August 1919, of
Kava in Berlin. This was the serious and beautifully printed journalistic enter
prise of an Iranian intellectual "diaspora" caught or seeking refuge in Germany
during the war. This group comprised the exceptional minds and intellects, in
one or two instances genius, of reforming Iranian Democrats and Nationalists
who had fled from Iran and particularly from Tabriz, where since 1911 Russian
oppression had been especially severe. They were acutely aware of the virtual
suspension oftheir country's independence since the outbreak ofthe war, a
situation anticipated and facilitated bythe provisions of the Anglo-Russian
Convention of1907, which left Russia uninhibited in whatever actions itchose
to take in itsalloted sphere ofinfluence in northern Iran. Hence the paper,
nominally a fortnightly publication but often appearing atirregular intervals,
concentrated on these political issues and on social and particularly educational
issues, including the sending of Iranian students to Europe. E.G. Browne, who
does ample justice to this paper in his Literary History of Persia(vol. iv, pp. 483
ff.), and whose account is followed and amplified by Yahya Aryanpiir, (vol. 11,
pp. 331ff.),in fact nevertheless brands Kavaas an organ of propaganda in favour
of Germany. It would be reasonable tosay that in essence Kava's propaganda
role was on behalf of freeing Iran from alien interference and to follow its own
lights, but also very much in favour of modern education based firmly on that of
western Europe. Influential members of the Kavateam were the Tabriz!, Sayyid
Hasan Taqizada, and the Isfahan!, Sayyid Muhammad All Jamalzada. Of the
latter, more must be said in relation to the development ofmodern Persian
literature, as also concerning the magazine Kava which was inaugurated in
January 1920 and survived until the end of 1921. It will be referred tointhe
section below on periodicals.
Sayyid Ziya al-Din Tabataba3! began journalism with a weekly in Shiraz.
Then he published Sharq, "The East", and later, Barq, "Lightning", in Tehran,
where he finally produced Racd, "Thunder". He typifies the newspaper pub
lisher and politician whose political career is assisted by influence gained
through journalism. By February 1921 Sayyid Ziya was self-assured and, after
travel in Europe and the Caucasus, a man of the world. He had sufficient

courage, as well as intelligence about the officers and morale of the Cossack
Brigade, then officered by Iranians and stationed at Qazvin, to stage a coup d'etat,
for which he used the Brigade and especially one of its most outstanding officers,
Riza Khan, as hismilitary arm.55 By25 February, when he had formed the
government he was thus empowered to do, Sayyid Ziya shut down several of the
capital's more important newspapers. When his short time inoffice ended with
his resignation and exile on 25 May 1921, the newspapers were revived and new
ones established. On28 October 1923 Riza Khan became prime minister after
shrewdly avoiding doing so since Sayyid Ziya's departure, during which time, as
a relatively long-term War Minister, Riza Khan built up an army effective
enough to subdue thecountry under hisdirection as Sardar-i Sipah, Com
mander-in-Chief.
Already during the Sardar-i Sipah's time as Minister ofWar members ofthe
Press had had occasion to read the signs of a not altogether auspicious future for
their activities, although between 1921 and 1923 itwould be untrue to say that all
the organs in avolatile Press of often shifting loyalities were against Riza Khan.
But even tooffer words ofcounsel tothe man inwhom hope for Iran's future
stability lay was dangerous, asMirza Husain Khan Saba discovered on being
summoned to the War Ministry after publishing such words in his Sitara-yilran.
The War Minister asked him what he meant, to which the editor replied, "Iwant
you to be another Nadir" - Iran's last conquistador sovereign - but this
expression of what might have been taken as a flattering avowal did not spare the
journalist the flogging he was immediately ordered. As Malik al-Shucara said, in
connection with this incident, in hisNau Bahary "The world of the Press in
Tehran? One does notknow . . ."56
It was on 3 July 1924, although the reports vary the day slightly, that Bahar
says he was fetched to the Police Department hospital to find Sayyid
Muhammad Riza, the son of Hajj Sayyid Abu^l-Qasim Kurdistanl, and known as
Mirzada Tshql, dying of gunshot wounds. They had been inflicted early that
morning by two callers who pretended tobe offering totake aletter for him to
his home-town, Hamadan, where he was born in 1893. So this poet and editor of
the cartoon-carryingQarn-iBistumy ''Twentieth Century", was thirty-one when
he died later that day, probably chiefly from the loss ofblood issuing from the
several wounds his early-morning assailants had inflicted. Mustaufi, inwhat is

probably the most objective account ofthe episode,57 which he dates to4 July
1924, asserts that the murder was assuredly the work of the authorities working
through the Tehran police. He says Tshqi was attractive tomany people as an
ardent young writer and poet, but that he lacked the ballast of learning and also,
consistency: in 1923 he published a biting satirical ballad against the fourth
Majlis with the chorus, didi chi khabar bud?,"Did you see what was afoot?". It
particularly attacked opponents of Riza Khan theSardar-i Sipah and hence
ranged Ishqi on his side. Later, over the Sardar's kite-flying proposal that Iran
should become a Republic, cIshqI used Qarn-i Blstum to support the Majlis
Deputy, Mudarris, and the latter's minority following against the Sardar.He
turned his venom onto the Prime Minister and the military apparatus that Riza
Khan had so assiduously builtup.
In spite of his cool assessment of Tshqi's weaknesses, cAbd-Allah MustaufT's
agrees with other accounts inclaiming that the crowd atcIshqi's funeral was of
unprecedented proportions, while the quest and chastisement ofhis murderers
were, tosay the least, perfunctory. He does not go so far as another source58in
suggesting that thefuneral was made a pretext fora demonstration on their
behalf promoted by the Qajars, whose Ahmad Shah was still in name the
sovereign. Thetenor of cAbd-Allah MustaufT's argument is based on his
awareness that in the circumstances the mourners needed nosuch impulsion:
they were following atime-worn Iranian precedent of using an occasion such as
a funeral tomake a silent political protest. The murder ofa young Sayyid and
poet would of itself excite asense of outrage and Mustaufi includes this among
the main reasons for the large number of mourners; but he makes opposition to
Riza Khan, "whom they saw as the instigator of the murder", the mainspring of
the protest.59
cIshqi's death marked anew phase in the history of the Iranian Press, ushered
in with the arrival ofstrong and ubiquitous government inthe person ofRiza
Khan, who in 1925 founded anew dynasty to replace that of the Qajars, when he
was declared Shah. Thus began the Pahlavi Era. The military strength hehad
painstakingly levied for the purpose of gradually subordinating the whole
country and all its diverse elements to his command, combined with his eagle eye
and capacity tooverawe, ifnot terrify, his compatriots, imposed fresh patterns
and, on the positive side, anew sense of purpose on his people. A renewed sense
of national consciousness and pride was fostered. A process of the rebuilding of
a nation was inaugurated, not unlike that which Kamal Atatiirk was forcing

upon the Turkish nation. The drive had begun, to fashion an Iran that would
match its urgent realization that salvation lay in making itself an integrated,
independent entity from which international respect could not be withheld.
The number of newspapers published between 1925and 1941, during Riza
Shah's reign, declined from some onehundred and fifty to only fifty by 1940,60
but thetwopublished in thecapital, themorning Iran andtheevening Ittilaat^
became dominant andsurvived. Iran was established in the 1880s, butit was its
new version of 1295S/1915-16, andparticularly theperiod of Majld Muvaqqar's
control ofit from 1316s/193 7, that reflected theaspirations of the new Iran of the
1930s. In themonth of Shahrivar, 1316s (September—October 1937), its article,
"The Newspaper's Influence on theLife of the People", expressed the boosting
of the national morale that was characteristic of the time. Thenewspaper's role
as a cultural guide and source of reliable information for the man-in-the-street
was emphasized, as was theimportance of modern-style technology and profes
sionalism. A daily paper had to become the daily fare of "every family inthe
capital and the provinces". Implicit in this was theassumption that anew typeof
urban middle-class wascoming into existence, which no longer took religious
and classical literary teaching asits sufficient guide; butthelevel of illiteracyand
remoteness of the rural masses lead to theassumption that those Iran addressed
itself to were a limited section of the population.61
The Ittilcfat ("News" or "Information") referred to istheimportant evening
paper under Abbas Masudi, founded in Tehran in 1925. After Iran's exhort
atory article on the civic value of newspapers, the following month Ittilctat
published an item on "The Press andtheBook", according to which these were
the two most effective elements for transforming the "ideas and destiny" ofa
nation and guiding it "towards perfection and progress". They were, so to
speak, "the school, to be considered the most efficacious for changing the
conceptions of adults and forming their minds". Books and periodicals were
"the sole bond andonly intermediary . . . between thepopulace andtheelite:the
only instrument at thedisposal of the educated andlearned to sway men's minds
and teach them their private and public duties".
At the abdication of Riza Shah in 1941, the number of papers had declined
under rigorous prohibition of topics disliked by the government. Yet, besides
the establishment of several important ones at the outset of a reign which had
certainly given hope to many of the younger generation, the circulation of
individual papers and magazines greatly increased. So also did the number of

provincial subscribers to prestigious papers like Iran and Ittilacat from Tehran.
Eventually sixty percent of their issues were purchased in the provinces.62
Machinery was modernized and Itti/acat, which began asone sheet, was ex
tended to eight.
So far periodicals have not been treated separately. It will have become apparent
that many of the journals listed as newspapers were across between periodicals
and what are commonly called newspapers. Also, the periodical or review
developed later. When they did, they were generally more literary than political
in content. Dr Khanlari cites Bahar("Spring") as the first "literary magazine",
which appeared in 1320/1902—3 under the direction of its almost sole contribu
tor, Yusuf Ictisaml, whose articles included biographies of the famous, literary
pieces, translations of European poetry, short stories and moralizing and
sociological items. It lasted a year, but was revived in 1920—1. The description of
its contents atonce suggests to the student of20th-century Persian letters this
journal's pioneering significance, to which Dr Khanlari attests.63 Not the least of
its influence lay in exemplifying a simple, fluent style which, although it showed
signs ofEuropean sources, became a model for modern Persian writing. The
introduction of European poets through the medium of translation was not lost
on a younger generation ofIranian poets, as will be noticed below.
Before returning to the Kavaenterprise in Berlin it is appropriate to mention a
precursor planted in Iranian soil in the successor to the first phase of Bahar: the
literary review Danishkadaof1336/1918. Itwas associated with an anjuman of
the same name forthe encouragement of learning and letters. Danishkada,
"Temple ofKnowledge", stated that its aims included spreading the literary
spirit and "establishing a new policy for Iranian literature", the style and genres
of which were to berevised. While ancient masters would betreated with
respect, new styles related tomodern social requirements would be fostered.
When in January 1920 the new series Kava replaced the wartime politically
preoccupied and polemical Kava, Taqizada ina leading article dissociated the
new publication from the old. For it was not to be devoted to anything other
than "scientific, literary and historical articles".64 In phrases which he recanted
forty years later,65 Sayyid Hasan Taqizada declared the absolute need for Iran's
europeanization. What he called "false patriotism" must be set aside in complete
submission to the principles of European civilization. His opinion was that the
best way of accomplishing this would be "the publication in Iran of translations

of a whole series of the most important European books in plain andsimple
language" (italics added). Here wasa harking back to the earlier stylistic
advocacy of Ttisami; also a portent of United-States-sponsored translation
projects, when inthe 1950s translations ofwestern classics were commissioned
under the auspices of the Franklin Institute.
The new Kavamagazine contained articles of a scholarly content which gives
them aperennial value, especially inthe field, not of explaining the bases of the
models European culture was supposed to supply for Iran's enlightenment, but
of research into Persian literature. As for the example European civilization was
expected to set, Taqlzada later confessed that he had been carried away byhis
fervour for it, but the articles just alluded to in fact demonstrate that the
underlying intention was really to adopt thewestern scholarly and research
methods, which had already been eminently applied byEuropean scholars to
Persian literature and philology aswell as to ancient Iranian history.
Danishkada'seditor, Malik al-Shucara Bahar, followed its demise, inspite of
its eager acceptance, after only a year with another weekly periodical, Nau Bahar,
"The Fresh Spring", in 1922-3. Politics were not banished from its pages, but
neither were translations of European stories andpoems, andalso original
historical studies. Some time earlier Vahid Dastgirdi (d. 1942), the editor of the
works of the poet Nizami, had founded thereview Armaghan, "Keepsake",
which was so extensively taken-up with classical Persian poetry that itremainsa
useful source of reference for the serious student of a large and remarkably rich
canon. Less conservative modernists criticized this review as backward looking,
but, asat the outset of this Chapter Sadr Hashimi was seen to suggest, such
periodicals tried to withstand the tests imposed bythe new reign, and intro
duced names that were later to become celebrated as those of historians, poetsin
their own right, critics and preservers ofIran's literary heritage: those ofSacld
NafTsI and Majid Muvaqqar, forexample, besides Bahar and Vahid. Literary
reviews also appeared in Shiraz, Pasargad ("Pasargadae") andSapida Dam
("Aurora"), Rasht and other provincial centres.66
P.N. Khanlarl, speaking with voice ofa young poet and intellectual at the
1946 Congress of Iranian Writers, regrets the tendency of these literary
periodicals to concentrate on literary history and therediscovery of ancient
masterpieces atthe expense ofinnovation ina modern idiom. Yet he concedes
that such diversions were practically allthat editors could safely pursue in a
period of censorship. Even the citing of classical literature could mean trouble:

publication of anything regarded as likely to excite a mood of pessimism or
nostalgia for apast tarnished with mystical contemplation and passive quietism
was prohibited. Mihr, "The Sun", was impounded in 1937-8 and thenceforward
until Riza Shah's abdication in 1941 literary reviews ceased with the exception of
the government sponsored Iran-i Imru%, "Iran Today", as much as anything else
a vehicle forpropaganda photographs. From early inthe modern period Iran
showed itself as adept in photography as it did inthe art of caricature. After the
First World War, photographic newspaper and magazine illustration was a
feature ofthe Press and the example ofthe British PicturePost appears to have
been copied. Iran-i Imru^ did, however, also print some social and literary essays,
but sufficiently discreetly for its editor not toupset his good relations with the
vigilant authorities.67
After Riza Shah's departure, the most important reviews to emerge were first
of all Khanlari's Sukhan ("The Word") in 1327/1942—3, which was ofa quality
and, after an early pause, continuity reminiscent, inits significance as a literary
periodical, ofScrutiny inthe United Kingdom, and which in 1986, inthe post
revolution era, permission has been granted to reprint as a literary reference
series ofoutstanding value. For years it provided publishing scope foryoung
writers and poets; also for scholarly discussion on textual, grammatical and
philological problems aswell astopics inComparative Literature. Its office in
Tehran was an informal meeting place for established and aspiring literati, and
students of Persian from abroad. Many academic and editorial projects were first
mooted and planned there. Abbas Iqbal (d. 1334/195 5) the historian's Yadgar
("Memorial") was issued for literary andhistorical researches, andAyanda
("The Future"), for political and social affairs. In1956—7 the galaxy received the
addition of Kahnama-yi Kitab, "Guide toBooks". Itis edited by Iran's foremost
bibliographer, Iraj Afshar, and cited by Vera Kubickova as the culmination of
modern Iranian efforts in bibliography and textual documentation in relation to
literary studies.68
The end of what writers and the Press termed the era of the dictatorship, ^aman-i
diktaturi, came when the British and Russians entered Iran inAugust 1941 and
Riza Shah abdicated on 16 September. A period of freedom began which may be
said to have lasted, although always subject to some restraints, until the
Musaddiq era, 1951 to 1953. Such freedom forthe expression ofnew ideas in
literature, with the zest which the novel sense ofliberation from government

"guidance" brought with it,has never been part ofthe Iranian intellectual and
artistic experience since those years between 1941 and 1951. Yet it took some
months at thebeginning for editors and writers to become adjusted to the
paradoxical situation of a freedom from Riza Shah's requirements, combined
with the presence ofOccupying Powers, whose own views on what might and
might not be printed had to be tested.69 L.P. Elwell-Sutton records that the Press
stayed neutral in tone until the end of 1941. Theonly newpapers were
consequent upon the return from exile of Zain al- Abidin Rahnama, the original
editor of Iran, which he resumed so that Majid Muvaqqar moved to found
another paper, Mihr-i Iran ("Sun of Iran"), on the same day as Rahnama issued
Iran in a new format, 19December 1941. Both papers were moderate.
A portent of the vigour, often combined with irresponsibility, of the Press of
the future was Iqdam ("Endeavour"). It had been started in 1921. In January
1942 it reappeared under its original editor, the Islamic polemicist and fighter
Abbas Khallll. He was the enemy of the British and of foreign invaders of Islam,
whoever they might be. He made Iqdam a thorn in the side ofthe Occupying
Powers and attacked the Tripartite Treaty bywhich the Russians and British
wished to regulate with Iran the terms and duration of the Occupation. Iqdamset
the politically violent tone of a host of papers which soon began to indulge more
in vituperative polemics and name-calling than innews reporting. Their paro
chialism might beattributed to three factors. First of all there were wartime
restrictions on thecommunication of much factual information at an inter
national level. Combined with this limitation was the Allies' preference for
slanting facts in favour of the aims of their own propaganda. Secondly there was
the Iranian authorities' nervousness lest they offend theOccupying Powers,
combined with political uncertainty and lack of confidence after over a decade of
inaction under Riza Shah's one-man rule. Moreover, the government was
confronted with inflation, food and material shortages, and allthe economic
dislocations and political distortions consequent upon foreign occupation and
intervention, with the arrival inIran of numbers of British, Russian and United
States officers and men. Thirdly older politicians, long deprived of scopefor
action and the exercise of patronage, were eager to obtain power again. Under a
young and weak sovereign, Muhammad Riza Pahlavi, they strove to re-establish
themselves. As a result factions became centred on certain individuals.
Groupings, often ephemeral and not deserving the name of political parties,
were formed and claimed media support. Hence alarge number of often equally

ephemeral newspapers were issued. Although there was plenty of political
discussion and the contents ofthese papers were passed by word of mouth
among apeople always ready todiscuss politics and not lacking proneness to
fantasize about them, still only ten tofifteen percent ofthe population could
read. Therefore circulation was frequently exceedingly small, and there was
inadequate finance fornewspapers to purchase the services of international
agencies. The Pars News Agency had by 1944 been established as part ofthe
Department of Press and Propaganda and, since they had no alternative, was
used by the many papers which could not afford a news service of their own, but
it was a poor substitute forinternational agencies and itsinformation was
generally late arriving.70
Apart from major papers, most had acirculation under 5,000 and sometimes
as low as 500. There were papers sustained almost entirely by blackmail. This
should not be taken to mean that certain civilized restraints went unobserved in
a land where the individual's privacy is respected, perhaps all the more because
so much of life seems to be lived in public. However scurrilous, itwas rare for
comments to bemade in the Press ona person's private life and morality.
Iranians were highly political inthe 1940s, but the moral censure which has
become a feature of Iranian life since 1979 was not prominent. Fantasy related to
a mythology of politics, which was not always as far from the truth as superfi
cially it seemed tobe, was commonplace; cant and hypocrisy were not.
Attempts were made to reactivate the Department of Press and Propaganda
left over from the former reign. If an active director, such as the writer and
thinker Ibrahim Khwaja Nuri of the moderate Adalat (Justice) Party, triedto
instil responsibility and professionalism into the Press, and discrimination in its
readers, the cry of"Censorship" arose ina world thirsty forliberty. Such a
director soon had to relinquish his post. When Khwaja Nuri did, his dismissal,
early in 1944, entailed that of the prime minister who had had the temerity to
appoint him. That this Press, inspite of its state of, inElwell-Sutton's phrase,
"ferment and turmoil", had bite was due to ineptitude on the part of personally
ambitious politicians and, perhaps more than anything else, to terror of what a
free press, which few had the strategy tocajole orcontrol, might do orsay,
particularly when food shortages and other ills provided itwith agreat deal of
ammunition.
The Martial Law Regulation of August 1941 gave the Military Governor of
Tehran powers to suppress papers for anything which he considered "interfer

ence" with government functions. These ill-defined powers were not unspar
ingly used. During the December 1942 bread riots, the prime minister, Qavam
al-Saltana, suppressed all the Tehran papers. To suppress all of them obviated an
adroit procedure Iranian editors practised when only afew organs were banned.
They promptly resumed publication under another title. The clamorousbut
threatened character of this period of Iranian journalism schooled its operatives
in avariety ofdevices tocircumvent suppression and restrictions on comment
derogatory to the Occupying Powers and carefully monitored bythem. The
latter were referred to by soubriquets such as "the crow, eagle and bear" or "our
northern and southern neighbours".
After the years of dictatorship nobody wanted censorship or the frequent
banning ofpapers. Nevertheless successive prime ministers had to be waryof
the Allies' susceptibilities and to avoid inviting further interference in domestic
affairs. Efforts were made to amend the Press Law embodied in theoriginal
Constitution of1906—7. So sensitive was the issue that two Press Law bills hadto
be withdrawn in face of stiff Majlis opposition. After his dramatic ban on the
Tehran Press following the December bread riots in 1942, Qavam had a
government sheet published, called A.khbar-i Rii%, "The Day's News", which
continued until 2 February 1943. At the same time he seized the opportunity to
get an amended Press Law passed on 24 December 1942. Its main purpose was to
ensure thelicensing of newspapers by the government, and that individuals
should only be licence-holders for one paper, and, in particular, that toobtain a
licence they should be able toshow specific financial and educational qualifica
tions. Qavam himself did not lack interest in letters. He had as ayouth been one
of the aristocrats involved inthe Constitutional Movement, for the documents
of which his calligraphic skills had been employed. Thus hewell understood
editors and the Press. In 1946, during the crises over the Northern Oil and the
Azerbaijan separatist movement, he proved himself the one Iranian statesman
capable of manipulating the Press until, the time ofcrisis having passed, he fell
from power.
Neither the amended Press Law nor the efforts ofthe more responsible men
in the newspaper business succeeded in raising standards orbringing order into
a medium which was in effect a Hydra. Responsible proprietors and editors
(they were generally but not necessarily the same person), attempted to organize
themselves into a Press Union, founded in August 1942, but, apart from the
outstanding /////^/organization and its rival, Kayban's, there was nothing in the
way of major Press groupings controlled by a limited number of richand
influential individuals associated with an equally limited number ofwell orga

nized, clearly defined and viable political parties. Some rich men might find
reasons for erratically funding a newspaper or two, but the reasons were
generally either political in the sense that they wished to strengthen their power
base, or personal in pursuit of a vendetta, or acombination of both in asituation
where the concept ofcivic responsibility had become atrophied since the first
days of the Constitutional Movement. There wasa dearth of thosewho
perceived theusefulness of organizing and financing a large newspaper and
publishing corporation. The Press had not yet been able, due in large measureto
lack of freedom, tomature into something which an entrepreneur could regard
as a business operation. Newsprint, carefully controlled bythe Allies, was in
short supply, aspaper forall purposes has again become inIran atthe timeof
writing; but inany event, had the conception ofPress monopolies occurred to
businessmen, nopragmatic Iranian investor would have felt drawn to a field
catering only fora literate few.
The 1942 Press Union gradually became a clique of the left and an instrument
of the communist Tuda Party, after the Union had been more orless taken over
by the Freedom Front, formed in July 1943. The left, and notably the Tuda
Party, did foster a Press which showed signs of both responsibility and organiza
tion, but the Tuda was one of the few political parties to show similar featuresin
the sphere of party formation; it had motives above the merely personal.
A new and less controversial Iranian Press Association came into being in
June 1946. Itprohibited party membership for members of the Association and
became affiliated to theInternational Organization of Journalists in January
1947. Among the Association's founders only two are mentioned by Elwell
Sutton as leftist, although their political allegiances were, tosay the least, fickle.
They both represented significant Khurasanian interests, those of the Tafazzulis
and the Iqbals, families not averse to having a foot in more than one camp, as was
prudent. The outline of the history of their two papers, as given by Elwell
Sutton,71 provides a clear example ofhow members ofthe same clique, in this
instance initially that of Paikar ("Battle") Party supporters, might combine over
one ormore newspapers, to give themselves a wider spread, opportunities to
reflect variable political positions through having more than one organ, and the
possession of alternative papers if one were suppressed. Needless to say, the
subterfuges which became afeature of this journalism would be quite evidentto
those who happened to be in power. The dignity of the Press was in the
meantime seriously damaged.

Polarization between the left and right became more sharply defined after
1944 when Soviet interest incompeting with American and British oil prospec
tors forIran's "northern" oil became obvious. The prime minister, Muhammad
Said, admitted before theMajlis in August that hehad seen representatives of
the first two nations fortalks about oil concessions.72 Certain newspapers came
out violently against Said and infavour ofthe U.S.S.R. Soviet propaganda was,
especially asreported byLenczowski, aneye-witness and close to the workings
of the Tehran Press, both more subtle and more pervasive than either the British
or American. It had an impact on thePress andon literature in general, as the
1946 First Congress of Iranian Writers showrs. This major literary event was
organized under Soviet auspices and most welcome to Iranian literary aspirants
of the day. It marked the coming of age of modern Persian letters.
During the War, the British, Russians, Poles and Americans published papers
and magazines intheir own languages and in Persian. Elwell-Sutton lists seven
papers inPolish and amonthly bulletin issued by the Polish Information Service
in French.73 TheFrench-language journal de Teheran^ however, dated back to
1934. Its editor was Javad Mascudi, the brother of the head of the lttilaat
organization, Abbas Mascudi. It chiefly depended onthe Agence France Presse
for foreign news. Although the French F.mbassy supplied feature articles,
Journal de Teheran was nowartime product of any foreign propaganda machine.
In thecontext of the latter, an Anglo-American publication, started in the
summer of 1941 by Doubleday Doran ofNew York and Hodder and Stoughton
in London, deserves mention. It purported to be a literary, scientific and
economics magazine and, called Ku^gar-i Nrau("The New Age"), was published
quarterly in Persian and profusely illustrated. The covers bore sumptuous
reproductions of Persian miniatures. While it wasa wartime "propaganda"
enterprise, it was helped by advertisements placed by important industrial
concerns, and was respected byIranian men of letters ofthe time. The contents
included articles onoriental studies, and such social topics aspublic health and
hospital organization.
Apart from a type of journalism like Ku^gar-i Nau's, published abroad for
import into Iran, in Iran itself there were foreign-sponsored pioneering efforts
in a kind of newspaper offshoot which had a lasting impact and furnished
modern Iran with a new journalistic feature. Magazines specially designed for
women readers andfor children were to have many later descendants; by the
decade ending in 1974, Mascud Barzin's comment on the"The Woman of the

Day" (Zan-iRu%), a Tehran weekly of a 110 pages, then in its tenth year, was that
it was one of the most successful magazines in the capital.74 As with other aspects
of the Press, the same decade occasions Barzin's observation on the demise of a
number ofjournals orsections of them devoted tochildren, the regular papers
for infants published by the Ittilcfat and Kayhan organizations for example; but
still the Ministry ofEducation was keenly producing separate journals catering
for different age-groups. Atthe same time, Kayhan and lttilaQat\ commercial
concern had prompted a move in theopposite direction towards readership
through weeklies addressed to more than one generation, albeit with the accent
on the young. Perhaps these two organizations' problem inthe field ofjournals
for children was compounded, while the Education Ministry's effort in the same
field was inspired and supported, by the intervention of the American Franklin
Publishing Organization under whose joint aegis with the Ministry the Paik
series for theyoung, graded according to ageandschool class levels, was
produced. Finance and expertise were thus introduced into this field with which
it was difficult forother organizations to compete, even those of Ittjlctat and
Kayhan. The Paik venture was underway by 1962 and expanded, to include
young men and women, in 1972. A year later itreported an annual production of
over a million copies ofthe various parts inthe series ofexcellently produced
papers.75
The development of journals bearing on youthful readers from the late 1950s
was natural in response to the predominantly youthful element arising in the
population asIran headed forthe 1979 revolution, in which the literate were
seen to be vastly outnumbered by illiterate compatriots, with whom they
nevertheless joined forces. Also consonant with this emphasis on youth, as well
as with a traditional Iranian preoccupation with development of a strong
physique, wasthe production of magazines devoted to physical training,
weight-lifting and the like. By the early 1970s, however, diversionary entertain
ment, stories, the cinema and profiles of stars and singers, sport and other, soto
speak, "circus" topics had almost completely monopolized the weeklies which
proliferated in accordance with their increasing popularity among anincreas
ingly butsuperficially sophisticated populace in the capital. The capitalhad
learnt the modern and alien capacity for being bored. Constructive political
action was denied. Distractions and an evanescent glamour were sought inthe
capital of a nation whose guilt for the betrayal of traditional values was shortlyto
be expiated; in Iran there hasalways been a far deeper andmore ancient

sophistication than that to which reference has just been made. Of the weeklies
here referred to all but one were produced in Tehran. Meanwhile, Kaushanfikr,
"The Enlightened Mind", had collapsed; apart from Sukhan, the only more
serious periodicals and papers were medical, health and pharmaceutical jour
nals, the Tehran Economistand the "Bourse", but, significantly in the 1970s, there
was adecline in the treatment of economics and commerce, even in the pages set
aside for these topics in the two major newpapers. The weekly Ba%ar-i Khavar-i
Miyana ("Middle East Market") closed altogether. The weekly Tehran Economist
only survived with a struggle. Scepticism about the "economic miracles"no
doubt militated against intelligent people's interest in such publications.
The only journal devoted to these matters which continued to command
confidence in the decade 1964-74 was the daily Burs ("Bourse"), because it gave
up-to-date economic and trade data objectively and not from one side only,
supplying businessmen with the information they required, without telling
them, the heirs of one of the most adroit trading nations in the world, what they
should be doing.76 Itwas read in the provinces as well as Tehran, its sales being
eighteen percent in the north, fifteen percent in the east, forty-five percent in the
south and one percent in the western part of the country.77 As Barzin comments
in another context, it is interesting how Azarbaijan, once so prominently
vigorous inthe promotion ofthe Press, had gradually relinquished its former
role; but before returning to the Press innorthwestern Iran, one field inwhich
some sign ofrevival was noticeable half a decade before the revolution needs
mentioning.
Barzin maintains that in comparison with the years before 1964 religious
publications, nashriyat-i ma\habl, became markedly active between 1964 and
1974. He lists the causes ofthis revival asthe appearance of better educated
religious classes, who, through such media asthe radio and television, were
becoming better acquainted with the world; and a better informed Iranian
youth, which meant that religious literature had to cater for a readership
requiring rational arguments and demonstrations ofreligious verities accept
able tominds aware ofmodern sociological and scientific discussion. He lists
among the religious journals ofthe time, which took their beginning from a
small start in Qum, al-Fikral-Islamz, Tarikh al-Islam, Dars-hcila^ Maktab-i Islam,
Sitara-ji Islam, Nida-yi Haqq, and Nasl-i Nau (Payam-i Shadi bara-ji Nasl-i Nan),
the last meaning, "The New Generation (Good News forthe New Genera
tion"), a title of which the significance is clear. But he lists separately the Maarif

/ Islaml ("Islamic Teaching"), published by the government Endowments
Organization, and Maqalatva Barrasl-ha ("Articles and Researches"), published
by the research team of the Faculty of Divinity and Islamic Teaching in Tehran.
These publications must have been known tobe "associated with institutions
and not independent".78 Thus Barzln isolates religious revivalist literature
which had a sponsorship other than that ofthe main religious Establishment
based onQum. However, a journal like al-Fikr al-lslaml("Islamic Thought")
was published periodically in Tehran, and in Arabic, while Tarlkh al-Islam
("History ofIslam") was also produced inTehran, but more as an annual, the
depth andseriousness of the contents of which appeal only to the highly
educated. Its first number appeared in the winter of1973. Nasl-i Nan, in Barzin's
opinion the religious publication which "tries most tomake topics conform to
everyday realities", was printed, with an illustrated cover in colour, in the press
of the Islamic Propaganda Institute in Qum. Aimed at theyoung with the
purpose ofattracting them tothe truths ofreligion, its editorial board, headed
by Hasan SharTatmadarl, took care to elucidate Arabic terms and phrases, as also
those in other tongues.
In 1945, between theend of November and mid-December, a so-called
"National Government of Iranian Azarbaijan" was established, under Jacfar
Pishavari, followed by Qazi Muhammad's "Kurdish People's Government"
over an area of about fifty miles radius centered on the town ofMahabad. The
Democrats' regimes in Azarbaijan and the Iranian Kurdish region were thus
inaugurated. By the end of1946 these Soviet chaperoned, left-wing autonomist
regimes had collapsed and Soviet patronage was withdrawn. The Iranian central
authorities proceeded toeradicate any traces ofAzerbaijani and Kurdish sepa
ratism. Students were reported to have of their own volition destroyed text
books the Democrat regime had supplied in the local Turkish dialect instead of
Persian.79 Meanwhile in Mahabad, the "Persian authorities prohibited teaching
in the Kurdish language, closed the Kurdish printing-press, and publicly burnt
all the Kurdish books they could find".80 In the ensuing drive against the Tuda
Party, its headquarters in Tehran were destroyed and its newspapers, Kahbarand
Zafar, banned.
Perhaps the surprising extent towhich the Press declined after the Second
World War in Tabriz, the cradle of Iranian reform and journalism, can inlarge
measure be attributed to the collapse of the separatist attempt italso cradled, but

which ended in disgrace and disillusionment. In the post-Musaddiq decade,
1954 to 1964, the provincial Press expanded toa total ofsome ninety publica
tions, eighty-four newspapers and six magazines. Khurasan held the lead, which
it kept inthe next decade, although the provincial total fell to seventy-three.
Tehran province came next with nine to Khurasan's fifteen, then, between 1964
and 1974, seven to Khurasan's eighteen. Pars, with the new Pahlavi University
in Shiraz, and Isfahan and Gilan came next, but the two divisions into which
Azerbaijan had been divided, as West and East Azarbaljan, came lower and were
taken with Hamadan, Mazandaran, Kurdistan, Luristan, Sistan, Baluchistan and
the Gulf Ports, to give small totals below half-a-dozen. Barzin comments on the
decline in the early 1970s ofthe provincial Press asa whole.81 Two or three
organs which survived, at least until the declaration of a One-Party State when
the Shah established the Rastakhlz ("Resurrection") Party in 1975, were taken
over and supported by one of the two parties that were experimented with from
the mid-1950s in an attempt to impose a two-party system with a "loyal"
opposition on the British model. Huvaida's Iran Novin Party, New Iran Party,
the one in government, sponsored papers inthree provincial centres and the
party ofopposition, Asad-Allah cAlam's Mardum Party, People's Party, gave
not unenlightened sponsorship toone ortwo papers. Even this by no means
entirely irresponsible journalism which the two parties promoted ona small
scale disappeared after 1975. Notably, one of the few provincial papers to
emerge orre-emerge after 1964 was the Payam-i Shadl ("Good News") in the
religious centre, Qum, while a Payam-i Adi/lJyof Lahijan, Gilan, ("National
Herald") was likewise one of the few papers to appear in the decade which saw
the closure of sixty-one provincial publications.
The decline in the provincial Press is in the first place attributable to the
increasing powTer, more effective distribution methods than were usual, and the
running of provincial pages specially set-up for different regions, which charac
terized the Tehran "Twin Giants", the Ghulha-yi Duqulu, Ittilacat and Kayban.
After thirteen years ofintense rivalry, these two papers, in the words of the
uninhibited weekly Khwandanlhas director and outspoken commentator, CA1I
Asghar Amlrani (Number 72, year s. 1334/1954—5), became identical in the mid
fifties when they combined to form a partnership with which none could
compete. They had the plant, experience and financial ability that enabled them
to become a publishing empire without precedent in Iran, and to survive,
although after the virtual merger oftheir editorial policies the circulation of

both fell from figures of as high, for Kayhan,as 120,000, for Ittilctat, 70,000,to
40,000, in aland which in 1961—2 numbered only some 4,3 5 3,688 literate people
in a population of thirty million odd.82
In the second place, in common with all the Iranian Press from the late 195 os,
the provincial papers' decline was accelerated by improvement in radio coverage
of news, comment and, poaching on ground greatly favoured by the producers
and readers of weekly and monthly magazines, stories as well as plays; and, in the
first instance in Tehran and Khuzistan, thedevelopment of television. The
disadvantage these two media imposed on the Press in acountry where so many
could not read, but where the radio became ubiquitous, istoo obvious toneed
emphasizing. As implied inthe first sentence of this paragraph, the problem of
decline was not restricted to the provincial Press. Mascud Barzin discusses it
already in his 1966 publication, the first of his two valuable books on the decades
1955—65 and 1965—75 ofthe Iranian Press. Reasons for it, which he elicited by
questioning asample of readers, include items conducive to athesis concerning
the part played by decline in the quality and the very nature of the Press and its
receptivity by the people, in preparing the way for the revolution of1979. While
he himself adds comment on the competition from radio and television, and that
occasioned bya "continual increase in the number of . . . foreign papers and
journals imported", by an increase incheap pocket paperback books, and even
by the diversion public lotteries introduced, his response from those he ques
tioned pinpoints at least three issues which demonstrate the serious degree to
which, in the decades between the fall of Musaddiq and the Iranian Revolution,
the Press had forfeited the confidence ofits readers; ceased to bean effective
critique of a government which was aided in controlling the Press by its readers'
general subservience; and had vitiated itschances of being a Press to mould
public opinion into an independent corrective orguide for the government.
Barzin's first three responses were that the Press, and especially the monthly
magazines, had too low alevel of contents; that readers were too sceptical not to
be reluctant to accept what was published, especially in newspapers; and that the
Press, especially the daily, contained too much propaganda on behalf of different
cabinets and office-holders, while smaller papers tended largely to subsist on the
revenue afforded by government announcements. Another response was that
papers showed too little concern for the people's difficulties in a society
burdened by rising inflation and bewildered by over-rapid changes, the benefits
of which were not immediately apparent to a populace whose indigence was

compounded by new taxes and to whom new policies, while much lauded, were
inadequately explained. Also, it was said that many lacked the means to buy
newspapers and magazines, the sharing of which was common. The personal
views of editors were notwhat people wished always to read: a natural
unwillingness to read the views, interposed with discussion of public affairs, of
men not highly trusted added to the generally cynical attitude which, after the
events of Musaddiq's regime, began to take root. The Press ceased to be
popular.
It ceased to be relevant to the needs of a majority in whom ithad, ironically,
aroused expectations of entertaining comment, ifnot guidance. In apaper like
Khwandanlhd ("Things Worth Reading") social and political comment, although
often witheringly contemptuous, was serious, until the day Amirani fell into
disgrace and public figures were spared forever the terror of his editorials, "The
Bare Facts". The Press also ceased to express aspirations in which the majority
might believe: too many promises had been made without materializing, to
promote universal trust. Independent journals, among which Khusha ("Glean
ings") might be named as amore literary than political magazine, whileBamdad
("Dawn") and Khwandariiha could keep the political personalities of the day on
their toes and voice criticism of prominent people, had disappeared by the early
seventies, in spite ofhaving enjoyed a wide readership, especially Bamdad.
In the event, so had political personalities with influence disappeared by the
last Pahlavl decade. It may be said that only one remained, the Shah. He,
followed byhis family, the Army and the U.S.A., was number one onthe,
presumably unwritten, list of persons and matters which, according to a
principal leader-writer of Ittilaat in aprivate communication to the authorin
1955, had been given to the newspaper as a guide to whom and what were never
to receive adverse comment. Disobedience to this type of directive to the Press
threatened with ruin the heavily financed corporation of the Ittilctat which
Abbas Mascudi had established. When Dr Misbahzada's Kayhan became virtu
ally a partner in this corporation, Kayhan lost its Guardian style of a mildly critical
organ as it too conformed. Licensees and editors knew the rumours about the
cruel death by torture and burning which Karimpur Shirazi had suffered after
Musaddiq's fall, during whose premiership he had criticized a member ofthe
Shah's family inhis paper, Sh'urish("Insurrection").
In February 1948 journalists and others had been shocked by the assassina
tion ofMuhammad Mascud Qumml, the licensee ofMard-i Imru% ("Today's
Man"), ahighly critical and many times suppressed newspaper, the murder of
whose leading spirit was believed to be on the Shah's instructions. Only in 1985,

during interrogation ofa leading member ofthe Tiida Party, was it stated that it
was notthe throne which instigated this murder, buttheTuda Party withthe
purpose of damaging the throne and eliminating a strong critic of the govern
ment who was also deeply averse to thecommunism of the Tiida Party.83
By the 1960s thetwo dominant evening papers, Ittilcfat and Kayhan, with
their satellite magazines and extensive circulation andnetwork of correspon
dents inthe provinces, gave most space toforeign news, inthe absence ofscope
for worthwhile comment on home affairs. Yet both papers developed impres
sive English-language papers and, for Iranian readers abroad, airmail editions
which, however, evidence shows were little read byIranian students. In style
and efficiency these two enterprises brought Iranian journalistic production to a
peak ofexcellence by the decade ofthe sixties, but it was amaturity attained at a
time when circumstances were conspiring to emasculate it.
By the mid-seventies and the eve ofthe Iranian Revolution, the Persian Press
can be seen to have begun to reflect thepassivity which was the obverse of
intense economic activity, especially after the change incontrol ofoil pricing in
1973. The more articulate andeducated preferred publicly to accept political
conditions which in private they criticized. While a potentially influential
number were seeking materially to profit from new economic opportunities,
they declined to risk thedangers attendant upon opposition. That was left to
dissident activists andbecame theproperty of terrorists.
Other causes, notleast inflationary prices, might becited forthe decline of
the Press, but the most significant wasthe growing disillusionment of the
reading public and their lack of confidence in the future. Promises were
beginning to appear illusory. While even periodicals devoted to sport and
athletics declined inacceptance as they became regimented to serve the purposes
of propaganda, anincrease in glamorous magazines didnotovercome Iranian
scepticism. They were of obvious western provenance. They trivialized a
journalism nolonger addressed to those affairs which gravely concerned a host
of people. Articles on such topics as the family, child-rearing, menus and
cooking and soforth ignored the pressures under which many were living, and
were impracticable for all but avery few. At the same time they might have made
disillusionment thegreater. They titillated thesenses butalso raised expecta
tions there seemed little chance ofgratifying. The traditional values inthe idiom
of which pre-1925 journals spoke, wherever produced and ofwhatever politics,
were absent except from one or two religious journals, with a limited and

specialist audience. Only one genre, that of the story, saw an increase in demand,
both in the Press and on the radio, during the period under review. Earlier there
had been astrange tendency to use mainly translated stories or to make Persian
originals appear to be of foreign origin by the expedient of naming characters
with European names and giving a foreign location. Latterly this practice ceased
and stories and characters were made Iranian.
The lack of political comment left room for the delivery of political messages
by means other than the Press. The Iranian facility inadaptation ensured that
messages could be delivered by means ofthe spoken word which, were they
literate or not, the wearers ofearphones could hear from cassettes imported
from a religious dissident abroad, just as in the first years of the century
newspapers had clandestinely been imported. Itis an irony that Iran's failure to
have apositive Press coincided with United States sponsorship of attemptsto
reform journalism and raise its standards. Aided by aFulbright scheme, classes
in Tehran University were opened in 1956, with aProfessor imported from the
U.S.A. The first four-year course finished in i960, but there was not another
until four years later.
Kayhan and Ittilctat began schools of journalism on their own and, although
there seems to have been resistance in University circles to making such courses
a recognized part of the academic programme, Dr Misbahzada of Kayhanused
his academic standing to foster them in conjunction with his newspaper. By 1964
some two hundred andthirty of the two major papers' journalistshad
undergone training, and both papers began apolicy of employing academically
qualified members of staff. Yet these efforts were out of line with the unsatisfac
tory realities of the status and pay of full-time and especially young journalists.
Well-qualified people were not attracted to journalism as aprofession.84 Many
combined journalism with other occupations and only the authors ofstories,
either serialized or separate, commanded appreciable fees. A revised Press Law
was passed in 1965 and a journalists' Union became active inthe struggle for
betterment ofthe journalists' position.
Thus attempts were being made to introduce professionalism, but into a
Press that had ceased torepresent any Cause and which from early 1975 was
deprived of such life as even the existence of two "official" political parties had
bestowed on it. The classes which had used organs to boost their influence had
long since retired from the arena and had other outlets for their energies. No
forum for discussion and no Press to shape public opinion remained.

LITERATURE
A survey of the development of journalism inIran during the last hundred and
eighty years includes agreat deal about the development of its literary activity in
general during the same period. It will have become evident that much of the
journalism was what would commonly be considered literature inthe creative
and aesthetic sense, and that the development of the first provided anew vehicle
for the second. Poets, who inthe past had enjoyed a court patronage that was
impaired in the Safavid epoch and never fully resumed its role in the encourage
ment of verse, used the columns of the journals they often themselves produced,
for publication of their poems, but the modern age has chiefly been that of prose,
revived and reformed as amore suitable vehicle than verse for modern political
and social concerns. The impact ofthe West made writers, conscious of Iran's
humiliation at its hands, seek to discover the secret of its power in its cultural and
institutional manifestations. That they did not look for deficiencies in their own
culture was due less tothe blindness of pride than tothe legitimate assumption
that Iran's ancient culture, the subject of study inEurope and of the admiration
of Goethe, wasin some respects superior to the West's. Yet,on a more
pragmatic level, it was with the West that they had tocommunicate and which
they felt a practical necessity to emulate.
Until, in much more recent times, Iranian poets, chiefly under the innovatory
but cautious, meditative and artistically warrantable influence of Nlma-yi
Yushij (i895—1959), began tocontrive an escape from traditional forms, which
was the more difficult because of that tradition's comprehensive power and hold
on the whole nation, any attempt toadapt Persian poetics to modern times in
anything butsubject matter was avoided. Modern subjects continued to be
expressed intraditional modes, but time-honoured, and also time-worn, imag
ery was discarded. Atradition of courtly poetry was, moreover, blended with a
popular ballad andlampoon {tasnif) tradition, which hadsurvived in Iran
although, especially inSafavid times, many poets inthe high classical tradition
had fled tothe princely courts ofIndia. This blend isparticularly evident inthe
verses of Tshqi (1894-1924), butneither henora host of his contemporary
poets, who included Bahar (1880—1951), ventured seriously to break the tra
ditional mould and thus toisolate themselves from a populace which, whether
or not illiterate, was aptto know byheart many verses in the old form.85
Prose was not inthe same way as verse the property ofthe entire nation, but

of the learned, educated in the conventions of the chancellery and religious
disputation, andunwilling to accept thevernacular without adornments derived
from Arabic, the language of the learned and the religious classes. Prose
traditions were not within the range of the illiterate. They were a barrier to that
spreading of communication which, as has been observed, was an aim of
reformers from the time of Amir-i Kablr. Prose was a field for adaptation in a
way poetry was not. From the beginning of the modern period it was the
purpose of writers to make it the property of the people. Fath CA1T Akhundzada,
whose medium was Turkish and home in Tim's, where the Russians had
introduced the theatre and opera, decided that this could be achieved through
drama spoken as people speak in real life. In 1873-4 Mirza Jacfar Qarajadaghi
published Persian adaptations of Akhundzada's plays in Tehran and proclaimed
the same purpose. In 1882 oneof the plays waspublished in England as a manual
for learning colloquial Persian.86
In the late 1880s the Siyahatnama, travel diary, of Ibrahim Beg began to
appear. Another instalment appeared in 1907,from the Habl al-Matin Press in
Calcutta. As it wasa political satire on the state of Iran, it wasprinted abroad, the
first part by its author, Zain al-Abidin of Maragha, in Cairo. In 1910a further
edition of the main parts of the work wasissued in Calcutta, again asa manual for
foreign students of Persian. Ironically, this satirical travel diary of a patriot's
disillusionment on revisiting his ancestral land wasin the genre of Nasir al-DIn
Shah's travel diaries, but it exploited more fully the idiom of the people and their
aptitude for apposite verse citations, and wasaltogether more sophisticated than
the royal travel diaries.
Also intended to teach students colloquial Persian was the first printed
edition of, as is now known, Mirza Habib of Isfahan's skilful adaptation of
Morier's picaresque romance, The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan.81 The
translator, who belonged to the team of reformers and translators engaged on
the Persian newspaper, Akhtar, in Istanbul, achieved what Bahar, in his study of
Persian prose styles, considered a perfect combination of old and new stylistic
conventions. This blending of "the simple and contrived" was, he thought, a
masterpiece of the century.88 It wasalso apolitical satire which Iranians accepted
as such until it became known that it was not the invention of a compatriot but
originated from what they regarded as an English author's skit on their ways.89

Zain al- Abidin ofMaragha and Mirza Habib of Isfahan were followed, as
pioneers in notable efforts to establish popular idiom as legitimate in literature,
by Sayyid Muhammad All Jamalzada with his collection of verbal caricatures
and short stories in Yakl Bud Yakl Nabud, itself a folk phrase equivalent to
"Once upon a time". This collection was published inBerlin in 1921 and has
several times been reprinted in Iran. Its first story, Farsi Shikar ast, "Persian is
Sugar", mimicked the various idioms characteristic ofdifferent types in the
Iranian community. Inhis preface the author declared the intention to make
Persian prose part of that "literary democracy" which those authors who had
only written for "the learned and men of letters" had evaded. He called for the
avoidance of takalluf, strained literary embellishment. The majority of sub
sequent writers have followed this call, even to the extent of risking allowing the
use of sought-after colloquialisms itself to become a kind of takalluf, but
naturally this criticism does not apply to the genuine artists among later writers.
Jamalzada's father had been a popular preacher, the more forceful for his use
of language which the people understood: their own.90 Jamalzada's abiding
interest in itresulted in his dictionary of popular speech, the Farhang-i l^ughat-i
"Amiyana. In the introduction he cites numerous examples from early classical
authors toprove that words preserved inordinary speech and which modern
writers have retrieved for literature were unhestitatingly used by great artists
before the literary language was corrupted by sometimes excessive
arabicisation.
Sadiq Hidayat, Sadiq Chubak, Buzurg Alavi and Jalal Al-i Ahmad, to name
the major innovators inprose between the 1930s and mid-1950s, were fully
conversant with classical literature and the first two have mentioned a "Mirror
for Princes", the prose-work, Qabusnama, written in 1082, asa model. Mean
while, asfor poetry, sosplendidly did the ancient poets manipulate intricate
traditional patterns of imagery and metre, that thedegree to which their
language was in fact colloquial is often obscured. Also, in the longer term,
modern prose writers' innovation was less in language than in the subject-matter
and genres oftheir works, although the return tothe spoken language was a
major distinguishing feature oftheir work.
Futhermore, in common with all modern writers, in prose and poetry, they
were concerned with the individual conscience and the individual's plight under
the pressures of the times, which were exacerbated for Iranians by the circum
stances of a society undergoing transition and seldom free. Abstractions based

LITERATURE
on what might be beyond the terrestrial present were not primarily part of their
stock-in-trade, although there were exceptions and great artists remained too
Iranian not to reflect the universal in the particular. This reflection is, of course,
the hallmark of great art, and Hidayat and Chubak both place episodes and
characters in a timeless world reminiscent of that of the Persian miniature. They
thus do what poets did before the art of the miniature came to maturity: provide
in words the visual images and a translucent quality of environment which are
inseparable from the Persian miniature. The principal character in Hidayat's
novella, Buf-i Kur, "The Blind Owl", is himself a miniaturist. He paints the
single miniature-style picture of a scene which comes to life to haunt him, as well
as providing the only motif with which he decorates lacquer pen-boxes.
None of this means that these writers were unengaged by the sublunary
world they lived in and found hard to bear. It was a world which, in Iran's
modern political conditions, they could hardly escape unless, as Hidayat did in
1951, they took their own lives or, like Jamalzada, spent their lives abroad, as
also Buzurg Alavi, a Marxist, has done since 1953. 1953 was the year when the
comparatively liberal period begun in 1941 ended. It was in this period that these
writers came into their own. Hidayat's words in his Payam-i Kafka, "Message of
Kafka", are eloquent on the damage done to the human spirit during the
dictatorship of Riza Shah which ended in 1941. This essay was an introduction
to a Persian translation, by Hasan Qa°imiyan, of Kafka's The Penal Colony^
published in 1947. Hidayat depicts the negation of individual human dignity — in
an age when Iranian writers were subordinating literary conventions and form
to the service of individualistic expression — as being "the sign of our time that
the dignity of the human personality has no place: the age is, as are its laws,
impersonal, its heart as of stone . . . Yet on arrest, 'in the name of these laws', we
die like dogs, neither executioner nor victim making a sound. Because he has to
gasp for air all his life, panting for breath is the man of today's only way out."
Writers who succeeded in coming to terms with the period of Riza Shah were
All Dashtl and Muhammad Hijazl. The former, a journalist who founded the
paper, Shafaq-iSurkh, "Red Twilight", in 1921, was imprisoned in the same year.
He learnt a lesson, wrote his first book on his "Prison Days", and survived
under the two Pahlavi Shahs as a fashionable novelist and writer of light-weight
books about famous Persian poets, until after the 1979 revolution he died,
saddened and harrassed after subjection to another ordeal by those who had just
seized power from the second Pahlavi ruler. Buzurg cAlavi's encounter with the
authorities, under the provisions of a law of 1931 against communists, was more
serious than Dashti's of 1921. Alavi suffered confinement, which not all the

fifty-three men incarcerated with him survived, from 1937 until 1941. One of his
most beautifully written works, in which he used to telling effect the music of
the Persian tongue, is Varaq-paraha-yiZindan^"Scattered Pages from Prison".
He has remained a serious writer, principally of short stories but also a novel and
an epistolatory work offiction, and will no doubt produce more.
Hijazi was a man who not only survived under a regime suspicious of
authors, but served as head of the Press section of Riza Shah's Organization for
the Guidance of Thoughts — its actual name — and won a literary prize sponsored
by this Shah's successor. Nevertheless, good judges respect this urbane novelist
and essayist, who saw himself as an aloof Montaigne of the Iranian literary scene,
for the well-poised diction through which he became an exemplary stylistof
polite letters. Heand Dashti belonged to theschool of Mushfiq Kazimi,
Jahangir Jallll and Muhammad Mascud Dihati, which used the novel towrite
about the role of women in an era when their unveiling, by Riza Shah's decree,
had brought into the open the possibilities of their influence, as well as aspects of
both their wiles and their degradation. Hijazi was more concerned with female
guile and depicted women in a selfish, petulant guise. Dashti used them as
romantic ifdisturbing objects of attraction for amorous philanderers insmart
society. The others of this school were concerned with prostitution until, not
long before he was murdered, Mascud tackled the theme of the Iranian student
returned from abroad, with a foreign wife or sweetheart incompatible with
Iranian life, in which the foreign-trained student himself also found no place. He
had something ofsocial importance tosay, and used the spoken languageof
Tehran inwhich tosay it.
These novels of the thirties were received with an eagerness probably in part
attributable to the newness of their treatment of sex. They also provided a relief
from the voluminous historical romances, mostly based, however tenuously,
upon Iran's pre-Islamic past, produced by authors whose leading exponents
were Musa NasrI, Hasan Badlc and Sancatlzada Kirmani. The last outlived the
other two and was not averse to glorifying Iran's ancient past in a manner
consonant with Pahlavi policy. The other works alluded to above, devotedin
their different ways to contemporary society, pushed these romances out of the
forefront of attention. The importance of many of the works concerning
contemporary social issues would ina final analysis lie more intheir valueas
commentaries on asociety in transitional turmoils than as literature. Jalal Al-i
Ahmad was abetter artist than some. His Mudir-i Madrasa, "School Headmas

scene;91 but it was he who explicitly treated the problem of a region exploited,
humiliated and misled by western hegemony, in his Gharb^adagJ, "Being West
struck", published in 1962, seven years before his death.
Perhaps the episodic nature of the Iranian view of life, an incidental corrup
tion measured against the light of Eternity, impaired the success of the novel.
One of Balzacian proportions, andother qualities reminiscent of Balzac, was CA1T
Muhammad Afghani's Shauhar-i Ahu Khartum^ "Mrs Arm's Husband", pub
lished in September 1961. It is a remarkable excursion into small-town life and
the seduction, by a girl younger than his wife, of a middle-aged baker; but ithas
had no sequel of the same power. That it wasby a mansaid to have been an army
officer, but imprisoned in the post-195 3 purge of young officers alleged to hold
leftist views, gives this book another mark of uniqueness. Thearmy nurtured by
the two Pahlavl Shahs was seen as a means of spreading education, but it seems
to have cradled few creative writers.
The eternal themes of Good and Evil were the chosen topic of a short but
surprisingly precocious as well as beautiful book by a young writer named Taqi
MudarrisI, kinsman to menof former eminence both as leaders in the Constitu
tional Movement and for learning. The book, referring, somewhat enigmati
cally, to Jecholiah of the Old Testament, was called Yakutiya va Tanha'1-yi U,
"Jecholiah and Her Loneliness". Mudarissi's two later novels date from 1986
and 1989. Hidayat and Chubak both dealt with individuals outside themselves,
with the notable exception of Hidayat's Buf-i Kur\ individuals into whose
feelings they had the knack of totally entering, and whom they made speak and
respond to situations as such people would in life. Individuals whom they left as
memorable characters and, with the assured touch of great artists, endowed
with traits by which they could be universally recognized as revealing some
thing that might be part of everyone. Chubak's kingdom was not restricted to
humans. He shows an empathy with animals reminiscent of that shown by D.H.
Lawrence in certain of his poems.
Lack of space precludes further discussion of these andother prose-writers of
modern Iran,92 to include study both of foreign and inherited influences and to
demonstrate how influences from abroad were frequently active more as
catalysts than as sources of inspiration. Given an environment in which the
Iranian artist could operate effectively, foreign examples would be needed only

to afford him theexcitement of finding a commonwealth of craftsmen who
strove for theeffects he sought, and who were attempting to do justice to
perceptions like his own. These remarks atleast apply tothose modern Iranian
writers whose work will live, as will that of such poets as LahutI, Shamlu,
Nadirpur, Parvin Ftisami, Farrukhzad, Nima; but reliable judges agree that it is
probably too early toattempt any general assessment ofthe more recent poets'
very idiosyncratic contribution to the Iranian Parnassus. Among the modern
poets who merit notice are three women. Parvin Ttisami, born in 1910, belongs
to the earlier school which used traditional forms, and was a scholarly person.
Zhala SultanI, who in 1986 was still publishing, in Moscow, is a poet of delicacy
who, while using new forms, evinces theresponse to nature which, with a
freshness and congenial descriptive power, was afeature of the Persian poets of
the 10th tothe 12th centuries. Finally, Furugh Farrukhzad, who died in 1966,
produced poems of a passionate sincerity which were the poignant expression of
a deeply sensitive person's sense of alienation in the modern world, and modern
Tehran in particular. These poems have placed her, after amere fifteen years of
literary activity, among poets of the first rank.
The poet's isolation, already alluded to in thecontext of the break with
tradition, is significant for reasons a great deal more fundamental than the
stylistic innovations which estranged him from the majority of his compatriots
and made him an inhabitant of a "peninsula of intellectuals". For the poets of the
most recent schools have all, either in politically motivated poems of bitter
protest orthose of searching introspection, made the burden of their utterance
the intolerability of cultural betrayal, materialism, imposed ideology andthe
glorification of goals alien to the deepest instincts of their people. Their isolation
in an Iran dragooned in directions distant from the cherished spiritual values of
which Iranian poets for ages had been the exquisite exponents, has been
inevitable. The historian and polemicist against religion and Sufism, Ahmad
Kasravi (1890-1946), has not been followed inhis iconoclastic treatment of the
great poets of the 13 th to 15 th centuries, although he remains respected as a fine
historian. Instead, the poets ofthe sixties began once more to acknowledge a
debt to an almost overwhelming tradition from which they had sufficiently freed
themselves, thanks chiefly to Nima's example, forit to benolonger stifling.
Since they were no longer baffled by forms and by stereotypes ofimagery,for
variations within and on which, even had they been in their power, they saw no
further scope, the modern poets were free todiscover consolation and kindred
spirits inthe poets of the past, especially Hafiz. They had to develop techniques
which would not inhibit poets in search of a kind of escape from a disillusioning

world different from that adopted by the ancient poets. The intricate patterns of
the latter's poetry were part of their particular answer to the chaos of the
wilderness, and their voices were not muffled by a sense of the individual's sole
responsibility for personal failure, but clear in their questioning of Fate, and of a
God in Whom they still believed. The moderns had to find themselves and then
bear with lonely courage the self-knowledge they found. Furiigh Farrukhzad is
remarkable for her expression of this resolution.93

CHAPTER 2 3
PERSIAN PAINTING UNDER THE ZAND AND
QAjAR DYNASTIES
During the late 17th and early 18th centuries Persian painting was passing
through a difficult stage. Just as in the Mongol period of the 14th century
Persian artists were busy absorbing Chinese ideas and conventions, so inour
period they were struggling toaccommodate themselves tothe artistic canonsof
Europe. Wecannot blame them, however deplorable the tendency mayseem;
increasing contact with Europe made such a development inevitable. It was,
indeed, going on simultaneously all over the East, and leaving its mark on
various Asian schools of painting. In the hermit empire of Japan European
scientific books andengravings of all kinds were eagerly sought and smuggled
in through theDutch traders in theface ofofficial disapproval. By the end of the
18th century they were being regurgitated in Japanese popular form, and
landscape prints attempting European perspective and atmospheric effects were
designed by Toyoharu, Hokuju, and others. In China the same influences
flowed into theopen port of Canton, where many Chinese painters were busily
producing pictures for thewestern market (a side-line to theteatrade) in which
the native style is considerably modified by European ideas of perspective,
modelling, anddrapery. They vary enormously in quality, andwere generally
produced in series — court costumes, trades, boats on the Yang-tze, and even
tortures — butno educated Chinaman of the time would have regarded them as
true paintings. InIndia, too, the period 175o—185 owas the heyday of "Company
Painting", usually practised under direct English patronage, and devoted to the
illustration of local types, castes, religious festivals, fauna, flora, and topogra
phy, in a more or less westernized style.
But whilst in Japan, China, and India the traditional classical styles of
painting continued in spite of the westernizing tendencies of a minority, in
Persia European influences, once introduced, were all-pervading. The Persians,
with their alert and sprightly genius, were always ready for something new.
They paid lip-service to thepast in their affection for theheroes of the national
epic, butin practice themonuments of their former greatness were allowed to
decay, or were even actively destroyed andplundered — as by Zill al-Sultan,the
notorious governor ofIsfahan atthe end ofthe last century, inwhose time many

fine palaces were thrown down and their contents sold piecemeal to the
Armenian merchants, and the magnificent avenues of trees lining the Chahar
Bagh were chopped upforbuilding-materials and firewood. The Chinese and
Japanese, on the contrary, absorbed apractical reverence for the past with their
mother's milk; heirlooms were handed down, collections of antiques were
formed, scholarly treatises were written on antiquarian subjects, and ancient
styles were copied and reproduced in every branch of art. In India the prolifera
tion of independent princely courts that accompanied the break-up of the
Mughul empire had asimilar stabilizing effect on the styles of painting practised
under their patronage, which remained unaffected by thewesternizing styles
prevalent inthe East India Company's trading and administrative centres. But
we shall see that even inPersia the imported European conventions were really
no more than a veneer under which the paintings ofthe Zand and Qajar court
artists remained obstinately Persian in spirit and essence.
Every new movement in Persian painting can be associated with or attributed
to a particular master. Ahmad Musa, who successfully absorbed new Chinese
ideas into the old native tradition, and so "unveiled the face of painting" inthe
early 14th century; Bihzad, who infused new life, naturalism and individuality
into theTimurid court style a hundred and fifty years later, thus laying the
foundations ofthe sumptuous art ofTabriz under Shah Tahmasp; and Riza,to
whom can be traced the masterly calligraphic style of wilting youths and
languorous maidens that became universal under Shah cAbbas I and II. So it is
with the style under consideration. It seems to have been inaugurated by
Muhammad Zaman, son of Hajji Yusuf, whose work is founded on Flemish
originals, which presumably reached Iran in theform of prints; andit was
quickly taken upbyShaikh cAbbasI, CA1I Quli Jabbadar, cAli Naqi, and others
(pi. 4).1 Meanwhile the native tradition ofpainting had degenerated consider
ably since the distinguished work ofRiza and his contemporaries, and though
one ortwo good artists, such as Muhammad Qasim and Mucln, were still active
in the years 1650—80, much ofthe work ofthis period consists ofrather lifeless
and mechanical imitations ofthe "Riza style". In fact bythe time Muhammad
Zaman appeared Persian painting was ready foran artist of genius to give it
some new rejuvenating twist that might save it from stagnation for another
century ortwo. Though Muhammad Zaman was not anartist ofthe statureof
Ahmad Musa or Bihzad, the changes he introduced were far more sweeping and
fundamental than anyof his predecessors'; themodelling, perspective,and
1 The most recent and authoritative treatment ofthe problems surrounding Muhammad Zaman
is bythe Russian scholar A.Ivanov in Album of Indian and Persian Miniatures of the XVI-XVlIIth Centuries.

2AND AND QAJAR PAINTING
classical anatomy of the Flemish schools were entirely foreign to the Persian
tradition. Nevertheless the new style "caught on" quickly by virtue of its novel
and (to the Persians) exotic character, and before the end ofthe century it had
become completely dominant in court painting, though the long-lived Mucin
and one or two others continued to work in thestyle of his master Riza.
However it was not only the style of Persian painting that was changing.In
the classical period of the art the best work of the Persian painters was virtually
confined to manuscript illustration; but in our period the student must take
account ofoil-paintings, flower-paintings, portraits from life, painted lacquer
and enamel, eglomise (behind glass) painting, and, towards the middle of the 19th
century, lithographed book-illustrations. No 18th-century manuscript exists, so
far as we know atpresent, whose miniatures are better than apoor second class
(excepting one or two at the very beginning of the Qajar period), and even in the
more settled conditions of the 19th century really fine illustrated manuscripts are
of the greatest rarity. The emphasis was on portraits, and for the first time since
the Arab conquest, more than a thousand years earlier, court artists were
required to represent their royal patrons life-size, and the monarch's portrait
appeared on thecoinage. The earliest examples of this new trend, in direct
imitation of the normal European practice of life-size portraits, are probably the
pictures ofShah Abbas II and his chief wife which were shown at Burlington
House in 1931 {Catalogue Nos. 761, 768); they may even have been the workof
Muhammad Zaman himself. In the 18th century the favourite subjects were,
naturally enough, Nadir Shah and Karlm Khan Zand. At least two good life-size
oil portraits ofNadir Shah may be accepted ascontemporary: (i) Victoria and
Albert Museum No. I.M. 20-1919, seated. This painting is especially noteworthy
for thevery fine rendering of the gold enamelled sword-mounts andother
accessories, (ii)India Office collection, Foster (1924), No. 44. Three-quarter
length, standing (pi. 5). Foster considered this to bebythe same hand as the
Victoria and Albert portrait, but this is not necessarily so. (The portrait
reproduced in Martin\ 11.168, signed by Muhammad Panah with the cryptic date
"24", isalmost certainly Indian work.) The Europeanizing style ofthese two
portraits is of a different type from that found in thework of Muhammad
Zaman, suggesting that the artist(s) had studied contemporary European por
traits, possibly inIndia. It isa straightforward portrait style, retaining nothing
of the meticulous western landscape background and details beloved of
Muhammad Zaman.
The only oasis of peace and prosperity in Persia during the 18th century was
at Shiraz under the strong but benevolent rule of Karlm Khan Zand (1750—79).
This was the time and place ofthe formation of the style that came to its full

blossoming under Fath cAli Shah fifty years later, and the best examples ofit at
this early stage are probably those (at least until recently) tobe seen in that city,in
the Pars Museum and the Haft Tan pavilion. Karim Khan was a great builder,
and many of his buildings were adorned with paintings.2 The Pars Museum itself
was housed in a pavilion built forhis own use, and contains a magnificent oil
painting ofhis court signed by Ja far, of whom, alas, nothing else isknown. The
characterization ofKarim Khan himself is superb, as he sits atease, smoking his
qalyanand looking knowingly out ofthe picture towards the spectator, who has
the impression that the great man is almost winking at him in contempt of the
stiffly formal courtiers by whom he is surrounded (pi. ic).
But the foremost exponent of the style at this time seems to have been
Muhammad Sadiq who, like most ofhis successors, worked invarious media
oils, miniature painting, and lacquer. His large-scale works survive in the Pars
Museum and in the Amery Collection;3 and a number of pieces of painted
lacquer bear his signature (pi. 8), but some of these are obviously unacceptable as
authentic. Fine miniatures bySadiq are also sometimes encountered. His usual
signature takes the form ofan invocation, YaSadiqal-wdday " O he who speaks
truly in his promise", one among many commonly on the lips of devout
Muslims. This form of punning invocation-signature seems to have become
popular from the late 17th century onwards; it may have originated towards the
end of the Safavid period with Muhammad Zaman, whose YaSahib al-Zaman,
" O Lord ofTime" (normally addressed to CA1T) isfound onsome ofhis works,
and was imitated by an early 19th-century painter of the same name. Sadiq's
work is meticulous in execution, and his faces have a markedly European cast,
founded, we may suppose, on European originals of his own period, and thus
differing considerably from those of the late Safavid Europeanizers, whose
models were 17th-century Flemish. His dates are uncertain, but he seems tohave
had along working life spanning the second half of the 18th century. On the one
hand Texier reports a current tradition that in 1738 he executed the large mural
in the Chihil Sutun atIsfahan depicting the victory of Nadir Shah atKarnal over
the Mughul Emperor Muhammad Shah;4 and on theother, wehave lacquer
pieces bearing his signature coupled with dates inthe last decade of the century.5

century. His surviving work, all inpainted lacquer, isofvery high quality but
somewhat limited in scope, consisting almost invariably of close-set flower
designs ona black ground among which are set medallions exquisitely painted
with birds. Only one human representation, alovely girl's head, has so far been
noted from his brush; the face is closer to Muhammad Zaman than to Sadiq,
although the date is 1169/1756 (pis. 10, 11). He signed with apunning formula,
%i' bdd-iMuhammad A/JAshrafast, "After Muhammad, cAli is the noblest", and
his dated work spans the period 1740—56.
The political situation between the death of Karim Khan in 1779 andthe
accession of the first Qajar monarch, Agha Muhammad Shah, in 1795was
extremely confused, and there was noopportunity for schools of painting to
flourish anddevelop under settled patronage. Buteven before their rise to
supreme power the Qajars were toa limited extent patrons ofthe arts, and had
captured the services ofat least one painter who set a high standard for the first
generation of their rule. Mirza Baba has signed a very fine small drawing of a
dragon andphoenix, formerly in the Pozzi collection, andhasdated it "at
Astarabad" 1203/1789. Astarabad was the seat ofthe Qajar family during their
struggle for the throne. Once the dynasty wasestablished he wasable to
undertake works of greater importance and on a larger scale. Fath AllShah
made him naqqash-bashi", or Painter Laureate, at the beginning of his reign, and he
was accordingly entrusted with important commissions intended to diffuse a
sense ofthe majesty of the King ofKings among the distant nations ofEurope.
These included the magnificent manuscript of the King's own Divan, which was
taken to England by his ambassador Abu3l-Hasan Khan (the original of Morier's
"Hajji Baba of Ispahan") as apresent to his "brother" George III, and is nowin
the Royal Library at Windsor Castle.6 The beautifully painted lacquer covers,
the lavish illuminations and marginal decorations, and twofine miniature
portraits of Fath All Shah himself (pi. 9) and of his uncle and predecessor, Agha
Muhammad Shah, are all the work of Mirza Baba; the only part of the
manuscript for which he was not responsible isthe text, which isinthe elegant
calligraphy of Muhammad Mahdl, the Royal Scribe. Mirza Baba also painted the
superb life-size portrait of Fath cAli Shah, dated 1213/1799, which was presented
to the East India Company in 1806 andnow hangs in the Commonwealth
Relations Office (pi. 12).7 Like most ofthe best artists ofhis time, Mirza Baba
showed his versatility inthe various available media. Some ofhis achievements

in oils, miniature (pi. 13*2), illumination, andpainted lacquer (pi. 13^) have
already been noted, but he also worked inpainted enamel and eglomise. Virtually
nothing is known of him beyond his actual works. Sir William Ouseley notes
that heand other members of the Embassy staff were assigned quarters in the
house formerly belonging to a certain MIrza Baba, who had recently paidthe
supreme penalty for thecrime of embezzlement, butgives no indication of
whether ornot this was the painter ofthat name.8 The latter's latest work so far
noted bears the date 1225/1810, which may perhaps beadvanced in support of
the identification; theEmbassy arrived in Tehran in 1811.
Fath All Shah's inordinate vanity and,it must be admitted, strikingly
handsome appearance ensured full employment for anypainter who could
convey an adequately resplendent impression of the royal person. "I never
before had beheld anything like such perfect majesty . . . His face seemed
exceedingly pale, of a polished marble hue; with the finest contour of features;
and eyes dark, brilliant, andpiercing" wrote Sir Robert KerPorter.9 Mirza
Baba's chief rivals in this field of royal portraiture were Mihr All, Abd-Allah
Khan, and Muhammad Hasan Khan. The first ofthese seems to have made his
debut with alife-size seated portrait of the King sent as apresent tothe Amirsof
Sind in 1800. That, at least, is a possible inference from (i)Sir John Malcolm's
story of the local governor andvillagers prostrating themselves before the
securely packed and boxed-up portrait when it was being embarked forSind at
Bushire,10 and (ii) a large portrait of Fath AllShah, signed by Mihr All and
dated 1212/1798, in theVictoria Hall, Calcutta (pi. 14a). The most probable
explanation of its presence there seems tobe that itwas brought back among the
spoils of the Sind War of1843. Mihr All followed this with two fine portraits for
the Hall of the Marble Throne inthe Gulistan Palace, dated 1218/1803 and 1219/
1804 respectively, and another entrusted toNapoleon's envoy, M. Jaubert, as a
present for the Emperor. This isnow inthe Museum ofthe Palace of Versailles
(pi. 14^).n Altogether nine ofthese life-size portraits ofthe King byMihr All
have been noted, the latest being dated 1230/1815. By farthe finest shows Fath
All Shah full-length, standing, wearing his huge crown (compared by Texier12
to the crowns of the Achaemenids), clad in a gorgeous robe of flowered gold
brocade, andholding a jewelled staff of majesty surmounted by Solomon's

ficent painting was formerly the showpiece ofthe Amery Collection, and may
possibly be the one sent as apresent tothe Prince Regent in 1812; the reception
of three pictures "including a portrait of the Emperor fsc.Fath cAli Shah]
himself is recorded in the Carlton House day-book, but they are no longer to be
found in theroyal collection.14 Between 1798 and1805 Mihr cAli's style and
drawing improved enormously; his early portraits give Fath CA1I Shah a squat
neck andround face, but in thelater ones theproportions aremuch more
pleasing and, incidentally, flattering (pi. 65).
Like many of his colleagues, Mihr CA1I was also employed onpaintings to
cover the interior walls of palaces. SirWilliam Ouseley saw a series of "por
traits" of early Persian kings recently painted by him in apalace at Isfahan: "The
portraits of many ancient kings, represented of the natural size, contribute to
embellish this palace. They have been painted within ten or twelve years by a
celebrated artist, Mihr CA1I of Tehran; who has not only marked each picture
with his own name, but considerately added the title ofeach illustrious person
age whom heintended to delineate. This alone enables the spectator to distin
guish Feridun, Nushiravan and others from Iscander or Alexander the Great,
whose face, dress, andarms are, most probably, the same that Mihr cAli's
imagination would have assigned to anyPersian prince of the last fifty or
hundred years."15
Mihr eAlI may also have been responsible for an enormous canvas depicting
Fath All Shah, crowned and bejewelled, hunting in the company of a number of
his sons. This painting was formerly in theIndia Office collection, butwas
handed over to the Government of India in 1929, and now hangs in Rashtrapati
Bhavan, the former Viceroy's residence inNew Delhi.16 It isby all accountsan
impressive piece of work, and a passage in Morier's "Hajji Baba in England"
may perhaps indicate that itwas one ofthe pictures sent tothe Prince Regentin
1812. Morier is describing how the gifts intended for the King of England were
paraded for inspection by Fath CA1IShah before the departure of his ambassador
from Tehran: "The painter-in-chief was then ordered to exhibit the portrait,
which was indeed a great and immortal effort ofart. It represented the shah in
the chase, in the very act of piercing an antelope with aspear on the fullest speed
of his horse, with the crown on his head, his magnificent armlets buckled tohis

arm and dressed inall the state jewels. The painter, with inimitable ingenuity,
had contrived to introduce forty of his sons, like so many stars in the firmament
blazing in different constellated groups; but forwant of room hecould not
introduce the rest."17 One last glimpse ofthe great Mihr All isprovided bya
small water-colour study of a man's head, inscribed as having been executed by
him in 1829 asa model forhis pupil Abu'l-Hasan Khan Ghaffarl who, better
known by his proud title of Sant al-Mulk ("Painter of the Kingdom"), became
the foremost Persian painter in the middle years of the 19th century.18 He was a
worthy pupil of such a master.
Abd-Allah Khan grew old in the service of the Qajar dynasty. Murdoch
Smith says that he died at a great age at the beginning of the reign of Nasir al-Din
Shah, that is, about 1848.19 His greatest achievement was the celebrated mural
covering three sides of the Nigaristan Palace interior (pis. 16, 17).On the shorter
wall at the end was depicted Fath CA1I Shah enthroned in state, surrounded by a
group of his sons; below him were siiighulams carrying the royal shield, sword,
and other appurtenances. Down each of the side-walls was a double row of
courtiers (above) and foreign ambassadors (below), the latter including, onone
side, Sir Gore Ouseley, Sir Harford Jones, and Sir John Malcolm, and, on the
other, Napoleon's envoys General Gardane and MM. Jaubert and Jouannin.
The whole composition comprised no less than 118 full-length life-size figures.
It is described bymost of the 19th-century European travellers, bysome of
whom itwasattributed to Muhammad Hasan Khan; but E.G. Browne, who saw
it during his "Year amongst the Persians", quotes the inscription below the
picture stating that it was executed by cAbd-Allah Khan in 1812—13, and his
circumstantial statement may be unreservedly accepted.20 The original painting
has long since disappeared, but a facsimile, made in 1904, is said to beinthe
Foreign Ministry at Tehran. Smaller copies were sometimes made for interested
visitors, one of which was engraved inLondon in 1834.21 Among anumber of
royal and princely portraits ascribed to cAbd-Allah Khan the best is aportrait of
Fath AIT Shah standing , in a red robe and bejewelled astrakhan cap, in the
Victoria and Albert Museum (No. 707—1876). He also executed frescoes of the

courts of Fath All Shah and his predecessor Aqa Muhammad Shah on the walls
of the palace of Karaj. These were seen byLady Sheil in the 1850s, and she
comments, "The likenesses of the chiefs are said to be excellent, and that of Agha
Mahommed Khan inimitable. The former are fine, sturdy, determined-looking
warriors. Agha Mahommed looks like afiend. The atrocious, cold, calculating
ferocity which marked the man isstamped on his countenance."22 Abd-Allah
Khan himself appears, very briefly, inone traveller's narrative, that of William
Price, who merely notes that on 12 May 1812 he "called upon Akabdool [sc. Aqa
Abd-Allah (Khan)] Nakosh-bashee, head painter to the Shah; he shewed
several portraits of the royal family, khans, &c."23
Muhammad Hasan Khan was of a slightly lesser stature than the three court
painters so far discussed (pi. 15). But his work iscompetent and conscientious,
and in a set of three portraits of princes, one with a child, in the Amery
collection, he reaches ahigh level.24 The same collection includes apainting of
Shaikh Sancan and theChristian maiden,25 bearing hissignature; this was a
favourite subject for illustration inZand and Qajar times, partly, one suspects,
because it afforded an opportunity of portraying Europeans (the Christian
maiden and her entourage) in which the artists of the period obviously took
great delight. There are also several pictures ofgirls inwhich his hand maybe
detected from his soft method of rendering the features, afondness for asort of
foxy red, and a vase of flowers which is almost a trademark.26 Muhammad Hasan
Khan has also left some excellent miniature paintings, usually in the form of
monochrome portraits; good examples ofthese are inthe Museum ofDecora
tive Arts, Tehran (pi. 19), and the Musee d'Art et d'Histoire, Geneva (Pozzi
Collection, Cat. No. 213).
One other artist ofthe early part ofFath All Shah's reign deserves notice,
though nothing whatever is known ofhim personally, and only one composi
tion by him, and that in afragmentary state, is known to have survived - Abu3l
Qasim. He painted three of the most outstanding pictures of girls in the Amery
Collection (pi. 18) and a portrait of the King seated, in another private
collection.27 One of the former bears his signature and the date 1231/1816. The
fact that all these have the same continuous architectural background and are on
the same scale — a little less than life-size — makes it almost certain that they all
originally formed asingle long composition, of Fath All Shah entertained with

music and dancing by agroup of his ladies. Indeed, this may well have been the
painting described byBinning asadorning the house heoccupied at Shlraz:
"The upper part of the wall isoccupied by a representation ofhis late majesty
Fat'h Alee Shah sitting instate, and attended by ten ladies. The figures, which
extend round three sides ofthe room, are nearly aslarge aslife, and gaudily
coloured. Whether they are good likenesses ornot, I cannot pretend tosay."28
This portrait ofthe King, though certainly well painted, does not stand upto
those byMirza Baba or Mihr CA1I, but the girls are remarkable, carrying the
Persian ideal of feminine beauty to its utmost extreme. Their coiffures are
elaborate, they are covered with jewels, and their faces have an insinuating and
languorous beauty that sets them ina class by themselves. It isindeed strange
that no other works of this talented and original artist appear to have survived.
Among the second generation ofcourt painters, active towards the end of
Fath cAli Shah's reign and during that of his grandson and successor Muhammad
Shah, the best was probably Ahmad who,to judge from his early style, may well
have been a pupil of Mihr CA1I. Two fine portraits of the King carry his
signature. One, which hung inthe British Embassy at Tehran for well over a
century, is dated 1238/1823 (pi. 20);29 the King sits on ajewelled carpet with an
elaborate qalyanbeside him.The other shows him in armour seated on the Takht-i
Nadiri, a splendid throne of chair-form (not the usual platform-like Persian
takhf) which is still to be seen, together with the jewelled shield he is represented
carrying, in theCrown Jewels collection; unfortunately theface has been
completely repainted. This portrait, which isdated 1234/1819, was lent by the
late SirCharles Marling to theInternational Exhibition of Persian Art at
Burlington House in 1931, when it was reproduced in the Souvenir and the
signature was wrongly read as "Asad" in the Catalogue.30 These are both early
works; his later style became much more European, as witness a large painting
dated 1260/1844 ofMuhammad Shah reviewing his troops, inthe Hall of the
Marble Throne (Gulistan Palace), and a fine bust-portrait of the same monarch,
dated two years later, in the Firuz collection, Tehran.
Another artist ofthis time who stands out as an individual may have been
named Muhammad. A painting of a girl byhim in the Foroughi collection,
Tehran, bears the inscription YaMuhammad, presumably one ofthe punning
invocation-signatures already noticed, accompanied by the date 1258/1842 (pi.

2\d)?x His style is perhaps the easiest to pick out amongst all the Qajar painters,
and theplump moon-faced girls in which he delighted are reminiscent of Renoir;
his male figures are less successful.32
Sayyid Mirza makes a third in this second generation group. His most
impressive work, now in the Firuz collection, Tehran, is avery large group of
Fath CA1IShah enthroned and attended by his sons and courtiers; it was formerly
in theHasht Bihisht palace at Isfahan, and can be clearly seen in Coste's
engraving (pi. nb).32> Two rather stiff portraits of princes by himare reproduced
by Schulz,34 but all his charm and skill come out in the Amery collection picture
of Yusuf, the biblical Joseph, represented as a handsome young Qajar nobleman
against a delightful landscape background.35 Sayyid Mirza wasalso an
outstanding painter in lacquer, and executed the front cover of the new binding
commissioned by Fath CA1TShah for the Nizami manuscript of Shah Tahmasp;
the subject is the favourite one of the King hunting with his sons, and the quality
of the work is superb (pi. 22).36
The back cover of the same binding, also portraying the King on a hunting
expedition, is signed by Muhammad Baqir (pi. 23).Unfortunately this seems to
have been a remarkably popular name amongst artists ofthe Zand and Qajar
periods, and paintings of various kinds so signed are found from the early 18th
century onwards.37 In this case, however, we know that the artist in question
worked under the patronage of the King himself. Beside this book-cover may be
placed a fine group of royal enamels signed Baqir (in such names as Muhammad
Baqir the first element was frequently omitted); making allowance for the
difference ofmedium, the styles are very similar, and as the best artists often
turned their hands toany kind ofpainting that might be required it may be
permissible, failing evidence to the contrary, to attribute both lacquer and
enamels to the same hand. Examples of Baqir's painted enamels arein the Crown
Jewels collection,38 and an extremely fine gold bowl, cover, saucer, and spoon,
enamelled with the Signs ofthe Zodiac, the Planets, and other astronomical/
31 This painting was reproduced on the cover oWOeil, Paris, November 1961.

astrological figures, and inscribed with adedicatory poem to Fath All Shah, is in
a private collection (pi. 66).39 On this latter piece Baqir uses the almost
unprecedented title oighulam-khana^ad which means, literally, "slave born inthe
household", but should be understood in the context to convey some such
meaning as"craftsman in the royal workshops". The only other occurrence of
this expression with an artist's signature so far noted is on thework ofAll,
another enamel-painter, very close to Baqir in both style and date. Hehas, in
fact, signed thefinest of all thepainted enamels in thePersian Crown Jewels
collection, a magnificent oval hand-mirror with handle ofcarved jade, andthe
back enamelled with a fine portrait ofthe King seated within a rich floral frame
(pi. 67).40 Hewas also responsible for a standing portrait of the King, dated
1233/1818, enamelled on thegold centre of a nephrite dish presented to the
Emperor Franz I in 1819 and now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.
The only other artist in painted enamel at this period who calls for special
mention is Muhammad Jafar, who seems to have been much employed on
objects intended forofficial presentation. Thus his signature is to befound on
the two massive gold enamel dishes presented byhis royal master to Sir Gore
Ouseley (dated 1228/1813) and to the East India Company (dated 1233/1818),
the latter now in theVictoria and Albert Museum (pi. 6).41 Healso executed
insignia of the Order of the Lion andSun, instituted in honour of Sir John
Malcolm. However a number ofother pieces — qalyati-bowls, snuff-boxes, etc.
bear his signature. His work is as fine as that of All and Baqir, but the drawing of
his faces tends tobe a little hard and formal. Ingeneral, Persian painted enamels
of the Qajar period are often the most attractive manifestations ofthe painter's
skill. Even so severe a critic as the Comte de Rochechouart ("quant aux
peintures que les Persans produisent eux-memes, c'est a faire grincer les dents")
was enchanted bythem, and compared them favourably with imported Swiss
enamels that he saw at thesame time.42
Painted lacquer by Sadiq, Mirza Baba, Mihr AIT, Baqir, and Sayyid Mirza has
already been mentioned; this art had reached a very high standard and achieved
enormous popularity during the reign of Fath All Shah, andfine pieces
mirror-cases, pen-boxes (qalamdan), caskets, spectacles-cases, and playing cards

2AND AND QAJAR PAINTING
William Ousely has described the enormous choice available, and the Comte de
Rochechouart, a very acute observer, has left a detailed account ofthe whole
process.43 Reduced toits essentials, this consisted incoating papier-mache (or,
less frequently, wood) with a fine gesso or plaster, upon whose surface the
design was painted in water-colours, the whole being finally covered with a
transparent lacquer or varnish, usually of a pale golden hue, which warmed and
enriched the whole effect. It ishardly necessary to point out that the process is
thus totally different from the art of lacquer as practised in China and Japan. One
family may be regarded as the foremost specialists in painted lacquer during the
early Qajar period. The head ofit was Najaf cAli, son ofa painter of Isfahan
named Aqa Baba; his dated work spans theperiod 1815—56, and he always signed
with the punning invocation Ya Shah-iNajaf. He was followed by his three sons
and younger brother, and between them they were responsible for much of the
finest lacquer produced in Iran down to about 1890.44
In painted lacquer as in other branches ofpainting the taste for European
mannerisms andsubjects continued unabated, but unfortunately the only
models normally available to the Persian painters at this time seem to have been
French and other prints of poor quality and often execrable taste, from which are
derived the dissipated young men in smoking-caps and dressing-gowns and the
young ladies simpering coquettishly under their poke-bonnets who form sucha
considerable proportion of the mid 19th-century Persian lacquer painter's
repertoire. Sometimes religious (Christian) subjects were incongruously at
tempted; the Holy Family in various garbled forms had been a popular theme for
mirror-cases since the 18th century, and Najaf himself produced a dignified St
Jerome (pi. 8), of which a number of inferior versions issued later from his
studio. One ofthe most remarkable pieces ofmid-19th century lacquer must
have been the qalamdan shown tothe traveller Hommaire de Hell by the artist
himself, whose name, alas, is not mentioned.45 Itwas unfinished at the time, but
was already adorned with lively miniature representations ofheaven and hell,
and awaited the addition of scenes from the life of Napoleon, "d'apres un tableau
francais", which were tocover its sides. But the most frequently encountered
designs on lacquer-work of all periods are variations on the rose and nightingale
{gul-bulbul) theme.

Muhammad Kazim (pis. 27,iSa, b), Jacfar, and Ahmad (pis. 28c,d), all excelled in
lacquer-painting, Ismacll indeed attaining the title of naqqash-bashl. His
masterpiece is a box or casket in the Bern Historical Museum, covered with
scenes of Muhammad Shah's siege of Herat, which contain literally hundreds of
tiny figures; itis dated 1282/1865 (pi. 24).46 Kazim's painted enamels (pi. 28)are
almost finer than his lacquer (pi. 27), and examples may beseen inthe Crown
Jewels collection;47 Jacfar also worked in both enamel and lacquer. It is, in fact,
largely owing to the work of this talented family that the third quarter of the 19th
century isthe most brilliant period in the history of Persian enamel and lacquer
painting. Anumber of their contemporaries were turning out lacquer of almost
equal quality, and one ofthem, Aqa Buzurg ofShlraz, deserves special notice.
He was anexcellent portraitist and miniaturist inthe style ofthe time, and his
finest piece is perhaps a qalamdan now in theMuseum of Decorative Arts,
Tehran, dated 1269/185 3 (pi. 29). Notonly is it painted with penetrating
portraits of all the ministers of Prince Farhad Mirza the Governor, but also — an
almost unique feature — with a self-portrait ofthe artist, modestly relegated to
the butt-end, showing him in the actof painting a qalamdan.48
Eg/omise, or under-glass painting, is a difficult technique. The paint being
applied behind the glass, the process has tobe executed inreverse, so to speak,
beginning with the highlights and other surface details, and finishing with the
background colour. The idea probably reached Persia inthe form of imported
examples from Germany, where the art was extensively practised. The Persian
painters attained great proficiency at it, and fine large portraits of Fath AH Shah
and his sons, painted ineglomise by Mihr All and others, can still be seen in the
Museum of Decorative Arts, Tehran, and elsewhere (pi. 30/?). One or two more
modest examples, representing girls, were exhibited on loan atthe Victoria and
Albert Museum. But as they are painted on thin sheets ofglass these paintings
are particularly vulnerable, and not very many have survived. A number of them
were seen mounted inniches in the audience-chamber ofthe palace byLieut.

ZAND AND QAJAR PAINTING
In the field ofpainting proper, and more particularly of portrait-painting,
Abu'l-Hasan Khan Ghaftari of Kashan is by far themost important figure
during the reign of Muhammad Shah and the early years of Nasir al-Din,49
though some fine work wasproduced by his contemporaries, especially
Muhammad Hasan Afshar (pi. $oa).50 As has been already noted, Abu3l-Hasan
had been a pupil ofMihr LA1I, and his early works show a remarkable gift for
merciless portraiture (pi. 31). He studied in Italy for two or three years,
returning in 185 o, when he was appointed naqqash-bashl. He spent the year 1853
designing and supervising the illustration of an enormous six-volume manu
script, now in the Gulistan Imperial Library, containing aPersian translation of
the "Arabian Nights". Throughout this manuscript pages of text alternate with
pages ofminiature painting, the latter numbering no less than 1134, and each
page carrying at least three miniatures (pi. 32).51 For this monumental task
Abu'l-Hasan organized a team of thirty-four painters, supplying the designs and
executing some of the best miniatures himself; some of his preliminary sketches
for them are inthe British Library (Or.49 3 8). Many ofthese miniatures are of
extremely high quality with vivid colouring and imaginative treatment;the
costumes and details are all, of course, those of mid-19th-century Iran. Four
years later heled his team in another major project: a set ofseven large wall
panels for the Nizamiyya Palace, modelled on the Nigaristan frescoes of cAbd
Allah Khan. These are now inthe Archaelogical Museum, Tehran, and depict
Nasir al-Din Shah, enthroned in state, surrounded bysons and courtiers and
attended by foreign ambassadors; each figure is alife-size and lively portrait, and
preliminary sketches for anumber ofthem are preserved inthe same museum.
The ambassadors include the Comte de Gobineau, whose classic Trois Annees en
Ask gives apenetrating picture of Iran at this time, but Mr Murray the English
envoy is excluded owing to the strained idations between Great Britain and Iran
following the brief Anglo-Persian w"ir of January—March 1857. Pace the Comte
de Rochechouart, who saw these paintings shortly after their installation ("rien
du monde de plus buffon que ces portraits"), the effect is impressive, more

especially ofthe central group with the dignified figure ofthe Shah himself, and
the execution is brilliant. In 1861 Abul-Hasan was given thetitle of San! al
Mulk ("Painter ofthe Kingdom") and appointed Director ofPrinting with the
special task of editing the Government weekly Ku^nama-yi Daulat-i'Allya-yilran,
printed by lithography and illustrated with portraits of princes, statesmen,
soldiers, and with representations of remarkable events (pi. 33/?). These are
among the finest products ofthe lithographic process tobe found inany Persian
publication. The journal continued toappear after Abu 1-Hasan's death in 1866,
but with a sadfalling-off in standards of production and draughtsmanship.
Lithographed books with illustrations had begun to appear in Persia in the
1840s. Many of them were little popular story-books whose illustrations,
though not without a disarming naivete and charm, are often crude and
incompetent. Better, though sometimes duller, work istobe found in illustrated
editions ofthe classics. All Quli ofKhuy was prominent inthis field; his Nizami
(Tehran, 1264/1848) and Shahnama (Tehran, 1265--7/1849-5o) are noteworthy,
the former containing a full-page illustration of various stages in the
lithographic process (pi. 33^).A later Tehran Shahnama (1308/1891) was
illustrated by the well-known lacquer-painter Mustafa (cf. pi. 8). But inthis field,
as in every other which he touched, Abu'l-Hasan hasno serious rivals.52
It may well be asked what was happening in the realm of manuscript
illustration and miniature painting ingeneral during this period. As has already
been indicated, Qajar miniature painting is usually seen at its best in painted
lacquer and enamels, but fine illustrated manuscripts areoccasionally encoun
tered. Mirza Baba's superb copy of the Divan of Fath CA1I Shah and A b u i
Hasan's monumental "Arabian Nights" have already been mentioned, but apart
from them it must be admitted that there islittle ofreally outstanding merit. The
Mahboubian Collection contains a fine Anvar-i Suhaill dated 1203/1789 (pro
duced under Qajar patronage, butbefore their accession to the throne) whose
exquisitely painted miniatures may be credibly attributed toMirza Baba, though
they are not signed. The glories ofFath "All Shah's reign and the exploits ofhis
forebears in their struggle for power against the Zands and others were
fulsomely celebrated in a voluminous epic, the Shahanshah-Nama, or "Book of
the King of Kings", byhis poet laureate, Saba (Fath cAli Khan). Four splendid
copies of this work are known, each containing fifty-odd miniatures of reason
ably good quality though of a rather routine character- mostly battle-scenes and
representations of the King enthroned - in the Majlis Library, Tehran (No.

15234), the Nationalbibliothek, Vienna (Fliigel, 639), the India Office Library
(Ethe, 901), andtheBodleian Library (Elliot 327), this last having been
presented by Fath CA1IShah toSir Gore Ouseley. Lastly we must note a very
remarkable Shahnama which used to be in the collection of Dr Vesal ofShiraz,
and was an heirloom in his family. The miniatures are dated between 1270/1854
and 1280/1864, and most of them are signed by the celebrated Shiraz artist Lutf
CA1I Khan (pi. 34^),but one or two are by Davari and Farhang, sons of the poet
Visal (orVesal), thelate owner's ancestor. Some of them areof startling
originality.
Lutf CA1T Khan was chiefly, and justly, famed forhis flower-paintings, a
favourite branch of the miniaturist's art since Safavid times; they were as a rule
executed as separate album-pictures (pi. 34^). His work appears inlacquer as
well as miniature painting.53 He had an eminent predecessor in the field in the
person of Muhammad HadI (pi. 35 #), whom Claudius Rich met as a very oldman
at Shiraz in 1821, calling him "the Iranian Van Huysum". "I found him an
extremely polite, intelligent, gentlemanlike old man",proceeds Rich; "He is full
of the spirit ofhis art, and ispassionately fond offlowers."54 Flower-painters
were, indeed, numerous in the Zand and Qajar periods, and their designs were
among the most popular onenamels and lacquer. But their best work is in
miniature-painting, sometimes applied to the decoration of manuscripts, where
it attains anunrivalled delicacy and beauty.
One other considerable class of separate miniature paintings calls for atten
tion. This consists mostly of single figures illustrating Persian types, costumes,
manners, and so on, painted on a plain background (pis. 35/?, 36^).The parallels
provided by "Company Painting" inIndia and the "Rice-paper paintings" of
Canton have already been mentioned. In all these groups genuine native styles of
painting are simplified and modified in order to make them acceptable to
European purchasers, thereby constituting a sort ofsuperior "tourist art". In
Persia they were evidently aprofitable line; as Sir William Ouseley wrote, "Of
pictures very neatly executed inwater-colours, on leaves of paper either sepa
rate, or collected into books, many hundreds were brought for inspection to our
tents, and offered daily for sale inthe shops ofIsfahan. Among these I found

were unfortunately of such a description as precludes any further notice."55
Actually, the erotic or pornographic element in Persian art, compared with that
of, say, India or Japan, is very small indeed.56
The remainder ofthe period, subsequent to the death of Sanic al-Mulk in
1866, does not call for extended treatment. One of the distinctions conferred by
Nasir al-DIn Shah onthat pre-eminent artist had been the supervision of the
painting department of the recently founded Dar al-Funun, or Polytechnic,
intended by the King - himself no mean artist (pi. 36/?)- for the instruction of
Persian painters in the European style. The most successful among its early
alumni was Ismacil Jala°ir, a great favourite of the Shah and apainter in oils of
talent and originality. His style was meticulous, thoroughly Europeanized on
the surface, but fundamentally Persian, and tinged with a sort of gentle melan
choly. Only three of his pictures, so far as is known, have been seen in Europe:a
group of ladies round a samovar, in the Victoria andAlbert Museum;57
Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac (Ismacil) averted, formerly in the Schulz collec
tion;58 and a wholly delighful oil-painting, entirely in monochrome, of the
handsome young dervish Nur CA1I Shah in aluxuriant landscape surrounded by
animals and birds (private collection) (pi. 3 7). But a number of others can be seen
in Persian collections, especially the Gulistan Palace andthe Museum of
Decorative Arts, including a portrait of Nasir al-DIn Shah dated 1279/1863.
Jacfar was a very competent portraitist ofthe same period, and has left two
good portraits of the King, theone full-face, seated in hisrobes (Gulistan
Palace), and the other inmonochrome, also full-face, but on horseback, dated
1291/1874 (Museum of Decorative Arts, Tehran). But the most notable figure in
Persian painting of the later 19th century was Muhammad GhafHri, nephew of
Sanic al-Mulk, who is usually known by his title of Kamal al-Mulk ("Perfection
of the Kingdom") which he received in 1892. He was born atKashan in 1848,
and studied at the Dar al-Funun. At the end of the century he spent five yearsin
Europe, and opened an art-school of his own in 1911, after his return. He lived to
the great age of 92, and rests inamagnificent tomb adjoining those of Farld al
Din cAttar and cUmar Khayyam on the outskirts of Nishapur. His mature style is
dignified and impressive, but completely Europeanized, and many examples of

both portraits and landscapes can be seen invarious Persian public collections;a
fine large portrait ofNasir al-DIn Shah inthe Firuz collection isnoteworthy (pi.
38/?). Mirza Mahmud Khan (1813-93) was Malik al-Shu'ara, or Poet Laureate,
towards the end of Nasir al-Din's long reign, but he was also askilled painter ina
photographic style closely imitating European methods ofrendering light and
shade. A striking painting of his, dated 1308/1890, oftwo men seated by candle
light, was exhibited at Burlington House in 1931 (pi.39).59 Hehas also left a
number of extremely realistic views of the royal palaces andgardens.
In the art of painted lacquer the Imami family of Isfahan rose to great
prominence in the second half of the 19th century. Riza al-Imaml executed the
finest piece oflacquer in the Victoria and Albert Museum collection, a mirror
case with richly massed flowers and gold scroll-work made specially for the Paris
Exhibition of 1867 (No. 922—1869) (pi. 68). Muhammad al-Husaini al-Imaml
was an excellent lacquer artist in traditional style during the 1870s, but had
painted a portrait ofNasir al-DIn asearly as 1845, when the latter was still heir
apparent; heattained the rank ofnaqqash-bashi. Another Imami who reached
the same distinction was Nasr-Allah, who was very fond ofintroducing hazel
nuts into his lacquer designs. Fath-Allah ofShiraz isyet another lacquer painter
of great distinction during the later 19th century, working in a Europeanized
style reminiscent sometimes of English mid-Victorian painted papier-mache,
with its black background and delicate gold scroll-work (pi. 40). Two more
artists in lacquer whose work extends into the present century, and who both
enjoyed the title of Sanic Humayun ("The Royal Painter"), were Abd al-Latif
and Abd al-Husain; the work of both isofvery high quality, but of markedly
European character.
After the death of Muhammad Kazim, the eldest son of Najaf, about 1885, the
art of enamel painting declined, andthesame is true of lithographed book
illustrations. Persian book-illustrators were unable toadapt the technique tothe
more strongly Europeanized style then in vogue. Meanwhile miniature-paint
ing dwindled into a sterile imitation ofSafavid prototypes, chiefly ofthe school
of Riza Abbasi. These imitations were at first farfrom convincing, but as time
went on thev achieved amore authentic look, and the line between conscientious
pastiche anddeliberate forgery is often a difficult oneto draw. The Imam!
family, in particular, seems to have specialized in covering the blank pages of
15th- and 16th-century manuscripts with miniatures inwhat they imagined was

the style of the time, the designs being not infrequently copied from reproduc
tions of Persian miniatures in European publications.60 However some remark
ably fine and often original work has been, and perhaps is still being, produced
by modern Persian miniaturists, amongst whom Rustam Shlrazi and a latter-day
Bihzad are perhaps the most noteworthy.61
It will therefore be permissible to close here this brief survey of painting and
the associated arts under the Zands and Qajars. Though admittedly much
inferior work has survived to give the period a bad name till quite recently, it is
not by that that the art should be judged. We do not assess English painting on
the works of the pavement-artists of Hyde Park Corner or Trafalgar Square. A
balanced consideration of the best painting of the 18th and 19th centuries will
surely result in the firm establishement of Mirza Baba, Mihr CA1I, Sanic al-Mulk,
and others who have earned an honourable mention in the foregoing account, in
the very respectable position they deserve in the history of Persian painting.
They were true to their art, they were representative of their period, and they
were a credit to their country.

CHAPTER 24
THE ARTS OF THE EIGHTEENTH TO
TWENTIETH CENTURIES
ARCHITECTURE
Introduction
"At adistance, Tehran, built ingreat part ofthe mud onwhich itstands, isonly
distinguished from the surrounding plain by the green trees of its many gardens;
but asthe traveller gets nearer hewill see the outline ofthe castellated city wall
and the tiled domes and minarets of mosques. He will enter the town by a
grandiose gateway adorned with glazed bricks inpatterns, the prevailing tones
being blue and yellow relieved with black and white, the whole giving atouch of
splendour to its squalid surroundings. These gateways aretwelve in number;
some are adorned with the exploits ofRustum, the Hercules and knight-errant
of Persia, and others depict the Persian soldier of today".1 This picture of
Tehran, asdrawn byElla Sykes in 1894, isanappropriately evocative introduc
tion tothe architecture ofthe period since itisthe buildings which give the city
its unfamiliar exotic appearance. Her account isone ofthe more sympatheticof
the many written intones ranging from wonder, disparagement and sarcasm to
sober assessment bytheEuropeans who visited Tehran since it became Iran's
capital in 1786. Most 19th-century Persian cities ofany size presented a similar
architectural pattern. City sites tended to have along history of occupation.A
harsh terrain and climate severely limited areas ofsettlement; communication
difficulties ina large country made it essential that a city was sited ina good
strategic position, preferably onatrade route; proximity to awater supply was
vital near foothills whose water-tables would feed qanats.Such factors generated
an intensity ofurbanization which is reflected inarchitecture, for it is in the
towns that the major experiments and developments in both religious and
secular buildings arefound. Outside a city's limits architecture tended to be
isolated and sparse. Outside Tehran were found the summer residences of the
Qajars though by modern standards the distances involved were small and most

of these buildings today fall within the boundaries ofthe modern city. Other
noteworthy buildings outside a city were service units toaid communication:
caravansarais and bridges constructed at intervals along standard routes. The
evidence ofthe many substantial buildings which have survived, especiallyof
the Qajar period, would indicate that Persia enjoyed a reasonable urban life.
Apart from the capital, cities such as Tabriz, Mashhad, Isfahan, Shiraz and
Kirman prospered through their positions as trading centres and places of
pilgrimage. This is attested by the numbers of surviving buildings. To acertain
extent the plans of these towns conformed to the scheme considered traditional
to the Islamic city. They were divided into distinct quarters confined within a
retaining fortified wall pierced bygates (pi. 41a). The royal quarter with its
palace and/or citadel was also the nucleus of administration (see p. 545,fig.1),
while the bazaar area and the residential districts were composed ofa maze of
winding streets and alleys. Each quarter would be served by its own religious
buildings - mosques, madrasas; religious minorities would be segregated as the
clearly defined Armenian and Jewish quarters respectively at Isfahan and Shiraz
indicate. It would be incorrect, however, toassume that these cities lacked any
elements of spacious town planning or that the Zands and Qajars did not
develop them. Safavid Isfahan, usually quoted as thesupreme example of
Persian town planning, was not an isolated case. Tabriz in the late 17th century
had an impressive maidan larger than that of Isfahan.2 Shah cAbbas I had built a
long avenue running northwest and southeast of Imam Riza's shrine at
Mashhad. Imam Qull Khan, governor ofShiraz, had built an avenue along the
Isfahan road and a palace in themaidan, and Ganj CA1I Khan, governor of
Kirman, had built an imposing complex of madrasa, bath and bazaar set rounda
maidan.
The Zands andQajars followed this well-established tradition of town
planning with their own programmes sponsored either by the ruler himself or
members of his extensive family who held important state positions orprovin
cial governorships. Inthe 18th century the most prominent example isthatof
Muhammad Karlm Khan Zand (1750-79), who inaugurated an ambitious
architectural programme inShiraz, consisting of a maidan with accompanying
buildings of a walled arg,palace, and acomplex of mosque, bazaar and hammam.
The Qajars continued, beginning with Fath cAli Shah (1797—1834), who ex
tended the Gulistan Palace at Tehran, rebuilt the city's walls, undertook
extensive constructions to Imam Riza's shrine at Mashhad, and sponsored a

programme of building at Kashan, Simnan, Qazvin and Zanjan. His son
Muhammad cAli Mirza, governor of Kirmanshah, is credited with having spent
large sums to rebuild and beautify the town. Nasir al-DIn Shah (1848—96),
however, sponsored the most extensive building programme of the Qajars when
he initiated the reconstruction of Tehran in 1867. Although he greatly extended
the city he in some ways maintained tradition. The fortified mud brick walls
which had graced Fath All Shah's Tehran were pulled down and the city's
boundaries extended. The wralls were replaced at agreater distance by another
series of brick bastions forming an octagonal enclosure eleven miles in circum
ference, surrounded by a moat and pierced by twelve tiled gates. While his
concept was not original the way in which itwas carried out was. The bastions,
begun by General Buhler in 1867 a n d completed in 1871—2, were modelled on
Vauban's system for the fortification of Paris. The main quarters of Nasir al-Din
Shah's new Tehran presented imposing vistas of maidans, entered by impressive
tiled gates, on towhich the porticos ofreligious buildings and large houses
opened. The area of the Gulistan Palace was greatly extended and rebuilt.3 Nasir
al-DIn Shah's architectural ambitions were not only confined to Tehran. Both
Qazvin and Simnan have impressive tiled gateways remaining from a system
which clearly imitated the battlements of the capital. Like his grandfather Fath
All Shah, he also contributed to established religious shrines; he completed a
new court at Imam Riza's shrine at Mashhad and the greater part of the shrine of
Shah Abd al-cAzIm at Rayy dates from his reign.
Sufficient buildings survive from the building programme of the two major
Qajar rulers to enable abalanced assessment of their architectural achievement
to be formed. If they are studied objectively without any prejudiced assumption
that the 19th century was decadent, both in form and technique, much thatis
attractively planned and well-constructed will be found. The major obstacle at
present to acomprehensive evaluation of both Zand and Qajar architectureis
that, through the neglect which they have suffered, available scattered material
has tobe collected so that they may be analyzed and compared. Four major
groups ofsource material have tobe used.
1. European literarysources. Persia was visited since medieval times by Euro
pean visitors of various professions and interests —diplomats, merchants,
technical experts. Their numbers, increased inthe 17th century through the
encouragement ofShah A.bbas I, receded during the turbulent events of the

18th century, and expanded again after the establishment ofcontact betweenthe
Persian court and P^ngland and France at the beginning of the 19th century.
Many of them published accounts of their experiences in Persia which yield
much fascinating andvaried information. These accounts range from personal
memoirs to detailed scholarly works and official papers such asconsular reports
and gazetteers. Concerning architecture many ofthese accounts at least mention
buildings andtheir locations; andare thus valuable records where thebuildings
no longer exist. The best accounts identify patrons and attempt to date and
describe buildings and relate them to their environment. Here they are especially
useful for complex buildings with a continuous history of additions and
alterations, such as the Gulistan Palace: the dates at which a visitor mentions
certain structures enable a chronological sequence at least to be outlined. The
accounts are less valuable for analysis of the elements of a building and the
details of decoration and often function can be misinterpreted. This is not
surprising when it is recalled that foreigners were discouraged from entering
religious buildings and relatively few had any opportunity of visiting private
houses.
2. European illustrative sources. These may be divided into two groups: (a)
Drawings, lithographs, sketches etc. These illustrated travel accounts in vary
ing degrees of skill and accuracy. Interpretations of buildings range from
romantic impressions ofcrumbling ruins against impressive mountain or desert
backgrounds to meticulously drawn views, plans and elevations, (b) Photo
graphs. From themid 19th century onwards a new technique was added to the
repertoire of illustrative methods - that of photography, which opened up
possibilities of more objective recording. Evidence hasemerged to show that
photography was used to record aspects ofIran since the 1860s. Here the earliest
yet known photographs are those contained in the album of the Italian diplo
matic mission of 1862.4 They include views of buildings, some of which arestill
standing while others have long since disappeared. The photograph really came
into its own in the late 19thcentury when it wasused to illustrate the travel
accounts written during that period. They naturally vary in quality but at best
can usefully bechecked against asurviving building. One ofthe most interesting
of the 19th-century photographers was Ernst Hoeltzer whowasemployed by
the Persian Telegraph Department from 1863 until hisretirement in 1 890. Apart
from some periods of leave in his native Germany he spent his life in Isfahan

where hedied in 1911.From about 18 74 onwards hephotographed Isfahan from
all angles of its life andenvironment.5 Hisphotographs of architecture are
carefully observed studies composed to reveal the structure andfeatures of
buildings.
3. Persian literarysources. A great quantity ofliterary material survives from
the 19thcentury which needs tobeassessed. The most promising sources here
are works of history, geography, biography, autobiography andtravel, pub
lished in lithographed editions. Asyetfewof these texts have been critically
edited andindexed so that they have tobe patiently searched for references. The
histories are classifiable as general and local, of which the latter may often
contain references tobuildings within the region under discussion. Inthis type
of literature thedistinction between history andgeography becomes less clear as
many of the works include much local gazetteer information. One of the best
examples of this type of work is theFars-nama-ji Nasirl of Hasan-i Fasa°I,an
historical treatise of Fars province which also includes much geographical
description, progressing from the beginning ofthe Islamic era to 1882.Topo
graphical dictionaries may also provide information. From the many which
exist, five major works of Ttimad al-Saltana may bequoted asexamples, sincehis
prolific output crossed the boundaries ofall categories. Hisfour volumes of the
Mfrat al-Buldan^ published between 1876 and 1880,contain themixture of a
geographical dictionary of Persian towns and a chronicle in calendar form of
Nasir al-DIn Shah's reign. A similar calendar of events is included in his
Munta%am-i Nasirl written between 1881 and1883. Both works are useful for
references to building dates included in the calendar sections. His third major
work theMatlaQal-Shams,published in three volumes 1884—6, is basically an
account ofNasir al-DIn Shah's pilgrimage toMashhad. It is in fact much more
since it includes full descriptions of the towns of Khurasan visited on both
outward and return journeys, and a most detailed account of Mashhad and its
monuments. Its importance as an architectural source isself-evident. His fourth
work Kitab a!-Ma°asirva°I-Asar, published in 1888, is an invaluable reference
work on theevents ofNasir al-DIn Shah's reign down tothedate ofpublication
and includes notes ofbuilding programmes. Hislast work tobe mentioned here
strikes a more personal note as it is his diary,6 a voluminous compilation
recording tersely the events ofeach day and the places that he visited. From an
5 Ernst Hoeltzer (1835-1911) worked in Isfahan as Assistant Superintendant in charge of the Persian Telegraph Department branch office there from 1871to 1890; during his career and after retirement he photographed many aspects of Isfahan's life and environment including theta play. Selections of his photographs have been published in Scarce, "Isfahan in camera". 6 Maraghi, Ru^nama-yi Khatirat-i Ttimad al-saltana.

architectural point ofview it is useful in showing the frequency and seasonal
nature of the building in use at the time.
4. Persian archival sources. Another type of Persian documentary source which
is beginning to be made more accessible are the vaqf-namas — foundation charters
of religious buildings.7 Among the endowments and conditions listed in such
documents the circumstances and date of building can be found. The buildings
themselves, however, are ultimately the main sources. Ideally each one should
be exhaustively described, catalogued and planned and its inscriptions tran
scribed and translated as afoundation for any assessment of its importance and
place in the development of Persian architecture. This approach, while essential,
does have its drawbacks because the building can only be recorded in its present
condition after possibly a long history of alteration and rebuilding. Direct
observation of the building must therefore be supported by a study of the
literary and illustrative sources.
Techniques and materials of building and decoration
For the construction and planning of their buildings the Zands and Qajars had
Persia's centuries-old tradition upon which to draw and in general they choseto
develop itrather than introduce drastic innovations. Since rather more informa
tion is available for this period concerning thematerials and techniques of
architecture and labour organization it may be summarized here before discus
sion of the buildings themselves. The process of building required the skills of
various specialist craftsmen who hadlearnt them as apprentices andwere
organized into guilds — asnaf. Although knowledge concerning Persian guildsis
incomplete, they were apparently urban organizations ofgroups of craftsmen
engaged inthe same trade orcraft, who elected their own chief and paid guild
taxes. Guilds were vital units of Persian economic life and membership was
obligatory for any aspiring craftsman ortrader. Progress within a guild began
with the padau - achild recruit employed on simple craft techniques and torun
errands etc. He progressed to the shagird(apprentice) stage when hespent a
variable period of time learning the craft before being eligible, after gaining the
head ofhis guild's permission and onpayment to him ofa sum ofmoney, to
become anustad — master — with his own shop. Although theoretically guild
membership was open to all, in practice it tended to become hereditary since
sons followed in their fathers' trade or craft rather than face the expense of
' For example the vaqf documents ofIsfahan published in Sipanta, Tarlkhcha-yi auqaf-iIsfahan.

branching out into new enterprises. From the somewhat scattered and uneven
evidence available it isclear that the building crafts were organized into guilds.
Here one of the most valuable sources is the Jughrafiya-yi Isfahan of Mirza
Husain, begun in 1877 and finished in 1891. Mirza Husain was anemployeeof
the Isfahan Telegraph Office. His knowledge of Isfahan wasthorough and
among the numerous guilds which he lists, he includes the following connected
with architecture and its decoration: mfmar - architects; banncii — masons,
divided in turn into bricklayers and the more highly specialized plasterers who
made elaborate decorations ofcarved and moulded stucco; najjar- carpenters;
hajjar- stonecutters\fakhkhar- potters, who included kashlsa^- tilemakers; and
finally unskilled labourers and construction wTorkers andothers - camala va
banncfi vaghairahu* This range of craftsmen would seem to be typical of any
Persian city where building operations flourished. Mirza Husain does imply,
however, that the building industry had declined in Isfahan when he emphasizes
the small number ofcraftsmen compared with former times. The most probable
reason for this decline was the attraction of workmen to Tehran, which since
1867 had provided many more new construction projects. Even here, however,
the number engaged in architecture was comparatively small; outof an esti
mated total of 29,000 working inhabitants only some 2,500 were masons and
labourers.
The process of construction began with thearchitect's design. Irritatingly
little information has survived about the training and practice ofthe architect's
profession inQajar Persia, but it appears that he experienced no broad theoreti
cal andpractical training including subjects such as history of architecture.
Generally his skills and outlook were based onpractical knowledge gained by
following the examples ofthe master craftsmen to whom hehad been appren
ticed. This did not mean that his buildings were necessarily faulty — many Qajar
buildings arewell-planned andconstructed — butthat he was conservatively
traditional and absorbed new influences slowly.9 Evidence shows that hehad a
portfolio of designs and plans; a collection of architectural drawings, designs
and sketches exists which belonged toMirza Akbar, court architect. These were
acquired after his death from two ustads(master masons) to the Persian court,
Khudadad and Akbar, presumably members of Mirza Akbar's staff, byC.
Purdom Clarke, Superintendant ofHer Britannic Majesty's Works inPersia,in
8 Mirza Husain Khan, Persian text, pp. m -12, 121. 9 This situation was notunique to Persia. In Britain, for example, architecture only separated from the building trade as adistinct profession with the foundation ofthe Royal Institute of British Architects in 1830.

be incorporated or how many storeys and levels were required. Obviously they
must be regarded as working drawings of specific architectural units which
could be fully interpreted by a craftsman whohad a long practical experience of
what was structurally possible. Using this repertoire of architectural units,
which were interchangeable in both religious and secular buildings, the architect
could combine them in a final plan of his choice. Traditionally the plan would
have been drawn up in situ by marking out the walls with powdered lime
following the master chart. It should be stressed, however, that such plans
would only have been prepared for large-scale religious, royal and public
buildings. In the case of more modest domestic architecture a local builder
would begin by marking out the site according to schemes which he had
committed to memory.
After the plan had been decided the first step in any construction was the

digging of foundation trenches along the lines of the walls. The trenches were
then filled with large stones bonded by amud and lime plaster, the task of the
guild of unskilled labourers. Once this had settled and hardened building proper
could begin. Although there was, and is, much more regional variation in
Persian architecture than has been credited, the principal building material was
brick. Persia has plentiful supplies ofstone, but difficulties ofquarrying and
transportation restricted its use inarchitecture todecorative material mainly
used for elaborately carved dadoes running round the lower walls of a courtyard
or room. Brick occurred inmany forms ranging from simple rammed earth
lumps, mainly used for the retaining walls of gardens and orchards, through the
sun-dried mud and straw bricks of village houses to the more technically
sophisticated and durable kiln-fired bricks of large-scale religious and civic
buildings, made up of a sand and clay mixture shaped into squares and baked in
kilns situated on the outskirts of a town. At this stage the masons took over and
built up walls in neat courses of brick bonded with a lime and sand mortar. Brick
courses were left unadorned, worked into patterned bonds, orcovered with
surface decoration of polychrome tile, stone dado, carved stucco and painted
fresco - all the work of specialist craftsmen. The roofing of a building presented
few problems and varied according toregion. Inthe Caspian region withits
heavy rainfall, roofs ofoverlapping shingles were constructed. Elsewhere a
combination of wooden beams overlaid with straw matting and boards covered
with layers of mud, plaster and lime mixture, or brick domes and vaults were
used, depending on the type of building and area to be covered. As with walls,
ceilings and domes could be decorated with tiles, stucco and painted fresco.
Both religious and secular architecture owed much of its impact to decora
tion. Here one ofthe most frequently employed techniques was polychrome
ceramic tilework, mainly produced in Qajar times in Tehran, Shiraz and Isfahan.
Three basic techniques were used:
1. Mosaic in which geometrical designs were worked in square or rectangular
pieces ofturquoise, white, yellow and black tile.
2. Overglaze painted "cuerda seca". Here increasingly elaborate patterns were
painted in a vivid palette of pink, purple, yellow, shades of blue, green, and
orange ina meticulous enamelled style.
3. Underglaze painting in which a more subtle arrangement of colours,
modified by the use of black for shading and outlining, was only used from
about 1880 onwards.
Tilework was used toemphasize structure. This is particularly noticeable in
religious architecture where bands and panels of tilework were used to decorate

the entrances and aivam of mosques and madrasas. InFath CA1TShah's buildings
both mosaic and cuerda seca techniques are blended in a harmonious manner;
mosaic panels infine geometric patterns were used for verticals (pi. 43/?) and to
outline and adorn thefacets of muqarnas (stalactites), and to surface domes.
Cuerda seca tiles in graceful compositions, including rose and iris motifs (pi.
41/;) and arabesque foliage, were used to cover arch spandrels and surfaces where
bands and panels of clear pattern would be seen to best effect. The religious
buildings of Nasir al-Din Shah's reign continued in this tradition but employed a
much more extensive range ofdesigns. Mosaic tiling continued in geometrical
patterns but cuerda seca was enlivened by the use of such motifs as bouquets and
vases of abundant roses and groups of fruit - grapes, melon, pomegranates - all
framed in garlands and drapery swags. The whole style has adecidedly Victorian
flavour, which is heightened by the intrusion of such motifs as scenes of
European landscapes obviously copied from imported contemporary postcards
and magazine illustrations.12 Probably the most extraordinary use of tilework in
a religious building is seen in thetakya of Mucavin al-Mulk at Kirmanshah
decorated with large panels of cuerda seca tiles, which depict a sequence of
events from the ta\ija drama and Sufi themes; in the composition and useof
colour they are treated as paintings. Also included are portrait tiles of local, civil
and religious dignitaries worked in ahatched and stippled technique in black on
white, obviously influenced bylithographs and photographs (pi. 42).13
The tilework of secular buildings was used to panel facades, as in the Gulistan
Palace,14 to line courtyards and form decorative interior friezes, as in some of the
late Qajar houses of Shiraz, and to adorn city gates. This tilework sharedthe
floral landscape designs of religious buildings, but more opportunity was
offered for narrative scenes worked in cuerda seca technique on alarge scale and
resulting in poster-like images using colours applied either in clear washes orin
varying depths ofintensity. Themes included subjects from popular literature
such as Rustam combatting the White Div boldly splashed across the central
pediment ofSimnan's city gate, and contemporary subjects ranging from a full
scale portrait of Nasir al-Din Shah onhorseback decorating the facade of the
Bagh-i Iram to the realistically depicted soldiers in combat in World War I which
feature on Tehran's Darvaza-yi Bagh-i Mill! (pi. 430). Underglaze painted tiles
are best seen inthe friezes within the main vestibules of the Gulistan palace and
lining the walls of the reception salon atSaltanatabad (pi. 43^). Here treated in a
hatched and shaded naturalistic style, they depict such events asNasir al-Din

Shah listening to a piano recital (pi. 44a) or reviewing his troops, groups of
European women in fashionable dress, and a later series of Parthian and
Sasanian kings inspired by coins and lithograph illustrations.15
Stone was used comparatively sparingly as architectural decoration inthe
form ofslabs ofcream coloured limestone or greenish marble, either supplied in
Shiraz from thenearby mountains or brought in from Azarbaljan or Yazd.The
slabs were generally made upinto dadoes running along the facades ofcourts of
both religious and secular buildings, ornamented with designs carved in fine
shallow relief or openwork. In the Masjid-i Sipahsalar at Tehran these dadoes
were carved with highly wrought floral designs (pi. 44b). At Shiraz a more
delicate patten using iris and rose motifs was favoured. An interesting local
development confined to Shiraz was the copying of figure scenes from the
Achaemenid reliefs ofPersepolis, notably the processions ofservants seen in the
palaces of Darius and Xerxes.
Glass wasused in three principal ways. First, stained glass wasmade up of
insets of red, blue, emerald, andyellow setwithin openwork wood panels used
for fanlights and sliding sash windows (pi.45*2). Here the Husainiya Aminl of
Qazvln is notable because a stained glass rose window is also painted with the
twelve zodiac symbols. Secondly, mirrorwork mosaic, a technique used in late
Safavid times to sheath a surface, was fully developed inthe Qajar period. It was
used tocover the inner surface ofan aivan ortalaras, forexample, inthe shrineof
Shah Abd al- Azim at Rayy, and thereception area ofthe Nirangistan at Shiraz,
while the inner chamber of Shah Chiragh at Shiraz is completely lined with it.
Thirdly, in domestic architecture friezes of repeating floral and scroll patterns
were inlaid in pieces of colourless, red,green and blue glass against a smooth
white stucco ground. Stucco in its own right as a form of architectural
decoration has a long history in Persia. In Qajar times, especially during the
reign ofNasir al-DIn Shah, it became a highly elaborate means ofdecoratingthe
ceilings (pi. 45^), walls and fireplaces of domestic architecture and was moulded
in prominent relief in a repertoire of designs closely resembling those of
contemporary tilework; thus ornate bouquets and bowls or roses and medal
lions containing fruit and bird motifs are found contained within foliage.
The last important means of architectural decoration is painting, whichwas
used mainly in domestic interiors. On ceilings a mosaic ofinterlocking wooden
shapes, painted with still-life compositions, landscapes, groups of Victorian
women, andtraditional motifs such as a lion andsnake in combat all framed in

rose foliage and ribbon strapwork, was constructed. Alternatively a ceiling of
horizontal wooden beams would be painted with such designs.16 The parallels
with motifs used in tilework andstucco areobvious. When used as wall
decoration, painting was employed in panels based on flower and bird composi
tions, and also in large figure scenes, which may be regarded as paintings in their
own right rather than asarchitectural accessories (pis. 16, 17, 19).
The Zand Period i/jo—94
At present disappointingly little of 18th-century Persian architecture has been
identified. This situation is understandable, however, when it is remembered
that for most of the century after the fall of the Safavids in 1722, Persia was ina
state of political chaos and civil war and only partly stabilized in the Zand
interregnum (1750—94): patrons who would have sponsored large-scale con
struction programmes were preoccupied. It is not until the reign ofthe first
Zand ruler, Muhammad Karim Khan (1750—79), that some patterns of 18th
century architecture can beseen. Both the length and relative stability of his
reign encouraged the construction ofsignificant buildings, but only in places
where he held sway. Karim Khan began hisbuilding in Tehran, which he
occupied in 1759—60. He had the walls ofthe town and ofthe citadel or Arg
rebuilt by a celebrated architect, Ustad Ghulam Riza Tabrizl. Within the Arg he
constructed an audience chamber, administrative and private quarters. He did
not further these schemes because, after defeating the Qajars, he made Shiraz his
capital. Hisbuildings in Tehran having been absorbed by reconstruction
programmes of the 19th and 20th centuries, the architecture of his reign must be
sought in Shiraz. Surviving buildings must however be treated with reserve;
they have been much altered and repaired, and also damaged by earthquakes.
Yet sufficient remains toshow that Karim Khan planned his buildings as units
within an all-embracing city plan. Shiraz was traditionally famous for its open
appearance and gardens. Karim Khan's plan catered for this harmony ofspace
(see p. 101,fig.1).
Twenty-seven constructions in Shiraz, ofwhich sixteen remain today, are
attributed toKarim Khan Zand, both complete buildings and buildings which
he extended and restored.17 The range isan impressive witness tohis energy
mosques, administrative and secular buildings, palaces, baths, commercial
buildings such as bazaars, civil engineering projects such as drainage channels,

THE ARTS OF THE I8TH-2OTH CENTURIES
moats, bridges, fortifications, water reservoirs and gardens. The buildings to be
discussed here are those concentrated in the centre of Karlm Khan's plan. He
built an imposing square or maidan with his citadel or Arg and palace, mosque
and bazaar grouped around it. Today the maidan no longer exists and its former
site istraversed by the large Karlm Khan Zand boulevard, which runs on a
northwest-southeast axis bisecting his bazaar. The maidan was still in existence
in 1802 as Waring comments on it,18 and also in 1889, when Curzon visited
Shiraz. Curzon remarks "one face ofthe palace fronts the principal Meidan
which isa desolate expanse containing a number of guns"19 and "From the
Meidan access isgained to the Bazaar-i-vekil or Regent's bazaar, an enduring
monument of the public spirited rule of Kerim Khan."20 A combination of his
evidence with the positions of surviving buildings in the centre of Shiraz makes
it clear that they were mainly situated on the northeast and south sides of the
maidan.
The maidan wasdominated by the Argwhich stands today much altered.21 Its
exact date of construction is uncertain but it is surely oneof the earliest buildings
begun and completed, and one of the best preserved examples of urban
fortifications in Persia.22 The basic plan is simple. It consists of a large enclosure
80 yards square with a circular tower at each corner rising to twice the height of
the retaining wall. On afoundation of stones the walls and towers are built of
close-packed courses ofseveral thicknesses ofnarrow fired bricks ofa high
standard of workmanship. The walls and towers are pierced at their upper level
with small arched apertures. The practical and functional quality of the exterior
is enlivened by the use of brick ornament (pi. 46a). Karlm Khan's builders were
following a tradition established in Persian architecture since Saljuq times when
variations indirection and depth ofrelief ofcourses were used toavoid the
monotony of a plain brick surface. Here the decorative effect isachieved by
using a fairly limited technique; allthe brick courses are strictly kept to a
horizontal alignment and the pattern created by variation in level of relief.
Geometrical motifs therefore predominate. The long walls are ornamented at
intervals with diamond shapes whose points each terminate in asmall lozenge.
The relief is one brick deep and the units are filled in with rows of steps outlined
in chequered panels. The decoration of the four towers is less restrained
although disciplined into horizontal bands. Here the outermost layer of brick

has been used to form designs either in sunk or raised relief. Four main areas of
motifs can be divided into two groups working from top to bottom: (a) deep
bands of interlocking zigzags picked out in sunk relief; (b) aherringbone band
on a bolder scale with interspaces neatly balanced with chequered diamond
motifs; (c) abroadly composed band of linked faceted cartouches and lozenges
alternating; (d) a broad band ofreciprocal trefoils in sunk and raised relief.
Bands (a) and (b) clearly have the type of motifs which can be built up in stepped
oblique lines, but those of (c) and (d) are more closely related to designs in other
media; the cartouche is used as a border in 17th-century carpets and the
reciprocal lozenge is based on the more flowing lines of a reciprocal trefoil found
as a narrow guide-line also on carpets.
Access to the citadel was gained byanentrance onthe south-east side.
Evidence that this entrance can be attributed to Karim Khan is shown by two
European accounts, that of Francklin23 who published an account in 1788 only
nine years after Karim Khan's death, and that of Gore Ouseley24 who entered the
palace in 1811through this gate. They both remark on the large tilework picture
of Rustam fighting the White DIv which adorns the entrance. A similar tile panel
is still visible. Once inside the Arg the internal structure issimple. All apart
ments were built into the retaining walls leaving an open central court. These
apartments consist oftwo storeys ofinterconnected rooms each with a large
window facing the court. A crenellated effect is achieved by flat semi-engaged
brick columns between each vertical pair of windows. Certain adaptations were
made tothe court inQajar times. For example the tilework was restored by
Prince cAbd al-Hasan Mirza Farma.25 Curzon is awitness of this alteration. He
records that "its interior is occupied by the courtyards and pavilion ofthe
governor's residence which struck me as in no sense remarkable".26 He also saw
remains ofKarim Khan's structures which no longer stand today: whenhe
visited the Governor Mu tamad al-Daula, he passed "through two large garden
courts one of which contained a marble dado of warriors in relief and painted,a
relic ofthe palace ofKerim Khan".27
In addition to his citadel itseems clear that Karim Khan used external palace
buildings. Persian concepts of domestic architecture, both of palaces on a grand
scale and homes on amore moderate plan, are traditionally less compact than
western ones. Relationships between buildings and the outside environment
were stressed; therefore a palace could consist of a series of individual structures
set within a walled enclosure. Karim Khan's buildings are no exception. In

THE ARTS OF THE l 8 T H - 2 O T H CENTURIES
addition to his citadel he built several palace structures which remain today, but
in adrastically curtailed form. Thus on the north side of the maidan and east of
the citadel stood alarge building, the divankhana or audience chamber. Little of
this has survived because it was ransacked byAgha Muhammad Qajar for
building materials28 and also adapted for use as the office of the Indo-European
and Persian Telegraph Departments in the second half of the 19th century.A
misleadingly isolated impression is also given because the remains are concealed
behind the Post Office and separated from the citadel area bythe modern
Khiyaban-i Shapur. Originally the divankhana would have been reached by
passing east from the citadel through an arched gateway which opened onto a
garden.29 At present little remains apart from the ornamental pool and the much
altered reception talar, still faced with its original marble frieze depicting scenes
from romantic poems such as Nizami's "Laila and Majnun".
The citadel and the divankhana may be considered as the official, public areas
of the palace complex. Karim Khan, again following Persian tradition, kept
public and private life strictly separate. He built another palace annexe, the
Kulah-i Farangi, onthe south side ofthe maidan. This is a small building
enclosed within agarden which as late as 1850 also contained other buildings;
Binning talks about an "Imareti Khorshid" and an "Imareti Kah", a tower-like
structure.30 If Binning's description is accurate it is evident that the turret
structure has an 18th-century predecent as it is mainly found in the late 19th
century buildings ofNasir al-DIn Shah and also is seen inthe battlemented
enclosure of Fath cAli Shah's summer residence at Qasr-i Qajar. Only the Kulah-i
Farangi stands today, a small building clearly intended for occasional use asa
place inwhich torelax and receive guests informally (pi. 47b). Externally it
seems deceptively simple with an octagonal ground plan. It isbuilt of finely
bonded bricks on astone foundation which also serves as aplatform to which
access is gained by a flight of three stone steps set against each of the four oblique
sides of the octagon. At the rim of the octagon are deeply projecting wooden
eaves with radial supports on the underside. The four straight sides are pierced
by four arched openings; the windows here can be opened to give access to the
garden and thus create an intimate relationship between the inside and outside
world. Within, the plan is a saltire and on several levels focused around a central
octagonal pool. The tall window-entrances on the straight side lead into a lofty
hall which contrasts with the arms of the saltire which are filled with small rooms
on two storeys. These rooms are, however, connected with the central hall by

ARCHITECTURE
arches on the lower level and open interior windows on the upper level. This
division of space and mingling of levels within one building is a distinctive
feature ofPersian closed chamber architecture; it has precedents inthe domed
chambers of mosques from Saljuq times onwards and in secular buildings such
as the Safavid Hasht Bihisht kiosk at Isfahan, which is itself built on an octagonal
plan. Karim Khan's kiosk, however, is ona more intimate and modest scale.
Both interior and exterior surfaces of the structure are enlivened by decoration
in four media, (a) Stone: the limestone foundations are carved on one level of
shallow relief with broad flat cartouches and cypress trees from whose bases
duck heads whimsically spring; (b) asin Karim Khan's citadel, brick is used
decoratively by picking out geometric patterns on one level ofrelief. Thus the
spandrels above the arches of the window entrance are filled with repeating
diamond lattice patterns. The terrace which projects above the wooden eavesis
ornamented with acontinuous band of reciprocal trefoils in sunken raised relief
as on the turrets of Karim Khan's citadel; (c) the use of painted tile work is here
introduced; panels, spandrels andcontinuous friezes skilfully pinpoint the
structural features and provide surface variation; (d) within the kiosk surfaces
are painted. Much of this was restored in 1937 and 1938, but a few sections
remain to show that a fresco technique was used of painting in fresh bright
mineral pigment on a plaster foundation. The designs of birds among gay
flowering trees are paralleled in other contemporary media — such as lacquer
painting and tilework.
Apart from these secular buildings Karim Khan was also responsible for the
planning and construction of a fine mosque, the Masjid-i Vakil, built on the
south side of the maidan slightly south-east of theKulah-i Farangl. It is
significant not only as a major religious building of the Zands but also as the only
important building ofits kind tobe constructed inlate 18th-century Persia.A
definitive assessment of this building remains difficult because on examination
and by comparison with other dated architecture itis clear that several building
or at least decorative stages are involved. The mosque has also seen restoration.
A tentative history only of the building stages may be suggested. The mosque
was begun late in Karim Khan's reign: Hasan-i Fasa°I mentions that itwas built
in 1180/1766.31 Itwas still in areasonable condition nearly 40 years later. Scott
Waring records in 1802 that "the outside of the principal mosque is very
handsome andlike thegenerality of eastern buildings is ornamented with
painted tiles and Arabic inscriptions." Curzon, however, visiting Shlraz in 1889,

records "the only fabrics . . . inanything approaching repair are those erected by
Kerim Khan the most beautiful ofwhich isthe Musjid-i-Vekil near the Meidan,
left unfinished bythe Regent at his death and never yet completed".32 He does
not quote a source forthis information so it isnot clear whether he is recording
written record or hearsay, but his comments cannot be discounted and the
question must be left open. Karim Khan's presence is disappointingly absent
from theinscriptions of the mosque, but, since themosque's decorationwas
restored during the 19th century, Curzon might have deduced that this restora
tion was the completion of Karim Khan's unfinished work. Epigraphicand
stylistic evidence indicates that the mosque was restored during the 19th
century, following damage inthe earthquake ofJune 1824. Later restorations to
the tilework adorning the entrance and interiors ofthe north and south aivans
were carried out during 1243/1827 and 1244/1828 by Fath All Shah's son
Husain CAU Mirza, then governor of Fars. Dated inscriptions left of the entrance
alcove, on twopanels west andeast of the north aivan, running around the
interior of the south aivan and bordering the aivan record this. Within the south
aivan a tilework inscription on the mihrab also records, without a date, that
Husain All Mirza restored the mosque after anearthquake.33 Inscriptions give
evidence ofyet another period ofrestoration following the earthquake of 5May
185 3.34 A frieze running along theupper border of the east side of the porch
contains the date 1237/18 5 6, in the reign of Nasir al-DIn Shah. This evidence of a
later restoration \z supported stylistically by the tilework surrounding the
mihrab which is in thehigh "Victorian" style developed under Nasir al-DIn
Shah. What then is left of Karim Khan? Is there in fact a Zand foundation
underlying the exuberant Qajar superstructure? Possibly the basic plan and main
structural features areZand since several sources attested thesolidity of Zand
building; the buildings themselves survived the earthquake which wreaked
havoc in 19th century Shiraz and seemingly only the adornment needed repair.
So it may be assumed that the plan and inspiration are Zand: there are certainly
enough features to distinguish it from preceding andfollowing architectural
styles.
The plan is remarkable foritsgenerous spatial area and the modest propor
tions of the architectural units; for example it is not dominated by massive
plshtaqs ortowering aivans todwarf the arcades. Access is gained to the mosques
on the north through a recessed entrance (pi. 46/?) the upper vault of which is
adorned with muqarnas —a traditional and versatile decoration in which a

ARCHITECTURE
honeycomb or stalactite effect is built up by using small squinches set at various
angles. A covered vestibule behind the entrance leads by two passages into the
open court of the mosque.
The open court with four aivans is the classic yet variable plan of the Persian
mosque. Here however the plan is different. The court is rectangular, 130 x80
metres, with two aivans only facing each other and centred on the north and
south sides; the east and west sides are lined with a single storey ofcovered
arches. The aivans themselves are simple rectangular shallow structures witha
rectangular central recess which is drawn into a pointed arch by faceted vaulting
(pi. 47a). The north aivan is surmounted bya pair of guldasta (minarets or
turrets), which were probably added later. The south aivan's apparent simplicity
is deceptive as itserves as an entrance to alarge covered prayer hall, a shabistan,
which extends the width of the building and is five vaulted bays deep. In contrast
to the rest ofthe mosque structure, which isof baked brick, the shabistan is
supported on forty-eight fluted marble columns which terminate inacanthus
leaf capitals. The marble for these columns was brought from Yazd and
Azarbaijan.35 The mihrab is a recessed tiled niche centred in the back wall of the
shabistan and has a marble minbar to its left. The row of five vaults leadingin
from the south aivan to the mihrab are tiled but otherwise the area is not
emphasized.
This treatment of the qibla area of the Masjid-i Vakil is of great interest, in that
it has broken away from the tradition associated with the open court mosque
plan. Here the qibla area is given much more prominence asthe mihrab is
positioned in the back wall of a lofty square chamber surmounted by a dome.
Within such a chamber considerable dramatic effect was achieved by the
juxtaposition of squinches and vaults. A comparison with the Zand treatment
must be sought in an earlier type of mosque plan, the so-called ''Arab mosque
plan". Here the open court is surrounded by arcades, which are deepest on the
qibla side. The logical development ofthis was a deep columned vestibule,
which is indeed the basis of the Masjid-i Vakil's shabistan. The originality is in
the combination ofboth columned prayer hall and aivan structures. This is
neatly done, by having balancing aivans on the north and south sides, and by
fitting inthe shabistan behind the south aivan. An interesting feature ofthe
structure isthe use ofstone for columns. Until this period, possibly because
there was little need for it, stone was used sparingly in Persian Islamic architec
ture and mainly decorative, as friezes lining the lower interior walls of a

building, less frequently ascolumn bases. The plan ofthe Masjid-i Vakil is
completed by ashabistan-i ^amistanl, winter prayer hall, also a stone-columned
structure, but enclosed on all sides. In addition to its use as aunit of construc
tion, marble continued its traditional decorative function. The lower parts of the
aivans and arcade walls are faced with slabs of marble finely carved in relief with
floral motifs. The major feature of decoration is, however, the tilework, which
combines bands ofinscriptions and lavish floral motifs.
Karim Khan followed the Islamic tradition of mingling religious and secular
buildings within one complex. Behind the Masjid-i Vakil he built the Hammam-i
Vakil (Vakil's Baths) and reached on the east by ashort covered way from the
mosque's entrance is the Bazar-i Vakil. The bazaar survives today as a thriving
commercial centre though in a much changed condition due to later alterations
in town planning. Several of the European travel accounts give apicture of its
original state. Scott Waring in 1802 says "The Vakeel's Bazaar is amost noble
work; it is built ofbrick, arched and covered in like Exeter Change . . . It
probably extends half a mile and is, I should suppose, fifty feet wide . . . Ithas a
grand appearance atnight, when it islit up; and as every trade has a separate
quarter, you know where to resort to for what you may require . . .Many of the
other markets are very handsome, but none so magnificent as the Vakeel's."36
Binning in 185037 describes the bazaar as consisting of two vaulted arcades each
half a mile long with adome at each intersection. His account is confirmed and
more valuable details added by Edward Stack who visited Shiraz in 1882. He
describes acruciform plan with the following measurements — length of main
branch 500 yards, cross-branch 120 yards, vaulted roof twenty-two feet high,
road twelve feet broad, and adds approvingly "and the shops which open back
from the masonry platforms on either side are neat and well-stocked".38 From
these accounts it is clear that the Bazar-i Vakil was a well-proportioned and
symmetrically planned structure with vaulted streets. Today only one ofthe
arcades survives. The other and the dome at the intersection have been replaced
by the Karim Khan Zand boulevard, which bisects the remaining section of the
bazaar.

which had been contained rather than eliminated during his reign, resurfaced
and his successors were in conflict with the Qajar Agha Muhammad, who finally
defeated and killed Lutf CA1I Khan Zand in Kirman in 1792. Agha Muhammad
Qajar had already consolidated his position in northern Iran. He had entered
Tehran in triumph in 1786 and was formally crowned in 1796.39 Not until the
reign of his nephewT, Fath CA1I Shah (1797—1834), however, did the establish
ment of permanent peace permit the initiation of notable architectural projects.
Fath CA1I Shah's reign witnessed the construction of an impressive and farflung
series of both religious and secular buildings across Iran. These were distinctive
for elegance and generous proportions and continued the classical tradition of
Persian architecture. As they were not concentrated ina limited area it is
preferable to group them by type rather than by location. They will be discussed
as religious and secular buildings.
More of the former survive so itis logical to begin with them. A series of
royal mosques was constructed between 1806 and 1840 inTehran, Qazvin,
Zanjan, Simnan, Kashan, Burujird and Sanandaj — places widely separated and
strategically situated. Tehran as the capital was an obvious choice. Qazvin and
Zanjan are on the main road from Tabriz. Simnan is situated on the way to the
northeast and the important trade and pilgrimage centre of Mashhad. This chain
of royal foundations may be regarded as propaganda for the dynasty, demon
strating that Persia was firmly and peaceably under control. As several of these
mosques are dated they provide unequivocal sources for the progress of
architecture and its decoration during Fath All Shah's reign. Four mosques
furnish good examples:
(1) Masjid-i Shah, Qazvin. This is the earliest recorded example of Fath CA1I
Shah's religious foundations. It was constructed on foundations begun, accord
ing to Eastwick, who saw it in 1860, by Agha Muhammad Qajar. An inscription
in the entrance gives Fath All Shah's name and the date 1806.
(2) Masjid-i Shah, Zanjan. According to the traveller George Keppel, the
building of this mosque was under way in 1827. He noted in his diary that,
"Adjoining the bazaar, and fronting the palace, a supurb mosque is erecting; the
front is covered with enamelled bricks in the form of mosaic. It is complete to the
front story; and the principal arch, which is formed of hewn stone, has asolid
and handsome appearance."40 Two sets of dates in the south aivan, the earlier
1827 and the later 1829, in a calligraphy border, corroborate Keppel and indicate
that at least two more years' work had been required.

is dated 1828. Inscriptions additionally give the name ofcraftsmen involved

(4) Masjid-i Shah, Tehran. Naturally Fath cAli Shah constructed a large
mosque in his capital. He sited it at the heart of the city, immediately southeast of
the Gulistan Palace, and adjacent to thebazaar. Again on theevidence of
inscriptions several years' work was required. Two dates in the south aivan,
1808 and 1813, are recorded. This mosque, however, was later embellished by
Nasir al-DIn Shah, whose name is included in aninscription over the north
entrance dated 1890, and who also added minarets.
These four mosques all share a common plan, that of the classic Persian open
square or rectangular court pierced with an aivan on each side. The very
simplicity of this plan gives the clue to its long survival and tenacity inPersian
architecture. Far from being alimiting factor itpermits great flexibility. Exten
sions could be built beyond the confines of the court while its component units
could vary in complexity and proportion. A comparison of the four royal
mosques demonstrates these points and the variations ininterpretation. Com
mon to all mosques built on the open-court plan is the skill with which they are
integrated into their environment. They do notas in western architecture
present three-dimensional external vistas but are intimately linked tothe sur
rounding buildings andstreets by shared communal walls andconnecting
passages. All four are linked tothe bazaar quarters, a traditional and practical
combination of spiritual and material needs. At Qazvin the mosque's entrance is
reached by along walk extending back from the main street, while the mosque
itself is intimately related to the caravanserais and tlmchas ofQazvin's bazaar
complex. In Tehran the Masjid-i Shah's entrance forms one side ofa maidan
below street level, containing ironmongery shops, while further links with the
bazaar are provided by anetwork of exits on the south-east side of the mosque's
court. The mosques at Zanjan and Simnan continue this feature.
As the mosque was so integrated with surrounding buildings, itwas essential
that certain features were emphasized for purposes of easy identification. One of
the most obvious choices for this was the entrance aligned along the north side.
The entrance of the two mosques of Qazvin (pi.48^) andTehran, both
constructed within two years of each other, show how this was achieved. Each
entrance was constructed as an arched portal which, although on less monumen
tal lines than, for example, the entrance of the Safavid Masjid-i Shah of Isfahan,
was still ofdominating proportions. Both these entrances show that byearly
Qajar times width was an important element, resulting in a more "stocky"
construction. Each entrance is focused on acentrally positioned deep arch, the
912

ARCHITECTURE
upper vault rilled with clusters ofstalactites worked instucco atQazvin and
covered by polychrome tile at Tehran, and so arranged that the eye is led up to
the apex. Ineach mosque the arch isextended into a massive rectangle by a
carefully organized combination of triangular spandrels, and aseries of ascend
ing panels; all these units are set within aframework of vertical and horizontal
bands. Tilework decoration serves further to advertize the mosque's presence
and underline the units of construction. Another notable feature is the absence
of minarets flanking the entrance — they are not acharacteristic of early Qajar
buildings; those at Tehran are Nasir al-Din Shah's addition.
In all cases the entrances link up with the north aivan of the mosque's open
court. This was achieved in Qazvin, Tehran and Simnan by constructing a
vaulted octagonal vestibule behind the entrance, from which two passages
opened out to left and right into the court to flank the vaulted arch of the north
aivan. Additionally in the later mosque at Simnan the back of the aivan is linked
to the vestibule by a tall archway. Structurally and proportionally the form of the
aivans progresses chronologically; the north aivans of the two earliest mosques
are massive and broad with a wide but comparatively low vaulted niche, within a
frame of a series of three ascending panels. Over 20 years later atSimnan the
aivan proportions were altered to produce a taller, more elegant structure,in
which verticals are emphasized and another panel is added to the series flanking
the vaulted arch.
In all four mosques the north aivan gives access to an open court of extensive
area, where four sides are lined with continuous arcades of arches. Here again
variations in construction and proportion are discernable. The three mosques of
Tehran, Qazvin and Zanjan, all have a single storey of arcades, formed of broad
shallow arches. A more interesting treatment is seen at Simnan where the arches
are taller and more slender, to harmonize with the proportions of the aivans, and
are organized into a two-storeyed arcade, the upper set well back from the lower
to form an open terraced walk. Within an open-court plan certain variations
were permissible inthe number of aivans centred on each side. The Masjid-i
Vakil at Shiraz had two, and this scheme is repeated in some later 19th-century
mosques. The four mosques under discussion here, however, all conformed to
the plan involving four aivans, one centred on each side. All are constructed on
the same basic principle of a deep vaulted recess with astalactite muqarnas set
within a rectangular frame of varying proportions, but are treated as pairs of
west and east aivans and north and south aivans (pi. 48/?, c). The west—east pair
are lower than the north—south pair and more stolid in construction. This
feature is constant in all four mosques.

THE ARTS OF THE I8TH-2OTH CENTURIES
In contrast the aivans on the north-south axis are taller and more imposing
and at Qazvin and Simnan further stressed by being flanked with a double storey
of the courtyard arches. Although structurally and decoratively comparable, the
south aivan is the most significant and consequently the most lavishly orna
mented, to serve as amonumental entrance to the maqsura, the domed sanctuary
which houses the mosque's principal mihrab in its southern wall. The construc
tion and plan of the maqsura is seen most clearly at Qazvin and Simnan (pi. 490),
where there islittle difference apart from subtleties of proportion. Ineach case
the maqsura is a square chamber set with a squinch at each corner surmounted by
a zone of triangular pendentives — a well-established tradition effecting the
transition to adome. At Qazvin the squinches are simple arches set at an angle,
whereas at Simnan they are elaborated by the inclusion ofa double secondary
arch. In all themosques, thedome rises as a prominent turquoise glazed
hemisphere, but at Simnan itis fashioned out of plain brick with adeep external
octagonal drum, and a tall narrow tiled "kiosk" at the apex.
The four mosques discussed represent the basic features of large-scale
religious buildings of the early Qajar period. Itwould be mistaken, however,to
assume that they provided an immutable pattern for all such architecture. Less
regular treatment isfound inmosques built by private patrons, as for example
the Masjid-i Sardar built at Qazvin in 1815-16 by two brothers, Muhammad
Hasan Khan Sardar and Husain Khan Sardar, who both served as generals in
Fath All Shah's army. The mosque is built on the open plan with a court of more
modest proportions and lined with continuous arches. There are no aivans and
the sanctuary is simply indicated by abroader arch centered on the south facade
(pi. 49/?) and opening into a sanctuary surmounted by a small kiosk.41 Amore
ingenious, and graceful plan is seen in the Masjid-i Agha Buzurg, built in 183 2 at
Kashan. There asecondary court, constructed around a sunken garden (pi. 5 oa),
enables the functions of mosque and madrasa to be combined, while the maqsura
is constructed asa chamber open onallsides.
A greater number of secular buildings exist forthe Qajar period than for
earlier centuries, to make a more balanced assessment of its architectural
achievement possible. Although for Fath AllShah's reign many of these
buildings, especially in Tehran, have been destroyed or drastically altered
during recent modernization schemes, itis possible by combining information
gleaned from structures which have survived wholly or in part, and from
contemporary sources to establish a sequence and scheme of constructions. Such

ARCHITECTURE
buildings were all royal foundations, the town and country palaces of the Qajar
court. The idea ofmigration was deep-rooted in Persian tradition, and, as
practised by the Qajar rulers and their retinue, involved moving out of Tehran
for the hot summer months to cooler retreats. Bymodern standardsthe
distances were small. Most of these summer quarters were located inthe
Shamiranat villages near Tehran which arenowits northern suburbs. The focus
of Fath All Shah's system of palaces was the Gulistan Palace or Arg - which
served both as the ruler's town residence and as the centre of government. It is
situated in south Tehran, close tothe Masjid-i Shah and the bazaar, then the
heart of the city. Itwas planned in aseemingly rambling and confused manner
much remarked on by European travellers who were used toa much more
formal style of official building. Itconsisted essentially of a series of pavilions
and porches, set wTithin an enclosed garden, containing trees, flower beds, and
ornamental pools. Theessential point is the close relationship between building
and garden, especially noticeable in the use of open porches and kiosks. This
relationship is seen in the palaces of Isfahan, and Karim Khan Zand's quarters at
Shiraz. Although the Gulistan Palace was the nucleus of Fath All Shah's
residential buildings, comparatively little remains of his work, as itwas altered
by Nasir al-DIn Shah.42 According to tradition, not Fath All Shah but Karim
began the Gulistan Palace. Karim Khan initially intended to make Tehran his
capital andin 175 9—60hadthewalls of the town andArgrebuilt with administra
tive buildings, audience chamber, and private quarters inside the Arg. When
Karim Khan Zand returned to Shiraz, heleft the Gulistan buildings to be
embellished and extended bythe Qajars. Fath All Shah's major building
operations were apparently completed by 1806. Amedee de Jaubert, Napoleon's
envoy, describes a glittering reception held there at which he beheldthe
resplendent king seated in hisglittering Divankhana,43 a monumental porch, the
main structure of his reign surviving today. The clearest general picture of his
work, however, issupplied by Pascal Coste and Eugene Flandin, two French
architects who accompanied an official mission in 1839—41.44 They relate that
the palace was situated inthe then north-west oftown and surrounded bya
turretted wall of baked brick and a ditch. This citadel appearance has long since
disappeared. The palace gardens and buildings were reached throughthe
principal gate on thewest, the Dar-i Sacadat (Gate of Happiness), a two-storeyed
structure with its own talar and flanking side chambers, which inturn was
pierced by a gate with a drawbridge. Within the enclosure the following

buildings were listed, which reflect the dual functions ofadministrative centre
and royal residence: Divankhana, reception talar; Sunduqkhana,treasury; cImarat-i
Khurshld, the pavilion where Fath CA1I Shah received foreign ambassadors;the
private apartments, Khwabgah-iShah, king's sleeping quarters and andarun,
separated by gardens; andfinally, theguardrooms andarsenal.
Unfortunately Coste and Flandin gave noplan forthis complex. Hence it is
impossible to reconstruct exact spatial relationships, butfrom their surviving
drawings theDivankhana45 and itscourt appear bounded bya wall; it would
seem that originally the palace wasmuch more divided into separate units
screened by trees than itisin its present state. Of Fath All Shah's buildings only
the Divankhana survives and that, as far as its decoration is concerned, in an
altered form. Flandin drew the Divankhana asanimposing broad talar flanked
by a pair of wings of mezzanine-floored rooms opening both onto the garden
and into the talar. The talar, an architectural unit of great antiquity, isbasicallya
deep porch — consisting ofa square orrectangular room open on the fourth side
and supported bycolumns; it is a versatile unit — capable of being used with
splendid proportions as inpalaces, ormore modestly inprivate houses, where it
can be sealed off against the outside world by sliding sash windows. In the
Gulistan Palace it isofdeep proportions and open tothe garden. It is supported
on two twisted marble columns with muqarnas capitals reputedly cannabalized
from Karim Khan Zand's comparable Divankhana at Shiraz (pi. 50/?). Within,
the structure is simple, consisting of two storeys of rooms running round the
talar and interrupted byan aivan niche at thecentre back. Allthefacades are
richly decorated with mirrorwork mosaic framing oil paintings of Fath cAli
Shah. The wings flanking the talar are each oftwo storeys linked by connecting
stairs on each side of the central rooms. Upper and lower landings have
connecting doors tothe talar while the main rooms are divided from each other
by wooden lattice sliding windows extending from ceiling to floor. The
ingenuity with which different floor levels were manipulated and interlinked in
a harmonious manner isone of the most significant features of Persian domestic
architecture worthily continued bythe Qajars. The Dlvankhana's dominating
proportions are stressed bythe lower level ofthe single storey ofarches which
appear running along each side andangled to form the retaining walls ofa
courtyard. Although this elegant structure survives it was altered byNasiral
Din Shah. Hefilledinthe facades ofthe talar wings with polychrome tilework,
creating a much heavier effect, and demolished the single-storey arcades,

replacing them on the northeast side by atwo-storeyed building and opening the
east side out into a more spacious open court area. The two ornamental pools
directly infront ofthe talar - one an ogee-shaped quatrefoil the other long and
rectangular - have been preserved.
Fath cAli Shah's summer residences46 fall into aclear pattern, those compara
tively near the city of Tehran, which were constructed as fully developed
permanent habitations, and those situated atvarying distances from the capital,
which could either be modest small-scale buildings, dominated by their gardens,
pirated Safavid buildings, or even temporary encampments. Most of them have
been much altered orcompletely demolished. Ofthose within the city's envi
rons, the Nigaristan was one of the most favoured by Fath cAli Shah. During his
reign itwas about amile north of Tehran, which indicates how compact the city
then was. Although today its one remaining structure, with its vaulted ceiling
carved with white stucco on a blue background, serves as a museum and is
surrounded by office buildings, enough accounts ofthe 19th-century travellers
have survived togive a general picture ofits architecture and plan. It seems to
have been completed at the latest by 1812. Tancoigne,47 visiting Tehran in 1807,
describes it asa rectangular enclosure surrounded bywide brick walls, while
Price in his journal entry for 181148 refers to the pavilion decorated with
paintings ofthe foreign ambassadors received by Fath CA1I Shah, including Sir
John Malcolm and Sir Harford Jones (pis. 16, 17). Later visitors both substanti
ate and enlarge on this. All agree that the palace was planned as anumber of open
octagonal pavilions within an enclosure. Thus it was basically informal, giving
as much importance to the garden asto the buildings. George Keppel in his
account of182449 mentions three pavilions, of which one was decorated with an
elaborate series of murals of Fath CA1I Shah receiving ambassadors. Johnson, in
his earlier account of 1817, is more specific about the paintings, giving exact
positions for them in themain audience pavilion and placing theenvoys to
whom Price referred in a side room. He also adds, "These paintings are allof
very recent date and certainly do the artist great credit".50 Charles Stuart in 1835
provides more information, identifying the first pavilion as abath-house.51 Jane
Dieulafoy, however, as late as 1889, gives the most specific information as far as
function and form are concerned. She states that the main building, the audience
pavilion containing the narrative paintings, isinthe shape of a Greek cross, the
centre ofwhich isdomed while each ofthe four arms contains a vestibule and

two smaller rooms which could be used as sleeping quarters. Shesawthat the
andamn gardens were grouped around this main pavilion sealed offby walls and
containing a rectangular building — two-storeyed, facing on to a pool.52 It is
interesting that shewas able to notice so much, as even at thetime of KeppePs
visit in 1824 he found the subsidiary buildings dirty andneglected. Binning in
1850 remarked that: "The apartments are all dirty and dingy; thepresent Shah
rarely comes hither and the place is consequently neglected."53
Fath All Shah's most spectacular building efforts were reserved for another
summer palace, Qasr-i Qajar, situated approximately four miles northeast of
Tehran on the Shamlran road leading to Gulhak. After many years of decay, it
became a prison in the 1930s. Today no trace remains of it. Once again,
therefore, it is necessary to rely on theaccounts anddrawings of contemporary
travellers for a reconstruction.
It wascertainly built by 1807, as Tancoigne remembers it as a large brick
built complex consisting of a series of courts andterraces crowned byFath All
Shah's palace.54 The most coherent account, however, especially valuable
because of the drawing and plans which accompany it, is that of the two French
architects Coste andFlandin.55 Their description is brief, because all theneces
sary information canbe deduced from comprehensive plans anddrawings (fig.
5). These supply a ground plan, elevation, perspective view from the entrance,
and a detailed drawing of a kulah-i farangi — "foreigner's hat" — theterm for an
open octagonal pavilion under a shallow dome andwith overhanging eaves,as
in Karim Khan's example in Shiraz. Theentire complex was enclosed within a
brick wall with turrets ateach corner comparable tothe tradition ofKarim Khan
Zand's citadel though on a much larger scale.
Two outstanding features arenoticeable. First the scale of garden and open
space in relation to the buildings; theentire palace is prefaced by an enormous
rectangular garden, with anentrance gatehouse at thesouth end. This garden is
gradually terraced, leading up to a rectangular pool which heralds the entrance
to themain palace area. Apart from theentrance to theKulah-i Farangi centred
in the garden, there are no buildings. Considerable care has, however, been
exercised to divide up the garden area into an orderly pattern of tree plots by
intersecting paths and water channels. It thus incorporates all the features ofa
classic Persian garden — trees, water, andseclusion from theoutside world — the
small open-sided pavilion serving to indicate the intermingling of man-made
and natural environments.

The second most noticeable feature is that the plan basically consists ofa
series of elevated and terraced open rectangles, which give an interesting and
varied panorama, culminating in the citadel of multi-storeyed royal quarters.
The convention of concealing residential areas behind a vast garden was
strongly rooted in Persian secular architecture; it is seen earlier in the17th
century Chihil Sutun palace at Isfahan, andlater in theBagh-i Iram at Shlraz, c.
1875. At Qasr-i Qajar there is an interesting variant on theopen talar structure
already seen in theGulistan Palace. Units ofPersian architecture are versatile in
function and here the talar is elevated into a two-columned vestibule over an
imposing gatehouse; this in turn is made up of an aivan with muqarnas
decoration flanked bymulti-storeyed extensions much asin theGulistan Palace.
The gatehouse in its turn opens into a narrow court lined on both sides with
rooms - which again gives access to another series of landscaped terraces
framed within brick walls ofcontinuous blind niches. These serve as apreface to
the living quarters, constructed asasquare citadel-like enclosure with a facetted
turret ateach corner. The plan indicates that the citadel enclosed anopen garden,
with its sides lined with series of rooms which served as quarters for ministers,

officers, and courtiers. Itcan be assumed that Fath CA1I Shah's quarters were on
the south side and that his harem inhabited the two-storeyed kiosk wing above
the entrance. This is possible as stairs leading to thewomen's quarters are
indicated onthe plan here and this kiosk would have been the only area that
could have been kept segregated. Coste and Flandin did, however, visit Qasr-i
Qajar long after Fath CA1I Shah's death, when it was no longer inactive use, so
that the original functions of the various rooms might no longer have been clear.
In addition tothese palaces within the more immediate environs of Tehran,
Fath All Shah constructed summer residences further afield. Some of these were
for easy access along the main routes, such as the Sulaimaniya palace at Karaj and
that at Sultaniya, on the main Tehran-Tabriz road. Both have either been totally
destroyed or survive in a much reduced form, Sulaimaniya as a dilapidated
building in the grounds of the National School of Agriculture at Karaj. From its
appearance today and the evidence of19th-century accounts itwas clearly never
intended tobe agrandiose habitation on the scale of Qasr-i Qajar, but rather to
serve asa hunting lodge and fortemporary occupation. Accounts differ con
cerning the date of its foundation. According to Coste and Flandin itwasbuilt in
1805 for Fath All Shah's son Sulaiman Mlrza,56 while Eastwick states that it was
built in 1808.57 All the accounts, however, generally agree onthe layout and
construction. They describe a series ofcourts and separate buildings reserved
for different functions, of which the most striking seems to have been an
audience hall decorated wTith mural paintings of Fath CA1IShah and his sons.
More comparable in concept to Qasr-i Qajar was the now vanished palace built
at Sultaniya between 1806-9.58 Basically this was a mud and brick structure
mainly built ofmaterials cannibalized from the neighbouring Mongol monu
ments and consisting of four areas enclosed within walls and comprisingthe
women's quarters, a kulah-i farangl, private apartments, and audience hall,
constructed on amulti-levelled terrace and linked by formal gardens and courts.
The overall effect, however, seemed more awkward and less harmonious than
that of the elegant Qasr-i Qajar, probably because itwasessentially regarded as a
rather makeshift structure for temporary habitation only. Apart from initiating
new building projects Fath CA1I Shah economically refurbished Safavid resi
dences which conveniently served him as both provincial and summer palaces.
Two such examples may bebriefly mentioned: the Hasht Bihisht, a graceful
octagonal pavilion built by Shah Sulaiman in 1670at Isfahan, and the structures
and gardens of the Bagh-i Fin(fig. 6),built by Shah cAbbas I just outside

Buildings of Nasir al-Din Shah (1848—96)
While Fath All Shah's buildings may beregarded asa graceful combination of
classical forms with baroque decoration, those ofNasir al-DIn Shah's reign bear
reasonable comparison with theextravagant flowering of 19th-century Euro
pean architecture whose influences are indeed discernable, grafted onto Persian
tradition. Generally thescale andproportion of Nasir al-DTn Shah's buildings
are more grandiose which, when fused with exuberant and colourful decoration,
create an imposing impression. Nasir al-DIn Shah himself during his three visits
to Europe of 1873, 1878 and 1889 obviously took note ofthe palaces ofhis royal

hosts for future reference. Buildings of his reign have survived in greater
number and variation than from those of his predecessors. Additionally, while
naturally concentrated in Tehran, they are also well distributed throughout
Persia.
Characteristic features of later Qajar religious architecture may be illustrated
by taking two examples, the Masjid-i Sipahsalar built atTehran between 1880
and 1890 by Mirza Hasan Khan, Nasir al-DIn Shah's Minister ofWar, and the
Masjid-i Nasr al-Mulk built at Shiraz between 1876 and 1888 by Hasan cAlIKhan
Daryabegi Nasr al-Mulk, the son of CA1I Akbar Qavam al-Mulk.
The Masjid-i Siphahsalar is a most impressive structure, basically con
structed as a large-scale version ofthe classic plan ofan open court with four
aivans. The differences liein the proportions involved, the manipulation of
structures such asentrances and minarets, and the flamboyant detail which is
emphasized by the accompanying decoration in polychrome tile and carved
stone. The style of the entrance has significantly changed from those of Fath AIT
Shah's buildings which were still rooted in the Persian classical tradition (pi.
5la). The Masjid-i Sipahsalar entrance is no longer aligned on the north side so
that itsymmetrically confronts the maqsura at its inner opening. Instead itis on
the west, leading into the court through the west aivan but very much at an
angle. Unlike the entrances of Fath CA1IShah's mosques itdoes not present itself
as ahigh rectangular structure enshrining astalactite vaulted portal. Instead it is
set back from the main axis ofthe west side, has a comparatively shallow and
extended stalactite vault and is completely dwarfed by the two flanking minarets
which rise from elaborate bases, pass through ornately tiled columnsand
terminate in facetted kiosks. Internally the entrance leads into a domed vestibule
from which a complex arrangement of passages enwrap the western aivan before
opening on to the courtyard. This presents a more controlled appearance, a large
square area enclosed by two storeys of continuous arcades which each open into
a room behind, for the mosque also serves as a madrasa and rooms for the
students were needed. Each of the four aivans is classic in basic conception, with
its central vault flanked by a series of panels on each side. The south aivan (pi.
5ib) leading into the domed sanctuary presents the most elaborate appearance;
the aivan itself is exaggeratedly deep and high, framed in subsidiary chambers
before expanding into the main sanctuary, the dome of which rests on four
corner squinches. The facade ofthe aivan is adorned byfour minarets of the
same style and construction as those flanking the entrance; they are positioned at
intervals and arise from elaborate bases as semi-engaged columns before
projecting beyond the upper reaches of the court. This use of semi-engaged
922

ARCHITECTURE
columns has parallels incontemporary secular architecture, such as houses and
gates, and indicates how function became subordinate to decorative effect. The
spaciousness of the mosque's court ismirrored on its east side, through which
access is gained by adoor at the back of the eastern aivan and also by a corridor
running along the north side, to avast shabistan, acolumned winter prayer hall
which has been recently renovated with marble paving.
The Masjid-i Nasr al-Mulk in Shiraz59 illustrates both continuity with the
architectural forms ofthe Zand period and originality in the displacement of
units comparable with those ofthe Masjid-i Sipahsalar, although on a smaller
scale. Zand features survive inthe rectangular courtyard of good proportions,
the use of two aivans only on north and south, and the addition of an enclosed
shabistan on the west, supported on twelve fluted stone columns with acanthus
leaf capitals. A marked eccentricity occurs however in the positioning of the
entrance and the treatment of the two aivans. The entrance, as in Fath cAlI Shah's
mosques, has reverted to the north side opposite the qibla. Externally itpresents
a massive rectangular portal with ascending recessed panels framing a painted
stalactite-lined niche. Itis, however, asymmetrically situated to the extreme west
of the northern side nearer theshabistan than to themain court, which is
reached through adomed vestibule which turns at asharp eastern angle to open
into the northwest corner. Within the court the east and west sides present an
uninterrupted flow of a single storey of arches. The treatment of the north and
south sides is, however, unusual in that the most complex and elaborate
treatment is devoted to the north side. Here construction is focused on acentral
aivan flanked by two storeys of arched niches which reach the same height as the
apex of the aivan's arch. Within, the aivan extends back deeply, even beyond the
outer limit of the entrance and focuses on a mihrab-like niche; itis in turn flanked
by asubsidiary vestibule. The oblique outer west—east axis of the north side has
also enabled a series of additional rooms to be included beside the northern aivan
without interrupting the rectangular plan of the main court, agood example of
the flexibility of this type of plan. The south side incontrast ismodest (pi. 5 3),
consisting of a one-storeyed series of six continuous niches, three niches on each
side flanking acentral indented niche which contains the mihrab and provides
no access to a domed sanctuary.
The religious buildings of Nasir al-Din Shah's reign were not solely confined
to mosques and the structurally related madrasas. He was a conscientious patron
of the imam^adasor shrines. Persia is especially fertile ground for shrines. They

occur ingreat numbers and range from modest country structures tothe large
complexes of such cities as Mashhad andQum. Of early foundation they
generally present a concentrated medley of architectural styles which have
accrued through pious donations. The Qajars were no exception to this tradition
and their work may be seen in all of Persia's major shrines. Fath All Shah added
sumptuous courts and chambers tothe shrines ofImam Riza at Mashhad and
Fatima Macsuma at Qum, while Nasir al-DIn Shah embellished Shah (Abd al
Azim at Rayy and added courts tothe Nicmat-Allah Vail complex at Mahan.
Perhaps the most compact example of his work is seen in the shrine of Shahzada
Husain atQazvin. Shahzada Husain was the son of the eighth Imam, Riza, and
died in the 9th century. His grave was embellished by aSafavid foundation built
in 1588, but sothoroughly did Nasir al-DIn Shah restore it that the resulting
structure gives the impression that the complex was founded during his reign.
Its architectural interest lies inits skilful use of space and in the employment of
units which have been observed in the mosques of his reign (pi. 52^). Tiled
inscriptions over the portal of the saint's tomb record Nasir al-DIn Shah's name
and the date 1889 at least indicates when work was nearing completion.
Surrounding the tomb is alarge open court of polygonal shape and lined witha
single storey ofuninterrupted arcades ofniches deep enough forpilgrims to
settle forthe day with their bedding and cooking utensils, forthe use of the
courtyard is practical and informal. Access to this court is gained through a
conspicuous entrance onthe north side. This takes the form of an extended
facade with a central broken-arch shaped pediment flanked by lower
semicircular shaped pediments. The significant features however are thesix
slender semi-engaged columns spaced evenly —three on each side of the
doorway — which contract toa small cylindrical kiosk-like terminal. These are
directly comparable with the proliferation of minarets seen inthe entrance and
south aivan facade ofthe Masjid-i Sipahsalar. The form ofan extended facade
with semi-engaged columns will yet again be found inthe construction ofcity
gates. Centred within thecourt is thesaint's tomb housed in an imposing
polygon covered with a dome andfaced with an extended facade, which
combines the pediments of the entrance gate and an engaged column at each end
with aninset rectangular columned aivan which in turn leads into the tomb
chamber, thus employing yet another traditional unit ofPersian architecture.
The secular buildings of Nasir al-DIn Shah's reign far outnumber those of his
predecessors both in quantity and in type, as they include not only palaces but a
reasonable number ofprivate homes and city gates. The major developments,
however, took place inTehran and its environs so it isappropriate toconcen

trate on them. Nasir al-DIn Shah continued to use the Gulistan Palace as his
winter residence and centre of government, but involved it so much in his
ambitious programme of renovating Tehran that his work dominates it. He
started altering the Gulistan Palace in 1867 and continued until 1892, often
revising his own constructions. His work may be grouped into three phases:
(a) 1867-73During these years he built the two-towered Shams al-Tmarat (Sun
building) on the east side which was completed in 1867, followed shortly
after by the andarun quarters behind the Takht-i Marmar (Marble Throne).
(b) 1873-82 Nasir al-DIn Shah pulled down all the buildings constructed by
Fath cAli Shah on the north side, replacing them with a continuous building
containing the main audience hall.
(c) 1882—92 The andarun was renovated in 1882 and the Kakh-i Abyaz (White
Palace, now the Ethnographical Museum) situated to the right within the
present entrance to the palace was built in 1891-92.
All these buildings were enclosed within a retaining wall and perhaps presented
a rather rambling unconnected array. Many illustrations have survived of the
various parts of Nasir al-DIn Shah's palace so that it is possible to reconstruct its
appearance, but perhaps the clearest picture is gained by examining the ground
plan drawn up by Dr Johannes Feuvrier, Nasir al-DIn Shah's physician from
1889 to 1892 (fig. 7).60 A comparison of this with the buildings standingat
present reveals that approximately only one quarter of the original structures
have survived: on the north the Takht-i Marmar and the audience hall; the
andarun was demolished in the early 1960s to make room for the buildings of the
Ministries of Finance and Justice. The east side has survived unaltered as both
the retaining wall and the Shams al-cImarat still stand. To the south only the
Tmarat-i Badgir stands, within the original tiled walls, while the subsidiary
buildings behind have been replaced by the Ministry of Information. The west
side of the Takht-i Marmar was formerly occupied by aseries of guardhouses
and stables which have now disappeared while the private street, Na°ib al
Saltana, formerly within the palace enclosure, is now the site of a public street,
Avenue Davar.
Although so much has been destroyed, enough remains to give a significant
assessment of the main features of grand scale civic architecture, and it is clear
that there are departures from the tradition followed by Fath CA1I Shah. First of
all the general impression is of greater spaciousness — all the buildings tend to be

ARCHITECTURE
grouped on the perimeter of garden areas rather than kept separate within a
series of courtyards. This iscertainly the impression which is strongest today
when visiting the palace - the emphasis laid on the garden made up of pools,
plots of grass neatly bordered by flowers and the cypress and plane trees which
are spread throughout.
On examination of the buildings, while some traditional features have been
retained, others have been abandoned for new fashions. The double-turreted
Shams al-Tmarat, the earliest of Nasir al-DIn Shah's buildings in the palace (pi.
5 ib), is reached by flights of steps and is multistoreyed, terminating in balconied
galleries at the summit. Construction on several storeys was not unknown to the
early Qajars or beyond the capabilities of their architects as the multistoreyed
central edifice of Fath CA1I Shah's summer palace at Qasr-i Qajar showed. Other
buildings, however, in particular the audience hall, indicate that such traditional
units as the open columned talar flanked by smaller interlinking chambers on
several levels, which gave such a visually interesting appearance to the facades of
early Qajar buildings, were nolonger in favour. Instead the audience hall
presents a continuous uniform two-storeyed facade (pi. 5 4*2),well proportioned,
in which tall windows and doors with semicircular pediments alternate with
projecting engaged columns, thus articulating the surface. The entrance is
massive in the form of a projecting columned portico. Seemingly the stimulus
for such a building style should be sought outside the main Persian tradition
since there are no indigenous parallels. The answer should surely be seen in the
context of Nasir al-DIn Shah's increasing experience of European architecture.
During the ten-year period when the audience hall was built, 1873—82, he made
two visits to Europe where he would have seen many royal buildings in the fluid
neo-classical style of the mid to late 19th century which he sought to emulate in
the Gulistan Palace. He was expressing in monumental form ataste for Euro
pean fashions and novelties which was to pervade all forms of Persian material
culture, ceramics, glass, motifs on tilework, and articles ofdress.
Nasir al-DIn Shah did not confine his building operations to the immediate
area of the capital. Like his ancestors, he followed the custom of migratingto
summer quarters built in the environs of Tehran. Itseemed the custom for each
Qajar ruler to establish his own summer residence; certainly the European
travellers who visited some of Fath CA1I Shah's residences long after his death
remarked on the decay and neglect they observed. There was obviously neither
the attempt nor the desire to continue using them, possibly because they were
regarded as impermanent structures not intended for any long occupation and
therefore less substantially built. Also changes of fashion in building and style of

living must be considered as much in Persia as in Western Europe, and it is
probable that Path All Shah's palaces would have seemed cramped and out-of
date to Nasir al-DIn Shah, especially after his foreign travels had broadened his
experience and taste. It is significant in this context that he found it necessary
drastically to renovate and extend the Gulistan Palace. It is only logical that he
should have felt the same about his summer residences. Like Fath CA1I Shah he
constructed several, although it is important to note that they were situated
within a closer radius of Tehran. No longer were hunting lodges constructed as
far away as Sultaniya, so that the tradition of a tribal leader migrating to far
flung summer pastures gradually evolved into more of a polite fiction, and the
court moved to less distant places built as permanent dwellings where life
continued on the same pattern as in the town, but in more comfortable climatic
conditions. Nasir al-DIn Shah's summer palaces, however, have received no
more fortunate treatment than those of Fath All Shah. Of the five principal
palaces in the Shamlranat - Sahib Qaranlya (Niavaran), Bagh-i Firdaus,
Shahristanak, Saltanatabad and Tshratabad — only Niavaran and Bagh-i Firdaus
present a relatively unaltered appearance; Niavaran was one of the residences of
the Pahlavl family and as such remained in continuous occupation, while the
Bagh-i Firdaus was repaired and used as an exhibition and concert centre.
Shahristanak has since vanished, while Ishratabad and Saltanatabad survived in
much diminished form and recently functioned as military complexes. As they
both seem to have been the ones most familiar to European visitors, to judge
from the number of accounts which have survived, and they represent such a
departure from the comparatively symmetrical terraces and pavilions of Fath
All Shah, it is worth attempting to reconstruct their appearance. Tshratabad is
now well within the city's boundaries and not far from the Gulistan Palace. It
was in existence by 1882. The French traveller Ernest Orsolle61 describes it in his
travels, and Curzon saw it in 188c).62 The account, however, which conveys most
succinctly and zestfully the bizarre character of this palace is that of the French
traveller, D'Allemagne:
La plus concise de ces menageries feminines, si j'ose m'exprimer ainsi, est celle d'Echretabad ou autour d'un grand lac, s'elevent une certaine quantite de petites maisons d'une metre cinquante environ les unes des autres: on dirait les cellules de quelque monastere ouvrant sur une cloitre. Dominant toutes ces menues batisses s'eleve une enorme tour a trois etages decorees de tuiles ceramiques multicolores; c'est le Khabgah ou palais du sommeil dans lequel le Shah repose lorsqu'il sejourne dans la contree et recoit la femme qu'il daigne elever un moment jusqu'a lui . . ,63

ARCHITECTURE
Clearly theoriginal feature here is thedispersal of the andarun block into
separate units, originally 12little chalets, each of one storey in height with
pointed roof and three windows at the gable end, surrounding the lake. In a
sense the whole palace isclearly apurely private retreat, an extensive andarun
with no segregation of the chalets from theKhwabgah - and no apparent
provision of any public or reception area. Today only six chalets remain mingled
with the buildings of a military barracks. The multistoreyed Khwabgah (pi. 54/)
stands in amuch dilapidated state. The ground storey presents a panelled facade
on allfour sides interrupted bycentred doors, while the two upper storeys
present blind niches alternating with more deeply setniches with balconies
which lead into rooms behind. Surmounting the third storey is what may best be
described as a continuous talar which takes the form of a roof with deeply
undercut eaves supported on columns at the outer limit. Here the Khwabgah
represents an amalgam of architectural elements. In the orderly arrangement of
its multistoreyed nature itis comparable to the tower of the Shams al-Tmarat of
the Gulistan Palace, erected almost 20 years earlier in 1867. The talar crowning
the structure, however, has earlier precedents, most notably inthe cAli Qapu
palace at Isfahan, where afrontally orientated talar is precariously balanced; but
by thelate 19th century theproportions have become rather more keenly
adjusted and the talar does not appear top-heavy. The main summer residence
was, however, situated at Saltanatabad. There more formal provision was made
for the varied public and private functions requisite ina royal residence. The
remaining buildings are situated deep within a munitions factory complex in the
north of Tehran. According to Orsolle, Saltanatabad was situated alittle above
Qasr-i Qajar.64 It was visited and described in varying degrees of detail by
several European travellers and residents, notably Orsolle in 1882, Curzon in
1889 and Dr Feuvrier, who says that itwas the principal summer residence. The
earliest description, that of Orsolle, lists all the buildings, indicating that the
palace was built by 1882.
In its basic plan Saltanatabad followed the early Qajar custom ofindividual
buildings grouped within a large park, although the plan and construction of
each building was different from those employed inearlier complexes suchas
Qasr-i Qajar; the little octagonal pavilion, the kulah-i farangl was, for example,
no longer infashion. According toOrsolle the buildings were arranged along
the axis of a large avenue which traversed the park enclosure (pi. 54^). He lists
four altogether, beginning with agatehouse at the entrance to the avenue. This

structure served as a reception area for ambassadors, court officials and others.
Beyond the gatehouse, which is not described in any detail, was a pavilion,
apparently ofa single storey surmounted by a columned loggia. The principal
palace building, entered by a marble staircase, was a more grandiose structure
with a central domed room decorated with stucco moulding and containing a
fountain, and encircled by two storeys of smaller rooms. Feuvrier's description
parallels this but adds that the palace had aclocktower on the right modelled on
the fire towers of Nimes. The remaining structure was the andarun, located by
Feuvrier at thebottom of the park to theleft of the main palace.65 This
apparently consisted of a multistoreyed khwabgah with atalar on the first floor
and andarun quarters onthe other side grouped around a court. The chalet
system of Tshratabad was notfollowed: thewomen were housed in more
compact quarters of the traditional type. Certain features of these accounts are
confusing, however. Itis not possible to pinpoint accurately the exact positions
of the various buildings both within the garden area and in relation to each
other; obviously theopportunities available for accurate observation were
limited, although itis surprising that Feuvrier, a member of Nasir al-DIn Shah's
court, did not attempt to plan the area as he did for the Gulistan Palace. Certain
other details are puzzling; the functions of three buildings are clear, gatehouse,
main palace andprivate quarters, butthepurpose of the second pavilion
mentioned byOrsolle is uncertain.
CERAMICS
The ceramics of the Qajar period have aroused little interest among scholars and
collectors, as much because of a lack of information asfrom the prejudiced
supposition that they arethelast sorry products of a declining craft.The
problems inherent in any impartial assessment of these late Persian ceramics are
many. The objects themselves were fragile and easily damaged. Hence the
amount that survives isunrepresentative. As this material has stimulated little
interest, a manageable corpus oftypes has never been compiled; the holdings
distributed through museums, for example, have never been adequately
catalogued ordescribed even inhandlists. Supplementary sources, such as the
European travel accounts and official reports, usually soinformative on the
material culture of Qajar Iran, are with few exceptions disappointingly brief or
even silent on the subject of ceramics, possibly because they were not considered

CERAMICS
worthy of comment. Certainly surviving examples of ceramics are less varied
and interesting than contemporary tilework. This would suggest that crafts
men's main efforts were channelled into the latter. A significant factor contribu
ting to lack of local incentive was the competition created by the increasing
volume of technically superior imports from Europe, which were much in
demand as both fashionable curiosities and items of practical use.
Before the 19th century Iran had witnessed a vigorous ceramic production.
Large quantities of wares ascribed to the 17th and early 18th centuries have
survived, made of a fine white composite paste, employing a time-honoured
formula of ground glass frit, quartz and clay, and glazed with a well-fitting
transparent alkaline glaze. Variations in decorative technique included painting
figurative and foliate designs, mainly influenced by those of Chinese Ming
porcelain in underglaze blue, combining underglaze blue with overglaze
polychrome enamels, employing softly coloured monochrome glazes over
moulded decoration, and more rarely painting rather sketchy floral motifs in
golden lustre over a colourless or deep blue glaze.
The wares produced in these techniques were certainly stylish and elegant
and well-suited to the colourful Safavid interiors which they furnished. Prob
lems, however, arise concerning their place of manufacture and details of the
mechanics of production. Several European visitors to 17th-century Isfahan
name places renowned for their ceramic manufacture, especially the jeweller
Jean Chardin,66 who gives the fullest list, naming Shiraz, Mashhad, Yazd,
Kirman and Zarand. Attempts, however, to identify surviving examples with
any of these centres can at best be described as tentative; no piece has yet come to
light with a named and dated inscription giving unambiguous evidence of
provenance. There are no large contemporary collections in Europe which can
be matched with an inventory for, apart from a brief period from 165 2 to 1682
when the records of the Dutch East India Company mention shipments of
Persian pottery from Batavia, there is no evidence of any great export trade and
the Safavid wares were for home consumption.67
From these Safavid wares the techniques of blue and white and polychrome
painting continued into the Qajar period when stable conditions were again
established at the end of the 18th century, and much later there is evidence of a
revival of lustre painting. While Safavid Iran, though not producing on the scale
of the Chinese factories which coped with both home and export markets, had
made enough ceramics for the local needs with a comparatively modest surplus

THE ARTS OF THE l 8 T H - 2 O T H CENTURIES
during the period of Dutch trade, the available evidence would seem to indicate
that demand and supply from the late 18th century onwards never reached even
this level. Certainly there was noattempt toproduce a surplus forthe export
market. In this context the comments of a committee appointed bythe East
India Company to report onPersian manufactures and trade in the 1780s are
revealing. While textile and metalworking crafts are listed as individual items,
ceramics are not even mentioned, which indicates that they were not considered
worthy of attention.68 In official reports this situation continues throughout the
19th century.
Evidence ofthe serious competition offered by imported wares may still be
seen in the large quantitities of assorted types of19th-century English ceramics
for sale in antique and bric-a-brac shops, and at amore sophisticated level in the
dinner services in the Gulistan Palace commissioned by Fath CA1IShah from the
factories of Crown Derby and Wedgewood and inscribed with his name and the
date 1234 (A.D. 1820). Itmay also be seen in the examples of Chinese famille-rose
export porcelains, ranging from a plate decorated with a border of flower-sprays
enclosing a Persian inscription dated 1201 (A.D. 1787)69 to a more flamboyant
group of bowls painted with designs of figures, birds and flowers framing a
central inscription: "By order of his Majesty, the most happy, the most excellent,
the highest, the most noble, the Sublime Sultan Mascud Mirza, amen to his
dominion, the Zill al-Sultan 1297 (1880)."70 This creation of export wares aimed
at the Persian market was lamented bythe French scientist Olmer writing in
1908:
Mais lebon marche des vases de Chine et d'Europe, qui inondent les bazars, lesa decourages de continuer leurs enterprises. Si Ton demande des bols, des tasses au bazar de Teheran, etqu'on exige de lafaience persane, on vous offre des objets ou est ecrit derriere Hadji AH Akbar Teheran en caracteres persans, mais ces vases sont fabriques en Angleterre.71
Official reports of the early 1900s note that Russia was also supplying much
pottery of a more humdrum nature and give reasons why it was easy to do so.
"The Russian manufacturer caters for a large population in Russia with require
ments similar to those of a large section of the Persian population and therefore
does not need to manufacture cotton prints, common glass ware, pottery, paper,
hardware and mercery, lamps, candlesticks and various articles of clothing
expressly to suit the Persian market."

CERAMICS
Other factors which may have affected home-produced ceramics were the
changing whims of Persian taste. Apart from the desire for foreign status
symbols, an abundance of other materials were available which could equally be
used for the type of object fashioned in ceramic; vessels for food and drink,
containers for jewellery and trinkets, qalyan pipe bases and ornamental vases
could equally be made in metal or glass. Indeed, the evidence of surviving
objects and representations in contemporary painting suggests that they were
preferred, at least among the classes of society which could afford them. At the
most affluent level, that of the Qajar court, enamelled and bejewelled gold was
worked into vessels for serving food and drink, while in Qajar oil-portraits the
languid sitters toy with imported glass goblets and decanters. Curzon, visiting
Tehran in 1889, testifies to a widespread taste for glass objects:
Another of the most widely-spread but unintelligible of modern Persian tastes is abundantly illustrated, and can be inexpensively gratified in the Teheran bazaars. This is the fondness, which seems to permeate all classes, from the Shah downwards, for lustres, candelabra, candle- and lamp-shades, and glass vases or ornaments of every conceivable description. I never entered a Persian prince's or nobleman's house without encountering a shop's window full of these articles, as a rule proudly stacked as though they were rare treasures, upon a table . . .72
All this evidence cumulatively leads to the conclusion that ceramics produced
in Qajar times were for the domestic market. Despite the comparative lack of
documentation in official sources, certain information about these ceramics was
recorded by three Europeans, who concentrated on the Persian craft and
industry traditions. They were a German physician, Jakob Polak, who lived in
Persia for several years during the 1850s, the Frenchman Comte Julien de
Rochechouart, who travelled in Persia in 1867, and L.J. Olmer, Professor of
Physics and Chemistry at the Imperial Polytechnic of Tehran during the late
19th and early 20th centuries. Their accounts are carefully observed and
mutually consistent, though Olmer's naturally has a more pronounced bias
towards the chemistry of glazes, so that between them they cover a sufficiently
broad timespan to enable a reasonable picture of the industry in the late Qajar
period to be formed. Valuable as their accounts are, however, they should be
treated with a certain critical reserve because they do not include the finer details
of shape and design which would enable them to be matched closely with
surviving wares.
The first important factor to emerge is that the Persian ceramic industry was
intensely localized, mainly due to a widespread availability of the necessary
72 Curzon, vol. 1, p. 330.

THE ARTS OF THE I8TH-2OTH CENTURIES
ingredients and difficulties oftransport and communications, which would
have rendered trading from afew main centres impractical. Rochechouart lists
the most centres, naming Hamadan, Kashan, Mashhad, Na°in, Natanz, Qazvin,
Qum and Tehran, supplemented byOlmer who adds Maibud near Yazd.
Curiously neither Isfahan nor Shiraz, which were both important tile manufac
turing centres, are mentioned. The 19th-century Persian source - the Jughrafiya
yi Isfahan of MIrza Husain — however, does specifically mention a subdivision of
the guild of potters who made flacons, jars, goblets, cooking pots, waterpipes
all strictly utilitarian wares.73
Qajar ceramics may broadly be classified into two main categories — unglazed
everyday wares and more elaborate glazed and painted wares, of which there are
several types.
Unglazed earthenware formed the most widely used class for everyday use,
employing basic shapes that have remained virtually unchanged. This at its most
humble level consisted of sun-dried clay on sale onthe Isfahan bazaar as
recorded by Dr Wills: "Pans for charcoal, jars for the storing of grain, are made
of sun-dried clay, while a variety of burnt clay articles are exposed for sale."74 A
wider choice of vessels was available inkiln-fired earthenware, and although
they were doubtless made in many places, Qum and Kashan seem to have
specialized in types of good quality. Rochechouart, Olmer and Polak all
comment on the porous earthenware drinking vessels — a/kare^as — madeat
Qum, which could be either plain or decorated with figure and foliage designs in
trailed slip. Olmer additionally remarks on the clay used in these vessels: "A
Qoum, on emploie l'argile impregnee de sulfate de soude, qu'on trouve, ensi
grande quantite dans les environs."75 According to Wills other porous contain
ers and drinking vessels were on sale atIsfahan "This ware ispale greenish
yellow and very fragile; the best is made at Kashan."76 Incontrast to these
strictly utilitarian wares, more sophisticated materials and techniques were
employed in the groups of glazed wares, which may conveniently be divided
into three types on a basis of glaze and decoration: monochrome, underglaze
painted and overglazed painted ceramic.
Monochrome glazed wares formed the largest group and were related in
shape and function to the unglazed everyday pottery. They were made through
out the 19th century and are still in production today. Wills sumarizes the main
uses and colours which he found on sale inIsfahan: "a variety of burnt clay
articles are exposed for sale; cheap kalian and chibouque heads, flower pots of
73 MIrza Husain Khan, trans., p . 83 (text, p .94). 74XXZills, ch.17, p .191. 75 Olmer, p . 51. 7& Wills, loc. cit.

CERAMICS
blue, green and purple glaze." While Olmer mentions copper green, turquoise,
and yellow glazes, and attributes a violet glaze to Maibud: "A Meiboud (40
kilometres au nord de Yezd) on fait des grandes jarres tres solides, dont le vernis
ete colore en violet. Je ne sais pas le procede employe." Rochechouart gives
further details about types and centres of manufacture of monochromes, saying
that earthenware bottles, qalyan bases etc. with turquoise glaze were made at
Qum, Hamadan, Qazvin and Kashan, the products of the latter being of
especially good quality, involving the employment of about 100 potters.77 From
this it is evident that the commonest glaze was turquoise, which was easily made
by combining copper oxides in an alkaline-based glaze. This technique was of
ancient lineage in Persia, as it is known from large turquoise-glazed storage jars
of the late Sasanian—early Islamic period. The wares during the Qajar period
were generally made of a fine-textured orange or buff earthenware, the colour
varying according to locally available clays, in simple shapes — open bowls,
dishes, globular vases, pear-shaped vases with cylindrical necks etc., the quality
and colour of the glaze again varying with the purity of the ingredients used.
The wares in which glazing was combined with painted decoration obviously
provided more scope for variation, as is demonstrated by a range of surviving
pieces. While their techniques are explicit, they do, however, present problems
of identity concerning exact attribution and date. There are, for instance, certain
discrepancies between the European descriptions and the wares themselves.
Some general observations, however, emerge, which throw revealing sidelights
on the significance of the import trade in ceramics. Rochechouart in his
observations on the distinguishing qualities of contemporary polychrome wares
notes that mainstream influence in design is Chinese, though he does not make it
clear whether this is direct or at secondhand from the many types of European
imported ceramics whose patterns had also been inspired by Far Eastern
models.78
Contemporary evidence also supports the view that the ceramics were made
in local centres and that attempts to introduce modern methods failed because
there was no demand for them. For example "A porcelain factory belonging to
Hajji Muhammad Hasan Amln al-Zarb in Tehran, and another belonging to
Hajji Abbas All and Hajji Riza in Tabriz, which had to close down because of
Russian intrigues and cost the above mentioned close to 130,000 tumans in
losses."79 It seems that the Russians did not want their own ceramic imports
threatened by improved local products.

THE ARTS OF THE l 8 T H - 2 O T H CENTURIES
The fabric of polychrome glazed wares offered more choice. Earthenware
continued to beused varying in quality of colour and texture, but another
material was widely used, a composite paste made up of finely ground white clay
quartz and aglassy frit. This produced afabric varying from granular pinkish
buff to a fine hard white texture and had been used inPersian ceramics since
Saljuq times. Both Olmer and Rochechouart give recipes for this fabric and also
for the glazes used with it.
Both earthenware and the composite fabric were used for wares decorated
with designs painted before glazing. Qum, inaddition toits monochromes,
produced lamps and plates painted with designs in black before the application
of a transparent turquoise glaze. A more distinguished group of wares is painted
with designs in blue and attributed to Na3in by both Rochechouart and Olmer,
whose accounts are reasonably detailed. Rochechouart says that Na°In wares are
the only contemporary ones tobe signed and dated and that they are painted
with designs in cobalt blue. He is clear that they are made of a white composite
paste, which he compares with the texture of English porcelain. The designs he
relates to a mixture of Chinoiserie landscapes with pagodas into which Persian
type birds and cypress trees are blended. Olmer's account is more clear techni
cally, ashedescribes material, glaze, composition of colours used, and the
process by which designs are first pounced in outline, painted and then glazed.
Rochechouart additionally states that underglaze painted blue pottery was made
at Natanz, but apart from saying that the paste and glaze are inferior to those of
Na°In, does not give any distinguishing features. It istherefore preferable to
attempt to identify surviving examples of 19th-century blue and white ceramics
with the products of Na°in (pi. 5 5a). Such wares were fashioned in a granular
white paste which is pinkish-buff when exposed during firing, and formed into
well-shaped shallow dishes, bowls with convex sides etc. A sequence of dated
and signed examples are recorded ranging from 1281 (A.D. 1864—5)to 1318 (A.D.
1900—1), but production continued up to 1935 when carpet weaving replacedit
as a more profitable industry. Designs were painted ina bright cobalt blue,
which tended to run during firing, and included both the Chinese pagodas noted
by Rochechouart, Persian birds and fishes, and also sprigs of flowers, which
were perhaps inspired by imports ofcontemporary Staffordshire pottery.
Other examples of underglaze painted pottery employing a polychrome
technique may be related to the Na°In products. The fabric, glaze and shapes are
similar, but the designs are rather sketchily painted in cobalt blue, manganese
purple, brownish pink and black outline. They consist ofsprays of flowers
among rocks, amalgamating Chinese, Persian and contemporary European

motifs. While these polychrome underglaze wares are difficult to date more
specifically than 19th century, a later group can be dated precisely and demon
strates a readily identifiable style. There is a representative collection of these
wares in the ceramic collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, where they
are recorded as having been made at Tehran in 1887; they were acquired at the
same time as a technically and stylistically related group of tiles, obtained by
Robert Murdoch Smith during his last visit to Persia in that year. They are made
of a white composite paste of superior quality and texture to that of the Na°In
wares (pi. 55^), which is covered with a lustrous transparent alkaline glaze,
which is usually well-fitting but has a tendency to crackle. The underglaze
painted designs are in a varied palette of cobalt blue, turquoise, a subdued olive
green, purple, yellow, pink and with black used to outline motifs and to create
effects of hatching and shading. The shapes are accomplished and well potted in
such varied forms as chalices, pear-shaped vessels with either flaring trumpet or
long narrow necks, and flat-sided flasks, all with parallels in either the Persian or
Far Eastern tradition. The designs are carefully organized into panels and
medallions of fanciful shape and containing roses and carnations, reserved
against a contrasting background, consisting of continuous bands of floral
garland, zigzag and foliate scroll, and geometrical borders which serve mainly to
section off areas of motifs. The painting is fluent, relying on washes of colour
and the use of black outlining and shading to give a naturalistic effect. Several of
the pieces are signed by the potter Husain and Murdoch Smith indeed refers to
"a number of modern vases made by the same potter Ali Mahommed who made
the tiles above referred to",80 indicating that, at least for this group of wares,
potter and tilemaker might be the same. Curiously this distinctive group is not
mentioned by Olmer, who was certainly in Persia during the period when they
were produced. It did become known in Europe however to a certain extent, as
examples were on sale in the Persian section of the 1889 Paris exhibition.
The group of wares decorated in overglaze painted enamel colours cannot be
linked satisfactorily with any of the contemporary descriptions, yet dated pieces
show that they were in production by the first half of the 19th century.
Rochechouart, for example, attributes a polychrome composite paste ware
painted in iron red, cobalt blue, copper green, chrome yellow, iron black,
manganese violet, turquoise blue and orange-red, to Natanz and a less compe
tent version of the same ware to Kashan. He omits to state, however, whether
the colours were applied before or after glazing. Probably the latter technique

was used because most of the colours listed could only withstand the low heat of
a secondary firing needed tofixthem. He also gives no specific descriptionof
designs. In the absence of such identifying clues it is preferable to leave the
question of provenance ofoverglaze polychrome wares open. While generally
speaking the Persian taste for colourful pottery was satisfied by imports from
Europe and the Far East, of which examples are depicted in early Qajar paintings
- mainly famille-rose bowls and dishes with lavish sprays of roses and reticulate
borders — a recognizable group of Persian polychrome wares was manufactured
of which many pieces have survived. They were potted in a fine-textured
orange-buff earthenware and covered with an opaque white tin oxide alkaline
glaze, which prepared a surface suitable for decoration painted in bright enamels
- cobalt blue, purple, rose pink, yellow, grass green, iron red, black and touches
of gold. The shapes are flamboyant — large bowls and dishes, long necked vases
- while the designs present an amalgam of Chinese and Persian motifs. From a
series inthe Victoria and Albert Museum alarge bowl signed by All Akbar of
Shiraz and dated 1262 (A.D. 1846) shows these features, and isunabashed inits
eclecticism (pi. 55/?).81 Both surfaces are extensively decorated. The interior
sports a Qajar Lion and Sun framed by a fluently composed border ofChinese
figures, trees, butterflies, rocks and peonies, with small Persian dervish figures
lurking among them. Persian themes dominate the underside, which is sectioned
into panels depicting traditional hunting scenes, ladies' receptions, and the
theme of Shaikh Sancan and the Christian maiden, all sectioned off by borders of
the crowded peony and chrysanthemum patterns of famille-rose wares madeat
Canton for the export trade. The presence, however, ofthe carefully executed
traditional Persian motifs suggests some comparison with similar representa
tions in the meticulously painted lacquers and enamelled gold objects. The
ceramics were possibly a cheaper means of imitating them. Other polychrome
wares show how far designs migrated. There is, for example, a plate painted with
a Chinese-inspired asymmetrical design of a crane among rocks, flowering
peonies and chrysanthemums, which is more closely related to an original
copied by the English ceramic firm ofMason onto its ironstone china, rather
than to the Chinese original.
The last group of overglaze decorated wares, namely those painted in lustre,
is little known. Lustre painting was thought to have died outafter a brief
resurgence in the 17th century, butit has now been shown to have had a
continouous history upto the 19th century, both in ceramic objects and tile

production. Two objects, a vase and a jar in the Victoria and Albert Museum's
collection, demonstrate the main features. They are potted in a granular pinkish
buff composite paste and painted in golden brown lustre over a white tin oxide
glaze. They are painted with crowded designs in a technique comparable with
that of contemporary manuscript illustration, as is shown by the seated mascu
line figures on the sides of the jar (pi. 570).
In general the modern Persian ceramic industry essentially continues the
traditions of the Qajar period, though at times increasingly under threat from
the pressures of industrialization and the import of cheap foreign wares. As in
Qajar times, workshops are small and localized and are declining in number
except where there is sufficient demand for traditionally inspired wares. The
monochrome turquoise glazed everyday wares — vases, flowerpots, qalyan pipe
bases, shallow bowls — continue to be widely made. Recently the shallow bowls,
once much in demand as yoghurt containers, were being replaced by plastic
ones. Production of the underglaze blue painted wares, a speciality of Na°In, had
already spread to Maibud in the late 19th century, where it continues today,
though on a much reduced scale with a limited range of patterns. The produc
tion of underglaze painted composite paste wares now is the monopoly of
Isfahan. They are of interest in that they continue traditional techniques which
were curiously not featured as one of Isfahan's special crafts by the 19th-century
Europeans who concerned themselves with Persia's ceramic wares.
METALWORK
The craft of metalworking was rather more healthily based in the Qajar period
than that of ceramics. Metal was required for a much wider range of luxury and
everyday objects and less at the mercy of competition from technically superior
European imports. Unlike ceramics, metalwork is featured in references
throughout 18th- and 19th-century sources which indicate how worthy of
mention it was. The East India Company report of the late 18th century, for
example, briefly summarising Iran's products, features "steel sword blades,
spearheads . . . mines of iron and copper".82 John Malcolm's assessment of
Persian manufactures of 1801 states that they include ironwork, gold and silver
articles and enamelled work. He cites Isfahan for its gold brocades, swords,
other arms, and "utensils in gold, silver, iron, steel and brass". Shlraz is
mentioned for "guns, pistols, swords and other military arms," and "articles of

gold and silver", and "enamelled work".83 Clearly a securely based industry
catered for awide range of local needs, but the sources indicate no surplus for
export. The trade situation was rather the opposite: during the 19th century
metal products faced competition from Russian imports. Abbott's trade report
of 1841 records imports of "Russian iron, copper, hardware and glassware
through Gilan at£i5,ooo".84 In 1904, H.W. Maclean remarked that Russian
"metalwork, lamps, candlesticks, enamelled ironware" were considered "better
in quality and finish at a given price than formerly".85 Yet it is evident that local
metalwork included luxury goods in enamelled gold and silver as well as more
mundane products in copper, brass, iron, steel etc. Persian metals enamelled in
polychrome enamels bear designs and are treated ina manner and technique
directly comparable with those used in painted lacquers and have been discussed
in chapter 23 (seee.g. pi. 28a,b),so that this section will concentrate on objects in
other metals.
Qajar metalwork was another stage in a continuous history of metalworking
in Iran. The country has metal ores, which have been exploited since the 5 th
millennium B.C. By the 19th century copper was the most plentiful inwidely
distributed deposits, as observers noticed.86 Deposits in Anarak near Kashan are
still mined today using improved and up-to-date techniques. Also silver, lead,
zinc, antimony and arsenic are found near Tehran on the northern slopes of the
Alburz mountains, in the neighbourhood of Qazvin and Mashhad, and at
Qaradagh near Tabriz, the site of one of the most productive mines in the 19th
century.87 There were also rich supplies of iron ore, especially at Amul in
Mazandaran and in Khurasan, while lead was mined in the Bibi Shahrbanu hills
south of Tehran and at Kirman, and tin ore in the Qaradagh ranges of Tabriz and
on the southern slopes of the Alburz mountains near Astarabad. Stream tinwas
found near Anarak and Mashhad, both close to copper mines so that it is not
difficult to see how methods of producing copper and tinalloys evolved.
Despite this mineral wealth, however, 19th-century European sources show
that lack of full exploitation was due to lack of adequate facilities. Polak
comments on backwardness inmining skill and capability inusing machines
from Europe. Consequently indigenous metal sources had to be supplemented
by importing supplies. Russia exported quantities of copper and iron from the

Urals, brass and iron sheetware and zinc, while England supplied worked iron
and India, tin and iron to southern Iran.88
A wide range of specialist craftsmen existed to work materials made avail
able. They included coppersmiths for the production of everyday cooking and
household utensils, brassworkers who made both everyday and more ornate
vessels in co-operation with brass finishers and polishers, tinsmiths and highly
skilled workers who applied decorative techniques of repousse, engraving,
niello and inlay in gold and silver, and those who worked in iron and steel,
especially armourers and cutlers. Such craftsmen would be organized into guilds
and have workshops in a city's main bazaars and elsewhere. Mirza Husain's
geography of Isfahan details the many specialist metalworkers based there, of
whom the brass and coppersmiths and locksmiths were flourishing in the late
19th century. He mentions another group of metalworkers who may be linked
with textile production: the craftsmen who produced silver and gold wire thread
for brocade weaving.89 Copper was mostly used for everyday wares worked in
traditional shapes and still in production today, though increasingly giving way
to factory made products of aluminium and white-metal alloys. The chief items
were cooking pots of various sizes, open flat trays, spouts of water containers
and larger boilers for heating water for the hammam. These containers came in
different sizes of the same basic shape - a wide based bowl with deep straight
sides contracting slightly towards the mouth and with a narrow averted rim.
They were made in various stages of hammering and annealing sheet copper.
Small vessels were worked out of one piece. Larger ones required separate
sections for the base and sides to be soldered with a dove-tail joint. The demand
for these explains the copper imports from Russia, to supplement local supplies.
After the coppersmith had completed his work the vessels, especially those to be
used for food preparation, went t( > the tinsmith who surfaced the interiors with a
thin layer of tin; he also resurfaced old cooking-vessels.
The craft of the brassworker while overlapping to some extent with that of
the coppersmith was more versatile and included the preparation of finely
decorated as well as everyday objects. Here Qajar craftsmen followed a tradition
established in medieval times. Brass has become one of the most favoured metals
for vessels, bowls, candlesticks, and boxes, and no anomaly was seen in
decorating them with finely worked designs inlaid in precious gold and silver.
By the late 15 th century this decorative technique had given way to one in which

designs were worked ina combination ofrepousse and engraving, creating a
surface of several levels of fine relief. The design repertoire also changed to
include motifs of graceful foliage stems and tendrils trained into repeating and
spiralling scrolls, medallions and continuous borders with flowers andoc
casionally human figures reserved against them. This decorative style which
continued to develop in the Safavid period, matching the flamboyant peony and
lotus-studded foliage designs oftilework and carpet, was inherited by Qajar
craftsmen who further modified it.
One ofthe busiest centres ofbrass working was Isfahan where all typesof
wares were made Mirza Husain records of the 1880s that "they have abig long
special bazaar near the Maidan-i Naksh-i Jahan" where "they make samovars
and other vessels that do not differ much from those of other countries".90 In the
making of samovars, however, introduced from Russia in the 19th century, they
faced competition: "brass and iron sheetware, especially the popular Russian
samovar are almost entirely imported from Russia".91 Other strictly practical
objects made by the brassworker included low rectangular or octagonal charcoal
braziers used for heating rooms or cooking small meals, cooking vessels tinned
like their copper counterparts, dishes and trays forserving food, and water
ewers. Another practical craft was the making of discs to serve as tops and bases
for the cylindrical lanterns made of oiled linen and used during the 19th century
to light the way through awinding street at night before the introduction of gas
street lighting. Items serving more luxurious and decorative purposes were
made, such assets ofewers and perforated basins used forwashing hands at
meals, rosewater containers, ornate candlesticks often with several heads,
incense burners used forburning aromatic gums and plants, traditionally at
marriage festivities and funerals, qalyan bases, large ornaments often in the form
of peacocks or phoenix, and personal accessories such as pen cases, and cosmetic
boxes (pis 56, )-jb,c,d).92 Shapes generally tended tobe extravagantly curved
lampstands with cylindrical stems, ewers with flattened circular bodies, long
necks, graceful handles and spouts, covered bowls and containers of a globular
or pear-shape, often with pointed covers and set on high pedestal feet. The bold
curved shapes were set off by the meticulous nature of the decorative techniques
and motifs employed.
Of the many techniques for decorating surfaces, the most frequently used by
the late 19th century, at least atIsfahan, was a combination ofengraving and

piercing. Engraved sections of the design were worked in fine outline with
details of background and features such as leaves either punched as a series of
fine dots or drawn with hatched lines. Where pierced decoration was used, as in
incense burners and vase covers, the same techniques applied with the back
ground completely cut away. At their best, designs worked in these two
techniques are graceful and ingenious with a controlled richness of surface
texture and are naturally dependent on the choice of motifs and finesse of
execution. From a comparison of the many surviving pieces so worked it is
possible to itemize the main repertoire of motifs combined in various ways.
Bands of finely worked zigzag tendril on a punched ground were used as borders
and edgings, either singly or in multiple rows. A commonly used device for
broad sweeps of background was a spiralling lotus-scroll of foliage tendril
trained into interlacing and overlapping lobed medallions. This motif could
either be engraved or worked in the openwork technique. Spaced against the
background were medallions of various shapes including ovals, circles and
scalloped lozenges. When circles and ovals were sometimes crowded into a
consecutively organized repeating design, their outlines were defined by sinu
ous stems terminating in dragon heads. Within the medallions there was much
scope for variation in the choice of finely engraved motifs, such as single animal
figures, lions, gazelles, rabbits shown in profile, human figures (usually seated
royal personages), equestrian figures, creatures of legend and fantasy, such as
horned demons, animal combat motifs, including a lion attacking a cow or
struggling with a dragon, zodiac emblems and group compositions rendered in
miniature using hunting scenes and feasts with dancers and musicians. All these
themes continue traditions established in medieval metalwork, but differing in
detail.
Another area of the brassworkers' skill was the production of cult objects and
the talismans of popular religion. Shici Islam has a rich heritage of such
traditions. Among the most striking, of which examples may still be seen, is the
saqqakhana^ a public drinking fountain privately donated and made of sheet brass
with a cylindrical tank from which three domes project. The largest central
dome has an outstretched hand, the symbol of Abbas, the standard bearer
whose hand was cut off while bearing water to a wounded son of the Imam
Husain at Karbala. Brass drinking bowls are attached to the tank by chains. Also
found in other metals, iron or base silver, were tiny boxes to contain verses from
the Qur^an and worn as amulets, discs engraved with the Lion and Sun device
and worn on both arms as talismans to keep up the wearer's strength, and

plaques engraved with figures of women and used bywives ascharms to ward

The accounts ofcontemporary European travellers and officials indicate that
Persia's manufactures in thefield of weapons andarms and armour enjoyed a
high reputation, especially during the Qajar period. Indeed examples of
damascened steel spearheads, daggers, shields and helmets have survived to
support this testimony. Persian smiths were expert in the difficult technique of
forging steel to produce the watered silk effect known as damascening and
decorated with interlacing designs worked in gold and silver inlay. As the 19th
century progressed the role and products of the workers insteel changed, mainly
through economic andsocial pressures. They were busy enough in late19th
century Isfahan according toMIrza Husain — "they make steel parts such as top
parts of water pipes [sar-iqa/jan], sword grips [kumak-i shamshlr\, saucers for
coffee cups, belts, lampions, Qur^an cases \qab-i qur^an haikalz], steel helmets,
pedals ofmiddle parts ofwater pipes, iron mounting [qubba], ofshields and a lot
of utensils. Nowadays their products are used more than before. The members
of this guild were formerly few innumber; now they are still not abig group but
there is a demand for their work andit is exported to Turkey and Egypt."94
Several points arise from this account.
Clearly the steelworkers' reputation had continued sufficiently fora demand
for their work tobesought abroad. The bulk ofthe objects made, however,are
practical and utilitarian. The only examples ofthe armourer's craft are the steel
helmets and parts ofshields. Formerly aspecialist armourer would have been in
continuous employment fashioning helmets, chainmail shirts, cuirasses and
brassards. However, with the reign ofMuhammad Shah (1834—48) thePersian
army experienced a drastic change of dress. Among the military reforms
initiated byHenry Rawlinson atthe request ofthe Persian Government wasthe
introduction of European-style cloth uniform, rendering thearmourer's craft
obsolete. Thesurviving photographs of Persians in armour of the late19th
century depict performers in a tacziya play.95 Isfahan was the centre of a
flourishing theatrical tradition so that it is possible that this accounts for the
shields and helmets referred toby Mirza Husain. It isinteresting tonote thathe
does notdifferentiate specialists: presumably they could allturn their hand to
making armour ofa decent enough theatrical standard. Weapons continued to
be made, though changed in character to suit the new military fashions; spears
and battleaxes were nolonger used but swords were anindispensable accessory

to Persian as much as to contemporary western military uniforms. According to
Polak the blades of Shiraz and Mashhad enjoyed a good reputation for quality.
Otherwise firearms, rifles and pistols made to European models in the arsenals
of Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz dominated.96 At a more peaceful level, apart from
the type of ironmongery mentioned by Mirza Husain, steelsmiths directed their
efforts to the manufacture of cutlery, again imitated from European models, and
such items as scissors and locks. Among the objects of their craft which combine
function and decoration were the graceful pan-balances used for weighing gold
in the mints, and the perhaps fanciful versions of the gourd-shaped dervish's
begging wallet which could be lavishly ornamented with engraved designs and
inscriptions and further embellished with gold inlay. The technique of inlay, like
the use of steel, had changed. Murdoch Smith writing in 1876 states that by this
time two methods were used:
(1) fine gold or silver wire was applied to the surface of the article which had
been roughened and scratched to make it adhere; the work was then
finished by burnishing;
(2) a much more skimped method was used of simply fixing gold leaf to the
metal steel surface by rubbing and burnishing with an agate or similar hard
stone.
TEXTILES
Persia has a long tradition of excellence in the textile arts, outstanding for
versatility in both material and technique. Luxurious silks, for example, of
complex weave and design were famous from Sasanian times onwards. Persia's
fame in the textile arts extended well beyond her frontiers. Medieval silks are
recorded in the inventories of the Holy See in Rome for 1295 and have been
found preserved in church treasuries at Regensburg and Danzig. Persian carpets
are featured in medieval European paintings and were exported in Safavid times
to Poland, while examples of Safavid costume were desirable items to be
presented as diplomatic gifts. Textiles played a dominant role in many aspects of
Persian life. Apart from their obvious use for clothing and accessories they were
especially important as domestic furnishings. At all levels of traditional life
elaborate suites of free-standing furniture were not used. Rooms were empty by
Western European standards, with floors covered by soft carpets worked in
various techniques, and niches set into the walls to hold objects. The only other

items might be chests, bookstands, and braziers for heating and cooking.
Otherwise a room's main furnishings consisted of additional textiles — curtains,
cloths spread out on the floor at mealtimes, bedding, quilts, cushions; this lack
of fixed furniture meant that rooms were more adaptable than in the West. Apart
from these textiles of settled life, a vigorous parallel tradition existed in the
fabrics woven for tents, furnishings and animal trappings used by migratory
tribes. These textile traditions continued into the Qajar period when, although
faced by competition from imported machine-made goods, they still produced
creations of fine workmanship and design, ranging from the work of profes
sional weavers to the embroideries produced in a domestic environment.
European sources for the 18thand 19thcenturies present a consistent picture of
a viable textile industry. In the 1780s for example it was noted that among other
items "The manufactures and produce of Persia are silks, brocades, carpets",97
thus presenting a pattern essentially unchanged since Safavid times. This
situation evidently continued into the early 19th century to judge from the
specific notes taken by Sir John Malcolm during his visit of 1801:"The
manufactures of Persia that are in demand all over that Empire, are silks of
various kinds, coarse cotton cloths, plain and coloured Nummuds, cotton
cloths, Kirmaun shawls, gold cloths etc".98
He specifies Isfahan, Yazd, Kashan and Rasht as thriving centres of textile
production, notably of silks, gold brocades, fine wools and carpets. These
fabrics were of sufficient interest to be exported and were especially important in
the transit trade centres of Turkey and Egypt. They were generally brought
westwards by Persian travellers: "These men some of whom are real Persians,
some Armenians and some Turkomans from the Khanates of Bukhara and
Khiva, undertake their long journeys not always out of commercial interest but
in order to make the pilgrimage to Mecca or for some other reason. They always
pick up, within their financial means, goods in the Persian producing towns
through which they pass, usually weapons, lacquer work, marquetry, shawls,
rugs and silk fabrics. With these they trade during the whole of their journey.
Part of their stock is sold in Erzerum and Trebizond, the greater part in
Constantinople, and the rest in Smyrna or Alexandria. The proceeds serve for
the purchase of European manufactures, which they sell in the remote towns of
Asia from which they came."99 Apart from these resourceful travellers there was
a group who traded on a more regular basis, especially the Armenians from

Tabriz, Tiflis and Erivan who brought shawls and precious stones to Constan
tinople in exchange for European manufactured goods.
Evidence emerges early for the competition offered to Persian textiles by
imports. According to the Russian traveller, L. Berezin, by 1836 cottons,
calicos, broadcloth, muslins and velvets were being imported into Tabriz; for
example 10,000 parcels of English cottons and calico with a value of two and half
million silver rubles."100 In return Tabriz sold large quantities of silk, dyes and
shawls. This competition from foreign textile imports was to continue and
increase throughout the 19th century. By 1904 woollen, cotton and silk materi
als were being imported from France and Austria, but the monopoly in bright
printed cottons was held by Russia.101
In contrast, Iran's textile exports mainly consisted of carpets to Europe,
America and Turkey, while their silks, cottons and wools were channelled into
an Asian market consisting of Afghanistan and Turkey. Raw cotton was,
however, exported to Russia and much of it, ironically, must have made the
return journey as woven cloth.
Iran did attempt to counteract the challenge of imported European textiles.
Efforts were made to establish textile enterprises during the first half of the 19th
century, such as a linen factory in Isfahan, and two silk-reeling factories, one in
Gllan equipped with machinery sent from Lyons by the Berthaud firm and
another near Rasht, founded with Russian capital, but which failed because of
political intrigues and poor management. A much more concentrated series of
projects would, however, have been necessary to produce goods effectively to
eliminate foreign imports. The Amlr-i Kabir, Mirza Taqi Khan, Nasir-al-Din
Shah's prime minister from 1848 to 1851, was concerned to develop local
industry. He established a calico-weaving factory on the Tehran-Shamlran road
and a silk factory in Kashan. He was also interested in the establishment of a
broadcloth factory and gave instructions for master craftsmen from Austria and
Prussia to be hired to teach Persians the necessary techniques.102
One of the most important textile industries of Qajar Iran was silk-weaving.
Combining the evidence of contemporary accounts with information deduced
from surviving examples, it is possible to construct a reasonably clear picture of
the situation and the competition offered by European imports. Sources exist
for studying the industry from the early 19th century onwards. Sir John

THE ARTS OF THE I8TH-2OTH CENTURIES
Malcolm's report of 1801, for example, while stating generally that silksof
various kinds and gold cloths were much in demand throughout Persia, more
specifically records: "The silks manufactured at Resht, are more esteemed than
any other in Persia. They bear a higher price than those of Cashaun and Yezd,
and their consumption is thereinfore not so great."103 The importance of Rasht
is hardly surprising. It is the major city of the Caspian provinces of Gilan and
Mazandaran, long the major centres of silkworm cultivation. Later the British
Consul at Tehran, K.E. Abbott, who periodically visited the Caspian region to
study the silk industry, reported in 1849—50 that Kashan had 800 silk loomsin
operation, Isfahan 200 and Yazd 300 to 350.104 It would seem that Rasht had
declined from its prominence in the silk industry as Abbott's comments agree
with the observations of Jakob Polak, who was writing about Persian handi
crafts and manufactures of the 1850s.105 His account, while lacking precise
figures of workshops in production, gives more detail about the types of
product. He also gives some indication of the quality of these products and the
challenge they faced from European imports. He lists Kashan, Yazd — "which
makes the most beautiful fabrics" - Isfahan, Tabriz and Mashhad as the most
important centres of manufacture. While conceding that Persian silks have good
colourfast dyes, he generally thinks that they are inferior to European products.
The specialities of each area were plain taffeta at Kashan and Mashhad, checked
designs at Yazd and Isfahan, and door curtains from Gilan. More elaborate
brocades with gold floral designs and twillweave jacquard silks woven with
palms, wreathes and patterned borders, were woven at Kashan and Yazd
respectively. European competition was particularly strong insuch fabrics as
moire silk and velvet.
Murdoch Smith writing 20 years later in 1876 testifies that the centresof
Yazd, Kashan and Rasht were still in production. He is more precise about the
products of Isfahan. There patterned gold and silver brocade was made up into
the petticoats and trousers of Persian women's costume.106 The picture which
emerges isgeneral, concentrating on the main areas ofproduction with only
brief references tothe textiles. The sources reveal little about the craftsmen
involved, the degree ofspecialization required, and the classification ofthe
textiles; but the questions thus left unanswered can to some extent be resolved
by reference toPersian sources and by analysis ofsurviving textiles.

Concerning the conditions of work and specialists involved, Mirza Husain,
writing in 1877, is informative about the situation in Isfahan.107 Traditionally
Isfahan had been an important centre for the manufacture of sophisticated silk
brocades lavishly embellished with gold and silver thread. Mirza Husain shows
that a nucleus of skilled craftsmen was still at work, but he notes that their
numbers had declined through lack of commissions and because of emigration
to the more prosperous towns of Tehran and Tabriz. Despite this his account is
enlightening on the condition of a once flourishing industry. He carefully
distinguishes between craftsmen who supplied materials and those who carried
out the weaving. There were, therefore, groups of craftsmen who prepared
silver and gold wire, which was then passed over to the brocade weavers. He
says that the designs used were prepared by master painters and then copied into
a format suitable for a weaver's chart.
Evidence of the types of silk and brocade woven is provided by surviving
examples and fabrics depicted in 19th-century oil paintings whose meticulous
style is invaluable for detail of costume, jewellery, etc. (pis. 9, 12, 13^, 18, 19, 20,
zia). Several weaves of silk were used. There were fine plain weaves dyed in
colours of black, dark green, dark blue and also more intense bright reds and
oranges. From the more elaborate weaves the most outstanding are the complex
brocaded textiles which involved the combination of metallic threads wound
round a silk core, and coloured silks. Generally in this type of brocade the
metallic threads were used to give a closely-woven subtle background on which
designs were worked in coloured silks — crimson, purple, blue, yellow, green
often using floating wefts to give a satin effect. Such textiles of a high quality in
both technique and design continued the traditions of Safavid weaving. The
design motifs, however, are different, principally consisting of variations on
repeated floral sprigs or pointed cones. Other than silk the wool weaves of
Persia had a high reputation. Here the most notable type was a fine twill weave
using goat fleece woven into elaborate repeating patterns closely resembling
those of the Kashmir shawls which were made at Kirman. Malcolm in 1801
refers to the shawls of Kirman as one of the manufactures of Persia so much in
demand that Yazd shawls of a wool and silk mixture were woven in an attempt to
capture some of the market.108 The Kirman shawls were made of a special type of
fibre, namely the underfleece of a particular species of white goat. When spun
this fleece produced a woollen thread of the desired fine and silky texture. The
manufacture of these shawls flourished at the time of Abbott's visit of 1849-50.

He records 2,200 shawl-weaving looms in the town. T oa lesser extent shawls
were also woven at Mashhad, but of a cheaper and inferior quality to those of
Kirman.109 Shawl fabrics were much indemand for mens' coats, either the short
long-sleeved jacket orthe long full-skirted frock coat which, alternating with a
plain dark coat, became standard dress among officials from the 1840s on
wards.110 Surviving examples oftextiles show that the main colours were either
natural cream or deep red,woven in a firm even 2 X 2twill. Considerably
sophisticated polychrome effects were achieved byusing wefts of blue, green,
orange, and yellow, worked with subtlety and skill into well-composed designs
based on the traditional floral cone, which achieved an integrated surface texture
by overlapping stems and tendrils. They are among the most successful textiles
of 19th-century Persia in quality of technique and composition, whose repeating
patterns made them especially suitable for cutting andmaking into clothes.
A distinctive group of textiles were thecotton calicos printed with vivid
polychrome designs by means of carved wooden blocks. These qalamkarl
textiles were the speciality ofIsfahan and have been made there atleast since the
17th century. They are mentioned admiringly by the jeweller Chardin: " Awork
they understand very well is overlaying with Gold andSilver Linnen Cloth,
TafTety and Settin; they do it with Moulds, andrepresent on them what they
please, viz. Letters, Flowers, and Figures; and they stamp them so neatly that
you would think 'tis Gold or Silver embroidery. They print with Gum
water."111
This isclearly a reference toqalamkar work, and some ofthe techniques and
processes described by Chardin can be identified from the more detailed
accounts preserved inlater sources. Apart from this specialized function, basic
cotton cloth waswoven by households to supply their everyday needs for
clothing and furnishing. Additionally, a firm strong cloth was woven profes
sionally at Qum, Simnan and Abada, while a finer more close-textured fabric
which would take dyes well was made at Isfahan, Yazd andKashan.112 The
domestic industry, however, did experience competition from imported cottons
by the 1850s: "The most widely used calicos inPersia (chit) are usually supplied
by Manchester factories, where goods are made tosuit Persian taste and forsale
in the Orient. The merchandise comes either directly from England through the
Greek firm of Ralli brothers or through intermediaries in Constantinople,
Trebizond, and Tabriz".113

By the 1870s the monopoly of fine cotton cloth had, according to Murdoch
Smith, passed to the foreign imports. Writing about qalamkarl he says: "In
former days very fine cotton cloths were woven in Persia, but their manufacture
has now ceased owing to the introduction of the cheaper fabrics of England. The
finer kind of printing is therefore now applied to foreign cloths only".114
Supporting evidence of this economic situation is also independently provided
by contemporary Persian sources. Mirza Husain records of the Isfahan bazaar:
"All of them are workshops of the textile printers and they comprise 284 shops,
stores \hujra\and manufacturies \karkhand\. Their products are still used all over
Iran, but the European textiles have ruined their market and not even half of the
original number remain."115
Whether the material used for block printing was of Persian or foreign
manufacture nothing could detract from the charm of the end product, made up
into many items of clothing — women's trousers and jackets, and furnishings
curtains, bedcovers, tablecloths. The craft and its elaborate series of processes
captured the imagination of 19th-century European residents and visitors in
Isfahan. They have left accounts of varying degrees of detail and accuracy. One
of the processes endlessly recorded was the vivid and colourful scene presented
by the workers who washed and rinsed the lengths of printed calico in the waters
of the Zayinda-rud and spread them on the banks to dry. The account written by
Dr C.J. Wills of the Persian Telegraph Department is particularly
noteworthv.116
These accounts show that repeated washings and rinsings were an essential
part of the process, but this was only the simplest of a complex series of
production stages. The first step involved preparation of the cotton ground
fabric, either left white or dyed a beige yellow with pomegranate rind. Then the
designs were hand-printed using a combination of carved pearwood blocks, one
for each colour. The colours used were based on vegetable and mineral dyes
madder, indigo and pomegranate rind for red, blue and yellow respectively and
an iron compound for black. The selected motifs were printed first in fine black
outline and then coloured in red and blue, using additional blocks carefully
aligned to give a clean impression. Secondary colours of orange and green were
occasionally used and were made by overprinting red on yellow and yellow on
blue respectively. Once all the printing was completed the cloths were thor
oughly dried and then washed at the river. The final results were decorative and
hardwearing with fast colours.117

THE ARTS OF THE l 8 T H - 2 O T H CENTURIES
Despite the relatively limited colour-scheme, much could be achieved bya
careful and imaginative choice of motif. Surviving pieces display a great
versatility of design. The basic repertoire consisted of blocks depicting floral
motifs, leaf scrolls etc. which could be made up into infinitely repeating designs,
or bold individual motifs of peacocks, tigers, elephants, cypress trees, human
figures and medallion segments composed into more ambitious schemes. Cloth
printed with continuous small repeating designs — floral sprigs, floral cones,
lozenges enfolding florets, small zigzag stripes — were particularly suitable for
making up into clothes, such as the closefitting jackets with flared peplum waists
and long trousers worn by women. As an additional luxury some of these cloths
had stippled detail painted in gold; this was clearly the practice of overlaying
with gold and silver described by Chardin. Cloths supplied ready for some
specific purpose, such as a curtain, tablecloth or bed cover, could be printed with
a more formally composed design. Curtains, for example, could be printed with
a one-way design; here afavourite composition of motifs was a tall cypress tree
against a floral background with peacocks and tigers grouped around its roots.
There was scope for more grandiose designs such as compositions clearly related
to miniature paintings of figure and narrative scenes and hunting episodes. Here
many of the details were painted over ablockprinted foundation composition.
Rectangular cloths printed foruse as bedcovers could employ symmetrical
designs and here a close parallel with contemporary carpet design should be
noted. A typical scheme would involve an elaborate circular of quatrefoil central
medallion with a quarter medallion (pi. 5 8) at each corner reserved against a field
of floral scroll, sometimes scattered with birds and framed within a series of
borders and guard strips. Many of the pieces were additionally printed with the
names of the workshop in a neat cartouche at one end; for example many of the
pieces in the Royal Scottish Museum's collection came from the workshop of
Ahmad Muhammad Husain Hajjl Agha.118 Occasionally a cartouche would
include a date. Qalamkari literally means "pen-work": these textile designs
resemble the decorations with which calligraphers adorned manuscripts, both in
motifs and borders ormargins.
Perhaps the most widely used and decoratively varied group of textiles were
those ornamented with embroidery, since all types ofweave and fabric were
used - cotton, wool, silk, velvet. The embroidery itself was worked in an equally
wide range ofthreads - cotton, silk, wool, gold and silver metallic thread.
Embroidery was also acraft as much within the scope of the skills of domestic
needleworkers as of professional craftsmen as itrequired no equipment beyond

the materials, needles and at times a frame, depending on the scale of the work.
Embroidered textiles were used for both articles of clothing and furnishing. In
general a high standard of workmanship and design is common to all types of
Persian embroidered textiles and many techniques of stitch and combination of
colour were explored. Among the most interesting features are the close
relationships with other textile forms both in technique and design; a group of
embroideries from Kirman closely resemble the fine jacquard twill wools, and
many of the designs employed compare closely with the formal arrangements of
medallions and quarter medallions to be found in knotted pile carpets and block
printed textiles.
Since there are problems in the exact identification of Persian embroideries
with centres of origin, it is more practical to group them primarily according to
design and secondarily to provenance, where there is reasonable supporting
evidence. One of the largest groups of embroidered fabrics consists of firmly
woven cotton or silk generally in a creamy white or occasionally lemon yellow
colour, comparable to the background also used for the block printed textiles,
which was then embroidered in silks of strong shades of crimson, orange, blue,
yellow, green and black. Again the colour-scheme may be compared with that of
the block-printed textiles. Nineteenth-century embroideries of this type were
worked in neat outline stitches such as chain stitch and maintained a fine balance
between design and background. Especially fine are a group of small embroid
ered covers used either as prayer mats or simply as floor seats, worked generally
in designs which are variations on a symmetrical scheme based on either central
lobed or circular medallions or flowering trees. The medallions are filled with
radiating palmettes and flowers and may be reserved either against a plain
ground or one scattered with leaf scroll and floral sprays; sometimes the
background was quilted in a repeated lattice.
The tree motifs usually bore stylized poppy or carnation flowers and were
framed within a floral arch. In both types of design the main elements were
confined within a floral scroll border. In such a formally organized scheme the
component motifs were treated in a graceful manner full of movement to
counteract any possibility of stiffness. The parallels with designs of carpets,
printed textiles and the art of the book are evident. Although it is not at present
possible to link them definitely with any known centre, it is probable that they
were made and used over a wide area. The cities of Kashan, Isfahan, Shiraz and
Yazd have been canvassed as main centres. On the basis of such close similarity
with the designs of the printed textiles, so much a speciality of Isfahan, it would
seem that a case could be made for that city at least as a principal centre.
Another specialized type of coloured embroidery relied for its effect by

covering the entire surface of the cloth with closely worked stitches (pi. 59).
Here obviously the ground fabric wasof secondary importance and only
required to beof a sufficiently strong weave to support the density of stitch.
Therefore astrong white cotton calico was used. The basic design was outlined
in back stitch using black ordark blue thread, and all areas were then rilled in
completely in brightly coloured silks or wools in small neat stitches. The final
result resembles contemporary European petit point work, except that the
direction of the stitches is rather more random. The designs invariably consisted
of repeated oblique stripes offlower spray — peony and carnation — and maybe
compared to the compound weaves of bias woven borders in Safavid silk
brocades. Perhaps the embroideries had developed asa cheaper substitute for
these expensive and sophisticated weaves. They were principally used for the
loose trousers ofwomen's costume ofthe late 18th and early 19th century, of
which examples may be seen in contemporary oil paintings.119 Their use for such
and other purposes during this period, and evidence that they were made atleast
in Isfahan, isprovided by Mirza Husain who discusses the embroiderer's guild:
"Everything the painters designed was drawn on qudak, chalvarl[longcloth] etc. and these designs were embroidered completely with a needle, in either pure silk, in kuruk [down], or in threads ofdifferent colours . . . The best were worn by the nobles, the average quality by middle class women. . . . This cloth hadother uses too, such as for mantelshelves \taqcha push], cradles [naQnT\, swaddling clothes [qandaqa], portfolios [mahfaga], cushions of the place of honour of the rooms [pushtlha-yi bala-jiutaq], packsaddles \palan\ and the like. Most of it was sold to customers in Turkey, Egypt, India, Turkistan and Afghanistan. Some also was sold to Europe. . . . From the time of the late Shah [Muhammad Shah, 1834-48] to the present day the trade has gradually declined and fallen into disuse.120
An interesting footnote tothe statement that some ofthis embroidery made
its way to Europe isprovided by two men's waistcoats in the Schweizerisches
Landesmuseum atZurich. They have been made from pieces of this embroidery
worked in anoblique floral striped design byskilful cutting and arranging so
that inone example the stripes converge toa " V " atthe front and inthe other
they slope continuously from left to right. Both waistcoats have been tailored in
the fashion current in Europe during the 1830s and 1840s, which coincides with
the last stages of use of this embroidery in Persian clothes.121

threadwork usually worked in fine white or cream silk on a finely woven cotton
ground of the same colour. Here the effect depends on the contrast between the
texture of the stitch and the sheen of the thread against the background. The
embroidery was worked in blocks of smooth satin-stitch, needleweaving, and
cut and drawn threadwork stitches, all of which required great technical
precision to achieve the final delicacy of effect. The repertoire of design motifs
was varied and based on lozenges, triangles, hexagons etc. to produce formal
geometric patterns. From its very nature this type of needlework was used for
small articles such as covers for gifts and small prayer-mats. One special use was
for a unique accessory of Persian women's outdoor dress - the face-veil. This
consisted of a long rectangular piece of white or cream cotton, occasionally silk,
which was put over the face and fastened behind the head over the black, all
enveloping chadur, a semi-circular cloak draped to form a tent-like conceal
ment. At eye-level the veil waspierced with a hexagonal lattice of cut and drawn
threadwork to permit a certain limited vision to the wearer. More luxurious veils
had the lattice embroidered in silver thread. Such veils could be the work of
domestic embroideresses though Mirza Husain records of a group of Isfahan
craftsmen, the sukma makers {sukma du%), that: "They are those men and women
who make the open-worked part of women's face-veils [shabika-ji rubanda].
Their number has remained the same as before."122 They stayed in business
while other crafts declined because of the extreme conservatism of this aspect of
women's dress; the face-veil was still worn in Persia until the 1930s.123
Two especially striking types of embroidery, on the evidence of surviving
pieces, were the work of professional rather than domestic craftsmen. The first
type was reserved for large items such as covers, saddlecloths, and occasionally
carpets, where a particularly luxurious effect was required. Against a back
ground fabric of velvet — usually a deep crimson red in colour — designs were
embroidered in gold and silver threads in a couched technique. Here the threads
were laid over the design area and stitched down with silks of a finer texture
which could be pulled through the velvet without causing puckering and tears.
Motifs were appropriately flamboyant — birds, flowers, medallions, deeply
curving foliage scroll, inscriptions in bold calligraphy —and formed dense
blocks of gold and silver to contrast with the rich monochrome background.
The second type is perhaps more interesting in that several techniques were
employed - mosaic patchwork supplemented by applique and embroidery. This
work seems to have been the speciality of the Caspian town of Rasht where John

Malcolm noted it in 1801.124 Murdoch Smith writing in the 1870s confirms that
it continued to be mainly produced in Rasht, although he adds that to acertain
extent it was made inIsfahan.125 Production involved an intricate and pains
taking technique of easing together all the various shaped pieces so that they
could be neatly joined into a smooth-surfaced fabric. Details were added as small
applique pieces. Finally allthe seams were concealed with embroidery, usually in
lines of silk chainstitch. Decorative themes varied from symmetrical floral
compositions, relatively simple to produce, to elaborate compositions with
flowers and birds and sometimes figure subjects. These bright attractive textiles
were popular among both Persians and Europeans and put to varied uses.
Murdoch Smith records that they were made up as saddle cloths, horse blankets,
floor covers and "now-a-days for table, sofa and chair covers where intercourse
with Europeans has introduced such articles of furniture".126 The versatility of
Rasht patchwork is epitomized in three large curtains in the Historical Museum
at Bern which are decorated each with alifesize portrait of Fath cAli Shah (pi.
60), aprince, and acourt dancing-girl obviously derived from early Qajar oil
paintings.127
One of Iran's most justifiably famous textile products was the carpet woven
in an infinite number of rich polychrome designs with knotted wool or silk cut
pile on a wool, cotton or silk foundation. Carpets had always played a necessary
role in traditional Persian life as interior furnishings and were equally valued as
important items in the export trade with Europe from the 16th century. These
two roles continued into the Qajar period with increasing emphasis on the
export trade. Foreign companies invested in factories in Persia. A proper
assessment, therefore, belongs more to the field of economic history and is in
any case too extensive and complex tobe fully discussed here.
Traditionally four main groups were distinguished — luxury products woven
in special manufacturies for court use;carpets woven in towns such as Kashan,
Kirman, Tabriz, Isfahan, Mashhad; village weaves; and finally nomadic tribal
products. During the Qajar period, while rural and tribal people continuedto
weave fortheir own requirements, certain developments occurred in both
village and town toensure the production ofan export surplus. The Tabriz
merchants, with their trade outlets through Erivan and Trabzon, dominated the
export market by the late 19th century and promoted the establishment ofnew

city workshops and village cottage industry. As a result, by 1874128 there were
150 workshops in Mashhad, 5,000 looms in the villages around Sultanabad
(Arak) and 1,000 in Kirman province. Eventually foreign investment entered
the Persian carpet trade. The Manchester-based firm of Ziegler and Co. in 1883
established their own factory at Sultanabad. By the late Qajar period a pattern
emerges of mixed enterprises in the carpet industry: town workshop, village
cottage industry and foreign-sponsored factory.
While carpet production was distributed fairly evenly throughout Persia,
certain areas were famous - Tabriz, Mashhad, Kashan, Kirman, Isfahan, Hama
dan, the comparatively new centre of Sultanabad, and the villages of Kurdistan.
Their export products concentrated on richly patterned carpets in sizes to suit
European and American interiors with designs based on combinations of floral
and medallion motifs in colours adapted to the customers' taste. It would
however, be wrong to assume that the domestic market in carpets had
declined.129
Surviving examples of carpets made for the domestic market, while seem
ingly bewildering in the range of their designs and colour-schemes, on careful
examination can be classified into a few main groups. Common to all, however,
and in harmony with the lavishness of interior decoration, is a definite taste for
elaboration of design motif. The most popular group of designs, certainly in the
early 19th century, were those based on combinations of floral motifs. These
varied from graceful and symmetrical schemes of floral palmettes on back
grounds of close-textured leaves, through repeated open flowers in a lattice to
vertical rows of fluent zigzag floral scroll (pis. 61, 62). Colour schemes were
both rich and subtle, balancing deep reds, dark blues and oranges, with lighter
tones of green, turquoise and beige. By the late 19th century, however, a more
flamboyant taste is seen in the floral designs which are paralleled by contem
porary developments in architecture and tilework. This takes the form of, for
example, exuberant beribboned floral bouquets in bright colours strewn across a
light background, and peony palmettes and foliate scroll swirled and trained
within medallions of curious curved shapes, which in turn are reserved against a
ground of contrasting colour.
While the carpet with floral designs remained a constant item of the home
market, a taste for large-scale pictorial designs began to develop (pi. 63). Themes
were derived from Persian tradition, the epic and romantic poems of Firdausi's
Shahnama and Nizaml's Khusrau and Shlrln and Laila andMa/nun, always subjects

of book illustration, lacquer and tilework decoration. But motifs were also taken
from those offoreign origin, introduced into Iran inprints, engravings and
photographs. Foreign customers generally preferred designs which combined
the exotic and unfamiliar with the ability to harmonize with their furniture and
interior decoration. The pictorial designs based on traditional themes further
adorned by inscriptions in graceful calligraphy would be more to the taste of the
cultured Persian, and European-inspired scenes might appeal toa desire for
novelty. Pictorial carpets were usually highly accomplished examples of the
weavers' technique. They had to be worked in extremely fine knotting to permit
subtleties of colour, shading and hatching, depending on the degree of realism
required. This naturally was greater in carpets whose subjects were copied from
photographs with stippling and hatching. One particular example appropriately
summarizes the interplay of Persian and European-inspired themes. It is a finely
knotted wool rug probably made in aKashan workshop. The design is domi
nated by a graceful traditional Persian flowering tree (pi. 64). An examination of
the animals which are perched on its branches, however, reveals an extraordi
nary menagerie — the lion, afavoured Persian motif, alongside such "invaders"
as the monkey, anteater, mongoose and duck-billed platypus. It would be
interesting to identify both the European zoological illustrations which inspired
this menagerie, and how its features arrived inIran.
