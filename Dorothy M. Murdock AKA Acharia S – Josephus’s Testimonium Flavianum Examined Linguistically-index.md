Abstract
The passage about Jesus Christ in Jewish historian Josephus’s writings has been debated for centuries, as concerns its authenticity totally, partially or not at all. This brief “testimonium” is proffered by Christian apologists as the “best evidence” for the historicity of Jesus, but it has been declared many times to be a forgery in toto. A recent study by a renowned linguist confirms this analysis of the entire passage as an interpolation by a Christian scribe, likely during the fourth century or later.

Introduction
Over the centuries, a passage in the works of the ancient Jewish historian Josephus (Antiquities 18.3.3/63) has been held up as one of the few “proofs” of the biblical story of Jesus Christ. During this time, numerous theologians, historians and other scholars have provided many reasons to suspect that the passage—called the Testimonium Flavianum or “TF”—is a forgery or interpolation either in part or wholly.

The historical record for TF criticism extends back to the 17th century at the latest, but there may have been skepticism in the preceding centuries that was not written down or has been lost. After that era, criticism of this passage—claimed by Christian apologists to be the most solid nonbiblical evidence of Jesus’s existence as a historical figure—was fast and furious, and by the 19th century, the TF had been dismissed as an interpolation in toto.
As Dr. Gordon Stein relates:
...the vast majority of scholars since the early 1800s have said that this quotation is not by Josephus, but rather is a later Christian insertion in his works. In other words, it is a forgery, rejected by scholars.
So commonly accepted was this analysis of the entire Testimonium as a forgery that it was dropped from the various proofs of faith proffered by churchmen for a century or so, until a pushback during the early 20th century. After that point, the TF was accepted by most mainstream scholars as genuine either entirely or partially.
The most popular view these days among critical scholars is the “partial interpolation theory,” which posits that a number of Christian-sounding phrases were inserted into the Testimonium, which is nonetheless original to Josephus. Various reconstructions have been put forth, including famously by American priest Dr. John P. Meier, who considers the following parts of the TF to be interpolations: “if indeed one should call him a man,” “He was the Christ” and “For he appeared to them on the third day, living again, just as the divine prophets had spoken of these and countless other wondrous things about him.”
Nevertheless, many scholars, historians, researchers and writers over the last century have held to the analysis that the Testimonium in toto is an interpolation into the text by a later Christian hand. For example, it has remained my contention all along that the entire TF was inserted into the surrounding passages in Josephus by a later Christian scribe, possibly Church father and historian Eusebius (263-339). Arguments against this conclusion of entire interpolation have not been satisfactory, and I maintain that this assessment is the most scientific.
Most of the reasons for questioning the TF’s authenticity can be found in my book Who Was Jesus? and articles “The Jesus Forgery: Josephus Untangled” and “Does Josephus prove a historical Jesus?” Suffice it to say that there are a dozen or so scientific and convincing arguments against authenticity.
My own study of the Josephus passage is extensive, such that I have a draft for a monograph of significant length. This study includes an analysis of the work of Dr. Alice Whealey, whose fairly recent scholarship on the subject has been held up as somewhat definitive in “proving” the partial interpolation theory, albeit her interpolation is so minimal she is more in the camp of accepting the whole TF as genuine. I found Whealey’s arguments unconvincing, obviously, since I have continued to maintain that the entire passage is a forgery, especially because of its abrupt introduction into the text—common enough with ancient manuscripts, as marginal notes crept into the text during copying by scribes—and because of its omission in the patristic writings, as well as its pious language.
As we shall see, this pious language is not simply part of the supposed Christian interpolations postulated by Meier and others but is present in the entire passage. Recent scholarship shows the

assessment of the entire TF as an interpolation to be correct, as it gives other scientific reasons to view the whole TF as a Christian profession of faith, rather than a report by a sober historian.
Narrative Anomaly
Indeed, a study published in 2014 by a renowned linguist takes us right back to the critical analyses of the past centuries which had concluded scientifically that the Testimonium as a whole is a Christian forgery. The author of this study is a professor of Humanities at Carnegie Mellon University, Dr. Paul J. Hopper, a longtime scholar who has been publishing peerreviewed articles in journals for over 40 years. He is one of the pioneers who worked on the Proto-Indo-European linguistic theory positing that Indian and European languages derive from the same remote, prehistoric root.
Hopper’s grasp of ancient Greek and the myriad subtleties and complexities of language is profound and impeccable. He has now tossed his weighty hat into the ring of Testimonium Flavianum criticism. Hopper’s linguistic analysis of the TF in his article “A Narrative Anomaly in Josephus” is definitive and adds significantly to the numerous other arguments against the passage’s authenticity evinced over the centuries.
In this regard, Hopper concludes, “It is suggested that the Jesus passage is close in style and content to the creeds that were composed two to three centuries after Josephus.” In demonstrating the evidence for his conclusion, the linguist (147) raises the specter of the socalled James Ossuary, an ancient artifact that found its way into headlines in 2002 because of a modern, forged inscription linking it to Christianity.1 Another infamous forgery of this ilk was exposed in the 15th century, Hopper notes, with the Roman imperial decree called the “Donation of Constantine,” fabricated probably in the 700’s and used over the centuries for political purposes to justify papal land grabs.
In reality, forgery and hoaxes have been rampant as concerns religious texts, artifacts and relics, in both pre-Christian and Christian times. The cautionary tale therefore is that forgery has been common enough to warrant suspicion, especially when it comes to religious claims.
The Testimonium Flavianum is another of these artifacts that has aroused suspicion for centuries. Hopper points out that the apology in favor of genuineness because the TF is in all extant copies of Josephus’s works is fallacious, since all such copies evidently are traceable to a single late manuscript. As I state in Who Was Jesus? there are no extant Greek copies of the Antiquities that predate the 9th to 11th century (depending on the source); all of these copies were made by Christians; and all of them evidently were based on a single text. This manuscript easily could have been interpolated or constitute a copy of an earlier one that had been mutilated.
The silence of Christian writers previous to Eusebius is also mentioned as a reason to doubt the TF’s authenticity, despite attempts at trying to find inference of the passage in the writings of early Church father Origen (182-254), for example.2
Another problem with the TF is in its language, which some claim seems to be in the style of Josephus but which betrays anachronisms, including the unusual use of the word “tribe” (φῦλον
1 See Murdock, “Bone Box No Proof of Jesus.” 2 See, e.g., Whealey.

phylon) to describe the Christians. It has been pointed out that Eusebius uses the same term in the same manner (e.g., 3.33.2-3, describing Christians3), whereas Josephus does not.
A study of the TF’s vocabulary suggests familiarity with not only Josephus but also with Herodotus, Plato, Strabo, Plutarch and others, reflecting a learned individual such as an educated historian like Eusebius.
Christians or Chrēstians?
Moreover, as I observed in “Does Josephus prove a historical Jesus?” the contention that the entire TF is an interpolation becomes even stronger when we look at the emergence of the word “Christians” into the historical record. In the pared-down version of the TF in the partial interpolation theory, the word “Christians” remains, the original Greek being the plural genitive Χριστιανῶν Christianon, the exact form used 33 times by Eusebius as well.
The supposed first time the word “Christians” appears is in the book of Acts (11:26), which relates that the Christians were first so-called at the Syrian city of Antioch. In fact, the word “Christians” appears nowhere else in the Bible, while “Christian” can be found only at Acts 26:28 and 1 Peter 4:16.
Whereas the conservative mainstream places the composition of the biblical book of “Acts of the
Apostles” at the end of the first century, there is no historical/literary evidence for its existence until the end of the second century, at which point the Antiochene patriarch Theophilus himself defines the word “Christian.” From the scientific evidence we currently possess, the word is apparently a late invention.
Moreover, the evidence points to the appropriate biblical term as “Chrēstians,” not “Christians.” In this regard, if we look at the Codex Sinaiticus (Acts 11:26), one of the earliest extant manuscripts of the Bible, dating to the fourth century, we can see that the original word is “Chrēstians,” with the “e” or eta (Η) erased and replaced by an “i” or iota (Ι).
Fig. 1 Codex Sinaiticus (Acts 11:26)
The same “Chrēstian to Christian” substitution has happened with the other two passages in the
NT containing the word “Christian,” i.e., Acts 26:28 and 1 Peter 4:16. These are both quite obviously late books, as 1 Peter likewise does not emerge clearly in the historical/literary record until after the middle of the second century. Appearing now and then in the extant literary record of the last couple of centuries before the common era and into the first century AD/CE, the word “Chrēstian” is a moniker related to the popular epithet Chrēstos, the “Good” or “Useful.” At one

of the earliest known churches, that of the Marcionites at Deir Ali, Syria, we find the phrase “Jesus the Chrēstos,” rather than “Jesus the Christ.”4
Fig. 2. John Bartram, 'Phrygian Chrestianity'
Again, the Testimonium uses “Christians,” but we would be very surprised if the term appeared in the original Josephus, since it seems these earlier cult followers would have been Chrēstians. One could argue that by the time of the earliest extant manuscript of Josephus, dating to the 11th century, the scribes could have “corrected” the text to be in line with the accepted “Christians,” rather than “Chrēstians.” Nevertheless, this contention would suggest Christian tampering with the TF and would confirm the early use of the term Chrēstians.
Mutilation or Partial Interpolation?
Adding significantly to the analyses of the Testimonium’s language, after discussing the sections in Josephus’s Antiquities that involve the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate into which the TF is sandwiched, Hopper (148-149) states:
My aim here is to point out some incompatibilities between the language of the Testimonium Flavianum and that of the other three episodes in the Pilate sequence that suggest they are not by the same author.
4 See Bartram, “Phrygian Chrestianity.”

The Testimonium itself is, when compared to the surrounding episodes, unusually short. Its very brevity is a suspicious feature, one that has led some defenders of its authenticity to suggest that while parts of the text are genuinely Josephan, the text has been tampered with by later Christians wanting to erase scandalous content. There have been many attempts to restore the putative original, all of them speculative. However, even the concession that there have been alterations is self-serving, since any mention of Jesus, no matter how detrimental, would preserve the basic fact of Josephus’s witness. In fact, however, the syntax of the Testimonium does not display the kinds of discontinuities we might expect to find if substantial changes such as major deletions or insertions had been made. The sentences are well formed, the use of particles such as gar and de is appropriate, the Greek constructions are correct and complete. In short, the passage is linguistically and conceptually integrated, and the assumption of an originally longer text that has been substantially shortened or of a shorter text that has been lengthened does not appear to be warranted on purely internal linguistic grounds. (Emph. added)
Here the linguist states that the syntax or arrangement of words and phrases of the TF shows no sign of either removals or insertions, the former put forth to explain the TF’s brevity and the latter as in the partial interpolation theory.
After discussing the history of TF criticism, Hopper (151) remarks:
There is, then, reason to suspect that the Jesus episode is a later insertion, dating from more than two hundred years after Josephus’s death, and probably absent from most manuscripts of the Jewish Antiquities until even later. (Emph. added)
To summarize, Hopper concludes that the Testimonium as a whole is an interpolation from the fourth century at the earliest.
Backgrounding and Foregrounding
Hopper’s scientific analysis deals largely with “linguistic (morphological and syntactic) aspects” of the Testimonium (152). In this quest, he looks at the passage’s language in terms of “backgrounding” and “foregrounding,” with regard to verbal syntax. This analysis, complicated for the lay person, involves “various tenses, modalities, infinitives and participles,” specifically the imperfect and aorist verbal systems used to describe background and foreground details in a narrative.
In explaining these “two parallel verb systems,” Hopper (152) states:
They are distributed in discourse in the manner just described: finite aorist, that is, perfective, sentences typically report an event as closed and in a sequence with other events. Imperfect, that is, imperfective, sentences describe antecedent, static situations or distributed actions that help us understand the motives and other circumstances of the aorist sentences.
What this technical language means is that within a story or report there are two general aspects: One describing an ongoing, long-standing background (“imperfect”), and the other a more recent, one-time foreground (“aorist”). Hopper gives as an example a passage from the ancient Greek historian Thucydides (2.15):



Josephus’s Testimonium Flavianum Examined Linguistically 7

At the time of Kekropia [earlier name for Athens], the Attic people dwelt in their own towns, and did not come together for council meetings, but instead each group had their own community and held their own meetings. But when Theseus became king, he caused them all to live together in a single city.
Hopper’s italicized parts constitute Greek verbs in the imperfect tense, conveying a past ongoing process or habit as the background of the story or report, while the bolded text highlights the Greek verbs in the aorist, as one-time events in the narrative’s foreground.
Hopper further says (153):
The imperfect events are multiple, diffuse and repeated. The aorist events are reported as single and completed.
In a historical report, the foreground details using the aorist tense represent the point of the chronicle, while the background employing the imperfect gives the reader more information to understand the context. In this case, the background describes what the town’s inhabitants used to do, before the king changed their circumstances, representing the one-time foreground event.
Pilate Episodes
Comprehending this type of verbal structure is crucial to understand how the Testimonium did not come from the hand of Josephus. To demonstrate this fact, Hopper analyzes Josephus’s other Pontius Pilate episodes, which precede and succeed the Testimonium, although there are two other non-Pilate passages in the same section as well, one directly following the TF evidently included as part of chronological arrangement of the historian’s works (155).
These other Pilate episodes represent straightforward recitation of facts regarding the prefect’s attempted introduction of Roman standards into the Jerusalem temple, opposed with a fury by local Jews, and the raiding of temple funds for an aquifer, also enraging pious locals.
Next comes the brief summary of Jesus, the supposed messiah:
Now, there was about this time, Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works—a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.5 (Emph. added to highlight aorist verb tense.)
5 Whiston, 379. The original Greek is: Γίνεται δὲ κατὰ τοῦτον τὸν χρόνον Ἰησοῦς σοφὸς ἀνήρ, εἴγε ἄνδρα αὐτὸν λέγειν χρή: ἦν γὰρ παραδόξων ἔργων ποιητής, διδάσκαλος ἀνθρώπων τῶν ἡδονῇ τἀληθῆ δεχομένων, καὶ πολλοὺς μὲν Ἰουδαίους, πολλοὺς δὲ καὶ τοῦ Ἑλληνικοῦ ἐπηγάγετο: ὁ χριστὸς οὗτος ἦν. καὶ αὐτὸν ἐνδείξει τῶν πρώτων ἀνδρῶν παρ ̓ ἡμῖν σταυρῷ ἐπιτετιμηκότος Πιλάτου οὐκ ἐπαύσαντο οἱ τὸ πρῶτον ἀγαπήσαντες: ἐφάνη γὰρ αὐτοῖς τρίτην ἔχων ἡμέραν πάλιν ζῶν τῶν θείων προφητῶν ταῦτά τε καὶ ἄλλα μυρία περὶ αὐτοῦ θαυμάσια εἰρηκότων. εἰς ἔτι τε νῦν τῶν Χριστιανῶν ἀπὸ τοῦδε ὠνομασμένον οὐκ ἐπέλιπε τὸ φῦλον. (Emph. added)

Finally, after the tedious Paulina tale comes the story of Pilate “destroying” many of the Samaritans, yet another account of the prefect’s bad deeds.
Concerning non-TF Pilate episodes, Hopper (157) states:
Typically, a narrative moves along in short segments consisting of a cluster of aorist and imperfect verbs and supported by explanatory states and actions presented through participles, which may be present, aorist, or imperfect, and infinitives (nonfinite verb forms), and, quite often, nominalized verb forms.
The Pilate episodes in Book 18 of the Jewish Antiquities generally adhere to these same principles....
In other words, the Pilate episodes besides the Testimonium follow the general rules of historical writing, as concerns backgrounding (imperfect) and foregrounding (aorist). Hopper demonstrates this fact using examples from the Greek text that need not be repeated here.
In explaining Pilate’s actions, Josephus uses language that contrasts them with the prefect’s predecessors, and the historian’s view of the Roman ruler’s behavior is not favorable (158): “The aorist highlights the fact that blame for the incidents that follow rests squarely on Pilate’s shoulders.”
Other linguistic elements used in Hopper’s analysis include infinitives, participles, nominalizations and the genitive absolute construction, the details of which can be found in his paper. These elements too are employed by Josephus in the non-TF Pilate episodes in a fashion consistent with historical reporting in antiquity, as well as to show non-approval of the prefect’s actions.
Piety, Not History
When it comes to the Testimonium Flavianum, the tone betrays a different impression from the other Pilate episodes. In this regard, Hopper (160) remarks:
The various narrative forms described above also appear in the Testimonium Flavianum, and the differences between their normal functions in Josephus’s account of the doings of Pontius Pilate and their apparent use in the Testimonium are worthy of comment.
Hopper next discusses the narrative forms in the TF, identifying “four finite aorists and two finite imperfects.” Two of these aorists are negative, one in the sentence “those who had loved him before did not cease” (or “did not forsake him”) and another “the tribe of Christians named after him had not ceased to exist” (or “are not extinct”) (160, 162).
After presenting his linguistic analysis, Hopper (162-163) makes a series of conclusions that bear repeating at length here:
The finite aorists report in a broad scale the past events concerning Jesus and his followers. That is, unlike the event reporting in the other Pontius Pilate episodes, we are not told in detail what Jesus did. Jesus is throughout a passive participant rather than an active agent. The aorist verbs that are used to describe Jesus reflect this passivity: epēgageto [“drew over to him”] is a mediopassive (middle voice) verb, and ephanē [“appeared”] is passive and also nonvolitional; that is, a supernatural force is at least

complicit in Jesus’s reappearance. The other two aorists concern not Jesus but his followers, and, curiously, both are in the negative: ouk epausanto and ouk epelipe. We have seen that aorist verbs typically report single prominent actions associated with the protagonist of the story. They play a crucial role in the event structure of the narrative, and while they cannot alone support the story line, they work to anchor clusters of other kinds of verbs to create episodes. This could hardly be said of the aorists in the Testimonium, however. The aorists here seem to belong in a different genre altogether, one which argues and defends rather than reports.
The use of the negative in two of the four aorists suggests something else. Negatives point implicitly to the corresponding affirmative. They belong in the contexts of denial, of response to a challenge. They suggest here that the author is contradicting unheard voices that question the truth of the chronicle. There is an element of protest in the voice of the author of the Testimonium that is impossible to attribute to Josephus, the sober historian: “There must be some truth in all this, because his followers haven’t gone away, in fact they haven’t stopped worshipping him.” (Emph. added)
The Testimonium’s syntax and morphology indicate it was written as an apology or profession of faith, rather than a historical report. The passage seems to be addressing criticisms, as if written for those who had challenged Christian doctrine at some point after the religion had been established. Its structure reflects protest, and “Methinks it doth protest too much.”
The problems with the TF, therefore, go beyond a few Christian-sounding interpolations and extend to the syntax of the sentences themselves. To wit, they are composed not in typical narrative styles, but resemble more closely the writings of early Church fathers and apologists of succeeding centuries.
Crucifixion Blame
As we have seen, Josephus’s other Pilate episodes convey dislike for an arrogant and hated ruler. In the TF, however, Pilate’s role in Jesus’s crucifixion is “brushed off in four words,” deflecting blame off the Roman and onto the “principal men” or Jewish elders. After explaining (160) that the genitive absolute construction in Greek prose typically indicates “an aside that elaborates or explains a part of the episode,” Hopper notes (163):
Whereas in the other Pilate episodes he is the chief protagonist, in the Testimonium Pilate’s role is unmistakably subordinate. He is mentioned in the genitive absolute construction...: his name is in the genitive case, and his action in sentencing Jesus is brushed off in four words, one of them a perfect participle, also in the genitive case. Whereas in the other Pilate passages Pilate is depicted as going out of his way to act with premeditation..., and as the explicit instigator of acts of repression against Jews, there is now a distinct indirectness....
So Pilate, the decisive Roman boss of the other three Pilate episodes, ruthless scourge of the Jews and despiser of their laws, now appears as the compliant puppet of the Jewish hierarchy. But the actions of the elders and Pilate are themselves secondary to the main point of the passage as identified by the aorist verbs, namely Jesus’s resurrection and the continued devotion of Jesus’s followers, which are presented as skeletal happenings for

the entire passage. Again, the grammatical structure of the Testimonium is at odds with that of the sequence of Pontius Pilate, in which the chief protagonist is Pilate himself.
Unlike in the other narratives, the Pilate of the TF is not the major character but is merely an aside. Moreover, in the other Pilate episodes Josephus portrays the Roman in an unflattering manner, blaming him for transgressions against Jews, whereas the TF seems to be apologizing on Pilate’s behalf and exculpating him from the act of crucifying Christ. Pilate is not a “Christkiller”; the Jewish elders are. In this same regard, the Gospel of John—widely held to be the latest of the canonical gospels—in particular throws the onus upon “the Jews” and labels the Jewish elders as “sons of the devil” (Jn 8:44).
Thus, the TF “reflects what had by the third century CE become a commonplace of Christianity: that culpability for the death of Jesus rested with the Jews.” (Hopper, 166-167) This viewpresent in the passage’s linguistic elements as well—represents Christian doctrine, not historical reportage. Unfortunately, this tendency to cast the blame of Christ’s death upon Jews set the stage for centuries of polemics and pogroms against them.
Hopper (167) expresses disbelief that Josephus, who previously recounted Pilate’s acts with disdain, would absolve the Roman of blame for Jesus’s death:
The Josephus of the Testimonium is represented as aligning himself with the Christians (versus the Jews) and admitting that the blame for the crucifixion of Jesus the Messiah lies with the Jews; it need hardly be said that such an admission on Josephus’s part is inconceivable.
One cannot envision the Jewish general Josephus being of this mindset, but such is the tenor of the Testimonium, once again belying its supposed origin with the historian.
Time and Temporality
In a discussion of time and temporality or the relationship with time, Hopper (164) remarks:
The time organization in the Testimonium is strikingly different from that of the surrounding text....
He differentiates between the “kairotic” time of the other Pilate episodes, “that is, it is qualitative time (kairos) experienced by individual actors,” and “chronic” time of the TF, “that is, it is part of the general temporality of human history.”
He then concludes:
...the Testimonium belongs to a different kind of time from the rest of the Jewish
Antiquities. The temporality of the Testimonium derives from its presumed familiarity to its audience, which in turn is more compatible with a third century or later Christian setting than a first century Roman one. (Emph. added)
Thus, the language of the entire TF itself reveals a particular time and temporality, different from the book into which it has been placed.

Emplotment and Gospels
Hopper also looks at the TF in terms of “emplotment,” defined elsewhere as an “assembly of a series of historical events into a narrative with a plot,”6 or the structure of a plot with a beginning, interaction and ending. He (165) notes that the other Pilate episodes follow this basic plot structure, whereas the TF does not:
The Testimonium has no such plot. From the point of view of its place in Josephus’s Jewish Antiquities, it does not qualify as a narrative at all. The Testimonium could not be understood as a story except by someone who could already place it in its “intelligible whole”, the context of early Christianity. The Testimonium gains its intelligibility not
through its reporting of novel events but by virtue of being a “repetition of the familiar”...—familiarity here meaning familiarity to a third century Christian readership, not to a first century Roman one.
The TF as a whole represents a summary of the gospel story, as recounted in the New Testament, not drawn from separate historical reports or oral history.
As Hopper remarks:
...it is from the Gospels, and the Gospels alone, that the Jesus Christ narrative in the Testimonium draws its coherence and its legitimacy as a plot, and perhaps even some of its language. It is not just that the Christian origin of the Testimonium is betrayed by its allegiance to the Gospels, as that without the Gospels the passage is incomprehensible. Once again to draw on Paul Ricoeur, the Testimonium does not so much narrate to first century Romans new events, but rather reminds third century Christians of events already familiar to them.
Adding to this notion is Dr. Gary J. Goldberg’s examination of language similarities between the
Gospel of Luke and Josephus. In “The Coincidences of the Emmaus Narrative of Luke and the Testimonium of Josephus,” Goldberg shows a high probability of dependence of one text upon the other, which we would aver was that of the TF on Luke. There are those who believe Luke was used by Josephus; however, there exists no scientific evidence for the clear emergence of Luke until after the middle of the second century.7 Hence, whoever composed the TF would need to have written after that time, decades following Josephus’s death.
Also, the root of the word ἐφάνη ephane (“appeared”), φαίνω phaino (Strong’s G5316)meaning “to bring forth into the light, cause to shine, shed light” and “to appear”—is used in
some form most often in the Gospel of Matthew, indicating that text’s possible influence on the TF as well.

Genre Difference
The evident Christian context of the TF speaks also to genre or category of subject matter, likewise examined by Hopper (165-166), who states:
A genre...is ultimately rooted in the practices of the discourse community that creates and uses it. The Testimonium is anchored in a radically different discourse community from that of the rest of the Jewish Antiquities. The Testimonium reads more like a position paper, a party manifesto, than a narrative.... Its novelty for its intended readers lies not in the historical narrative itself but in its political insertion into the context of Josephus’ bitter account of the procuratorship of Pontius Pilate, and its affirmation to the Christian world that contemporary pagan historians had after all taken note of the earthly life of Jesus Christ. It is, in other words, a political interpolation. It serves to validate the Christian claim of the crucifixion of the sect’s founder during Pilate’s administration, and, by positioning its text within that of the genre “history”, with its ethos of truth, to warrant the historical authenticity of the Gospels. But told as a series of new events to a first century Roman audience unfamiliar with it, the Testimonium would have been a bizarre addition and probably quite unintelligible. (Emph. added)
Again, the Testimonium Flavianum as a whole sounds like a Christian “political statement,” creed or profession of faith, precisely as so many have averred in the past.
Nicene Creed
Hopper (166) next says that the “closest generic match for the Testimonium is perhaps the various creeds that began to be formulated in the early fourth century, such as the Nicene Creed (325 CE).”
He continues:
Some credal elements are clearly present: Jesus was the Messiah; he was crucified under Pontius Pilate (passus sub Pontio Pilato, in the words of the Apostles’ Creed); he came back to life on the third day after his death; the movement founded by him—the Christian church—continues to flourish; he performed miracles; the biblical prophets foretold many details of his life.
In this regard, Hopper compares the length of the TF (77 Greek words) with the Apostles’ Creed in Latin (76 words) and the Greek Apostles’ Creed (91 words).
While the earlier Nicene Creed (325) does not mention Pilate, the amended Creed of Constantinople (381) does, in a section that sounds like the TF: “...he was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried, and the third day he rose again according to the scriptures...”8
8 ...σταυρωθέντα τε ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἐπὶ Ποντίου Πιλάτου, καὶ παθόντα, καὶ ταφέντα, καὶ ἀναστάντα τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ κατὰ τὰς γραφὰς... Cf. the Testimonium: ...παρ ̓ ἡμῖν σταυρῷ ἐπιτετιμηκότος Πιλάτου...ἐφάνη γὰρ αὐτοῖς τρίτην ἔχων ἡμέραν πάλιν ζῶν τῶν θείων προφητῶν...

© D.M. Murdock and StellarHousePublishing.com
The suggestion of an early fourth-century composition for the TF might implicate again the most famous Christian authority of the time, Eusebius, as its composer and interpolator who was also one of the creators of the Nicene Creed.9 Eusebius is the first to mention the Testimonium, and he was in a position of power to make sure his copy of Antiquities with it would be the one used to manufacture others. As a major Church figure and servant of Constantine and Rome, Eusebius
had vast resources behind him to make this alteration happen, possibly more so than anyone else of the time.
Conclusion
Hopper’s linguistic analysis is yet another nail in the Testimonium coffin and should convince fence-sitters, although Christian apologists likely will never relinquish this “best evidence” because without it their claims to historicity are threadbare indeed.
In conclusion, Hopper states:
The narrative grammar of the Testimonium Flavianum sets it sharply apart from Josephus’s other stories of the procuratorship of Pontius Pilate. The most likely explanation is that the entire passage is interpolated, presumably by Christians embarrassed at Josephus’s manifest ignorance of the life and death of Jesus. The Jewish Antiquities would in this respect be consistent with the other chronicler of this age, Josephus’s contemporary and rival historian, Justus of Tiberias, who wrote a history of this period that conflicted with Josephus and claimed Josephus’s version to be selfserving. Justus’s work has not survived, but we know from other sources that he wrote in great detail about the exact period of Tiberius’s reign that coincided with Jesus’s ministry—and that he did not mention Jesus. Outside the Gospels, there is no independent contemporary (i.e., first century CE) account of these events. The silence of other commentators, and the absence of any mention of the Testimonium by Christian writers for two full centuries after Josephus, even when engaged in fierce polemic about Jesus, are strong indications that the passage was not present in Josephus’s own extraordinarily detailed account of this period. (Emph. added)
In the end, it can be argued convincingly that the Testimonium Flavianum as a whole is a forgery and therefore does not provide evidence for a historical Jesus of Nazareth crucified during the reign of Pontius Pilate.10
