TWO primordial genes discovered: one Semitic and the other – Hungarian
Monographs by Dr. László Árkay
No.5
Research of Professor W. Penfield commissioned by the Rockefeller
Foundation
A few years ago (ca. 1960’s) Professor Wildred Penfield, an
eminent scholar at McGill University, [Actually the correct name
is Wilder Penfield. See link below./Turul] received a research
assignment from the Rockefeller Foundation, to determine if
there was a primordial human gene on Earth, and if there was one
to identify it. He had received an enormous financial grant
amounting to millions of dollars. The covert, but real objective of
the research assignment was to find the Semitic gene as such a
superior entity.
A large research team was employed on the task. After several
years of work they indeed found the sought after gene. However,
they found not only one, but TWO. It was determined of these two
that they may be temporarily suppressed through generations and
even centuries, but afterward they break out again, while German
and Negro, for instance, atrophy and disappear. These two genes



break out again after centuries and they clash with each other.
Temporarily, one gene may suppress the other, they can even
combine, but after several generations one surfaces and becomes
the exclusively dominant gene. Thus, the Penfield research team
indeed found the hoped-for Semitic gene, but also found another
such primordial gene which had no name.
Of this second gene, Professor Penfield reported that, its
purest representative is found in the Hungarian people of
Central Europe and he added in his final report that this very
same gene can be found also on five scattered points of the
globe. The consequence of this finding - which ruined the hoped
for expectations of the pro-Semitic Rockefeller Foundation - was
the immediate cancellation of the funding, and, banning the
publication of the report. The research team, of course, was
disbanded. The report did not see the light of day.
“At one point I had the final report in my hands. The five spots
identified by the experts are exactly identical with the five spots on
the globe where the pentatonic Hungarian folk music can be
found. “ added Dr. Árkay. “But the best of it is to come!
“I had an extraordinary telephone conversation two or three years
ago with my dear friend, professor Tibor Baráth. He said that he
was not a musician and does not know anything about folk music.
He had a world atlas on which he marked every finding in
recorded history where any ancient, Hungarian or other writings
were found and deciphered. But he admitted, that he was at a loss
because these five spots were scattered all over the globe.”
“I pricked my ears” says Dr Árkay. “Which are these five spots?” I
asked. “Well, 1. Hungary and Central Asia Ural Region but not



the Slavic areas, 2 the Far-East, in China and Japan, 3. Central
Africa, 4. the Indian regions in America and 5. Scotland”. I was
stunned and ready to sit down. For, these spots were exactly
identical with the five large spots where pentatonic music and
the genetic spots identified by the Penfield research team were
found.
This evidence then brought to a common denominator the results
of investigations that began in three different and disparate
scientific disciplines, research of folk music, archeology of great
antiquity and genetic research.

THE ESTABLISHMENT AND GOALS OF THE INSTITUTE OF
HUNGARIAN STUDIES
Today it is an open secret that the Western Press has accepted the
Hungarian sources which purposefully distort Hungarian History
and silence research in the field of Hungarian linguistics. Based on
this information, the West makes a judgment about Hungarian
culture from the past to the present day. The silencing and
distortion of the Hungarian culture is not a new development. On
November 6, 1858, Count István Széchényi, who was the founder
of the Hungarian Academy of Science, in theory, withdrew his
support of the Academy because, at that time, the Academy
supported the Hapsburg politics, which caused enormous damage



to the nation and the national identity.
Since that time, the stance of the Hungarian government and the
Hungarian Academy of Science has not changed. Therefore, many
emigrant Hungarians have become linguists and historians, in
order to present a true picture of Hungarian culture and language,
hoping to change the distorted opinion of the West. In spite of
enormous difficulties, the Hungarian Press in the West has
supported this cause. It should be noted that, for many years, the
Hungarian Government has not supported national interests, either
during the Hapsburg era or after World War II., not even since the
fall of Communism in 1990. The Hungarian Academy of Science
has not changed its position either. Hungarian researchers who are
members of the Hungarian Academy of Science cannot openly
present their research because of the hostile and stifling
atmosphere of the Academy. Even if, on a rare occasion, they do
publish their work, it is never accepted into the school books and
can never become public knowledge among the Hungarian people.
The silenced and distorted history is the grave of the Hungarian
identity. Without its identity, the nation loses the desire to live
which is the cause of the population decline. This is why it is
necessary that the role of the Hungarian Academy of Science be
taken over by an independent organization which is truly
Hungarian and scientific.
