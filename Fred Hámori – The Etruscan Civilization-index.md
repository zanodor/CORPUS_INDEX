The Etruscan Civilization
Fred Hamori
Introduction
The Etruscans and their civilization have long disappeared from Europe, but their legacy
lives on in many ways, even though their many contributions are often unrecognized for
their proper origin. Why were they important, when we hear so little about them in our
history books? Long before Rome was founded and grew into a major power, Etruscans
ruled a large portion of Italy and the surrounding seas and were one of the 3 major naval
powers of the Mediterranean Sea. They were famous for their architectural innovations,
metal works and technology, as well as their fine artistic skills. The Etruscans have also
given us many cultural terms, which we still use today, that are often thought to be from
Latin. Their descendants are part and parcel of the people of Italy along with several
others, like the Latins, who gave Italians and many others their language. Among the
most important contributions to Rome, besides the construction of the city, are many
Roman customs, the alphabet, symbols and customs of monarchy that came from the
Etruscans. As a language and a culture, they were unique in Europe, because, unlike
much of Europe in Roman and modern times, they were not speakers of Indo-European
languages and their customs were also different.
The Etruscans' name
Various old languages have called Etruscans by different names. The Romans called
them Tursci or Etrusci. In Attic Greek they were called Tyrrhenians. The related name
Teresh was used by the Egyptians, who also knew them as "Sea People", who attacked
Egypt. That was the ancient source of "turas or tursa" that became Etruscan. In 1214BC
they attacked Egypt in alliance with several other related tribes. The researchers of
Etruscan believe that, because of the context of its use, "thuras" was some sort of a plural
suffix indicating membership in a collective group and/or family, speaking a language
that may have ties to the ancient Hurrian language of the Near East, where "tarsua"
referred to "fellow men" (i.e. compatriot, countrymen). Similarly, in Hungarian, "társa
ság" represents the collective, the society, while "törzs" means a tribe, similar to Etruscan
"tursa" that later became Tu(r)sci, Tusci or Etrusci.
According to the Dutch historian R. S. P Beekes, in his article "The Origin of the
Etruscans", the Etruscans called their own people "Meχ-lum", while their land or territory
was called "Ras-na". Professor Mario Alinei believes that the suffix "-lum" is a collective
concept like the English suffix "-ness or -ship", or a Hungarian suffix "-lom". They
organized into 12 city alliances to form a league, which could be considered to be a
country or a mini-empire. In Etruscan they called these leagues a "Mech". In Hungarian
a province is also called a "Megye". (*ch>gy~dy is common) According to Prof. Alinei,
Meχ is also a valid native name of the Etruscan people and, according to him, that name
is related to Megy-er, the old royal tribe of the Hungarians, which much later became the
collective native designation Magyar, used nowadays for all Hungarians. Beekes writes



2
that this name is probably related to other similar ethnic names, such as the Anatolian
Mis-ians who were neighbors and allies of the Trojans.
Pre-Etruscan Origins and Genetic types
DNA analysis of Etruscan remains has revealed their links to northern Anatolia, where
Troy was located. The latest genetic finds in a few isolated towns in Tuscany have shown
closer genetic ties to ancient Anatolia among the living population, unlike what is
common in the rest of Italy. That points to their earlier home, before their coming to Italy.
The latest mitochondrial DNA study in 2013 indicates that the Etruscan women were
linked to the Neolithic population of Central Europe, the Carpathian Basin, where today
the majority of the population are ethnic Hungarians. These types in today's Italy are
uncommon. The archeologist Hugh Hencken writes that, during the Bronze Age, this area
of Central Europe was the most technically advanced, causing an explosion of
population. Many of that population migrated eastward in search of lands with rich
mineral resources, while fewer also went toward west European regions, under various
tribal names. They also crossed into Anatolia and what became Greek territories much
later. Around 1200BC, due to famine in their homeland, from northern Anatolia they
moved to northern Italy. In Italy, they were the people associated with the old and new
Villanovan Culture.
There is a tendency today to think that, before the arrival of the Etruscans, Europe and
Italy could only have been populated by proto-Indo-European speaking people. This is
based on the information from a period in history after the Etruscans, Romans and Greeks
learned to write, allowing us to evaluate the languages of the region. Etruscans were
indeed different from all the other people of Italy. Even Prof. Alinei claims that the
protoform of the Etruscan language came from the Carpathian Basin, with origins from
the horse-riding Kurgan people, who invaded from the east in the 4th millennium BC.
However, there were perhaps other non-Indo-European language types in Europe even
before then, which are scantily documented. The German periodical “Gegenbaurs
Morphol Jahrb." from 1988; 134(1):53-7, penned by S. Hummel, includes an interesting
statement about the Etruscan language and its type in the early Europe.
"The suffixes of the nominal declension in the Old Canary and Etruscan languages are
very similar to the corresponding elements of the Sumerian and Ural-Altaic tongues.
Also, many words of funeral and generally cultic provenance are derived from common
roots in these languages. So, one may assume that the Indo-European tongues of (West)
Europe overlaid a common substratum of Ural-Altaic type (agglutinative type?), which
was still alive in the time of the Megalithicum.”
The Finnish linguist Kalevi Wiik (1932-2015), has suggested a controversial theory and
he also created an atlas of ancient Europe, which displays a chronological displacement
and withdrawal from Central Europe of the western Finno-Ugor people over time and an
expansion of the Indo-European languages in their place. The FU hunters were displaced
by agriculturalists from Anatolia who mixed with the locals, and that also influenced
many of their languages. These new languages are often ascribed to solely Indo



3
European, even though it's not at all certain that they were only Indo-European, nor is it
certain that all older languages were replaced. In fact, in grammar, phonetics, and
vocabulary Sumerian is closer to the Etruscan, Finno-Ugor and Altaic languages than to
Indo-European. The explanation for this could be that proto-Sumerians were not
indigenous to Southern Mesopotamia but came there from the north. Perhaps they came
from Anatolia just like the farmers that influenced Central Europe. Their legend of the
"great flood" and its details certainly implies this, since some researchers claimed that
the flooding of the Black Sea was the Sumerian flood.
Etruscan cities
Etruscan cities were typically strongly fortified, walled cities, built upon difficult to
access peaks for protection. Some have survived to our time, with minor changes to their
original names. Like other Etruscan cities, these normally had a sewer system and water
distribution that collected water in the mountains and brought it to their cities through
aqueducts. Many consider Rome to be originally an Etruscan city, because it has all of
the typical characteristics of an Etruscan city, and also because it was surrounded by
much older Etruscan settlements. Several of Rome's early kings (or governors) were
known to be Etruscans, as well as the names of the customs and regalia of its early rulers.
It only seems obvious then, that with such a close symbiotic connection, Rome itself was
probably Etruscan, just like its surroundings. The traditional legendary founders of
Rome, the heroes Romulus and Remus, as well as the legend type and their names are
not Latin, nor are they similar to other Indo-European languages or legends but are very
similar to Hungarian and Turkic traditional legends.
The Etruscans founded many cities on the Italian peninsula; some of the major ones are
shown on the map below.



4
It has been proposed by the Italian Mario Alinei that some of these city names are quite
understandable even today in modern Hungarian. He listed the translation of the
following cities: Felsi-na (upper place), Hu: felsö; Alsi-na (lower place) Hu: alsó; Vels
na (central/inner) Hu: belsö. The suffix "-na" is a locative suffix, added to names to
indicate them to be a place, such as a city or town, or just a specific location.
Etruscan Leagues and Government
The Etruscans never united as a single nation, but typically formed alliances in groups of
12, between their neighboring major cities. These leagues had a rotating ruler, possibly
called a "Zilat". Their political system was a theocracy. At the height of Etruscan power



5
in Italy, there were three competing Etruscan leagues. The later Romans adopted many
of the Etruscan symbols of kingship such as the golden crown, the scepter, the "toga
palmata", the "sella curul-is" (throne) and the symbol of the state, the "fasces". Even the
term "curia" meaning the court, assembly, governing council, was derived from Etruscan
and is still used today by the Catholic Church. These are associated with Turkic
"kurultai", which was the gathering of tribes; the Hungarian kurul>király later became
the name for the king, from the leader of all the tribes. Some believe that even Kurulus
Magnus, who is better known to the English speakers as Charlemagne, derived the name
from the same Hunnic source, since in early Hunnic tribes the title of a prince was "kur,
kir, chur" while "aul" meant a tribe or clan. Attila previously was the first king of most
of the Germanic people.
sella (Latin for chair)+kur-ul
(ruler?)
Hungarian & Assyrian kurul > király is king
curia in Hungarian and Türkic ser- is a sacred
conclave of leaders of the tribes
Latin fasces from Etruscan fashe Hungarian "feyse", Sumerian "paše" is an
ax
toga is the shroud/clothing worn Hungarian "tak-ar" to cover, "tak
ách"weaver
Türkic generic "ton/toŋ" dress, clothing
Besides the "king", if we can truly call him that, there were several other leading offices
of state referred to today with the Latin term "magistrate". These had different functions,
which are not understood for certain. However, Prof. Alinei claims to have broken the
code and now has defined them. In the following, the Etruscan letter C is pronounced as
a "K” while Z is unvoiced and most likely pronounced as a "TS" that first became CH
and later a "GY", pronounced somewhat like "dy" in Hungarian.
Zila z>ch Hungarian, Hun, Turkic: Jula/Gyula ruler. (ch & j to gy
change is very frequent in Hungarian)
Maru-tu Hungarian: Mérö associated with surveying, measuring,
engineering
Cante Hungarian & Tatar: Kende, Kündü sacral priest or ruler? in
old Hungarian
Lau-χumu usually translated as a "king" Alinei claims: Lau=horse +
kume=man or knight
I myself don't particularly like the explanation "horse-man” or knight to be the source
of a "king or ruler", especially since the Etruscan word for horse is usually "tamna"
rather than "lau", but it could mean "lead man", leader as in "*ala + *kume” found in
Ugrian and in Turkic. Cante may also be tied to Türkic Kengu “king”, and shows up on
the Late Antique Central Asian coins in Türkic runiform script, like on Athrikh
(Afrosiab, 305-? AD) coin: . It is from the Türkic root kön - “sun”, not the
Türkic kun/kün ~ English kin, as suggested by IE philologists, and with the Türkic
suffix -gu it makes kengu “of the sun”, “descended from sun”.

Origins and History of the Etruscans and Pelasgians
Because the Etruscans had such a key role in the development of the early Roman
civilization, and were later absorbed into the Roman society, in the past their alien origin
has not been favored. For a very long time they were seen as mysterious indigenous
people, whose written language and unique culture was unknown and unlike any other
Europeans. Some classical writers, such as the Greek Dionysus of Halicarnassus (60 BC
– after 7 BC), argued that the Etruscans were the original people of the Italian peninsula,
a theory that was contradicted by most others of his time.
Early Greek historians of the 5th century associated the Etruscans, whom they called
Tyrrhenians, with the pre-Greek Pelasgian population of early Greece and North West
Anatolia. Most of the Greeks claim that the island of Lemnos was also Pelasgian, and
Thucydides (ca 460 – ca 400 BC) relates them to the Etruscans. Dionysius of
Halicarnassus wrote about the Pelasgian migration from Thessaly in Greece to the Italian
Peninsula, where they made themselves masters of some of the Umbrian lands. The
Etruscans that were called Tyrrhenians were also mentioned by Herodotus (ca 484–ca
425 BC) to have migrated from Lydia in Anatolia to the land of the Umbri. He called
their leader Tyrhenos. According to Strabo, the Pelasgians of Lemnos and Imbros
followed Tyrrhenus to the Italian Peninsula. Many believe that these groups were just
branches of linguistically related people. The Lemnos stele proves that it was indeed
inhabited by Etruscan-like people, as well as the Anatolian Kumdanli inscription, near
lake Askania, known today as Lake Burdur, which called them Tyrhaneans. The name
Pelasgi, according to some, means "sea-man", but using Etruscan it can mean "destroyer,
bad" based on the word "pelias". Combining the concepts, it could become a pirate, which
was often what the Greeks called the Etruscans or Pelasgians. This is just my proposed
guess to the elusive meaning of the name.
The Bible is fairly accurate, when it lists the Etruscans as one of the seven sons of
Japheth, in the company of Gomer (Cimmerians), Madai (Medes), Javan (Ionians),
Tubal (Tiberian), Meshech (Moschian), Tiras (Tyrhanean), Magog (who is also called
the prince of Meshech & Tubal? and he is an ancestor of the of Eastern European
Scythians). According to Herodotus, the Ionians of Greece were also Pelasgians.
Europeans recently have claimed that these are ancestors of the Indo-Europeans from a
time before Indo-European became a widespread language family, but there is no
credible proof of that. The Moschians were iron-working Tiberians of the southeastern
portion of the Black Sea (R. Graves: Sumerian tibir “smith”). The Etruscans were
certainly not Indo-European, and neither were their kin, like the Pelasgians, Ionians, and
Misians. The Medes claimed to descend from the Mother Goddess Medea (R. Graves).
There is no evidence that relates them to the Iranians except for their historical
association. All of these "nations" were racially Caucasian, but not Indo-European in
language. Meshech, Tiras and Ionians therefore were related to the Etruscans. There is
no evidence that even one of these peoples was originally Indo-European-speaking, but
they are shown to be interrelated. For instance, take the Scythians.
According to Prof. Alinei's proposed theory, the Scythians and "Kurgan" people, who
invaded central Europe in the 5th, 4th and 3rd millennia BC, no longer should be viewed
as Indo-European at all, (see kurgan-hypothesis) but predecessors of an early proto



7
Hungarian (Ugrian) group and other western Turkic (Ogur) type linguistic groups. They
were the first who domesticated the horse in Turkestan, according to the most recent
archeology, and they have given much of the horse terminology to the Europeans.
Besides the horse, there are many Turkisms in some of the Indo-European languages, not
generally acknowledged or known. Therefore, the Kurgan people could not have been
Indo-Europeans (IE) as was previously claimed, since there are no common terms for
horses among the Indo-European languages. In the Kurgan culture however, the horse
played a leading role as an economic base, a food and drink source, and as a form of
transportation.
The Etruscans probably were not present on the Italian peninsula until the start of the early
Villanovan Culture, which included their many technical innovations including the
introduction of the horse. According to archeologists, like Hugh Hencken, President of the
Archeological Institute of America from 1952 to 1955, they came from an area of the
Carpathian Basin (old Hungary), where similar archeological artifacts were found.
Lawrence Barfield (1935-2009) called this area of Europe the "heartland of technology at
the end of the Bronze Age". Hugh Hencken has claimed their origin was from the area of
Hungary, due to the similar type of Urn burial customs and metallurgy which originated
from there (see Chernykh E. "Steppe Metallurgy"), and the bronze and iron working
technology they brought from there, as well as their equestrian customs. Hugh Hencken
[1968, 612, 614] also claimed that originally the Tyrrsenoi came from the north and some
settled on the Lydian coast before the Lydians came to Anatolia (Turkey) and then fled
several hundred years later to Italy, because of a long-lasting famine in their homeland.
He also believes that the Etruscans were part of the people who attacked Egypt under the
confederation known by the Egyptians as the “Sea People”. They were probably driven by
a need to find a new home, when they turned to piracy to survive. The Etruscans were
named by the Egyptians by their actual later known name, as “T(w)r(w)s" [Mernpetah,
1214BC].
According to the Victory Stele found near Thebes, Egypt, the Sea Peoples also destroyed
the Hittite kingdom, and consisted of the following peoples or tribes:
1. Shardana "Sardinians?” However references claim that Shar means 10 in Etruscan
and the Danoi of Greece were a branch of the Pelasgians. Sardes was also a place name
in Anatolia near the old homeland of the early Etruscans. The Sardinian language of
today is not related to Etruscan, so that they could not have been Etruscan, unless their
language and/or people were replaced, while leaving the old name of the island.
2. Lukka "Lycians", were a mixture with Etruscan, since the Greeks believed they were
related to them. It was a mixed language, which was less than 20% Indo-European with
a large substrate of local native origin. It shares some vocabulary with Etruscan.
3. Meshwesh “Mis-ians" who, according to Beekes, are the ancient Anatolian
Etruscans. The Bible knows them as "Mesh-ech", who were allies of the Trojans.
4. Teresh "Tyrhaneans", who are also Etruscans found in Anatolia, Greece, Italy
(Tuscany) and Spain (Tarsus and Tartessus). They are known as "Tiras" in the Bible.



8
5. Ekwesh "Acheans" were early Greeks mentioned by Herodotus.
6. Shekelesh "Siculs", who were also in southern Italy, but came there from Phrygia in
Asia Minor, and were known as the "shakalasha". The Hungarian Székelys' use of the
Siculs’ name maybe coincidental, however their sacred mountain in Transylvania is
called Hargita, which is like a place name Gargitha in Anatolia, in the early Etruscan
territory.
That early time was a period of diaspora for the early Etruscans tribes, who settled in
several regions in Europe and the Near East. In France, the city of Paris is supposedly
derived from them as well as the British legend of Brutus, who was claimed to be the
first king of Britain, who led his people from Troy, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth
(c. 1095 – c. 1155). Some of the Celtic tribes were neighbors of the Etruscans in Italy,
and they conquered some of the Etruscan territory. Perhaps the Celts had also absorbed
some Etruscan traditions and people, and then spread the legends as their descendants
moved west. The presence of the Celts in Anatolia as the Galatians of the Bible is a
known fact, but it may also have some ties to the Etruscans.
The Dutch Beekes claims the presence of Etruscans in northern Italy from before
1200BC. According to one classical historian Varro (116BC - 27BC), the Italic Etruscan
state was first founded in 1044BC, however, even in that case they had to be around on
the Italian peninsula as independent tribes hundreds of years earlier. The Etruscans were
associated with the so called early and later Villanovan Culture in Italy (12th century
BC onwards), which derived from the Urnfield Culture (13th century BC to 750 BC)
starting from Central Europe, in the Carpathian Basin.
Early Greek historians described the Pelasgians of early Greece as related to the
Etruscans. The Pelasgians founded many of the major cities in early Greece. Thucydides
(ca 460 – ca 400 BC) mentions the Pelasgian settlements beneath the Acropolis in Athens
and claims that Greece was of recent date and was preceded by the Pelasgians. Homer
(late 8th or early 7th century BC) wrote that there were also Pelasgian settlements in Asia
Minor. Herodotus (ca 484–c. 425 BC) mentions that Hellas (Greece) was formerly known
as Pelasgia. Along with several other areas of Greece, the famous "Greek" oracle of
Dodona was also known to be the residence of Pelasgians. Some place names in Greece
also have non-Greek origins that were often Pelasgian or Etruscan. For example:
spur =city in Etruscan city of Sparta/Greece
Corithos in Etruscan Corinthos /Greece
Curtun in Etruscan Gurton/Greece
tepa =hill in Etruscan Thebes/Greece
The Etruscan link with the Pelasgians therefore is quite likely. A systemic collection and
analysis of the non-Indo-European words in the Greek language, which could shine more
understanding on its early history, to my knowledge has not been assembled and
researched. What is acknowledged is miniscule, whereas the language does have a large
number of loanwords from a variety of sources. These loans into Greek are routinely
incorrectly cited as being Greek in origin. Usually, a comparison of Etruscan to non



9
Indo-European languages is quite rare, even though Etruscan is acknowledged to be non
Indo-European.
Historic Timeline
• 3000 BC. Kurgan invasions from the edge of Eastern Europe
• 2000 BC. at the end of the Bronze Age the ancestors of the old Urnfield culture in
Central Europe reached from the Carpathian Basin the eastern shores of the
Mediterranean Sea, and some crossed over to Anatolia. According to American
archeologist Hugh Hencken, their culture was related to that found in the
Carpathian basin: Urn burial, bronze working, and various animal types like the
Central European horse and horse-riding. Alinei believes that they were one of the
later descendants of the so called "Kurgan culture" that invaded Central Europe



10
from the east, where they are tied to the Pit Grave culture near the Ural
Mountains, who in his opinion spoke Hungarian and Turkic vernaculars.
• 1600 BC. The Pelasgian relatives of the Etruscans inhabited Greece prior to the
Greek invasion from the north. A few claim that by then Etruria had already
existed in the northern Italy. According to the archeologist Hugh Hencken, there
were two separate Etruscan-Villanovan invasions by sea into Italy, one on the
Adriatic Sea side, and the other on the Tyrrhenian Sea side of the Italian
peninsula.
• 12th or 13th century BC. Estimated time of the Trojan War between the Achean
Greeks and/or their Phrygian cousins against the native nation of the Trojans,
probably fought for unhindered control over profitable trade routes to the Black
Sea, guarded by Troy and their European kin. The other mythical explanation
about the abduction of Helen of Troy seems hardly more than a romanticized
excuse fit for legends. The allies of Troy included the Misians, who were related
to the Etruscans.
• 1214 BC. The Egyptian Mernpetah lists names of the Sea People alliance
members that attacked Palestine and Egypt. This alliance included Etruscans,
Pelasgians and Misians; they are named on a Victory Stella near Thebes, Egypt.
• 1200 BC. A major famine in the Hittite Empire. Herodotus states that a great
famine was a cause for the Tyrsenoi migration from Lydia. According to Beekes,
the Hittites were defeated by the Etruscans. The Assyrians called the conquerors
of the Hittites "muski", which gives credence to the theory that they were
Etruscan-Misians.
• 1180 BC. The Etruscan-Pelasgians-Misian alliance, called Sea People overran
Palestine and was only beaten back with difficulty by Ramses III of Egypt, the
first pharaoh of the 12th dynasty. Many of the "Sea People" settled in Palestine
and ruled over it. The Pelasgians gave their name to the Palestine area.
• c.1000BC. The first use of iron in Italy was found in Etruscan territory.
• 9th century BC. Founding of the city Tarquinia, named after Tarquin, the son of
the legendary Tyrrhenus who led Etruscans to Italy, but whose name is also found
in Greece and Anatolia. In Tarquinia, Italy, appeared a boy Tages with serpent
like legs; he taught Etruscans divination and reading a will of the deities along
with their many sacred tenets.
• 753 BC. The supposed foundation of Rome, whose first king was Romulus. Rome
had at least two early monarchs of Etruscan origin, Tarquinius Priscus and Lucius
Tarquinius Superbus. Even the first monarch of Rome, known as the legendary
Romulus is also unlikely to have been Latin.
• 750 - 600 BC. Greek colonies in Italy strongly influence the urbanized Etruscans.
• c. 700 BC - c. 500 BC. The Etruscan city of Acquarossa flourishes. Earliest
written traces of the Etruscan language written using Phoenician and early Greek
alphabets.
• 616 BC. Tarquinius Priscus was one of the Etruscan "kings" or rulers of early
Rome.



11
• 539 BC. An Etruscan and Carthaginian alliance expels Greeks from Corsica.
• c. 508 BC. Lars Porsenna, the Etruscan king of Chiusi, laid siege to Rome and
contributed to the end of the Roman elected monarchy that later became a
republic, where all leaders held elective positions, and all periods were ruled by
the conclave (senate) of the aristocracy, at best presided by an elected leader. That
was a Turkic and Hungarian tradition, where Kengu, Chanyu, Khan, Kagan
“king” was elected for life as a head of a confederation or tribal union.
• c. 500 BC. Etruscan Acquarossa is destroyed and definitively abandoned. It is
presumed to have been absorbed by a larger Etruscan city-state.
• 474 BC. Etruscan fleet was defeated by the Syracuse (Italian Greeks) navy,
whose tyrant was Hiero, at the battle of Cumae.
• c. 470 BC. An Etruscan tomb of the Dead Man is constructed at Tarquinia.
• 437 BC - 435 BC. Rome defeats Etruscan Veii in the Veientine war; the Etruscan
king Lars Tolumnius is killed.
• 396 BC. Rome sacks the Etruscan town of Veii after a ten-year siege. The Celts
use this to their advantage by defeating an Etruscan army at the battle of Melpum.
Afterwards the Celts settle all over the Po Valley.
• 394 BC. Etruscan Volsinii and their ally Sappinum unsuccessfully attacked
Rome.
• 391 BC. Senones besieges the Etruscan city of Clusium.
• 384 BC. Syracuse attacks the ports of the Etruscan city of Cerveteri.
• 356 - 307 BC. Roman prisoners are sacrificed in the forum of the Etruscan city of
Tarquinia.
• ca 350 BC. Paintings of the Etruscan Francois tomb at Vulci.
• 325 BC - 300 BC. Etruscan tomb of the Reliefs is constructed at Cerveteri.
• 298 BC. An Etruscan army including forces from Volterra is defeated by the
Romans.
• 294 BC. A Roman army led by L. Postimius Megellus defeats an army from
Etruscan Volsinii.
• 284 BC. Etruscan Volsinii with an army of Gauls attacks Arretium.
• 280 BC. The Romans conquer the Etruscan cities of Tarquinia, Volsinii, and
Vulci.
• 273 BC. Rome conquers the Etruscan town of Cerveteri.
• 264 BC. Etruscan Volsinii is sacked by the Romans, its residents relocated to
Bolsena.
• 90 BC. The former Etruscan city of Vulci is downgraded to a Roman
municipium.
• ca 80 BC. Sulla's campaigns incorporate Etruscan Chiusi into the Roman
Republic.



12
• 54 BC. The Roman emperor Claudius wrote a history of the Etruscans in 20
books, now lost, based on sources still available in his day.
It is very unfortunate that the surviving history of the Etruscans was written by their
adversaries, the Romans; it naturally didn't include many details about their early history.
The Etruscans' own rich, native literature has not survived, because it was destroyed on
purpose.
Customs
The custom of Gladiatorial "sports" was Etruscan in origin; however, it was totally
perverted by the Romans to be a public spectacle rather than a religious rite. It became
more for entertainment for the living rather than for the dead. To the Etruscans, it was a
ceremonial act to honor a prominent deceased leader. This was a way to help send the
deceased to the afterlife, with a guardian and a servant. Such customs which included
sending servants with the deceased rulers were very common among the Sumerians,
Cimmerians and Scythians, who all buried servants and sometimes even family members
with their rulers for the purpose of accompanying them in their afterlife. (The tradition
of sports events associated with festivities I believe was described for Scythians and
Cimmerians, is recorded for Turkic people, and still continues to this day, as far as I
know, in Tatarstan and surrounding polities. Etruscans were a part of that inheritance.
Festivities had nothing to do with the Tengrian religion, and probably predated it. With
the advent of the organized religions, they could be adopted for religious context. A
funeral ceremony was one such instance of traditional solemnizations where the religious
themes could be imposed)
The Greek version of the Cimmerian duels to the death claimed that the Cimmerian royal
family was paired off and fought to the death, upon hearing that the Scythians had
conquered their lands. This was so that they could be buried in their homeland, along the
river Tyras along with their ancestors, rather than moving away.
Even more than a millennium after the end of the Etruscan civilization, it is echoed in the
story from the early Hungarian Chronicles about the death of a prominent Hungarian
leader, called Lehel, who was captured following a failed campaign in Germany. The
legend claims that, after being captured, he was led in front of the German Emperor and,
due to his prominent position, was asked for his last wish, before being killed. Lehel then
requested his carved elephant tusk horn so he could blow it one last time, but when he
received it, he jumped in front of the Emperor and dashed it on his head, killing him
instantly. He then said that he was now ready to die, because he had a worthy servant in
the afterlife.
The Fasces as the state symbol
The Latin symbol of the "fasces", a double headed ax embedded in a bundle of wooden
rods also originates from the Etruscan "fashe" which also became the symbol of the
Roman state. This unfortunately also became a symbol of the later Italian fascists. The
explanation of this could be that since the symbol of Etruscan chiefs was the miniature



13
ax that they carried with them, an alliance of the tribes used one ax bundled by many
staffs signifying their alliance. Much later in history, we have a similar explanation of
the same idea, when the old Bulgarian king Kurbat called his sons together and asked
them not to break up upon his death the old Volga Bulgar state amongst themselves,
because together they were strong, but separated they would fall. (Volga and Bulgar are
related) He illustrated this by being unable to break a bunch of arrows together, signifying
the strength of the tribal confederacy, while easily breaking a single arrow, a symbol of
a single tribe. Unfortunately, the sons did not follow his advice, which caused the loss of
their kingdom.
Women's place in Etruscan society
Romans and Greeks often criticized the Etruscans because of their egalitarian attitude
toward women, which is also reflected in many Scythian, Uralic, Altaic and Sumerian
customs, in contrast to the Indo-European and Semitic patriarchal customs past and
present. Traditions of these egalitarian societies gave great freedom and leadership
positions to women, where they could even be rulers, warriors, and military leaders,
treated with no prejudice over men. Whether the Etruscans had female rulers, we don't
know. They also gave prominence to various goddesses who were very rare in proto
Indo-European societies and usually were borrowed later from other preceding native
people they replaced. In their art, Etruscan women were often illustrated alongside their
men, enjoying all the amenities and not treated differently from the men. The Romans
and Greeks were offended by such unheard-of freedoms and egalitarian customs toward
women and called such women vile names. The Latin name for Etruscans "tuscus" for
example was retained as a derogatory term in Spanish in the form of "tosco", with the
meaning of "vulgar".

Burial Customs
According to the American archeologist Hugh Hencken, the early Etruscan Urn burial
customs were similar to the early Urnfield culture in the Carpathian Basin; from there they



14
spread to other parts of Europe. The remains of families were typically buried together in
semi-subterranean homes which were lavishly decorated and included ashes of multiple
generations of relatives. Sarcophaguses often represented individuals enjoying life at their
prime. I strongly believe that they believed in an afterlife.
The Etruscan Calendar
It also appears that the Etruscans gave the term "calendar" and some names of the months
to that calendar.
1) January perhaps from (i)Ani the god of the sky.
2) February from Februs the god of initiation, the underworld
3) March is Velcitna,
4) April is perhaps from Aber-as is the name of the lower level clans.
5) May is Ampile
6) June is from (i)Uni (Juno), the chief goddess and wife of the chief god Tin. This also
corresponds to Umai, a consort of the Turkic Tengri ~ Tin/Uni = Tengri/Umai.
-----------------Summer Solstice, the longest day, June 21------------------------
7) July was called Turan, also a mother goddess often likened to Venus
8) August was called Ermi, after The god Hermes,
9) September was called Celi, after Cel the earth and birth mother goddess.
10) October Chosfer
11) November ?
12) December is supposedly Mas-an

Religion and Myth
We are left with very little information about the Etruscan religion except for some late
foreign comments about them. The extensive written Etruscan libraries and books were
lost and destroyed. What we think we know about their religion is based on false
comparisons and conjectures that try to make Etruscan gods comply with Greco-Roman
characteristics. You might say that these comparisons are often based on ignorance and
arrogance. In fact, there were many native gods which were uniquely different from the
Greco-Roman mythology, even though time tended to assimilate common traits or at least
to associate them on a purely superficial basis. Etruscan religion was codified, organized
and documented in several lost volumes on different religious aspects, procedures, and
rituals.
According to the legends, the tenets of the Etruscan religion were introduced by a non
human prophet who arose from a plowed field. He was a young boy with serpent-like legs,
with a great knowledge and the wisdom of an old man. When the plowman reported his



15
presence to the governor, the various "lucomo" governors came to see and hear his
teachings and recorded them in writing. After he was finished he disappeared. References
claim that he was a grandson of the chief god called Tin. His name is recorded as Tages.
Since one of the ideas we have introduced here was that the Etruscan language was similar
to Uralic and Altaic, we can use that theory to try to interpret it using Turkic Teng-ri or
Sumerian Ding-ir . This can mean a divinity or in the case of Turkic it has a literal meaning
of sky. So perhaps "Ta(n)g-es" referred to a heavenly being (-s was an Etruscan adjectival
suffix). The Etruscan religion had several native deities as well as shared deities with the
Romans and Greeks. Such native deities as Tin (chief god), Ani (sky god), Usil (sun god),
AuKil (dawn), Turan (Venus), Vol-tuma (afterlife) (Turkic tuma is tomb, Hungarian
töm=stuff into a cavity; tem-et=bury), Cel (earth, birth), Min-erva (wisdom goddess),
Nethune (water god) and others originated from them.
The Etruscan word for god is "aes" and when combined with the name of their chief god
"tin", we have "aes-tin" which is equivalent to the "one god" of the Hungarians "ös/is-ten"
that has further links in the Near East. The "ae" could be pronounced as a single phoneme
"ö". There have also been claims that the term for the plural gods in Etruscan "aes-ar" could
be related to the Egyptian god of the afterlife and also the ancestor cult called "Ashur",
which became Osiris in Greek. The "-ar" suffix, however, in Etruscan was simply a plural
suffix, but not in Egyptian.
Uni (Juno=yuno), was the chief goddess and the wife of Tin. Among the early Etruscan
customs, Maria Bonghi Jovino (Italian) has noticed that many sacred objects made from
deer antlers are tied to the earliest Etruscan cults. According to her view, such offerings
made of antlers, originally were not for Janus Saturnus, but for the prominent goddess
Uni. Professor Alinei called her a goddess of "fate", Uni, with the female deer "ene" a
source of her name. He compares this to the Hungarian cult of the heavenly female-deer
"eneh or ünö" associated with the ancestral legend of a female-deer, whose male
counterpart was the giant storm god "Nemere" (Nimrod). Their legendary offspring were
the twins, Hunor and Magor, the mythical ancestors of the Huns and Magyars.
Illustrations of the heavenly deer are found from Europe to the borderlands of China.
Ani was the god of beginnings and the sky, whose name is similar to the high god of the
Sumerians called AN. The many close ties of the Etruscans, with the Near East could be
the source of these similarities, however this is also a valid derivation of the FU "*säŋe",
where the lead "s" is deleted in Hungarian and Sumerian, while "ng=ŋ" becomes n or g, so
that Hungarian "ég" and Sumerian "an" are both valid derivations. Perhaps Turkic
converted *s to a t, so that it become "teng+ri" for the sky. (Lakó & Rédei A Magyar
szókészlet FU elemei, Bp 1972, Vol I, p. 139) It is important to mention that, in Etruscan,
the word "an" has also been interpreted as air over the world, light, clear. Its main meaning
appears to be "air".
Cathe is often illustrated as the rising sun over the sea and is just one aspect of the sun
god. This image represents the rising sun (In Hungarian *kel- =arise, ford), and is also used
for the rising or fording of the sun in "kell-et"= east, arising sun. This is also related to the
name of the Keltic (Celtic) people according to their own definition of the name.



16
Usil was another aspect of the sun god. The risen sun with characteristic heat and bright
light may be the source of his name. There is also the possibility that his name is linked to
the Latin sol for sun, however "zal, sal" also represents “shining” in Etruscan, while saluc
was a star. These words are both found in Uralic *ćel-ke, Altaic *čil-âlı=shining, and
Sumerian zal-ag with the meanings of shining and star. It appears that perhaps it was Latin
that borrowed this as sol, from Etruscan.
The goddess au-Kél was similar to the Roman Aurora, who renews herself every morning
and flies across the sky, announcing the arrival of the sun. The key words here are to arise
and resurrection as well as rebirth. The word is found in Uralic *kälä and Altaic *kela and
Sumerian gal-am (climb up). Even Celtic has the meaning of "Ceilt-each" or easterner, the
place of rising. The meaning of the prefix "au" isn't recognized.
The Roman god Neptune was the god of fresh water and the sea which derives from
Etruscan. The Etruscan name was Neth-un, and originally was a god of fresh water,
probably of springs. His name is not from Latin since Neth means water in Etruscan.
Hungarian nedv=wet, moisture; nátha is the head cold that is the source of a runny nose.
The goddess Cel "Kel" was the earth-mother goddess. Slight variations of her name are
found in Sumerian (Ki =place, land) to Finno-Ugrian (*kil'e=place) (Hungarian
hely=place), Altaic (guli=dwelling) and Dravidian (*kâl =place). Its meaning is earth,
place, country. In FU mythology she is called the chief goddess "Kal-tes".
Thes-an was the Etruscan goddess who also symbolized the dawn.
Lar-an was the Etruscan version of the god of war, known as Mars by the Romans. Since
Etruscan has many examples of the "n" becoming an "l", we can compare the name to "ner"
or "nar", which happens to coincide with the Sumerian god of war known as Ner-Gal
which meant the great-victor. Hungarian "nyer [ñer]" also means to win. Gal is great or
powerful.
Several Greek deities were also adapted and worshiped by the Etruscans. The Greek
mythological element appears mostly in various legendary heroes and demigods and their
exploits, such as Hercle (Hercules), Apulu or Aplu (Apollo), Atunis (Adonis) the lover of
Turan.
Artemis was also worshiped by the Etruscans as "Artuma", but Artemis originally was a
Thracian and Scythian goddess that the Greeks adopted. To the Greeks she was the goddess
of the hunt as well as birth, and the protector of girl's purity. According to the Greek
historian Herodotus, her Scythian name was "Artim-paz". The name Artum has a similar
sounding word in both Turkic "ärdäm" and Hungarian "érdem" meaning virtue. (é
pronounced like the letter “a”.) The Scythian Artim-paz probably refers to the "head of
virtuousness" possibly referring to virginity, chastity? Unfortunately, we don't know the
Etruscan word for head, and for most body parts to verify this. The additional ending “paz”,
may refer to the Türkic "bash" or head and also FU "*paŋe" head (Hungarian "fő" = head,
main, chief).



17
Etruscans were a highly religious and, according to the early Christians, perhaps even a
superstitious people, because they viewed most natural phenomena as being messages from
the gods. Anybody can point a finger at anybody else, since a religion is a mysticism, of a
particular version. The so called "priests" of the Etruscans were not just spiritual teachers
but they were also the scientists and engineers of their civilization. The two fields had not
yet separated. According to the early Roman Catholic Church, the late Etruscans were
reviled as the mother of superstition. That was the proclaimed reason the Christians gave
for the destruction of their extensive literature. They had different types of priests or
shamans, some of whom were famous for their fortune-telling. Like shamans, they saw
messages from the gods in many natural events, like lightning, or the flights of birds, the
liver of sacrificial animals and the like. Due to many similarities in Etruscan, Sumerian and
Ugrian terminology, I have included a comparison table of the Etruscan deities for all three.
Some of these may be coincidental similarities, but strangely, they appear to be quite
similar in sound and in function.

Even the Roman origin myth of the twin boys called Romulus and Remus, raised by a
female wolf, who founded Rome, is believed to originate from the Etruscans. The names
Romulus and Remus are not Latin, and they cannot be explained by Indo-European
languages. The legend of the boys being raised by the wolf (böri/far-kas) reminds me of
the Hunnic and Turkic tradition of the female royal wolf "asena" and numerous similar
legends. Various canines are traditionally the totem animals and names of some Turkic
tribes.
Beekes believed that the name of the Etruscan hero Tarchon is to be tied to the high god,
the god of war and storm and lightning, called Tarhun(t) of the Hittites, who were the
neighbors of the Meonia, Masas and or Mysi in Anatolia. Tarchon is an Etruscan
religious hero, who with his father Telephos led the Etruscans to settle the Italian
peninsula. Perhaps because of this, these settlers remembered their leader "Telephos",



20
which in Hungarian is "telepes", and means a settler. Naturally that could be just a
coincidence, a claim which I leave to the reader to decide.
Tarchunt could be understood in Hungarian as "(*t>d) dörgö" that means thunderer,
which is an apt name for a storm god. Supposedly the voiced stops, like b, d, g did not
exist in proto Hungarian, which would have used p, t, k instead, resulting in something
like tarku. At the same time Turkic "Tarxan" and Hungarian "Tarján/Targyan" are
archaic titles of nobility, a local sovereign prince, which in Hungarian also became an
early tribal name "Tarján". Herodotus wrote that he was a mythical ancestor of the
Scythians, by the name "Targi-tarus". (prince of the tribe) In Parthian-Scythian, his name
was shortened to "Tura", as the legendary ancestor of the Parthians.
Etruscan Writing and Literature
The earliest Etruscan writing is from around 700BC. There is evidence that there was a
large body of Etruscan historical literature, law, drama and religious works in the past.
Perhaps even musical notation, although there is no evidence of that left for us. An
Etruscan playwright known as Volnius is also recorded, although none of his works
survived. The Romans admired the rich literary culture of the Etruscans. They often sent
their sons to study in their schools. Besides many written texts in grave goods and
illustrations, Etruscan-like texts have been found on the island of Lemnos, near Anatolia,
while a very famous text was found in Egypt, written on the mummy linens. Apparently,
the Etruscan cloth "book" known today as the "Liber Linteus" was at one time cut up and
used for bandages for an Egyptian mummy. Unfortunately, most of the extensive
literature of the Etruscans was destroyed in the 4th century AD during the reign of
Emperor Honorius (394-408 AD) by the book-burning Christians. However, there are
many shorter texts found on stone and metal objects as well as inside family crypts.
Libraries with books are easily burned, however there are still around 6000 or more
Etruscan inscriptions found today. Unfortunately, most of these tend to be short funerary
inscriptions. Since many archeological sites have not been explored yet, we can hope that
longer texts may have survived.
The Etruscan Alphabet



21
The source of the Etruscan alphabet is believed to be an early form of Greek and
Phoenician alphabets, not to be compared with the later classical Greek alphabet. These
have changed over time. I would categorize its features as runic-type engraved letters.
Hungarian, Turkic, and Germanic runic alphabets seem to share a considerable number
of common symbols with Etruscan, but in most cases with different phonetic values. This
is not at all uncommon, because even the Latin alphabet has quite a few variations used
by different languages. For example, depending on the language that uses it, the sound
of the letter C may be completely different. Therefore, when comparing similar symbols,
don't expect them to perfectly line up! Also note that not all symbols are depicted in the
following table.
Conclusion
The Etruscan culture was very vibrant and rich, with extensive literature, art and science.
In Italy, Etruscans introduced many technical innovations, and through their extensive
trade they introduced their products and innovations throughout the Mediterranean. From
England to Greece, many legends talk of them. Besides giving literacy to the early Latins,
founding Rome and many cities of ancient Italy, they gave the Romans and the rest of us
some of their cultural words and numerous traditions. We see their influence in many
areas, yet in many ways they are still not well known, and because of that, they remain
mysterious to us. Their language is still only partially understood and different scholars
explain differently some of their vocabulary. For those interested in what is known about
the characteristics, vocabulary, and syntax of basic Etruscan, I have summarized my
findings in an article on the Etruscan language. I am not a scholar of Etruscology;
therefore, I am relying on the available Etruscan references written by established
experts. This is not my own invention. I cannot vouch for what others have claimed. I



22
say this because I expect to be rebuked for the material presented here, which cannot be
free of errors. This is a work in progress.
