Where Did Blue Eyes Originate From?
Posted by Monte Aldone
Studies carried out by scientists from the Institute of Forensic Genetics at the University of Copenhagen have concluded that all blue-eyed people share a common ancestor, someone who lived 6,000 to 10,000 years ago near the area by the Black sea.
Researchers analyzed and compared the unique genetic make-up of the chromosomes in the iris from 155 blueeyed individuals from diverse regions such as Denmark, Turkey and Jordan.
All of the subjects that participated in the study had the exact same genetic "mutations" in specific chromosomes of the eye with very little variation on the genes, indicating that the "mutation" responsible for blue-eyes first arose and spread relatively recently.

Scientists conclude that this blue-eyed family spread out from an area north of the Black Sea following the last ice age. These people were among the proto-Indo-European Aryans who subsequently spread agriculture into western Europe and later rode horses into Iran and India, explains Professor Hans Eiberg of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the University of Copenhagen.

Blue eyes are a recessive trait, and the gene must be inherited from both parents. (Green eyes involve a related but different gene that is recessive to brown but dominant to blue.)
Following the ending of the last Ice Age, many Europeans inherited this rare gene associated with blue-eyed people that differentiated them from the rest of the human races.
Indeed, it appears that the elite and nobility that organized the earliest known agricultural civilizations all shared this trait, seemingly coming from the same bloodline.
When we look to ancient Egypt, arguably one of the world's oldest known civilizations, we find many blonde and fair-haired mummies. Since WW2, western academia backed and lobbied by politically motivated forces at the United Nations has pushed for a Marxist inspired multicultural view of history, which has ignored archeological evidence in favor of political correctness. However well intentioned, this false perspective has cast much confusion over human origins: Who we are and how we came to be.

Another one of the oldest documented civilizations, credited with having the first writing, schools, courts, and many other "firsts" were the ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia. The ancient Sumerians thought that blue eyes were a sign of the gods. The Sumerian nobility were blue eyed and fair haired, as most of their busts show.
These blue eyed statues (pictured below) are of Sumerians from the early/mid 3rd millennium BC. ''...they (the Sumerians) certainly belong to the same racial division of mankind as the nations of Europe, they are scions of the Caucasian stock’’ - Arthur Keith (quoted in Ur Excavations, 1927)
Gautama Buddha's physical body is traditionally regarded as having the "Thirty-two Characteristics of a Great Man". These 32 characteristics are described throughout the Pali Canon, and are also regarded as being present in Cakravartin kings as well. #29 on this ancient list is "Eyes deep blue".

Two thousand years ago a mysterious and little known civilization, with a blue-eyed elite, ruled the northern coast of Peru. Its people were called the Moche. They built huge pyramids that still dominate the surrounding countryside; some well over a hundred feet tall.
Archeologists working at Peru's Huaca Pucllana ruins recently pulled a blue-eyed mummy from an ancient tomb thought to be from the ancient Wari culture that flourished before the Incas. Piercing blue eyes undimmed by the passing of 1,300 years, this is the "Lady of the Mask" – a mummy with striking blue eyes, whose discovery could reveal the secrets of a lost culture at the Huaca Pucllana Pyramid located in Lima, Peru. It is the first time a tomb from the region’s Wari culture has been discovered intact and gives historians the chance to learn about the ancient pre-Incan civilizations.
The Lord of Sipán's tomb (pictured below) is held by some archaeologists to be one of the most important archaeological discoveries in this region of the world in the last 30 years, as the main tomb was found intact and untouched by thieves.

He was called Viracocha by the Incas, Kukulkan by the Mayas, Quetzalcoatl by the Aztecs, Gucumatz in Central America, Votan in Palenque and Zamna in Izamal. He and in some cases his ‘men’ were described as being tall, bearded, with white skin, and beautiful emerald blue eyes. Fray Juan Torquemada, the Franciscan missioner, who collected traditions about Quetzalcoatl from the natives of Old Mexico, says: “Quetzalcoatl had blonde hair, and wore a black robe sewn with little crosses of red color.” (Image below published by the Secretary of Education, Mexico)
Scientists stress that the genetic variation, as the press release puts it, is "neither a positive nor a negative mutation."
That's a bit disingenuous, as the mutation also produces greater instance of blond hair (sexually selected for even today) and fair skin, which confers a survival advantage by stimulating greater production of vitamin D in sun-starved northern European countries near the arctic circle - where blue eyes are still most prevalent.

Ninety-five percent of Europeans in Scandinavian countries have blue eyes. They are also found to have a greater range of hair and skin color. Comparatively, Europe has a wider variety of hair color and skin pigment than is found in any other continent in the world.
These "mutations" are relatively recent as Europe was colonized only a few thousand years ago, say mainstream scientists. Through interbreeding, the brunette with blue eyes (Neanderthal-type) was evidenced about 35,000- 25,000 years ago by invading Cro magnon types from the Atlantic (Tall, RH negative blood type, Solutrean tool kit).
“The question really is, ‘Why did we go from having nobody on Earth (known) with blue eyes 10,000 years ago to having 20 or 40 percent of Europeans having blue eyes now?”
John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin-Madison said. “This gene does something good for people. It makes them have more kids.” 6/7



In contrast, most mammals on earth share the "normal" form of the gene. The six-letter sequence is exactly the same among mice, horses, cows, rats, dogs, cats, monkeys, chimpanzees and humans with brown eyes. (No word on what gives Siberian huskies and Siamese cats blue eyes.)
