Vl PREF.AOE. I
and on the continent, more especiallyin Germany; and
the scientific spirit which has been introduced into
the study of the Assyrian language has immeasurably
increased our knowledge of it. Thanks to the labours
of men like Oppert, Lenormant and Guyard in France,
or of Schrader, Delitzsch, Haupt and Hommel in
Germany, texts which were obscure and doubtful at
the time of Mr. Smith's death have now become
almost as clear as .a page of the more difficult por
tions of the Old Testament. The Assyrian student,
moreover, has an advantage which the Hebrew stu
dent has not; he possesses dictionaries and vocabu
laries compiled by the Assyro-Babylonians them
selves, and these frequently throw light on a word
which otherwise would be a " hapax legomenon."
The more backward condition of our knowledge of
Assyrian, however, was not the only difficulty against
which Mr. Smith had to contend. He was pressed
for time when writing the present volume, which had
to be finished before his departure for the East.
The class of texts, also, which he had brought to
light was a new class hitherto unknown, or almost
unknown, to the Assyrian decipherer. He ];tad to
break fresh ground in dealing with them. Their
style differed considerably from that of the texts
previously studied; they had a vocabulary of their
o,vn, allusions of their own, and even, it may be
added, a grammar of their own. If the texts had
been complete the difficulty perhaps would not have
been so great; but it was enormously increased by
..

.
their mutilated condition. The skill and success with
which Mr. Smith struggled against all these diffi
culties show more plainly than ever what a loss As
syrian research has sustained in him.
Nevertheless, even the genius of Mr. Smith could
not do more than give a general idea of the contents
of the fragments, and not always even this. A com
parison of the translations contained in the present
edition with those contained in the preceding ones
will show to what an extent the details of translation
have had to be modified and changed, sometimes with
important consequences. Thus the corrected trans
lation of the fragments relating to the Tower of
Babel will remove the doubts raised by Mr. Smith's
translation as to his correctness in associating them
with that event; thus, too, the corrected rendering
of a passage in the Izdubar Epic will show that the
practice of erecting a Bethel or sacred stone was
familiar to the early Babylonians. In some instances
Mr. Smith has misconceived the true character of a
whole text. What he believed to be a record of the
Fall, for instance, .is really, as M. Oppert first
pointed out, a hymn to the Creator.
On the other hand, the fresh materials that have
been acquired by the British Museum during the
last five years, or a closer examination of the trea
sures it already possessed, have enabled us to add to
the number of cuneiform texts which illustrate the
earlier portions of Genesis. Mr. Rassam, for ex
ample, has brought home a fragment of the Deluge

tablet, which not only helps us to fill up some of the
lacun{13 in the text, but is also important in another
way. It is written, not in Assyrian, but in Babylonian
cuneiform characters, and comes, not from an Assyrian,
but from a Babylonian library. But it agrees exactly
with the corresponding parts of the Assyrian editions
of the story, and thus furnishes us with a proof of the
trustworthiness of the Assyr~n copies of the old
Babylonian texts. The text, again, which relates to
the destruction of a country by a rain of fire, though
long contained in the British Museum Collection,
was first noticed by myself as being apparently the
Babylonian version of the biblical account of the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
Numerous alterations and insertions have had to
be made in the text which accompanies the trans
lations. The latter necessarily occupied the main
part of Mr. Smith's attention; he had neither time
nor inclination to enter very elaborately into the
qμestions raised by them, or the ill~strations they
might receive from elsewhere. In fact, any adequate
treatment of the great lzdubar Epic, for · instance,
demanded a special acquaintance with the method
and results of Comparative Philology, as well as a
more intimate knowledge of its history and character
than was possible at the time when Mr. Smith
wrote.
A large proportion of the cuneiform texts from
which the translations contained in the present volume
are made has not yet been published. I have, how



PBBF.AOB. I•X
ever, gone carefully over them all with the exception
of a small portion of the lzdubar Epic, and en
deavoured to bring the translations up to the level of
..our present knowledge of the Assyrian language. I
am indebted to the ready kindness and accurate eye
of Mr. Pinches for copies of almost all the unpub
lished portions of the lzdubar legends. In these he
has coITected several faulty readings, more especially
that of the name of the pilot of Xisuthrus, which
ought to be Nes-Hea, "the lion of Hea." Mr. Pinches
assures me that the name of the deity composing the
second part of the name is invariably written with
the numeral 40, the symbol of the god Hea, except
once when the scribe has miswritten 50, the symbol
of Bel, and he has pointed out to me a passage in a
bilingual tablet where the name is explained in
Assyrian by Nes-Hea. Unfortunately, the texts
given in pp.103-124 cannot be found, and here there
fore I have been obliged to leave Mr. Smith's trans
lations unaltered.
The reader, however, must remember that no
translations of these mutilated tablets can be more
than approximately correct. Even if the meaning
of all the words were well known, and they were
divided from one another (which is not the case), the
broken condition of so many of the inscriptions would
make a good deal of the translation more or less
conjectural This must be doubly the case where
the signification of the words is either unknown or
only half known. I have always endeavoured to



X PBEF.AOJJJ.
indicate a doubtful word or passage by a query; but
there must be instances in which the meaning that I
believe ought to be assigned to particular words will
be corrected by the further progress of discovery.
This is even more true of what may be termed the
commentary accompanying the translations. Sur
prises are constantly in store for the Assyrian de
cipherer, and a tiny fragment may suddenly throw a
new light on a question he had supposed to be
settled. In fact, in Assyriology, as in all other _
branches of science, there is no :finality; we cannot
be more than approximately exact at any given time,
and every month enables us to introduce fresh cor
rections and improvements into our work.
A fresh illustration of the fact has been afforded
even while the present volume has been passing
through the press. Mr. Pinches has come across
two fragments (one marked S 669, the other unnum
bered) which belong to two separate copies or editions
of a very interesting work. This is nothing less
than a list of the ancient epics and legends of
Chaldea, along with the names of their reputed
authors, many of whom, however, are probably as
mythical as the famous Rishis of India. The list
shows how numerous these early poems were, and
how few of them, comparatively, we possess at
present. Both fragments belong to the same part of
the list, and we are therefore ignorant of many of the
ancient compositions it must originally have con
tained. Some of the works mentioned receive their



PBBF.AOB.
names from the heroes celebrated in them, others are
named from their opening lines. A distinction is
drawn between tliose that belonged to the Accadian
period, and were written by Accadian poets in the
Accadian language, and those that were of Semitic
Babylonian origin. The interest of the list is en
hanced by the great antiquity of the poems it re
cords, none of them being later than about 2000 B.c.
Here is a translation of the text as restored from a
comparison of the two fragments according to the
copies I have made of them :

. 14. . . . . a tu gab [Acc.]. This is the work of
Lig-Dimir the scribe, the man (of a non-existent
tablet).
What is meant by the phrase "the man of a non
existent tablet," I do not know. Possibly it signifies
that the autograph of the author no longer existed at
the time the list was drawn up. '' The Bull of the
firmame~t " was a legend which was probably con
nected with the second month of the year, originally,
it would seem, the first, which like the zodiacal sign
after which it was named, was called the month of
'' the directing bull."
Future excavations will doubtless bring to light
some of the poems mentiQned in the list and not
previously known. I have myself lately come across
two fragments (S 802 and. S 316) whicli _belong to
legends hitherto unknown, but they are too short to
be worth translating. What curious revelations,
however, we may yet expect from the cuneif~rm
records may be judged from a small and well



•

preserved tablet recently brought to England, which
contains a catalogue of the gardens belonging to
Merodach-Baladan, the contemporary of Hezekiah, and
grouped according to the districts in which they were
situated. Merodach-Baladan must have been fond of
horticulture, since the catalogue contains the names
of no less than sixty-seven seed-gardens, besides six
other pleasure-grounds. Many of them were named
from the localities in whose- neighbourhood they
were, but others bore such significant titles as " the
forest of reeds," "the small enclosure," or "the
garden of the waters of the city." As the tablet
was copied by a scribe named Merodach-sum-iddin,
probably in the time of Nebuchadnezzar or his
successors, it is evident that some of the contents
of the library of Babylon escaped the destruction
brought upon that city by Sennacherib in B.C. 692.
I may add that since the greater part of this
edition has been in type, I have found myself able
to explain the name of the hero which in default
of the true transcription has been provisionally
read lzdubar. The name is composed of three
ideographs, the first of which is the determinative
prefix of wood, while the two latter are rendered
saptu saplitu, "the lower lip," in Semitic Assyrian.
Now M. Lenormant has shown that lzdubar was
originally the Accadian Fire-god, and Mr. Boscawen
has pointed out that the fire-stick was once used
in Babylonia; it is therefore evident that the three
ideographs composing the name represent the lower

piece of W"OOOt with a lip or groove in iliJ whkh formed the most impor1&nt port of the primiti.-e li~macliine. I bclie.-e the Aceadian pl'<>OOnclation ofthe na.me will turn out to be Kibina..

three hundred years after the captivity of the Jews in
Babylon, the great antiquity of these traditions could
not be proved with certainty, much less their inde
pendence of the accounts which we have in Genesis.
On the discovery and decipherment of the cunei
form inscriptions, Oriental scholars hoped that copies
of the Babylonian histories and traditions would one
day be found, and that earlier and more satisfactory
evidence as to these primitive histories than had
previously been accessible, would th11S be gained.
In the mound of Kouyunjik, opposite the town of
Mosul, Mr. Layard discovered part of the Royal
Assyrian library, and further collections, also forming
part of this library, have been subsequently found
by Mr. H. Rassam, Mr. Loftus, and Mr. George Smith.
Sir Henry Rawlinson, who made the preliminary
examination of Mr. Layard's treasures, and was the
first to recognize their value, estimated the number
of fragments brought from this Library at over twenty
thousand.
The attention of decipherers was in the first in
stance drawn to the later historical inscriptions, par
ticularly to those of the Assyrian kings contemporary
with the Hebrew monarchy; and in this department
of research a very large number of texts of great
importance rewarded the toil of Assyrian scholars.

parts of ancient history previously obscure, for a long·
time occupied almost exclusively the attention of
students, and overshadowed any work in other divi
sions of Assyrian literature.
Although it was known that Assyria borrowed its
civilization and written characters from Babylonia,
yet, as the Assyrian nation was throughout the greater
part of its independent existence hostile to the south
ern and older kingdom, it could not be guessed
beforehand that the peculiar national traditions of
Babylonia would have been transported to Assyria.
Under these circumstances, for some years after
the cuneiform inscriptions were first deciphered,
nothing was looked for or discovered bearing upon
the events described in Genesis; but, as new texts
were brought into notice, it became evident that the
Assyrians borrowed their literature largely from
Babylonian sources, and it appeared likely that search
among the fragments of Assyrian inscriptions would
yield traces at least of some of these ancient Baby
lonian legends.
Attention was early drawn to this fact by Sir
Henry Rawlinson, who pointed out several coinci
dences between the geography of Babylonia and the
account of Eden in Genesis, and suggested the great
probability that the accounts in Genesis had a Baby
lonian origin.
While preparing the fourth volume of Cuneiform
Inscriptions for the trustees of the British Museum,
Mr. George Smith noticed references to the Creation

THE DISOOVEBY OF
in a tablet numbered K 63 in the Museum collection,
as well as allusions in other tablets to similar legends ;
he therefore searched through a series of tablets he
had previously classed as "Mythological," in order to
find, if possible, some of these legends. This series
of mythological tablets was one of six into which he
had divided the Museum collection of cu11eiform in
scriptions for convenience of working. By placing
all the tablets and fragments ofthe same class together;
he had been able to complete several texts, to find
easily any subject required, and to get, whenever it was
needed, a general idea of the contents of the collection.
The mythological division contained all the tablets
which related to Assyrian mythology, ·and all the
legends in which the gods took a leading. part, to
gether with prayers and similar subjects.
A steady search among these fragments soonbrought
to light half of a curious tablet which- had evidently
contained originally six columns of text ; two of these
(the third and fourth) were still nearly perfect; two
others (the second and fifth) were imperfect, about
half being lost, while the remaining columns (the
first and sixth) were entirely gone. A statement in
the third column that " the ship " had rested on the
mountain of Nizir, followed by an account of the
sending forth of a dove, and its finding no resting
place and returning, convinced Mr. Smith that he had
discovered a portion at least of the Chaldean account
of the Deluge. He then proceeded to read through
the document, and found it was in the form of a



THE GENESIS LEGENDS. s
speech from the hero of the Deluge to a person
whose name might be transcribed as lzdubar. The
same name had already been read on the fragment of
another tablet numbered K 231, which turned out to
belong to the same series of tablets as the newly-found
account of the Deluge. Mr. Smith was thus encou...
raged to make a search for other portions ofthe series.
The search was a long and heavy work, for there
were thousands of fragme11ts to be examined, and
these were so small, and contained so little of the text,
that it was extremely difficult to ascertain their
meaning. The search, however, proved successful.
A fragment of another copy of the Deluge was found
containing a second account of the sending forth of
the birds. Several other portions of the same tablet
were gradually collected and fitted one after another
into their places until the greater part of the second
column was filled up. Portions of a third copy were
next discovered, which, when joined together, com
pleted a considerable part of the first and sixth
columns. Mr. Smith now translated the text he had
so laboriously pieced together, and published his
discovery to the world at a meeting of the Society of
Biblical Archreology, December 3rd, 1872. By this
time he had made out that the series of lzdubar
legends, as we may term them, contained twelve
tablets or books. Of this series the tablet describing
the Deluge was· the eleventh and K 231 the sixth.
The interest excited by Mr. Smith's discovery was
naturally very great. Immediately after the meeting



6 THJ!l DISOOVJ!JBY OF
of the Society of Biblical Archreology, Mr. E. Arnold,
in the name of the proprietors of the '' Daily Tele
graph," asked the fortunate discoverer to reopen, at
their cost, the excavations in Assyria in the hope of
finding the missing portions of the story of the Deluge.
The trustees of the British Museum granted Mr.
Smith leave of absence for the purpose, and he ac
cordi11gly started for the ruins of Nineveh, and there
engaged in researches, the historJT of which is related in
his work entitled "Assyrian Discoveries." Hardly
had he begun his excavations on the site of the palace
of Assur-bani-pal at Kouyunjik, when he came across
a new fragment of the Chaldean account of the Deluge
belonging to the first column of the tablet, containing
the command to build and fill the ark, and nearly
filling up the most considerable blank in the story.
Some otl1er fragments, found aft~rwards, still further
completed this tablet, which was already the most
perfect one in the Izdubar series. The trench in
which the fragment in question was discovered must
have passed very near the part of the Library in which
the Assyrians kept a series of inscriptions relating to
the early history of the world. The same trench soon
afterwards yielded a fragment of the sixth tablet,
describing the destruction of the bull of !star by
lzdubar and Heabani, an incident often depicted on
early Babylonian gems. The next discovery was a
fragment which referred to the creation of the world;
it formed the upper corner of a tablet, and gave a
fragmentary account of the creation of animals. Two
•



THE GJ!JNJ!JBIB LEGENDS. 7
other portions of this legend were found further on in
the trench, one of which contained a mutilated account
of the war between the gods and evil spirits.
In the following year Mr. Smith was again in
Assyria, in charge of an expedition sent out by the
trustees of the British Museum, and succeeded in
bringing home fresh fragments relating to the early
traditions and legends of Babylonia. Among these
is the fragment which seems to describe the building
of the Tower of Babel. Then followed the disastrous
expedition of 1875-6, in the course of which Mr.
Smith fell a victim to over-fatigue and his zeal for
Assyrian research. The subsequent explorations of
Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, though rich in other results,
have added very little to our knowledge of the old
Babylonian legends; and it seems probable that the
missing portions of the tablets which contained them
have irretrievably perished. We must wait for
further light upon the subject until the cities and
libraries of Babylonia have been excavated. After
all, the early Babylonian legends, of which copies
were made for the Assyrian Library at Kouyunjik,
were but a selected few; the Assyrians took little
interest in that part of Babylonian literature which
had no connection with their own history or beliefs,
and we have reason to congratulate ourselves that
among the traditions they borrowed from their older
and more civilized neighbours were so many which
bear t1pon the earlier chapters of Genesis.
The fragmentary condition of the ·legends' we



8 THJ!l DISOOVBBY OF
possess, however, is much to be lamented. The
chief difficulties with which the Assyrian scholar has
to contend, when dealing with .them, are due to the
mutilated state of the tablets. If the inscriptions
were perfect, their translation would be a compara
tively easy matter. As it is, so skilled a decipherer
as Mr. Smith himself was deceived by the defective
character of the text into imagining that a hymn
addressed to the Creator was the Babylonian version
of the Fall of Man.
The fragmentary and scattered character of these
legends is explained by the nature of the material of
which the tablets are composed, and the changes
undergone by them since they were written. They
consist of fine clay and were inscribed with cuneiform
characters while in a soft state; they were then
baked in a furnace until hard, and afterwards trans
feITed to the library. The library seems to have
been in an upper storey of the palace, and after the
destruction of Nineveh, the fall of the building in
which it was placed naturally caused the tablets con
tair1ed in it to be broken to pieces. Many of them
were cracked and scorched by the heat of the burning
ruins. Subsequently the ruins were turned over in
search of treasure, and the tablets still further
broken ; while, to complete their destruction, the
rain, soaking through the ground every spring,
saturates them with water containing chemicals, and
these chemicals form crystals in every available
crack. The growth of the crystals further splits

fragmentary tablets which have been more than
twenty years in the British Museum have ~een
added to considerably by the fragments recently
brought to E11gland by Mr. Smith and Mr. Rassam;
and yet there probably remain from ten to twenty
thousand fragments still buried in the ruins, without
the recovery of which it is impossible to complete
these valuable Assyrian inscriptions.
It is, nevertheless, out of these imperfect materials
that we have at present to piece together our know
ledge of the early legends of Babylonia and Assyria.
Most, if not all, of them, are, it must be remembered,
of Chaldean or Babylonian origin, the Assyrians
having either slavishly copied Babylonian originals
or simply put into a new form the story they had
borrowed from their southern neighbours. Such as
they are, however, they are presented to the reader
as faithfully translated as our existing knowledge of
the Assyrian language allows ; it is for him to draw
his inferences and make his comparisons. The greater
number of them, as we shall see, mount back to a
date earlier than the second millennium before the
Christian era, and even where the actual text belongs
to a later period, the legend which it embodies claims
a similar antiquity. We may classify them in the
following order :
1. An account of the Creation of the world in six
days, parallel to that in the first chapter of Genesis,
and probably in its present form not older than the
7th century n.c.



THJ!l GJ!JNJ!JBIB LJ!JGJ!JNDB. 11
2. A second account of the Creation, derived from
the Library of Cuthah, and belonging to the oldest
period of Babylonian literature.
3. A history of the conflict between Merodach, the
champion of the gods, and Tiamat, '' th_e Deep," the
representative of chaos and evil. To this we may
add the bilingual legend of the seven evil spirits and
their fight against the moon.
4. The story of the descent of the goddess lstar or
Venus into Hades, and her return.
5. The legend of the sin of the god Zu, punished
by Bel, the father of the gods.
6. A collection of five tablets giving the exploits
of Dibbara the god of the pestilence.
7. The story of the wise man who put forth a
riddle to the gods.
8. The legend of the good man Atarpi, and the
wickedness of the world.
9. The legend of the tower of Babel, and dispersion.
10. The story of the Eagle and Etana.
11. The story of the ox and the horse.
12. The story of the fox.
13. The legend of Sinuri.
14. The lzdubar legends : twelve tablets, with the
history of lzdubar, and an account of the flood.
15. The story of the destruction of Sodom and
Gomorrah. Besides these there are fragments of
other legends, which show that there was a consider
able collection of such primitive stories still quite
unknown to us. In fact we have little chance of



12 THE GENESIS LEGENDS.
becoming acquainted with them until the libraries of
Babylonia are excavated. Thus for example we
learn from Berosus that the Babylonians ascribed
their civilization to certain wonderful creatures who
ascended out of the Persian Gulf, and more especially
to a being called Oannes. But of all this the library
of Nineveh tells us nothing, although an Accadian
Reading-book compiled for Assyrian students con
tains an excerpt which seems to be taken from the
legend of Oannes. It is as follows :
1. To the waters their god
2. had returned.
S. To the glistening house
4. he de~cended (as) an icicle.
5. (On) a seat of snow
6. he grew not old in wisdom.
7. The wise people
8. with his wisdom he filled.
Two fragments, belonging to two editions of the
same text, have just been found, containing a list of
the numerous legends and epics current among the
ancient Babylonians, along with the names of their
authors. Among them are found several of which
translations are given further on in this volume; but
there are also several of which we hear for the first
time. The great Izdubar Epic, it may be noted, is
ascribed to a certain Sin-lici-unnini (" 0 Moon-god,
receive my cry!"). A fuller account of the fragments
and their contents will be found in the Introduction.

from one inch long to over a foot square, are generally ·
in fragments, and in consequence of the changes·
which have taken place in the ruins the fragments of
the same tablet are sometimes scattered widely apart.
They were originally deposited, it would seem, in
one of the upper chambers of the palace, from which
they fell on the destruction of the building. In some
of the lower chambers the whole floor has been found
covered with them, in other cases they lay in groups
or patches on the pavement, and there are occasional
clusters of fragments at various heights in the earth
which covers the ruins. Other fragments are scat
tered singly through all the upper earth which covers
the floors and walls of the palace. Different frag
ments of the same tablet or cylinder are found in
separate chambers which have no immediate connec
tion with each other, showing that their present
distribution has nothing · to do with the original
position of the tablets of which they formed
part.
The inscriptions show that the tablets were ar
ranged according ·to their subjects. Stories or sub
jects were continued on other tablets of the same
size and form as those on which they were com
menced, i11 some cases the number of tablets in a
series and on a single subject amounting to over
one hundred.

.ASSYBI.AN LITBB.ATUBB. 15
·numbering over seventy tablets; bore the title " When
the gods Anu (and) Bel," this being the commence
ment of the first tablet. At the end of every tablet
- in each series was written its number in the work,
thus : "the first tablet of When the gods Anu, Bel,''
"the second tablet of When the gods Anu, Bel,"
&c. &c. ; and, further to preserve the proper position
of each tablet, every one except the last in a series
had at the end a catch phrase, consisting of the first
line of the following tablet. There were besides,
catalogues of these documents written like them on
clay tablets, and .other small oval tablets with titles
upon them, apparently labels for the various series of
works. All these arrangements show the care taken
with respect to literary matters. There were regular
libraries or chambers, probably on the upper floors of
the palaces, appointed for the reception of the tablets,
and custodians or librarians to take charge of them.
These regulations were all of great antiquity, and
like the tablets had a Babylonian origin.
Judging from the fragments discovered, it appears
probable that there were in the Royal Library at
Nineveh over 10,000 inscribed tablets, treating of
almost every branch of knowledge existing at the
time.
In considering a subject like the present one it is·
a point of the utmost importance to define as closely
BB possible the date of our present copies of the
legends, and the most probable period at which the
original copies may have been inscribed. By far the



16 B.ABYLONI.AN .AND
greatest number of the tablets 'brought from Nineveh
belong to the age of Assur-bani-pal, who reigned over
Assyria from B.c. 670, and every copy of what we
will term the Genesis legends yet found was inscribed·
with one exception during his reign. The state
ments made on the tablets themselves are conclusive
on this point, and have not been called in question,
but it is equally stated and acknowledged on all
hands that most of these tablets are not the originals,
but are only copies from earlier texts. It is unfortu
nate that the date of the original copies is never pre
served, and thus a wide door is thrown open for
difference of opinion on the point. The Assyrians ac
knowledged that this class of literature was borrowed
from Babylonian sources, and of course it is to Baby
lonia that we have to look to ascertain the approxi
mate dates of the original documents. But here we
are met by the following difficulty. It appears that
at an early period in Babylonian history a great
literary development took place, and numerous works
were produced which embodied the prevailing myths,
religion, and science of the day. Written many of
them in a noble style of poetry, and appealing to the
strongest feelings of the people on one side, or regis
tering the highest _efforts of their science on the
other, these texts became the standards of Babylo
nian literature, and later generations were content
to copy them instead of composing new works for
themselves. Clay, the material on which they were
written, was everywhere abundant, copies were



.ASSYRIAN LITEBATUBE. 17
multiplied, and the veneration in which the texts
were held fixed and stereotyped their style. Even
the language in which they were written remained
the language of literature up to the period of the
Persian conquest. Thus it happens that texts of
Rim-agu, Sargon, and Khammuragas, who lived at
least a thousand years before Nebuchadnezzar and
Nabonidus, are composed in the same language as the
texts of these later kings, there being no sensible differ
ence in style to match the long interval between them.
We have, however, clear proof that, although
the language of devotion and literature remained
fixed, the speech of the bulk of the people was
gradually modified; nnd in the time of Assur
bani-pal, when the texts of the Genesis legends
which we possess were copied by Assyrian scribes,
the common speech of the day was widely different
from that of literature. The private letters and
despatches of this age which have been discovered
differ considerably in language from the contem
porary public documents and religious writings,
showing the change the language had undergone
since the style of the latter had been fixed. So,
too, in our own country the language of devotion and
the style of the Bible differ in several respects from
those of the English of to-day.
These considerations show the difficulty of fixing
the age of a cuneiform document from its style, and
the difficulty is further increased by the uncertainty
which hangs over all Babylonian chronology-an
C



,
18 BABYLONIAN .AND
uncertainty that can be cleared away only when the
ruined cities of Babylonia are excavated.
Chronology is always a thorny subject, and dry
and unsatisfact~ry to most persons besides ; some.
notice must, however, be taken of it here, in order to
fix something like an approximate date or epoch for
the original composition of the Genesis legends.
The so-called Assyrian Canon affords us an exact
chronology up to the year n.c. 909, and a series
of contemporaneous monuments, together with one
or t~o chronological allusions in later inscriptions,
enables us to work back fr~m this date to a period
falling betweer1 n.c. 1450 and 1400 when Assyria
was brought into close relation with the southern
kingdom of Babylonia. Babylonia was at the time
under the sway of a foreign dynasty of Kossrean
p~ces from the mountains· of Elam, which was over
thrown, as we learn from the Assyrian records, about
n.c. 1270. It had been in possession of the coul\.try
for a considerable time, since a fragmentary list
which gives the names of the first nine sovereigns
composing it does not come down to the time when
the first of the princes who came into close contact
with Assyria was reigning. Indeed, a considerable
interval must be allowed between the lat~r period
and the last of the nine kings mentioned in the list,
in which to insert the isolated names of more than
one monarch of the dynasty incidentally mentioned
on later monuments. Supposing that not more than
fifteen kings preceded Cara-indas in n.c. 1450, and



ASSYBIAN LITEBATUBB. 19
that the average length of their reigns was twenty
years, we should have B.c. 1750 as the approximate
date of the leader of the dynasty. He could not have
been later than this, and there are many reasons
which would lead us to suppose that he was earlier.
Khammuragas was the leader of the dynasty in
question. He had conquered the rulers of the two
kingdoms into which Babylonia was at this time
divided. One of these was a queen, with whom
ended a dynasty, famous in the a11nals of early Baby
lonia, whose seat was at Agane or Agade, near Seph
arvaim. She had been the successor of Naram-Sin,
the son of Sargon, who, like his father, had extended
his power far and wide, and had even penetrated as
far as the shores of the Mediterranea11. Sargon had
been a great patron of learning as well as a con
queror; he had established a famous library at
Agane, and had caused a work on astronomy and
astrology to be compiled, which remained the standard
authority on the subject up to the end of the Assyrian
Empire. It was entitled," The Illumination of Bel,"
and was in seventy-two books. Berosus, the his
torian, seems to have translated it into Greek.
Like the Babylonia,ns and Assyrians of a later
day, Sargo11 and his subjects belonged to the Semi
tic stock, and were therefore related to the Hebrews
and the Arabians. But they were really intruders
in Chaldea. The "primitive inhabitants of the coun
try, the builders of its cities, the inventors of the
cuneiform syste~ of writing, and the founders of the



20 BABYLONIAN .AND
culture and civilization which was afterwards bor
rowed by the Semites, were of a wholly different race.
They spoke an agglutinative language of the same
character as that of the modern Turks or Finns, and
were originally divided into two sections-the inhabi
tants of Sumir or Shinar, the plain country, and the
Accadians or "Highlanders," who had descended
from the mountains of Elalll subsequently to the
first settlement of their kinsfolk in Shinar. At some
date between B.c. 3000 and 2000, the Semitic popu
lation which bordered upon Babylonia on the west,
and had long. been settled in some of its western
cities, s11ch as Ur (now Mugheir), conquered Shinar
or Sumir. The Accadians, however, maintained
their independence for a considerable time after this
conquest, until, :finally, Accnd also was reduced
under the sway of the Semitic kings. The old
· population of the country was gradually absorbed,
a11d its language became extinct. The extinction of
the Accadian or Sumerian language had already taken
place-at all events among the educated classes-at
the time that Sargon founded his library at Agane,
and one of the chief reasons which led to the compi
lation of the great work on astronomy, was the ne
cessity of preserving the astronomical and astrological
observations recorded in a language which was be
ginning to be forgotten. At the same time Semitic
translations of other portions of ·the old Accadian
literature were made. The library at Agane, how
ever, was not the only place where the work of trans



•
ASSYRIAN LITEBATUBE. 21
lation went on ; many other libraries existed, and
their scribes and readers had alike become Semites,
who required works written in their own tongue.
The Semitic translations of Accadian works which
were made for the library of Erech, one of the earliest
seats of Semitic power, must have been considerably
older than those made for the library of Sargon.
The extinction of the Accadian language and the
t~anslation of Accadian works into Semitic Babylonian
are important facts for settling the chronology of a
document or inscription. Wherever we can show
that a Babylonian or Assyrian text is translated
from an Accadian original, or wherever we have a
copy of that original itself, we may feel pretty sure
that we are dealing with something older than the
eighteenth century before the Christian era.
Mr. Smith believed that the " Exploits of the God
Dibbam " was -one of the oldest of the mythological
texts which have come down to us, though he admitted
that the mention of Assyria in it was in favour of a
somewhat later date.
It notices a large number of peoples or states, the
principal being the people of the coast, Subartu or
Syria, Assyria, Elam, the Kassi, the Sutu, Goim,
Lullubu, and Accad.
The Izdubar legends, containing the story of the
~lood, and possibly also the history of Nimrod, were
probably written in the south of the country, and at
least as early as B.c. 2000. These legends were,
however, traditions before they were committed to



22 BABYLONIAN .AND
writing, and were common in some form to the whole
of Chaldea.
The account of the Creation in days, though pro
bably of late Assyrian origin in its present form, may
nevertheless rest 011 older traditions. At present,
however, it is not possible to assign to it any great
antiquity.
It should, of course, be remembered, that the texts
we possess at present are written in Semitic Baby
lonian or Assyrian-Babylonian and Assyrian being
but slightly varying dialects of the same language.
They are, however, mostly translations of earlier
Accadian documents, and belong to the same period
as that which witnessed the foundation of the library
of Agane. We shall not be far ,vrong, therefore, in
dating them in their present form about B.c. 2000.
The translations then made were copied by successive
generations of librarians and scribes, the latest copies
of which we know being those that have been brought
from the library of Kouyunjik.
To the same early period belonged various other
literary compositions, among which we may particu
larize a long work on terrestrial omens, compiled for
· Sargon of Agane, as well as the syllabaries, gram
mars, phrase-books and vocabularies, and other bilin
gual tablets by means of which a knowledge of the
old language of Accad was conveyed to the Baby
lonian or Assyrian scholar.
On the other hand, a series of tablets on evil
s1Jirits, which contained a totally different tradition



.ASSYBI.AN LITEB.ATUBB. 23
of the Creation from that in days, goes back to the
Accadian epoch; and there is a third account from
the City of Cutha, closely agreeing in some respects
with the account handed down by Berosus, which
must be placed about the same date.
In spite of the indications as to peculiarities of
worship, names of states and capitals, historical allu
sions and other evidence, it may seem hazardous to
many persons to fix the dates of original documents ·
so high, when our only copies in many cases are
Assyrian transcripts made in the reign of Assur
bani-pal, in the seventh century B.c.; but one or two
considerations may show that this is a perfectly rea
sonable view, and no other likely period can be found
for the original composition of the documents unless
we ascend to a greater antiquity. In the first place,
it must be noticed that the Assyrians themselves state
that the documents were copied from ancient Baby
lonian copies, and in some cases state that the old
copies were partly illegible even in t~eir day. Again,
in more than one case there is actual proof of the
.antiquity of a text. We may refer, for example, to
a text an Assyrian copy of part of which is published
in "Cuneiform Inscriptions," vol. ii. plate 54, Nos.
3 & 4. In a collection of tablets discovered by Mr.
Loftus at Senkereh, belonging, according to the
kings mentioned in it, to about B.c. 1600, is part of
an ancient Babylonian copy of this very text, the
Babylonian copy being about one thousand years
older than the Assyrian one.

•
2J. BAB ¥LONI.AN .AND
Similarly a fragment of a Babylonian transcript of
the Deluge tablet has recently been brought from
Babylonia, and serves not only to fill up some of the
breaks in our Assyrian copies, but also to verify the
text of the latter.
It is unfortunate that so many of the documents
embodying the Genesis traditions are in such a sadly
mutilated condition, but there can be no doubt that
future explorations will reveal more perfect copies,
and numerous companion and explanatory texts,
which will one day clear up the difficulties w~ich
now meet us at every "'step of our examination of
them. /
So far as known contemporary inscriptions are
concerned, we cannot consider our present researches
and discoveries as anything like sufficient to give a
fair view of the literature of Assyria and Babylonia;
and however numerous an(l important the Genesis
legends may be, they form but a small portion of the
whole literature of the country.
It is generally considered that the earliest inscrip
tions of any importance ,vhich we now possess belong
to the time of Lig-Bagas, king of Ur, who first
united under his sway the petty kingdoms into
which Chaldea ,vas previously split up, and whose
age is generally assigned to about three thousand
years before the Christian era.
T:μe principal inscriptions of this period consist of
texts on bricks and on signet cylinders, and some of
the latter may be of much greater antiquity. Passing



.ASSYBIAN LITEB.ATUBE. 25
down to a time when the country was again divided
into the kingdoms of Karrak, Larsa, and Agane, we
find a great accession of literary material, almost
every class of writing being represented by con
temporary specimens. Each of the principal cities
had its library, and education seems to have been
widely diffused. From Senkereh, the ancient Larsa,
and its neighbourhood have come our oldest speci
mens of these literary tablets, the follo'\\ring being
some of the contents of this earliest known library:
1. Mythological tablets, including lists of the gods,
and their manifestations and titles.
2. Grammatical works, lists of words, and explana
tions.
3. Mathematical works, calculations, tables of cube
and square roots, and tables of measures.
4. Works on astronomy, astrology, and omens.
5. Legends and short historical inscriptions.
6. Historical cylinders, one of Kudur-mabuk, B.c.
1800 (?) (the earliest known cylinder), being in the
British Museum.
7. Geographical tablets, and lists of towns and
countries.
8. Tablets containing laws and law cases, records
of sale and barter, wills and loans.
Such are the inscriptions a single library of
Babylonia has produced, and beside these there
are numerous texts, only known to us through later
copies, but which certainly had their origin as early
as this period.
•



26 BABYLONIAN .AND
Passing do,vn from this period, for some centuries
we find only detached inscriptions, accompanied by
evidence of the gradual shifting of both political
power and literary activity from Babylonia to
Assyria..
In Assyria the first centre of literature and seat
of a library was the city of Assur (Kileh Shergat),
and the earliest known tablets date about n.c. 1500.
Beyond the scanty records of a few monarchs
nothing of value remains of this library, and the
literary works contained in it are only known from
later copies.
A revival of the Assyrian empire began under
Assur-natsir-pal, king of Assyria, who ascended the
throne B.c. 885. He rebuilt the city of Calah (Nim
roud), and this city became the seat of an Assyrian
library. Tablets were procured from Babylonia by
Shalmaneser, son of Assur-natsir-pal, n.c. 860, during
the reign of Nabu-bal-idina, king of Babylon, and
these ,vere copied by the Assyrian . scribes, and
placed in the royal library. Rimmon-nirari, grand
son of Shalmaneser, B.C. 812, added to the Calah ·
library, and had tablets written at Nineveh. Assur
nirari, n.c. 755, continued the literary work, some
mythological tablets being dated in his reign.
Tiglath Pileser, B.c. 745, enlarged the library, and
placed in it various copies of historical inscriptions.
It was, however, reserved for Sargon, who founded
the last Assyrian dynasty, n.c. 721, to make the
AssJTian royal library worthy of the empire. Early



.ABSYBI.AN LITEB.ATUBE. 27
in his reign he appointed Nabu-zuqub-cinu principal
librarian, and this officer set to work to make new
copies of all the standard works of the day. During
the whole of his term of office copies of the great
literary works were produced, the majority of the
texts preserved belonging to the early period pre
yious to Kharomuragas.
With the accession of Sargon came a revival of
literature in Assyria; education became more general,
ancient texts were brought from Babylonia to be
copied, and the antiquarian study of early literature
became fashionable.
Sennacherib, son of Sargon, B.c. 704, continued to
add to his father's library at Calah, but late in his
reign he removed the collection from that city to
Nineveh (Kouyunjik), where from this time forth
the national library remained until the fall of the
•
empire.
· Esarhaddon, son of Sennacherib, B.c. 681, further
increased the national collection, most of the works
he added being of a religious character.
Assur-bani-pal, son of Esarhaddon, the Sardana
palus of the Greeks, B.c. 670, was the greatest of the
Assyrian sovereigns, and he is far more memorable
on account of his magnificent patronage of learning
than on account of the greatness of his empire or the
extent of his wars.
Assur-bani-pal added more to the Assyrian royal
library than all the kings who had gone before him,
and it is to tablets written in his r~ign that ,ve owe



28 BAB YLONI.AN AND
almost all our knowledge of the Babylonian myths
and early history, beside many other important
matters.
The agents of Assur-bani-pal sought everywhere
for inscribed tablets, brought them to Nineveh, and
copied them there; thus the literary treasures of
Babylon, Borsippa, Cutha, Agane, Ur, Erech, Larsa,
Nipur, and various other cities were transferred to the
Assyrian capital to enrich the great collection there.
The fragments brought over to Europe give us
a good idea of this library and show the range of
the subjects ·embraced by its collection of works.
Among the different classes of texts, the Genesis
stories and similar legends occupied a prominent
place ; these, as they will be further described in the
present volume, need only be mentioned h~re. Ac
companJing them we have a series of mythological
tablets of various sorts, varying from legends of the
gods, psalms, songs, prayers, and .hymns, down to
mere allusions and· lists of names. Many of these
texts take the form of charms to be used in sickness
and· for the expulsion of evil spirits; some of them
are of great antiquity, being older than the Izdubar
legends. One fine series deals with remedies against
witchcraft and the assaults of evil spirits. Izdubar is
mentioned in one of these tablets as lord of the oaths
or pledges of the world.
Some of the prayers were for use on special occa
sions, such as on starting on a campaign, on the
occurrence of an eclipse, &c. Astronomy and astro



.ABSYBIAN LITER.A'l'UBE. 29
logy were represented by various detached inscrip
tions and reports, but principally by the great work
of which mention has already been made, and many
copies of which were in the Library of Assur-bani-pal.
Among the Astrological tablets is a fragment
which professes to be copied from an original of the
time of lzdubar.
Historical texts formed another section of the
library, and these included numerous copies of in
scriptions of early Babylonian kings; there were
besides, chronological tablets with lists ~f kings and
annual officers, inscriptions of various Assyrian
monarchs, histories of the relations between Assyria
and Babylonia, Elam, and Arabia, treaties, des
patches, proclamations, and reports on the state of
the empire and military affairs.
Natural history was represented by bilingual lists
of mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects, and plants,
trees, grasses, reeds, and grains, earths, stones, &c.
These lists are classified according to the supposed
nature and affinities of the various species, and show
considerable advance in the sciences. Mathematics
had a place in the library, there being tables of pro
blems, :figures, and calculations; but this branch of
learning was not studied so fully as in Babylonia.
Grammar and Lexicography were better repre
sented, since there were many works on these sub
jects, including lists of the characters, the declension
of the noun, the conjugation of the verb, examples of
syntactical construction, reading-books, interlinear



80 ABBYBIAN LIT:EBATURE.
translations of Accadian texts, and the like. All
these tablets were copied from Babylonian originals.
·In legal and civil literature the library was also rich,
and the tablets serve to show that the same laws and
customs prevailed in Assyria as in Babylonia. There
are codes of laws, law cases, records of sale, barter,
and loans, lists of property, lists of titles and trades,
of tribute and taxes, &c.
In Geography the Assyrians were not very· ad
vanced; but there are lists of countries and their
productions, of cities, rivers, mountains, and peoples.
Such are some of the principal contents of the
great library from which we have obtained our copies
of the Creation and Flood legends. Most of the
tablets were copied from early Babylonian ones which
have in most cases disappeared; but the copies are
sufficient to show the wonderful progress in culture
and civilization already made by the people of Chaldea
long before the age of Moses or even Abraham.
Babylonian literature, which had been the parent of
Assyrian writing, revived after the fall of Nineveh,
and Nebuchadnezzar and his successors made Babylon
the seat of a library-rivalling that of Assur-bani-pal at
Nineveh. Of this later development of Babylonian
literature we know very little, explorations being still
required to bring to light its texts. A few fragments
only, discovered by wandering Arabs or recovered by
chance travellers, have as yet turned up, but there is
in them evidence enough to promise a rich reward to
,
future excavators.

Berosus, from whom the principal extracts are
copied, lived, as has already been stated, about B.c.
330 to 260, and, from his position as a Babylonian
priest, had the best means of knowing the Babylonian
traditions.
•
The others are later writers, who copied in the
main from Berosus, most of whose notices. may be
taken as mere abridgments of his statements.
EXTRACT I. FROM ALEXANDER PoLYHISTOR
(CORY, P· 56).
Berosus, in the first book of his history of Baby
lonia, informs us that he lived in the age ofAlexander,
the son of Philiil· And he mentions that there
were written accounts, preserved at Babylon with
the greatest care, compreher1ding a period of above
fifteen myriads of years; and that these writings
contained histories of the heaven and of the sea; of
the birth of mankind ; and of the kings, and of the
memorable actions which they had achieved.
And in the first place he describes Babylonia as a
country situated between the Tigris and the Eu
phrates ; that it abounded with wheat, and b·arley,
and ocrus, and sesame ; and that in the lakes were
found the roots called gongre, which are fit for food,
and in respect to nutriment similar to barley. There
were also palm-trees and apples, and a variety of
fruits; fish also and. birds, both those which are
I
merely of flight, and those which frequent the water.

made them distinguish the seeds of the earth, and
sho,ved them how to collect the fruits; in short, he
instructed them in every thing which cot1ld tend to
soften manners and humanize their lives. From that
time, nothing material has been added by way of
improvement to his instructions. And when the
sun had set this being Oannes used to retire again
into the sea, and pass the night in the deep, for he was
amphibious. After this there appeared other animals
like Oannes, of which Berosus proposes to give an
account when he comes to the history of the kings.
Moreover, Oannes wrote concerning the generation
of mankind, of their different ways of life, and of their
civil polity; and the following is the purport of what
he said:
" There was a time in which there existed nothing
but darkness and an abyss of waters, wherein
resided most hideous beings, which were produced
of a two-fold principle. There appeared men, some
of whom were furnished with two wings, others with
four, and with two faces. They had one body, but
two heads ; the one that of a man, the other of a
woman ; they· were likewise in their several organs
both male and female. Other human figures were to
be seen with the legs and horns of a goat; some had
horses' feet, while others united the hind quarters
of a horse with the body of a man, resembling in
shape the hippocentaurs. Bulls likewise were bred
there with the heads of men ; and dogs with fourfold
bodies, terminated in their extremities with the tails

of moisture, and animals being continually generated
therein, the deity above-mentioned (Belus)· cut off
his own head; upon which the other gods mixed the
blood, as it gushed out, with the earth, and from
thence men were formed. On this account it is that
they are rational, and partake of divine knowledge.
This Belus, by whom they signify Hades (Pluto),
divided the darkness, and separated the heavens from
the earth, and reduced the universe to order. But
the recently-created animals, not being able to bear
the prevalence of light, died. Belus upon this,
seeing a vast space unoccupied, though by nature
fruitful, commanded one of the gods to take off his
head, and to mix the blood with the earth, and from
thence to form other men and animals, which should
be capable of bearing the light. Belus formed also ·
the stars, and the sun, and the moon, and the five
planets." (Such, according to Alexander Polyhistor,
is the account which Berosus gives in his first book.)
(In the second book was contained the history of
the ten kings of the Chaldeans, and the periods of
the continuance of each reign, which consisted col
lectively of an hundred and twenty sari, or four
hundred and thirty-two thousand years; reaching to
the time of the Deluge. For Alexander, enumerating
the kings from the writings of the Cha~deans, after
the ninth, Ardates, proceeds to the tenth, who is
called by them Xisuthrus, in this manner) :
,, After the death of Ardates, his son Xisuthrus
reigned eighteen sari. In his time happened the great



OHALDEAN LEGBNDB. 87
deluge ; the history of which is thus described. The
deity Kronos appeared to him in a vision, and
warned him that upon the :fifteenth day of the
month Dresius there would be a flood, by which
mankind would be destroyed. He therefore enjoined
him to write a history of the beginning, progress,
and conclusion of all things, down to the present
term, and to bury it in Sippara, the city of the Sun ;
and to build a vessel, and take with him into it his
friends and relations ; and to convey ·on board every
thing necessary to sustain life, together with all the
different animals, both birds and quadrupeds, and
trust himself fearlessly to the deep. Having asked
the Deity whither he was to sail, he was answered,
'To the Gods ; ' upon which he offered up a prayer
for the good of mankind. He then obeyed the divine
admonition, and built a vessel five stadia in length,
and two in breadth. Into this he put everything
which he had prepared, and last of all conveyed into
it his wife, his children, and his friends.
After the flood had been upon the earth, and was
in time abated, Xisuthrus sent out birds from the
vessel ; which not finding any food, nor any place
whereupon they might rest their feet; returned to
him again. After an interval of some days, he sent
them forth a second time ; and they now returned
with their feet tinged with mud. He made a trial a
third time with these birds ; but they returned to
_him no more : from whence he judged that the sur
face of the earth had appeared above the waters.



88 OHALDE.AN LEGENDS.
He therefore made a11 opening in the vessel, and
upon looking out found that it was stranded upon
the side of some mountain; upon which he imme
diately quitted it with his wife, his daughter, and the
pilot. Xisuthrus then paid his adoration to the
earth : and, having constructed an altar, offered
sacrifices to the gods, and, with those who had come
out of the vessel with him, disappeared.
They who remained within, :finding that their
companions did not return, quitted the vessel with
many lamentations, and called continually on the
name of Xisuthrus. Him they saw no more ; but
they could distinguish his -voice in the air, and could
hear him admonish them to pay due regard to the
gods ; and he likewise informed them that it was
upon account of his piety that he was translated to
live with the gods, and that his wife and daughter and
the pilot had obtained the same honour. To this he
added that they should return to Babylonia, and,
as it was ordained, search for the writings at Sip
para, which they were to make known to all man
kind ; moreover, that the place wherein they then
were was the land of Armenia. The rest having
heard these words offered sacrifices to the gods, and,
taking a circuit, journeyed towards Babylonia.
The vessel being thus stranded in Armenia, some
part of it yet remains in the Gordyrean (or Kurdish)
mountains in Armenia, and the people scrape off the
bitumen with which it had been outwardly coated,
and make use of it by way of an antidote and amulet.

In this manner they returned to Babylon and when
they had found the writings at Sippara they built
cities and erected temples, and Babylon was thus

Chron. v. 8.
BEROSUS, FROM APOLLODORUS (CORY, P· 51).
This is the history which Berosus has transmitted
to us. He tells us that the first king was Alorus of
Babylon, a Chaldean ; he reigned ten sari (36;000
years) ; and afterwards Alaparus and Amelon, who
came from Pantibiblon; then Ammenon the Chal
dean, in whose time appeared the Musarus Oannes,
the Annedotus from the Erythrrean sea. (But
Alexander Polyhistor, anticipating the eve11t, has
said that he appeared in the first year, but Apollo
dorus says that it was· after forty sari; Abydenus,
however, makes the second Annedotus appear after
twenty-six sari.) Then succeeded Megalarus from
the city of Pantibiblon, and he reigned eighteen sari;
and after him Daonus, the shepherd from Panti
biblon, reigned ten sari; in his time (he says)
appeared again from the Erythrrean sea a fourth
Annedotus, having the same form with those above,
the shape of a fish blended with that of a man. Then
reigned Euedorachus (or Euedoreschus) from Panti
biblon for the term of eighteen sari; in his days there
appeared another personage from the _Erythrrean
sea like the former, having the same complicated
form between a fish and a man, whose name was

Odakon. ( All these, says Apollodorus, related
particularly and circumstantially whatever Oannes
had informed them of ; concerning these Abydenus
has made no mention.) Then reigned Amempsinus,
a Chaldean from Larancha; and he being the eighth
in order reigned ten sari. Then reigned Otiartes,1 a
Chaldean, from Larancha; and he ruled eight sari.
And, upon the death of Otiartes, his son Xisuthrus
reigned eighteen sari; in his time happened the great
Deluge. So that the sum of all the kings is ten; and
the term which they collectively reigned an hundred
and twenty sari.-Syncel. Citron. xxxix.; Euseb. Ch,..on. v.

It is said that the first king of the country was
Alorus, and that he gave out a report that God had

in form to Oannes ; after Amillarus reigned Am

eighteen sari; then Daos the shepherd governed for
the space of ten sari, he was of Pantibiblon; in his
time four double-shaped personages came up out
of the sea to land, whose names were Euedokus,
Eneugamus, Eneubulus, and Anementus ; after
wards in the time of Euedoreschus appeared another,
Anodaphus. After these reigned other kings, and
last of all Sisithrus, so that in all the number
amounted to ten kings, and the term of their reigns

city of the sun. Sisithrus, when he had complied
with these commands, sailed immediately to Armenia,
and was presently inspired by God. Upon the third

birds by way of experiment, that he might judge
whether the flood had subsided. But the birds,.

They say that the first inhabitants of the earth,
glory1ing in their own strength and size and despising
the gods, undertook to build a tower whose top
should reach the sky, in the place where Babylon
now stands; but when it approached the heaven the
winds assisted the gods, and overturned the work
upon its contrivers, and its ruins are said to be
still at Babylon ; and the gods introduced a diversity
of tongues among men, who till that time had all
spoken the same language; and a war arose between
Kronos and Titan. The place in which they built
the tower is now called Babylon on account of the
confusion of tongues, for confusion is by the He

46 BABYLONIAN MYTHOLOGY.
Babylonian mythology was local in origin; each
of the gods had a particular city which was. the spe
cial seat of his worship, and it is probable that the
idea of weaving the gods into a system, in which each
should have his part to play, did not arise until after
the Semitic occupation of the country. The antiquity
of this systematized mythology may, however, be
seen from the fact, that two thousand years before
the Christian era it was already completed, and its
deities definitely connected into a system which re
mained with little change down to the close of the
kingdom.
In early times the gods were worshipped only at
their original cities or seats, the various cities or
settlements being independent of each other; but it
was natural as wars arose, and some cities gained
conquests over others, and kings gradually united the
country into monarchies, that the conquerors should
impose their gods upon the conquered. Thus arose
the system of different ranks or grades among the
gods. Colonies, again, were sent out at times, and
the colonies, as they considered themselves sons of
the cities they started from, also considered their gods
to be sons of the gods of the mother cities. Political
.changes in early times led to the rise and fall of va
rious towns and consequently of their deities, and
gave rise to numerous myths relating to the different
personages in the mythology. In some rem.ote age
there appear to have been three great cities in the
country, Erech, Eridu, and Nipur, and their divi



BABYLONIAN MYTHOLOGY. 47
nities Ann, Hea, and Bel were considered the" great
gods " of the country. Subsequent changes led to
the decline of these states, but their deities still
re~ed their position to the end of the Babylonian
system.
These three leading deities formed memhers of a
circle of twelve gods, also called " great." These
gods and their titles are given as :
1. Anu, meaning '' the sky " in Accadian, king of
angels and spirits, lord of the city of Erech.
2. Bel, Elum or Mui in Accadian, lord of the lower
world, father of the gods, creator, lord of the city of
Nipur.
3. Hea, "god of the house of water," maker of
fate, lord of the deep, god of wisdom and knowledge,
lord of the city of Eridu.
4. Sin, the Moon-god, Acu or Agu in Accadian, lord
of crowns, maker of brightness, lord of the city of Ur.
5. Merodach, "the glory of the Sun," just prince
of the gods, lord of birth, lord of the city of Babylon.
6. Rimmon, the Air-god, Mirmir in Accadian, the
strong god, lord of canals and atmosphere, lord of the
city of Muru.
7. Samas, the Sun-god, Utuci in Accadian, judge
of heaven and earth, director of all, lord of the cities
of Larsa and Sippara.
8. Ninip, warrior of the gods, destroyer of the
wicked, lord of the city of Nipur.
9. Nergal, "illuminator of the great city" (Hades),
giant king of war, lord of the city of Cutha.



48- BABYLONIAN MYTHOLOGY.
10. Nusku, holder ofthe golden sceptre, the loftygod.
11. Belat, wife of Bel, mother of the great gods,
lady of the city of Nipur.
12. Istar, Gingir in Accadian, eldest of heaven and
earth, raising the face of warriors.
Below these deities there was a large body of gods
forming the bulk of the pantheon, and below these
were arranged the Igigi, or 300 angels of heaven, and
the Anunnaki, or 600 angels of earth. Below these
again came various classes of spirits or genii called
Sedu, Vadukku, Ekimu, Gallu, and others; some of
these were evil, some good.
The relationship of the various principal gods and
their names, titles, and offices will appear from the
following remarks.
At the head of the Babylonian mythology stands a
deity who was sometimes identified with the heavens,
sometimes considered as the ruler and god of heaven.
This deity is named Anu, his sign is the simple star,
the symbol of divinity, and at other times the Maltese
cross. In the philosophic theology of a later age,
Anu represents abstract divinity, and he appears
as an original principle, perhaps as the original
principle of nature. He represents the universe. as
the upper and lower regions, and when these were
divided the upper region or heaven was called Anu,
while the lower region or .earth was called Ana.tu;
Anatu being the female principle or wife of Anu.
Anu is termed the old god, and the god of the whole
of heaven and earth ; one of the manifestations of



BABYLONIAN MYTHOLOGY. 4'9
Anu was under the two forms Lakhmu and Lakhamu,
which probably correspond to the Greek forms Dache
and Dachus, see p. 44.1 These forms are said to have
sprung out of the original chaos, and they are fol
lowed by the two forms Sar and Kisar (the Kissare
and Assorus of the Greeks). Sar means the upper
hosts or expanse, Kisar the lower hosts or expanse;
these are also forms or manifestations of Anu and his
wife. Ann is further called lord of the old city, and
bears the name of Alalu. His titles generally indi
cate height, antiquity, purity, divinity, and he may
be taken as tl1e general type of divinity. Anu
was originally worshipped at the cit}' of Erech,
which was called the city of Ann and Anatu, and the
great temple there was called the "house of Ann,"
or the '' house of heaven."
Anatu, the wife or consort of Ann, is generally only
a female form of Ann, but is sometimes contrasted
,vith him ; thus, when Anu represents height and
.
heaven, Anatu represents depth and earth; she is
also the lady of darkness, the mother of the god Hea,
the mother of heaven and earth, the female fish-god,
and is often identified ,vith Istar or Venus. Anatu,
however, had no existence in Accaclian mythology.
She is the product of the imagination of the Semites,
whose grammar drew a distinction between the
masculine and feminine genders.
1 Though Lakhmu properly represented Anu or Anatu, he sometimes
takes the place of the Solar hero Ninip as husband of Gula, "the
great " goddess.
E



50 BABYLONIAN MYTHOLOGY.
Anu and Anatu had a numerous family; among
their sons are numbered Lugal-edin, "the king of the
desert," Latarak, Ab-gula, Kusu, and the air-god,
whose name was Ra.rnmQll or Rimmon, in Accadian
Mirmir. Rimmon is god of the region of the atmo
sphere, or space be~ween the heaven and earth, he is
I
the god of rain, of storms and whirlwind, of thunder
and lightning, of floods and watercourses. He was
in high esteem in Syria and Arabia, where he bore the
name of Dadda; in Armenia he was called Teiseba.
·Rimmon is always considered an active deity, and was
extensively worshipped.
Another important god, a son of Ann, was the god of
:fire, whose name was Gibil in Accadian. The :fire-god
takes an active part in the numerous mythological tab
lets and legends, and is considered to be the most potent
deity in relation to witchcraft and spells generally.
The most important of the daughters of Anu was
named Istar; she was in so~e respects the equivalent
of the classical Venus. Her worship was at :first sub
ordinate to that of Ana, and as she was goddess of
love, while Anu was god of heaven, it is probable
that the :first intention in the mythology was only to
represent love as heaven-born ; but in time a more
sensual view prevailed, and the worship of Istar
became one of the darkest features in Babylonian
mythology. As the worship of this goddess increased
in favour, it gradually superseded that of Anu, until
in time his temple, the house of heaven, came to be
regarded as the temple of Venus.
'



BABYLONIAN MYTHOLOGY. 51
The planet Venus, as the ev~ning star, was iden
tified with the !star of Erech, while the morning
star was Anunit, goddess of Agane.
!star, however, was worshipped under a great
variety of forms. Each city, each state, had its own
special !star and its own special worship of her. In
the syncretic age of BabyIonian theology, these
various forms and modes of worship were amalga
mated together, and epithets of the goddess which
were originally peculiar to particular localities, were
applied to the single goddess of the state religion.
Thus, according to the legends of one part of Baby..
Ionia, Istar was the daughter of the Moon-god,
according to those of another part of the country she
was the daughter of Ann. Hence in tlie mythology of
a later period she appears sometimes as the daughter
of the one deity, sometimes as the daughter of the
other.
A companion deity with Anu .is Hea, who is god
of the sea and of Hades, in fact of all the lower re
gions. In some of his attributes he answers to the
Kronos of the Greeks, in others to their Poseidon.
Hea is called god of the lower region, he is lord of
the sea or abyss ; he is also lord of generation and
of all human beings, and bears the titles : lord of
wisdom, of mines and treasures ; of gifts, of music,
of fishermen and sailors, and of Hades or hell. It
has been supposed that the serpent was one of
his emblems, and that he was the Oannes of Berosus;
but these conjectures have not yet been proved.



32 BABYLONIAN MYTHOLOGY.
The wife of Hea was Dav-kina, the Davke of
Damascius, who is the goddess of the lower re
gions, the consort of the deep ; and their principal
son was Maruduk or Merodach, the Bel of later
times.
Merodach, god of Babylon, appears in all the
earlier inscriptions as the agent of his father Hea ;
he goes about the world collecting i11formation, and
receives commissions from his father to set right all
that appears wrong. He is called the redeemer of
mankind, the restorer to life, a11d the raiser from the
dead. He is an active agent in creation, but is
always subordinate to his father Hea. In later
times, after Babylon had been made the capital,
Merodach, who was god of that city, was raised to
the head of the Pantheon. Merodach afterwards
came to be identified with the classical Jupiter, but
the name Bel, "the lord," was only given to him in
times subsequent to the rise of Babylon, when the
worship of the older Bel, the Accadian Elum, was
falling into decay. The wife of Merodach was Zirat
panit, perhaps the Succoth Benoth of the Bible. Be
sides Merodach, Hea had a numerous progeny, his
sons being principally river-gods.
Nebo, the god of knowledge and literature, who
was worshipped at the neighbouring city of Borsippa,
was a favourite deity in later times, as was also his
consort Tasmit "the Hearer." Nebo, whose name
signifies "the prophet," was called Timkhir in Ac
cadian, and had his temple iI1 the island of Dilvun,



BABYLONIAN MYTHOLOGY. 53
called "the island of the gods" by the Accadians,
now Bahrein. Here he was worshipped under the
name of Enzak.
A third great god was united with Ann and Hea,
named Enu, Mui, and Elum in Accadian, and Bel in
Semitic Babylonian ; he was the original Bel of the
Babylonian mythology, and was lord of the surface
of the earth and the affairs of men. Elum was lord
of the city of Nipur, and in the Semitic period ha'1 a
consort named Belat or Beltis. He was held to be
the most active of the gods in the general affairs of
mankind, and was so generally wQrshipped in early
times that he came to be regarded as the national
divinity, and his temple at the city of Nipur was
regarded as the type of all others. The extensive
worship of Bel, and the high honour in which ·he
was held, seem to point to a time when his city,
Nipur, was the metropolis of the country.
Belat, or Beltis, the wife of Bel, is a famous deity
celebrated in all ages, but as the title Belat only
signified "lady," or" goddess," it was a common one
for many goddesses, and the notices of Beltis pro
bably refer to several different personages.
Bel had, like the other gods, a numerous family; his
eldest son was the moon-god, called Agu or Acu in
Accadian, in later times generally termed Sin. Sin
was presiding deity of the city of Ur, and early
assumed an important place in the mythology. The
moon-god :figures prominently in some early legends,
and during the time when the city of Ur was capital



t,4 BABYLONIAN MYTHOLOGY.
of the country his worship became very widely-spread
and popular throughout the country.
Ninip, god of hunting and war, was another cele
brated son of Bel ; he was wors~pped with his father
at Nipur. Ninip was also much worshipped in
Assyria as well as Babylonia, his character as pre
siding genius of war and the chase making him a
favourite deity with the warlike kings of Assyria.
Originally he was a form of the sun-god.
Sin the moon-god had a son Samas, the sun-god.
Samas is an active deity in some of the lzdubar
legends and fables, but he is generally. subor~inate
to Sin. In the Babylonian system the moon takes
precedence of the sun, as befitted a nation of
astronomers, and the Samas of Larsa was pro
bably considered a different deity from Samas of
Sippara.
Among the other deities of the Babylonians may
be counted Nergal, god of Cutha, who, like Ninip,
presided over hunting and war, and Anunit, the
goddess of one of the quarters of Sippara, and of
the city of Agane.
The following table will exhibit the relationship of
the principal deities as it had been drawn up by the
native writers on the cosmogony ; but it must be
noted that it belongs to a late age of syncretic philo
sophy, when the scholars of Assur-bani-pal's court
were endeavouring to resolve the old deities of
Accad into mere abstractions, and so explain the
myths which described the creation of the w~rld.

day Sabbath, and excavations in Babylonia may yet
bring to light the early Chaldean form of the legend.
But this we do not at present possess.
So far as the fragments can be arranged, they seem
to observe the following order :
1. Part of the first tablet, giving an account of the
Chaos and the generation of the gods.
2. Fragment of subsequent tablet, perhaps the
second on the foundation of the deep.
3. Fragment of tablet placed here with great
doubt, possibly referring to the creation of land.
·4. Part of the fifth tablet, recording the creation of
the heavenly bodies.
5. Fragment of the seventh? tablet, recording the
creation of land animals.
These fragments indicate that the series included
at least seven tablets, the writing on each tablet
being in one- column on the ~ront and back, and
probably including over one hundred lines of text.
The first fragment in the story is the upper part
of the first tablet, giving the description of the void
or chaos, and part of the generation of the gods.
The translation is as follows :
1. At that time above, the heaven was unnamed:
2. below the earth by name was unrecorded ;
3. the boundless deep also (was) their generator.
4. The chaos of the sea was she who bore the whole
of them.
5. Their waters were collected together in one
place, and



58 BABYLONIAN LEGEND
6. the flowering reed was not gathered, the marsh
plant was not grown.
7. At that time the gods had not been produced,
any one of them;
8. By name they had.not been called, destiny was
not fixed.
9. Were ·made also the (great) gods,
·10. the gods Lakhmu and Lakhamu were pro
duced (the first), and
11. to growth they . • . . . . . .
12. the gods Sar and Kisar were made next.
13. The days were long; a long (time passed),
(and)
14. the gods Anu (Bel and Hea were born of)
15. the gods Sar and (Kisar). . . . . • .
On the reverse of this tablet there are only frag
ments of the eight lines of colophon, but the restora
tion of the passage is easy ; it reads :
1. First tablet of '' At that time above" (name of
Creation series).
2. Palace of Assur-bani-pal king of nations, king
of Assyria,
3. to whom Nebo and Tasmit gave broad ears

as much as is suitable,

8. on tablets I wrote, I engraved, I explained,
and
9. for the inspection of my people within my
palace I placed.
This colophon will serve to show the value attached
to the documents, and the date of the present copies.
The fragment of the obverse, broken as it is, is
precious as giving the description of the chaos or
desolate void before the Creation of the world, and
the first movement of creation. This corresponds
with the first two verses of the first chapter of
Genesis.
1. " In the beginning God created the heaven and
the earth.
2. And the earth was witho11t form and void; and
darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the
spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
On comparing the fragment of the first tablet of
the Creation with the extract from Damascius, we
do not find any statement as to there being two prin
ciples at first called Tauthe and Apason, and these·
producing Moymis, but in the Creation tablet the
first existence is called Mummu Tiamatu, a name
meaning " the ch~os of the deep." The compound
Mummu Tiamatu, in fact, combines the two names
Moymis and Tauthe of Damascius. Tiamatu must
also be the same as the Thalatth of Berosus, which
we are expressly told was the sea. It should, there
fore, be corrected to Thavatth, as M. Lenormant pro
posed- some years ago. It is evident that, according
..



·uo BABYLONIAN LEG:,ffND
to. the notion of the Babylonians, the .sea was the
origin of all things, and this also agrees with the
statement of Genesis i. 2. where the chaotic waters
are called t~hom, "the deep," the same word as the
Tiamat of the Creation text and the Tauthe of
Damascius.
The Assyrian word Mumniu is probably connected
with the Hebrew mehamah, confusion, its Accadian
equivalent being Umun. Besides the name of the
chaotic deep called teh8m in Genesis, which is, as has
been said, evidently the Tiamat of the Creation text,
we have in Genesis the word tohu, waste, desolate, or
formless, applied to this chaos. The correspondence
between the inscription and Genesis is complete, since
both state that a watery chaos preceded the creation,
and formed, in fact, the origin and groundwork of the
universe. We have here not only an agreement in
sense, but, what is rarer, the same word used in both
narratives as the name of this chaos, and given also
in the account of Damascius.
Next we have in the inscription the creation of the
gods Lakhmu and Lakhamu ; these are male and fe
male personifications of motion and production, and
correspond to the Dache and Dachus of Damascius, and
the moving ruakh, the wind, or spirit of Genesis. The
next stage in the creationwas the production of Sarand
Kisar, representing the upper expanse and the lower
expanse, and corresponding with the Assorus and Kis
sare of Damascius. The resemblance in these names
is probably even closer than is here represented, since



OF THE OBEATION. 61
Sar is generally read Assur as a deity in later times,
being an ordinary symbol for the supreme god of the
Assyrians.
So far as can be made out from the mutilated text,
the next step in the creation of the universe was (as
in Damascius) the generation of the three great gods,
Anu, Elum, and Hea, the Anus, Illinus, and Aus of
that writer. Anu here symbolizes the heaven, Elum
the earth, and Hea the sea.
It is probable that the inscription went on to relate
the generation of the other gods, and then passed to
the successive acts of creation by which the world
was fashioned.
The successive forms Lakhmu and Lakhamu, Sar
and Kisar, are represented in some of the lists of the
gods as names or manifestations of Ann and Anatu.
· These lists were compiled at a time when a school of
monotheists had risen in Chaldea, and an attempt was
made on the part of its adherents to resolve the va
rious deities of the popular creed into forms of '' the
one god " Ann. In each ca~e there appears to be a
male and female principle, which principles combine
in the formation of the universe.
As has been already remarked, the conception of a
male and female principle was due to the Semites.
Hence it is clear that the system of cosmology em
bodied in these Creation tablets was of Semitic and
not Accadian origin.
The resemblance between the extract from Da
mascius and the account in the Creation tablet as to



•
62 BAB YLONI.AN LEGEND
the successive ~tages or forms of the Creation, is
striking, and leaves no doubt about the source of the
quotation from the Greek writer.
The three next tablets in the Creation series are
absent, there being only two doubtful fragments of
this part of the story. Judging from the analogy of
the Book of Genesis, we may conjecture that this part
of the narrative contained the description of the
creation of light, of the atmosphere or :firmament, of
the dry land, and of plants. One fragment which pro
bably belonged to this space is a small portion of the
top of a tablet referring to the fixing of the dry land ;
but it may belong to a later part of the story, since it is
part of a speech to one of the gods. This fragment

This fragment is both mutilated and obscure, and
it is more than doubtful whether it has anything to
do with the Creation tablets. It seems rather to be
a local legend relating to Assur, the old capital of
Assyria, and possibly recording the legend of its
foundation. Bit-Sarra or E-Sarra, "the temple of
the legions," was dedicated to Ninip, and forms part of
the name of Tiglath-Pileser (Tuculti-pal-esara " Ser

to have denoted the. firmament, the "legions'' or
" hosts " referring to the multitudinous spirits of
heaven. The Biblical expression " the Lord of hosts "
may be compnred.
The next recognizable portion of the Creation
legends is the upper part of the fifth tablet, which
gives the creation of the heavenly bodies, and runs
parallel to the account of the fourth day of creation
in Genesis.
This tablet opens as follows :

All that is left of the reverse is the latter half of the

runs thus:
. . . . . the gods on his hearing.
Fifth tablet of (the series beginning) At that time
above.
Property of Assur-bani-pal king of nations king of
Assyria.
This fine fragment is a typical specimen of the
style of the whole series, and shows a marked stage
in the Creation, the appointment of the heavenly orbs.
It parallels the fourth day of Creation in the first
chapter of Genesis, where we read : " And God said,
Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to
divide the day from the night; and let them be for
lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the
day from the night; and let them be for signs, and
for seasons, and for days, and years:
" 15. And let them be for lights in the firmament of
the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
'' 16. And God made two great lights; the greater
light to r~le the day, and the lesser light to rule the
night ; he made the stars also.
'' 17. And God set them in the firmament of the
heaven to give light upon the earth,
"18. And to rule over the day and over the night,
and to divide the light from the darkness : and God
saw that it was good.



OF THE OBE.ATION. 67
" 19. And the evening an~ morning were the fourth day."
The fragment of the first tablet of the Creation
series .was introductory, and dealt with the genera
tion of the gods rather than the creation of the uni
verse, and when we remember that the fifth tablet
contains the Creation given in Genesis under the
fourth day, while a subsequent tablet, probably the
seventh, gives the creation of the animals which, ac
cording to Genesis, took place on the sixth day, it
would seem that the events of each of the days of
Genesis were recorded on a separate tablet, and that
the numbers of the tablets generally followed in the
same order as the days of Creation in Genesis, thus:
Genesis, Chap I.
V. 1 & 2 agree with Tablet 1.
V. 3 to 5 1st day probably with tablet 2.
V. 6 to 8 2nd day .probably with tablet 3.
V. 9 to 13 3rd day probably with tablet 4.
V. 14 to 19 4th day agree with tablet 5.
V. 20 to 23 5th day probably with tablet 6..
V. 24 & 25 6th day probably with tablet 7.
V. 26 and following, 6th and 7th day, probably
with tablet 8.
The assertion with which the fifth tablet begins
may be compared with the oft-repeated statement of
Genesis, after each act of creative power, that "God
saw that it was good." In fact, the difference be
tween the expressions used by the Hebrew and
Assyrian writers seems greater than it really is, since
•



68 BABYLONIAN LEGEND
the word rendered "to make suitable " comes from a
root which signifies "pleasant" or "agreeable." It
may be noted that the word yuaddi " he arranged "
or '' appointed '' in the third line has the same root as
the Hebrew maadhim, which is used in the same con
nection Gen. i. 14 in the sense of" seasons."
We next come to the creation of the heavenly orbs,
and just as the book of Genesis says they were set
for signs and seasons, for days and years, so the in
scription describes that the stars were set in courses
to define the year. The twelve constellations or
signs of the zodiac, and two other bands of constella
tions are referred to, corresponding with the two sets
of twelve stars, one to the north and the other to the
so0:th of the zodiac, which according to Diodorus
Siculus played a prominent part in Babylonian astro
nomy.
The god Nibiru appears in the astronomical tablets
as one of the stars. Here, however, in the account
of the Creation, he seems to be the deity who
specially presided over the signs of the zodiac and
the course of the year, and in a hymn to the Creator,
which will be translated further on, he takes the
place of the classical Fate, and determines the laws
of the universe generally, and of the stars in par
ticular. It is evident, from the opening of the in
scription on the first tablet of the great Chaldean
work on astrology and astronomy, that the functions
of the stars were according to the Babylonians to act
not only as regulators of the seasons and the year,



OF THE OBEATION. 69
but to be also used as signs, as in Genesis i. 14,
for in those ages it was generally believed that
the heavenly bodies gave, by their appearance and
positions, signs of events which were coming on the
earth.
The passage given in the eighth line of the inscrip
tion, to the effect that the God who created the stars
fixed places or habitations for Bel and Hea with him
self in the heavens, points to the fact that Ann, god
of the heavens, was considered to be the creator of
the heavenly hosts; for it is he who shares with Bel
and Hea the divisions of the face of the sky, which
was divided into three zones. Summer was the
season of Bel, autumn of Anu, and winter of Hea,
the season of spring not being recognized by the
Babylonians. The new moon also was called Anu
for the first five days, Hea for the next five, and Bel
for the third.
The ninth line of the tablet gives us an insight
into the philosophical beliefs of the early Babylo
nians. They evidently considered that the world
was drawn together out of ..the waters, and rested or
reposed upon a vast abyss of chaotic ocean which
filled the space below the world. This dark infernal
lake was shut in by gigantic gates and strong fasten
ings, which prevented the floods from overwhelming
the world. In the centre was a staircase which led
from the abyss below to the region of light above.
The account then goes on to describe the creation
of the moon for the purpose of beautifying the night



70 BABYLONIAN LEGEND
and regulating the calendar. The phases of the
moon are recorded : its commencing as a thin cres
cent at evening on the first day of the month, and
its gradually increasing and travelling further into
the night. It will be noticed that it is regarded as
appointed, in the language of the Bible, "to divide
the day &om the night,'' and to be for a sign and
a season. The expression "judge judgment" may
be compared with the expression of Genesis (i. 18.)
that the sun and moon were set '' to rule over the
day and over the night." An account of the creation
of the sun probably followed upon that of the creation
of the moon.
The creation of the moon, however, is placed first
in accordance with the general views of the Babylo
nians, who, as was natural in a people of astro
nomers, honoured the moon above the sun, even
making the sun-god the son of the moon-god.
The details of the creation of the planets and
stars, which would have been very important to us,
are unfortunately lost, no further fragment of this
tablet having been recovered.
The colophon at the close of the tablet gives us,
however, part of the first line of the sixth tablet, but
not enough to determine its subject. It is probable
that this dealt with the creation of creatures of the
water and fowls of the air, and that these were the
creation of Bel, the companion deity to Anu.
.
The next tablet, the seventh in the series, is pro
bably represented by a curious fragment, which was



.
01' THE OBEATION. 71
f~und by Mr. Smith in one of the trenches at Kou
yunjik.
This fragment is like some of the others, the upper
portion of a tablet much broken, and only valuable
from its generally clear meaning. The translation is
as follows:
1. At that time the gods in their assembly created
•••••
2. They made suitable the strong monsters .....
3. They caused to come living creatures . . . . .
4. cattle of the field, beasts of the field, and creep
ing things of the field . . . . .
5. They fixed for the living creatures • • . . .
6. . . . . . cattle and creeping things of the city

noble face) joined the two together . . . . .
10. . . . . . to the assembly of the creeping things
I gave life . . . . .
11. . . . . . the seed of Lakhamu I destroyed .• ....
This tablet corresponds with the six.th day of Crea
tion in Genesis (i. 24-25) : "And God said, Let the
earth bring forth the living creature after his kind,
cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after
his kind : and it was so.
" And God made the beast of the earth after his
.
•



72 B.A.BYLONI.AN LBGBND
kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw
that it was good.''
The Assyrian tablet commences with a statement
of the satisfaction a former creation, apparently that
of the monsters or whales, had given; here referring
to Genesis i. 23. It then goes on to relate the creation
of living animals on land, three kinds being distin
guished, exactly agreeing with the Genesis account,
and then we have in the ninth line a curious reference
to the god Nin-si-ku (one of the names of Rea). One
of Hea's titles was "the lord of mankind," and Sir
Henry Rawlinsonhasendeavoured to show that Eridu,
the city of Hea, was identical with the Biblical Garden
of Eden. We may here notice a tablet which refers
to the creation of man. In this tablet, K 63, the crea
tion of the human race is given to Hea, and all the
references in other inscriptions make this his work.
As in Genesis, so in these cuneiform tablets the Creator
is made to speak and to address the objects which he
calls into existence.
The next fragment was supposed by Mr. Smith to
relate to the fall of man and to contain the speech of
the deity to the newly-created pair. This, however,
is extremely doubtful, as will appear from the revised
translation below. The fragment is in so broken a
condition that almost anything may be made out of
it. It is possible that nothing more is intended by it
than instructions as to the construction of an image
of a household god or spirit and the correct mode of
worshipping it.

The next fragment is a small one; it is the lower
corner of a tablet with the ends of a few lines. Mr.
Smith connected it with the legend of the fall of man,
but the mention of the god Sar-tuli-elli, " the king of
the illustrious mound," would rather indicate tliat it
has to do with the story of the Tower of Babel. As,
however, the fragment is too small and mutilated to
decide the question, it has been allowed to remain in
the place assigned to it by Mr. Smith, and not trans
ferred to a later chapter.
According to Sir H. Rawlinson, "the holy mound ''
is now represented by the ruins of Amran. At any
rate, it stood on the site of the Tower of Babel and
was dedicated to the god Ann. Along with the ad
joining buildings, among which are to be numbered
the royal palace and the famous hanging garde11s, it
formed a particular quarter of Babylon, enclosed
within its own wall and known under the name of

Su-Anna, the "Valley of Anu," which Sir H. Rawlin•
son proposes to read Khalanne, and identify with the
Calneh of the Old Testament. In support of his

perfect state in which the text ofit has been preserved,
and the consequent obscurity of its reference and
meaning. Dr. Oppert has shown that it really contains
a hymn to the Creator Hea. Before the commence
ment of lines 1, 5, 11, 19, 27, and 29 on the obverse,
there are glosses stating that the divine titles com

the monotheistic party among the ancient Baby
lonians, and that the speech of Hea in lines 14 to 19
has been inserted by a poet who did not belong to it.
The various deities of the popular faith are all re
solved into the one supreme God, the maker of the
world and man, who was worshipped at Babylon
under the names of B_el, "the Lord," and Merodach
the sun-god, at Eridu under that of Hea and at
Nipur under that of Anu. The gods of the multi
tude are said to be only the fifty names of the
Creator. To him is ascribed the regulation of the
stars, the naming of the angels, and the subjection of
the subordinate demi-gods, and marginal notes
expressly state that the several titles under which
the Creator is addressed on the obverse of the tablets,
all belong to one and the same divinity.
In the popular mythology the part of the -Creator
was usually assigned to lferodach. Thus we find
the latter deity addressed as follows in a mutilated
bilingual hymn (K 2962 Obv.) :
1. [King] of the land, lord of the world,
2. . . . protector of heaven and earth,
3. firstborn of the god Hea,
4. the restorer of heaven and earth,
5. . . . mighty lord of mankind, king of the
world.
6. . . . the god of gods,
7. (lord) of heaven and earth, who hast no equal,
8. companion of Ann and Bel,
9. the merciful one among the gods,



OF THE OBEATION. 81
10. the merciful who raisest the dead to life,
11. Merodach, the king of heaven and earth,
12. the ki11g of Babylon, the lord of Bit-Saggil,
13. the king of Bit-Zida, the lord of the mighty
temple of life,
14. heaven and earth are thine,
15. the circuit of heaveu and earth is thine,
16. the charm (to produce) life is thine,
17. the philtre of life is thine,
18. the Illustrious King, the mouth of the Abyss,
is thine ;
19. mankind, (even) the men with the black heads,
20. living creatures, as many as are called by a
name, as exist in the land,
21. the four quarters· of the world, as many as
there are,
22. the angels of the hosts of heaven and earth, as
many as there.are, (are thine).
In these references to the names of the living
creatures made by the Creator at the beginning of
the world, we are irresistibly reminded of the passage
in Genesis ii. 19., where we read that '' out of the
ground God formed every beast of the field and
every fowl of the air ; and brought them to Adam
to see what he would call them : and whatsoever
Adam called every living creature, that was the
name thereof."
One of the most curious statements made in these·
hymns is that the race of men created by the deity
was black-headed. The same race of men is men-.
G
\



82 B.AB YLONI.AN LEGEND
tioned elsewhere in the ancient literature of the
Accadians. Thus in a hymn to the goddess Gula,
the goddess is described as " the mother who bore
the men of the black heads," and in another hymn
the sun-god is declared to "direct the men of the
black heads." Sargon of Agane is further described
as ruling over '' all the men of the black heads," and
in imitation of this mode of expression Sennacherib
in later days speaks of having overcome "all the
black-headed race." The black-headed race of Sen
nacherib, however, was the Turanian population of
Elam and the adjoining districts on the east of Baby
lonia, whereas it is plain that the Accadian hymns
mean by the black-headed race the Accadian people
itself. It was over them that Sargon-of Agane, the
Semite, boasts of having extended his sway, though
according to an old geographical list it was Sumer or
Shinar rather than •Accad, which was inhabited by.
the people of "the black-face.'' But after all there
is no contradiction between the statements of Sen
nacherib and of the hymns. The Accadians be
longed to the same race as the Turanian inhabitants
of Elam, and spoke a similar language to theirs.
Now we shall find in the account of the exploits of
Dibbara, which will be translated in a subsequent
chapter, that the black race, which is identified with
the Accadians, is contrasted with the people of Syria,
while in the bilingual tablets, the black race is simi
larly contrasted with the white race. Bence it is
clear that the white race was the same as the Syrians,



OF THE OBFJATION. 88
and since the Syrians were Semites, the white race
must have been synonymous in the language ofthe Ac
cadians with Semitic. As a matter of fact, the ~e
mites belong to the white-skinned division of man
kind, and were accordingly painted yellow by the
Egyptians. The Accadian population, on the other
hand, belonged to the dark-skinned division, though
it is not necessary to suppose them to have been as
black as the negro or the'' blameless Ethiopian." In
the bilingual tablets, the black race is rendered in
Assyrian by the word Adamatu or "red-skins."
A popular etymology connected this word Ada
1natu with the word Adamu or admu, "man," partly
on account of the similarity of sound, partly because
in the age of Accadian supremacy and literature, the
men par er£cellence, the special human beings -made by
the Creator, were the dark-s~nned race of Accad.
The Accadian Adam or " man " was dark; it was only
when the culture of the Accadians had been handed
on to their Semitic successors that he became fair.
The discovery that the Biblical Adam is identical
with the Assyrian Adamu or '' man," and that the
Assyrian Adamu goes back to the first-created man
of Accadian tradition who belonged to the black, that
is, to the Accadian race, is due to Sir Henry Rawlin
son. He has also suggested that the contrast between
the black and the white races, between the Accadian
and the Semite, is indicated in the sixth chapter of
Genesis, where a contrast is drawn between the daugh
ters of men, or Adamu, and the sons of God. It was



84 B.ABYLONI.AN LEGEND
owing to the intermarriage ofthe sons of God with the
Adamites that the evils were spread which brought
down upon the world the punishment· of the Deluge.
It WBB Sir Henry Rawlinson who further pointed
out that the Biblical GA.n Eden, or" Garden of Eden,"
is Gan-Duniyas. (also called Gun-duni), a name under
which Babylonia is frequently known in the Assyrian
inscriptions. Gan-Duniyas signifies "the enclosure"
or '' fortress of the god Duniyas," a deity whose na
ture and attributes are ·still obscure, and who may have
been merely a deified monarch of the country. Two
of the four rivers of Paradise are the two great rivers
that enclose the fruitful plain of Babylonia, the Tigris,
and the Euphrates. The Euphrates was called Pur
rat, or '' the curving water" in Accadian from its
shape ; the Tigris was known under the name of
Masgugar, '' the current," Tiggar, and Idikna or
Idikla, from the latter of which comes the Hiddekhel
of Genesis, with prefixed Accadian hid, "river."
Gihon is identified with the Arakhtu or Araxes, " the
river of Babylon,'' which flowed westward into the
desert of Arabia or Cush, though Sir H. Rawlinson
suggests its identity with the modern Jukha, which
runs past the site of Eridu, while Sargon calls Elam
the country of "the four rivers." 1
The tree of life was well known to the Accadians
1 Since, however, a bilingual tablet states that the pronunciation of the Accadian word for" the desert'' which lay on the west side of the
Euphrates (where Ur was built) was ed·inna, it is possible that "the
Garden of Eden '' of Genesis may be the cultivated portion of edinna,
" the desert,'' in the neighbourhood of Eridu.

2. Its (root) was of white crystal which spread
towards the deep.
3. The (shrine ? ) of Hea (was) its pasturage in
Eridu, a canal full of (water).
4. Its seat (was) the (central) place of this earth.
5. Its shrine (was) the couch of mother Zicum,
(the mother of gods and men).
6. The (roof) of its illustrious temple like a forest
spread its shade; there (was) none who within entered.
7. (It was the seat) of·the mighty mother (~icum),
the begetter of Anu.
Eridu was the special seat of the worship of Hea,
and was often known as "the good city."
The flaming sword, which according to Genesis
guarded the approach to the tree of life is paralleled
by the flaming sword of Merodach, which is explained
to be the lightning. It was with this sword which is
represented on the monuments as having the form of
a sickle like the sword of the Greek hero Perseus,
that Merodach over~hrew the dragon and the powers
of darkness. A hymn put into the mouth of Mero
dach, thus speaks of it :- ·
The sun of ..fifty faces, the lofty weapon of my
divinity, I bear.
T~e hero that striketh the mountains, the pro
pitious sun of the morning, that is mine, I bear.
My mighty· weapon, which like an orb smites in a
circle the corpses of the fighters, I bear.
The striker of mountains, my murderous weapon
of Anu, I bear.

to a fabulous serpent with seven heads, which beats
the sea into waves. This serpent was originally

have been explored. Indeed, this is made almost
certain by the existence of an early Babylonian seal,
now in the British Museum, on which a tree is repre
sentec.l with a human figure seated on either side of
it, with the hands stretched out towards the fruit, and
a serpent standing erect behind one ofthem. We know
that the devices on these early seals were taken from
the popular legends and myths. It must be admitted,
however, that the two figures seem both to be males.
But if references to the Fall are few and obscure,
there can be no doubt that the Sabbath was an Ac
·cadian institution, intimately connected with the
worship of the seven planets. The astronomical
tablets have shown that the seven-day week was of
Accadian origin, each day of it being dedicated to the
sun, moon, and five planets, and the word Sabbath
itself, under the form of Sabattu, was known to the
Assyrians, and explained by them as "a day of rest
for the heart." A calendar of Saint's days for the
month of the intercalary Elul makes the 7th, 14th,
19th, 21st, and 28th days of the lunar month Sabbaths
on which no work was allowed to be done. The
Accadian words by which the idea of Sabbath is de
noted, literally mean, "a day on which work is un
lawful," and are interpreted in the bilingual tablets
as signifying " a day of peace " or " completion of
labours.'' The calendar lays down the following in
junctions to the king for each of these sabbaths :
A Sabbath: the prince of many nations
the flesh of animals and cooked food may not eat.



90 BABYLONIAN LEGEND.
The garments of his body he may not change.
White robes he may not put on.
Sacrifice he may not offer. The king may not ride in his chariot.
In royal fashion he may not legislate. A revie,v
of the army the general may not hold.
Medicine for his sickness of body he may not apply.
The antiquity of this text is evident not only from
the fact that it has been translated from an Accadian
original, but also from the word rendered '' prince,"
:MERODACH ATTACK.ING THB SERPENT, ON AN ASSTRliN CYLINDER, IN

which literally means "a shepherd," and takes us
· back to the early times when the Accadian monarchs
still remembered that their predecessors had been
only shepherd-chieftains.
Before concluding this chapter, it must be noted
that the word translated "the sea," in lines three and
seven of the reverse of the hymn to the Creator, is
Tiamtu, which, as we have seen, was the name applied
to the deep, upon which the Babylonians believed
that the earth rested, and out of which it had been
brought into existence.

but one out of many which had slowly grown up
among the people, and been finally thrown into a
literary form. The story of the Creation transmitted
through Berosus (see chapter iii. pp. 34-36), for ex
ample, supplies us with an account which differs en
tirely from the cuneiform account in the last chapter as
well as from the Genesis account, and some fragments
of tablets from Kouyunjik belonging to the library
of Assur-bani-pal give a copy, mutilated as usual, ofa
third version which has, however, points of agreement
with the account of Berosus. This legend, of. which

inscription which was deposited in the temple of
Nergal at Cutha.
It is possible that this legend was supposed to be
the work of one of the mythical kings of Chaldea,
who describes the condition and history of .the world
before his time.
The war carried on against the monstrous crea
tions of Tiamtu, described in this myth, was but one
version of the war waged against Tiamtu, or Chaos,
herself by the sun-god Merodach. The most famous
form taken by the story of this war was that which
described the attack of the seven wicked spirits, or
storm-demons, against the moon, and their final
discomfiture by the bright power of day. This
attack was a primitive attempt to account for lunar
eclipses, dressed up in poetry, and may be compared
with the Chinese belief that when the moon is
eclipsed it has been devoured by the dragon of night.
_Similarly the Egyptians told how Set or Typhon
pursued the moon, the eye of Horus, how it waned
week by week as he struck it, and finally passed into
eclipse when he blinded it altogether. According
to Hindu legend, the immortal head of the serpent
demon RA.bu, cut off by Vishnu who had been
informed by the sun and moon of his theft of the
drink of immortality, incessantly pursues the two
informers in order to devour them, and a Scandi
navian myth makes the sun and moon to be always
pursued by two wolve~, SkOII and Hati, the latter of •
whom, also called MA.nagarmr or dog of the moon,

. 39. (lstar, with Anu the king, an illustrious seat

Most of the remainder of the legend, consisting of
some forty lines, is unfortunately lost, owing to a
fracture 'lf the tablet. What is left, however, shows
that Merodach, "the brilliance of the sun,'' for such
is the meaning of his name, who always appears in
the Accadian hymns as a kind of Babylonian Prome
theus and universal benefactor, comes to the help of
the "labouring " moon, and "awe " goes before him..
Dressed in " glistening armour of unsoiled cloths and
broad garments," he enters "the gate of the palace,"
'' a king, the son of his god, who, like the bright one,
the moon-god, sustains the life of the land," and there
with a helmet of "light like the fire" upon his head,
successfully overthrows the seven powers of darkness.
The poem concludes with a prayer that they may
never descend into the land, and traverse its borders.
In this story, which differs again from all the others,
Bel is supposed to place in the heaven the Moon,
Sun, and Venus, the representative of the stars. The
details have no analogy with the other storie~, and
this can only be considered a poetical myth of the
Creation.



·104 OTHER B.ABYLO}ll.AN .AOOOUNTB
This legend is part of the sixteenth tablet of the
series on evil spirits ; but the tablet contains -other
matters as well, the legend apparently being only
quoted in it. There is another remarkable legend of
the same sort in praise ofthe fire-god, on another tablet
of this series published in "Cuneiform Inscriptions/'
vol. iv. p. 15. The whole of this series concerns the
wanderings of the god Merodach, who goes about the
world seeking to remove· curses and spells, and in
every difficulty applying to his father Hea to learn
how to combat the influence of the evil spirits, to
whom all misfortunes were attributed.
The seven evil spirits illustrate well the way in
which a moral signification may come to be attached
to what was originally a purely physical myth. They
are frequently mentioned in the literature of ancient
Accad. Thus the twenty-third book, on eclipses of
the moon, of the great work on astronomy compiled
for Sargon of Agane, states that: "When the moon
shall describe a section (in) the upper circle· (of its
revolution), the gods of heaven and earth bring about
dearth of men (and) their overthrow; and (there is)
eclipse, inundation, sickness, (and) death; the seven
great spirits before the moon are broken." Else
where, an Accadian hymn, which has an interlinear
Assyrian translation attached to it, speaks as follows
of these dreaded spirits :
1. Seven (they) are, seven they (are).
2. In the abyss of the deep seven they (are).
3. The splendours of heaven (are) those seven; ·



OF THE OBE.ATION. 105
. · 4. In the abyss of the deep, (in) a palace, (was)
their growth.

Another Accadian poet, who lived at Eridu, the
supposed site of Paradise, at the junction ofth.e Tigris
and Euphrates, has left another account of the Seven
wicked spirits in the hymn to the fire-god mentioned
above. He says of them :
1. 0 god of fire, those seven how were they be
gotten, how grew they up?
2. Those seven in the mountain of the sunset were
born;
3. those seven in the mountain of the sunrise grew
up.
4. In the deep. places of the earth have they their
dwelling. _ . _



106 OTHJJJB BABYLONIAN .AOOOUNTB
5. In the high places of the earth have they their·
name.
6. As for them, in heaven and earth wide is their
habitation.
7. Among the gods their couch they have not.
8. Their name in heaven (and) earth exists not.
9. Seven they (are); in the mountain of the sun
set do they rise.
10. Seven they (are); in the m~untain of the sun
rise did they set.
11. In the deep places of the earth did they rest
their feet.
12. On the high places of the earth do they lift
up their head.
13. As for them, goods they know not, in heaven
(and) earth are they not learned.
Merodach is then ordered to fetch " the laurel, the
baleful tree that breaks in pieces the incubi, the name
whereof Hea remembers in ·his heart, in the mighty
enclosure, the girdle of Eridu," in order that the seven
evil spirits may be driven away. Can this laurel-tree
be the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? It
must be remembered that Hea was " the lord of wis
dom," and under the form of a fish as Oa11nes or Hea
Khan was supposed to have ascended from the Per
sian Gulf, and taught the primitive Babylonians the
elements of culture and civilization. ·
At the head of the seven evil spirits stood Tiamtu,
the representative of chaos and darkness. One of the
most remarkable Babylonian legends yet discovered is



OF THE OBE.ATION. 107
one which tells of the primmval struggle between
Tiamtu and Merodach, between light and darkness or
good and evil, and which does but embody in a new
shape the conception which found expression in the
myth of the war against the moon. The tablets which
contain this legend are unfortunately in a very frag
mentary condition.
The first of these is K 4832, too mutilated to
translate ; it contains speeches of the gods before the
war.
The second fragment, K 3473, contains also
speeches, and shows the gods preparing for battle.
It is so terribly broken that translation is impossible,
and all that can be made out is a line here and
there.
The third fragment, K 3938, is on the same sub
ject; some lines of this give· the following general

There are many more sjrnilar broken lines, and· on
the other side fragments of a speech by some being
who desires Tiamtu to make war.
All these fragments are not sufficiently complete to
allow us to translate them with certainty, or even to
ascertain their order.
The fourth fragment, K 3449, relates to the making
of weapons to arm the god who should meet in war
the dragon.
This reads with some doubt on account of .its
mutilation :

OF THE OBJJJ.ATION. 118
Anu proclaims great honour (fourth fragment, lines
· 7 to 11) to any of the gods who will engage in
battle with her. Bel or Merodach volunteers, and
goes forth armed with these weapons to fight the
dragon. Tiamtu is encouraged by one of the gods
who has become her husband, and meets Merodach
in battle. The description of the fight and the subse
quent triumph of the god are very fine, and remark
ably curious ·in their details, but the connection
between the fragments is so uncertain at present
that it is better to reserve comment upon them until
the text is more complete. The scimitar with which
Merodach is armed is shown by the cylinders and
bas-reliefs to have been of the shape of a sickle, and
is therefore the same as the harpe or khereb wit~ which
the Greek hero Perseus was armed when he went
forth to fight against the dragon of the sea at Joppa.
The dragon itself, according to the representations of
the monuments, was a composite monster, with the
tail, horns, claws, and wings of the medireval devil.
The whole war between _the powers of good and evil,
chaos and order, finds its parallel in the war be
tween Michael and the dragon in Revelation xii.
7 to 9, where the dragon is called" the great dragon,
that old serpent, called the devil and Satan, which
deceiveth the whole world.'' This description is
strikingly like the impression gathered from the
fragments of the cuneiform story; the dragon Tisrotu
who fought against the gods, and whose fate it was to
be conquered in a celestial war, closely corresponds

116 THE BIN OF PHI!l GOD ZU.
an Assyrian noun Zu, Za, and Zi. Analogy would
lead us to infer that the name had been borrowed by
the Assyrians from the Accadians, as well as the
story with which it is connected.
Mr. Smith compared the legend with that of the
mutilation of Uranus by his son Kronus, and with
the history of the outrage of Ham on his father Noah;
but its real analogue is the myth of Prometheus, the
benefactor of men, who stole the fire of heaven for
their sake, and brought upon himself the anger and
punishment of Zeus. It contains two difficult words,
partsi and tereti. The first is ambiguous, meaning
either "oracles" or "shrines," but since it is coupled
with dup-simi, '' tablets of destiny," it is probably to
be rendered "oracles.'' Tereti is very obscure.
The sun-god is called "the lord of tereti," and the
word occurs in the hymn to •the Creator, Rev. 17
(p. 79), where also it is united with partsi,
'' command " or "oracle." It may signify " lots." The tablets of destiny, stolen by Zu, for the
benefit, apparently, of mankind, formed the vault of
the palace of the under-world. We may compare the
books which are to be opened on the day of judgment
in Dan. vii. 10, and Rev. xx. 12.
The tablet containing the account of the sin of
Zu, K ·3454, in the Museum collection, originally
contained four columns of text, each column having
about sixty lines of writing. The first and fourth
columns are almost entirely lost, there not being
enough anywhere to translate from. The mutilation



2'HE SIN OF THE GOD ZU. 117
· of the text serious!y adds to. the difficulties of trans
lation.
The single fragment preserved, belonging to the
first column, mentions some being who was the seed
or firstborn of Bel, with a number of titles, such
as "warrior, soldier of the temple of Bel," and the
name of the god Zu occurs, but not so as to prove
these titles to be his.
The following is a partial translation of the remains
of this tablet :

Such are the fragments of the story so far as they
can be translated at present. The divine Zu here
mentioned, whose sin is spoken of, is never counted
among the gods, and there would be no clue to his
nature were it not for a curious tablet printed in
'' Cuneiform Inscriptions," vol. iv. p. 14, which
throws light on his origin and character. . This
tablet gives the following curious relation :
1. The god Lugal-turda (the valiant king) [fled]
to the mountains, a place remote ;
2. in the mountains of Sabu [he dwelt].
3. No mother gave him life 1 or (suckled him).
.
1 This is the reading of the original Accadian fiext. The Assyrian
translation has, "was his establisher."

This Zu bird is plainly the same as the god Zu of



THE BIN OF THE GOD ZU. 123
the former legend, and his nature is shown by a pas
sage in the annals of Assurnazirpal (" Cuneiform In
scriptions," vol. i. p. 22, col. ii. 1. 107), who says that
his warriors "like the divine Zu bird upon them
darted." This bird is called the cloud or storm-bird,
the flesh-eating bird, the lion or giant bird, the bird
of prey, the bird with sharp beak; and it is not diffi
cult to see what the deified bird really was. It was
clearly the storm-cloud, which appears in Aryan folk
lore under the varying forms of the eagle, the wood
pecker, and the robin redbreast, the bird of Thor;
while in Chinese mythology the storm-bird is de
scribed as "a bird which, in flying, obscures the sun,
and of whose quills are made water-tuns." The roe
of the " Arabian Nights," with its wings of ten thou
sand fathoms in width, and its egg, which it was a sin in
Aladdin to wish to take from the pl~ce where it hung,
is but an echo of the Chinese storm-bird; and the
identity of the Chaldean Zu with the latter is demon
strated by its Accadian name, which signifies "the
bird of the divine storm-cloud." Just as Prometheus
brought the lightning from heaven to earth, and
suffered the penalty of enchainment to a desert rock,
so, too, the storm-bird of Accad stole the secrets of
the gods, and was punished by exile from them, and
transformation into a bird. When once the storm
cloud had been likened to a bird, it was easy enough
to identify it with an actual bird of similar name
which swooped upon its prey with sharp beak. That
the lightning which darted from the bosom of the



124 THE BIN OF THE GOD ZU.
black tempest really formed the tablets of destiny
was a ready conclusion to a people who read the
future in the message sent through the lightning
from heaven to earth. Even the Hebrews saw in the
thunder '' the voice of God." Lugal-turda, it may be
added, was the patron of the city of Amarda or
Marad, and is said to have been the deity worshipped
by lzdubar.
In the story of the offence of Zu there is another
instance of the variations which constantly occur in the
Assyrian inscriptions with respect to the relationship
of the gods. Nebo is usually called son of Merodach,
but in this inscription he is called son of Anu. The
part that he plays in it is due to the fact that he
was identified with the " meridian sun."

before him, and seven gods who follow him in his de
structive course. The latter are the seven evil spirits
in a new form.
The point of the story in these tablets appears to
be, that the people of the world had offended Anu
the god of heaven, and accordingly that deity ordered
Dibbara to go forth and strike the people with the
pest. It is evident here that exactly the same views
prevailed in Babylonia as among the Jews, visitations
from pestilence or famine being always supposed to
be sent by the deity in punishment for some sin. In
fact, the account of the pestilence inflicted upon the
Israelites on account of David's sin in numbering the
people is a striking parallel to the Accadian legend
which follows. The angel of the pestilence seen by
David, with his sword drawn, may be compared
with Dibbara, the Accadian personification of the
pest.
The whole of this series of tablets may be described
as a poetical picture of the destruction caused by a
plague, sweeping over district after d_istrict, and de
stroying everything before it.
The fragment which appears to come first in the
series is a very mutilated portion of a tablet, con
taining parts of three columns of writing. Only a
fragment of the first column is perfect enough to
translate, and the characters on this are so worn
that the translation cannot be other than doubtful.

four columns of writing being represented. There

Fifth tablet of the exploits of the god (Dibbara).
Here we see a picture of Oriental feeling with
reference to natural phenomenon or disaster to man
kind. It is supposed that some deity or angel st.ands
with a sword over the devoted people and sweeps
them into eternity.
The first fragment shows the anger of Anu at the sin
of some doomed race, and his command to Dibbara to
take his weapon, slay the people, and desolate the land
like the god Ner. This god Ner was one of the mythi
cal kings of Babylon who reigned after the flood, and
is mentioned as having a terrible name and being
with Etana a dweller in Hades. The allusion to him
in this passage seems to imply that he was believed to
have once rescued Babylon from a hostile attack.
The next fragment exhibits the goddess of Karrak
as healing.the illness of some of the people, 4,102 being
mentioned as struck with disease.
In the next and largest fragment the story becomeR
a little more connected; it commences with a descrip
tion of preparation for battle, and goes on through



THE EXPLOITS OF DIB BAB.A. 187
speeches and actions to describe the course of Dibbara
and his plague that he inflicts upon Babylon, and its
besiegers where he spares neither chief nor slave, and
enters even the palace. It would seem that the sin of
the Babylonians arose from the chiefpriest or governor
of the city arming the troops and sending them out to
plunder the enemy. For this the plague is sent, and
its progress is graphically described. Merodach the
special protector of Babylon at last interferes, and the
god of pestilence is checked in his course. The next
city visited belongs to Samas, being either Larsa, or
Sippara, and then the plague reaches Erech. The
character of this city is described, the worship of
Venus, with her handmaids Samkhati and Kharimati,
or " Joy'' and " Seduction," the priests and cere
monies, and the progress of the plague over the
place. Then the great god the deity of Duran comes
forward and pleads for his city, calling to mind its
uprightness and justice, and praying for its exemp-·
tion from the plague.
In the third column mention is made of Gutium,
under which name the Accadians designated the whole
tract of country which extended from the Tigris to
the eastern borders of Media, including the district
afterwards known as Assyria. The land of Nizir, in
which rose the mountain of Elwend, on the top of
which the Accadians supposed the ark to have rested,
also formed part of this vast tract. Sir Henry Raw
linson long ago pointed out that Gutium must be the
Goyim of the 14th chapter of Genesis, ruled by



138 PHJJJ EXPLOI'l.'S OP DIBB.AR.A.
Tidal, or rather, according to the reading of the
Septuagint, Tur-gal "the great Son."
The fourth column next describes a prophecy
of Dibbara that there should be internal war among
the peoples of the Persian Gulf, of Syria, Assyria,
Elam, Gutium, Lullubu and the Kossmans, from all
which troubles benefit should come to the Accadians
or northern Babylonians. The Kossmans or Cassi in
habited the northern part of Elam, and under Kham
muragas conquered Babylonia and founded there a
dynasty which lasted a long time. Lullubu lay
northward of Mesopotamia and Nizir.
Then according to his wish Dibbara sends the god
ltak his servant, with the seve11 warrior gods, to
devastate, and Itak sweeps over the country and
destroys it.1
The last tablet deals in generalities pointing out
the action of Dibbara when his praise was neglected,
and telling all the glories and good that should come
to those who should celebrate this deity in song. On
the spread of a plague it is evident that the Baby
lonians had no better means of arresting it than to
pray and praise the supposed terrible deity of the
scourge, that he might sheathe his sword of anger.
The antiquity of the legend is evident from the
1 Itak had his worshippers as well as Dibbara. Thus an Accadian
seal in the possession of Dr. Huggins bears a legend stating that it
belonged to "Ruru-lukh, the servant of Itak, the street-traverser.''
The god is represented on this seal as a man in a flounced dress, to
·whom a kid is being offered, and is symbolized by two animals one of
which looks like a locust, the other like a monkey.

BABYLONIAN FABLES. 141
Four fables have been preserved among the frag
mentary records of Assur-bani-pal's library.
The first contained at least four tablets each having
four columns of writing. Two of the acting animals
in it are the eagle and the serpent.
The second· is similar 'in ·character, the leading
animal ·being the fox or jackal, but there are only
four fragments of it; it may belong to the same series
as the fable of the eagle.
The third is a single tablet with two columns of
writing, and contains a discussion between the horse
and ox.
The fourth is a single fragment in which a calf
speaks, but there is nothing to show the nature of
the story..
I. THE STORY OF THE EAGLE.
This story appears to be the longest and most
curious of the fables, but the very mutilated condition
of the various fragments gives as u~ual considerable
difficulty in attempting a translation of it. One of the
actors in the storJ7 is an ancient monarch name9- Etana.
who, like Ner, ruled over· Babylon in the mythical
period that followed the Deluge, and whose phantom
was believed to sit, crowned, on a throne in Hades
along with the shades of the other heroes ofold time.
The story of Etana was supposed to have been written
by an early poet named Nis-Sin.
.It is impossible to determine the proper order of



142 BABYLONIAN FABLES.
the fragments ofthe story owing to their mutilated con
dition; they must therefore be translated as they come.

Such. are the principal fragments of this curious
·legend. According to the fragment K 2527, the
serpent had committed some sin for which it was
condemned by the god Samas to be eaten by the
eagle ; but the eagle declined the repast.
Mter this, some one, whose name is lost, baits a
trap for the eagle, and the bird going to get the
meat, falls into the trap and is caught. Now the
eagle is left, until dying for want of food it is glad
to eat the serpent, which it takes and tears open.
The other birds then interfere, but the tablet is
too mutilated to allow us to discover for what
purpose.
The other fragments concern the building of some
city, Etana being king, and in. these relations the
eagle again appears; there are seven spirits or angels
principal actors in the matter, but the whole story is
obscure at .present, and a connected plot cannot be
made out.
This fable has evidently some direct connection
with the mythical history of Babylonia, for Etaria is
mentioned as an ancient -Babylonian monarch in the
Izdubar legends. He seems to be the Titan of the
Greek writers, who lived after the Deluge and made
war against Kronos or Hea shortly after the confusion
of tongues. The city built by Etana may be the city



BABYLONIAN 1'.ABLEB_. 14?
mentioned in Gen. xi. 4 as built at the same time as
the Tower of Babel. If the Sibyl can be trusted
Titan was a contemporary of Prometheus, in whom
we may perhaps see the Inninna of the cuneiform
inscription. That Etana was closely associated with
.
the story of ·the Deluge appears plain from the
fact that he ruled at Surippak, the home and kingdom
of the Chaldean Noah. Th~ legend of Etana seems
in the fable to be put into the mouth of the eagle.
II. STORY OF THE Fox.
The next fable, that of the fox, was ascribed to an
author called Lal-Merodach, the son of Eri-Turnun
na, but the fragments are so disconnected that they
must be given without any attempt at arrangement.

The incidental allusions in these fragments show
that the fox was even then considered cunning, and
the animal in the story was evidently ~ watery speci
men, as he brings tears to his assistance whenever
anything is to be gained by it. He had offended
Samas by some means and the god sentenced him to
death, a sentence which he escaped through powerful
pleading on his own behalf.
III. FABLE OF THE HonsE AND Ox.
The next fable, that of the horse and the qx, is a
single tablet with only two columns of text. The
date. of the tablet is in the· reign of Assur-bani-pal,
and there is no statement that it is copied froip. an
earlier text. There are altogether four portions of
the text, but only one is perfect enough to be worth
translating. This largest fragment, K 3456, contains
about one-third of the story.

during the drought of summer, and makes a league
with the horse, apparently for the purpose of sharing
with him the same pastures. Most of the speeches,
however, made by the two animals are lost or only
present in small fragments, and the story recom

the horse.

32. open first (that of)'' Behold Istar the noble ...•''
(Colophon)
Palace of Assur-bani-pal, king of nations, king (of
...
Assyria).
It appears from these fragments that the story de
scribed a time when the animals associated together,
and the ox and horse fell into a friendly conversation.
The ox, commencing the discussion, praised himself;
the answer of the horse is lost, but where the story
recommences it appears that· the ox objects to the
horse drawing the chariot from which he himself is
hunted, and the horse ultimately offers to tell the ox
a story, the ox choosing the story called "Behold
Istar,'' probably some story of the same character as
that of !star's descent into Hades.
It is uncertain if any other tablet followed this; it
is, however, probable that there was one containing
the story told by the horse. Although there is no
indication to show the date of this fable, the fact that
it is not stated to have been copied from an older
document seems to show that it is not earlier than
the time of Assur-bani-pal. 1,he loss of the tablet
containing the story of Istar, told by the horse to the
ox, is unfortunate. The last fable is a mere fragment
similar to the others, containing a story in which the
calf speaks. .There is not enough of it to make it
worth translation.

156 JJ'B.AGM'JJJNTS OF
differs from the generality of these inscriptions, being
very obscure and difficult. In consequence of this
and other reasons, only an outline of most of the story
is given here.
We are first told of a quarrel between a mother
named Zibanit and her daughter, and that the mother
shuts the door of the house, and turns her daughter
adrift, the words of the original being " the mother to
the daughter opens not her door." The doings of a
man named Zamu have some connection with the
affair, his " descending into the street on getting "
something being mentioned immediately before the
expulsion of the daughter; and at the close we are
told ofAtarpi, sometimes called Atarpi-nisu, or Atarpi
the " man " who had his couch beside the river of the
north, and was pious to the gods, but took no notice
of these things. When the story next opens, we find
the god Bel calling together an assembly of the gods
his sons, and relating to them that he is angry at the
sin of the world, stating also that he will bring down
upon it disease, tempest, distress, madness, burning
and sickness. This is followed by the statement that
these things came to pass, and Atarpi then invoked
his god Hea to remove these evils. For a whole year,
it would seem, he interceded for the people, and at
last Hea answered, and announced his resolve to de
stroy the people. After this the story reads :
1. (Hea called) his assembly (by the river) of the
north ; he said to the gods his sons :
2. . . . . . . I made them



MISOJJJLL.ANBOUB TEXTS. 157
3. . . . . shall not stretch until before he turns.
4. Their famine I observe,
5. their shame the woman takes not ;
6. I will look to judge the people?
7. in their stomach let famine dwell,
8. above let Rimmon drink up his rain,
9. let him drink up below, let not the flood be
carried in the canals,
10. let it remove from the field its inundations,
11. let the corn-god give over increase, let blackness
overspread the corn,
12. let the plowed fields bring forth thorns,
13. let the growth of their fruit perish, let food not
come forth from it, let bread not be produced,
14. let distress also be spread over the people,
15..may favour be shut up, and good not be given.
16. He looked also to judge the people,
17. in their stomach dwelt fa¢ne,
18. above Rimmon drank up his rain,
19. he drank it up below, the flood was not carried
in the canals,
20. it removed from the field its inundations,
21. the corn-god gave over increase, blackness
spread over the corn,
22. the plowed fields brought forth thorns, the
growth of their fruit perished,
23. food came not forth from it, bread was not pro
duced,
24. distress was spread over the people,




158 FB.AGMBNTS OF'
25. favour was shut up, good was not given.
This will serve to show the style of the tablet.
The instrument of punishment was apparently a
famine from war1t of rain.
Here the story is again lost, and where it recom
mences Hea is making a speech, directing another
person to cut something into portions, and place
seven on each side, and then to build brickwork round
them. After this comes a single fragment, the con
nection of which with the former part is obscure.
1. Seated was the goddess . . . .
2. to her face also he gave . . . .
3. Anu opene~ his mouth and speaks ; he said to
(Nusku);
4. Nusku open thy gate; thy weapons (take)
5. in the assembly of the great gods when • • • .
6. their speech? • . . .
7. Anu sent me . . . •
8. your king sent ....
At present no satisfactory story can be made out
of the detached fragments of this tablet, but it evi
dently belongs to the mythical portion of Babylonian
history, and it is impossible not to compare the un
successful intercession of the righteous man Atarpi
with the pleadings of Abraham on behalf of the cities
of the plain.
The next text is a single fragment, K 2407, be

riddle to the gods.

16. Let your solution be produced, that I may

After this there is a mutilated passage containing
the names, titles, and actions of the gods who con
-sider the riddle. It is evident that it is air or wind
,



160 FB.AGMBNTS OJJ'
which the wise man means in his riddle, for this is
everywhere, and in its sounds imitates the cries of
animals.
Next we have another single fragment about a
person named Sinuri, who uses a divining rod to
ascertain the meaning of a dream.
1. Sinuri with the cut reed pondered . . . .
2. with his right hand he broke it, and Sinuri speaks
and thus says:
3. Now the plant of Nusku, the shrub? of Samas
art thou.
4. Judge, thou judgest (or divinest), divine con
cerning this dream,
5. which in the evening, at midnight, or in the
•
morning,
6. has come, which thou knowest,but I do not know.
7. If it be good may its good not be lost to me,
8. if it be evil may its evil not happen to me.
There are some more obscure and broken lines, but
no indication as to the story to which it belongs.
A specimen of early Babylonian folklore may fitly ·
be added here. It is a bilingual fragment which
treats of a foundling who was picked up in the
streets and finally became a great scholar. Un
fortunately both the beginning and the end of the
story are wanting.
1. He who father and mother had not,
2. who his father (and) his mother knew not,
3. in the gutter (was) his going, in the street (his)

One of the most obscure incidents in the Book of
Genesis is undoubtedly the building of the Tower of
Babel. So far as we can judge from the fragments
of his copyists, there was no reference to it in the
work of Berosus, and early writers had to quote from
writers of more than doubtful authority in order to ,
confirm it.
There is also no representation on any of the
Babylonian gems which can with any certainty be
described as belonging to this story. Mr. Smith, how
ever, picked out three from a series of these carvings

MISOBLL.ANBOUS T:EXTS. 163
proportion between the supposed structure and the
men, and no stress can consequently be laid on the
representations. The Babylonian origin of the story
is, however, self-evident. According to Genesis, man
kind after the flood travelled from the east, that is
from Kharsak-kurra, " the mountain of the East,"
now Elwend, where the Accadians believed the ark
to have rested, to the plain of Shinar or Sumir. Both
Alexander Polyhistor and Abydenus state that the
building of the Tower of Babel was known to Baby
lonian history, Babel, in fact, being the native form
of the name which the Greeks changed into Babylon.
The legend of Etana given in the last chapter seems
to imply that the Tower was supposed to have been
built under the superintendence of this mythical hero.
However that may be, a fragment of the native story
of its construction was discovered by Mr. Smith, and
though shockingly mutilated, is sufficient to show what
the Babylonians themselves believed on the matter.
It is evident from the wording of the fragment that
it was preceded by at least one tablet, describing the
sin of the people in building the tower. The frag
ment preserved belongs to .a tablet containing from
four to six columns of writing, of which portions of
four remain. The principal part is the beginning of

166 FB.AGMENTS OF
In the first part we have the anger of Bel, the ·
father of the gods, at the sin of those who were
building the walls of Babylon and the mound of
tower or palace. This mound is termed '' the illus
trious," and the god Anu who destroyed the builders
is accordingly called Sar-tuli-elli, '' the king of the
illustrious mound." Since the Accadian name of the
month Tisri, our October, was "the month of the
illustrious mound,'' it would appear that the con
struction of it was believed to have taken place at the
time of the autumnal equinox. The builders were
punished by the deity, and the walls that had been
set up in the day were destroyed at night. Prof.
Delitzsch has drawn attention to a possible reference
to this legend in an Accadian hymn in which the poet
says to Merodach, "found during the day, destroy
during the night." It is plain from the first lines
that the whole attempt was directed against the gods;
in fact, that like the giants and Titans in Greek
mythology, whose assault on Zeus is probably but an
echo of the old Babylonian tale, conveyed to Greece
through the hands of the Phrenicians, the builders of
the Tower of Babylon intended to scale the sky.
The}' were, however, confounded on the mound, as
well as their ~peech (tammasle). It is interesting to
find the very same word signifying " to confound ,,
used in the Babylonian as in the Hebrew account,
namely balal, or rather baldk. We may also notice
that the Hebrew writer once (Gen. xi. 7.) adopts the
polytheistic langt1age of the Accadian scribe; the

covered by excavation that the tower consisted of
seven stages of brickwork on an earthen platform,
each stage being of a different· colour. This is ex
plained by the fact that it was devoted to the seven
planets. The height of the earthen platform was not
ascertained, but the :first stage, which was an exact
square, was 272 feet each way, and 26 feet high, the
bricks being blackened with bitumen; this stage is
supposed to have been dedicated to the planet
Saturn. The second stage was a square of 230
feet, 26 feet high, faced with orange-coloured bricks;
supposed to have been dedicated to Jupiter. The
third stage, 188 feet square, and 26 feet high,
faced with red bricks, was probably dedicated to
Mars. The fourth stage, 146 feet square, and 15 feet
high, was probably dedicated to the Sun, and is
..
thought by Sir H. R~wlinson to have been originally
plated with gold. The fifth stage is supposed to have
been 104, the sixth 62, and the seventh 20 feet square,
but the top was too ruinous to decide these measure
ments. These stages were probably dedicated to
Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. Each stage of the
building was not set in the centre of the stage on
which it .rested, but was placed 30 feet from the front,
and 12 feet from the back. The ruin at present rises
154 feet above the level of the plain, and is the
most imposing pile in the whole country. According



MIBOELLANEOUB TEX.TB. 171
to Nebuchadnezzar it had been built to the height of
42 cubits by " a former king," who however had not
completed its summit, and it had long been in a
ruinous condition when Nebuchadnezzar undertook
to restore and finish it. Prof. Schrader imagines
that the long period during which it had remained
an unfinished ruin caused the growth of the legend
which saw in it a monument of the overthrow of
human presumption, the diversity of languages in
Babylonia being sufficient to account for the localiza
tion of the confusion of tongues in the country.
Sir Henry Rawlinson no,v proposes to place the
Tower or tul ellu at the ruins now called Amran,
within the city of Babylon itself. Here he thinks
were the temple of Anu, on the site of the ruined
Tower, a chapel dedicated to Nebo, an altar of Mero
dach, the royal palace (now represented by the mound
of the Kasr), and the hanging gardens, all enclosed by
a common wall. The quarter of Babylon thus en
closed he would identify with the Calneh of the Bible,
principally on the ground that the Septuagint render
ing of Isaiah x. 9 is," Have I not taken the regionabove
Babylon and Chalanne where the tower was built?"
A third site has been claimed for the Tower on the
Babil or Mujellibeh mound on the north side of Baby
lon. This represents the famous temple of Belus or ·
Bel, whose great festival marked the beginning of the·
year and the vernal equinox. But there is no evi
dence to support this third opinion.
In the Babylonian and Assyrian sculptures there



172 FBAGMJ!lNTB OF
are occasionally representations of towers similar in .
style to the supposed Tower of Babel; one of these
is given on the stone of Merodach Baladan I., oppo
site p. 236 of Mr. Smith's "Assyrian Discoveries;"
another occurs on the sculptures at Nineveh, repre
senting the city of Babylon; this tower, however,
cannot represent the Borsippa pile, since it consists of
only five stages.
Besides the Tower of Babel, the destruction of
Sodom and Gomorrah by fire from heaven may also
have been known to the Accadians. We learn from
Genesis xiv. that the cities of the plain were amo~g
the conquests of Chedor-laomer and his allies, and
there is some reason for thinking that the history of
Chedor-laomer's campaign may have been derived
from the Babylonian state archives. At all events
~raphel or Amarpel, the king of Sumir, is mentioned
:first, although Chedor-laomer was the paramount
sovereign and the leader of the expedition. The
expedition must have taken place during the period
when, as we learn from the inscriptions, Babylonia
was subject to the monarchs of Elam, though subordi
nate princes were ruling over the states into which it
was divided at the time. Though the name of Chedor
laomer has not been found, Laomer or Lagamar
appears as an Elamite god, and several of the Elamite
kings bore names compounded with Kudur " a ser
vant," as Kudur-Nankhunte, "the servant of the god
Nankhunte," Kudur-Mabug, "the servant of Mabug,"
and the like. Arioch, king of Ella.ear, which probably



MISOELL.ANEO US -TEX.TS. 173
stands for al Larsa, '' the city of Larsa," has the same
name as Eri-Acu (" the servant of the moon-god"),
the son of the Elamite monarch Kudur-Mabug, who
reigned over Larsa during his father's lifetime, and
was eventually overthrown by the Cossrean conqueror
Khammuragas.
The text which perhaps relates to the destruction
of the guilty cities is a bilingual one, much mutilated,
and runs as follows :
1. An overthrow came from the midst of the
deep (the waters above the firmament).
2. The fated punishment from the midst of heaven
descended.
3. A storm like a plummet the earth (over
whelmed).
4. Towards the four winds the destroying flood
like fire burnt.
5. The inhabitants of the city it had caused to be
tormented; their bodies it consumed.
6. In ·city and country it spread death, and the
flames as they rose overthrew.
7. Freeman and slave were equal, and the high
places it filled.
8. In heaven and earth like a thunderstorm it·
had rained; a prey it made.
9. To a place of refuge the gods hastened, and in
a throng collected. .
10. Its mighty (onset) they fled from, and like a
garment it concealed (the guilty).
11. They (feared), and death (overtook them).

12. (Their) feet and hands (it embraced).
13. . . . . . . . . • .
14. Their body it consumed.

16. . . . . with (glory?) and breadth his mouth he

17. This man the voice (of the thunder) called ; the
thunderbolt descended;
18. during the day it flashed; grievously (it fell).
Here the fragment breaks off. It is possible that
the person referred to in line 17 was the pious man
who like Lot escaped the destruction that befell his
neighbours.

soni:fied form of the sun-god. The two last characters
of the name, however, when used as a compound ideo
graph, denoted "the under-lip,'' and the first cha
racter symbolizes " wood."
Mr. Smith believed that lzdubar was the Biblical ,
Nimrod, and was almost inclined to think that this
was the way in which the name ought to be phoneti
cally rendered. One passage, however, in which the
last syllable is followed by the syllable ra seems to
imply that the final letter was r.
The originally solar character of the hero was still
remembered at the time when the great Epic of the
Accadians was put together. As ~as pointed out by
Sir Henry Rawlinson shortly after Mr. _Smith's :first
discovery of it, it is arranged upon an astronomical
principle, its twelve books or tablets corresponding
with the twelve signs of the Zodiac, through which
the sun passes in his yearly course. Thus the eleventh
tablet, which contains the episode of the Deluge,
answers to Aquarius the eleventh sign of the Zodiac,
and the eleventh month of the Accadian year called
" the rainy; " and the sixth tablet, describi11g his
courtship by lstar, answers to Virgo the sixth sign of
the Zodiac, and the sixth Accadian month called that
"of the errand of !star." It is in the second month,
that of " the directing bull," and under the sign of
Taurus, that Hea-bani, half-man, half-bull, is brought
to Izdubar in the second tablet; the lion is slain by
lzdubar under the Zodiacal Leo, and the lamentation
he makes over the corpse of his friend and seer Hea



...
THJJJ IZDUB.AB LEGENDS. 177
bani is made in "the dark month " of Adar, as it was
termed, at the end of the year. Like the autumnal
sun, too, lzdubar sickens in the eighth book corre
sponding with the month of October, and only recovers
his health and brilliance after bathing in the waters of
the eastern ocean at the beginning of the new year.
If anything were· needed to confirm the solar cha
racter of lzdubar and his history, it would be afforded
by a comparison with the legends of the Greek solar
hero, Herakles. · Like much else of Greek mythology,
the twelve adventures of Herakles were brought to
Greece from Babylonia through the hands of the
Phrenicians, and it has long been recognized that
Herakles is but a form of Baal Melkarth, the sun-god
of Tyre. Hea-bani reappears in Cheiron, the centaur,
the friend and instructor of Herakles, and just as Bea
bani was created by Hea, Cheiron was said to be the
son of Kronos, who is identified by Berosus with Hea
in the account of the Deluge. The lion slain by
lzdubar is the lion of Nemea sJajn by Herakles; the
winged bull made by Anu is the famous bull ofKrete;
the tyrant Khumbaba is the tyrant Geryon ; the gems
borne by the trees of the forest beyond the gateway
of the sun are the apples of the Hesperides; and the
deadly sickness of lzdubar himself is but the fever of
Herakles, caused by the poisoned tunic of Nessus.
A very slight inspection of ~he Epic is sufficient to
show that it has been pieced together out of a number
of previously existing and independent materials.
Thus the history of the Deluge, which is itself but an
N



178 PHB IZDUBAB LEGENDS.
episode somewhat violently foisted into the legend of
lzdubar in order to preserve the astronomical
arrangement of the Epic, may be shown to have con
sisted of at least two older poems on the subject; and
a careful examination of other portions of the Epic
brings the same fact to light elsewhere.
As, ho·wever, there is clear proof that the Epic was
originally composed in Accadian, our present text
being merely the Semitic translation of the Accadian
original, it must have existed in the form in which we
now have it before the age of Sargon and the extinc
tion of the Accadian language in Chaldea. We shall
not be far wrong, therefore, in ascribing its composition
to about B.c. 2000, or a little earlier. The older lays
or poems out of which it was formed must therefore
date before this period. There seems to have been a
considerable number of them, each incident in the
cycle of ancient Accadian mythology having been the
subject of various poems. Many of these originated
in different parts of the country, so that a long period
of time must be allowed for their growth and subse
quent reduction to a literary form. But as the legends
they celebrated were traditions in the country before
they were embodied in poems and committed to
-writing, we must go back to quite a remote epoch for
their first starting-point.
The earliest evidence we have of them is in the
carvings on early Babylonian cylindrical seals.
Among the earliest known devices on these seals we
have scenes from the legends of lzdubar, and from



THE IZDUB.AB LJJJGENDB. 179
the story of the Creation. The seals mostly be]ong
to the age of the kings of Ur, and some of them are
a good deal older than n.c. 2000. The principal
incidents represented on them are the struggles o(
Izdubar and his companion Hea-bani with the lion
and the bull, the journey of Izdubar in search of
Xisuthrus, Noah or Xisuthrus in his ark, and the
war between Tiamtu the sea-dragon and the god
Merodach. There is a fragment of a document in
the British Museum which claims to be copied from
an omen tablet belonging to the time of Izdubar
himself, but it is probably not earlier than B.c. 1600,
when many similar tablets were written.
There is an incidental notice of the ship or ark of
"the god Izdubar" in a tablet printed in "Cuneiform
Inscriptions," vol. ii. p. 46. He is here called "the
king who bears the sceptre." This tablet, which con
tains lists of wooden objects, was written in the time
of Assur-bani-pal, but is copied from an original, which
must have been written at least eighteen hundred
years before the Christian era. The geographical
notices on this tablet suit the period before the rise
of Babylon. Surippak is called in it the ship or ark
city, this name forming another reference to the Flood
legends. Izdubar is also mentioned in a series of
tablets relating to witchcraft, and on a tablet contain
ing prayers to him as a god; this last showing that
he was deified, which, however, was an honour also
given to several Babylonian kings.
As already stated, the legends of Izdubar are in

scribed on twelve tablets, of which there are remains
of at least four editions. All the tablets are in frag
ments, and none of them are complete; but it is a
fortunate circumstance that the most perfect tablet is
the eleventh, which describes the Deluge, this being
the most important ofthe series. In the first chapter
the successive steps in the discovery of these legends
have been already described, and we may now there
fore pass on to the description and translation of
the various fragments. All the fragments of our
present copies belong to the reign of Assur-bani-pa],
king of Assyria, in the seventh century B.c. From
the mutilated condition of many of them it is im
possible at present to gain an accurate idea of the
whole scope of the legends, and many parts which
are lost have to be supplied by conjecture; the
order even of some of the tablets cannot be deter
mined, and it is uncertain if we have fragments of
the whole twelve in what follows. Mr. Smith
has, however, conjecturally divided the fragments into
groups corresponding roughly with the subjects of
the tablets. Each tablet when complete contained six
columns of writing, and ea~h column had generally
from forty to fifty lines of writing, there being
in all about 3,000 lines of cuneiform text. The
divisions adopted by Mr. Smith will be seen by the
following summary, which exhibits our present know
ledge of the fragments.

TABLET I.
The opening words of the :first tablet are pre
served, and form as usual the title of the series, but
the expressions used are obscure from want of any
context to explain them. There are two principal or
key-words, naq_bi and lcugar; the :first of which means
'' a channel," and is more particularly applied to the
canals with which Babylonia was intersected and
watered, while the second is the compound ideograph
which literally signifies '' minister " or " servant of
work." It was the special title of lzdubar, who, like
his Greek double Herakles, was celebrated for " the
twelve labours " he successfully undertook. The
title had no doubt been originally given to the fire
god, in whom primitive man sees his most useful ser
vant and workman. The first line of the Epic would
consequently have run: " The canals, the toiling
hero, the god lzdubar, had seen." Elsewhere, how
ever, the title of lzdubar is written Zicar, that is,
''the male" or "hero."
After the heading and opening line there is a
considerable blank in the story, two columns of
writing being entirely lost. It is probable that this
part contained the ~count of the parentage and



184 THE IZD UB.AB LEGENDS.
previous history of Izdubar, forming the introduc
tion to the story. In the subsequent portions of the
history there is very little information to supply the
loss of this part of the inscription ; but it appears
that the mother of Izdubar was named Dannat,
which signifies " the powerful lady." His father is
not named in any of our present fragments, but he is
referred to in the third tablet. He was no doubt a
deity, possibly the Sun-god, who is supposed to inter
fere very much in his behalf. When Izdubar, the
old god of :fire, after first becoming a form of the
solar deity, was finally personified and regarded as a
mighty leader, strong in war and hunting, he was
turned into a giant, one ·of the mythical monarchs
who had ruled in Babylonia in long-past days, and
had subdued the many petty kingdoms into which the
valley of the Euphrates was then divided.
The centre of the empire of lzdubar is laid in
the region of Shinar, or Sumir, Erech "the lofty"
being the chief seat of his power, and thus agrees
with the site of the kingdom of Nimrod, according to
Genesis x. 8, 9, 10, where we read: " And Cush begat
Nimrod : he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
He was a mighty hunter before the Lord : wherefore
it is said, even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before
the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was
Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the
land of Shinar." We cannot overlook the fact that
the character of lzdubar as hunter, leader, and king,
corresponds with that of Nimrod. Cush, the father o(



THB IZD UBAB LBGENDS. 180 ..
Nimrod, may be identified with Cusu, Cusi or Cus, the
Accadian deity of sunset and night. The word in Ac
cadian signified "rest" and" darkness," and is trans
lated by the Assyrian nakku "to rest," and nukhu or
nukh " rest." This latter word is identical with the
Biblical Noah. It is very possible, therefore, that
Cush, the father of Nimrod, has nothing to do with
Cush or Ethiopia, the son of Ham, the two being set
side by side in Genesis merely on account of the simi
larity of their names. In this case all the ethnological
difficulties occasioned ~y the belief that the Accadians
of Babylonia were Cushites,and connected with Egypt
or Ethiopia, will be avoided. It is curious to find the
Christian writers identifying Nimrod with Evechous,
the first king of Babylon, according to Berosus, after
the flood.
The next passage in Genesis after the one de
,
scribing Nimrod's dominion may also refer to Nimrod,
if we read with the margin, "Out of that land he
went forth to Assyria," instead of " Out of that land
went forth Assur.'' These verses will then read
(Genesis x. 11, 12): "Out of that land he went forth
to Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and the suburbs of
the city, an~ Calah, and Resen, between Nineveh and
Calah: the same is a great city." It must be re
membered, however, that Assur was regarded by the
Assyrians as their supreme god and eponymous
founder, and that in Micah v. 6, "the land of Assur"
and '' the land of Nimrod'' seem to be contrasted with
one another. But it is possible to consider the two



186 PHJJJ IZDUB.AB LEGJJJNDS.
expressions i.ii the latter passage to be both applied
to the same country.
Mter the date of the later books of the Old Testa
ment we know nothing of Nimrod for some time ; it
is probable that he was fully mentioned by Berosus
in his history, but his account of the giant hunter has
been lost. The reason of this appears to be, that a
belief had grown up among early Christian writers
that the Biblical Nimrod was the first king of Baby
lonia after the Flood, and looking at the list of Berosus
they found that after the Flood according to him
Evechous first reigned in Babylonia, and at once
assumed that the Evechous of Berosus was the Nim.
rod of the Bible ; but as Evechous has given to him
the extravagant reign of four ners or 2,400 years,
and his son and successor, Chomasbel~s, four ners
and five sosses, or 2,700 years, this identification gives
little hope of our finding an historical Nimrod.
It is possible that this identification of Nim.
rod with Evechous, made by the early chronolo
gists, has caused them to overlook his name and true
epoch in the list of Berosus, and has thus lost to us
his position in the series of Babylonian sovereigns.
Belonging to the first centuries of the Christian
era are the works of various Jewish and Christian
writers, who have made us familiar with a number of
later traditions concerning Nim.rod. Josephus declares
that he was a prime mover in building the Tower of
Babel,. an enemy of God, and that he reigned at
Babylon during the dispersion. Later writers make



TlIB IZD UBAB LEGENDS. 187
him a contemporary with Abraham, the inventor of
idol worship, and a furious worshipper of :fire. At
the city of Orfa, in Syria, he is said to have cast
Abraham into a burning fiery furnace because he
would not bow down to his idols. These legends
have been taken up by the Arabs, and although his
hi.story has been lost and replaced by absurd and
worthless stories, Nimrod still remains the most pro
minent name in the traditions of the country; every
thing good or evil is attributed to him, and the most
important ruins are even now called after his name.
From the time of the early Christian writers down
to to-day, men have been busy framing systems of
general chronology, and since Nimrod was always
known as a famous sovereign it was necessary to
find a definite place for him in each chronological
scheme. Africanus and Eusebius held that he was
the Evechous of Berosus, and reigned first after the
Flood. Moses of Khorene identified him with Bel,
the great god of B~bylon ; and he is said to have
extended his dominions to the foot of the Armenian
mountains, falling in battle there when attempting
to enforce his authority over Haic, king of Armenia.
Other writers identified Nimrod with Ninus, the
mythical founder of· the city of Nineveh. These
remained the principal identifications before modern
research took up the matter; but so wide a door was
open to conjecture, that one writer actually identified
Nimrod with the Alorus of Berosus, the first king
of Babylonia before the Flood.



188 PHJJJ IZDUBAB LJ!JGENDS.
One of the most curious theories about Nimrod,
suggested in modern times, was grounded on the
" Book of Nabatean Agriculture." This work is &
comparatively mode~ forgery, pretending to be a
literary production of the early Chaldean period.
In this work Nimrod heads a list of Babylonian kings
called Canaanite, and a writer in the "Journal of
Sacred Literature·" has argued with considerable force
in favour of these Canaanites being the Arabs of Be
rosus, who reigned about B.c. 1550 to 1300. The
southern half of Arabia is known as Cush in the Old
Testament like the opposite coast of Africa, and, as
Nimrod is called a Cushite in Genesis, there was a
great temptation to identify him with the leader
of the Arab dynasty. This idea, however, gained
little favour, and has not been held by any sec
tion of inquirers as fixing the position of Nimrod.
The discovery of the cuneiform inscriptions threw a
new light on the subject of Babylonian history, and
soon after the decipherment of the inscriptions atten
tion was directed to the question of the identity and
age of Nimrod. Sir Henry Rawlinson, the father
of Assyrian discovery, first seriously attempted to
fix the name of Nimrod in the cuneiform inscrip
tions, and he endeavoured to find the name in that
of the second god of the great Chaldean triad. (See
Rawlinson's "Ancient Monarchies," vol. i. p. 117.)
The names of this deity are really Enu, Elum, and
Bel, and he was evidently worshipped at the dawn of
Babylonian history, and is in fact rep~esented as one



THE IZDUB.AB LEGENDS. 189
of the creators of the world; time, moreover, has
shown that the cuneiform characters on which the
identification was grounded do not bear the phonetic
values then supposed.
Sir Henry Rawlinson also suggested (" Ancient
Monarchies," p. 136) that the god Nergal was a deifi
cation of Nimrod. Nergal, however, which means
literally "the illuminator of Hades,'' was a god of the
lower world, and even if Nimrod was deified under
the name of Nergal this does not explain his position
or epoch.
Canon Rawlinson, brother of Sir Henry, in the
first volume of his "An~ient Monarchies," p. 153,
and following, makes some judicious remarks on the
chronological position of Nimrod, and suggests that
he may have reigned a century or two before B.~.
2286; he asserts the historical character of his reign,
and supposes him to have founded the Babylonian
monarchy, but does not himself identify him with
any king known from the inscriptions. At the time
when this was written (1871), the conclusions of
Canon Rawlinson were the most satisfactory that
had been advanced since the discovery of the cunei
•
form inscriptions. Since this time, how~ver, some
new theories have been started, with the idea of
identifying Nimrod ; one of these, brought forward
by Professor Oppert, makes the word a geographical
term, but such an explanation is evidently quite
insufficient to account for the traditions attached to
the name.



190 THE IZDUB.AB LEGENDS.
Another theory brought forward by the Rev. A.
H. Sayce and Josef Grivel, " Transactions of Society
of Biblical Archreology," vol. ii. part 2, p. 243, and vol
iii. part 1, p. 136, identifies Nimrod with Merodach,
the god of Babylon; partly on the ground of the
similarity of name, Merodach being Amar-utuci or
Amar-ud in Accadian, partly because Merodach the
patron-deity of Babylon stood in the same relation to
that city that Asshur did to Assyria (see Micah v. 6),
and partly since we find Merodach called " a hero "
like Nimrod in Genesis, and assigned " four divine
dogs" as though he were a hunter. These dogs are
Uccumu '' the despoiler," Accnlu '' the devourer,"
lcsuda ''the capturer," and lltebu "the carrier away."
Merodach, it must be remembered, is always repre
sented ·as a man, and is armed with weapons of
war.
Mr. Smith first fancied that Nimrod might be
Khammuragas, whom he identified with the first
Arab king of Berosus, as thi-: line of kings appeared
to be connected with the Cossm,,ns. This identification
failing, after the discovery of~. the Deluge tablet in
1872, he conjectured that the hero whose name is
provisionally read lzdubar is the Nimrod of the
Bible, a conjecture which has since been adopted by
several other scholars.
The supposition that Nimrod was an ethnic or
geographical name, which was at one time favoured
by Sir Henry Rawlinson, and has since been urged
by Professor Oppert, is quite untenable, for it would



THE IZDUBAB LFJGFJNDS. 191
be impossible on this theory to account for certain
features in what we are told of the hero.
Mr. Smith's opinion that he was the hero of the
lzdubar Epic was first founded on the discovery that
the latter formed the centre of the national historical
poetry, and was the hero of Babylonian legend-in
fact, occupies much the same place as Nimrod in later
Arab tradition.
lzdubar, moreover, agrees exactly in character with
Nimrod; he was a hunter, according to the cuneiform
legends, who contended with and destroyed the lion,
tiger, leopard, and wild bull or buffalo, animals the
most formidable in the chase in any country. He
ruled first in Babylonia over the region which from
other sources we know to have been the centre of
Nimrod's kingdom. The principal scene, too, of his
exploits and triumphs was the city of Erech, which,
according to Genesis, was the second capital of
Nimrod.
There remains the fact that the cuneiform name of
this hero is undeciphered, the name lzdubar being a
mere makeshift. It is possible that when the phonetic
reading of the characters is found it will turn out to
correspond with the name Nimrod. At all events it
is noteworthy that lzdubar seems to have been spe
cially connected with the town of Marad, the original
Accadian name of which was Amarda, and that the
Accadian an Amarda, or '' god of Amarda,'' closely
corresponds with the Biblical name of Nimrod. The
translations and notes given in this book will lead,

perhaps, to the general admission of the identity of
the hero lzdubar with the traditional Nimrod ; but
this result can be firmly established only when more
evidence is before us than that which we have at
present.
At the time of the opening of the Epic, the great
city of the south of Babylonia, and the capital of this
part of the country, was Uruk, called in Genesis,
Erech. Erech was devoted to the worship of Anu,
the god of heaven, and his wife, the goddess Anatu,
as well as of Istar, the Phrenician Ashtoreth, or
Astarte, the myth of whose love for the Sun-god
Dumuzi or Tammuz, the Adonis of Greek story, is
alluded to in the course of the poem. The worship
of Anatu, however, was subsequent to the Semitic
occupation of the country, since the necessity of pro
viding a female d•eity by the side of every male one
was not felt until the Accadians, whose language was
unacquainted with genders, were succeeded by the Se
mites with their nouns either masculine or feminine.
Here may provisionally be placed the first fragment
of the lzdubar legends, K 3200. This fragment con
sists of part of the third column of a tablet, which is
probably the first ; and it gives an account of a
conquest of Erech by its enemies. The fragment
.reads:
1. his . . . . . he left

dence. They may have been the Semitic successors
of the Accadians, they may have been the Medes of
Berosus, or they may have been tribes who belong
only to the realm of mythology. Mr. Smith believed
that they were the subjects of Khumbaba, the tyrant
whose death is related in the fourth book of the Epic,
and who ruled over the land of Elam.
The name of Khumbaba, or Khubaba, as it is
occasionally written, is probably a compound of
"Khumba," or "Khumbume," the name of one of
the chief Elamite gods. Many other Elamite names
compounded with Khumba are mentioned in the
inscriptions: Khumba-sidir, an early chief; Khumba
undasa, an Elamite general opposed to Sennacherib ;
Khumba-nigas, an Elamitemonarch opposedto Sargon;
Tul-khumba, an Elamite city, &c.
The notice of foreign dominion, and particularly
of Elamite supremacy at this time, may, perh~ps,
form a clue from which to ascertain the approximate
age of the poems as we have them. We know that
myths are localized in the country of those who hand
them down to posterity, and assigned to an age which
has made an impression on their narrators. There
must have been some reason for the legendary siege
and capture of Erech, some actual event around which
the story of lzdubar has entwined itself.
Looking at the fragments of Berosus and the no
tices of Greek and Roman authors, we may ask
whether there is any epoch of conquest and foreign
dominion which can be fixed upon as representing
•



THE IZDUBAB LEGENDS. . 195
such an actual event? Let us glance for a moment
at the earlier history of Babylonia so far as it is known
to us.
'fhe earlier part of the list of dynasties quoted from
Berosus gives the following periods from the Flood
downwards :
86 Chaldean kings from the Flood down to the
Median conquest, reigning for 34,080 or 33,091
years.
8 Median kings who conquered and held Babylon,
234, or 224, or 190 years.
11 other kings, race and duration unknown.
. 49 Chaldean kings, for 458 years.
The last of these dynasties preceded a dynasty of
kings called Arabian by the copyists of Berosus, and
though neither the number of the reigns_ nor the
length of time assigned to the dynasty agrees with
what the monuments tell us of the Cassite or Cossrean
line of kings, there is no other line which can in any
way be identified with the Arabians of the Babylonian
historian. The 49 Chaldean kings must, therefore,
have reigned before Khammuragas, that is before B.c
2000-1750. Now an inscription of Nabonidus in
forms us that Lig-bagas, the first monarch of all
Chaldea of whom we know, :flourished 700 years ante
rior to the reign of Khammuragas; hewould, therefore,
come among the 11 nameless kings of Berosus, sup
posing any reliance can be placed on the statements
of the latter, and about 250 years before the accession
of the Chaldean dynasty. But the engraved cylinders
•



196 TIIE IZD UB.AB LEGENDS.
and seals of the age of Lig-bagas show that the legend
of lzdubar was already popular, and we must accord
ingly seek a still older period in which to place its
origin and attachment to a particular historical event.
Hence it may well be that the siege of Erech, the
memory of which is preserved in the first book of the
lzdubar Epic, was the work of those foreign invaders
whom the Babylonian historian has termed Median.
Now it is not improbable that the Median dynasty
was really Elamite; or at all events belonged to the
same race as the primitive inhabitants of Elam.
This race was closely allied to the Accadians; and it
was spread over the whole range of country which
stretched from the southern shores of the Caspian to
the Persian Gulf. The Protomedes, as they are
sometimes called, were not conquered and supplanted
by Aryan invaders from the east till the ninth century
B.c. It was in their country that Kharsak-kurra,
"the Mountain of the East," was localized whereon
the Accadians and their kinsfolk in Elam and Media
believed the ark.to have rested after the Flood, and
which they regarded as the cradle of their race. It
was therefore pre-eminently 1'' the land," mada in
Accadian, and from this mada there is every reason
to think the name of Media has been derived. Conse
quently, the Medians of Berosus, the inhabitants of
mada " the land " of the east, need not have been
more than one of the many Elamite swarms that
from time to time descended into the fertile plains of
Babylonia, and 11ot unfrequently obtained a settlement

to "Gibil-dur (or Ne-Zicum), the brother of the
king of Erech, the librarian, thy servant." All we
can gather from it is that the famous library of Erech,
which furnished Assur-bani-pal and his scribes with
the original texts of the lzdubar Epic, was already in
existence, and that the office of librarian was con
sidered honourable enough to be borne by a brother
of the reigning monarch.
If the legendary siege of Erech is not to be referred
to the epoch of the Median conquest, it may have
fallen at the time when the image of the goddess
Nana was carried away from Erech by the Elamite
king Kudur-nankhundi, 1635 years before the cap
ture of Shushan, the capital of Elam, by the As
syrians (about B.c. 645 ), and consequently about
B.c. 2280. A fragment which refers to this period in
" Cuneiform Inscriptions," vol. iii. p. 38, relates the
destruction wrought in the country by the Elamites,
an·d makes Kudur-nankhundi follow one of the other
monarchs of an Elamite dynasty and exceed his pre
decessors in the injury he did to the country.
Putting together the detached notices of this
period, the following may approximately represent
the chronology, the dates being understood as round
numbers.
? B.c. 2750, Elamites (Medes) overrun Bab~ylonia.
B.c. 2280, Kudur-nankhundi, king of Elam, ravages
Erech.
B.c. 1800, Khammuragas conquers Babylonia.
Although the dates transmitted through ancient



TH:E IZDUB.AB LEGENDS. 199
authors are as a rule vague and doubtful, there are
many independent notices which seem to point to
somewhere about the twenty-third century before
the Christian era for the foundation of the Baby
lonian and Assyrian power. Several of these dates
are connected either directly or by implication with
Nimrod, who first formed a united empire over these
•
regions.
The following are some of these notices :
Simplicius relates that Callisthenes, the friend of
Alexander, sent to Aristotle from Babylon a series of
stellar observations reaching back 1,903 years before
the taking of Babylon by Alexander. This would
make 1903+331= B.c. 2234.
Berosus and Critodemus are said by Pliny to have
made the inscribed stellar observations reach to 480
years before the era of Phoroneus ; as t~e latter date
was supposed to be about the middle of the eighteenth
century B.c., 480 years before it comes also to about
the period of Kudur-nankhundi.
Diodorus makes the Assyrian empire commence a
thousand years or more before the Trojan war.
Ctesias and Cephalion make its foundation early
in the twenty-second century B.c.
The two last statements, however, are probably de
rived from Ctesias, whose so-called history has been
sho,vn by cuneiform decipherment to have been a
mere fiction put together out of misunderstood myths
and fragments of theology. In any case, too, they
apply only to the foundation of the Assyrian power,

showing lzdubar and Hea-bani struggling with wild
animals. In all these cases, and in every other
instance where lzdubar is represented, he is indicated
as a man with masses of curls over his head and a
large curly beard. The type is so ·marked and so
distinct from either the Assyrian or the Babylonian
one that it is hard to say to what race it should be at
tached.
The deity of lzdubar was Lugal-turda, the god who
was changed into the bird of storm according to the
old myth, from which it may be supposed that he was
a native of the district of Amarda or Marad, where
that god was worshipped. This district Mr. Smith
thought was probably the Amordacia or Mardocrea of
Ptolemy, but its situation is uncertain.
The fragments of the second and third tablets
assume by their notices that lzdubar was already
known as a mighty hunter, and it appears a little
later that he claimed descent from the old BabyIonian
heroes, as he calls Xisuthrus, the Chaldean Noah, his
" father."
TABLET II.
A single fragment which Mr. Smith believed to
belong to this tablet has been found; it is K 3389, ,
and contains part of the third and fourth columns of
writing. It appears from this that Izdubar was
then at Erech, and had a curious dream. He thought
he saw the stars of heaven fall to the ground,
and in their descent they struck upon his back. He



.AND IZDUB.AB. 203
then saw standing over him a terrible being, the aspect
of whose face was fierce, and who was armed with
claws, like the claws of lions. The greater part of
the description of the dream is lost; it probably
occupied Columns I. and II. of the second tablet.
Thinking that the dream portended some fate to
himself, Izdubar calls on all the wise men to explain
it, and offers a reward to any one who can interpret
the dream. Here the fragment K 3389 comes in:

The first part of this fragment appears to recount
the honours offered by Izdubar to any one who should
interpret the dream. These included the ennobling
of his family, .his recognition in assemblies, his
being i11vested with jewels. of honour, and his wives
being increased. A description of the dream of
the hero, much mutilated, follows. ~he conduct
of Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel, with
reference to his dreams, bears some resemblance to
that of Izdubar.
After this fragment we have again a blank in the
story, and it would appear that in this interval
application was made to a nondescript creature named
Hea-bani that he would go to the city of Erech a11d
interpret the dream of Izdubar. ·
Hea-bani appears, from the representations on seals
and other objects on which he is figured, to have
been a satyr or faun. He is always drawn with the
feet and tail of an ox, and with horns on his head.
He is said to have lived in. a cave among the wild
animals of the forest, and was supposed to posses~
wonderful knowledge both of nature and human
affairs. In appearance he resembles the se'irim or
hairy demons, half men, half goats, who inhabited the



AND IZD UBAR. 205
deserts and were a terror to passers-by. Reference
is made to them in Lev. xvii. 7, 2 Chron. xi. 15, Is.
xiii. 21, xxxiv. 14, from which we learn that worship
was paid to them, and that they were supposed to be
specially connected with the neighbourhood of Baby
lon. Hea-bani was angry at the request that he
should abando11 his solitary life for the friendship of
lzdubar, and where our narrative reopens the god
Samas is persuading him to accept the offer. It may
be added that the na.me Hea-bani signifies '' Hea
created me," from which we may infer that the mon
ster was believed to have originally ascended like
Oannes out of the abysses of the sea.

Here we are still dealing with the honours which
lzdubar promises to the interpreter of his dream,
and these seem to show that lzdubar had some power
a.t Erech at this time; he does not, however, appear
to have been an independent king, and it is probable
that the next two columns of this tablet, now lost,
contain negotiations for bringing Hea-bani to Erech,
the subject being continued on the third tablet.

There is one other mutilated fragment of this and
the next column with part of a relation respecting
beasts and a fragment of a conversation between lzdu
bar and his mother.
The whole of this tablet is curious, and it certainly
gives the successful issue of the attempt to bring
Hea-bani to Erech, and in very fragmentary condition
the dream of the monarch.
It appears tl1at the females Samkhat and Kharimtu.
prevailed upon Hea-bani to come to Erech and see the
exploits of the giant lzdubar, and he declared that he
would bring a Midannu, most probably a tiger, to
Erech, in order to make t1-ial of the strength of lzdu
bar, and to see if he could destroy it.
The Midannu is mentioned in the Assyrian texts
as a fierce carnivorous animal allied to the lion and
leopard ; it is called Midannu, Mindinu, and Mandinu.
In a list of animals it is associated with the dumamu
or cat.
In the fifth column, after the description of the
festivities which followed the arrival of Hea-bani,
there appears a break between lines 15 and 16, some
part of the original story being probably omitted
here. The Assyrian copy probably is h~re de

fective, at least one line being lost. The portion
here omitted seems to have stated that the following
speech was made by the mother of lzdubar, who
figures prominently in the earlier part of these
legends.

god Khumba or Khumbume makes it possible that
he was originally identical with the latter. In this
case the antagonism between Khumbaba and lzdubar
would have been merely a reflection of the an
tagonism that existed between the inhabitants of
Babylonia and the subjects of the Elamite empire.
Mr. Smith even thought that the overthrow of Khum
baba might have been an echo of the overthrow of
some Elamite dynasty by a Chaldean one.
In the case of the fourth tablet Mr. Smith believed
that he had found fragments of all six columns, but
some of these fragments are useless until we have
further fragments to complete them.

Here we see that lzdubar, impressed with the
magnitude of the task he had undertaken, makes a
prayer and sacrifice to Samas to aid him in his task.
The next fragment appears also to belong to this
column, and may refer to preliminaries for sacrificing
to Istar, with a view also to gain her aid in the
enterprise.

Somewhere here should be the story, now lost, of
the starting of lzdubar on his expedition accompa
nied by his friend Hea-bani. The sequel shows they
arrive at the palace or residence of Hea-bani, which
is surrounded by a forest of pine and cedar, the whole
being enclosed by some barrier or wall, with a gate
for entrance. Hea-bani and lzdubar open this gate

Here we see Khumbaba waiting for the intruders,
but the rest of the column is lost ; it appears to have
principally consisted of speeches by lzdubar and·
Hea-bani on the magnificent trees they saw, and the
work before them. A single fragment of Column VI.,
containing fragments of six lines, show:s theni still

description of the retreat of Khumbaba, have as yet
been discovered.

triumph of lzdubar are given at the commencement

of the sixth tablet. The conquest of Khumbaba
gave lzdubar the crown and attributes of his fallen
rival, who seems to have been a sun-god, and this
caused !star, who already appears as the bride of the
sun in t~e myth of Tammuz, to woo the triumphant
hero.

It is uncertain if any other portion of this tablet has
been found, but part of a remarkable fragment, with
a continuation of the story of Istar, has been placed
here. It appears that the goddess, failing in her at
tempt in heaven to avenge herself on Izdubar for his
slight, resolved to descend to hell, to search out, if
possible, new modes of attacking him.

being absent. It would seem that Hea-bani is here
telling his friend how he must die and descend into the
house of Hades. Mr. Smith, however, thought that
in the third column some one is speaking to !star,
trying to persuade her not to descend to Hades, while
in the fourth column the goddess, who is suffering all
the pangs of jealousy and hate, revels in the dark
details of the description of the lower regions, and
· declares her determination to go there.



288 THE .ADYENTUBES OF ISP.AB.
If this view is correct, this part of the legend would
be connected with the beautiful story of the Descent
of Istar into Hades which describes how the goddess
descended into the lower world in search of her
husband Tammuz, the Sun-god, who had been slain
by the boar's tusk of winter. Tammuz became
Adonis, the Phrenician adonai "lord,'' among the
Greeks, to whom the story of Aphrodite and Adonis
had been carried by the Phrenicians. The story is
one which meets us in the mythologies of many races
and nations throughout the worl~, and has grown in
each case out of the winter-sleep of the sun and his
resurrection in the spring. Its last-echo in our own
European folklore may be heard in the tale of the
Sleeping Beauty. A calendar found among the bank
ing records of the Egibi firm in Babylonia notes on
the 15th day of the month Tammuz or June '' an
eclipse of the Moon," apparently in reference to the
descent of the Moon-goddess Istar into Hades. The
lege11d survives in a changed form in the Talmud
(Yoma 69b, Sanhedri1n 60a). Here it is said that
after the Captivity the elders of the nation, headed
by Ezra and Nehemiah, besought God that the demon
of lust might be delivered into their hands. In spite
of a prophetic voice which warned them of the con
sequences of their request, it was persisted in, and
the demon was given up to them and imprisoned.
But before three da:ys were over, the whole course of
the world was thrown into disorder. No eggs even
were to be had, and the Jewish elders were obliged

to confess their mistake and release the demon from
his fetters.

This remarkable text shows Istar fnlfilling her
threat and descending to Hades, but it does not ap
pear that she had as yet accomplished her vengeance
against lzdubar.
At the opening of the sixth tablet we have the
1 Tillili, the Accadian name of Kharimat, is here used. Tillili was
the wife of the Sun-god Alala symbolized by the eagle, which we are
told was " the 1ymbol of the southern " or " meridian sun.'' What Sir H. Rawlinson calls the monotheistic party among the Babyloniana resolved Tillili into Anatu and Alala into Anu.



· PHI!r .ADYI!JNTUBEB OF IST.AB. 24.i'
final scene of the contest with Khumbaba. lzdubar,
after slaying Khumbaba, takes the crown from the
head of the monarch and places it on his own
head, thus signifying that he assumed the empire.
.There were, as we are informed in several places,
-kings, lords, and princes, merely local rulers, but
these generally submitted to the greatest power;
and just as they had bowed to Khumbaba, so they
were ready now to submit to Izdubar. The kingdom
promised to lzdubar when he started to encounter
Khumbaba now became his by right of superior force,
and he entered the halls of the palace of ·Erech and
feasted with his heroes.
We are thus brought to a curious part of the story,
the romance of Izdubar and Istar. One of the strange
and dark features of the Babylonian religion was the
Istar or Venus worship, which was an adoration of
the reproductive power of nature, accompanied by
ceremonies which were a reproach to the country.
The city of Erech, originally a seat of the worship of
Anu, was now· one of the foremost cities in this
Istar worship. Tammuz, the young and beautiful
Sun-god, the dead bridegroom of Istar, seems to be
also spoken of as the brother of her handmaid Khari
mat. This explains, as M. Lenormant has pointed
out, the passage in Jeremiah xxii. 18, which preserves
a portion ofthe wailing cry uttered by the worshippers
of Tammuz or Adonis when celebrating his untimely
death. This should be rendered: u Ah me. my
brother, and ah me, my sister! Ah me, Adonis, and

"II mito di Adone-Tammuz,'' 1879, upon the basis
of the one made by Dr. Oppert.
The story of the descent of Istar into Hades is
one of the most beautiful myths in the Assyrian
inscriptions; it has, however, received so much atten
tion, and been so fully commented upon by variou~
-scholars, that little need be said on the subject here.
It is evident that we are dealing with the same
goddess as the Istar, daughter of Anu, in the Izdu
bar legends, although she is here called daughter of
Sin (the moon-god).
The description of the region of Hades is most
graphic, and vividly portrays the sufferings of the
prisoners there. Atsu-sunamir, created by Hes to
deliver Istar, is described_ as a composite animal,
half bitch and half man, with more than one head,
and corresponds with the two dogs of the Hindu
Rig~Veda, which have four eyes and broad snouts,
and _guard the road to the abode of Yama the king
of the departed. They are also said to move among
men, feasting on their lives, as. the messengers of
Yama; and as the offspring of Saram&, the dawn,
they are called S&rameyas, which Prof. Max Miiller
compares with the Greek Hermes. At any rate, the
same conception of a dog of the dawn which guards
the approach to the realm of Hades is found in the
Greek Kerberos with his fifty heads (or three heads,
according to later writers), as well as in the dog of
Geryon named Orthros or "the dawn," who seems to
be identical with the Vedic Vritra the demon of

It must here be noted that Mr. Smith's grounds for
making this the eighth tablet were extremely doubtful,
and it is possible that the fragments are of different
tablets; but they fill up an evident blank in the story
here, and they are consequently inserted pending fur
ther discoveries as to their true position.
In the first column Hea-bani appears to be address
ing certain trees, and they are supposed to have the
power of hearing and answering him.. Hea-bani
praises one tree and sneers at another, but from the
mutilation of the text it does not appear why he acts
so. We may conjecture he was seeking a charm to open
a door he mentions, and that according to the story
this charm was known to the trees. The fragment of
the sixth column shows Hea-bani unable to interpret
a dream, while lzdubar asks his friend to :fight.
After this happened the violent death of Hea-bani,
· which added to the misfortunes of Izdubar ; but no
fragment of this part of the story is preserved.

TABLET IX.
This tablet is in a somewhat better state than th~
others, and all the narrative is clearer from this point,
not a single column of the inscription being e~tirely
lost. The ninth tablet commences with the sorrow
of Izdubar at the death of Rea-bani.

The second column shows Izdubar in some fabulous
region, whither he has wandered in search of Xisu
thrus. Here he sees composite monsters with their feet
resting in Hades and their heads reaching heaven.
These beings are supposed to guide and direct the
sun at its rising and setting. This passage is as
follows:
COLUMN II.
1. Of the mountains hearing him as many as ...•
2. To the mountain of Masu in his course . . . •

4. Their crown was at the lattice of heaven,
5. below Hades was their footing.
6. Scorpion-men guard its gate,
7. burning with terribleness, and their appearance
was death,
8. the greatness of their bulk overthrows the
forests.
9. At the rising of the sun and the setting of the
sun, they guard the sun, and
10. lzdubar saw them and fear and terror seized
his face.

11. He took his counsel and approached before
them.
12. The scorpion-man of his female asked: .
13. Who has gone to us with his body the flesh of

14. To the scorpion-man his fem.ale answered:
15. His going (is) that of a god, but his feeble gait
(is) that of a man.

was stayed, the raging whirlwind

23. was quieted. The sea began to dry, and the
wind and deluge ended.
24. I watched the sea making a noise,

50. the gods like flies over the sacrificer gathered.
51. From afar also the great goddess at her
approach
52. lifted up the mighty arches (i.e. the rainbow)
which Anu had created as his glory.
53. The crystal of those gods before me (i.e. the
rainbow) never ID:ay I forget; •

6. From afar also Bel at his approach
7. saw, the ship he stopped; Bel was filled with
anger against the gods and the spirits of heaven :
8. 'Let no one come out alive, never may a man
live in the abyss.'
9. Ninip his mouth opened, and spake; he says to
the warrior Bel:
10. 'Who is it except Hea that forms a resolu

the warrior Bel :

288 THE STOBY OF THE FLOOD
14. as thou didst not consider a deluge thou
madest.
15. The doer of sin bore his sin, the blasphemer
bore his blasphemy.
16. Never may the just prince be cut off, never may
the faithful (be destroyed).
17. Instead of thy making ..a deluge, may lions
come and men be diminished;
18. instead of thy making a deluge, may hyrenas
come and men be diminished;
19. instead of thy making a deluge, may a famine
happen and the country be (destroyed);
20. instead of thy making adeluge, may pestilence
come and men be destroyed.
21. I did not reveal the judgment of the gods.
22. To Adrahasis (Xisuthrus) a dream I sent, and
the judgment of the gods he heard.'
23. Again also Bel considers, (literally, again con
sideration was considered); he approaches the midst
of the ship.
24. He took my hand and caused me to ascend up,
25. he caused (me) to ascend; he united my wife
to my side;
26. he turned unto us and fixes himself in covenant
with us; he approaches us :
27. ' Formerly Adrakhasis (was} mortal, but
28. again also Adrakhasis and his wife to live as
gods are taken away, and
29. Adrakhasis also dwells in a remote place at the
mouth of the rivers.'

30. They took me, and in a remote place at the
mouth of the rivers they caused me to dwell.
31. Again also as for thee whomsoever the gods
have chosen also,
32. for the health which thou seekest and askest,
33. the bulwarks shall be mounted six days and
seven nights,
34. like one who sits in the vicinity of his nest,
35. a way like a storm shall be laid upon him.
36. Adrakhasis to her also says, even to his
wife:
37. I announce that the chief who has sought
health
38. the way like a storm shall be laid upon him.
39. His wife to him also says even to Adrakhasis
afar off:
40. Turn him, and let the man be· sent away;
41. by the road that he came may he return in
peace,
42. thro' the great gate going forth let him return
to his country.
43. Adrakhasis to her also says, even to his
wife:
44. The pain of the man pains thee,

head.
46. And the day when he had mounted the side of
the ship,

head.

The opening line of the next tablet is preserved,
it reads : " The gad-fly in the house of the serving
man was left." After this the story is again lost for
several lines, and where it reappears lzdubar is
mourning for Hea-bani.
The fragments of this tablet are :

was left.

him, and
21. her feet like a deep well beget [or darken]

This is the bottom of the first column. The next
column has lost all the upper part: it appears to have
contained the remainder of this lament, an appeal to
one of the gods on behalf of Rea-bani, and a repetition
of the lamentation, the third person being used in
stead of the second. The fragments commence in
the middle of this :
I. his wife whom he hates he strikes,
2. his child whom he loves he kisses;
3. his child whom he has hated he strikes,
4. the destruction of the earth takes him.
5. Ninazu, of darkness the mother of darkness, of

AND OONOL USION. 80]
The episode of the Flood has been introduced into
the lzdubar Epic in accordance with the principle
upon which it has been formed. The eleventh tablet
or book answers to the sign of Aquarius a11d the
month called "the rainy" by the Accadians, and it
was therefore rightly occupied by the story of the
Flood. The compiler of the Epic seems to have used
for this purpose two independent poems relating to
the event ; at least it is otherwise difficult to account
for the repetitions observable in certain lines which
sometimes differ slightly from one another, as well as
for certain inconsistencies which the skill of the com
piler has not been able entirely to remove. Thus ac
cording to I. 13, the Deluge was caused by all "the
great gods; '' according to II. 30, by Samas only;
according to IV. 4, 5, by Bel. There is little doubt
that many independent versions of the history of the
Deluge were current in a poetical form; indeed, a
fragment of one of these, containing the original Ac
cadian text along with the Assyrian translation has
been preserved, and the version found in Berosus
differs in several notable points from the version em
bodied in the great Chaldean Epic.
The fragment of the variant version of which the
Accadian text has been preserved is as follows :
. 1. . . . . then like a bowl of sacrificial wine the
mountain ... .
2. . . . . country to country ran together.
3. The female-slave to her mother ( ?) it had

If we compare the Babylonian account of the
Deluge contained in the Epic with the account in
Genesis we shall find some differences between them;
but ifwe consider the differences that existed between
the two countries of Palestine and Babylonia these
variations do not appear greater than we should
expect. Chaldea was essentially a mercantile and
maritime country, well watered and flat, while Pales
tine was a hilly region with no great rivers, and the
Jews were shut out from the coast, the maritime



.AND OONOL UBION. 803
regions being mostly in the hands of the Philistines·
and Phmnicians. There was a total difference be
tween the religious ideas of the two peoples, the
Jews believing in one God, the creator and lord of
the Universe, while the Babylonians worshipped gods
and lords many, every city having its local deity,
and these b~ing joined by complicated relations in a
poetical mythology, which was in marked contrast
to the severe siinplicity of the Jewish system. With
such differences it was only natural that, in relating
the same stories, each nation should colour them in
accordance with its own ideas, and stress would
naturally in each case be laid upon points with which
·they were familiar. Thus we should expect before
hand that there would be differences in the narrative
such as we actually find, and we may also notice that
the cuneiform account does not always coincide even
with the account of the same events given by Berosus
from Chaldean sources, from which, as already ob
served, we may infer that there was more than one
version of the story of the Deluge current in Baby
lonia itself.
The great value of the inscriptions describing the
Flood consists in the fact that they form an μ}de
pendent testimony to the Biblical narrative at a much
earlier date than any other evidence. 1The principal
points in the two narratives compared in their order
will serve to show the correspondences and diffe
rences between the two. It must, however, be re
member~d that the Biblical narrative is composed of

two different accounts of the Flood, generally known
as the Elohistic and Jehovistic, and, as M. Lenormant
has observed, it is with the union of the two in our

them alone that the Babylonian version corresponds.

One of the first points that strike us on comparing
the Biblical and cuneiform accounts together is that
they both agree in representing the Flood as a punish
. ment for the sins of mankind. This agreement is
rendered remarkable by the absence of such a moral
cause in the legends of a deluge current among other
nations ; it is wanting even in the version of the
Babylonian account given by Berosus. Equa]Jy re
markable is the agreement of the two accounts in the
narrative of the sending forth of the birds, two of
which, the raven and the dove, are the same in both.
Some of the actual phrases and words found in Genesis
are also found in the cuneiform tablet; though some
times they are modified, as when Genesis says of the
entrance of Noah into the ark : " The Lord shut him
in;" whereas in the Babylonian narrative the closing
of the door is ascribed to Xisuthrus himself.
Positive discrepancies, however, occur between the
two records. Thus they differ as regards the size of
the ark. According to the cuneiform account, its
length and breadth were in the proportion of ten to
X



306 THE BTOBY OF THE FLOOD
one and the height and breadth were the same ; but
the ·Bible makes the proportion as six to one, and
describes the height as being thirty cubits and the
breadth fifty. The version of the story given by
. ..
Berosus, on the other hand, agrees in this matter
neither with Genesis nor with the- tablet from Erech.
It measures the ark by stadia and not by cubits,
makes the proportion of its length a~d breadth as
:five to two, and says nothing of the height.
Another .difference may be found in the description
of the patriarch who escapes the Flood. Xisuthrus is
a king who enters the ark with his servants, people,
and pilot, while in the Bible only Noah and his family
are saved. So, too, no reference is made in the Baby
lonian account to the distinction between the clean
and unclean animals mentioned by the Jehovist,
though seven was a sacred number among the Baby
lonians. The most remarkable differenc~, however,
between the -two accounts is with respect to the
duration of the Deluge. On this point the inscription
gives seven days for the Flood, and seven days for the
resting of the ark on the mountain, while the Elohist
puts the commencement of the Flood on the 17th day
of the second month (Marchesvan) and its termination
on the 27th day of the second month in the following
year, making a total duration of one lunar year and
eleven days. _This exactly accords with the climatic
''
conditions of Babylonia, where the rains begin at the
end of November. The Euphrates and Tigris then
begin to rise, the country is inundated in March, the



........ --
AND OONOL USION. 307
seventh month of the Hebrew narrative, and from
the end of May onwards the waters go down. Accord
ing to the Jehovist, however, the Deluge is ann~unced
to Noah only seven days before it takes place; the
waters are at their height for forty days and then
•"&? - - ·--------- . ihe

· mus-.; ue uue to a scnoe·s error, since tn1s would
place the Flood at a time when the waters were going
down. There is again a difference as to the mountain
on which the ark rested; Nizir, the place mentioned
in tl1e cuneiform text, being east of Assyria,_ and its
mountain, also called "the mountain of the world "
where the gods were supposed to dwell, being the
present peak.ofElwend, while the mountains of Ararat
mentioned in the Bible were north of Assyria, near
Lake Van. It is evident that different traditions have
placed the mountain of the ark in totally different
positions, and there is not positive proof as to which
is the earlier traditionary spot. The word Ararat is
connected with a word Urdhu1 meaning "highland,"
and might ·be a general term for any part of the
hilly country to the north-east of Assyria.
?•



808 THE STORY OF THE FLOOD
It is interesting to find references in the Jehovistic
account to the sacred Babylonian number seven and
the seven-day week. Just as Xisuthrus set vessels by
sevens on the altar of sacrifice, so Noah offered clean
beasts and fowls which had been taken by sevens
into the ark. And the narrative of the sending~out
of the birds contains a clear reference to the seven
day week, which was known from very early times
to the Accadians, who had named each day after one
of the seven planets. The Sabbath also, which oc
curred on the 7th, 14th, 19th, 21st and 28th days of
the lunar month, was rigorously observed by them.
They called it "a day of completion of labours," or
"a day unlawful to work upon," and a sort of saints'
calendar for the month of the intercalatory Elul says
that upon it" the shepherd of many peoples may not
eat the flesh of birds (?) or cooked fruit. The gar
ments of his body he must not change. White robes
he may not put on. Sacrifice he may not offer. The
king in his chariot may not ride. He may not legis
late in royal fashion. A place of garrison the general
by word of mouth may not appoint. Medicine for
the sickness of the body one may not apply." The
very word Sabattu or Sabbath was used by the
Assyrians, and a bilingual tablet explains it as " a
day of rest for the heart.'' .
One striking difference between the descriptions of
the Deluge given in the Old Testament and in the
Epic of lzdubar is due to the fact that the Hebrews
were an inland people, whereas the Accadians were a



.AND OONOLUBION. 309
maritime, or rather fluviatile one. Hence it is that
while the ark is called in the Babylonian version "a
ship," it is called tebah, that is, "a coffer" in Genesis.
In Genesis, too, nothing is said about launching the
ark, testing its seaworthiness, or entrusting it to a
pilot. However, the narrative in Genesis preserves a
recollection of the bitull':1en for which the Babylonian
plain was famous, .and like the cuneiform narrative
states that the ark was pitched.
Some of the other differences observable in the
two accounts are evidently due to the opposite
religious systems of the two countries, but there is
again a curious point in connection with the .close of
the Chaldean legend: this is the translation of the
hero of the Flood.
In the Book of Genesis it is not Noah but the
seventh patriarch Enoch who is translated, three
generations before the Flood.
There appears to have been some connection
or confusion between Enoch and Noah in ancient
tradition; both are holy men, and Enoch is said, like
Noah, to have predicted the Flood.
It is a curious fact that the dynasty of gods, with
which Egyptian mythical history commences, re
sembles in some respects the list of antediluvian
kings of Babylonia given by Berosus as well as the
list of antediluvian patriarchs in Genesis.
This dynasty has sometimes seven, sometimes ten
reigns, and in the Turin Papyrus ·of kings, which
gives ten reigns, there is the same name for the



310 THE BTOBY OF THE FLOOD
seventh and tenth kings, both being called Horus,
a11d the seventh king is stated to have reigned 800
years, which is the length of life of the seventh pa
triarch Enoch after the birth of his son.
Here are the three lists of Egyptian gods, Hebrew
patriarchs, and Chaldean kings. ·
Egypt. Patriarchs. Chaldean Kings.
Ptah. Adam. Alorus.
Ra. Seth. Alaparus.
Su. Enos. Almelon.
Seb. Cainan. Ammenon.
Hosiri. Mahalaleel. Amegalarus.
Set. Jared. Daonus. (Dun in
the inscriptions.)
Hor. · Enoch. £dorachus.
Tut. Methuselah. Amempsin.
Ma. Lamech. Otiartes (Opartes).
Hor. Noah. Xisuthrus.
It is well known that Enos, like Adam, signifies
"man;" hence some writers have supposed that the
list of Noah's ancestors was originally counted from
Enos, so that Lamech, Noah's father, would have been
the seventh in descent. There is, moreover, a curious
resemblance between the names of the descendants of
Seth and those of the descendants of Cain, Methuse
..
lah, indeed, being apparently more correctly written
Methusael (Gen. iv. 18), which is the Assyrian Mutu
sa-ili, '' Man of God." Now Lamech, the descendan~



AND OONO L USION. 311
of Cain, is the seventh from Adam. It may be noticed
that Irad or Jared is the same word as the Assyrian
Arad, "servant," and A.rad or Ardutu is the Assyrian
rendering of the Accadian Ubara, the first part of the
name of the father of Xisuthrus, who is actually
called Ardates by Abydenus.
Mr. George Smith believed that the real connection
between the traditions of Babylonia and Palestine
would never be cleared up until the literature of the
Syrian population which intervened is recovered. It
is very possible that light may be thrown upon the
question by the excavations now being made at Jera
blus, the site of Carchemish, the capital of the ancient
Hittites. Terah may be the same word as Tarkhu,
who seems to have been worshipped as a god by: the
Hittites; and Lucian has preserved a legend of the
Flood and the patriarch Sisythes, who is evidently the
Xisuthrus of the Babylonians, which was current at
Hierapolis or Mabug, a little to the south of J erablus.,
In this legend the ark has .become a coffer, Sisythes
and his family are alone preserved, and the Flood was
sent to punish the wickedness of mankind.
There is one point which still deserves notice : these
traditions are not fixed to any localities in or near
Palestine, but even on the showing of the Jews them
selves, belong to the neighbourhood of the Euphrates
valley, and Babylonia in particular; this of course is
clearly stated in the Babylonian inscriptions and
traditions.
Eden, according even to the Jews, was by the



312 THE BTOBY OF THE FLOOD
Euphrates and Tigris; the cities of Babylon, La
rancha, and Sippara were supposed by the Baby
lonians to have been founded before the Flood.
Surippak was the city of the ark, the mountains east
of the Tigris were the resting-place of the ark, Baby
lon was the site of the tower, and Ur of the Chaldees
the birthplace ofAbraham. These facts and the further
statement that Abraham, the father and :first leader
of the Hebrew race, migrated from Ur to Harran in
Syria, and from thence to Palestine, ~e all so much
evidence in (avour of the hypothesis that Chaldea was
the original home of these stories, and that the Jews
received them originally from the Babylonians; but
on the other hand there are such striking differences
in some parts of the legends, particularly in the names
of the patriarchs before the Flood, that it is evi
dent further information is required before we can
determine how or when they were received by the
Jews.
To pass, now, to the twelfth tablet of the Izdubar
Epic, a curious fragment has been provisionallyplaced
by Mr. Smith in the fourth column, in which lzdubar
appears to call on his cities to mourn with him for his
friend. This tablet is remarkable for the number of
cities mentioned as already existing in the time of
Izdubar. Combining this notice with other early in
scriptions, the statements of Berosus and the notice of
the cities of Nimrod in Genesis, we get the follow
ing list of the oldest known cities in the Euphrates
valley:



.AND OONOL UBION. 813
1. Babylon and its
suburb
2. Borsippa.
8. Cutha.
4. Larsa.
5. Surippak, called
Larancha by
Berosus.
6. Eridu.
7 Nipur.
8. Erech.
9. Calneh.
10. Sippara. (Sephar
vaim.)
11. Kisu (or Kis).
12. Ganganna.
18. Amardaor Marad.
14. Ur
15. Nisin or Karrak.
16. Agane.
17. Duban or Duran.
18. Abnunna or Mul
lias.
19. Zirghul.
To these we may also add the great cities of
Assyria:
20. Assur, the primi
tive capital.
21. Ninuaor Nineveh.
22. Calah.
23. Resen (Assyrian
Res-eni, " the
head of th~
spring.")
So far as the various statements go, all these cities
and probably many others were in existence in the
time of Nimrod, and some of them even before the
Flood; the fact that the Babylonians four thousand
:years ago believed their cities to be of such an
tiquity, shows that they were not recent foundations,
and the attainments of the people at that time in the
arts and sciences prove that their civilization had
already known ages ofprogress. The legendary epoch
of Izdubar must be considered at present as the com
mencement of the united monarchy in BabyIonia, and

of the Hebrew language, or Noah, the Assyrian
nukhu, "rest; " but, besides these, certain names
appear as proper names also in Babylonia, among
them Cainan, Lamech, and Laban.
Cainan is found as the name of a Babylonian town
Kan-nan; the inhabitants of which were sometimes
called Kanunai, which must not be confounded with
the name of the Canaanites or '' lowlanders," origi
nally the inhabitants of the coastland of Phmnicia
and then, by extension, of all Palestine.
Lamech has already been pointed out by Palmer
(" Egyptian Chronicles," vol. i. p. 56), in the name
of the deified Phmnician patriarch Diamich ; this
name is found in the cuneiform texts as Dumugu and
Lamga, two forms of the Accadian name of the
moon.
The two wives of Lamech, Adah and Zillah, seem
to be the Assyrian edhutu or edhatu " darkness," and
tsillatu '' the shades of night;" and the names of his
two sons Jabal and Jubal are but varying form~ of
the Assyrian abil '' son." Dr. Oppert long ago
pointed out that this Assyrian word was the origin of
the name Abel which has been assimilated in spell
ing to a Hebrew word signifying "mere breath."
Some of the names of the patriarchs after the Flood
are found as names of towns in Syria, but not in
Babylonia; among these are Reu or Ragu, Serug,
and Harran.
Laban, on the other hand, as was :first noticed by
Dr. Delitzsch, is mentioned in a list of gods given in

should be taken into consideration in discussing the
evidence of the antiquity of Genesis.
Ur, now represented by the mounds of Mugheir, on
the western bank of the Euphrates to the south of
Babylon, was the capital of the earliest Accadian
dynasty with which we are acquainted. It was
specially devoted to the worship... of the moon-god,
the ruins of whose temple have been discovered
there. Ur was the birthplace of Abraham, in whom
we must see one of those Semitic intruders who
settled among the Accadians, and after adopting
their culture and civilization finally succeeded in
overcoming and supplanting them. It is probable
that it is called Ur Casdim, " Ur of the Casdim," in
Genesis only proleptically, since Casdim appears to be
the representative of an Assyrian word meani~g
. "conquerors"-a suitable epithet for the Semitic
tribes after their conquest of Babylonia. The Greek
names Chaldean and Chaldea are of much later
date, being derived from the Kaldai, a small tribe
settled on the Persian Gulf and first mentioned in the
ninth century B.c., who under Merodach-Baladan (B.c.
721-709) possessed themselves of Babylonia and be
came so integral a portion of its inhabitants as to
give their name to the whole of them in classical
times.
Some of the Genesis names are found at a com
paratively early date, the first which appears on a
contemporary monument being Ishmael. In the
reign of Khammuragas among the witnesses to some



OONOL USION. 319
documents at Larsa in Babylonia, appears a man
named " Abuha son of Ishmael."
After the time of Abraham the book of Genesis is
concerned with the affairs of Palestine, and of the
countries in its immediate vicinity, and it has no con
nection with Babylonian history and traditions ;
however, the cuneiform records corrtain one story
which has a striking likeness to that of Moses in the
. ark, and which, although not within the period
covered by Genesis, is of great interest in connection
with the early history of the Jews. ·
Sargina or Sargon. I. was a Babylonian monarch
who reigned in the: city of Agane about B.c. 1800.
The name of Sargon signifies the right, true, or legi
timate· king, and may have been assumed on his
ascending the throne. Sargon was probably of ob
scure origin, and hence the myth that attached itself
to him in later popular belief. This curious story is
found or1 fragments of tablets from Kouyunjik, and
reads as follows :
1. Sargina the powerful king the king of Agane
am I.
2. My mother was a princess, my fath·er I did
not know, a brother of my father chose the mountains.
3. In the city of Azupiranu which by the side of
the river Euphrates is situated
4. (my) mother the princess conceived me; in an
inaccessible place she brought me forth.
5. She placed me in a basket of rushes, with bitu-
men my exit she sealed up.
'.



320 OONOL UBION.
6. She launched me on the river which did not
drown me.
7. The river carried me, to Akki the irrigator it
brought me.
8. Akki the irrigator in tenderness of bowels
lifted me up ;
9. Akki the irrigator as his child brought me up,
10. Akki the irrigator as his woodman set me,
11. and in my woodmanship lstar loved me.
12. 45? years the kingdom I ruled,
13. the people of the black heads I governed, I • .
14. over rugged countries in many chariots of
bronze I rode,
15. I governed the upper countries,
16. I ruled ? over the chiefs of the lower countries.
17. To the sea coast three times I advanced, Dil
vun (in the Persian Gulf) submitted,
18. Durankigal bowed, &c. &c.
After this follows an address to any king who
should at a later time notice the inscription.
This myth is but a repetition of the oft-told story,
how the hero of noble birth is born in secret, is ex
posed to death, but is rescued and brought up in a
humble sphere of life until the time comes when his
true origin and character are revealed, and he becomes
a mighty prince and conqueror. The legend was
told of Perseus iI1 Greece, of Romulus in Italy, of
Cyrus in Persia. But just as Cyrus was a real per
sonage upon whom the legend was fastened, so too
Sargon was a real personage, who founded the great



OONOLUBION. 321
library of Agane, and extended his conquests as far
as the island of Cyprus, which he conquered in the
third year of his reign.
The most hazardous of the theories put forward
in the preceding chapters .is the one which identifies.
Izdubar with Nimrod, and makes him. reign in the
legendary period of Babylonian history. This theory
is founded· on several plausible, but probably merely
superficial grounds; and if any one accepts Mr.
Smith's view on the point, it will be only for similar
,
reasons to those which caused him to propose it;
namely, because, failing this, we have no clue what
ever to the age and position of the most famous hero
in Oriental tradition.
We must never lose sight of the fact that, apart
from the more perfect and main parts of these texts,
both in the decipherment of the broken fragments
and in the various theories projected respecting them,
the Assyrian scholar must change his opinions many
times, and no doubt any accession of new material
would change again our views respecting the parts
affected by it. These theories and conclusions, how
ever, although not always correct, have, on their way,
assisted the inquiry, and have led to the more ac
curate knowledge of the texts; for certainly in cunei
form matters we have often had to advance through
error to truth.
In adopting Mr. Smith's theory for the position of
Nimrod, one thing is certainly clear: he is placed as
low in the chrol)ology ns it is possible to make him.

322 CONCLUSION.
The stories and myths given in the foregoing
pages have, probably, very different values; some
are genuine traditions-some compiled to account
for natural phenomena, and some pure romances.
At the head of their history and traditions the
Babylonians placed an account of the creation of the
world; and, although different forms of this story
were current, in certain features they all agreed.
Beside the account of the present animals, they
related the creation of legions of monster forms
which disappeared before the human epoch, and they
accounted for the great problem of humanity-the
presence of evil in the world-by making out that it
proceeded from the original chaos, the spirit of con
fusion and darkness, which was the origin of all
things, and which was even older than the gods.
The principal story of the Creation, given in
Chapter V., substantially agrees, as far as it is pre
served, with the Biblical account. According to it,
there was a chaos of watery matter before the Crea
tion, and from this all things were generated.
We have then a considerable blank, the contents
of which we can only conjecture, and after this we
come to the creation of the heavenly orbs.
The fifth tablet in the series relates how God
created the constellations of the stars, the signs of the
zodiac, the planets and other stars, the moon and the
sun. · Mter another blank we have a fragment
which relates to the creation of wild and domestic
animals ; it is curious here that the original taniing of



OONOL USION. 323
domestic animals was even then so far back in the
history of the race that all knowledge of it was lost,
and the "animals of the city," or domestic animals,
were considered different creations from the " animals
of the desert," or "field," or wild animals.
We next come to the war between the dragon and
powers of evil, or chaos, on one side and the gods on
the other. The gods have weapons forged for them,
and Merodach undertakes to lead the heavenly host
·against the dragon. The war, which is described
with spirit, ends of course in the triumph of the
principle of good, and the overthrow of primeval
anarchy.
· In Chapter V. another account of the Creation
is given which differs materially from the first. The
principal feature in the second account is the de
scription of the eagle-headed men with their family
of leaders-this legend clearly showing the origin. of
the eagle-headed figures represented on the Assyrian
sculptures.
• It is probable that some of these Babylonian le
gends contained detailed descriptions of the Garden
of Eden, which seems to have been the district of
Eridu in the south of Babylonia, as Sir Henry Raw
linson believes.
· There are coincidences in respect to the geography
of the region and its name which render the identi
fication very probable; of the four rivers in each case,
two, the Euphrates and Tigris, are identical; then,
again, the known fertility of the region, its 11ame,



324 OONOLUSION.
sometimes Gan-duni, so similar to Gan-eden (the
Garden of Edei:t), and other considerations, all
tend towards the view that it is the Paradise of
Genesis.
There are evidences of the belief in the tree of
life, which is .one of the most common emblems on
the seals and larger sculptures, and is even used
as an ornament on dresses ; a sacred tree is also seve
ral times mentioned in the legends and hymns, but at
present there is no direct connection known between
the tree and the Fall, although the gem engravings
render it very probable that there was a legend of
this kind like the one in Genesis.
In the history of Berosus mention is made of a
composite being, half man, half fish, named Oannes,
who was supposed to have appeared out of the
sea and to have taught the Babylonians all their
learning. The Babylonian and Assyrian sculptures
have made us familiar with the figure of Oannes, and
have so far giv~n evider1ce that Berosus has truly
described this mythological figure; but it is a curjous
fact that the legend of Oannes, which must have been
one of the Babylonian stories of the Creation, has not
yet been recovered. In fact, as previously noticed
(p. 12), there is only one fragment which can be at
all referred to it, and this has been accidentally pre
served among a series of extracts from various
Accadian works in a bilingual reading-book compiled
for the use of Assyrian students of Accadian. The
fragment is as follows:



,

1. To the waters their god
2. has returned:
· 3. to the house of bright things
4. he descended (as) an icicle :
5. on a seat of snow
6. he grew not old in wisdom.
The legend of Oannes, whose name may possibly
be the Accadian Hea-khan, " Hea the fish," con
cerned the Babylonians only, and so did not interest
the Assyrians, who did not care to have it in their
libraries.
Besides the legend of Oannes, however, there
are evidently many stories of early times still
unknown, or only known by mere fragments or
allusions.
The fables given in Chapter IX. form a series
quite different· in character from the legends, and the
only excuse for inserting them here is the need of
exhibiting as clearly and fully as possible the
literature of the great epoch which produced the
Genesis tablets.
Most of the other stories apparently relate to the
great period before the Flood, when celestial visitors
came to and from the earth, and the inhabitants
of the world were very distinctly divided into the
good and bad, but the stories are only fables with a
moral attached, and have little connection with Baby
lonian history.
Two of these stories are very curious, and may
hereafter turn out to be of great importance ; one is



326 OONOLUSION.
the story of the sin committed by the god Zn, and
the other the story of Atarpi.
Berosus in his history has given an account of ten
Chaldean kings who reigned before the Flood, and the
close of this period is well known from the descriptions
of the Deluge in the Bible, the Deluge tablet, and the
work of the Greek writer. According to Berosus
several of the Babylonian cities were built before the
Flood, and various arts were known, including writing.
The enormous reigns given by Berosus to his ten
kings, making a total of 432,000 years, force us to dis
card the idea that the details are historical, although
there may be some foundation for his statement of a
civilization before the Deluge. The details given in
the inscriptions describing the Flood leave no doubt
that both the Bible and the Babylonian story describe
the same event, and the Flood becomes the starting
point for the modern world in both histories. Accord
ing to Berosus 86 kings reigned for 34,080 years after
the Flood down to the Median conquest. If these
kings are historical, it is doubtful if they formed a
continuous line, and they could scarcelycover a longer
period than 2,000 years. The Median or Elamite
conquest took place about B.c. 2700, and, if we allow
the round number 2,000 years for the previous
J>eriod, it will make the Flood fall about B.c. 4700.
In a fragmentary inscription with a list of Babylonian
kings, some names are given which appear to belong
to the 86 kings of Berosus, but our•information about
this period is so scanty that nothi11g can be said



OONOL US ION. 827
about this dynasty, and a suggestion as to the date
of the Deluge must be received with more than the
usual grain of salt.
We can see, however, that there was a civilized
race in Babylonia before the Median Conquest, the
progress of which must have received a rude shock
when the country was overrun by the uncivilized
Eastern borderers.
Among the fragmentary notices of this semi
mythical period is the portion of the inscription de
scribing the building of the Tower of Babel and the
dispersion.
It is probable from the fragments of Berosus that
the incursions and dominion of the Median Elamites
lasted about two hundred years, during which the
country suffered greatly from them.
The legends of Izdubar or Nimrod commence with
a description of the evils brought upon Babylonia by
foreign invasion, the conquest and sacking of the city
of Erech being one of the incidents in the story.
Izdubar, a famous hunter, who claimed descent from
a long line of kings, reaching up to the time of the
Flood, now comes forward; he has a dream, ~nd after
much trouble a half-human creature named Hea-bani
is persu.aded by Zaidu, the hunter, and two females,
to come to Erech and interpret the dream of Izdubar.
Rea-bani, having heard the fame of Izdubar, brings to
Erech a midannu or tiger to test his strength, and
Izdubar slays it. After these things, lzdubar ·and
Rea-bani become friends, and, having invoked the



828 OONOL UBION.
gods, they start to attack the tyrant Khumbaba.
Khumbaba dwelt in a thick forest, surrounded by a
wall, and here he was visited by the two friends, who
slew him and carried off his spoils.
Izdubar was now proclaimed king, and extended
his authority over the Babylonian world, his court and
palace being at Erech. The goddess Istar, daughter
of A nu accordi~g to one myth, of Bel according to
another, of Sin, the moon god, according to a third,
,vho had loved the shepherd Tammuz, the Sun-god,
fell in love with Izdubar. He refused her offers,
and the goddess, angry at his answer, ascended to
heaven and petitioned her father Anu to create a bull
for her, to be an instrument of her vengeance. Anu
complied, and created the bull, on which Izdubar and
Hea..bani collected a band of warriors and went against
it. Hea-.bani took hold of the animal by its head and
tail, while Izdubar slew it.
Ist.ar on this cursed Izdubar, and descended to
Hades to attempt once more to summon unearthly
powers against the hero. She descends to the infernal
regions, which are vividly described, and, passing
through their seven gates, is ushered into the presence
of the queen of the dead. The world of love goes
,vrong in the absence of Ist.ar, and on the petition of
the gods she is once more brought to the earth,
ultimately Anatu, her mother, satisfying her ven
geance by striking Izdubar with a loathsome dis
ease.
Rea-bani, the friend of Izdul>ar, is now killed, and



OONOL UBION. 829
Izdubar, mourning his double affliction, abandons his
kingdom and wanders into the desert to seek the
advice of Xisuthrus his ancestor, who had been
translated for his piety and now dwelt with the
gods.
Izdubar now had a dream, and after this wandered
to the region where gigantic composite monsters held
and controlled the rising and setting sun : from these
he learr1ed the road to the region of the blessed, and,
passing across a great waste of sand, arrived at a
region where splendid trees were laden with jewels
instead of fruit.
Izdubar then met two females, named Siduri and
Sabitu, after an adventure with whom he found a
boatman named Nes-Hea, who undertook to navigate
him to the region where Xisuthrus dwelt.
Coming near the dwelling of the blessed, he found
it surrounded by the waters of death, which he had
to cross in order to reach the land of which he was in·
search.
On arri~g at the other side, Izdubar was met by
Mu-seri-ina-namari, "the waters of dawn at day
break," who engaged him in conversation about
Bea-bani, and then Xisuthrus, taking up the conver
sation, described to him the Deluge. Izdubar was
afterwards cured of his illness and returned with
Nes-Hea to Erech, where he mourned anew for his
friend Hea-bani, and on intercession with the gods
the ghost of Hea-bani arose from the ground where
the pody had lain.



830 OONOL UBION.
The details of this story, and especially the ac
counts of the regions inhabited by the dead, are very
striking, and illustrate, in a wonderful manner, the
religious views of the people.
It is worth while here to pause, and consider the
evidence of the existence of the legends recounted
in the preceding pages from the close of the mythical
period down to the seventh century B.c.
We have first the seals : of these there are some
hundreds in European museums, and among the
earliest are many specimens carved with scenes from
the Genesis legends ; some of these are a good deal
older than B.c. 2000, others may be ranged at various
dates down to B.C. 1500.
With three exceptions, which are of Assyrian
origin, all the seals engr~ved in the present volume
are Babylonian. One very fine and early example is
photographed as the frontispiece of the book. The
character and style of the cuneiform legend which
accompanies this shows it to be one of the most
ancient specimens; it is engra~ed on a hard jasper
cylinder in bold style, and is a remarkable example
of early Babylonian art. Many other similar cylinders
of the same period are known; the relief on them is
bolder than on the later seals, on which from about
B.C. 1600 or 1700, a change in the inscriptions be
comes general.
The numerous illustrations to the present work,
which have ·been collected from these early Baby
lonian seals, will serve to show that the legends



OONOL US ION. 831
were well known, and formed part of the literature
of the country before the second millennium B.c.
· After B.c. 1500, the literature of Babylonia is
unknown, and we lose sight of all evidence of its
legends for some centuries. In the meantime Egypt
supplies a few notices bearing on the subject, which
serve to show that knowledge of them was still kept
up. Nearly thirteen hundred years before the
Christian era one of the Egyptian poems likens a
hero to the Assyrian chief, Kazartu, a great hunter.
Kazartu probably means a u strong" o~ " powerful"
one, and it has already been suggested that the
reference is to the hero Nimrod. A little later, in
the period extending from B.c. 1000 to 800, we have
in Egypt several persons n.amed Namurot, which
seems to be an echo of the name of the mighty
hunter.
On the revival of the Assyrian empire, about B.c.
990, we come again to numerous references to the
Genes~s legends, and these continue through almost
every reign down to the close of the empire. The
Assyrians carved the sacred tree and cherubim on
their walls, they depicted in the temples the struggle
between Merodach and the dragon, they decorated
their portals with. the figure of lzdubar strangling a
lion, and carved the struggles of Izdubar and Hea
bani with the lion and the bull even on their stone
vases.
Just as the sculptures of the Greek temples, the
paintings on the vases and the carving on their gems



832 OONOL UBION.
were taken from their myths and legends, so the
series of myths and legends belonging to the valley of
,
the Euphrates furnished ·materials for the sculptor,
the engraver, and the painter, among the ancient
Babylonians and Assyrians.
In this way we have continued evidence of the
existence of these legends down to the time of As
sur-bani-pal, B.c. 673 to 626, who caused the present
known copies to be made for his library at Nineveh.
Search in Babylonia would, no doubt, yield much
earlier copies of all these works, but that search has
not yet been instituted, and for the present we have
to be contented with our Assyrian copies. Looking,
however, at the world-wide interest of the subjects,
and at the important evidence which perfect copies of
these works would undoubtedly give, there can be no
doubt that further progress will be made in research
and discovery, and that all that is here written
will one day be superseded by newer texts and fuller
and more perfect light.
