Miriam
Miriam ( מִרְ י ָם ) is described in the Hebrew
Bible as the daughter of Amram and
Jochebed, and the sister of Moses and
Aaron. She was a prophetess and first
appears in the Book of Exodus.
The Torah refers to her as "Miriam the
Prophetess"
[1]
and the Talmud
[2]
names
her as one of the seven major female
prophets of Israel. Scripture describes her
alongside of Moses and Aaron as
delivering the Jews from exile in Egypt: "For I brought you up out of
the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, and I
sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam".
[3]
According to the
Midrash,
[4]
just as Moses led the men out of Egypt and taught them
Torah, so too Miriam led the women and taught them Torah.
Biblical narrative
Miriam was the daughter of Amram, the leader of the Israelites in
ancient Egypt, and of Jochebed and the sister of Aaron and Moses.
[5]
The narrative of Moses' infancy in the Torah describes an unnamed
sister of Moses observing him being placed in the Nile (Ex 2T4); she
is traditionally described as being Miriam.
[6]:71
In the biblical narrative of the exodus, Miriam is described as a
"prophetess" when she leads the Israelites in the Song of the Sea
after Pharoah's army is destroyed at the Sea of Reeds.
[6]:71
The Torah describes Miriam and Aaron as criticizing of Mosesʼ



Miriam watching over the infant Moses
"Cushite" wife in Numbers 12.[6]:79
Regarding the death of Miriam, the Torah states, "The entire
congregation of the children of Israel arrived at the desert of Tzin in
the first month, and the people settled in Kadesh. Miriam died there
and was buried there".[7]
Interpretations and elaborations
Cushite wife
Midrashic explanation
The Midrash[8] explains the entire story as
follows: It became known to Miriam and
Aaron that Moses had separated from
intimacy with Tzipora. They disapproved
of this separation because they
considered her to be outstandingly
righteous, much as a dark-skinned person
stands out among light-skinned people
hence the reference to Tzipora as a
“Cushite”. This usage of the word Cushite
is non-pejorative and is often used in
Jewish sources as a term for someone
unique and outstanding.[9] In fact, King
Saul[10] and even the Jewish People[11] are
referred to by the term “Cushite”. Their complaint, therefore, was not
about the union between Moses and Tzipora, but about their
separation. The only justification they could find for Mosesʼ celibacy
was in order to maintain his prophetic state. This explains their claim
that God spoke not only to Moses but also to them, yet they had not
separated from their spouses.



But God rebuked them by calling them all out “suddenly”, causing
Miriam and Aaron a great burning sensation since they lacked
immersion in a mikva after marital relations. God thus demonstrated
to them Mosesʼ unique level of prophecy for which he had to be
prepared at all times, thereby justifying his separation from Tzipora.
Afterwards, “Godʼs wrath flared against them.”[12] Rabbi Louis
Ginzberg wrote the anger of God to them.
"...I Myself ordered him to abstain from conjugal life, and the word
he received was revealed to him clearly and not in dark speeches,
he saw the Divine presence from behind when It passed by him.
Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against a man like
Moses, who is, moreover, My servant? Your censure is directed to
Me, rather than to him, for 'the receiver is no better than the thief,'
and if Moses is not worthy of his calling, I, his Master, deserve
censure."[13]
— Legends of the Jews vol. III
Afterward, Miriam is left with bodily tzaraʼat, which according to
Jewish sources is a divine punishment for slander.[14] This was
because she, not Aaron, was the one who initiated the complaint
against Moses.[15] Despite Miriam's intent to help Tzipora, she
should have judged Moses favorably and approached Moses on
Tzipora's behalf privately. Aaron asks Moses to intercede for Miriam,
Moses prays to God to heal her, and God concedes after requiring a
quarantine of seven days.
Both Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, but only Miriam
contracted tzara'at. It has been suggested that since according to
the Hebrew Bible anyone with tzaraʼat was tamei (Leviticus 13-14),
Aaron was spared this punishment in order not to interrupt his duties
as High Priest.[citation needed] However, noting the wording of the



verse, “Godʼs wrath flared against them [i.e. both Aaron and
Miriam]”, the Talmud appears to conclude that Aaron was also
smitten with tzaraʼat initially, but was then immediately cured.[16]
Alternative explanations
It has been suggested that Josephus[17] and Irenaeus[18] (who
merely cites Josephus) identify the Cushite woman as Tharbis, “the
daughter of the king of the Ethiopians”. However, while Josephus
does describe a legend (which is not written in the Torah) wherein
Moses marries this princess during a military campaign he leads in
Ethiopia, according to Josephus this marriage occurs while Moses is
still a royal prince of Egypt long before he re-discovers his
oppressed Jewish brethren. After which time, upon fleeing as a
solitary fugitive from Egypt,[19] the only marriage of Moses that the
Torah records is with Tzipora the daughter of Yitro the Midianite.[20]
In fact, Josephus[21] himself later records Mosesʼ marriage to Tzipora
as separate and subsequent to his earlier marriage to Tharbis.
Furthermore, according to the conclusion of the Tharbis legend,
Moses fashioned a miraculous ring which caused her to forget her
love for him, and he then returned to Egypt alone.[22] Therefore, even
according to Josephus, Mosesʼ first marriage to Tharbis as military
leader of Egypt terminated long before his later marriage to Tzipora
as fugitive from Egypt, such that the Cushite wife of Moses
mentioned in the Torah after the Exodus appears to be Tzipora, as
explained above.
Richard E. Friedman writes that since Cush is generally understood
to mean “Ethiopia”, it is possible that the “Cushite woman” is not
Tzipora. But he adds that since there is a place called Cushan which
is a region of Midian, and Mosesʼ wife Tzipora has already been
identified as a Midianite, it is possible that the term “Cushite” relates
to Tziporaʼs being from Cushan.[23] However, Friedmanʼs primary



interest is not in the identity of the Cushite woman, but rather in the
outcome of this story which establishes Mosesʼ superiority over
Aaron as an example of his claim that rival priesthoods created or
publicized tales in order to legitimize their respective claims to
privilege and power. He describes the Aaronid priesthood in the
Kingdom of Judah, which claimed descent from Aaron and which
controlled the Temple in Jerusalem, as opposed to a priesthood
which claimed allegiance to Moses and was based at Shiloh in the
Kingdom of Israel. Using interpretations from the documentary
hypothesis, he notes that this story, which he calls “Snow-White
Miriam”, was authored by the Elohist who he claims was from, or
supported, the Shiloh priesthood, and thus promoted this tale to
assert Mosesʼ superiority over Aaron and thereby belittle the Aaronid
priesthood in Judah. However, the identity of the Cushite woman
referred to in this story is tangential to Friedman and his opinion
remains inconclusive.
The Well of Miriam
Miriam's death is described in Numbers 20T1 and in the next verse,
the Israelites are described as complaining of the lack of water at
Meribah; in Jewish tradition this abrupt transition was explained by
imagining a "well of Miriam" that dried up when she died. Further
elaboration identified the rock that Moses struck to bring forth water
in Exodus 17T5-6 with this well, and said that the rock travelled with
the people until Miriam's death.[24][25]:217-228
The Talmud[26] says, “Three great leaders led Israel: Moses, Aaron
and Miriam. In their merit they received three great gifts: the Well
[Miriam], the Clouds of Glory [Aaron] and the Manna [Moses].” When
Miriam died, the well was removed as is evidenced by the fact that
immediately after the verse “And Miriam died”,[27]



Rashi says that this well was the same rock from which Moses
brought forth water after Miriamʼs death.[28] The Midrash states that
when they encamped, the leader of each Tribe took his staff to the
well and drew a line in the sand toward his Tribeʼs encampment. The
waters of the well were drawn after the mark and thus supplied water
for each of the Tribes.[29]
Symbolism in modern practice
Miriam is a popular figure among some Jewish feminists. Thus, in
addition to the traditional cup of wine that is set for the Prophet
Elijah, some feminist-inspired Seders set a cup of water for Miriam
which is sometimes also accompanied by a ritual in her honor.[30]
Miriamʼs cup originated in the 1980s in a Boston Rosh Chodesh
group; it was invented by Stephanie Loo, who filled it with what she
referred to as mayim chayim (living waters) and used it in a feminist
ceremony of guided meditation.[31] Miriamʼs cup is linked to the
midrash of Miriamʼs well, which “is a rabbinic legend that tells of a
miraculous well that accompanied the Israelites during their forty
years in the desert at the Exodus from Egypt”.[32][33]
Some Modern Orthodox Jews have revived an ancient custom[34] of
adding a piece of fish to the Seder plate in honor of Miriam who is
associated with water, based on the teaching in the Talmud[35] that
God gave manna (on the ground) in the merit of Moses, clouds of
glory (in the sky) in the merit of Aaron and a well (of water) in the
merit of Miriam. Accordingly, the lamb (earth), egg (air) and fish
(water) in the Seder symbolize the three prophets Moses, Aaron and
Miriam, respectively, whom God chose to redeem the Jews from
Egypt.[36] Similarly, the lamb, egg and fish also allude to the three
mythical creatures in Jewish tradition - the land beast Behemoth,[37]
the bird Ziz,[38] and the sea-creature Leviathan,[39] respectively.
According to the Midrash, the Leviathan and Behemoth,[40] as well



as the Ziz,[41] are to be served at the Seudat Techiyat HaMetim[42]
(the feast for the righteous following the Resurrection of the Dead),
to which the Passover Seder alludes, insofar as it commemorates the
past Redemption together with the Cup of Elijahʼs heralding the
future, Final Redemption.[43][44]
Quranic account
Further information: Biblical narratives and the Qur'an § Miriam and
Mary
In the Qurʼan, as in the Hebrew Bible, Miriam obeys her motherʼs
request to follow the baby Moses as he floats down the river in a
basket, their mother having set him afloat so he would not be killed
by Pharaohʼs servants and soldiers (28T11). Later on, Asiya, wife of
Pharaoh, finds Moses at the river and adopts him as her own, but
Moses refuses to be suckled by her. Miriam asks Pharaohʼs wife and
her handmaidens to have his own mother act as nursemaid to
Moses, the motherʼs identity not being known to Pharaohʼs wife
(28T12–13).
