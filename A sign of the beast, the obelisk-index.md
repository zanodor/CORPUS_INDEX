Roman emperors, who considered Egypt their personal preserve, collected antiquities
on a grand scale. They carted off hundreds of statues and other objects to decorate their capital. But it was the tall
Obelisk, topped by a small pyramid and chiseled with mysterious hieroglyphs, that the Romans most fancied.
Obelisks were dedicated to the sun god and inscribed with names of pharaohs, the foreigners, however, knew nothing
of this, so it is said. Pliny the Elder believed the inscriptions interpreted “the operations of Nature according to the
philosophy of the Egyptians,” and today more Obelisks stand in Rome than in Egypt. Others are scattered about the world from New York to Istanbul.1
The United States acquired an Obelisk in 1881, “Cleopatra’s Needle.” It was
a gift of the khedive and was erected in New York’s Central Park. Once it stood before the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis. All of this intrigue over the centuries did
not unlock Egypt’s mysteries and Ancient Egypt still wore its veil of mystery until Napoleon brought the first printing press to Egypt in 1799. Works could now be
published quickly and cheaply in Arabic, French and Greek. He also founded the French Institute in Cairo, a research facility that still exists. In due course, the 24
volume Description CLEOPATRA’S NEEDLE de l’Egypte appeared. This encyclopedic record of the nation’s antiquities, natural history, and contemporary customs,
thrust Egypt into the center of the world stage. The 19 century was to be the greatest period of European exploration
th
and plunder. Today most of the mysteries are un-locked.
Due to the mass migration of the Obelisk to the whole world, I have been pressed by the Spirit of the Lord to
write about the mysteries of the Obelisk that have not been told, although un-locked. They effect us dramatically even today.
The Obelisk!
ob-e-lisk \ [MF obelisque, fr. L obeliscus, fr. Gk Obeliskos small spit, Obelisk, dim. Of obelos spit, pointed pillar, obelus] 1: an upright, 4 sided, and usu. monolithic pillar that gradually tapers as it rises and terminates in a pyramid
<Cleopatra’s Needle and the Washington Monument are Obelisks>. 2. A: OBELUS B: DAGGER 3: A decorative feature (as a lamp base or on a chandelier) having a tall slender tapering form, Obelisk.2
The Obelisk, also called stela and phallic is a four-sided tapering monument, usually hewn of a single great
peace of stone, terminating in a pointed or pyramidical top. In America you can and probably have seen the Washington Monument. It is an Obelisk.
Among the ancient Egyptians, the Obelisks or monoliths were commonly of “Red Granite” from Syene. They
were seen throughout Egypt in front of Temples, normally in pairs and were dedicated to honour the sun god Ra or Re. The greatest number in any one place was at “Heliopolis.” The caps, or pyramidion were sometimes sheathed with
copper or other precious metals such as gold to radiate the sun’s rays honoring the sun god. The spread of the Obelisk from ancient times can be seen today in India, China, Rome, London, New York, Florence, Paris, Mexico, Central
America and yes even Washington.
But what is the significance of the Obelisk? In ancient times it was used in worship of pagan deities through
many rituals which today are looked upon as myths. But are they myths? The cost alone of manufacture, transport
and erection at site of these monoliths are in the millions of dollars and perhaps billions if we consider all that are erected in the world today. Two of the ancient Obelisks, or phallus from Egypt known as Cleopatra’s Needles are made

of solid red granite stone and stand approximately 69 feet tall. Today, one of these stands in London England and the
other in New York City. London and New York happen to be the two greatest centers of world financial power, the crown jewels of economic global strength.
Cleopatra had two distinct lovers other than her
two brother-husbands. They were Caesar of Rome and Marc Anthony around the period of 42 B.C. This is not
a myth and perhaps there is greater significance to the proliferation of the Obelisk in our world today than at
first meets the eye. The greatest number of Obelisks
was at Heliopolis. Why Heliopolis? The picture to
right: Heliopolis in Ancient times, the center of Egypt’s sun worship god“Ra-Harakh, or Rç ́-Harmakhis.”
Heliopolis is a Greek word meaning, “city of
the sun” and it was one of the most ancient cities of Egypt dating back to the I Dynasty in the Old Kingdom
4500 B.C. and located on the Nile Delta, 6 miles below modern Cairo. The native (beginning) name for this
city is in the Bible and it was “On.” The Assyrian name was “Baalbek” as empires rose and fell.
3
Heliopolis was the center of Egypt’s sun worship and god “Ra or Rç ́,” the state deity until Thebes became capital in 2100 B.C. The god “Ammon” was then joined with Ra or Rç ́ as Ammon-Ra and Ammon-Rç ́. There appears
to be two forms of the sun-god at Heliopolis in the New Kingdom--namely, god“Ra-Harakht, or Rç ́- Harmakhis, falcon headed and Etôm, human-headed; the former was the sun in mid-day strength, the latter the evening sun. A
sacred bull was worshiped here under the name Mnevis (Eg. Mreu), and was especially connected with Etôm.
The sun-god Rç ́ was especially the royal god, the ancestor of all the Pharaohs, who therefore held the temple of Heliopolis in great
honour. All the dynasties might give the first place to the god of its residence, but all alike honoured Rç ́. Notice in the next graphic the

Obelisk shape in the front of Etôm’s robe. It is also capped with a sheath like the pyramid and Obelisk.
“Ra-Harakht, or Rç ́-Harmakhis, falcon headed and Etôm, human
headed”
Let us take a journey back in time to look at the beginnings of man’s religious history. There is in the nature of man, or in the
circumstances in which he is conditioned, something which leads him to recognize and worship a superior being. What that something is, is
not important in our present inquiry:- whether it be a constitutional instinct wrought by the Maker-whether it be a deduction of universal
reason, inferring a first cause from the things that are made-whether it be the effect of tradition, descending from the first worshipers,
through all the tribes of the human family-whether any or all of these be the cause, the fact is the same.
Man is a religious being! HE WILL WORSHIP.

In view of this propension of human nature, philosophers, in seeking a
generic appellation for man, have denominated him a “religious animal.”The characteristic is true of him in whatever part of the world he may be found, and
in whatever condition; and it has been true of him in all ages of which we have any record either fabulous or authentic.
Many in ancient and modern times have come in their name and have
sought for the worship of man. They perhaps unknowingly have taken on the spirit of a fallen angelic being the Bible calls Lucifer; Quote! ‘How art thou
fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! [how] art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart,
I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will
ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.’5
The worship of the sun-god Ra or Re is not a myth! The idolaters of ancient antiquities actually knew who they were worshiping and it was a man by
the name of Nimrod, his ancestors Ham and Cush and his direct successors, their families and heirs after them continuing up to this very day. After the deluge they broke the earth in pieces by
perverting the commands of God, man subduing man to take the worship away from his Creator. The spirit of lucifer indwelt them for his perverted purposes of self worship and
as ruler of the earth he still controls all the kingdoms of this world. Lucifer, that is, satan was given the earth as his kingdom because of Adam’s sin and his angelic beings have
influenced the behavior of man ever since. Even during the temptation of Jesus we read6 that he offered him all the kingdoms of the world if He would worship him. Nimrod was
a mighty hunter against God’s established laws that had been transmitted orally to men like Seth, Noah and Shem. Nimrod was the offspring of Cush who was the offspring of
Ham who had sinned a grievous sin which brought the iniquity of the father to the
7
children. God the same yesterday today and forever!8
NIMROD
To establish the point that the worship of Nimrod as Ra or Re and his successors is not a myth and still exists
today, we must go to writings on the ‘The Child in Assyria.’ We start with this subject discussing Semiramis who has
9
been referred to many times in history. She is well known to have been deified and worshiped by the Babylonians,10

Sir H. Rawlinson having found evidence at Nineveh, of the existence of a Semiramis
9
about six or seven centuries before the Christian era, seems inclined to regard her as the only
Semiramis that ever existed. But this is subversive of all history. The fact that there was a Semiramis in the primeval ages of the world, is beyond all doubt (see Justin, Hisoria, p. 615, and
the historian Castor in Cory’s Fragments, p.65), although some of the exploits of the latter queen have evidently been attributed to her predecessor. Mr. Layard dissents from Sir H. Rawlinson’s
opinion.

and other eastern nations and that under the name of Rhea, the great Goddess “Mother.” The worship of Semiramis
11 12
in Babylon is as the worship of Shing Moo, the Holy Mother in China, being represented with a child in her arms, and a glory around her, exactly as if a Roman Catholic artist had been employed to set her up. It was from the son,
13
(Nimrod) however, that she derived all her glory and her claims to deification. That son, though represented as a child in his mother’s arms, was a person of great stature and immense bodily powers, as well as most fascinating manners.
In Scripture he is referred to under the name of Tammuz, but he is commonly known among classical writers under
14
the name of Bacchus, that is, “The Lamented One.”15
To the ordinary reader the name of Bacchus suggests nothing more than revelry and drunkenness, but it is now
well known, that amid all the abominations that attended his orgies, their grand design was professedly “the
purification of souls,” and that from the guilt and defilement of sin. This lamented one, exhibited and adored as
16
a little child in his mothers’ arms, seems, in point of fact, to have been the husband of Semiramis, whose name, Ninus, by which he is commonly known in classical history, literally signified “The Son.” As Semiramis, the wife was
17
worshiped as Rhea, whose grand distinguishing character was that of the great goddess “Mother.” The conjunction
18
with her of her husband, under the name Ninus, or “The Son,” was sufficient to originate the peculiar worship of the
“Mother and Son.” This no doubt, is the explanation of the fact which has so much puzzled the inquirers into ancient history, that Ninus is sometimes called the husband, and sometimes the son of Semiramis.19
This form or system of worship became ingrained so deep into the hearts of the people that when the dispersion
came at the Tower of Babel, they took their pagan religion with them. So extensively was it diffused among the nations of antiquity that even today throughout the world we still see the resemblance of it in modern forms of worship and
symbolism surrounding that worship such as the Obelisk.
This also accounts for the origin of the very same confusion of relationship between Isis and Osiris, the mother and child of the Egyptians; for as Bunsen shows, Osiris was represented in Egypt as at once the son and husband of

Kuanyin and the Popish Madonna, that, in conversing with Europeans, they frequently call either of them indifferently by the same title. Davis’s China, vol. ii. p. 56. The first Jesuit missionaries to
China also wrote home to Europe, that they found mention in the Chinese sacred books, books unequivocally Pagan, of a mother and child, very similar to their own Madonna and child at home.

his mother; and actually bore, as one of his titles of dignity and honour, the name “Husband of the Mother.”20
In some places in Egypt the song of Linus or Osiris a peculiar melody, seems to have been used. Savary says
that, in the temple of Abydos, “the priest repeated the seven vowels in the form of hymns, and that musicians were forbid to enter it.” Strabo whom Savary refers to, calls the god of that temple Memnon, but we learn from
21
Wilkinson, that Osiris was the great god of Abydos, whence it is evedent that Memnon and Osiris were only different
22
names of the same divinity. Now the name of Linus or Osiris, as the “husband of his mother,” in Egypt; was Kamut!23
When Gregory the Great introduced into the Church of Rome what are now called the Gregorian Chants, he got them from the Chaldean mysteries, which had long been established in Rome, for the Roman Catholic priest, Eustace, admits that these chants were largely composed of “Lydian and Phrygian tunes.” Lydia and Phrygia being among the chief seats
24
in later times of those mysteries, of which the Egyptian mysteries were only a
branch. These tunes were sacred, the music of the great god, and in
introducing them, Gregory introduced the music of Kamut. And thus, to all
appearance, has it come to pass, that the name of Osiris or Kamut, “the husband of the mother,” is in every-day
use among ourselves as the name of the musical scale;
for what is the melody of Osiris, consisting of the
“seven vowels” formed into a hymn, but the Gamut?
OSIRIS ISWARA & ISI or PARVATI
This still further casts light on the fact already
noticed, that the Indian God Iswara is represented as a babe at the breast of his own wife Isi, or Parvati. Now, this Ninus, or “Son,” borne in the arms of the Babylonian Madonna, is so
described as very clearly to identify him with Nimrod. “Ninus, king of the Assyrians,” says
25
Trogus Pompeius, epitomised by Justin, “first of all changed the contented moderation of the ancient manners, incited
by a new passion, the desire of conquest. He was the first who carried on war against his neighbours, and he
26
Bunsen, vol.i.pp.438,439. It may be observed that this very name “Husband of the
20
Mother,” given to Osiris, seems even at this day to be in common use among ourselves, although there is not the least suspicion of the meaning of the term, or whence it has come. Herodotus mentions that when in Egypt, he was astonished to hear the very same mournful but
ravishing “Song of Linus,” sung by the Egyptians (although under another name), which he had
been accustomed to hear in his own native land of Greece (Herod.,lib.ii.cap.79). Linus was the
same god as the Bacchus of Greece, or Osiris of Egypt; for Homer introduces a boy singing the song of Linus, while the vintage is going on (Ilias, lib.xviii.v.569-571,pp.725,726), and the
Scholiast says that this song was sung in memory of Linus, who was torn in pieces by dogs. The epithet “dogs,” applied to those who tore Linus in pieces, is evidently used in a mystical sense, and
it will after words be seen how thoroughly the other names by which he is known, i.e., Narcissus identifies him with the Greek Bacchus and Egyptian Osiris.

conquered all nations from Assyria to Lybia, as they were yet unacquainted with the arts of war.” This account
27
points directly to Nimrod, and can apply to no other.
The account of Diodorus Siculus entirely agrees with it, and adds another trait that goes still further to determine the identity. That account is as follows:--”Ninus, the most ancient of the Assyrian kings mentioned in history, performed
great actions. Being naturally of a warlike disposition, and ambitious of glory that results from valor, he armed a considerable number of young men that were brave and vigorous like himself, trained them up a long time in laborious
exercises and hardships, and by that means accustomed them to bear the fatigues of war, and to face dangers with intrepidity.”28
As Diodorus makes Ninus “the most ancient of the Assyrian kings,” and represents him as beginning those
wars which raised his power to an extraordinary height by bringing the people of Babylonia under subjection to him, while as yet the city of Babylon was not in existence, this shows that he occupied the very position of Nimrod, of
whom the Scriptural account is, that he first “began to be a mighty on the earth,” and that the “beginning of his kingdom was Babylon.” As the Babel builders, when their speach was confounded, were scattered abroad on the face
29
of the earth, (they took their Obelisk’s and religion with them) and therefore deserted both the city and the tower which they had commenced to build.
Babylon as a city, could not properly be said to exist till Nimrod, by establishing his power there, made it the
foundation and starting-point of his greatness. In this respect, then, the story of Ninus and of Nimrod exactly
harmonise. The way, too, in which Ninus gained his power is the very
way in which Nimrod erected his. There can be no doubt that it was by injuring his followers to the toils and dangers of the chase, that he
gradually formed them to use the arms, and so prepared them for aiding him in establishing his dominions; just as Ninus, by training his
companions for a long time “in laborious exercises and hardships,” qualified them for making him the first of the Assyrian kings. The
conclusions deduced from these testimonies of ancient history are greatly strengthened by many additional considerations.
In the Bible we find a passage, which, when its meaning is properly
understood, casts a very steady light on the subject. That passage, as given in the Authorized Version, runs thus:-”Out of that land went
forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh.”30
TOWER OF BABEL
This speaks of it as something remarkable, that Asshur went out
of the land of Shinar, while yet the human race in general went forth in the same land. It goes upon the supposition that Asshur had some sort
of divine right to that land, and that he had been, in a manner, expelled from it by Nimrod, while no divine right is elsewhere hinted at in the context, or seems capable of proof. Moreover, it represents Asshur as setting up in the
IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD of Nimrod as mighty a kingdom as Nimrod himself, Asshur building four cities, one of which is emphatically said to have been “great” (verse 12); while Nimrod, on this interpretation, built just the
same number of cities, of which none is specially characterized as “great.” Now, it is in the last degree improbable that Nimrod would have quietly borne so mighty a rival so near him. To obviate such difficulties as these, it has been
proposed to render the words, “out of that land he (Nimrod) went forth into Asshur, or Assyria.”But then, according to ordinary usage of grammar, the word in the original should have been “Asshurah,” with the sign of motion to a
place affixed to it, whereas it is simply Asshur, without any such sign of motion affixed. I am persuaded that the whole

perplexity that commentators have hitherto felt in considering this passage, has arisen from supposing that there is
a proper name in the passage, where in reality no proper name exists. Asshur is the passive participle of a verb, which, in its Chaldee sense, signifies “to make strong,” and, consequently, signifies “being strengthened,” or “made
31
strong.” Read thus, the whole passage is natural and easy (ver. 10), “And the beginning of his (Nimrod’s) kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh.” A beginning naturally implies something to succeed, and here we find
it (ver. 11); “Out of that land he went forth, being made strong, or when he had been made strong (Ashur), and builded Nineveh,” &.
Now, this exactly agrees with the
statement in the ancient history of Justin: “Ninus strengthened the greatness of his acquired
dominion by continued possession. Having subdued, therefore, his neighbors, when, by an
accession of forces, being still further strengthened, he went forth against other tribes,
and every new victory paved the way for another,
he subdued all the peoples of the East.” Thus,
32
then, Nimrod, or Ninus, was the builder of
Nineveh; and the origin of the name of that city,
as “the habitation of Ninus,” is accounted for,33 and light is hereby, at the same time, cast on the
fact, that the name of the chief part of the ruins of Nineveh is Nimrod at this day. Now, assuming
34
that Ninus is Nimrod, the way in which that assumption explains what is otherwise
inexplicable in the statements of ancient history greatly confirms the truth of that assumption itself.
ANCIENT NINEVEH Ninus is said to have been the son of Belus or Bel, and Bel is said to have been the founder of Babylon. If
Ninus was in reality the first king of Babylon, how could Belus or Bel, his father, be said to be the founder of it? Both might very well be, as will appear if we consider who was Bel, and what we can trace of his doings. If Ninus was
Nimrod, who was the historical Bel? He must have been Cush: for the Bible says that “Cush begat Nimrod” and
35
See Chaldee Lexicon in Clavis Stockii, where the verb “asher” is rendered “firmavit
31
roboravit.” Ashur, the passive participle, is consequently “firmatus, roboratus.” Even in Hebrew this sense seems to be inherent in the verb, as may be concluded from the noun te-ashur, the name
of the box-tree (Isaiah 9:13), the wood of that tree being remarkable for its firmness and compactness. Even in the ordinary Hebrew sense, the meaning is substantially the same; for as
Asher means “to prosper,” or “make prosperous,” Ashur, in the participle passive, must signify “prospered,” or “made prosperous.”
Justin, Hist. Rom. Script., vol.ii.p.615. The words of the original are the following:

“Ninus mangitudinem guaestae dominationis continua possessione firmavit. Cum accessione virum fortier, ad alios transirect, et proxima quaeque victoria instrumentum sequentis esset totius Orientis
populos subegit.”

Cush is generally represented as having been a ring leader in the great apostasy. But again, Cush, as the son of Ham,
36 37
was Her-mes or Mercury: for Hermes is just an Egyptian synonym for the “son of Ham.”
The composition of Her-mes is, first, from “Her,” which, in Chaldee, is synonymous with Ham, or Khem, “The
Burnt One.” As “Her” also, like Ham, signified “The Hot or Burning One,” this name formed a foundation for
covertly identifying Ham with the “Sun,” and so deifying the great patriarch, after whose name the land of Egypt was called, in connection with the sun. Khem, or Ham, in his own name was openly worshipped in later ages
in the land of Ham (Bunsen, vol.i.p.373); but this would have been too daring at first. By means of “Her,” the synonym, however, the way was paved for this. “Her” is the name of Horus, who is identified with the sun (Bunsen,
vol.i.p.507), which shows the real etymology of the name to be from the verb to which I have traced it. Then, secondly, “Mes,” is from Mesheh (or, without the last radical, which is omissible, see Parhurst, sub voce, p. 416), Mesh, “to
draw forth.” In Egyptian, we have Ms in the sense of “to bring forth” (Bunsen, vol. I., Hieroglyphical Signs, Append., b. 43, p. 540), which is evidently a different form of the same word. In the passive sense, also, we find Ms used
(Bunsen, Vocabulary, Appendix i.p.470, at bottom, &c., “Ms . . . . born”). The radical meaning of Mesheh in Stockii Lexicon, is given in Latin “Extraxit,” and our English word “extraction,” as applied to birth or descent, shows that
there is a connection between the generic meaning of this word and birth.
This derivation will be found to explain the meaning of the names of the Egyptian kings, Ramesses and Thothmes, the former evidently being “The son of Ra,” or the Sun; for Ramesses is ‘ÍÅxïø ðá ò (Ammianus Marcellinus, lib. 17, cap. 4, p. 162); the latter, in like manner, being “The son of Thoth.” For the very same reason Her-mes is the “Son of Her, or Ham,” the burnt one-that is, Cush. The mythology is now not a myth!
Now, Hermes was the great original prophet of idolatry; for he was recognized by the pagans as the author of
their religious rites, and the interpreter of the gods. The distinguished Gesenius identifies him with the Babylonian
Nebo, as the prophetic god; and a statement of Hyginus shows that he was known as the grand agent in that
movement which produced the division of tongues. His words are these; “For many ages men lived under the
government of Yah, I AM [evidently not the Roman Jupiter, but the YHVH (éäåä) of the Hebrews], without cities
and without laws, and all speaking one language. But after Mercury interpreted the speeches of men (whence an interpreter is called Hermeneutes), the same individual distributed the nations. Then discord began.”38
Here there is a manifest enigma, that is, an obscure riddle. How could Mercury or Hermes have any need to
interpret the speeches of mankind when they “all spake the same language?” To find out the meaning of this, we must go to the language of the Mysteries. Peresh, in Chaldee, signifies “to interpret;” but was pronounced by old Egyptians
and by Greeks, and often by the Chaldees themselves, in the same way as “Peres” to “divide.” Mercury then or Hermes or Cush, “the son of Ham,” was the “DIVIDER of the speeches of men.” He, it would seem, had been the ringleader
in the scheme for building the great city and tower of Babel: and, as the well-known title of Hermes,--”the interpreter of the gods,” would indicate, had encouraged them, in the name of God, to proceed in their presumptuous enterprise,
and so had caused the language of men to be divided, and themselves to be scattered abroad on the face of the earth. Now look at the name of Belus, or Bel, given to the father of Ninus, or Nimrod, in connection with this. While the
Greek name Belus represented both the Baal and Bel of the Chaldees, these were nevertheless two entirely distinct titles. These titles were both alike often given to the same god, but they had totally different meanings. Baal, as we
have already seen, signified “The Lord;” but Bel signified “The Confounder.” When, then, we read that Belus, the father of Ninus, was he that built or founded Babylon, can there be a doubt, in what sense it was that the title of Belus
was given to him? It must have been in the sense of Bel the "Confounder." And to this meaning of the name of the

36
Gregory attributes to Cush what was said more generally to have befallen his son; but his statement
shows the belief in his day, which is amply confirmed from other sources, that Cush had a pre
eminent share in leading man-kind away from the true worship of God.
Ham according to Moses Maimonides committed a homosexual act with his father Noah
37
after he got him drunk on wine, as the scripture says “he saw his nakedness” (Genesis 9:22). Thus
his sons Cush and Nimrod and Caanan were cursed. Ibid. G.F.P. p. 264.

Babylonian Bel, there is a very distinct allusion in Jeremiah 50:2, where it is said "Bel is confounded," that is, "The
Confounder is brought to confusion." That Cush was known to Pagan antiquity under the very character of Bel, "The Confounder," a statement of Ovid very clearly proves. The statement to which I refer is that in which Janus "the god
of gods," from whom all other gods had their origin, is made to say of himself: “The ancients. . . . called me
39 40
Chaos.” Now, first this decisively shows that Chaos was known not merely as a state of confusion, but as the "god
41
of Confusion." But, secondly, who that is at all acquainted with the laws of Chaldaic pronunciation, does not know that Chaos is just one of the established forms of the name of Chus or Cush? Then, look at the symbol of Janus, Fig
42
7, whom "the ancients called Chaos," and it will be seen how exactly it tallies with the doings of Cush, when he is
43
identified with Bel, "The Confounder." That symbol is a club; and the name of "a club" in Chaldee comes from the
very word which signifies "to break in pieces, or scatter abroad." He who caused the confusion of tongues was he
44
who "broke" the previously united earth (Gen 11:1) "in pieces," and "scattered" the fragments abroad. How significant,
then, as a symbol, is the club, as commemorating the work of Cush, as Bel, the "Confounder"? And that significance will be all the more apparent when the reader turns to the Hebrew of Genesis 11:9, and finds that the very word from
which a club derives its name is that which is employed when it is said, that in consequence of the confusion of tongues, the children of men were "scattered abroad on the face of all the earth." The word there used for scattered
abroad is Hephaitz, which, in the Greek form becomes Hephaizt, and hence the origin of the well known but little
45
understood name of Hephaistos, as applied to Vulcan, "The father of the gods."46

From Sir WM. BETHAM'S Etruscan Literature and Antiquities Investigated, 1842. The
43
Etruscan name on the reverse of a medal--Bel-athri, "Lord of spies," is probably given to Janus, in
allusion to his well known title "Janus Tuens," which may be rendered "Janus the Seer," or
"All-seeing Janus." Note the modern Janus Financial Giant on the New York Stock Exchange
which uses the same two faced image as its’ logo and the eye on the American one dollar bill.
In Proverbs 25:18, a maul or club is "Mephaitz." In Jeremiah 51:20, the same word,
44
without the Yod, is evidently used for a club (though, in our version, it is rendered battle-axe); for
the use of it is not to cut asunder, but to "break in pieces." See the whole passage.
There are many instances of a similar change. Thus Botzra becomes in Greek, Bostra;
45
and Mitzraim, Mestraim.
Vulcan, in the classical Pantheon, had not commonly so high a place, but in Egypt

Hephaistos is the name of the ringleader in the first rebellion, as "The Scatterer abroad," as Bel is the name
of the same individual as the "Confounder of tongues." Here, then, the reader may see the real origin of Vulcan's
Hammer, which is just another name for the club of Janus or Chaos, "The god of Confusion;" and to this, as
breaking the earth in pieces, there is a covert allusion in Jeremiah 50:23, where Babylon, as identified with its primeval
god, is thus apostrophized: "How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken"! 48
Now, as the tower-building was the first act of open rebellion after the flood, and Cush, as Bel, was the
ringleader in it, he was, of course, the first to whom the name Merodach, "The great Rebel," must have been given,
49
and, therefore, according to the usual parallelism of the prophetic language, we find both names of the Babylonian god
referred to together, when the judgment on Babylon is predicted: "Bel is confounded: Merodach is broken in pieces" (Jer 50:2).
The judgment comes upon the Babylonian god according to what he had done. As Bel, he had "confounded"
the whole earth, therefore he is "confounded." As Merodach, by the rebellion he had stirred up, he had "broken" the united world in pieces; therefore he himself is "broken in pieces."50
Centaur
The ordinary classical derivation of this name gives little satisfaction; for, even though it could be derived from words that signify "Bull-killers" (and the derivation itself is but lame), such a meaning casts no light at all on the
history of the Centaurs. Take it as a Chaldee word, and it will be seen at once that the whole history of the primitive Kentaurus entirely agrees with the history of Nimrod, with whom we have already identified him. Kentaurus is
evidently derived from Kehn, "a priest," and Tor, "to go round." "Kehn-Tor," therefore, is "Priest of the revolver," that is, of the sun, which, to appearance, makes a daily revolution round the earth. The name for a priest, as written,
is just Khn, and the vowel is supplied according to the different dialects of those who pronounce it, so as to make it either Kohn, Kahn, or Kehn. Tor, "the revolver," as applied to the sun, is evidently just another name for the Greek
Zen or Zan applied to Jupiter, as identified with the sun, which signifies the "Encircler" or "Encompasser,"--the very word from which comes our own word "Sun," which, in Anglo-Saxon, was Sunna (MALLET, Glossary), and of which
we find distinct traces in Egypt in the term sunnu (BUNSEN'S Vocab.), as applied to the sun's orbit.
The Hebrew Zon or Zawon, to "encircle," from which these words come, in Chaldee becomes Don or Dawon, and thus we penetrate the meaning of the name given by the Boeotians to the "Mighty hunter," Orion. That name was
Kandaon, as appears from the following words of the Scholiast on Lycophron, quoted in BRYANT: "Orion, whom the Boeotians call also Kandaon." Kahn-daon, then, and Kehn-tor, were just different names for the same office--the
one meaning "Priest of the Encircler," the other, "Priest of the revolver"--titles evidently equivalent to that of
Bol-kahn, or "Priest of Baal, or the Sun," which, there can be no doubt, was the distinguishing title of Nimrod. As
the title of Centaurus thus exactly agrees with the known position of Nimrod, so the history of the father of the Centaurs does the same.
Let us now continue on the subject at hand, having proven that the myths of antiquities were in fact a reality of man worshiping an evil spirit being in man in a state of confusion. This confusion continues today, to the unsuspecting soul who actually is worshiping “the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.”
In our Bible we read of the many warnings against Baal and Baal worship. We know too that the Bible speaks
of a corrupt religious/economic/political system that satan set up to cause man to worship him rather than the True God
Revelations 17:8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the
48
bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast
that was, and is not, and yet is.
Merodach comes from Mered, to rebel; and Dakh, the demonstrative pronoun affixed,
49
which makes it emphatic, signifying "That" or "The great."
Notes concerning the revealing of the myths have been taken from, “The Two Babylons
50
or The Papal Worship,” by the late Rev. Alexander Hislop, first edition 1916.

of Heaven. Revelations states that the whole world wondered, or was amazed by the beast, one that burdens all of
mankind in every aspect of life, but at the same time displays great wealth, pomp and pageantry.
Baal & Baal Worship
There can be no doubt that Nimrod was worshiped as the god of the
sun long before the scriptures were written. Job is believed to have lived in the time of Seth the son of Adam. He was the son of Aram the grandson of
Seth and would have first hand knowledge of sun worship. Today we have the oral law of the patriarchs written which state; “If I beheld [worshiped]
the sun when it shined, or the moon walking [in] brightness; and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: this also
[were] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judge: for I should have denied the God [that is] above.”51
Baal technically was at first considered subordinate to “EL,” EL
Shaddai, God Almighty, the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob. By the time of the Ugarit Tablets (14 Century B.C.) however, Baal had become the
th
ruler of the universe, that is, man on earth. Therefore the symbols of Baal worship such as Obelisks and pyramid structures permeate the earth and still
remain even up to this present time with millions paying homage to them in various ways.
HELIOPOLIS TEMPLE In the Mayan, Somar, Assyrian and Egyptian societies temples were on their tops where pagan worship was
conducted as an every day occurrence. Entrance to the ancient temple of Re or Ra at Heliopolis had seven pillars. The Bible speaks of the importance of seven in this manner. “Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven
pillars:” and “and unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of
52
God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.”53
In modern Western Societies we see the symbolism of the past
in our banks and government structures with pillars and porches having pyramidion tops. Now, the lesser Nations are subservient to the
lender nations who dominate using the World Bank, IMF and other Global Financial Institutions and a good question is; - why are many
of our banks and other buildings of importance constructed with porches in front of them consisting mostly of seven large white pillars.
Even the seat of American Power and Wisdom is represented
by pillars, the Obelisk and Abraham Lincoln. Americas halls of Justice, both Federal and County have the same features on the
exteriors. They all have the “Doric fluted style columns”, which are purely Egyptian design, and were used in Egypt at least 2000 years
before Greece ever used them. An examples of this column design still stand in Saqqara, and other places throughout Egypt. Is it mere coincidence?
The Ugarit tablets made Baal, that is Nimrod, chief of the Canaanite Pantheon. Remember Canaan was cursed
by Noah in Genesis 9:25 and therefore this whole system of pagan deities called a pantheon was cursed. The Western World’s system of government, economical power and spiritual power was started by Nimrod who being deified

became satan’s symbol, a cursed system in the earth that still exists today. He was worshiped as “The Source of all
54
life and Fertility,” the mighty hero, the lord (beginner) of war and the defeater of the God of heaven, Yah or Jah.55 The “Y” names for God come from the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew
writings and is translated as YH or I AM from where the name Jesus comes from.
The practice of sacred prostitution seems to have been
associated with the worship of Baal. Hosea and Jeremiah, prophets in Hebrew scripture vehemently denounced the worship of Baal, that is
Nimrod in the high places where they often sacrificed their children. Nimrod, satan’s icon and system of deception was set in the earth after
the flood in Noah’s day which destroyed his prior system that he had set up through Cain after man’s fall in Eden. It is recorded in the
Encyclopedia Britannica that Nimrod, the embodiment of satan’s spirit spoke great threatening words in anger against God because God
destroyed his kingdom on earth with the flood.
To the left of the Axometric View of the Temple area of Baalbek is the Temple dedicated to Baachus. (See the next actual
picture and note the pillars in its front.)
The Bible records with clarity the sometimes obscure understanding of Baal worship as actually being the worship of satan.
Substitutions through name changes in cultures as recorded on walls and tablets found through archeological discoveries can be hard to trace and peace together to understand their true
meaning. The abhorrence in which the cult was held probably explains the substitution
of Ish-Bosheth for Esh-Baal, or Jerubbesheth for Jerubabaal, (a name for
Gideon) and of Mephibosheth for MeribBaal. The substituted terms probably mean
“shame.” The same abhorrence is evident by the use of the pejorative name Baal
Zebub, that is, “satan” as recorded in the Bible. As cognates, that is, related to each
other, Baal in other Semitic Languages is Bel in Babylonian religions. Bel was
absolutely Nimrod who demonstrated and led great rebellion against the True God of
creation. The practice of sacred prostitution was associated with the worship of Baal,
that is, Nimrod, man worshiping the creature, that is himself, more than the creator.
Fertility rites are Magico-Religious ceremonies to insure an abundance of food and the birth of strong healthy children. The lustful rites expressed through dances, prayers, incantations and sacred dramas seek to control the
otherwise unpredictable forces of nature. In primitive agricultural societies, natural phenomena such as rainfall, the fecundity of the earth, and the regeneration of nature were frequently personified. One of the most important pagan
Eugene Weber of UCLA traces the start of the Western Civilization back to Nimrod.

myths was the search of the earth goddess for her lost (or dead) child or lover, e.g., Isis and Osiris, Ishtar and Tammuz,
Demeter and Persephone who in art work still seen today are depicted as mother and son in all cultures of the earth. All of these religious fertility customs symbolized the birth, death, and reappearance of vegetation when acted out in
sacred drama and were the fertility rites par excellence.
The temple of Bacchus, Bel, Baal, Horus, Nimrod.
In Papal Italy, as travelers universally admit, all appearance of worshiping the King Eternal and Invisible is
almost extinct, while the Mother and Child are the grand objects of worship. Exactly so, in this latter respect, also was it in ancient
Babylon. The Babylonians, in their popular religion, supremely worshiped a Goddess Mother and a Son, who was represented in
pictures and in images as an infant and child in his mother’s arms. (Fig. 5 and 6) In Egypt, the Mother and the Child were worshiped
under the names of Isis and Osiris. In India, even to this day, as
56
Isi and Iswara; in Asia, as Cybele and Deoius; in Pagan Rome,
57 58
as Fortuna and Jupiter-puer, or Jupiter, the boy; in Greece, as
59
Ceres, the Great Mother, with the babe at her breast, or as Irene,
60
the goddess of Peace, with the boy Plutus in her arms; and even
61
in Thibet, in China, and Japan, the Jesuit missionaries were
astonished to find the counterpart of Madonna and her child as devoutly worshipped as in Papal Rome itself.62
There is strong reason to believe, that Athena, the well known name of Minerva at Athens, had the very same
meaning. The Hebrew Adon, “The Lord,” is, with the points, pronounced Athon. We have evidence that this name was known to the Asiatic Greeks, from whom idolatry, in a large measure, came into European Greece, as a name of
God under the form of “Athan.” Eustathius, in a note on the Periergesis of Dionysius, speaking of local names in the
63
district of Laodicea, says that “Athan is god.” The feminine of Athan, “The Lord,” is Athana, “The Lady,” which in
Osiris, as the child called most frequently Horus. Bunsen, vol. i. p. 438 compared with

The very name by which the Italians commonly desiguate the Virgin, is just the
62
translation of one of the titles of the Babylonian goddess. As Baal or Belus was the name of the
great male divinity of Babylon, so the female divinity was called Beltis. (Hesychius, Lexicon, p. 188.) This name has been found in Nineveh applied to the “Mother of the gods” (Vaux’s Nineveh
and Persepolis, p. 459); and in a speech attributed to Nebuchadnezzar, preserved in EusebII Praeparatio Evangelii, lib.ix.cap. 41, both titles “Belus and Beltis” are conjoined as the titles of the
great Babylonian god and goddess. The Greek Belus, as representing the highest titles of the Babylonian god, was undoubtedly Baal, “The Lord.” Beltis, therefore as the title of the female
divinity, was equivalent to “Baalti,” which in English, is “My Lady,” in Latin, “Mea Domina,” and in Italian, is corrupted into the well-known “Madonna.” In connection with this, it may be
observed, that the name of Juno, the classical “Queen of Heaven,” which in Greek was Hera, also signified “The Lady;” and that the peculiar title of Cybele or Rhea at Rome, was Domina or “The
Lady.” (Ovid, Fasti, lib.iv.v. 340.)

the Attic dialect, is Athena. No doubt, Minerva is commonly represented as a virgin. Thus, man becomes worshiper
of the creature more than the Creator as recorded in the Bible in Romans, much more significant than a mere myth.
64
The Obelisk as a part of fertility symbols is known commonly as the
phallus or phallic. (An erect penis). Displays of phallic symbols, and ritual prostitution are common even today. It
is the very symbol of new life, power and strength. If the offspring produced
are healthy and strong from the works of their hands, then the sun and rain
and all fertility should be worshiped. A strong prosperous nation then can
dominate and become a kingdom to rule. Thus, through the creature satan,
the god of this world is glorified in
65
man more than the true God, our
Creator, Jesus Christ.
Virgins in India were first deflowered by means of the lingam, a
stone phallus symbolizing the god Shiva. Many ancient fertility rites
persist today which include the MayPole dance which derives from spring
rituals to glorify the phallus, or erect penis.
The tallest surviving stele or
Obelisk (pictured at right) at Axum is one of the many splendid monuments erected by the rulers of the kingdom of Axum. Axum or Aksum is an ancient city in the province of Tigré which is
in the northern part of Ethiopia. By about 1000 BC the New Kingdom had fallen, and Kush had emerged as a state that was politically and culturally independent from Egypt. It was a civilization that became wealthy as a result of their
trade with Arabia, Egypt and even India via the Red Sea. In about 725 BC they were able to march down the Nile
66
and conquer the whole of Egypt, where they formed the 25 dynasty of pharaohs. Most of the antiquities of Axum
th 67
still await excavation; those that have been described consist mainly of Obelisks, of which about fifty are still standing, while many more are fallen. The highly finished monoliths are all representations of a many-storied castle, with an
altar at the base of each. They appear to be connected with Semitic sun-worship, and are assigned by Bent to the same period as the temple at Baalbek, though some antiquarians would place them much earlier. Kush, or Cush of course
was the father of Nimrod. Tradition holds that the God of heaven visited Axum and destroyed the chief Obelisk by digging a trench from the river to its foundation.68
Romans 1:24-25 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of
64
their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves: who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.
Amen.

MADONNA ON THE BEAST WITH HORNS & HEADS
Concerning the things which we have
written, the Bible states; Quote! ‘And the angel
said unto me, Wherefore didst thou wonder? I
will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns. The beast that thou sawest
was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and he goeth into perdition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, they whose name
hath not been written on the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall be present. Here is the meaning which hath wisdom.
The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth: And these are seven kings; the five are fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a little while. And the beast that was, and is
not, is himself even an eighth, and is of the seven; and goeth into perdition. And the ten horns that thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast for one hour.
These have one mind, and they give their power and authority unto the beast. These shall war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they also shall overcome that are with
him, called and chosen and faithful. And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall
hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God did put in their hearts to do His mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words
of God shall be accomplished. And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city, which hath a kingdom over the kings of the earth.’ End Quote.
