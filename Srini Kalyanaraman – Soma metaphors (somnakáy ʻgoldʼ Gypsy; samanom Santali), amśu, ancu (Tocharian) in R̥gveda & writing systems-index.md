Soma metaphors (somnakáy ʻgoldʼ-- Gypsy; samanom - Santali), amśu, ancu (Tocharian) in R
̥
gveda & writing systems
Soma is yajñasya ātmā,(RV 9.2.10, 9.6.8); आत्मन् 'essential nature, principle of life, of sensation'. Soma is held in the rocks of iron grid fortresses and is rescued, realized, fetched by the eagle. Within soma, amśu is a component. अंशुजाल aṃśujāla n S A collection of (sun) beams, a pencil of rays. (Marathi) blaze of light (Monier-Williams) jāla is a net of iron fortresses holding amśu 'Soma' (mākṣika 'pyrites'). Yajna realizes Soma, wealth, through purification processes elaborated in detail. अयस् ayas -जाल a. having iron nets; of
impenetrable guiles. (-लम्) an iron net-work; अयोजालानन ननममथ्य नित्त्वा रत्नगृहं
वरम् Rām.3.35.35 (Apte) [cf. Lat. aes, aer-is for as-is; Goth. ais, Thema aisa; Old Germ. êr, iron; Goth. eisarn; Mod. Germ. Eisen.] ayo—jāla n. iron net work; (ayo-) having or carrying iron snares (as demons), AV. xix, 66 (Monier-Williams)

The devatā of ̥rca RV 4.26.4-7 is śyena (suparṇātmā brahma) and of ̥rca RV 4.27.1-5 is śyena. In some ̥rca-s of the two sukta-s, Indra and ātmā are the devatā.
Bloomfield tries to show that gāyatri, the eagle, is the sacerdotal name of Agni, the heavenly Agni (the lightning) who is the eagle. (See embedded: Contributions to the Interpretation of the Veda Maurice Bloomfield in: Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 16 (1896), pp. 1-42 Published by: American Oriental Society DOI: 10.2307/592485 Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/592485). This opinion of Bloomfield is consistent with the semantics: aśani ‘thunderbolt’ cognate śyena ‘falcon’, sena ‘thunderbolt’. The semantics of aśani ‘thunderbolt’ leads to the expression āhangar ‘blacksmith’. (Pashto. Kashmiri)

Translation by Sayana/Wilson RV 4.27:
4.027.01 Being still in the germ, I have known all the births of these divinities in their order; a hundred bodies of metal confined me, but as a hawk I came forth with speed. [i.e., until the sage comprehended the differences between the body and soul, and learned that soul was unconfined, he was subject to repeated births; but in this stage he acquired divine knowledge, and burst through the bonds with the force and celeriy of a hawk from its nest; va_madeva s'yena ru_pam a_stha_ya garbha_d yogena nihsr.tah = Va_madeva, having assumed the form of a hawk, came forth from the womb by the power of Yoga (Ni_timan~jari)].
4.027.02 That embryo did not beguile me into satisfaction, but by the keen energy (of divine wisdom), I triumphed over it; the impeller of all, the sustainer of many, abandoned the foes (of knowledge), and, expanding, passed beyond the winds (of worldly troubles). [The impeller of all: the parama_tma_, or supreme spirit; beyond the winds: the vital airs, or life, the cause of worldly existence, which is pain]. 4.027.03 When the hawk screamed (with exultation) on his descent from heaven, and (the guardians of the Soma) perceived that the Soma was (carried away) by it then, the archer of Kr.s'a_nu, pursuing with the speed of thought, and stringing his bow, let fly an arrow against it. 4.027.04 The straight-flying hawk carried off the Soma from above the vast heaven, as (the As'vins carried off) Bhujyu from the region of Indra, and a falling feather from the middle of the bird dropped from him wounded in the conflict. [antah parn.am tan madhye sthitam; one nail of the left foot and the shaft was broken by the collision, the fragments of the nail became the quills of the fretful porcupine, those of the arrow, water-snakes, flying foxes, and worms]. 4.027.05 Now may Maghavan accept the pure nutritious (sacrificial) food in a white pitcher, mixed with milk and curds, offered by the priests; the upper part of the sweet (beverage) to drink for his exhilaration; may the hero accept (it) to drink for (his) exhilaration.
aṃśu (अंशु) End of a thread.a minute particle; ‘a ray of light’;
Soma; सूयाांशुनिनिमन्ननमवारनवन्दम् (sūryāṃśubhirbhinnamivāravindam) Ku.1.32; Iustre,

(अंशु). stem or juice of the Soma plant; ray of light; a filament (especially of the Soma plant); a kind of Soma libation, [Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa]
Kanda IV, adhyaya 6, brahmana 1
1. Now, the Aṃśu (graha), forsooth, is no other than Prajāpati: that (cup) is his (Yajña's or the Sacrificer's) self, for Prajāpati is the self. Hence when they draw that (cup) they produce



11
that self of his. Therein they lay these vital airs, according to as these vital airs, the grahas, are explained; and verily the sacrificer is born with his whole body in yonder world.
...
6. Now there is a piece of gold in that (spoon): that he smells at. And if he either galls or scratches himself at this (sacrifice),--gold being immortal life,--he lays that immortal life into his own self.
...
Kanda XI, adhyaya 5, brahmana 9 ADĀBHYA-GRAHA.
1. Now, the Aṃśu (cup of Soma)[1], indeed, is no other than Prajāpati; and it is the body of this (sacrifice), for Prajāpati, indeed, is the body. And the Adābhya[2] (cup of Soma) is no other than speech. When he draws the Aṃśu-cup, and then the Adābhya-cup, he thereby constructs the body of this (sacrifice) and then establishes that speech therein.
...
Kanda V, adhyaya 1, brahmana 2 1. He draws the Aṃśu[1] (graha), just for completeness’ sake, for it is therefor that he draws the Aṃśu. After that he draws those recognised Agniṣṭoma cups[2] up to the Āgrayaṇa.
Verse 1.9 [Birth of Brahmā]-- Manusmrti िदण्डमिवैद्धमं सहस्ांशुसमप्रिम् । िेत्पस्मञ्जज्ञ स्वयं ह्मब्रा सवमलोकनपिामहः ॥ ९ ॥
That became the golden egg, resplendent like the Sun; in that (egg) he (Hiraṇyagarbha) himself was born as Brahmā, the ‘Grand-father’ of the whole world.—(9)
Medhātithi’s commentary (manubhāṣya):
First of all Primordial Matter develops in the form of Clay; i.e., on account of the contact of Hiraṇyagarbha’s ‘seed,’ it become solidified; and this is what is described as having become an ‘egg.’—‘Golden,’ gold, made up of gold; i.e., in its brilliance it resembled the thing made of gold.
“But this statement (that the egg was of gold) is contained in the scriptures, and we do not find any such term as ‘like’ or ‘resembling’ (which would have justified the interpretation of ‘golden’ as resembling gold),—how then can we, in the absence of any other authority, explain the term figuratively?”
Our answer to the question is as follows:—Later on we find the statement—‘by means of the two forces, he created Heaven and Earth’ (Verse 13); and as a matter of fact, this Earth is found to consist of clay, and not of gold entirely; and it is in view of this fact that we have taken the epithet ‘golden’ figuratively.

Purification of Soma is the process of Yajna. Sound emanating from the process is a roar or bellow, signifying the use of bellows in a smelter-furnace. (Rigveda 9.95.4)
Soma in Rigveda is described as from maujavata (Rigveda 10.34.1); Soma dwells on the mountains (giristha), grows in the mountains (parvatavridh)(Rigveda 9.46.1); mountains are also Soma backed (Atharva Veda 3.21.10). Soma is placed on the rock (‘Varuna has placed Agni in the waters, the Sun in heaven and Soma on the rock'--Rigveda 5.85.2). aṃśu (अंशु), 'shoot or stalk' is the part of Soma which is pressed. (Rigveda 9.67.28). The whole Soma is andhas (Gk. ἄνθος)(Rigveda 8.32.28) brought by the eagle from heaven (Rigveda 4.26.6; Rigveda 9.61.10). andhas is annam, food: अन्धस् andhas n.

16. The Sacrificer now takes those (remains of the cakes) into his joined palms and throws them upwards higher than a cow can reach. Thereby they cut out his (Rudra's) darts from their bodies. If they fail to catch them, they touch (those that have fallen to the ground). Thereby they make them medicine, and hence, if they fail to catch them, they touch them.
17. Having then packed them into two net-work baskets and tied them to the two ends of either a bamboo staff or the beam of a balance, he steps aside towards the north; and if he meets with a tree or a stake or a bamboo or an ant-hill, he fastens them thereon, with the text

(Vāj. S. III, 61), 'These, O Rudra, are thy provisions; therewith depart beyond the Mūjavats!'-(supplied) with provisions people indeed set out on a journey: hence he thereby dismisses him supplied with provisions whithersoever he is bound. Now in this case his journey is beyond the Mūjavats: hence he says, 'Depart beyond the Mūjavats!'--'with thy bow unstrung and muffled up--,' whereby he means to say, 'Depart propitious, not injuring us[10];' 'Clad in a skin,'--whereby he lulls him to sleep[11]; for while sleeping he injures no one: hence he says, 'Clad in a skin.'
