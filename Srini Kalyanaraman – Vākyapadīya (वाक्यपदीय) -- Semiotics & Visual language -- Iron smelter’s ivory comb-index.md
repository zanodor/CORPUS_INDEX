“The taxila cross at Lahore Cathedral, Pakistan. There hangs on one of the walls of
the Lahore Cathedral, a small framed cross. This is the famous Taxila Cross found just
outside the ruins of Sirkap in 1935. This was a time when a book titled The Acts of
Saint Thomas was well known. Discovered in 1822 in Syria, the book told of how St
Thomas, having been assigned by Christ to preach the Gospel to the Indians, arrived
by boat in the capital of King Gondophares.”

Model of visual processing in
Meluhha seafaring merchant, artisan’s brain
The artisan, seafaring maritme merchant is an iron smelter; in the role of a scribe,
designs a hypertext, dotted-circle to portray his or her profession in a visual
language.The centre of the dotted circle is dāya ‘one’ in dice; Homonym ḍhāuʻ red
chalk, red ochre ʼ (whence ḍhāuā ʻreddishʼ.The sound of morpheme ‘dhā’ evokes the visual cortex ‘sound’ images of dhmā ‘bellows blowing, a blower who is dhamaka’-
blacksmith (as blowing the forge), Uṇ. ii, 35; dhmātṛ m. a blower, smelter or melter (of
metal), a contrivance for blowing or melting RV. v, 9, 5 अध स्म यस्याचर्यः संम्यक्सयन्ति

47, 13-15; AV. ] the idea of wishing to remove calamity to T°, and the view of the Tritas
being the keepers of nectar, Soma, metal wealth. [RV. vi, 44, 23]. Thus, Mohenjo-daro
priest is Potr̥, Soma purifier, wealth producer.

[quote]Figure 6. Model of Circadian Regulation of BBB Efflux
During the day, circadian clock regulation in the PG lowers levels of gap
junctions, reducing connectivity with the SPG. The level of [Mg2+]i is
high in the SPG, which promotes activity of the efflux transporters,
reducing permeability of xenobiotics. During the night, the PG clock
increases gap junctions, thereby increasing connectivity with the SPG.
The Mg2+ ions diffuse from SPG into the PG, lowering the [Mg2+]i in the
SPG. The efflux transporters reduce activity due to the decline in
[Mg2+]i, and xenobiotics are retained in the brain. [unquote]

[quote]The reward pathways (olfactory and gustatory circuits) of the honey bee brain and
fruit fly brain. Schematic frontal views of a cross-section of the central honey bee (A) and
fruit fly (B) brain (head capsule and eyes removed). The olfactory (CS) pathway is
depicted in light blue (light grey in the print version). Olfactory neurons send information
to the brain via the antennal nerve. These neurons form synapses within the glomeruli of
the antennal lobes (ALs) onto local interneurons (not shown) and projection neurons
conveying olfactory information to the lateral horn (LH) and the mushroom bodies (MBs).
In the honey bee brain (A), the gustatory (US) pathway involves the VUMmx1 neuron
(brown, light grey in the print version), which projects from the gna- thal ganglion to the
LH, AL and MB. VUMmx1 is bilaterally symmetrical, but in this figure only the right side
is shown. Abbreviations: CS, conditioned stimulus; US, unconditioned stimulus;
VUMmx1, ventral unpaired medial neuron 1 of the maxillary neuromere. Figure adapted
from Perry and Barron (2013) with permission. [unquote]

The circadian clocks of the IGL and sPVZ are contacted by the SCN but their states are
not yet characterized (grey). (B) Metabolic interaction between peripheral organs
(bottom, grey area) and the brain (top, yellow area) via blood vessels (middle, red area).
Feeding triggers the pathways depicted in black, whereas exercise and fasting trigger
the pathways depicted in light blue. Both pathways converge at the level of Ac-CoA to
keep up ATP production via the TCA cycle. In astrocytes (green) this maintains the
Gln–Glu cycle and Gln–Glu-GABA cycle in order to keep up neuronal signaling
(orange cyclic pathways in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively). In
this way, the firing potential of neurons (purple glutamatergic and blue GABAergic) is
maintained. --contd
