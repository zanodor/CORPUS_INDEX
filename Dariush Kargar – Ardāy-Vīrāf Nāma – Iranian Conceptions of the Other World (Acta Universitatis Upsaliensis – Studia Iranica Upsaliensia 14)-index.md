Abstract
Kargar, D. 2009. Ardāy-Vīrāf Nāma. Iranian Conceptions of the Other World. Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis. Studia Iranica Upsaliensia 14. 241+79 pp. Uppsala. ISBN 978-91-554-7679-3.
The present thesis consists of an edition of an Iranian literary work whose theme is a journey to the Other World, namely the Ardāy-Vīrāf Nāma. The version of this work which is here edited and commented on is a prose version in the Zoroastrian Persian language. A discussion about Iranian conceptions of the Other World is also an integrated part of the thesis. The text of the Ardāy-Vīrāf Nāma is edited employing a text critical method by using six manuscripts. The oldest manuscript, which has been used as the base manuscript for editing the text, was written in 896 A.Y. (Yazdgirdī)/1527 A.D. The edited text is also translated into English, and followed by a Commentary on names, unusual words and Zoroastrian terms used in the text. Other Iranian documents about journeys to the Other World are studied in this thesis as well, and all are compared to the Ardāy-Vīrāf Nāma. The Zoroastrian Persian version of this work is also compared to its Parsig version. The differences between the Zoroastrian Persian and the Parsig versions indicate that they have their background in two different world views. To prove this theory, some significant elements in the Zoroastrian Persian version, which demonstrate that this is a pre-Zoroastrian epic narrative, have been compared to some elements in the Parsig version that show that this is a religious Zoroastrian account. Possible reasons for the change in Ardāy-Vīrāf Nāma from apre-Zoroastrian epic narrative into a Zoroastrianreligious one are also suggested. A king named Davānūs is one of the Ardāy-Vīrāf Nāma personages. In an appendix, the historical personality of Davānūs is discussed with reference to Arabic, Persian and Greek historiography.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This thesis is the result of my research over about five years. Of course, many people helped me in this work. In other words, without the favour of those who helped me, this research would not have been successfully completed at the present time. For this reason, I now want to thank each one of those who helped me. Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors, Mrs. Carina Jahani and Mr. Bo Utas, who assisted me in all stages of this research. I am particularly grateful to Bo Utas because at the nearness of his retirement he accepted to be my supervisor, which means that I became his last Ph.D. student. Along with them, I give my sincere thanks to Mrs. Judith Josephson for helping me in editing and improving the translation of the text as well as for reading the final manuscript and providing useful comments. After my supervisors, I am thankful to my wife Giti Radji, my daughter Forogh Kargar and my son Mazdak Kargar, who were my supporters and companions in all conditions. I am very thankful to them, although I know that my appreciation is a small token in view of their great love. I greatly appreciate my friends’ efforts to provide the microfilms of the manuscripts. I therefore thank Mr. Nasser Pakdaman, Mr. Homayoun Katouzian, Mr. Mehdi Esteᤱdadi Shad, Mr. Mehrdad Fallahzadeh, Mrs. Shernaz Cama and Mr. Rham Aša for their valuable contribution. I am also grateful to all other friends who assisted me by presenting sources, commenting on earlier versions of my manuscript etc., Mr. Rahmat Kheiri, Mr. ᤱAtaollah Montazeri, Mr. Frantz Grenet, Mr. Reza Rezvani, Miss.

System of transcription
The transcription system for Persian in this thesis follows the table found on the following page. It is worth mentioning that words from other languages found in the edited text, for instance words of Avestan and Parsig origin, have all been transcribed on the basis of the same method. The transcription method for Parsig words is based on MacKenzie (1990), and that of Avestan words on Hoffmann (1975-1976).

I. Introduction
Ard y-V r f N ma is one of the most highly esteemed literary works among Zoroastrians, after the Avesta. It is the journey report of a man named V r f to the Other World. After drinking a substance, he falls asleep. Then, guided by two of Ohrmazd’s Holy Immortals, he visits the Other World. The first part of the Other World is the place of those who pass the time in joy and happiness, because they have been virtuous in this world. The other part is the place of those who are in constant pain and torment, because they have been evil-doers in the present world. And finally, the third place is where those whose good and evil deeds have been equal in the world are to be encountered. When he woke up, V r f asked for his journey report to be written down, for all people to be aware of what it is like in the Other World.
The influence and importance of the Ard y-V r f N ma was so great that during several centuries it was translated into all the languages in use by the Zoroastrians: Parsig, Pazand, Sanskrit, Old Gujarati, Zoroastrian Persian (several prose and versified versions), and New Gujarati (several versions).1 J. A. Pope published the first translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma into English in 1816. Due to the importance and value of this work, researchers of Iranian studies throughout the world have been engaged either in translating the text into different languages or in researching about the work during two hundred years after Pope. The existence of several different translations of the Ard y-V r f N ma into French, English and Persian either in prose or in verse, in addition to much other research done around the work itself, e.g. comparing it with similar works in other cultures, shows the importance and value of the work. The aim of the present thesis is to edit the Zoroastrian Persian prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma and to conduct research around it. The first chapter consists of an introduction. In the second chapter the background and history of the different versions of the work are discussed. The name of V r f, his personality and his time are also studied in this chapter. Furthermore, all other works available that mention V r f’s name and his journey are referred to and discussed. In this
1 The Sasanids attempted to remove the Parthian heritage completely and managed to do it in part. Therefore, unfortunately, there is no trace of the Ard y-V r f N ma in the Pahlav n g language (Parthian) nowadays, even if there may have been such a thing at one time.



16
chapter, for the first time, an Arabic version of the Ard y-V r f N ma is presented. Illustrated versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma are discussed in this chapter as well. A conspectus of all versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma in different languages is presented at the end of the chapter. The third chapter discusses the Other World in other Iranian works in different languages from ancient times to the present, the main subject of which is a journey to the Other World. The accounts in these works are compared to the Ard y-V r f N ma with particular focus on similarities. The fourth chapter identifies previous research related to the Zoroastrian Persian prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma. The fifth chapter describes the manuscripts of the Zoroastrian Persian prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma. All the twelve manuscripts of this document which are known, most of which are kept in various libraries all over the world are introduced in this chapter. The six manuscripts which were used to edit the text body for the present thesis have been fully studied and described in detail. The editing method of the text is also presented in this chapter. A selection from the text itself of words such as ancient verbs and various grammatical structures is listed. A Stemma Codicum of the manuscripts used to edit the text is found at the end of the chapter. The sixth chapter is a translation of the Zoroastrian Persian prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma into English. This is the first time that the full Zoroastrian Persian version is published entirely in a major world language. The seventh chapter consists of commentaries to elucidate the meaning of certain words, such as religious terms, celebrations, and mythic and Zoroastrian’s personages mentioned in the text. The purpose of the eighth chapter is to compare the Zoroastrian Persian prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma to that in Parsig. There is a discussion of possible reasons for the fact that some parts of the account are found in one version but not in the other, or that some sections are more expanded and detailed in one of the versions. The ninth chapter compares the Zoroastrian Persian and Parsig versions from a new point of view. It ventures the theory that the Ard y-V r f N ma is originally a pre-Zoroastrian document. By describing in detail the differences between the Zoroastrian Persian and the Parsig version, it indicates the antiquity of the Zoroastrian Persian version in comparison to the Parsig version. Then an attempt is made to demonstrate by evidence from the two versions that the Ard y-V r f N ma is a very ancient narrative, belonging to the pre-Zoroastrian Iranian society where V r f, the shaman, had travelled to the Other World and reported on his journey in an originally non-religious epical narration. Some traces remain in the Zoroastrian Persian version from this epical narration. The appendix discusses a personage called Dav n s, who is visited by V r f in the Other World. The name of this person has constantly been discussed during the two hundred years that have passed from the beginning of



17
research around the Ard y-V r f N ma. Arabic, Persian and the Greek historical accounts have been studied about this personality for the first time in this chapter in order to prove that Dav n s is the Achaemenid king Darius I. A bibliography is found at the end of the English section of the book. The Zoroastrian Persian section begins from the right side of the book since Persian is read from right to left. It consists of the Zoroastrian Persian text of the Ard y-V r f N ma edited according to the critical editing method. Since the text body of the Ard y-V r f N ma contains old words, terms and verbs, which give this work a special value and importance, an index is provided for selected old words, terms and verbs after the Zoroastrian Persian text.
Previous Research
For the first time, the full text of the Zoroastrian Persian prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma has been edited and translated in this thesis. Prior to this, on the basis of a manuscript, manuscript M, only the introduction of this version was translated and published by Haug and West in 1872. Their work was based only on one manuscript, and all the errors and omissions of that manuscript are repeated as well. After them, Muᤱ n (1946) edited and published the same introduction on the basis of Haug and West’s edition. However, since the manuscript M was not available to Muᤱ n, and he did not have access to other manuscripts, all the misreadings by Haug and West were also repeated in his edition. ᤱAf f (1964) published the edited text of Muᤱ n as the preface of a book entitled the Ard y-V r f N ma versified by Zartušt Bahr m Pajd . Apart from these works, there are presentations of different manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma in library catalogues as well as scattered hints to these manuscripts, all mentioned in chapte IV.
The Aim
At the beginning, the main object of this thesis was to edit the Zoroastrian Persian version of the Ard y-V r f N ma, to translate the text into English and to compare it with the Parsig version. However, the aim was extended in the course of the work, and some other objectives were added along with the primary aim. Research concerning Iranian conceptions of journeys to the Other World on the basis of all texts available is one such aim. Others are research about all versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma which have survived, about the origin of the Ard y-V r f N ma and its initial version, and finally about one of the Ard y-V r f N ma personages named Dav n s who is mentioned in the Sipand Nask, the Š yest N -Š yest and the យaddar Na᠒r as well.



18
Because of these new objectives, the volume of this thesis grew to be twice that of the initially planned work.
The Method
The process of editing the text body of the Ard y-V r f N ma was carried out on the basis of a Critical Edition method. For this, manuscript N, which is the oldest of all the manuscripts, has been chosen as the basic manuscript. Differences between this manuscript and all other variants are listed in footnotes. However, due to the manuscript situation of the Ard y-V r f N ma, it was not possible to use a strictly critical edition method. Therefore, the editing method is a mixing of the critical and eclectic methods. The most ancient manuscript is dated to the year 896 A.Y./1527 A.D. Even though the date of the actual translation of the Zoroastrian Persian prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma is unknown, attempt has been made, by studying the words and also by the literary style of the work, to show that the text was probably written in the fourth or fifth century A.H./tenth or eleventh A.D. The editing method and the style of the text are explained extensively in chapter five.
The Sources
Two types of sources have been used in the thesis: Manuscript Sources and Printed Sources. To the first group belong those manuscripts of the Ard yV r f N ma that have been used to edit the text. Manuscripts of other works have been used in other chapters of this thesis. The second type, Printed Sources, include research done around the Ard y-V r f N ma or in area related to the main subject of each chapter of the thesis. The complete list of all sources is found in the bibliography.

II. The background and history of a text
Among the pre-Islamic Iranian-Zoroastrian works, two have enjoyed particuarly good luck: the Ard y-V r f N ma2 and the J m sp-N ma. The first one is a report of a journey to the Other World and a foretelling of what will happen to the human after death. The other one predicts what the end of the world will be like and what will happen to Iran at that time. Both books talk about the unseen and what has not happened yet. They talk of a world which no one else had talked about before and about matters which the curious human being constantly wishes to discover and to get to know. Due to this, both these books have a marvellous attraction. On the one hand, the charm of the works and, on the other hand, the recommendation and exhortation by the Zoroastrian priests to study them have caused these works to be read and considered by Zoroastrians both in and outside Iran. Thus, both works have been copied, re-written and translated into other languages of Zoroastrians at all times. This in itself is another reason why these two works have survived for so long. The main subject of the Ard y-V r f N ma is the journey of a man called V r f to the Other World. He passes into a state of unconsciousness after using an intoxicating drink and travels to the Other World while he is unconscious. V r f visits some cheerful and fortunate people in orchards and rosegardens who are enjoying the favour and grace of Paradise. However, he also sees some other people in Hell, who are in pain and suffering and who live in frosty and miserable places, and are either being tormented or persecuted by harmful creatures. The lucky and cheerful people are those who have done good deeds in this world, but the people who are immersed in pain and suffering are those who have been malevolent and evil-doing in the present world. The third group is the people whose virtues and wrongdoings have been equal and they are now in Limbo, where they are neither suffering nor rejoicing. V r f wakes up from his state of unconsciousness after seven days, and then he begins to tell about his journey and asks for a scribe to write the report down.
2 The present study is done on the basis of the Zoroastrian Persian version of the Ard y-V r f N ma. There are different forms of the name in different versions of the account, but in all parts of this study V r f, Ard y-V r f and the Ard y-V r f N ma are used, since these are the forms found in the Zoroastrian Persian version.



20
There are some main issues in the Ard y-V r f N ma that need special attention; the name of V r f, his personality, the time of V r f and the time when the Ard y-V r f N ma was written,3 V r f’s journey report4 and the subject of it, the various versions of the work, and finally the manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma where illustrations are included. These are the points that have been considered and studied by Iranists in different parts of the world during the last two centuries.
The name of V r f
Fravard n Yašt is the most ancient text which has mentioned the name of V r f. Here the name has been recorded in the form of W r z (Fravard n Yašt: XXV.101).5 The name has been recorded with the form of , in the Parsig version (Codex K20 1931: fol. 5r.).6 Taking into consideration that the last letter of the name is applied for the three phonemes ‘f’, ‘p’, ‘b’, and ‘c’, in the Parsig language, the name can be transcribed as W r f, W r p and W r b. The last letter is also transcribed as ‘w’ in a few cases.7 Thus, the name can be transcribed as W r w as well. Probably due to this, the name is found twice with the form of V r v. The name in the Pazand version is written in the form of (Antia 1909: 358)8, the transcription of which is Ard V r .9 In Sanskrit and Old Gujarati, the name of Ard y-V r f is transcribed in the form of Ard -Gv r (Bharucha 1920: 1). Haug and West have transcribed the name a little differently, in the translation of the introduction of the Sanskrit version (1872: Lxxvii), namely as Ardd -Gv r .10 That is not surprising at all, since the name does not end in the letter that can be read as ‘f’, ‘p’ and ‘b’ in the Sanskrit and Old Gujarati versions. The reason for this is that both these versions have been translated on the basis of the Pazand version (Bharucha 1920: II).
3 The time of V r f himself and the probable time of the codification of the Ard y-V r f N ma will be discussed in chapter IX. 4 The main subject of the work, V r f’s journey to the other world, is studied in chapters III, VII and VIII. 5 See also Geldner 1886-1896; Westergaard 1852-54: I.238; Wolff 1924: 244; Lommel 1927: 125. 6 The first part of the name could be written with the form of as well. 7 The word could be given as an example in this case, which will be bpyt’ in transliteration and baw d in transcription ( m zg r-Tafa╲╲ul 1994: 42). 8 Haug and West have recorded the name in the form of Ard V r in the introduction of the Pazand version (1872: Lxxvii). 9 Thus, neither Muᤱ n’s transcription of the name as V r f (1946: 5) nor Gignoux’s W r z (1984: 8) in the Pazand version can be correct. 10 Bharucha has transcribed the name Ardd -Gv r in his introduction (1920: II), and thus followed Haug and West’s transcription.



21
Apart from the Zoroastrian Persian version, in which the name has been recorded as V r f, it has also been written as V r f in New Persian (Arabic) script in the margin of a Parsig manuscript (Codex K26 1932: fol. 8r.). In addition to this, the name has also been recorded in the form of V r f in M n Xrad in verse by D r b Hurmazdy r Sanj na (S.P.38: 17b). The researchers are not in general agreement about the name of V r f. Some have written the name with the form of V r f (Haug-West 1872; Darmesteter 1883: I.75, II.298;11 Barthélemy: 1887; Jackson 1899: 157; Jamasp Asa 1902; Maddox 1904; Pavry 1927: 53; Modi 1932‘a’: 107; Blochet 1933: 49; Wikander 1946: 44; de Menasce 1949: 1-6). However, some others have recorded it with the form of W r z (Bartholomae 1904: 1454; Jackson 1928: 139;12 Christensen 1931: 12; Henning 1951: 51; Molé 1963: 179; Nyberg 1974: II.213; Boyce 1968‘a’: 48; Gignoux 1984). It seems that because the form W r z is the one found in the Avesta, this form is more accepted at present (Tafa╲╲ul 1997: 167). Anyway, some researchers such as Bartholomae, Nyberg and Boyce have accepted the form W r z, even though they also accept the form V r f as a traditional reading of the name. There are fewer problems with the first part of the name. The Avestan word of ašሇvan- is art van- in Old Persian and ahlaw or ard in Parsig, which means ‘righteous’13 (Gnoli 1979: 387).14 The Pazand form of the word is aš . Ard y is also translated into aš in one of the manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrian Persian (MS.L. fol.7a). The name of Ard y-V r f has a particular story in the Zoroastrian Persian version. In addition to the title of the book which is mentioned at the beginning in the form of Ard y-V r f N ma; the name of this personality is given as “Ard y-V r f” ten times in the text body. All these cases occur when he has already come back from his journey to the Other World. According to all the Zoroastrian Persian manuscripts, when V r f woke up, all the priests and authorities called him “Ard y-V r f”, which means ‘the righteous Viraf’: « ဆ င ဂ @| ကဒ ဂ စ * ထစ^ ^ | » “You are welcome, o Ard y-V r f, and that means when looking back that he is heavenly righteous” (lines 86-87).15 The reason for giving this name to V r f at such a time, is just because he has returned from the Other World. This is actually the same name that he was called by Sur š the righteous (first episode), Amš spand n (the Holy Immortals) (third episode) and Urd bihišt the Holy
11 Darmesteter has also suggested the probability of reading the name either V r p or V r b (Darmesteter 1883: I. 298). 12 Jackson wrote the name V r f in 1899 and V r z in 1928. 13 However, Ard does not mean righteous everywhere (Gignoux 1984: 10). 14 The Pazand form of the name is aš . Ard y is translated into aš in one of the manuscript of the Ard y-V r f N ma, manuscript L (MS.L: fol.7a). 15 The sentence is written as: «ဆ စ င က ဂ ဂ * ထစ^ ^ ^ | » “You are welcome, oh Ard y-V r f, which means the heavenly and the righteous” in manuscript L, which in some parts is simplified in comparison to the other manuscripts (MS.L: fol.7a).

Immortal (twelfth episode) at the commencement of his journey to the Other World. While giving him the message to take to this world, Ohrmazd (sixtieth episode) also calls him in by this name at the end of his journey. However, the name of this personality is mentioned sixteen times in the form of V r f, all before his departure to the Other World.16 Gnoli believes that the term Ard y points to the post mortem fortunate (Gnoli 1979: 387-388). Gignoux holds that Ard y has a special meaning in connection with the post mortem world (Gignoux 1979: 41-79; Gignoux 1984: 9). The idea that the “being Ard y” of V r f has occurred after his ascension to the Other World, is here introduced in the light of the previously presented examples from the Zoroastrian Persian text.17 Some of the Zoroastrian Persian and the New Persian sources have seen Ard or Ard y as equal to the name of V r f’s himself. The Farhang-i nandr j (Mu9ammad P dš h 1956: 7.4528), has identified this name as Ard y, and the ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may-i ᜸al l va ᜸ar m ba q ‘ida-yi d n (1922: I.270), Farhang-i Raš d (Tattavi 1875:I.44) and the Burh n-i Q tiሁ (Tabr z 1983: 1.99)18 have written the name as Ard and regarded it as the name of V r f himself.19 Both forms, Ard and Ard y, are found in Nairangi b y-d dan.20 In praise of V r f, Ard y is mentioned as part of his name, and later in the sentence ard meaning ‘saint’ is used as a separate adjective describing V r f: ဃစ * ထစ^ »

«! ထ ထ “May Ard y-V r f, whose immortal soul is sacred, be kept in good remembrance now!” (Unv l 1922: I.356). Six forms of the name V r f are found in the Zoroastrian Persian version: Ard y-V r f (line 86)21, Ard -V r f (line 91), V r f (line 31), V r v (footnote 99), Ard v r (MS.N: fol.0b), Ard (line 118).22 One of the most remarkable meanings suggested by Kellens for Ard y-V r f is *v ra-aza- (“qui mène les hommes”, i.e. “who leads mankind”) a term which is very well-suited to V r f’s personality (Kellens 1974 Mayrhofer 1977: I/95). Besides in the Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrian Persian, this name has been recorded as Ard y-V r f in other works as follows: the Ard y-V r f N ma in verse by Zartušt Bahr m (Zar tušt Bahr m Pajd 1964: 21.verse 407), the Qi᠀᠀a-yi sanj n versified by Bahman Kay-Qub d Sanjana (1915:
16 The personage is called V r f three times by Ohrmazd and the Holy Immortals in the Other World. 17 See the studies of Belardi 1979 for more information. 18 The name has been written Ard upon the rhythm of fard in Burh n-i Q tiሁ and then it is added that some called him Ard d, too, upon the rhythm of Farh d, and his father’s name was V r f with a kasra to mark the Persian vowel sound (Tabr z 1983: 1.99). 19 The Parsis asked in a letter written ca. 1022 A.Y./1654 A.D. to the Iranian Zoroastrian about J m sp’s and V r f’s fathers’ names. The Iranian Zoroastrians replied: “J m sp’s father’s name was Hub b, the sage, but V r f’s father’s name is not known” (Unv l 1922: II.422). This letter shows to what extent V r f and J m sp are important to Zoroastrians. 20 Nairang-i b y-d dan is a kind of prayer said in a ritual ceremony of aromatizing the fire. 21 The first occurrence of this form in the text. 22 The form of Ard is used only in manuscript L.

Still, the name of V r f is known as a boy’s name after millennia. This name is being used among the Iranian Zoroastrians in three dialect forms: V r f in Persian, V yr p in the dialect of the Zoroastrians in Kirm n, and V rup and V ruvug25 (Sur šiy n 1977: 200) in the dialect of the Zoroastrians in Yazd. Apart from the above-mentioned cases, Wir b is a family name among the Iranian Zoroastrians (Bah r 1996: 329).
V r f’s personality
The name of V r f has been mentioned in many Zoroastrian works due to his value and importance. V r f himself, as well as his journey is described in these works. V r f’s visit to Paradise is mentioned in the Farziy t-N ma, and also the importance of him killing the xrafstar (noxious creature) (P hlan 1924: 33).26 The ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may-i ᜸al l va ᜸ar m ba q ‘ida-yi d n mentions the three bowls of wine that were drunk by V r f before his journey to the Other World (Unv l 1922: I.270-271). The Kaifiyyat-in qissa-yi sul᠐ n Ma᜸m d-i aznav talks about V r f’s ascending to the Other World and about his return and report (Rosenberg 1909: I.30). The J m sp (S.P.46: 430b) makes mention of the belief that the world will be purified and renewed by V r f. In some works, V r f has been mentioned either as a m bad or the m bad of the m bad n. Farhang-i Jah ng r writes that the Parsis tell that there were two m bads at the time of Ardaš r-i B bak n: firstly V r f and secondly M rasfand, but that V r f was superior and the supreme one (MS.ADD24413: 22a). Ard is known as one of the Magi, and the m bad of
23 Both the forms Ard y-V r f (Aša 2002‘a’: 394) and V r f (ibid: 395) are found in the Saugand-N ma.
24 For more information about Ard and V r f, see the following studies: Mayrhofer 1977: I/95.371; Gignoux 1986: II/45.118; II/183.1005. 25 It is worth noting that this form of the name is not mentioned any other Iranian source, neither Zoroastrian nor non-Zoroastrian. 26 The Farziy t-N ma has two sections; the Persian section begins from the right and the page numbers are in Persian, the English section begins from the left and the page numbers are in English. This reference is to the Persian section.

m bad n in the the Farhang-i Raš d (Tattavi: I.44). V r f is also known as a m bad and learned man in the Farhang-i nandr j (Mu9ammad P dš h 1956: 1.206). Other works have also turned him into a superhuman and an epic personality. Probably for the sake of his journey to the Other World, some works have given him an even higher position than just that of a traveler to the Other World. He is known as a prophet according to the Parsis. Burh n-i Q tiሁ (Tabr z 1983: 1.99) and Farhang-i nandr j (Mu9ammad P dš h 1956: 1. 206) testify to this. Also the Zoroastrians in Iran view him as a prophet according to the Farhang-i Niᡄ m (D ᤱ -ul-isl m 1927: 1.211). It is quoted in the Saugand-N ma that according to zarb d-i M rasfand n every Zoroastrian should believe without doubt in the good religion of the Mazdayasn n (Mazda-Worshippers) and in V r f’s words (Saugand-N ma Aša 2002‘a’: 395). The name of V r f is mentioned in the Nairang-i b yd dan together with the names of the great men of Ir nšahr, such as Zarathustra, Gušt sp, Man ihr, raj, Far d n, Siy vaš, G darz, Rustam and Garš sp, (Unv l 1922: I.355-358). The treatise of the R z-i yazd n 27 could be one of the most important documents on V r f’s personality, because this is the only source that has talked about V r f’s life after his journey to the Other World. The author of the treatise, Bahr m Rustam Nirs - b d (Na┰r- b d ) (dead in 1249 A.Y./1880 AD), wrote that the Iranian Zoroastrians were divided into two groups after the time of Ardaš r (Šahmard n 1984: 387-403). One of those was the followers of V r f, which the author called Ard y-V r f , and the others are the zarb d , who were the followers of zarb d-i M rasfand n. The text reads: It should not be secret that when the good religion was renewed and circulated due to the justice and struggles by Ardaš r-i B bak n the righteous king of kings and under the auspicious leadership of God’s selected leaders, his holiness Ard y-V r f and his holiness zarb d-i M rasfand[ n], the people left the aberrance. Thereafter, when these great fellows said farewell to the world i.e. died , the children of their followers multiplied. The Iranians were divided into two groups; some Ard y-V r f and a great crowd of zarb d , even though both these auspicious men did not proclaim anything other than the ritual traditions. Then, the m bads who recognized themselves as descendants and followers of each of these began to be separated and alienated from each other; so each group wrote a separate introduction to the Avesta. Then, after the Arabs’ victory over Iran, a group fled to India and the other remained under oppression in Iran. They forgot their religious rituals bit by bit due to the multiple oppression, and mixed up the religion with some other rituals. Those who escaped to India forgot some ancient religious rituals due to associating with the people there and adopted their ways.” (MS.301: 2b3b)
27 There are three other manuscripts of the R z-i yazd n with the title Sar-n ma-yi R z-i Yazd n with sub-numbers 221a, 221b, 221c, in Maneckji’s collection, in Cama Oriental Institute Library (£arav 1986: 59-60).



25
The time of V r f
There are various periods for the time of V r f in Zoroastrian works. According to the M n Xrad in the Zoroastrian Persian version versified by D r b Hormuzdy r Sanj na (S.P.38: 17b), V r f lived before Gušt sp. According to the Ard y-V r f N ma in Pazand, Sanskrit and the Old Gujarati, V r f was contemporary with Gušt sp. Finally, V r f was contemporary with Ardaš r-i B bak n according to the Ard y-V r f N ma of the Zoroastrian Persian version, the Ard y-V r f N ma of the Zoroastrian Persian version in verse by Zatušt Bahr m Pajd , the Qi᠀᠀a-yi sanj n, versified by Bahman Kay-Qub d Sanjana (1915: 4.vv.85-87), the Ard y-V r f N ma of the Zoroastrian Persian in verse by An š rv n Kirm n , the J m sp the Zoroastrian Persian version, versified by Dast r Burz , in 16th-17th century A.D. (S.P.46: 430b), the Kaifiyyat-in qissa-yi sul᠐ n Ma᜸m d-i aznav (Rosenberg 1909: I.30), the ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may-i ᜸al l va ᜸ar m ba q ‘ida-yi d n (1922: I.270-271), the R z-i yazd n (MS.301: 2b-3b), the Saugand-N ma (Aša 2002‘a’: 394), the Qi᠀᠀a-yi zartuštiy n-i hind st n va bay n-i taš-i bahr m-i Navs r , versified by Shapurji Maneckji Sanjana (1930: 14.vv.98100), the Farhang-i Jah ng r (MS.ADD24413: 22a), the Farhang-i Raš d (1875: I.44), the Farhang-i nandr j (Mu9ammad P dš h 1956: 1.206) and the Farhang-i Niᡄ m (D ᤱ -ul-isl m 1927: 1.211). Most of the researchers who have studied the Ard y-V r f N ma, as Tavadia (1956: 117), Widengren (1961: 13), Boyce (1968‘a’: 48) and Tafa╲╲ul (1991: 733) believe that this work is originally very old. The discussion about the antiquity of this work is further developed in chapter IX.
The Ard y-V r f N ma versions
The important position of the Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrianism and its value among the Zoroastrians is clearly seen from the numerous versions of V r f’s journey report that are recorded in various languages and in different times. It is safe to say that no other pre-Islamic Iranian work has been copied, re-written translated and spread to this extent. The initial version of the Ard y-V r f N ma was not a religious document but a pre-Zoroastrian (Indo-Iranian) text.28 The form and the main subject of this early version was changed into a Zoroastrian-religious form after the death of Zarathustra. The Zoroastrian priests were constantly involved in changing this work ideologically during the centuries. Thus, various versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma have been created. The most significant evidence
28 Specific epic traits, which are evidence for the Ard y-V r f N ma being originally a nonZoroastrian account, remain in the Zoroastrian Persian version. These traits will be considered in chapter VIII for a comparison between the Zoroastrian Persian version and the Parsig version, and also in chapter IX.



26
to prove this opinion is the existence of the Zoroastrian Persian version, where in some parts, some traces of a non-Zoroastrian epical document are still to be found. The various versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma lead us to believe that the pre-Zoroastrian (Indo-Iranian) form of the text has been transformed firstly into a Zoroastrian form in Pahlavanig (Parthian/Pahlavi), Parsig or some other language. We have no clear evidence for this, however. Then after becoming a Zoroastrian text, it has constantly been more and more “Zoroastrified”. Perhaps due to different opinions among the priests various versions of this work and its introductions give a different time for V r f’s life and journey. The introductions and the themes of the Parsig, Pazand and Zoroastrian Persian versions clearly show that these three versions have been written on the basis of three different versions. The most logical explanation is that three Parsig versions have been written on the basis of the first Zoroastrian text which was itself written down on the basis of the initial pre-Zoroastrian (Indo-Iranian) account. One of these three versions is the source of the present Parsig version. The second one is the base of the existing Pazand version. The Zoroastrian Persian version would then be an outcome of the third Parsig version. Because of its language, but only for that reason, the Parsig version is the oldest version of the Ard y-V r f N ma. In comparison with the Pazand version and, more important than that, in comparison with the Zoroastrian Persian version the form and the theme confirms that it is not an authentic version, because, it has been retouched constantly to improve the religious aims, even after the Arab invasion of Iran (Gignoux 1984: 17). It is notable that none of the versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma have been written on the basis of the Parsig version. This will be demonstrated when comparing the other accounts with the Parsig version. The Pazand version gives that V r f was sent to the Other World in the time of Gušt sp according to the date in the introduction of this version. Additionally, the main subject of the text is very different from the Parsig version. This indicates that the origin of the Parsig version which must have been another Parsig version (since all Pazand texts are transcriptions of Parsig texts) was different from the present the Parsig version. One of the oldest manuscripts of the Pazand version is dated 1410 A.D. (Haug-West 1872: x). The Sanskrit version; the Sanskrit version is based on the Pazand version (Bharucha 1920: II). The H18 manuscript is the oldest manuscript of the Sanskrit version, which contains the Ard y-V r f N ma in Pazand and Sanskrit in addition to its colophon in Sanskrit. It is dated to the year 1466 Samvat equal to 1410 A.D. (Katrak 1941: 250).



27
The Old Gujarati version; the Sanskrit version had been the basis of translating the Ard y-V r f N ma into Old Gujarati (Bharucha 1920: II). The oldest manuscript of the Old Gujarati version is in a miscellany including some works, among them the Ard y-V r f N ma in Pazand, Sanskrit and Old Gujarati. This miscellany is dated 784 A.Y./1415 A.D. (Katrak 1941: 250). The first extant Zoroastrian Persian version in verse; this version consists of 1849 verses and was versified by Zartušt Bahr m Pajd in the second half of the seventh century A.H./second half of the thirteenths century A.D.29 The origin of this version must have been the Zoroastrian Persian version in prose. However, the presence of differences between this poem and the present Zoroastrian Persian version in prose could indicate that Zartušt Bahr m’s source might have been a old manuscript of the Zoroastrian Persian version which was somewhat different from the present Zoroastrian Persian version in prose (ᤱAf f 1964: twenty-one). The first extant Zoroastrian Persian version in prose; the oldest manuscript of this version is the manuscript that was written for Shapur s in the year 896 A.Y. /1527 A.D. in Iran, and he himself carried it to India in that same year. More explanation will be given about this version in chapter V.30 The second extant Zoroastrian Persian version in verse; in the Paris manuscript, this poem has a little more than 1100 couplets (S.P.46: 365b381b). The poem was composed by K v s Far burz Yazd 31 in the year 902 A.Y./1533 A.D. in Navsari (Hodivala 1920: 303).32 The poem was composed on the basis of the Zoroastrian Persian prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma and was carried from Iran to India in the year 896 A.Y. /1527 A.D. K v s Far burz Yazd , in his poem, does not mention the versified version by Zartušt Bahr m Pajd which predates his own version.
29 According to Dastur Jamaspji Asa’s writing, Zartušt Bahr m versified the Ard y-V r f N ma in the year 900 A.Y./1530-1531 A.D. (Jamaspji Asa Haug-West 1872: xix). However Muᤱ n has proved on the basis of historical evidence that Zartušt Bahr m lived in the seventh century A.H./the thirteenth A.D. (Muᤱ n 1988: 4, 2-7). 30 Dastur Jamaspji Asa mentions another Zoroastrian Persian version, entitled the Riv yat of R ma Khamb yat [true: K m Khamb yat ] which is not very different in theme from the versified version (Jamaspji Asa Haug-West 1872: xix). This version is just a copy of the version written for Shapur s . The title Rivayat of Kama Asa Khambayeti is given to this version on the first page of the microfilm of the Zoroastrian Persian version of Shapur s . 31 K v s Far burz Yazd , a Zoroastrian merchant from Yazd in companion with another Zoroastrian named Afs d went for business from Yazd to Navsari in India. He composed a poem about his and his friend’s adventures under the title Qi᠀᠀a-yi K v s va Afs d. According to this poem, K v s assisted the Parsis very much (MS.F.45: fol.1-38). Haug and West mention a work entitled the ᜷ da᠒a-N ma, which is the story of K v s and Afš d. This book was translated from Persian into Gujarati and was published in Bombay in 1831. The Qi᠀᠀a-yi K v s va Afs d may be the same as the ᜷ da᠒a-N ma.
32 From the prologue and the epilogue it appears that a M bad named Bahr m P hlan, chief of the Navsari Anjuman, together with Maneck and Bahman urged K v s Far burz to turn the story of Ard y-V r f Nama into verse.

The second extant Zoroastrian Persian version in prose; Kay-Khusrau Isfandiy r son of ar Kayv n (dead 1081 A.H./1670 A.D.) turned into prose an abridgement of the Ard y-V r f N ma in verse of Zartušt Bahr m under the title of ^ @ ¤ »

« စ စ ¥ င * ထစ ikr-i xabard dan-i Ard y-V r f az bihišt va d zax in his book Dabist n-i Ma hib in 1645 A.D. (Kay-Khusrau Isfandiy r 1983: 1-94-100). The story begins with the phrase “Zartušt Bahr m relates...”.33 The third extant Zoroastrian Persian version in verse; this poem is composed of 424 verses and was versified by An š rv n Kirm n either in the second half of the sixteenth century or the first half of the seventeen century A.D. (Unv l 1922: II.331-342).34 An š rv n writes that, since the poem versified by Zartušt Bahr m lacks several chapters, he and two dast rs (authorities) studied the Ard y-V r f N ma textbook in zv riš (h zv riš), meaning Parsig or may be Pazand, and then he turned into poetry the chapters that were absent in the Zartušt Bahr m’s version (Ibid: 342). The part about the golden-eared dog seen by V r f is among the accounts found in the poem of An š rv n (Ibid: 332). However, the lack of this part in Zartušt Bahr m’s poem does not indicate that he missed out any part of the Ard y-V r f N ma, since he had composed his poems on the basis of the Zoroastrian Persian version in prose (Haug-West 1872: xix) and no such part of the golden-eared dog exists in this version. It is worth mentioning that the part on the golden-eared dog does not exist in the present Parsig vesion either. That is to say that the Parsig or maybe the Pazand version used by An š rv n was different from the presently available Parsig version. The first extant New Gujarati version is a rendering of the Ard y-V r f N ma in verse, which was composed by the Dastur Rustam Paš tan Hurmazdy r in 1651 A.D. (Modi 1923: 106-108). This work is based on Zartušt Bahr m’s version, Nauš rv n Bahr m’s35 version and the Ard yV raf N ma-yi Kav s (ibid: 108-109). Two manuscript of the work are being preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, both containing miniature paintings. The second extant New Gujarati version was translated into New Gujarati on the basis of Zartušt Bahr m poems by an unknown translator in
33 The existence of two translations in New Gujarati and the Dabist n-i Ma hib in Persian created on the basis of the poem of Zartušt Bahr m shows the popularity and the of Zartušt Bahr m’s version. 34 An š rv n Kirm n versified his dated works approximately between the years 988-998 A.Y./1619-1629A.D. ( m zg r 1969: 185). 35 It seems that this Nauš rv n is Anauš rv n Kirm n , because among those who versified the Ard y-V r f N ma there is no known Nauš rv n/Anauš rv n except Anauš rv n Kirm n . But his full name is Anauš rv n Marzb n Kirm n , not Nauš rv n Bahr m.

the early years of the eighteenth century36 (Jamaspji Asa Haug-West 1872: xxi). The third extant New Gujarati version is another translation from Zartušt Bahr m’s poems, first printed by the J m Jamšid Press in Bombay in the mid-19th century37 and later reprinted later (ibid). The Arabic version. This is the first time that an Arabic translation of this work is introduced. The only known manuscript of this Arabic version is mentioned in a miscellany including the Kit b f qar n t, the Kit b dal lata zar tušt, the Ard y-V r f N ma and some other works. All these works are written in Arabic but in Syriac characters. This miscellany is preserved in the Monastery of Mar Giwargis in Mosul in Iraq and is one of the manuscripts that have been brought from Alqosh38 to this monastery.39
The illustrated manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma
A number of manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma in various languages have been illustrated with paintings during the centuries. Illustrating the books with paintings was done to ensure that the subject and the theme of the book will leave a stronger impression on readers (Tavadia 1956: 120). Although there are not many illustrated manuscript left in our time, the few existing ones are important enough. It is not clearly known when manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma began to be illustrated. However, the oldest information about an illustrated manuscript of the Ard y-V r f N ma is given by Hodivala, Modi and Dhabhar. Hodivala, in his studies in Parsi History, mentions an illustrated Vir f-N ma dated to 928 A.Y./1558 A.D. in a certain collection. K mdin Sh pur Khamb iti carried this miscellany from Iran to India (Hodivala 1920: 309-310). Modi, in his introduction on the narratives of D r b Hormazy r’s Riv yat has mentioned a miscellany containing two V r f-N mas with pictures,
36 Dastur Jamaspji Asa writes that this work was translated 150 years ago. In view of the publishing time of Haug-West’s book in 1872, this work must have been translated around 1720. 37 Dastur Jamaspji Asa writes that this work was translated about 20 years ago. In view of the publishing time of Haug-West’s book in 1872 this work must have been translated approximately 1852. 38 Alqosh/Alqush is one of the famous Assyrian cities in Iraq, about 30 kilometers north of Mosul. 39 I am indebted to Mr. Zakky Shar f for information on this version. His only trace of this miscellany that might be helpful for finding it is that the manuscript was brought to Mar Giwargis monastery from Alqosh/Alqush. In the year 2006, my Kurdish fellow-researcher, Nauz d A9mad, was after many struggles able to see this manuscript just for a few minutes on his journey to Mosul. Unfortunately, I have not yet succeeded in gaining a microfilm or photography of that miscellany or at least the Ard y-V r f N ma section, in spite of two years of hard work.

which were sent to the Parsis by the Iranian Zoroastrians via Herbed-Z dah Kamdin (Modi 1922: I.12). Dhabhar also mentions a miscellany containing a V r f-N ma illustrated with pictures in The Persian Rivayats of Hormazyar Framarz (Dhabhar 1932: 618). All these three miscellanies are the same since all three contain similar works. There is just a single difference between them, Hodivala and Dhabhar mention one V r f-N ma illustrated with pictures, but Modi mentions two V r f-N mas with pictures. Hodivala writes that is the same manuscript that was used by Pope (ibid: 310, f.54) The illustrated manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma which are known at present are as follows by date: The MS. (?),40 dated 997 A.Y./1628 A.D. in the Cama Oriental Institute Library, the Zoroastrian Persian version in verse, versified by Zartušt Bahr m, containing 57 illustrated tableaus, maybe illustrated by a “Mahomedan or Hindu artist of the time” (Modi 1931: 3). The MS. 149, dated 1044 A.H./1634 A.D, in the Cama Oriental Institute Library, in the Maneckji’s Collection containing the Zar tušt-N ma, versified by Kay-K v s son of Kay-Khusrau, and the Va᠀f-i amš spand n. Some parts of the Ard y-V r f N ma are found at the end of the manuscript. It contains 48 fine tableaus altogether, which have all been washed and destroyed together with some parts of the writings (£arav 1986: 57). The MS. Indien 75, dated toward the middle of the 17th century A.D., in Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the Gujarati version of Dastur Roustem Asa [correctly: Rustam Paš tan Hurmazdy r]. This manuscript contains 80 miniatures about Paradise and Hell (Ibid). The MS. Indien 76 (Anquetil, Notices, XIV), dated toward the middle of the 17th century A.D., in Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the Gujarati version of Dastur Roustem Asa [correctly: Rustam Paš tan Hurmazdy r]. This manuscript contains 105 miniatures (Ibid).41 The MS. 132, dated 1128 A.Y./1759 A.D., in the Cama Oriental Institute Library, the Gujarati version in verse, versified by Rustam Paš tan Hurmazdy r which has two illustrations and blank spaces for further illustrations (Dhabhar 1923‘b’: 166).
40 Modi has not given the number of this manuscript. 41 Inostrantsev studied the miniatures of these two manuscripts in an article. He believes that the subject matter of some of the illustrations is in agreement with the Parsis’ ritual ceremonies (Inostrantsev 1922: 71-74). Modi, in a long critical article on Inostrantsev, holds that these manuscripts were not narrated by Roustem Asa since, there was no living Dastur called Roustem Asa at that time. He finds that to attribute the narrative to Roustem Asa was a mistake by Anquetil Du Perron which was repeated by Blochet and Inostrantsev later on. The versions belong to Rustam Paš tan Hurmazdy r. Additionally, Modi believes that the viewpoint of Inostrantsev about the Parsis’ ritual ceremonies in connection with the illustrations of both 75 and 76 manuscripts is not true, for which he presents some evidence (Modi 1923: 101-102).

The MS. 131, dated 1217 A.Y./1848 A.D., in the Cama Oriental Institute Library, the Gujarati version in verse versified by Rustam Paš tan Hurmazdy r. This manuscript contains some very good pictures (Dhabhar 1923‘b’: 165). The MS. 115 (678), sans date, in the Mull F r z Library, Bombay, the Zoroastrian Persian version in verse, versified by Zartušt Bahr m Pajd , which contains some illustrations (Dhabhar 1923‘a’: 78). The MS. (?), dated (?),42 in Kit bx na-yi anjuman-i zartuštiy n-i Tihr n (The Library of the Society of Zoroastrian in Teheran), the Zoroastrian Persian version in verse, versified by Zartušt Bahr m Pajd . The title of this manuscript is D nkard-N ma, and it contains some pictures about Paradise and Hell. Altogether 48 tableaus are printed as stereotypes (cliché) in yellow and black colors, at the end of the Ard y-V r f N ma, versified by Zartušt Bahr m, edited by Rah m ᤱAf f (Zartušt Bahr m Pajd 1964: 167-182).
Most illustrations in both manuscripts no. 75 and 76 are so similar that it seems that each one is copied from the other. But, the illustrations in manuscript 76 are artistically better. Among the miniatures both in manuscripts no. 75 and 76, six tableaus are printed in the L’Iran ancient (Molé 1965: 28, 55, 83, 109, 110, 111), and three tableaus in the Zarathushtra et la Tradition Mazdéenne (Varenne 1966: 90, 122, 138). Some of the illustrations in manuscripts no. 75 and 76 contain scenes, of which there are no indications in the Ard y-V r f N ma. For example, in one scene, two horsemen are fighting with their maces (MS.75: 7b; MS.76: 8a). In another tableau a four-horse-chariot is carrying the moon (MS.75: 47b), and in a third one, a four-horse-chariot is carrying the sun (MS.75: 49a). None of these scenes are mentioned either in the Zoroastrian Persian versions or in the Parsig versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma. These scenes are, very likely, a part of transformations that have been done in the New Gujarati version. As indicated in the title of Pope’s translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma: The Ard y-V r f N ma or the Revelation of Ard y-V r f, translated from the Persian and Gujarati Versions, with notes and illustrations (1816), this book must have been illustrated. Hodivala also declares that K mdin Sh pur Khamb iti’s manuscript was used by Pope (Hodivala 1920: 310, f.54).43
42 The scribe of this manuscript is not known, since both the first and the last folio of the book are torn away (ᤱAf f 1964: three). However, Ri╲ z da Malik wrote that D nkard-N ma is a lithographic printed book. This miscellany is preserved in two sections in Ardaš r Yig nag Library, and its microfilm by the number 1103 is present in Kit bx na-yi markaz -yi d nišg h-i Tihr n ‘Tehran University Central Library’ (Ri╲ z da Malik 1983: 2.168, 334). 43 None of the two copies of Pope’s book which were available to me are illustrated.

III. The Other World in Other Iranian works
Since the Ard y-V r f N ma will be under consideration in other sections of this thesis, only the other Iranian texts dealing with journeys to The Other World and their themes will be treated here. However, because of the importance of the Ard y-V r f N ma in comparison to the other Iranian works in presenting the picture of the Other World, and because the Ard y-V r f N ma is the main subject of the present thesis, the theme of several texts mentioned here will be compared with Ard y-V r f N ma. There are, in the Iranian culture as well as in many other cultures worldwide, literary accounts of journeying to the Other World in order to conceptualize beliefs of what will happen to the human being after death. Ard y-V r f’s travel account is the most famous remaining account of journeying to the Other World in the Iranian cultural realm. This work is the subject of the present study. However, in addition to the Ard y-V r f N ma, there are also other works on the concept of the Other World in Iranian literature. For this study, it is necessary to penetrate also other written accounts about the Other World in some detail, something which will reveal more about the Iranian world view in general and Iranian concepts of the Other World in particular. As much as possible, the texts will be allowed to speak for themselves. Therefore, this chapter will comprise a substantial part of the whole work.
Belief in the existence of the Other World is strong in Iranian culture since very ancient times.44 According to such a belief, to journey to the Other World is known as a possible and acceptable matter. The Iranian magi’s journey to the Other World has been well known and accepted as a fact also among other nations in ancient times. Due to this belief, when Lucian, the Greek writer from Samosata (c.120- c.190), was to write about the Other World, he inquired from the magi to profit from their knowledge of journeying to the Other World:
44 The presentation of Iranian belief in the other world makes it essential to refer especially to descriptions and journeys to the Other World in an Iranian Cultural framework. For this reason, I avoid mentioning and making comparisons with texts of other cultures and languages related to the other world, as Fís Adamnáín in Irland (written about 1100), Draumkvedet in Norway (probably written in 1537) and Divina Commedia by Dante Alighieri in Italy (written 1307-1321).



34
So one time, while I lay awake over these problems, I resolved to go to Babylon and address myself to one of the Magi, the disciples and successors of Zoroaster, as I had heard that with certain charms and ceremonials they could open the gates of Hades (Hell), taking down in safety anyone they would and guiding him back again (Lucian 1925: Menippus 6).
Therefore, Ard y-V r f, too, is sent to the Other World. The old origin of the belief that the magi can journey to the Other World are to be found in different stories about the existence of such a world repeated numerous times in the Iranian literature. This kind of narration is shaped either in the form of journey reports from or descriptions of the Other World. Accounts of this kind are found in the Avesta and Parsig (=Middle Persian)45 texts. Thus, there is no comprehensive account of the Zoroastrian religion without these narrations (Zaehner 1961: 302). The purpose of the journeys to the Other World and the description that follows in these narrations can sometimes be to awaken other believers (Ard y-V r f journey) and sometimes to affect a special person (Wišt sp/Gušt sp’s journey).46 Narrations with the purpose of depicting the Other World can be classified in five groups. Three groups are written in Iranian languages (Avestan, Parsig and Zoroastrian Persian), the fourth group, which includes two texts one incomplete and one complete is in Greek, and the fifth group is engraved as a pictorial report on stone, thus is not a written text.
I Avestan texts:
I.I H d ̈xt Nask
I.II Sipand Nask as quoted in Š yest Na-Š yest
I.III Wišt sp Yašt
I.IV Widawd d
45 Parsig (P rs g) will be used to designate the variety of Middle Iranian that was the prestigious and written language of the Sasanid period. The indigenous name of this language is found in Riv yat m t Ašawahišt n, which itself is in Parsig: h ra w z- abest g pad w z p rs g frasang xw n nd “H thra is an Avestan word which is read frasang in Parsig” (REA 1980: XIII.5; see also Lazard 1995‘b’: 57). Against Parsig stands Pahlav n g (> Pahlav n and further > Pahlav ) as the language of the Parthians. The indigenous name of this language is found in the Parthian text M 2 (= text h in Boyce 1975: 40): ka fr stagr šn andar holw n šahrist n b d, xwand m r *amm hamm z g, k pahlaw n g dib r ud izw n d n st... “When the Prophet of Light was in the town of Holv n, he called for M r Amm ̈, the teacher, who knew reading and writing in Pahlav n g” (see also Lazard 1995‘b’: 52). Despite the historical background to the use of the designation Pahlavi for Middle Persian, I find it misleading and recommend that Parsig be used in its place. 46 Wišt sp, an Avestan and Parsig form, is an Iranian king contemporary to Zarathustra. This name is Gušt sp in New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian. In this study, the form Wišt sp has been used, as a general rule, except in the texts where the form Gušt sp has been used, where this work also uses Gušt sp. This name is Wišt sp in Pahlavi Riv yat, D nkard and Wiz rgard D n g texts, but in Zar tušt-N ma, យaddar Bundahiš, Min -xirad [versified], Qi᠀᠀a-yi dast r..., ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may... and Khul ᠀a-yi D n it is Gušt sp.

V.Pictorial report: V.I Wirkak’s tomb relief
Although the language division of the first three groups is chronologically based (Avestan, Parsig and Zoroastrian Persian), it is not certain that they have been written down in that historical chronological order, i.e. that the Parsig texts have been written after the Avestan texts and the Zoroastrian Persian texts after the Parsig texts. For example, it has been argued that one of the Parsig texts, Wiz rgard D n g, may have been written as late as in the eighteenth or even the nineteenth century (Cereti 1995‘a’: 142) whereas Zar tušt-N ma, a Zoroastrian Persian text, was written in tenth century (Rempis 1963: 340-341).



36
Descriptions of the Other World in the texts belonging to the first three groups can be classified into two main approaches as follows: (A) The Other World in abstract description narration (B) The Other World in travellers’ reports In the (A) texts, the main subject of each one is the description and explanation of the Other World, including the situation of the dead souls. There is a main difference between journeys and description, i.e. the descriptions give a concise account of the Other World whereas the journey reports give a livelier picture of how the narrator conceptualizes that world. Although, it is impossible to classify the texts of the first three groups, which comprise altogether six travel reports, according to the time when they have been written, they can be classified according to their chronological appearance in the legendary history of these journeys. These six journeys are as follows: Jamš d’s journey Zarathustra’s journey Wišt sp’s journey Kerd r’s journey Journey of Zoroaster/Er the Pamphylian Wirkak’s journey
The travel reports in the three first of the above-mentioned groups describe four journeys. Among these, only one of them, the report of Jamš d’s journey, is pre-Zoroastrian, and the other three journeys are all related to the Zoroastrian period. Perhaps due to the importance of these texts in the Zoroastrian religion, the travel reports are found in several accounts, and in one of the journeys (that of Wišt sp) as many as four (in nine different works) occur. The fifth journey has been recorded in two reports and both of them are in Greek. But the names of the travellers are different in these two reports. The traveller’s name is “Zoroaster the Pamphylian” in the first report but “Er the Pamphylian” in the second. The last journey, or the sixth, like the first journey has only been recorded in one report. But this one is completely different from the others, because it has been inscribed pictorially on stone in a relief. These journeys are reported to have been done in two ways and can thus be classified in two groups: 1. Profiting from a medium for the journey 2. Not profiting from a medium for the journey Here a medium refers to a means that helps the main personality of the text to change into a mentally and/or physically different state which means



37
that he is able to see the Other World. Thus, Zarathustra and Wišt sp47 profit from a medium to make their journeys, but, Jamš d, Kerd r and Zoroaster/Er the Pamphylian do not profit from any medium.
The Other World
A: Abstract descriptive narrations
Abstract descriptive narrations (i.e. group A), divided into the three languages Avestan, Parsig and Zoroastrian Persian, include the following texts:
Avestan: H d xt Nask (HN 1872: II-III), Wišt sp Yašt (Wyt 1852-54: VIII.53-64),48 Wid wd d (Wd 1907: XIX: 27-32)
Parsig: D dest n M n Xrad (MX 1985: I.110-194), D dest n D n g (Dd 1998: XX.1-8; XXIII.5-6; XXX.2, 13), Bundahišn (IraBd 1956: XXX: 1-34), Wiz dag h Z dspram (WZad 1993: XXX.52-61; XXXI.2-5), Pahlavi Riv yat (PRDd 1990: XXIII.1-36), Aogm da (Aog 1982: 8-20)
Zoroastrian Persian: យaddar Bundahiš (យDB 1909: XCIX.1-23).
The presentation of the Other World in these texts gives an abstract picture, where only the precepts of religion are narrated objectively. On the basis of religion, it is the person’s good deeds that are rewarded in the Other World and his evil deeds that deserve a severe punishment. There is no vivid description of how these rewards and punishments are meant to take place. In fact these are just abstract pictures of the Other World with the purpose of reminding the believers of the religious precepts, so that they will avoid evil deeds and just do good deeds in this world. Some similarities between the contents of the group A texts and the reports of journeys to the Other World in the texts of group B indicate that these two groups of texts have similar origins and that they have later adopted different approaches through the passing of time. There are two descriptions in these groups that, besides Ard y-V r f N ma, make Zoroastrian beliefs known in the shape of mythical pictures of the conception of the Other World and varieties of it through as long a time as about three thousand years. These abstract descriptions are brief, or more or less detailed, but they are, on the whole, similar to each other. Thus, in order to avoid repetition, only one of the texts of group A, H d xt Nask, will be described here. It is probably the oldest text of this group.
47 In some of the accounts, however (យaddar Bundahiš and in Khul ᠀a-yi D n), there is no mention of any medium. 48 Wišt sp Yašt has also been mentioned in Zand-i Kh rtak Avist k (ZKA 1927: 212-213).



38
H d xt Nask
In the old section of the Avesta, the G s, there are no pictures given of the Other World. But in the three Nasks (Books) of the Younger Avesta there are three descriptions of the Other World: H d xt Nask, Wišt sp Yašt and Wid wd d.
H d xt Nask is the twentieth Nask of the Sasanian Avesta (Geldner 18961904: 17-20). What is remaining of this Nask is three chapters, where the second and third chapters are correlated and describe the Other World. Among the three Avestan texts that describe the Other World, H d xt Nask is the most complete and most detailed.
A description of what happens to the pious soul in the Other World is narrated in the second chapter of H d xt Nask. In this text, Ohrmazd informs Zarathustra that the pious soul sits joyfully above its dead body and sings cheerful chants for the first three nights. Then, at the end of the third night, the soul scents the most sweet-smelling fragrance in the world. Afterwards his da n (conscience/religion) becomes apparent to him as a beautiful girl and tells him: “I am you, yourself, I am the reflection of your good thoughts, good words and good deeds”. So the pious soul is led by his da n in four steps to the “Boundless Place”. There the other pious souls, who have died before, ask him how he died and came to that place. But Ohrmazd orders them not to ask him any questions since he has come on a dangerous path. Then Ohrmazd gives the order that he should be given the most delicious food, which is called ‘Oil of the Spring’. This is the dead person’s meal of good thoughts, good words and good deeds. The third chapter explains the destiny of the sinful soul going to the Other World.49 Here, the sinful soul, reciting a hymn of sadness and pains, sits crying above the dead body. At the end of the third night the soul feels that it is passing through snow and fetid water. Then he smells the worst odor in the world. Afterwards, his da n becomes apparent to him as an ugly old being (gann g m n g, Avestan a r .mainyav-, i.e. the Evil Spirit) and says to him: “I am the result of your evil thoughts, deeds and words”. Then the sinful soul is led by his da n in four steps to deep darkness, and there the previously dead sinful souls ask him how he died and came to this place. But gann g m n g frightens them into not asking him such questions, because he has come down a very dangerous path. Then she orders poison and stench to be brought forth, because this is the meal of malevolent, misbehaving and abusive persons after death50 (HN 1872: II-III).
49 Because of the similarity between the second chapter and the third one, many of the subject matters and paragraphs of the third chapter have by mistake been eliminated the copyist. Although it is similar to the second chapter the main subject of the third chapter is what happens to the sinful soul in Other World. 50 Both pious and sinful souls are men in both chapters. But in connection with the food in the Other World, in second chapter Oil of the Spring is to be given to “youth of good thoughts”



39
General characteristics of abstract descriptive narrations
General characteristics common for texts of group A are: The bewilderment of both the virtuous soul and the sinful soul on the first three days after death. All souls, virtuous and sinful, see their da n 51 as a pretty or ugly woman and they conceptualize those bodies as the sum of their deeds in the present world. Pious souls will arrive in a place of boundless light and will be fed heavenly meals, but sinful souls will go to the dark Hell and will be fed hellish meals. This will continue until the Day of Resurrection. The names of some of the Amš spand n (Immortals), such as ‘Sr ̈š’, ‘Wahman’, ‘W y weh’,52 ‘Mihr’ and ‘Rašn’, are mentioned in these texts, which are also the names of some of the D w n (demons) like ‘Wizarš-daw’, ‘Astwih d-daw’, ‘Frazišt-daw’ and ‘Niz št-daw’ (MX 1985: I.115-118). There are also accounts of their functions. Among these texts, three have a unique feature that cannot be seen in other texts. They are Wid wd d, Bundahišn and Wiz dag h Z dspram. According to Wid wd d, in the Other World the spirit is confronted by two dogs which are guardians of the nwad puhl (Chinvad Bridge) (Wd 1907: XIII.9). In Bundahišn mention is also made of a dog standing on the Chinvad Bridge; but there it is only one dog (IraBd 1956: XXX.3).53 According to Bundahišn, the pious soul sees a fat cow and a cultivated fertile garden on the road to the Other World and gets their help to pass the Chinvad Bridge. But a thin skinny cow and an abandoned dried garden appear to the sinful soul (IraBd 1956: XXX.12-19). In Wiz dag h Z dspram, there are white cows and bulls that help the virtuous soul to reach heaven (WZad 1993: XXX.52).
(HN 1872: II.38) and to “women of good thoughts” (HN 1872: II.39). And in the third chapter poison and stench are mentioned as food for “malevolent youth” (HN 1872: III.38) and “malevolent women” (HN 1872: III.39). 51 da n , a Avestan word (Parsig: d n), means conscience. But in New Persian, the meaning of the word d n has changed from conscience to religion. 52 W y (Zoroastrian Persian: v y), is the goddess of wind in Iranian mythology in two different characters: ‘W y weh’ (a deity) and ‘W y wattar’ (a demon). 53 This dog is known as the Sag-i zarr n-g š (the dog with the golden ears) in Zoroastrian literature. In the Ard y-V r f N ma in the versified version by Dast r Nauš rv n Marzb n Kirm n , when Ard y-V r f reaches the Chinvad Bridge he is very afraid of seeing this dog. This dog in Dast r Na š rv n’s narration has not only golden ears and a collar chain but is also the guardian of the Chinvad Bridge gate (MS.S.P.46: 297a). Anyway, the presence of two dogs seems to be more original, because two guardian dogs also help ‘Yima’, the goddess of the World of the Dead in Veda (Rig Veda 1994: X.10-14).



40
In Wiz dag h Z dspram, four occupations apply in the Other World.54 There are twelve m n g (heavenly spirits), who arrange a heavenly life for pious souls (WZad 1993: XXX.52-61).
In short, the abstract descriptive texts of the Other World are of a general character and they do not in any way depict that world. In fact, these abstract texts only present the way to reach the Other World.
B: Travellers’ reports
The travellers’ reports (group B), divided according to the three languages Avestan, Parsig and Zoroastrian Persian, include the following texts:
Avestan: Sipand Nask as quoted in Š yest Na-Š yest
Parsig: Zand Wahman Yasn, Pahlavi Riv yat,55 Kerd r’s inscription [Sar Mašhad inscription], Kerd r’s inscription [Naqš-i Rustam inscription], D nkard, Wiz rgard D n g
Zoroastrian Persian: Zar tušt-N ma, យaddar Bundahiš,56 យaddar Na᠒r, [P dš h -yi Jamš d], Min -xirad [versified], Qi᠀᠀a-yi dast r...,57 ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may...,58 Khul ᠀a-yi D n and Khul ᠀a-yi D n [versified], Ard y-V r f N ma 59
To acquire information of conditions in the Other World, in addition to abstract descriptions, travellers’ reports have been created over and over again in order to present as lively pictures of the Other World as possible. In order to leave the most effective and trustworthy impression on readers of these reports, they are always ascribed to men of good thoughts, good words and good deeds, i.e. the righteous.
54 These four occupations are in accordance with the four Iran social classes in Sassanid period, that is teaching of theology ( sravan h), keeping of the army (art št r h), farming (v stary š h) and trade (p šag). 55 Pahlavi Riv yat gives a description of the world in its 23rd chapter, and in its 47th chapter it presents an account of the journey of Wišt sp. 56 យaddar Bundahiš is proceeded to the Wišt sp journey account in 4th chapter, and in 99th chapter describes the universe subjectively. 57 The complete title of this narration is: Qi᠀᠀a-yi dast r b yak az d nišmand musalm n n b bat-i yazd n va ahr man (The Tale of Dast r with one of the Muslim Scholars about Yazd n (God) and Ahr man (Devil)). 58 The complete title of this narration is: ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may-i ᜸al l va ᜸ar m ba q ‘ida-yi d n (“Anecdote about Drinking Religiously Permissible Wine or Prohibited Wine, according to religion”). 59 Naturally, the Ard y-V r f N ma is also one of the Iranian works that belong to group B according to the division made in this work. However, because the Ard y-V r f N ma will be the subject of a separate chapter in the present treatise, it will not be dealt with in this chapter.



41
There is more than one account of these journeys. In order to avoid unnecessary repetition in this chapter, a presentation of all texts about the same journey has been avoided. Only one account of the journey, the one which is relatively more complete than the others, has been chosen as a sample. The criterion for this choice is neither language style nor shortness or length of the account, but the intention was to choose the most comprehensive and complete description of the journey. However, for three journeys it was necessary to refer to more than one account in order to include all details. The first one is the journey of Jamš d, the second one is the journey of Zarathustra, where two accounts have been used for each journey. The third journey is that of Wišt sp, where three accounts have been analysed.
Jamš d’s journey
According to the narrations, Jamš d journeyed to the Other World three times. Two of his three journeys, included in the narration of Jamš d, are related to each other, although they are described as having taken place far apart. But the goal, form and motif of the third journey are different and have been cited in another narration of Jamš d’s life.
[The Reign of Jamš d60]
The original text of this myth in an unknown language has not remained. The only transcript is the version that has been versified by Dast r Nauš ravan Kirm n between the years 1620-1630 (Rosenberg 1909: 12). The narration begins when Jamš d becomes king and governs all “Birds, demons and fairies”. Then the Amš spand61 Sur š, by order from Ohrmazd, comes down and inspires him to wear Sidra62 and Kust ,63 so that the D v (demon) and Šayt n (Evil) will be frightened. Jamš d and his people of all classes do as Ohrmazd has ordered. Afterwards the demons will be destroyed and Jamš d will govern all justly and fairly. After these events, the Amš spand Bahman takes him and leads him to heaven, to the presence of Ohrmazd. Ohrmazd asks Jamš d to accept the
60 This narrative has no title in the manuscripts MS.S.P.38 and MS.S.P.46 at Bibliohèque Nationale in Paris. A copy of it, edited by Spiegel, has a very long title: “Ba padš h -nišastani Jamš d va s xtan-i 9ikmat-h -yi har b b va qufl-kardan-i bar d zax va šk r-kardan-i rasm-i sidrah va kust va naur z va far fta-šudan az guft r-i d v n, va padš h -yi haft-┰ad s l b d” (Jamš d becoming king and his establishing of every kind of wisdom and padlocking Hell’s gate and making apparent the tradition of Sidra, Kust and Naur z and being deceived by the words of demons, and his reign was seven hundred years)” (Spiegel 1860: 327). This narrative has been edited by Aša but his copy has no title either (Aša 1995: 293-303). 61 Amš spand (Parsig: Amahraspand, Amešospand) means Holy Immortal. 62 Parsig: šab g, an under-shirt for Mazdean’s ritual. 63 Or kušt g, Parsig: kust g, a sacred girdle.



42
D n-i Bih 64 (Supreme Religion) so that the demons will be destroyed. But Jamš d wishes to be king of the entire world, and Ohrmazd accepts this. On the day when Jamš d comes back from heaven to the Alburz mountains, people see two suns in the sky. One sun is shining in the sky, but the other sun is coming down to the ground, and this second sun is Jamš d. After his descent, Jamš d begins making garments, swords, helmets, daggers, different kinds of armour and maces. Then he classifies people into four groups, and from the demons he learns to construct houses, and afterwards he learns to build ships, and gets knowledge of jewellery, perfumery and pharmacy. So Ohrmazd inspires him to ascend to the Other World again. Jamš d goes to the Chinvad Bridge at R z-i Xurd d, m h-i Farvard n (Xurd d day of Farvard n Month),65 and there he padlocks the gates of Hell so firmly that afterwards no one will die during his reign.66 In spite of all that, Jamš d feels proud and selfish, so that finally, he claims to be the creator of the world. So he loses his Farra-yi zad 67 (Divine Splendour), and because of this, ᡁa᜸᜸ k-m r attacks Iran and overcomes him. Thus Jamš d has to leave power, and he runs away to the mountains not to be killed. He then wanders around there the rest of his life (MS.S.P.38: 116-120).68
Jam’s journey to Hell
According to D nkard, Jam69 takes a long journey to the Other World at the beginning of his reign. Before Jam’s reign, because the sn xrad (essential wisdom)70 had been stolen by the demons, the kings became weaker and weaker, and as a result z-d w (demon of greed) overcame the people, who lived like wild beasts. D d r (God) wishes Jam to become king. At first he reconquers the kingdom from the demons, then D d r’s Farra assists him to go to Hell. Jam spent thirteen winters (thirteen years) there, in the presence of the demons. There he learned how to defend his people against demons and how to defeat the demons. He learned all about their secrets, and then he came back to the world and succeeded in liberating his people. So he spread essential wisdom
64 D n-i bih, D n-i vih, D n-i bih are known as mazdayasn or Zoroastrianism 65 Xurd d day of Farvard n month is the sixth day of Farvardin, i.e. the first month of the Iranian calendar. The sixth day of Farvardin was called, “Naur z-i buzurg” (= the great new year’s day) in Iranian tradition. This is equal to 25 or 26 of March. 66 The place of the Ahr man (Evil principal) is hell and one of his main act is death. When Jamš d padlocks the gates of hell, his aim is not to prevent the dead going to hell. He intends to imprison Ahr man in his place, so he blocks the way to one of the greatest evil acts and to dying as well. 67 Farrah (Av.: xwarénah; Parsig: xwarrah); Farrah-yi zad is Divine Splendour or Divine Glory. 68 See also MS.S.P.46: 131-133; Spiegel 1860: 327-332. 69 In Avesta and Sanskrit texts his name is Yima, in Parsig texts, i.e. D nkard, he is called Jam, and in Zoroastrian and New Persian texts Jamš d. 70 sn xrad (essential wisdom) is equal to g š n xrad (acquired wisdom).

among people, and as a result of this all of Ohrmazd’s creation became immortal (DkM 1911: I.295 (20)-297 (5))
Special features of Jamš d’s journey
The oldest myth about journeying to the Other World in Iran is Jamš d’s journey. One of the similarities between this myth and the Ard y-V r f N ma is that it is Sur š who comes to Jamš d initially. Sur š is also the first Amahraspand (Immortal) who sees Ard y-V r f in the Other World. After Sur š it is Wahman Amahraspand who leads Jamš d to heaven, into Ohrmazd’s presence. It is only Wahman who is capable of doing this (IraBd 1956: XXVI.12). According to the Ard y-W r z N mag it is Wahman who leads Ard y-V r f into Ohrmazd’s presence (AWN 1984: XI.1-3). However, according to the Parsig version of the Ard y-W r z N mag, dur yazd (the God of fire) prepares the Chinvad Bridge for souls to pass (AWN 1984: V.12). But in Jamš d’s journey, like in the Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrian Persian, dur yazd plays no role. Paradise and Hell are the two important places in the Other World according to Jamš d’s journey and the Ard y-V r f N ma. However, there is a big difference between the travellers of these two journeys. Ard y-V r f is frightened of seeing Hell and asks his two fellow travellers not to take him there (AWN 1984: LIII). Contrary to him, Jamš d himself goes to Hell and padlocks its gate. Compared to the other travellers to the Other World, Jamš d is the only one who journeys there twice, and this is apart from his journey to Hell to release the sn xrad (essential wisdom). The narration of Jamš d’s journey is much more lively and strong in imagination, both in its contents and form, than the other journeys to the Other World that will be described below.
Zarathustra’s journey
Zarathustra’s journey is mentioned in Sipand Nask as quoted in Š yest N Š yest and Zand Wahman Yasn in Parsig and in យaddar Bundahiš, យaddar Na᠒r, Zar tušt-N ma and Khul ᠀a-yi D n [versified] in Zoroastrian Persian.
Sipand Nask as quoted in Š yest N -Š yest
Sipand Nask is the thirteenth Nask of the Sasanian Avesta. It is, however, lost but some chapters and sections are cited in other works like Š yest N Š yest and are therefore still available. The narration in Sipand Nask is also found in a slightly different version in យaddar Na᠒r in Zoroastrian Persian (យDN 1909: IV.3-11).

While journeying to the Other World, Zarathustra sees a man in a state in which all of his body except one of his legs is in Hell. Zarathustra asks about his situation. He gets the reply that this man, who is called Dav n s, has been the king of thirty–three countries. He has never done a good deed in his life, except once, when he saw some fodder far from a fastened sheep. He pushed the fodder nearer so that the sheep could eat it. Now, that one leg remains outside Hell as a reward for just that single good deed (ŠnŠ 1969: XII.29).71
Zand Wahman Yasn
Zarathustra asks Ohrmazd to make him immortal. That is impossible, replies Ohrmazd. It is difficult for Zarathustra to understand why. Since Ohrmazd is aware of his thoughts, he gives him the wisdom of all knowledge in the form of water and orders him to drink it.72 Zarathustra drinks the water and then the wisdom of all knowledge captures all his existence. Seven days pass in this manner and Zarathustra finds himself in the wisdom of Ohrmazd. After seven days Ohrmazd takes back the wisdom of all knowledge. Zarathustra thinks it has been a dream of delight. Ohrmazd asks him what his dream was about. He has seen that the soul of a rich man who was ignominious in the world is now in Hell. Zarathustra confesses that he is filled with hate for him. In addition to this, he has seen a poor mendicant whose soul is in Paradise and with whom he is pleased (ZWY 1995: III.6).73
Differences and similarities in Zarathustra’s journey descriptions
Zarathustra’s journey in Zand Wahman Yasn is very similar to Ard yV r f’s: Zarathustra drinks the ‘wisdom of all knowledge’, in the form of water, like Ard y-V r f does. Zarathustra like Ard y-V r f visits both Paradise and Hell Both Ard y-V r f and Zarathustra come back to the world after seven days. But there are also major differences between Zand Wahman Yasn and the Ard y-V r f N ma. The former describes Paradise and Hell quite briefly, but instead it describes ‘the seven-branched tree’ in great detail (Aša
71 This paragraph of Sipand Nask has also been mentioned in the Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrian Persian (XLII) and in the Parsig version (XXXII). But, they differ from each other, since in these works it is Ard y-V r f, who sees Dav n s [Parsig: dw’nws] in Hell. 72 Holy water as a medium is not limited to this work. Chadwick has mentioned several myths; according to which, after drinking some water from the holy spring, one gains access to the spirit of knowledge (Chadwick 1932: I.649-650). 73 Also in Pahlavi Riv yat it is mentioned that Ohrmazd gives Zarathustra the “wisdom of all knowledge” (PRDd 1990: XXXVI.8-11).

2002‘a’: 370) something that is not mentioned in the Ard y-V r f N ma. On the other hand, the latter work describes Paradise and Hell in greater detail. The medium in Zarathustra’s journey is different from that in the aforementioned texts. The medium is in the form of water in Zand Wahman Yasn. In Zar tušt-N ma the medium is ‘something like honey’, whereas in Khul ᠀a-yi D n [versified] the medium is ‘a water-like milk’. There is a part in this version of Khul ᠀a-yi D n that has not been mentioned in any other text about the same journey: Zarathustra observes King Jamš d’s soul and Garš sp’s soul in hell. Seeing Jamš d, Zarathustra intercedes for him in Ohrmazd’s presence and Ohrmazd accepts the intercession. Afterwards, Jamš d recommends Zarathustra to keep himself from being deceived by Ahr man (P hlan 1924: vv.156-174).
Wišt sp’s journey
There are four different versions of Wišt sp’s journey to the Other World. In the first version, found in the Pahlavi Riv yat and D nkard (both in Parsig), the Amš spand n (Immortals) are in contact with Wišt sp. In the second version, that of the Wiz rgard D n g in Parsig and in Zar tušt-N ma, Qi᠀᠀a-yi dast r..., Min -xirad [versified] by D r b Hurmazdy r Sanj na74 and Khul ᠀a-yi D n in Zoroastrian Persian, it is Zarathustra who requests Wišt sp’s journey to Paradise from Ohrmazd, and the request is granted. In the third version, found in យaddar Bundahiš, Ohrmazd grants four things to Gušt sp for his accepting the Religion. These are things that no kings have ever possessed, i.e. an immortal son, Paš tan, who will reveal Zoroastrianism on the last days of the world; a son, Isfandiy r, who is more courageous than anyone else in the whole world; a minister, J m sp, who is wiser than anyone else in the whole world, and, finally, the gift that Gušt sp’s spirit will be brought on a journey to Paradise to see his own eternal place (យDB 1909: IV.9-13). In the fourth version, which is found in the ᜷ik yat dar b bi xwardan-i may... [versified], Gušt sp drinks wine and his spirit ascends to the Other World and makes a visit there (Unv l 1922: I.270-271). Because there are these different versions of Wišt sp’s journeys, an example of each one will be presented below.
Pahlavi Riv yat
Zarathustra frequently invites Wišt sp to accept the good religion, but he does not accept it. The first time Ohrmazd sent Wahman, Ardwahišt and
74 There are two versified versions of Min -xirad available. The first one has been composed by Marzb n R var in 980 A.Y./1611 A.D. (MS.S.P.1191) and the other one by D r b Hurmazdy r Sanj na in 1046 A.Y./1677 A.D. (MS.S.P. 38).

dur Burzanmihr75 to Wišt sp’s house to promise him that if he accepts religion, he will get an immortal son, Paš tan, who will never grow old. But Wišt sp does not have faith (PRDd 1990: XLVII.12-14). The very last time, Ohrmazd tells Nery ̈sang to go to Ardwahišt Amahraspand and tell him to make a mixture of mang (henbane) and wine and give it to Wišt sp. Afterwards, he drinks the wine and becomes unconscious at once. Then his soul is taken to Heaven, and there he sees the place reserved for him in Paradise after he has accepted the true religion. When Wišt sp comes to his senses, he cries to his wife Hut ̈s: “Where is Zarathustra? I am ready to believe in his religion”. Zarthustra hears Wišt sp’s cry, comes to him and at this moment Wišt sp accepts his religion (PRDd 1990: XLVII: 15-19).
Zar tušt-N ma
Wiz rgard D n g, Zar tušt-N ma, Min -xirad [versified], Qi᠀᠀a-yi dast r..., ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may..., and Khul ᠀a-yi D n are more or less similar as regards Wišt sp’s journey. Since, there is doubt whether Wiz rgard D n g in Parsig is indeed a very old text, the second version of Wišt sp’s journey has been taken from Zar tušt-N ma instead. The reason for this is that the narration is more complete here than in other texts. The narration is retold here: Gušt sp/Wišt sp76 asks Zarathustra to fulfil four of his wishes in order for him to believe in Zoroastrianism. His four wishes are: to be aware of his place in the Other World, to have a body which becomes invulnerable to any kind of weapons, because he feels that, if he professes this religion, he will get entangled in many wars, to be informed of all good and evil that has taken place and will take place in the world, immortality until the day of resurrection.
Zarathustra tells him that he will ask Ohrmazd to fulfill these four wishes but also that he must request one of them for himself and the other three for others. The next day, when Zarathustra comes to the king, the gatekeeper tells him, that there are four mounted men all dressed in green at the door. Gušt sp asks Zarathustra about these four men. The four men present themselves as Amš spand n before Zarathustra has any time to answer. Then they order king Gušt sp to accept the religion.
75 These names are in Zoroastrian Persian: Wahman (Bahman), Ardwahišt (Urd bihišt) and dur Burzanmihr ( zar Burz nmihr)
76 The name of Wišt sp has mentioned as Gušt sp in Zar tušt-N ma, យaddar Bundahiš, Min xirad [versified], Qi᠀᠀a-yi dast r..., ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may..., Khul ᠀a-yi D n and Khul ᠀a-yi D n [versified].



47
Hearing the order, the king becomes unconscious. When he comes to his senses again, he expresses his wish to accept Ohrmazd’s command. Hearing this the four Amš spand n suddenly disappear. Then Zarathustra orders a Sufra-yi Dar n (table for consecrated bread) to be brought in and wine, flowers, milk and pomegranates to be arranged on the table. Gušt sp drinks some of the sanctified wine and falls asleep for three days. During this time his soul ascends to Heaven, and there it perceives his place in the world to come, at the side of other chaste and virtuous men. It also experiences many other wonderful things.77 Paš tan drinks the sanctified milk and becomes safe from old age and death. J m sp takes the sanctified flowers and gains all knowledge. Isfandiy r eats the grains of the sanctified pomegranates and becomes invulnerable. Afterwards, Gušt sp wakes up and prays. Then he calls for Zarathustra and explains in detail to him what he has seen in the Other World (Zartušt Bahr m 1959: vv.1102-1180).78
8ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may-i 9al l va 9ar m ba q ‘ida-yi d n
This versified text has been mentioned in Bahman Punj yih’s Riv yat, and is about moderation in wine-drinking with reference to Ohrmazd’s order to Zarathustra to drink moderately. The report of Gušt sp’s journey “for the enlightenment of all people in the world” is found in the middle part of the text. [Zarathustra]79 sanctifies the dar n (consecrated bread) and wine, gives it to King Gušt sp, the “brazen bodied” (Isfandiy r), Paš tan and J m sp. Gušt sp passes out immediately and sees the Other World happily and cheerfully. His body stays asleep in the present world for a week, but his soul visits Ohrmazd. After one week, when he returns back to the world, he accepts and disseminates Zoroastrianism (Unv l 1922: I.270-271).80
77 According to Khul ᠀a-yi D n [versified] when Gušt sp saw his name on the leaf of ‘Sarv-i K šmar’, he was surprised at Zarathustra’s miracle then he believed in religion. But there are no words of his journey in the text (Khul ᠀a-yi D n [versified] 1924: 53). 78 For a long time it was believed that Zar tušt-N ma was a poem by Zartušt Bhar m Pajd . But the true poet of this work was Kay-K v s son of Kay-khusrau, and Zartušt Bahr m was just the copyist of the work (Rempis 1963: 337-342). However, due to the fact that the edition of Zar tušt-N ma has the name Zartušt Bahr m as the author of the work, I am using this attribution here.
The Story about Drinking Religiously Permissible or Prohibited Wine in accordance with the Rules of the Religion
79 It is not clear from the text who gives ‘consecrated bread’ and wine to Gušt sp. However, it seems as though there is no one but Zarathustra who could do it. 80 In another story entitled Kaifiyyat-i qi᠀᠀a-yi sul᠐ n Ma᜸m d-i aznav versified by An š rv n Kirm n the four wishes that Zarathustra fulfills are also highlighted in five poems (Rosenberg 1909: I.25, vv.43-47). The sending of Gušt sp to paradise can be found in one of these five poems (v.43).



48
Differences and similarities, in Wišt sp/Gušt sp’s travel descriptions
There are only two promises mentioned in Pahlavi Riv yat of the four given to Wišt sp, the promise of visiting Paradise and Paš tan being born. But there is no mention of either Isfandiy r becoming invulnerable or J m sp, the minister of Wišt sp, profiting of knowledge. A mixture of may and mang (wine and henbane) is the medium of Wišt sp’s journey to paradise in Pahlavi Riv yat, but a mixture of h m81 and mang is the medium in D nkard. According to Pahlavi Riv yat, the soul of Wišt sp goes to Paradise to see his eternal place. But there is nothing about Wišt sp having gone unconciously to heaven in D nkard. Because of this, it seems that D nkard is incorrect.82 The sanctified wine is the medium of Wišt sp’s journey in Wiz rgard D n g, Zar tušt-N ma and Min -xirad [versified]. The means of journeying in ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may... is ‘consecrated bread’ and ‘consecrated win’. There is no medium in យaddar Bundahiš and Khul ᠀a-yi D n, where Ohrmazd himself takes Wišt sp’s soul to Paradise. Wišt sp’s wish for Paš tan has different forms in the texts. Wišt sp is informed of the glad tiding of Paš tan being born in Pahlavi Riv yat, D nkard, យaddar Bundahiš and Khul ᠀a-yi D n. Paš tan is given the ‘sanctified milk’ in Wiz rgard D n g and Zar tušt-N ma and due to this he becomes safe from old age and death. In Min -xirad [versified] Paš tan becomes a virtuous and brave young man instead of becoming safe from old age and death.83 The wish of all knowledge for J m sp is also different in different texts. There is no mention of J m sp in D nkard and Pahlavi Riv yat, but he receives the flower and profits by all knowledge in Wiz rgard D n g and Zar tušt-N ma. In យaddar Bundahiš and Khul ᠀a-yi D n, we are told about J m sp gaining all knowledge, but there is no mention of how this occurs. J m sp smells the b y (comprehension) in order to gain all knowledge. In the ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may... there is no word of any of Gušt sp’s wishes. In the ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may... the spirit of Gušt sp, just like that of Ard y-V r f, stays for seven days in the Other World.84 The interesting point is the comparison of Gušt sp’s ascending to the Other World with Ard ’s journey. Thus, after drinking three bowels of wine, Ard ’s soul also ascends to the Other World, and he stays with the Holy Immortals for one
81 ‘H ̈m’ (Avestan: haoma-), a plant which syrup/sap/emulsion used in religious ritual. 82 It is possible that D nkard has another and different version of this story. 83 It seems that this paragraph, like some others, has been added to the original text by Dar b Hurmazdy r, the versifier. Or, perhaps the source for his versification was another quotation from D dest n M n Xrad, because this paragraph is not found in the Parsig texts of D dest n M n Xrad.
84 In the Zar tušt-N ma Gušt sp is asleep for three days.

week. He is there informed of secrets, and after returning he recounts them to the King of Kings of the time, Ardaš r-i B bak n (Unv l 1922: I.271).
Kerd r’s Journey
Kerd r85 lived in the third century A.D. As he himself says, he upheld an important religious title in the time of four Sassanid kings, (Š p r 240-272), (Hurmazd 272-273), Wahr m (Bahr m) son of Š p r (274-276) and Wahr m son of Wahr m (276-293) (Naqš-i Rajab 2001: 27-30). There are four inscriptions of Kerd r: Sar Mašhad (KSM), Naqš-i Rustam (KNRm), Kaᤱba-yi Zartušt (KKZ) and Naqš-i Rajab (KNRb). The Sar Mašhad inscription was engraved about 290 A.D, but the three others have been engraved later, maybe in the beginning of the reign of Wahr m III (Gignoux 1973: 215). Kerd r’s report on his journey is to be found in the three inscriptions: (KSM), (KNRm) and (KNRb).The main report of Kerd r’s journey to the Other World is found in the Sar Mašhad inscription. The account is also found in the Naqš-i Rustam inscription. Unfortunately, the second half of both inscriptions are severely damaged, so the last part of the story is missing. An allusion to Kerd r’s journey is found in the Naqš-i Rajab inscription as well.
The Sar Mašhad and the Naqš-i Rustam inscriptions
When Kerd r has been given a high rank in his country in the present world, he requests of the gods to show him the Other World as well, so that he may understand what will be the end of good and evil deeds and what Paradise and Hell are like. He also wants to know if he is a virtuous man and will go to Paradise or if he is an evil-doer and Hell will be his eternal place after death. Kerd r claims that it is due to his obedience and what he has done for the sake of religion that he is allowed to see the Other World (KNRm 199: 56). In short, Kerd r journeys to the Other World because he merits it (KSM 1991: 31). After his request, Kerd r prays ritually. Later, some creatures called rathv g or r s g/r s g appear and reproduce pictures of the Other World. These creatures announce that they have seen a king who is riding a noble white horse and carrying a flag in his hand. Then someone whose face looks like Kerd r’s appears seated like a king on his throne. Perhaps this is Kerd r’s faravahr (his celestial body) (Gignoux 1968: 409).86 He comes face to face
85 There is a variation in the reading of Kerd r’s name: Kerdar, Kirdar, Kardar, Kartir (Kardel in Coptic texts and ±23 ́μ¶3 and K¶3·μ¶3 in Greek texts). For further information on the various readings of this name, see the following works: Henning 1942: 941-953, (952); Gnoli 1980: 224, 247; Gignoux 1986: 105-106. 86 Also see Tafa╲╲ul 1991: 734.

with a beautiful lady who is moving towards him from the east. Kerd r declares openly that he has never seen such a noble lady. Kerd r’s double takes the lady, who is the symbol of the religion, by her hand. The lady guides him on an illuminated path towards the east. They see a sovereign dressed in white who is sitting on a golden throne with a pair of scales before him. They both stand in front of him, and then they pass him and reach another king dressed in white, who is also sitting on a golden throne. The bottomless pit of Hell full of snakes, scorpions, crocodiles and all sorts of reptiles, which are very scaring to the narrators, becomes visible. A sharp razor-like bridge is fixed over the pit, and they have to pass it. While they are passing, the bridge expands in front of the two. They see another king who comes toward them from the other side. He takes them by the hand and leads them across the bridge. Afterwards, they all continue their way towards the east together. After passing the bridge, the king, Kerd r’s double and the lady arrive in a portico. There is a throne at the far end of the portico and the two go up and sit in a special chamber. Afterwards, Kerd r’s double eats some bread and wine. Finally all go together into the presence of Ohrmazd, and it seems that Ohrmazd points at Kerd r’s double and gives him a smile of satisfaction (KSM 1991: 26-58; KNRm 1991: 49-73).87
The specific circumstances of Kerd r’s journey
After praying, Kerd r says a benediction which he calls iv n mahr. Perhaps this is a kind of “ritual mantra” (Utas 1989-1991: 15)88 that helps him to conceive the Other World, but there are no details about this iv n mahr. Unfortunately, this benediction is not among Zoroastrain benedictions known to-day. It is not known if iv n mahr used to be accompanied by any particular religious ceremonies. Because of this, there is a question about whether Kerd r used any kind of drinkables or edibles and whether he profited of any kind of medium to journey to the Other World. Also in the Naqš-i Rajab inscription, Kerd r points to a ritual, in fact, another ritual the name of which is kirdag n (KNRb 2001‘a’: 8,12,15), for his journey to the Other World. The kirdag n ritual is also unknown. However, it seems that Kerd r
87 There are various readings, translations and studies of Kerd r’s inscriptions. Among the researchers are the following names: E. Thomas: 1868; E.W. West: 1870, 1881; E. Herzfeld: 1924, 1926; W.B. Henning: 1957, 1963; M. Sprengling: 1953; R.N. Frye: 1965; W. Hinz: 1971; M.-L. Chaumont: 1960; Ph. Gignoux: 1968 [1969], 1972, 1973, 1984; Ch.J. Brunner: 1974; M. Back: 1978; P.O. Skjærvø: 1983; MacKenzie: 1984, 1989 (MacKenzie 1989: 3572). Later than MacKenzie: F. Grenet: 1990; Ph. Gignoux: 1991 (Gignoux 1991: 10-12) and Dary y 2001). Some extracts of Kerd r’s inscriptions have been also published, for example: (Utas 19891991: 15-16), (Tafa╲╲ul 1991: 733-35). 88 Compare Skjærvø 1983: 278ff.

was able to travel to the Other World due to accomplishing that ritual (Dary y 2001: 8).89 Gnoli and Gignoux express the opinion that according to Sar Mašhad and Naqš-i Rustam, Kerd r has not journeyed to the Other World himself, but his narration is just intuitions that the gods have granted him (Gnoli 1979: 450; Gignoux 1984: 20). Gignoux adds that, although there is no mention of an intoxicating substance in Kerd r’s journey, everything related to his journey is due to his dreams or his intuitions (Gignoux 1984: 20). If, on the other hand, the earlier interpretation of his inscriptions is correct, Kerd r’s narration should be seen as a report of a journey to the Other World. Obviously, this journey and the report of it may be understood in various ways. In Herzfeld’s opinion Kerd r, Ard y-V r f and Tansar are all the same person (Herzfeld 1935: 100-102). There is a great similarity between Kerd r’s and Ard y-V r f’s reports of the Other World, and that is what has caused Herzfeld to assume that both of them are actually the same account. Considering the time when they lived, Tavadia criticizes Herzfeld for supposing them to be the same and argues that, although Ard y-V r f’s journey report is similar to Kerd r’s revelation, it is not correct to make them the same person (Tavadia 1956: 118). But how has the similarity between these two travel reports become possible? Here I would like to draw attention to the similarities between Ard yV r f’s and Kerd r’s travel reports. I suppose that these two reports have the same origin, that is, Kerd r has probably not journeyed to the Other World. He has just rewritten Ard y-V r f’s description and has thus produced a report of an unachieved journey. But what was Kerd r’s motivation for doing this? We know that Kerd r did all that was in his power to propagate Zoroastrianism all over Iran, and he himself confirms this too: “The Religions of Ahr man (devil) and the demons were expelled from the kingdom and they became homeless” (KKZ 1991: 9-10). In the continuation of such methods, Kerd r needed to do something that no one else could do, something beyond human power. What is more beyond human power than journeying to the Other World? It would not be possible to do such such a thing except by being directly related to the gods and by their help. Kerd r’s claims of journeying to the Other World and his report of that journey would first and foremost have shown him as such a virtuous man of religion that the gods are helping him to see the Other World: “The gods presented me the Other World in the way it is in order for me to obtain more confidence” he says (KNRb 2001: 6-9).
89 Nyberg (1974: II.113) has translated kirdag n as ‘divine service’ and ‘pious work’, although he has not written anything about the content of this ritual. MacKenzie (1990: 49) has translated kirdag n as ‘action’.

The choice of a subject such as journeying to the Other World was quite suitable, because Jamš d’s, Zarathustra’s, Wišt sp’s and, perhaps the most important of all, Ard y-V r f’s journey had been fixed in the mind of the Iranians and had a very old origin in their beliefs. Especially Ard y-V r f had the same sense of duty as Kerd r believed himself to have, namely journeying to and seeing the Other World to be informed of the result of virtuous and evil deeds, and then to propagate and warn people of the Other World. Since there are few details in Jamš d’s, Zarathustra’s and Wišt sp’s journeys, Kerd r chose Ard y-V r f’s travel report as the best and most useful one. By claiming that he had visited the Other World and that the gods had helped him to do this, Kerd r had not only obtained a super-human and holy image among people, but this had also been a suitable way to get closer to the king and to acquire a special position and increased power. In any case, he gained such a position that no one, not even the king himself, had the courage to question his holy state. Using Ard y-V r f’s report had the advantage that there was no need for thinking about any details of the journey, because Ard y-V r f had finished it before him. Thus the account was ready and available and the sights had been described already. As previously mentioned, it is a fact that except the Ard y-V r f N ma, there were other texts in which the Other World had been explained either in details or briefly, but if the description of the Other World by Kerd r had used these texts, they could not have gained him the desired position. Furthermore, Jamš d, Zarathustra and Wišt sp were not “chosen by the gods” in the same way, and their travel reports were not detailed enough to be a useful description of such a journey. As has been said before, Kerd r was looking for a magnificent and clear model that could represent him as a chosen one and which at the same time could give a vivid picture of his journey. He could find such a model only in the Ard y-V r f N ma. Therefore, he began to re-write Ard y-V r f’s report. When studying Kerd r’s functions, we understand that he was able to increase his power more and more. One of the proofs of this power is that, even if Kerd r was never a king, he was the only ancient Iranian non-royal person who left royal types of inscriptions as his memorial (Dary y 2001: 3), the main subject of his inscriptions being just the reports of his journey to the Other World. Nobody knows when the Ard y-V r f N ma was written, not even approximately. But, since its main subject matter is very old (Widengren 1961: 13; Tavadia 1956: 117; Boyce 1968‘a’: 48; Tafa╲╲ul 1991: 733), it was simply possible for Kerd r to find the opportunity of profiting from it, even in its oral form. His travel reports in Sar Mašhad and Naqš-i Rustam clearly give evidence of that. The gain that Kerd r sought to attain resulted in the similarities between his travel report and that of Ard y-V r f N ma, and, due to this, Herzfeld assumed Kerd r, Ard y-V r f and Tansar to be the same person (Herzfeld 1935: 100-102). However, with due attention to their dif



53
ferent histories and lifetimes, it is obviously incorrect to assume that these three persons were one and the same (Tavadia 1956: 117-118).
Journey of Zoroaster the Pamphylian
The fourth group includes two texts. The first is called Peri physe s (On Nature), and is written in Greek. This work has been attributed to Zoroaster, and a part of it, which is preserved, is about Zoroaster’s journey to the Other World. The second one is another account of the same journey, although with a different traveller, which Plato also quotes in his book Politeia (The Republic).
Peri physe s
Among the works in the tradition of Hellenistic learning that have been attributed to Zoroaster, there are three well-known books. One of them is called “Peri physe s”, written on papyrus rolls, which includes four “books” or four volumes (Beck 1991: 528).90 Peri physe s is the most interesting of the three works, both because of its more varied contents and its frame narrative. The contents of this book are thus presented as truths revealed by the gods to Zoroaster (idem: 528-529). In one section of Peri physe s, Zoroaster talks about his journey to the Other World. His speech has disappeared as well as the book itself, but the first section of the journey report has also been recorded by Clemens of Alexandria (150-c.215 A.D.) and has remained down to our time:
These things I wrote, I, Zoroaster, son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by race, who died in war, whatever I learnt from the gods while I was in Hades (Hell) (idem: 518).91
Politeia
Plato has mentioned a variant of the travel account by Zoroaster the Pamphylian in the last section of his book Politeia, but Plato’s narrating character is not Zoroaster but someone called Er: Here follows a summary of this account, which is found in Politeia (1942: II.491-521):
Er, son of Armenius, was a brave man from Pamphylia. He was killed in war. When those killed in war were gathered together after ten days, even though all the other killed men’s corpses had decayed, his body was fresh. When his
90 The two other books are Asteroskopika or Apotelesmatika in five volumes and Peri lithontimion in one volume. More information on these works can be found in Bidez-Cumont (1938: I.134). 91 Clément D’Alexandrie: Strom., V, 14; 103, 2 (t. II, p. 395 Stählin = Eusèbe, Praep. Evangel., XIII, 13, p. 675D) Bidez, J. et Cumont, F.: O 12., II. 158-9.

body was placed on firewood to be set on fire on the twelfth day, suddenly he revived and narrated what he had seen in the Other World: When the soul left my body, accompanied by a lot of people, we reached a wonderful place. There were two hatch-ways on the ground and two others in the sky opposite each other. Some judges were sitting between the hatchways, they judged people’s deed in their lifetime. Whoever was righteous, they installed a tablet on his chest and led him to the right up towards the sky. They installed another tablet on the back of whoever was a tyrant and guided him to the left towards the way leading downwards. When it was my turn, the judge told me to be alert and to observe everything well, so that I would be able to inform the people of the situation in the Other World when I returned. The people whose cases had been dealt with and who had given their account to God, each group went their way via either the celestial or the terrestrial hatch-way. Then a chaste and charismatic party came down from the celestial hatch-way. From the terrestrial hatchway a dirty and dusty group came out. Afterwards, all came together on a green meadow. The first group narrated their celestial joys merrily but the second explained in tears their thousands years of punishments and sufferings. After a seven days residence on the meadow, both groups left on the eighth day, and then they arrived in a place where the Spindle of Necessity, on which the circulation of all heavenly spheres depends, was suspended by eight intricate wheels from a chain of light. Finally, both groups drew lots from the Spindle of Necessity which determined their personalities and the style of their new lives on earth. Afterwards, all went into the plain of oblivion and all were forced to drink of the water in the River of Forgetfulness. But Er was not permitted to drink because his mission was to explain the Other World to people of the present world. Even so, he was not able to remember where and how his soul returned to his body. When he opened his eyes upon his return to the world he found himself on top of the accumulated firewood.
Peri physe s or Politeia
Concerning the author of Peri physe s and its travel report, Proclus92 believed that “the author [of Peri physe s] has simply plagiarized the opening of the “Myth of Er” from Plato’s Republic [Politeia] (614b), substituting Zoroaster’s name for Er’s. As often happens, the genuine and the fake changed places” (Beck 1991: 518).93 But Colotes, an Epicurean philosopher of the mid-third century was of the opinion that the plagiarism of the Myth of Er flowed in the other direction; that it was Plato who had substituted Er’s name for Zoroaster’s (idem: 529).94 There have sometimes been such arguments among philosophers. They thought that either the author of Peri physe s had copied Plato’s work or, on the contrary, it was Plato who had copied the author of Peri physe s. Per
92 Proclus Diadochus is a Greek philosopher and mathematician (b.about 410-d. 485). 93 Proclus, In Remp., II, p. 109, Kroll: commentaire aux mots de Platon (p. 614 B) Bidez, J. et Cumont, F.: O 13, II, p. 159. 94 Bidez, J. et Cumont, F.: O 13, 2-6, II, p. 159-160.



55
haps, however, there have been some exaggerations in this discussion. For example, Colotes is accused of expressing his opinion about Plato, “The natural inference from this is that Colotes knew, or knew of, the pseudepigraphic treatise On Nature [Peri physe s] and mistook the derivative (Zoroaster’s) for the original (Plato’s) – willfully, perhaps, in secterian zeal” (idem).95 Plato seems to have been affected by the work Peri physe s, in which the journey is attributed to Zoroaster, and also to have been acquainted with Iranian, especially Zoroastrian, thoughts. It may be pointed out that, it is in Plato, in the First Alcibiades (I.121), the authenticity of which has been wrongly contested (written 390 B.C.), that the first definite mention in Greece of the name of Zoroaster appears, and here also the interest which Plato took in doctrines circulating under the authority of the Magi first manifests itself (Benveniste 1924: 16). Furthermore, towards the end of his life, Plato shows in the Law the importance which the distinction between the opposing realms of Good and Evil assumed in his eyes (Law: Leg X, 896). Although already the oldest Greek philosophy delighted in regarding the world as the product of two opposite principles, it is difficult not to take into account the unanimous statements of Plato’s disciples, that he at least knew, even if he did not adopt, the dualistic conceptions of the Magi (Benveniste 1924: 16-17). According to J. Bidez’ research,96 Eliade finds it increasingly probable that at least certain elements of the Platonic system are of Irano-Babylonian origin (Eliade 1954: 128). The 22nd paragraph of Timaeus’ treatise (Timaeus: 22d) also provides evidence that Plato seems to have been familiar with Iranian conceptions of natural disasters as a means for the purification of the human race (Eliade 1954: 122). Finally, A.D.H. Bivar is convinced of the similarities between IranianZoroastrian narrations and that of Er. He investigates and studies traces of Plato’s Mithraistic thoughts in Pliny, Cicero and Seneca’s works to make it clear that Plato was acquainted with Zoroastrianism and Mithraism (Bivar 1998: 72-74, 77). He shows evidence in proof of this that cannot be easily ignored. 1. Plato as a young man lived in the home of his stepfather Pyrilampes. He must have heard stories about Iran and its royalties from Pyrilampes, since he had been employed on embassies to the Persian king (idem: 6871).
95 Bidez, J. et Cumont, F. : I, 111. 96 Eliade believes that Bidez in Éos, ou Platon et l’Orient (Brussels 1945) “takes into consideration especially the researches of Boll, Bezold, W. Gundel, W. Jaeger, A. Götze, J. Stenzel, and even Reitzenstein’s interpretations despite the objections that some of them have aroused” (Eliade 1954: 120).

2. “A tradition attributed to Aristotle tells how a Magus who had come from Syria foretold to Socrates that his would be an enforced death” (idem: 71).97 3. “Plato encountered in Phoenicia Persians, from whom he learnt the doctrine of Zoroaster” (idem: 72).98 4. The “Myth of Er” has a quite characteristic relation to the Zoroastrian tradition (idem: 83).99 5. A certain visitor who came to Plato is described as a “Chaldaean”. He seems to have conversed with Plato during the last night of his life (idem: 73).100 6. The Persian Mithridates commissioned a portrait statue of Plato in the Academy (idem: 74). In addition to these, as Bivar states, Pliny (NHXXX, 30.1.9) also claims that Plato had studied the Zoroastrian religion (Bivar 1998: 72). In accordance with this, even if the Myth of the journey of Er the Pamphylian has not been completely copied from the journey of Zoroaster the Pamphylian,101 the main subject of Er’s journey to the Other World is still a result of the Greeks’, and in this context particularly Plato’s recognition of and acquaintance with Iranian-Zoroastrian thoughts and philosophy.102
Wirkak’s journey
In addition to the four above-mentioned groups, there is also another report of journeying to the Other World that is not written but pictorial. In the summer of 2003, one of the greatest discoveries related to the Central Asian peoples of the sixth century A.D. took place outside Xi‘an in China. The excavation culminated in a typical Chinese house-shaped tomb, where a stone sarcophagus was placed on the ground. Its four walls were lavishly decorated with painted and gilded reliefs depicting scenes of banquets, hunting, journeys, caravans and, the most interesting one, a representation of an ascent to heaven. All these show a close contact between the Central Asian and Iranian worlds. There were two stone inscriptions on the
97 See also Cumont 1975: 157. 98 See also Westerink 1962: (page 9 of text, lines 8-13). 99 See also Kerschensteiner 1945: 140-143. 100 See also Kingsley 1995: 199-200. 101 To study the effects of Iranian thoughts and philosophy upon Plato in his writing of the “Myth of Er”, refer to the following researches: Geffeken 1928: 517-528; Sanjana 1932: 3980; Windischmann 1863. Duchesne-Guillemin has also contemplated the myth of Er, but he is in doubt whether, the other world basis on Iranian World View, has any influence on Plato; as Bidez claims (Duchesne-Guillemin 1953: 101-103). 102 About the effects of Iranian philosophy, especially the Zoroastrian thoughts on Plato, refer to: Brobeck 1893: 238-250; Panoussi 1969: 91-114; Panoussi 2536 (1978); Hansman 1978: 215-227.

lintel above the door of the southern side of the sarcophagus, one in Sogdian and the other one in Chinese. The owner of the tomb was called Wirkak, an Iranian merchant, according to the Sogdian inscription.103 He died at the age of eighty-six years in 579 (Grenet, Riboud et Junkai 2004: 274104).
The relief of Wirkak’s tomb
A stone door was erected at the southern side of Wirkak’s sarcophagus, surrounded by two guardian gods, each trampling a demon. There are two false mullion windows at both sides of the sarcophagus and under each one a picture of a priest-bird was painted, supposedly a symbol of Sur š (idem: 278279). The most important part of Wirkak’s tomb relief is three partial scenes of the Other World. Chinvad Bridge is in the centre of the scene. Four persons, a man, a woman and two children are passing over the bridge. They have nearly reached the end of the passage. The light in front of them gives light to the way of the souls.105 Some animals, such as horses, donkeys, cows, sheep, camels, a bird and some unknown animals, are following them over the bridge. Two persons dressed in Zoroastrian priest clothes are standing as guardians at the entrance of the bridge. The heads and shoulders of the two guardian dogs of the bridge are also seen immediately behind these two priests. The mountain106 which the soul must climb stands at a distance beyond the dogs. Hell is painted as a dreadful mass of waves of a lake under the bridge. Several posts with monster headed capitals emerge out of the interior of Hell.107 Along the Hell side, in the left part of the relief, ducks are swimming in the water towards a stony bank. A group of celestial musicians are playing different kinds of musical instruments in the sky above the bridge. A herd of winged horses are shown flying in the middle part of the relief. A two-armed god holding a trident in his right hand, seated cross-legged on three bulls,108 is seen at the top right corner of the relief. The Amš spand n, the celestial beings, are pictured on Wirkak’s tomb relief at different levels in the sky (idem: 273-284).
103 Pay attention to close similarities between two names, Wirkak and V r f. 104 Rah m Aša introduced this source to me. Thanks to him. 105 taxš-kirb (The godess of Fire) is the assistant of virtuous souls in passing Chinvad Bridge and destroying the darkness of Hell (WZad 1993: XXX.52). 106 “[That goddess] stands as a mountain for the soul to climb to the top” (ibid). 107 “The lower structure of the bridge is supported by posts with monster headed capitals” (Grenet, Riboud et Junkai 2004: 277). But they are more similar to monster creatures of Hell than to posts supporting a bridge. 108 Among the gods, it is W y who wears the armors of war and has a sharp spear and golden armours (Yt. XV 1959: ll.48). W y’s armours are described in Yasht XV.56. But there is nothing said about his trident.



58
Since Wirkak’s tomb relief is a unique pictorial specimen of an Iranian’s journey to the Other World, it is extraordinarily valuable.
Specific circumstances of Wirkak’s journey
Wirkak’s journey has one specific charcteristic, namely that among all the Iranian journeys to the Other World it is the only one that does not show a return to this world. Due to this, Wirkak’s pictorial report of the Other World cannot be his own narration. Perhaps his successors, relatives or friends have painted his journey to the Other World. There is nothing known about any customs of this type, since Zoroastrians neither used to bury their dead nor lay them in tombs. Thus, there are no traces of Zoroastrian graves or tombs anywhere.109 Due to that, Wirkak’s tomb relief is unique in its kind. It can be supposed that this is due to the effect of the culture and painting style of China, the country where he lived, since there they have painted tombs and graves. It is also possible that Wirkak’s commercial journeys had taken him to Egypt as well, and that he had been affected by the culture of that ancient country. This may be one of the reasons why he had ordered his tomb to have pictures of his journey to the Other World. It is quite clear, however, that this journey is depicted according to Zoroastrian beliefs. Some of the motifs on Wirkak’s tomb relief give reason for astonishment. These are the fact that there are two children among those who pass over Chinvad Bridge, and, indeed, that a group of four are passing together. The different animals that pass over the bridge and the existence of celestial musician and winged horses, swimming birds and a two-armed god seated on the three bulls in the highest heaven are all reasons for astonishment. Passing Chinvad Bridge is an individual act in all abstract narrative texts. There is no indication of children passing Chinvad Bridge in Zoroastrian texts,110 and
109 There are some exceptions among royalties. For example, in spite of all doubts and debates related to the religion of the Achaemenian kings (Zoroastrian or non-Zoroastrian), the place of their tombs in Naqš-i Rustam must be considered (Herzfeld 1941: 216-220). Likewise, the tomb of King Khusrau I An ša-Rav n (531-579 A.D.) is important because of the legends about the place where it was discovered at the time of the Abbassid Ma’mun (Ma’m n-i ‘Abb s ) (Jam lz da 1975: 25-60). 110 It may be that the children are passing the bridge, indicates the st r in Parsig and sitar, situr, istar or istur in Zoroastrian and New Persian. According to Zoroastrianism, whenever, someone dies who has had no child when his soul reaches the Chinvad Bridge, the middle part of the bridge seems to be broken. Then the soul feels astonished and perplexed at what to do? It can neither return nor continue. He is called a person of “the broken bridge”, because the Amš spand n will not judge him at this point. He should wait there until the resurrection day. Due to this, his heirs appoint a child as his ‘st r’ (istur / istar). This child is the legal heir of the dead person. In this case, the Chinvad Bridge rejoins and the Amš spand n can judge his deeds without any delay (យDB 1909: LXII.1-6).



59
there is no allusion to animals passing the bridge, neither to winged cows, swimming birds nor the god seated on bulls with a trident in his hand.111 On the other hand, there are some common points between Wirkak’s tomb relief and the Ard y-V r f N ma as well as to other Zoroastrian texts about the Other World:112 Sur š is presented in the form of a bird (rooster?) that is painted twice on the southern front side of the sarcophagus, the presence of the two Amš spand n at the entrance of the Chinvad Bridge, the existence of two guardian dogs, the fire that lightens the passage way, the mountain which the virtuous soul climbs, the existence of different levels in Heaven, and the fact that different Amš spand n and Ohrmazd are found in different positions in Heaven.
After Islam
Belief in the existence of the Other World, as well the reports of a journey to this Other World was so extensive and deep in ancient Iran that its effects can easily be found upon Iranian culture after Islam. This influence is manifested, for example, in a variety of religious and non-religious, versified or prose works.113 A citation of a few examples of famous Iranian works related to the Islamic period can give an indication of this massive influence. New Persian literature, from the early days of the New Persian language up to now, has seen plenty of works in which the soul, after dying, has given a report of what it has met in the Other World. This is indeed a major part of the Islamic-Iranian religious classical mystical and gnostic literature. To explain this, just a few examples of such works from different ages will be presented briefly. This can prove Ard y-V r f N ma’s influence on the Islamic Iranian literature. The first effects are present in ┹abar ’s114 (┹abar 1961: 3.666)115 Maibud ’s116 (Maibud 1985: 4.259,286) and R z ’s117 commentaries of the
111 Wirkak’s tomb relief represents a mixture of eastern mythological beliefs, but why these mixed motifs have been pictured on a Zoroastrian tomb, is a question that probably has plenty of answers. 112 For more information related to the main subject of Wirkak’s tomb, refer to comments in Grenet, Riboud et Junkai 2004: 278ff. 113 As was mentioned at the beginning of this section, in this study we just review some descriptions and journeys to the Other World in the Iranian tradition in order to study the effects of the Ard y-V r f N ma upon the Iranian Islamic culture and works that have been created in this cultural sphere at different times. Attention to the probable effects of the Ard y-V r f N ma upon works created beyond the Iranian tradition such as the Ris lat-ul ufr n (Epistle of Forgiveness) by Abul-‘al Ma‘arr and Divina Commedia by Dante Alighieri, are not discussed, since there is enough research and debate related to them. 114 Mu9ammad Jar r-i ┹abar has written his Commentary of the Quran in ten volumes in the year 966-975. 115 About the effects of Iranian culture upon ┹abar , refer to Henry Corbin’s writings: Corbin, Henry 1971: L’Homme de lumière dans le soufisme iranien, Paris, p. 56.

Quran: “It has been quoted that the prophet said: when a righteous dead person rises up from the grave, his good deeds come to him in a very beautiful appearance, the dead asks, who is it? I see you as very good-looking, of a good nature and beneficent. He replies: I am your good deeds. Then he leads him and gives light to his way towards Paradise. On the contrary, when the unbeliever rises up from his grave, his evil deed comes to him in an ugly and ill-tempered shape. The dead asks; who is it whom I see as an ill-favoured man. He replies: I am your evil deeds, I will not leave you until I lead you to Hell”, R z states in his commentary (R z 1965: 5.209). Another work clearly and exactly affected by Iranian beliefs, is Imam Mu9ammad £azz l ’s (l058-1111) recapitulation of good deed (da n : conscience/religion) visiting the dead souls in the Other World. In £azz l ’s version the face and figure of good deed (da n /d n) has been modified to a handsome man because of Islamic restrictions, but the message and the main words are all the same as in the Iranian ancient narration: “Then a well dressed, sweet-smelling, handsome man comes to him (the soul of the dead) and says: I give you good tidings of your Creator’s mercy and of the Paradise where you will enjoy eternal bliss. The soul replies to him: Peace upon you, who are you then? - I am your good deed, he says”.118 (£azz l Mu9aqqiq 1960: 103). Maulav ’s view of “bad death” as opposed to “good death” is also an indication of how he has been directly affected by the concept of the soul visiting his da n (conscience/religion) in Zoroastrian tradition. In his book, Ma᠒nav -yi ma‘nav , he states: “death as a mirror in which we see the reality of ourselves, whether it is ugly, it is not the fault of death and if it is nice, its beauty is nothing, except the reality of our personality”119 (Šaf ‘ Kadkan 1974: 73). The subject matter of the poem Sair-ul-‘ib d ilal-ma‘ d of San ’ £aznav (died about 1130) is also a description of an imagined journey to the seven firmaments and the place of evil-doings, Hell of snakes, and fires, then to the Kingdom of Heaven (place of the angels), the place of the good and radiant human beings, and at the end to the highest point of Heaven (sky of skies), the place of light and the righteous (San ’ £aznav 1969: 179-233). Another description of the same as journey can be seen in Mi᠀b ᜸-ul arv ᜸ (Lantern of the souls), versified by Šamsudd n Mu9ammad-i Bards r at the
116 Abulfa╲l A9mad ibn-i Mu9ammad Maibud began writing a ten volume Commentary, Kašful-asr r wa ‘uddat-ul-abr r (Discovering the Secrets and Promise to free men), in 1126. 117 Abul-fut 9-i R z , born in about 1087 dead after 1157, is the writer of a ten volume Commentary, called Raw᜸ al-jin n va r ᜸ al-jan n (The Breeze of the Gardens and the Spirit of
the Heart).

end of the eleventh century A.D.120 This journey is divided into seven stages. The name of each is extracted from an attribute of the soul. The first stage is the nafs-i amm ra(h) (spirit of lasciviousness), his place is Hell, full of fire, smoke and devils, and the last stage is the nafs-i f niyya(h) (mortal spirit) (Utas 1989-1991: 18-21). Both of these poetic texts, are clearly influenced by the Ard y-V r f N ma, especially as regards the description of the journeys and the places that the journeys at last reach.
These traditions have even affected the literature of Iran after the constitutional revolution (1906), which is the time of the foundation of Iranian modern literature. At that time, a Muslim priest, 8ujjat-ul-isl m q -Najaf Q n (1878-1944) was profoundly influenced by the Ard y-V r f N ma, when he wrote his “novel-like” work” called: Siy ᜸at-i arb (Touring the West),121 which is an idealistic-imaginary journey to the Other World. In modern Iranian literature and drama this theme of journeying to the Other World has recurred over and over again. Ri╲ D nišvar wrote a satirical play, Safar-i q -yi Ard -V r f (Mr. Ard -V r f’s Journey), at the time of the Iranian Islamic Revolution (1978-1979). Bahr m Bayz y also wrote a play on this theme, Guz riš-i Ard -V r f (The Report of Ard -V r f), in 1999 (Q k siy n 2002: 320). However, none of them has been published yet. In the chain of journeys to the Other World in Iranian literature, whether profiting from the ancient story of the Ard y-V r f N ma or reproducing it directly, or even applying it to Islamic beliefs, it has been used continuously throughout the centuries, being related to different matters and problems of the actual periods. The ultimate goal of these citations is to show the beauty of good deeds and the enormous pleasant reward in Heaven for them. They also try to show the ugliness of evil deeds and how they are punished in Hell. Still, the evil deeds of humanity have increased more than ever. Does this not show that mankind more and more seems to doubt the existence of retribution in the Other World?122
120 The text version that I use has been established according to the Bad ‘ulzam n-i Fur z nfar’s posthumous notes (found in the edition publ. by I. Afš r). I have utilized the critical edition of Bo Utas, which he has not published yet. 121 About the ‘West’ writers refer to this citation of Im m-Mu9ammad B qir, the fifth Imam of the Shiites: “There is a garden in the west of the world, irrigated by the Euphrates, where the believers’ spirits enjoy God’s gifts every morning and evening.” ( q -Najaf Q n 2001: 3) 122 There are two major secondary works on Iranian conceptions of the Other World, namely Söderblom (1901) and Pavry (1926).

IV. Previous Research
During the last two centuries, on several occasions mention has been made of the Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrian Persian prose. Three different approaches to the work can be seen, as follows: Indication of the existence of the work, sometimes with an explanation about its theme Presentation of manuscripts of the work found in different libraries Research about the contents of the work The occasions in the scientific literature where the Ard y-V r f N ma has been mentioned are in chronological order as follows: 1816 J. A. Pope is the first researcher who presents a translation of Ard y-V r f N ma in one of the European languages. Pope’s translation is closely similar to the Zoroastrian Persian prose version of Ard y-V r f N ma. He presents three different texts as the basis of his translation into English,124 all three in Zoroastrian Persian (Pope 1816: xiv). The first, in prose, by N š rv n Kirm n The second, in verse, by Zartušt Bahr m [Pajd ] The third, in prose, by the same There are two points which need correction in Pope’s presentation of his sources. The first is that the narration by N š rv n Kirm n is in verse,125 not in prose, and it has been printed in the D r b Hormazy r’s Riv yat (Unv l 1922: II.331-342). The second point is that it is not clear, what he means by the words “by the same” in his third source. Does it mean Zartušt Bahr m? This would be the natural interpretation. However, there is no track of any Ard y-V r f N ma narrated in prose by Zartušt Bahr m, and, furthermore, he himself has never been mentioned in connection with such a text anywhere. Here it is necessary to mention that Kay-Khusrau Isfandiy r has indicated the existence of a prose version of Ard y-V r f N ma versified by Zartušt Bahr m, in his Dabist n-i Ma hib (The school of religions) (Kay-Khusrau Isfandiy r 1983: 2.94-100). But, is this exactly the same text as the one referred to by Pope? However, in one part, this cannot be “that prose narration by the same”, i.e. Zartušt Bahr m, because this is a narration in prose by
124 According to the sub-title of Pope’s book (The Ardai Viraf Nameh, or the Revelations of Ardai Viraf, Translated from the Persian and Guzeratee versions), he has also used the Gujarati version for his translation, but there is no mention of this in his references. 125 Neither Haug and West (1872), nor Mu‘ n (1946) mention this fact.



64
Kay-Khusrau Isfandiy r of this work.126 On the other hand, Pope has not mentioned any version of the Ard y-V r f N ma narrated in prose by KayKhusrau Isfandiy r anywhere. Haug and West supposed that Pope’s third text might refer to a copy of the H28 manuscript (Haug-West 1872: xix). Since Pope’s translation is very close to the Zoroastrian Persian prose Ard yV r f N ma, thus, it is probably a true supposition. Finally, it must be mentioned that Pope had stated in the end of his preface that the Ard y-V r f N ma had been originally written in Zand and it has later been translated into Persian, Sanskrit and Hindi of Gujarat (= Gujarati) (Pope 1816: xiii-xiv). However, the question is whether Pope means the original meaning of Zand, because Zand means the translation of the Avestan texts into Parsig, often accompanied by a commentary. In other words, nothing is “written originally” in Zand but rather translated into Zand (= Parsig) from the Avestan language. It cannot be ruled out that, like many others who have used the word Zand in former times, Pope also understood something else by this word than the way it is used today. The three terms Avesta, Zand and Pazand have earlier been mixed up and used in an inconsistent way (Tafa╲╲ul 1997: 115).127 1870 Ed. Sachau mentioned the Zoroastrian Persian prose translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma in his research about Zoroastrian Persian works and their themes. He considers this Zoroastrian Persian text the basis of Pope’s translation into English (Sachau 1870: 234). 1872 Martin Haug and E.W. West published the first extensive investigation about different versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma together with a Parsig text edited by Dast r Hoshangji Jamaspji Asa. They also published two other texts; Gosht-i Fryano, edited by West (pp. 205-266) and HadokhtNask edited by Haug (pp. 267-316). The work also contains a transcription and translation of all three texts. In their research, Haug and West point out the existence of various versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma in several languages, such as Parsig, Pazand, Sanskrit, Old Gujarati, New Gujarati and Persian. Furthermore, they also introduce many of its manuscripts; among them the H28, which consists of the Zoroastrian Persian prose text. In addition to introducing the text, they have printed the preface of Ard y-V r f N ma, which is a part of this very manuscript. Haug and West’s work includes the translation of this preface, too. Reading this preface, they have made some mistakes, for example, they have read « ဒကဒ » b n d as « ကကဒÌÒ» pl nand and « ဒ1⁄2ထ» yas r as « 1⁄2ဒ » b star.
126 The name of the first character is Ard -V r f in Zartušt Bahr m’s version, but it is Ard yV r f in Dabist n-i Maᑩ hib.
127 Nowadays Zand is again used in its original meaning of Avestan text translated into Parsig, often accompanied by a commentary.



65
These mistakes may originate from difficulties in reading the Persian handwriting of the manuscript. Furthermore, Haug and West (Haug-West 1872: iii-Lxxxvii) have made several assumptions and observations about the Zoroastrian Persian prose version, of which the following are the most important: The probability of 200 years’ antiquity of the H28 manuscript128 Similarities between the preface of the H28 manuscript and the first three chapters of the Parsig version The probability that the H28 manuscript is in fact the third text, referred to by Pope (see above) The fact that three to five folios of the H28 manuscript could be missing The likelihood that the same H28 manuscript is the possible source that has been used by Zartušt Bahr m for his versified version Important differences in the themes of the three texts; the Parsig version, the Zoroastrian Persian prose version and Pope’s version The existence of another version of Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrian Persian prose which does not differ much from those in verse, but without any preface, narrated by R m Khamb yat . Dast r Hoshangji is mentioned as a source for this information. It is important to note that Khamb yat ’s version mentioned by Haug and West is just the same version that is found in the H28 manuscript, and there is no “other Persian prose version” of this work. This version also has a preface and shows just the same divergence from the H28 manuscript, which has been seen between the H28 and the versified version. There are several transcripts of Khamb yat ’s version in the Navsari and Bombay libraries. Furthermore, one of the most important points in Haug’s and West’s research is their assumption about the original account and the first version of this visionary journey. Haug and West believe that the original account of the Ard y-V r f N ma lacked a preface and that it was added later by other authors who stood in close relation to the Zoroastrian cleric circles (Idem: lxxiii). 1873 In the first catalogue of the manuscripts of Mulla Firuz’s Library in Bombay, Edward Rehatsek recalls a collection in Persian named riv yat (narration) with the sub-number VIII.2. One of the treatises in this collection is a Zoroastrian Persian prose Ard y-V r f N ma, about which Rehatsek has given some information (Rehatsek 1873: 179). 1889 While presenting the Bodl. Or. 719 manuscript of Bodleian Library, Ed. Sachau has mentioned an anonymous prose-version of the Ard yV r f N ma. He supposed this was the text from which Dast r Zartušt Bahr m Pajd ’s versification originated. Afterwards, he mentioned Pope’s translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma. Then, quoting the first lines of the Bodleian
128 This means that it would be from the mid-17th century.

manuscript, he says that it is identical word for word to the H28 manuscript in Munich. Finally, he indicates the existence of another manuscript of this same text in the India Office Library (Sachau 1889: I.1112-1113). 1896-1904 While presenting the Zoroastrian Persian prose and verse works, i.e. “The Modern-Persian Zoroastrian Literature of the Parsis” as he himself names it, E.W. West also makes mention of the H28 manuscript of the Ard y-V r f N ma in the Munich Library which is an incomplete copy (West 1896-1904: 125). 1900 E. Blochet introduces the Suppl. Pers. 47 manuscript in the Catalogue des Manuscrits Mazdéens de la Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. The Ard y-V r f N ma is the sixteenth text of Blochet’s catalogue (Blochet 1900: 100). Many years later, Blochet repeats this information in the first volume of the Catalogue des Manuscrits Persans de la Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris (Blochet 1905: 1.169). 1902 Dastur Kaikhusru Jamaspji Jamasp Asa, published the Parsig version of the Arda Viraf Nameh, in addition to the Gujarati text and Zartušt Bahr m’s versified version.129 He refers to research done by Pope, HaugWest, and Barthélemy. In his introduction, Jamasp Asa points to the discrepancy between the time setting of the Parsig and the Zoroastrian Persian versions, and, following this, he quotes part of the introduction to the Zoroastrian Persian version in Pope’s translation (Jamasp Asa 1902: i-xii). 1903 Hermann Ethé presents the manuscript 2818 of the India Office Library with reference also to the manuscript in the Bodleian Library. In his presentation, he mentions Haug’s and West’s research (Ethé 1903: xv-xx). Ethé also supposes that the text he has presented might be the same as the version used as the basis of the versified Ard y-V r f N ma by Dast r Zartušt Bahr m Pajd (Ethé 1903: I.1518-1519). 1904 Ervad Bomanji Nusserwanji Dhabhar, along with presenting the យaddar Bundihiš, proceeds to make a comprehensive presentation of all manuscripts: T.30 in Navsari, the M, belonging to Unv l (E.M.R. Unv l ), the E in Navsari, and the K belonging to Dast r Kaikhusro Jamasp Asa, and he emphasizes the presence of the Zoroastrian Persian Ard y-V r f N ma in all of these (Dhabhar 1909: xix-xxi). 1904 On the basis of Pope’s English translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma, Geo Maddox publishes a poetic translation of this same work. Maddox calls his work “A Rendering in Prose-Verse of a Translation by Mr. T. A. Pope”,130 and he divides it into two “books” “Heaven” and “Hell” (Maddox 1904: 1-29, 30-65).
129 In this edition Arday Viraf Nameh has 1162 verses, which is incomplete (Muᤱ n 1946: 48). The original version of this work in ᤱAf f ’s edition (1964) contains 1849 verses. 130 This name has been written in the second title of the book, both on the cover and the first page, but it is wrong, because the name is actually J.A. Pope and not T.A. Pope.



67
1915 Christian Bartholomae introduces the prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma of the Munich Library M73 (H28) comprehensively, and he quotes three short selected sections from the text (Bartholomae 1915: 290292). 1920 In his book about the history of the Parsis, Shahpursha Hormasji Hodivala proceeds to the Riv yat of Kama Asa and a description of how the work, including Ard y-V r f N ma, was taken from Iran to India. He then tells about the colophon and the date of copying of the prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma and relates it to this narration. He also mentions another manuscript of the text which is in prose and dated the year 901 A.Y. /1532 A.D., along with recalling several other manuscripts of various versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma (Hodivala 1920: 296-301). 1923‘a’ E.B.N. Dhabhar introduces a prose manuscript of the Ard yV r f N ma, in K. R. Cama Oriental Institute Catalogue sub-numbered MS.65, showing that it has lost several pages in different places (Dhabhar 1923‘a’: 149-150). 1923‘b’ E.B.N. Dhabhar presents two other prose manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma, from Mulla Firuz Library, in two separate collections, sub-numbered M.S.105 and M.S. 128 (Dhabhar 1923‘b’: 71-72; 85-86). 1925 E.B.N. Dhabhar presents the T.30 collection in Meherji Rana Library, in Navsari city, which is the oldest prose manuscript of the Ard yV r f N ma. He also introduces another manuscript of this work subnumbered F.44 in this same catalogue (Dhabhar 1923‘c’: 25-26, 118-120). 1940 Jamshedji Maneckji Unv l introduces colophons of the Ard yV r f N ma manuscripts from the Suppl. Pers .47 of Paris Bibliothèque Nationale, the 830. 280. 18A of the London India Office Library, and Bodl. Or. 719 of the Bodleian Oxford Library (Unv l 1940: 18, 100, 120). 1941 In his Oriental Treasures catalogue, Jamshed Cawasji Katrak gives a brief description of Kama Asa’s Riv yat collection and the date when it was taken from Iran. He mentions that the prose Ard y-V r f N ma is part of this collection and also tells about the existence of a copy of it. Furthermore, he states the place where the manuscript and its copy are being kept (Katrak 1941: 209-10). 1946 Mu9ammad Muᤱ n publishes an investigation about the Ard yV r f N ma and its various versions in different languages, among them the Zoroastrian Persian prose version. However, Mu‘ n has profited from Haug’s and West’s investigation to provide information about the prose version of this work, i.e. the H28 manuscript. His research presents some new contributions as well: A reconsidering of Pope’s sources An attempt at dating the H28 manuscript to the 4th and 5th century A.H./10th and 11th century A.D. on the basis of a stylistic analysis If Haug’s and West’s guess is true about Zartušt Bahr m basing his versified text on the Zoroastrian Persian prose translation, of which the



68
H28 manuscript is a copy, this translation must have come into existence before the 7th century A.H./13th century A.D. An edition of the preface, based on the text published in Haug and West (1872) (Mu‘ n 1946: 58-64). While editing the preface, Mu‘ n has also amended some words that have been written erroneously by the copyist and some where Haug and West are mistaken in their reading. However, it seems that he has not had any microfilm or photocopy of the original manuscript. Thus, due to that, he has done his edition on the basis of the edition of Haug and West; because of this, some reading mistakes of these two researchers were retained in his edition, for example; he reads « ဒÇ» “niyyat ” as « 1⁄2×ဒÇ» “n pst ” and « က Ð» “s xtand” as « က 1⁄2Ò» “pas xtand” and then he had to explain the meaning of these words in the footnotes. 1964 Ra9 m ᤱAf f edits and publishes the versified version of the Ard y-V r f N ma by Zartušt Bahr m Pajd . In the beginning of his book, he re-publishes the same preface of the Zoroastrian Persian prose version that Mu‘ n has edited according to the Haug and West edition, including Mu‘ n’s explanations (‘Af f 1964: 42-52). 1967-1969 Ž la m zg r mentions the prose Ard y-V r f N ma in her doctoral thesis, which is an investigation about Zoroastrian Literature in Persian (1969). Referring to the MS.S.P.47 manuscript of Paris, she finds this a complete copy of the work written in a simple style. Consequently, she quotes West’s opinion about the Munich copy as incomplete ( m zg r 1967: 64; 1969: 199).131 1983 Ž la m zg r collates two versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma; the Parsig version and Zartušt Bahr m Pajd ’s versified text. She also mentions the prose version of Ard y-V r f N ma and the two manuscripts of it in Paris and Munich ( m zg r 1983: 105).132 1995 Referring to the study made by Haug and West in 1872 and the long preface of the H28 manuscript, Carlo G. Cereti points out that Ard V raf and Ardash r P pak n were coevals, and states that as “an interesting ‘mytheme’ widespread among Indian Zoroastrians that links Ard W r z with Ardaš r” (Cereti 1995‘a’: 142). 2001 Carlo G. Cereti refers in a chapter about Ard W r z N mag to Pope’s translation based on the Persian and Gujarati versions and also mentions the M73 (H28) manuscript in which Ard y-V r f and Ardaxš r P bag n are coevals (Cereti 2001: 122-123). 2001 B žan £ayb studies the differences between two versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma; the one versified by Zartušt Bahr m Pajd and the Parsig
131 The number of the Munich manuscript is Haug MH7 in both these investigations; that is a mistake and the correct number is M73 (Haug 28). 132 m zg r does not mention the number of the Munich manuscript in this work. She just gives the page numbers of the Barthélemy in which this manuscript has been presented.

version. Along with that, he also here and there makes several references to the Zoroastrian Persian prose version. Moreover, he proposes the existence of two versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma, which are originally of two different and disparate backgrounds. One is the versified version by Zartušt Bahr m which originates in an irreligious and mythic source and the other one is a Parsig text that has been created according to religious traditions. As previously mentioned, Haug and West were the first scholars to bring up the probability of an originally irreligious account of the Ard y-V r f N ma (Haug-West 1872: lxxiii). £ayb also cites several examples from the “irreligious” version of Zartušt Bahr m to confirm this thesis and then he compares these examples with the same matters in the Parsig version, which is a “religious” text (£ayb 2001: 8, 14).133
In addition to the above mentioned persons, there are many other researchers who have commented on the Zoroastrian Persian prose Ard y-V r f N ma and of its manuscripts; some of them are the following: Rustamji (1868),134 Jamasp Asa (1902: i; iii), Modi (1922: I.12), Pavry (1926: 108-110), Tavadia (1956: 118), Gignoux (1984: 29-31), Tafa╲╲ul (1997: 169). Naturally, this presentation of research is what I have found during my careful investigation of the matter. In other words, there may be more studies of the Zoroastrian Persian prose Ard y-V r f N ma than the ones I have mentioned here.
133 £ayb thanks Dr. Omidsalar (Um ds l r) for presenting important points about the subject to him. 134 I have not seen Rustamji’s work myself, though it has been written in the title of his book that he has used the Persian [Zoroastrian] Ard y-V r f N ma version: Rustamji, Sorabji 1868: Ardaiviranamu (Gujrati rendering of the Persian translation of original Pahlavi text), Bombay 1844; 2nd ed. 1868 Gignoux, 1984: 31.

V. Manuscripts
The Iranians were defeated by the Arab Muslims in the year 20 A.Y. (Yazdgird )/ 651 A.D., which led to Arab dominance upon Iran. The Muslim rulers’ pressure on those Iranians who had not converted to Islam and were adherents of their ancestors’ religion Zoroastrianism was increasing more and more. Finally, due to these pressures some of the Iranian Zoroastrians had to escape to India in order to be able to retain the religion of their forefathers (Choksy 1997: 110-137). These Zoroastrians, who nowadays are known as Parsis, have since then lived from generation to generation in India. There was no connection between the Parsis and the Iranian Zoroastrians until the year 846 A.Y./1477 A.D., and the Iranian Zoroastrians were not even aware of the Parsis in India. The Parsis, who knew about their origin, sent a messenger named Nar m n H šang to Iran in the year 847 A.Y./1478 A.D. His duty was to find out more about the religion in order to provide solutions for existing religious conflicts among the Parsis and to study the correct performance of the religious rites (Hodivala 1920: 243-245). After that time, twenty-six messengers were sent by the Parsis to Iran until the year 1142/1773.135 Each one of these messengers carried back letters to India, where answers to religious queries, explanations of different rites and ceremonies, the calendar, and the Zoroastrians mythology etc. can be found. Besides these letters, the Iranian Zoroastrians sent some other original books, copies and treatises on the religion to the Parsis. These letters and other works were known as Riv yat and are composed in Avestan, Parsig, Zoroastrian Persian and Pazand. These Riv yats are known by the name of the messenger who carried them to India (ibid.: 343-345). The sixth messenger of the Parsis, Shapur s , returned from Iran to India in 896/1527. He carried back a letter and also several other important Zoroastrian works in Parsig, Pazand and Zoroastrian Persian, which had been re-written for him as a miscellany in the same year in Yazd. One of these works is the Zoroastrian Persian version of the Ard y-V r f N ma in prose (ibid.: 297-298).
135 Patel has recorded the number of these messengers to 22 in his list (Patel 1900: 170-182). However, their number is 26, as recorded by Hodivala, West (1896-1904: II. 125-127), Vitalone (1996: 1-21) and some other researchers.



72
Several manuscripts of Shapur s ’s full miscellany were copied during the centuries. Some other manuscripts contain only parts of this miscellany, such as the Ard y-V r f N ma. These manuscripts are found in different libraries in India and Europe. Several of the Ard y-V r f N ma manuscripts that are mentioned either in scholarly works or in library catalogues have been lost or ruined, and there are no traces of them now. However, all known manuscripts of the Ard yV r f N ma will be presented in this thesis, both those that have been used for the edition of the text in this thesis and those to which it was impossible to get access. The manuscripts are listed in chronological order according to their colophon. The three final manuscripts (M, BC2, L) lack dating and are therefore placed after the others. Every manuscript is here given a code, e.g., N, O, NH, that indicates where it is located or by whom it has been mentioned. If there is another code in brackets for the manuscript [e.g. T.30], this refers to the code in square the catalogue of the library where it is kept, or to the code found in research related to that manuscript. In order of their antiquity the manuscripts are as follows: N = Navsari, Dastur Meherji Rana Library, [T.30], 896 A.Y./1527 A.D. O = Oxford, Bodleian Library, [Bodl.Or.719], 896 A.Y./1527 A.D.136 NH = Navsari, Dastur Meherji Rana Library, in Hodivala’s study, 901 A.Y./1532 A.D. U = Belonging to E.M.R. Unv l , [M], 927+928 A.Y./1558+1559 A.D. K = Belonging to Kaikhusro J. Jamasp Asa, 954 A.Y./1585 A.D. P = Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, [S.P.47], 954 A.Y./1585 A.D. B = Bombay, Mulla Firuz Library, [105(352)], 1040 A.Y./1671 A.D. BC = Bombay, Cama Oriental Institute, [R.III.65], 104-[?] A.Y./167-[?] A.D.

M = München, Staatsbibliothek, [Zend 73‘H28’], No date BC2 = Bombay, Cama Oriental Institute, [R.III.102], No date L = London, British Museum Library, [No.830], No date
In the following presentation of the various manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma, two manuscripts will be more specifically presented than the others because of their greater importance. The first one is manuscript N, which is found in Shapur s ’s miscellany, and which seems to be the most ancient manuscript available of the Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrian Persian. The other one is manuscript L, which, for the reason of its style and language, seems to be the last manuscript of the work even though it is not dated. For that reason, a special presentation of manuscripts N and L is given here be

low. Contents and other details of these manuscripts are also presented in the full presentation of all manuscripts.
Manuscript N
The miscellany that Shapur s brought with himself from Iran is known by various names: Rev yat of Š pur s (Vitalone 1987: 9-10), Kama As ’s Revayet (Katrak 1941: 209-210), Rev yat of K m Bohr or Rev yat of K m Vohr (Hodivala 1920: 296), Riv yat of R m Khamb yat (HaugWest 1872: xix), Kay m-Aldyn Khamb yty (Rehatsek 1873: 178-179) and Revayat of Kama Asa Khambayeti (Dhabhar 1923‘c’: 118-120).137 This version, to which the code N has been applied here, is nowadays preserved with the code [T.30], in Meherji Rana’s Library. The scribes of this miscellany have recorded the date 896 A.Y. /1527A.D. as the finishing date of their re-writing in three places, in Pazand (Avestan characters) on folios 106b and 150a, and in Persian characters on folio 148b. Unfortunately, there is no indication of the original manuscript from which N was copied or of its date of completion. The probability of the existence of a manuscript that could have been the basis for N still preserved in Iran is very small, next to impossible. According to Chardin, King ᤱAbb s I (15811629) forced the Zoroastrians to bring the book on the Prophecies of Abraham about the End of the World to him. The Zoroastrians brought him several of their books. However, since the king still did not find this imaginary book by Abraham the prophet, he ordered the execution of the Dast r n-i dast r (the highest Zoroastrian authority) and some other religious persons (Chardin 1735: II.179 Boyce 1987: 181). Coincident to this event, one of the dast rs of Kirm n sought refuge from Balkh to Kirm n. Hearing about the gathering of the Zoroastrian books by order of the King ᤱAbb s I and about the killing of Dast r n-i dast r and two m bads, in fear he concealed 300 volumes of his books in a wall and covered the wall with mud. When Dast r Kay-Khusrau Kirm n destroyed the wall in the year 1257 A.Y./1888 A.D., he found that all the books except a small number had perished (Šahmard n 1984: 269). The Iranian Zoroastrians sent many of their valuable manuscripts to the Parsis (ibid: 268), which can be seen as a natural reaction to pressure of the kind described above. Thus, it is likely that the original manuscript of the Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrian Persian, on which Shapur s ’s version may have been based, is lost forever.
137 Shapur s ’s version is known as Khamb yat , because Shapur s himself was an inhabitant of Cambay (Dhabhar 1909: xix) and one of the narrators was a native of Cambay as well (Katrak 1941: 209).

If the scribes of the miscellany of Shapur s had mentioned the date of the original manuscript, it would maybe have been possible to find out more about the translation date of the Zoroastrian Persian version of the Ard yV r f N ma and other Zoroastrian Persian works, but unfortunately, there is no information available to reveal when the Zoroastrians began to make use of Zoroastrian Persian for translating and writing their works. In this regard, Molé believes that the Zoroastrians finally decided to use the Persian language at a time which is not totally clear, but at least it should have happened before the Mongolian invasion of Iran (611 A.H./1214 A.D.), because the language is different from that of the Persian Muslims and contains a large number of Parsig words (Molé 1965: 36-37). Although there is no information available about the time when the Ard y-V r f N ma was translated into Persian, the style of writing, the vocabulary and the grammatical structure of the text can reveal the approximate but not accurate date of the text. Since there are no adequate historical documents available to determine the approximate compilation time of the text, we have to judge this on the basis of prose linguistic standards (Um ds l r 2006: 8). Muᤱ n states that the style of writing is to some extent similar to the epistolary style of the fourth or fifth centuries A.H./tenth or eleventh centuries A.D. (Muᤱ n 1946: 57).138 Some of the characteristics of the prose texts from the tenth or eleventh centuries A.D. are the abridgement of prefaces, usually limited to a number of short sentences, infrequent use of Arabic words, the non-existence or a limited extent of Islamic influence on the texts, a simple language free from rhyme and literary eloquence, use of ancient Persian words139 and specific grammatical points (Bah r, M.T. 1991: 2.54-61; Khat b 1996: 2.124-134).140 The above-mentioned points are clearly found in the Ard y-V r f N ma text. These characteristics indicate that the Ard yV r f N ma was translated during the tenth or eleventh centuries A.D. and not later than that. It should not be forgotten that manuscript N, is a re-written text which was copied in the year 896 A.Y./1527 A.D., and it is not known to what extent this fact contributed to changes in the present text in relation to its origin. Some examples of changes are obviously presented in some ortho
138 It is noteworthy that Muᤱ n’s judgement is based on the introduction of the manuscript M (H28), which was written about 300 years ago, near the end of the seventeenth century (HaugWest 1872: xv). However, about 150 years of interval is not the only difference between the manuscripts M and N. Important changes in the language must have occurred during this time, which are clearly visible in grammatical, stylisitc and lexical changes in the latter manuscript. 139 To find a complete list of words in use in Persian texts from the fourth century A.H./tenth century A.D., some of which also occur in the Ard y-V r f N ma, refer to the studies of Mu ammad Taq Bah r (1991: 1.208-221) and Muᤱ n (1955: 342-390). 140 Refer to Um ds l r’s research (2006: 9-12) about grammatical rules in Zoroastrian Persian works composed before the sixth century A.H./twelfth century A.D.

graphic rules of the text. In this manuscript, the preverb bi- is sometimes separated from the verb and written «ဂ », e.g. in «ခ ဂ » bi-karda (142b) and « ထဆÙဂ » bi-g y (143b). In the same manner, the negating particle na- is sometimes written separated from the verb «ဂÇ», e.g. as in « Ç ဂ ထဂÇ» nayašta-and (141a) and « ကက ဂÇ» na-kunand (148a). These spellings were used before the sixth century A.H./twelveth century A.D. (Um ds l r 2006: 1011). The letter «^» is occasionally written for the kasra-yi iᡂ fa, in manuscript N as well: «^ÚဒÛ» z instead of «`ÚဒÛ» z-i (139b) and « ဃ Üထ Á» j yg h instead of ခ Üထ Á»
«` j yg h-i (145b). This spelling is one of the characteristics of works written during Firdaus ’s time, the fourth century A.H./tenth century A.D. and one or two centuries afterwards (Qar b 1996: 367). Frequent use of connectives like «စ» va “and” is another indication for the antiquity of the text and the translator’s faithfulness to the original Parsig text.141 This means that at that time, the translation of Parsig works was still done mechanically and that New Persian rules for the connective va were not applied in translation. These stylistically unmotivated connectives are omitted in the other manuscripts, among them manuscript M (H28), which has changed the style of the text to some extent. These writing rules are evidence indicating that the text of the Zoroastrian Persian version of the Ard y-V r f N ma belongs to the tenth or eleventh century A.D. These rules are, however, observed just in some cases in manuscript N rewritten for Sh p r Asa in 896 A.Y./1527 A.D. The reason for the variety of rules in this manuscript is obviously that this text was re-written at a time when there were no traces of the rules left in Zoroastrian Persian works written later. An example of this is an Iranian Zoroastrian’s letter written in the year 928 A.Y./1559 A.D., that is 32 years after Sh p r Asa’s version was re-written. This letter (S.P.46: 17a-18a), contrary to the Zoroastrian Persian version of the Ard y-V r f N ma, both has a long introduction and contains a considerable amount of Islamic influence. There are many Arabic words in it, the style is both elegant and rhyming, and ancient Persian words are few here. There are likewise no traces of old orthographic conventions for bi-, na- and the kasra-yi iᡂ fa, and there is no superfluous use of va.
Manuscript N includes two tables of contents, of which the first one (fol. 01, 06-09)142 looks very old and decayed in the microfilm. The title of the collection is given at the top of the list as: 143« Ç ထ ¥ထ စ ¥Ð င » fihrist-i riv yat-i r n (Table of Contents of the Iranian Narrative). This table is not complete. It seems that the table is the original one, but just as the margin of this remaining part of the list is decayed and torn, the rest is ruined as well.
141 Bah r finds that the conjunction va « » is in use abundantly in Pahlavi (Parsig) manuscripts, but when it is necessary it is sometimes missing in the texts. (Bah r 1990: 17). 142 There are no traces of folio numbers in any of the tables of contents of manuscript N. 143 Originally « » firist.



76
The second table (fol. 1b-4a) is written in a handwriting different from the first table and the other works in the manuscript. The title of the collection is here144« ထ ¤É Ð| 1⁄4ထ င ခ စ| ¥ Ç ထ ¥ထ စ ¥Ð င » Fihrist-i riv yat-i r n b bat varda bihd n K m s Kumb yt (Table of Contents of the Iranian Narrative Brought by the Righteous K m s Komb yt ). Since this list was written and added to the collection later, it is a complete table of contents for the whole collection.
Manuscript L
There is also a manuscript in the British museum library (formerly India Office Library, with (No.803) of the prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrian Persian. Manuscript L, like all manuscripts, has its defects and advantages. Firstly, some words are written by mistake. It is interesting that these mistakes originate both in the copying of the text (in writing) and in hearing when someone reads the text and the copyist writes it down. Mistakes due to hearing the text may be, among others, «@ 1⁄2ထ » st dan for « Ç 1⁄2ထ » st dand, « က ÝÙ» guftand for «Ä ÝÙ» guftam, « Ç ဒÐ Ò» purs dand for «? ဒÐ Ò» purs dam, and « ကÝÐ » isfand rmarz for «Þ ကÝÐ » isfand rma . Among mistakes due to read/written copying, are « Ç Ä Û» ašm-and for « | Ä Û» ašm mad, « စ Ç Éဃ» ham n r z for « စ Éဃ» ham z r, « Ç Õဒ Ç» n z m kardand for « Ç ထ Üဒ » b z m gard dand and « ¤3⁄4 စ ÜÇ » zang va ᜸abaš for ÜÇ » « 1⁄2ကÁ စ rang va jins as well. Furthermore, some sentences are in a complete disorder, for example in folios 6a, 11b, 13a and 18b. The most important characteristic of this manuscript is that it is concise, and whenever something appears important to the scribe, he just records that and avoids more explanations about the matter. Therefore omissions are frequent in L. Maybe these omissions and mistakes were already there in the mother manuscript. Of course, the abridgement of the text, as it had been said earlier, is a defect of this manuscript. To abbreviate a text may not be in agreement with the responsibility of the scribe and may cause misunderstandings, but abbreviating a text could also be an advantage, since in some cases it may diminish complications in the text. Therefore, the abridgement of the text can be seen as one of the positive aspects of manuscript L as well. It must be emphasized at this point that although the rule of ‘lectio brevior praeferenda est’ or ‘brevior lectio potior’ (the abridged form is more acceptable) (Epp-Fee 1993: 14-15) is applicable in many cases, this principle is unacceptable as regards manuscript L. The version of the Ard y-V r f N ma in manuscript L is not abridged in the meaning of its being more authentic
144 Originally « » Fihrist-i riv yat-i r n b bat varda bihd n K m s s Kuhanb yt .



77
and devoid of the later additions. The abridgements here consist of eliminated sentences that the scribe found unnecessary. Meanwhile, manuscript L also has a newer language style in addition to the abridgements. Hence, some of the ancient words have either been deleted or changed into more modern synonyms. There are several precendent examples of reducing explanations in a text and representing it in an abridged form in Zoroastiran Persian’s literature. For example, in addition to several translated texts of the Min -xirad in Zoroastrian Persian either versified or prose, there is an abridged version called the Min -xirad, riv yat-i d gar, which is about one quarter of the original text (M52.‘Haug7’: 71a-78b). In addition to this, there are many examples of abridgements in Classical New Persian literature, the most famous being abridged versions of the Baxtiy r N ma, the D r b N ma and the Ab Muslim N ma.
Another great advantage or even the most important advantage of the Manuscript L is its episodes. This is the only manuscript of the Ard y-V r f N ma that is divided into several episodes, and the scribe has chosen a suitable heading related to the main subject of each episode. The headings are written in coloured ink at the beginning of each episode. The epithet An š rv n [An sa-Rav n] is another notable characteristic of manuscript L in the second heading of the text: ᕦËà စ ဂ Ç * ထစ @ Ð á|» «@ စ ဒ ဆÇ @ Õ ဒ ခ z-i d st n-i V r f-N ma va qi᠀᠀a-yi š hArdaš r-i B bak n-i An š rv n (The Beginnig of story of the Ard y-V r f N ma and the tale of king Ardaš r-i B bak n-i An š rv n). Since An š rv n [An sa-rav n]145 is an epithet of Xusrau I (531-579), one of the Sasanid kings, it has been supposed that wherever the epithet an š rv n has been used, the intention is this very Xusrau I, whereas an š rv n in the meaning of ‘deceased’146 is an epithet also used for Ardaš r-i B bak n. But since Ardaš r has not been mentioned anywhere as Ardaš r-i B bak n-i An š rv n in historical documents, nobody has paid enough attention to the matter that an š rv n sometimes may refer to Ardaš r-i B bak n. For example, Ibn-i Nad m in his famous book, Al-Fihrist, has mentioned two books about adventures and stories of Iranian kings, and both the books have an širv n in the titles. The first one is «@ စ ဆÇ ခ ဒÐ â Ç Õo » Kit b ul-k rn maj f s rat-i An širv n and the other one «@ စ ဆÇ » Kit b-i
145 Variants of An š rv n are An širv n and An sa-rav n.
146 “Middle Persian An ̈shagruw n- in New Persian [A]n ̈sharuw n (with the usual - r from agr, as in NP. d r, “late”, from MP. dagr) or, by popular etymology, [A]n ̈sh n-ruw n, “whose soul is sweet”– means literally “whose soul is immortal”, but it is commonly used in Middle Persian as a euphemism for “deceased”. It is thus likely that the epithet was not applied to Khusr ̈y I until after his death (c.f. Chr. Bartholomae, Zur Kenntnis der mitteliranischen Mundarten III, Heidelberg 1920 p. 9 n. 2). However, it is frequently used as a name for Khusr ̈y I both in Middle Persian and Arabic texts” (de Blois 1990: 96). Anauširv n / Anauš rv n or Anauša-rav n (Parsig: an ̈šagruw n) means the late, deceased (MacKenzie 1990: 10).



78
An širv n (Ibn-i Nad m 1871: 305). The first title must be the same the K rn mag ardaš r p bag n. The word an širv n in this title has been assumed to be a mistake due to carelessness of the scribes re-writing Ardaš r as An širv n (Mu9ammad 1995: 173; Mu9ammad 2001: 221), but that seems rather unlikely and the more likely explanation is that this epithet is here applied to Ardaš r. Tafa╲╲ul believes that perhaps these two books were one and the same, and that the second title is an abbreviation of the first one (Tafa╲╲ul 1997: 222). Anyway, the adjective An š rv n added to the title of the first book which Ibn-i Nad m has mentioned strengthens the argument for the correctness of Ardaš r-i B bak n-i An š rv n. Manuscript L is the only place where the name is found as Ardaš r-i B bak n-i An š rv n (An ša-rav n). This is another point worth noting in this manuscript. The abbreviated character of the text of manuscript L makes it less useful as a basis for correcting and editing the text. Here manuscript L was used together with the other manuscripts in the first steps of the editing, but since it turned out to be an unreasonable amount of instances where asterisks (*) and footnotes would have to be added for omissions in manuscript L, this manuscript was later considered less useful for editing the text. The fate of a possible original manuscript from which manuscript L has been copied is unknown. Maybe all the existing changes in manuscript L originate from such a mother manuscript. It is also possible that all these changes are innovations by the scribe of L and that this manuscript should be regarded as a new and last version of the Zoroastrian Persian Ard y-V r f N ma.

Description: “Half-bound in strong covers; ff. 102 marked in Arabic [correctly: English] as well as Gujarati numerals (of which f. 78b and f. 102 are blank), written generally 17Il. to page, + ff. 103 to 257 marked in Gujarati numerals (of which f. 133b and f. 146b are blank; f. 168 is marked twice; f. 188a is blank; f. 197 left unmarked, although there is no gap in the writing; f. 208 marked twice and the folio aftr 227 is wrogly marked f. 248, etc. up to end), generally written 25Il. to page. 8".5x6".2.” (Dhabhar 1923‘c’: 120). Manuscript N (T.30) is written in a relatively fine nastaᤱl q until folio 138b, but from folios 139a to 232 the text is in a rather bad nastaᤱl q, and thereafter it is written in a handwriting different from that in folios 233a to 242a. The folios of this manuscript are numbered in both Gujarati and English, but the Gujarati numbers cannot be seen clearly in the microfilm. Furthermore, some numbers have disappeared, since the margin of the folios is putrefied. Both the Gujarati and English numberings are written on the verso side of the folios, in the right corner, not on the recto side. However, this type of numbering is not specific for only this manuscript. There is a Yasna manuscript in the Carolina Rediviva Library in Uppsala (MS. Onova 741), where the number of the folios is written on the verso side of the page as well. Orthography: The Persian letter « » p is sometimes written as « » b and occasionally as « » p; the letter « » as « » j and « » ; the letter « » ž often as « » ž but sometimes as « » z; and the letter «=» g sometimes as «<» k and occasionally as «=» g. The vowel «|» is sometimes written as « » a and sometimes as «|» . There is no consistent rule for the writing of compound words. For example, «¥Ð 1⁄4Â» tan-durust is written as two detached words and «? ÜÕထ» yakg m is written in an adjoined word. The preposition «ဂ » ba is sometimes detached as in « 1⁄2 ဂ » ba bastar, but it is sometimes adjoined as in « ဃ × » ba-p dš h . The demonstratives n and n are sometimes written separately «@ ငÁ @|» n jah n, sometimes attached to the noun «@ ငíÇ » bid n-jah n is written in an adjoined form. The letter «}ဃ» h is normally omitted in plural forms both when it represents h as in «ခစ Ù» gur h and the short vowel a as in «ဂ » karfa. They are



82
written « ဃစ Ù» gur h-h and « င » karfa-h in their plural form. Occasionally the «}ဃ» h is found also in the plural, e.g. « ငဃစ Ç » and h-h . The Arabic plural nouns are again pluralized in some cases: « ငo ဆ3⁄4 » a᜸v l-h .
The « » hamza/reduced y at the end of some words is used for the kasrayi iᡂ fa, e.g. in «î ကÇ » m nanda-yi, « င » karfa-h -yi, and occasionally as the second person singular verb ending - , as in «î ငÇ» nah da-yi (= -ခ ငÇ» «^ ). However, this ending - is also written «^ » in some cases, as in -ခ ÕÇ» «^ nakarda-y .
The third person plural copula « Ç » -and is sometimes written adjoined as in « ကÇ » mardum n-and, but is sometimes found detached as in « Ç ?ဆà» qaum-and.
The « `ïo » alif of the third person singular copula «¥Ð » ast is missing in some instances, e.g. «¥1⁄2 Ð » r st-ast, «¥1⁄2ÕဒÇ» n k-ast, «¥1⁄2ဃ Üထ Á» jayg hast and so on. To form the compounds of the preposition « » az with the pronouns like as «@ ထ » š n, «စ » , «1⁄4ထ » n, and so on, the « `ïo » alif of the pronoun is omitted as in «@ ထ » az š n, «စ » az , «1⁄4ထ » az n. Short vowels and tašd d are not written. Note: The microfilm that I have of manuscript N (T.30) contains the old and new lists of contents (01-4a), plus the second part of the manuscript, namely the works written in Zoroastrian Persian. Contents of the first part of the manuscript which is written in Pazand, has been re-written here from Dhabhar’s catalogue (1923‘c’: 118-119).149

Scribe. Not named. Description. 25.8x10.3cm., 29 folios, 13 lines, fine nasta‘l q, a few names are written in coloured ink, the folios are not numbered. However, there is a Latin number on every fifth folio on the recto side of the folio (5, 10, 15 etc.). Orthography. The orthography of manuscript O is mainly like manuscript N, but with small differences. The letter « » p is often written as « » b and occasionally as « » p; the letter « » as « » j and occasionally as « » ; the letter « » ž often as « » ž but sometimes as « » z; and the letter «=» g is written as «<» k. «|» sometimes written as « » a and sometimes as «|» . Vowels and tašd d are not written. The preposition «ဂ » ba is sometimes adjoined as in «^ စ » ba-r z , but it is sometimes detached as in « ငဃ Õထ Á ဂ » ba j yg h-h . Some words are found in two forms. For example «1⁄4 !စ » gar ᠐ mn and «@ ÉÂစ » gar tm n, «@ » zaf n and «@ » zab n. Note: Manuscript O is copied word by word from the manuscript N, and almost all the mistakes in O are entirely the same as in N. Even their colophons, that is 896 A.Y./1527 A.D., are the same. Thus, manuscript O was probably not necessary for the text editing process. However, since some words are not clearly readable due to the paper putrefying or to the quality of the microfilm, manuscript O was useful to supply unclear words in some cases.150
NH = NAVSARI, DASTUR MEHERJI RANA (901 A.Y.)
Cat. Hodivala, Sh.H.H.: Studies in Parsi History, pp. 301-302. The manuscript NH is mentioned in Hodivala’s study Studies in Parsi History. Thus, it is marked with the code NH here. Manuscript NH has been copied from the manuscript N in 901 A.Y./1532 A.D. Hodivala is the only one who has mentioned this manuscript. The single specification of this manuscript which Hodivala gives is that it contains both the Ard y-V r f N ma and a section called Pursiš u p sux. He states that the manuscript was kept in Meherji Rana Library in Navsari at that time, but he gives no number or code of it (Hodivala 1920: 301-302). However, there is no such manuscript in the Meherji Rana Library Catalogue, which was written by Dhabhar in 1923, so it seems that it must have been lost.

Dhabhar and is marked by the code M. Dhabhar writes that this manuscript belongs to Ervad Maneckji Rustamji Unv l , and it was copied word by word from Shapur s ’s manuscript in 927 A.Y./1558 A.D. in Navsari. He adds that the colophon date for the Ard y-V r f N ma, which is part of this manuscript, is 928 A.Y./1559 A.D. This manuscript has 191 folios of 23 lines each, but since the last folio is missing, the scribe’s name is unknown (Dhabhar 1909: xx). This is all the available information about this manuscript. There is no trace of it nowadays, because it is not known to whom Rustamji Unv l gave his library or what he did with this manuscript.
K = BELONGING TO KAIKHUSRO J. JAMASP ASA (954 A.Y.)
Cat. Dhabhar, E.B.N.: យaddar Na᠒r and យaddar Bundehesh, p. xxi.
Manuscript K is one of the other manuscripts that were used by Dhabhar to edit យaddar Na᠒r and យaddar Bundehesh. This manuscript belonged to Dastur Kaikhusro Jamaspji Jamasp Asa. According to Dhabhar, this manuscript has strong resemblance to the Yazd manuscript (Shapur s ’s manuscript) and was rewritten by Ervad Behram b. Kekob d b. Hamajy r b. Padam b. K m in Navsari in the year 954A.Y./1585 A.D. This manuscript consists of 106 folios but is lacking several folios (Dhabhar 1909: xxi). The fate of this manuscript is also unknown.

154 Ithoter is a Gujarati word which means 78 questions. The Ithoter was the last letter written to the Parsis by the Iranian Zoroastrians, and sent to them in the year 1142 A.Y./1773 A.D. The text body of this letter was edited and published by Vitalone in 1996.

Some words are written in colour. In some cases, the second person singular copula in the perfect verb form is written with both «î» and «^ ». For example «^ ခ ဒÐ » ras da-y is written «^ î ဒÐ ». The prefix «ဂ » is mostly written separately. «î» is sometimes used for kasra-yi iᡂ fa, for example «@| ôÏ1⁄2Ç» nusxa-yi n.
Two dots are sometimes put under «^» in the combination « õ». The sign «}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}ጡጡ» is found at the beginning of almost every episode of manuscript N2. The sign «.ù», is also put at the end of many episodes. Furthermore, there is a blank space of the size of a word or even more to indicate either the end or the beginning of an episode. However, this does not apply for all episodes. Another feature of this manuscript is to give the correct form of some words that are not written correctly in manuscript N. For example, the word « က စ ခ ဒ Ò» patiy ra- mand is written « က စ ခ ဒÇ» nay ra- mand the first time it occurs in manuscript N, but it is written correctly in manuscript N2. Note: According to Dhabhar’s catalogue (1923‘c’: 25-26) manuscript F.44, contains two works: the Ithoter and the Ard y V r f N ma (113-63 pages). But in my microfilm of this manuscript there is only the Ard y V r f N ma, which has now been numbered from page 1 (not folio) ending on page 63. The manuscript N2 is a copy of the manuscript B (= Bombay 105(352)).

158 The transcription of names in Dhabhar’s list of contents is retained. 159 It is not known on the basis of which mother manuscript the manuscript BC was copied. Part of its colophon has disappeared (104-). 160 The Mulla Firuz Library and the Oriental Institute Library are, in fact, the same library. 161 This manuscript is registered as manuscript 830 (MS.830) in the India Office library Catalogue. The numbering of the folios is from 1 to 50. But in the same catalogue, there is another manuscript with the same number in column 1520, namely the យad dar. The numbering of the folios of the យad dar begins from 51 to 155, that is, exactly following the folios of the Ard yV r f N ma. This indicates that both these manuscripts may have been the same at first, and that they were probably separated into two parts while being catalogued.

ÄÂ ÄÂ ÄÂ ÄÂ ÄÂ ÄÂ ¥ ထ ? íÇ 2. 51b-1551. ┩ad dar. Date. Not given. Scribe. Not named. Description. 20x12.5cm., 155 folios, 11 lines to the page. The text is written in fine nasta‘l q, however sometimes the letter «@» n at the end of the words is not attached to the rest of the word. Besides, some words are written in nastaሁl q-i šikasta (broken nastaᤱl q), headings are written in coloured ink, and the folios are not numbered. However, there is a Latin number on every fifth folio on the recto side of the folio (5, 10, 15 etc.). Orthography. «|» is normally written « » but sometimes «|». « » is generally written « » but in some cases « »; « » is usually written « » but in some cases « » e.g. « ငÛ»; « » is always written « ». Two dots are sometimes put under «^» in the combination « õ». Kasra-i iᡂ fa is sometimes written «^» and in some cases « ». ᡁamma is often written, especially on « » a and « » b, e.g. စ{ »
« and ဆ{ »
« b d.
Prefix « » m - is sometimes separated but in some cases joined to the next word. The letter «ခ» representing a short -a at the end of a word is mostly omitted before the plural ending, e.g. « ဃ ဂ Á» j ma-h has been written « င Á». The «ïo » of «¥Ð » ast is mostly omitted, e.g. «¥Ð *စ » maሁr f ast is written «¥1⁄2 စ ». Some words are found in two forms, e.g: «>ဆÒ» and «ñÒ» for pul ‘bridge’; and one in three forms: « စ Ç ¤ » šab nr z, « စ @ ¤ » šab n-r z and ဂÇ ¤ » « စ šab na-r z.
The dots have not put in correctly in certain cases and at times some words have too many or too few dots, e. g: «ခ Üထ Á» j yg h has been written as «ခ ÜÇ Á» j ng h and «1⁄4 Úထ» jazašn as «1⁄4 Ò» parašn. Some nouns and pronouns have two different forms, e. g: «@ ထ » and «@ စ », «? Ý1⁄2ဃ » and «? ×1⁄2ဃ ». Some words are recorded incorrectly, e.g. « ÚÙ» guz riš for « ÞÙ» gu riš, « ဆÛ» p, «ဂÒ Ù» garm pa and « ÚÍ» ᤱaz b. Some words are written in an unusual form, e.g. « စ » d žax.162
Special characteristics of the texts
Due to the words it contains, many of which are compounds and old verbs, and due to the variation in grammatical structures the Zoroastrian Persian version of the Ard y-V r f N ma, belongs to the most important and oldest New Persian texts. The following examples of words, verbs and grammatical

structures indicate that the text was written in the fourth or fifth A.H./tenth or eleventh A.D. centuries. The examples below have been selected from manuscript N, which is the basic manuscript, and the number of the folios refers to this manuscript.
Old Zoroastrian Persian words and compounds found in the text are: «@စ ထ » d n (139a), ¥É{ဃ»
« humat, «¥ ဆဃ» h xt, ¥ _ဆ{ဃ»
« h varšt, «¥Ð ဒÂ» t rast (139b), « Üထ Ð» sid gar, «ခ Ð ýဒÂ» t -i ustura (140a), «ဂထ Ò Ð» sitr-p ya, «ခ Ç ဃ » š h nš h (140b), «¥Ðစ 1⁄4ထ » d n-d st, «@ ဆ » ašv n, «1⁄4 Ò» p d šn, «ဂÔထစ|» v a, «@ Çစ » durvand n (141b), «@ Ü ထ » fir štag n (142a),« Ú ^ Ò» p y-muzd (142b),«ဂÇ ဃ ×Ð » isp h na, «?

Old verbs encountered are:
«@ Ù» gir m -kardan, «@ စ |» riz -d dan, «@ ဆ » rišvatkardan, «@ ဆ @ Ù » dar-gardan-b dan (142b),«@ > » dil-b z-d dan, «@ ဆ ÏÂ» tuxš -b dan (143a), @ | `Ù»
« gird-bar- madan, «1⁄4 ÞÙ » b z-guzaštan, «@ ဂÌထစ» v la-kardan (145a), «1⁄4 ÑÇ » b ng-d štan, «1⁄4 ÞÙ ÞÍ» ሁaz b-guz štan (146a), «1⁄4 Â |» b-t xtan, «1⁄4 Ïထစ| » darv xtan, «@ ငÇ ဂíကÕ » šikanja-bar-nah dan (146b), «@ ÇÚÙ» gazandkardan, «@ စ| @ ထ ဂ » ba-ziy n- vardan, «@ ဂÇ ဂ ^ဆ » m y ba š nakardan (147b), «@ င » bar šahr šudan, «1⁄4 ထ » fariy d-d štan (148a), «@ ထ » az y d b z-kardan, «1⁄4 ¥Ð » dast b zmad štan (148b).
The structure of the following sentences is particularly interesting:
« ဆ ခ ဒÇ ဒÒ ခ ကÙ þဒဃ @ ထ » bar š n h gun h payd nay mada b d (139a), «@ ဃ ဆ Á @ ÚဒÇ » az bar dar n zm n jud xw h kardan (139b), «1⁄4 Ù ¥1⁄2ထ စ 1⁄4 1⁄2Ç ဆÂ ÉÇ Á@| Ä Û ? ကÕ Ä Û ဂ Ç ဃ ÈÇ ကÛ» in nk har and m ki ašm bar-m -afkandam, ašm az n-j nam -tav nistan va š yist giriftan (140a), «?

Among the verb forms, the past tense with the suffixed - can be observed in its ordinary usages of indicating unrealized counterfactual actions or habitual actions in the past. It also occasionally occurs in manuscript N for single actions, like the simple past tense, as in the following three examples: «^ ÉÇ စ ^ ဒ » biy mad va mar nam z burd (line 101),

« ÝÙ စ ^ ?ဠÐ» sal m kard va guft (line 102),
« ÝÙ စ Ü 1⁄4 ¥Ð » dast-i man bi-girift va guft (line 108).163
There are a few passages in which b occurs where one would have expected ba “to” as in the following examples: «? စ| Õထ Æ Í » iሁtiq d b yak varam (line 11), «? >ဆÒ ÀÇ Á @| @ဆÛ» n b n j nib-i p l šudam (line 169),

The method used in the editing of the text
The editing of the text is based on a critical method. The present text has been edited on the basis of manuscript N. This text has been compared with manuscripts P, N2 and M, and the different readings are mentioned in footnotes. Since manuscript O is a copy from manuscript N and even has the same date in the colophon, it has been used just for reading doubtful words. Manuscript L was used for a specific purpose. All the headings of the episodes are written according to that manuscript, since it is the only manuscript that has a division into episodes with headings. In addition to this, manuscript L in addition to the other ones was frequently referred to for the reading of some badly written words and other uncertain readings. However the critical method was not employed mechanically. Some scribes confirm that they had directly or indirectly copied their manuscript from manuscript N. It seems, though, as if all manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma have been copied from manuscript N, except manuscript L, something which was explained separately. The reason for this is that all the other manuscripts have a number of mistakes already found in manuscript N. Moreover, there are blank spaces in manuscript N, some of which are found in the same place in all these manuscripts, too. If all the wrong words of the text were the same in all manuscripts and all blank spaces were exactly the same, it would be unnecessary to use the other manuscripts to edit the text. Since, according to the rule ‘eliminatio codicum descriptorum’ (elimination of derivative manuscripts) (Timpanaro 2005: 47), i.e. if one is sure that one or several manuscripts have been copied from an original manuscript, the edition should just rely on that original one. The copied manuscripts are of

95
no extra value. However, this is not true in this case, since all the manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma are not exactly the same word for word. However, even if we could be certain that all later manuscripts have been copied from manuscript N, it will be possible to find more original forms of words in other manuscripts as well. This might be due to the knowledge of the scribe who sometimes emendates a word while copying the text, and thus is not merely making a copy from the original manuscript. Additionally, perhaps the scribe had already copied the same manuscript from a better and more correct manuscript earlier and was therefore aware of defects and mistakes in the present manuscript which he decided to correct (Um ds l r 2005-2006: 192-193). For these reasons, use has been made of all the available manuscripts to edit the text. When there were two or more variants for a single word or term, according to ‘difficilior lectio potior’ (the most difficult alternative is the most correct) (Beal 2008: 120), the most difficult alternative was selected and given in the text body, and the other variants were moved to a footnote. For example, the word «ဂ Ïထ ငÒ» pahr xta is more difficult than the word «ဂ Ïဒဃ Ò» parh xta, thus given in the text body. Yet, not every word is selected just because it is the most difficult alternative. For example, there is a word in manuscript N, which is recorded as « က စ ခ ဒÇ» nay da- mand the first time it occurs (140a). The correct form of the word is « က စ ခ ဒ Ò» patiy ra- mand which is written in manuscript N2 and in the very manuscript N the second time it occurs (140b). On the other hand, in spite of the antiquity of manuscript N, some words and terms found there are not the original and ancient ones. In this instance, following the rule ‘utrum in alterum abiturum erat?’ (What has been changed into what else?) (Beal 2008: 427), the more ancient variant is selected in the text body. For example, the word «[? ðÙ] ? ð » každum [gaždum] is found in the four manuscripts NN2MO, but this very same word is recorded as «Äဃ ðÙ» gažduhm in manuscript P. This latter form was given in the text. Some words are found in both an ancient and more recent form in manuscript N or in the other manuscripts. For example, the words « က×ÐဆÙ» g spand and « ကÝÐဆÙ» g sfand, « ကÐ ဆ » x rsand and « ကÐ » xwarsand, «@ » zaf n and «@ » zab n, «>ဆÒ» p l and «ñÒ» pul. In these cases, the ancient variants of the words are chosen for the text, and the more recent variants have been changed into the ancient variants as well. Likewise, whenever a word contains a mistake in the manuscript, it has been corrected in the text and the incorrect form was given in a footnote. One example is the word « àဆÝÂ» tafavvuq , which is written « à ÝÂ» tafarruq in all manuscripts except in manuscript L. This word has been recorded as « Ç Ç» n n in manuscript L. While editing, the correct form of the word, « àဆÝÂ» tafavvuq , was recorded in the text and the other forms were moved to a footnote. Fortunately, there are few of these words in the text.



96
Thus, perhaps the editing method used in this thesis could be described as a mixing of the critical and eclectic methods. As was explained in the section above on manuscripts, there is no consequent way of writing compound words, like adding a prefix to the word, adding a suffix, forming a plural noun, and so on. That is, the compound words are every now and then adjoined or apart. The writing of compound forms of the words is here based on the principle of separate writing, so this method has been applied as the standard method in the edition. In the present thesis, the four Persian letters « » p, « » , « » ž and «=» g are written in their modern forms. The general orthography is also changed according to the most recent rules provided for Modern Persian, e.g. separation of the prefix « » m - from the stem of the verb and of the plural suffix « ဃ» -h from the noun, except in the case of kasra-yi iᡂ fa after a word ending in –ah, which is written with a « » hamza. Furthermore, the majh l vowels ( and ) are transcribed with their Modern Persian counterparts ( and ). Vocalisation in the edited text is added by the editor. The letter «^» is occasionally written for the kasra-yi iᡂ fa, for example: «^ÚဒÛ» z instead of «`ÚဒÛ» z-i and « ဃ Üထ Á» j yg h instead of ခ Üထ Á»
«` j yg h-i. They have kept with this form in the edited text. The editor is responsible for the punctuation of the text. Additions by the editor are marked by square brackets, [ ], whereas explanations of words and terms are put between brackets ( ) in the translation. < > is added around pleonastic words.

Manuscript O was copied from manuscript N word by word; even the colophon date was copied. But it is not known when this copy was done. Manuscript NH is lost. Manuscript L has no colophon date, but due to its simple language, it seems to be the last version reproduced from the Ard y-V r f N ma. It seems that this manuscript is a copy made in 954 A.Y./1585 A.D. from the copy of the Ard y-V r f N ma which was brought by Kama Asa from Persia (Unv l 1940: 18). The colophon date of manuscript M is unknown due to the loss of the last folio.

In the name of God the compassionate, the merciful,
the righteous, the creator
ARD Y-V R F N MA
I give thanks to God who created us as [139a] he willed and he wills, and peace upon the prophet. And then; Thus they say that when Ardaš r B bak n became king, he killed ninety kings, and some say he killed ninety-six kings, and he emptied the world of enemies and made [it] a tranquil place. And he summoned before him all the dast rs and m bads who were [active] at that time and said “Show me clearly the true and correct religion which almighty God revealed to Zarathustra the high ranking and [which] he made current in the world, so that I may destroy false religions and disputes and bring about faith in one [religion]!” And he [Ardaš r] sent somebody to all the provinces. In every place where there was a learned man or a dast r he summoned them all to his court. A crowd of forty thousand men were gathered at the court. Then he spoke and said: “Choose those who are the wisest among them!” They selected the four thousand wisest of them and informed the king of kings and he ordered: “Exercise prudence a second time! Choose again among them those who are most expert in discernment and who know by heart a large amount of the Afist (Avesta) and Zand!” Four hundred men who knew by heart the largest quantities of the Avesta and Zand emerged. Once again and with precaution they selected forty men who knew by heart the whole of the Avesta. Among these forty men, there were seven men who had not committed any sinful deed from the beginning of their lives until the age they had now reached. And they were exceedingly



106
cultured and virtuous in thoughts words and deeds and they were all attached to God. Then all seven of these men were brought to King Ardaš r. Afterwards, the king stated: “It is necessary for me to dispel these suspicions and doubts about the religion, and all people will adhere to the religion of Ohrmazd and Zarathustra; and all disputes about the religion must be dispelled so that it will be clear to me and to all the learned and wise men which religion [this] is, and these suspicions and doubts will disappear from [our] religion.” Then they replied: “No one is able to provide this information except the one who has not committed a sinful deed from the beginning of his eighth year to the age he has now reached, and this man is V r f, because there is no one more virtuous, with a more enlightened mind and more truthful than he. And thus it is necessary to choose him for this serious affair. And we six others will perform suitable worship and charms that have been prescribed by [our] religion for this purpose, so that the Glorious God will reveal all matters to V r f and V r f will inform us of them, so that everyone will be free of doubt about Ohrmazd’s and Zarathustra’s religion. And V r f agreed to this matter. And King Ardaš r was pleased with these words. And then they said: “This matter cannot be carried out correctly unless they go up to the sacred fire.” And then they rose with determination and went away. After that, those six men, who were dast rs, performed their ceremonies on one side of the fire-temple and on the other sides, the other forty men together with those forty thousand dast rs who had come to the court, all performed their ceremonies. And V r f washed his head and body [ceremonially] and put on white clothes and perfumed himself with sweet scent, and he stood before the fire and repented of all [his] sins. V r f had seven sisters, and when they were informed of the news, all seven came and they wept and cried saying: “We are seven veiled heads at home, and as for our brother, we have no one beside him, and we place all our hope in him. Now you [139b] will send him to the Other World, and we do not know whether we will see his face again or not. And you will make us orphans. We have been separated from our father and mother and you want to separate us from our brother, too. We shall not permit this, because we have only this one brother. Choose someone else and set [our] brother free to us!” When the dast rs heard these remarks, they said: “Do not be worried and mistrustful, because we will return him [to you] safe and healthy in seven days.” Then they swore an oath and the seven sisters became satisfied and turned back.



107
Then the King of Kings, Ardaš r, and his horsemen clothed in armor kept guard around the fire-temple, in order to prevent a heretic or a hypocrite from doing a hidden thing to V r f that would cause harm to him and so that no one could commit an evil deed during the worship ceremonies which would render the charms void. Afterwards they placed a bed in the center of the fire-temple and spread clean bedding on it. Then they seated V r f on the throne and put a face-veil on him. Those forty thousand men began to celebrate the worship and they prepared some consecrated bread and put some wine upon the consecrated bread. When they finished the ceremony they gave one cup of that wine to V r f as [the sign] of good thought, that is, of a pure and true belief and intention, and they gave him the second cup as [the sign of] good word, that is, of sincere speech and true word and they gave him the third cup as [the sign of] good deed, that is, a praiseworthy act. After that, when V r f had drunk the three cups of wine, he laid down there and fell asleep They continued the worship ceremonies during seven days and nights while those six dast rs sat by V r f’s bed. Those other thirty-three men who had been selected performed ceremonies around the throne. Meanwhile, those three hundred and sixty other men who had been selected earlier performed ceremonies around them and thirty-six thousand men performed ceremonies around them inside the dome of the fire-temple. Meanwhile the King of Kings, clothed in armor and seated on [his] horse, and his troops, were continually circulating outside the dome and did not even allow passage to the wind. In every place where worshippers were seated in clusters, a group of soldiers with drawn swords and clothed in armor stood watching to keep them in their proper places and no one was allowed to mix with anyone else. Infantry-men in armor stood around where V r f’s bed was, so that no one but those six dast rs were free to go near the throne. From time to time, the King of Kings himself went in and came out and guarded the fire-temple. They watched over V r f’s body this intensely for seven days and nights. Finally, after seven days and nights V r f moved again and became revived and sat up. When the people and the dast rs saw that V r f had awakened, they were happy and glad, they experienced peace and stood up to show reverence and said: “You are welcome, o Ard y-V r f, and that means when looking back that he is heavenly righteous”. How did you come back and how did you escape and what did you see? Tell us so that also we may know the conditions of the Other World.”



108
[The First Episode]
Description of How Ard y-V r f Returns from Heaven and his Report
Ard y-V r f said: First, bring me something to eat because, I ate nothing during these seven days and nights and my body has become weakened. Afterwards, ask me whatever you wish and I will inform you. The dast rs prepared some consecrated bread immediately. Ard y-V r f recited the v j slowly. He ate a little and gave thanks to God. Then, he said: “Now fetch a knowledgeable scribe [140a] and I shall reveal everything I saw; and you must send copies all over the world so that the matters of heavenly paradise and heaven and hell will be clear to everyone. Thus they may know the value of good deeds and they may avoid evil deeds. Then they brought a knowledgeable scribe and he sat down in the presence of Ard y-V r f.
[...] I drank and fell asleep. Some time passed. I saw Sur š-aš (Sur š the truthful) as he approached and he showed me reverence and greeted me and said, “Ard y-V r f, you are welcome as you come from that contentious world to this luminous world, but it was not yet time for you to come to this world.” I showed him respect and said, “I have been sent as a messenger from that world. For this reason all the dast rs and all the pious men held a meeting and the King of Kings sent me on this important [mission] to obtain information about this world.” When I said these words, Sur š the truthful took me by the hand and said: “Indeed, your intention and thought are pure, right, and true. Ascend one step.” I ascended one step. And he said to me again, “Your speaking is true and you have not told lies. Ascend another step.” I ascended another step. Then for the third time he said: “All your deeds are good and sincere, you have done no evil and due to it you have reached this level which no one has ever reached. Ascend another step.” As I ascended another step, I reached the nvad-p l (Chinvad Bridge) and I saw [that] the bridge was like a tree with many branches and there were branches that seemed as thin as a sharp edge.
[The Second Episode]
Description of how Ard y-V r f saw a spirit which had departed the body
Then as I was watching, I saw in that place a man’s spirit that had recently departed [his] body and was seated by the bed of the dead body and was saying these words, “May he be happy whose [own] goodness has become



109
beneficent for people”. For during the days he was there that spirit had experienced more rest, comfort and happiness than he had during all his time in the world. At dawn following the third night I saw that spirit coming and on the road he was following I imagined that he was walking through basil and blossoms. The odor of the basil was so sweet smelling that, as long as I have been in the world, I have never heard of a sweeter odor. When I came nearer to the Chinvad Bridge, there came a zephyr from the paradise of olives that was more delightful than the odor of musk and ambergris. I looked through the zephyr, and never as long as I have been in the world had I seen a more beautiful apparition, with prominent breasts and ringlets reaching her feet. And the more I looked at her, she seemed more beautiful in my eyes, so that every limb that I looked upon I could not and should not take my eyes away from it as would befit. And the more I looked the more she appealed to me. And when the spirit saw that figure, she smiled at him. Then the spirit asked her, “Who are you for I have never seen a more beautiful, a more lovely and a more faultless face than yours?” The face replied: “I am your good deeds, which you have done in the world. You were of good intention, good words and good deeds, and you observed the pure religion. I am your good deeds. I am so beautiful in your sight because you have done charitable acts when you were in the world. You have respected water and fire, and through your effort you have not harmed [them] and you have destroyed the xrafstar (noxious creatures). And you have benefitted righteous men and whoever had come from a foreign land [140b] and also those who were living in the land. And you gave foreigners room in your own place and were hospitable towards them and treated them well. As much as possible you have been diligent about doing charitable acts and you have succeeded. I was beautiful and you have made me more beautiful, I was illuminated, and you have made me more illuminated. I was higher than all the spirits; you have made me superior and greater so that people in the world will perform deeds and charitable acts, Each day I will become more beautiful and illuminated because of you.” Then she embraced him and laughed with him. And then, in one step, with the good that he had thought he ascended to the star station. And at the second step, because of the good he had said, he went to the moon station. And at the third step for the good deeds he had done, he went to the sun station and finally, at his fourth step, he went to gar ᠒m n (paradise).
[The Third Episode]
Description of seeing the Amš spand n (Holy Immortals)
Then Sur š the truthful took me by the hand and led me onto the Chinvad Bridge. When I looked, I saw Mihr- zad standing there. Sur š the truthful put his hand on the bridge and stopped. When I saw the Holy Immortals I



110
wished to greet them. They greeted me first and said: “O, Ard y-V r f, you are welcome, though your time has not yet come.” And I said: “Greeting and salutation be upon you. I have been sent from that world by the m bads, the dast rs, the pure religious and the King of Kings, so that I can reveal to them the conditions of this world.” As I said these words I saw the man’s spirit that had [just] arrived there, and I saw that the bridge turned over to that side which was twenty-seven meters in width. I saw how the spirit passed bravely over the bridge and I also crossed the bridge after him.
[The Fourth Episode]
Description of how Ard y-V r f saw the virtuous and chaste spirits
And Sur š the truthful had taken me by the hand. When I reached the other side of the bridge I saw a luminosity before which my eye was dazzled. When I looked, I saw the spirits of past generations appear before us, and happily and smilingly to inquire about me, and they asked me in a pleasant way: “How did you escape from that wicked world; for in that world there is no comfort without suffering? Everything is nostalgia, sadness and sorrow. There is no pleasure that is not followed by more sadness in the world, which is the source of the grief and misfortunes of the virtuous. And since you have come here, do not worry, and be happy, because never again will pain reach you, you will be comfortable with no affliction and you will be in good health without any plague, eat well and be joyful because here is always happiness and cheerfulness; there is no evil here.” Then, while those spirits were speaking and making me [feel] hopeful and my heart light, I saw Bahman amš spand (Bahman the Holy Immortal) who came and took me by the hand and said: “Come and I will show you the golden throne which has been called the empyrean or celestial throne!”
[The Fifth Episode]
The description of seeing Bahman the Holy Immortal
And he brought me up, and I saw a throne that I am not capable of describing. And I saw the spirit of that man standing there and the Holy Immortals were doing a ring dance with joined hands, and I saw the spirits of that man’s relatives; they were all joyful as if a stranger had returned to his home and his relatives rejoiced on that account. Afterwards, Bahman the Holy Immortal took the spirit by the hand and led him to his place, and those spirits of past generations went along with him, and they were happy as he sat on his throne. Then Sur š the truthful [141a] took me by hand and said: “Behold, the empyrean and the celestial throne. Do reverence!”



111
I did reverence. I saw that all was luminosity; my eye was dazzled.
[The Sixth Episode]
The Description of Seeing Ham stag n (Limbo)
Then Sur š the truthful took me by the hand, turned and led [me] back to the Chinvad Bridge again. There I saw that in the middle of the Chinvad Bridge many people had gathered as a crowd. I asked Sur š the truthful: “Who are these people and why are they gathered here, what are they doing and why are they being kept here?” Sur š the truthful said: “Call this place limbo because these people are here and will remain continuously standing and will not be able to sit down until the resurrection of the final body. And they are superior people whose virtues and sins are equal. When you go back to that world, say to people that although their good deeds are few, they [should] strive to do [them]. Because if the good deeds of this group had been a little more than their sins, even as little as a single eyelash, their spirits would have reached paradise and would not have come here, where they must stand up in this way, and the cold and the heat will affect them until the time of the resurrection of the final body. Otherwise, no other suffering is [inflicted] on them.”
[The Seventh Episode]
The Description of Seeing the Sit ra-p ya (Star-Station)
And from there he brought me back to the Star-station. I saw some souls who radiated light like the stars. I asked Sur š the truthful: “What is this place, and who are these people, and why have they been kept here?” Then Sur š the truthful said: “These are the souls of those persons who have not become nau-z d and they have not performed g t -xar d. They had the ability and they had [received] the command, but they did not strive to attain the reward. But because they did not become nau-z d, their souls have been detained here and they are not capable of rising higher than this.”
[The Eight Episode]
The Description of Seeing the M h-p ya (Moon-Station)
Then, Sur š the truthful took me by the hand and led me to the Moonstation. I saw many people who had gathered there. I said: “What is this place and who are these people?” Sur š the truthful answered: “This is called the paradise that is well-known as the Moon-station. These people have not performed nau-z d although they have exercised all the other virtues. They have remained in this place because they have not recited the G th s and have not performed the worship. The souls of these people are as luminous as the moon, and they are living in comfort and pleasure.”



112
[The Ninth Episode]
The Description of Seeing X rš d-p ya (Sun-Station)
Afterwards, I left that place along with Sur š the truthful, and I saw a place the luminosity of which caused my eyes to be dazzled. And I saw people who were seated there and each one of them was seated on a golden throne. I asked: “What is that place, and who are these people; you could imagine each of them to be a king because of the houses, the thrones, and the articles of luxury?” Sur š the truthful said: “This place is the Sun-station, and these are people who committed few sins in that world, besides having done nauz d and exercised many virtues. They have purified their souls in this manner, and because of this they have become worthy of all goodness.”
[The Tenth Episode]
The Description of Seeing the Place of worship
Then Sur š the truthful led me yet higher. I looked and saw luminosity everywhere, so much so that I could not see anything due to the luminosity. Sur š the truthful said to me: “This is the place for worshiping Ohrmazd. Pay homage to Ohrmazd!” I worshiped properly and according to my ability, and I lost my sense and my reason because of the majesty and luminosity of that place.
[The Eleventh Episode]
The Description of Nourishing by the Spring Oil
After that, I heard a voice saying: “Do not trouble him much, because he has come from that world of distress and affliction. [141b] He has suffered so much on the way, and has experienced much dread. Rather give him food!” While I looked, they brought a cup and poured some oil in the cup, and said: “This is called spring oil.” When I drank it, I found its flavor such that I had never drunk anything as delicious as that in the world, and still I feel its taste and delectation. And I know that as long as I live that pleasure will not leave my palate. And they said: “Every person who is in paradise is there because of his good thoughts, good words and good deeds, and this is his place, and he will be fed by this meal at first. And also women who are god-fearing, obedient to their husbands, and religious will be nourished by that same meal, and will be seated at this same place and station.
[The Twelfth Episode]
The Description of Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal
And then while I was looking, I saw Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal who was



113
coming near me. I made an effort to greet him, but he greeted me first, and said: “You are welcome, Ard y-V r f, although it was not yet time for you to come. And you have irritated me a little, because you have placed wet logs on the fire. And the Most High God has entrusted the fire to me, and whosoever does wrong to it in that world, I will be irritated with that person in this world.” When I heard these words from Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal, I replied: “The Holy Immortals are not idle talkers. I know truly that I have never put wet logs on the fire, and that I always only put seven-year-old logs on the fire. I do not understand how it could be that you tell me, ‘You have put wet logs on the fire.’” When he heard those words, he took my hand and said: “Come and I will show you the seven-year-old logs you have put on the fire.” And I followed him. I saw a whirlpool with much water standing in it. He said: “That is what has leaked out of the seven-year-old logs you have put on the fire. Be aware that one-year-old logs may be very much drier than the seven-year- old logs, because, whenever more than one year has passed, the log will absorb moisture again and get wet. And you should tell these words to the people.”
[The Thirteenth Episode]
The Description of Seeing Gar ᠒m n (Paradise) and the Place of Ohrmazd
Then Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal took me by the hand and led me to Paradise. When I saw that place, I was astounded and powerless. I imagined that it was made of ruby. It shone like the sun, but was perhaps brighter and more beautiful than the light of the sun and the moon. It was as if that light shone on one side and radiated light from that side. And I asked Sur š the truthful: “What is this place, and of what precious stone has it been made?” Sur š the truthful replied: “This jewel is a diamond, pure and [like] a pendant.” When I went a short distance, the light became brighter and brighter and however much I looked, I could see nothing due to the luminosity. I heard a voice saying: “You are welcome, o Ard y-V r f, from that contentious, troubled world to this pure world.” Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal were told to take V r f’s hand and show him the place of the righteous and that of the sinners and the reward for virtues and the punishment for sinners. And then they took my hand and led me to each place.
[The Fourteenth Episode]
The Description of Seeing the Souls of the Munificent and the Generous
In the first place I reached, I saw souls all dressed in garments and clothes of



114
gold and silver brocade, [and they were] all seated on thrones with crowns on their heads [142a] and their faces radiated luminosity in wide circles. They were all laughing and playing joyfully. When I saw them I became very happy and I was amazed by their merriment. And I asked Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal: “What people are they?” They replied: “These are the souls of the munificent ones who have been generous to their relatives and to worthy men in that world. And what they had, they did not deny the virtuous and the chaste. And they were always hospitable, and donated clothes to the poor and to the orphans, and fed the hungry. Now, consequently, their souls receive exactly the greatness and exaltation and enjoy the goodness and luminosity that you see.” Those souls appeared good in my sight and I said: “I wish my soul would be able to reach to this place.”
[The Fifteenth Episode]
The Description of Seeing the Souls that have done nau-z d
Then when I had passed that place, I saw below them a people who wore multicolored clothes of light, so that in the world I had never seen the likes of such beautiful clothes. And all shone like the moon and the sun in their places, and they were all happy together. I asked Sur š the truthful: “Who are these people?” Sur š the truthful answered: “These are the people who have done nau-z d in that world, and worshiped water and fire, and attained their places and positions. Thus now in this manner they are so happy because they have attained to their places.” When I saw them, because of the happiness of that place where they were rejoicing, I desired to stay with them. Sur š the truthful said: “It is not your time to stop in this place, because many people are waiting to hear from you, and you must return to that world again to inform them, so that they will [adhere] to the good religion of the d n-i bih-i mazdayasn n (pure religion of the Mazda-worshipers) and be without doubts.”
[The Sixteenth Episode]
The Description of Seeing the Place of the Kings
When I had passed that place, I saw a crowd dressed in new garments, coming and going anywhere they desired just like the angels, and they had no need to walk but proceeded with their feet in the air. They were covered with pearls and jewels from head to foot, and a feeling of their awe and statesmanship emerged from there. I was surprised by their gloriousness and esteem. I asked Sur š the truthful: “Who are these people, because of whose dignity and magnificence I felt a fear come into my heart.” Sur š the truthful replied: “These are the souls of the kings who were just and fair. Because their commands were obligatory for every one in that world, so also in this



115
world they are the kings of paradise. They come and go wherever they desire, and there is nothing better than their souls, because as long as they were in that world, they were just and held back injustice and oppression from the common people at all times. And they have their share and part in every good deed that has been done in the seven climes of the earth. Consequently, their souls are as honorable and glorious as you see.” And in my sight they were very good indeed and glorious and splendid. And I showed reverence to them and declared: “O happy is the king who was just, so that his soul will reach such a splendid and glorious rank and position”.
[The Seventeen Episode]
The Description of the Position of the dast rs and the m bads
When I passed beyond that place, I ascended to a place where I saw a crowd who were all seated and each one had four cushions, and the Holy Immortals [142b] strewed [good things] upon them at every moment. And they reflected glory and magnificence. And when Sur š the truthful approached them, all of them stood up, and Sur š the truthful soothed them and honored them and said: “Is there any wish which has not been fulfilled? [If not] tell me so that I [can] request it of Ohrmazd and he will grant you these wishes.” They prostrated themselves and said: “Whatever we need has been provided, and we are all the time in the midst of comfort and ease, the gifts of God, and these are due to your glory and magnificence.” Then I asked Sur š the truthful: “Who are these people with such splendor and fortune, that one would imagine that each one is a Holy Immortal, seated on his throne in dignity and majesty?” and Sur š the truthful said: “These are the souls of the dast rs, the m bads, the [spiritual] masters, and the judges for whom I was the intercessor, so that Ohrmazd the creator worked his generosity for them. He has granted them this dwelling-place with such honor, glory and luminosity. Every judge and authority who judges justly in that world, and takes circumstances into consideration and gives due respect to kindness and tenderness, I shall be his intercessor and provider of fees. And each authority who judges according to bribe or bias, I will be his enemy in this world. And God has entrusted them to me.” I prayed and passed beyond that place.
[The Eighteenth Episode]
Seeing the Position of Women who obeyed their Husbands
I arrived at a place and saw the souls of some women who were dressed in gold brocade garments, with all their robes studded with pearls, rubies and other precious stones. On each woman’s head a bejeweled crown had been placed. And they were all enwrapped in long gowns and sables inlaid with jewels and pearls. And they were walking gracefully, coquettishly playing and laughing in paradise. When I saw how nice those women were, each one



116
better than the other, and how they came towards me [?], with all the gold, silver and precious stones and the playful friendliness they showed each other in that they placed an arm around each other’s neck [thus exhibiting] the enjoyment and pleasure they had together, I felt a fear that I would lose my reason and wisdom. I asked Sur š the truthful: “Who are these women that the Most High God has held to be worthy of all this beneficence?” Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal replied: “These are the souls of the women who obeyed their husbands in that world and did not reject their husbands’ command and have held their husbands’ hearts as their own and have not abandoned their husbands’ bed, and have not preferred another man to their husbands. And they have honored fire and water as far as possible. And they have fulfilled all the religious duties that were their responsibility. For the sin of menstruation and the terror of the sepulcher they have prayed dav zdah hum st b n. And they have been content with what God has granted their husbands. And they have done housekeeping. And they have not been double-minded and keepers of separate purses, and their husbands have been pleased with them. Thus now their souls are as joyful and pure as you see. And whatever they need, the Most High God has granted them. Consequently, they are so cheerful because they have preserved themselves from all sins. “When I saw how good they were, I was glad and said a prayer for them and then passed beyond that place.
[The Nineteenth Episode]
The Arrival of Ard y-V r f at the Place of People who have performed the Worship
Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal took my hand and led me to each place. We arrived at a place [143a] in which, when I looked, I saw the souls above the sky, in the very uppermost part of Paradise, who had been seated above everyone else, and all the Holy Immortals were seated in front of them. I saw that their place was such that sweet basil and royal basil of different colors grew there. They had on golden and silver garments of silk. And I saw running streams and [heard] songbirds. They were seated in the midst of fortune and comfort. The spring oil was put in front of them, and they were [full of] merriment and joy. I asked Sur š the truthful: “Who are these people so full of merriment and joy?” Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal said: “These are the souls of those persons who have commissioned worship in that world. And they have done prayers for ham -d n and dav zdah hum st b n. And, they have commanded g t -xar d and zinda-rav n, [and] others similar to those they have commissioned. They have performed worship on their own and they have been h rbads. They have recognized the Holy Immortals and have revered them. And now the Holy Immortals are sitting before them and encouraging them with soft words, and holding them dear, as you see. And day after day the souls of



117
these people become more luminous, purer and more respected, and whatever good deeds and virtues people perform they will be ham z r (i.e their partners).
[The Twentieth Episode]
Arrival at the Place of Heroes
When I passed beyond that place, I saw a crowd from whose faces glory and splendor radiated, and they displayed dignity and majesty. All of them were dressed in military uniforms, of gold and silver brocade. And golden and silver weapons had been placed near them and they were playing a game of war. And they looked very mirthful, jolly, and dignified to my eyes. I asked Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal: “Who are these people with such splendor and majesty?” They replied: “They are those persons who protected Iran against its enemies. Lest perhaps the enemy would cause damage to the country, they constantly endured physical toil. Now they enjoy the comfort and ease that you see.” Those souls were very excellent in my view, because of their comfort.
[The Twenty-first Episode]
Arrival at the Place of those who have killed xrafstar n (noxious insects)
And when we had passed beyond them, I saw other people who were seated in their places. There were gardens, orchards and fruit trees and sweetly singing birds. I saw streams with running water in which there were rubies and pearls instead of sand and pebbles. And gold and silver fish were swimming in those streams. And at the edge of the streams stood musicians composing songs for the birds and other melodies. And another group was dancing the dance of Dast-band in front of them. I asked Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal: “Who are these people to whom the Most High God has granted so much comfort, fortune and joyfulness?” They said: “These are the people who have killed noxious creatures and other insects and many beasts in that world. They were continuously diligent in killing noxious insects. Now, they have been promoted to this rank which you see.” When I saw how cheerful they were, I said: “I should be constantly occupied with killing noxious insects and perhaps my soul could attain to such [143b] a place of rank which would be so honorable.”
[The Twenty-second Episode]
Arriving at and Seeing the Place of Farmers
Then we passed beyond that place and went up to another place. I saw lands



118
[covered] with a thousand herbs and more flourishing than the land with sweet basil, where the fragrance of musk, ambergris and camphor came from those trees, and [there were] citron, sour orange, lemon and jasmine trees as well as various other fruit trees. And I saw women [who were] all dressed in multi-colored painted garments with golden crowns on their heads, and they were standing in front of those people. And there were musicians [standing] around them. I saw them and I was surprised and I said: “Each group that I see is more beautiful and happier than the others.” I asked Sur š the truthful: “Who are these people who are so honored and live in such comfort and blessing.” Sur š the truthful answered: “These people were the farmers who sowed and tilled in that world and made the earth flourish, and planted all kinds of trees, and cultivated corn and barley. Now they are being remunerated in this place. And the women standing in front of them are the spirits of the earth who have made the earth flourish. And Ohrmazd the creator has placed the earth under the protection of Isfand rmad amš spand (Isfand rmad the Holy Immortal). They have made the earth flourish, have been righteous, and have not committed treason. Therefore, Isfand rmad the Holy Immortal has held them in esteem for their goodness just as you see.” When I saw those people, I prayed to Isfand rmad the Holy Immortal and said: “Blessed is he who cares for you and you are his supporter, so that you bestow these thrones on him.”
[The Twenty-third Episode]
Arrival at the Place of the Shepherds
Afterwards we passed beyond that place. I saw another crowd for whom thrones had been arranged and royal garments had been spread about. I imagined that those places, mansions, and houses had each been built of a different color and material, one was made of ruby, another of pearl, one of emerald, one of diamond, and one of crystal. And a throne had been placed in each house, and each individual was seated separately on a throne in accordance with his own wish or desire. And before each of them a horse was standing with a bejeweled and golden saddle. And they had thrust their heads forward with pride and were elevated because of their virtues. And when I saw those people, I was astonished by such respect and majesty. And their pride was pleasing to me. I asked Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal “Who are these people who have such pride and dignity?” Sur š the truthful said, “They are persons who were shepherds in that world and have kept sheep, and who did not allow them to run short of water and grass to eat. They protected them against the thief, the wolf, and the bandit, and from the cold and the heat. And they have shared their milk and oil charitably with mendicants and deserving poor men. And as much as they were able they strove to act righteously and not to betray people. They honored every stranger they met in the desert and gave him food. Now their souls are



119
in the peace and comfort that you see. But, O Ard y-V r f, I advise you that you should say to people that it is not possible to experience comfort in both worlds. And that world is a place of hirelings, and as long as they do not suffer hardship and do not finish their work, they will not be able to attain this comfort and be worthy to seek a reward, nor could they gain such comfort in this world. [144a] And one may ask for one’s reward when one accomplishes one’s duty. If they do not work and do not suffer pain, then they should not covet rewards. How, then, is greed? Think for yourself and suppose that someone who has lived in peace and comfort for fifty years, then one day he meets with misfortune either through tyrants or of his own doing. He will forget those fifty years of ease. He will weep and moan over that one day of difficulty that has happened to him, and the fifty years of abundance will be bitter to him due to that small difficulty. And no comfort will remain with him. And due to that suffering of only one day he will feel that he has suffered difficulties all his life. After [experiencing] both good and bad, know that in the end things should be better. Now, these people were shepherds and you should consider how much trouble they put up with in that world? In the unpopulated desert where these people lived alone they have continually had fear in their hearts because of the thief, the bandit and the wolf. And on the nights when it was snowing and it was so cold that it was impossible to put one’s head outside the hole, they protected [their] sheep from wolves and other dangers, and they have taken that suffering upon themselves. Consequently now those difficulties have come to an end, and they have achieved the happiness and comfort that you see. Then why should people be proud of that length of their lives and for some few days of comfort mixed with suffering, and for this pain give up their lives? And then, finally, all must be given up and be eternally punished, because there is no comfort in that world unless there has been difficulty either before or after that. Now [take] for example the pleasure of eating bread, unless one has suffered the pain of hunger one cannot appreciate that pleasure. And again [take] the pleasure of resting the body; unless one has previously suffered the pain of hard work one cannot appreciate that pleasure. It is like this with all the comforts of the world. All pleasures are mixed with pain, and all will be there for you, and many other sorrows as well will be added to yours. For example, you must have a horse so that you will not need to walk. When you acquire the horse, you will need someone to take care of the horse, to bring [it] water and give [it] barley and fodder. And when you are responsible for someone, you will be worried about how to feed and dress him. And you will always be involved with him. For example, someone wishes for a child from the Most High God, and the Most High God grants him the child. He will always be filled with worries, because it must have bread and other things. And when the child grows up, he will be worried about books and his education. And he will always be afraid [saying], “I am afraid that he will become ill or die, or else he will suffer from something. And if he dies, that



120
will [cause] so much sorrow that the parents will never get over it, and they will not be happy even for a day.” And this is the way of the world. And no one will be satisfied with what he has. This is the way of the world. And the more a person accumulates, the more he must have. For example, if someone has a fortune, he will be always worried about it, and he will be afraid that the tyrant king will take it away from him, and he is afraid that the thief will steal it from him, and he is afraid that the talebearer will tell tales about his fortune. He continuously hides it in this small hole or that one, and he spends his lifetime in so much fear and [144b] fright. And in the end it must be left where it is, or it must be given as daily bread to needy men and be taken away from husband and wife. He will suffer for [his] wealth in that world, and will be in pain and torment in this world. Therefore, V r f, you should admonish people to look to the end and to be discerning about matters of the world.” And he said these words and we left that crowd of people.
[The Twenty-fourth Episode]
The Arrival of Ard y-V r f at the Place of the Husbandmen
We ascended to another place. I saw a crowd of people clothed in beautiful garments, and the spirits of water and fire, and the spirits of the earth and plants and herbs and trees stood before them. And the former were inclining on brocade pillows like kings. Musk and ambergris were being burnt before them. And the gods were rejoicing in front of them and were encouraging them to play together. I asked Sur š the truthful: “Who are these people who are of such high rank that the Holy Immortals take such pains with them, and heed their wishes?” Sur š the truthful said: “They are the people who in that world were the husbandmen of villages, and cultivated the land, and laid out gardens and kitchen-gardens, they commissioned the digging of irrigation canals and built many houses and edifices, and they have furthered the construction of buildings. Now all the spirits and the fire are satisfied with them and are standing in front of them. They have respected the gods in that world and the gods reward them in this world.” They were very honorable in my view.
[The Twenty-fifth Episode]
Arrival of Ard y-V r f at the Place of the J dang y n (Intercessors)
Then we left that place and arrived at another place. I saw a crowd of people who were shining like the sun and the moon. Because of the brightness of their faces that place was such that I thought it was the sun. They were dressed in clothes of light. And they were coming and going in the air [and] they were amusing themselves just like birds in flight. I supposed that they were all fifteen years old, and I saw that there was not a trace of grief in their



121
hearts. But all of them were busy with their own interests, and were cheerful, joyful and pleased. And I asked Sur š the truthful: “Who are these people whose shining light has made me happy, because each one is shining like the sun and the moon?” Sur š the truthful said: “These are the people who in that world were intercessors for the poor and the needy and the rads (religious leaders), and they were the h rbads and the dast rs, and they have established dar n and fires. And they have collected relief funds from people for strangers, afflicted men, infants and orphans and have sent it to them. Now they have attained the luminosity and high position which you see.” When I looked upon that happiness and that light from that place, the many sweet basils, each of which had a different color and fragrance, and I saw the flowing streams like rose-water and houses each built of different jewels, and I saw the high multi-colored illuminated palaces, I became so eager and desirous of that place, that I said [to myself] “I will stay in this place”, because it was extremely grand and splendid in my heart, and I did not wish to come away from there. Then, Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal took me by the hand and led me from that place.
[The Twenty-sixth Episode]
The Arrival of Ard y-V r f at the Bridge and Observing the Condition of the Inhabitants of Hell and Sinners
And we reached a place where I saw a river with dark and fetid water as black as oil. The water was as deep as nine lances. And at the bottom of the water I saw that the souls were crossing the river with difficulty. [145a] Many of the souls had been submerged in the middle of the river and were asking the other souls to give them protection, but no one heeded their cries for help. There were many souls who were groaning and clamoring and crying out like someone who has been bitten by a viper, that he could not cross there and that he had been forcibly thrown in. And many passed over even more abjectly. When I saw such things, and the terror, dread and fear, and the groaning and weeping, I wished to give them protection. I asked Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal: “Who are these people who are crossing over the river with such difficulty? And what is this black water?” Sur š the truthful said: “This river has been accumulated from the tears of people’s eyes that have been shed after their deaths. And the more anyone weeps, mourns and laments for the dead, the more difficult it will be for him [the deceased]. These that you see who have become submerged and ask for protection but whom no one helps are those people who in that world have lamented, wept and mourned much. Consequently, the souls of their children are punished here. Therefore, when you go [back] to that world, tell people, ‘If you have pity on these souls and you do not wish for them to suffer pain and not be captives in this punishment because of your deeds, then they should do charitable deeds for the sake their souls and celebrate consecrated



122
bread, so that their souls will find comfort, and they should not lament and mourn because they [the souls] will suffer distress.’”
[The Twenty-seventh Episode]
Arrivial at and Sighting of the Condemned Soul on the Bridge
Then Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal led me onto the Chinvad Bridge. I saw a soul whose life had left its body [recently] and was seated beside the body and was saying these words: “Woe is to me, what shall I do and where shall I go and who may I ask to assist me, who will come to my rescue because I am helpless and without support or shelter? And I have no companion with me. I am all alone and without a guide.” And he was saying these words and was looking at the body and was mourning and wailing. On the first night he suffered more pain and difficulty than he had ever experienced in the world. And hirman and the daemons were struggling at that very place to lead him into Hell. And he was afraid of them just like the sheep fears the wolf. That soul suffered more pain and torture in those three nights and days than the inhabitants of hell have in a period of one thousand years. And after three nights and days, at dawn I saw that soul reach the Chinvad Bridge, unlucky, having suffered much pain, dread, blows, fear, torture, and difficulties. I felt a wind that blew on him from the middle of Hell, called v xtar (north) wind. No one had ever experienced such a fetid and unpleasant wind; in fact the Holy Immortals left that place because of the stench of that wind. And in the middle of that wind, I saw a figure and statue, black as tar. And its fangs stuck out [and it had] long claws and red eyes, and smoke was coming out of his mouth. And when the soul saw the figure that was so ugly, disagreeable and horrible, he wanted to run away from him. But the figure shouted saying: “You cannot run away from me.” The soul said: “Who are you who are so ugly and horrible and black that I have never seen an ugliness that is uglier and more horrible than you?” It said: “I am your acts and your deeds. And because you have been illintentioned, of evil deed and unfaithful to your promises, thus I am those evil deeds of yours.” The soul said: “Why you are so ugly, horrible and black?” It said: “Because while people in that [145b] world were busy working and doing virtuous deeds and striving to make provisions so that in this world they would be saved from the tortures of hell, you meanwhile were trying legally or illegally to accumulate wealth, which now should not be called “wealth” (m l) but “snake” (m r). And that wheat (gandum) you acquired to sell at a profit should now be called “scorpion” (gažduhm). And others have taken [your] wealth and wheat, and the snakes and scorpions are hanging on to your self, your liver, and they will sting you until the resurrection of the final body, you will not be relieved of their stings for an hour. O



123
what an unfortunate man you were! For as long as you were in that world, you were the kind of person who would close the doors of your home when strangers arrived, and you would not even set out two pieces of bread for him. And whenever you saw people who commissioned the celebration of the liturgy and they themselves worshiped, you said to them: ‘Today I must be superior (tafavvuq ) to others, for how can I know what will come tomorrow?’ Now, all of that has been lost and eternal punishment has come. You were unlucky in becoming immersed in the world. And you saw others who were young like you and who died. They had had that ambition in their hearts until they were taken to the tomb of the dead and you were afraid and [even] felt a little panic. Then you forgot everything again and you became busy with worldly matters. It is like sheep when a wolf has seized one and taken it away; as long as the wolf is visible, the other sheep look out for him, but when the wolf is out of sight, they become busy grazing again. Now all is gone and you are left here in the hands of hirman and the daemons. And for this you will have more torture from the daemons. As long as people in the world are occupied with evil actions every day I will become uglier and more dreadful and will inflict more torture.” And he held him by the neck. And the Chinvad Bridge turned to the side that was like a razor blade. And when he set his foot on the bridge, it was so hard that you would have thought it was a razor and a sword. And, when he had gone a short distance, he fell upside down into hell. When I saw that, I had pity on him.

Arrival at the Position and Place of the Inhabitants of Hell
Then Sur š the truthful and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal took me by the hand [and] followed that wicked soul. When we had gone a few steps, there [came] a more chilly, unpleasant, and fetid wind than any description of stench that I have ever heard of in the world. When we went farther ahead, I saw such darkness that one could have been grasped it with one’s hand. And I felt such fetid odors that I fainted every time I inhaled. I saw a place like a black well from which thick smoke came out. I saw that it was so narrow that one could only enter with difficulty. And I saw the inhabitants of hell, each one seated in a cave in the dark and the darkness of the place was so dense that each person could imagine that he was imprisoned there alone, and that no one except him was so afflicted. They were tortured and sad and shouted loudly. However, not one [of them] came to the help of [any] of the others, because there was darkness all around them and there was no way to come out. It was like a well where each one was punished and tortured in this manner. Each newly arrived soul who came into that place supposed that the place was a mountain, because they [snakes and scorpions] were all asleep one [on top of] the other. And the wicked soul was thrown into the



124
center. And the one stung him, and the other one tore him to pieces and bit him just as a wolf eats bones.

And they have deceived [147b] people, and caused them to turn away from the way of the d n-i bih-i mazdayasn n (pure religion of the Mazda-worshipers) to other beliefs and they have made manifest bad faiths and religions in the world.” Thus they spoke and we passed from that place.

[The Sixtieth Episode]
Ard y-V r f’s Arrival at the Audience-hall of the Most High God
And when I reached that place, I saw the glory and increasing magnificence of Ohrmazd the Creator. And however much I tried to pay homage to the glory and splendor of God, I remained stupefied and incapable; I could not say a word. I heard a voice [saying]: “O Ard y-V r f, turn back and go to your own city, because some people are anxious about you. For seven days and nights no one has rested, and they are listening to hear what message you will bring. Whatever you have seen, tell the whole truth! Be careful not to tell lies, because I see you in person!” And when I heard that voice, I prostrated myself and then, because of the luminosity, I could not see anything more. And then I heard again the voice which was saying: “O Ard y-V r f, tell the people that there is [only] one right way in the world, and every other way except that one lead one astray! And tell people that they should never turn their backs on religion, not when wealth and gifts are plentiful and not when they are in affliction and pain! They should not turn their back to the religion and constantly [148b] keep the faith and true intention and be of good thought and good deed. And they should keep their hearts steadfast and undoubting in the religion of Ohrmazd of Good Increase and the



133
prophethood of Zarathustra Sfantam n; and that is beneficence. And, say to others: “Do not forget the pure religion of the Mazda-worshipers in this world and in that world, and don’t refrain from it! Tomorrow repentance is of no benefit and you will not be born again to exercise virtue in order to gain rewards. And wake up from your sleep of neglect!”
These were the conditions as demonstrated by the Most High God.
May God keep us from all misfortunes and punishments, and maintain us in the good and pure religion of the Mazda-worshipers. May He keep the evil of hirman away from me and may He preserve us from being ashamed among people. May the magic of hirman and the accursed Daemons not come in our way, because the good and evil of this world will come to an end. If it were good and if it were bad, it will not last, and sorrow and repentance will not be profitable in the Other World. I am penitent and regretful, ajaš and axaš, of all the sins that I have committed intentionally or unintentionally. The book of [Ard y]-V r f N ma was finished on the second day of Murd d-m h-i qad m in the year of 896 [A.Y. = 1527 A.D.].
*** [It was finished auspiciously and in prosperity, the editing of the Zoroastrian Persian version in prose of the Ard y-V r f N ma, far away from the motherland and the father house, in Uppsala in Sweden, on Thursday, the day of Ohrmazd of Farvard n, the Naur z (new day) of the first day of the spring of the year 1377 Yazdgird , equal to Solar year 1387 and March twentieth of 2008 A.D.

VII. Commentary
The following notes have been written to elucidate three topics; firstly, to explain the usage of variant words and terms in different manuscripts, and the reason for selecting a special word or term in an edited text; secondly, to explain the names that have been mentioned in the text; and, finally, to explain some words and terms used in the text. The numbers at the beginning of each note refers to the number(s) of the line(s) in the Zoroastrian Persian edited text. Since the basis of this research is the Zoroastrian Persian version and its edited text, the notes and explanations refer to this text.
1. In the N manuscript, which is the original manuscript for this edition, the first line of the text is written on folio 138b. After the first line and at the beginning of the next folio (139a) a pale shadow of some words in the middle of the page can be observed. Probably, judging from the position of these words, they are an invocation of God’s name. If this invocation is really a heading, it may be written in coloured ink, because it is hardly visible in the microfilm. In some other the Zoroastrian Persian texts in this same N manuscript the invocation is found as « Ù @ င ÙÓထ Ï ခ ကထ Ï Úထ ? Ç ဂ » ba n m-i zad-i baxš yanda-yi baxš yišgar-i mihrab n-i d dgar “In the name of the merciful, beneficent, compassionate, righteous God” (folios: 107a, 110b, 114a, 131a and 138a). This may be the formula of the invocation in the Ard y-V r f N ma, too. However, it should be mentioned that the “invocation of God’s name” has been mentioned as « Ù @ င ခ ကထ Ï Úထ ? Ç ဂ » ba n m-i zad-i baxš yanda-yi mihrab n-i d dgar “In the name of the merciful, compassionate, righteous God” in some other texts of this manuscript (folios: 151a, 219b, 228b), in which the word « Ü ထ Ï » baxš yišgar “beneficent” is missing in comparison with the previous invocation. The invocation of the O manuscript is found in this one manuscript only and is written as « Úထ ? Ç ဂ » ba n m-i zad “in the name of God” which may be an identical invocation or a translation of the Parsig expressions pad n m yazad or pad n m yazd n. These are old Iranian invocations. On the other hand, it seems that the invocations like @ င ÙÓထ Ï ခ ကထ Ï Úထ ? Ç ဂ » « Ù “In the name of the merciful, beneficent, compassionate, and righteous God” or « Ù @ င ခ ကထ Ï Úထ ? Ç ဂ » “In the name of merciful, compassionate, righteous God” are expansive translations of «Äဒ3⁄4 o 1⁄4É3⁄4 o 〠Ä1⁄2 » bismill h-i ra᜸m n-i ra᜸ m “In the name of Allah, the compassionate, the



136
merciful”, which is an Arabic invocation of the name of God. However, some equivalents for these two longer invocations are also found in Parsig. For example, one can refer to the heading of Riv yat-i H m t-i Ašwahišt n, at the beginning of the book: pad n m d d r weh abz n g kirbakkar which means “In the name of the good, bountiful, beneficent Creator” (REA 1980: I.1). With regard to this matter Goldziher (1909: 666-668 Shaked 1995: XII.153-154) has written that the Arabic invocation bismillah-i ra᜸m n-i ra᜸ m has its origin in Jewish and Christians sources. Contrary to this, Gignoux (1979: 159-163) believes that the Arabic invocation bismillahi ra᜸m n-i ra᜸ m originates from the same Iranian-Parsig pad n m yazd n (Shaked 1995: XII.159-163). It is not possible to use the the basic manuscript N (the archetype) to establish the original reading of the “invocation of God’s name” because it is not readable. On the other hand, it is not also possible to follow the reading of a majority of the manuscripts, because among these six manuscripts, the heading in five cases is readable; but among them there are not even two similar invocations. Due to this, we assume that it is possible that the “invocation of God’s name” in the text of the Ard y-V r f N ma of manuscript N may be the same as in most texts of this manuscript -Óထ Ï ခ ကထ Ï Úထ ? Ç ဂ » « Ù @ င Ù “In the name of merciful, beneficent, compassionate, righteous God”, this invocation is preferred in the present edition. 2. The name of the work is not mentioned at the beginning of the text in manuscript N, but in the old list of contents (without page number on folio 06a) of this same manuscript, «* ထစ^ » “Ard y-V r f” is given as one of the works.

In fact, this is a mixture of the name of two works “The Ard y-V r f N ma” and “Zarathustra visits Ohrmazd”. 3.

cording to the introduction of manuscript M (= H28), which was published by Haug and West, and has changed this expression to « ¤ ဒÒ စ » dur d bar pa mbar-i m “greeting to our prophet”. But, attention must be paid to the fact that the word « » m in this expression belongs to the next sentence, the beginning of which is « » amm baሁd, where the first word has been written as « » instead of « ». 5. It is surprising to find the expression « » amm baሁd at the beginning of a Zoroastrian Persian work. This expression is not found in any other Zoroastrian Persian work, whereas it is very common right after the introduction in a great number of Iranian-Islamic works. 6. Ardaš r son of B bak (the first Ardaš r) is the first Sasanid king who ruled between 224 and 240 A.D. and died in 242 A.D. (Wiesehöfer 1996: 316). 6-7. According to the text the ninety kings who were killed by Ardaš r were the same as the kings appointed to rule over Iran by Alexander, as mentioned in the Bundahišn: “Then, in this millennium, appeared Artakhstar [Ardaxš r] son of P bak; he killed those petty-rulers, organised the empire, promoted the Revelation of Mazd -worship, and established many religioususages which went down to his dynasty” (IraBd 1956: XXXIII.15)165. Tansar’s letter has confirmed this as well (M nav 1975: 48; Boyce 1968‘c’: 29): “Ardaš r seized him together with ninety other descendants of kings enthroned by Alexander. Some he put to death by the sword, others through captivity”.166 Farz na Bahr m, the author of Š rist n-i ah r- aman recalls the sovereignty of these ninety kings as well “[Alexander] divided Iran and he turned ninety persons of those in command, who were called P dš h (king) and in Arabic Mul k-ul-╀aw yif, into rulers and commanders” (Modi 1932‘b’: 100)167. 8. « ဆ Ð » dast r “authority”, pl. «@ ဆ Ð » (dast r n), (Parsig: dastwar). dast r is a Zoroastrian spiritual authority who has the authorization to judge and to pronounce religious jurisprudence. Dankard 8. « ဆ » m bad, pl. «@ ဆ » (m bad n), (Parsig: mowbad or m bed). m bad is one of the religious authorities in Zoroastrianism. In the Sasanid period, m bads had a very powerful influence to the extent that the chief of them, mowbad mowbad n should approve the choice of the king. In addition to this, the mowbad mowbad n, was able to dethrone the king (M nav

1975: 88; Boyce 1968‘c’: 62). Nowadays, Zoroastrians call all spiritual authorities of Zoroastrianism m bad ( š dar 1992: 208). 8-28. The theme of this part and a section of the fourth book of D nkard are similar: Here Ardaš r B bak n, guided by his minister T sar/Tansar, decided to gather all the dispersed teachings of the Avesta from every part of the country to his court. After him, Šap r I (reign: 270-272 A.D.) son of Ardaš r, ordered various books of different sciences, that were dispersed to be collected and attached to the Avesta, and to make two copies of the whole work. After him, Šap r II (reign: 309-379 A.D) son of H rmizd, called together all learned-men of the country to argue and do research [about various matters]. Then, he proclaimed that the knowledge about religion is already perfected, so no ill-religion [it seems that he means diverging branches of Zoroastrianism] will be accepted afterwards (DkM 1911: 412-413)168. 9. «1⁄4ထ » d n means “the religious canon of Zoroastrianism” in this line and several other lines as well, for example, 25, 26, 27, 28. 10. «¥ Â » Zartušt (Avestan: Zara uštra-, Parsig: Zartušt/Zardušt/Zardu[x]št, Greek: Zoroaster) is the name of the prophet of Zoroastrianism. This name has several different forms in New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian, among them: «¥ » Zardušt, «¥ Â » Zartušt, «¥ ဃ » Zardhušt, «¥ » Zar dušt and «¥ Â » Zar tušt.
This name is given as Zartušt in line 10, and as Zar tušt in lines 26, 35 and 925. 10. «ဂဒÌÍ» ሁal ya is an incorrect spelling of the word « ÌÍ» ሁal y “high ranking”. The original translator or the copyist of the text has probably written this word « ÌÍ» in the original manuscript, since ᤱal y, with vowelization like «ñဒ » (faᤱ l), is a masculine form of this adjective meaning highranking: ÌÍ ¥ Â »
`
« zartušt-i ሁal y “the high-ranking Zarathustra”. But a later scribe, very likely due to his little knowledge of the Arabic language, has supposed that ሁal y is a synonym of ሁal ya, so he wrote the word in this form, although ሁal ya is the feminine form of this adjective169. While editing the introduction of the M (H28) manuscript, Muᤱ n has changed the adjective to «?ဠ1⁄2o ဂဒÌÍ» ሁalay-hi-s-sal m “Peace be upon to him”. 15. «ခ @ ဃ » š h n š h “the king of kings”. This word is written as MLKAn MLKA (huzw rišn) in the Parsig texts, but read š h n š h. It also appears written in contracted form as š h nš h (in lines 15 and 161) and «ခ ကင » šahanš h (in manuscript N2, in the footnotes 66 and 1135). 17. « 1⁄2 » Afist is the name of the sacred book of the Zoroastrians called the Avesta. There is no indication of the original name of the Avestan language, and the word “Avesta” is never mentioned in the Avestan texts either. It is mentioned as abest g in Parsig, and as 1⁄2` _ »

in Arabic, as well as in several different forms in New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian, among them: « Ðစ » Avist , « Ðစ» Vist , « 1⁄2 » Afist and ခ 1⁄2` »
« Bist h (Tafa╲╲ul 1997: 35). 17. « Ç » zand it is equal to Zand in Parsig. The word zand means “commentary”. In Zoroastrianism, zand means translating the Avesta into Parsig, which often provides a commentary as well. It might have been translated into the Parsig language in Sasanid times, probably due to the fact that the Avestan language had been forgotten. Today, the only available sections of the Zand of Avesta are Yasna, Vispard, Wid wd d, Xwurdag Abest g, H rbedest n, N yrangest n and Aogm጗daa .
22. «ဂ Ïထ ငÒ» pahr xta is equal to pahr xtag in Parsig, which conveys two meanings; firstly, it means “educated” and is used in the 21st line with this meaning. Another meaning of the underlying verb is “to avoid, to refrain from”, used in the negative form, that is «ဂ Ïထ ငÒဂÇ» na- pahr xta, in 602nd line and all other lines in the text. 22. «1⁄4 က » manišn is equal to menišn g in Parsig, which means “thought”. «1⁄4 ဆÙ» (Parsig: g wišn g) means “Word”. «1⁄4 Çဆ » (Parsig: kunišn g) means “deed”. 26. « Ú စ » rmazd, (Parsig: hrmazd, New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian: « Ú စ » rmazd, « Ú ဆဃ» h rmazd and «Ú ဃ» hurmuz), is one of the two incipient spirits of the world, called «ဆကဒ ဂ က×Ð» (Avestan spပnt .mainyu-) (Yasna XLV.2) and the creator of all goodness of the world and of the cosmos. He, who is the symbol of the light and luminosity, always fights against evil and darkness, which are the symbols of Ahriman (the Devil). On Resurrection Day, at the end of the 12 thousand years lifetime of the world, the combat will come to its end by the victory of Ohrmazd and all goodness. 26. Ú စ `1⁄4ထ »
« d n-i rmazd, means the rules established by Ohrmazd in Zoroastrianism, i.e. “the religious canon of Zoroastrianism”. 29-31. ¥àစ @ Â Üo Ð ¥ ဃ ÉÍ >စ ဂ @| မ @ Ç ဆ Ç ¤ 1⁄4ထ »
`` «¥Ð * ထစ 1⁄4ထ စ ခ ÕÇ ခ ကÙ þဒဃ ခ ဒÐ ဂ kas in xabar b z natav nad d dan ill n kas ki az avval-i ሁumr-i hašt-s lag t ba-d n vaqt ki ras da b šad h gun h nakarda b šad v n mard v r f ast “No one is able to provide this information except the one who has not committed a sinful deed from the beginning of his eighth year to the age he has now reached. And this man is V r f”. It is likely that the text is lacking some parts here. According to the text thus far, Ardaš r’s motive of gathering those forty thousand men is to collect religious sayings to distinguish between pure and false, and as a result, cause diversities in Zoroastrianism to disappear. But there is no sign of sending anyone to the Other World. The final six selected ones just mention a suitable man who will bring information, whereas there is no word formerly about sending anyone who is able to bring information. 33. «1⁄4 Úထ» yazišn “worship”. In manuscripts NPMO, it is written yazišn and yazišn-h in most cases throughout the manuscript, and only in a few



140
cases yaziš and yaziš-h . But in N2 there is a total mixture of the forms yaziš / yaziš-h and yazišn / yazišn-h . Variants of this word have not been given in the footnotes in order to avoid too much repetition. 33. «1⁄4 Úထ» yazišn is equal to yazišn in Parsig. This word means “worship” and “praise”. It is used in verb form as «1⁄4 Ð1⁄4 Úထ» yazišn-s xtan “making yazišn” (in 41 and several other lines), «@ 1⁄4 Úထ» yazišn-kardan “performing/doing yazišn” (57 and other lines) and «@ ဆ 1⁄4 Úထ» yazišnfarm dan “saying yazišn” (384 and other lines). yazišn is a kind of worshipping ceremony, performed in front of the holy fire in the fire-temple. During the ceremony, all of the 72 Yasna are recited by two m bads (priests). yazišn is a general name for all worshipping rites. 33. «ÑÇ ဒÇ» nairang (Parsig: n rang) means “charm”, “incantation” and “spell”. This is the name of some stanzas of the Avesta, uttered as powerful words either to have an impact for healing or to break the power of the demons in Zoroastrianism. The word nairang means “ritual/ceremony” in Parsig as well as in Zoroastrian Persian (Boyce 1991: 284-285). 38. For «@ |» dar n. The Parsis write « |» ar and «@ |» ar n (orthographically « |» dar and «@ |» dar n). This word has perhaps been in an orthographical form as ar n in the original manuscript written in Iran. In Zoroastrianism, there are three kinds of fire, which by the order of importance are: taš Bahr m (the fire of Bahr m), taš dar n (the fire of dar n) and taš D dg h (the fire of D dg h). To light taš dar n, four kinds of home fires are used, and it is a much simpler ceremony to worship this fire than the taš Bahr m (Modi 1932‘a’: 154-155, 162-163; Boyce 1968‘b’: 52). «@ | ခ Ù » darg h-i dar n means “the court or the threshold of dar n”, which is, in fact, the same as “the fire place for the fire of dar n”. 40. «ခ ÙÓÂ|» tašg h. The meaning of this word is either “the stony brazier in which they kindle the holy fire” or “fire-temple”. 44. «¥Ý Ò» pataft (Avestan: paitita-, Parsig: pet t, New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian: pataft or ¥_ `Ò»
« pitat), means “confession” and “penitence” and is written ¥_ ဆÂ»
« taubat in the យaddar Na᠒r (យDN 1909: LXV.1). A Zoroastrian person confesses his sins in front of a dast r to purify his spirit. During the pitat ceremony, a pitat stanza must be read. There are four kinds of pet t-n mag in the Zoroastrian literature in Parsig and Pazand: pet t paš m n h (confession for penitence) or pet t durb d, xwad petit (confession for the self), pet t r n (Iranian confession), pet t widardag n (confession for the dead) or pet t raw n g (confession for the spirit) (Widengren 1965: 265-267). All these pet t-n mags originate from the Ave4s5t-a5.1. In the Parsig version, V r f’s sisters asks the priests not to send their brother to the Other World. Although in the Zoroastrian Persian version it is the dast rs, who reply to V r f’s sisters, it does not seem that the sisters are talking to the dast rs, since the sisters three times use a sg. second per



141
son form of the verb in their statements to the person spoken to: စ É @ဆက » « Ð ဃ ဆ @ ငÁ @ akn n šum r ba-d n jah n xw h firist d “now you will send him to the Other World”, and ဂ ဒ1⁄2ထ စ»
_
«@ ဃ ဆ va m r yas r bixw h kardan “and you will make us unprotected (yas r)” and » «@ ဃ ဆ Á @ ÚဒÇ စ Äထ Á စ Ò az pidar va m dar jud šud m va az bar dar n z-im n jud xw h kardan “we have become separated from our parents and now you will also be separate us from our brother”. Due to this, it seems that they are talking to the king Ardaš r. It is true that the sisters use the plural pronoun « É » šum “you” three times in their statements, but it must be considered that they are talking to the king and therefore may not be permitted to address him by the sg. pronoun «ဆÂ» t . In the poetic version of the Ard y-V r f N ma, versified by Zartušt Bahr m Pajd , V r f’s sisters directly beg the king, not the dast rs, to refrain from sending their brother to the Other World (Zartušt Bahr m Pajd 1964: vv. 535-540). Haug and West hold it probable that this same prose version of the Ard y-V r f N ma may be the original source for Zartušt Bahr m Pajd ’s versification (Haug and West 1872: xix). If so, there must be a mistake on the part of the scribes not to mention the name of the king in connection with the sisters’ statements. 49. « ဒ1⁄2ထ» yas r. This word is not mentioned in any of the dictionaries. However, in the Persian dialect of Hamadan one whose mother has died is called yas r. This word is genrally an adjunct to the word «Äဒ ထ» yat m (fatherless/orphan): thus yat m-yas r means one who has lost both his father and mother, that is, one who has no one to protect him. In view of V r f’s sister’s statement, it seems that in this context the word yas r means ‘lacking a protector’. 55-58. The king and the army guard the fire-temple in order to prevent any heretic or hypocrite to throw something damaging at V r f. This same theme can be found in «( ဆဒÙ) ဆဒ @ ဒÒ @ Ð » d st n-i payd -kardan-i kiy mar᠒ (gay mart) “The myth of how Kiy mar╂ (Gay mart) was found”. Ohrmazd creates the body of Gay mart at the top of the Alburz Mountain. Then he makes seven Holy Amš spand n “Immortals” (six Immortals plus Sur š or six Immortals plus Vahr m (Bahr m)?) watch it carefully, lest Ahr man gain control over it and do something wrong or cause any damage to it which would destroy it (MS.S.P.1191: 138b-139b). 56. «&ဆÉ |» šm or «&ဆÉ » ašm (Parsig: ahlam ), means “heretic” or “atheist” in Zoroastrianism. 56. « က » mun fiq means “hypocrite”, “a person whose words and thoughts are not as the same as that which he pretends”. 57. «^ÚဒÛ» the letter «^» is used to indicate the presence of an iᡂ fa. 60. « က ^စ » r y-band, “face-veil” or “mask of the mouth”. This word is a translated from the Parsig word pad m which is written in Persian «? ကÒ» pan m. That is a kind of textile that Zoroastrian priests cover their mouth



142
and nose with to prevent the holy fire from being polluted by their breath while worshipping (B qir 1985: 146-153). The word pan m is written under the word r y-band in the N2 manuscript. 61. « ÕထဂÐ» sih-yak “one third”. It is written as sih-yak in the NPO manuscripts. sih-yak is a kind of wine that is condensed into one third, i.e. two thirds of which has evaporated and only one third of which is remaining. Compound words with this word as one element are « ဆ ÕဒÐ» si-yak -xw r (one who drinks this kind of wine), «ခ ဆ ÕဒÐ» si-yak -xw rah (habitually drunken with this kind of wine) and « စ ÕဒÐ» si-yak -fur š (wine-seller, especially of this kind of wine). Another name for this kind of wine is » « Ì1 šar b-i mu᠒alla᠒ (Mu‘ n 1984: 3.1980). Since, during the Yasna ceremony, the «@စ » (bread) and butter were used as symbols of the world of animals, Haug and West have read «ဂÐ» sih (three) as «ဂÒ» pih like «ဂဒÒ» piyah (fat) which they assumed was placed upon one of those dr n-breads. They thus supposed that this was a part of the Yasna worshipping ceremony and omitted the word « Õထ» yak (one) (HaugWest 1872: xvii). 61. «@စ » dar n (Avestan: draonah-, Parsig: dr n) or rather «@စ @ Ç» n n-i dar n is a kind of sanctified bread made from wheat flour in a round shape with nine cutting lines on the surface. The ceremony in which it plays a role is also known by the same name, i.e. dar n. 61. «1⁄4 ထ» yaštan (Parsig: yaštan) means “to pray”, “to worship” “to consecrate”. 61. «1⁄4 ထ @စ » dar n-yaštan “worshipping the sanctified bread”. ¥ ထ»
`
«@စ yašt-i dar n is the ceremony of praying and thanksgiving to the gods, while Yasna: h 8, is being sung (Boyce and Kotwal 1971: 56). Obviously it was a custom in pre-Zoroastrian Iran to say prayers for milk and bread. According to the Wiz dag h Z dspram (The selections of Z dspram) when Zarathustra was a child, his father provided a bowl of milk and asked a celebrated priest called D risraw to say prayers for it (WZad 1993: XII.2). 63. ဂက က ¥É{ဃ»
« humat-manišna. humat (Parsig: humat) means “good thought”, that is, one of the three fundamental principles of Zoroastrianism. manišna (Parsig: menišn g) is a form of «Óက » maniš “thought”. Thus, humat-manišna means “having good thought”. This word is used as «1⁄4 က » manišn in line 22 and as manišna in lines 63 and 254. 64. «ဂက ထဆÙ ¥ ဆဃ» h xt-g yišna. h xt (Parsig: h xt), means “good word”, that is, one of the three fundamental principles of Zoroastrianism. g yišna (Parsig: g wišn) means “speeking”. Thus, h xt-g yišna means “speeking good words”. This word is used as «1⁄4 ဆÙ» g višn in line 22, as guyišna in line 64 and as «ဂက ဆÙ» guvišna in line 254. 63-66. As has been indicated in the text, there is a connection between the drinking of the three bowls of wine and good thought, good word and good deed, which is also mentioned in lines 108-113. This connection will be con



143
tinued by ascending three steps towards heaven in the Other World. However, this connection is not specific for Ard y-V r f and his journey. In Bahman Punj yih’s Riv yat there is a story called ᜷ik yat dar b b-i xwardan-i may-i ᜸al l va ᜸ar m ba q ‘idi-yi d n “The Anecdote about Drinking Religiously Permissible Wine or Prohibited Wine”. It recommends people to drink three bowls of wine with a mind set on good thought in order for good deed to multiply in the body. It also gives the advice to drink three bowls with a mind set on good thought, good word and good deed to overcome the demons (Unv l 1922: I.270-271). 66. 1⁄4 စ ¥ _ဆ{ဃ»
« huvaršt-varzišn. huvaršt (Parsig: huwaršt), means “good deed”, that is, one of the fundamental principles of Zoroastrianism, too. varzišn (Parsig: warzišn), means “to put into practice”. Thus, huvarštvarzišn means “doing good deeds”. 1⁄4 က{ »
« kunišn (Parsig: kunišn) also means “deed”. This meaning is expressed with «1⁄4 Çဆ » k nišn in line 22, as varzišn in line 66 and as «ဂက Çဆ » k nišna in line 255. It is necessary to point out that humat-manišna, h xt-g yišna and huvarštvarzišn, are used instead of the three phrases «ဂက က ÈဒÇ» n k-manišna, ÈဒÇ» ဂက ဆ{Ù
« n k-guvišna and ဂက Çဆ ÈဒÇ»
« ` n k-k nišna.
69-73. At the beginning of the text, it is said that forty thousand people have come together in the court. However, all the people who say praise and keep guard around V r f are altogether 36 400 persons, even counting V r f himself, and not forty thousand men. Haug and West suppose that a sentence related to 3600 remaining persons must be missing in the text (Haug and West 1872: 18). 71. «¥Ð ဒÂ» t rast is a Parsig word means 300. It was used in the late Parsig language, in the inscription of Mil i r dkar in Tabarist n, in the year 1020 A.D. (Herzfeld 1932: 145). According to Lazard’s research, in New Persian texts t rast has been used in this same meaning, that is 300, in the Š hn ma by Firdaus (Wolff 1965: 254) in the Garš sp-N ma by Asad ┹ s (Ya'm ’ ’s edition 1938: 485), in the Kit b al-mudxal il ሁilm-i a᜸k m-i nuj m by Ab -Na┰r-i Qum , in the Ra ᡂat-ul-munajjim n by Šahmard n ibn Ab -alkha r, and in the Umm al-Kit b edited by Ivanow (Lazard 1995‘a’: 23). This word, in addition to the works noted by Lazard, has been used in two other texts as well, that is in this very same Ard y-V r f N ma and in the យaddar Bundahiš (1909: XXXV.21).
73. «Þ¤ကÙ» gunba (Parsig: gumbad) “dome”. gunba is an old form of the word « ¤ကÙ» gunbad. However, among all manuscripts, it is recorded as gunba only in manuscript O. 75-78. ခ ဒ ဒ É Í ÉÁ ဆà ဃ ဂ Ç ဆ ဂ 1⁄2 Ç @ က 1⁄4 Úထ 1⁄4ထ ဂ ထ Á ဃ ဂ စ» Üထ @ þဒဃ စ က 1⁄4 ထဆ ခ Üထ Á ဂÉဃ ဃခစ Ù Â Ç ဆ ခ 1⁄2ထ ခ ဒ ဆÒ ဠÐ စ « ÇÚဒ ဒÇ va ba har j y ki n yazišn-kun n nišasta b dand, ba har qaum , jam ሁat šamš r-kaš da va sil ᜸-p š da st da b dand t gur h-h hama bar j yg h-i xw štan b šand va h kas bad n d gar nay m zand “And in every place where worshippers were seated according to each category, a group of

That every person should remain in his position and is not to be mixed with other social classes is a very old thought in Iran, even originating in the legendary epoch. The social classes were confused by the order of ╱a99 k during his reign. After his victory over ╱a99 k (aždah g or azdah g) Frad ̈n ordered a restitution of the social classes into its first order, that is to the same order as in Jamš d’s time.

Before his journey to the Other World, the name of this character is mentioned sixteen times as V r f in the text170. But, according to all the Zoroastrian Persian manuscripts, at the end of the introduction, when V r f wakes up after returning back from “the Other World”, all priests and authorities call him « ဆ င ဂ @| ကဒ ဂ စ * ထစ^ ...» ... Ard y-V r f, va ba b z-b n n b šad ki bihišt aš b šad “... Ard y-V r f, and that means when looking back that he is heavenly righteous”. Ard y-V r f is what V r f was called by Sur š the righteous (1st episode), by the Holy Immortals (3rd episode) and by Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal (12th episode), while they see V r f, at the beginning of his journey to the Other World. Finally, Ohrmazd (60th episode) calls him by this name when he gives V r f the message to be brought to the present world. Besides the title of the book, mentioned at the beginning, the name of this character is given as “Ard y-V r f” ten times in the introduction. All these cases occur after his return from his journey to the Other World. Thus, the orthographic form of the name «* ထစ » “Ard -V r f” instead of «* ထစ^ » “Ard yV r f” recorded in some manuscripts after his return from the Other World, can be mistakes by the copyists. The form “Ard y-V r f” of this name is used in this edition for all occurrences of the name after V r f’s return from the Other World, as well as in other cases mentioned above. The name of this character is mentioned in 20 cases in headings of the episodes (34 % of the headings), in the L manuscript. Out of them 13 cases
170 In the Other World Ohrmazd and the Holy Immortal address this character as “V r f” three times.

(65 %) are in the form “Ard y-V r f” (episodes number 1, 4, 24, 25, 26, 33, 40, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60), and seven cases (35 %) in the form “Ard ” (episodes number 2, 19, 36, 38, 39, 47, 58). 86-87. This sentence is clearer in the London Manuscript (L):-^ စ» « ဆ င က ဂ * ထစ “And Ard y-V r f means paradisical righteous” (MS.L: 6a). 89. « » dar (Parsig: darag), means episode. This word is used for segmentation, corresponding to “chapter/episode” in Zoroastrian Persian works, for example: the យaddar Bundahiš and the យaddar Na᠒r. This word is changed into « » b b that is, its translation into Arabic in Islamic-Iranian literature, for example in the Q b s-N ma by Kay-Khusrau Iskandar (written in 1082), in the Marzb n-N ma by Saᤱd-udd n Var v n (written in 12101225) and in Gulist n by Saᤱd (written in 1258). The episodes are here numbered to make reference between the texts easier while comparing the Zoroastrian Persian and Parsig versions. In the Zoroastrian Persian version the episodes are originally not numbered. 90. The headings of all the episodes from the London manuscript (L) are given, because this is the only manuscript that has segmented the text. Thus all headings in this edited version correspond to this manuscript. 92. « » bar is written without variants in all manuscripts. V r f’s statement makes it clear that bar hear means “body”. Haug and West translated bar as “this one” (Haug and West 1872: xviii), to indicate that V r f means himself. Muᤱ n translates the word as «ÄÕ စ ဆÌငÒ» pahl va šikam “side and stomach” (Muᤱ n 1946: 64). Bah r translates it as «1⁄4Â» tan (body) and explains that the word bar may also mean tan (body) in New Persian (Steingass 1947: 166; Bah r 1996: 338). In Gignoux’s translation, the word is translated as “poitrine” five times (1.10, 48.2, 62.1, 65.1 and 67.2) (Gignoux 1984: 270), m zg r translates it as «ဂကဒÐ» s na (poitrine) following Gignoux ( m zg r 1993: 54). However, V r f means his whole body with the word bar. 94. « စ» v j (Parsig: w z, w j or b j, is written « စ» v j, « စ» v ž, « » b j, « » b ž and « » b z in Zoroastrian Persian and New Persian) “utterance”. Here v j means the prayer of eating. «@ Ç စ» v j-i n n is the prayer said before eating food, after which the food is eaten in silence. After eating and washing hands and mouth, « Þá @ ထ Ò စ» v j-i p y n-i a “the prayer when eating is finished” is said (Kotwal and Boyd 1991: 19-20, 7981, 95-97, 133). Due to the different spellings of the word, it is written either as (v j, in lines 94, 95) or as (v ž, in line 686). In the Paris manuscript P, this word is found as v ž when it first occurs in the first episode, then as v j. 96. ¥1⁄2ÏÇ»

146
nuxsat in manuscripts N and M, it has probably been a common mistake amongst the scribes and writers at the time when the text was written. 99. Haug and West have made a copy and published this much of the text from manuscript M (H28) (Haug-West 1872: Lxxxiv-Lxxxvii). After them, Muᤱ n has also edited and published that same amount of text (Muᤱ n 1946: 58-64). 99. The Knowledgeable scribe sits in front of V r f when he begins to explain the events of his journey. There is an interval between this part and the beginning of the next part, that is the part where V r f explains about his presence in the Other World, which begins with a half sentence. The two parts are not connected naturally. There is one or a few blank lines between the 93nd and 94rd lines in all the Zoroastrian Persian manuscripts. It is clear that they all have missed one or several sentences. 101. « စ Ð» Sur š (Avestan: sraoša-, Parsig: sr š). Sur š is the god of obedience of Ohrmazd’s words. He is sometimes considered as one of the six or seven Holy Immortals. Along with Mihr and Rašn, he judges the deeds of people in the other world (MX 1985: I.118-119). As Ohrmazd is the keeper of the spirit, Sur š is the preserver of the body. He pays a visit to people three times every night in order for them not to be annoyed by demons (IraBd 1956: XXVI.49). He helps the spirits of the dead to arrive at the Chinvad Bridge (idem: XXVI.50). Nyberg supposes that the role of Mihr has diminished in Zoroastrianism, and instead of this Sur š plays a more distinguished and outstanding role. In this way, a lot of ancient important characteristics of Mihr are manifested in Sur š. Thus, this Sur š is none but Mihr, who has clothed himself in Sur š’s disguise (Nyberg 1937: 73). 101. «ဆ စ Ð» Sur š aš (Parsig: sr š ahl i) means Sur š the truthful. ဆ _»
« is the Pazand form of the word and a Zoroastrian Persian title for Sur š. 114. «ñÒ ဆကဒÛ» nvad-p l (Parsig: nwad puhl or inwar puhl) “the Chinvad Bridge” (Tafa╲╲ul 1969: 121) is the name of a bridge in Zoroastrianism, placed from the summit of d it (Avestan: d ity -) in the middle of the world stretching to the Alburz mountains. The spirits of the dead pass across that bridge in the morning of the fourth day after death. The bridge becomes wide for the righteous and a beautiful girl as the symbol of the righteousness of the dead transfers them safely across the bridge to Paradise. When the vicious are passing, the bridge changes into a sharp razor blade and an ugly woman as the symbol of the wickedness of the dead pulls them off the bridge and throws them into Hell. Windengren supposes that the thought of a bridge across which the spirits pass is of Iranian origin. However, there are also such conceptions, although sligthly different, in northern religions, which means that the concept of a bridge must be essentially an Indo-Germanic idea. The influence of Chinvad Bridge is so extensive that it has even influenced Islamic eschatology (Widengren 1961: 176).



147
114. The word «>ဆÒ» p l is mentioned in the two forms «>ဆÒ» p l and «ñÒ» pul in manuscripts NPN2MO, but the number of p l forms is larger than pul in all of them. This word is mentioned in the pul form in manuscript L. Since the p l form is closer to the Parsig orthographic form: «ñဃဆÒ» puhl, this form has been preserved in the present text. Only the first case of diverging orthographies of p l and pul is pointed out in a footnote. 114-115. This part of the text describing Chinvad Bridge, is strange, because, the bridge is described there as trunk of a tree with many sides, whereas it is clear that the trunk of a tree has a cylindrical form and therefore no sides. 115-116. «ခ Ð ýဒÂ» t -i ustura “shaving razor”. ustura and the verbs from which it is derived, «@ Ð » usturdan and «@ Ð» siturdan “to shave”, are Persian forms of ustarag which is a Parsig word. t -i ustura is a kind of shaving razor. 121. ဆ ÕဒÇ @ ^စ ÕဒÇ ဂ @| Èက »

« xunak b d n kas r ki az n k -i vay mardum n r n k buvad va in nki yak isparm b y “may he be happy whose [own] goodness has become goodness for people, just like the scent of the sweet basil”171. While editing the text, the final part of this sentence “just like the scent of the sweet basil” has been omitted and moved to the footnotes in consideration of the Avestan phrase. 122-124. In the chapter III, beliefs about the first three nights after the death according to Zoroastrianism have been expounded, especially in consideration of the text H d xt Nask. 128-129. «@ဆ ထ ¥Ç ကÁ» jin nat-i zayt n “the paradise of olives”. The first word of the phrase is written as «¥Ç ကÁ» jin nat (paradise), «¥Ç ဒ » xiy nat (pollution), «¥ ကÁ» jan bat (treachery) and «ÀÇ Á» j nib (side). This phrase was probably originally written as «@ဆ ထ ¥ကÁ» jannat-i zayt n (the paradise of olive trees) or «@ဆ ထ ÀÇ Á» j nib-i zayt n (side of the olive trees) which could indicate a sweet fragrance perceived from where the olive trees are. However, «@ဆ ထ » zayt n (olive) has no specific value in the Zoroastrian culture. 130-133. This picture, presenting the beauty of the girl who is the symbol of the good deeds, reminds us of the same picture in b n-yašt that de

scribes the Ardav s ra An hit ( b n-Yašt: XVI.64; XIX.78).172 There are some pictures that depict An hit ’s beauty on Sasanians jugs in the National Museum in Teheran and the Hermitage in Leningrad (Ringbom 1958: 162, 168-169). 137-140. ခ Ù@| ဂ @| Ä Ð ဂ ဆÂ Ä Û ဂ 1⁄4 ဂ @| ÂဆÕဒÇ ? ဆÂ ^ဆÕဒÇ @| 1⁄4 » «^ ^ ဆ ဒÙ ဂ man n kird r-i n k -yi tu-am, n k -tar az n ki man ba ašm-i tu bi-astam, n ki n-g h ki dar g t b d , kard “I am your good deeds. That which you made when you were in the world [is] more beautiful than what I am in your sight”. Perhaps, there is a word missing in this part. The beautiful girl seems to be saying to the man’s spirit: “When you were in the world, you did many good deeds that were more beautiful than the way I appear to you now”. Maybe this is the original structure of this sentence from ancient times. 141. «ဆ » aš (Parsig: ahlaw) righteous; «ဆ » mard-i aš is “a priest who performs religious rites of Zoroastrianism”, for example the ceremony of «?ဆက » baršn m, which is a symbolic washing of the body. 141. « 1⁄2 » xrafstar, pl. «@ 1⁄2 » (xrafstr n), is a Parsig word. xrafstar is a word applied in general for all dangerous and rapacious animals created by Ahr man. Snakes, otters, scorpions, alligators, turtles and toads are considered as xrafstr n, according to the D nkard (DkM 1911: IX.811), whereas, the យaddar Na᠒r, considers snakes, scorpions, flies, ants and rats (យDN 1909: XLIII.2) as the group of xrafstr n. 149-152. The sky is divided in two different ways in Zoroastrian literature. According to the Pahlavi Riv yat, there are three celestial positions between the earth and the sky: the star-station, the moon-station and the sunstation. After that, there is the sky (heaven) where gar dm n “the home of worship” is situated, and that is Ohrmazd’s place. There are 34 thousand farsangs (unit of length equal to 6 kilometers) of distance between each of them (PRDd 1990: XLVI.7). The second division is mentioned in the Bundahišn, according to which there are six grades in the sky. Then, after these six grades, there is Ohrmazd’s place, in an eternal light (IraBd 1956: III.7). Considering the narrations of the text, it appears that the basis of the division in the Ard y-V r f N ma is as same as that of the Pahlavi Riv yat. 152. «@ ÉÅစ Ù» gar ᠒m n, (Avestan: gar .d m na-, Parsig: gar dm n). It is written «@ ÉÅစ Ù» gar ᠒m n, «@ ÉÂစ Ù» gar tm n, «@ Ù» gardm n and «@ Ù» garzm n in New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian. gar ᠒m n means “the home of worshipping”, which is the loftiest paradise, the most brilliant place in the highest heaven, from the sun-station and beyond, to the last degree in the sky, where the place of the essence and the light of God is.
154. « ကÝÐ » amš sfand (Avestan: amပša.spပnta-, Parsig: amahraspand pl. amahraspand n, New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian: « က×Ð » amš spand and « ကÝÐ » amš sfand). The amš spand n are six assistants of

Ohrmazd: Wahman (Bahman), Ardwahišt, Šahrawar, Spandarmad, H ̈rd d and Amurd d. Ohrmazd has created these Holy Immortals of his essence and each one of them carries one of the qualities of Ohrmazd. While creating, Ohrmazd profits from the aid of these Holy Immortals. In addition to this, the six Holy Immortals along with Ohrmazd himself patronize the seven great creations: the sky, the water, the earth, the plants, the quadrupeds, the humn beings and the fire. 156. « င » Mihr (Avestan: mi ra- (Mithra), Parsig: mihr). Mihr is one of the Pre-Zoroastrian gods in Iran. In Zoroastrianism, Mihr is the god of agreement, friendship and love, and the enemy of falsehood (lies) and broken agreements. In Zoroastrianism Mihr is described as the owner of broad pastures, having a thousand ears and ten thousands eyes and watching the entire world. Mihr is the king of all territories and wherever he sets his foot justice will appear. Mihr alongside with Rašn and Sur š is the god who judges the deeds of people in the Other World (MX 1985: I.118-119). One of the Mihr’s other functions is to move around his mace above Hell in order for the dwellers in Hell not to be tormented more than what they deserve (MS.S.P.1191: 139b). In Mihr Yasht the importance of Mihr in Zoroastrianism can be clearly seen: Said Ahura Mazd h to Zarathuštra the Spitamid: ‘When I created grass-land magnate Mithra, O Spitamid, I made him such in worthiness to be worshipped and prayed to as myself, Ahura Mazd h’ (Yašt X ‘Mihir Yašt’ 1959: I.1). 165. «ÚÙ» gaz is an ancient measurement unit in Iran. One of the most ancient works in which this unit, equal to 24 fingers, is mentioned is T r x-i Qum (History of Qum) written by 8asan Šayb n Qum (in 988 A.D.). One gaz is equivalent to one meter according to a regulation of the year 1925 in Iran (Mu‘ n 1984: 3.3300). Instead of gaz, « » araš is used in manuscript N2. araš is a measurement unit that stretches from the elbow to the finger tips. The width of Chinvad Bridge is mentioned as 27 nays in the D dest n D n g (Dd 1998: XX.3). According to the M n Xrad, the width of the Bridge is one farsang (6 kilometers) (MX 1985: II.123). In the D nkard, this width is equal to nine nayza (a short spear), and each nayza is equal to three nays, and a nay is equal to a t r (DkM 1911: IX.809). 165. « စ ဒo » dil r-v r. « ဒo » dil r (Parsig: dilar) means “brave”. It is probable that 1⁄4 ÞÙ»
`
«>ဆÒ စ ဒo gu aštan-i dil r-v r az p l (passing the bridge bravely). I saw how the spirit passed bravely over the bridge and I also crossed the bridge after him 181. «1⁄4Éင » Bahman (Avestan: vohu.manah-, Parsig: wahuman or wahman, New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian: «1⁄4Éဃစ» Vahman, «1⁄4 ဆဃစ» Vah man and «1⁄4Éင » Bahman. Bahman, the first Holy Immortal, is more intimate with Ohrmazd than the others. His functions are to take care of quadrupeds and to lead the spirits of the righteous to the threshold of



150
peds and to lead the spirits of the righteous to the threshold of Ohrmazd (IraBd 1956: XXVI.14). 182. Ð { »
« kurs “stool/chair/throne”. This kurs must be a stool of gold, because, Bahman says to V r f that this is the place, the gar tm n is called «1⁄4ထ ခ Ù» g h-i zarr n “the golden place” and Ð စ Í»
{
« ሁarš va kurs “the empyrean and the throne”. The gold reminds us of the empyrean and the throne of gold in the royal courts of the Sasanid kings. “The king [Xusrau An ̈šaraw n] ordered that a golden stool be given to him [Sayf ibn Yazan] to sit down”. This stool is mentioned in a description of Xusrau An ̈šarw n’s court (A┰m‘ Shaked 1995: VII. 80). In this connection, it is necessary to mention the inscriptions of Tang-i Sarvak in ancient Elymais (south western Iran) in which an Aramaic phrase nሂsyh kwrsyሂ “he who takes/hold the stool” is repeated several times (Henning 1952 Shaked 1995: VII.80). The connection between what V r f describes as kurs in gar tm n, the place of Ohrmazd, and the “holder of a stool” of the inscription of Tang-i Sarvak will appear more clearly if we know that to sit on a special stool has been accompanied with some ritual ceremonies (Bivar and Shaked 1964: 287ff). 182. « Ð စ Í» ሁarš va kurs “the empyrean and the throne” are mentioned in 13th and 59th episodes. These two words are used for /@ ÉÅစ Ù» «@ ÉÂစ Ù gar ᠒m n/gar tm n, that is gar dm n in the Parsig and gar d m na- in Avestan. The translator has changed the gar ᠒m n, which is the highest station in Heaven and the place of Ohrmazd’s light in Zoroastrianism, into ሁarš va kurs that has a very important place in the Muslim faith, perhaps because it was well-known to the masses, both the Muslims and Zoroastrians at the time of the translation. Muqaddas has contemplated the various interpretations and paraphrases of ሁarš and kurs by different groups of Muslims. He declares that ሁarš has been described as the throne of God in the Quran: “and they, the eight angels, carry thy God’s throne upon their shoulders on that Day [the resurrection day]” (Quran 1988: 69.17). Muqaddas says as well, while defining kurs , that kurs is equal to ሁarš according to some [Muslim] traditions; as a pearl in a flat landscape. Many Muslims believe that kurs means just knowledge, and they rely on the Quran that states “his [God’s] throne spreads over all the skies and the grounds” (Quran 1988: 2.255) (Muqaddas 1995: 13.245-248)173. ሁarš va kurs , have been used repeatedly in Iranian mystical (Sufi) literature, especially in the works of Far d-al-D n ᤱA╀╀ r. For example, it can be found in the Il h -N ma: Ð စ စ Í^ ^ ဂ »

It seems that before they used the expression ሁarš va kurs for the Parsig word gar dm n in the Zoroastrian Persian texts, they had used the term ayv n-i yazd n for gar dm n. In a letter from a dihq n (countryman) to Xusrau I it is written: Õထ ÚÇ @ Úထ @ ဆထ ဂ ¥Ð @ ဒÐ ^ Ð @| ¥ င စ»
``
«@ Ü “and Paradise in the Other World is that you can come to God’s court, in the presence of one of the angels” (MS.D43: 36a). In this section the ayv n-i yazd n, located in paradise, corresponds to gar dm n, which is the place of Ohrmazd’s light. 187. « က ¥Ð » dastband. That is the name of a folk dance in the territory of Iran since Elamite times. In a picture painted on an earthenware surface, from the fourth millennium B.C., found in the Sialk hills in K š n (figure 2), a group of people (it is not clear if they are men or women) are performing this folk dance of dasta-band or dast-band (Ghirshman 1938: I.PL.LXXV). The dancers are standing side by side holding hands in this painting. Since there are some signs of the sun and some aquatic birds in the space between the dancers, it is supposed that they may have performed this kind of dance in the plain or meadows to worship the god of the sun, the god of illumination and warmth who rubs off the darkness and terrors of the night from the human heart. In the Ard y-V r f N ma, a group of people is also performing this kind of folk dance in front of musicians and on a riverside in a garden (lines 420-422). Another example of this kind of folk dance, is found in ašma-‘Al and preserved in the Louvre Museum (figure 3), where all the dancers are women ( uk ’ 1965: 47-48). 197. «@ Ü 1⁄2ဒÉဃ» ham stag n (Parsig: ham stag n, in the Zoroastrian Persian and New Persian «@ Ü 1⁄2ဒÉဃ» ham stag n, «@ 1⁄2ဒÉဃ» ham st n and «@ Ü 1⁄2Éဃ» hamistag n) “Limbo”. It is the intermediate space between the earth and the station of the stars, a place similar to this world and the place of those whose good deeds and sins are equal. According to manuscripts NPN2MO, it is written ham st n in the text, whereas, in the Zoroastrian Persian texts hamistag n is also used. Because this heading is only given in manuscript L and there is no other manuscript variant, it has been kept in the orthographic form found in this manuscript.

« (Parsig: tan pas n) means “final body”, i.e. the body which every creature receives at the resurrection at the end of the twelve thousand years of the world. After the resurrection the body will remain in that form forever. 216. « ထ ဒÙ» g t -xar d (Parsig: get g-xr d) means to acquire the rewards in the Other World of the worship that one has performed in this



153
world. It is clearly explained in the យaddar Bundahiš that “the meaning of g ti-xar d is to acquire the Other World in this world” (យDB 1909: XLII.4). 216. « စ ဆÇ» nauz d (Parsig: n g-z d) is a young person, who joins the believers group in the «^ စ ဆÇ» nauz d ceremony, after which he will be regarded as an adult. 217.

« muzd instead of ð{ »
« mužd is recorded. mužd is a dialect variant of the word. However, it is possible that mužd was the form of the word in ancient manuscripts (Kh liq -Mu╀laq 2005: 436). 225. nauz d (Parsig: n g-z d h, New Persian and the Zoroastrian Persian: «^ ဆÇ», nauz d , « Âစ ဆÇ» nauz t and «^ စ ဆÇ» nauz d ). nauz d means “new birth” and means that a Zoroastrian youngster, either a boy or a girl, joins the believers’ group. They wear the holy waist-belt (kust /kušt ) during a religious ceremony when they are 15 years old (ŠnŠ 1969: XIII.2). The Parsis in India call this nauz t festival naojote. 226. «@ ဃ Ù» g h n (Avestan: g , Parsig: g h n) means “hymn”. g h n, is the oldest relic section of the Avesta which remains until the present time. It has been attributed to Zarathustra himself. 228-237. It seems that the tenth episode should take place after the fifth episode, because, the theme of this episode follows logically on the fourth (lines 167-183) and the fifth (lines 184-195). In episodes 4 and 5, firstly Sur š and then Bahman lead V r f watching and worshipping the gar tm n or g h-i zarr n “the golden place”, which is the same as ሁarš va kurs “empyrean and the throne”. 239. «ခ Ù ÉÇ» nam z-g h “place of worship”. « ÉÇ» nam z, in New Persian it means to bow down in reverence.

«! Ú nam z-g h-i rmazd, nam z bar “Pay hommages in front of Ohrmazd!” This sentence is quoted in a disordered manner in all manuscripts.

(Boyce 2001: 254-256). m diy zarm is the first festival of the year in the Zoroastrian calendar, equivalent to mid-spring (the 5th of May). According to the D dest n D n g, the reason for rau an-i m diy zarm is that the best food comes from the products of cattle. Among the products of cattle, milk is the best, and amongst milk products butter/oil is the best, and among the butters/oils the best is that which is obtained in the second month of the year, when Mihr is in the constellation of Taurus, and that month is called Zarmiy in Zoroastrianism. Thus, the butter/oil produced in this month is a paradisical food, which is the best food in the world (Dd 1998: XXX.13). According to the Pahlavi Riv yat Ohrmazd orders the spirit to be fed with “mares’ milk, cream and butter and sweet wine, or butter which is made in spring [rau an-i m diy zarm]. First give him the spring butter” (PRDd 1990: XXIII.17). In addition, in the M n Xrad, the food given to the spirit is rau an-i m diy zarm “spring oil”, which is the best food in the world (MX 1985: I.152, 156). The paradisical food is called « ဆÇ » an š in the Parsig version of the Ard y-V r f N ma and the Zand of Wid wd d. Widengren follows these texts and believes that spring butter or oil is a kind of food of immortality (Widengren 1965: 104). But, an š is a mixture that the S ̈šyans “saviour” will provide after resurrection and will give to all people to be immortal. Thus, the word an š is in my opinion wrongly used instead of rau an-i m diy zarm “spring oil” for the paradisical food in the Ard y-V r f N ma and in the Zand of Wid wd d. An š, is a mixture of immortality, and there is no need for a spirit to get any foodstuff of immortality in Paradise. It is the body which must be immortal by eating an š on resurrection day (£ayb 2003: 389-390). 258-275. This passage shows the importance of the matter of setting fire to wet wood, appropriating a whole chapter of the Ard y-V r f N ma to this subject (12th episode).Thus, in Zoroastrianism, it is a sin to set fire to wet wood. This is also alluded to in brief in the Parsig version (AWN 1872: X.48) when Ard y-V r f protests to dur-yazd because he has called him “wet wood” (Parsig: xw d- zm). To show the importance of the matter, one can also point to a proverb in New Persian which is currently used: ^ Â ?Úဒဃ ဂÛ»
_` «Î? ဂ စ ဆÂ ဂ i h zum-i tar ba tu fur xta-am? (Have I sold you any wet wood?). The meaning of the proverb is “What evil have I done to you? In what way have I hurt you?” (╁arvat-Inz b -naž d 1998: 898). This idea probably originated in ancient Iranian culture, when trees were respected and no one was permitted to cut and burn a live tree.175 Therefore, it was a sin to set wet wood on fire.
260. «¥ င¤ထ » Urd bihišt (Avestan: arပta.vahišta-, Parsig: ardwahišt). Ohrmazd created Urd bihišt, the Holy Immortal, from his own wisdom. Urd bihišt is the first Holy Immortal who praises Ohrmazd. To take care of
175 Signs of this tradition can be seen in some part of Iran now (‘An ┰ir 1995: 60-62).



155
the fire is the most important function of Urd bihišt in the world. Anyone who offends the fire and treats the fire with disrespect will be Urd bihišt’s enemy. 264-265. When Ohrmazd intends to send the fire to the world, the fire disagreed and said that people would not have a behavior befitting it. Finally, Ohrmazd got Urd bihišt assigned to protect the fire, and then the fire accepted to be sent to the world (PRDd 1990: XLVI.30-33; យDB 1909: XVIII). Urd bihišt, the Holy Immortal, points to this same matter in the text. 293. «@ Âစ ÏÐ» sax vat n. This word is constructed as a nominalised adjective formed from « စ ÏÐ» sax vat with the plural ending. This is not a common way of nominalising this word, and the form sax vatmand n (as it is also found in Modern New Persian) would have been expected. 309. «? ထ ဆà @ ထ ထ » dar z r-i š n qaum d dam “I saw below them a people”. The actual location of this place is not totally clear. z r-i š n “below them”, means under ‘the station of the Souls of the Munificent and the Generous’ (The Fourteenth Episode). However, the station of the Souls of the Munificent and the Generous is not specified either. 319. «@ က1⁄2ထ » m zdayasn n (Parsig: m zd sn n) “Mazdeans”, “Mazdaworshippers” and “Mazdayasnians”, i.e. Mazda-worshippers who practise Zoroastrianism. The sg. form of this word is «1⁄41⁄2ထ Ú » mazdayasn, Parsig: m zd sn, which means “adhering to Zoroastrianism”. 325. «ခ ဆ » xwarra (Avestan: xvarᝅnah-, Parsig: xwarrah, New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian: «ခ ဆ » xwarra, «ခ » farra and « » farr. xwarra is one of Ohrmazds’s creations and a heavenly power. Three kinds of xwarra are mentioned in Avestan texts: « က Ù Ç ^ခ ဆ » xwarra-yi n giriftan “a non-acquired xwarra”, which is related to the M bads (the Zoroastrian priests). « Ç ဒ ^ခ ဆ » xwarra-yi kiy n (the kingly khwarra), which is related to the kings. This xwarra appears in various forms, such as a hawk, a gazelle and fire, and gives the one who has gained it great power. ^ခ ဆ » «@ Ù | xwarra-yi z dag n (the freemen’s xwarra), is only available to Iranians, and non-Iranians are not able to acquire this kind of xwarra. In later texts, farra is used in different senses such as chance, fortune and wealth (M rfaxr y 1987: 98-99). 325-326. «^ က စ ခ ဆ » xwarra mand (Parsig: xwarrah mand ). Manuscripts NPMOL record this word as «^ က ဆဃ ဆ » xwarh mand , but manuscripts PN2 write it «^ က ခ ဆ » xwarramand . Anyway, «^ က စ ခ ဆ » xwarramand is the correct form of the word in Zoroastrian Persian if the Parsig form is taken into consideration. 340-341. «Óo ငÛ Èထ ဃ ? ထ @ Ü 1⁄2 Ç» nišastag n d dam har yak dar ah r b liš “I saw people seated each one on four cushions”. The Sasanian kings used to sit on several cushions and put some at their back, to recline. This can be seen in the iconography of a Sasanian bowl (Ghrishman 1962: 218, fig. 259) and on some bezels as well (idem: 242, figs. 296, 267), where such intaligos are engraved (Shaked 1995: VII.77-78). The kings’ method of



156
using cushions while sitting has also survived in post-Islamic times. The Chronicles of Har t (written about 1320 A.D.) write in this way about one of the kings: Óo ငÛ Äo Í ခ Ò ဂ စ »

In the last five pages after the text is finished in manuscript N (the basic manuscript), a short part of the text is re-written on folio 151a. This part is equivalent to lines 347-365 in our edited version and it is marked by an asterisk (*) at its beginning and end. The differences between this part and the way it appears in the text as found in all manuscripts are indicated by the means of the sign Nᥘ in the footnotes. Re-writing a text, partly or totally, has some previous records in both the Parsig and the Zoroastrian Persian manuscripts. The part R z Ohrmazd m h farward n “the Ohrmazd day of Farward n” is re-written first on pages 7378, then for the second time on pages 112-117 of the M.U.29 manuscript in Parsig (Naw b 1976 M.U.29:1). Some parts of a text have been rewritten in another section of this manuscript, too. For example, pages 27-28 are re-written on pages 33-34, and pages 95-96 on pages 98-100 (Mazd p r 1999: 282, 153). 350. «@ » rad n, sg. form of the word is « » rad, (Avestan: ratu-, Parsig: rad), pl. rad n. This word is translated as “chief” and “master” (MacKenzie 1990: 70). According to the Š yest n -Š yest, it seems that rad is a spiritual authority in Zoroastrianism who deals with judgment (ŠnŠ 1969: XIII.29), because a person confesses his sins in front of a rad, then the rad will judge him and his acts (Kotwal 1969: 49). 365. The meaning of this sentence « Ç ¤Ç Á ဂ 1⁄4 စ» va man ba j nib m kardand “and they led me to a side” and the another variant ထ Á ဂ 1⁄4 စ» « Ç va man ba j yi m kardand “and they led me to a place” is not clear to the editor. 364-365. - ¤Ç Á ဂ 1⁄4 စ င Üထ Èထ ÕဒÇ @ ? ထ @ Ç @| 1⁄4 @ဆÛ» « Ç n man n zan n r d dam ba-d n n k , yak az d gar bihtar, va man ba j nib m kardand “When I saw those women with that beauty, one better than the other, and they brought me to the side”.

`
« tars-i ast d n “fright of the grave”. The ceremony of tars-i ast d n means that the relatives of a dead person say prayers for three



157
days beside his/her bed or at the place where he/she has died ( š dar 1992: 215). 375. «@ ဆ Ð » ast d n (Parsig: ast d n) “ossuary” is a square cavity excavated in rocks of mountains, where they put the bones of the dead and then cover upon the hole. 375. «¥Ð Éဃ ခ စ » dav zdah-hum st (Parsig: dav zdah-hum st) “twelvehumast”. hum st is a ceremony of saying prayers performed for the sake of the quick or the dead. Four kinds of hum st are mentioned in the N rangist n: one-hum st, two-hum st, ten-hum st and twelve-hum st. dav zdahhum st (twelve-hum st) is a recitation of the Yasna and the Wid wd d during 264 days in paying homage to 22 gods (R šid-Mu9a┰┰il 1990: 93-94). According to the យaddar Na᠒r, only women should perform this religious duty of dav zdah-hum st (twelve hum st) (យDN 1909: LXVIII). 395. «1⁄4ထ Éဃ» ham d n (Parsig: ham g-d n). According to the Š yest n Š yest (ŠnŠ 1969: XVII.4), it seems that ham d n is the name of all prayers done in the first three days after someone’s death (Kotwal 1969: 109). 396. «@ စ ခ Ç » zinda-rav n “whose soul is alive” is devotion accompanied by a special ritual ceremony that every Zoroastrian should do in his/her lifetime to prevent any damage to his/her soul (យDN 1909: LVIII). 397. ဒဃ»
« _ h rbad (Parsig: h rbad, pl. «@ ဒဃ» h rbad n), “teacher”. h rbad is a Zoroastrian religious leader who also fulfills his duty as a teacher. It is mentioned in the យaddar Bundahiš that the parents nourish the body of the child but it is the h rbad that feeds his soul (យDN 1909: XXIX.12). 397. The word «@ဆက » akn n “now” is mentioned after the verbal form « Ç ခ ဆ » b da-and “they have been” in manuscripts NPN2 but as «ဆက » akn in manuscript M. The meaning of the sentence under consideration indicates that the word akn n here must be a mistake by the copyist. For this reason, this word is taken to the footnotes and instead «ဂ » ki has been inserted to complete the sentence. 401. « စ Éဃ» ham z r (ham z r) is a brazier in which aloeswood and other fragrant substances are burnt. In addition to this, ham z r are persons who recite verses of the Avesta in chorus and promise to do good deeds (Sur šiy n 1977: 185). Here ham z r means to join in getting rewards of good deeds. 410. « င @ ထ » #r n-šahr (Parsig: ar n-šahr) is the name for all territory of Iran in the Sasanian period. The Iranian Bundahišn or the Great Bundahišn is the most ancient text in which the word #r n-šahr is used to denote Ir n (IraBd 1956: XXXIII.1-26). 423. « Çဆဃ|» h n k and in N2 « ကoဆဃ» hauln k . Both manuscripts are, in my opinion, wrong, since both adjectives have negative connotations. Ard y-V r f asks about the happiness and prosperity of a nation and therefore one would expect a positive adjective. It might be « ÜÇ ဆဃ|» ahuv nag a



158
word that means «ဂÇ စဆဃ|» h vaš na “sincere”. However, this is just a surmise. 425. « 3⁄4» ᜸aš r t / « 3⁄4» hašar t “insects”. This word is found in the form haš r t in manuscripts NN2MO, but in the form « 3⁄4» hašar t just in manuscript P. In some Zoroastrian Persian manuscripts, for example, in numerous texts in manuscript MS.S.P.47, the short Persian vowels a, i and u are sometimes represented by the letters alif, ya and v v (‘plene writing’). Accordingly the first « `ïo » alif in « 3⁄4» is possibly an orthographic representation of (short) a. 443. « ကÝÐ » isfand rmad (Avestan: spပnt . rmaiti-, Parsig: spandarmad, New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian: «Þ က×Ð » ispand rma , « က×Ð » ispand rmad and « ကÝÐ » isfand rmad. Isfand rmad is Ohrmazd’s daughter and she is the mother of all creatures. Her function is to take care of the earth. 462. « က×ÐဆÙ» g spand “sheep” is written g spand in manuscripts N2MO, and by both « က×ÐဆÙ» g spand and « ကÝÐဆÙ» g sfand in manuscript P, and as « ကÝÐဆÙ» g sfand in manuscript N. Since the form g spand (with majhul pronunciation) is identical with the Parsig form g spand, this form is used in the text and the other form g sfand is moved to the footnote. 516. kadxud (Parsig: kadag-xwad y) “husbandmen”. In today’s New Persian kadxud means someone who takes care of the affairs of a village, i.e. headman for a village. But kadag-xwad y in Parsig and kadxud in the Zoroastrian Persian means lord, king or husbandman. Firdaus says: ^ @ ငÁ ဆဒ ^ Á ¥ Ð @စ Ç ခဆ ဂ 1⁄4ဒ 1⁄2ÏÇ Kay mar╂ became king (kadag-xwad y) of the world, first he made himself a place in the mountain (Mu‘ n 1984: 3.2921). 521-522. This phrase is recorded as « Ç ထ Ù Üထ Õထ @ ထ Â» t š n b yakd gar b z m gard dand “until they came back with each other”, in manuscripts NPMO. However, it is written, « Ç ^ Üထ Õထ @ ထ Â» t š n b yakd gar b z m kardand “Until they were playing with each other”, in manuscript N2. Because this latter form of the phrase fits the meaning of the main sentence better, it is used in the text and the first form is moved to a footnote. 518. « စ စ » rvar is a Parsig word (urwar) meaning “plant”. The orthographic form « စ စ » (plene writing) instead of « စ » may have been preferred because it makes it impossible to read the word as arvar or irvar. « စ စ » has has been used in the text and the other form moved to the footnotes. 532. «@ ထဆÜÇ Á» j dang y n, sg. «ဆÜÇ Á» j dang (Parsig: j dag-g w n) means “defender”. The j dang collects everyting that is given to M bads and Dast rs in the fire temple and give it to the poor (យDN 1909: XXII.1-3). 542. «@ Â| စ @ |» dar n va taš n. There are three kinds of fire in Zoroastrianism and in order of importance they are «? င ÓÂ|» taš-i Bah



159
r m, «@ | ÓÂ|» taš-i ၇dar n and «ခ Ù ÓÂ|» taš-i D dg h. Here the expression va taš n seems to denote the fires of Bahr m and D dg h. The reason why taš-i ၇dar n is mentioned separately may be that it is the fire under consideration in this part, since V r f was travelling to the Other World from the ᝷dar n fire-temple (line 38). 552-574. @ ဆÙဆÐ È စ »

« r d-i ašk-i s gv r n“the river of the mourners’ tears” is the first chapter in which the situation in Hell is mentioned without reference to a specific place in Hell. According to the text, all spirits should pass across the river. Everybody either passes with difficulty or drowns in this river depending on how much he has wept for the dead. There is no complete picture of the river in the text. This river is not placed in Hell according to the text, but it must necessarily be somewhere between Paradise and Hell, and spirits have to pass across it. However, as it is said in the text, Hell is placed under Chinvad Bridge and in the vicinity of Paradise. There is no other recalling of the mourners’ ‘river of tears’ anywhere in other mythological texts or other Iranian Zoroastrians sources, than what is found here in Ard y-V r f N ma. However, resistance against mourning and lamenting is praised in Avesta: I eulogize the act and the good-nature I eulogize the good-nature and the act For resistance against the darkness For resistance against mourning and lamenting (Yasna: LXXI.17).176 In M n Xrad the land of mourning and weeping is seen as an afflicted land (MX 1985: V.1-13). For this reason, the r nw z lands (Avestan: Airyanပm.va j -), that is where people do not mourn and weep, is called a better land (idem: 24-29, 43). A great deal of ancient Iranian documents have eulogized happiness in contrast to weeping and crying, which are disgraceful and prohibited acts.177 In the Ta kirat ul-Auliy ሂ, one of the most famous works of Sufism, there is a clear description of the Iranian lamentation in post-Islamic times and of the Zoroastrians’ avoidance of mourning and weeping: ÚဒÇ ^ ¤Ù . က စ ¥ထÚ Â ဂ ÆÌ . ဒÐ ¤ဒË àစ 〠 ¤Í ဂ ¥Ð ñÆÇ» ဂ က @| ¥1⁄2ÏÇ စ Ð ^စ ဂ ¤ဒË @ဆÛ ဂ ဆ @| က :¥ÝÙ 〠 ¤Í စ ¥

ters a misfortune, he who is a wise man does in the first day what he will do three days later’. ᤱAbdull h said: ‘Write his statement down, because it is a wise saying.’” (ᤱA╀╀ r 1905: 1.185-186; £ayb 1994: 28). This saying both indicates three days’ time of lamentation among Iranians and clearly shows the prohibition and reprobation of lamentation among Zoroastrians (£ayb : idem). In យaddar Na᠒r, there is a description of this ‘river of tears’ as well: “The tears will change into a river at the Chinvad Bridge” (យDN 1909: LXXXXVI.2). However, this description does not help us understand the issue of this river. In many of the myths of the ancient world there is a river in the Other World, situated in hell. According to Akkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian and Indian myths, a river, or even some large rivers are flowing in the underground world. According to Scandinavian myths, there is a large river in hell called Gjöll, which flows between the world of the living and dead (Snorres Edda 1978: I.3, 48). A bridge of gold, constructed over this river, is called Gjallarbrú and a person by the name of Modgunn is the guardian there (Snorres Edda 1978: I.48). According to Greek myths there are four rivers in Hell,. One of these four rivers is called Kokytos (K  ́ó ) which means the ‘river of the teardrops’ (Schlapbach 1999: 6.638). To prohibit people from crying for their dead, is a concept found among other peoples and religions as well.179 579-580. ? ထ ဂ ဂ Äဃ ဆ ^ ထ ဂ ဂ စ ?ဆ í စ Äက ဂÛ .1⁄4 ^ စ ^ » «? ခ Ç É ñဒo 1⁄2 ငကÂ .?

And I have no companion with me.

They keep [me] away from [their] family and tribe. The community which I wish to join does not satisfy me Nor [do] the deceitful tyrants of the land. How shall I satisfy Thee, O Wise Ahura? (Yasna: XLVI.1).180
179 For information on the tradition to weep for the dead among adherents of different religions, including Armenians, Mandeans, Muslims and Copts, and the prohibition of this tradition by religious leaders, the reader may refer to Meier (1973). 180 Translation by Humbach 1991: I.167. See also Geldner 1886-1896; Westergaard 1852-54: I.83.



161
Just the first line of this part of Yasna 46 is mentioned in the Parsig version (XVII.5) of the Ard y-V r f N ma. Gignoux believes that the form mentioned in the Parsig version is a free citation of this same passage in the Yasna (Gignoux 1984: 171). 589. « စ» v xtar (Parsig: ab xtar). « » ab xtar, « စ» w xtar and « » axtar, means “north” in Iranian mythology, the winter place (IraBd 1956: XXVIII.3). 606. «Äဃ ðÙ» gažduhm (Parsig: gazdum or gazdumb, New Persian: každum). gažduhm is recorded as a variant of každum (Muᤱ n 1984: 3.3313). It seems that this variant is more ancient than každum. gažduhm may be a dialectical form of the word. 608. «@ ထÚÙ» gaz dan “sting”. This word is written «@ ထð » kaž dan (= «@ ထðÙ» gaž dan) in manuscript P, which is pointed out in a footnote. It is possible that gaž dan is a dialectal form of the word or even a more ancient form of it. However, this form of the word is not recorded in any dictionary. 612. « àဆÝÂ» tafavvuq (exalting onself/superiority/ascendancy). This word is written « à ÝÂ» tafarruq ‘distinction’, in all manuscripts except manuscript L, in which there is an obvious mistake. The word tafarruq would not give a sensible meaning: “Today, I must be distinct to others, for how can I know what will come tomorrow?” but with tafavvuq instead of tafarruq the meaning will be reasonable. “Today, I must be superior to others, for how can I know what will come tomorrow?” This word is written as « Ç Ç» n n in manuscript L, which is meaningless in this context. Thus, it has been emended in the edition with respect to the sense of the sentence. 619. «1⁄4 ဃ » ahriman (Parsig: Ahriman (Nyberg 1974: II.11) or Ahreman (MacKenzie 1990: 7), in some Parsig texts mentioned as gan[n] g m n g, is one of the two incipient spirits of the world, in Avestan called «ဆကဒ ခ ÜÇ » angr .mainyu-, which means a warlike spirit (Yasna XLV: 2). He is the symbol of ugliness, wickedness, falsehood and darkness, and his place is in Hell. Ahr man, who is the leader of all demons, fights permanently against Ohrmazd in a combat that will result in Ohrmazd’s victory at the end of the world. The Pazand and New Persian form of the word is harman, Ahraman and Ahriman (Nyberg 1974: II.11). This name is found in manuscripts NPN2MO in two forms: «1⁄4 ဃ » Ahraman and «1⁄4 ဃ|» hraman or hirman. It is written «1⁄4Éထ ဃ » Ahr man in manuscript L. Firdaus used the forms hirman and Ahraman in the Š hn ma (Kh liq -Mu╀laq 1986: 253) as well. Since the form Ahraman is found in the basic manuscript, namely N, it is the form retained in the edited text and the other forms are moved to the footnotes. Some researchers of the religious history, among them S. Hartman (Hartman 1976: 1-8) and G. Widengren (Widengren 1969: 440-455), believe



162
that the conception of Satan as an evil power in Judaism and Christianism is directly influenced by the Iranian Ahriman. 635. « ဃ Üထ Á» the letter «^» is used to indicate the presence of an iᡂ fa. 643. ဆ @ ဆÏ Ð = Ù ဂ @ ကÛ»
_
« in n ki gurg ustux n xwarad “... As a wolf eats bone...”. The Parsig version has dog instead of wolf, which seems to be more proper. 648. It is written «¥Ýò @ ဒ စ » dar d zaxiy n ᠀ifat in all three manuscripts NPN2. The writing dar d zaxiy n ᠀ifat is probably due to a misunderstanding or a hasty writing on the part of the copyists. It has been emended in the edited text. 648-649. « က ¥Ýò @ ဒ စ [ ဃ@|]» [ n-h ] dar d zaxiy n ᠀ifat m raftand. The end part of this sentence is written in the same way in all manuscripts. However, it seems as if this is an incorrect form of [ ဃ@|]» « က ¥Ýò 1⁄4ထ စ [ n-h ] dar d zax ba n ᠀ifat m raftand “[they] were walking in hell in this manner”, which is in accordance with the meaning of the whole sentence. Thus, the sentence is edited in this way. 649-650. In all manuscripts, this sentence is written in this form @ စ 1⁄4ထ » «Î Ç ခ ဆ ဂ က 1⁄2ဒ n rav n-i k st-and ki b m r b da-and “whose souls are these that have been with a snake (= snake-like)”. But the sentence structure gives at hand that this should have been written with « က 1⁄2ဃ» hastand “are” instead of « Ç ခ ဆ » b da-and “have been”. It has been emended accordingly in the edition. 651-652. In all manuscripts, the sentence «¥Ð ခ ဆ @ ထ @ စ @ဆက » akn n rav n-i š n b m r b da-ast “Now, their souls have been snake-like” is found in this form, whereas it seems that the verb «¥Ð » ast “is” at the end of the sentence is enough and that, the participle «ခ ဆ » b da “have been” is superfluous. Thus, it is omitted in the edited version. 679. 1⁄2{ »
« kust , (Parsig: kust g “holy waistband”). kust is a kind of belt, woven of 72 strings spun of sheep’s wool. Zoroastrians wear it as a holy waistband after they are 15 years old. In the edition it is written « » kušt following manuscripts NPN2MO. This heading is found only in manuscript L, and since 1⁄2{ »
« kust is used in Zoroastrian Persian as well, it is in the edition kept in this orthographic form. Concerning the importance of wearing the holy waistband kust it is written “Whoever wears the kust has gone away from realm of the Devil (Ahriman) and come into Ohrmazd’s realm” (យDN 1909: X. 5). It seems that fastening the kust (holy waistband) was current in Iran even before Zarathustra. According to The Reign of Jamš d, Sur š asks Jamš d to fasten the kust (MS.S.P.38: 116). It is also mentioned in the Wiz dag h
Z dspram that Amš spand Bahman (Bahman the Holy Immortal) led Zarathustra, when he was fifteen years old, to put on the kust (WZad 1993: XIII.2). 684-685; 704. The Zoroastrians made much fuss about walking with one shoe only. The same prohibition can be found in Islam as well. For example,



163
it is recommended that if someone’s shoelace is torn, one should take the other shoe off until the first shoe also is fixed (Goldziher 1896: 50). It is not yet clear why the Zoroastrians prohibited walking about with one shoe only. However, it seems that there is an Arabic expression for this act, that is ^ » «@ ဒ o ziyyu l-šay᠐ n “Satan’s clothing fashion”, which seems to fit nicely with the Zoroastrian concept (Shaked 1995,: XII.151-152). 686. « » xurd d (Avestan: haurvat t-, Parsig: hord d). xurd d is the guardian for the water, and thus also for cultivation of the earth. 686. « » amurd d (Avestan: amပrပt t-, Parsig: amurd d). amurd d is the symbol for immortality, the guardian of the plants. 695. «@ ×Ðစ » r sp -kardan. In Parsig r sp g means “whore”, and r sp g h, means “whoredom” (MacKenzie 1990: 72). The corresponding verb is «@ ^ Ù ×Ðစ » r sp -gar -kardan in New Persian. However, this verb is found in the form of r sp -kardan both in the present text and in the យaddar Na᠒r (LXVIII), and in Zoroastrian Persian as well. 697-705. The sins mentioned in this episode are mentioned previously, in the thirty-third episode, as well (678-688), but the punishment for the sins vary in the different episodes. 704-705. Possibly the Zoroastrian reason for the prohibition to urinate while standing is that this causes too much pollution to the earth. This same prohibition occurs in Islam, and it is also mentioned in Jewish writings. It seems that the reason for this prohibition in Islam and Judaism is to avoid the risk of self-pollution by urine (Shaked 1995: XII.152). 718. «ÚဒÝà» qaf z was a unit of measuring weight and volume of grain (wheat and barley) and cereals (peas and beans). The volume of qaf z was varying in different areas and cities. qaf z was also a unit of yardstick. It is mentioned in the R s la-yi mu‘arrab t that the word qaf z is an Arabicized form of kaf z (Dihxud 1963: 84.384-385). 737. «@ » zaf n. This word is found both as «@ » and «@ » zab n in various manuscripts. The form «@ » zab n is in all cases changed to the oldest form «@ » zaf n in the edited text, and the other form «@ » zab n is moved to the footnotes. 762-771. « ဆÇ စ » Dav n s (Parsig: Daw nus). See appendix. « Ç » Danus, in manuscripts N2L is an error or possibly an abridged form of « ဆÇ စ » Daw n s mentioned in the Parsig version. This name is written « Çဆထ» Y nis in manuscripts NPMO, which probably is a mistake by the scribes. Therefore the form Dav n s from the Parsig version is retained in the edited text and the other forms are moved to the footnote. 763. «1⁄4ငÙ » ažgahan (Parsig: ajgah n and ašgah n, New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian: «@ » ažk n, «@ င » ažkah n, «@ ငÙ » ažgah n, «1⁄4င » ažkahan and «1⁄4ငÙ » ažgahan) means “lazy”. This word is used as an adjective for Daw nus/Daw ns, in the Parsig version of the Ard y-W r f N ma (AWN 1872: XXXII.1).



164
812-820. The dog is the most valuable animal in Zoroastrianism. According to Herodotus “the Magians kill with their own hands every creature, save only dogs and men” (Herodotus 1920: I.140). According to Bundahišn, the dog is known as a cherished animal and it annihilates the demons (dr j; Parsig: druž) and pains (IraBd 1956: XXIV.51). According to យaddar Na᠒r, whenever someone eats bread, he should put aside three morsels of that bread to feed the dogs. People are also prohibited from beating and molesting dogs (យDN 1909: XXXI.1-4). In the early days of Islam, dogs were permitted even in the mosque. However, later on, perhaps Muslims felt that they should be different somehow from Zoroastrians and therefore they changed this viewpoint (Goldziher 1900: 284ff.). 818. « Ç ÑÐ» sag-i m n . This term is copied from the Parsig form sag m n-b n n. Bahar has translated it as «@ Ç ဂÇ ÑÐ» sag-i x na-b n n “the guardian dog of the house” (Bah r 1996: 333). In manuscript N « ÜÐ» sag “a dog” is written instead of sag-i m ni. Thus m n is omitted there. The whole phrase sag-i m ni is also omitted in manuscript N2. It seems as if the scribe has found it out of place when copying sag of manuscript N without any adjective, thus he has decided to omit it. «^» in the end of « ÜÐ» sag can be the kasra-yi iᡂ fa. 824. «@ Ç စ » r zb n n is the plural form of the word «@ စ » r zb n, which means “guardian” and “executioner”. 842. « Ïဒဃ» h xr is a Parsig word (hixr) meaning “excrement” and “impure matter”. This word is written « 3⁄4» ᜸aštar in manuscripts NN2O, « 1⁄2 » xasr in manuscript P, and « 3⁄4» ᜸aštar the first time in manuscript M, and then « Ôဒဃ» h r at the margin of folio 85a. It seems that the scribes did not know the meaning of the word. This word is edited as hixr in accordance with the Parsig version. The closest form to this one is that of manuscript M. The other forms are only found in the footnote. 844. «?ဆက » baršn m “the major purification ritual” (Parsig: baršn m) is the most important purification ritual to clean the body in Zoroastrianism. During the ceremony, all body limbs are washed one by one three times, under the care of a m bad (priest) and in conformity with religious rules. After this, the ablated person should spend nine days in a room all by himself. During this time, he is washed in a simpler manner three times more. 867. @ ကထ Á @ဆÛ Ç ခ ဂ Ù ဂ ?ဆà 1⁄4ထ »
{
« n qaum ba garm ba šuda-and n jud-d n n “These people went to the bath-house as unbelievers”. The Zoroastrians were prohibited from going to the baths of non-Zoroastrians. This strictness survived in post-Islamic times as well, because according to the Riv yat-i H m t-i Ašawahišt n: “The Muslim’s bath is absolutely polluted and unclean, [...] going to the Muslim’s bath and bathing there is prohibited for Zoroastrians” (REA 1980: XIX.5-6). In this same manner, Muslims also believed that the water might carry with it uncleanness of the Zoroastrians.



165
Thus they did not allow the Zoroastrians to use the baths of Muslims (Choksy 1997: 128). However, it is possible that this episode has been added later, in the times of Arab Muslim sovereignty. In Parsig texts concerning religious matters of this period, among them Riv yat-i H m t-i Ašawahišt n (I.1, IV.1-2), a new expression «1⁄4ထ Ù » agd n is applied instead of 1⁄4ထ {Á»
« jud-d n, which means Zoroastrian converts to Islam. 867. 1⁄4ထ {Á»
« jud-d n is a non-Zoroastrian person, and even in some cases an irreligious and a heathen. 883-894. In manuscript M the part in the lines 883-894 that is marked by two asterisks is missing. In view of the character of the handwriting of the document, it seems that just one folio of this manuscript is missing. 896. « စ စ င » mihr va dur j “contract” and “lie, deceit” is written « စ င » mihr va durj in manuscripts NN2MOL and « င » mihr durj in manuscript P. Both of them are variants of a Parsig word, mihr-druž (Avestan: mi r .drug-) (Nyberg 1974: II.133). It seems as if both these forms of the word are correct. MacKenzie has recorded both Parsig forms of the word; that is mihr-dr z and mihr druj in meaning of “contract-breaker” (MacKenzie 1990: 56). But Tavadia has transcrbed it as mihr n-druž[ih] and has written the Pazand form of this word as mihr druja. (Tavadia 1930: 135). 925. «@ É ကÝÐ» Sfantam n (Avestan: spit ma-, Parsig: spit m n), that is the name of Zarathustra’s eighth ancestor, and his family name is Sfantam n. n is a derivational suffix indicting relation in Parsig, as in zar r n and p pag n. This name is recorded in the forms «@ É ကÝÐ» sifantam n, «@ É က×Ð » Ispantam n and «@ É ကÝÐ » Sfantam n in New Persian and Zoroastrian Persian. 930. Following the sentence « o Â ^ <စ> | ခ ဆÉÇ ဂ ဆ 1⁄4ဒကÛ > ဆ3⁄4 စ» va a᜸v l in n b d ki nam da mad <va> az xwad -yi ta‘ l the word «¥ÉÂ» tammat is written above the phrase « o Â ^ » xwad -yi ta‘ l in the in the space between the lines in manuscript L (MS.L: 50b). This indicates that the original text of the Ard y-V r f N ma, finished already here, in the viewpoint of scrib of manuscript L, but either the scribes or perhaps the translators of the text entered the prayer and the penitential after into the text. However, surprisingly this addition is found only in manuscript L which seems to be the latest manuscript of Ard y-V r f N ma. But, it seems more correctly that the original text should have been finished by the sentence which is previous to the sentence mentioned by the scribe of manuscript L that is, the text had been finished in line 929. Since, the sentences after that are not connected with the original text. 931. «ခðထစ|» v ža means “clean, pure, pure as gold”. This word is found in the Zoroastrian Persian version (MS.S.P.1191: 91a) of «@ ဆ ကဃ ခ ÚÇ Ò» p nzdah hunar-i m bad n “The Fifteen Arts of M bads”. v ža is written «ဂÔထစ|» v a in line 284. 931. « ခ ÜÇ ဃ ÞÍ စ ဃဠ ဂÉဃ Çစ » xud vand m r az hama-yi bal -h va ሁa b-ha nig h d rad “May God keep us from all misfortunes



166
and punishments”. This is the last sentence of manuscript M. Since, there are only few lines following this sentence in other manuscripts, manuscript M lacks only one folio. 931-937. Sometimes in Zoroastrian-Iranian works; a part of a text is chosen to be added to the end part of another text, if their themes are similar. The part found at the end of the Ard y-V r f N ma has the same structure as the Zoroastrian pet t-n mag. Another pet t-n mag, more or less with the same form and theme, following the 100th episode, is mentioned at the ending part of the យaddar Bundahiš as well (យDB: 177). Adding a part of a work to the ending part of another one is not restricted to the Zoroastrian Persian version of the Ard y-V r f N ma. It is observed also in the Ohrmazd pad harwisp g h h, where the ending part of the N rangist n is addedd (Aša 2002‘b’: 44, 55, 73). The above-mentioned ending part is found in the sixth book of the D nkard as well (idem: 25). The influence of this same style can also be seen in the addition of some traditions and verses to the beginnings and endings of Iranian Islamic texts. 936. Ó _Á_ »
« ajaš and Ó _ _ »
« axaš. These two words seem to be misspellings of the Parsig word of ÓÏ_ _ »
« abaxš, which means “repentant, regretful”. Since this word is found both as ajaš and axaš in other Zoroastrian Persian texts as well, for example in the pet t r n (Iranian confession) (T.30=N: 239b-241a), it has been kept as it stands in this text. The doubling could originate from the loss of the b and a consequent uncertainty about this word. This word is recorded as «Ó » af xš in the យaddar Bundahiš, and as Ó စ_ »
« av xš in a variant copy (យDB 1909: LX.3). In the conclusion of the pet t paš m n h (confession for penitence), which is known as pet t durb d, it reads as follows: az h n vin h h abaxš, paš m n pad pet t hem “I regret and repent of [my] sins and I am penitent” (Aš9a327.00«2Ä‘ÝaÒ’:စ2»91v)a. pataftam “and I have committed intentionally”. In the Zoroastrian Persian versions of Patat-N ma, this verb is in most editions found in the form «Ä Ý Ò ဂ » bi pataftam or «Ä Ò ဂ » bi patatam in the last sentence of the text. In any case, the form of va pataftam, which is found in Ard y-V r f N ma is also grammatically correct. 937. «¥Ý Ò» pataft. pataft or «¥ Ò» patat is, like baršn m, the symbol of cleaning the body to purify the spirit symbolically. 938. «Äထ à ခ » Murd d m h-i qad m “the ancient month of Murd d”. Iranian months have been in use in the Iranian calendar since the solar year was made official in 1925. However, there were generally two kinds of chronometry for the Iranian calendar earlier: the first is called Jal l and the other one was the Qad m “ancient”. For example, they wrote the month of Farvard n twice in calendars; firstly as Farvard n-i Jal l “Jalal ’s Farvard n” in a sub-column of the Jal l months and secondly as Farvard n-i qad m “Ancient Farvard n” in a sub-column of ancient months. The ancient months were adopted based on the Ancient Iranian Calendar, which was current before Malik-š h (1073-1092) of the Salj q dynasty. However, in



167
spite of the introduction of the Jal l Calendar (introduced in 1078) which was current after Malik-š h, the ancient calendar was in use as well. Zoroastrians of Iran and India (the Parsis) even use it currently. Even Muslims in some parts of Iran still use this calendar. The ancient months made up an incomplete year where every month had 30 days and there were totally 360 days in a year. To complete the year, five days called «ခ ထ ^ဂíကÒ» panja-yi duzd da (the lost five days) “epagomenæ” were added to the end of the final month of the year (Taq z da 1977: 4-5). 938. The name of the work is given as the Ard y-V r f N ma at the beginning of the text besides in manuscripts N, P, N2 and O. For this reason, while editing the text, the word ‘Ard y’ was added to ‘V r f N ma’ at the ending line and written in square brackets: [Ard y]-V r f N ma.

VIII. The Zoroastrian Persian Version in Comparison with the Parsig Version
The Zoroastrian Persian and Parsig versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma are of the same origin, and they are, on the whole, similar in content. This does not mean that they are similar word for word. Furthermore, they differ considerably in some passages. Haug and West note the differences between the Ard y-V r f N ma versions in the preface, and in their view the original story probably lacked a preface. Furthermore, because there is no written date for either of the two versions, later authors attributed the text of the preface to later Zoroastrians clerics, whose intention was to solve problems of Zoroastrianism in ritual and belief (Haug-West 1872: Lxxiii). In comparing the Zoroastrian Persian and Parsig versions of the texts, it will be shown that in some places the differences between the two texts are not fewer than the differences between the prefaces.181 The content of the two texts of the Ard y-V r f N ma are sometimes similar, sometimes the resemblance is smaller and sometimes they are entirely different from each other. The similarity of the two versions can be divided into four degrees: Almost total similarity Compressed expression of a subject in one version and expanding the same subject in the other version Different sequences of passages and chapters in the two versions Lacking passages and chapters in one version As mentioned in the chapter on previous research, in previous studies of the Ard y-V r f N ma, mention has generally been made of similarities and differences between the different versions of this text. Furthermore, several thorough comparisons of various versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma have been made. At first, Haug and West compared some segments of various versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma, especially some parts of the H28 manuscripts (Zoroastrian Persian), with the Parsig version (1872). Then, after them, the complete text of the versified version of Zartušt Bahr m was com
181 In the Parsig version, according to the divisions of Dastur Jamaspji Asa, there is no distinct ‘introduction’. Since the ‘introduction’ consists of a part of the text that prepares the way for entering the main text, the first and the second chapters and pieces 1-7th of the 3rd chapter may be considered as the introduction in Parsig version.



170
pared twice with the Parsig version. The first comparison was done by ‘Af f (1964) and the second one by m zg r (1983). £ayb has also made a comparison of some parts of the Zoroastrian Persian version with the versified version of Zartušt Bahr m and the Parsig version (2001). The Parsig language dates back to a time before the Zoroastrian Persian version, which means that the Parsig version must be of an earlier origin than the Zoroastrian Persian version. Nevertheless, this research is mainly concerned with the Zoroastrian Persian version, and the Zoroastrian Persian version is also presented in a text edition in this work. Therefore, the Zoroastrian Persian version is the basis of the comparison and the Parsig version will be compared to that version. For the purpose of comparing the two versions, the divisions of the Zoroastrian Persian text found in the London manuscript and the divisions of the Parsig text edited by Dastur Hoshangji Jamaspji Asa have been followed. The London manuscript is the only manuscript of the Zoroastrian Persian version which has been divided into parts, viz. one preface and sixty episodes. The Parsig version was for the first time divided into chapters when it was edited by Dastur Jamaspji Asa, and then into a hundred chapters. Later researchers have, more or less, accepted and profited of his divisions.182 While comparing these two versions, first the two prefaces are compared. This comparison will be more extensive and more detailed than the comparison of the other chapters. There are two reasons for doing this; first, although the prefaces of these two versions obviously have a common origin and are similar in their style of describing the circumstances, the narration differs considerably between them. Secondly, there is a time discrepancy in the two versions, which means that Ard y’s journey takes place in different historical periods in the Parsig and Zoroastrian Persian versions. After comparing the prefaces, all Zoroastrian Persian episodes will successively be studied and compared to the Parsig version for contents and orders of events. If there is any difference between the Zoroastrian Persian and Parsig versions, this will be indicated. It will be also indicated when a passage or a full chapter is found in only one of the two versions.
182 To compare these two versions, the text edition made in this work has been used for the Zoroastrian Persian version, and for the Parsig version the text edited by Jamaspji Asa has been employed. In addition to the edited text by Jamaspji Asa, other editions and translations of the Parsig version have been used as well. These are: The Pahlavi Codices K 20 & K 20b, fols. 2r-29r; The Pahlavi Codices K 26, fols. 8r-56v; Le Livre d’Ard V r z, Ph. Gignoux 1984; Ard Wir z N mag, F. Vahman 1986; Ard V r f N ma, Translation in Persian by R. ‘Af f (1993); Ard V r z N ma, Ph. Gignoux, traduit en persan par Ž. m zg r (1993); Ard -V r f N ma, Translation in Persian by M. Bah r (1996).



171
Comparison of the Introductions
The introduction of the Zoroastrian Persian version corresponds to the first and second chapters and sections 1-7 of the third chapter of the Parsig version.183 In both versions, the introduction has similar contents. Zoroastrian Persian: The Zoroastrian faith is facing a period of weakness and the masses are uncertain about their religious beliefs. Ardaš r-i B bak n asks the Zoroastrian priests to reveal to him the right and true religion, so that he may destroy all other religions. Forty thousand wise persons and authorities come together in Ardaš r’s court from every place of Iran by his order. Ardaš r tells them that he wants to eliminate all hesitation and doubt about the Zoroastrian faith. After a long process, they select V r f for this mission. Without any conditions, V r f accepts the duty, which consists of a journey to the Other World. Then V r f goes together with others to the dar n fire-temple. He performs his ablutions there, dresses in white, perfumes himself and repents in front of the fire. V r f has seven sisters who come weeping to request that their brother should not be sent to the Other World. The Zoroastrian priests promise that V r f will return. The sisters accept and go back home. V r f is laid up on a throne by priests. The priests perform religious ceremonies and then they make V r f drink three bowls of wine. V r f drinks the wine and falls asleep. V r f is asleep for seven days and nights. During this time, forty thousand wise men as well as Ardaš r, the king, and his soldiers keep guard around the fire-temple to prevent any damage to that religious ceremony. V r f wakes up after seven days. People and authorities make merry and ask him to let them know what has happened to him. Parsig: The weakness and uncertainty of Zoroastrianism is attributed to Alexander’s attack, when Avesta was burned and the priests killed. Therafter, durb d M raspand n appears and submits himself to ordeals to prove the truth of his religion. In spite of this, the masses are still hesitant. There is no mention of any king’s name in this version. The authorities come together in the dur Farnbay fire-temple and, after discussing the problem, they decide to send someone to the Other World to get information whether the good deeds of religion that people do are profitable to the gods or to the demons. Then they call on the people and select seven men among them, and they in their turn select V r f, who according to this version is known as “Weh-š p r”, in a selection process in two stages. The name “Weh-š p r” is not mentioned in the Zoroastrian Persian version.
183 The part that is called ‘introduction’ by Haug and West, is the same as the first, second and third chapters of the Parsig version. Whereas the text divisions in this thesis follow the London manuscript (L), in which the introduction covers the first and second chapter and sections 1-7 of the third chapter of the Parsig version.



172
V r f wishes to test if the choice of him is correct by throwing a javelin; it is not clearly known what the significance of this test was. After three times of throwing the javelin, V r f is again selected. V r f’s seven sisters are his wives, too. They are among God’s worshippers and know the religious texts by heart. The seven sisters converse with the m bad n (priests) and stay by V r f’s side after the decision of the priests. V r f tells the priests that he must first eat something and make his last will known, and after that they can make him drink wine and mang (henbane). Then he eats something and the authorities make him drink three bowls of wine and mang. V r f drinks all three bowls, says his prayer while he is conscious and then falls asleep. There is no word of eating and drinking mang in the Zoroastrian Persian version. The dast r n (authorities), m bad n (priests) and sisters are busy reading the Avesta and watching V r f during his sleep. V r f’s soul ascends to the top of the Mount D it g and comes back to his body after seven days and nights and V r f wakes up. In the Zoroastrian Persian version there is no word of V r f ascending to the top of the Mount D it g and returning to his body. While returning, as V r f sees dast rs (authorities) and h rbads (priests/teachers), he goes towards them and shows his reverence and gives them the greetings of hrmazd, Zardušt, Sr ̈š, dur-yazd (the god of fire), xwarrah d n (the glory of Religion) and the other virtuous ones of the Other World. The sisters are happy because of V r f’s return, too. No such greetings are mentioned in the Zoroastrian Persian version.
Comparison of subsequent episodes in both versions
1. The first episode of the Zoroastrian Persian version corresponds to sections 8-14 of the third chapter and the sections 1-4 of the fourth chapter of the Parsig version.184 Zoroastrian Persian: V r f eats a little food and says his prayers. Then, he asks for a scribe to write his travel report to be sent all over the world. V r f sees Sur š a few hours after he has fallen asleep and tells him that he has been sent by the king and the dast rs (authorities) to report. Then together with Sur š he goes to the Chinvad Bridge and describes it. Parsig: V r f eats some food and drinks water and wine, and then asks for a scribe.
184 In order to help the reader not to confuse the different versions with each other, two different words are here used: ‘episode’ for the Zoroastrian Persian version and ‘chapter’ for the Parsig version.

He sees Sr ̈š and dur-yazd (the god of fire) and tells them that he is “a messenger”. Then he visits Chinvad Bridge, but he does not describe it. 2. The second episode corresponds to sections 5-14 of the fourth chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: This episode consists of a description of a virtuous man who says a prayer while passing the Chinvad Bridge. This spirit is mentioned only in the third singular person form. Parsig: The virtuous spirit is mentioned both as a single individual and in the plural. The virtuous man says a Gathic prayer in the Avestan language.185 3. The third episode corresponds to the fifth chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: V r f, while visiting Mihr- zad and the amš spand n (Holy Immortals) on Chinvad Bridge, tells them that he has been sent by the m bads (priests), the dast rs (authorities), the faithful and the king of kings to report to them about the Other World. V r f says these same words to Sur š in the first episode of the Zoroastrian Persian version. A virtuous man arrives at Chinvad Bridge, which is 27 gaz (27 meters) wide. The Bridge turns the wide side up, and the virtuous man and V r f following him pass it. Parsig: Chinvad Bridge becomes as wide as 9 lances. The following circumstances are mentioned in the Parsig version but not in the Zoroastrian Persian version: Mihr-yazd Mihr-yazad, Rašn, W y weh, Wahr m-yazad, Ašt d-yazad, Xwarrah dan weh M zdasn n, Frawahr ahlaw n Mazdasn n and the other spirits greet V r f. V r f sees Rašn with a golden balance in her hand measuring good and evil deeds. Sr ̈š and dur-yazd say that they will show the merriment, as well as the light and fragrance of Paradise to V r f, besides the darkness, narrowness, laboriousness and wickedness of Hell. 4. The fourth episode is not mentioned in the Parsig version, but its statement that is leading V r f to Ohrmazd’s place were cited in sections 1-3 of chapter 10 of the Parsig version. 5. The fifth episode is not mentioned in the Parsig version. 6. The sixth episode corresponds to the sixth chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: V r f was led to ham stag n (limbo), the place of those for whom the virtues and sins are equal. 7. The seventh episode corresponds to the the seventh chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: V r f was led to the sit ra-p ya (star-station), the place of those who have not done nau-z d and g t -xar d (see commentary).
185 The Gathic statement of the virtuous man runs: Ušt ahm i yahm i, ušt kahm i it.



174
Parsig: The sins of the residents of the star-station are, not to have done their prayers, not to have read the G h n, not to have married their close relatives xw d dah (kin-marriage) and not to have ruled or been leaders. 8. The eighth episode corresponds to the eight chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: V r f was been led to the m h-p ya (moonstation), the place of those who have not done the G h n prayers and not done nau-z d and g t -xar d.
Parsig: The other sin of the residents of the moon-station is that they have not married their close relatives xw d dah (kin-marriage). 9. The ninth episode corresponds to the ninth chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: V r f was been led to the x rš d-p ya (sun-station), the place of those who have done all the good deeds except nau-z d . Parsig: The sun-station is the place of the virtuous kings. 10. The tenth episode does not exist in the Parsig version. But its main subject corresponds to the first–third section of chapter eleven of the Parsig version. The main subject of this episode, ascending to gar ᠒m n (Paradise) to bow down to Ohrmazd, is similar to the second section of the fifth episode of the Zoroastrian Persian version. 11. The eleventh episode corresponds to the first-third sections of the tenth chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: A voice tells the souls not to trouble V r f by asking him questions. Instead of this, they should feed him with some aliments. So V r f is given a bowl of rau an-i m diy zarm (spring oil) which is the most delicious nutriment that V r f has ever eaten, and that is the food for all heavenly fellows and obedient and god-fearing women. Parsig: V r f was given an š (immortality syrup) to drink. 12. The twelfth episode corresponds to the fourth–eighth sections of the tenth chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: The holy immortal Urd bihišt reproaches V r f for setting wet logs on fire and recommends V r f to advise the people of the world to be careful while setting logs on fire, perhaps the logs may be wet. The last sentence is not mentioned in the Parsig version. Parsig: The holy immortal is here called dur-yazd (the god of fire). 13. The 13th episode corresponds to chapter 11 of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: The description of gar ᠒m n (Paradise), which, according to what Sur š says, is made of pure diamond does not exist in the Parsig version. In that version the voice that gives the order to show the place of righteous and evil doings to V r f is the voice of Ohrmazd. Parsig: There is no mention of gar ᠒m n, but it is called the place of Ohrmazd and of the amš spand n (Holy Immortals), the faravahr (celestial



175
body) of Zarathustra, Wišt sp the king, J m sp, Isadwaštar zardušt n (son of Zarathustra) and the other religion leaders in the ninth section. Gignoux supposes that it is a repetition when these names are mentioned in the same chapter for the second time. Since the names of Gay ̈mart and Farš ̈štar are missing in the first list, without doubt one of the later collectors of the work added these two names to complete the list according to his desire (Gignoux 1984: 164). Neither the list of heroes nor that of the gods is found in the Zoroastrian Persian text. 14. The 14th episode corresponds to chapter 12 of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: V r f sees the spirits of the r d n (munificent), all shining and playing cheerfully. They are those who have acted benevolently and made donations to poor and orphans. Parsig: The spirits of the r d n are the believers of religion and the doers of religious duties, who are honored by Ohrmazd. In the tenth piece of the twelfth chapter, a description is given of the spirits of virtuous rulers and kings on golden chariots and wheeled vehicles. This is similar to the 20th episode of the Zoroastrian Persian version, where mention is made of the spirits of men of armour. 15-16. The 15th and 16th episodes have no corresponding chapters in the Parsig version. 17. The subject of the 17th episode is the reward for righteous judgment and the punishment for unjust judgment. The theme of punishment for unjust judgment is also repeated in the 79th and 91st chapters of the Parsig version. 18. The 18th episode corresponds to chapter 13 of the Parsig version, but is longer than that one. Zoroastrian Persian: V r f sees women in beautiful dresses, who have been obedient to their husbands and loving towards them and have respected water and fire. Parsig: These women are the women of good thoughts, good words, and good deeds who have respected water, fire, the land, plants, cows and sheep and Ohrmazd’s other creatures. In addition to this, they have satisfied the wishes of the divinities of the spiritual world and the divinities of the physical world, and they have gained respect and satisfaction from their husband and their guardians as well. 19. The 19th episode corresponds to the first-third sections of chapter 14 of the Parsig version, but is longer than that one. Zoroastrian Persian: Seeing the spirits of the h rbad n (priests/teachers), who themselves have performed their worship and already have a more superior position than the other spirits in Paradise, they keep company with the amš spand n and eat spring oil. Parsig: This group is called yazišngar n (worshippers) and mansarbar n (religious leaders), but in this version there is no word of them having per



176
formed their worship themselves, keeping company with the holy immortals, or eating spring oil. 20. The 20th episode corresponds to the fourth–fifth sections of chapter 14 of the Parsig version but is longer than that one. Zoroastrian Persian: Here the spirits that have curtailed the power of the enemies of Ir n-šahr and have been in trouble all the time are vested in military garments and are given golden and silvery weapons. Parsig: V r f sees spirits with valuable bejeweled weapons sitting in a kingly manner on chariots and wheeled vehicles (gard neh), but there is no word about protecting Ir n-šahr against enemies. However, in the 10th section of chapter 12 of the Parsig version, it is written that the spirits of fair rulers and kings are seated on golden chariots and wheeled vehicles. This is similar to a section of the 20th episode in the Zoroastrian Persian version. 21. The 21st episode corresponds to the sixth–seventh sections of chapeter 14 of the Parsig version but is longer than that one. Zoroastrian Persian: The spirit of those who have killed xrafstar n (noxious creatures) and black wild beasts are now in gardens and orchards dancing joyfully. Parsig: Here it is written that since xrafstar n have been killed by these persons, the splendor of the water, fire, plants and productivity of the ground has become more brilliant. 22. The 22nd episode corresponds to the eighth–ninth sections of chapter 14 of the Parsig version but is longer than that one. Zoroastrian Persian: Here the spirit of farmers (barz gar n) have been given the greatest happiness by the amš spand (holy immortal) Isfand rmad in the most beautiful garden, and Isfand rmad reveals herself to them as pretty women who are at their service. Parsig: There is no description of the place where the farmers (w stary š n) spend their afterlife, but the celestial bodies of the water and the ground and the plants and the sheep are at the farmers’ service. In the tenth section of chapter 14 of the Parsig version, V r f sees the spirit of the craftsmen sitting in a luminous place. This piece is not found in the Zoroastrian Persian version. 23. The content of 23rd episode corresponds to sections 1-14 of chapter 86 of the Parsig version but is longer than that one. Zoroastrian Persian: This episode is the longest part of the Zoroastrian Persian version. Almost one third of the beginning of the text describes the spirits of the shepherds and their rewards. However more than two thirds of the text, a substantial amount of text, is about the philosophy of life, the difficulties of the world, and how to conduct one’s life by struggling against greed, avidity and wickedness. Parsig: The contents of the Parsig version are similar to that of the Zoroastrian Persian version but are not as detailed as the latter text.



177
24. The 24th episode corresponds to sections 4-7 of chapter 15 of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: Here the husbandmen (kadxud ), who have cultivated the world are celestial bodies, and the water and fire and ground and plants and trees are at their service in the Other World. Parsig: The celestial bodies (faravahr) of the righteous and of water and plants are in the service of husbandmen (kadag-xwad y n) and countrymen (dahig n).
In the 18th section of the 15th chapter of the Parsig version, V r f sees the spirits of teachers and scholars who are rejoicing. This does not exist in the Zoroastrian Persian version. 25. The 25th episode corresponds to the 9th section of the 15th chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: V r f sees the place of the intercessors and describes it extensively. Parsig: The place of the intercessors is described in a single piece (XV.9). The description of the excellent world of the chaste is found in a single piece, too (XV.10), but no such description exists in the Zoroastrian Persian version. 26. The 26th episode corresponds to the 16th chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: V r f arrives at a river which has been created by the tears of mourners and which the dead souls cannot pass through. Some dead souls are also submerged in this river. Parsig: There are no souls submerged in the river. The mourning is described in the 57th chapter, but there it is only the women who mourn and weep. 27. The 27th episode corresponds to the 17th chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: The spirits of all evil-doing persons is described as a single one, in the third person singular. The Chinvad Bridge is described as a razor or a sword. The spirit says a prayer, the theme of which is nonreligious; it does not address Ohrmazd and there is no mention of Ohrmazd in that phrase. Parsig: The evil-doers’ spirits are referred to both as a single unit in the third person singular and as a plural concept (in the third person plural). No description of Chinvad Bridge exists here. The spirit of the evil-doing persons says a Gathic prayer, which is shorter and is cited in Avestan.186 28. The 28th episode corresponds to the 18th chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: This is a description of the punishments of those who are captured in Hell. Parsig: When three days and nights have passed, a spirit says: “Nine thousand years have passed upon me but I am not yet released”. These same
186 The Gathic formulation of the evil-doers’ prayer is: Ušt ahm i yahm i, ušt kahm i it.



178
words are repeated in the 54th chapter as well. This passage is not found in the Zoroastrian Persian version. 29. The 29th episode corresponds to the 19th chapter of the Parsig version. Here the spirits of sodomites that have been changed into snake-men and are being punished are described. The outward appearance of these spirits is different in the two versions. 30. The 30th episode corresponds to the 20th chapter of the Parsig version. 31. The 31st episode corresponds to the 21st chapter of the Parsig version but is longer than that one. In this episode, the spirit who has killed a righteous man in the world is described. 32. The 32nd episode corresponds to the 22nd chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: Here the spirit of a man who has had sexual intercourse with a woman in her menstruation time is described. Parsig: The measure of punishment for each time of intercourse is given. There is also another punishment for this sin, namely that the wrongdoer should cook and eat his most merited child. 33. The 33rd episode corresponds to the 23rd chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: Here the spirit that has not said any prayer while drinking water or eating vegetables and has not put on the sacred girdle and has walked around with only one shoe on is being punished. The punishment for the latter two sins sin is repeated in 35th episode as well. Parsig: Only the sin of not saying prayer while drinking water and eating vegetables is mentioned here. 34. The 34th episode is about whoredom and corresponds to the 24th chapter of the Parsig version. It is repeated in the 81st Parsig chapter. 35. The 35th episode corresponds to the 25th chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: Here, again, the spirits that have not fastened the sacred girdle and have walked with one odd shoe on as well as those who have urinated while standing are punished. Parsig: These spirits have, according to the Parsig version, also committed “other evil-doings”. 36. The 36th episode corresponds to the 26th chapter of the Parsig version. 37. The 37th episode corresponds to the 27th chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: In this part, the spirit is described that has committed trade with false weights, cheating and mixing water in milk. Parsig: These spirits mix water in wine. The sin of trade with false weights is repeated in the 67th and 80th chapters of the Parsig version, too. 38. The 38th episode corresponds to the 28th chapter of the Parsig version but is longer than that one. Here spirits of tyrant kings in the present world are being punished. 39. The 39th episode corresponds to the 29th chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: Here the spirit of a man who has committed slander is being punished.



179
Parsig: This sin is repeated in the 66th chapter, too. But there, both a man and a woman who have committed slander are mentioned. 40. The 40th episode corresponds to the 30th chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: The spirit of one who has killed many quadrupeds cruelly is punished. Parsig: This sin is repeated in the 74th chapter as well. 41. The 41st episode corresponds to the 31st chapter of the Parsig version. This chapter is twice as long in the Zoroastrian Persian version as in the Parsig version. The spirit of one who has accumulated wealth but has neither used it himself nor has made any donations to others is described here. 42. The 42nd episode corresponds to the 32nd chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: The spirit of a man called Danus, whose single good deed was that he once with one foot threw some grass in front of a sheep that was tied far from its food is portrayed in such a way that one foot is shown to be outside of Hell. Parsig: This man is called Daw nus and has thrown grass in front of a cow. 43. The 43rd episode corresponds to the 33rd chapter of the Parsig version. This subject is about the punishment of liars and is repeated in the 90th chapter. 44-46. The 44th-46th episodes correspond to the 44th-46th chapters of the Parsig version. 47. The 47th episode corresponds to the 47th chapter of the Parsig version but is longer than that one. The spirit of people who were hypocrites and have deceived the masses and caused them to convert from Mazd -worship to other religions is being punished here. 48. The 48th episode corresponds to the 48th chapter of the Parsig version. 49. The 49th episode corresponds to the 34th chapter of the Parsig version. The spirit of a woman who has shown disrespect to the fire is being punished. There are different manners of disrespect to the fire in the two versions. 50. The 50th episode corresponds to the 35th chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: The spirit of a woman who has conjured magic and caused others to do the same thing is described. Parsig: There is no word about causing others to do magic. Practicing magic by women is repeated in 81st chapter. 51-52. The 51-52nd episodes correspond to the 38th-39th chapters of the Parsig version. 53. The 53rd episode and the 40th chapter of the Parsig version are identical as regards the manner of punishment. Zoroastrian Persian: Here, a man who deprived other people of their women is now carrying a mountain on his back.



180
Parsig: A man who has told lies and untrue words about others carries a mountain on his back. This sin is repeated in the 60th chapter, the 71st chapter (in addition to the sin of sodomy) and the 88th chapter of the Parsig version. 54. The 54th episode is not found in the Parsig version, but it is similar to a part of the 72nd chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: The people who have taken their bath in the manner of the followers of other religions and have caused Isfand rmad and the Celestial soul (m n g) of water and of fire to be displeased with them are being punished. Parsig: According to the 72nd chapter, women who have not cared for their menstruation caused Isfand rmad and water and fire to be disturbed. 55. The 55th episode corresponds to the 49th chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: The spirit of a man who has extracted heavy taxes (xar j-i gar n) on people’s land and caused them to become refugees from their native home is being punished by getting a mountain on his back. Parsig: Here several men who have committed this sin are mentioned as eating the filth and the corpse of others for their punishment. In addition to this, the demons also throw stones at them. Every spirit carries a large amount of these stones on his back. 56-58. The 56th-58th episodes correspond to the 50th-52nd chapters of the Parsig version. 59. The 59th episode corresponds to the 1st section of the 101st chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: Sur š and Urd bihišt lead V r f from the dark and gloomy Hell into the glorious Paradise (Gar tm n). Parsig: V r f is led by Sr ̈š and dur-yazd. 60. The 60th episode corresponds to the 2nd-12th sections of the 101st chapter of the Parsig version. Zoroastrian Persian: The voice of Ohrmazd tells V r f to come back to the world and tell the full truth of what he has seen and not to tell any lies, because Ohrmazd sees him. Then he advises him to tell people not to hesitate in the religion of Zarathustra and to be faithful, whether in wealth or poverty, and to do good deeds. In the continuation of the text, repentance of sins, worshipping Ohrmazd and the religion, and cursing of the Demons and Ahriman are described. This part does not exist in the Parsig version. Parsig: Ohrmazd does not warn V r f of telling lies. He asks V r f to tell what he has seen to people truthfully and inform them that the ancient religion and all other ways are misleading ways. The true religion is the very one that was revealed to you by Zarathustra on his part and was propagated by Wišt sp. This part does not exist in the Zoroastrian Persian version of the text.



181
V r f then bows in front of Ohrmazd. He says that thereafter he is taken back to his own bed by Sr ̈š. This part does not exist in the Zoroastrian Persian version.
Out of the Zoroastrian Persian version that includes an introduction and 60 episodes, three episodes are lacking in the Parsig version: 5, 15 and 16. The Zoroastrian Persian version thus comes to an end at the 60th episode. But the Parsig version has other chapters as well. Out of all the chapters of the Parsig version, altogether 101 chapters, the following do not exist in the Zoroastrian Persian version: 36-37, 41-43, 53-56, 58-59, 61-65, 68-70, 73, 75-78, 82-85, 87, 89, and 92-100, that is 39 chapters altogether. The subject of 38 of these 39 chapters is descriptions of punishments, and the subject of the one remaining chapter of the Parsig version (LXVIII) is a description both of the punishment of a woman and of the reward of a man.
General Review
A general review of the contents of the Zoroastrian Persian and Parsig versions reveals the following main characteristics of and differences between the two versions: The Parsig version is more voluminous than the Zoroastrian Persian version. The Parsig version is more religious than the Zoroastrian Persian version, because it contains more guidelines, particularly in its extra chapters. The subjects of these chapters are totally religious. However, not only these extra chapters have stronger religious contents. In the Parsig version, the sins and due to them, the punishments of women are more often treated than the sins and punishments of men. Many of these sins are about “disloyalty to the husband” and a few sins are concerned with “carelessness to infants” and other life matters. In the Parsig version, unlawful sexual relation between a man and women of others has been mentioned more than other sins (four times: in the 40th, 60th, 71st and 88th chapters). In the Parsig version, again and again, the pictures and descriptions of the Hell are brought forth. It describes Hell, once in chapter 18 and again in the 53rd and 54th chapters. It seems as if the two latter descriptions are indeed a mixed version of one account and as a result of this unskillful mixing the same picture of Hell appears twice.187 It must be considered as an important point that the 53rd and 54th chapters of the Parsig version are not found in the Zoroastrian Persian version. It can be also supposed that
187 Gignoux (1984), Utas (1989-1991) and £ayb (2001) have previously pointed out this repetition of the description of Hell in the Parsig version.



182
the picture of Hell in the Parsig version was procured by mixing some pictures of Hell taken from Ard y-V r f’s travel report and various other Zoroastrian texts, and as a result of this, there is some repetition of sins and their punishment. However, these repeated passages are different in details. Only one matter has been repeated twice in the Zoroastrian Persian version, that is the sin of not having fastened the sacred girdle and walking while putting on one shoe. V r f is frightened by the cries of those in Hell in the 53rd chapter of the Parsig version, and begs Sr ̈š and dur-yazd not to lead him into Hell, but they assure him that he will not face any danger there. This chapter only occurs in the Parsig version. However, there is no word of V r f being frightened of Hell anywhere in the Zoroastrian Persian version. Apart from the description of Paradise, a total of 20 types of rewards (p dafrah), are mentioned in the Zoroastrian Persian version. Among these there are 17 rewards for “people”, 2 rewards for “men” and one for “women”. Totally 11 rewards are mentioned in the Parsig version. There are 7 rewards for “people”, 3 rewards for “a man” in singular form and one reward for “women”. Apart from the description of Hell, there are 31 cases of punishments in the Zoroastrian Persian version; 19 punishments for “a man” in singular form, 6 punishments for “a woman” in singular form and 6 punishments for “people” in general. A total of no less than 81 punishments are described in the Parsig version; 31 punishments for “a man” in singular form, 20 punishments for “a woman” in singular form, 19 punishments for “people” in general, 7 punishments for “a women” in plural form, 4 punishments for “a man and a woman” both in singular form. In one of these four cases, the woman is punished, but the man gets a reward. Thus, the volume of subject matters about Paradise is much larger than the volume of subject matters about Hell in the Zoroastrian Persian version, a case which is completely reversed in the Parsig version. From this we see the most important characteristics of the Zoroastrian Persian version and the most important differences between the two versions. Since the Parsig version is more religious, perhaps the differences between rewards and punishments in the two versions is more important than their different historical settings (according to their introductions, one is set in Ardaš r-i B bak n’s time and the other one later than durb d M raspand n’s time). V r f’s guides are Sur š and the Holy Immortal Urd bihišt in the Zoroastrian Persian version, and they are Sr ̈š and dur-yazd in the Parsig version. We can say that the reason why Urd bihišt amš spand’s name is found in the Zoroastrian Persian version instead of dur-yazd’s name, is per



183
haps because Urd bihišt amš spand is so closely related to the fire as if they are one and the same being. According to the យaddar Na᠒r, Ohrmazd has chosen Fire as the Other World’s king, but according to the យaddar Bundahiš, Ohrmazd has chosen Urd bihišt amš spand as the Other World’s king (┩DN 1909: XVIII.3; ┩DB 1909: LIV.34). Some of the names of persons, places and books in both the Zoroastrian Persian and the Parsig version are the same, but some names are found just in one of the two versions. The names only mentioned in the Zoroastrian Persian version are as follows: dar n, m d y zarm, urvar. The number of names mentioned only in the Parsig version are more numerous, namely: aleksandar, ašt d, r n, dur-yazd, dur farrbay, durb d m raspand n, gay mard, kay-wišt sp, rašn, fraš štar, w y, wahr m, w h-š bu[h]r, j m sp, isadw star, hr m y g, muzr y g, diz nibišt, staxr, d n-kard, d iti.

IX. Ard y-V r f N ma: from a shamanistic epic into a Zoroastrian narration
The Iranian myths have been transformed and have changed into a new religious form twice due to religious transformations of the society. The first time, the Indian and the Iranian gods of pre-Zoroastrianism were transformed into a Zoroastrian form to survive. The Iranians and the Indians were very close to each other when it came to their languages and religion. The language of the Avesta is so close to the language of the Vedas that the discoveries of Rasmus Rask in the year 1826 about the relationships between the Avestan language and Sanskrit was one of the first steps towards exploring the Avestan grammar, which was later for the first time described in detail by Williams Jackson in 1892 (Jackson 1892: xv). The ancient Iranian religion was closely related to the contemporary Indian religion in the pre-Zoroastrian times (Widengren 1965: 7-8). Furthermore, traces of the same distinct social classes of ancient India can also be found in ancient Iran (Dumézil 1958: 7-8; Benveniste 1969: 279292). Dumézil concluded from a research about the significant pre-Vedic gods, whose names have been mentioned in Younger Avesta as well, that these gods were common to the Iranians and the Indians. Proving his view, he presented the Boghazköi treaty document which is a cuneiform inscription in the Hittite language. According to this inscription from the 14th century B.C., the Aryan king, Matiwaza mentioned five gods: these are Mitrá, Váru│a, Índra, and the two N satyas (Dumézil 1952: 5-39). However, the names and the functions of these gods in the Avesta are not the same as those of the Iranian pre-Zoroastrian gods. The above-mentioned gods of Zoroastrianism became divided into two groups: gods and demons: Ahura Mazd h and Mi ra have taken the place of Váru│a and Mitrá of the Indo-Iranian religion in the group of the gods, but Indra and Nå─hai ya (Índra and the two N satyas in the Vedic tradition) are placed in the group of the demons (ibid.). In this manner, the ancient Iranian and the pre-Zoroastrian myths were changed into a different form and were melded into a perfect Zoroastrian synthesis as found in the Avesta (Hinnells 1973: 20). When Zoroastrianism was accepted in the Iranian society, in addition to the gods and religious tenets of the society, a number of the myths and epics



186
with their heroes from the pre-Zoroastrianism epoch were converted into Zoroastrian form and color. Every nation that accepts a new religion will in the course of time re-interpret some of its mores and traditions or even some of its old beliefs and incorporate them into this new religion with a new appearance. Sometimes they attribute old moral values to the great characters of the new religion to give these characters more validity and popularity. Moreover, they sometimes try to make the heroes or religious champions of their ancient times survive either with the same name and particularity or sometimes in a new form and appearance (Mujtab ’ 2000: 27). For the first time, Pierre de Menasce, while doing research into the type of the Wahr m-yazd (=God Bahr m),188 has described this kind of transformations of the pre-Zoroastrian mythic and epic personages of Iran into Zoroastrian types (de Menasce 1948: 5-18).189 Garš sp is such a type from this gallery of mythic personalities. Garš sp, in Avesta K጗r጗s spa-, carries the family name of S ma-.190 According to some parts of the ancient narrations that are left here and there Garš sp has been characterized with the function of a saviour. However, in Zoroastrianism, besides a bleaching of his character, his function as a saviour has also been committed to the three saviours in Zoroastrianism. However, some shadows of his saviour’s function remain (Sark r t 1999‘b’: 256-261). The second transformation in myths occurred after the time when Iranians were conquered by the Arab Muslims in the Sasanid epoch. A mixing with Semitic myths is one of the most distinguished characteristics of the Iranian myths of this period. If the myths deeply founded in the society are to remain in a community which has accepted a new religion with new rituals, they must change their appearance somewhat (┩add qiy n 1997: 287). In this perspective, the Iranians try to adapt their myths to the isr ’ liyy t (Semitic myths) to make them survive. Knowing about the need for such adaptations, B r n introduces the reason for them on the part of the Iranians. There was a growing competition between the Iranians and the Arabs concerning which people was more noble or higher. The Arabs attributed themselves to Ibr h m (Abraham) who was a forefather in Islam, but the Iranians wished to compete with them (B r n 1984: 177).191 In other words, the Iranians
188 De Menasce has specially profited from two texts for his study, the first one in Parsig (MS.S.P. 2045) and the other one in Zoroastrian Persian (M55). 189 Dragon-killing was one of the most important functions of the pre-Zoroastrian gods, but dragon-killing has been intentionally avoided as an attribute of the gods both in Avesta and in the other Zoroastrian works (Sark r t 1999‘a’: 105-106). See also Wikander’s studies concerning this issue (Wikander 1941: 133). 190 The name of this personality is mentioned in two forms in Parsig works. It has been written in the form of S m (MX 1985: XXVI.49; LXI.4, 20) in the M n Xrad, and in the form of Kers[ ]sp (PRDd 1990: XVIIIf.1-36) in the Pahlavi Riv yat. It has also been recorded inthe form of Garš sp (┩DB 1909: XX.1-66) in Zoroastrian Persian works. 191 This part was not included in the manuscripts that Sachau profited from in order to edit ╂ r-al-b qiya. Thus, the translation in Persian by Akbar D n -Sirišt has been used here.

wished both to make their own myths (legends) survive and to indicate their faith in the unique God through relating their mythic personages to the Semitic legends. In this manner, a large number of Iranian myths were adapted to their Semitics models. For example, Kiy mar╂ (Gay ̈mard) was adapted to Adam (T r x-i s st n 1935: 2), Jamš d was known as Solomon (Ibn-i Nad m 1871: 309) and ┹ahm ra╂/Tahm ra╂ (Parsig: Tahmurit; Av.: Taxm -urupa-) was known as Noah (Mas‘ d 1964: 1.123). Many of the narrations and epics of the Iranian-Zoroastrian myths were adapted to Semitic myths and narrations during this process, and thus they changed in appearance, form or theme. For example, Rustam became one of the prophet’s Noah children (Taj rib ul-ᤲumam 1994: 59), Far d n was equated with Nimrod (D navar 1911: 7) and Man ihr was presented as one of the children of Isaac, the son of Abraham (┹abar 1879-1881: 1.433).192 Since the myths, the epics and the narrations were rarely recorded in writing during the period before the Indo-Iranian religion changed into Zoroastrianism, the transformation of their themes and forms into the myths and Zoroastrian religious narrations must have happened more easily than at the period of transformation of the Zoroastrian legends into Islamic form. During this second transition, many of the Iranian myths and narrations as well as the history of various epochs had been recorded in writing in the form of epics and myths, e.g. in the Avesta, the Xwad y-N mags, the Pahlav n g (Parthian/Pahlavi) and the Parsig works during early Islamic times.
Unfortunately, there are not many original accounts of pre-Zoroastrian Iranian works that may show to what extent texts have been changed by being restructured in Zoroastrian times. This is, of course, due to the fact that there are very few such accounts from pre-Zoroastrian times at hand in different languages, including in Zoroastrian Persian. However, some few scattered short specimens of pre-Zoroastrian works are to be found here and there. In comparing these with what has been rewritten in the Zoroastrian period, the elimination of earlier themes on the basis of Zoroastrian philosophy can be discovered in accounts where we both have a pre-Zoroastrian and a later Zoroastrian version. The previously mentioned example of Wahr m-yazd belongs to the obvious examples of this. Among the transformed Iranian narratives, Ard y-V r f’s journey report is a special case, because it has changed in form and theme both due to the conversion of the Iranian society from its ancient religion (Indo-Iranian) into Zoroastrianism and then after the change of religion in Iran from Zoroastrianism to Islam.
192 The domain of adaptation was even extended to the names of places, in such a manner that one of An h d’s (the goddess of the water) probable temples was changed into the B b Šahrb n shrine. According to popular legends of the Shiites, she is Yazdgird’s daughter, the latest king of Sasanids, and the wife of Imam 8usayn, the third religious leader of the Shiites (Boyce 1967: 36-38).



188
Most of the scholars who have studied the Ard y-V r f N ma, believe that it belongs to the most ancient Iranian works, whether its present form originates in the Sasanid period or later. Tavadia (1956: 117) finds the marks influences of the Magians of Acheamenids times on both the Zoroastrian and the genuine Iranian customs throughout the text of this work. Widengren (1961: 13) is of the opinion that the text has been written in the Sasanid period, but many topics are certainly more ancient. Boyce (1968‘a’: 48) believes that the work originates from very old days; because the name of W r z was mentioned already in the Avesta. Tafa╲╲ul (1991: 733) also believes that the main core of the subject of the book belongs to Avestan times. Boyce and Grenet (1991: 430) are of the opinion that “the belief that the stars were nearer to the earth than the moon or sun marks the antiquity of the story”.193 However, the main reason why the Ard y-V r f N ma must be seen as an ancient narration is the use of the name of W r z (V r f), who is mentioned in the Fravard n Yašt, the 13th Yašt of Avesta. According to some pieces of evidence from the Fravard n Yašt itself, this text must have been created in either pre-Achaemenid times or in the early days of this royal dynasty (Christensen 1928: 34-35, 44-45). In this Yašt there is recorded a list of characters who are eulogized for the sake of their good essence. W r z (V r f) is one of these:
We eulogize the essence of the pure religion of W r z. (Fravard n Yašt: XXV. 101).194
The mention in the second part of the Fravard n Yašt of the heroes of Mazdaism from Gay ̈mart to Sa ̈šy nt occurs in a series of 7 groups. In verses 96-110 one finds the names of the first apostles of Zoroastrianism and its first champions, most of them belonging to the cycle of king Wišt spa (Duchesne-Guillemin 1962: 38; Boyce 2001: 200). It is necessary to take into consideration that these names were sacred, popular and famous or had a social place in the pre-Zoroastrian Iranian society, and have been transformed and incorporated into Zoroastrianism. Some of them, e.g. Mi ra, Wahr m and Garš p have previously been mentioned. W r z (V r f) could also be among them. The personality of W r z (V r f) must be such a popular and important name that the authors and composers, while composing the Fravard n Yašt, were not able to renounce him. It was even necessary to praise him. The reason for such importance and popularity was nothing but V r f’s journey to the Other World. There is nothing else very important in the story except that journey. Some other issues, such as the diversification of Zoroastrian beliefs, the shaky faith of the masses, and the virtuousness or innocence of V r f are matters, which have been men

189
tioned in the introduction of the Ard y-V r f N ma, as if they are important issues, but certainly they are minor topics. With respect to the antiquity of V r f’s personality, his journey to the Other World can be reviewed from a new point of view. This present version can be considered as a transformed form of the story. The issue of a journey to the Other World is here on the basis of the Zoroastrian Persian version of the Ard y-V r f N ma believed to be a pre-Zoroastrian shamanistic concept, and it is therefore likely that V r f was not initially a pure and innocent Zoroastrian but an Iranian shaman who travelled to the Other World, who saw the places of pleasures and the joyful ones on the one hand and the places of torment and the unfortunate ones on the other hand, places later renamed Paradise and Hell. Then, after coming back, he recounted what he had seen there. But, the original philosophy behind this journey and the main reasons for reporting it are questions that may be answered in a totally convincing way only by having in hand the original and the authentic version of the story, which we do not have, at least at present. In other words, there is nothing available to give a total understanding of V r f’s aim of travelling to the Other World. Thus, it is not clearly known if his motif for travelling to the Other World was a religious passion or if the report of his journey was an epical narrative.195 As a piece of evidence for recognizing V r f as a Shaman, one can point to the similarities of his situation and that of the Shamans. Eliade believes that the central part of Shamanism is established in an ecstasy experience. Shamanism is a path to knowledge that will be possible through a person who experiences visiting the spirits in ecstasy. The Shaman thus specializes in journeys to the Other World in ecstasy. The spirit of a Shaman will stroll about; ascending to the sky and descending into the underworld, or every other place where mighty spirits are reposed (Eliade 1964: 5, 50f). Nyberg has presented a very precise and full study about the diverse rites of Shamanism among different tribes from central Asia to the north of Europe. Some of these rites that will be mentioned below are very important for verifying the hypothesis of V r f’s Shamanism. Among the various means used by the Shamans in different tribes in order to facilitate their journey and to put them in touch with the spirits are the use of distilled wine and narcotic (opiate) liquids, which induce a hypnotic state in the Shaman. The purpose of this state is to get the answers of his own or others’ questions and to finally be able to report to the spectators of his journey to the Other World (Nyberg 1937: 187-193).196 All these rituals are compatible with the ceremonies performed to achieve V r f’s journey. That is not surprising, since the ascension to heaven was one of the Ancient Iranian traditions in central Asia,
195 B žan £ayb believes that the Zoroastrian Persian version was originally a secular-epic narration (£ayb 2001: 8). 196 This, however, does not mean that Zarathustra was also a Shaman.



190
where Zoroastrianism both arose and developed in its early stages. This is a tradition which is still continued by the Shamans in Russia (Siberia and Central Asia) (Dary y 2001: 4).197 All these facts make up some clear evidence for V r f being a Shaman. The fact that the name of W r z (V r f) was mentioned in Fravard n Yašt, means that the first religious men, who produced the Fravard n Yašt, were acquainted with V r f’s journey report.198 Since there is no mention of V r f’s journey in the Fravard n Yašt, it is not possible to know the exact circumstances of the pre-Zoroastrianism version of the story and how it has been transformed into a religious-Zoroastrian account. In other words, it is not possible to find out what has been added to or omitted from the pre-Zoroastrian version in comparison with what has been left to present times. Thus, the only way forward in order to elucidate the matter is to consider what has been added to the earliest versions of the account. These added parts will indicate what direction the text has taken, and thus how it has deviated from the main subject. This is possible only through gaining access to a version which is more intact. Here it will be argued that the Zoroastrian Persian version and to a more limited extent the Pazand version are more intact and can make this argument possible.199 Concerning the introduction of the text, Haug and West believe that the original story most probably did not have one (Haug-West 1872: Lxxiii). According to this view, first an introduction to the text and the historical
197 Gignoux points to the anthropologic similarities between the two cultures of ancient Iran and Siberia in a study about Shamanism in Iran (Gignoux 1979: 41-79). 198 There is a couplet in the Zoroastrian Persian version of the M n Xrad, which has been versified by D r b Hurmazdy r Sanj na in the year 1046 Yazdgerdi/1677 A.D. According to that couplet, V r f’s time precedes Gušt sp’s period (MS.S.P.38: 17b). This couplet pronounces to Gušt sp:
( $ %< ( F G %> / (% D ' %3 %
Ba m n tu Gušt sp š d n šav / V r f n j yi xwad bingar “Oh Gušt sp, you will be cheerful in Paradise/ when you see your place there, like V r f.” This couplet reveals clearly that V r f’s journey is seen to have occurred before Gušt sp’s journey to the other world. Gušt sp was contemporary with Zarathustra and his most significant defender. D r b Hurmazdy r has either quoted this couplet from another place or added it to the text later on or he has profited from another source than the presently available version of the Parsig text to in his versification of the M n Xrad. However, this couplet assumes that V r f has visited the other world earlier than Gušt sp. The time of V r f should thus have preceded that of Gušt sp and Zarathustra. This will here be taken as evidence that the Ard yV r f N ma was originally an ancient text related to the times prior to Zarathustra. Thus the conclusion drawn is that it was a secular pre-Zoroastrian account that later was changed into a religious-Zoroastrian account. It must be said that the poem versified by D r b Hurmazdy r has some other parts in addition to the above-mentioned couplet which are not found in the M n Xrad in Parsig. Among them, there is a section related to Zarathustra’s knowledge of medicine, which was edited and published by the author of this study (K rgar 2008: 307-324). 199 Since this study is concentrated to the Zoroastrian Persian version, here neither the transformations nor the differences between the Pazand and the Parsig and the Zoroastrian Persian versions have been studied in detail.. Only relevant cases of these differences are noted.



191
personages of the introduction must have been added, then they have changed due to the historic situation of each new epoch. According to the introduction of the Pazand version, V r f’s journey took place in the time of Gušt spa200 (Antia 1909: 358).201 But according to Zoroastrian Persian version, the journey happened in Ardaš r B bak n’s time. V r f travelled to the Other World later than durb d M raspand n, according to the Parsig version, that is in the Sasanid era. According to the Zoroastrian Persian version, V r f’s journey takes place in the time of Ardaš r B bak n. However, according to what has been said in the introduction, there is no need to send a messenger to the Other World at that time. In other words, the causes for sending V r f to the Other World in the Zoroastrian Persian version do not seem reasonable. In fact, the aim of V r f’s journey projected to the time of Ardaš r is just to support the codification the Avesta by Ardaš r, and to disprove the value of other Zoroastrian schools by a confirmation of his act through a superhuman force from the Other World. There is no indication in the journey report about the dismissal of the various schools of Zoroastrianism other than the understanding of the religion which Ardaš r established as the only correct one. In fact, V r f neither asks Ohrmazd or the amš spand n (Holy Immortals) any question about the subject which in the introduction is presented as the central aim of his journey nor is any message given to him in the Other World regarding this matter. In the Parsig version V r f’s journey, which is described as having occurred at a time after durb d M raspand n, seems to be a useless and an unreasonable journey as well. According to the introduction of that version, V r f was sent to the Other World to find out whether the gods or the demons benefit from the praises which the masses do in religious duties. But according to the story, V r f neither asks any question about that matter in the Other World nor does he bring any message back with himself to resolve this issue. Ohrmazd merely says to V r f at the end of his journey that there is only one way of righteousnees, that is the way of the first teachers of the Mazdean religion (p ry tk š h), and the other ways are all misleading. In the introduction to the Pazand version it is stated that V r f’s journey took place immediately after the death of Zarathustra, in the times of Gušt sp’s reign. It seems that this date is more plausible than the date mentioned in the introductions to the Parsig and Zoroastrian Persian versions. It seems more necessary that such a travel should take place in the
200 It is surprising that this name has been written in the form of Gušt spa in the Pazand account. This name should have been recorded in the form of W št sp in the Pazand, which is certainly a re-written text of the Parsig version. 201 According to the Sanskrit version, V r f’s journey occurred in the time of Gušt spo (HaugWest 1872: Lxxviii). Bharucha believes that both the Sanskrit and the old Gujarati versions are translated from the Pazand version (Bharucha 1920: II).



192
times of Gušt sp, that is after the prophet passed away, since all over the world, the first crisis in most religions takes place at such a time. Social movements and revolutionary events just after the death of the leaders and founders of a new state or ideology are manifold throughout history. Such a crisis causes the beginning of division, unfaithfulness among the believers and restraint of the primary development and growth of either a religious or a socio-political movement, and it often follows after the disenchantment of the adherents in the earlier beliefs. Zoroastrianism could hardly have been an exception from this general rule. Additionally, it must be taken into consideration that the religious canons and social law codes of Zarathustra’s religion had not been written down yet at the time of his death, especially those parts that are mentioned as paradigms in Widawdad. Thus, the religious leaders and the priests could not yet profit from such texts to solve the religious and social issues arisen in the absence of Zarathustra. The Zoroastrian leaders could therefore only find one solution as the best remedy after the death of Zarathustra, when this situation arose, and that was to call for an answer from the Other World, a way that was not available to everyone. The best way known to them of achieving this aim was to profit from the pre-Zoroastrian Iranian story of V r f’s journey to the Other World. So, they changed V r f’s journey report, which was ready and available, into a journey to the territories of Ohrmazd undertaken by the most virtuous Zoroastrian of the time.
However, the changes and transformations in V r f’s story could not have taken place at a single instant. It is clear in the various versions of the work that many changes have occurred during the re-writing and translating the Ard y-V r f N ma into different languages in different times. The changes in the text from a pre-Zoroastrian to a Zoroastrian version have been kept until the tenth or eleventh centuries A.D. (Gignoux 1969: 998-1004). Every new change has caused V r f’s story to be more and more devoid of its pre-Zoroastrian meaning. The differences between the various versions of the same story provided in different times give evidence to that. For example, there are important differences between the themes of the Zoroastrian Persian prose version and the Zoroastrian Persian version versified by Zaratušt Bahr m (1964), and that one is also different from the Zoroastrian Persian version versified by An š rv n Kirm n (Unv l 1922: II.331-342). Also the Parsig and Pazand versions fit this picture. These diversities are greater than what could be supposed as mistakes or interferences done by the scribes. This same matter indicates that, in fact, the Ard y-V r f N ma has been re-written on several occasions while copied or translated in the course of time. Just for this reason, the re-written text has deviated more and more from its pre-Zoroastrian origin. It may be supposed that the differences of versions are due to an oral tradition. That is to say that since some of the religious men, believers and



193
followers have learned these texts by heart, then while retelling (transferring) the account to the next generation, or while writing and re-writing it, these differences in the Parsig, Pazand and Zoroastrian Persian versions have come into being due to carelessness, something which is very common in oral traditions. The oral traditions cannot be denied, however, they have gone hand in hand with written traditions. For example, in Iran according to a thousand year old habit, some Muslims still learn precisely by heart the Quran, numerous other Islamic holy texts and some long devotional prayers. However, this is not in opposition to the written tradition, which nowadays has changed into the printing technology. Something similar can have happened to the oral and written Zoroastrians texts. Even a very small change could not be acceptable in a text like the Ard y-V r f N ma, while learning it by heart, which is one of the most important religious prescriptions. If this has occurred, it would be an insignificant mistake and limited to the replacement of a maximum of a few words. However, it is impossible that the name of a king be exchanged from Gušt sp to Ardaš r in an oral version, or that the name of a king significant for Zoroastrianism as Ardaš r is left out totally. Likewise, it is not reasonable that the main subject of the story, that is the reason for V r f’s journey to the Other World, will be transferred into a new story in each new version, where even a number of new reasons are added and intermingled. Also another important point must be kept in mind. In the copying tradition of the East, the scribes used to compare a newly written manuscript with the original text after the manuscript was copied.202 If either a word or a sentence was omitted by the scribe, it was added in the margin of the manuscript. If any other mistake had happened while the text was rewritten, that would also be noted in the margin. Apart from this, many of the manuscript owners and even many readers of these manuscripts have written in the margin of the book the meaning of a word, a parallel expression or some other additional information. It could then happen that these notes in the margin were later added to the actual text, because some scribe supposed that they were notations of something neglected by the previous scribe.203 This would still give a coherent text if the scribe was initiated in the matter, but when the scribe was just a copyist and had no special knowledge about the subject of the book he was copying, which happened very often, there was often no relation between the subject of the text and what was later added to it. The
202 In Iran, this is known as ‘arᡂ-d dan which means ‘to compare’. 203 An exemple of this has occurred in Kit b al-យaydana fiሂl-᠉ibb by Ab -Ray9 n B r n . The main text of the book is written by Šayx A9mad Bayhaq , and then Ab -Ray9 n B r n has written a commentary for the drugs in the margin of that work. The scribe then mixed together the marginal notes of Ab -Ray9 n and the main text of Šayx A9mad to form the body text of the book. Mu9ammad ibn-i Masᤱ d £aznav later obtained a copy of the book and noted in the margin that it had been mixed up (Zary b 1991: twelve-thirteen). Note that in this case the marginal notes were added to the book itself, and were written by someone as B r n who was more knowledgeable than the writer of the text, that is Šayx A9mad Bayhaq .



194
presence of two couplets of Š hn ma by Firdaus in the Pazand version of the Ard y-V r f N ma represents an example of the addition of something likely to have been written in the margin of a manuscript.204 Tavadia says that the Pazand account is more ancient than the other narrations since the text is more cohesive and logical than the other versions (Tavadia 1956: 118). According to this and considering that no work has ever been written directly in Pazand, there must have existed another version different from this present Parsig version, a version which is the mother of the Pazand account and from which the Pazand version has been transcribed into Avestan characters. Meanwhile, one question is how ancient the introduction of the Zoroastrian Persian version is? Unfortunately, it may never be known if the source of Shapur s ’s manuscript was the first manuscript of the Zoroastrian Persian version or if it was a copy. However, the original text from which the translation into Zoroastrian Persian was done was undoubtedly in the Parsig language. The differences between the Zoroasrian Persian version and the present Parsig version make it likely that there was still another ancient version, different from the present Parsig account. Thus, it must be concluded that there have been three Parsig versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma. The Pazand version has been copied from the first one, then the Zoroastrian Persian version was translated from the second one, and the third one is the Parsig version available today.
The Ideological Changes of the Text
Now, how and why has V r f’s journey report changed? The transformation of the personages and their functions from preZoroastrian ideas into Zoroastrianism and from Zoroastrianism into Islam has been discussed above, and some examples of this were given as well. The Ard y-V r f N ma is about as close as we can come at present to a single text which exists in various ancient and new versions and which may reveal the nature of these changes, since versions of this work from different times and in different languages are at our disposal. The Zoroastrian priests try to get an answer from the Other World in order to prevail over the critical situation that occurred after the death of Zarathustra. The pre-Zoroastrian (Indo-Iranian) report of V r f’s journey to the Other World was already at their disposal, and in addition to this, no one was able to stand up against the inspired answer from the Other World. Thus, it was necessary to change V r f’s journey report from a pre
204 It is an interesting point that these two verses have been written in a handwriting other than the scribe’s handwriting in one of the manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma, that is in M (H28) manuscript, on the very first page where the title of the work has been recorded.



195
Zoroastrian document into a religious Zoroastrian account. This is an ideological change, the trace of which may be found in the later manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma.
This ideological change means a kind of religious censorship. When the priests could neither make nor wish a particular work to disappear from the literacy scene, they changed it in an ideological manner. They had to do this if they needed the work to remain. In such cases they tried either to overlook or to make pale the previous essential idea of the work. Thus, they sometimes tried to keep the vital principle of the work, but that which was related to the main idea and the principal teachings of the work would be deleted (Šaf ‘ Kadkan 2008: 177). Changing the names of the personages, either promotion or demotion of the religious personalities’ position, are all some of the most significant examples of ideological changes of a work. Sometimes, they even exchange the name of the work to lessen its importance.205 However, the story does not end there. Other examples of these transformations are a number of ideological terms which were changed when the society changed. The replacement of names in addition to the attribution of someone’s sayings to others due to ideological tendencies are some of these cases (Šaf ‘ Kadkan 2004: 95). In this manner, the ideological transformation has turned variant readings in the various manuscripts into hiding places for historical facts. In other words, these variants are like battlefields of different ideologies (Ibid: 106).206 However, these ideological changes are not only noticeable in the variants of an original manuscript. When a text was translated into other languages, the ideological transformations were also abundant. In a case like the Ard y-V r f N ma, the translator is actually much freer than the scribe to change the text. Thus, many of the ancient religious manuscripts have not disappeared due to natural events like floods, fire accidents etc., but the ideological administrators of the society have removed them knowingly and intentionally in order that no one may find out about the ideological transformations in these works (Ibid: 107).207
205 One of the works where the title has been changed while translating is a Karr m text from the Islamic period. The original title was Qi᠀a᠀ al-qur’ n (Tales from the Qur’an), and it was written in the scientific language of the time, that is in Arabic, in the year 467 A.H./1074 A.D. However, the title was changed to Qi᠀a᠀ al-ሂanbiy ሂ (Stories of the prophets) when the text was translated into Persian three centuries later (Šaf ‘ Kadkan 2008: 180). 206 “It is not easy to find the central points or the ideological battlefields within a text. For example, eliminating or adding a couplet may occur in every manuscript, but it might not be possible for an ordinary reader to understand why this couplet is eliminated or added” (Šaf ‘ Kadkan 2004: 96). 207 The point that the ideological transformation of a work is different from the changes caused by the scribes must be considered. Due to the cultural and linguistic changes in the society, sometimes the scribes have changed words and expressions, due to the ‘aural’ or ‘oral’ difficulties in these texts to people’s understanding (Šaf ‘ Kadkan 2004: 96). (I am grateful to Mr. N dir Mu╀allab K š n who has put both Šaf ‘ Kadkan ’s studies at my disposal.)

The ideological transformation of a work does not occur all at once but during various phases and in a process of repeated re-writings. In his studies on the Mun j t or Il h -n ma of ‘Abdu’ll h An┰ r , Bo Utas writes that altogether the various sources of the text of Mun j t differ greatly from each other in contents, in arrangement and in wording. He holds that “these texts have, no doubt, grown and changed incessantly during the centuries” (Utas 2008: 71-72). The conditions may have been the same regarding the Ard yV r f N ma. Additionally, the ideological transformation of the subject of this work has occurred not only while it was being re-written but also at the time of translation. Although the ideological changes have caused the Zoroastrian Persian version to deviate from its original form,208 there are two characteristics in this text that distinguish it from other versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma. Firstly, a few very ancient passages in this version do not seem to differ very much from what could have been produced in a pre-Zoroastrian society, and secondly, this version is freer of later additions than the other versions. These two characteristics are very important and two conclusions may be drawn in the light of them. The first one is that the Zoroastrian Persian version was originally a pre-Zoroastrian (Indo-Iranian) narrative and the second one is that the Zoroastrian Persian version is the most ancient version of this work at our disposal.
The transformation of the Ard y-V r f N ma from an pre-Zoroastrian Iranian text into a religious-Zoroastrian account is not so astonishing. Using preZoroastrian elements by Zoroastrians has a long past record. More than one thousand years ago, B r n writes that “the ancient Magians existed already before the time of Zoroaster, but now there is no pure, unmixed portion of them who do not practice the religion of Zoroaster. In fact, they belong now either to the Zoroastrians or to the Shamsiyya (sun-worshipers). Still, they have some ancient traditions and institutes, which they trace back to their original creed; but in reality those things have been derived from the laws of the sun-worshipers and the ancient people of 8arr n” (B r n 1879: 314).209 In the following argument reference will be made to many passages of the Ard y-V r f N ma story where changes and transformations occur. The presence of these passages in one of the Zoroastrian Persian or Parsig ver
208 Although the Ard y-V r f N ma in its Parsig version has been the subject of multiple changes and transformations, more so than the other versions, and has been converted into a religious-Zoroastrian form, the Zoroastrian Persian version has also experienced ideological changes in a few cases. An example is the last episode, the sixtieth, in which some parts of a Zoroastrian Pet t-n mag (confession) has been added. This has been explained in the commentary. 209 This above-mentioned quotation of B r n was translated by Sachau from the original text (B r n 1878: 318). The Persian translator of same work, ᠒ r-al-b qiyya, has translated the term “Šamsiyya” into “the Religion of Mihr” (Mithraism) (B r n 1984: 507). See also two works on “Šamsiyya”: (Jackson 1899: 140-143; Moulton 1913: 226-253).

sions and the absence of them in other versions clearly indicates in what manner the V r f’s report has deviated as a result of ideological changes from its original Iranian pre-Zoroastrian (Indo-Iranian) account and changed into a religious-Zoroastrian text.210 Meanwhile, it must be kept in mind that in the comparison between the two versions, it is only the additions that may be seen as Zoroastrian phenomena that are of interest in this argument. For example, the lance ordeal, which was V r f’s suggestion for the final choice of a suitable person for the journey to the Other World, is not an interesting addition, since this motive is not known as a Zoroastrian phenomenon. The parts of the Zoroastrian Persian version that will be mentioned here, have been extracted from the edited text as in the present thesis. Thus the numbering of the lines follows this edition. The numbering of the chapters and the paragraphs in the Parsig version follow the edition and transcription by Gignoux (1984). According to the Zoroastrian Persian version King Ardaš r calls all the authorities and scholars from all over the country to find out which one is the true version of the Zoroastrian religion (lines 8-13). The king has decided to send someone to the Other World to find the answer to his question.211 This points to the king’s power as the most high-ranking authority of decision in the country. But, according to the Parsig version it is the m bad n (the Zoroastrian priests) who decide to send someone to the Other World (I.14-15). Replacing the king by the Zoroastrian priests as the high authorities for making decisions is one of the changes that demonstrates that the text becomes religious during later periods. According to the Zoroastrian Persian version the Zoroastrian priests make V r f drink the wine of sih-yak . The wine of sih-yak has no religious connotation. However, according to the Parsig version, Zoroastrian priests make V r f drink the may u mang Wišt sp n (wine and henbane) (II.15-16). These drinks are well known in Zoroastrian texts.212 To wash V r f ceremoniously the priests choose a place of thirty paces away from the fire in the Parsig version (II.11), which is obviously one of the Zoroastrian additions. One of the obligations of Zoroastrianism for cleanliness is that every person who does this ceremonial washing should carry it out on a place thirty paces from the fire or every other sacred thing (Shaked 1995: XI.25). In the Zoroastrian Persian version there is no such choice of place.
210 A number of these passages have also been studied in the chapter “The Zoroastrian Persian version in comparison with the Parsig version” of this work. But these passages are here compared with each other in a different way and with a different purpose. 211 It is an astonishing point that there is no mentioning of this in the introduction. Only from the reply given to the king it is clear that he wishes to send someone to the other world. 212 Refer either to the paragraphs 83-87 of chapter four of book seven in the D nkard or to chapter 47 of the Pahlavi Riv yat about this topic (Gignoux 1984: 152).

According to the Zoroastrian Persian version, the seven sisters of V r f come along to prevent him from being sent to the Other World after hearing the story (lines 45-51). But, in the Parsig account, these women are not only the V r f’s sisters but they are his wives too (II.1). This transformation of V r f’s sisters into his wives and sisters might have occurred during Sasanid times when the Zoroastrian priests particularly recommended the act of xw d dah ‘same kin-marriage’. Another example of the xw d dah custom is a change that can be seen is Wišt sp’s (Gušt sp’s) story. In Wiz dag h Z dspram, Hut ̈s (Avestan: hutaos -) is Wišt sp’s wife.213 But she is both his wife and sister according to Ay dg r Zar r n. Besides, the name of Hut ̈s is mentioned four times in the Avesta, but there is no mention that she is the sister of Wišt sp (£ayb 2003: 378-388).214 In the Parsig version, V r f’s sisters make a request from the Zoroastrian priests for their brother to not be sent to the Other World (II.2). It is not clear in the Zoroastrian Persian version of whom the sisters ask that. However, according to the versified version of the Ard y-V r f N ma by Zartušt Bahr m Pajd , V r f’s sisters make this request from the King, and not from the priests (£ayb 2001: 7-8). On considering that the Zoroastrian Persian version might be the source of Zartušt Bahr m for the composition of his versified story (Haug-West 1872: xix), probably the text that served as a source for Zartušt Bahr m was more ancient, less religious and less retouched than the present Zoroastrian Persian prose version. According to the Parsig version, V r f’s sisters/wives are among the Zoroastrian believers, since they know the Avesta by heart. They are also worshippers (II.2). However, nowhere in the Zoroastrian Persian version is there any indication that V r f’s sisters are among the Zoroastrian believers. In the Zoroastrian Persian version, Sur š says to V r f that he should advise the people of the world to try to do good deeds more than evil deeds, even if the surplus of good deeds eventually is not bigger than the size a human eyelash, so that their spirits may be sent to Paradise instead
213 Still, according to the T r x al-rusul wa’l-mul k by ┹abar , Hut ̈s is just the wife of Gušt sp (1881-1882: II.678) and there is no indication that she is Gušt sp’s sister as well. ┹abar has recorded the name of “Hut ̈s” with the form of « %8<» “Xu╀ s”. De Goeje, the editor of T r x al-rusul wa’l-mul k has identified this name as that same “Hut ̈s”, and has explained this in a footnote to the edited text. 214 It is an interesting point that according to an Iranian ancient story (a summary of which has been mentioned by Athenæus, a Greek writer of the second century A.D; quoted from Chares of Mitylene) Hut ̈s is Zarar’s wife and the latter is Gušt sp’s brother. According to Athenæus, Gušt sp (whose name is Hystaspes in Athenæus’ story), the king of Media, had a brother whose name was Zariadres. This Zariadres dreams about Hut ̈s (Odatis in Athenæus’ history), the daughter of Omartes, the king of Marathi, and he falls in love with her. Likewise, Hut ̈s dreams about Zariadres, and she falls in love with him as well. After some adventures these two marry each other (Boyce 1955: 463-477).

of being captured in Limbo (lines 205-208). However, in the Parsig version, Sur š and dur-yazd tell V r f that everyone whose good deeds are more than his evil deeds to the extent of three sr ̈š ̈ arn m will be in Paradise (VI.5). Vahman interprets this word «? Ç Û - စ Ð» sr š- arn m as the “name of a grade of sin and its punishment” (Vahman 1986: 274). This grade of sin must be a Zoroastrian standard that has been added to the text later, probably in Sassanid times or earlier. Ohrmazd declares to V r f that he should advise the people that the right path in the world is just one and every other way is misleading (lines 920-922) in the Zoroastrian Persian version. In the Parsig version, Ohrmazd tells V r f that he should convey to the M zdasn n, ‘the Mazda-worshippers’, that there is only one way of righteousnees, that is the way of the first teachers of the Mazdean religion (p ry tk š h), and the other ways are all misleading. (CI.7). The differences between these two texts indicate clearly that the first account is in accordance with the principles of human morality that invites to the truth and prohibits wicked ways. But in the second account, Ohrmazd just talks to the Mazdaworshippers, which here means the Zoroastrians. Additionally, here the previous religion of the Iranians and all other religions as well are disproved of. Thus the Zoroastrian Persian version is an account which still represents a less religious theme, whereas the Parsig version is entirely and obviously a religious account of Zoroastrianism. According to the twenty-seventh episode in the Zoroastrian Persian version one of the captives in Hell complains that he has no relatives or friends and has no one to help him (lines 579-581). This person talks to nobody in particular. This complaint and entreaty has in the Parsig version been replaced by a Gathic prayer, which this captive prays to Ohrmazd (XVII.5). Ohrmazd as the addressee of the captive in the Parsig version is a Zoroastrian addition to the text. It is not acceptable in any way that a Zoroastrian scribe or translator might neglect the name of Ohrmazd in a religious document and therefore it is obvious that the name of Ohrmazd has never been found in the Zoroastrian Persian version. The names of Viraf’s guides are mentioned as Sur š and Urd bihišt the Holy Immortal in the Zoroastrian Persian version, but they are Sur š and dur-yazd in the Parsig version. This has been discussed in the commentary. However, it seems probable that the differences between the names of these guides in the Parsig version and Zartušt Bahr m’s narrative in verse, as well as the Zoroastrian Persian version, from which it has been versified (Haug-West 1872: xix) is attributed to both the epical tendency of the Zoroastrian Persian version and the religious trend of the Parsig version (£ayb 2001: 11). According to the Parsig version, one of the sins that causes the spirits to be kept either in the Star-Station or in the Moon-Station and not to be



200
led to Paradise is because they have not done the xw d dah (kinmarriage) (VII.4; VIII.3). A woman who has violated the kin-marriage is being punished in Hell (LXXXVI.3). On the other hand, it is stated that the spirits who have done kin-marriage are reposing in Paradise (XII.8). There are no words of kin-marriage in the Zoroastrian Persian version. Encouraging kin-marriage and regarding it as a sin to refuse this form of marriage are all standards of Zoroastrian culture especially in Sassanid times, which have been added to the Parsig version but are absent in the Zoroastrian Persian version. At the end of the Zoroastrian Persian version, Ohrmazd tells V r f to return to the world to recount what he has witnessed to the people. In addition, he (Ohrmazd) recommends V r f to tell the truth and no lies, for Ohrmazd watches him (lines 915-917). However, V r f is not alerted to not telling the lies in the Parsig version (CI.3-4). The reason for this could be that he is described as a virtuous and a holy Zoroastrian there. This elimination of this warning from the Parsig version obviously points to this being a religious text. The name of W št sp (Gušt sp) is mentioned three times in the Parsig version (XI.2; XI.9; CI.9).215 But, there is no mention of this name in the Zoroastrian Persian version. Thus, the name of W št sp, the most significant defender of Zarathustra, must have been added to the Parsig version later on in the process of the Ard y-V r f N ma being changed into a religious-Zoroastrian text. V r f mentioned the name of Zardu[x]št (Zarathustra) six times in the Parsig version (I.1; III.6; XI.2; XI.9; XII.5; CI.9), but the name of Zartušt (Zarathustra) is only mentioned in the introduction of the Zoroastrian Persian version (lines: 10 (two times), 26, 35), and this name, in form of Zar tušt (Zarathustra), is repeated in the last episode (line: 925). Thus, the name of Zarathustra is neglected in four episodes of the Zoroastrian Persian version where it is found in the Parsig version. This is most fortunate for the argument. Neglecting the name of Zarathustra is never acceptable or reasonable, not even one time in a Zoroastrian oral account. Maybe it can be acceptable that the name of Zarathustra has been added somewhere in a Zoroastrian text either by mistake or perhaps due to strong faith. But, it is not reasonable at all that either the translator or the scribe copying or translating a religious-Zoroastrian account neglects the name of Zarathustra, the prophet, the greatest and the most important personality of Zoroastrianism. The non-existence of this name in these four places where the Zoroastrian Persian version in other details corresponds to the Parsig version indicates that the name has not existed there in the original mother-text of the Zoroastrian Persian version.
215 In addition to this, the name of “W št sp” has been mentioned as a relative adjective and with the form of w št sp n ‘of w št sp’ (II.15).



201
In the Parsig version, a number of Zoroastrian holy persons are mentioned. Firstly, after returning back from the Other World, V r f greets the dast r n (the authorities) and the h rbed n (teachers-priests) from Ohrmazd, Zarathustra, Sur š the righteous and dur-yazd in Paradise (III.6). Secondly, he tells about the excellent and illustrious places of Ohrmazd, the Holy Immortals, Zardu[x]št Spit m n, Kay-Wišt sp, J m sp and Isadw star, the son of Zarathustra (XI.2), and thirdly, he talks about the essence of Gay ̈mard, Zarathustra, Kay-Wišt sp, Fraš ̈štar, J m sp and the others in the same chapter (XI.9). Gignoux is correct when he states that the third list is a repetition of the second one, but without the names of Gay ̈mard and Fraš ̈štar. They are not in the list of the second subsection of the eleventh chapter, so they have been added to the text by a compiler (Gignoux 1984: 164). Anyhow, not just this third list has been added to the text. In fact, none of these three lists containing the name of these great and important personalities of Zoroastrianism are found in the Zoroastrian Persian version.216 The reason that there were no such lists in the first authentic and original version of the Ard y-V r f N ma is that it was not a Zoroastrian text. Thus, they who were involved in re-writing the Ard y-V r f N ma have added the above-mentioned names to make it a more religious-Zoroastrian text. The punishments of Hell do not exceed certain pains and torments in the Parsig version (Muᤱ n 1946: 43). However, the number of pains and torments are even less in the Zoroastrian Persian version. This indicates that ideas of various torments had not yet been formed in the time when the Zoroastrian Persian version was created. Thus, this same matter attests that the Zoroastrian Persian version is more ancient than the Parsig version. The descriptions of Paradise are not very elaborate in the Parsig version (ibid.), and the pictures of Paradise in the Zoroastrian Persian version are of a similar simple nature. But the portraits of happiness in the Zoroastrian Persian version are of a more pristine nature than in the Parsig version. This also attests to the antiquity of the Zoroastrian Persian version. ‘The river of tears’ is mentioned both in the Zoroastrian Persian version (lines: 552-574) and the Parsig version (XVI.1-7), as already discussed in the commentary. It is not impossible that “in this case, some topics have been taken from the ancient epics and have been admixed with new concepts” (£ayb 1994: 6). It seems as if this part may be one of the very authentic parts of the text. For, if this river existed in the Zoroastrian cosmogony, it should appear in other Zoroastrian works as well, which is not the case.
216 Differences between the names have been considered in the commentary.



202
Reciting the G h n is one of the most important good deeds in Zoroastrianism. According to the Zand version of Widawd d (Codex TD2 1979: 611), not reciting the G h n is one of the signs of an ahlom (heretic). The value and importance of reciting the G h n is mentioned five times in the Parsig version, once as a vital rite (II.17), twice as a mortal sin if not done, equivalent to rejecting kin-marriage and not praying (VII.4, VIII.3), and twice again as a great good deed, equal to kinmarriage, the reward of which is going to Paradise (IV.13, XII.5). However, in the Zoroastrian Persian version the importance of reciting the G h n is only mentioned once (lines 225-226), when the spirits have not been led to Paradise due to either not reciting the G h n and not doing nauz d and not praying. There is no mention of dancing in Paradise in the Parsig version. That is not very surprising. In spite of putting special emphasis on the necessity of happiness, there is neither a description of dancing nor even a word about the various kinds of dance in any of the Zoroastrian texts. However, in the Zoroastrian Persian version a kind of dancing known as Dast-band is mentioned twice as occurring in Paradise. In lines 421-422, a crowd of people who are performing the dance of Dast-band in Paradise are described. More important than that, in line 187, the Holy Immortals and one of the heavenly spirits are performing the dance of Dastband. According to pictures on earthenware discovered in Sialk of K š n in Iran, and as well in ašma-‘Al of the fourth millennium B.C., the dance of Dast-band/Dasta-band is a kind of very ancient dance in Iran.217 This matter attests both to the antiquity of the Zoroastrian Persian version and to the passages related to the dance of Dast-band, which are absent in the Parsig version. According to the Zoroastrian Persian version, V r f visits the places of the priests (the nineteenth episode), the warriors (the twentieth episode) and the farmers (the twenty-second episode) in Paradise. These are the very groups that constitute the Indo-Iranian social classes (Dumézil 1958: 7-8; Benveniste 1969: 279-292). However, the artisans have also been added to these three other classes in the Parsig version (XIV.10). This addition obviously indicates a newer structure of the Iranian social classes of the period when the Parsig version was formed. The artisan class did not exist in the society in which the Zoroastrian Persian version came into being. Benveniste also, in his studies about the social structure of Indo-Iranian society, accepted the presence of the artisans only with doubt. Therefore he put the name of this class in both the Iranian and the Indian societies in brackets (Ibid: 279). Thus, the Zoroastrian Persian ver
217 The dance of Dast-Band and the related earthenware illustrations have been discussed in the commentary.

sion is dependent on a pre-Zoroastrian Iranian society, and is more ancient than the Parsig version. The spirits of the teachers and scholars in Paradise are mentioned in the fifteenth chapter of the Parsig version (XV.8), which indicates a newer social structure. There is no mention of these two groups in the Zoroastrian Persian version. The Parsis (the Zoroastrians in India) believed in the entire message of the Ard y-V r f N ma until a century ago. Especially the parts related to women’s affairs and the sins committed by women were in the center of their appreciation, so that they used to weep and mourn when listening to them (Haug-West 1872: Lv). The sins of the women are especially emphasized among all the sins mentioned in the Parsig version (Tavadia 1956: 120). Additionally, according to this version the number of women’s sins is higher and their punishment more severe than those of men. The opposite is true for the Zoroastrian Persian version. The subject discussed is not only that women are guilty more than men. According to the Parsig version, women are not only guilty but also they are sinmakers,218 while it is not so in the Zoroastrian Persian version. The number of rewards in the Zoroastrian Persian version is higher than in the Parsig version, and likewise the number of punishments in the Zoroastrian Persian version is lower than in the Parsig version. There are 39 extra chapters in the Parsig version, of which there are no traces in the Zoroastrian Persian version. Although a number of these are new re-written versions of already existing chapters, the subject of all these 39 chapters is Zoroastrian religious regulations and the punishment in hell for disobeying them. The absence of these chapters in the Zoroastrian Persian version plainly indicates that these chapters have been added later on to the Ard y-V r f N ma by the Zoroastrians’ religious-men.
The above-mentioned evidence indicates that during the transformation of the text of the Ard y-V r f N ma, the matter was not just the replacement of the gods, the myths and the pre-Zoroastrian (Indo-Iranian) narratives with their Zoroastrian counterparts, which was also proposed at the beginning of the chapter. The replacement also included ideological changes of the Ard yV r f N ma text. All these changes were done to achieve a religious goal. Thus, the primitive form of the composer’s reflections on V r f’s journey was rubbed off and replaced by a religious-Zoroastrian concept. This had not yet been accomplished with the text on which the Zoroastrian Persian version was based. The ideological transformations of the text have moved even
218 It can be claimed that there is no such anti-feminist point of view in all the rest of the Iranian pre-Islamic literature as in the Parsig version of the Ard y-V r f N ma. Furthermore, although in its present form the Ard y-V r f N ma is among the Zoroastrian works, one cannot find such an anti-feminist view in the Zoroastrian religion.



204
further in the Parsig version than in the other versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma.
The differences between the Zoroastrian Persian version and the Parsig version indicate that, although the central part of both versions is the same, they are different from a philosophic viewpoint. This different point of view can be explained in brief as follows: In the Zoroastrian Persian version, the King is in the center of the supremacy (authority), and either he himself or his name has an omnipotent presence in the narration. This attests to the antiquity of the Zoroastrian Persian version in relation to the Parsig version. The Zoroastrian priests are also present in this narrative, but they don’t play a distinguished part here. But in the Parsig version the Zoroastrian priests are powerful individuals, and their crucial role in society is demonstrated many times. Furthermore, the king is totally absent as a figure in the Parsig version, and there is not even any mention of a king. The happiness of the Other World is more than its pain in the Zoroastrian Persian version. Hell occupies less space in the Zoroastrian Persian version; it is described in less detail and depicted as a less dreadful place as well. There are many more deeds which are important in Zoroastrianism and have the character of religious rules in the Parsig version than in the Zoroastrian Persian version. For this reason, the Parsig version has the nature of a religious-Zoroastrian account, while the Zoroastrian Persian version is more of an epic-Zoroastrian account. A number of names of the great personalities in Zoroastrianism which have been mentioned in the Parsig version are absent in the Zoroastrian Persian version. The number of rewards is much more in the Zoroastrian Persian version, but the number of punishments is less than in the Parsig version. The women are not guiltier than the men in the Zoroastrian Persian version, thus they are not punished more than the men.
The above-mentioned topics indicate that surely some Parsig versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma have existed in Iran from one of which the Zoroastrian Persian version was translated. Those versions were obviously different from the present Parsig version and much closer to the original version of this account. It is safe to assume that this original version lacked some of the religious-Zoroastrian narrations and themes present in the current Parsig version. If the Zoroastrian Persian version was newer than the Parsig version, it should have contained all religious parameters and themes directly or



205
indirectly related to Zoroastrian regulations which are present in the Parsig version.219
219 In this connection, it is surprising that there are no known traces in Iran of any manuscript in the original language, that is in Parsig, of a valuable and important work like the Ard yV r f N ma, a book which is a venerated book of the Zoroastrians. The versions versified by Zartušt Bahr m and N š rv n Kirm n are the only manuscripts of the Ard y-V r f N ma found in Iran.

X. Appendix: Dav n s
The forty-second episode of the Ard y-V r f N ma in the Zoroastrian Persian version is about a man called Dav n s whom Ard y-V r f visits in the Other World. Dav n s has been called a lazy man, who has not done any good in his lifetime due to his laziness. For this reason, the whole of his body except one foot is in Hell and the reptiles (xrafstar n) are eating his body. The reason for this is that once in his lifetime, it so happened that Dav n s with that foot pushed some grass towards a sheep, which was fastened far from the grass. Due to this single good deed, that same foot is out of Hell and is not tormented by the xrafstar n. This story is also mentioned in chapter 32 of the Parsig version of the Ard y-V r f N ma. A slightly different version of the story of Dav n s is recorded in a few other works besides the Ard y-V r f N ma. The Dav n s account is, with certain differences, also told in a quote from the Sipand Nask, which is one of the lost Nasks of Avesta, in the Š yest N -Š yest (ŠnŠ 1969: XII.29).220 The essential difference in the Sipand Nask is that instead of Ard y-V r f, it is Zarathustra who visits Dav n s in the Other World. The Sipand Nask version, meanwhile, represents a more complete form of the narration, because there Dav n s’ sovereignty and his rule over thirty-three countries is mentioned, and also that he had never done a good deed. The same quotation from the Sipand Nask in the Š yest N -Š yest, is found in the យaddar Na᠒r as well, but there is a difference there worth mentioning. There is no mention of the name of Dav n s in the យaddar Na᠒r, but only an account of a king who is in Hell. However, the យaddar Na᠒r version is more complete than the Š yest N -Š yest version. According to the យaddar Na᠒r, Dav n s ruled for many years. He committed much cruelty, injustice and tyranny. But one day while hunting he arrived in a place where he saw a sheep which was tied up (យDN 1909: IV.3-11).221
220 Kat y n Mazd p r, while presenting another rendering of this name in a different manuscript of the Š yest N -Š yest, holds that probably the name of « ဆÇ စ » Daw n s can be read « Çဆထ» Y nis as well (Mazd p r 1990: 172-173). The name Dav n s in Zoroastrian Persian, is found in the form of Y nis in manuscripts NPMO and as « Ç » in manuscripts N2L, which can have many different phonetic forms, such as Danis / Danus / Dunus / Dinus / Dunis. 221 There are more minor differences: according to the Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrian Persian and the Sipand Nask versions, one of the feet of Dav n s is standing out of Hell, but according to the Ard y-V r f N ma in Parsig and the យaddar Na᠒r, it is specified that it is his right foot which is standing out of Hell; Dav n s throws the grass towards a sheep according



208
In order to get a full picture of Dav n s’ story we need to combine the two versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma and the យaddar Na᠒r on Dav n s. The result of this combination is as follows: “And then we passed beyond that place and arrived at another place. I saw the soul of a man whose whole body was in hell except for one foot which was outside. And the vermin were not inflicting bites on that one foot. I asked Sur š-aš : ‘Whose soul is this?’ Sur š-aš said: ‘This is the soul of a man whose name was Dav n s. [He had been a king and he had ruled over thirty three countries222 and he had ruled for many years (យDN 1909: IV.5).] And he was so lazy that he had never done a good deed. [But he had done much cruelty, injustice and tyranny. It so happened that one day, he was going hunting. He arrived in a place, where he saw that a sheep was tied up. There was some grass far away, and that sheep was hungry. And it was trying to eat the grass, but did not gain access to that grass. This same king had thrown the grass near to the sheep with his foot223 (យDN 1909: IV.6-10).] Now, as a reward for that, his one foot is outside of hell, and all the rest of his body is in hell and the vermin are eating [it]’” (Ard y-V r f N ma: 42nd episode). Apart from these above-mentioned works, the name of Dav n s is also mentioned in two other places, namely in Yasna 31, verse 10 (Yasna XXXI 1878: 351) and in the ninth book of D nkard (DkM 1911: II.833). The true identity of Dav n s has been unknown from the time when Pope’s translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma was published (1816) to this day, whether in the translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma or in research done about this work and about both Yasna 31 and D nkard. It has not been decided yet what the correct form of the name is, neither to what language or culture it originally belongs. Moreover, no one has discovered what personality, mythical or historical, Dav n s was. It can be said in general that the researchers have had a wide range of opinions regarding this name, either in the Ard y-V r f N ma or in other texts: some have neglected it and some have supposed that it is a name and tried to find out its origin, furthermore, some have got it, not as a name but as a word or a form of a verb and have translated it thus. Here are some examples of research about this name that could be taken generally as a mirror of all researchers’ work on this topic.
to the Ard y-V r f N ma in Zoroastrian Persian, the Sipand Nask and the យaddar Na᠒r versions, but according to the Ard y-V r f N ma in the Parsig version, he throws the grass towards a ploughing ox. This change may have occurred due to the sacred position of the ox in Zoroastrianism. 222 The word šahr “city”, that means both “city” and “country” in Parsig and Zoroastrian Persian. 223 The last sentence can also be found in the Ard y-V r f N ma, but with a different structure.



209
Pope (1816: 71-73), has omitted the name of Dav n s in his translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma.
Jamaspji Asa, who was the first person to edit the Parsig version of the Ard y-V r f N ma, has noted that the name Dav n ̈s is mentioned in manuscripts H6 and K20 in the form of , and in the form of in manuscript H9, which has later been changed into the form of . He adds that, since the letter also reads as , kh [x], h, and the letter also reads as l, r, , , v, n, it follows theoretically that the name can be read in 6x3x6x6 forms, that is, in totally 648 different forms (Jamaspji Asa 1872: 63). He also supposes that possibly Dav n s is a Greek name (ibid.: 175). Haug, who refers to a note by Jamaspji Asa about ‘laziness’, also points to the Greek origin of the name of Dav n ̈s or Dan v ̈s in his translation from the Parsig version of the Ard y-V r f N ma into English, and he has written its Greek form as ( 2 2 = Danaos). After that, we find his transcription and English translation of the Sipand Nask recitation on Dav n s (ibid.). Later, in a glossary of the Ard y-V r f N ma, West and Haug introduce Dav n s as the governor of thirty-three countries and add that the reading of the name is uncertain (West and Haug 1874: II.237). Barthélemy, in his French translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma (1887: 55, 167, 174), has transcribed this name as Dav ns. He has also mentioned some similar narrations of the story to that found in the Parsig version of the Sipand Nask, Yasna 31, verse 10, the Sd Bd. (which must be understood as យaddar Bundahiš)224 and the fourth episode of the យaddar Na᠒r. He has also given a translation of the 29th section of the 12th chapter of the Sipand Nask (Š yest N -Š yest) in French after West’s translation. Barthélemy has also pointed to the resemblances between the Dav n s story and the theme of the 60th chapter of the Ard y-V r f N ma in the Parsig version. In this chapter, Ard y-V r f sees a man in Hell who is placed in a boiler pot to cook, but his right foot is out of the boiler pot. Sr ̈š and duryazd explain to V r f that this is because this man has killed a great number of xrafstar n (the reptiles) by the means of his right foot in the world. Barthélemy has compared the man’s persecution in the boiling pot to a part of Proserpine dans les Grenouilles [Proserpine in Frogs/The Frogs] by Aristophanes (about 446-386 B.C.), and as well to the Son d’Enfer [Song of Hell] by Raoul de Houdan, the French author of 12th century225 (Barthélemy 1887: 167, 174). Concerning this name, Dastur Kaikhusru Jamaspji Jamasp Asa in a new edition of the Parsig version of the Ard y-V r f N ma (1902: 37) transcribes it as Dav ns, referring to the Yasna 31, verse 10, and translates it as a “a
224 If Sd Bd. is indeed យaddar Bundahiš, this information is not correct since here is no mention of Dav n s in this work. 225 Barthélemy has written the 13th century.

cheat; a hypocrite”. Then, he points to the two versions of the Sipand Nask and the យaddar Na᠒r and translates a concise story of this ‘Dav ns’ told in the យaddar Na᠒r into English. He believes that “the story of the lazy Dav ns” told in the Ard y-V r f N ma, is directly taken from the Sipand Nask” (ibid: iii). In Maddox translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma, (1904: 39-40), like in that of Pope, this name is omitted. Vahman has the name of Daw nus as “deceitful” in the glossary that he has provided for the Ard y-V r f N ma (1977:19), and to explain this, he has written that Daw nus was the name of a tyrant and wicked governor (ibid: 71). Surely, the យaddar Na᠒r has been his source. In his translation of this work into Persian, Bah r states that Dav n s is similar to a name of Greek origin; however there is no certain knowledge of such a personality (Bah r 1983: 286, re-print 1996: 332). Gignoux, in his translation into French (1984: 181), has written this name as *Dav ns and has mentioned its Avestan form davas- and writes that this form of dw’nws can be a word of the Greek origin, plus -os. The readings Dav ns or Dav nos are suggested by Gignoux, but he also adds that this reading is still uncertain. He further notes that the name may have a historical background and has symbolized a lazy person. Vahman, in his English translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma (1986: 263), writes that this is an unidentified name, which according to the legends, refers to a tyrant ruler who neglected his religious duties. ‘Af f , in translating the Ard y-V r f N ma into Persian (1993: 46),226 has written this name as « ဆÇ စ » and has transcribed it Daw nus (ibid: 193) but there is no explanation of it.
Besides in the Ard y-V r f N ma, the Sipand Nask (Š yest N -Š yest) and the យaddar Na᠒r, the name Dav n s is mentioned both in Avesta: Yasna 31, and D nkard as well. In Haug’s translation (1878:351), which is the Zand (= Parsig) version of Yasna 31, he translates the name as “hypocrite”. Then, in an explanatory footnote, he writes the Avestan form of the name as dav s. He also indicates that the name has been mentioned in the Sipand Nask and the Ard y-V r f N ma, and transcribes it as Dav n ̈s, the form of the name in the Ard yV r f N ma.
In his translation from the Sipand Nask (1880: 350), West transcribes the name as Dav ns and in a footnote he explains that this name is the same dav s of Avestan which could be translated as “hypocrite”. Peshotan Sanjana, in his translation of D nkard (1922: XVII. 95),227 has translated this name two times, at first to d nm nishn h “hypocrisy” and the
226 The first publication of the Ard y-V r f N ma, translated by Rah m ‘Af f , took place in 1963. Unfortunately, I have not had access to it. 227 See also DkM 1911: II.833.

second time to d v ns h -ich “hypocritically”. He comments about the translation of this word that “[t]he d v ns h ch of the text evidently represents the davãschnia of the Avesta Yas. XXXI, 10c; and the Pazand d v ᝲsih ch in its Pahlavi” (ibid: 72, f.5). Humbach, in his translation from Yasna 31 into the German (1959: I.91), has read the name dav&scin and seems to translate it as “gute Erinnerung”. Kotwal has transcribed the name Daw ns in his translation (1969: 37) from the Sipand Nask in (the Š yest N -Š yest).
Insler has read the name dav&scin in his translation of Yasna 31 (1975: 39, 185), and translated it as “friendship”. While translating Yasna 31 (1988: I.115; III.67), Kellens and Pirart have read the name dauu&scin and avoided translating it. Mazd p r, while translating the Sipand Nask (1990: 162), has transcribed the name as Daw n s. Humbach in his translation into English (1991: I.128, II.67), has supposed that the name is a derived form of dauu&s, which means “shouting”, and has read the word dauu&scin in the text and translated it to “shout”. However, in spite of all that, the reference of the name Dav n s is still unknown.
The keys to a correct understanding of the name Dav n s are to be deduced from his life story in the Ard y-V r f N ma, the Sipand Nask and the យaddar Na᠒r, and one could profit from them to explore this personality. They are as follows: • The name of Dav n s and his sovereignty • The number of the countries dominated by Dav n s • Dav n s’ tyranny • The laziness of Dav n s and his not doing any good deed • Dav n s in Hell • Doing a single good deed
The name of Dav n s and his sovereignty
Hoshangji Jamaspji Asa (1872: 63) states that the name of Dav n s can be read in 648 forms in the Parsig. Following him, Gignoux (1984: 181) has also pointed to the different orthographies of this word in Parsig. Thus, the name of Dav n s can be taken as a misspelled form of a similar name. Fortunately, in one of the books written about the history of Iran, though only once, the name of « ဆÇစ » D vn s is mentioned. Ab al-8asan Mas‘ d (dead 346 A.H / 957 A.D.) in his book ဃဆío @ စ ÀဃÞo စ Mur j al- ahab va ma‘ din al-jawhar, writes in a chapter related to the kings of Babylon, Nabataeans and so forth (known as Chaldeans): « ခ ÈÌ ÄÅ 1⁄4 1 ñဒà စ ဂကÐ 1⁄4ဒÅဠÅ စ ^ 3⁄4 « ဆÇစ » ခ ÈÌ ÄÅ Èo 1⁄4 ñà| :ñဒà စ ဂကÐ « Ðဆ » ဂကÐ 1⁄4ထ Í « ဆÁ 1⁄2 » ခ ÈÌ ÄÅ Èo » “Then a king after him, Ma‘ s , [ruled] for one year, and it has been said that [he ruled] even less. After him,

one year, and it has been said that [he ruled] even less. After him, D vn s [ruled] for thirty-one years, and it has been said that [he ruled] even more. After him, Kasrj s [ruled] for twenty years.”(Mas‘ d 1964: 1.217). Here, it appears that the name D vn s is the same name Dav n s where the place of the two letters « » (alif) and «စ» (v v) have changed places. This is neither surprising nor unusual in manuscripts in Arabic script. In another book about Iran’s history composed earlier than Mas‘ d ’s work, we find the correct form of the name for the king, in a chapter with a similar account of kings. A9mad ibn-i ab -Ya‘q b, well-known as Ya‘q b (dead 292 A.H/904 A.D), has written in his book Ta’rix al-Ya‘q b in a chapter about the kings of Babylon228: « ÈÌ စ . င ô ¤Ð « Ðဆ » ÈÌ စ ဂကÐ 1⁄4ထ Í « ဆ3⁄4 1⁄2 » ÈÌ စ .ဂကÐ 1⁄4ဒÅဠÅ စ ^ 3⁄4 « ဆထ »» “And king Ma‘ s [ruled] seven months, and king D ry š [ruled] thirty–one years, and king Kasr9 š [ruled] twenty years” (Ya‘q b 1964: 1.69). Thus, the name of D ry š is recorded as Dav n s with several erroneous changes in the word. It occurred for the first time in Parsig in the form of Daw n s and in the Zoroastrian Persian texts in the form of Dav n s, and for the second time in the form of D wn s in the Mur j al- ahab va ma‘ din al-jawhar. However the form of D wn s is much closer to D ry š. The letter « » has changed to the letter «စ», the letter «}ထ» has changed to the letter «}Ç», which means that the two dots have changed into one and moved to a position above the letter, and the dots of the letter « » have been omitted and this letter has been like « ». This is not so improbable, with regard to several points: firstly, the name D ry š was never common in Iran in this form but in the form of D r . Moreover, it is possible that Mas‘ d quoted the name of D wn s from Greek works or even from works that had mentioned this name according to its Greek form where it was written Dareios. In this case, the difference between D wn s and Dareios is even less than the difference between Dav n s and D ry š mentioned above, because the last letter of these two names is the same in this case. Thus, D wn s is a little altered in relation to the Greek form Dareios. This view is supported by the fact that Mas‘ d records « ဆÁ 1⁄2 » (Kasrj s) and Ya‘q b « ဆ3⁄4 1⁄2 » (Kasr9 š) as the name of the successor of D wn s/D ry š. Both of these are the obviously misread forms of Xerxes, the Greek name for Xšay rš . The length of the rule of these kings, except that of D ry š, is the same as mentioned in historic sources: Maᤱ s / Bardiya- / Smerdis [Gaum ta]: seven months, Kasrj s / Kasr9 š / Xšay rš : twenty years (Wieseh⍢fer 1996: 313). In this context it is necessary to mention that anyone who has some knowledge about the Persian/Arabic characters, and is aware of the mistakes
228 It is worth mentioning in this history, that Dav n s/D r š and the other Achaemenian’s king ruling over Babylon and considering among the dynasties of Babylonian kings. However, this matter is not directly related to this discussion.



213
that may happen in manuscripts, especially while re-writing unknown names, will not find the change of the name D ry š to D wn s strange at all.
Another work that seems to mention Dav n s is the love poem V miq and ᤱAdhr composed by ᤱUn┰ur (c.970-c.1040 AD).229 There the name occurs in the form of Vad n š230, and he is a man who has sold ‘Adhr , the main female character of the story (Hägg-Utas 2003: 175). However, the compiler of Burh n- Q ti‘ mentions Dav n š, Danv š and Day n š as variants of this name (Tabr z 1983: 2.820). Another verse ascribed to this poem mentions a robber by name of Day n š (ibid.) One of these forms, namely Dav n š, seems to be identical with the Parsig form Dav n s, the difference being found just in the last letter « » “š”. Probably, the names Vad n š/ Dav n s also refer to D ry š, used in that form by ᤱUn┰ur , since the original name was forgotten among the Iranians, and then, for the same reason, the scribes introduced other variants in the manuscripts. This conclusion is supported by the fact that, in the same poem of V miq and ᤱAdhr , we find that ᤱUn┰ur has used the name of Dary š in the form D r , which is the form of Dary š that is later well-known among the Iranians (Hägg-Utas 2003: 176, 242, 245). It is not surprising that Daw n s has been written for D ry š or Darius in the Parsig version in view of Hoshangji Jamaspji Asa’s remark (1872: 63) that the name Daw n s can be read in 648 ways in Parsig. Haug has also recorded this name in the two forms Dav n ̈s and Dan v ̈s in his translation of the Ard y-V r f N ma (Parsig version) into English. This means that this name has been recorded at least in two different forms in the Parsig version.
The number of countries dominated by Dav n s
The number of countries ruled by Dav n s/D ry š are thirty-three according to the Sipand Nask and the យaddar Na᠒r. It must be said that is not easy to determine the exact number of the countries ruled by D ry š. The number of the countries varies between 31 in the Xerxes inscription (XPh), 29 in the inscription on the king’s tomb at Naqš-i Rustam (DNa), 27 in one of the Susa inscriptions (DSe), 24 in one of the four inscriptions placed on the south façade of the Persepolis terrace (DPe), and 23 in the Behistun inscription (DB) and one of the versions of the Susa foundation charter (DSaa) (Briant 2002: 172-173).231
229 I give my best thanks to professor Bo Utas for referring me to this source. 230 This is very probable that was a form of the name was been written mistakenly by the scrivener. Maybe the scrivener has recorded the letter « » “v” befor « » “d”; so Dav n š has changed to Vad n š. 231 The name of the subject countries of Darius are mentioned in five columns in the French text of Briant’s book, which displays the name of these countries in five inscriptions. But, the



214
On the other hand, according to the Naqš-i Rustam inscription, D ry š himself has declared: “If now thou shalt think that ‘How many are the countries which King Darius held?’ look at the sculptures [of those], who bear the throne” (ibid: 178). On the basis of this statement, the number of representatives of countries in the inscriptions on the king’s tomb at Naqš-i Rustam and Persepolis, who are found as throne bearers, numbers 30 all in all. However, the number of these representatives is 28 above the southern gate of the Hall of One Hundred Columns in Persepolis. Regarding the discrepancy between the number of subject countries and peoples of D ry š, an important point must be taken into consideration, namely: “it must thus be recognized that neither the lists nor the representations constitute administrative catalogues yielding a realistic image of the imperial realm. It was not administrative districts that the Great Kings wanted to represent. The word used in the inscriptions is dahyu- “people”.232 The Kings did not intend to give a list that was either complete or exact. The inscribed lists are nothing but a selection of subject countries” (ibid: 177). There is no mention of the number of the countries dominated by Dav n s/ D ry š, neither in Ya‘q b ’s nor in Mas‘ d ’s narrations. However, both of them have mentioned the years of his reign as 31 years, a point of view that is not accurately compatible with the historic evidences. D ry š ruled for 36 years, from the year 522 to 486 B.C. (Wieseh⍢fer 1996: 313). Ya‘q b (1964: 1.69) and Mas‘ d (1964: 1.217) records the years of D ry š’s reign as 31, although Mas‘ d states that “it has been said that [he ruled] even more” (Mas‘ d 1964: 1.217). Is it possible that one of the historians who, according to Mas‘ d , holds that the years of D ry š’s reign were more than 31, is referring to the 36 years that he actually ruled? Unfortunately, in none of the historical works written after Islam on the subject of Iran’s ancient history, we find exact records of the numbers of years that the kings of Iran ruled in pre-Islamic periods. In this connection, Ab -ma‘šar Balkh (dead 886 A.D.) says, “The records of the reign of the kings of Iran are very confusing and incorrect, even if there was a continuation from the establishment to the decline of their rule”233 (Ab -ma‘šar Balkh I┰fah n 1961: 14). He also adds that Iranians are in disagreement about the length of each king’s rule, as well. For example, some believe that Kay-Qub d ruled for 120 years, whereas some are of the opinion that his rule was even less than 10 years (ibid: 15).
name of the mentioned countries are recorded in six columns in the English translation of this work. The French text has missed the column that displays the Xerxes’ inscription. 232 The word dahyu- is translated in French with “people” (1996: 189) by Briant, and with “people” (2002: 177) by its English translator. However, Kent has translated dahyu- with “land, province and district” (Kent 1953: 190). 233 The phrase “the decline of their rule” means the end of Sasanians times and the beginning of the Islamic period in Iran.



215
This obscurity when it comes to the length of the rule of the Iranian Kings in Iranian historical works goes back to the early centuries of Islamic times in Iran. 8amza I┰fah n (dead 961 A.D.) came across this problem while composing his history book. He writes that “the record of the sovereignty of the Kings of Iran, on the whole, is an incorrect and confused matter, because during the first 150 years [after the Arab attack], while translating from a language into another, it changed from a simple numbering into a code character”234 (I┰fah n 1961: 13-14). Ab -ma‘šar Balkh also wrote that “most of the years in the history are confused and incorrect, because when the historic events of a nation that has lived for many years are either narrated from one book to another or translated into another language, some mistakes, both additions and deductions, normally occur (ibid: 14). Finally, it is important to remember that the number 33 is a holy and symbolic number in Zoroastrian literature. The numbers of the gods are 33 according to the Yasna (H t I.1-23); Y ̈št asks 33 questions from axt j d g, according to the M day n Y št Friy n (Haug-West 1872: 241-266); there are 33 roads to Paradise in the យaddar Na᠒r (1909: LXXIX.6-9); and An š rv n Kirm n , in his poem of the Kit b-i va᠀f-i amš spand n, has also described 33 Holy Immortals (Unv l 1922: II.164-192). Therefore, when the Dav n s story was re-written or copied, the number of the countries dominated by Dav n s/D ry š changed from 23, 24, 27, 29 or 31, to 33.
Dav n s’ tyranny
Cambyses (Old Persian: Kab jiya; Greek: Kambyses), the second king of the Achaemenian dynasty, appointed a Magian called Patizeithes235 to take care of his house in his absence while he travelled to Egypt. Cambyses had a brother called Smerdis (Old Persian: Bardiya-, Greek Smerdis)236 who was put to death by Cambyses, because he was anxious that this brother may gain royal power.237 However, no one was aware of this assassination. Cambyses journey to Egypt and his absence in Iran lasted for a long time. Patizeithes had a brother who was also a Magian and looked very much like Smerdis, and accidentally bore the same name as Smerdis, too. Thus Patizeithes brought his brother and placed him on the royal throne in March of the year

522 B.C. and announced that he was the same Smerdis, Cambyses’ brother. Hearing this, Cambyses departed for Susa (Š š) to regain his sovereignty, but he died on the way. When he was dying, he begged the great ones of Persia not to allow the sovereignty to fall into Median hands again (Herodotus 1963: Book III.61-65). Seven months after the reign of Smerdis, Darius (Old Persian: D rayavauš, Greek: Dareios), the son of Hystaspes (Old Persian: Višt spa-, Greek: Hystaspes) and the governor of P rs/Persis, who had come to Susa accompanied by his six comrades, attacked the royal palace in September 29 of the year 522 B.C. They killed Patizeithes and his brother, and they cut off their heads. Then, five persons of them ran out of the palace to let the people know that this Smerdis was a false one. Outside the palace they killed every Magian that came in their way. The Persians, as well, resolved to follow Darius and his comrades’ example. They slew all the Magians they could find, and if nightfall had not stopped them, they would not have left one Magian alive (ibid: III.70-79). Afterwards, they celebrated a great festival on the memorial day of this event every year, which they called the ‘Massacre of the Magians’ ($2&'( ¶2 = magofonia). This was the greatest state festival of the Persians, and during this day no Magians dared to come out of their houses (ibid: III.79). Smerdis ruled for seven months, and during this time he accomplished many great things. Among them, he proclaimed all his subjects free from service in arms and from tribute for three years. After his death all the inhabitants of Asia except the Persians mourned him238 (ibid: III.67).239 In view of the massacre of the Magians which was ordered by Darius/Dav n s’s order and under his supervision, it can be supposed that from a Magian viewpoint such a king “has never done a good deed, but has also committed much tyranny, injustice and cruelty” (យDN 1909: IV.6).
238 Four narrations of the Smerdis event are available to us; the Behistun inscription (DB, DBb), and the accounts of Herodotus (1963: Book III.61-79), Ctésias (1947: La Perse.10-13) and Iustinus (1935: I.10), the latter founded on an account by G. Pompeius Trogus (1st century BC), in its turn founded on an account by Dinon (c. 360-340 BC). Here only Herodotus’ narration has been used because it is more detailed than the others. For a comparison of these four versions, the reader is referred to T r x-i m d (The History of the Medians) by Diakonov (1978: 391-400) and to From Cyrus to Alexander, A History of the Persian Empire by Briant (2002: 97-114). 239 In consideration of the Herodotus report and the Behistun inscription, on the subject of the situation of some people of the society who were the followers of Smerdis and the sections who were against him, Diakonov writes that: “It should not be exaggerated and supposed that Gaum ta- had been a revolutionary and that he fought for the freedom of the Medians [...] he called himself a Persian and a Achaemenian and therefore he did not intend to bring back the previous independence to the Medians [...] he had taken his authority through a courtly coupd’état and was destroyed through another coup-d’état” (Diakonov 1978: 397, 399).

The laziness of Dav n s and his not doing any good deed
In the heading of the story about Dav n s in the Zoroastrian Persian version of the Ard y-V r f N ma, Dav n s is characterized by an adjective ažgahan, which means “lazy”. In the Parsig version of the Ard y-V r f N ma, Dav n s is also called Dav n s ajgah n “the lazy Dav n s”. With regard to the theme of this episode it seems that the laziness of Dav n s does not mean indolence but to be lazy in doing good deeds, according to both the Zoroastrian Persian and Parsig versions. There is no word of the laziness of Dav n s in the Sipand Nask and the យaddar Na᠒r versions, where he is instead characterized as cruel and unjust. It appears that the word «1⁄4ငÙ » ažgahan and « Ìဃ » k hil “laziness”, both in the heading and in the text body of the Zoroastrian Persian version, and the word ajgah n in the Parsig version of the Ard y-V r f N ma replace the epithet of unjust and cruel in these two texts. It means that the authors of the Parsig and Zoroastrian Persian versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma have been led to renounce “the injustice and the tyranny” of the king and instead of that they have characterized the king as a lazy person. This change could have taken place already at a time when the dynasty of Dav n s/Darius was still ruling, and out of fear the authors of these texts may well have changed the cruelty of Dav n s into laziness as the reason why he did not do any good deeds. This appears plausible considering the fact that there is no indication of reasons for the laziness the Dav n s, nor for the manner of his laziness in any of these two versions of the Ard y-V r f N ma.
Dav n s in Hell
V r f, in the Ard y-V r f N ma, and Zarathustra, in the Sipand Nask and the យaddar Na᠒r, visit Dav n s in Hell. First of all, it can be said that this indicates that the Dav n s story has been famous to such an extent that it has utilized in different texts. Also, the fact that he is in Hell is clear evidence of his being guilty, or, in other words, that he did not do any good deed. Thus, naturally, everyone who travels to the Other World will see Dav n s in his special situation, with most of his body in Hell while one foot is outside Hell.
Doing a single good deed
The only point that is unclear in Dav n s’ story is his single good deed: throwing a bundle of grass in front of a hungry sheep/cow. Is this act a general symbol of a good deed? Is it a symbol for a good deed done by a king



218
who has never elsewhere done any virtuous deed? Unfortunately, there are no clues in the narrations to the answer to these questions. The original single good deed has been forgotten on account of narrating the story symbolically.
Conclusion
Smerdis is the most important and the most well-known personality among the antagonists and rivals who were punished by Darius; he was dethroned and killed. The Magians are also the most significant suppressed group in Darius’ period. Thus, the Magians are the group of people in Iranian territories, who would have a most reason to describe Darius/Dav n s as a cruel, unjust and tyrannical person. The Magians performed all religious ceremonies as priests (men of religion) in ancient Iran. They still retained their influence after Zoroastrianism became widespread. Messina writes that the Magi themselves were the only true heirs of Zoroaster who faithfully transmitted his doctrines (Messina Zaehner 1961: 161). Besides, they made themselves indispensible at all kinds of religious ceremonies, whether Zoroastrian or otherwise (ibid: 162163). The influence of the Magi was so widespread that they enjoyed a monopoly of religious affairs not only in their native Media but also in Persis and the whole western half of the Achaemenian Empire (ibid: 161). In addition to this, the Magi were considered to be philosophers, and they were the teachers of the Achaemenian kings (ibid: 164). However, they belonged to the Median tribes and they could not uphold their former position after the Medians were defeated by the Achaemenians. By piecing together the story of Dav n s with the account of Darius and Smerdis as well as that of the massacre of the Magians, we find that the most logical conclusion, which, of course, contains a certain amount of speculation, is the one presented below. Unfortunately a big part of this jig-saw puzzle is still missing. Therefore, the picture formed by these pieces necessarily differs from the picture that would emerge if we had more details. In their precarious situation the Magians tried to refrain from recalling the memories of Smerdis murder and after that the massacre of the Magians, in order to protect their social position and safeguard their own and their people’s interests. Since the Achaemenians ruled over the country more than 150 years after Darius (until the death of Darius III in 330 B.C.), it was not possible to retell this story in public for fear of the government officials. It would not even be possible to retell the incident in family gatherings or circles of friends without omitting some parts of the story which may be dangerous. The result of this would naturally be that details, names and essential elements of the story were forgotten and that some details lost their original meaning. On the other hand, it is possible that some parts of the incident



219
were retold symbolically, because both the narrator and the audiences knew the symbols. Possibly, the good deed in Dav n s’ story is among the symbols whose origin has been forgotten. However, there were traces in the memories of the Magians that became paler during the times, a trace which was recorded finally in the Dav n s story. The story of Dav n s must have been created after the death of Darius. Furthermore, it seems that the incoherent versions we have at our disposal are from a time when there was no remembrance of Darius, Smerdis and his brother, and of the murder of the Magians. Possibly, we can never find out clearly how comprehensive the Dav n s story was from the beginning. Anyhow, it is likely that it was more voluminous that what is left to us. The most important evidence to support this view is the three versions that supply three different forms of the story. These are differences that may have come about due to the fear of punishment. Fear may have caused the elimination of the name Dav n s in the យaddar Na᠒r version and also the elimination of any mention of Dav n s’ sovereignty in the Ard y-V r f N ma. This same vigilance may have caused the removal of any reference to the cruelty, injustice and the tyranny of Dav n s in the Sipand Nask version.240 In other words, the self-censorship, in ways that are familiar in its various forms in our time, closed the road to the Dav n s / Darius story being written down in a complete form in the old world. The Ard y-V r f N ma narration, in which there is no mentioning of Dav n s’ sovereignty and where only his laziness is mentioned, and the narrative of the យaddar Na᠒r, where the name of Dav n s is not mentioned, show to what extent this story has changed. It is thus impossible to get an image of the origin of this historical event by just looking at one account of the story. It is not important when the Dav n s story has been incorporated into the Ard y-V r f N ma or in which work it was originally found. What is important is that narrators and scribes have included this text and that they have regarded religious works as the most appropriate place for this text to be preserved. One of these works is Ard y-V r f N ma. Finally, perhaps the most important point in Dav n s story is that the image of Dav n s/Darius and the account of his life have been placed not in this world but in the Other World. Exposing Dav n s in the Other World was perhaps a way to conceal the true identity of the story of Dav n s/Darius, at least at first impression, and in this way diminish the danger for the rewriters, scribes, the holders of the manuscripts and all those who took part in transmitting the story.
240 Thus, the claim by Kaikhusru Jamaspji Jamasp Asa that the Dav n s story of the Ard yV r f N ma has been directly cited from the Sipand Nask (K. Jamaspji Asa 1902: iii) cannot be accepted. If that was the case, the Dav n s story in the different versions of the Ard yV r f N ma should also have contained the important points of Sipand Nask, the sovereignty of Dav n s and his ruling over thirty-three countries.



220
Can it indeed not be considered as a great success for those who guarded and transmitted the Dav n s/Darius story that the true identity of this person has now been rediscovered?

Index of old words, terms and verbs of the text
Each word has a number which indicates the line number of its first occurrence in the edited text. The verbs are not written in the index as they are used in the text body, but in their infinitive forms. For example « » na-yaštand is recorded as -» « yaštan.
Some words in this index have different forms that belong to various manuscripts, which are explained in footnotes. For example, the word « » nvad is written as « » nvar and « » invad as well.
