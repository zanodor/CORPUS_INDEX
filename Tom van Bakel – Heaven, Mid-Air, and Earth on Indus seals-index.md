Heaven, Mid-Air, and Earth on Indus seals
H-1011
I found out that these two wombs symbolize the goddesses Heaven and Earth. According to Rigveda 1-160 they are a widely-capacious Pair created by the Father:
Rigveda 1-160 called: ‘Heaven and Earth’.
1. These, Heaven and Earth, bestow prosperity on all, sustainers of the region, Holy Ones and wise, Two Bowls of noble kind: between these Goddesses the God, the fulgent Sun, travels by fixed decree. 2 Widely-capacious Pair, mighty, that never fail, the Father and the Mother keep all creatures safe: The two world-halves, the spirited, the beautiful, because the Father hath clothed them in goodly forms. 3 Son of these Parents, he the Priest with power to cleanse, Sage, sanctifies the worlds with his surpassing power. Thereto for his bright milk he milked through all the days the party-coloured Cow and the prolific Bull. 4 Among the skilful Gods most skilled is he, who made the two world-halves which bring prosperity to all; Who with great wisdom measured both the regions out, and stablished them with pillars that shall ne'er decay. 5 Extolled in song, O Heaven and Earth, bestow on us, ye mighty Pair, great glory and high lordly sway, Whereby we may extend ourselves ever over the folk; and send us strength that shall deserve the praise of men.



M-0619
When the two wombs overlap each other a third is created that symbolizes the Mid-Air. Earth, Mid-Air and Heaven are mentioned several times in the Rigveda, including in a hymn for Indra:
Rigveda 1-61 called: ‘Indra’.
9 ‘Yea, of a truth, his magnitude surpasseth the magnitude of Earth, Mid-Air, and Heaven.
Indra, approved by all men, self-resplendent, waxed in his home, loud-voiced and strong for battle’.
According to Rigveda 10-90, the Mid-Air comes from the navel of Purusa the Sky was formed from his head and the Earth from his feet:
Rigveda 10-90 called: ‘Purusa’.
13 ‘The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the Sun had birth; Indra and Agni from his mouth were born, and Vayu from his breath.
14 Forth from his navel came Mid-Air the Sky was fashioned from his head
Earth from his feet, and from his car the regions. Thus they formed the worlds’.
In the Indus Valley, Devasena was the chief storm deity and thus she was the goddess of the Mid-Air. So, Sky, Mid-Air and Earth were three goddesses who were born from the same father, which meant that they were three sisters.
Hymns and quotations from: ‘The Hymns of the Rigveda, Translated by Ralph T. H. Griffith, 2nd edition, Kotagiri (Nilgiri) 1896.’

This seal contains two wombs, a larger one containing a smaller one. These matching wombs symbolize that Heaven and Earth are united. But on the right is a god who separates these two wombs with a knife.
According to the Rigveda, different gods separate Heaven and Earth from each other and one of them is Vishnu:
Rigveda 7-99 called: ‘Vishnu’.
3 ‘Rich in sweet food be ye, and rich in milch-kine, with fertile pastures, fain to do men service.
Both these worlds, Vishnu, hast thou stayed asunder, and firmly fixed the Earth with pegs around it’.
Vishnu is a sun god and on seals he is represented by tigers (among others).
Another sun god that separates Heaven and Earth from each other is Mitra:
Rigveda 6-8 called ‘Agni’. 3 ‘Wonderful Mitra propped the Heaven and Earth apart, and covered and concealed the darkness with his light.
He made the two bowls part asunder like two skins. Vaisvanara put forth all his creative power’.
In this verse Heaven and Earth are described as two bowls.



H-142
And on this tablet these bowls are represented by two curves. A bird is engraved between them. It symbolizes a storm god, just as a fish symbolizes a water god and a tiger symbolizes a sun god. This bird between the two curves demonstrates that a storm god stays apart the two confronting bowls, just like Indra does:
Rigveda 10-44 called: ‘Indra’.
8 ‘He firmly fixed the plains and mountains as they shook. Dyaus thundered forth and made the air's mid-region quake.
He stays apart the two confronting bowls; he sings lauds in the potent Soma's joy when he hath drunk’.
H-1712
Again, Devasena is the chief storm deity in the Indus Valley Civilization, so she is the one who represented by this bird: it’s body is therefore depicted as a womb. Like Indra, she has filled the Mid-Air region:
Rigveda 7-98 called: ‘Indra’.
3 ‘Thou, newly-born, for strength didst drink the Soma; the Mother told thee of thy future greatness.
O Indra, thou hast filled Mid-Air's wide region, and given the Gods by battle room and freedom’.



M-1291 a
The fourth god separating Heaven and Earth is Varuna symbolized here by a fish:
Rigveda 7-86 called: ‘Varuna’.
1. ‘Wise, verily, are creatures through his greatness who stayed ever, spacious Heaven and Earth asunder;
Who urged the high and mighty sky to motion, the Star of old, and spread the Earth before him’.
This seal shows two almost identical curves, only the right one carries a flag: in Rigveda 7-76 we read that the morning holds up its flag:
Rigveda 7-76 called: ‘Dawn’.
2 ‘I see the paths which Gods are wont to travel, innocuous paths made ready by the Vasus.
Eastward the flag of Dawn hath been uplifted; she hath come hither o'er the tops of houses. 3 Great is, in truth, the number of the Mornings which were aforetime at the Sun's uprising. Since thou, O Dawn, hast been beheld repairing as to thy love, as one no more to leave him’.
This means that the separation of Heaven and Earth took place at dawn.



M-887 a
Also on this seal are two wombs where the smaller fits into the larger, symbolizing that they are united. And here too there is a god who separates these two wombs with a knife.
As far as I am concerned, the unicorn symbolizes the god Murugan who is identified with four other gods: Vishnu, Varuna, Indra and Kali. Above we already saw that three of them separated Heaven and Earth. But on this seal Murugan apparently does that himself. Murugan is the god of Krittika, a nakshatra that is symbolized by a knife (among other things). Here Murugan uses this knife to separate Heaven and Earth.
M-1278
Again, Devasena, depicted like a bird, held the Heaven and the Earth asunder just like Indra:
Rigveda 6-44 called: ‘Indra’. 24 ‘He stayed and held the Heaven and Earth asunder: the chariot with the sevenfold reins he harnessed. This Soma Set with power within the milch-kine a spring whose ripe contents ten fingers empty’.
In fact, we see here side by side the Earth, the left curve, Mid-Air, the bird and Heaven, the right curve.



M-605 A M-605 B
These are the front and back of a tablet. On the front is an ‘antler’ sign which symbolizes Devasena. On the back we see two wombs overlapping other so that a third one is created. An ‘antler’ sign has been added to these three wombs and as far as I am concerned this sign shows that Devasena is indeed the goddess who is between Heaven and Earth.
Devasena is not mentioned in the Rigveda, but it is equal to Indra and in several Rigveda hymns it is located between Heaven and Earth.
Rigveda 3-46 called: ‘Indra’.
3 ‘He hath surpassed all measure in his brightness, yea, and the Gods, for none may be his equal.
Impetuous Indra in his might exceedeth wide vast Mid-Air and Heaven and Earth together’.
In Rigveda 7-23 Indra forced with his might the two world-halves asunder, which is a kind of recreation:
Rigveda 7-23 called: ‘Indra’.
3 The Bays, the booty-seeking car I harness: my prayers have reached him who accepts them gladly.
Indra, when he had slain resistless foemen, forced with his might the two worldhalves asunder.
But in Rigveda 10-90 we already have read that Purusa is the father of Mid-Air, Sky and Earth:
Rigveda 10-90 called: ‘Purusa’.
13 ‘The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the Sun had birth; Indra and Agni from his mouth were born, and Vayu from his breath.
14 Forth from his navel came Mid-Air the Sky was fashioned from his head
Earth from his feet, and from his car the regions. Thus they formed the worlds’.
But in hymn 10-120 we read that Heaven and Earth are the mothers of Indra (and therefore also of Devasena):
Rigveda 10-120 called: ‘Indra’.
9 ‘Thus hath Brhaddiva, the great Atharvan, spoken to Indra as himself in person.
The spotless Sisters, they who are his Mothers, with power exalt him and impel him onward’.
So there appear to be different creation stories side by side.



H-132
Rohini Punarvasu
Aditi, the goddess of Heaven and Earth, is the Deity of Punarvasu. At that time, the sun passed this nakshatra in April. The triple womb sign thus gives an indication of time.
7; 5 Punarvasu, Translation of Name: ‘Breath again’; Range: 20°00' Gemini — 3°20' Cancer Symbol: quiver full of arrows Deity: Aditi

M-368
And on this seal three small stripes are depicted within the three wombs, symbolizing that Earth, Heaven and Mid-Air contain abundant seed.
Rigveda 10-92 called: ‘Visvedevas’. 11 ‘For these, the Earth and Heaven with their abundant seed, four-bodied Narasmsa, Yama, Aditi, God Tvastar Wealth-bestower, the Rbhuksanas, Rodasi, Maruts, Vishnu, claim and merit praise’.
H-1711
All in all, when the two wombs overlap each other then a third womb emerge and then we see Aditi who is the Heaven, who is the Mid-Air, and who is the Mother (Earth):
Rig Veda 1-89 called:’Visvedevas’ 10 ‘Aditi is the Heaven, Aditi is Mid-Air, Aditi is the Mother and the Sire and Son. Aditi is all Gods, Aditi five-classed men, Aditi all that hath been born and shall be born.’
Again, the three wombs symbolize three goddesses: Heaven, Mid-Air (Devasena) and Earth mentioned several times in the Rigveda:
Rigveda 10-59 called ‘Nirrti and Others’. 7 ‘May Earth restore to us our vital spirit, may Heaven the Goddess and Mid-Air restore it.
May Soma give us once again our body, and Pusan show the Path of peace and comfort.’
Because Devasena is the storm goddess in the Indus Valley Civilization, she was the sister of Heaven and Earth when they all emerged from Purusa.
