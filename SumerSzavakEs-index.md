Sumerian Dictionary
Every letter must be pronounced. There are no silent syllables in Sumerian. Hence, "KIA" is pronounced "KEE=ya"; "KAIMANU" is pronounced "ka=ee=MAH=nu".
Vowels=
a as in "father" e as in "whey" i as in "Antique" o as in "boat" (but rarely found) u as in "Zulu"
Consonants=
Most consonants are basically the same as in English. The Sumerians did not have an alphabet as we know it, but they had developed a syllabary, very much like the Japanese "Kana" script of today. In phonetic transliterations, the English spelling sought to approximate the Sumerian pronunciation. However, there are a few sounds, which English does not possess, and which have been put into phonetic variations. Important examples below=
X as in German "ach" CH (Same as above) Q as in "like" K (Same as above) SH as in "Shall" SS as in, perhaps, "lasso"; a hissing "s" common to Arabic languages Z as in "pizza" a hard "ts" sound, not quiet as in "zoo"
