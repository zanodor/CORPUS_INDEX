Published in the 1900's
In presenting my readers with some of the data which show that much of the Christian History was pre
extant as Egyptian Mythology. I have to ask you to bear in mind that the facts, like other foundations,
have been buried out of sight for thousands of years in a hieroglyphical language, that was never really
read by Greek or Roman, and could not be read until the lost clue was discovered by Champollion,
almost the other day! In this way the original sources of our Mytholatry and Christology remained as
hidden as those of the Nile, until the century in which we live. The mystical matter enshrouded in this
language was sacredly entrusted to the keeping of the buried dead, who have faithfully preserved it as
their Book of Life, which was placed beneath their pillows, or clasped to their bosoms, in their coffins and
their tombs.
Secondly, although I am able to read the hieroglyphics, nothing offered to you is based on my translation.
I work too warily for that! The transcription and literal rendering of the hieroglyphic texts herein employed
are by scholars of indisputable authority. There is no loophole of escape that way. I lectured upon the
subject of Jesus many years ago. At that time I did not know how we had been misled, or that the
"Christian scheme" (as it is aptly called) in the New Testament is a fraud, founded on a fable in the Old!
I then accepted the Canonical Gospels as containing a veritable human history, and assumed, as others
do, that the history proved itself. Finding that Jesus, or Jehoshua Ben-Pandira, was an historical
character, known to the Talmud, I made the common mistake of supposing that this proved the personal
existence of the Jesus found portrayed in the Canonical Gospels. But after you have heard my story, and
weighed the evidence now for the first time collected and presented to the public, you will not wonder that
I should have changed my views, or that I should be impelled to tell the truth to others, as it now appears
to myself; although I am only able to summarize here, in the briefest manner possible, a few of the facts
that I have dealt with exhaustively elsewhere. The personal existence of Jesus as Jehoshua Ben-Pandira
can be established beyond a doubt. One account affirms that, according to a genuine Jewish tradition
"that man (who is not to be named) was a disciple of Jehoshua Ben-Perachia." It also says, "He was born
in the fourth year of the reign of the Jewish King Alexander Jannæus, notwithstanding the assertions of
his followers that he was born in the reign of Herod." That would be more than a century earlier than the
date of birth assigned to the Jesus of the Gospels! But it can be further shown that Jehoshua Ben
Pandira may have been born considerably earlier even than the year 102 B.C., although the point is not of
much consequence here. Jehoshua, son of Perachia, was a president of the Sanhedrin -- the fifth,
reckoning from Ezra as the first: one of those who in the line of descent received and transmitted the oral
law, as it was said, direct from Sinai. There could not be two of that name. This Ben-Perachia had begun
to teach as a Rabbi in the year 154 B.C. We may therefore reckon that he was not born later than
180-170 B.C., and that it could hardly be later than 100 B.C. when he went down into Egypt with his pupil.
For it is related that he fled there in consequence of a persecution of the Rabbis, feasibly conjectured to

refer to the civil war in which the Pharisees revolted against King Alexander Jannæus, and consequently
about 105 B.C. If we put the age of his pupil, Jehoshua Ben-Pandira, at fifteen years, that will give us an
approximate date, extracted without pressure, which shows that Jehoshua Ben-Pandira may have been
born about the year 120 B.C. But twenty years are a matter of little moment here. According to the
Babylonian Gemara to the Mishna of Tract "Shabbath," this Jehoshua, the son of Pandira and Stada,
was stoned to death as a wizard, in the city of Lud, or Lydda, and afterwards crucified by being hanged
on a tree, on the eve of the Passover. This is the manner of death assigned to Jesus in the Book of Acts.
The Gemara says there exists a tradition that on the rest-day before the Sabbath they crucified
Jehoshua, on the rest-day of the Passah (the day before the Passover). The year of his death, however,
is not given in that account; but there are reasons for thinking it could not have been much earlier nor
later than B.C. 70, because this Jewish King Jannæus reigned from the year 106 to 79 B.C. He was
succeeded in the government by his widow Salomè, whom the Greeks called Alexandra, and who
reigned for some nine years. Now the traditions, especially of the first "Toledoth Jehoshua," relate that
the Queen of Jannæus, and the mother of Hyrcanus, who must therefore be Salomè, in spite of her being
called by another name, showed favour to Jehoshua and his teaching; that she was a witness of his
wonderful works and powers of healing, and tried to save him from the hands of his sacerdotal enemies,
because he was related to her; but that during her reign, which ended in the year 71 B.C., he was put to
death. The Jewish writers and Rabbis with whom I have talked always deny the identity of the Talmudic
Jehoshua and the Jesus of the Gospels. "This," observes Rabbi Jechiels, "which has been related to
Jehoshua Ben-Perachia and his pupil, contains no reference whatever to him whom the Christians
honour as God!" Another Rabbi, Salman Zevi, produced ten reasons for concluding that the Jehoshua of
the Talmud was not he who was afterwards called Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus of Nazareth (and of the
Canonical Gospels) was unknown to Justus, to the Jew of Celsus, and to Josephus, the supposed
reference to him by the latter being an undoubted forgery.
The "blasphemous writings of the Jews about Jesus," as Justin Martyr calls them, always refer to
Jehoshua Ben-Pandira, and not to the Jesus of the Gospels. It is Ben-Pandira they mean when they say
they have another and a truer account of the birth and life, the wonder-working and death of Jehoshua or
Jesus. This repudiation is perfectly honest and soundly based. The only Jesus known to the Jews was
Jehoshua Ben-Pandira, who had learnt the arts of magic in Egypt, and who was put to death by them as
a sorcerer. This was likewise the only Jesus known to Celsus, the writer of the "True Logos," a work
which the Christians managed to get rid of bodily, with so many other of the anti-Christian evidences.
Celsus observes that he was not a pure Word, not a true Logos, but a man who had learned the arts of
sorcery in Egypt. So, in the Clementines, it is in the character of Ben-Pandira that Jesus is said to rise
again as the magician. But here is the conclusive fact: The Jews know nothing of Jesus, the Christ of the
Gospels, as an historical character; and when the Christians of the fourth century trace his pedigree, by
the hand of Epiphanius, they are forced to derive their Jesus from Pandira! Epiphanius gives the
genealogy of the Canonical Jesus in this wise:-
Jacob, called Pandira, Mary - Joseph -- Cleopas, Jesus.
This proves that in the fourth century the pedigree of Jesus was traced to Pandira, the father of that
Jehoshua who was the pupil of Ben-Perachia, and who becomes one of the magicians in Egypt, and who
was crucified as a magician on the eve of the Passover by the Jews, in the time of Queen Alexandra,
who had ceased to reign in the year 70 B.C.--the Jesus, therefore, who lived and died more than a
century too soon.

Thus, the Jews do not identify Jehoshua Ben-Pandira with the Gospel Jesus, of whom they, his
supposed contemporaries, know nothing, but protest against the assumption as an impossibility; whereas
the Christians do identify their Jesus as the descendant of Pandira. It was he or nobody; yet he was
neither the son of Joseph nor the Virgin Mary, nor was he crucified at Jerusalem. It is not the Jews, then,
but the Christians, who fuse two supposed historic characters into one! There being but one history
acknowledged or known on either side, it follows that the Jesus of the Gospels is the Jehoshua of the
Talmud, or is not at all, as a Person. This shifts the historic basis altogether; it antedates the human
history by more than a hundred years, and it at once destroys the historic character of the Gospels,
together with that of any other personal Jesus than Ben-Pandira. In short, the Jewish history of the
matter will be found to corroborate the mythical. As Epiphanius knew of no other historical Jesus than the
descendant of Pandira, it is possible that this is the Jesus whose tradition is reported by Irenæus.
Irenæus was born in the early part of the second century, between 120 and 140 A.D. He was Bishop of
Lyons, France, and a personal acquaintance of Polycarp; and he repeats a tradition testified to by the
elders, which he alleges was directly derived from John, the "disciple of the Lord," to the effect that Jesus
was not crucified at 33 years of age, but that he passed through every age, and lived on to be an oldish
man. Now, in accordance with the dates given, Jehoshua Ben-Pandira may have been between 50 and
60 years of age when put to death, and his tradition alone furnishes a clue to the Nihilistic statement of
Irenæus.
When the true tradition of Ben-Pandira is recovered, it shows that he was the sole historical Jesus who
was hung on a tree by the Jews, not crucified in the Roman fashion, and authenticates the claim now to
be made on behalf of the astronomical allegory to the dispensational Jesus, the Kronian Christ, the
mythical Messiah of the Canonical Gospels, and the Jesus of Paul, who was not the carnalised Christ.
For I hold that the Jesus of the "other Gospel," according to the Apostles Cephas and James, who was
utterly repudiated by Paul, was none other than Ben-Pandira, the Nazarene, of whom James was a
follower, according to a comment on him found in the Book Abodazura. Anyway, there are two Jesuses,
or Jesus and the Christ, one of whom is repudiated by Paul.
But Jehoshua, the son of Pandira, can never be converted into Jesus Christ, the son of a virgin mother,
as an historic character. Nor can the dates given ever be reconciled with contemporary history. The
historical Herod, who sought to slay the young child Jesus, is known to have died four years before the
date of the Christian era, assigned for the birth of Jesus.
So much for the historic Jesus. And now for the mythical Christ. Here we can tread on firmer ground.
The mythical Messiah was always born of a Virgin Mother--a factor unknown in natural phenomena, and
one that cannot be historical, one that can only be explained by means of the Mythos, and those
conditions of primitive sociology which are mirrored in mythology and preserved in theology. The virgin
mother has been represented in Egypt by the maiden Queen, Mut-em-ua, the future mother of Amenhept
III some 16 centuries B.C., who impersonated the eternal virgin that produced the eternal child.
Four consecutive scenes reproduced in my book are found portrayed upon the innermost walls of the
Holy of Holies in the Temple of Luxor, which was built by Amenhept III., a Pharaoh of the 17th dynasty.
The first scene on the left hand shows the God Taht, the Lunar Mercury, the Annunciator of the Gods, in
Page 3



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
the act of hailing the Virgin Queen, and announcing to her that she is to give birth to the coming Son. In
the next scene the God Kneph (in conjunction with Hathor) gives the new life. This is the Holy Ghost or
Spirit that causes the Immaculate Conception, Kneph being the spirit by name in Egyptian. The natural
effects are made apparent in the virgin's swelling form.
Next the mother is seated on the mid-wife's stool, and the newborn child is supported in the hands of one
of the nurses. The fourth scene is that of the Adoration. Here the child is enthroned, receiving homage
from the Gods and gifts from men. Behind the deity Kneph, on the right, three spirits--the Three Magi, or
Kings of the Legend, are kneeling and offering presents with their right hand, and life with their left. The
child thus announced, incarnated, born, and worshipped, was the Pharaonic representative of the Aten
Sun in Egypt, the God Adon of Syria, and Hebrew Adonai; the child-Christ of the Aten Cult; the
miraculous conception of the ever-virgin mother, personated by Mut-em-ua, as mother of the "only one,"
and representative of the divine mother of the youthful Sun-God.
These scenes, which were mythical in Egypt, have been copied or reproduced as historical in the
Canonical Gospels, where they stand like four corner-stones to the Historic Structure, and prove that the
foundations are mythical.
Jesus was not only born of the mythical motherhood; his descent on the maternal side is traced in
accordance with this origin of the mythical Christ. The virgin was also called the harlot, because she
represented the pre-monogamic stage of intercourse; and Jesus descends from four forms of the harlot
Thamar, Rahab, Ruth and Bathsheba -- each of whom is a form of the "stranger in Israel," and is not a
Hebrew woman. Such history, however, does not show that illicit intercourse was the natural mode of the
divine descent; nor does it imply unparalleled human profligacy. It only proves the Mythos.
In human sociology the son of the mother preceded the father, as son of the woman who was a mother,
but not a wife. This character is likewise claimed for Jesus, who is made to declare that he was earlier
than Abraham, who was the typical Great Father of the Jews; whether considered to be mythical or
historical. Jesus states emphatically that he existed before Abraham was. This is only possible to the
mythical Christ, who preceded the father as son of the virgin mother; and we shall find it so throughout.
All that is non-natural and impossible as human history, is possible, natural and explicable as Mythos.
It can be explained by the Mythos, because it originated in that which alone accounts for it. For it comes
to this at last: the more hidden the meaning in the Gospel history, the more satisfactorily is it explained by
the Mythos; and the more mystical the Christian doctrine, the more easily can it be proved to be mythical.
The birth of Christ is astronomical. The birthday is determined by the full moon of Easter. This can only
occur once every 19 years, as we have it illustrated by the Epact or Golden Number of the Prayer Book.
Understand me! Jesus, the Christ, can only have a birthday, or resurrection, once in 19 years, in
accordance with the Metonic Cycle, because his parents are the sun and moon; and those appear in the
earliest known representation of the Man upon the Cross! This proves the astronomical and non-human
nature of the birth itself, which is identical with that of the full moon of Easter in Egypt.
Casini, the French Astronomer, has demonstrated the fact that the date assigned for the birth of the
Christ is an Astronomical epoch in which the middle conjunction of the moon with the sun happened on
Page 4



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
the 24th March, at half-past one o'clock in the morning, at the meridian of Jerusalem, the very day of the
middle equinox. The following day (the 25th) was the day of the Incarnation, according to Augustine, but
the date of the Birth, according to Clement Alexander. For two birth days are assigned to Jesus by the
Christian Fathers, one at the Winter Solstice, the other at the Vernal Equinox. These, which cannot both
be historical, are based on the two birthdays of the double Horus in Egypt. Plutarch tells us that Isis was
delivered of Horus, the child, about the time of the winter Solstice, and that the festival of the second or
adult Horus followed the Vernal Equinox. Hence, the Solstice and spring Equinox were both assigned to
the one birth of Jesus by the Christolators; and again, that which is impossible as human history is the
natural fact in relation to the two Horuses, the dual form of the Solar God in Egypt.
And here, in passing, we may point out the astronomical nature of the Crucifixion. The Gospel according
to John brings on a tradition so different from that of the Synoptics as to invalidate the human history of
both. The Synoptics say that Jesus was crucified on the 15th of the month Nisan. John affirms that it was
on the 14th of the month. This serious rift runs through the very foundation! As human history it cannot be
explained. But there is an explanation possible, which, if accepted, proves the Mythos. The Crucifixion
(or Crossing) was, and still is, determined by the full moon of Easter. This, in the lunar reckoning, would
be on the 14th in the month of 28 days; in the solar month of 30 days it was reckoned to occur on the
15th of the month. Both unite, and the rift closes in proving the Crucifixion to have been Astronomical,
just as it was in Egypt, where the two dates can be identified.
Plutarch also tells us how the Mithraic Cult had been particularly established in Rome about the year 70
B.C. And Mithras was fabled as having been born in a cave. Wherever Mithras was worshipped the cave
was consecrated as his birthplace. The cave can be identified, and the birth of the Messiah in that cave,
no matter under what name he was born, can be definitely dated. The "Cave of Mithras" was the
birthplace of the Sun in the Winter Solstice, when this occurred on the 25th of December in the sign of
the Sea-Goat, with the Vernal Equinox in the sign of the Ram. Now the Akkadian name of the tenth
month, that of the Sea-Goat, which answers roughly to our December, the tenth by name, is Abba Uddu,
that is, the "Cave of Light;" the cave of re-birth for the Sun in the lowest depth at the Solstice, figured as
the Cave of Light. This cave was continued as the birthplace of the Christ. You will find it in all the
Gospels of the Infancy, and Justin Martyr says, "Christ was born in the Stable, and afterwards took
refuge in the Cave." He likewise vouches for the fact that Christ was born on the same day that the Sun
was re-born in Stabulo Augiæ, or, in the Stable of Augias. Now the cleansing of this Stable was the sixth
labour of Herakles, his first being in the sign of the Lion; and Justin was right; the Stable and Cave are
both figured in the same Celestial Sign. But mark this! The Cave was the birthplace of the Solar Messiah
from the year 2410 to the year 255 B.C.; at which latter date the Solstice passed out of the Sea-Goat into
the sign of the Archer; and no Messiah, whether called Mithras, Adon, Tammuz, Horus or Christ, could
have been born in the Cave of Abba Uddu or the Stable of Augias on the 25th of December after the year
255 B.C., therefore, Justin had nothing but the Mithraic tradition of the by-gone birthday to prove the birth
of the Historical Christ 255 years later!
In their mysteries the Sarraceni celebrated the Birth of the babe in the Cave or Subterranean Sanctuary,
from which the Priest issued, and cried:--"The Virgin has brought forth: The Light is about to begin to
grow again!"--on the Mother-night of the year. And the Sarraceni were not supporters of Historic
Christianity.
The birthplace of the Egyptian Messiah at the Vernal Equinox was figured in Apt, or Apta, the corner; but
Apta is also the name of the Crib and the Manger; hence the Child born in Apta, was said to be born in a
Page 5



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
manger; and this Apta as Crib or Manger is the hieroglyphic sign of the Solar birthplace. Hence the
Egyptians exhibited the Babe in the Crib or Manger in the streets of Alexandria. The birthplace was
indicated by the colure of the Equinox, as it passed from sign to sign. It was also pointed out by the Star
in the East. When the birthplace was in the sign of the Bull, Orion was the Star that rose in the East to tell
where the young Sun-God was re-born. Hence it is called the "Star of Horus." That was then the Star of
the "Three Kings" who greeted the Babe; for the "Three Kings" is still a name of the three stars in Orion's
Belt. Here we learn that the legend of the "Three Kings" is at least 6,000 years old.
In the course of Precession, about 255 B.C., the vernal birthplace passed into the sign of the Fishes, and
the Messiah who had been represented for 2155 years by the Ram or Lamb, and previously for other
2155 years by the Apis Bull, was now imaged as the Fish, or the "Fish-man," called Ichthys in Greek. The
original Fish-man--the An of Egypt, and the Oan of Chaldea--probably dates from the previous cycle of
precession, or 26,000 years earlier; and about 255 B.C., the Messiah, as the Fish-man, was to come up
once more as the Manifestor from the celestial waters. The coming Messiah is called Dag, the Fish, in
the Talmud; and the Jews at one time connected his coming with some conjunction, or occurrence, in the
sign of the Fishes! This shows the Jews were not only in possession of the astronomical allegory, but
also of the tradition by which it could be interpreted. It was the Mythical and Kronian Messiah alone who
was, or could be, the subject of prophecy that might be fulfilled--prophecy that was fulfilled as it is in the
Book of Revelation--when the Equinox entered, the cross was re-erected, and the foundations of a new
heaven were laid in the sign of the Ram, 2410 B.C.; and, again, when the Equinox entered the sign of the
Fishes, 255 B.C. Prophecy that will be again fulfilled when the Equinox enters the sign of the Waterman
about the end of this century, to which the Samaritans are still looking forward for the coming of their
Messiah, who has not yet arrived for them. The Christians alone ate the oyster; the Jews and Samaritans
only got an equal share of the empty shells! The uninstructed Jews, the idiotai, at one time thought the
prophecy which was astronomical, and solely related to the cycles of time, was to have its fulfilment in
human history. But they found out their error, and bequeathed it unexplained to the still more ignorant
Christians. The same tradition of the Coming One is extant amongst the Millenarians and Adventists, as
amongst the Moslems. It is the tradition of El-Mahdi, the prophet who is to come in the last days of the
world to conquer all the world, and who was lately descending the Soudan with the old announcement
the "Day of the Lord is at hand," which shows that the astronomical allegory has left some relics of the
true tradition among the Arabs, who were at one time learned in astronomical lore.
The Messiah, as the Fish-man, is foreseen by Esdras ascending out of the sea as the "same whom God
the highest hath kept a great season, which by his own self shall deliver the creature." The ancient Fish
man only came up out of the sea to converse with men and teach them in the daytime. "When the sun
set," says Berosus, "it was the custom of this Being to plunge again into the sea, and abide all night in
the deep." So the man foreseen by Esdras is only visible by day.
As it is said, "E'en so can no man upon earth see my son, or those that be with him, but in the daytime."
This is parodied or fulfilled in the account of Ichthys, the Fish, the Christ who instructs men by day, but
retires to the lake of Galilee, where he demonstrates his solar nature by walking the waters at night, or at
the dawn of day.
We are told that his disciples being on board a ship, "when even was come, in the fourth watch of the
night, Jesus went unto them walking upon the sea." Now the fourth watch began at three o'clock, and
ended at six o'clock. Therefore, this was about the proper time for a solar God to appear walking upon
the waters, or coming up out of them as the Oannes. Oannes is said to have taken no food whilst he was
Page 6



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
with men: "In the daytime he used to converse with men, but took no food at that season." So Jesus,
when his disciples prayed him, saying "Master, eat," said unto them, "I have meat to eat that you know
not of. My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me."
This is the perfect likeness of the character of Oannes, who took no food, but whose time was wholly
spent in teaching men. Moreover, the mythical Fish-man is made to identify himself. When the Pharisees
sought a "sign from heaven," Jesus said, "There shall no sign be given but the sign of Jonas. For as
Jonas became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the son of man be to this generation."
The sign of Jonas is that of the Oan, or Fish-man of Nineveh, whether we take it direct from the
monuments, or from the Hebrew history of Jonah, or from the Zodiac.
The voice of the secret wisdom here says truly that those who are looking for signs, can have no other
than that of the returning Fish-man, Ichthys, Oannes, or Jonah: and assuredly, there was no other sign or
date--than those of Ichthys, the Fish who was re-born of the fish-goddess, Atergatis, in the sign of the
Fishes, 255 B.C. After whom the primitive Christians were called little fishes, or Pisciculi.
This date of 255 B.C. was the true day of birth, or rather of re-birth for the celestial Christ, and there was
no valid reason for changing the time of the world.
The Gospels contain a confused and confusing record of early Christian belief: things most truly believed
(Luke) concerning certain mythical matters, which were ignorantly mistaken for human and historical. The
Jesus of our Gospels is but little of a human reality, in spite of all attempts to naturalize the Mythical
Christ, and make the story look rational.
The Christian religion was not founded on a man, but on a divinity; that is, a mythical character. So far
from being derived from the model man, the typical Christ was made up from the features of various
Gods, after a fashion somewhat like those "pictorial averages" portrayed by Mr. Galton, in which the traits
of several persons are photographed and fused in a portrait of a dozen different persons, merged into
one that is not anybody. And as fast as the composite Christ falls to pieces, each feature is claimed, each
character is gathered up by the original owner, as with the grasp of gravitation.
It is not I that deny the divinity of Jesus the Christ; I assert it! He never was, and never could be, any
other than a divinity; that is, a character non-human, and entirely mythical, who had been the pagan
divinity of various pagan myths, that had been pagan during thousands of years before our Era.
Nothing is more certain, according to honest evidence, than that the Christian scheme of redemption is
founded on a fable misinterpreted; that the prophecy of fulfillment was solely astronomical, and the
Coming One as the Christ who came in the end of an age, or of the world, was but a metaphorical figure,
a type of time, from the first, which never could take form in historic personality, any more than Time in
Person could come out of a clock-case when the hour strikes; that no Jesus could become a Nazarene
by being born at, or taken to, Nazareth; and that the history in our Gospels is from beginning to end the
identifiable story of the Sun-God, and the Gnostic Christ who never could be made flesh. When we did
not know the one it was possible to believe the other; but when once we truly know, then the false belief
Page 7



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
is no longer possible.
The mythical Messiah was Horus in the Osirian Mythos; Har-Khuti in the Sut-Typhonian; Khunsu in that
of Amen-Ra; Iu in the cult of Atum-Ra; and the Christ of the Gospels is an amalgam of all these
characters.
The Christ is the Good Shepherd!
So was Horus.
Christ is the Lamb of God!
So was Horus. Christ is the Bread of Life!
So was Horus. Christ is the Truth and the Life!
So was Horus. Christ is the Fan-bearer!
So was Horus. Christ is the Lord!
So was Horus. Christ is the Way and the Door of Life!
Horus was the path by which they travel led out of the Sepulchre. He is the God whose name is written
with the hieroglyphic sign of the Road or Way.
Jesus is he that should come; and Iu, the root of the name in Egyptian, means "to come." Iu-em-hept, as
the Su, the Son of Atum, or of Ptah, was the "Ever-Coming One," who is always pourtrayed as the
marching youngster, in the act and attitude of coming. Horus included both sexes. The Child (or the soul)
is of either sex, and potentially, of both. Hence the hermaphrodital Deity; and Jesus, in Revelation, is the
Young Man who has the female paps.
Iu-em-hept signifies he who comes with peace. This is the character in which Jesus is announced by the
Angels! And when Jesus comes to his disciples after the resurrection it is as the bringer of peace. "Learn
of me and ye shall find rest," says the Christ. Khunsu-Nefer-Hept is the Good Rest, Peace in Person! The
Egyptian Jesus, Iu-em-Hept, was the second Atum; Paul's Jesus is the second Adam. In one rendition of
John's Gospel, instead of the "only-begotten Son of God," a variant reading gives the "only-begotten
God," which has been declared an impossible rendering. But the "only-begotten God" was an especial
type in Egyptian Mythology, and the phrase re-identifies the divinity whose emblem is the beetle. Hor
Apollo says, "To denote the only-begotten or a father, the Egyptians delineate a scarabæus!
By this they symbolize an only-begotten, because the creature is self-produced, being unconceived by a
female." Now the youthful manifestor of the Beetle-God was this Iu-em-hept, the Egyptian Jesus. The
very phraseology of John is common to the Inscriptions, which tell of him who was the Beginner of
Becoming from the first, and who made all things, but who himself was not made. I quote verbatim. And
not only was the Beetle-God continued in the "only-begotten God"; the beetle-type was also brought on
as a symbol of the Christ. Ambrose and Augustine, amongst the Christian Fathers, identified Jesus with,
and as, the "good Scarabæus," which further identifies the Jesus of John's Gospel with the Jesus of
Egypt, who was the Ever-Coming One, and the Bringer of Peace, whom I have elsewhere shown to be
the Jesus to whom the Book of Ecclesiasticus is inscribed, and ascribed in the Apocrypha.
Page 8



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
In accordance with this continuation of the Kamite symbols, it was also maintained by some sectaries
that Jesus was a potter, and not a carpenter; and the fact is that this only-begotten Beetle-God, who is
pourtrayed sitting at the potter's wheel forming the Egg, or shaping the vase-symbol of creation, was the
Potter personified, as well as the only-begotten God in Egypt.
The character and teachings of the Canonical Christ are composed of contradictions which cannot be
harmonised as those of a human being, whereas they are always true to the Mythos.
He is the Prince of Peace, and yet he asserts that he came not to bring peace: "I came not to send
peace, but a sword," and not only is Iu-em-hept the Bringer of Peace by name in one character; he is the
Sword personified in the other. In this he says, "I am the living image of Atum, proceeding from him as a
sword." Both characters belong to the mythical Messiah in the Ritual, who also calls himself the "Great
Disturber," and the "Great Tranquilizer"--the "God Contention," and the "God Peace." The Christ of the
Canonical Gospels has several prototypes, and sometimes the copy is derived or the trait is caught from
one original, and sometimes from the other. The Christ of Luke's Gospel has a character entirely distinct
from that of John's Gospel. Here he is the Great Exorciser, and caster-out of demons. John's Gospel
contains no case of possession or obsession: no certain man who "had devils this long time"; no child
possessed with a devil; no blind and dumb man possessed with a devil.
Other miracles are performed by the Christ of John, but not these; because John's is a different type of
the Christ. And the original of the Great Healer in Luke's Gospel may be found in the God Khunsu, who
was the Divine Healer, the supreme one amongst all the other healers and saviours, especially as the
caster-out of demons, and the expeller of possessing spirits. He is called in the texts the "Great God, the
driver away of possession."
In the Stele of the "Possessed Princess," this God in his effigy is sent for by the chief of Bakhten, that he
may come and cast out a possessing spirit from the king's daughter, who has an evil movement in her
limbs. The demon recognises the divinity just as the devil recognises Jesus, the expeller of evil spirits.
Also the God Khunsu is Lord over the pig--a type of Sut. He is pourtrayed in the disk of the full moon of
Easter, in the act of offering the pig as a sacrifice. Moreover, in the judgment scenes, when the wicked
spirits are condemned and sent back into the abyss, their mode of return to the lake of primordial matter
is by entering the bodies of swine. Says Horus to the Gods, speaking of the condemned one: "When I
sent him to his place he went, and he has been transformed into a black pig." So when the Exorcist in
Luke's Gospel casts out Legion, the devils ask permission of the Lord of the pig to be allowed to enter the
swine, and he gives them leave. This, and much more that might be adduced, tends to differentiate the
Christ of Luke, and to identify him with Khunsu, rather than with Iu-em-hept, the Egyptian Jesus, who is
reproduced in the Gospel according to John. In this way it can be proved that the history of Christ in the
Gospels is one long and complete catalogue of likenesses to the Mythical Messiah, the Solar or Luni
Solar God.
The "Litany of Ra," for example, is addressed to the Sun-God in a variety of characters, many of which
are assigned to the Christ of the Gospels. Ra is the Supreme Power, the Beetle that rests in the
Empyrean, who is born as his own son. This, as already said, is the God in John's Gospel, who says:--"I
and the Father are one," and who is the father born as his own son; for he says, in knowing and seeing
the son, "from henceforth ye know him and have seen him"; i.e., the Father.
Page 9

Ra is designated the "Soul that speaks." Christ is the Word. Ra is the destroyer of venom. Jesus
says:--"In my name they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them."
In one character Ra is the outcast. So Jesus had not where to lay his head.
Ra is the "timid one who sheds tears in the form of the Afflicted." He is called Remi, the Weeper. This
weeping God passes through "Rem-Rem," the place of weeping, and there conquers on behalf of his
followers. In the Ritual the God says:--"I have desolated the place of Rem-Rem." This character is
sustained by Jesus in the mourning over Jerusalem that was to be desolated. The words of John, "Jesus
wept," are like a carven statue of the "Afflicted One," as Remi, the Weeper. Ra is also the God who
"makes the mummy come forth." Jesus makes the mummy come forth in the shape of Lazarus; and in
the Roman Catacombs the risen Lazarus is not only represented as a mummy, but is an Egyptian
mummy which has been eviscerated and swathed for the eternal abode. Ra says to the mummy: "Come
forth!" and Jesus cries: "Lazarus, come forth!" Ra manifests as "the burning one, he who sends
destruction," or "sends his fire into the place of destruction." "He sends fire upon the rebels," his form is
that of the "God of the furnace." Christ also comes in the person of this "burning one"; the sender of
destruction by fire. He is proclaimed by Matthew to be the Baptiser with fire. He says, "I am come to send
fire on the earth."
He is pourtrayed as "God of the furnace," which shall "burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." He is to
cast the rebellious into a "furnace of fire," and send the condemned ones into everlasting fire. All this was
natural when applied to the Solar-God, and it is supposed to become supernatural when misapplied to a
supposed human being to whom it never could apply. The Solar fire was the primary African fount of
theological hell-fire and hell.
The "Litany" of Ra collects the manifold characters that make up the total God (termed Teb-temt), and the
Gospels have gathered up the mythical remains; thus the result is in each case identical, or entirely
similar. From beginning to end the Canonical Gospels contain the Drama of the Mysteries of the Luni
Solar God, narrated as a human history. The scene on the Mount of Transfiguration is obviously derived
from the ascent of Osiris into the Mount of Transfiguration in the Moon. The sixth day was celebrated as
that of the change and transformation of the Solar God in the lunar orb, which he re-entered on that day
as the regenerator of its light. With this we may compare the statement made by Matthew, that "after six
days Jesus went up into a high mountain apart, and he was transfigured, and his face did shine as the
sun (of course!), and his garments became white as the light."
In Egypt the year began soon after the Summer Solstice, when the sun descended from its midsummer
height, lost its force, and lessened in its size. This represented Osiris, who was born of the Virgin Mother
as the child Horus, the diminished infantile sun of Autumn; the suffering, wounded, bleeding Messiah, as
he was represented. He descended into hell, or hades, where he was transformed into the virile Horus,
and rose again as the sun of the resurrection at Easter. In these two characters of Horus on the two
horizons, Osiris furnished the dual type for the Canonical Christ, which shows very satisfactorily HOW the
mythical prescribes the boundaries beyond which the historical does not, dare not, go. The first was the
child Horus, who always remained a child. In Egypt the boy or girl wore the Horus-lock of childhood until
12 years of age. Thus childhood ended about the twelfth year. But although adultship was then entered
upon by the youth, and the transformation of the boy into manhood began, the full adultship was not
attained until 30 years of age. The man of 30 years was the typical adult. The age of adultship was 30
years, as it was in Rome under Lex Pappia. The homme fait is the man whose years are triaded by tens,
and who is Khemt. As with the man, so it is with the God; and the second Horus, the same God in his
Page 10



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
second character, is the Khemt or Khem-Horus, the typical adult of 30 years. The God up to twelve years
was Horus, the child of Isis, the mother's child, the weakling. The virile Horus (the sun in its vernal
strength), the adult of 30 years, was representative of the Fatherhood, and this Horus is the anointed son
of Osiris. These two characters of Horus the child, and Horus the adult of 30 years, are reproduced in the
only two phases of the life of Jesus in the Gospels. John furnishes no historic data for the time when the
Word was incarnated and became flesh; nor for the childhood of Jesus; nor for the transformation into
the Messiah. But Luke tells us that the child of twelve years was the wonderful youth, and that he
increased in wisdom and stature. This is the length of years assigned to Horus the child; and this phase
of the child-Christ's life is followed by the baptism and anointing, the descent of the pubescent spirit with
the consecration of the Messiah in Jordan, when Jesus "began to be about 30 years of age."
The earliest anointing was the consecration of puberty; and here at the full age of the typical adult, the
Christ, who was previously a child, the child of the Virgin Mother, is suddenly made into the Messiah, as
the Lord's anointed. And just as the second Horus was regenerated, and this time begotten of the father,
so in the transformation scene of the baptism in Jordan, the father authenticates the change into full
adultship, with the voice from heaven saying:--"This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased;" the
spirit of pubescence, or the Ruach, being represented by the descending dove, called the spirit of God.
Thus from the time when the child-Christ was about twelve years of age, until that of the typical homme
fait of Egypt, which was the age assigned to Horus when he became the adult God, there is no history.
This is in exact accordance with the Kamite allegory of the double-Horus. And the Mythos alone will
account for the chasm which is wide and deep enough to engulf a supposed history of 18 years.
Childhood cannot be carried beyond the 12th year, and the child-Horus always remained a child; just as
the child-Christ does in Italy, and in German folk-tales. The mythical record founded on nature went no
further, and there the history consequently halts within the prescribed limits, to rebegin with the anointed
and regenerated Christ at the age of Khem-Horus, the adult of 30 years.
And these two characters of Horus necessitated a double form of the mother, who divides into the two
divine sisters, Isis and Nephthys. Jesus also was bi-mater, or dual-mothered; and the two sisters
reappear in the Gospels as the two Marys, both of whom are the mothers of Jesus. This again, which is
impossible as human history, is perfect according to the Mythos that explains it.
As the child-Horus, Osiris comes down to earth; he enters matter, and becomes mortal. He is born like
the Logos, or "as a Word." His father is Seb, the earth, whose consort is Nu, the heaven, one of whose
names is MERI, the Lady of Heaven; and these two are the prototypes of Joseph and Mary. He is said to
cross the earth a substitute, and to suffer vicariously as the Saviour, Redeemer, and Justifier of men. In
these two characters there was constant conflict between Osiris and Typhon, the Evil Power, or Horus
and Sut, the Egyptian Satan. At the Autumn Equinox, the devil of darkness began to dominate; this was
the Egyptian Judas, who betrayed Osiris to his death at the last supper. On the day of the Great Battle at
the Vernal Equinox, Osiris conquered as the ascending God, the Lord of the growing light. Both these
struggles are pourtrayed in the Gospels. In the one Jesus is betrayed to his death by Judas; in the other
he rises superior to Satan. The latter conflict followed immediately after the baptism. In this way:--When
the sun was half-way round, from the Lion sign, it crossed the River of the Waterman, the Egyptian
Iarutana, Hebrew Jordan, Greek Eridanus. In this water the baptism occurred, and the transformation of
the child-Horus into the virile adult, the conqueror of the evil power, took place. Horus becomes hawk
headed, just where the dove ascended and abode on Jesus. Both birds represented the virile soul that
constituted the anointed one at puberty. By this added power Horus vanquished Sut, and Jesus
overcame Satan. Both the baptism and the contest are referred to in the Ritual. "I am washed with the
same water in which the Good Opener (Un-Nefer) washes when he disputes with Satan, that justification
Page 11



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
should be made to Un-Nefer, the Word made Truth," or the Word that is Law.
The scene between the Christ and the Woman at the Well may likewise be found in the Ritual. Here the
woman is the lady with the long hair, that is Nu, the consort of Seb--and the five husbands can be
paralleled by her five star-gods born of Seb. Osiris drinks out of the well "to take away his thirst." He also
says: "I am creating the water. I make way in the valley, in the Pool of the Great One. Make-road (or
road-maker) expresses what I am." "I am the Path by which they traverse out of the sepulchre of Osiris."
So the Messiah reveals himself as the source of living water, "that springeth up unto Everlasting Life."
Later on he says, "I am the way, the truth, the life." "I am creating the water, discriminating the seat," says
Horus. Jesus says, "The hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
worship the Father." Jesus claims that this well of life was given to him by the Father. In the Ritual it says,
"He is thine, O Osiris! A well, or flow, comes out of thy mouth to him!" Also, the paternal source is
acknowledged in another text. "I am the Father, inundating when there is thirst, guarding the water.
Behold me at it." Moreover, in another chapter the well of living water becomes the Pool of Peace. The
speaker says, "The well has come through me. I wash in the Pool of Peace."
In Hebrew, the Pool of Peace is the Pool of Salem, or Siloam. And here, not only is the pool described at
which the Osirified are made pure and healed; not only does the Angel or God descend to the waters-
the "certain times" are actually dated. "The Gods of the pure waters are there on the fourth hour of the
night, and the eighth hour of the day, saying, 'Pass away hence,' to him who has been cured."
An epitome of a considerable portion of John's Gospel may be found in another chapter of the Ritual--"Ye
Gods come to be my servants, I am the son of your Lord. Ye are mine through my Father, who gave you
to me. I have been among the servants of Hathor or Meri. I have been washed by thee, O attendant!"
Compare the washing of Jesus' feet by Marry.
The Osiris exclaims, "I have welcomed the chief spirits in the service of the Lord of things! I am the Lord
of the fields when they are white," i.e., for the reapers and the harvest. So the Christ now says to the
disciples, "Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, that are white already unto the
harvest."
"Then said he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few. Pray ye,
therefore, the Lord of the harvest that he send forth labourers into his harvest. And he called unto him his
twelve disciples." Now, if we turn to the Egyptian "Book of Hades," the harvest, the Lord of the harvest,
and the reapers of the harvest are all portrayed: the twelve are also there. In one scene they are
preceded by a God leaning on a staff, who is designated the Master of Joy--a surname of the Messiah
Horus when assimilated to the Soli-Lunar Khunsu; the twelve are "they who labour at the harvest in the
plains of Neter-Kar." A bearer of a sickle shows the inscription: "These are the Reapers." The twelve are
divided into two groups of five and seven--the original seven of the Aahenru; these seven are the
reapers. The other five are bending towards an enormous ear of corn, the image of the harvest, ripe and
ready for the sickles of the seven. The total twelve are called the "Happy Ones," the bearers of food.
Another title of the twelve is that of the "Just Ones." The God says to the reapers, "Take your sickles!
Reap your grain! Honour to you, reapers." Offerings are made to them on earth, as bearers of sickles in
the fields of Hades. On the other hand, the tares or the wicked are to be cast out and destroyed for ever.

These twelve are the apostles in their Egyptian phase.
In the chapters on "Celestial Diet" in the Ritual, Osiris eats under the sycamore tree of Hathor. He says,
"Let him come from the earth. Thou hast brought these seven loaves for me to live by, bringing the bread
that Horus (the Christ) makes. Thou hast placed, thou hast eaten rations. Let him call to the Gods for
them, or the Gods come with them to him."
This is reproduced as miracle in the Gospels, performed when the multitude were fed upon seven loaves.
The seven loaves are found here, together with the calling upon the Gods, or working the miracle of
multiplying the bread.
In the next chapter there is a scene of eating and drinking. The speaker, who impersonates the Lord,
says:--"I am the Lord of Bread in Annu. My bread at the heaven was that of Ra; my bread on earth was
that of Seb." The seven loaves represent the bread of Ra. Elsewhere the number prescribed to be set on
one table, as an offering, is five loaves. these are also carried on the heads of five different persons in
the scenes of the under-world. Five loaves are the bread of Seb. Thus five loaves represent the bread of
earth, and seven the bread of heaven. Both five and seven are sacred regulation numbers in the
Egyptian Ritual. And in the Gospel of Matthew the miracles are wrought with five loaves in the one case,
and seven in the other, when the multitudes are fed on celestial diet. This will explain the two different
numbers in one and the same Gospel miracle. In the Canonical narrative there is a lad with five barley
loaves and two fishes. In the next chapter of the Ritual we possibly meet with the lad himself, as the
miracle-worker says:--"I have given breath to the said youth."
The Gnostics asserted truly that celestial persons and celestial scenes had been transferred to earth in
our Gospels; and it is only within the Pleroma (the heaven) or in the Zodiac that we can at times identify
the originals of both. And it is there we must look for the "two fishes."
As the latest form of the Manifestor was in the heaven of the twelve signs, that probably determined the
number of twelve basketsful of food remaining when the multitude had all been fed. "They that ate the
loaves were five thousand men;" and five thousand was the exact number of the Celestials or Gods in
the Assyrian Paradise, before the revolt and fall from heaven. The scene of the miracle of the loaves and
fishes is followed by an attempt to take Jesus by force, but he withdraws himself; and this is succeeded
by the miracle of his walking on the waters, and conquering the wind and waves. So is it in the Ritual.
Chap. 57 is that of the breath prevailing over the water in Hades. The speaker, having to cross over,
says: "O Hapi! let the Osiris prevail over the waters, like as the Osiris prevailed against the taking by
stealth, the night of the great struggle." The Solar God was betrayed to his death by the Egyptian Judas,
on the "night of the taking by stealth," which was the night of the last supper. The God is "waylaid by the
conspirators, who have watched very much." They are said to smell him out "by the eating of his bread."
So the Christ is waylaid by Judas, who "knew the place, for Jesus often resorted thither," and by the
Jews who had long watched to take him.
The smelling of Osiris by the eating of his bread is remarkably rendered by John at the eating of the last
supper. The Ritual has it:--"They smell Osiris by the eating of his bread, transporting the evil of Osiris."
"And when he had dipped the sop he gave it to Judas Iscariot, and after the sop Satan entered into him."
Page 13

Then said Jesus to him into whom the evil or devil had been transported, "That thou doest, do quickly."
Osiris was the same, beseeching burial. Here it is demonstrable that the non-historical Herod is a form of
the Apophis Serpent, called the enemy of the Sun. In Syriac, Herod is a red dragon. Herod, in Hebrew,
signifies a terror. Heru (Eg.) is to terrify, and Herrut (Eg.) is the Snake, the typical reptile. The blood of the
divine victim that is poured forth by the Apophis Serpent at the sixth hour, on "the night of smiting the
profane," is literally shed by Herod, as the Herrut or Typhonian Serpent.
The speaker, in the Ritual asks: "Who art thou then, Lord of the Silent Body? I have come to see him who
is in the serpent, eye to eye, and face to face." "Lord of the Silent Body" is a title of the Osiris. "Who art
thou then, Lord of the Silent Body?" is asked and left unanswered. This character is also assigned to the
Christ. The High Priest said unto him, "Answerest thou nothing?" "But Jesus held his peace." Herod
questioned him in many words, but he answered him nothing. He acts the prescribed character of "Lord
of the Silent Body."
The transaction in the sixth hour of the night of the Crucifixion is expressly inexplicable. In the Gospel we
read:--"Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour." The sixth hour
being midnight, that shows the solar nature of the mystery, which has been transferred to the sixth hour
of the day in the Gospel.
It is in the seventh hour the mortal struggle takes place between the Osiris and the deadly Apophis, or
the great serpent, Haber, 450 cubits long, that fills the whole heaven with its vast enveloping folds. The
name of this seventh hour is "that which wounds the serpent Haber." In this conflict with the evil power
thus portrayed the Sun-God is designated the "Conqueror of the Grave," and is said to make his advance
through the influence of Isis, who aids him in repelling the serpent or devil of darkness. In the Gospel,
Christ is likewise set forth in the supreme struggle as "Conqueror of the Grave," for "the graves were
opened, and many bodies of the saints which slept arose;" and Mary represents Isis, the mother, at the
cross. It is said of the great serpent, "There are those on earth who do not drink of the waters of this
serpent, Haber," which may be paralleled with the refusal of the Christ to drink of the vinegar mingled
with gall.
When the God has overcome the Apophis Serpent, his old nightly, annual, and eternal enemy, he
exclaims, "I come! I have made my way! I have come like the sun, through the gate of the one who likes
to deceive and destroy, otherwise called the 'viper.' I have made my way! I have bruised the serpent, I
have passed."
But the more express representation in the mysteries was that of the annual sun as the Elder Horus, or
Atum. As Julius Firmicus says: "In the solemn celebration of the mysteries, all things in order had to be
done which the youth either did or suffered in his death."
Diodorus Siculus rightly identified the "whole fable of the underworld," that was dramatised in Greece, as
having been copied "from the ceremonies of the Egyptian funerals," and so brought on from Egypt into
Greece and Rome. One part of this mystery was the portrayal of the suffering Sun-God in a feminine
phase. When the suffering sun was ailing and ill, he became female, such being a primitive mode of
expression. Luke describes the Lord in the Garden of Gethsemane as being in a great agony, "and his
sweat was, as it were, great drops of blood falling to the ground." This experience the Gnostics identified
Page 14



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
with the suffering of their own hemorrhoidal Sophia, whose passion is the original of that which is
celebrated during Passion week, the "week of weeping in Abtu," and which constitutes the fundamental
mystery of the Rosy Cross, and the Rose of Silence.
In this agony and bloody sweat the Christ simply fulfils the character of Osiris Tesh-Tesh, the red sun, the
Sun-God that suffers his agony and bloody sweat in Smen, whence Gethsmen, or Gethsemane. Tesh
means the bleeding, red, gory, separate, cut, and wounded; tesh-tesh is the inert form of the God whose
suffering, like that of Adonis, was represented as feminine, which alone reaches a natural origin for the
type. He was also called Ans-Ra, or the sun bound up in linen.
So natural were the primitive mysteries!
My attention has just been called to a passage in Lycophron, who lived under Ptolemy Philadelphus
between 310 and 246 B.C. In this Heracles is referred to as
"That three-nighted lion, whom of old
Triton's fierce dog with furious jaw devoured,
Within whose bowels, tearing of his liver,
He rolled, burning with heat, though without fire,
His head with drops of sweat bedewed all o'er."
This describes the God suffering his agony and sweat, which is called the "bloody flux" of Osiris. Here the
nights are three in number. So the Son of Man was to be three nights as well as three days in the "heart
of the earth." In the Gospels this prophecy is not fulfilled; but if we include the night of the bloody sweat,
we have the necessary three nights, and the Mythos becomes perfect. In this phase the suffering Sun
was the Red Sun, whence the typical Red Lion.
As Atum, the red sun is described as setting from the Land of Life in all the colours of crimson, or Pant,
the red pool. This clothing of colours is represented as a "gorgeous robe" by Luke; a purple robe by
Mark; and a robe of scarlet by Matthew. As he goes down at the Autumn Equinox, he is the crucified. His
mother, Nu, or Meri, the heaven, seeing her son, the Lord of Terror, greatest of the terrible, setting from
the Land of Life, with his hands drooping, she becomes obscure, and there is great darkness over all the
land, as at the crucifixion described by Matthew, in which the passing of the Lord of Terror is rendered by
the terrible or "loud cry" of the Synoptic version. The Sun-God causes the dead, or those in the earth, to
live as he passes down into the under-world, because, as he entered the earth, the tombs were opened,
i.e., figuratively. But it is reproduced literally by Matthew.
The death of Osiris, in the Ritual, is followed by the "Night of the Mystery of the Great Shapes," and it is
explained that the night of the Great Shapes is when there has been made the embalming of the body of
Osiris, "the Good Being, justified for ever." In the chapter on "the night of the laying-out" of the dead body
of Osiris, it is said that "Isis rises on the night of the laying-out of the dead body, to lament over her
brother Osiris." And again: "The night of the laying-out" (of the dead Osiris) is mentioned, and again it is
described as that on which Isis had risen "to make a wail for her brother."
Page 15



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
But this is also the night on which he conquers his enemies, and "receives the birthplace of the Gods."
"He tramples on the bandages they make for their burial. He raises his soul, and conceals his body." So
the Christ is found to have unwound the linen bandages of burial, and they saw the linen in one place,
and the napkin in another. He too conceals his body!
This is closely reproduced, or paralleled, in John's Gospel, where it is Mary Magdalene who rises in the
night and comes to the sepulchre, "while it was yet dark," to find the Christ arisen, as the conqueror of
death and the grave. In John's version, after the body is embalmed in a hundred pounds weight of spice,
consisting of myrrh and aloes, we have the "night of the mystery of the shapes": "For while it was yet
dark, Mary Magdalene coming to the sepulchre, and peering in, sees the two angels in white sitting, the
one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body had lately lain." And in the chapter of "How a
living being is not destroyed in hell, or the hour of life ends not in Hades," there are two youthful
Gods--"two youths of light, who prevail as those who see the light," and the vignette shows the deceased
walking off. He has risen!
Matthew has only one angel or splendid presence, whose appearance was as lightning, which agrees
with Shepi, the Splendid One, who "lights the sarcophagus," as a representative of the divinity, Ra. The
risen Christ, who is first seen and recognised by Mary, says to her, "Touch me not, for I am not yet
ascended to my Father." The same scene is described by the Gnostics: when Sophia rushes forward to
embrace the Christ, who restrains her by exclaiming that he must not be touched.
In the last chapter of the "Preservation of the Body in Hades," there is much mystical matter that looks
plainer when written out in John's Gospel. It is said of the regerminated or risen God--"May the Osirian
speak to thee?" The Osirian does not know. He (Osiris) knows him. "Let him not grasp him." The Osirified
"comes out sound, Immortal is his name." "He has passed along the upper roads" (that is, as a risen
spirit).
"He it is who grasps with his hand," and gives the palpable proof of continued personality, as does the
Christ, who says, "See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself."
The Sun-God re-arises on the horizon, where he issues forth, "saying to those who belong to his race,
Give me your arm." Says the Osirified deceased, "I am made as ye are." "Let him explain it!" At his
reappearance the Christ demonstrates that he is made as they are; "See my hands and feet, that it is I
myself; handle me and see. And when he had said this he showed them his hands and feet. Then he
said to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands, and reach hither thy hand and put it into my
side." These descriptions correspond to that of the cut, wounded, and bleeding Sun-God, who says to his
companions, "Give me your arm; I am made as ye are."
In the Gospel of the Hebrews he is made to exclaim, "For I am not a bodiless ghost." But in the original,
when the risen one says to his companions, "Give me your arm, I am made as ye are," he speaks as a
spirit to spirits. Whereas in the Gospels, the Christ has to demonstrate that he is not a spirit, because the
scene has been transferred into the earth-life.
The Gnostics truly declared that all the supernatural transactions asserted in the Christian Gospel "were
counterparts (or representations) of what took place above." That is, they affirmed the history to be
Page 16



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
mythical; the celestial allegory made mundane; and they were in the right, as the Egyptian Gospel
proves. There are Healers, and Jehoshua Ben-Pandira may have been one. But, because that is
possible, we must not allow it to vouch for the impossible! Thus, in the Gospels, the mythical is, and has
to be, continually reproduced as miracle. That which naturally pertains to the character of the Sun-God
becomes supernatural in appearance when brought down to earth. The Solar God descended into the
nether world as the restorer of the bound to liberty, the dead to life. In this region the miracles were
wrought, and the transformations took place. The evil spirits and destroying powers were exorcised from
the mummies; the halt and the maimed were enabled to get up and go; the dead were raised, a mouth
was given to the dumb, and the blind were made to see.
This "reconstitution of the deceased" is transferred to the earth-life, whereupon "the blind receive their
sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up" at the
coming of the Christ, who performed the miracles. The drama, which the Idiotai mistook for human
history, was performed by the Sun-God in another world.
I could keep on all day, and all night, or give a dozen lectures, without exhausting my evidence that the
Canonical Gospels are only a later literalised réchauffé of the Egyptian writings; the representations in
the Mysteries, and the oral teachings of the Gnostics which passed out of Egypt into Greece and Rome-
for there is plenty more proof where this comes from. I can but offer a specimen brick of that which is
elsewhere a building set four-square, and sound against every blast that blows.
The Christian dispensation is believed to have been ushered in by the birth of a child, and the portrait of
that child in the Roman Catacombs as the child of Mary is the youthful Sun-God in the Mummy Image of
the child-king, the Egyptian Karast, or Christ. The alleged facts of our Lord's life as Jesus the Christ, were
equally the alleged facts of our Lord's life as the Horus of Egypt, whose very name signifies the Lord.
The Christian legends were first related of Horus the Messiah, the Solar Hero, the greatest hero that ever
lived in the mind of man--not in the flesh--the only hero to whom the miracles were natural, because he
was not human.
From beginning to end the history is not human but divine, and the divine is the mythical. From the
descent of the Holy Ghost to overshadow Mary, to the ascension of the risen Christ at the end of forty
days, according to the drama of the pre-Christian Mysteries, the subject-matter, the characters,
occurrences, events, acts, and sayings bear the impress of the mythical mould instead of the stamp of
human history. Right through, the ideas which shape the history were pre-extant, and are identifiably pre
Christian; and so we see the strange sight to-day in Europe of 100,000,000 of Pagans masquerading as
Christians.
Whether you believe it or not does not matter, the fatal fact remains that every trait and feature which go
to make up the Christ as Divinity, and every event or circumstance taken to establish the human
personality were pre-extant, and pre-applied to the Egyptian and Gnostic Christ, who never could
become flesh. The Jesus Christ with female paps, who is the Alpha and Omega of Revelation, was the IU
of Egypt, and the Iao of the Chaldeans. Jesus as the Lamb of God, and Ichthys the Fish, was Egyptian.

Jesus whose symbol in the Catacombs is the eight-rayed Star--the Star of the East; Jesus as the eternal
Child; Jesus as God the Father, re-born as his own Son; Jesus as the Child of twelve years; Jesus as the
Anointed One of thirty years; Jesus in his Baptism; Jesus walking on the Waters, or working his Miracles;
Jesus as the Caster-out of demons; Jesus as a Substitute, who suffered in a vicarious atonement for
sinful men; Jesus whose followers are the two brethren, the four fishers, the seven fishers, the twelve
apostles, the seventy (or seventy-two in some texts) whose names were written in Heaven; Jesus who
was administered to by seven women; Jesus in his bloody sweat; Jesus betrayed by Judas; Jesus as
conqueror of the grave; Jesus the Resurrection and the Life; Jesus before Herod; in the Hades, and in
his re-appearance to the women, and to the seven fishers; Jesus who was crucified both on the 14th and
15th of the month Nisan; Jesus who was also crucified in Egypt (as it is written in Revelation); Jesus as
judge of the dead, with the sheep on the right hand, and the goats on the left, is Egyptian from first to
last, in every phase, from the beginning to the end-
MAKE WHATSOEVER YOU CAN OF JEHOSHUA BEN-PANDIRA.
In some of the ancient Egyptian Temples the Christian iconoclasts, when tired of hacking and hewing at
the symbolic figures incised in the chambers of imagery, and defacing the most prominent features of the
monuments, found they could not dig out the hieroglyphics and took to covering them over with plaster or
tempera; and this plaster, intended to hide the meaning and stop the mouth of the stone Word, has
served to preserve the ancient writings, as fresh in hue and sharp in outline as when they were first cut
and coloured.
In a similar manner the Temple of the ancient religion was invaded, and possession gradually gained by
connivance of Roman power; and that enduring fortress, not built, but quarried out of the solid rock, was
stuccoed all over the front, and made white awhile with its look of brand-newness, and re-opened under
the sign of another name--that of the carnalised Christ. And all the time each nook and corner were
darkly alive with the presence and the proofs of the earlier gods, and the pre-Christian origins, even
though the hieroglyphics remained unread until the time of Champollion! But stucco is not for lasting
wear, it cracks and crumbles; sloughs off and slinks away into its natal insignificance; the rock is the sole
true foundation; the rock is the only record in which we can reach reality at last!
Wilkinson, the Egyptologist, has actually said of Osiris on earth:--"Some may be disposed to think that
the Egyptians, being aware of the promises of the real saviour, had anticipated that event, regarding it as
though it had already happened, and introduced that mystery into their religious system!" This is what
obstetrists term a false presentation; a birth feet-foremost. We are also told by writers on the Catacombs,
and the Christian Iconography, that this figure is Osiris, as a type of Christ. This is Pan, Apollo, Aristeus,
as a type of Christ. This is Harpocrates, as a type of Christ. This is Mercury, but as a type of Christ; this is
the devil (for Sut-Mercury was the devil), as a type of Christ; until long hearing of the facts reversed,
perverted and falsified, makes one feel as if under a nightmare which has lasted for eighteen centuries,
knowing the Truth to have been buried alive and made dumb all that time; and believing that it has only to
get voice and make itself heard to end the lying once for all, and bring down the curtain of oblivion at last
upon the most pitiful drama of delusion ever witnessed on the human stage.
And here the worst foes of the truth have ever been, and still are, the rationalisers of the Mythos, such as
the Unitarians. They have assumed the human history as the starting point, and accepted the existence
Page 18



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
of a personal founder of Christianity as the one initial and fundamental fact. They have done their best to
humanise the divinity of the Mythos, by discharging the supernatural and miraculous element, in order
that the narrative might be accepted as history. Thus they have lost the battle from the beginning, by
fighting it on the wrong ground.
The Christ is a popular lay-figure that never lived, and a lay-figure of Pagan origin; a lay-figure that was
once the Ram, and afterwards the Fish; a lay-figure that in human form was the portrait and image of a
dozen different gods. The imagery of the Catacombs shows that the types there represented are not the
ideal figures of the human reality! They are the sole reality for six or seven centuries after A.D., because
they had been so in the centuries long before. There is no man upon the cross in the Catacombs of
Rome for seven hundred years! The symbolism, the allegories, the figures, and types, brought on by the
Gnostics, remained there just what they had been to the Romans, Greeks, Persians, and Egyptians. Yet,
the dummy ideal of Paganism is supposed to have become doubly real as the God who was made flesh,
to save mankind from the impossible "fall!" Remember that the primary foundation-stone for a history in
the New Testament is dependent upon the Fall of Man being a fact in the Old; whereas it was only a
fable, which had its own mythical and unhistorical meaning.
When we try over again that first step once taken in the dark, we find no foothold for us, because there
was no stair. The Fall is absolutely non-historical, and, consequently, the first bit of standing-ground for
an actual Christ, the redeemer, is missing in the very beginning. Any one who set up, or was set up, for
an historical Saviour from a non-historical Fall, could only be an historical impostor. But the Christ of the
Gospels is not even that! He is in no sense an historical personage. It is impossible to establish the
existence of an historical character, even as an impostor. For such an one the two witnesses-
Astronomical Mythology and Gnosticism--completely prove an alibi for ever! From the first supposed
catastrophe to the final one, the figures of the celestial allegory were ignorantly mistaken for matters of
fact, and thus the orthodox Christolator is left at last to climb to heaven with one foot resting on the
ground of a redemption that must be fallacious. It is a fraud founded on a fable!
Every time the Christian turns to the East to bow his obeisance to the Christ, it is a confession that the
cult is Solar, the admission being all the more fatal because it is unconscious. Every picture of the Christ,
with the halo of glory, and the accompanying Cross of the Equinox, proffers proof.
The Christian doctrine of a resurrection furnishes evidence, absolutely conclusive, of the Astronomical
and Kronian nature of the origins! This is to occur, as it always did, at the end of a cycle; or at the end of
the world! Christian Revelation knows nothing of immortality, except in the form of periodic renewal,
dependent on the "Coming One;" and the resurrection of the dead still depends on the day of judgment
and the last day, at the end of the world! They have no other world. Their only other world is at the end of
this.
Now there are no fools living who would be fools big enough to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a barque so
rotten and unseaworthy as this in which they hope to cross the dark River of Death, and, on a pier of
cloud, be landed safe in Heaven. The Christian Theology was responsible for substituting faith instead of
knowledge; and the European mind is only just beginning to recover from the mental paralysis induced
by that doctrine which came to its natural culmination in the Dark Ages.

The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
The Christian religion is responsible for enthroning the cross of death in heaven, with a deity on it, doing
public penance for a private failure in the commencement of creation. It has taught men to believe that
the vilest spirit may be washed white, in the atoning blood of the purest, offered up as a bribe to an
avenging God. It has divinized a figure of helpless human suffering, and a face of pitiful pain; as if there
were naught but a great heartache at the core of all things; or the vast Infinite were but a veiled and sad
eyed sorrow that brings visibly to birth in the miseries of human life. But "in the old Pagan world men
deified the beautiful, the glad;" as they will again, upon a loftier pedestal, when the fable of this fictitious
fall of man, and false redemption by the cloud-begotten God, has passed away like a phantasm of the
night, and men awake to learn that they are here to wage ceaseless war upon sordid suffering,
remediable wrong, and preventable pain; here to put an end to them, not to apotheosize an effigy of
Sorrow to be adored as a type of the Eternal. For the most beneficent is the most beautiful; the happiest
are the healthiest; the most God-like is most glad. The Christian Cult has fanatically fought for its false
theory, and waged incessant warfare against Nature and Evolution--Nature's intention made somewhat
visible--and against some of the noblest instincts, during eighteen centuries. Seas of human blood have
been spilt to keep the barque of Peter afloat. Earth has been honeycombed with the graves of the
martyrs of Free thought. Heaven has been filled with a horror of great darkness in the name of God.
Eighteen centuries are a long while in the life-time of a lie, but a brief span in the eternity of Truth. The
Fiction is sure to be found out, and the Lie will fall at last! At last! At last!!!
No matter though it towers to the sky,
And darkens earth, you cannot make the lie
Immortal; though stupendously enshrined
By art in every perfect mould of mind:
Angelo, Rafael, Milton, Handel, all
Its pillars, cannot stay it from the fall.
The Pyramid of Imposture reared by Rome,
All of cement, for an eternal home,
Must crumble back to earth, and every gust
Shall revel in the desert of its dust;
And when the prison of the Immortal, Mind,
Hath fallen to set free the bound and blind,
No more shall life be one long dread of death;
Humanity shall breathe with ampler breath,
Expand in spirit, and in stature rise,
To match its birthplace of the earth and skies.

The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
A RETORT
I am sorry to trouble my readers with a matter so personal as the present subject. It has been found out
that I am not infallible. Like my fellow-mortals, I can fall into error. I have to acknowledge and regret a
stupid blunder, perceived, alas! too late (p. 15 of the Historical Jesus and Mythical Christ; also p. 419,
Vol. II., "Natural Genesis").
In comparing with Egyptian certain Syro-Chaldaic and Aramean words which have been left untranslated
in the Greek text of the New Testament, I included the word "sent," entirely forgetting that it was English
when I compared it with the Egyptian "shent," a "pool," and "sunnt," a healing bath. The nature of my
inadvertence is proved in the very next lines by the remark:--"There is no need to strain a single point for
the purpose of making ends meet!"
It was foolish, but such is the simple fact, and I will not seek to minimise my mistake. Any one engaged in
attacking what he considers the supreme delusion of the European mind, and the crowning error of all
time, ought to be free from the smallest errors himself. Would that it were possible! For the most is sure
to be made by the enemy of the least lapse, more especially by those who have been consecrated to the
service of falsification.
My error drew the attention of a Mr. Coleman, and induced him to write an article in the Religio
Philosophical Journal of Chicago last October, of which no copy was sent to me by the writer or
publisher. To this my attention has just been called; also to a letter by the same writer which appeared in
the same journal, dated February 5th, headed "Opinions of Eminent Egyptologists regarding Mr.
Massey's alleged Egypto-Christian parallels." Unfortunately, the letter will necessitate a reply to the
previous article. In this letter the Rev. A. H. Sayce is reported to say of me to Mr. Coleman, "Many thanks
for your very thorough demolition of Mr. Massey's crudities. It is difficult to understand how a man can
have the effrontery to put forward such a mass of ignorance and false quotation. You have done a real
service to the cause of truth by exposing him so fully. You ask me if I can detect any errors in your essay.
Errors enough on the part of Mr. Massey, but they have all been exposed impartially and mercilessly by
yourself."
Mr. Coleman continues, and quotes the following from "one of the ablest Egyptologists in England," who
is "now connected with the British Museum," of whom he says, "owing to the rather personal character of
some of his remarks, it is thought better that his name be not published." The writer says to Mr.
Coleman,--"You are right in your exposure of Mr. Massey. Some people think him dishonest; and that he
is quite conscious of the ridiculous blunders which he publishes. I do not think so after having examined
his large book. It is a work which I should have thought could only have been written in Bedlam. No
lunatic could possibly write more wild rubbish, without the least consciousness of the incredible
ignorance displayed throughout. The man is AT ONCE an ignoramus of the worst kind, viz., not in the
least being aware of his ignorance, and he has the pretension of explaining things which cannot be
understood (except by trusting other persons) without a considerable knowledge of different languages,
which he does not possess." If the words here used have any real relationship to known facts, it seemed
to me that the Egyptologist who has taken the place of the late Dr. Samuel Birch must be the writer of the
letter quoted by Mr. Coleman. I wrote to Mr. Renouf stating my inference, and asking him to favour me
with a denial if he were not the writer. This is Mr. Renouf's reply. The underlining is mine:-
Page 21



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
"Sir,-- You are mistaken in thinking that the extract from Mr. Coleman's letter 'points undoubtedly' to me.
There are more persons than one at the Museum besides me, to whom it might be supposed to 'point.'
But whatever indiscretion there may have been till now in this matter, I am not disposed to add to it by
answering any questions as to my knowledge of the authorship of the letter to which you refer.--I am, Sir,
your obedient servant, P. LE PAGE RENOUF."
That answer I look upon as eminently unsatisfactory; and I think my view will be shared by others. Only
one person wrote the letter; and this explanation brings at least three under suspicion, without identifying
or absolving the right one. If Mr. Renouf be the writer, instead of clearing himself he has imitated the ink
fish and taken refuge in the cloud which he has cast around his confréres at the Museum. I cannot think
the reply is calculated to deceive! It contains no denial, however, and perhaps the discretion shown too
late may not prove to be the better part of valour; but I leave blank for the time being where I have not the
absolute right to fill in a name.
We have heard the language like this of Mr. --- before (put in better English), when anything very
upsetting has been presented to the world. Such damnation is dirt cheap! Also, the time has passed for
denunciation to be mistaken for disproof. That is the kind of authority I had already counted on, and
discounted, when I say, "They must find it hard to take Truth for authority who have so long mistaken
Authority for Truth."
By the by I may confess to Mr. --- that I escaped from Bedlam many years ago; I would also remind him
that the proper name for Bedlam is Bethlehem; a most ancient mad-house in which the patients have
been confined for eighteen hundred years; and that our Bedlam also was once a "religious house." I am
not mad myself; but I am possessed by the conviction that a good many other people are, and that no
insanity is quite so virulent as that which dates from the ancient Bedlam. I had already warned my
readers that they must expect little help from those Egyptologists and Assyriologists who are bibliolators
first and scholars afterwards. Bibliolatry puts out the eye of scholarship or causes confirmed strabismus.
I admit in the preface to my "Natural Genesis" that "as a matter of course the author will have blundered
in manifold details." At the end of three years I doubt whether I have! But of course in a work of so
fundamental and pioneering a nature there will be some oversights, crudities and even graver faults that
cannot be avoided in a first edition. Why, 30,000 errors have had to be corrected in the latest edition of
the "Word of God." And it does seem at times to be a providential part of the scheme of things that where
the truths entirely fail to command attention first, the errors are sure to secure some sort of
advertisement for the work. In this way, even a Coleman can be turned to account.
Madness may be a matter of opinion; but whoever charges me with intended "false quotation" lies!
I spared no time to get at my facts, and neglected no available sources of knowledge, whether directly
open to myself or derivable through the minds of those who are great linguists. As I also say in my
preface I took the precaution of consulting Dr. Samuel Birch for many years after he had offered, in his
own words, to "keep me straight" as to my facts, obtainable from Egyptian records. He answered my
questions, gave me his advice, discussed variant renderings, read whatever proofs I sent him, and
corrected me where he saw I was wrong. I never could understand the interest he took in me and my
work. He could have had no sympathy with my real aim and ends (which are not wholly proclaimed even
Page 22



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
on my title-page), yet he was always ready to enrich my poor means with the treasures of his knowledge,
so precious for my purpose; whether by letter or in person, whenever I sought him out amongst the
Mummies and
"In a corner found the toys,
Of the old Egyptian boys,"
or got my verification direct from the monuments, including the hieroglyphic texts and pictures in his own
copy of the Book of the Dead.
And now for Mr. Coleman.
He has been trying to discredit my work for over three years past. His assumption of superiority is
immense, and might prove imposing if his methods of attack were not so verminously mean. His latest
labour-in-vain has been to try and rear a pyramid on its apex--the sole point of a single fact--which can
be sent toppling over with a single kick. Where it suits his purpose he uses an imperfect report of a
Lecture so that he may convict me of errors which are not to be found in the Book that he seeks to
discredit, and industriously essays to damn.
In the article referred to he says: "In recent numbers of the London Medium and Daybreak there has
appeared Mr. Gerald Massey's lecture on 'The Historical Jesus and the Mythical Christ,' as revised and
corrected by the author, and as delivered by him in London not long since. In this lecture, which attempts
to establish that the Jesus and the Disciples of the New Testament had no existence in the flesh, but
were only personifications of Egyptian myths, we find a large number of asserted parallels between the
life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth and certain portions of the Osirian and other myths of Egypt."
The opening paragraph contains two positive, provable, falsehoods. The version of my lecture made use
of by him was a reprint from an imperfect report in the New Zealand "Rationalist," which was not revised
by the author. If it had been he could only have assumed to know what he asserted without knowing. But
it is not true! It is also false that in this lecture, or in my book, I try to "establish that Jesus and the
disciples of the New Testament had no existence in the flesh, but were only personifications of ancient
Egyptian myths"--whatever that may mean!
On the contrary, I demonstrate the existence of the only possible historic Jesus known to Celsus, to
Irenæus, to the Jews, who allow that he had twelve disciples, whom they call the "twelve god ess
runagates."
What I do also demonstrate is that the mythical twelve were the followers of Har-Khuti in Egypt ages
earlier.
This is a prime specimen of his mode of working, and one it is well to keep in mind all along. This is the
mode of demolition which Professor Sayce endorses, warrants, glorifies; and Mr. --- declares to be "quite
Page 23



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
right."
Again, I have used the Hebrew word ,vlw (Natural Genesis ii. 419), on which our learned Hebraist
remarks, "This asserted Hebrew word Shiloam is a fabrication. There is no such Hebrew word in
existence as Shiloam--in unpointed Hebrew Sh, L, O, M"!! "To identify Salem, or Shalem, with Siloam in
Hebrew, the letter 'm' was required. There being no 'm' in the correct word, Shiloach, Mr. Massey
manufactured a Hebrew word and printed it in Hebrew letters, as if to deceive the very elect."
Now, look at that for a lie! with no room left for the least little wriggle out of it!
As Mr. Coleman obviously knows nothing of Hebrew beyond the names of letters, perhaps Mr. Sayce, or
Mr. --- will look it out for him in Fuerst, at page 1388, Col. 2, where the word appears with the meaning of
"well" in health; and on page 1376, Col. 1, where it means Peace. It is used for the Prince of peace (Is.
ix. 6). And Fuerst further says "Shiloah is cognate with ,vlw (Shlom). It is quite impossible that Mr. Sayce
should not have known this at the time he gave his sanction to Mr. Coleman's falsehoods and
consummate effrontery; and it was cruel not to arrest him as he was careering round in this wild way
instead of tickling the poor creature's vanity with insincere applause.
The lie and libel were so unnecessary that I am compelled to regret the wanton waste of pure malignity.
When I say the "Pool of Peace" is Salem, or Shloam in Hebrew, I do not say that it is the Pool of Siloam;
and am only rendering the word "Peace." And as Shloam means "peace" and salem means peace, I
used the alternative of "salem or shloam." I knew the two words were spelt differently, and that Shloam
may be pointed Shaloam; I also knew that they were identical in meaning. Moreover, the Pool of the
waters that flow softly is a form of the Pool of peace. Not that either of these was involved or at all
necessary to my argument. When I say "THE Pool of Peace" is in Hebrew Salem or Shloam, I am
speaking of THE mythical pool which in Egyptian is the Pool of Hept or Peace, not the topographical pool
of Siloam. I was only concerned with the identity of THE mythical original which had various localisations
in different lands, Judea included.
Mr. Coleman runs a long rigmarole about the goddess "Nu" and the place "Annu," in which he flounders
in the bottomless bog of his own helpless ignorance, past all pulling out by those who have taken him by
the hand--viz., Messrs. Sayce and --- .
He who enters this domain so unprepared and unequipped as Mr. Coleman, must be a fore-damned fool.
I could have pitied his impotency but for his ineffable conceit and aggressive insolence.
Because I use the words "An" and "Annu" as synonyms, this great Egyptologist asserts that I identify the
Lady of "An" with the goddess "Nu" to form the word Annu. As the monkey exclaimed when he saw the
elephant taking in water at such a rate, "To drink with the tail is immense!" An and Annu are simply
Egyptian variants of one word; different spellings of the same word were the result of familiarity with
matters upon which my corrector is so utterly ignorant that he looks upon and denounces the variants in
Egyptian spelling as my distortion of Egyptian names, and sapiently suggests that "there always appears
to be an object" in my changes! He thinks the "Lady with the long hair" is Tefnut, and not the goddess Nu
as I had inferred, partly because the Ritual says "The hair of the Osiris is in the shape of that of Nu" (Ch.
xlii.), and partly because the Osiris ascends the heaven, or Nu, with his long hair down to his shoulders.
Page 24



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
Either way it matters very little.
What I do regret is that I could not have had the advantage of knowing what Mr. Coleman thinks about
Egyptian mythology before writing my book. The opinion of such an expert on the most profoundly
allusive and problematical Sayings might have seriously modified the result. He further charges me with
having got certain goddesses mixed up; it being his mission to teach me how to separate them once
more and distinguish between them individually. Here he tries to turn his ignorance to account by taking
advantage of the reader's and producing the impression that the ignorance is mine. He throws dust in the
eyes of others and then says it was I who did it. And Mr. Sayce, in a cloud of it, swears it to me!
I may admit that this parallel of the Woman at the Well, which is but one out of fifty, is the weakest one.
But it is enough for my purpose to show that the Osiris or Osirified (these being identical in character)
appears at the Well or Pool of Peace; that he claims to be the Well and personates the Water; that the
source of this water of life given to the Son is the Father; that a well or flow of this water comes out of
Osiris to him; that the well of this water comes through him (Cf. John vii. 38, and iv. 14.); that he washes
in the "pool of Peace," where the Osirified are made pure or healed: where the "certain times," as I have
called them (because the seasons for healing are dual in the Ritual) are detailed thus--"The Gods of the
pure waters are there on the fourth hour of the night and the eighth hour of the day," saying, "pass away
hence" to him who has been cured or healed.
Here it is noticeable that in the still-continued process of eliminating that which looks too mythical, this
passage containing the angel descending to trouble the waters and turn them into a Pool of healing has
been dropped from the latest revised version of John's Gospel.
In converting the original mythos into later history, this process of picking the owner's name or sign from
stolen goods has gone on from the first, and is not yet ended!
I do not say or suppose anything so simple as that the writer of John's Gospel was copying from some
"variant and obscure chapter in an ancient Egyptian papyrus." That is Mr. Coleman's foolish way of
putting it. That was not exactly the way in which the Osirian legend got literalized in Rome. If it had been
preserved and continued as mythos, it could not have re-appeared under the guise of historic
Christianity.
The matter had to be manipulated, converted, assimilated, in which process the original features have
been somewhat defaced. This has to be allowed for in judging of my parallels, comparisons, and
interpretations.
There must of necessity be a wide gulf between any one who accepts the Gospel history as pure matter
of fact, and one who treats it as mainly mythical. The two can only talk to different classes of minds
separated for the time being by that gulf, across which they can hardly hear each other speak.
But perhaps the most perfect of all my critic's manifold errors and monstrous blunders is this.
Page 25



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
He writes a long essay in six columns to defend a passage in the Johannine Gospel against my mythical
interpretation, with the intention of demonstrating the "stupendous display of ignorance and absurdity"
which he finds in my volumes. He fights tooth and nail on behalf of the historical interpretation against the
mythical. His one line of argument, his raison d'être all through, is that the events under review, the
woman at the well, the Christ who drinks there, and other circumstances, are historical! And yet in the
opening paragraph of his article he had started with saying--"It is significant that most of these so called
New Testament parallels are derived from the fourth Gospel, popularly ascribed to John. Every
competent biblicist knows that the account of Jesus and his teachings given in John's Gospel differs
widely from those given in the first three Gospels; and there is no reasonable doubt, in the light of
historico-critical biblical science, that, while large portions of the latter are genuinely historical, the
Gospel of John, as a whole, is UNHISTORICAL, MYTHICAL."
Good God! the man is here throwing away the child with the water it was washed in! If this be so, and, as
I demonstrate, the mythical gospel was first, no matter how late it appeared in the canonical gospel
ascribed to John, the supposed history of the Synoptics goes to the ground! Where is the sanity in
supposing that the Mythical matter of John's Gospel is the result of tattooing Egyptian fables all over the
face of historic fact (as previously pourtrayed by the Synoptics), and disfiguring the human features past
all recognition? The Christ of John is indefinitely divine, and that is first: the final phase looks definitely
historic. That is how the Mythology was humanised. The Myth-Makers were Fabulists, but not the forgers
of facts; the forgers are they who converted the fable into historic fact. Mr. Coleman says only just what I
say and show on behalf of the Mythos. But what then was the sense, or where was the sanity in
labouring to prove it to be historic bit by bit, when, as a whole, it is entirely unhistorical and mythical?
Yet Messrs. Sayce and --- assure Mr. Coleman, with their compliments, that he is right.
I fancy some of my readers will suspect that he is not--quite.
And this is what it is to be demolished! This is doing a "real service to the cause of truth." So says the
Rev. Mr. Sayce, and he is an authority.
Mr. Coleman charges me with limiting my quotations from the Egyptian Ritual to Dr. Birch's version of the
"very corrupt Turin Text," as if he were an authority respecting the Texts!--and then of misquoting the
Texts to establish my parallel. Whereas my slight departures from the Text (in Bunsen) are the result of
various emendations or corrections made by the Egyptologists, such as Renouf, including Dr. Birch
himself, to whom I took them for his final opinion, and with whom I have gone over Text after Text for that
purpose. I neglected no available source of knowledge, early or late. Also in regarding, condensing, and
connecting certain passages, I wrote with the whole matter of the Mythos in mind, and had the Ritual
well-nigh by heart; which is to be at an enormous disadvantage when judged by Mr. Coleman.
In denouncing the "corrupt Turin Text" he is merely "monkeying round," by quoting the words of Mr.
Renouf (Hibbert Lectures, p. 177). He consistently omits the rest of the sentence. Mr. Renouf, like M.
Naville, is an expert in Textual and Verbal Criticism, and it is he who says on the same page:-
"Dr. Birch's translation, though made about thirty years ago, before some of the most important
discoveries of the full meaning of words, may still be considered extremely exact as a rendering of the
Page 26



The Historical Jesus and Mythical-Christ by Gerald Massey
corrupt Turin text; and to an Englishman gives nearly as correct an impression of the original as the text
itself would do to an Egyptian who had not been carefully taught the mysteries of his religion."
Mr. Coleman's method, however, is the correct one for a defender of the Great Superstition to adopt; and
if he were obsessed by the spirit of some fanatical Spanish monk, one of those who urged on the
Mexican massacres, dead and damned ages since for his bigotry and cruelty, and re-incarnated to
continue the old battle against Truth, he could not have more cleverly struck the track of the Jesuit. It is
what the Christians in all ages have done to get rid of, discredit, and mystify, the pre-Christian evidences
of the mythical origins; only he lacks the requisite knowledge for doing the work.
Nor is this a matter of mere Textual interpretation; and I am calmly confident that no mere verbal changes
will invalidate the fundamental facts, the true doctrines, the identifiable mythology, found in the versions
of Birch, Lepsius, and Naville.
On the contrary, the closer the inspection made by men of insight the more will my interpretation of the
vastest number of facts ever yet collected and collated be corroborated.
Mr. Coleman has been soliciting certificates. I will give him one written on a label bound to last and stick
like pitch-plaster. It is my recognition of his claims to be
THE GENUINE GNOSTIC
He calls to Europe, high and low,
And all the Americas,-
"That is the man who does not know;
I am the man who does"!
The others join in Chorus; Oh!
They make his brain-bee buzz!
"You are right, dear friend! He does not know;
You are the man who does"!
From personal knowledge of him, and the imposture of his pretensions, I know him to be incompetent to
discuss matters of Egyptology. He is not an authority in any department of literature, and has not a soul
beyond the making of fly-dirts on the window to obstruct the light,--or of violating the privacy of letters so
foolishly entrusted to him.
In setting himself up as a critic and corrector, mentor and censor, advocate, judge and jury, all in one, he
has greatly mistaken his vocation. If he must pose as a man of letters and a symbolist, he should have
been a printer's reader, allowed once a week to carry a typical banner at the tail of a Lyceum procession

on Sundays. He may pass for one of the learned amongst those who know no better; in the realm of the
blind the one-eyed man is a king. He shows some cleverness in writing about what he does not
understand, where he is not likely to be brought to book. But he is no more capable of judging, or
qualified to give a verdict, in a matter like this, than the weevil that worms its way through one of Turner's
canvasses is fitted to pass an opinion on the picture.
He has an irritating itch for recognition, or notoriety, but has shown no sign of possessing, or being
possessed by, the genuine passion for truth. Like an incipient Herostratus or Guiteau--the fellow who
culminated as a fool gone insane with vanity--he would do anything to be talked about, or written to--even
commit Massey-cre--if he were only able.[A literary correspondent writes of this Sahur:--"I know little
about Egyptology, but I do know that the fellow deserves a--well, a 'serendible good drubbing' for his
insolence to you. Should you reply, please give him a kick from me, if only in a foot-note." ]
Never did any writer known to me put forth such strenuous or futile efforts to lift himself up by his own
shirt-collar and add a cubit to his stature in the eyes of the lookers on.
From the beginning to the end of his attempts, his aim and object, the total drift of all his deprecation, is
to belittle my work, and make himself look large to his readers through a mist of his own making. A chief
part of his criticism consists in proclaiming that he does not see! I never said he did, or could. Nelson at
Copenhagen put up the glass to his one blind eye and could not perceive the signal flying. Mr. Coleman
often puts his glass to two, with the same result of not seeing.
I have had to congratulate him on writing to me to set him right on the subject of astronomy, before he
put his foot into it on a matter most fundamentally important to my subject; the ignorance shown by his
questions being astounding.
With all his native impudence he has asserted (in the Religio-philosophical Journal), that the name of
Jesus Christ was unknown until the middle of the first century A.D. (cf. the second book of Esdras--a pre
Christian book of the Secret Wisdom.)
In the same journal he classed Baring Gould as being on my side, in opposition to all other writers on the
subject of Jehoshua Ben Pandira, and entirely overlooked the fact that although Baring Gould used the
same Talmudic material as myself, his conclusions were totally antipodal to mine; and that he remains as
orthodox to-day as were his conclusions then.
And now Mr. Coleman may pass with his certificates.
There is an American story of a dog who ran after a wolf, fast and furious at first, but before the race was
over, the dog was seen to be flying still faster--a "leetle bit in front of the wolf!"
Mr. Coleman is not an authority, and has no reputation to lose. But his private backers have; and they
have committed the unpardonable sin against scholarship of endorsing and justifying false statements
made against me by Mr. Coleman, without taking the trouble to test the truth of his assertions or to verify
Page 28

the alleged facts for themselves. They were so ready to make a mountain of an underhand, underground
worker's little molehill; they were so eager to have me knifed, that they have warranted a blade which
was treacherously limp and leaden!
Mr. Sayce marvels at my effrontery in making assertions, some of which Mr. Coleman has so falsely put
into my mouth; and then charges me with "false quotation"; and he calls Mr. Coleman's puerile
performance a "very thorough demolition," and a "real service to the cause of truth." He rejoices over
what he terms an impartial and merciless exposure.
To my thinking the Professor is rather Uriah-Heepishly thankful for exceedingly small mercies, and says
grace to a miserable meal.
Mr. --- vouches for the fact that his correspondent is "quite right;" and it appears that neither of them
knows better, or else their vision was overclouded with the bile of a bitter bigotry. Either way, I warn my
American friends that Mr. --- has made use of the official stamp (the Hall-mark, so to say,) of the British
Museum, to pass off spurious wares upon unsuspecting people in the United States! and I fancy that, for
all lovers of truth, justice, and fair play, I have so far demonstrated the congenital incompetence of my
critics to sit in judgment on my work.
It really makes one ashamed of scholarship to think of two reputed great scholars backing by taking
shelter behind a pretender to knowledge like Mr. Coleman to discredit me and condemn my work instead
of handling the matter for themselves.
My publishers tell me they sent a copy of the "Natural Genesis" to Mr. Sayce over three years ago. I have
not heard that he attempted to expose my mass of ignorance and false quotation, dispute my facts,
refute my interpretation, or controvert my conclusions. True, he is not an Egyptologist nor a master of
mythology. But that is no excuse nor justification for the conduct which I resent. It only serves as cause
for all the severer condemnation. Of course in writing a letter he might have claimed privacy for his
opinions, but cannot plead that privilege now the letter is made public.
The other writer, whom I hold to be Mr. Renouf (pro. tem.), is a professed Egyptologist, a good
grammarian, an expert in textual criticism. I am a devoted student of his writings in common with those of
other Egyptologists. But I never could think highly of his insight or range of vision. To a mind like his, in a
case like mine, the profoundest acquaintanceship with the largest mass of facts--the widest and truest
generalisation based on the facts, or the subtlest interpretation of them, will only look like a departure
away from and a going beyond the facts as limited for him.
I have dived deeply, and he fails to see
The ocean hath its due profundity.
You may transcribe texts and decipher inscriptions, but with the light shut out all round by non-application
of the comparative method, and from lack of illumination within, you cannot touch the Egyptian origins in
mythology or language, time or space, or interpret the mystery of Egypt to her own forgetful self.

Every day discoveries are proving how limited has been the outlook, how non-evolutionary and untrue
the interpretation of Egyptologists concerning the past of that people; and the latest discoveries made
have swept away many of the mental landmarks, and effaced the limits of Egyptologists like Mr. Renouf,
who have only just blazed the veriest surface of the subject. But I claim that every fresh fact made known
of late years is in favour of my interpretation. In England they have been too long the victims of the
Hebrew and Indo-Germanic delusions respecting the beginnings.
Mr. Renouf has declared (Hibbert Lectures, p. 243) that "neither Hebrews nor Greeks borrowed any of
their ideas from Egypt" (see Herodotus, Plato, Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, and others). He thinks the
"mythological symbolism" of Egypt arose from "varieties of metaphorical language" which "reacted upon
thought" and "obtained the mastery" (Ib. p. 237). Following Max Müller he says, "Mythology, we know, is
the disease which springs up at a peculiar stage of human culture" (Ib. p. 251). Nonsense. 'Tis but a
dream of the metaphysical theorist to suppose that mythology is a Disease of language, or anything else
except his own brain. Mythology was a primitive mode of thinging the early thought; the beginnings of its
sign-language being earlier than words. It remains the repository of man's most ancient science; and,
truly interpreted once more, it is destined to be the death of all those false theologies to which it has
unwittingly given birth.
He has said (Ib. p. 177) it is perhaps hopeless to expect that the Egyptian legends alluded to in the "Book
of the Dead" will be recovered. My claim is to have recovered them, by application of the comparative
process to a world-wide range of mythology; and it will be easier to denounce the audacity as lunatic than
to disprove the right to make that claim. I do not pretend and I do explain. He is one of those critics who
suspect error in what they do not understand--e.g. the Father-God Seb in one phase of character is the
Earth. But when Seb is called the Mother, Mr. Renouf suspects an error in the text. It is only the mother
who can bring forth. Hence we find the back of Seb opens to bring forth.
In his off-hand way of damning by denunciation an old friend of mine, Mr. McLennan (whose name Mr.
Renouf mis-spells twice over, once as McLellan in the text (p. 30), and once as McLennon in the index),
he asserts that the "representations" made in the zodiac of Denderah were "not anterior to the Christian
era, or Roman domination; they were borrowed from the Greeks, and were entirely unknown to the
Egyptians." (Ib. p. 30.) Whereas the inscription found at Denderah states that the Temple had been
restored in accordance with a plan discovered in the writings of Kufu; whilst the chief celestial types
pourtrayed all over the planisphere prove themselves to be solely Egyptian! When I pointed out this
passage to Dr. Birch, he said, "Certainly; the types in the planisphere are not Greek. Renouf should have
done as the artists did who gave the Greek on one side, the Egyptian on the other."
All that he was warranted in saying is that the mythological types, Typhon, Sut, Isis, Horus, Seb, Shu
and-Tefnut, and the rest of those that never were Greek, have been reproduced at a later period by
Greco-Egyptian artists, with a few modernisations. If he intended to distinguish between the Zodiacal and
extra-Zodiacal signs of the planisphere, he should have said so. But of the twelve signs the Virgin is Isis,
and the Sagittarius is composed of Shu and Tefnut. He must have known, however, that when Depuis
and McLennan spoke of the Zodiac of Denderah as being ancient, they meant the planisphere, and were
not distinguishing the one set of signs from the other.
Rays of light from the newest dawn would bring no quickening influence to such as are mentally bound
and doomed till death to remain the representatives of an expiring system of thought.

The resurrection of Egypt has brought forth a Spectre that will frighten Historic Christianity to death; or
haunt the minds of men till they lose their unworthy fears and listen like truth-lovers to the message
which she brings to them from the Grave.
What says Professor Mahaffy, after getting a glimpse of the ghost, and finding that the dead language
has come to life again? He admits that "every great and fruitful idea," "theological conception," religious
and moral doctrine, now called Christian, were also Egyptian. But, he says, "I recoil from opening this
great subject now; it is enough to have lifted the veil and shown the scene of many a future conflict."
I have not recoiled. The odium of opening this great subject now is mine. I am selected for the honour of
receiving, not the civic wreath for crown of reward, but the first blows of the bludgeon on the head from
those who raise the howl of insanity.
"You will win at last," said Captain Burton, "but 'at last' generally comes too late!" Well, I don't know. The
train I ride in travels with increasing speed.
For the present I have to ask my indiscriminating assailant to assume that responsibility to which he is
committed by Mr. Coleman and produce the evidence for his accusations. He says he has examined my
work; now let him cross-examine me. I am scarcely mad or Quixotic enough to think he will, but should
he do so, I will undertake the printing of his exposure to the extent of fifty pages, the size of the present
pamphlet.
I mean business.
I court honest criticism, and welcome genuine correction. I do not mind being misunderstood, but do
resent misrepresentation. I am in search of realities myself, and have no tolerance for men or things in
masks. I try to follow Truth, like the old Egyptians, my masters, with all the force of sincerity, all the
fervour of faith. That is comparatively easy now-a-days when bon-fires are no longer made of man or
book, and the penalties are so very slight. A loaf or two of bread the less; a greeting here or there with an
offensive epithet, a rotten egg, or a dead cat, are things to be smiled at when we remember our fore
runners that were her lovers from old, who beat out a pathway for us through all the long dark night of the
past, and lit it with illimitable rows of their burning bodies, each turned into a flaming Torch for Truth.
