The Hieros Gamos Part 1 Exorcising Bitter-Sweet Hystery
Fig 11.1: Werner Forman archive New Scientist 5 Oct 96
Please refer to the 2004 chapter of Sexual Paradox
for an updated commentary on these questions in the chapter:
Emergence of Civilization and the Fall into Patriarchal Dominion
Homo sapiens, despite evolving some 100,000 years ago, spent some
70,000 years leaving only flaked tools with only minor changes of
design. Although so-called "primitive" cultures are diverse and
parallels, between modern hunter-gatherers and our ancestral origins
remain speculative, among the very few primitive hunter-gatherers
still existant, the !Kung of the Kalahari provide a somewhat unique
perspective on our possible hunter-gatherer origins: "Here in a society
of ancient traditions, men and women live together in a non
exploitive manner, displaying a striking equality between the sexes ...
Other contemporary gathering and hunting societies have a similar
high level of equality - higher at least than that of most agricultural or
herding societies. This observation has led to the suggestion that the
relations between the sexes that prevailed during the majority of
human prehistory were comparable to those seen in the !Kung today."
Nisa



Nisa - (Shostak)
When the gods gave people sex,
they gave us a wonderful thing.
Sex is food:
just as people cannot survive without eating,
hunger for sex can cause people to die.
!Kung saying - Nisa.
About 35,000 years ago, there appears suddenly an explosion of
representational art. It is as if the birth of culture has occurred from
the primal continuum of the paleolithic. Prominent among these first
and most artistic creations are diverse representations of the creatrix
goddess of fertility, complemented by sculpures and wall paintings of
animals and the hunt of a more shamanic content. The consistency
and the careful beauty of these figurines is consistent with the worship
of the female as generator of the continued line of living existence.
While primitive men were wandering hunters who had to remain
silent in the shamanic meditation of the hunt, the women were
collecting and recognising a wide variety of plants, talking more and
socializing, forming the foundation skills that underpinned the birth of
civilization. The myths of diverse tribal cultures hint at a previous era
when women were the founding influence in this way.



The "venuses" of Dolni Vestonice, Willendorff, Lespugue (2), and
Laussel date from inter-Gravitean Solutrean 20000-18000 B.C. Note
the horn carried by the goddess of Laussel.
Despite her manifold names and forms, the creatrix goddess is one
goddess of all, who provides one world in a unified view of the life
cycle. As the earth mother, she is ever closer than the remote sky
father and nurtures all living things. However, in the world view of
the goddess, creation and destruction are integral components of the
cyclic round from birth to death, from full season to lean season,
represented in particular in the lunar phases which are coupled with
the menstrual cycle, as illustrated in the Venus of Laussel. There is no
division of the universe between good and evil, dark and light, as both
are incorporated into the cosmic cycle in a state of timeless unity. With
this interminable cycle comes a relentless, crushing reality, in which
destructive nature of death is actively accentuated in acts of animal
and particularly human sacrifice. Thus the triple goddess is a creature
of three faces the nubile virgin lover, the sustaining mother of the
harvest and the all-consuming crone of death.
Although the spiritual quest also seeks answers to life after death and
the illumination of the cosmic mind, it is in fertility that the true raw
energy of spirituality reaches it's zenith, and it is through fertility that
each of us has come into being in a continuous line of evolution from
the first life on earth, some 3,000 million years ago, to wonder at
existence and ponder our fate, and it is in fertility that both our



offspring and the environment in which we live will continue into the
future. Fertility is thus also intimately connected with the continued
survival of the people through seasonal changes and the quirks of
fortune in the fertility of earth itself. Fertility thus delves into those far
more ancient realities of the conscious universe that far pre-date the
gods and goddesses of early human civilization. On a more sinister
note, sexuality has been recognised from all quarters to be mystically
connected to the origin of death, and thus responsible for death itself.
Sex is thus steeped in sacrificial attonement in death.
Mammoth Vogelherd 32000 B.C. (Leakey 1994)
Bison Lascaux early Magdelanian 15000-13000 B.C. (Powell)
The Sorceror Middle Magdelanian 13000-11000 B.C. (Powell)
These developments are parallelled in a significant way by the
evolution of animal art associated also with shamanic identification
with animal familiars as in the "sorceror" on the right. These pictures
illustrate the equally ancient case for nature shamanism of a different
kind associated with the hunt and the psychic descent down the Axis
Mundi to the roots of conscious existence, a journey of temporary
death, or near death experience in which the shaman returns
empowered as a medicine man and prophet.
Of course sex is ultimately responsible for death, because in sexuality,
biology has discovered a trade off. Sexuality has provided a
tremendous new source of variation, which forever mixes the gene
pool in new creative ways, making it possible for higher plants and
animals to evolve. However, in sex came the death of the organism,
because each individual contributes only half their genes to the



offspring, which instead of being the phoenix clone of the parent, has
only half the identity of each parent and is thus a new individual. As
evolution of higher organisms proceeds there is an ever-diminishing
capacity for the organism to regenerate from parts. It can no longer
reproduce itself and with the passage of time falls to the very
mutational changes that permitted its evolution into being. Upon the
death of the organism, its unique identity is now lost into fragments in
the gene pool. But this loss comes at great gain. It makes it possible
for us to evolve further into being, through the altruistic sharing of
genetic identities between male and female in partnership. By the
sacrifice of eventual death, which we all face, we gain the privilege of
living in this extraordinary universe, and sharing in the ongoing
continuity of life. This is a quest whose consumation is a golden age of
unforseen splendour, if we do not destroy it through our own
ignorance first.
Hieros gamos, c 10,000 BC Europe, Negev Desert (Campbell 1988,
Avi-Yonah)
Old godesses such as Anath fertilized themselves with the blood of
men and bulls, Cybele is noted for her castrations and the ancient
myth of human origin is from clay and menstrual blood. However the
domestication and breeding of animals depends on an understanding
of the complementary role of the sexes in reproduction. Nevertheless,
the sexual behaviour of the herding animals came to have a huge
impact on human culture and sexuality. It was abundantly clear that



the male was required only for the fleeting process of fertilization,
while both birth and the long years of family-rearing depends
centrally on motherhood.
This male role is accentuated in herding animals such as the bull, but
even in human populations to this day with nominal nuclaer family
units, the Y chromosome shows little genetic variation because some
males fertilize a disproportionate proportion of females. Although the
great godess is also prominent among the mammoth hunters, the
development of agriculture and its complementation by herding
appears to have led to a cosmic struggle for power between the sexes
which is only now coming to a resolution.
Of course, once the patriarchal attitude began to hold sway, the lack
of a visible ovum led to a belief that the woman was a mere receptacle
for gorwing the man's seed, as in the Aristotelian view of biology and
in Mary's 'virgin birth' of Jesus from God alone. It is only with the
discovery of the ovum in 1827 that the genetic role of the female in
reproduction has become confirmed (Ranke-Heinemann 1992 43).
This makes it natural in a way to think of Eve as coming out of the rib
of Adam. However it is also clear that many offspring resemble both
parents, or at least frequently resemble the mother as much as the
father, so the credibility of historical patriarchal propaganda of the
Aristotelian view that woman was a mere receptacle for male seed
should be taken with substantial reservation. It is after all quite clear
that the Jews, perhaps the archetype of all patriarchal traditions
always traced Jewish descent through the mother, something which is
meaningless if she contributes no transferrable genetic identity to her
offspring.



Hieros gamos, creatrix goddess, shrine with bulls heads and pregnant
Goddess.
Catal Huyuk Anatolia 7,500 B.C. - 5,500 B.C. goddess (Melaart).
Catal Huyuk 6,500 B.C. illustrates the transition from hunter-gatherer
society to agricultural centres in which trade (e.g. in obsidian) and the
complementation between male pursuits of hunting, herding and
animal husbandry and the planting, harvesting and seed selection of
the agricultural domain of the women. The environmental confluence
of natural grain-producing areas with pasture and forest made certain
areas of the Near East, as exemplified by old Jericho circa 10,000 B.C.
and Catal Huyuk, provided an ideal backdrop for this
complementation. The central place of the generative goddess and the
counterpoint between the horned male bull and the pregnant goddess
is again reflected in the hieros gamos, sacred marriage, or ritual
consummation, clearly portrayed as being consequentially linked to
birth.
Temple with bulls heads, skulls and vultures picking headless men
(Melaart).
There are some skulls present in the temples, and death vultures are
depicted pecking headless men. The central and sacred place of the



woman's family bed in house design contrasts with the variable and
satellite position of the male sleeping arrangements and burial places.
A recent study (New Scientist 18 Jan 97 p9) even suggests that the
association of women's breasts with weasel skulls, fox teeth, boar
tusks and vulture beaks and the vultures picking at headless corpses in
the temples, the scattered skulls with marks of beheading after death,
indicate a "safety valve" to relesae the new tensions of urban living "to
vent frustration of living at close quarters through symbolic ritual
killings". however a definitive interpretation may never be arrived at.
Minoan Crete and the Snake Goddess
(Wolkenstain)
The hieros gamos of Inanna and Dumuzi.
Inanna, whom we may also identify with Ishtar, Ashtoreth, Aphrodite,
Astarte, to a certain extent Asherah, and Oestre, Ostara, the sea
goddess Mari, or Miriam and many others, is the evening star, the
Sumerian Queen of Heaven. She was the creatrix, the mother of all
men. She was Queen of Heaven astronomically as well as
theologically. She was horned, and was brought up out of the foam by
water-gods, like Aphrodite, thus explaining her close connection with
Mari goddess of the sea. Her journey to the earth and then to the
underworld cements relationship between the shepherd kings and
hieratic planter queens which formed the basis of the flowering of the



cities of Sumer from 3500 B.C., the centre of catalysis of successive
civilations to the present day.
Several authors, including Barbara Walker and William Irwin
Thompson (163) comment that the Sumerian era now represents the
fall of the Great Goddess to the phallic onslaught of the male Godhead
represented by the trinity An, Enki and Nannar who may have been
introduced by the first Indo-Aryan incursions, and that the order of
reproductive power has changed to that of erotic power to become the
Goddess of live and battle and of the seasonal abundance and regress.
Although male gods, such as Enki certainly have have entered the
pantheon, the young Goddess is nevertheless mighty and resurgent
with her youthful power:
"Proud Queen of the Earth Gods, Supreme Among the Heaven Gods,
Loud Thundering Storm, you pour your rain over all the lands and all
the people.
You make the heavens tremble and the earth quake.
Great Priestess, who can soothe your troubled heart?
You flash like lightning over the highlands; you throw your firebrands
across the earth.
Your deafening command, whistling like the South Wind, splits apart
great mountains.
You trample the disobedient like a wild bull; heaven and earth
tremble.
Holy Priestess, who can soothe your troubled heart?
Your frightful cry descending from the heavens devours its victims.
Your quivering hand causes the midday heat to hover over the sea.
Your nighttime stalking of the heavens chills the land with its dark
breeze.
Holy Inanna, the riverbanks overflow with the flood-waves of your
heart...."
(Wolkenstein and Kramer 95)



The seasonal cycle of the goddess is represented unabated in the
passage from new life in the burgeoning fertility period and death in
the lean season. The first phase is the ritual marriage of Inanna to the
shepherd king Dumuzi in the hieros gamos, the high point of the
Sumerian sacred cycle. Dumuzu ( the Shepherd King ) is actually
mentioned as the fifth king on the king lists of Sumer. He is also
referred to as Dumuzzi-Absu of the abyss, god of freshets and running
waters. He is also the heavenly shepherd of the stars.
O Wanderer, Wanderer, my brother Wanderer,
In the fields of Arallu, Wanderer, my brother Wanderer.
(Briffault v3 95)
Dumuzi at first has to pursuade Inanna to marry a shepherd king. She
is also encouraged by her mother Ningal, the Moon Goddess of Ur.
The encounter then runs hot with the young Inanna's passion for
young shepherd king Dumuzzi and their consummation, and with the
echoing fullness of pastoral fecundity. It is the very love song of
creation, which fills the earth with the burgeoning splendour of life.
"Inanna opened the door for him.
Inside the house she shone before him
Like the light of the moon.
Dumuzi looked at her joyously.
He pressed his neck close against hers. He kissed her.
Inanna spoke:
"What I tell you, Let the singer weave into song.
What I tell you, Let it flow from ear to mouth,
Let it pass from old to young:
My vulva, the horn,
The Boat of Heaven,
Is full of eagerness like the young moon.
My untilled land lies fallow.



As for me, Inanna,
Who will plow my vulva?
Who will plow my high field?
Who will plow my wet ground?...
Dumuzi replied:
"Great Lady, the king will plow your vulva.
I Dumuzi the King, will plow your vulva."
Inanna:
"Then plow my vulva, man of my heart!
Plow my vulva!"
At the king's lap stood the rising cedar.
Plants grew high by their side.
Grains grew high by their side.
Gardens flourished luxuriantly....
"O Lady, your breast is your field.
Inanna, your breast is your field.
Your broad field pours out plants.
Your broad field pours out grain.
Water flows from on high for your servant.
Bread flows from on high for your servant.
Pour it out for me, Inanna.
I will drink all you offer."
Inanna sang:
"Make your milk sweet and thick, my bridegroom.
My shepherd, I will drink your fresh milk.
Wild bull, Dumuzi, make your milk sweet and thick.
I will drink your fresh milk....
Dumuzi spoke:
"My sister, I would go with you to my garden.
Inanna, I would go with you to my garden.
I would go with you to my orchard.
I would go with you to my apple tree.



There I would plant the sweet, honey-covered seed."
Inanna spoke:
"He brought me into his garden.
My brother, Dumuzi, brought me into his garden.
I strolled with him among the standing trees,
I stood with him among the fallen trees,
By an apple tree I knelt as is proper....
Before my lord Dumuzi,
I poured out plants from my womb.
I placed plants before him,
I poured out plants before him.
I placed grain before him,
I poured out grain before him.
I poured out grain from my womb."
Inanna sang:
"Last night as I, the queen, was shining bright,
Last night as I, the Queen of Heaven, was shining bright,
As I was shining bright and dancing,
Singing praises at the coming of the night
He met me - he met me!
My lord Dumuzi met me.
He put his hand into my hand.
He pressed his neck close against mine.
My high priest is ready for the holy loins.
My lord Dumuzi is ready for the holy loins.
The plants and herbs in his field are ripe.
O Dumuzi! Your fullness is my delight!"...
"Let the bed that rejoices the heart be prepared!
Let the bed that sweetens the loins be prepared!...
He put his hand in her hand.
He put his hand to her heart.
Sweet is the sleep of hand-to-hand.



Sweeter still the sleep of heart-to-heart.
Inanna spoke:
"I bathed for the wild bull,
I bathed for the shepherd Dumuzi,
I perfumed my sides with ointment,
I coated my mouth with sweet-smelling amber,
I painted my eyes with kohl.
He shaped my loins with his fair hands,
The shepherd Dumuzi filled my lap with cream and milk,
He stroked my pubic hair,
He watered my womb.
He laid his hands on my holy vulva,
He smoothed my black boat with cream,
He quickened my narrow boat with milk,
He caressed me on the bed.
Now I will caress my high priest on the bed,
I will caress the faithful shepherd Dumuzi,
I will caress his loins, the shepherdship of the land,
I will decree a sweet fate for him."
The Queen of Heaven,
The heroic woman, greater than her mother,
Who was presented the me by Enki,
Inanna, the First Daughter of the Moon,
Decreed the fate of Dumuzi:
In battle, I am your leader,
In combat I am your armor-bearer,
In the assembly I am your advocate,
On the campaign I am your inspiration....
In all ways you are fit.
May your heart enjoy long days....
As the farmer, let him make the fields fertile,
As the shepherd, let him make the sheepfolds multiply,



Under his reign let there be vegetation,
Under his reign let there be rich grain.
The king went with lifted head to the holy loins.
He went with lifted head to the loins of Inanna.
He went to the queen with lifted head.
He opened wide his arms to the holy priestess of heaven....
My blossom-bearer in the apple orchard,
My bearer of fruit in the apple orchard, ...
My fearless one, My holy statue,...
How sweet was your allure. . . ."
(Wolkenstein and Kramer 30)
The Song of Songs as the Sacred marriage
The Renewal celebrates the return of the Sacred Marriage fulfilling
the restoration of the Feminine to her natural divinity. If you wish to
restore the hieros gamos to its original fertility and empower the
Goddess, join in the Renewal. You will thereby join in saving
biodiversity for all time. It is her natural empowerment in her
apocalyptic 'unveiling'.
The descent of the seven veils, the curse of Dumuzi (Wolkenstein and
Kramer 57, 72).
The onset of the lean season after the harvest, however brings out the
fierce dark side of the goddess of death and destruction. It is
celebrated by the entry of Inanna to the underworld, where she



dances the dance of the seven veils as her worldly attire and then her
life is reduced to nought. Inanna decides to experience the dark side
her elder sister Ereshkigal knows as Queen of the Underworld in the
death rites of the Sacred Bull of Heaven, Gugalanna, thus disguising
her formal purpose of discovery in the formal act of witnessing the
death rites of another.
Returning from the underworld, accompanied by demons who must
have a mortal in compensation, she fixes the eye of death on her
absent-minded partner who is engrossed in affairs of state, and he is
chased by the demons of hell, losing his possessions, his genitals and
his life. Inanna afterwards laments her actions and searches for him
and ensures his resurrection so that he can be brought back for six
months of the year to ensure the fertility of both the womb and the
soil. Seasonal male sacrifice of the "king" reverberates through the
goddesses from Greece to India and over much of Africa including
Cybele, Hecate and Kali. In the Sumerian view, the purpose of human
life was merely to provide sustenance for the deities.
"From the Great Above she opened her ear to the Great Below.
From the Great Above the goddess opened her ear to the Great Below.
From the Great Above Inanna opened her ear to the Great Below.
My Lady abandoned heaven and earth to descend to the underworld.
Inanna abandoned heaven and earth to descend to the underworld.
She abandoned her office of holy priestess to descend to the
underworld....
If I do not return,
Set up a lament for me by the ruins.
Beat the drum for me in the assembly places.
Circle the houses of the gods.
Tear at your eyes, at your mouth, at your thighs. ...
Go to Eridu, to the temple of Enki.
Weep before Father Enki.



Father Enki, the God of Wisdom, knows the food of life,
He knows the water of life; He knows the secrets.
Surely he will not let me die." ...
(Wolkenstein and Kramer 52)
When Inanna arrived at the outer gates of the underworld, She
knocked loudly.
She cried out in a fierce voice: "Open the door, gatekeeper! Open the
door, Neti!
I alone would enter!" ...
When she entered the first gate,
the shugurra, the crown of the steppe was removed.
When she entered the second gate,
From her neck the small lapis beads were removed.
When she entered the third gate,
From her breast the double strand of beads was removed.
When she entered the fourth gate,
From her chest the breastplate called "Come, man, come!" was
removed.
When she entered the fifth gate,
From her wrist the gold ring was removed.
When she entered the sixth gate,
From her hand the lapis measuring rod and line was removed.
When she entered the seventh gate,
From her body the royal robe was removed. ...
Naked and bowed low, Inanna entered the throne room.
Ereshkigal rose from her throne.
Inanna started toward the throne.
The Annuna, the judges of the underworld, surrounded her.
They passed judgment against her.
Then Ereshkigal fastened on Inanna the eye of death.
She spoke against her the word of wrath.
She uttered against her the cry of guilt.



She struck her.
Inanna was turned into a corpse,
A piece of rotting meat,
And was hung from a hook on the wall....
Then, after three days and three nights, Inanna had not returned,
Ninshubur set up a lament for her by the ruins.
She beat the drum for her in the assembly places.
(Wolkenstein and Kramer 52)
Neither Enlil nor Inanna's father Nannar, the Moon God of Ur, will
help her because she has craved the below, and because those who
choose the underworld do not return. Ninshubur succeeds in getting
Enki to secure her release:
Inanna was about to ascend from the underworld
When the Annuna, the judges of the underworld, seized her. They
said:
"No one ascends from the underworld unmarked.
If Inanna wishes to return from the underworld,
She must provide someone in her place."...
As Inanna ascended from the underworld,
The galla, the demons of the underworld, clung to her side.
The galla were demons who know no food, who know no drink,
Who eat no offerings, who drink no libations,
Who accept no gifts.
They enjoy no lovemaking
They have no sweet children to kiss.
They tear the wife from the husband's arms,
They tear the child from the father's knees,
They steal the bride from her marriage home....
The galla said: "Walk on, Inanna,
We will take Ninshubur in your place."
Inanna cried: "No! Ninshubur is my constant support....



"Walk on to your city, Inanna, We will take Shara in your place."
Inanna cried: "No! Not Shara! He is my son who sings hymns to me. ...
"Walk on to your city, Inanna, We will take Lulal in your place."
"Not Lulal! He is my son. He is a leader among men. ...
"Walk on to your city, Inanna.
We will go with you to the big apple tree in Uruk."
In Uruk, by the big apple tree,
Dumuzi, the husband of Inanna, was dressed in his shining me
garments.
He sat on his magnificent throne; (he did not move).
The galla seized him by his thighs.
They poured milk out of his seven churns.
They broke the reed pipe which the shepherd was playing.
Inanna fastened on Dumuzi the eye of death.
She spoke against him the word of wrath.
She uttered against him the cry of guilt:
"Take bim! Take Dumuzi away!"
The galla, who know no food, who know no drink,
Who eat no offerings, who drink no libations,
Who accept no gifts, seized Dumuzi.
They made him stand up; they made him sit down.
They beat the husband of Inanna.
They gashed him with axes."
(Wolkenstein and Kramer 71)
There follows a famous episode: the lament of Damuzzi - the lament
for all lost life:
At his vanishing away she lifts up a lament, "Oh my child!"
At his vanishing away she lifts up a lament, "My Damu!"
At his vanishing away she lifts up a lament, "My enchanter and priest!"
Like the lament that a house lifts up for its master,
Like the lament that a city lifts up for its lord,



Her lament is the lament for a herb that grows not in the bed.
Her lament is the lament for the corn that grows not in the ear.
Her chamber is a possession that brings not forth a possession.
A weary woman, a weary child forespent.
Her lament is for a great river where no willow grows.
Her lament is for a field where wheat and herbs grow not.
Her lament is for a lifeless pool with no fish.
Her lament is for a thicket with no reeds.
Her lament is for a wood with no tamarisks.
For a wilderness with no Cypresses.
For a garden without honey or wine.
For meadows with no pasture.
For a palace where long life is gone.
(Frazer v4/1 10)
Inanna and Dumuzzi's sister Geshtinanna go searching to the edges of
the steppe for Dumuzzi. Dumuzzi is finally given a partial reprieve, of
tragic irony for his sacred kings. He is allowed back in the full season,
while his sister Geshtinana, playing a role like unto Persephone, takes
his place. This means that Dumuzzi's death and resurrection become
instituted ritual - as the renowned "women weeping for Tammuz" in
the Old Testament, as well as those of Ta'uz at Harran make clear.
They weep and lament. The king dies. They grind his bones in the mill
and scatter them to the winds. People beat their breasts and searched
for the dead and resurrected God among the straw as far away as
Samarkand (Briffault v3/100).
Isis - Archetype of the divine mother

11.4 The Dilemma of the Messiahs
Such a viewpoint still arises in its essence from a great Mother
Goddess, the personification of all the reproductive energies of nature,
and associated with her a series of lovers, each the divine bridegroom,
a mortal yet resurrected god, with whom she mated year by year, their
sexual consummation expressed physically between priestess and
priest-king, and that of their worshippers at the sanctuary ensuring
the fruitfulness of the ground and the increase of man and beast
(Frazer 1890 v5/ 39). Such an idea of deity is consistent with an
inheritance down the female line in which kings held power only by
virtue of their association with a continuing female line, which is thus
immortal both by childbirth and by genealogy, while the male remains
transient and mortal likewise on both counts Traditions of transient
sacred kingships interrupted by human sacrifice are an exprassion of
this motif.
The same dying male vegetation god theme is common to Tammuz,
Osiris, Adonis, Attis, Shiva and even Dionysus, who from very early
times have been worshipped in magical rites designed to ensure the
clement passage of the seasons, the return of fertilizing rains, and the
verdant growth of spring. In their death and resurrection was believed
to be the mystic catharsis for the decay and revival of the life and
fertility upon which food and the welfare of whole societies depended.
Osiris is either shut in his coffin or felled by the river and drowned.
Adonis is gored, Attis is persuaded to castrate himself and bleeds to
death, Dionysus is torn to pieces and Virbus is dragged to his death.
Frequently this death is precipitated by the conflict between the twin
aspects of the goddess of life and death, sometimes in the form of a
jealousy or slight. Thus Hippolytus offends Aphrodite by his faith
towards Artemis and Adonis lover of Aphrodite offends Artemis. The
rites of Tammuz and Dionysus, who later evolved in myth into a



paternal deity, both appear to have originated from exclusive womens'
mystery cults (Briffault v3 105).
The flesh of Mot was similarly torn asunder in Canaanite myth once
every seven years in a way which is closely linked to the crucifixion.
Anath calls to Shapash the sun goddess for the victor Ba'al to kill Mot
and reprieve the lean season. Ba'al smites the sons of Athirat.
In the seventh year, then lo! Mot son of El
lifted up his voice unto the victor Ba'al and cried:
By reason of thee I have suffered shame,
by reason of thee I have suffered disgrace.
I have suffered winnowing by the sieve,
I have suffered with the sword and
burning by fire by reason of thee.
Grinding between two millstones.
I have suffered sowing on the day,
by reason of thee. (Driver 113)
All the grain gods were ritually ground up. Osiris was scattered over
all Egypt. The lament is not just the lament for the dying Autumn but
it is the lament of the grinding of the corn of the reaper.
They wasted o'er a scorching flame
The marrow of his bones;
But a miller us'd him worst of all
For he crushed him between two stones. - Robert Burns
The sacrificial cycle caused some herioc kings in history to refuse the
advances of the Goddess. In Babylonian myth, Gilgamesh, the hero
who helped Inanna cut down the Hulluppu tree is tempted by Ishtar
(Inanna). She offers Gilgamesh her hand in marriage. In refusing the
marriage, Gilgamesh repels Ishtar's offer with a mix of contempt and
apprehension.



.
Fig 11.10: The new King dispatches the old in the presence of the
Goddess Sumer 2300 BC (Campbell 1962 or 42)
"Tammuz, the spouse of thy youth, thou hast condemned him to weep
from year to year. Allala the spotted sparrow hawk, thou lovest him,
afterwards thou didst strike him and break his wing: he continues in
the wood and cries 'O my wings!' Thou didst afterwards love a lion of
mature strength, and didst then cause him to be rent by blows, seven
at a time. Thou lovest also a stallion magnificent in battle; thou didst
devote him to death by the goad and the whip; thou didst compel him
to gallop for ten leagues, thou didst devote him to exhaustion and
thirst. Thou didst love Ishullanu thy fathers gardener, who ceaselessly
brought thee presents of fruit and decorated every day thy table ...
thou didst strike him, thou didst transform him into a dwarf. ... Thou
lovest me now, afterwards thou wilt strike me as thou didst these".
(The Dawn of Civilization 580)
He subsequently has to protect Uruk from the vengeful ravages of the
Bull of Heaven she sends in vengeance. This myth was enacted in
Babylon annually, but the Temples of Ishtar remained. Women had
rights of divorce and had to prostitute themselves in the temple once
during their lives.
Theseus similarly rejects Ariadne, resulting in the death of his father
because he forgets to remove the black sails signalling his own death



on his return to Athens, and also the downfall of the Cretan Goddess,
despite becoming the celestial betrothed of none less than Dionysus.
Greek myth reverberates with the overthrow of the Goddess from her
earlier position of relative power.
The king was either regularly sacrificed after a fixed term of say seven
years, or might live on as long as his fertility lasted, as in Israel with
David. The sacred king of Nemi lived only so long as no other male
could take him inmortal combat, upon snapping the sacred branch.
Barbara Walker points notes that Kingship throughout Mesopotamia
was realized only through hieros-gamos with the earthly
representative o fthe Goddess. "The length of a king's reign was often
predetermined, because people thought the Goddess needed the
refreshment of a new lover at stated intervals." "Ashurbanipal said he
ruled by the grace of Ishtar." "The goddess queen's choice largely
depended on the candidate's sex-appeal. If she tired of the king's
lovemaking, he could be deposed or killed, for the queen's sexual
acceptance of him determined the fertility of the land. In many early
societies the old king was killed by a new king, usually called a "son"
although he was no blood relative." "Hence the unbroken chain of
Oedipal murders..." "Kings of Thebes and Caanan ruled for seven
years." "Kings of Zimbabwe were strangled by their wives every four
years until 1810 AD. Sacrifice of Kings extended from Africa to Greece
and Early Rome."
Barbara Walker (877) perceptively comments: "Human or animal, the
sacrificial victims of ancient cultures were almost invariably male.
Worshippers of Shiva sacrificed only male animals; the god himself
ordered that female animals must never be slain.' Males were
expendable, for there were always too many for a proper breeding
stock. The same was true even of human sacrifices, which were men,
not women. "The fertility of a group is determined by the number of
its adult women, rather than by its adult men." Therefore male blood



only was poured out on the earliest altars, in imitation of the female
blood that gave "life." That is why totemic animal-ancestors were
more often paternal than maternal. The animals'blood and flesh,
ingested by women, was thought to beget human offspring; and the
rule was "Whatever is killed becomes father." The victim was also god,
and king."
As time went by, ritual substitutes were used who became king for a
day and were then sacrificed, as was the case in Babylon. "Amazonian
Sacae or Scythians founded the Sacaea festivals of Babylon, where
condemned criminals died as sacrificial surrogates for the king, to
mitigate the earlier custom of king-killing. The chosen victim was a
sacred king, identified with the real king in every possible way. He
wore the king's robes, sat on the king's throne, lay with the royal
concubines, wielded the scepter. After five days he was stripped,
scourged, then hanged or impaled "between heaven and earth," in a
prototype of the crucifixion ceremony later extended to sacred kings
of the Jews. The object of scourging and piercing was to make the
pseudo-king shed tears and blood for fertility magic.' Babylonian
scriptures said, "if the king does not weep when struck, the omen is
bad for the year." The king or pseudo-king "became God" as soon as he
was dead. He ascended into heaven and united himself with the
Heavenly Father, i.e., the original totem father, or first victim ... When
ritual murder of kings or human king-surrogates came to be
considered crude and uncivilized, then animal victims took their
place. ... The Jews retained a custom of human sacrifice, for special
occasions, longer than any other people in the sphere of influence of
the Roman empire. Out of this tradition arose the figure of the dying
Christos in Jerusalem." (Walker 877)
11.5 Adonai the Lord
Adonis the Semitic god whose name was simply Lord, just as Yahweh



was referred to as Adonai - Lord, was originally represented as
Tammuz of Babylon and Dumuzzi of Sumeria who appears as Damuzi,
a king of Eridu who reigned for 100 years (Briffault v3 99), then as
the youthful shepherd king who is the lover of the Inanna, Queen of
Heaven, a divine icon of the mortal sacred king who was the
temporary consort of the Goddess. As we see from the descent of
Inanna, Dumuzzi was doomed to spend part of the year in the
underworld as the dying god, doomed by the Goddess, "A tamarisk
that in the garden has drunk no water ... A willow whose roots were
torn up", who later regenerates to become again the adolescent lover,
symbolic of male fertility in the spring season. He is Dumuzzi of the
abyss, "true son of the seep water" (Frazer 1890 v5/ 246), the god of
freshets and running water that drives all vegetative life.
Ezekiel 8:14 "Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the
LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat
women weeping for Tammuz."
His death was annually mourned to the shrill music of flutes, by men
and women in the month of Tammuz. Dirges were chanted over an
effigy of the dead god, which was washed with pure water, anointed
with oil, and clad in a red robe, suffused with incense to wake him
from the sleep of death.
The Greeks speak a similar story of the God Adonis they adopted from
the Semites around the 8th century BC. As a child beloved of
Aphrodite, he was given to the charge of Persephone in a chest. But
when Persephone opened the box and saw his beauty, she would not
release him. Finally Zeus mediated his return to Aphrodite for part of
the year. In myth he was killed by a wild boar (Frazer 1890 5/11).
The cult of Adonis was localized in Syria at Byblos and at Paphos on
Cyprus. Both were great seats of the worship of Aphrodite as Astarte



or in her sea aspect as Mari. Byblos has a history dating back as far as
3000 BC. The rites of Adonis were celebrated in the court of her
temple surmounted by a great conical obelisk symbolic of the
Goddess. The whole city was sacred to him and the river bore his
name. There was a sacred grove and temple to the Goddess in the vale
of Adonis at the source of the river, surmounted by astature in which
heawaits the attack of a bear and beside him Aphrodite sits in sorrow,
just as he was wounded to death in the montains and mourned
annually while his red anemone bloomed in the cedars and the river
ran red to the sea (Frazer 1890 v5/30). This is the beautiful and in
essence tragic theme of the marriage of the flower queen and Salmah
the summer king in the Song of Songs (Graves 1948 261).
At the festivals of Adonis in Western Asia and the Greek Islands, the
death of the god was annually mourned with bitter wailing, chiefly by
women; images of him, dressed to resemble corpses, were carried out
as to burial and then thrown in the seaor intl springs. His revival was
sometimes celebrated next day. At Alexandria images of Aphrodite and
Adonis were displayed on two couches; beside them were wet ripe
fruits of all kinds, cakes, potted plants and green vines twined with
anise. The marriage of the lovers was celebrated one day and the next
women attired as mourners with streaming hair and bared breasts,
bore the image of the dead Adonis to the sea-shore and committed it
to the waves, singing that he would come back again. At Byblos he
was mourned in the vernal discolouration of the river Adonis with red
earth washed from his mythical goring on Mt. Lebanon to shrill
wailing of the flute and weeping lamentation and beating of the
breast. The next day was believed to come to life again and ascend to
heaven in the presence of his worshippers. The anemone whose name
is derived from Naaman - darling, which celebrates his blood, blooms
in Syria about Easter (Frazer 1890 v5/224-6). Spring and summer, not
autumn, are the seasons for his festivals and likewise for the barley



and wheat harvests in the Near East.
Fig 11.11: The Birth of Adonis from a Myrrh Tree
(Cook)
His link with vegetations is clear from his birth in a
Myrrh tree, myrrh being traditionally used as incense at
the festival, his descent to the underworld for a third of
the year and the offerings of fruit, and plants in his
festivals, the grinding of his bones and their scattering
to the winds, as Mot in Canaan and Ta'uz at Harran
(Briffault v3 101) and his revival as reaped and
sprouting grain, and in the gardens of Adonis, baskets or pots filled
with earth in which wheat, barley, lettuces, fennel and various kinds
of flowers were sown and tended for eight days, chiefly or exclusively
by women. These shot up rapidly only to wilt and be flung at the end
of eight days with his images into the water, thus also invoking the
fertilizing rains. (Frazer 1890 v5/236).
Byblos was ruled by sacred kings whose names such as that of Yehaw
melech or Yaveh-melech bear the same title melech king. The first
name is also suggestive of Yahweh (Frazer 1890 v5/16).
Kings of Byblos and Tyre were often also priests of Astarte (Frazer
1890 v5 26), who were required to celebrate the hieros gamos with
the Goddess to ensure the fertility of the land and flocks and verdant
weather free of plague and pestilence (Frazer 1890 v5 28).
There is evidence of various forms of sacrifice associated with the
dying and resurrected god. Melcarth of Tyre, identified by the Greeks
with Hercules, was annually burned as an effigy, and originally in
human sacrifice, on a great pyre and believed to ascend to heaven in a
cloud and real of thunder, to be revived by a sacrificed quail (Frazer
1890 v5 111) in the "Feast of the Resurrection" and is the source of



the Phoenix (Briffault v3 103).
It is said in Ezekiel that the king of Tyre impersonated the god and
that he walked on hot coals as a substitute for his own immolation:
28:2 "Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus ... and thou hast said, I
am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art
a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:
... Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so:
thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and
down in the midst of the stones of fire." It is possible that when all
went well in the commonwealth, the children doomed to the furnace
of Molech may also have been spared (Frazer 1890 v5 115).
Sacrificial immolation was a fate also shared by the Talmudic
Abraham. In Thrace, Dionysus was similarly immolated in a great
flame which presaged the quality of the coming harvest. In Florence a
Christian fireworks festival on the Saturday before Easter is
commemorated in the same way (Briffault v3 104).
Carthage also records the immolation of the goddess queen Dido on
such a pyre, which appears to have become the trditional site of later
child sacrifice, in which boys were rolled into a flaming pit (Frazer
1890 5/114 Smith 1888 374,377). Although this is much rarer than
male sacrifice, it is recorded at Hierapolis, and in the legend of the
death of Astarte at Aphaca that the goddess cast herself as a star
falling into the water at the annual feast. Aphrodite likewise was said
to cast herself from a promontory after the death of Adonis (Smith
1888 375).
Across the Mediterranean the mountains of Cyprus can bee seen
distant from the shore, one days sail, and at Paphos was another seat
of worship of Astarte and Adonis. The coinage shows doves with
shrines showing pillars with horns, the cone and a star and crescent



symbolic of the Queen of Heaven. The sanctuary is of great antiquity
and may run back to the original Great Goddess. Holy stones were still
anointed at the turn of the century in the name of the "Maid of
Bethlehem", sometimes still referred to as Aphrodite, to remove the
curse of barrennes or increase the virility (Frazer 1890 v5 36).
11.6 Cuttings for the Dead
"Every fourteen days we make a sacrifice of our hair and then sweep
the clippings together" A Carthusian monk (Ranke-Heinmann 1992
294).
The cult of Astarte and Adonis took place under the auspices of the
god of the new moon. It included the building of a Temple of Astarte,
a procession through the streets of the city, singing and lighting a fire
for the Queen of Heaven, sacrifice, baking bread for Astarte and cakes
for the participants of the festival, shaving and the construction of
pillars for Adonis. It was familiar to Jeremiah in Jerusalem (7:17).
The children collected wood, their fathers lit the fire for Astarte, the
women made bread for the Queen of Heaven, they burned incense
and offered libations, and they offered sacrifice and cut their hair in
mourning. The ritual coincided with astral and seasonal phenomena
and it purpose was to celebrate the simple satisfactions of life and to
appease the power of evil and death.
These strands of hair he trimmed as he entreated Astarte. Tamassos
presented himself and made a complete offering, "May this rouse the
weepers to look for their beloved". This passage is reminiscent of the
Song of Songs and the offering of hair in fulfillment of the Nazirite
vow, but its association with mourning for the dead was expressly
forbidden by the Deuteronomic historian. The cult of Astarte included
a complex of rites in which the dead were honoured to invoke the
expectation of enduring life in succeeding generations. (Peckam)



Similar rites were performed at Mari. (Malamat)
The followers of Astarte have always been noted for their ceremonies
for the dead and for the dying and resurrecting god of fertility, in
which the hair was cut off. "At Byblos people shaved their heads in the
annual mourning for Adonis. Women who refused to sacrifice their
hair had to give themselves up to strangers on a certain day of the
festival, and the money which they earned was devoted to the
Goddess. This custom may have been the mitigation of an older rule
which at Byblus as elsewhere formerly compelled every woman
without exception to sacrifice her virtue in the service of religion."
(Frazer v4 38). This substitution of hair applied also to the ritual
prostitution required of each woman before marriage. "At later times
at Byblos, it was the custom to be able to commute the period of ritual
prostitution required by the Goddess by the cutting off of her hair, as
is done at the present day by Catholic nuns when becoming mystically
married to the divine bridegroom". (Briffault v3 220)
Fig 11.12: Mary Magdalene Cutting off her Hair
Livre de la Passion 14th cent
"In ancient Israel mourners were accustomed to testify
their sorrow for the death of friends by cutting their
own bodies and shearing part of their hair so as to
make bald patches on their heads." (Frazer Folk v1
270) "Both the great and small shall die in this land:
they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut
themselves nor make themselves bald for them." (Jer 16:6) Amos
(8:10) likewise noted "I shall turn you feasts into mourning ... and
baldness upon every head". Micah goes further "Make thee bald, poll
thee for the children of thy delight, enlarge thy baldness as an eagle."
"Yet in time these observances, long practised without offense by the
Israelites came to be viewed as barbarous or heathenish" so that in



Deuteronomy 14:1 we find "Ye shall not cut yourselves not make any
baldness between your eyes for the dead". This is later repeated in
Leviticus 19:27, and picturesquely in 21:1-5 it is attributed to Moses
himself "And the Lord said to Moses ... they shall not make baldness
on their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard,
nor make any cuttings in their flesh".
Robinson-Smith notes furthermore "Among the Hebrews and the
Arabs, and indeed among many other peoples both ancient and
modern, the laceration of the flesh in mourning is associated with the
practice of shaving the head or cutting off part of the hair and
depositing it on the tomb or funeral pyre." (Smith 323) Among the
Arabs this rite was exclusive to women who wrapped it in a cloth
stained with their own blood, having scratched their cheeks and upper
parts. The Hebrews by contrast shaved the front part of the head only.
"Now among the Semites and other ancient peoples the hair-offering
is common, not only in mourning but in the worship of the gods, and
the ritual in the two cases are so exactly similar that we cannot doubt
that a single principle was involved in both. ... Arab women laid their
hair in the tomb of the dead [wrapped in blood scratched from their
face and breasts" (Frazer OT 4/273)], young men and maidens in
Syria cut off their flowing tresses and deposited them in caskets of
gold in the temples. The Hebrews shaved the fore part of their head in
mourning; the Arabs of Herodotus habitually adopted the like tonsure
of their god Orotal [Du Sara].
Mary Magdalen was reputed to have long tresses which she is likewise
described as cutting in mourning. According to the Jewish midrash,
Jesus mother's name was Mary M'gadd'la -the hairdresser, an unclean
profession. Cuttings from dead people were often made into wigs by
unscrupulous hairdressers.
11.7 Adonai Mashach of Yahweh



Briffault (v3 110) notes the tension between Yahweh-Adonai and the
Adonai who was Lord consort of the Canaanite Astarte. As the Hebrew
shepherds settled in the lands around Canaan, they found their own
race and their own religion modified by the effects of agricultural
civilization. Their lunar deity was now eclipsed, taking a subservient
role to the Queen of Heaven in the land of milk and honey - an
abomination to their more conservative elements.
It is notable that David, who donned the crown of Milcom God of the
Ammonites chose the ancient city of Salem as his royal capital, stands
as a sacred king in this ancient tradition. In life the Hebrew king was
regularly addressed as Adoni-ham-melech "My Lord the King" and
after death he was lamented with cries of Hoi! ahi! Hoi Adon! "Alas
my brother! Alas Lord!" "These exclamations of grief for the death of a
king of Judah were we can hardly doubt, the very same cries which
the weeping women of Jerusalem uttered in the north porch of the
Temple for the dead Lord Tammuz." (Frazer 1890 v5 20) Although
Adon simply means Lord secular or religious, it is nevertheless true
that Jewish Kings were sacred sons of God, embodying Yahweh on
earth. Their throne, and the anointing with oil as which was believed
to impart holy spirit,
The significance of the king as sacred is stressed in David's cutting of
Saul's garment 1 Sam 24:5: "And it came to pass that David's heart
smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. And he said unto his
men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the
LORD's anointed [Adoni Messiah Yahweh]."
The term Molech, the deity associated in the old testament with child
sacrifice in Israel 2 Kings 23:10 "And he defiled Topheth ... that no
man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to
Molech", is simply an intonation of 'king' suggesting that such
sacrifices were to renew the vitality of a sacred king, whose



responsibility it was to maintain fertility and clement weather as well
as the strength and welfare of his subjects. Such child sacrifices were
slain before they were burned Ezek 16:21 "That thou hast slain my
children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire
for them?"
Isaiah records that this was a pyre to the king in the name of Yahweh
30:33 "For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared;
he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much
wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle
it." "However the Hebrews did not burn their dead except in rare
circumstances" (Smith 1888 372).
The kings of Damascus, Moab and Israel all adopted sacred kingship
in various forms. The ancient Canaanite kings Adoni-bezek and Adoni
zedek clearly had names identifiable with Adonis as Lord. The latter is
identifiable with Melchizedek the 'king of righteousness' of Salem of
Genesis 14:18. Such ancient kingship rites would link to Ezekiel's
reference to Tammuz.
The Kings of Israel were also accountable for pestilence and famine.
When the rains failed David as king upon an oracle sacrificed seven of
Saul's offspring to the barley harvest (2 Sam 21:1). In a very specific
sense the king was the son of God who was promised a perpetual
throne for his germ line: 1 Chron 17:11 "And it shall come to pass,
when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers,
that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and
I will establish his kingdom. He shall build me an house, and I will
stablish his throne for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my
son:"
11.8 The Anathema of the Holy Whore
Matt 21:28 "Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots



go into the kingdom of God before you."
Canaanite Anath was accursed by Abba the Father because she was
the Goddess who called for the destruction of El's son Mot, the Lord of
Death, who cried to his Father in vain, as Ba'al replaced him to
become the verdant season. Anath was a consort of Yahweh at
Elephantine as late as the 5th century BC.
As with many other parts of Western Asia, women were required
before marriage to prostitute themselves to strangers at the sanctuary.
"It was a law of the Amorites that she who was about to marry should
sit in fornication seven days by the gate." - Testaments ofthe Twelve
Patriarchs. At Byblos people shaved their heads in mourning for
Adonis. Women who refused had to give themselves up to a stranger
on a certain day and give the proceeds to the Goddess. Matrons as
well as maids testified their devotion to in the same manner (Frazer
1890 v5 37) to cure barrenness or to propitiate the Goddess and win
her favour. Such prostitution involved no stigma in later marriage.
Frazer (Frazer 1890 v5 79) suggests that the term 'son of God', which
still exists to this century in association with the hajira, can be traced
to the divine offspring of such sacred unions, which extended to many
deities including the divine physician Aesculapius through whose
serpent barren women were believed to conceive in his sanctuary
(Frazer 1890 v5 80). Augustus was born in this way (Ranke
Heinmann 1992 24). This title is however also shared by Israeli kings.
Hosea speaks similarly that young married women prostituted
themselves at sanctuaries on the hilltops under the oaks and
terebinths Hosea 4:13 "They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains,
and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms,
because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall
commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery."



Hosea's dilemma goes to the heart of the biological reality of the
conflict between Yahweh and the Queen of Heaven. Sacred
prostitution had a chaotic effect on paternal inheritance lines, but kept
maternal lines intact. It also furthered to link women in a matriarchal
bond of independence from their partners. The patriarchs no longer
know whether children of their wives are their own, and can never
really know where the germ line has gone. Hence the fire and
brinstone rhetoric from the Father God. Walker (820) notes: "Such
laws were supposed to appease the Goddess, who disapproved of
monogamy in the ear when there was no formal marriage and
children didn't know their fathers."
Sacred women were associated with the temple who wove hangings
for the asherim, the poles standing beside the altar as embodiments of
Astarte until the time of Josiah 2 Kings 23:7 "And he brake down the
houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where
the women wove hangings for the grove." The term sodomites is
usually taken to refer also to 'sacred men', but Walker (822) claims the
original meaning of sodomite was a holy harlot - a bride of God,
which she also suggests were set apart to give birth to Sons of God,
prophets or sometimes sacrificial victims.
The Holy Harlot was also a Virgin because she remained unmarried.
Ishtar-Asherah-Mari-Anath was both the Great Whore and the Great
Virgin Mother (Walker 822). Mary Magalen was the penitent Holy
Whore and Mary Mother of James and Joses and Jesus was the Virgin.
Ishtar the Great Whore of Babylon announced "A prostitute
compassionate am I" (Walker 820).
The author of Revelation had other ideas. He clearly saw in her the
sacrifice of Christ: 17:4 "And the woman was arrayed in purple and
scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls,
having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of



her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written,
MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND
ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH." And I saw the woman drunken
with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of
Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration." Unique
in the Bible for capitalization.
Temple prostitutes were also healers, sorceresses, prophetesses and
seers. Zonah in Hebrew means both prostitute and prophetess. The
major temples of Aphrodite has several thousand apiece. (Wakler
820).
Time itself is a sacred whore. The hour comes from houri Gk horae,
Pers houri, who kept the hours of the night by dances - the "ladies of
the hour".
In a sense Maya or illusion is the same sacred whore of the physical
world complete with its law of entropy. However, this whore is our
very own life-blood.
Even as late as Augustine we hear "It is better that women should
picke wool or spinne upon the Sabbaoth day, than they should dance
impudently and filthily all day long upon the daye of the full moon".
11.9 The Lilly among theThorns
The canticle of canticles gives perhaps the most eloquent description
of the hieros gamos of all time. Foolishly discounted as a simple piece
of secular love poetry, it is the true nature of the hieros gamos
revealed. The thorns of sacrifice of the vegetation god among the
anenomes are ever present: "As a lilly among thorns, so is my love
among the daughters. As the apple tree among the trees of the wood,
so is my beloved among the sons. " So is the traditional search for the
lost Tammuz "I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but



he gave me no answer."
11.10 Haman the Lord of Death of Esther
Esther is a fictitious literary account written anonymously by someone
living probably in Susa around 250-180 BC of a threat of genocide to
the Jewish population of the Persian empire. The names Esther and
Mordecai are thinly disguised references to Ishtar and Marduk the
patron god of Babylon who slays the chaos mother monster Tiamat.
The entire episode is a portrayal of the Babylonian rite of Sacaea in
terms of an allegory of Jewish history. In it God is not mentioned. It is
as if the omission is a profound silence. Something omnipresent but
forbidden to be spoken. By contrast Esther and Mordecai become
"very nearly God's redemptive action incarnate" (Miles 361). The
effects of even handling the book became later an issue of debate (Fox
R 110).
After a seven day festival, King Ahasuerus of Persia, calls on his
chamberlain, who has made a feast for the women to dance the
descent 1:11 "To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the
crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she
was fair to look on. But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's
commandment". The princes consider the matter a contempt "For this
deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they
shall despise their husbands in their eyes".
The most beautiful maids ofthe realm are brought to Shushan his
capital. Esther pleases him most and becomes his queen. Mordecai,
her cousin, who has recently saved the king from an assasination plot
by telling Esther, declines to bow to Haman the new Prime Minister
"He explained to them that he was a Jew".
Now comes the lot that will cause Purim to precede the Passover: 3:7
"In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of



king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman."
Haman now offers silver to the king to issue an edict to destroy the
Jews. Mordecai and the Jews tear their garments and don sackcloth
and ashes in mourning the crisis. There is however no call to God.
When Esther fears to enter the court unsummoned, a capital offense
unless the king holds out the golden sceptre, Mordecai says "Think not
with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all
the Jews. ... and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom
for such a time as this?" inferring the synchronous reason fer her
position is to save the Jews.
Ester commands Mordecai to fast three days and does likewise "I also
and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king,
which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish." Now on
the third day, Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner
court and when the king saw Esther, she obtained favour in his sight:
and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre and touched the
top."
Now comes the quote which will echo dowm to John the Baptist 5:3:
"Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what
is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom."
a ritual acclamation to the Queen of Heaven on the third day after the
descent, to avoid the mistake of Dumuzzi's forgetfulness. The queen
then claims Haman 5:4: "And Esther answered, If it seem good unto
the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that
I have prepared for him." At the banquet she says she will give her
decision at the second banquet on the morrow with Haman and the
king.
Haman is at first delighted, but when Mordecai again does not bow,
"Zeresh his wife and all his friends [say], Let a gallows be made of



fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that
Mordecai may be hanged thereon." But in the night the king discovers
Mordecai has saved his life and not been rewarded. Haman appears
and the king asks "what should be done to whom the man the king
delighteth to honour?" Haman thinking it is himself says to bring the
king's royal apparel, his horse and crown and lead the man in glory
through the streets.
The king now says to give this favour to Mordecai. Haman
immediately knows he is doomed and covers his head and goes to his
house in mourning. He is then summoned to the second banquet
where Esther reveals his plot of genocide 7:6: "The adversary and
enemy is this wicked Haman." Haman now pleads for his life to Esther,
but ends caught in fatal consummation as the king returns from the
garden: "Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then
said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As
the word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face."
Haman is then hanged on the gallows he has prepared.
Worse is yet to come, because the king orders a reverse warrant to
allow the Jews to commit retributive genocide "to destroy, to slay and
to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that
would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil
of them for a prey". "Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the
stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they
would unto those that hated them.", but did not take the spoil. When
they slaughter 500 in Shushan, Esther asks the King for more and to
hang Haman's ten sons who have been slaughtered on the gallows. In
all 5000 people are killed.
9:26 "Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur."
The March feast of Purim on the 14th of Adar became a kind of
Bacchanal at which there was drinking, farcial theatre and the effigy



of Haman was hanged on the gallows - a notable source of
consternation to early Christians and a precursor to the passover.
Ta'uz of Islam
The rites to mourn Hussain, the martyred son of Ali and Fatima are
similarly celebrated by great weeping mourning, the devout muslim
striking his head to express his grief so the blood runs, after which the
representations of the tomb, 'ta'ziya' or lamentations, a possible
corruption of Ta'uz, are deposited in special cemetries, or like the
effigies of Tammuz, thown into a body of water (Briffault 3/98).
The True Christs of Malabar
"The most vivid example on record of an 'immolation' of the sacred
king is probably that in Duarte Barbosa's Description of the Coasts of
East Africa and Malabar in the Beginning of the Sixteenth Century.
The god-king of the south Indian province of Quilacare in Malabar (an
area having a strongly matriarchal tradition to this day) had to
sacrifice himself at the end of the length of time required by the
planet Jupiter for a circuit of the zodiac and return to its moment of
retrograde motion in the sign of Cancer-which is to say, twelve years.
When his time came, the king had a wooden scaffolding constructed
and spread over with hangings of silk. And when he had ritually
bathed in a tank, with great ceremonies and to the sound of music, he
proceeded to the temple, where he paid worship to the divinity. Then
he mounted the scaffolding and, before the people, took some very
sharp knives and began to cut off parts of his body - nose, ears, lips,
and all his members, and as much of his flesh as he was able
throwing them away and round about, until so much of his blood was
spilled that he began to faint, whereupon he slit his throat." (Campbell
1959 165).



Fig 11.29: The Dance of Maya represents the Universe of Mind and
Body as the Fall from the Cosmic Hieros Gamos. As the withdrawal
from union occurs the female (objective) perfroms the dance of
illusion making the male (subjective) belief they are many and
generating from her uterus the material diversity of the physical world
(Rawson 1973 19).
Consummating the Illusion of the sacred Marriage
A parallel to the Fall from Eden is the dance of Shiva, Lord of Death
and Shakti the divine sexual aspect of Kali-ma the Dark Goddess of
Destruction and Creation. A central meditative climax of the tantric
method is awakening the kundalini, the psycho-sexual force of
illumination which ascends the chakras of the spine. In Tantric
cosmology, existence is a fall from unity between the genders, where
subject and object, mind and body are at first in intimate and divine
unity and then begin to separate from their wholeness to become the
dance of Maya the physical world and sensory experience which
draws us into the world of suffering and mortality, away from the still
point of the eternal cosmic mind.

The great hope and joy of the tantric path is that by reversing this
process, by a unification of the genders into their full
complementation, the Tao of existence will again be fulfilled. Tibetan
Buddhist meditation similarly approaches the sacred union of female
and male energies in total illumination in the rite of Yab-Yum - father
mother. Tantric sexual meditation involves prolonged coitus reservatus
aimed at elevating the psycho-sexual energy.

hand" Paul Piripi
(NZ Herald) It has been the subject of protests by the

Thanks-giving to Tane - Guardian of the World Tree
The Great Penis which was swallowed by a Vagina.
The polynesian Maui who fished up Aotearoa and is
also a hero of Hawaii had the biggest and most
powerful penis in creation. "Hina was originally the wife of Monster
Eel, Te Tuna [Phallus]. Hina leaves Te Tuna and goes to forage for a
new lover. Calling out "I am the first woman to come utterly without
shame seeking the eel-shapes rod of love. I am the dark pubic patch,
pursuing the assuagement of desire. I have come to you by way of
unnumbersed shores - along sandy beaches. O detumescent staff, be



plunged in the consummation of love. I am this woman from afar,
desiring you ardently." No one will take her. Maui's mother says "Take
that woman for yourself". Te Tuna arrives to challenge him, with four
spirits accompanying him, one called 'clitoris continuously suffused'.
Maui is assailed by a Tsunami, but his mother shouts "Be quick, let
your phallus be seen". They enter into a phallic duel in which Maui
enters Te Tuna and tears him apart (Campbell prim 191).
"But fatally, Maui decided to crawl into the vagina of Hine nui te Po,
Hine of the darkness, lying flashing where the cold mountains meet
the sunset, with eyes of greenstone and hair of kelp, planning to
vanquish her and come out her mouth so that death would have no
power over men. But as he crawled into the cosmic vagina, the fantail
burst out laughing, waking Hine who strangled Maui in rebirth." The
song of the fantail thus has an aura of death (Alpers).

On to Part 2 The Gospel of Miriam - Christ and the Fruitful Mother



The Hieros Gamos Part 2: The Gospel of Miriam
Please refer to the 2004 chapter of Sexual Paradox for an updated commentary on many issues in the chapter: A God Whose Name is 'Jealous'
The sequence of seven paintings by Fra Angelico of the seven stages of
Mary illustrate the way in which the two Marys, the "virgin" and the
"sinner" Magdalen complement one another as the Goddess
counterpart of Jesus as the dying and resurrected God. It is as if they
are really manifestations of the more ancient Aphrodite-Mari. Notice
the transfiguration and subsequent humiliationof the sacred king
reccuring as central motifs, just as the Babylonian king was annually
humiliated (Morante and Baldini).
The Bridegroom and the Sacred Marriage



Frazer (1890) was one of the first to enunciate the deep relation
between Christian worship and the pagan celebration of the dying and
resurrected god. At the turn of the century Reitzenstein and Bousset
again pointed out the remarkable similarity of this motif, which was
still prevalent in the first century AD and still an undercurrent in
Galilee, which had always held the Northern tradition of Joseph
(Schonfield), and had only in the last 200 years been forcibly
converted to Judaism by the Maccabean revolt and the Hasmoneans.
However many modern scholars have difficulty comprehending the
way in which the crop cycle became reinterpreted by Jewish thought
into the apocalyptic historicity of the Suffering Servant. Wilson (I 141)
for example claims that "on closer inspection the parallels are
unimpressive" and suggests that, despite the universal gospel claims
that Jesus expected to return, "the women's fear and astonishment"
indicates that no one was expecting his resurrection. This illustrates a
condition at the heart of Christianity, in which, despite its manifold
pagan influences, accentuated particularly in relation to Jewish belief
and expressed centrally in the eucharist, Christian thought is
committed to the concept of paganism as an opposite anathema.
Jesus the Christos is described as a Son of God of a Virgin mother. He
is sacrificed in the season of the Festival of Adonis. He is the 'bread of
heaven' who brake bread to feed 5000 and left the bread as his body
in rememberance of him. He is the resurrected saviour who is
witnessed, particularly by women, ascending into heaven. He
peformed the descent of Inanna with Mary Magdalen the 'prostitute'
out of whom seven devils were cast. He has a specific following of
women of Galilee who ministered unto him. He describes himself
as the bridegroom in citing the messiah reading of Isaiah 61 at
Nazareth:
The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me;



because the Lord hath anointed me ...
to proclaim liberty to the captives,
He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation
as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments
and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels
Often this image of the Bridegroom and bride is likened to Christ and
his church and the Cross itself is identified with the 'marriage bed'. Of
course there is a deep tradition in this in the Song of Songs being an
allegory of the relationship between Jehovah and the bride Israel but
in the context of a messiah, this sacred marriage sybmolism carries
Christianity dangerously into the kingly sacrifice of Anath - 'the
bridegroom cometh'.
The motivating vision for this relationship would however seem to
come from Ezekiel 16 rather than Isaiah, in which Yahweh describes
himself as a bridegroom and Israel as the (unfaithful) bride:
Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time
was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy
nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with
thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine. Then washed I
thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee,
and I anointed thee with oil. ... I decked thee also with ornaments,
and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. ... But
thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because
of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that
passed by; his it was. Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold
and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images
of men, and didst commit whoredom with them, And tookest thy
broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil
and mine incense before them.



This image of the whoredom of Israel against Yahweh and his
covenant is then carried over to the love of Christ for his Church.
However this sense of Christ as Bridegroon is exceedingly
blasphemous because he is then claiming to be Yahweh .
It is true that by coming to undo original sin, he is addressing the
'whordom' of Israel - the feminine sociobiological initiative - at its root
source Eve. But this is not the sense Jesus became Bridegroom in
Isaiah 61 at all. There the poetic marriage imagery is both more
balanced between bridegroom and bride and verdant in its
appreciation of nature as the "planting of the Lors", "trees of
righteousness" "as the earth bringeth forth her bud". When we come to
the 'last analysis' the male sheep were scattered and it was the women
who were his only support in his hour of need, and who pronounced
the exaltation.
Here follows the tale of the Bridegroom:
Mark 2:19 "And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the
bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they
have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. But the days will
come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then
shall they fast in those days."
In Mark the bridegroom marries the virgins 25:1 "Then shall the
kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their
lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.... While the
bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight
there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to
meet him. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. And
the five foolish said unto the five wise, Give us of your oil; for our
lamps are gone out. But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there
be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and



buy for yourselves. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came;
and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the
door was shut."
In Luke we are reminded to wait on the Lord as a returning
bridegroom12:35: "Let your loins be girded about, and your lights
burning; And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord,
when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and
knocketh, they may open unto him immediately."
Jesus however turns the sacred redeemer into an end-of-days Messiah
of cosmic renovation - the Bridegroom to end all bridegrooms. His
demeanour is somewhat macho towards the virgins who aren't up to
the mark. "Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
open to us. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know
you not. Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
wherein the Son of man cometh." The bride has now become the
eschatological church in a similar sense to Ezekiel.
In John the bridegroom is pronounced by John the Baptist, suggesting
a sacred marriage as part of a secret rite of coronation. 3:28: "Ye
yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I
am sent before him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the
friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth
greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is
fulfilled."
The Gospel of Thomas further elaborates the nature of the sacred
marriage:
(75) Jesus said, "Many are standing at the door, but it is the
solitary who will enter the bridal chamber."
(61) Jesus said, "Two will rest on a bed: the one will die, and the
other will live." Salome said, "Who are you, man, that you... have



come up on my couch and eaten from my table?" Jesus said to
her, "I am he who exists from the undivided. I was given some of
the things of my father." ... "I am your disciple." ... "Therefore I
say, if he is destroyed he will be filled with light, but if he is
divided, he will be filled with darkness."
(104) They said to Jesus, "Come, let us pray today and let us
fast." Jesus said, "What is the sin that I have committed, or
wherein have been defeated?" But when the bridegroom leaves
"the bridal chamber, then let them fast and pray."
(105) Jesus said, "He who knows the father and the mother will
be called the son of a harlot."
Both Thomas and the synoptic gospels declare in many parables Jesus
as the fertility Christ of seed, Tree and harvest:
(20) " 'Tell us what the kingdom of heaven is like.' He said to
them, 'It is like a mustard seed. It is the smallest of all seeds. But
when it falls on tilled soil, it produces a great plant and becomes
a shelter for birds of the sky.'" (cf Mark 4:31). Matthew (13:32)
has the birds nest in the tree, which becomes a veritable tree of
life.
Jesus is anointed on the head by a woman, not a prophet as with Saul
and David, is sacrified being watched over by three women including
Magdalene other Marys, Salome, and a company of women from
Galilee, and it is Magdalene the whore who witnesses his resurrection
three days later. After which he ascends into heaven.These diverse
references are widespread and consistent throughout the gnostic and
synoptic gospels.

Mari the Fruitful Mother
The Assumption: Velasquez (Benard)
Rev 12:1 "And there appeared a great wonder in
heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the
moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of
twelve stars: And she being with child cried,
travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered."
The 'Virgin' is by tradition the Queen of Heaven. Just
as Semele the mortal mother of Dionysus was
originally a goddess, so was Mari, or Miriam:
Mari was the name of the goddess on whose account the Egyptians of
1000 BC called Cyprus Ay-mari and is associated with Mari on the
Euphrates and at Amari in Crete. The name of the Goddess Mari of
Cyprus is written with a 'buckled post' which stands for a reed hut,
meaning 'dwelling in' and a buskin, so she was resident in a buskin,
like the goddess Isis, who in Egypt bore her name 'Asht' on her head,
together with a buskin - suggestive of the lame sacred king. Mari
means fruitful mother (ama mother sum, rim to bear child). Marienna
is the 'fruitful mother of heaven', hence Miriam, Marian, and
Mariamne: a word of triple power. (Graves 1948 326, 371, Walker
584).
Isis - the archetype of the divine mother
"Is the Moon named Miriam among you?" "The moon has many names
among our poets. She is Lilith and Eve and Asharoth and Rahab and
Tamar and Leah and Rachel and Michal and Anatha; but she is Miriam



when her star rises in love from the salt sea at evening" (Graves 1946
22).
Her blue robe and pearly necklace were classic symbols of Maria "the
Seas" , edged with pearly foam. Another manifestation in Jesus' time
was the dolphin Goddess of Edom. The virgin was called "the
gathering together of the waters" (Walker 584). She appears
prophetically as the "water of life" in Revelation 22:1. Like the galla of
Inanna, Mari is associated with seven nether spirits of the ocean. One
of the three towers of the Jerusalem Temple bore the name of the
queen Mariamne (Walker 614).
Miriam in parting the reed sea is her manifestation: Exod 5:19 "For
the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen
into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon
them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the
sea. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in
her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and
with dances."
She is a 'virgin' only in the sense that she is not subject to the male
fertility taboos of the Father God. Although identified with Diana and
Artemis, by the Christians, partly to advance moral correctness, Mari
the 'fruitful mother' is a manifestation of fecundity and maternal love,
not prudishness.
As Madonna and child, in image and apocrypha, she is fashioned by
Christianity in the archetype of Isis and Horus: "Out of Egypt have I
called my son" (Matt 2:15). Here are three images of the Goddess, the
last in her death twin Nephthys:
O Thou holy and eternal Saviour of the human race ... Thou bestowest
a mother's tender affections on the misfortunes of unhappy mortals, ...
Thou dispellest the storms of life and stratchest forth thy right hand of



salvation, by which Thou unravellest even the inextricably tangled
web of Fate ... Thou treadest death underfoot. To thee the satrs are
responsive; by Thee the seasons turn ... and the elements are in
subjection (Walker 453).
"I am nature, the Parent of things, the sovereign if the elements, the
primary progeny of time, the most exhalted of the deities, the first of
the heavenly gods and goddesses, the queen of the dead, manifested
alone and under one form, ... my divinity is adored throughout the
world" (Walker 453).
"Terrible one, lady of the rain storm, destroyer of the souls of men,
devourer of the bodies of men, orderer, producer, and maker of
slaughter, ... Hewer in pieces of blood... fire lover ... cutter-of of heads,
devoted one, Lady of the Great House, hider of her creations" (Walker
454).
She was worshipped by the Semites as Mari-Anath in consort as an
Elohim Mari-El. Anath was the death twin of Mari, Lady of Birth.
"Anath annually cast her death-curse anathema maranatha
'bridegroom come' sacer - 'holy' and 'accursed' - on the Canaanite god",
fulfilling Mot's slaying of Ba'al and his destruction in turn by her. Mot
stood for the barren season that slew its own fertile twin Aleyin, the
son of Ba'al. "Mot-Aleyin was the son of the virgin Anath and also the
bridegroom of his own mother. Like Jesus the Lamb of God, Aleyin
said 'I am the lamb which is made ready with pure wheat to be
sacrificed in expiation.' " (Larousse) "After Aleyin's death, Anath
resurrects him and sacrifices Mot, telling him he has been forsaken by
his heavenly father El." Mot cries - El, El why hast thou forsaken me?
"The sacred drama included a moment when Anath broke Mot's reed
scepter, to signify his castration, again foreshadowing a detail of the
Christian Gospels. ... Naturally the god-killing Anath was much
diabolized in patriarchial legends. Abyssinian Christians called her



Aynat "the evil eye of earth". They said she was an old witch destroyed
by Jesus, who commanded that she must be burned and her ashes
scattered on the wind" (Walker 30). This is precisely what happened
to women all over Europe as a result of Paul's reverse curse : 1 Corinth
16:22 "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
Maranatha."
Maranatha (Syriac, the Lord will come- i.e. to execute judgment). A
form of anathematising among the Jews. The Romans called a curse
or imprecation a devotion- i.e. given up to some one of the gods:
Ana-tithenai: to set up, dedicate [a curse], maranatha: Our Lord
[bridegroom], come.
The Magi at the Grotto of Aphrodite (Peschio)
11.13 The Three Marys and the Seven Veils
Bethlehem means "the House of Bread" (Frazer 1890 5/257), St.
Jerome stated "Bethlehem ... lay formerly under the shadow of a grove
dedicated to Tammuz, that is to say Adonis, and the very grotto where
the infant Christ uttered his first cries resounded formerly with the
lamentations over the lover of Aphrodite" (Briffault 3/97). Mary was
described as a Virgin who in the Annunciation conceived a child,
begotten of god.



Fig 11.15: Van Eyck's Annunciation emphasizes two
aspects of Aphrodite, the lillies and the dove (Benard)..
It is quite clear that Jesus parentage was a source of
conern to early Christians and of satirical derision from
the Rabbis. Matthew 1:19 confesses that Joseph was
concerned not to make Mary "a publick example". The
Talmud claims that Jesus was Yeshua ben Pantera the
illegitimate son of Mary M'gadd'la (the braider or
hairdresser) by a Roman (Graves 1953 98, Wilson I 62) and that she
was 'descended from princes and rulers but consorted with carpenters'
(Graves 1946 6). Was it Mary who had the royal line?
John 8:39 also expresses the Pharisaic allegations: "They answered
and said unto him, Abraham is our father. ... We be not born of
fornication; we have one Father, even God". Luke 3:8 appears to
respond to this with a diatribe from the Baptist on divine birth "begin
not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say
unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto
Abraham."
The penalty for an engaged woman becoming pregnant was death,
although changes to the law had made this a rare event. Jewish law,
based on a polygamous male line has no concept of adoption . Holders
of priestly office had to have a full-blooded genealogy (Ranke
Heinmann 1992 35, 65). John 8:7 also embeds a political whitewash
in the form of the poetic episode of the woman taken in adultery,
climaxing with "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a
stone at her", however this is an obvious interpolation missing from
the Codex Sinaiticus (Wilson I 17).
With John's and Jesus' Essene influence in mind, it is worth noting
that Essene men were "convinced that no woman remains faithful to



one man" and associated with women only for the specific aim of
achieving pregnancy and had "nothing more to do with them" once
they became pregnant.
It is also worth noting that John had an independent 'immaculate'
conception from Elizabeth, who, despite having a spouse, was
menopausal, like Sarah and several other 'barren' matriarchs,
particularly Hannah, who also offers a song (1 Sam 2:1-10). It has
been suggested that the magnificat originally applied to Elizabeth for
this reason (Ranke-Heinmann 1992 47). Elizabeth's tradition was
independently preserved by the Mandaeans, suggesting the divine
birth was a tradition, which had a matriarchal component following
down from Sarah.
The two genealogies of Matt 1:1 and Luke 3:23, which in mythical
vein goes all the way to Adam, are inconsistent with one another and
are both broken at Joseph. Jesus' genetic claim to Davidic messiahship
is thus invalid as portrayed and replaced with a divine claim as the
virgin son of God, a claim shared only by such gods as Adonis,
Dionysus, Horus, Attis, Mithra, Krishna and a few legendary heroes
such as Buddha and Zoroaster (Spong 1992 56) who are likewise
products of religious mythology. Even if one genealogy is attributed to
Mary, as suggested both by Catholics and significantly by the Talmud,
and by Graves (1946) as a twin genealogy of the sacred king to the
land, the lack of a paternity link to Joseph portrays Christ's claim to
being Messiah entirely in the same category as Dionysus, the son of
Zeus and mortal Semele.
Matthew's mythic genealogy conspicuously notes four women: Tamar,
Rachab, Ruth and Baathsheba (mentioned only as 'her that head been
the wife of Urias'). Each, by their promiscuity, redeems the royal line
of Israel. Tamar and Rahab were Canaanites. In Genesis 38:14 Tamar
covers her head and sits by the wayside as a prostitute to secure the



seed of her father-in-law to conceive. In Joshua 2:1 Rahab, the
friendly prostitute, secretes the spies who precipitate the fall of
Jericho in her whorehouse. Ruth is a Moabite widow who returns with
her mother-in-law to Bethlehem, gleans the favour of Boaz in the
cornfield and offers herself to him on the threshing floor. Baathsheba
is the adultress for whose troth David had his general, Uriah killed, to
God's curse (2 Sam 19:9), who ensured by her personal influence that
her son Solomon became king. Is this intended to infer the same fate
upon Mary?
The famous virgin birth quote of Isaiah 7:14 "Behold a 'virgin' shall
conceive and bear a son - Immanuel" cited by Matthew 1:23 in
midrash prophecy is in Hebrew 'almah young woman and in Greek
parthenos virgin, which also means 'unwed' priestess of a Goddess
(Briffault 3/169). Neither term suggests a non-biological virgin birth,
which would be inconsistent with a Jewish messiah (Ranke-Heinmann
1992 40) despite later Christian misconceptions. The term 'almah is
used in Song of Songs 6:8 in a context which is obviously consort.
Paul echoes this perspective in his founding statement in Galatians 4:4
(49-55 AD)
But when the time had fully come,
God sent forth his son,
born of a woman, born under the law,
to redeem those who were under the law,
so that we might receive adoption as sons.
Many people accuse Paul the Pharisee of gentile heresy against Jesus'
Jewish teachings, but here Paul acknowledges Jesus is born of a
woman to redeem those under the law - the Jews, and also is born
legitimately.
Paul at Romans 1:3 has another pertinent comment about Jesus'



paternity, which again suggests a legitimate link to David in either the
paternal or maternal line:
Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord,
which was made of the seed of David
according to the flesh.
According to Eusebius, close relations of Jesus were arrested by the
Roman authorities for their descent from David for up to a century
after the crucifixion (Wilson I 71).
Fig 11.16: The dove descending on Mary in the annunciation, by a
Dionysian angel.
Mary has a particularly astute look of the woman about to be 'taken' in
sexual union.
Notice the sceptre of kingship similar to the one which Esther
touched. - Grunwald (Pevsner and Meier).
In "True Faith and the Virgin Birth", David Holloway (The Times 20
Dec 1986) cites the tradition that Joseph 'personally' told Matthew
and Mary 'personally' told Luke. While this may be specuous, it
highlights a theme notable in the two gospels.
The tradition of Jesus ben Joseph who is not the physical son of
Joseph, but his spiritual descendent indicates in the gospels the
tradition of the blood-stained Josephic messiah.



While Matthew 1:20 has Joseph announcing the virgin birth,though
merely have a dream visitation , in the case of Luke 1:28 it is a male
angel, Gabriel 'hero of God', who personally "came in unto her" saying
"Fear not Mary, thou hast found favour with God". This is the frank
language of a sexual liaison and continues even more specifically "The
holy-begotten one will be called the son of God". 'Begotten' is usually
amended (Ranke-Heinmann 1992 42). "And Mary said, 'Behold the
handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word'." And the
angel departed from her.
Mary is referred to in the gnostic Protoevangelium of James (150 AD)
as a 'kadesha' - or temple hierodule, (Walker 1049) whose name
originates from Qadesh, the Queen of Heaven of Sinai, after whose
waters Moses' doom was sealed (Num 20:11). She was portrayed, like
John the Baptist, as the miraculous child of an old couple, Joachim
and Anna, who was dedicated to God and raised in the temple by holy
men and when she reached puberty entrusted to an elderly widower,
Joseph (Spong 1992 212). Note that in the oldest references, Jesus
was "born under the law" Gal 4:4 "made of the seed of David
according to the flesh" Rom 1:3 who "sprang out of Juda" Heb 7:14. It
is thus likely Jesus' father was chosen by a religious protocol and
explains Joseph's subsequent acquiesance to her pregnancy.
Several authors have noted that the stories of the virgin birth in Luke
and Matthew do not make historical sense and are as much in conflict
as the two accounts of Genesis (Fox R 27; Ranke-Heinmann 1992 5,
20; Spong 1992 43; Wilson I 55). The best interpretation that can be
put on them is that they are later constructions of midrash designed to
verify Christ's divine coming and his to authenticate his claim to being
the Davidic messiah descended from David (by God) and born in
Bethlehem like David according to the prophecy of Micah 5:2.
Matthew has the family livingin Bethlehem while Luke situates them



in Nazareth. The census of Luke 2:1 would not have taken Joseph to
Bethlehem, because it was based on property ownership not
genealogy. There is no substance to Matthew's tale of the slaughter of
the innocents by Herod 2:13, and no possibility that the two accounts
could have taken place together because King Herod King of Judea
quoted by both Luke and Matthew could not have been alive for
Quirinus's census, which was in 6 AD to institute direct rule of Judea
(Fox R 28, Ranke-Heinmann 1992 9). There is also frank discord
between the flight into Egypt of Matthew 2:14, and Luke's quiet
sojurn as Jesus is offered at the temple 2:22. Matthews passage is
obvious midrash on Jesus as a new Moses, slaughter of the innocents
in Egypt (Ranke-Heinmann 1992 29), and other episodes (Exod 4:19
= Matt 2:20 etc.).
Luke's passage bears careful attention. First Jesus is a 'firsborn of the
matrix' claimed as an offering by God, and secondly there is a formal
offering of doves: "And when the days of her purification were
accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the
Lord; (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that
openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) And to offer a
sacrifice: A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons." The lamb also
required by Lev 12:6 is mysteriously absent. The rite occurs
specifically in the presence of a very ancient prophetess, also by the
name of Anna, who had lived with an husband for a symbolic seven
years from her virginity, and for 84 years after his death. Anna
appears to leave a long and two-fold matriarchal shadow.
The reaction of most sceptics is to relegate much of Luke's writing to
the status of Greek fantasy along the lines of mystery cults, elevating a
simple Jewish hero to the status of a divine redeemer. This is a
mistaken point of view for several reasons. Israel was, despite its
nationalism, a crossroads of all Near Eastern cultures and had been
subjected to the successive influence of every major civilization. The



divine saviour was as much a Semitic motif as it was Greek. Jesus'
teachings in all four gospels abound with references to the sacred
marriage, the bread of heaven, and the women followers who anoint
him, minister unto him, witness his death and announce his
resurrection. To try to eliminate all these features would wash the
messiah out with the anointing oil, leaving only a minor Jewish
trouble maker with a few Essene slogans.
Thus an alternative interpretation to the idea that the accounts of the
virgin birth were simply later inventions of midrash is that Mary went
to Bethlehem to consecrate Jesus as a 'son of God' in a more ancient
rite in the grotto at the 'House of Bread', David's birthplace, and later
completed this dedication by an offering of doves with Anna at the
Temple in Jerusalem. This would appear to give a simple answer to
why a heavily pregnant woman, whose partner did not own land in
Bethlehem made a difficult journey there right on the point of birth.
One of the earliest seats of the Christian church was at Antioch. This
was where Paul first announced his ministry and where the term
Christian was first coined. When the emperor Julian arived at Antioch
at the time of the Adonis festival, he was welcomed as if he had been
a god by a crowd who cried that the "Star of Salvation had dawned
upon them in the East". Astarte as the "morning star" of the East
(Frazer 1890 5/259), which can be seen in daytime, "may have
guided the 'wise men of the East' to Astarte's grotto in Bethlehem, the
hallowed spot which heard the weeping of the infant Christ and the
lament for Adonis": Matt 2:2 "Where is he that is born King of the
Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship
him."
Astarte as Queen of Heaven, whose girdle was the Zodiac, was also
worshipped in respect of other phenomena such as meteor strikes and
probably also comets, such as the appearance of Halley's in 12 BC



(Fox R 34) which would coincide with John's older Jesus (8:57).
The star of Bethlehem has a variety of other ingenious explanations
which confuse the nativity date further. Kepler himself noted a striking
conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in 7 BC noting this conjunction in
Pisces occurs in a Rabbinical reference to the Messiah's appearance.
There was also a nova reported by the Chinese in 5 BC (Wilson I 56).
Fig 11.17: The Baptism, overlooked by women,
with Aphrodite's dove descending - Francesca
(Lavin).
All accounts of John's meeting with Jesus, in the
accounts of his baptism, specify Aphrodite's dove
of peace descending Mark 1:10: "And
straightway coming up out of the water, he saw
the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him".
According to the historian Josephus, Salome (shalom - peace) was the
name of the daughter of Herodias and Herod Philip, whom Herodias
divorced in order to marry his brother Herod Antipas. When John
spoke against the marriage of Herod Antipas to Herodias, his brother's
wife, Herod imprisoned John. Salome danced before Herod Antipas
[the descent of Inanna - the seven veils] Mark 6:22 "And when the
daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased
Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask
of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. And he sware unto
her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half
of my kingdom. And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What
shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist."
One could conclude that John intentionally arranged to have himself
immolated as a substitute sacred king in the public celebration of
Herod's incestuous and adulterous marriage to Herodias (Walker



470).
John had already made a prophetic statement of his own sexual
immolation 3:10 "And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the
trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn
down, and cast into the fire."
Salome - Beardsley: Jochanan and Salome, The Belly Dance, The
Sacrifice (Wilde)
Salome: "Jokanaan, I am amorous of thy body. ... Neither the roses in
the garden of the Queen of Arabia, nor the feet of the dawn when
they light on the leaves, nor the breast of the moon when she lies on
the breast of the sea ... there is nothing in the world so white as thy
body. Let me touch thy body." "Back daughter of Babylon! By woman
evil came into the world." "They body is hideous ... it is horrible." "It is
of thy hair I am enamoured, ... like the black grapes that hang from
the vine trees in the land of the Edomites." ... ."I am waiting for my
slaves to bring me perfumes and the seven veils and to take off my
sandals." Herod: "The moon has a strange look tonight. ... She is like a
mad woman who is seeking everywhere for lovers. The clouds are
seeking to clother her nakedness. ... She reels through the clouds like
a drunken woman" (Wilde 2-64)
Magdalen: In the Jewish writings, Miriam M'gadd'la - Mary the
Braider is identified as Jesus' mother. " The braider of women is



usually taken to mean women's hairdresser, since the notice is hostile
and hairdressing for women was a despised and unclean profession;
this was a period of elaborate coiffures and the chief purveyors of hair
for wigs were professional grave robbers who also supplied witches
with corpse flesh. A women's hairdresser will have been suspected of
being a dealer in charms and philtres. ... But 'braider of the women'
could also refer to Mary's particular task among the temple women
who made the veil of the sactuary" (Graves 1953 99). Mark 15:37
notes the temple veil was rent on Christ's death, another clear symbol
of the involvement of women in the passion. This could refer to the
mother during her time as kadesha however it could also refer as a
satyrical Jewish pun to Magdalen as a spiritual adoptee.
In Christian writings, Mary Magdalen is a different person from Mary
the mother of Jesus, James and Joses, and distinguishable again from
Mary of Bethany.
By comparison with the other women in Jesus' following, Mary
Magdalen "alone stands out undefined by a designation attaching her
to some male as wife, mother, or daughter and she is the only one to
be identifiable by her place of birth". Magdalini in Greek signified her
belonging to el Mejdel (Migdal = tower) a prosperous fishing village
on Galilee. It was destroyed in 75 AD because of its infamy and the
licentious behaviour of its inhabitants (Haskins 15). A tiny desolate
domen shrine marks the site. The name has also been identified with
Magdal-eder of Micah 4:8 "the stronghold of the Daughter of Zion" to
whom it shall come in passages fulfilling reunion with the feminine
assembling her that limps and gathering her that is driven out in
peace under the vine and fig (Starbird 50).



Magdalen the Holy Whore (New Yorker 3 Oct 1994):
"Not only are we compassionate of ourselves, but we
are compassionate of all the race of mankind" (Malvern
49).
Her ... whose fair inheritance Bethina was and jointure
Magdalo:
An active faith so highly did advance,
That she once knew, more than the Church did know,
The Resurrection so much good there is deliver'd of her,
that some Fathers be loth to believe one woman could do this.
But, think these Magdalens were two or three. John Donne (Haskins
3)
The Copts identified all three Mary's as one, but the Greeks regarded
Magdalene as a member of Jesus' 'womenfolk'. At the end of the sixth
century, the Pope Gregory the Great made the identification of the
sinner, Mary of Bethany and Magdalene a dogma (Haskins 16). The
eastern Church by contrast kept these separate (Haskins 26). Pagan
ideas of the trinitarian goddess would seek three distinct Maris: the
bride (Magalen or Bethany), the Virgin Mary, and she who anoints for
the burial (unnamed or Magalen).
Luke 8:1: "And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout
every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the
kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him, And certain women,
which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called
Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, And Joanna the wife of
Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which
ministered unto him of their substance." The Greek version says
"them" inferring the 12 were also supported by the women (Walker).
They are also referred to in Mark (15:40) "There were also women
looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the



mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; (Who also, when
he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many
other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
Magdalene is often identified with the woman who anoints Jesus head
to his doom: Mark 14:3 "And being in Bethany in the house of Simon
the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster
box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box,
and poured it on his head. ... And Jesus said, Let her alone; why
trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me. ... She hath
done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the
burying. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done
shall be spoken of for a memorial of her." Matthew parallels Mark's
discourse.
The foot anointing in Luke is in a lighter vein and is contrasted by
Jesus himself with the head anointing which dooms him. The person
who anoints Jesus' feet is a 'sinner' reminiscent of the 'seven devils' of
Magdalene whom some people have associated with 'sacred'
prostitution and of course the descent of Inanna: 7:37 "And, behold, a
woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat
at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet
with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed
his feet, and anointed them with the ointment." Jesus defends these
physical advances and contrasts her anointing with that of the head,
indicating a separate event: "Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman
since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with
oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with
ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are
forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same
loveth little." This person could be Mary Magdalene but it is not for



Jesus' burial.
A woman letting her hair loose in itself symbolizes impropriety in
Jewish society. A good Jewess allowed none but her spouse to see her
heai unbound, and by loosening it in public, she gave grounds for
mandatory divorce (Haskins 18).
The 'sinner ' anoints Christ's feet while seven galla emerge Giovanni
de Milano (Haskins 198).
In John, Mary the sister of Martha and Lazarus is portrayed in a
different light. She lives in Bethany of Judea and she calls on Jesus to
return there to save her brother: 11:1 "Now a certain man was sick,
named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister
Martha."saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. Now Jesus
loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus."
Jesus delays ceremonially for two days. Lazarus dies and is 'stinking'.
Martha goes out to meet him. In almost ritual style Jesus has Martha
declare 11:27 "Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of
God, which should come into the world." Mary then appears as Jesus'
sacred Mistress: "And when she had so said, she went her way, and
called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth
for thee. As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto



him." This term is used again by Magdalene at the burial - Rabboni.
When Martha had complained for serving help Jesus indicates she has
a pivotal role to play Luke 10:41: " Jesus answered and said unto her,
Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: But
one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which
shall not be taken away from her." This could be interest in his
teachings, but sounds more like the role of partner.
When Jesus Calls on Lazarus, he groans. This very act of 'miracle
work' with well-known associates, sets the stage for his own demise, a
life for a life, because the priests plot because of this miracle, that he
should become the atonement king "Nor consider that it is expedient
for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole
nation perish not."
John then tells a story in which the foot anointing leads to Jesus'
demise: 12:2 "There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but
Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. Then took
Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the
feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was
filled with the odour of the ointment. Then saith ... Judas Iscariot,
Simon's son, which should betray him, Why was not this ointment
sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? ... Then said
Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this."
Mary is thus acclaimed by Jesus as the only one who has
foreknowledge of the inner mystery that is about to take place, unlike
his disciples.
This role of Judas is ritual. He is the accursed sacrifice, just as Jesus is
the atonment sacrifice. He is the ram in the thicket. He is the dark one
who commends Jesus to his fate by treachery and is then in his turn
later sacrificed by spilling his guts in the field of blood. There is



scarcely a more Canaanite image than this!
Fig 11.21: The Ritual Sequence: Sacred birth in the grotto of
Aphrodite, the baptism crowned by Aphrodite's dove, the ritual of the
atonement king, the lament of the 'companion' Mary, the dying god
hanging in his tree (Internet).
The spiritual tradition of Galilee continued ancient forms of Israelite
worship of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. There were influential
populations of Essenes and Rechabites in the eastern deserts
stretching to Damascus, where the New Covenant was made. The
northern tribe of Joseph had always celebrated the Day of Atonement
in memory of Joseph's bloodied coat of many colours, assimilating
certain aspects of Tammuz into the prophecy of a dying messiah in the
tradition of the Suffering Servant (Schonfield 207). Jesus thus knew
he was prophesied die in Jerusalem in the style of Tammuz and
indeed came to Jerusalem with a weeping party of women from
Galilee. Aspects of Pauline Christianity often believed to be a non
Jewish pagan heresy against the first Nazorean Christians are derived
from his journeys to Damascus and Arabia where the Tammuz or Dhu
Shara aspect of Jesus was more srongly felt.
Jesus declares himself to be grain of Tammuz in John 12:23 "The hour
is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it
abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth
his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep



it unto life eternal."
The manifestation of the Bridegroom as Tammuz, fertility god of
spring, becomes clearer in the journey on the ass into Jerusalem: John
12:13 "They took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him,
and cried, Hosanna: And Jesus said 'Fear not, daughter of Sion:
behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt'." Although this is
quoting Zecchariah 9:9 exactly, it is clear that the sacred fertility king
Salmah, the Prince of Peace (Isa 9:6) - shalom, after whom Jeru-salem
was named, and to whom the Song of Songs was of course dedicated,
arriving greeted with palm leaves in the spring festival to greet the
'daughter of Zion', Jerusalem herself, has all the sexual overtones of
the 'bridegroom of fertility.' Jesus had already escaped being taken by
force and made king previously in John 6:15, so it is clear that sacred
kingship was a fluent tradition in Israel at the time.
It is said in Hebrews 6:20 "Jesus, made an high priest for ever after
the order of Melchisedec", fulfilling Ps 110, "king of Salem, priest of
the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of
the kings, and blessed him" (Gen 14:18) "first being ... King of
righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of
peace." This appears to have been a continuity of an existing Essene
tradition (Wilson Edmund 193).
The fig is symbolic of female sexuality. Dionysus is born with a phallus
and a fig. Jesus first says to tend the fig for three years to see if will
bear fruit before cutting it down (Luke 13:6). He has three passovers
in his mission in John. In his last day in Jerusalem, he curses the fig
tree for not bearing fruit and it withers (Mark 11:12).
Matthew clearly describes ritual humiliation of the sexual sacred king
in his scarlet robe with the traditional breaking of his 'phallic' reed
sceptre also reflective of the humiliation of the king in the Saturnalia



and more specifically the Sacaea festival in Babylon (Frazer 1890 v7
412) 27:28: "And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his
head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before
him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And they spit
upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head." Luke is
even more specifc that he is castrated, and by Herod's Jewish soldiers
23:11: "And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and
mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again
to Pilate."
The release of Bar-abbas 'son of the father' in a paired scapegoating
noted in all four gospels is consistent with a ritual sacrifice in the
manner of Mot and Ba'al and of course Haman and Mordecai Mark
15:6: "Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner,
whomsoever they desired. (Luke 23:16 notes: For of necessity he must
release one unto them at the feast.) ... But Pilate answered them,
saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? ... But the
chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas
unto them" and they said 'Crucify him, crucify him' . Ironically
Barabbas may have been a respected Zealot, whom the priests
rescued.
This is consistent both with Pilate's hand washing and the blood being
upon the Jews: Mark 27:24 "When Pilate saw that he could prevail
nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and
washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the
blood of this just person: see ye to it. Then answered all the people,
and said, His blood be on us, and on our children."
This theme is again consistent with the ceremonial title given Jesus
somewhat determinedly by Pilate in John 19:19" And Pilate wrote a
title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF



NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. ... Then said the chief priests of
the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I
am King of the Jews. ... Pilate answered, What I have written I have
written."
The hypothesis that the Crucifixion ... was merely the annual fate that
befell the malefactor who played Haman appears to go some way
towards relieving the gospel narrative of some difficulties which
otherwise beset it. Pilate's reluctant acquiescence to the rabble
becomes easier to understand if we assume that the custom obliged
him annually at this season to give up some prisoner on whom they
might play their cruel pranks. ... the most he could do is choose the
victim (Frazer 1890 v7 416). While millions of Jews have been
hounded to death for two millennia by Christians for the blood of
Christ and twentieth century religious historians instead turn their
blame on Pilate, who was after all a brutal Roman Procurator (Pagels
1995 28), the truth lies not in blame on either side but in a cruel and
ancient celebration of the hieros gamos of the sacred king.
It is noted by Philo that when Agrippa, Herod's grandson, passed
through Alexandria after his coronation in Rome in 38 AD, the people,
in satirical celebration, rounded on a helpless lunatic entitled
'Carabas', put a paper crown on his head, thrust a broken reed into his
hand by way of a sceptre, and chanting 'Lord, Lord!' surrounded him
with bludgeon men and demanded his opinion in mockery on
questions of law and policy. This suggests the rite was known of the
Jews and that 'Barabbas' was the title of the scapegoat, who instead of
meeting his fate as a condemmned criminal, was paraded in indignity.
"Son of the father" could derive from the ancient practice of sacred
kings who sacrificed their sons in ther stead. (Frazer 1890 7/418-9).



Fig 11.22: The Three Marys at the crucifixion
Francesca
These resemblances with the Sacaea and its Jewish
manifestation in the Purim can be explained as
occurring on the Passover in several ways. It appears
that the Babylonain Sacaea "did fall in Nisan at or
very near the time of the Passover" (Frazer 1890
7/415). Purim, which was a month earlier, would
likely have originally been on this date, as the lot of Pur was cast from
Nisan. Provoked by the messianic spectacle of the sacred king arriving
on an ass during the Passover, an enactment of the Sacaea appears to
taken place. It is also notable that the king of the Saturnalia was
allowed a period of licence of thirty days before he was put to death,
precisely the interval between Purim and Passover.
We know that the disciples "all forsook him, and fled" and that even
Paul denied Christ three times, however the women made it all the
way to the Crucifixion, and three 'Marys' waited lamenting until the
end. As the December 1996 issue of Life comments (54) "Where were
the Apostles?" Faithfully following Zechariah 13:7?
In his last moments in Luke, Jesus in effect curses the female in
Essene end-of-time rhetoric, while clearly being lamented in the
traditional style of Adonis: 23:27 "And there followed him a great
company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented
him. But Jesus [Salmah] turning unto them said, Daughters of
Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your
children For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps
which never gave suck".
His last cry "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" - 'El, El, why have you



forsaken me?' is the cry of Mot for El when Anath has pronounced the
Anathema maranatha condemning Mot to death in favour of the victor
Ba'al. "and some said 'Behold he calleth for Elias' and one ran and
filled a sponge with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave it to him to
drink saying, 'Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him
down'. And Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost." Mark
15:34. Johns requiem 19:30 "It is finished" - 'it is consumated' is the
final marriage of the cross.
In the Ugarit slaying of Mot, Shapash says (Driver 115):
"How of a truth shall the bull El, thy father hear thee? ...
verily he will overturn the throne of thy kingdom,
verily he will break the sceptre of thy rule"
Jesus in fact has four Mot/Aleyin twins. The first is Didymos Judas
Thomas (Tammuz) the 'doubting' one of John and the gnostic 'twin'.
The second is Judas Iscariot the 'traitor', who in Matthew hung
himself accursed and in Acts was rended in the 'field of blood', also
named after the 'potter' who, despite Zechariah, is also the maternal
Creatrix-slayer. One can see clearly in Jesus and Judas (another
traditional sacred king title) Aleyin the 'lamb' and the black traitor of
chaos and the devil. Both die by hanging. Only the 'white king' is
resurrected. The third is Bar-Abbas - a traditional Sacer hero. The
fourth is Simon the Cyrene, possibly the last player.
Mark 15:37 "And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
bottom" - the marriage is consummated and the hymen is rent.
Luke 23:48 And all the people that came together to that sight,
beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and
returned. This is originally a cry "Woe unto our sins; for the
judgement and end of Jerusalem is drawn nigh" (Schonfield 274).



There are in each gospel three women attending the crucifixion the
consistency, despite variation of the characters, suggests that the three
women are part of the sacred drama: Mark 15:40 has them as follows:
"There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and
Salome (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and
ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with
him unto Jerusalem." These same three figure in an apocryphal insert
into Mark as having been snubbed by Jesus as he came through
Jericho "And they came to Jericho: ... and the sister of the youth
whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome were there and Jesus
did not receive them; ... and as he went out of Jericho with his
disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of
Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging." Matthew 27:55 has: "And
many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus
from Galilee, ministering unto him: Among which was Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother
of Zebedees children." Luke 23:49 is less specific at the Crucifixion
"And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.", but reverts to the
three-fold pattern at the tomb. John 19:25 has a slightly different set
of muses: "Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene." The
only satisfactory explanation of two 'sisters' being Mary is that they
are sisters in law, but this idea was developed later (Wilson I 151). It
is extremely unlikely these repeated motifs concerning the Marys and
the women would have been included in all four gospels, given the
already established patriarchal heritage that followed Paul, had not it
had a pivotal basis in history.



Fig 11.23: Three Marys are also present to anoint him at the empty
sepulchre (Hendy 31).
There were three who always walked with the Lord:
Mary his mother and her sister and Magdalene,
the one who was called his companion. Gospel of Philip
From his controversial sermon at Galilee, we note that mother Mary is
'the mother of James and Joses': Mark 6:3 "Is not this the carpenter,
the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and
Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended
at him."
And in each of the gospels it was the women, and particularly Mary
Magdelene who were first to see the risen Christ, for which she
receives the title Apostola Apostolorum - apostle of apostles: Mark
16:9 "Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he
appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven
devils." Now unfortunately this section of Mark is missing from the
Codex Sinaiticus recovered from St. Catherine's monastery and is thus
beilived to be a later addition, however Luke 24:10 confirms "It was
Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and
other women that were with them, which told these things unto the
apostles." and of course they are not believed "And their words
seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not." Matthew is
very difficult to believe after all souls emerging in the crucifixion, and
ceratinly again there is an earthquake and angels everywhere.



Discounting the angel and the earthquake, we still however have
these two female participants. 27:61 "And there was Mary Magdalene,
and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre." out the
sepulchre when the others left. A little later we find then back: 28:1
"In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of
the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the
sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of
the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone
from the door, and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning,
and his raiment white as snow."
Fig 11.24: Noli me tangere (Titian Hendy 103)
In John 20:1 it is Mary Magdalene who calls [the risen] Jesus
'Rabboni' and who afterwards utters the exhaltation to the others:
"The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was
yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the
sepulchre.
When she goes to get Peter the disciples did not understand the
Resurrection of the dying god: John 20:8 "Then cometh Simon Peter
... then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the
sepulchre, and he saw [the empty napkins] and believed. For as yet
they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead."
They depart but Mary waits.



Mary then utters the searching cry for Tammuz: 20:13 "And they say
unto her, 'Woman, why weepest thou?' She saith unto them, 'Because
they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid
him'." Compare with the Song of Songs "I opened to my beloved; but
my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone: my soul failed
when he spake : I sought him, but I could not find him". Significantly
the Syrian expression Maran atha "Our Lord Cometh"! became a sort
of password which the believers used among themselves to strengthen
their faith and hope (Renan 147).
Immediately she turns and he is there! 20:15: "Jesus saith unto her,
Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him
to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence,
tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus saith
unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni;
which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, "Touch me not; for I am
not yet ascended to my Father:" In Greek this reads 'Do not embrace
me'." The gardener of course is Adam.
Just as Inanna's descent and the resurrection of Attis took three days,
so did that of Jesus, following on from Jonah: Matt 12:40 "For as
Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the
Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."
"St Paul says that Christ 'descended into the lower parts of the earth'
(Eph. 4:9). St Peter writes that Christ 'preached unto the spirits in
prison (1 Pet. 3:19), meaning hell; and also that'the gospel was
preached to them that are dead' (1 Pet. 4:6). The Apostles' Creed
states explicitly that Christ 'descended into hell' " (Walker, Benj. 79).
Keeping the Genie in the Bottle: Gnosticism, Orthodoxy and
the Creed
"There is still the question of why it was to her Christ appeared after



his resurrection, and why, if a fundamental part of the Christian
kerygma (preaching) is based on the witness of Mary Magdalene and
other women, its importance and meaning has been played down in
the Christian tradition" (Haskins 31).
Magdalen and the Exaltation: Jesus' Feminine Complement
As the first and only human to witness the resurrection of Christ, Mary
Magdalene clearly occupies the pivotal position at the very origin of
Christianity. Just as Jesus was the Bridegroom, Magdalene is the true
bride of the Church - the feminine physical principle which
complements the transcendental Christ. It is to her if anyone that the
chruch should turn as a physical embodiment of the Shekina in
history. Her time of penitence is ended.
Renan (1853) cmments: The cry "He is risen!" quickly spread among
the disciples. Love caused it to find ready credence everywhere. ...
Had his body been taken away, or did enthusiasm ... create afterwards
the group of narratives by which it was sought to establish faith in the
resurrection? ... Let us say however that the strong imagination of
Mary Magdalen played an imortant part in this circumstance. Divine
power of love! Sacred moments in which the passion of one possessed
gave the world a resuscitated God! (Renan 215)
Fig 11.25: Magdalen - Apostola Apostolorum
announcing the Resurrection to the Apostles Albani
Psalter b 1123 (Haskins facing).
This role of Mary is akin to that of Miriam in
relation to Moses (Haskins 47). The Jews
identified her as Jesus' mother, but she appears
more as the witness of the risen Christ, second
born, just as Moses was in the bullrushes. This
role, which parallels that of Isis, raises serious questions concerning



the anointings.
Easter is of course the European festival of Astarte, who is named
Eostre.
Matthew notes concern that Jesus disappearance and resurrection
might be staged by his followers. The Jews entreaty Pilate: 27:63
"Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet
alive, After three days I will rise again. Command therefore that the
sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by
night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from
the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first." This fear was
clearly realized.
Some gnostic texts followed a docetic belief that Jesus was not fully
human - a spiritual emanation which neither blinked nor left
footprints, who appeared to John in a vision while being crucified,
and to Peter: "Who is the one above the cross who is glad and
laughing?" "He ... is the living Jesus, but he into whose hands and feet
they are driving the nails is his fleshy part, the substitute (Pagels 1979
91). Others saw in the passion a paradoxical Christ of two natures, a
physical person who suffered, and a transcendental Logos of
gentleness who in his incarnation transcended human nature so that
he could prevail over death by divine power (Pagels 1979 109).
One gnostic Christian text even reverses the doom that fell on Jesus in
exchange for Barabbas. It is noted in Matt 27:32 that immediately
after the humiliation "as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene,
Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross." The "Second
Treatise ofthe Great Seth", a revelation dialogue allegedly delivered by
Jesus, says "It was another, their father who drank the gall and
vinegar; it was not I. They struck me with the reed; it was another,
Simon, who bore the cross on his shoulder. It was another on whom



they placed the crown of thorns,. But I was rejoicing in the height ...
and I was laughing at their ignorance." (Robinson 365, Pagels 1979
91).
Given four 'twins', a large following of women, and centuries of the
Dionysian heritage of enacting tragic drama, it is by no means 'beyond
all reasonable doubt' that it was Jesus who was crucified, nor that the
person crucified really died. Jesus declined to partake of myrrh, (Mark
15:23) and died so quickly that "Pilate marvelled if he were already
dead" and called the centurion to affirm it (Mark 15:43). Only one
gospel reports he was pierced with a sword (John 19:33), and then
only for midrash to satisfy Zechariah 12:10 and John 7:38. His bones
were not broken like the others (John 19:33), a practice common with
Jewish victims because bodies should not hang after sundown (Deut
21:22, Wilson I 130), it also fulfils the requirements for a Paschal
Aleyin (Exod 12:46) and (Psalm 34:20). Although death often follows
by suffocation, there are contemporary records of crucified people
having been rescued (Wilson I 126). He was taken away as quickly as
possible (Mark 15:43) 'ointments and spices were prepared' (Luke
23:56). The disciples were 'scattered' and the women, including
Magdalen and the second Mary (Mark 15:47) were present and 'saw
how his body was laid' (Luke 23:56). A three-day 'burial' has been
proposed as part of the baptismal initiation rite (Wilson I 131). The
only shred of credibility to the bizarre doctrine of the 'resurrection of
the body' is the direct biological one - that the Passion was precisely
what it represents - a Dionysian sacred passion play.
Various authors have suggested that Jesus may have survived the
crucifixion. With varying degrees of credibility, Hugh Schonfield
(1965) and Barbara Thiering (1993) have suggested that he
recovered. Certain metabolic toxins are known to induce a death-like
state as exemplified by the Zombies and it has been suggested the
Essenes drugged him into a death-like coma. It is true that both the



heritage of Joseph's bloodstained coat and many of the Psalms of
David which from Crucifixion prophecies are tales of men who
suffered persecution and mortal danger, but survived. But in both
these cases they clearly lived on in their greatness and strength
physically. Jesus' resurrected visitations are so brief as to be easily
consistent with transient visionary experiences of his aggrieved
followers, fish-eating and wound-touching included.
Graves and Podro (1957) note two oblique references to the
possibility that Jesus survived the Crucifixion. One is Suetonius's
statement "The Jews, who were raising constant disturbances at the
instigation of Chrestus ['simple or good man', rather than 'anointed
one'] he [Claudius] drove from Rome." (38). However this name
stands of behalf of one of many groups of Jewish Zealots who sought
support from the Jews of the Diaspora (Schonfield 197). Another is a
comment in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 98a) to the effect that the messiah
sat at the gate of the 'Great city' (Rome) with the poor and sick (52).
There is also an apocryphal tomb of Yus Asaf in Kashmir also
associated with Yeshua (68).
The Qur'an also suggests the same thing 4.157 "And their saying:
Surely we have killed the Messiah, Isa son of Marium, the apostle of
Allah; and they did not kill him nor did they crucify him, but it
appeared to them so (like Isa) and most surely those who differ
therein are only in a doubt about it; they have no knowledge
respecting it, but only follow a conjecture, and they killed him not for
sure."
Magdalen is also associated with the Easter egg There is a story that
after the death of Jesus, Magdalene traveled to Rome
to complain to Tiberius about how Jesus' trial was conducted. She was
admitted and sat at his table. As she told him the story of Jesus, he
blurted out something like, "Jesus could no more be risen from the



dead than that egg you are holding could turn red!" Of course, she
held up the egg and it promptly turned red.

In the anointings by women rather than high priests there were
already signs of gender differences. These were pivotal to the
crucifixion itself, for in every case but one they precipitate the
betrayal.
In each of the gospels it was the women, and particularly Mary
Magdelene who were first to see the risen Christ, but as is typical of
the male disciples, they do not believe her. Mark 16:10 "And she went
and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen
of her, believed not." Likewise in Luke, the women are not believed
24:11 "And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they
believed them not." Such attitudes may find their source in the Essene
perspective of gender.
The initial group which gathers before Pentecost still contains the
women, although Peter in particular is clearly chauvanistic: Acts 1:13
"And when [the disciples were come in, they went up into an upper
room ... These all continued with one accord in prayer and
supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and



with his brethren. And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the
disciples, and omits the females: "Men and brethren, this scripture
must needs have been fulfilled".
This continues to the Pentecostal revelation, which is a prophecy
based on sons and daughters prophecying together: Acts 2:1 "And
when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one
accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as
of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were
sitting. ... And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to
speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. ... For
these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of
the day. But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 'And it
shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my
Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream
dreams: And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out
in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy'."
However from this early time on, both in the very next chapters of
Acts and in orthodox Christianity, women have been barred from their
place in the renewal and in the Church, ostensibly because they
represent the earthly principle of 'original sin' through which Eve's
wiles drew Adam into a 'life of death', despite Christ's redeeming act.
The gnostic Christians professed to carry the inner teaching of Jesus'
path of gnosis - direct experience. Some gnostic sects were also
notable for the equal status accorded to the genders. By 200 AD
Irenaeus was complaining that women were still celebrating the
Eucharist with the gnostic teacher Marcus.
Signs of a division are apparent in the Gospel of Thomas of the
tension between Peter representing the orthodox) and Mary
Magdelene (the gnostic): 114: Simon Peter said to them, "Let Mary



leave us, for women are not worthy of life." Jesus said, "I myself shall
lead her in order to make her male, so that she too may become a
living spirit resembling you males. For every woman who will make
herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven." This emphasis on
making male emphasizes the gnostic attitude that the physical being is
regarded as flawed or evil by comparison with the Kingdom of the
spirit, similar to the Manichaeans. However there was such complexity
within gnosticism that some gnostics believed rather in a female
principle of Sophia and regarded the Yahweh of the Garden as an
egotistical demiurge. Jesus also suggested Thomas "when the two are
made one" the Kingdom would come in an androgynous merging of
the genders.
It has even been suggested that such 'making male' of Magdalen has
occurred through redaction and that the Gospel of John which is
notably regard as the one gnostic biblical gospel of the four was
written by Mary Magdalen (Ramon K. Jusino). This would place the
'beloved disciple' as female rather than male intriguingly eliminating
the homosexual implication in a sacred marrige scenario. "The Fourth
Gospel was initially accepted earliest by 'heterodox' rather than
'orthodox' Christians. The oldest known commentary on the Fourth
Gospel is that of the Gnostic Heracleon (d. 180). ... Brown's research
reveals that there was a schism early in the history of the Johannine
Community. ... The majority of the community, whom Brown refers to
as the Secessionists, defended the community's high christology and
moved toward Docetism, Montanism, and Gnosticism (Brown 1979:
149). The rest of the community, whom Brown refers to as the
Apostolic Christians, were amalgamated into the emerging
institutional church. ... The originating group (50-80 AD) of the
community is led by Mary Magdalene. She is highly esteemed as the
primary witness to the Resurrection of Christ. She is recognized as
such even by believers who do not belong to this particular



community. She is known, very early on, as the companion of Jesus"
Later (c 90-100 AD) "The claim that a female disciple of Jesus had
been their community's first leader and hero quickly becomes an
embarrassment. ... A redactor in this community reworks their Gospel
in order to make it consistent with this obscuration. The result of this
redaction is the canonical Fourth Gospel as we have it today."
The Dialogue of the Saviour, which like the Gospel of Thomas,
contains traditional sayings in archaic form and has a possible date of
origin in the first century. In the Dialogue are several passages which
emphasize the key role of Mary in terms of her depth of
understanding and revelation of his inner message: (53) Mary said
"Thus with respect to the wickedness of each day, and the labourer
deserves his food and the disciple resembles his teacher" And she said
this as one who had understood completely. (60) Mary said: "Tell me
Lord why have I come to this place, to profit or to forefit" The Lord
said "You make clear the abundance of the revealer!" (69) Mary said "I
want to understand all things just as they are". The Lord said "He who
will seek out life! For this is their wealth..." Whle the disciples are
asking what will be their heavenly garments and being told they will
become blessed when they strip themsleves, like the Albigenses did
later to their doom, Mary utters the truth of cosmic gnosis "There is
but one saying I will speak to the Lord concerning the mystery of
truth: In this we have taken our stand and to the cosmic we are
transparent" (Robinson 252-3).
The tension between Mary and Peter continues in the later Gospel of
Mary: Peter said to Mary, "Sister, we know that the Savior loved you
more than the rest of women. Tell us the words of the Savior which
you remember - which you know (but) we do not, nor have we heard
them." Mary answered and said, "What is hidden from you I will
proclaim to you." And she began to speak to them ...expounding the
gnostic aeons. When Mary had said this, she fell silent, since it was to



this point that the Savior had spoken with her. But Andrew answered
and said to the brethren, "Say what you (wish to) say about what she
has said. I at least do not believe that the Savior said this. For
certainly these teachings are strange ideas." Peter answered and spoke
concerning these same things. He questioned them about the Savior:
"Did he really speak with a woman without our knowledge (and) not
openly? Are we to turn about and all listen to her? Did he prefer her
to us?" Then Mary wept and said to Peter, "My brother Peter, what do
you think? Do you think that I thought this up myself in my heart, or
that I am lying about the Savior?" Levi answered and said to Peter,
"Peter, you have always been hot-tempered. Now I see you contending
against the woman like the adversaries. But if the Savior made her
worthy, who are you indeed to reject her? Surely the Savior knows her
' very well. That is why he loved her more" than us (Robinson 524).
In the Gospel of Philip, Magdalene is called Christ's 'companion' (Gk
koinonos partner) the most important of the three women "who were
always with the Lord". "But Christ loved her more than all the
disciples and used to kiss her often on the mouth. ... They said to him,
why do you lover her more than all of us? ... Jesus said when the light
comes, he who sees will see the light, but he who is blind will remain
in darkness'" (Robinson 148, Haskells 40).
In the Pistis Sophia Mary likewise warns "Peter makes me hesitate, I
am afraid of him because he hates the female race (Walker 791,
Haskins 42). When she asks him if she may speak in boldness Jesus
replies: "Mariham Mariham, the happy, this shall I complete in all the
mysteries of ... the Height. Speak in boldness because thou art she
whose heart straineth toward the Kingdom of the heavens more than
all thy brothers." When she says she has comprehended every word,
he wonders at her because she has become spirit quite pure, assigning
to her a key place in the Millennium (Haskins 50-1).



In Christine de Pisan's (1364-1420) book of the City of Ladies, she
rightly extols Magdalen: "If women's language had been so
blameworthy and of such small authority, as some men argue, our
Lord Jesus Christ would never have deigned to wish that so worthy a
mystery as His most gracious resurrection be first announced by a
woman, just as He commanded the blessed Magdalene, to whom He
first appeared on Easter day, to report and announce it to His apostles
and Peter. ... I smile at the folly which some men have expressed and I
even remember that I heard some foolish preachers teach that God
first appeared to a woman because He knew well that she did not
know how to keep quiet and so this was the way the news of His
resurrection would be spread more rapidly." (Haskins 155)
And how hit is thanne of wymmen that we blameth ham so
In songs and in rymes; and in bokes eke thereto
To segge segge that they false be and vuele to leove, ffykel and ...
untrue?
More mildness and goodness is not many creature on earth
as we may see by Mary Maudelyn - Southern Passion (Haskins 156)
The Last Temptation of Christ: Mary Magdalene portrayed as the
adultress of John (Scorsee).
The dream of the Last Temptation of Christ puts the dilemma of the
Kingdom into proper perspective, for it is the physical continuity of
sex and procreation that we find the embodiment of immortality.



Magdalene: "Rabbi, why do you talk to me about the future life? We
are not men to have need of another, an eternal life, we are women,
and for us one moment with the man we love is everlasting Paradise,
one moment far from the man we love is everlasting hell. It is here on
this earth that we women live out eternity" (Haskins 369).
It was originally Magdalen and not the virgin mother who was the
central figure in the church. The elevation of the virgin comes from a
strange alliance between the gnostic Manichaean rejection of sexuality
and its absorbtion by Christian orthodoxy, despite their opposition.
Irenaeus and Augustine illustrate this process well.
The Prophecy of the Synchronistic Christos
Frazer (1890 v7 420) 'ventures to urge in favour' of the Crucifixion
having been a sacrificial rite of the sacred king of fertility in the style
of the Sacaea as a causative factor in the remarkably rapid diffusion of
Christianity in Asia Minor, noting Trajan's comments that in formerly
pagan areas, multitudes of all genders, ages and ranks professed its
tennets - "the temples were almost deserted, the sacred rites of the
public religion discontinued , and hardly a purchaser could be found
for the sacrificial victims. ... We have seen that the dying and risen
god was no new one in these regions. ... All over Western Asia from
time immemorial, the mournful death and happy resurrection of a
divine being appear to have been annually celebrated in alternate rites
of bitter lamentation and exhaultant joy; and though the veil of
mythic fancy has woven around this tragic figure we can still detect
the features of those great yearly changes in earth and sky which,
under all distinctions of race and religion, must always touch the
natural human heart with alternate emotions of gladness and regret,
because they exhibit on the vastest scale open to our observation the
mysterious struggle between life and death."



"A chain of causes which, because we cannot follow them, might in
the loose language of daily life be called an accident, determined that
that part of the dying god in this annual play should be thrust on
Jesus of Nazareth, whom the enemies he had made in high places by
his outspoken strictures were resolved to put out of the way, but the
very step ... contributed more than anything they could have done to
scatter them broadcast, not only over Judea but over Asia, for it
impressed upon what had been hitherto mainly an ethical mission, the
character of a divine revelation culminating in the passion and death
of the incarnate son of a heavenly father. It shed round the cross on
Calvary a halo of divinity which multitudes saw and worshipped afar
off; the blow struck on Golgotha set a thousand expectant strings
vibrating in unison whenever men had heard of the old, old story of
the dying and risen god. Every year, as another spring bloomed and
another autumn faded across the earth, the field had been ploughed
and sown and borne fruit of all kind until it received the seed which
was destined to spring up and overshadow the world" (Frazer 1890 v7
420) .
"In the great army of martyrs who in many ages and in many lands ...
have died a cruel death in the character of the gods, the devout
Christian will doubtless discern types and forerunners of the coming
saviour - stars that heralded in the morning sky the advent of the Sun
of righteousness - earthen vessels wherein it pleased the divine
wisdom to set before hungering souls the bread of heaven. The sceptic
on the other hand, with equal confidence, will reduce Jesus of
Nazareth to the level of a multitude of other victims of a barbarous
superstition and will see in him no more than a moral teacher, whom
the fortunate accident of his execution invested with the crown, not
merely of a martyr, but of a god. The divergence between these views
is wide and deep. Which of them is the truer and will in the end
prevail? Time will decide the question of prevalence, if not truth. Yet



we would fain believe that in this and in all things the old maxim will
hold good - Magna est veritas et praevalebit - 'Great is truth and it
shall prevail'. (Frazer 1890 v7 422).
A Noel for Dumuzzi
The holly and the ivy, when they are both full-grown,
of all the trees which are in the wood, the holly bears the crown.
The Yule log or Christ log was anointed with oil, as was the simple log
which often constituted the image of Tammuz in ancient rites, and
solemnly burned often with a food offering of all the food and drink
the share of Christ (Briffault 3/102). All other fires were extinguished
and the flame was believed to have magical qualities. Like their sisters
in Harran who lamented Ta'uz, no bread was baked nor spinning nor
weaving done until twelfth night, although a loaf of bread was laid
throughout this period for the Holy Virgin. The table cloth was kept to
be used as a sack for seeds at sewing time.
Rejoice O Noel Log'
for tomorrow is the day of bread,
Let all good things enter hither,
Let women bear children,
Let goats kid,
Let the ewes lamb,
Let there be much corn and much bread,
And of wine a vat full.
11.17 The Adonis of Easter
Gardens of Adonis are still prepared as Easter offerings to Christ in
Sicily and placed on sepulchres, which with the effigies of the dead
Christ are made up in Catholic and Greek churches on Good Friday
(Frazer 1890 5/253).



Fig 11.27: Sicilian Easter Christ (National Geographic)
The Catholic Church has been accustomed to bring
before its followers in a visible form the death and
resurrection of the Redeemer. The solemnities observed
in Sicily on Good Friday, the official anniversary of the
Crucifixion, are thus described by a native Sicilian
writer. " A truly moving ceremony is the procession
which always takes. place in the evening in every commune of Sicily,
and further the Deposition from the Cross. The brotherhoods took part
in the procession, and the rear was brought up by a great many boys
and girls representing saints, both male and female, and carrying the
emblems of Christ's Passion. The Deposition from the Cross was
managed by the priests. The coffin with the dead Christ in it was
flanked by Jews armed with swords, an object of horror and aversion
in the midst of the profound pity excited by the sight not only of
Christ but of the Mater Dolorosa, who followed behind him. Now and
then the 'mysteries', or symbols of the Crucifixion went in front.
Sometimes the procession followed the 'three hours of agony' and the
'Deposition from the Cross.' The 'three hours' commemorated those
which Jesus Christ passed upon the Cross. Beginning at the eighteenth
and ending at the twenty-first hour of Italian time two priests
preached alternately on the Passion. Anciently the sermons were
dclivered in the open air on the place called the Calvary: at last, when
the third hour was about to strike, at the words emisit spiritum Christ
died, bowing his head amid the sobs and tears of the bystanders.
Immediately afterwards it, some places, three hours afterwards in
others, the sacred body was unnailed and deposited in the coffin. In
Castronuovo, at the Ave Maria, two priests clad as Jews, representing
Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, with their servants in costume,
repaired to the Calvary, preceded by the Company of the Whites.
There, with doleful verses and chants appropriate to the occasion,



they performed the various operations of the Deposition, after which
the procession took its way to the larger church. ... Christ is removed
from the Cross and deposited in the-coffin by three priests. After the
procession of the dead Christ, two priests lay Christ in a fictitious
sepulchre, from which at the mass of Easter Saturday the image of the
risen Christ issues and is elevated upon the altar sometimes by means
of machinery."(Frazer 1890 5/255).
Nor are these Sicilian and Calabrian customs the only Easter
ceremonies which resemble the rites of Adonis, During the whole of
Good Friday a waxen effigy of the dead Christ is exposed to view in
the middle of the Greek churches and is covered with fervent kisses by
the thronging crowd, while the whole church rings with melancholy,
monotonous dirges. Late in the evening, when it has grown quite
dark, this waxen image is carried by the priests into the street on a
bier adorned with lemons, roses, jessamine, and other flowers, and
there begins a grand procession of the multitude, who move in serried
ranks, with slow and solemn step, through the whole town. Every man
carries his taper and breaks out into doleful lamentation. At all the
houses which the procession passes there are seated women with
censers to fumigate the marching host. Thus the community solemnly
buries its Christ as if he had just died. At last the waxen image is again
deposited in the church, and the same lugubrious chants echo anew.
These lamentations, accompanied by a strict fast, continue till
midnight on Saturday. As the clock strikes twelve, the bishop appears
and announces the glad tidings that 'Christ is risen,' to which the
crowd replies, 'He is risen indeed,' and at once the whole city bursts
into an uproar of joy, which finds vent in shrieks and shouts, in the
endless discharge of cannonades and muskets, and the explosion of
fireworks of every sort. In the very same hour people plunge from the
extremity of the fast into the enjoyment of the Easter lamb and neat
wine."(Frazer 1890 5/254).



Fig 11.28: Pieta Gerard David (Benard)
When we reflect how often the Church has skilfully
contrived to plant the seeds of the new faith on the old
stock of paganism, we may surmise that the Easter
celebration of the dead and risen Christ was grafted
upon a similar celebration of the dead and risen
Adonis, which, as we have seen reason to believe, was
celebrated in Syria at the same season. The type, created by Greek
artists, of the sorrowful goddess with her dying lover in her arms,
resembles and may have been the model for the pieta of Christian art
(Frazer 1890 5/255).
11.22 A Shrine to Ernest and Henriette Renan
Ernest Renan's Vie de Jesus (1863) was the first biography of Jesus to
present him as entirely human and thus to take him down from the
cross, suspended between earth and heaven, sympathetically to our
level. Ironically, while writing this work, his sister died beside him in a
fever in country overlooking the river of Adonis.
Shortly before the issue of his most popular work, Renan had obtained
the chair of Hebrew and Semitic languages at the University of Paris.
His inaugural lecture climaxed with interruption when he referred to
Jesus as "a man so great that ... I should not wish to contradict those
who, impressed by the unique character of his movement call him
God". Four days later, Renan was suspended from his professorial
duties. The publication of Vie de Jesus prevented his reinstatement.
He had at first set out to enter the Catholic priesthood but, on the
basis of critical study of the Bible, came to realize he could not
continue. Despite disuassion from his instructors, he left, encouraged
by the support of his sister Henriette's 500 francs. She had lost all
religious belief long before, but had not discouraged his own piety.



She accompanied him to Lebanon on his archaeological exploits and
intimately shared his first draft of Vie de Jesus. Although not religious,
their relationship was certainly spiritual, as her obituary shows:
"Silent at my side thou dids't read and copy each sheet as soon as I
had written it, while the sea, the ravines and the mountains were
spread at our feet. When the overwhelming light had given place to
the innumerable army of stars, thy shrewd and subtle questions, thy
discrete doubts, led me back to the sublime object of our common
thoughts. ... In the midst of these sweet meditations the angel of death
struck us both with his wing the sleep of fever seized us ... I awoke
alone! ... Thou sleepest now in the land of Adonis, near the holy
Byblus and the sacred stream where the women of the ancient
mysteries came to mingle their tears. Reveal to me, O good genius, to
me whom thou lovedst, those truths which conquer death, deprive it
