" It should be noted that the custom of burning birds and animals in the presence of kings, Zoroastrianism is based on not Zoroastrian fire because he was very dear As far as the Zoroastrian religion in all books about the order to fire it was clean and not contaminated In the Avesta, the Gathas stated: ".... Mazda is a curse to those who love the wind in their education to make people turn away from good deeds And those animals are sacrificed with joyful shouting.

But among the reasons given in the tenth of February Sadeh Occurred in the last day of the big dog And the cold weather this month, On the occasion of celebrating the advent of fire, Given the important role that fire has on human life, It seems more Also given the assignment to two Nowruz and Mehregan and Fereydoon Jamshid, Houshang assigned to this holiday does not seem unlikely. Given that most of the ancient Zoroastrians have lived in Kerman, So in the eighty years since the last century as the cradle of And every year where people are held Shkvhtryn Sadeh. After the Islamic Revolution and the Zoroastrians migrated to Tehran, Every year this celebration in Tehran, Karaj Special Road Pavilion Varjavand located 16 kilometers will be held. Mahmoud Amini's is that the people of Kerman, About the centenary celebrations in Kerman said: "Kermani this more gracefully than other areas hold the festival. Kerman is still drawing fire from the ashes of the farmers on their land blow, Century ashes to ground fire because they believe it will bless. " (Amini's, 1996, p 123) The celebration of the centenary in style at different periods, this can be realized Kharv collect firewood and shavings for inflaming centuries was not alone And cooperation in this matter was considered from the religious imperatives And behavior associated with reward was So everyone brings to the size competence firewood and wood dust In the last century and a handful of ashes to mark the end of winter to take their field And people were convinced that heat in the evening star sends greetings to the ground.
Sadeh in the Khorasani style poets

Manouchehri: Manouchehri Damghani including the poets and gala Christmas themes and get drunk and upset at her poems frequently seen. (Manouchehri, 2006, p 30) He also celebrated a century of tradition and Esfandiar Kiomars knows and refers to the fire on this day: onsori:
In many poems and poets to his generosity and liberality of kings are mentioned in the celebrations. Din and his generosity in praise of the element Nsrbn Amir Sadeh says this: (Elemental, 1970, pp. 46 45) Sultan Mahmoud Ghaznavi in praise of the one element that is Qsaydsh Sadeh fire to this day in February, and cites Gbran and fire worshipers celebrate it knows And it seems that the Sultan Mahmoud has refused to go to this party: As can be seen Background element, and Fereidoon brought this feast to Jamshid. He praised the century, Beauty metaphorical and religious elements of Islam into the literature and our culture, Because the Mount, the manifestation of light, heaven, spiritual and bright, and the fire of Nimrod has resorted Shrar Used to describe these elements in his party element called "Gbrkan" has not had any problems; But the poet in praise of Sultan Mahmoud Ghaznavi in an ode At about the same Sadeh had this to say: Ferdowsi:
The Shahnameh of Ferdowsi repeat Sadeh And other festivities especially Norouz and Mehregan is named Shahnameh and also the generosity of kings mentioned in the celebrations. After the praise and worship God Lorasib he sat on the throne, Then make acts for the centenary celebrations. It is precisely in these lines indicate Fire in the sanctification of the ancient Persians, Monotheism and belief, they do not conflict with the Creator Fire, but they also knew the Lord created And because it began to praise. Farokhi:
Farrokhi greeting Sadeh fire to draw the party cites This proves that greatness is celebrated: Farokhi time to celebrate the centenary of fifty days before Nowrooz celebration And it is considered promising the coming of spring: In celebration of the centenary celebrations also like to mention is drawing spree In the following verses in praise of Khwaja Abul Hasan is expressing this: His poems celebrate the centenary of the evangelic the coming New Year and it's income and Introduction to the New Year is known Farokhi of Qsaydsh, Sadeh, which has coincided with Muharram Congratulations to Stan M.

welfare of its existence knew the fire. So it unduly pollute as More elebrations were in fire, Not incompatible with monotheism Iranians celebrate fire after There exist because God knew it manifested. We celebrate the centenary of the studies about The festival is a celebration of the fire Is a national celebration and not connected to any one of the races or religions of ancient And the true inheritor not only Sadeh Zoroastrians, But all are free,The celebration of the Mughal period and to have held up well. In Ferdowsi's "Shahnameh" to celebrate the centenary of the Nowruz Nameh, Khayyam Houshang and it does the Center And the outer Aboureihan, Being an official holiday at the time of Ardeshir Babakan knows. In the book "Altvarykh inconclusive" to the most famous and largest Sadeh Mrdavyj mentioned in Ziarat. Starter cultures decisive proof, clear Kiomars holiday, the man knows his father. Fire symbolizes good and blessing Navideh marks and welfare is It shows the contrast between the Genesis story of God and evil in Shahnameh Hooshang Against each other in the end God will triumph over evil The light will overcome darkness. This story appeared in the snake is the symbol of darkness and light the fire escapes. This suggests that the Zoroastrian faith is based on duality, Although Zoroastrians believe that the duality of the two elements have been light and darkness, But precisely at this point we realized the depth of their beliefs They also have a duality that is rooted in monotheism Because they believed were These two elements, namely light and darkness as the sole creator is imperative It is the Creator God who is Creator of all good and bad. His generosity and munificence of kings and assist subordinates in Sadeh, One of the characteristics of this celebration. Other properties can be used to create a sense of Sadeh cooperation among people in this day pointed out Because dust and dirt collect wood for the fire Vigil century was not alone All people in this together helped It was considered that the cooperation of religious imperatives And was a reward hereafter.
