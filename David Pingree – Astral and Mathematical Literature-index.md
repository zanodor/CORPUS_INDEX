INTRODUCTION
Traditionally jyotihsdstra is divided into three skandhas:satnhitd (omens), ganita (astronomy), and hord (astrology) (see BS 1, 9); and, according to the medieval muhurta treatises, was originally promulgated by the eighteen sages Brahmacarya, Vasistha, Atri, Manu, Paulastya, RomaSa, Marici, Angiras, Vyasa, Narada, Saunaka, Bhrgu, Cyavana, Yavana, Garga, Kasyapa, Parasara, and Surya. The validity of the first tradition was maintained only by artificially including new forms of scientific writing—e.g., treatises on mathematics, on muhurta, or on pradna—in one or another of the three skandhas, while there was never any validity to the second. In this volume an attempt has been made to establish a more accurate classification of the areas of jyotihsdstra actually made the subject of independent works, and to survey the literature in each area (but omitting the sectarian Jaina contributions) in order to establish a correct historical origin (often from outside of India) and development of each. To have included discussions of the technical aspects of these sciences, however, would both have duplicated much that has already been done (though in some areas it desperately needs to be done better) and have extended the length of this volume far beyond reasonable bounds. Nor has any attempt been made to deal with the literary qualities of the works discussed. The primary texts are certainly all in metrical form, but are generally written in a very crabbed and obscure style designed to stimulate the student's memory of the procedures to be followed, but frequently not even pretending to provide the full algorithm for solving a particular problem; that was to be found, if not in the repetitiousness of the science, in the guru's oral tradition or in the prose commentary. Thus, while cleverness and imprecision both abound in this poetry, the normal canons of alankdraare simply not applicable; only rarely, as in the rtuvarnanain Bhaskara's S&B, is any poetic feeling made manifest. Two of the difficulties generated by the use of a poetic form were the necessity of expressing numbers metrically, and the difficulty of maintaining a fixed technical vocabulary. The latter impediment led to the invention of many synonyms, and the use of single terms in several different, if related, senses; this, of course, increased the ambiguity and imprecision inherent in a system where the texts' purpose is to jog the memory rather than to teach the complete course. The former problem was solved in two ways: by using common objects that appear or are understood to appear in the world in fixed quantities as synonyms for those quantities (e.g., "eyes" are "two," "fires" are "three," "Vedas" are "four"), and by using aksarasto refer to numbers. The former system, called the bhutasankhyd, already appears in the third century in Sphujidhvaja's Yavanajataka. Sphujidhvaja also seems to be the

first to use a symbol for zero (bindu) in the decimal place-value system (YJ 79, 6 and 7), though, of course, a dot or a circle had been, used previously by both Babylonians and Greeks in the sexagesimal place-value system to represent a place with no other number in it. Aryabhata invented a different way of expressing numerals, in which the consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet are used to indicate the numbers and the vowels their places (up to eighteen); unfortunately, the "words" formed thus were often unpronounceable and in any case had no meaning other than the numerical one. A different system was invented in South India that obviated this difficulty. The Jcatapayddi system (in which k, t, p, and y equal 1 regardless of the vowel they are followed by) uses the consonants as equivalents of the numbers 1 to 9 and 0; four varieties of this system are known. A clever jyotisl, then, can construct verses that are superficially on one subject while each sequence of consonants can be read as a significant number; a good example of this is Paramesvara's Haricarita. The following pages will show that our knowledge of Indian jyotihsdstra is rather spotty. This is due both to the accidents that cause the preservation (and availability) of one text rather than another, and to the lack of reliable and accurate descriptions of the many unpublished manuscripts. The second disability is being slowly alleviated as CESS progresses; I have generally referred the reader to it, when available, for information about an author, his works, and what modern scholars may have said about them, though I have attempted in all cases to give reasonably complete listings of published editions as they are a useful guide to modern interests. Those modern interests lie overwhelmingly in jdtaka, tdjika, muhurta, prasna, and various forms of divination; classical astronomy and mathematics had virtually ceased to be studied or taught by the end of the nineteenth century. A new group of Indian and foreign scholars has, however, begun to work in these areas since World War II; and, while much is still unfortunately published that is of little or no value, some progress toward an understanding of the origins and developments of these sciences has been made. I hope that this volume will stimulate more serious interest in this field.



CHAPTER I
SULBAStfTRAS
In the performance of Vedic srauta rituals an essential prerequisite is the piling up of the fire altar (agnicayana). These altars (citis) take the form of various objects; the forms mentioned in Taittirryasamhita 5, 4, 11 (after the chandasciti1 or "meter altar") and the sacrificers who should erect them are:
1. 4yenaciti or "hawk altar"2 by one desiring heaven (suvarga); 2. kankaciti or "heron altar" by one desiring a head in the other world; 3. alajacitior "alaja-hirdaltar" with four furrows by one desiring support; 4. praiigaciti or "triangle altar" by one desiring to repel his foes; 5. ubhayatah praiigaciti or "triangle on both sides altar" by one desiring to repel both present and future foes; 6. rathacakraciti or "chariot-wheel altar" by one wishing to defeat his foes; 7. dronaciti or "trough altar" by one desiring food; 8. samuhyaciti3or "things to be gathered together altar" by one desiring cattle; 9. paricdyyaciti* or "circle altar" by one desiring a village; 10. dniasdnaciti* or "cemetery altar" by one desiring the world of the fathers (pitrloka).
A few other altar-shapes are described in other Brahmanas, where also are prescribed the rituals to be performed at these altars. The Srautasutras belonging to the Yajurveda often include as appendices treatises that give rules concerning the geometry involved in the construction of these altars. These treatises are known as the Sulbasutras.5

The Srautasutras containing Sulbasutras are those of Baudhayana,6 in which the &ulbasutra is prasna 30;7 of Apastamba,8 in which the Sulbasutra is also prasna 30;9 of Vadhula,10 whose Sulbasutra is said to survive in a manuscript at Madras;11 of Manava,12 in which the Sulbasutra is adhyaya 1013 (a recension of this is entitled the Maitrayaniyasulbasutra14); of Varaha,15 whose &ulbasutra survives in a manuscript at Mysore;16 and of Katyayana,17 in which the &ulbasutra is parisista 7.18 The last of these belongs to the Suklayajurveda (the Vajasaneyisamhita), the first five to the Krsnayajurveda (Baudhayana, Apastamba, and Vadhula to the Taittirlyasamhita, and Manava and Varaha to the Maitrayanlyasamhita). Precise dating of any of these texts is impossible. The earliest, that of Baudhayana, was perhaps written before 500 B.C.,and the remainder presumably antedate the Christian era. It was, indeed, during this period also, probably in the second century B.C., that the most striking syenaciti of which remains survive was built in Kausambi.19 The Apastamba appears to be the second oldest of the major Sulbasutras, and the Katyayana, which consists of

Sulbasutras 5
a sutra section (to a large extent repeating sutrasofthe Apastamba verbatim), followed by a verse section, is among thelatest; theManava hasapparently copied some verses from the Katyayana. Each of the basic altars must be constructed with five layers of bricks, and there must bea fixed number of bricks in each layer; moreover, thebricks in the second and fourth layers must not bedirectly above or below those in the first, third, andfifth layers. And thesurface covered by thealtar, regardless of its shape, must cover an area of seven and one half square purusas or, for certain purposes, that area increased byspecified numbers of square purusas, or it must bemultiplied bya given factor. Finally, the altar must becorrectly oriented with respect to the cardinal directions. The task faced bythe authors of the Sulbasutras was to prescribe rules for laying outthese altars with only a rope (rajju or sulba) of determined length and posts or gnomons (sanku).20 The geometrical problems that were solved bythese altar-builders areindeed impressive, but it would be a mistake to see intheir works the unique origin of geometry;21 others in India and elsewhere, whether in response to practical or theoretical problems, may well have advanced as far without their solutions having been committed to memory or eventually transcribed in manuscripts. The solutions utilized bythe sutrakaras involve the knowledge of a number of specific right-angled triangles (e.g., 3, 4, 5; 5, 12,13; 7, 24,25; 8, 15, 17; 12, 35, 37; and15, 36, 39)as well as thegeneral rule that thesquare on the diagonal of a rectangle (square or oblong) is equal to thesum of the squares on two sides; ofthe approximation

and theradius, r, of a circle whose area is approximately equal to a square of side x:
They also give particular solutions to certain indeterminate equations, though without any hint at the method bywhich they arrived at them.22 The Baudhayanasulbasutra inthe edition by Prakash and Sharman contains ten adhydyasdivided into 21 Jchandas (4,3, 2, and6 Jchandas in the first four

adhydyas respectively, 1 khanda in each of the remaining six adhydyas); these correspond to three adhydyas in Thibaut's edition:
Thibaut Prakash and Sharman
adhydya 1 adhydya 1 = khandas 1—4. adhydya 2 adhydya 2 = khandas 5—7. adhydya 3 adhydyas 3—10 = khandas 8—21.
The total number of sutras is 519. The work begins with definitions of the measures used in the constructions and the geometrical propositions employed in designing them; there follows a description of the spatial relations in different altars; and finally there come the rules for constructing the gdrhapatyaciti and chandadciti (kJianda 7), the syenacit (khandas 8—9), the vakrapaksa vyastapuccha (khandas 10—11), the kankacit (khanda 12), the ajalacit (khanda 13), the prailgacit (khanda 14), the ubhayatah praiiga (khanda 15), the rathacakracit (khanda 16), the dronacit (khandas 17—18), the smasdnacit (khanda 19), and the kurmacit (khandas 20—21). The Baudhayana was commented on by Dvarakanatha Yajvan,23 whose Sulbadlpika was composed after Aryabhata, and by VenkatesVara Diksita, who Avrote his Sulbamimamsa in the Vijayanagara kingdom in about 1600. The Apastamba, which is divided into six patalas and twenty-one adhydyas (3 adhydyas in patalas 1, 3, and 5, 4 in patalas 2, 4, and 6), presents essentially the same material as does the Baudhayana, though with fewer variations on the basic forms of the altars, in 223 sutras. It was commented on by Kapardisvamin,24 who apparently lived before 1150 (Kapardibhasya); by Karavindasvamin,25 who has followed Kapardisvamin (Sulbapradipika) and quotes from the Aryabhatiya; by Gopala26 (Rahasyaprakasa); and by Sundararaja, the famous Kerala astronomer of the end of the fifteenth century (Sundararajiya). The first section of the Katyayana, which consists of ninety sutras, is divided into six kandikds. It teaches, in language often identical with or similar to the Apastamba's, the geometrical propositions (including the first detailed instructions for determining the cardinal directions from the shadows cast by a gnomon), the measures employed in constructing the altars, and their spatial relationships. The second section, which consists of more than 40 verses, repeats some of the material given in the sutra section, and adds to it descriptions of the rope, the gnomon, and the expert builder of altars. There are commentaries on the Katyayana by Karka,27 who wrote before 1260/1270 (Karkabhasya); by Rama Vajapeyin, who composed three of them28 (the Sulbavarttika, a metrical gloss

on the Katyayana and on the Karkabhasya, in 1434; the Sulbavarttikatika, a commentary on the preceding; and the Sulbasutravrtti, a prose commentary based on the Sulbavarttika) at Naimisa in Uttarapradesa; and by Mahidhara29 at VaranasI in 1590 (Sulbasutravivarana). Finally, the Manava, which is divided into seven khandas, describes the rope and the gnomon, the measures, the spatial relations of altars, the sacrificial fees, and the method of constructing the suparnaciti. The closely related Maitrayaniya, which is divided into four khandas,arranges this material in a different fashion. The Manava was commented on by Sivadasa at VaranasI, the Maitrayaniya by his younger brother, Sankarabhatta; the two brothers both quote from Rama Vajapeyin, and therefore lived after 1450.

CHAPTER II
ASTRONOMY1
Many Vedic sacrifices are to be performed at specific times determined by the position of the Sun relative to its northern (uttardyana) or southern (daksindyana) path, the synodic month and the night within it, or the position of the Moon with respect to the naksatras. The first attempt in India to describe the motions of the Sun and the Moon relative to the ayanas, the naksatras, and each other was the Jyotisavedanga composed by Lagadha. He clearly states his purpose (JV Rk 36; repeated at the end of Paitamahasiddhanta 9, 8):
For the Vedas have come forth for the sake of sacrifice, and sacrifices are established in the orderly succession of times. Therefore, he who knows this jyautisa, the science of determining times, knows the sacrifices.
This purpose shifted somewhat later on when it was no longer as important to decide when Vedic sacrifices should take place as it was to fix the proper moments (muhurta) for performing the samskdras and to compute the calendar (pancdnga) which indicated festivals, auspicious and inauspicious times (tithis, yogas, or karanas), entries of the Sun into zodiacal signs (sankrdntis ) , eclipses (grahanas), and the like. Another motive for the development of astronomy in India, at least after the second century A.D., was the need to compute with reasonable accuracy the positions of the planets for the purpose of casting horoscopes. And a final goal of the astronomers, though only to a slight degree realized, was the application of this science to geographical problems. Such practical aims, of course, must often have been secondary to individuals whose primary motivation was intellectual curiosity. The history of Indian astronomy can be divided into five main periods, depending in most cases on the foreign origin:
1. Vedic (ca. 1000 B.C.-^OO B.C.), in which some of the basic Indian calendaric terms were introduced,2 but in which only a crude and rudimentary mathematical structure is evident. As there is no astronomical literature as such from this period it shall not be considered further in this book. 2. Babylonian (ca. 400 B.C.-200 A.D.).
1 A detailed survey of this field is given in D. PINGREE, "History of Mathe
matical Astronomy in India," DSB, vol. 15, New York 1978, pp. 533—633 (hence
forth cited as "History").
2 "History," pp. 534—536.



Astronomy 9
3. Greco-Babylonian (ca. 200-400). 4. Greek (ca. 400-1600). 5. Islamic (ca. 1600-1800).
Though the fundamental approach and many ofthe models and parameters of each period were determined by the foreign sources, the basic traditionsof Indian astronomy imposed onthese external systems its peculiar stamp, and transformed the science ofMesopotamia, Greece, or Iran into something unique to India.
Babylonian3
The literature on astronomy inSanskrit isheaded by the Jyotisavedanga, which has come down tous intwo recensions: that ofthe Rgveda in36verses, ascribed toLagadha (or toSuci following Lagadha), and that ofthe Yajurveda in 43 or45 verses, ofwhich 29 occur also inthe Rgveda recension.4 The earlier of these two recensions isclearly theshorter, that of the Rgveda, as it alone preserved the original period relation ofLagadha's intercalation cycle:
5 solar years = 1830sidereal days = 62 synodic months = 1860 tiihis (JV, Rk 32 = Yajus 5; Rk 4 = Yajus 13; Rk 18= Yajus 39; Rk 8= Yajus 9; and Rk12 = Yajus 27).5
The Yajus hasintroduced twoverses (28—29) that misinterpret this relation by taking the366 sidereal days (=365 civil days) in each year to bethemselves civil days.
3 "History," pp. 536—538. 4 The Yajus recension with variants from the Rk and the generally unrewarding commentary by Somakara &esanaga was edited by A. WEBER, tiber den Vedakalender Namens Jyotisham, Berlin 1862; the text of the Yajus recension along with the non-Yajus verses of the Rk recension were edited by G. THIBATJT, "Contributions to the Explanation of the Jyotisha-Vedanga," JAS Bengal 46 (1877), 411—437; the Rk recension with a MarathI translation was published by J. B. MODAKA of Thana in 1885; both recensions were edited and commented on by BARHASPATYA (LALA CHOTELAX) in the Hindustan Review for 1907 (reprinted Allahabad, 1960) and again, with Somakara's Bhasya on the Yajus, by S. DVIVEDIN (Benares, 1908). The Yajus recension was published with his own Sanskrit commentary and an English version by R. SHAMASASTRY (Mysore, 1936). 5 The fundamental interpretation of the JV is D. PINGR.EE, "The Mesopotamian Origin of Early Indian Mathematical Astronomy," JHA 4, 1973, 1—12. It has recently been most unconvincingly argued that the two Mesopotamian instruments for measuring time used in this period—the outflowing water-clock (ghatika) and the gnomon (&anku)—were indigenous to India; see S. S. LISHK and S. D. SHARMA, "Season Determination through the Science of Sciatherics in Jaina School of Astronomy," IJHS 12 (1977), 33—44, and "Length of theDay in Jaina Astronomv," Centaurus 22 (1978), 165-176.



10 David Pingree • Jyotihsastra
The age of Lagadha's work can be fixed from the following considerations. Its language is post-Vedic, and it imitates Pingala's Chandahsutra in using the final or first syllables of the names of the naksatras as their designations;6 its period relation is copied in the oldest Paitamahasiddhanta, whose epoch is 11 January 80 ;7 and its astronomy reflects that of Mesopotamia in the Achaemenid period. It is likely, therefore, that it was composed not very many years before or after 400 B.C., when the Achaemenids controlled Gandhara. Lagadha has retained the Vedic list of twenty-seven naksatras beginning with Krttika, but treats them not as constellations, but as measurements of arcs on the ecliptic of 13;20° each beginning with the vernal equinox. This adaptation means, of course, that the actual position of the equinoctial and solsticial colures with respect to the fixed stars can not be used for dating the JV. He introduced into Indian astronomy the Mesopotamian concepts of the possibility of describing mathematically the periodicity of celestial motions; their use of linear zig-zag functions to describe periodic deviations from the mean (Rk 7 = Yajus 8 and Rk 22 = Yajus 40); and their artificial time-unit, a thirtieth of a mean synodic month (named tithi in Sanskrit). He gives rules for computing the mean longitudes of the Sun and the Moon in terms oi naksatras, but mentions neither the planets nor the zodiacal signs. Other texts that reflect this level of astronomy are Kautilya's Arthasastra (2, 20) and the Buddhist Sardulakarnavadana (Divyavadana 33). The revised system of the Yajus recension is used in the Jaina Suriyapannatti and Camdapannatti and in the verses ascribed to Garga in Somakara's Bhasya.
Greco- Babylonian*
Planetary astronomy was introduced into India from Greece in conjunction with astrology as it was essential to possess some means of determining planetary positions in order to be able to cast horoscopes. The form of planetary astronomy originally transmitted represented Greek adaptations of the Babylonian astronomy of the Seleucid period; this was supplemented by other elements of early Greek astronomy, especially elements associated with Hipparchus.9 Some of the calendaric and other timekeeping conventions of the JV were also adopted by the practitioners of this type of astronomy in India. Two Sanskrit texts have preserved for us what remains of Greco-Babylonian astronomy in India. Sphujidhvaja (269/70) describes some aspects of it in the last chapter (79) of the Yavanajataka,10 a text based in large part on the

translation of a Greek text from Alexandria made by Yavanesvara in 149/150; Sphujidhvaja (YJ 79, 3) refers to a siddhdnta by Vasistha. Varahamihira in the sixth century summarized in his Pancasiddhantika11 a Vasisthasiddhanta whose epoch is 3 December 499 (PS 2; and, probably, 17, 1—60), a Romakasiddhanta (siddhdnta of the Romans) of the third or fourth century (PS 1, 9—10and 15; and 8), and a Paulisasiddhanta (siddhdnta of Paulus ?) of the same period (PS1, 11—13; 3; and 17, 64—80). The last twosiddhdntas were known to Varahamihira in recensions produced by Latadeva; his epoch for them was 21 March 505. The original version of the Romakasiddhanta was probably the one used by Bhaskara (629) in his Bhasya on A (pp. 183, 186 and 202). The Babylonian component of the astronomy expounded in these works is especially noticeable in the planetary theory which is based on the well known period relations for the planets, and the divisions of the synodic periods at the Greek-letter phenomena (YJ 79, 35—36, and PS 17), and in the elaborate lunar theory of the Vasisthasiddhanta (PS 2, 2—6) and the Paulisasiddhanta (PS3, 4—9). It would not have been possible to compute planetary positions with only the information in the texts as extant; their original forms were presumably more complete. The Hipparchan elements include the year-length 6,5;14,48 civil days (probably YJ 79, 34), which is combined with the Metonic cycle in the Romakasiddhanta (PS 1, 9—10and 15); values close to his maximum solar and one of his maximum lunar equations, also in the Romakasiddhanta (PS 8); and the use of analemmata to solve problems in spherical trigonometry in the Paulisasiddhanta (PS 3). Also from Hipparchus came the concept of the precession and trepidation of the equinoxes,12 and, most likely, the polar coordinate system for fixing the positions of the fixed stars and the value 3438 for the Radius in tables of Sines.13 This value of R first appears in India in the early fifth century (Pait. 3, 12); Varahamihira uses R = 120 (PS 4, 6-15). The other main topics dealt with in these texts, in so far as we know them, were the computations of lunar (PS 6: Paulisasiddhanta) and solar (PS 7: Paulisasiddhanta; and 8: Romakasiddhanta) eclipses. Both seem to reflect Hellenistic astronomy as it was influenced by Mesopotamia, though no extant Greek texts can be pointed to as sources. It is likely that the formulas for solving problems in spherical trigonometry and the analemmata that lie behind them in PS4 also were originally transmitted to India from the Roman Empire.

Greek1*
By the early fifth century when the Brahmapaksa began there had been introduced into India a more sophisticated form of Greek astronomy characterized by planetary models comprising the combination of an eccentric deferent with an epicycle (but without Ptolemy's equant or special model for Mercury), or a Peripatetic model with two independent epicycles whose centers are carried by a concentric deferent,15 or one in which each inequality is accounted for by a concentric circle with an equant.16 The inequalities in the motions of the Sun and the Moon are computed by means of an eccentric, a concentric deferent with an epicycle (the preferred model), or a concentric circle with an equant; in the earlier part of the Greek period Ptolemy's second lunar inequality was not known, though it was introduced into India from Islamic sources in the tenth century. As these geometric models of planetary motion based on the idea of the •circularity of their orbits were introduced into India, it became necessary to modify the traditional Indian cosmology as expressed in the Puranas and other texts. This was done by transforming the disc of Jambudvipa into a sphere and Meru into the terrestrial North Pole; along the equator at 90° distance from •each other lie Lanka on the prime meridian, Romakavisaya, Siddhapura, and Yamakoti; opposite Meru at the South Pole is Vadavamukha. The axis of the universe passes through Meru and Vadavamukha and the poles of the spheres of the planets and of the naksatras; the spheres of the planets rotate from West to East at a uniform velocity, driven by bonds of wind, while they and the sphere of the naksatras rotate diurnally from East to West. The deviations of the planets from their mean motions are caused by demons stationed at their manda (accounting for the equation of the center) and sighra (accounting for the equation of the anomaly) uccas pulling them towards themselves by cords of wind. The relative distance of each planet's sphere from the center of the system—that is, the center of the earth—can be computed by comparing their sidereal periods since they move equal spatial distances (but unequal angular distances) in equal times. Absolute values for planetary distances depend on the assumption of an arbitrary number of yojanas in the orbit of one of them (that of the Moon was normally chosen). In order to retain the Greek order of the planets in which the Sun is further distant from the earth than Venus, the Indians operated with the motion of Venus' (and then, by analogy, Mercury's) •ilghra; in Ptolemaic terms the sighra for an inferior planet is the sum of its (i.e., the Sun's) mean motion and its anomalistic motion. In order to compute the mean longitudes of the planets the Indians adapted the Greek idea of a "great year" which begins and ends with a mean planetary

conjunction to the already existing theory of the Kalpa.17 The choice of the subdivisions of the Kalpa (see Table 1) and of the number of rotations of each of the planets within it (see Table 2) are two of the main features that distinguish one paksa or school of astronomy from another, the others being the geometrical models for planetary motion and their parameters (see Table 3). It was demonstrated by R. Billard that the mean longitudes computed by the two systems of Aryabhata converge in accuracy on about 500, and this led him to suggest that Aryabhata founded Indian astronomy in the form which we have called "Greek" on the basis of his own extraordinarily precise observations.18 However, the same phenomenon is explained in a way that fits better into the known facts of the history of Indian astronomy: that "Greek" astronomy existed in India before Aryabhata; that the geometrical models solve problems faced by Greeks rather than by Indians, and must have been accompanied by means of computing mean longitudes when they were transmitted to India; and that all of the Indian evidence is against the theory of their being able to make accurate observations. This alternate explanation assumes that two procedures were used.19 One, utilized by the Brahmapaksa, consists of an expansion of Babylonian-type period relations to numbers of rotations of the planets in a Kalpa by assuming a fixed time between the beginning of the Kalpa and the beginning of the current Kaliyuga on 18 February — 3101, and a close proximity to a mean conjunction of the planets on the latter date. This problem results in a series of indeterminate equations that can be solved by the JcuttaJca. Aryabhata could have arrived at his surprising accuracy by using a reasonably accurate set of Greek astronomical tables to compute the mean longitudes of the planets on 21 March 499, and by assuming a true mean conjunction of the planets 3600 years earlier, on 18 February —3101.
The five main paksas that developed in India are the Brahma,20 the Arya,21 the Ardharatrika,22 the Saura,23 and the Ganes"a;24 the Brahma and the Saura both were revised in the medieval period. There are, as well, some texts which belong to no paksa,25 and some derived from Islam.26 These find their expression in various literary forms, which were classified under three main headings from the seventh century on. Siddhdntas are comprehensive treatises deducing mean motions from the beginning of the Kalpa or the current Kaliyuga; karanas are

There are as well many specialized works on aspects of astronomy, of which the most important group is on observational instruments (yantra).

Siddhdntas
The earliest siddhdnta that has come down to us is a Paitamahasiddhanta27 of the early fifth, century. This is preserved because ofits incorporation intothe Visnudharmottarapurana28 (2, 166—174), though it also (or at least the astronomical section, chapters 168—174) has been copied as an independent treatise.29 Its position as the source of the Brahmapaksa is made evident by Brahmagupta's dependence onit in composing the first tenchapters (Dasadhyayi) of the BSS, and wasexplicitly recognized by Kamalakara (Siddhantatattvaviveka 1, 62). Its chronological position is fixed by the fact that Sassanian astronomers in about 450 knew one of its characteristic parameters ;30 this makes it more than likely that Pitamaha is the Svayambhu referred to by Aryabhata (A Gola 50), whose Kalpa-system is a modification of the Brahmapaksa's (heeven accepts the Brahma's rotation of the uccas and pdlas [A Dasagitika 7 and Gola 2] despite the fact that in his system that is unnecessary), whose table of Sines (A Dasagitika 10andGanitapada 12) is derived from thePait. (3, 12), and who copies various other formulae from the same source. The Pait. is cast in the form of a lecture by Brahma to Bhrgu. Its first two chapters deal with astrology. Chapter three discusses time-measurements, the parameters of the planetary system, Sines andVersines, thedeclination of the Sun and latitudes of the planets, gnomon-problems, right and oblique ascensions, a star catalogue, theGreek-letter phenomena of the planets, and the calendar; this confused congeries isalso indicative ofthe age ofthe Pait. as later siddhdntas are arranged far more systematically. Chapter four covers the computation of the dhargana (number of days lapsed since epoch), theastrological lords of the years, days, andparvans, the computation of the mean andtrue longitudes of the planets and of their latitudes, and the times of the occurrences of the planets' first and second stations. Chapter five deals with the earth's shadow (for lunar eclipses), sankrdntis, tithis, karanas, yogas, and the vaidhrta and vyatlpdta pdtas. Chapter six covers some problems in spherical trigonometry and their solution by means of analemmata. Chapter seven is devoted to the computation of the ascendant and of the time lapsed since sunrise. Chapter eight presents the method of computing the times and longitudes of the first and last visibilities of the planets and fixed stars. And chapter nine gives rules for computing the illumination of the Moon and longitudinal and latitudinal parallax (for solar eclipses). Several of these rules are incomplete or wrong as presented in the twoeditions, andonly the preliminaries for computing lunar

and solar eclipses aregiven. One suspects that theoriginal Pait. was a more competent work than what we now possess of it. Aryabhata31 was 23 years old in3600 Kali = A.D. 499 (A Kalakriya 10) and wrote his Aryabhatiya32 at Kusumapura (A Ganitapada 1), which is identified by Bhaskara in his commentary on this verse with Pataliputra (p. 45). The same Bhaskara, in a series of examples relating to thekuttaka, refers to the Asmakasya ganita (p. 138), or Asmakiya (pp. 140,146,147, and 148), or Asmaka as anauthority onthe subject, and he applies to the Aryabhatiya the epithet Asmaka (e.g., in MB 1,3). Scholars, beginning at least with Nilakantha (on A Ganitapada 1), have contended onthis basis that Aryabhata was born in the Asmaka country between the Godavari and the Narmada; but the epithet may only reflect Bhaskara's own origin and training in Asmaka. The Aryabhatiya, which is thebasic text of the Aryapaksa, is not, strictly speaking, a siddhdnta since it combines, inextreme conciseness, the fundamentals of both astronomy andmathematics. Itis divided into four pddas. The Dasagitika gives theplanetary parameters, thedivisions of the Kalpa, anda table ofthe first order differences ofthe Sines; at one point Aryabhata refers to the diurnal rotation as a rotation of the earth (ADasagitika 3; seealso Golapada 9—10) but elsewhere (A Golapada 16) he mentions the mathematically equivalent theory of the rotation of the fixed stars (bhagola). The theory of the diurnal rotation of the earth was fiercely attacked by many later Indian astronomers, beginning with Varahamihira (PS 13, 6—7). The Ganitapada, on mathematics, will be briefly discussed in chapter III. The Kalakriyapada defines time units, describes two geometrical models of planetary motion (eccentric with epicycle and concentric with two epicycles), and gives rules for computing the true longitudes of the planets. Finally, the Golapada expounds Aryabhata's cosmology and geography, explains the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies, and gives solutions for problems inspherical trigonometry and rules for computing eclipses. The Aryapaksa which evolved from the A was formostof its history popular mainly in South India, though the earliest extant commentaries were composed inGujarat—the Aryabhatiyabhasya ofBhaskara33 at

Valabhi in 629 and that of Somesvara in the eleventh or twelfth century; equally attesting to its popularity inWestern India in the eighth and early ninth centuries is its use by Arabic astronomers of the period, who call Aryabhata Arjabhar.34 Al-Blruni, however, while he possessed a copy of the A in the Panjab in the 1020's, was confused about its identity.35 The later Indian commentators onthe A,almost allofits manuscripts, and most ofthe texts following the Aryapaksa36 come from South India. TheSanskrit commentaries in addition to those named above were composed by Suryadeva Yajvan, who was born in 1191, at Gangapura in Cola country; by Paramesvara37 in about 1450 at Asvatthagrama in Kerala; by Yallaya at Skandasomesvara in Andhrapradesa in 1480; by Nllakantha38 in Kerala shortly after 1501; by Raghunatha Raja at Ahobila in Andhrapradesa in 1597; by Bhutivisnu,39 probably near Kanci in Tamilnadu; and by Ghatigopa40 in Kerala in about 1800.There are also commentaries in Telugu and Malayalam and a translation into Marathi. Aryabhata wrote a second work that formed the basis of the Ardharatrikapaksa, apparently entitled Aryabhatasiddhanta. This is now lost, though a number of astronomers have mentioned its views, and some commentatorsespecially onthe Suryasiddhanta—have quoted its verses.41 Especially prevalent in these quotations are verses describing Aryabhata's simple and crude observational instruments (e.g., by Mallikarjuna Suri42 and by Tammayajvan43) and his clepsydras (by Tammayajvan and by Ramakrsna). The first treatise to follow the Ardharatrikapaksa of the Aryabhatasiddhanta wasa revised version of the Suryasiddhanta. This was composed by a pupil of Aryabhata named Latadeva44 according to the information available to al-Blrunl; and there isno good reason to doubt this attribution. As summarized by Varahamihira in the PS it is a harana rather than a siddhdnta; its epoch is midnight 20/21 March 505. It is nuclear whether this form is that of Latadeva's original, or was imposed on it by Varahamihira.

The earliest extant siddhdntas to adhere to something approaching the classical form belong to the Aryapaksa. They were composed bythat Bhaskara who commented on the Aat Valabhi in 629; ofthese the Mahabhaskariya45 was written before the Aryabhatiyabhasya which quotes from it under the title Karmanibandha (pp. 33, 40, 131, 179, 203, 204, 205, and225-226), while the Laghubhaskariya46 summarizes the MB, and probably postdates the Aryabhatiyabhasya (and theBSS). An arrangement less rigid than that of the classical siddhdnta is evident in the contents of the MB's eight chapters:
1. ahargana; mean longitudes; planetary kuttaka. 2. deddntara correction. 3. spherical trigonometry; catalogue of stars. 4. planetary equations (including the model involving a concentric with equant); tithis, karanas, naksatras, pdtas, and yogas. 5. solar and lunar eclipses. 6. first visibility andillumination of the Moon; first andlast visibilities of the planets; planetary conjunctions. 7. parameters of the Aryapaksa andof the Ardharatrikapaksa. 8. examples.
The arrangement of the eight chapters ofthe LB, which is probably influenced by that of the Dasadhyayi of the BSS, represents the first stage of the fully developed form:
1. ahargana; mean longitudes; desdntara correction (madhyama). 2. planetary equations; naksatras, tithis, karanas, andpdtas (spasta). 3. spherical trigonometry (triprasna). 4. lunar eclipses (candragrahana). 5. solar eclipses (suryagrahana). 6. first visibility and illumination of the Moon (srngonnati). 1. first and last visibilities and conjunctions of the planets (udaydsta and grahayuti).
8. catalogue of stars; conjunctions of planets with stars (bhagrahayuti).
Both of these siddhdntas were, like most Aryapaksa works, popular only in South India; itis there that most of their manuscripts were copied, and their commentaries written. These commentaries include that composed by Govin

Bhaskara's contemporary rival as an astronomer was Brahmagupta,49 who was born in 598 and completed his Brahmasphutasiddhanta50 in 628 at Bhillamala in Rajasthana during the reign of the Capa (Cavotaka) monarch Vyaghramukha. The BSS, which belongs to the Brahmapaksa, was enormously influential on later Indian astronomy as well as on Islamic51 and Western European.52 It consists of twenty-four chapters, to which a twenty-fifth—a karana—is appended in many manuscripts. These begin with a Dasadhyayi (chapters 1—10), which summarizes and expands the teachings of the Pait. The relation to (and possible influence on) the LB will be clear from Table 4. This is followed by a chapter (11) in which Brahmagupta criticizes his predecessors and praises the Brahmapaksa (tantrapariksd) and another (12) on mathematics (ganita). Subject to the tantrapariJcsd's animadversions are Aryabhata, the Jainas, Pradyumna, Latadeva, Varahamihira, Vijayanandin, Visnucandra's Vasisthasiddhanta, Srisena's Romakasiddhanta, and Simha. Additional information concerning those of these authors whose works are lost can be found in the PS, in the Aryabhatiyabhasya of Bhaskara, and in several later commentaries (e.g., those of Bhattotpala on the Brhatsamhita and of Prthudakasvamin on the BSS). The next five chapters of the BSS contain additions and corrections to the Dasadhyayi: chapter thirteen to chapter one, fourteen to two, fifteen to three, sixteen to four and five, and seventeen to seven. Brahmagupta followed this practice of providing supplementary chapters (uttara) in

A new critical edition with the commentary of Prthudakasvamin, an English translation, and a commentary is being prepared by D. PINGREE. 61 Based on it was a Mahasiddhanta which was translated into Arabic as Al-Zlj alSindhind al-kablr in 771 or 773 by Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Fazarl; see D. PINGREE, "The fragments of the Works of al-Fazari," JNES 29 (1970), 103—123. This tradition was also followed by al-Fazari's contemporary, Ya'qub ibn Tariq; see D. PINGREE, "The Fragments of the Works of Ya'qub ibn Tariq," JNES 27 (1968), 97—125. See also D. PINGREE, The Thousands of Abu Ma'shar, London 1968. 52 Concerning the relation of the Sindhind tradition—particularly in the form of the Latin version of al-Khwarizml's Al-Zij al-Sindhind and its commentaries—to the BSS and other Sanskrit works see D. PINGREE, "The Indian and Pseudo-Indian Passages in Greek and Latin Astronomical and Astrological Texts," Viator 7 (1976), 141—195, esp. 151—169.

his Kh also. The last seven chapters of the BSS are more heterogeneous: eighteen is onthekuttaka, nineteen ongnomon problems (sanku), twentyon prosody (chandas), twenty-one on cosmology (gola), twenty-two on instruments (yantra), twenty-three on measurements (mdna), and twenty-four on the contents of the BSS andon its author (samjnd). The BSS was particularly popular in North and West India; thescholar who brought itsderivative,the Mahasiddhanta, to Baghdad in 771 or 773 came from Sind, and the two commentaries known to have been written on it were composed in the North. Balabhadra53 wrote his at Kanyakubja, probably under Yasovarman (ca. 725—750); it isnow lost except forfragments preserved by Prthudakasvamin, Bhattotpala, andal-Blruni. Prthudakasvamin54 wrote hismonumental Vasanabhasya on the BSS at Sthanesvara (Sthanvisvara) in Kuruksetra in the 860's; thecommentary onchapters sixteen to twenty, onmost oftwenty-two, and ontwenty-three and twenty-four is lost. Earlier another astronomer had apparently lived at Sthanesvara, where, in the eighth century, someone wrote a new Paulisasiddhanta.55 This astronomer, while accepting the planetary parameters of the Ardharatrikapaksa and the main division ofthe Kalpa according to the Aryapaksa, compromised with smrti (and theBrahmapaksa) to theextent of accepting the traditional division of a Mahayuga. In order to achieve a mean conjunction at the beginning ofthe current Kaliyuga (which he placed 3,888,000 years after the beginning of the current Mahayuga), he delayed the beginning of celestial motion 648,000 years so that there would remain 3,240,000 years (three of Aryabhata's yugas) before thebeginning of the current Kaliyuga. The Paulisasiddhanta is not extant in itsentirety, butmany fragments remain in the works of Prthudakasvamin, Bhattotpala, al-Biruni, and Amaraja.56 Probably also in the eighth century, though perhaps in the early ninth, Lalla composed his Sisyadhlvrddhidatantra57 following the Aryapaksa, but with bljas forperiods of250 years subsequent to 498 (the numerators ofsome of these bijasare borrowed from Haridatta, who wrote in683). Lalla may have lived in Da&apura in Malava, which hementions (SDV 2, 9, 10). His approximate date is indicated by his initial bija-iperiod, which ends in 748; by his sharing with the Paulisasiddhanta and the Suryasiddhanta the Brahmapaksa's divisions of a Mahayuga while retaining Aryabhata's parameters; andby the new organization of the siddhdntathat he introduced andthat was imitated by Vatesvara, who wrote his VS in 904, and, in part, by Sripati58 when he wrote hisSSS toward the middle ofthe eleventh century. This new organization ofthe siddhdnta retained essentially the contents ofthe BSS's Dasadhyayi

in a first section, on computation (grahaganita), while gathering theoretical and cosmological material in a second section (gola). The !§DV was commented on bjr Bhaskara59 (b. 1114)andby Mallikarjuna SUri60—probably he who commented on the Suryasiddhanta in 1178in Sanskrit, and previously in Telugu. Thus Lalla's work, as istobe expected ofone belonging tothe Aryapaksa, was popular intheSouth; butthepresence ofmanuscripts in Western India and the references to Lalla in, for instance, Amaraja's commentary on the Kh, show that it was also studied inGujarat and Rajasthana. The Saurapaksa was initiated in about 800bythe unknown author of the "modern" Suryasiddhanta,61 who has modified many of the planetary parameters ofthe Ardharatrikapaksa (and thereby ofLatadeva's Suryasiddhanta) while retaining others along with themidnight epoch, and who has taken over from the Brahmapaksa the traditional divisions of both the Kalpa and the Mahayuga, but delayed the beginning of the motions of the planets by 17,064,000 years so that the rotations of each within the remainder of the Kalpa are divisible byfour. Other elements in the SS indicate its author's knowledge ofBrahmagupta's BSS. The popularity ofthe work was enormous in allparts of India, but especially in the South and Northeast. Virtually every commentator, however, has rearranged the text, adding and subtracting verses adlibitum; the manuscript traditions of these many recensions, especially theearlier ones, will have to be fully investigated before a clear idea of the exact contents of the original can emerge. The most important of the extant Sanskrit commentators are: Mallikarjuna SUri,62 who wrote a commentary in Telugu before composing his Sanskrit SUryasiddhantatika in1178; Candesvara,63 a Maithila Brahmana whose Suryasiddhantabhasya was written in 1185; Madanapala,64 a Maharajadhiraja ofthe Taka family, who wrote his

One of the more interesting sections isthat (VS 1,1,10) in which Vatesvara criticizes Brahmagupta as Brahmagupta hadcriticized hispredecessors, andespecially Aryabhata (BSS 11).

Sripati, who wrote various works atRohinikhanda (about 150miles south of Ujjayini) between 1039 and 1056,followed the Brahmapaksa when he composed the Siddhantasekhara,77 though headds the bljas to the planetary mean motions that characterize the later history ofthis school. He also adds to Brahmagupta's astronomy rules for computing the second component (udaydntara) ofthe equation oftime (S!§$ 3,46)and theevection of the Moon (sphutacaraphala) (S$!§ 11, 2—4);the latter rule, which has ultimately an Islamic Ptolemaic origin, had previously been given byMunjala. Srlpati arranged the twenty chapters of the S$$in much the same order as Lalla's &DV, though without thelatter's division into two sections and with the addition oftwo chapters (13 and14) on arithmetic and geometry (vyaktaganita) and onalgebra (avyaktaganita) respectively.

written by Bhaskara80 at Vijjadavida (?) probably in his native Sahyadri north of Devagiri in 1150. Modelled in form on Lalla's $DV (though with the addition of a chapter on the trigonometrical functions, jyotpatti and of another describing the seasons) the S$B is the foremost text of the Brahmapaksa after the BSS. Bhaskara changes a few parameters minutely, repeats some of the improvements introduced by earlier astronomy such as the equation of time, and presents for the first time the formula for finding Sin (a + P)>81 but the most impressive quality of the Sl§B is its comprehensiveness. Commentaries on the S&B were composed by, among others, Bhaskara himself (Mitaksara); by Laksmidasa in 1501 (Ganitatattvacintamani); by Ganesa82 at Nandipura in Gujarat in the early seventeenth century (Siromaniprakasa); by Nrsimha83 at Kasi in 1621 (Vasanavarttika) and by Munisvara84 at KasI before 1638 (Marici). For approximately 350 years after the composition of the SoB no important siddhdnta was written; the learning of astronomers was rather concentrated in commentaries, their ingenuity in kosthakas. It was, however, probably during this period that a group of minor siddhdntas belonging to the Saurapaksa, but attributed to deities or sages, were written. These are the Somasiddhanta,85 on which a commentary, Gudharthadipika, was composed by Nrsimha86 at Kondavidu in Andhrapradesa in about 1400; a Vasisthasiddhanta87 which claims to be based on that of Visnucandra; a Vrddhavasisthasiddhanta,88 which is influenced by the Brahmapaksa in its planetary equations; and the Brahmasiddhanta89 alleged to be part of a Sakalyasamhita.

Brahma, SUrya, Soma, Vasistha, and Pulastya are mentioned as agreeing with his Saurapaksa parameters in the Siddhantasundara90 (1, 1, 25)by Jfianaraja,91 whowrote this work at Parthapura on the Godavarl in 1503; that by Brahma he means the siddhdntabelonging to the Sakalyasamhita is clear from SSJ2, 1, 3. This work basically follows Lalla's arrangement, but like the S!§B it adds an rtuvarnana(SSJ 2, 6). A commentary, Grahaganitacintamani, was written by Jnanaraja's son, Cintamani,92 inabout 1530. The influence of Islamic Ptolemaic theory upon Indian astronomy can be traced back to Mufijala in the tenth century, but the translation of Persian astronomical treatises in some number into Sanskrit began only in the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries. The works selected for translation werefor the most part the products of the School of Maragha and its descendant at Samarqand; among the treatises so translated were the Zlj of Ulugh Beg93 (Jica Ulugbegl) and al-Qiishji's94 Risalah dar hay'at (Hayatagrantha95). The earliest Sanskrit siddhdntas to reflect this Islamic influence were composed at the Mughal court at Delhi by Nityananda98 during thereign of Shah Jahan; he wrote the Siddhantasindhu forAsaf Khan in 1628, and the Siddhantaraja97 in 1639. While accepting Islamic parameters and models, Nityananda presents his material in traditional form and puts forth the claim (copied from the Jfianabhaskara) that this astronomy had originally been revealed to the Yavana (Muslim) by the Sun, who was temporarily incarnate as Romaka (a Roman, or perhaps QadI Zadah al-RUmi). This Indianized presentation failed to convey to Sanskrit scholars the real superiority of Islamic over Indian astronomy, that is its methodology involving both a reliance on carefully planned andexecuted observations anda concern with the cinematics of the planetary models. Nityananda's efforts produced nodiscernible effects. His contemporaries in KasI, however, did not ignore Islamic astronomy, though some were more receptive than others.

ring to certain doctrines of the Parasikas (Persians), Munis'vara vigorously attacks the theory of precession,100 thereby beginning a heated controversy carried on by Ranganatha, the brother of his rival, Kamalakara, in his Lohagolakhandana, to which Munisvara's cousin, Gadadhara,101 replied in his Lohagolasamarthana.102 Munlsvara wrote his own commentary, the As"ayaprakasini, on the SSBM. Kamalakara,103 who wrote the Sauravasana on the SS and completed the Siddhantatattvaviveka104 in 1658, while accepting the Saurapaksa's planetary parameters, wasfar more receptive to Muslim astronomy as represented by Ulugh Begand the School of Samarqand.105 He was, in particular, prone to agree with Muslim (Ptolemaic) notions of the structure of the planetary system, and he presents what is, apparently, the only Sanskrit treatise on geometrical optics (STV 1,5). This process of transmitting Islamic astronomy to India wascarried much further by the translation of Nasir al-Dln's Arabic version of Ptolemy's EuvXOL^IQ [xa&7]fi.aTLX7) into Sanskrit by Jagannatha106 at Jayapura in 1732 under the patronage of Savai Jayasimha.107 TheSiddhantasamrat108 continues after the thirteenth book of Ptolemy with supplements describing the instruments that Jayasimha hadset up in his observatories in imitation of those installed by Ulugh Beg at Samarqand, and an exposition of Ulugh Beg's and al-Kashi's derivations of sines, followed by remarks on the traditional aspects of Indian astronomy that were not touched upon by Ptolemy.109 This last effort to expound Ptolemaic astronomy in Sanskrit was also doomed to fail; a century later, modern European astronomy was being taught in Sanskrit at Sihore by Somanatha Vyasa110 and other pandits of the Sihore High School111 inthe 1830's and 1840's under theinfluence of Englishmen such as Lancelot Wilkinson. The process of Westernization was practically complete by the time Premavallabha112 wrote hisParamasiddhanta113 at Jayapura in 1882.

Karanas
Karanas outside of South India aredistinguished from siddhdntas by their emphasis on pragmatic rules for computing and their avoidance of astronomical theory. One way in which this practical bent is most obviously manifested is by theelimination of reliance onthetheory of the Kalpa or of the Mahayuga in determining the mean motions of theplanets; their mean longitudes are rather computed from their positions at a given epoch closein time to thedate of the composition of the karana, and thelongitudes of the planets' apogees and nodes (except forthe Moon's) are considered to be fixed. Before theKh, of course, both karanasandsiddhdntas bore thelatter designation. The earliest karanathat we know of, asmentioned previously, isthe Suryasiddhanta of Latadeva, an Ardharatrika text summarized in the Paficasiddhantika; its epoch was 21 March 505, as were also those of Latadeva's recensions of the Romaka and Paulisa siddhdntas epitomized in the PS.114 Varahamihira, the author of the PS,wasa Maga Brahmana from Avantiwho resided in a village named Kapitthaka (probably Kayatha near UjjayinI115). It has further been suggested that hewas connected with theAulikara court at Dasapura, and in particular with Yasodharman who was ruling there in 532. In the PS, besides the summaries of the five siddhdntasof Pitamaha, Vasistha, Romaka, Paulisa, and Surya that we have previously discussed, Varahamihira includes chapters on spherical trigonometry (PS 4; entitled karana), on the first visibility of the Moon (PS 5), on cosmology (PS 13),on instruments andobservations (PS 14), andon differences in observed phenomena and time measurements due to such causes aslocal latitude orlongitude and various conventions (PS 15). The PS was one source of the Chinese Chiuchih li116 written at the T'ang court by Ch'ii-t'an Hsi-ta (Gautama Siddhartha) in 718. An abbreviated karana,dealing almost exclusively with calendaric matters, spherical trigonometry, andthe computation of the positions of the planets, is the Dhyanagrahopadhyaya, preserved in some manuscripts of Brahmagupta's BSS asits last chapter (BSS 25). Its epoch is 21 March 628. Likethe
114 The views of T. S. KTJPPANA SHASTRI, "The Epoch of the Romaka Siddhanta in the Pancasiddhantika, and the Epoch Longitudes of the Sun and Moon in the Vasistha-Paulisa," IJHS 13 (1978), 151—158, are too involved to be argued against here. In general, his solution violates the principles that a lectio difficilior which makes sense is preferable to the lectio facilior that smells of being a learned emendation, and that modern astronomical computations must not be used to revise a manuscript tradition unless there is some substantial reason to believe that that tradition has misrepresented the author's original and that the original must have been in agreement with the modern computations. 115 D.

BSS itself it follows the Brahmapaksa, though anewmethod of approximating all linear and sine-wave functions bymultiplying oneofeach byvarious simple coefficients is introduced. This and other approximative devices alter the parameters somewhat from those standard to the paksa. But thekarana that setthepattern for this genre was the Khandakhadyaka117 of Brahmagupta, whose epoch is 23March 665. The first nine adhikdras present the astronomy ofthe Ardharatrikapaksa. The mean motion ofeach of the planets ispresented as on integer number of rotations in a given number of days increased ordecreased by a small corrective factor inanother, larger number of days; this method was popular in later karanas. The last sixadhikdras form the Uttarakhandakhadyaka; they provide correctives to the first, usually changing the Ardharatrika into Brahma parameters. The influence of the Kh was enormous; it remained the standard karana of Kasmlra, Nepala, and Assam till modern times, but in the medieval period waspopular throughout North and West India. In 735 aZij al-Arkand118 based onit was composed in Sind, and,like the BSS,it wasavailable to al-Blrunl119 in the Panjab in the 1020's. There are extant commentaries written by Prthudakasvamin (Vivarana) atSthanesvara in 864; by Bhattotpala120 (Cintamani) in Kasmlra in 969; by Amaraja121 (Vasanabhasya) atAnandapura in Saurastra in about 1200; and by Yamata, Varuna, and $rldatta. As isnormally the case with such practical texts as karanas and kosthakas, virtually every manuscript represents a different recension. Also, as frequently occurs with karanas, there is a kosthaka based ontheKhandakhadyaka, the Khandakhadyakasarim.122 There is nothing known of karanas written in the eighth andninth centuries, though presumably the genre did not totally disappear. Nor do we possess any portion in Sanskrit of the Karanasara written by Vatesvara at Anandapura in 899; that is preserved only in some quotations in the India, Transits, and Al-Qanun al-Mas'udl of al-Blrunl. x\l-Blruni also refers in theIndia to two karanas by Munjala.123 The Brhan

manasa, whose epoch is 9 March 932, is now lost except for some fragments; but we still possess the Laghumanasa,124 which Munjala composed later at Prakaga on the Tap! in Maharastra. This small karana has drawn elements from both the Aryapaksa (ascorrected by Lalla) andthe Ardharatrikapaksa ; it hasalso, apparently, derived the notion of the second inequality in lunar motion from anIslamic Ptolemaic source. Though it is a karana, the LM does not give epoch positions (apparently one wasexpected to use those of the Brhanmanasa), and its contents arearranged in theform ofa siddhdnta. There are commentaries on the LMwritten by Pra6astadhara (or Pras"astidhara)125 (Vivrti) in Kasmlra in 958; by Suryadeva Yajvan (Grahajnanavasana) in 1248 at Gangapura in Cola country;126 by Paramesvara (Paramesvara) at AsVatthagrama in Kerala in 1409; and by Yallaya (Kalpalata) at Skandasomesvara in Andhrapradesa in 1482. Like theKS of VatesVara, theKaranatilaka composed by Vijayananda (or Vijayanandin) in Varanasi is known to visonly through al-Biruni, for whom it was incompetently translated into Arabic in 1026 as theGhurrat al-zijat.127 The epoch of this, thefirst karana of the Saurapaksa, is 23/24 March 966. In the early eleventh century the court of Bhojaraja,128 the Paramara Maharaja of Dhara, produced numerous works of Sanskrit literature. Among them is a karana of the Brahmapaksa, containing (as does the more or less contemporary S&S) the bljas that were utilized by most of the succeeding adherents of this paksa. TheRajamrganka, whose epoch is 21 February 1042, is notpreserved for usin its original form, as most of the verses quoted from it by, for example, Amaraja in hisVasanabhasya onthe Kh,arenotfound in the manuscripts.129 Aversion by one Rama130 contains many verses in common with twomanuscripts at Baroda,131 though each of the three versions also contains a number of verses notin the other two. Moreover, allthree versions comprise only the first two adhikdras: madhyamagrahdnayana and spastikarana. The RM is sometimes accompanied by tables (sdrani), butthese have yet to be investigated.

A popular karana belonging to the Aryapaksa is the Karanaprakasa1" composed by Brahmadeva133 at Mathura (probably Madurai in South India); its epoch is 11 March 1092. There is a commentary (Vrtti) by Damodara,!3* who also wrote in West India an Aryatulya based onthe A in 1417 and a Suryatulya based on the SS; and there are undated commentaries by Amaresa135 (Vyakhyana) in Karnatakl; by Govinda136 (Vivarana or Vivrti) onthe first two adhikdras; by S"rmivasa Yajvan (Karanaprakasaprabha); andby Sampatkumara (Vyakhya). Both the manuscripts of the K P and its commentators come predominantly from South andWest India, andespecially from Mysore and Maharastra. Satananda composed the Bhasvatl,137 a karana following the Ardharatrikapaksa, allegedly at Purusottama (Puri in Orissa), in 1099. He claims to follow the SS astaught by(Varaha)mihira, but offers farmore than is found in the PS; the B is sometimes entitled Pancasiddhantika after its source. As is the case with many ofthese karanas, there arenumerous recensions of the B; some manuscripts addan Uttarabhasvati. The principle commentaries are those composed by Aniruddha138 (Sisubodhini) at Benares in 1495; byGanapati139 (Vivrti) inBengal inabout 1500; by Madhava140 (Madhavi) at Kanyakubja in 1525; byAcyuta141 (Ratnamala) in the 1530's, probably in Bengal; by Balabhadra142 (BalabodhinI) atUmanagara in Jumiladesa, Nepala, in 1543; by Kuvera Misra143 (Tika) in 1685; by Gangadhara144 (Udahrti) in 1685; by Ramakrsna (Tattvaprakas"ika) in1739; byKamalanayana145 in about 1740( ?), probably in Mithila; and by Yogindra in 1742, apparently also in Mithila. The distribution of the B's manuscripts and its commentators demonstrates its popularity inNorth and Northeast India and inNepal.

paksa; its epoch is 23February 1183.There are commentaries composedby Ekanatha147 (Brahmatulyabhasya) at Mahandanagara, apparently in West India, in about 1370; byPadmanabha148 (NarmadI), probably also in West India, in about 1400; byVisvanatha (Brahmatulyodaharana) at Benares in 1612; andby Sumatiharsa Gani (Ganakakumudakaumudi) near the Vindhyadri in 1621. The Karanakutuhalatika ofSodhala was composed before 1462, the date ofits unique manuscript copy,149 andthat ofCandldasa150 before 1658. There is a setofplanetary tables, the Brahmatulyasarim,151 based on theKK. As in the case of Bhaskara's S&B,the KK of Bhaskara was followed by several centuries during which no new member of the genre was produced. However, in the early sixteenth century Ganesu152 atNandigrama in Gujarat wrote the Grahalaghava153 or Siddhantarahasya, apparently based on the Grahakautuka composed in 1496 by his father, Kesava;154 the epoch of the GL is 18 March 1520.A commentator onthe GL, Mallari, states that GaneSa observed the planets and chose the correct parameters from the Brahmapaksa, the Aryapaksa, andthe Saurapaksa; this story obviously conflicts with the alleged relation of the GL to Kesava's Grahakautuka. In fact, themean motions ofthe planets (given for dhruvdnkas of4,016 days) and their equations are unique to theGanesapaksa, ofwhich the GL is the first text asyetavailable (Ihave not been able toconsult anymanuscript ofthe Grahakautuka). The Ganesapaksa soon competed with theBrahmapaksa inWest and Northwest India. Commentaries on it were composed byGanesa's nephew and pupil

Nrsimha,155 who was born at Nandigrama in 1548 (Harsakaumudi); by Mallari,156 the son of Ganesa's pupil, Divakara, at Golagrama on the Godavarl between 1575 and 1600 (Tika); by Gangadhara157 in 1586, probably at Tapara north of Devagiri, his father Narayana's residence (Manorama); by Visvanatha at Kasi in 1612 (Siddhantarahasyodaharana); by Narayana158 at Kasi before 1635 (Udahrti); and by Kamalakara159 before 1662 (Manorama). There are many tables based on the GL, many using the ends of the! various dhruvdnkas as their epochs.160 At Akbar's court a karana belonging to the Saurapaksa, the Ramavinoda,161 was composed by Rama (or Ramacandra) for a bhupdla also named Rama (or Ramadasa). Its epoch is 11 March 1590, which is stated to be thirty-five years after the era of Akbar; the epoch of Akbar's "Divine Era," which was introduced on Nawruz of 1584, was indeed 11 March 1556. A commentary, Ramavinodadipika, was written by Visvanatha at Kampilya shortly after 1602. There is also a kosthaka written by Rama and bearing the same name as the RV. A far more obscure karana is the Laghukarana162 by Bhavasadasiva.163 Its epoch is 27 March 1598; it follows the Brahmapaksa; and its unique manuscript copy came to London from Gujarat in 1809. Somewhat better known is a Saura karana, the SUryapaksasarana164 or Khacaragama composed by Visnu; its epoch is 7 March 1608. A commentary, Udaharana, was written on it by Visvanatha already in 1612. The fact that the karana belongs to the Saurapaksa and that it was known to Visvanatha within four years of its composition makes it likely that Visnu lived in Benares, in which case he was probably the Visnu who instructed Krsna,165 who wrote the Bijankura in about 1600, and was himself the pupil of Ganesa's nephew, Nrsimha.

A comparison of their respective chapter titles will demonstrate how closely the KKK follows the GL, whose system of astronomy it attempted to introduce into Maharastra. The paucity of manuscripts suggests that it met with little enthusiasm. The last karanato which allusion must be made is the Karanavaisnava168 of Sankara, which belongs to the Brahmapaksa; its epoch is 8 May 1766. Sankara otherwise, in the incomplete manuscript available to me,169 informs us only that his teacher's name was Nandabhatta. It is possible that this is the Nandarama Misra170 who wrote various works on astronomy and astrology at Kamyavana in Rajasthana between 1763 and 1778; in favor of this tentative identification is the fact that Rajasthana was one of the places in which the Brahmapaksa was popular.

Astronomy 41
Kosthakasw
Closely associated with karanasin North and West India since at least the twelfth century were astronomical tables (kosthakas or sdrants) which were intended to facilitate the computation of planetary positions and the cusps of the astrological places for those who cast horoscopes, or that of various calendaric functions such as tithis, naksatras, and yogas for the makers of almanacs (pancdngas). Tables had much earlier been an integral part of astronomical writings, in which they were versified along with the mathematical formulae. But the composing of tables using numerical symbols arranged in columns was apparently introduced into India as an imitation of Islamic zijes. The Indian genius for mathematical computation led them to develop many ingenious ways to present the complex elements of their planetary and calendaric models in tabular forms very different from those in use in Islam, but the ultimate derivation of the idea from the West seems unquestionable. In fact, the earliest such kosthaka concerning which we have any information is apparently the zij composed by Durlabha172 at Multan in Sind; its epoch is 932. Our only source of knowledge of this zij, however, is al-Biruni's India; and he quotes from the instructions rather than from the tables, which presumably accompanied those instructions if the work was indeed a zij. Planetary tables in India can be classified into three categories. "Mean linear" arrangements tabulate the increments in the mean longitudes of the planets in successively smaller units of time; the manda and sighraequations are tabulated separately. This is the form of planetary table employed by Ptolemy and by most of his eastern and western successors. The "true linear" arrangement tabulates the true longitudes of the planets in ideal years at given intervals (avadhis).The ideal years assume initial mean longitudes of the planet at equal distances around the zodiac while the initial mean longitude of the Sun is always at Aries 0°; the intervals between the initial mean longitudes that are attested are 3°, 6°, 12°, 13;20° (a naksatra), and 30°. Mean motion tables in terms of these intervals allow one to locate the planet within this system for any given year. The avadhisare normally periods of fourteen days. The "true linear" arrangement seems to be an Indian invention. Finally, the "cyclic" arrangement utilizes the Babylonian goal-year periods (that of Venus is changed from 8 to 227 years). The planet's true longitude for the beginning of each avadhi in each year of its goal-year period is entered in the table; after one period the cycle is repeated. The goal-year periods themselves were introduced into Indian astronomy from Islamic in the early seventeenth century;173 the "cyclic" tables

produced in that century and the succeeding two in West and Northwest India combined these goal-year periods with the native tradition of true linear tables. The planetary tables that have been studied heretofore are as follows.174 1. The Grahajfiana175 by ASadhara,176 belonging to the Brahmapaksa. Its epoch is 20 March 1132; it is true linear. Apparently written in Gujarat. Expanding the instructions for using these tables is the Ganitacudamani composed by Harihara in Gujarat in about 1580. 2. The Laghukhecarasiddhi177 of Sridhara, also belonging to the Brahmapaksa. Its epoch is 20 March 1227; it is mean linear. Probably written in Khandesa. 3. The Mahadevi178 of Mahadeva,179 again belonging to the Brahmapaksa. Its epoch is 28 March 1316; it is true linear. Written on the banks of the Godavari, most probably in Maharastra. 4. The Makaranda180 of Makaranda,181 belonging to the Saurapaksa and including tithi, naksatra, yoga,and eclipse as well as planetary tables. Its epoch is 27 March 1478; it is mean linear, and the only set of mean motion tables that is entirely sexagesimal. Written at Kasl. 5. The Khetamuktavali182 of Nrsimha,183 belonging to the Ganesapaksa. Its epoch is 31 March 1566; it is true linear. Written at Nandigrama in Gujarat. 6. The Candrarki184 and the Khetasiddhi185 of Dinakara,186 belonging to the Brahmapaksa. The former deals with the Sun and Moon, the latter with the other planets. Their epoch is 31 March 1578; they are true linear. Written at Barejya in Gujarat. 7. The Grahakaumudl187 of Nrsimha, the author of the Khetamuktavali to whose Ganesapaksa the Grahakaumudl also adheres. Its epochs are 31 March 1588 and 31 March 1603; it also is true linear. Written at Nandigrama in Gujarat. 8. The Ramavinoda188 of Rama, who wrote the Saura karana of the same name. Its epoch is 11March 1590; it is true linear. Written at the Mughal court.

Probably composed in Bengal. 10. TheGrahaprabodha191 of Nage6a,192 which follows the GaneSapaksa. Its epoch is 5 March 1619, thebeginning oidhruvdnka 9; it is mean linear. Written in Gujarat. There is an uddharana by Yadava, in which the example is for 9 December 1663. 11. The Khecaras"ighrasiddhi or GrahasaranI193 of Gangadhara,194 also belonging tothe Ganesapaksa. Its epoch is 1March 1630, the beginning ofdhruvanka 10; it is mean linear. I t includes tables for computing eclipses. Written at Kasl. 12. The Grahavidyadhara195 of Vidyadhara. The tables themselves are not preserved, but Vidyadhara states that they belonged to the Brahmapaksa. Its epoch is about 29 March 1638;it is mean linear. Written at Rajakota in Saurastra. 13. TheJagadbhusana198 of Haridatta, belonging to the Brahmapaksa. Its epoch is 31 March 1638; it is the first set of cyclic planetary tables. Written in Mewar, Rajasthan. 14. The Khecaradipika197 of Kalyana,198 also following the Brahmapaksa. Its epoch is31 March 1649; it istrue linear, being anadaptation ofthe Mahadevi. The fact that two of its verses are derived from the CandrarkI of Dinakara support the impression that it was composed in Gujarat or Rajasthan. 15. TheGrahaprakasa199 of Devadatta,200 belonging to the Adjusted Saurapaksa. Its epoch is 28 March 1662; it is mean linear. As his nephew Murari traveled to Kas'I in order to bathe at Manikarnika, Devadatta probably did not live in that city; but nothing positive is known concerning his locale. 16.

Brahmapaksa. Its epoch is 1 April 1704; it is cyclic. Composed at Nalinapura, presumably a locality in Rajasthan. 18. TheGanitaraja205 ofKevalarama Pancanana206 contains eclipse tablesand tithi, naksatra, and yoga tables as well as planetary tables; it follows the Adjusted Saurapaksa. Its epoch is 30 March 1728; it is mean linear. The equations are normed so as to be always positive; this feature was probably borrowed from Islamic tables. Written in Navadvlpa, Bengal. 19. TheGrahagama207 of Govindasunu,208 belonging to the Ganesapaksa. Its epoch is 6 February 1773Julian, which is the beginning of dhruvdnka 23; it is mean linear. Composed at &ipos"i, which is presumably a locality in Rajasthan. A second category of kosthakas that were popular in India provides tables for computing the beginnings (and ends) of tithis (periods during which the elongation ofthe Moon from the Sunincreases by 12°), naksatras (periods during which the longitude ofthe Moon increases by 13; 20°), andyogas (periods during which the combined motion of the Sun and the Moon equals 13;20°). The computations of the true instances of the beginnings of tithis andyogas is made complex by the fact that both of the luminaries have varying velocities, the Sun's dependent onthedistance of its mean longitude from a more or less fixed sidereal point (its mandocca) and the Moon's on the distance of its mean longitude from a constantly moving point (itsmandocca). Thesolutions adopted by various Indian koslhakakdras arenotyetunderstood in their totality by the present writer. Thetithis, naksatras, and yogas themselves needed to be tabulated for the convenience of astrologers computing muhurtas and of the constructors of pancdngas which informed the populace of the details of the calendar andthe proper times for festivals andthe performance of samskdras. Several of the planetary tables contain also tables of tithis, naksatras, and yogas; these aretheMakaranda of Makaranda, the Candrarki of Dinakara, and the Ganitaraja of Kevalarama Pancanana discussed above. Independent kosthakas on this subject include the following: 1. TheSighrasiddhi209 of Laksmidhara, which tabulates functions according to both the Aryapaksa and the Brahmapaksa. Its epoch is 1278, and it was probably composed intheterritory ofthe Yadavas ofDevagiri. The Slghrasiddhi was expanded in 1618—1628 by Janardana210 at Sangamanera in Maharastra; it was also used by Vidyadhara in 1643at Rajakota in Saurastra. 2. The Tithikamadhenu211 of Mahadeva,212 following the Aryapaksa. Its epoch is 1357,and it wascomposed at Tryambaka in Maharastra.

It appends true-linear planetary tables to those for tithis,naksatras, and yogas.
A final class of astronomical tables includes those designed for use in computing lunar and solar eclipses. Such tables are embedded in the Grahasarim of Gangadhara and the Ganitaraja of Kevalarama, which have already been described. The only set of tables devoted exclusively to the subject of eclipses would seem to be the Karanakesarl232 of Bhaskara.233 Its epoch is 1681, and it was composed at Saudamika, evidently a locality in Gujarat. However, specialized treatises on eclipse computations—e.g., the Parvadvayasadhana of Mallari—frequently include versified tables; such texts are described more fully below. The kosthakas described in the preceding pages come mostly from wrestern India with a few representatives of a tradition in Kasl and Bengal. This bias reflects a real situation in the history of Indian astronomy to which we have previously referred—that is, the influence of the Islamic zlj on the Indian kmthaka.However, other parts of India were not without such tables, though those known to me tend to be late.234 Moreover, the next section of this chapter will describe texts containing versified tables used in South India in imitation of those found in siddhantas and karanas.It was generally in this form that astronomical functions were tabulated in those parts of India not subject to a direct and profound Islamic influence.

South Indian AstronomersTM
The Dravidian speaking areas of the Indian peninsula—Andhrapradesa, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, andKerala—developed traditions ofastronomy (and mathematics) based on the Arya and Saura paksas,but largely independent of the traditions in the rest of India; this insularity wasparticularly trueof Kerala, where some ofthe most brilliant work ever to bedone in India in mathematics was produced inthefourteenth and fifteenth centuries without having anyeffect whatsoever on the north. Inthe south in particular developed three interrelated systems: theParahita and Vakya following the Aryapaksa, and the Drgganita following the Saurapaksa. Further, a genre of literature called tantra orkarana evolved inwhich theauthor could deal with selected topics inastronomy rather than giving a complete system asa siddhdnta or northern karana would. Alongside these texts, which arecollections ofproblems, there were written short essays dealing with single facets ofastronomy. To some extent, aswe shall see, such essays were also composed inthe north,but never inthe numbers inwhich they were written in Kerala. The Parahita system was first embodied intheGrahacaranibandhana236 of Haridatta. Traditionally the date ofthe inception ofthe system was683; since Haridatta isalready quoted as an authority ofGovindasvamin inhis Prakatarthadipika, written inthefirst half of the ninth century, 683 isnotan unreasonable date for Haridatta. The GCN versifies themean daily motionsof the planets according tothe Aryapaksa, the sines of their equations at intervals in the argument of 3;45° (hecalls these tables vdkyas), theslghraanomalies necessary forfirst and last stations, and the mean longitudes ofthe planetson 20 March 355;allof the numbers are expressed bythe katapayddi system. In another work—probably thelost Mahamarganibandhana—Haridatta gave blja corrections to the mean yearly motions ofthe planets, to be applied to the years following 522. Following the Parahita system, and thereby the Aryapaksa, are the vdkyas. These are based on the synodic periods ofthe five planets and cycles based on those periods, and, inthe case ofthe Moon, on cycles ofits anomalistic period: within each synodic period true longitudes atregular time intervals are given, and inthe smallest lunar cycle daily longitudes ofthe Moon are given. The earliest attested epoch ofthe lunar vdkyas is 1184. Thevdkyas themselves, called Candravakyani237 and attributed toVararuci, use the relation: 9anomalistic months = 248days. The larger cycles ofthe system are:110anomalistic months = 3031 days, and449 anomalistic months = 12,372 days. The two

smaller cycles had already been given by the Vasisthasiddhanta known to Varahamihira (PS 3, 8—9); the first is ultimately Babylonian. Several Sanskrit poems composed in Kerala contain, embedded in their verses by means of the hatapayddi system, Vararuci's lunar vdhyas; the most notable of these isthe Haricarita238 composed by Paramesvara239 in the fifteenth century, in which the life of Krsna provides the surface meaning for the versified astronomical tables. These vdhyas were still in use in south India in modern times. They were described by John Warren in 1825240 as part of a discussion of the pancdngacomputations; in this form, and misnamed "Tamil," they generated some interest among non-Indian historians of science in the 1950's and 1960's.241 The planetary vdhyas are given in an anonymous text entitled Vakyakarana,242 in which theepoch of the lunar vdhyas is 22May 1282; thetext seems to have been composed in about 1300, probably near Kancl. There is a commentary composed by Sundararaja, who was a native ofViprasadgrama (Andana-nal-lur near Trichinopoly), in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century; Sundararaja studied under Padmagarbha during thereign of (Gopendra) Tipparaja,243 who ruled Kondavldu in theGuntur District for theVijayanagara king, Krsnadeva Raya, from about 1515 till 1520, and he corresponded with the well-known astronomer, Gargyakerala Nilakantha Somayajin, whom we shall presently discuss in more detail. Before turning to themost important school of Kerala astronomers, I should mention the first text in a genre, the tantra, cultivated exclusively in south India. Atantra is like a karana in itsemphasis onpragmatic solutions to particular astronomical problems—sometimes only to those that were regarded as needing a special treatment. Butsince it follows theAryapaksa, in which there is a mean conjunction ofall the planets at the beginning ofthe current Kaliyuga (6 A.M. at Lanka on 18 February—3101), a tantra uses that date as its epoch rather than a date closer in time to the author's. The earliest such tantra is the Varsikatantra244 written by Viddana or Viddana. His ownname and that of his father, Mallaya, indicate a Dravidian origin, probably in Mysore whence most of the manuscripts of his work come. The

Varsikatantra waswritten before 1370 since it is quoted by Ekanatha in his commentary on Bhaskara's KK. It consists of eleven adhydyas in a somewhat unusual order: dhruvamadhya (=madhyama), grahagatinirnaya (=sphuta), chdyd (=triprasna), candragrahana, suryagrahana, valilekhana f=parilekha), mahdpdta, udaydstamaya, grahayuti, bhagrahayuti, and srngonnati. A manuscript was acquired in the Karnataka and brought to Bikaner in Rajasthan by the Maharaja Anupasimha245 in about 1675; there the work wras revised by the court astronomer, Virasimha, in 1678, anda set of kosthakas calculated for it. But the most important school ofastronomers from south India was founded by its most brilliant member, Madhava246 of Sangamagrama (near Cochin in Kerala), in the late fourteenth century. Hismost ingenious work was done in the investigation of the series that express thevalue of 7r and of other trigonometrical functions used in astronomy; this achievement is discussed more fully in thechapter on mathematics. The surviving astronomical works of Madhava are for the most part concerned with refinements of the vdkya system. They include, on the lunar vdkyas, the Sphutacandrapti;247 its elaboration, the Venvaroha,248 whose epoch is 1403; anda new set of Candravakyani249 giving daily longitudes of the Moon correct to the second sexagesimal place instead of to the first as in the Candravakyani of Vararuci. The idea of the Sphutacandrapti and theVenvaroha is to utilize thecyclic nature of the lunar vdkyas, in which nine anomalistic months equal 248 days, to determine easily the lunar longitude at nine equally distant times in one day. A Malayalam commentary wras written on the Venvaroha by Acyuta Pisarati250 in the early seventeenth century. Onthe computation of the longitudes of the planets Madhava wrote a Madhyamanayanaprakara and anAganitagrahacara, the latter apparently in 1418. Healso composed a Lagnaprakarana on computing theascendant. None of these has yet been published.

whose epoch is 15 July 1411; his Grahananyayadipika;253 and his Grahanastaka.254 Such an influence, however, isnot clearly discernible. ParamesVara's main importance in planetary astronomy in south India was through his drgganita system, expounded in the Drgganita255 of 1431. In this the mean motions (with slight modifications inthe cases ofthe lunar mandocca and node) were taken from the Saurapaksa, though the mean planets were assumed not all to beat Aries 0°at the beginning of the Kaliyuga; the longitudes of the mandoccas (except for Saturn's) are derived from Mufrjala's LM; and the dimensions of the manda and slghra epicycles are new. Paramos'vara also wrote two Goladipikas in which hediscusses general astronomical and geographical theories; the first256 of these was written in 1443 and is accompanied by a commentary composed by theauthor himself, thesecond257 was composed toward theendofhis life, probably inthe 1450's. A student ofParamesVara's sonandstudent, Damodara, was Gargyakerala Nilakantha Somayajin, one ofthe commentators onAryabhata's A. Nilakantha was born onabout 14 June 1444 at Kundapura near Tirur in Kerala; in the Aryabhatiyabhasya (onKalakriya 12—15) he refers tohisobservation ofsolar eclipses in 1467 and 1501. Nilakantha made several efforts to establish new parameters for the mean motions ofthe planets (most ofhis parameters for the other elements ofthe planetary models are taken from the Aryapaksa or the Saurapaksa). The first setof new parameters isfound in the Tantrasangraha258 composed in 1501, andin abbreviated form in the Golasara;259 the commentaries on the Tantrasangraha—the Yuktidipika andthe Laghuvrtti, both written byNilakantha's student, Sankara, in about 1550—are important for the transmission of Madhava's work on power series. The second set is presented in the Siddhantadarpana,260 on which Nilakantha composed his own commentary. Nilakantha also wrote a small work, the Candracchayaganita,261 on computing theMoon's shadow; it also is accompanied by a commentary from the author's ownhand. But his most fascinating work, and onethat is apparently unique in the history of Indian astronomy, is the Jyotirmlmamsa262 that he wrote in 1504. In this treatise Nilakantha vigorously defends the necessity

constantly tocorrect astronomical parameters onthe basis ofobservation, especially with regard toeclipses, but also with regard tothe planets other than the Sun and the Moon; this defense is clearly aimed atthe efforts inthis direction made not only by Nilakantha himself, but also by his parmnaguru, ParamesVara. Another pupil ofParamesvara's son, Damodara, was thefamous author of the Malayalam Yuktibhasa, Jyesthadeva;263 and among his pupils was Acyuta Pisarati ofKundapura inKerala, the author ofthe Malayalam commentary on Madhava's Venvaroha whom wehave previously mentioned. Acyuta, whodied on 7July 1621 atthe age ofabout seventy, wasaprolific author on astronomy. On planetary theory, eclipses, and the pdtasofthe Sun and the Moon he wrote before 1596 a Karanottama with a vivarana.26i His Sphutanirnayatantra265 deals not only with the computation ofthe positions of the planets, but also with the constellations andwith the celestial andterrestrial spheres; on this also Acyuta wrote hisown commentary. Oneclipses he composed in 1593 an Uparagakriyakrama (a work of the same title was written by a contemporary Kerala astronomer, Narayana,266) andan Uparagavims'ati,267 and on the Moon's shadow aChayastaka,268 which attempts tocompress the material expressedby Nilakantha inthirty-two verses inthe Candracchayaganita into the compassof a poem ofa quarter ofthat length. But Acyuta's most unusual work is the Rasigolasphutaniti269 in which heexpounds amethod for reducing the Moon's longitude inits orbit to anecliptic longitude in accordance with anIslamic tradition initiated byYaljya ibn Abi Mansur in the 820's.270 More than a century after Acyuta's death (if the interpretation ofhis ahargana as ca. 22March 1733 iscorrect) aSomayajin belonging tothe Putumana family (Nutanagrha) of Sivapura in Kerala wrote aKaranapaddhati,271 which discusses the basis for many astronomical andmathematical parameters andcomputations, including Madhava's power series andtheir developments. This Putumana wrote several other astronomical works also, ofwhich the most important is the Nyayaratna; none ofthese has been published. This tradition ofastronomy in Kerala continued well into the nineteenth century, but the author of the Karanapaddhati is thelast major figure.

The earliest observational instrument in use in India was the sanku or gnomon, employed to find thecardinal directions in theSulbasutras. Sincethe fourth century B.C. both the sanku andthe nddikd or outflowing water-clock have been used (with linear zig-zag functions) to determine time within the solar year andwithin any period of daylight. More elaborate uses of the sanku as an instrument for measuring local time andterrestrial latitude aregiven in every siddhdnta and karana in the chapter on triprasna; eventually the noon equinoctial shadow cast by the sanku was used to characterize thelatitude of localities mentioned in late medieval geographical lists.272 Besides thesimple sanku vertical to theplane of the horizon, Varahamihira (PS 14)273 describes a hemispherical sun dial, a perforated ring, and a perforated sphere (in each of the last two instruments perforations 180° apart serve asa diopter). Other instruments mentioned in thesiddhdntas arebasically illustrative, or are elaborate toys; illustrative are the rotating wooden model of the celestial sphere mentioned by Aryabhata (A.Gola 22—23) or the three-dimensional scale models ofthe Sines ofthe planets' azimuths and altitudes described also by the same astronomer,274 while his clepsydras in fanciful shapes are examples of toys.275 Many later authors of siddhdntas describe these or similar instruments, sometimes in the middle ofthe text (e.g., MB 3, 56—50), but more often in separate chapters on yantras (e.g., BSS 22; £>DV I I 8; S!§S" 19; and SS"B I I 11).The most significant new instrument introduced in these texts composed before the introduction of the astrolabe into India seems to be the phalaka or board of Bhaskara (S&B I I , 16—27), which is basically a dial with a gnomon suspended vertically in theplane of the Sun's altitude circle. The first text to describe the construction and use of the yantrardja or astrolabe in Sanskrit was the Yantraraja276 composed by Mahendra Suri,277 a Jaina from Bhrgupura, for Firuz Shah in 1370. A commentary was composed by Mahendra's pupil, Malayendu Suri,278 in about 1382, and another, the Vilasavati, by Gopiraja279 in 1540. Mahendra has taken from an unidentified Arabic source notonly the rules relating directly to the construction and useof the astrolabe (including a Ptolemaic star-catalogue adjusted for precession), but also a Sine table in which R = 3600 or 1, 0, 0 sexagesimally; a declination

table in which e = 23;35°; a list of cities (including a number in Islamic lands outside of India) with their latitudes expressed in degrees; and shadow tables for twelve and seven digit gnomons. After Mahendra a number ofother texts describing traditional Indian instruments were composed inSanskrit, almost all ofthem inGujarat and Rajasthan, but theastrolabe was generally neglected. The earliest of these is theYantraratnavali composed in about 1400 byPadmanabha, whom we have mentioned earlier as the author of a commentary of Brahmagupta's Kh. The Yantraratnavali contains two chapters, each of which describes theconstruction and use of a single instrument. The first, onthe diksddhana, isnotavailable tome, but I have been able to consult a manuscript of the second, the dhruvabhramana,280onwhich Padmanabha himself wrote a commentary. This instrument appears tobe an elaboration ofBhaskara's phalaka, and isnot derived from the Islamic tradition. A treatise describing a semicircular instrument also derived from thenative Indian tradition is theYantracintamani281 composed by Cakradhara,282 probably in the late fifteenth orearly sixteenth century; Cakradhara himself wrote a commentary onthis, as didalso Rama (Yantradipika) in 1625. In the same Indian tradition are the works on yantras composed in the sixteenth century by Ganesu, the author of the GL, at Nandigrama in Gujarat; these are the Cabukayantra, of which nocopy is available to me, and the Pratodayantra,283 which is a special form of Sun dial. Interest in the astrolabe wasreawakened in north India in the Mughal period. The Risalat al-usturlab of the great thirteenth century Persian polymath, Nasir al-Din Muhammad al-TUsi,284 was translated into Sanskrit at some time during this period. In 1615 at Jambusara in Gujarat Visrama wrote a Yantracintamani285 inwhich he describes the astrolabe, the gnomon, the waterclock, the quadrant, andseveral other instruments. Incidentally, he presents several elements borrowed from Islamic astronomy inaddition to the astrolabe: tables of the Sine and Cosine functions at intervals of 1° with R= 120; a declination table with s= 23;35°; and the goal year periods of the planets.286 A more significant adaptation of Islamic instruments wasthat by Saval Jayasimha in the 1720's and 1730's, the Maharaja andfounder of Jayapura

whom we have previously mentioned astheauthor of a kosthaka. Hismonumental stone observatories erected at Jayapura, UjjayinI, Delhi, Mathura, and VaranasI in imitation of Ulugh Beg's atSamarqand have often been described, though first byhislearned pandita, Jagannatha.287 Healso wrote a prose treatise on the construction and use of the astrolabe, the Yantrarajaracana;288 there is a versification ofthis, theYantraprabha289 ofSrinatha. Though a number of Sanskrit astrolabes made in north India in the eighteenth andnineteenth centuries survive, the only other extant Sanskrit texts on instruments written after 1500are the yantrddhydyas of the SSJ (II 5), the SR (II 3), and the SSBM (II 2). The topic of the development of Indian astronomical instruments is one worthy ofmuch fuller scholarly investigation than has hitherto been devoted to it.

In this section I intend to discuss briefly some minor Sanskrit texts on astronomy that donot fall into anyof the normal categories. Most of these deal with oneor several aspects of solar andlunar theory, and arerelated directly or indirectly to the production of pancdngas or calendars. The earliest of these texts is theDhikotida290 composed bySrlpati,the author ofthe Siddhantasekhara, in1039;init are succinctly described the computations oflunar and solar eclipses. There are commentaries written by Dinakara291 in1608and by Harikrsna inca. 1715. A younger contemporary ofSrlpati was Da&abala,292 a Buddhist who composed aCintamanisaranika293 in 1055 during the reign of the Paramara Bhoja. This treatise deals with the various elements—tithis, naksatras, yogas, etc.—of a pancdnga. A commentary waswritten by Mahadeva294 in 1258.

Commentaries on the Patasadhana were composed by the Divakara who also commented onthe Makaranda in theearly seventeenth century, by Divakara's cousin, ViSvanatha, andby Dinakara298 at Poona in 1839. A work on solar andlunar eclipses, the Parvadvayasadhana,297 was written by Mallari298 in about 1588; this makes plausible his identification with the commentator on Ganesa's GL. To a large extent the Parvadvayasadhana consists of versified tables of variables necessary for the computation of the phases, durations, and magnitudes of eclipses. Commentaries were composed on it by VisVanatha in the early seventeenth century, and by Krsnanatha Dvivedin299 at VaranasI in 1787.300 In about 1600 one Baba,301 theson of Rama and the younger brother of Siva, wrote a Paficangasiddhi302 in which he gives annual increments for tithis, naksatraSyyogas, andtheweek-days on which sidereal years begin for a period of 90 years. Visnusimha wrote in Nepala a work onsolar and lunar computations, entitled Siddhantasara, ofwhich parts survive in both Sanskrit and Nevari ;303 its epoch is Friday 19March 1624. The same manuscript contains the chapters on solar and lunar eclipses from his Jyotihsaranga. Perhaps the most interesting of these miscellaneous works is the Bhariglvibhanglkarana304 composed byRanganatha at KasI in about 1650 in defense of his brother, Mumsvara's, SSBM. In this brief treatise Ranganatha discusses in detail planetary models and computations, with critical comments on various aspects of the theories of the Paitamahasiddhanta, Brahmagupta, the Suryasiddhanta, Bhaskara's S$B, theRomasasiddhanta, theVasisthasiddhanta, the Somasiddhanta, Jnanaraja, the Yavanas, and Laksmidasa's and Nrsimha's commentaries on theS&B. Finally, in this section mention should be made of the Grahalaghavacandrarkl305 composed by Prajarama306 in Gujarat in 1738. This work gives rules for computing thepositions of the Sun andtheMoon according to the Ganes'apaksa without resorting to tables.

CHAPTER III
MATHEMATICS
Mathematics1 is useful to a number of sdstras in India as elsewhere—the sulbasutras, astronomy, and astrology, which are discussed in this volume, as well as such subjects as alchemy, medicine, prosody, and philosophy (particularly Jaina). But there also exists a literature directly concerned with mathematics, in particular with arithmetic (especially its commercial and other practical applications), algebra, and geometry. There was never in India a jdti of mathematicians, and rarely anything that could be called a school; most mathematicians were jyotisls (astronomers or astrologers). Therefore, the mathematical literature consists either in the form of chapters of astronomical siddlidntas or of treatises composed, with a few exceptions, by scholars who were also authors of astronomical texts. Moreover, several important branches of Indian mathematics—analemmata and trigonometry, for instance—rarely if ever are treated outside of the astronomical context that endowed them with significance.
Ganita
The earliest text of this genre that we have is the first chapter of Aryabhata's A entitled Ganitapada.2 In thirty-two verses he deals succinctly with a number of selected topics: the decimal place-value system of numbers; squares and cubes; square-roots and cube-roots; the areas of triangles, rectangles, trapezia, and circles, and the volume of a pyramid ;3 chords and sines of arcs of a circle; TT ;

Mathematics 57
shadow-problems; intersecting circles; sums of various series;4 solutions to quadratic equations; proportions; and the solution of indeterminate equations of the first degree.5 Thus he includes in this chapter on ganita not only arithmetic, geometry, and algebra, but several topics of primary interest to astronomers—i.e., trigonometry, intersecting circles (for eclipse calculations), and indeterminate equations (for deriving the numbers of rotations of the planets in a Mahayuga). The solution to the indeterminate equations utilizes continued fractions; continued fractions had been investigated by Euclid, though not applied to the problem of indeterminate equations, so far as we know, by the Greeks. Many useful illustrations to Aryabhata's rules were given by his early commentator, Bhaskara.6 This same Bhaskara, in his MB (1, 41), appears to be the first to name the continued fraction method of solving indeterminate equations the "pulverizer" (kuttakdra); he applies the "pulverizer" to problems of the planets' mean motions in MB 1, 41—52. In MB 8, 7—25 he sets the student various mathematical problems that arise in astronomy, most of which are intended to exercise his facility in applying the "pulverizer." Bhaskara's contemporary, Brahmagupta, devotes two adhydyas of his BSS to mathematics. Chapter 127 is the earliest extant formal treatise on arithmetic in Sanskrit. In it he gives succinct rules for twenty arithmetical operations (parikarma) and eight determinations (vyavahdra). These are listed by Prthudakasvamin; the parikarmdni are: addition (sankalita), subtraction (vyavakalita), multiplication (pratyutpanna), division (bhdgahdra), square (varga), square—root (vargamula), cube (ghana), cube-root (ghanamula), five8 rules for operating with fractions (pancajdtayah), the rule of three (trairdsika), the inverse rule of three (vyastatrairdsika), the rules of five, seven, nine, and eleven terms, and barter (bhdndapratibhdnda), while the vyavahdrdh are: mixtures (misraka), series (sredhi), plane geometry (ksetra), (solid geometry, subdivided into) excavations (khdta), stacks (citi), sawn lumber (krdkacika), and mounds of grain (rdsi), and shadow-problems (chdyd).

is his exhaustive investigation of triangles and quadr ilaterals—mostly right triangles and cyclic quadrilaterals (BSS 12,21—39). Chapter 18is devoted to algebra, here denominated kuttaka after the pulverizer;9 it is illustrated by exemplary problems (udaharana). Among the topics discussed, in addition to thepulverizer itself, arethemathematics of zero and of surds, quadratic equations, equations with several unknowns, and indeterminate equations of the second degree (vargaprakrti). Brahmagupta's method for solving vargaprakrti equations isnot universally applicable. There isno convincing evidence to support the theory that Brahmagupta had a Greek source.10 Srldhara evidently wrote his four works onmathematics between the time of Brahmagupta, whom he gently criticizes without naming,11 and before Govindasvamin, who quotes a verse from Sridhara's Tri&atika in the Prakatarthadipika that he wrote in ca. 850.12 Thus Srldhara flourished most probably in the eighth century. Though his work onalgebra that was known to Bhaskara13 is now lost, there still survive three of his writings onarithmetic; all seem to beepitomes of a longer, lost work entitled Patiganita, Brhatpati, or Navasati.14 The first of thethree works is the incomplete Patiganita,15 of which wehave some 251 verses (118 aresiltras in dryd meter, and133 are uddharandni mostly in dryd). Following BSS 12 it divides arithmetic into parikarmdni (Srldhara adds nine to Brahmagupta's twenty) and vyavahdrdh (Sridhara adds the mathematics of zero, which was treated in BSS 18, to Brahmagupta's eight). The work begins with verses on mensuration (paribhdsd). Unfortunately, the unique manuscript breaks off in the middle of the third vyavahdra (ksetra). Sharing many verses with this Patiganita is the Patiganitasara or Tri^atika.16 Despite itssecond title, this work contains only

some 180 dryd verses, ofwhich 73aresutras and 107 udaharandni. It follows the order of the Patiganita and thereby provides some idea of the contentsof vyavahdrdh 4—8; but it fails todiscuss themathematics ofzero. The third of Sridhara's works is entitled Ganitapaficavimsi, of which a fragment of two folia hasrecently been discovered.17 Of this work, written almost exclusively in slokas, there survive 53 verses, of which 20 are udaharandni; the section between theinverse rule of three (vyastatrairds'ika) and thediscussion of quadrilaterals in the section onplane geometry (Icsetra) is missing. Perhaps contemporary with Srldhara is thework onmathematics preserved in the Bakhshall manuscript;18 though some scholars would date it asearly as 200 A.D. onthebasis of its symbols, its language, its meter, and its references, none oftheir arguments is very persuasive. The work is earlier than the manuscript, which iswritten in "early" Sarada andmay therefore have been copied in the eighth, ninth, or tenth century. Arguments based onits relation to extant Sanskrit texts onganita appear to me rather unreliable since we have so little from an early period to compare it with, andsince it is clearly not in the main tradition ofthese texts. However, the fact that it is composed of sutrdni andudaharandni in verse with symbolic statements andprose solutions of the examples as aretheworks ofSrldhara makes me believe that it follows the same model asdoes he. Aside from Aryabhata and Brahmagupta, who didnotfollow this model, theonly mathematicians earlier than ^ridhara that we know ofare Maskari, Purana, Putana, and Mudgala whom theearlier Bhaskara mentions,19 and Narmada whom &ridhara himself mentions,20 while Lalla was probably contemporary with Sridhara.21 The tradition, then, of works on ganita based on the classification into pariJcarmdni and vyavahdrdh (the latter are specifically ascribed to Maskari, Purana, andMudgala by Bhaskara) was nota very long one;thetreatment of rules and examples offered by Srldhara and theBakhshall manuscript was probably even shorter, though no certain terminus post quern can be attached to it. The subjects treated inthe Bakhshall manuscript include therule ofthree, series, squareroots, mixtures (misraka), simultaneous equations, andquadratic equations; presumably therest of the traditional contents of a work onganitaonce were present when the manuscript was complete.

into Arabic in the eighth century. The first concrete evidence that survives for that transmission is the work on performing arithmetical operations with the ten Indian number symbols written by al-Khwarizml, probably at Baghdad, in the early ninth century; this is preserved in several recensions of a Latin translation of the early twelfth century.22 A large group of Arabic arithmetics characterized by theuseof the Indian number symbols (for both integersand fractions) and the dust board (takht) were denominated al-hisdb al-hindl ("Indian calculation") by their authors. The oldest of these is the Kitab al-fusul fi al-hisab al-hindi, composed by al-Uqlidisi at Damascus in 952/3.23 The precise relationship of such mathematical works to Indian texts onganita is not as yet established. Mahavlra,24 the most famous of the Jaina mathematicians, wrote his Ganitasarasangraha25 during thereign of the Rastrakuta Amoghavarsa, who ruled parts of Karnataka and Maharastra between ca. 814/15 and ca. 880. In this work he has divided the traditional contents of ganitasdstra into an opening samjnddhikdra (paribhdsd, mathematics of zero, and addition and subtraction) and eight vyavahdms. The parikarma is concerned with multiplication, division, squares, square-roots, cubes, cube-roots, and series; the Jcglasavarna and praktrnaka with fractions; the trairddika with the rules of three, five, seven, and nine; the misraka with mixtures, the pulverizer, and sums of series; the ksetraganita with plane geometry;26 the khdta with solid geometry; and the chdyd with shadow problems. The GSSwas commented on in Kannada by Daivajnavallabha27 (Balabodha) andin Sanskrit by Varadaraja. Furthermore, it wastranslated into Telugu by Pavuluri Mallana28 in the eleventh century and into RajasthanI by Amicandra29 in about 1850. The second Aryabhata included two chapters on mathematics in the MS that he wrote in about 950—1000. Adhydya 15,the pdtyadhydya, deals with

the traditional topics of arithmetic and geometry in120 verses, while adhyaya 18, thekuttakddhydya, discusses the pulverizer, of whose use it gives manyexamples, in 70verses. This treatment isclearly modelled on the BSS. More closely based onthe same prototype, though of shorter extent, are the two adhydyas devoted to mathematics in the S&S" composed by Sripati in about 1040: adhyaya 13, vyaktaganita, onpdtl in 55 verses, and adhyaya 14, avyaktaganita, onalgebra in37 verses. Many of the verses of SSS 13 appear as sutras in fSrlpati's Ganitatilaka30 to which many examples (some taken from Sridhara) have been added. Unfortunately, however, the Ganitatilaka does not survive inits entirety. After aparibhdsd modelled on Mahavira's, itproceeds in the normal order, though inserting the mathematics ofzero inverse 45, in the middle of its treatment of fractions; this mathematics of zero differs from that in S$!§ 14,6.The text breaks off in themiddle ofthe misrakavyavahdra. A commentary onthe Ganitatilaka was written by Simhatilaka Suri, thepupil of Vibudhacandra; this Simhatilaka wrote a vrtti onthe Bhuvanadipaka of Padmaprabha Suri at Vijapura in 1269. Perhaps contemporary with Srlpati was the mathematician Jayadeva.31 Though none ofhis works are nowextant, a quotation inthe Sundarl composed by Udayadivakara in 1073 proves that heknew the cyclic solution (cakravdla) of Pell's equation—that is, of indeterminate equations of the second degree (vargaprakrti) for which Brahmagupta possessed a partial solution. Jayadeva's solution was independently discovered in the West in the seventeenth century. The second Bhaskara, to whom this cakravdla has sometimes been erroneously attributed, wrote two works onmathematics in the middle ofthe twelfth century.

bhasya); by Krparama at Ahmadabad in 1792 (BalabodhinI); and by an obscure Nijananda50 (Bijalavala). After Bhaskara the next major authority on mathematics was Narayana,51 who completed his GanitakaumudI52 in 1356. TheGK contains the traditional paribhdsd, parikarmas, and vyavahdras, followed by the pulverizer, "Pell's equation," factors,53 combinations, and magic squares. Before writing the GK Narayana had written a work on algebra, the Bijaganitavatamsa.51 This work covers arithmetical operations involving positive and negative numbers and zero; irrational numbers; the pulverizer and "Pell's equation" (these two were drawn upon for the corresponding section in the GK); various kinds of linear and quadratic equations with one or more unknowns (the text is not extant beyond the beginning of the section onlinear equations); and equations involving the product of different unknowns. Thus it is modeled directly on the BG. Sometime after Bhaskara one Devaraja55 composed a Kuttakarasiromani,56 on which he wrote his owntlkd, entitled Mahalaksmlmuktavall. His objective was to expand upon the pulverizer as propounded by Aryabhata. Also subsequent to Bhaskara Ramacandra wrote a Kautukalllavati.57 In this work, after the paribhdsd, come problems of plane and solid geometry and estimates of the quantities of various substances in differently shaped containers; involved are, among other things, specific gravities. Traditional mathematics was continued in the sixteenth century by the Bijadhyaya of Jfianaraja, who wrote the SSJ in 1503 and wasthe father of Suryadasa, the commentator on Bhaskara's L and BG; and by the Ganitamanjarl of Jftanaraja's great nephew, Gane^a.58 Neither of these works has been published. Except for commentaries, no significant traditional Sanskrit works on mathematics were written after the sixteenth century. At Jayasimha's court at Jayapura, however, in the 1720's and 1730's, an effort was made to translate Arabic and Persian versions of Greek mathematical treatises into Sanskrit.

Mathematics in astronomy
The mathematics utilized inastronomical texts is most developed in the areas of analemmata and oftrigonometry—as well as, ofcourse, the application of the pulverizer to astronomical problems that we have already considered. Some of the most significant mathematical work undertaken in India was in connection with trigonometry.61 Briefly, after the initial success in constructing tables of Sines and Versines and ininventing arule for rinding the approximate Sine ofany angle inthefifth through seventh centuries, thenext advance was the discovery by thesecond Bhaskara of the formula for theaddition of Sines. The more advanced trigonometry of the seventeenth and eighteenth century astronomers of northern India seems tobe due tothe influence of al-Kashi and Ulugh Beg. But in Kerala truly extraordinary advances were made bya schoolof astronomer-mathematicians building on thepioneering work of Madhava of Sangamagrama in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth century. He evidently discovered what is called "Gregory's Series" for TTand thepower series for sines andcosines associated with Newton andLeibniz.62 Madhava's workwas

CHAPTER IV
DIVINATION
Omens (adbhuta, utpdta, nimitta) have probably always been regarded by Indians, as by others, as a means of knowing the future. There are, for instance, various references in the Rgveda (II 42—43and X 165) and in the Atharvaveda (VI 27—29 and VII 64) to an ominous bird (iakuna). But the earliest attempts1 to list and classify omens and to provide their ritual countermeasures (ddnti) occur in the Kausikasutra2 (XIII = JcandiJcds 93—136) of the Atharvaveda and the common source3 of the Adbhutabrahmana, which is adhyaya VI or V of the Sadvimsabrahmana,4 the Asvalayanagrhyaparisista5 (IV 11—22), and the Adbhutasanti6 of the Atharvavedaparis"ista. The omens in this latter source were associated with the seven deities Indra, Varuna, Yama, Agni, Vaisravana, Visnu, and Vayu, and involve phenomena occurring on the earth, in the atmosphere, and in the heavens. One cannot but be struck by the similarity of these omens with their ddnti rituals to the Babylonian omens with their namburbi rituals, though no exact parallels exist since the Indian omens are without apodoses. It is possible, however, though not demonstrable, that the original of these three Sanskrit texts was at least in part dependent on a Mesopotamian prototype that reached India slightly before or after the Achaemenid occupation of Gandhara in the sixth century B.C.7 Much clearer is the transmission of Mesopotamian omen texts—both protases and apodoses—to India in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., for the contemporary Sanskrit and Prakrit literature is replete with references to and

examples of such omens.8 They are related mainly to twocuneiform series: Summa alu,9 which deals with terrestrial omens affecting individuals, and Enuma Anu Enlil,10 which deals with atmospheric and celestial omens affecting countries or their rulers. TheBuddha wasrepresented in the Dighanikaya (I 1,24)as condemning theBrahmanas who earn their living from theuseless knowledge ofomens, but, in a later Buddhist story, the Sardulakarnavadana,11 written probably in the first century A.D., the display by an outcaste ofa knowledge of astral omens similar to those of Enuma AnuEnlil andof the mathematical astronomy adapted from Babylonia by Lagadha is used to establish theoutcaste's equality with a Brahmana. The earliest version of this avaddna includes sections on the characteristics of the native born when the Moon is in each naksatra (61—62); thecharacter and/or fate of an individual or people if a city is entered when theMoon is in each naksatra (pp. 62—67; in verse); a list of the countries andregions of India dominated by each naksatra (pp. 67—68); the affect on the country if the first rainfall in the last month ofgrisma (summer) occurs astheMoon is in each naksatra (pp. 68—79); what a lunar eclipse in each naksatra portends (pp.79—81); actions tobe accomplished when the Moon is in each naksatra (pp.81—98; in verse); a similar description of actions to be undertaken when the Moon is in one of seven categories of naksatras12 (pp. 98—99; mixed prose andverse); prognostications from thenaksatra occupied bytheMoon ontheoccasion ofan earthquake andfrom other phenomena associated with earthquakes (pp. 108—123; in verse); thecourse ofa disease that begins when the Moon isin each naksatra (pp. 123—128; inverse); inhow long a period of time a prisoner will bereleased if he is bound when theMoon is in each naksatra (pp. 128—129); andthe fate of a woman depending on the part ofher body that bears a tilaka (pp. 129—132; in verse). All ofthis material was translated into Chinese byChu Luh-yenand Che K'ien inthe Kingdom ofWu inabout 250, and most ofit by Dharmaraksa at Lo-yan in about 300.13 Before theSardulakarnavadana hadbeen translated into Tibetan byAjitasribhadra andSakyaprabha in about 864 there hadbeen

MOBEN, The Omen Series Summa Alu: A Preliminary Investigation, University of Pennsylvania 1978. 10 E. F. WEIDNER, "Die astrologische Serie Enuma Anu Enlil," AfO 14 (1941/44), 172—195 and 308—318; 17 (1954/56), 71—89; and 22 (1968/69), 65—75. See alsc the new edition of the stellar omens being prepared by E. REINER and D. PINGREE, Babylonian Planetary Omens, of which two fascicles have appeared (Malibu 1975 and 1981). 11 Edited by S. MTJKHOPADHYAYA, Santiniketan 1954. 12 As it stands the text discusses only the categories dhruva (fixed), ksipra (swift), and ddruna (sharp); the rest can be supplied from such texts as the Parasaratantra (see D. PINGREE in Viator 7 (1976), 175). 13 The translation into Chinese made by An Shi-kao in about 150 contains only a brief summary of the story without the elaborate astronomical and omen sections.

added to it a second chapter on the native born as the Moon is in each naksatra (naksatrajanmaguna) (pp. 132—135; in verse). At an even later date the Sanskrit text was expanded by the addition of a number of chapters on omens, most of which are in verse. Their subjects include utpdtas—primarily celestial or atmospheric phenomena affecting or associated with the Sun or the Moon in specific naksatras and/or months or paksas (pp. 136—147); birth-marks (pinya ?) resulting from the naksatra occupied by the Moon at the time of the native's birth (pp. 147—151); boils or pimples (pitaka) as omens (pp. 151—154); two chapters on oneiromancy (pp. 154—164); astral and atmospheric omens in each month (pp. 164—166; in prose); omens from the wagtail (khanjaritaka) (pp. 166—167); from the howling of the jackal (sivdruta) (pp. 167—171; in prose); palmistry (pdnilekhd) (pp. 172—175); omens from the cawing of crows (vdyasaruta) (pp. 175—180); omens from the shape and appearance of a house (dvdralaksana) (pp. 180—182); determining the thought of the client from his touching by chance one of twelve circles drawn by the astrologer (pp. 183—187); the qualities of a maiden having various physical features (kanydlaksana) (pp. 187—191); garments as the Moon is in each naksatra (p. 192); the omens used for agriculture (pp. 193—197); supernatural beings (pp. 197—200; very corrupt); omens from smoke (dhumika) (p. 201); and actions to be undertaken on each tithi of a paksa (tithikarma) (pp. 201—203). Thus, to the original contents of the omen sections of the text, which depend almost exclusively on the naksatra occupied by the Moon, have been appended the most heterogeneous material relating to dreams, physiognomy, the cries of animals and birds, and so on. All of these forms of omens, of course, occur in other texts. The earliest extant such text is the first version of the Gargasamhita,14 a work probably written in the first century B.C. or A.D. and taking the form of a dialogue between Kraustuki (Rsiputra) and Garga. This vast, unpublished text originally contained some sixty-two angas. The first three utilize the Moon and the naksatras, and are related to the omens of the original Sardulakarnavadana; karmaguna (on actions undertaken at specified times), candramdna, and naksatrakendrabha. The next nine (angas 4—12) deal with the motion of celestial bodies—the Moon's node (Rahu), Jupiter, Venus, comets (Ketu), Saturn, Mars, Mercury, the Sun, and Canopus (Agastya). There follow four (angas 13—16) on the circles (cakra) of intermediate directions (antara), deer (mrga), dogs (svd), and winds (vdta). Then come three (angas 17—19) sciences (vidyd)— of houses (vdstu), of limbs (anga), and of crows (vdyasa)-Sind three (angas 20—22) conjunctions of the Moon with the naksatras Svati, Asadha, and Rohinl. Anga 23 lists the countries dominated by each naksatra, and anga 24 gives prognostications involving rainfall. The following seven (angas 25—31) are devoted to the planets—the things they influence (kosa), their conjunctions

(samdgama), their amrddaksinya (is this abhrddarsana, "obscuration by clouds" ?), their conflicts (yuddha), their configurations beginning with the "triangle" yoga (srngdtaka), their "traditions" (purdna), and the ripening (pdka) of their effects. Then come three (angas 32—34) on military omens; they are expeditions (ydtrd), fire omens (agni), and the array of the army (sendvyuha). The next two (angas 35 and 36) are entitled "variegation of the peacock" (mayuracitra) and "lotus of the world" (bhuvanapuskara). There follow two (angas 37 and 38) on rituals: the offering of oblations (balyupahdra) and the performance of idnti rites. Anga 39 is a collection of various omens (utpdta) portending disaster to countries; and anga 40 is entitled "the treasure on the scales" (tuldko&a). Anga 41 is the well known historical prophecy, the Yugapurana.15 In anga 42 are collected omens based on the cries (ruta) of various birds and animals: crows (vdyasa), woodpeckers (iatapattra), bluejays (cdsa), cranes (sdrasa), pesamas or pesamds (?), cows (dakkarikd), peacocks (mayiira), visphotls (?), cirinl-crows, skylarks (bhdradvdja), doves (kapoti), cuckoos (kokila), vultures (iakuni), owls (uluka), pingald-owls, peahens (nartakd), sundarikds (?), partridges (tittiri), cats (biddla), hares (iaiaka), asses (gardabha), vixens (lomaSd), bulls (vrsabha), lopd-birds, and spotted antelopes (prsata). There follows a section (anga 43) on tears in garments. The next (anga 44)is entitled "thetradition (purdna) of Brhaspati (or of Jupiter)." Anga 45 presents omens involving "Indra's banner" (indradhvaja). The next five (angas 46—50) employ as omens the characteristics of several kinds of animals—rams, tortoises, women, elephants, and cows. Anga 51 is entitled "the appearance (samsthdna) of Venus." There follows a section (anga 52)on the "pregnancy" (garbha) of the clouds before the beginning of the rainy season, and then comes one (anga 53) on water divining (dakdrgala). The next group of five chapters (angas 54—58) deals with "atmospheric" phenomena: violent storms (nirghdta), earthquakes (bhumikampa), halos (parivesa) around the Sun and the Moon, meteors (ulkd), and halos again. Anga 59 is on the nature of the seasons (rtusvabhdva), but the next (anga 60) is devoted to omens occurring at dawn or evening (sandhyd). Anga 61 is a second chapter on meteors. And finally, anga 62 describes the naksatra melothesia of the celestial purusa. A mayuracitraka on various utpdtas is appended to the text. This vast panoply of omens, a very large number of which can be paralleled in cuneiform texts, has been extraordinarily influential on Indian life and

literature. Parts have been used by the authors of the Mahabharata and of some of the purdnas; and omens in general have become as important an aspect of life in India as they were in Mesopotamia. The technical texts on divination (usually entitled samhitd) are to a large extent dependent on the Gargasamhita; of these the most important is the Brhatsamhita of Varahamihira, which will be described below. It was also used with other texts by the composer of several of the Parisistas of the Atharvaveda; these are: L on lunar omens (candraprdtipadika; cf. GS 2—3), LI on planetary conflicts {grahayuddha; cf. GS 28), LII on planetary conjunctions {grahasangraha;cf. GS 26), LIII on the motion of the Moon's node (rdhucdra; cf. GS 4), LIV on the motion of comets (ketucdra; ascribed to Bhargava, but cf. GS 7), LV on seasonal comets (rtuketulaksana), LVI on the distribution of the countries on the back of the "tortoise" earth among the naksatras (kurmavibhdga; cf. GS 23), LVII on the "circles" among the naksatras of Agni, Vayu, Varuna, and Mahendra (mandaIdni), LVIII on the "burning of the directions" (digddha), LVIIIb on meteors and falling stars (ulku; cf. GS 57 and 61), LIX on lightning (vidyut), LX on violent storms (nirghdta; cf. GS 54), LXI on omens occurring at dawn or evening ((sandhyd}; cf. GS 60), LXII on earthquakes (bhumikampa; cf. GS 55), LXIII on halos {<parivesa>; cf. GS 56 and 58), LXIV on utpdtas (cf. GS 39), LXV on sudden rainstorms (sadyovrsti), and LXVIII on oneiromancy (svapna).
There are several other works entitled Gargasamhita, x at of these only one—the second GS16—deals with omens. It belongs to a class of samhitds attributed to rsis that lie intermediate between omen texts and texts on muhurtasdstra. They will be described in a later section. Several of the works associated with Garga contain sections on meteorological predictions, and particularly on the prediction of the rains. A separate work on that subject attributed to Garga, the Meghamala,17 has also been preserved. The phenomena utilized include winds, clouds, mock Suns (pratisurya), halos, violent storms, and eclipses. Another Meghamala is ascribed to Siva. To Garga is also attributed a work on a form of divination also known in Mesopotamia, that from falling lizards. It bears several titles, all variations on Palllsaratapatanavidhana.18 Similar texts are ascribed to other rsis such as JSaunaka. In the early fourth century Garga was named as an authority on omens along with Parasara19 by Mlnaraja in his Vrddhayavanajataka (67, 5). This Parasara is undoubtedly the one cited by Varahamihira concerning the motion of Mercury (BS 7, 8); as an authority on comets along with Garga, Asita,20 and

Devala21 (BS 11, 1); concerning planetary conflicts (BS 17, 3); as an authority, together with Garga, Kasyapa,22 and Vajra, on the "pregnancy" of clouds (BS 21, 2);asagreeing with Garga andVasistha on the extent ofthe areaon which a predicted rain will fall (BS23, 4); asone ofthe experts, along with Brhaspati,23 Garga, Kasyapa, and Maya24 on theMoon's conjunction with Rohini (BS24, 2); and as addressing his discussion of the characteristics of cows to Brhadratha (BS60, 1). Thework of Parasara onomens is probably the lost prose and verse Parasaratantra cited frequently by Bhattotpala in his commentary onthe BS. The omen section of Minaraja's VYJ comprises adhydyas 64—71, which are respectively onsigns ofdeath, on counter-omens to evil portents, ononeiromancy, onvarious omens, onthe cawing of crows, on the cuckoo laying eggs (sydmdceslita), onthe activities of dogs (svdcestita), and on the activities of cows (gocestita). Other early authorities on omens mentioned by Varahamihira, andtherefore antedating the middle of the sixth century, include25 Atri26 on utpdtas, which was used by Garga (BS 45, 1); Rsabha,27 who summarized the views of &akra (Indra28), Sukra (Bhrgu), Vagisa (Brhaspati), Kapisthala,29 Garutman,30 Bhaguri,31 and Devala on sakuna (BS 85, 1); the Maharajadhiraja of Avanti, Dravyavardhana,32 whowas an authority on sakuna (he was probably anAulikara monarch ruling inabout 500) (BS 85, 2);Narada on comets (BS 11, 5)andas Brhaspati's student regarding the Moon's conjunction with Rohini (BS 24,2) (this Narada is different from the author ofthe currently available Naradasamhita, but Varahamihira may have inmind Narada's Mayuracitraka); Badarayana33 onthe ripening of grain (BS 39,1); Bhrgu34 on sakuna (BS85, 43);Manu35 on water divining (BS53, 99); and Sarasvata, also on water-divining (BS 53, 99).

The wealth of information on the material, social, and religious life ofIndia both inVarahamihira's own timeand in earlier periods (the latter can beassessed only bycomparing theBS with the GS and their Babylonian sources) contained intheBS is obviously enormous.41 The popularity ofthe BS was great, though the vastness ofthe text precluded much commentarial work. Thechief effort in that direction that wepossess is the extremely valuable vivrti completed by Bhattotpala in Kasmlra in967; based on Bhattotpala's work isthe Utpalaparimala composed byBhaskararya Yogin42 at Siirariga onthe Kaverl in 1235. TheBSwith Bhattotpala's vivrti was read by al-Blrunl inthe Panjab in preparation for writing hisIndia in 1030/1031.

and there seems to exist a paraphrase in Simhalese.45 Varahamihira himself wrote an abridgement, the Samasasamhita,46 of which only quotations, notably in Bhattotpala's vivrti on the BS, now survive. Probably not far in time from Varahamihira an unnamed Jaina composed an immense work in Prakrit on omens entitled Angavijja,47 wrhich classifies every perceptible object in the world as a ominous entity. I t remains an inadequately explored treasure ofthe material aspects of Indian culture.

The subjects notdirectly corresponding to Varahamihira's that Bhadrabahu takes up are lightning (BBS 5; cf. Parisista LIX); clouds (BBS 6 and 8; cf. second GS 14);military expeditions (BSS13; cf. GS 32); planetary omens (BBS 25); and oneiromancy (BBS 26; cf. VYJ 66). A third Jaina text (though some manuscripts make it Saiva) written in this period is by Garga,51 who is usually identified with theguru named by Siddharsi in 905; this is variously titled Pasakevali,52 Marutajfianaprasna, etc. I t is an elaborate treatise ondivination by means of dice, giving theinterpretation of each of the combinations of three of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and4, in all possible orders.

Though Bhattotpala quotes from both Narada (on BS 11, 5) and Vasistha (on BS 5, 3; 32, 2; and 57, 8) in his vivrti on the BS, none of these citations occurs in the currently available Naradasamhita and Vasisthasamhita; the relation of his citations of verses of Brhaspati (on BS 35, 3; 52, 2—3; and 52, 87—88) to the extant Brhaspatisamhita53 cannot as yet be determined. Other authorities on omens whom Bhattotpala was able to quote in 967 include Nandin,54 Bhanubhatta,55 and Salihotra, as well as the authority, Samudra, after whom the science of ph3~siognomy was later named sdmudrika (on BS 67 and 69). Al-BirunI, in his India (14), lists the names of seven authors of samhitds: Mandavya,58 Parasara, Garga, Brahman,57 Balabhadra, Divyatattva,58 and Varahamihira. Of these authors, Balabhadra and Divyatattva are not known from Sanskrit sources to have composed samhitds, though there is an Adbhutatarangini on omens by a Balabhadra.59 Vasantaraja composed his Sakunarnava60 at or near VaranasI in the 1090's since he dedicated it to the Gahadavala Candradeva (ca. 1089—ca. 1103). In a verse toward the beginning (1, 27) he names as his predecessors Atri, Garga, Guru (Brhaspati), Sukra (Bhrgu), Vasistha, Vyasa, Kautsa (perhaps Angiras61), Bhrgu, and Gautama.62 Its twenty vargas give omens from the cries and movements of birds and animals. A tiled, was written by Bhanucandra Gani63 of the Tapagaccha in about 1559 in the empire of Akbar (1556—1605); it was edited by Bhanucandra's pupil, Siddhicandra. In about 1160 Durlabharaja,64 a scion of the Pragvata family of Gujarat who was made a mahattara by the Caulukya Kumarapala (ca. 1143—1152), began a Samudrikatilaka65 that was finished by his son, Jagaddeva.66 This is the earliest complete Sanskrit text on physiognomy and palmistry that we possess, though we have seen that the subject was earlier treated in the Sardulakarnavadana (pp. 129-132, 147-154, 172-175, and 187-191), the GS (18 and 48), the BS (50, 51, 67, and 69), and other texts.

(in 1, 9) tothe authors whose names we have already encountered Laksaka and Sumanta, of whom nothing further is known, and the famous Paramara Bhojaraja ofDhara, whose work on sdmudrikahas not survived. Durlabharaja's son, Jagaddeva, besides completing his father's Samudrikatilaka, wrote an important treatise on oneiromancy, the Svapnacintamani,67 in about 1175. Again, though this isthe earliest independent treatise on svapna that we possess, the interpretation of dreams goes back inSanskrit literatureto the Rgveda,68 and had been treated systematically since at least thetimeof Minaraja (VYJ 66).69 Aside from some oneiromancies preserved in various purdnas—e.g., Matsyapurana 241 and Brahmavaivartapurana, Krsnajanmakhanda 77and82—the most common Sanskrit text on theinterpretation of dreams is the Svapnadhyaya attributed to Brhaspati.70 Contemporary with Durlabharaja and Jagaddeva was Narapati,71 who completed his Narapatijayacarya orSvarodaya72 at Anahilanagara in Saurastra in 1177. This work describes various arrangements (cakras) ofletters associated with time divisions and astrological entities, magical pictures of animals and objects (also called cakras), and arrangements of naksatras, months, and numbers relative tothe directions (bhumis), all ofwhich promote the military victory of their user. Narapati names as hissources (1, 4—10) sevenydmalas (of Brahma, Visnu, Rudra, Adi, Skanda, Kurma, and Devi), the Yuddhajayarnava, the Svarabhairava, the Ranahvayatantra, the Jayapaddliati, and various other tantric texts. The NJwas commented on by Narahari73 during the reign of Bhairavendra, who ruled Mithila from ca. 1480 till ca. 1515 (Vyakhyaplava), and by Harivam&a Pathaka inca. 1500 (Jayalaksmi); the latter was revised by Harivamsa's son, Mahadeva,74 in 1520.

Contemporaneously with the three authors from Saurastra the Maharajadhiraja of Bengal from ca. 1159till 1178,Ballalasena,77 began his Adbhutasagara78 in 1168; it wascompleted by his son and successor, Laksmanasena, who ruled Bengal from ca. 1178 till 1200. It deals with most of the celestial, atmospheric, and terrestrial omens in a comprehensive fashion, andis the next most popular text in this field after the BS. A similar text, which is probably at least in part dependent on Ballalasena's, is the Adbhutadarpana of Madhava.79 Treatments of omens in the thirteenth century were rare except among the Jainas of Gujarat and Rajasthan. There are scattered references in the Trailokyaprakasa written by Hemaprabha Suri probably in 1248, a work which will be discussed more fully below. And in 1281 Manikya Suri80 composed a Sakunasaroddhara. A Hindu, Lavanyasarman, was the author of a Sakunapradlpa;81 he himself copied a manuscript of it at Vijapura in 1344.82 In some manuscripts of the gigantic Jyotirnibandha composed by Sivaraja between ca. 1475 and 1500 there is inserted a cdrddhydya;83 this is based almost entirely on Varahamihira's BS (3—13, 17—18, and 20) with a few quotations from the samhitds of Kasyapa, Narada, and Vasistha. Slightly before Sivaraja, in about 1450,Ramacandra wrote at Naimisa in Uttarapradesa a Samarasara84 similar in intent andcontents to Narapati's NJ. There are commentaries composed by Ramacandra himself together with his brother, Bharata85 (Sarala), by Damodara86 (Sanketamaiijari), and by Diksita Samvatsara.87 Other works on svarasdstra include the Yuddhajayotsava of Gangarama88 andthe Pavanavijaya or Svarodaya attributed to Siva. Other cakras are used in interpreting nativities by Prajapatidasa,89 who wrote his Pancasvaranirnaya or Granthasangraha90 before 1625 (theearliest manuscript

There are commentaries by Prajapatidasa himself as well as by Appaya Diksita91 and Gauda Bhattacarya.92 To Mahadeva93 is ascribed a Pancapaksisakuna94 employing the five European vowels for divination; the oldest dated manuscript containing this work was copied in 1750. A related text is the Tattvarthacintamani95 composed together with a vrtti by Balakrsna Vedavrksa96 at Kasi in the 1820's. But a more important author on omens had flourished a century and a half earlier. The Jaina scholar Meghavijaya97 wrote a Varsaprabodha98 similar to the Meghamalas of Garga and Siva in 1675 and a Hastasanjivana" on palmistry in 1680; in this same year he completed a commentary on the latter work. There are, of course, numerous other anonymous works on omens or works attributed to authors of whom nothing is known extant in Sanskrit and vernacular manuscripts. Nothing further can be said of them in the absence of editions and of critical historical studies. However, one important method of divination that we cannot fail to mention is geomancy (ramala, from the Arabic raml), which seems to have been introduced into Sanskrit from Persian sources in the early Mughal period. The principal texts on the subject are the Ramalavaicitrya or Ramalabhaskara100 of Rama based on the teachings of the Yavanas (Muslims) (the oldest dated manuscript was copied in 1657); the Ramalenduprakas'a composed by Rudramani Tripathin in 1682; the Ramalarahasya101 written by Bhayabhanjana barman102 in about 1700; the Ramalotkarsa or Ramalacintamani of Cintamani103 (the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1709); the Ramalasara composed by Sripati at Gokula (the oldest dated manuscript was copied in 1718); and the Ramalanavaratna104 composed by Paramasukha105 at Kasi in 1811.

CHAPTER V
GENETHLIALOGY
Jataka
Though already as a part of divination Indians hadfor long predicted the characteristics ofa native on the basis ofthe naksatra occupied by the Moonat his birth (e.g., Sardulakarnavadana, pp. 61—62), the prediction of the life of the native on the basis of the horoscope cast at hisbirth—a science thatwas developed inHellenistic Egypt inthe second century B.C—was introduced into India only inthe second century A.D. In 149/150, probably at the court ofthe Western Ksatrapa Rudradaman in UjjayinI, a Greek manuscript of an astrological text composed in Egypt shortly after 100A.D. was translated into Sanskrit prose by the head ofthe Greek community, who was entitled Yavanesvara. Already in this translation the Hellenistic system had begun to be Hinduized—for instance, the pictures of the Decans andHours that adorned the Greek manuscript were interpreted by YavanesVara interms ofthe iconography of Siva andParvati.1 Unfortunately, weno longer have Yavanesvara's translation, butwe dopossess a very substantial portion ofa versification of it made by the <Yavana>raja Sphujidhvaja in 269/270, during the reign of the Western Ksatrapa Rudrasena II. His Yavanajataka2 shows further signs of Hinduization; inparticular one suspects that hewas responsible foradding the chapter on reincarnation (YJ 43), the lists of minerals, plants, and animals that areinfluenced by ayurvedic materia medica (YJ62), andthe section on military astrology that is indebted to such sources astheGS (YJ 73—76). The original Greek system was of course further modified so that the predictions fit the social andeconomic expectations of people born in India, and Indian astrologers after Sphujidhvaja considerably developed genethlialogy by emphasizing some aspects at theexpense of others or by creating new andmore complex techniques ofinterpreting horoscopes; but basically all ofjatakabefore the introduction of tdjika texts in the thirteenth century, and even most of jatakaafter that, can betraced back to the Yavanajataka and to the lost work

of Satya, who had access to at least one other Sanskrit translation of a Greek text on genethlialogy besides the YJ. Sphujidhvaja's YJ contains seventy-nine adhydyas, which may be divided into five sections: on nativities (YJ 1—51), on prasna or interrogations (YJ 52—72), on ydtrd or military astrology (YJ 73—76), on muhurta or catarchic astrology (YJ 77—78), and on mathematical astronomy (YJ 79). We have already discussed the last section in the chapter on astronomy; here we shall only review the contents of the first, reserving sections two-four for the relevant chapters of this book. YJ 1 describes the fundamental elements of genethlialogy—the zodiacal signs (rdsis) and their subdivisions (hords [copa], drekdnas [Sexavot], saptdmsas, navdtnsas,3 dvddasdmsas [ScoSsxaTTjpiopia], trimsdmsas [opta], sauras, cuddpadas, and liptikas [kzma.]); the astrological places (bhdvas), categorized as cardines {kendras;xsvrpa), succeedent (pdnapharas; ETravacpopou), and cadents (dpoklimas; ); the planets' exaltations (uccas); their triplicities (trikonas; ; their aspects (drsti); the various strengths of the zodiacal signs and planets; and the characteristics, spheres of influence, and interrelationships of the planets. The next two adhydyas (YJ 2—3) describe respectively the figures associated with each of the twenty-four hords and thirty-six decans. And adhydya 4 lists the objects associated with the zodiacal signs and the planets. The next two chapters deal with conception and gestation (YJ 5), and the circumstances of birth (YJ 6). In adhydya 7 Sphujidhvaja describes the effects on the natives of the planets being in their exaltations or dejections, in their triplicities, in their own, their friends', or their enemies' houses. Adhydyas 8—9 are devoted to the astrological situations that lead to the birth of kings and other leaders. The four yogas of the Moon—sunaphd (cruva^vj), anaphard (avacpopa), daurudhara (Sopucpopia), and kemadruma (xevoSpopiia)—are discussed in adhydya 10, the two of the Sun—vesi and vdsi (cpacjig) in adhydya 11. There follow seven chapters (YJ 12—18) on the native born when each of the planets (in the order Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Moon) is in each of the zodiacal signs. Adhydya 19 is on the effect of each of the zodiacal signs in the ascendant, adhydya 20 on that of each of the planets. There follows a section on conjunctions of planets: of two and three planets in YJ 21, of four planets (producing religious natives) inYJ 22, of five planets in YJ 23, and of six and seven planets in YJ 24. The next two chapters (YJ 25—26) enumerate the effects of each of the planets' being in each of the places except the ascendent. In adhydya 27 Sphujidhvaja describes three melothesias: of planets, of hords, and of decans. There follow four adhydyas (YJ 28—31) on the native born when each hord, decan, saptdmsa, and navdmsa is in the ascendent. Adhydyas 32 and 33 are on the Moon's and all the other planets' being in each others' navdmsas, and adhydya 34 on each of the planets in a dvddasdmsa of each of the zodiacal
3 On the Indian decans and navdmsas in Sasanian, Arabic, Byzantine, and Latin

signs. In YJ 35 Sphujidhvaja very obscurely deals with the theory of the prorogator (<x<psTy]<;)—a topic ignored by subsequent Indian astrologers until it was reintroduced as the hilldja (Arabic hayldj) in tdjika texts. There is then inserted a chapter (YJ 36) on the planetary configurations known as yogas. Adhydyas 37—43 are concerned with the computation of the length of the native's life (dyurddya; YJ 37), with fatal configurations (aristayoga; YJ 38), with the periods (dasds) and subperiods (antardas'ds) of the native's life (YJ 39—41), with the cause of his death (YJ 42), and with his next incarnation (YJ 43). There follows a long section (YJ 44—51) on astakavarga or the transits of each of the planets (in the order Sun, Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Mercury, and Moon) through the astrological places counted from themselves, from each other, and from the ascendant; this is a fundamental method of continuous horoscopy. Sphujidhvaja's treatment of jdtaJca ends with a description of the ideal astrologer (YJ51, 13-20). In large measure based on the YJ, but also dependent on the lost work of Satya,4 is the Vrddhayavanajataka5 composed by the Yavanadhiraja Mmaraja6 in about 300—325 in the realm of the Western Ksatrapas—that is, during the reign of Rudrasimha I I (ca. 305—317) or Yasodaman II (ca. 317—332). This is probably the Avork called Yavana referred to by al-Birum (India 14). It is an immense text, twice as long as the YJ, divided into seventy-one adhydyas; the last eight, as we have already noted, are concerned with omens. The rest to a large extent repeat and expand upon the YJ.7 The remainder deal with the effect of each planet (in the order of the week-days, as henceforth is normal in Sanskrit texts) in each zodiacal sign aspected by each other planet (VYJ 9—15); on the effects of the planets in each astrological place while in various of its vargas (VYJ 24—35); on the ascendant aspected by each of the planets (VYJ 36); on the lord of each astrological place in its own and every other place (VYJ 54); and on the "rays" (rasmi) of the planets (VYJ 56). Only once—in an astrological digvijaya (VYJ 2, 9—10)—does Minaraja mention Rahu as a graha; Sphujidhvaja never does. The inclusion of Rahu and Ketu among the planets to make them nine postdates the VYJ.
4 The details of the dependence of Indian astrologers on the Y J and on each other will be found in my edition of Sphujidhvaja. 5 Edited by D. PINGREE as GOS 162—163, Baroda 1976; adhydyas 1—34 with a Hindi tlkd were published by RAMASVARUPA &ARMAN, New Delhi 1976. • CESS A 4.

composed his vivarana atVaranasI in 1599; Krsna,19 Gadadhara Misra,20 and two Paramesvaras (Jatakacandrika21 and Horabhiprayanirnaya).22 Both Rudra and Mahidhara have copied out much of the Jagaccandrika. Varahamihira also wrote asummary ofthe BJ,theLaghujataka,23 in sixteen adhyayas. There is the inevitable commentary, the Sisyahita, written by Bhattotpala in Kasmira in 966;there are also commentaries composed by Mahesvara,24 thefather of Bhaskara, intheSahyadri in ca. 1100; by Ananta25 in 1534; andby Isvaramisra26 (Dipika).

Moreover, it was used byKalyanavarman, who wrote in ca. 800 (BPH purva 2, 49—52 = S 5, 21-24; andBPH purva 21, 17-48 equal S21, 21-52; cf. S 21, 6),and its existence ispresupposed by theauthor of the uttarakhanda, which was commented onby Govindasvamin in ca. 850.Therefore, the purvakhanda must have been written between ca. 600and 750, and the uttarakhanda after thepurvakhanda but before ca. 800. The purvakhanda in fifty-one adhyayas is arich but confused collection ofmaterial, much ofwhich is unprecedented: the basic

elements of astrology (2—3); aspects (4); the nature of the neonate native (5—7); the planetary operators (kdraka) (8—9); the astrological places (10); the mounted places (drudha) and their next places (upapada) (11—12); the killer (maroka) planets (13); the astrological places and their lords (14—15); curses in previous incarnations (purvajanmasdpa) (16); astakavarga (15—20); ndbhasa and other yogas (21—22); smashing the killer planet (mdrakabheda) (23); dyurddya (24—25); death (26—27); rdjayogas and yogas leading to wealth and poverty (28—31); rebirths (32); pleasure and sorrow (33); various conditions (avasthds) of the planets (34); the varieties of dasds, including vimsottari, sodaSottarl, dvddasottari, astottari, pancottarl, satdbdikd, caturasityabdikd, dvisaptatikd, sastihdyani, and sattrimsatkd (35) ;29 vimsottarldaids (36); antardaSds and their subdivisions: upadasds, siiksmadas'as, and prdnadasds (37—48); Icdlacakradasds (49); caradasds (50); and the sudarsanacakra (51).
This congeries seems to consist of an original core, characterized by its being cast in the form of a dialogue between Maitreya and Parasara, and various accretions. These latter may include: adhydyas 5—6, 13—14, and 17—23, which are not dialogues and contain no vocatives; adhydya 16, which is in the form of a dialogue between Parvati and Sankara; adhydya 33, which is in the form of a dialogue between Sujanma and Lomasa; adhydyas 36—48, which are spoken by Parasara for the benefit of Mahesvara; and adhydyas 49—51, which are attributed to Parvati. The elimination of at least adhydyas 16, 33, and 49—51 would produce a more homogeneous text; but the precise extent of the purvakhanda must await a careful study of the manuscripts and of its relation to other texts—not only to the uttarakhanda and to Kalyanavarman, but also to Bhattotpala's tlkd on the BJ from which some of its verses seem to be derived. The uttarakhanda, which is also a dialogue between Maitreya and Parasara, is a much more unified composition, and its integrity is guaranteed by Govindasvamin's commentary. It deals with astakavarga (1; cf. purva 17—23), the six kinds of planetary strength (sadbala) (2); computing planetary strength (istakastavarnana) (3); rasmi (4; cf. VYJ 56); the native's passage through this world (lokaydtrd) (5—9); dyurddya (10—12; cf. purva 24—25); good fortune (bhdgya) (13); time units and the fruition of astrological indications (14—17); interrogations (prasna) (18); and, in conclusion, a table of contents (19) and a praise of the work (20). The uttarakhanda was commented on by Govindasvamin in Kerala in about 850 (Prakatarthadipika), while the whole BPH was commented on by Sridhara and Harikrsna at Jayapura in about 1875. Despite the questionability of the authenticity of some parts of the purvakhanda, the BPH represents some notable developments in the long process by which the original Hellenistic astrology that was transmitted to India in the second century was made increasingly complex so as to generate predictions more closely approximating reality; these developments are particularly noticeable in the theories of ay urdaya.dasds, and the computation of planetary strength.

A more traditional work, but one of great importance, is the Saravali30 composed by Kalyanavarman,31 the lord of Vyaghrapadi (Vyaghratati in Bengal), inabout 800. Its fifty-four chapters are toalarge extent based on the YJ, theVYJ, theBJ,and theBPH,32 though Kalyanavarman also quotes (in. addition to many astrologers whom wehave already mentioned) Citragupta33 (S 54, 12), CUdamani34 (S5, 20 and 39, 8), Devakirti35 (S37, 1), Brahmasanda36 (S 10, 6), who had previously been cited by Varahamihira (BY 9, 1), andHari (S 5, 2;6, 1;and 6, 6). But most important for hisdate ishis mention of Kanaka37 (S53, 1),who is probably identical with the Kanaka who served as an astrologer in the court ofHarun al-Rashid (786—809) in Baghdad and continued to work in Baghdad into the reign ofal-Ma'mun (813—833) ;38 he was probably still inIndia till sometime inthe 790's. Other Indian astrologers known to the Arabs during the 'Abbasid period include Aryakula,39 Indra,40 Rsi,4X Jitari,42 Jina,43 Raja, Sanghadhara, and Singhala. The Sitself was known to al-Biruni (India 14). If Kalyanavarman's terminus post quem isgiven byhis use of the BPH and his reference toKanaka, his terminus ante quem isestablished by the quotations from the Sin Govindasvamin's Prakatarthadipika, which was written in Kerala in about 850.This commentary on the uttarakhanda ofthe BPHis extraordinarily rich in quotations from early astrologers, astronomers, and mathematicians ; aside from those astrologers already discussed, Govindasvamin cites

Krsna44 (who may be identical with the author ofthe Krsniya or Cintajnana45 which wasextremely popular in Kerala), Bhagadatta,46 Cirantana Yavana, Yavanesvara (who is different from Sphujidhvaja, though the latter is also quoted by Govindasvamin), and Haridatta (the seventh century astronomer, who evidently also wrote on astrology). The names ofand quotations fromthe works ofa few more authorities onjataka from this early period can be found in Bhattotpala's Jagaccandrika; they are Yama (on BJ 8, 3),Vankalaka47 (on BJ 15, 1), and grutaklrti (on BJ 1, 7;8,9;13, 3;and 21, 3). At some time before Sripati (fl. 1039—1056) wrote his Jatakakarmapaddhati48 in Rohinikhanda, Srldhara had written onjataka (see JKP 5, 36). There does exist in several manuscripts, some of which are associated with Mysore(the earliest dated example was copied in 1589), a Jatakapaddhati ofSridhara; and a Jaina priest named Sridhara from Narigunda in the Karnataka wrote, in Kannada, a Jatakatilaka49 in 1049 under the Western Calukya Somesvara I (1042—1068). What relation the two Srldharas might have toeach other or to the astrologer cited by Sripati remains unclear. Srlpati's own Jatakapaddhati or Jatakakarmapaddhati teaches in eight adhydyas how to calculate the astrological places, and how tocompute the amount ofaspects, the strengths of the planets, the length oflife, the dasds and antardasds, and the astakavarga; it is closely related to the purvakhandaof the BPH. The JKPwas immensely influential as isindicated bythe numerous imitations ofit andcommentaries on it; the latter were composed by Suryadeva at Gangapura in about1250 (Jatakalankara); by Paramesvara at As>atthagrama inabout 1425 (Balaprabodhini); by Acyuta in about 1525(Bhavarthamafijari); by Suryadasa at Parthapura in about 1550(Bodhasudhakara); by Raghunatha (the unique manuscript was copied in 1612); bySumatiharsa Gani, presumably at Khairabad, in1616 (Subodha); by Krsna inabout 1625; by Dullaha50 in 1776; andby Kamabhatta51 (Sampradayaparisuddhi); bya Brahmana from Parakroda in

In 1167, during thereign of the Caulukya Kumarapala (ca.1143—1172), at Campavati (presumably Chatsu south of Jayapura in Rajasthan rather than Chaul south of Bombay in the Konkana), a Jaina of the Ka^ahradagaecha, Naracandropadhyaya57 wrote a Bedajataka,58 which is a vrtti in verse on his own Janmasamudra. In eight kallolas it treats the astrology of conception, birth, congenital faults, death, rdjayogas, other yogas, and strijdtaka. There circulates, primarily in South India, an extensive work on jdtaha entitled Horasara,59 which is sometimes attributed to Varahamihira's son, Prthuyasas. However, theauthor has borrowed verses from Kalyanavarman's Saravali60 and somust have written after ca. 850; and the H is cited by Visnusurman61 (fl.ca.1370), and somust have been written before ca. 1350.TheII is also closely related (asistheS)tothesouthern Candrabharanahora of Yavana,62 but unfortunately the date of that work is not yet precisely known.

On the same subject and called by the same title orby the title Jatakacandrika65 is a short poem by VenkatesVara, who was thegrandson ofGovinda Diksita,66 the court astrologer ofAcyutappa Nayaka (1560—1600) at Tanjore. Venkates"vara hasapparently borrowed several verses from the older Ududayapradlpa. Possibly somewhat later than the H is theHoramakaranda67 written by Gunakara68 at Kharjura in Avanti. This work in thirty-one adhyayas closely follows the BJ. Since Gunakara mentions the RMcomposed byBhojaraja in 1042 (HM 1, 5),and since theHM itself is often quoted by Sivaraja (ca. 1475/1500) inhis Jyotirnibandha, he must have lived between ca. 1100 and 1450. Also quoted bySivaraja isthe Lomas"asamhita,69 which is basically a dialogue between Lomas'a andSujanma, though some sections aredialogues between Siva andParvati; BPH purva 33is a dialogue between the first pair of interlocutors. Ingeneral the Lomas'a seems to belong tothe tradition ofthe BPH.

verses from the BJ72 and even from the H.73 In general, his astrology seems more developed than that of Sripati; but a more exhaustive search of the relevant texts is necessary before one canestablish a firm terminus post quem for the J P J ; the terminus ante, ca. 1450,is provided by the quotations in &ivaraja's Jyotirnibandha. At some time after Vaidyanatha, whose work he uses,74 Mantresvara75 wrote a Phaladipika76 at Srlsalivati (Tinnevelly). In twenty-eight adhyayas he covers themain topics of jdtaka; adhydya 24 describes the astakavarga of Horasara 17. In about 1500 at Nandigrama inGujarat Kesava,77 thefather of the celebrated Ganesa, composed an extremely concise (there areonly forty-two verses) but very popular handbook onthe principal mathematical calculations essential in jdtaka, the Jatakapaddhati.78 Kesava's inspiration was apparently Srlpati's JKP, of which hisJ P might beregarded as a condensation.

Another extremely popular work onjdtaka, though this time a very full treatment ofthe subject in some forty-five adhydyas, isthe Jatakabharana82 composed byDhundhiraja,83 the pupil and (probably) nephew ofJftanaraja, at Parthapura inabout 1525. Another sixteenth century astrologer was Narayana Bhatta.84 Hewrote another extremely popular work, the Camatkaracintamani,85 which, in 115 verses, gives predictions based on the presence in each of the twelve astrological places ofeach ofthe nine planets. The earliest dated manuscript wascopied in1596. There is acommentary, Anvayarthadipika, composed by Dharmesvara inthe first half ofthe seventeenth century. Asimilar work, also entitled Camatkaracintamani, was written byRajarsi at Dadhicyapurain Gujarat inabout 1630. The year before Divakara wrote his Praudhamanorama onKesava's Jatakapaddhati—that is, in 1625—he composed a similar, butlengthier, treatise entitled Jatakamargapadma,86 in which heclaims to present the essence of the tantrasofiSripati, Kes"ava, and Sundara. Divakara wrote hisown commentary on this, theGanitatattvacintamani, in 1627.

In theearly seventeenth century a popular treatise onselected topicsof jdtakawaspenned by Ganesa,87 whowrote his Jatakalankara88 at Bradhnapura on the Tap! inGujarat in1613; hestates that heis following the $ukajataka. There arecommentaries written byHaribhanu Sukla in 1809; andbyKrparama89 and Narmadagiri Avadhuta.90 In 1629one Haraji orHarijit wrote a Yoginidasaphalaprakarana describing the eight yoginidasds inaccordance with the Sivayamala. And in1633 Rajarsi, the sonofKalyana, wrote a Dasacintamani at Dadhicyapura inGujarat; he also was theauthor of a Yoginidasaphala. Toa Kalyana,91 who may be Rajarsi's father, isattributed avast Janmapatrikapaddhati, which is sometimes also entitled Manasagaii; andtoManasagara92 isascribed anidentical—or at least very similar—Manasagari,93 inwhich isincorporated Haraji's Yoginidasaphalaprakarana (end of adhyaya 5). The earliest dated manuscript of the Manasagara version wascopied in 1708. Manuscripts ofKalyana's version seem to have quotations from the VYJ, the BJ,the LJ, andother works. The relations ofthe various Manasagaris and the various Yoginidasas to each other remain tobeinvestigated. In about 1625Nrsimha94 puttogether a vast nibandha entitled Jatakasara

dipa.95 The earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1637, and the latest work to which the author refers is the Saurabhasya composed by Nrsimha atVaranasI in 1611; whether or not the two Nrsimha's are identical cannot as yet be established. Other authorities utilized inthe JSD include the YJ, the VYJ, the BJ, the LJ, the S, the HM, and, from alater period, Damodara, the Gaurijataka, the Suryarunasamvada, and works ontdjika and hilldja.In 1654 Balabhadra96 wrote another gigantic nibandha, the Horaratna,97 at the court ofShah Shuja'. Though so late, this is anextremely full and valuable compilation deserving of a critical edition and careful study for its contributions to thehistories of the texts from which it has borrowed. Afar more original work is the Sarvarthacintamani,98 composed by Venkatesa near Tirupati in Tamilnadu in about 1650. Thecore of its eighteen chapters deals in great detail with the possible influences of the twelve bhdvas on the native's life (adhydyas 2—8). There is a commentary ascribed to Divananda" (or Divanacandra) Mis"ra or to his son, Radhakrsna; both lived at Lavapura (Lahore, Panjab). At Jambusara in Gujarat Yajfiikanatha composed the Jatakacandrika,100 which deals with technical aspects of jdtaka in six prabodhas. By this time Kasinatha101 had written hispopular Lagnacandrika;102 for the oldest dated manuscript was copied in 1670. If, however, this Kasinatha is identical with the author of the Pras"napradlpa and the Sighrabodha, as seems likely, he flourished before 1550. Arather traditional treatise onjdtaka is the Sambhuhoraprakasa103 composed byPunjaraja104 in about 1700 for Sambhudasa (born 1662), the ruler of Nandidvarapura (Nander, Maharastra ?). Several decades later Putumana Somayajin, the author of the Karanapaddhati, wrote the Jataka.des'amarga105 in Kerala.

Before 1729when the earliest dated manuscript was copied Jaimini106 (or rather someone using the sage's name) composed the Upadesasutra,107 acollection of 1031 sutras (there is also a set of verse kdrihds that summarize them) divided into four adhydyas, each of which has four pddas. The only other jdtaka work composed in sutras seems to be the Jatakatattva108 completed by Udumbara Mahadeva Pathaka109 at Ratnapura (Ratlam, Madhya Pradesa) in 1872. The earliest manuscript of the Upadesasutra already contains the commentary of Krsnananda Sarasvati,110 who calls himself a Dravidacarya; this commentary is also preserved in a manuscript dated 1721. Tentatively, then, one might surmise that the Upadesasutras were composed in South India in, perhaps, the seventeenth century. Other commentaries were written by Nllakantha Regmi111 in 1754at Bhatgaon, Nepala (SubodhinI); by Akumalla Nrsimha112 in South India (Arthaprakasika); by Nrsimha Khedakara,113 probably in Mysore; by Paramesvara Yogindra,111 apparently in Tamilnadu (Jyotisananda); by Premanidhi115 (Kasika); by Malayavarman,116 the ruler of Takumaparvata (Kasika); by Laksmana in South India (Jyotihpradipika); and by Venkatesa in South India (Bhavakaumudi).

horoscopes assembled tinder thename Bhrgusamhita, and presented in the form of a dialogue between Bhrgu117 and Sukra. The work contains thirteen gigantic adhyayas: one for each zodiacal sign, and aYogasagara.118 The earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1645; I doubt that the work antedates the sixteenth century. Themanuscript copies alloriginate in North India, where some extraordinarily diligent fellow compiled it. A similar collection found in South India isthe mammoth Saptarsi nadi119 in Tamil.
Tdjika
The word tdjika is derived from the Pahlavi Tazig, aterm which the Iranians applied to the Arabs; it in turn is derived from the name of the Arab tribe, Tayyi'. Since theearly eighth century, theArabs and Persians who encroached on theWestern coast of India were called Tajikas.120 As thename for a branch of genethlialogy theterm tdjika refers toIndian adaptations of Arabic/Persian astrology, which wras itself a combination ofelements from Greek, Syriac, Sasanian, andIndian science.121 In tdjika texts not only are a number of astrological techniques and concepts foreign to jdtaka found—including some like the on(p£rr]c, orhayldj (Sanskrit hilldja) that hadbeen a part ofthe Y J but later forgotten in India—but also many technical terms—e.g., kabula (qdbul), antihd (intihd'), hadda (hadd), sahama (sahm), andmany others.
The earliest author on tdjika inSanskrit was Samarasimha ofthe Pragvatakula, who wrote his Ganakabhusana or Tajikatantrasara or Karmaprakasika122 in Gujarat in 1274; hisgreat-great-grandfather, Candasimha, had been a saciva ofthe Caulukya Mularaja I I (ca. 1177—1179). Samarasimha names as hissource thework ofKhindika,123 a name derived from theArabic alHindl. There isa commentary, theDaivajnasantosinl or Karmaprakasikavrtti, composed by Narayana Samudrika124 in about 1725.

A relatively short text on tdjika in seventy-three verses is the Varsaphala125 attributed to Manittha,126 whose name, which is that of the ancient Greek authority on jdtaka (Mavs&wv), wasinspired by the Arabic technical term muntahan, which occurs in Sanskrit as munthaha. The earliest dated manuscript wascopied in 1475. To a large extent based on theVarsaphala is the Tajikamani127 completed in eighty-five verses by Mahidhara at Varanasi in 1585. Both these works areonthe topic of anniversary horoscopes {hdyanaor varsaphala), which became a very prominent feature of tdjika. In about 1500 thewell known Kesava of Nandigrama wrote a Tajikapaddhati128 on hdyana in twenty-six verses. Commentaries were written by Visvanatha at Golagrama in 1610 and byMallari129 in 1612. Afarfuller treatment of the subject is to be found in theTajikasara composed by Hari in 1523. A commentary onthis was written by Sumatiharsa Gani at Khairabad in 1620. That Suryadasa who commented on Bhaskara's L andBG at Parthapura in 1541 and1538 respectively wasalso theauthor of a Tajikalankara. Perhaps in 1544 Govardhana130 wrote a Tajikapadmakosa131 on hdyana. Before 1559, the date at which the earliest manuscript wascopied, Vamana authored a Tajikasaroddhara; while inabout 1575 Nrsimha, who was born at Nandigrama in 1548, wrote a Varsaphaladlpika on hdyana and a Hillajadipika on the hayldj. But the most noteworthy and popular book on tdjika is the Tajikanilakanthi132 composed byNilakantha133 at Kas"! in 1587. This is divided intotwo sections, which are often presented separately; the samjndtantra on general tdjika, andthe varsatantra onhdyana. There exist commentaries composed by

Nllakantha's sonGovinda,134 who was born in 1569, at Kasi in 1622 (Rasala); by VisVanatha at Kasl in 1629; by Madhava,135 who was born in 1598 as the son of Nilakantha's son Govinda, at Kasl in 1633 (Sisubodhin!); and by Harsadhara (Srlphalavardhini). Towards the endof the sixteenth century the high-ranking Mughul official 'Abd al-Rahim, whowas born at Lahore in 1556 (hishoroscope is given in Krsna's tika on Sripati's JKP) as theson of Bairam Khan andwho was given the title Khan-i Khanan (he is known as Nabbaba Khanakhana136 in Sanskrit), wrote a Khetakautuka137 on tdjika in 124 verses. At about the same time Ganesa,138 the son of Dhundhiraja whowrote theJatakabharana at Parthapura inabout 1525, composed a lengthy Tajikabhusana139 infourteen adhydyas; and iSankara wrote a Tajikacandrika or Samaphala at Nadur, in which he mentions thesixty-year cycle from 1567 to 1627 and of which theoldest dated manuscript was copied in 1607. In the early seventeenth century Yadava Suri, whobelonged to a family dwelling at Prakasa in Gujarat, penned a Tajikayogasudhanidhi in sixteen adhydyas; its date is apparently 1616. Soon afterwards his son, Balakrsna,140 composed a popular Tajikakaustubha in twelve adhydyas, perhaps at Jambusaras. Balakrsna's contemporary was the Divakara whom wehave mentioned several times before; he wrote a Varsaganitabhusana or Rathoddhata and a commentary onit entitled Manjubhasini. However, the tdjika text best known to the scholarly world because of the studies of Weber141 is the immensely valuable nibandha, the Hayanaratna,142 composed by Balabhadra for Shah Shuja' at Rajamahala in 1629. Like the same author's Horaratna, it is a vast collection ofexcerpts from earlier writers' works. As well as most of the authorities that we have already mentioned Balabhadra cites from Tejahsimha andPadmanabha. The former is probably the Tejahsimha143 whocomposed a Daivajiialankrti in Gujarat in 1336, the latter the Padmanabha144 who is the author of an Hillajayurdaya, of which the oldest dated manuscript was copied in 1699.

Tdjika continued to be discussed and described in the following centuries. Briefly, the literature includes: the Tajikaratna composed by Gangadhara at Ka§i in 1653; the Tajikasara written by VenkateSa in 1654; the Tajikamanjari composed by Jayadeva145 at &ripura in 1671; the Tajikakalpalata of Jayarama,146 of which the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1711; the Tajikaratna written by Ciranjiva147 of Navadvipa, Bengal, probably in about 1725; the Tajikasarasudhanidhi composed by Narayana Samudrika, the commentator on Samarasimha, in about 1725; and the Tajikalankara written by Sambhurama at Dhavalapura in 1730.

CHAPTER VI
CATARCHIC ASTROLOGY
To regard the time when the Moon conjoins with a particular naksatra as propitious or unpropitious for performing certain acts was an ancient custom in India.1 We have, indeed, encountered systematic expositions of such systems already in the Sardulakarnavadana (pp. 81—99). In the YJ (77—78) actions to be taken on the planetary week-days, when the Moon is in each of the zodiacal signs, in the years ruled by each of the planets, and various other yogas are described. The Gargasamhita (anga 1) prescribes actions to be undertaken when the Moon is in each naksatra and in each tithi and karana; see also the BS (97-99) and the S~ardulakarnavadana (pp. 201-203). Eventually a separate science developed that used this notion of auspicious and inauspicious time-units, in combination with omens and astrological yogas, to establish the correct time for initiating various kinds of actions; this is the science of muhurta, corresponding to Hellenistic catarchic astrology. In Indian treatises on catarchic astrology great importance is given to deciding the time for performing the samskdras and other ritual acts; this aspect of muhurta strongly influenced dharmasdstra, many treatises of which are entirely or partially devoted to this kind of prediction.2 Also, a number of texts that will be discussed in this chapter represent conflations of muhurta with omens, but with the muhurtas as the more important component rather than the omens as in the GS and BS. The earliest work that we know to have been devoted to muhurta was the Ratnakosa composed by Lalla in, probably, the eighth century. Though a few fragmentary manuscripts of this work survive, and there are numerous quotations from it in later commentaries and nibandhas, its contents are not yet clear. However, $ripati, who wrote his Jyotisaratnamala3 at Rohinikhanda in about 1050, claims to base a large part of it on the Ratnakosa. The contents of Srfpati's work are: samvatsara (1) or the sixty-year cycle of Jupiter; the characteristics of tithis (2), week-days (3), yogas (4), karanas (5), naksatras (6), and muhurtas (7); the wpagrahas (8); the Sun's entry into the zodiacal signs
1 See, for instance, the not always reliable account by P. V. KANE, History of Dharmasastra, vol. 5, part 1, Poona 1958, pp. 523—536. 2 The dharmasdstra texts on muhurta will not be discussed here; information concerning them will be found in the appropriate entries in CESS.

(sankrdnti; 9); planetary transits (gocara;10; cf. BS 103); the influence of the Moon (11) and of the ascendant (12); the samskdras (13); laying the sacred fire (14); the consecration of the king (15); military expeditions (ydtrd; 16); marriage (vivdha; 17); building (vdstu; 18); entering the house (19); wearing clothes (20); and installing images of the gods (21). This became the standard arrangement for a pure muhurta text; as usual, while the details of the interpretations of phenomena may vary, and while the methods employed tend to become increasingly elaborate, the basic structure of muhurta, like those of the other sciences we have investigated in this volume, tended to remain unchanged. Sripati wrote his own Marathi commentary on the JRM.4 Of the Sanskrit commentaries the grandest is the vivrti completed by Mahadeva, Amaraja's nephew, in Gujarat in 1264; it is especially valuable for its numerous citations of jyotisa, dharma, purdna, and other types of texts. Other commentaries were composed by Damodara5 (Balavabodha); Paramakarunika6 (Balabodhini in Gujarat! or RajasthanI; the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1636); and Vaija Pandita (the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1493). Contemporaneously with Sripati, Bhojaraja, the famous Paramara ruler of Dhara, wrote (or had written) the Rajamartanda.7 This text, naturally uninfluenced by the arrangement of Sripati's, deals, among other topics, with the names and qualities of the planets, naksatras, and zodiacal signs; with many samskdras in the order of their normal occurrences in life from conception till death; with military astrology; with building, installing images, digging wells, agriculture, planting trees, archery, mounting elephants, and a variety of other topics. Unfortunately, the printed edition includes material that does not belong to the original; for instance, it cites (p. 116) the opinion of the Kalamadhavlya, which was written by Madhava in the late fourteenth century. A critical edition is a necessity before this fascinating collection of material on ordinary life in medieval India can be properly exploited. In about 1100 MahesVara,8 the father of the great Bhaskara, wrote a brief but relatively popular VrttaSataka9 on muhurta. Two of the Jaina scholars in the circle of Vastupala, the minister of the Vaghelas Lavanaprasada and Viradhavala in Gujarat from 1220 till 1240, wrote popular works on muhurta. Udayaprabha Suri10 composed an Arambhasiddhi or Pancavimar&a11 in 412 verses, on which Hemahamsa wrote a vdrttika at As'apalll (Ahmadabad, Gujarat?) in 1457 (Sudhisrngara). And Naracandra

Suri12 was the author of a Jyotisasara or Naracandra13 in 4 prakaranas, on which a tippanaka was composed by Sagaracandra Suri before 1468, when the earliest dated manuscript was copied. Neither author, of course, deals with the proper moments for performing samskdras. Perhaps at about the same time (some scholars claim that the date is about 1242, though the earliest dated manuscript was not copied till 1658), someone who claims to be Kalidasa14 andto have written at the court of Vikramaditya in 34 B.C. composed a Jyotirvidabharana15 on muhurta with some omen material interspersed. Bhavaratna16 wrote hiscommentary, the Sukhabodhika, at Pattana in 1711. At Alattur in Kerala in the late thirteenth century Govindabhatta, one of the commentators on Varahamihira's BJ, wrote a Muhurtamani, whose contents need to be investigated. A vydkhyd on this was composed by a fellow resident of Alattur (Aivatthagrama), the prolific Paramesvara, whose grandfather had been Govindabhatta's student, in the early fifteenth century. At sometime before about 1365 someone wrote a Naradasamhita17 ascribed to the sage Narada;18 for it is extensively quoted by Visnus'arman in his Muhurtadlpika.19 The NS, as do several other muhurta samhitds (cf. GS 4—11) ascribed to rsis, begins with planetary omens (2; grahacdra) similar to those in conventional omen samhitds; and appends to the usual muhurta material (adhydyas 3—31) other omen chapters: e.g.,sadyovrsti (32; cf. BS28), kurmavibhdga (33; cf. GS 23), utpdta (34; cf. GS 39), and various topics (35; cf.GS 55—58; BS 31, 35—37). VisnuSarman also knew a Vasisthasamhita; this, however, is different from the Vasisthasamhita20 that is current now. This latter text, however, is at least as old as the fifteenth century; the earliest dated manuscript wascopied in 1443, andthe earliest quotations are by Sivaraja in his JN.21 The contents of the VSA are very similar to those of the NS, save that much of the omen material in NS 32—37 is omitted. Another mixed text of this nature is the second GS already referred to in the chapter on omen literature.

The most important authority on muhurta in the fourteenth century,however, was Vidyamadhava, who wrote his Muhurtadarsana or Vidyamadhaviya22 in theVijayanagara Empire in about 1360. Its fifteen adhydyas are concerned with terminology and definitions (1; samjnd); faults (2; dosa), exceptions (3; apavdda), andgood qualities (4;guna) of muhurtas; strengths and weaknesses (5; baldbala); the samskdras (6—9); agriculture (10; krsibijavdpa); installation of images of the gods (11; devapratisthd); military expeditions (12; ydtrd); various other activities (13); on the naksatras (14); and on gocara (15). There is an extremely valuable tiled on the VM, the Muhiirtadipika, written by Vidyamadhava's son, Visnusarman, in about 1365; as has been noted several times above, this provides a rich store of citations from the antecedent literature on several branches of jyotihsastra. The other important source for quotations from earlier texts is the J Nof iSivaraja. Hedoes not, however, refer to the extraordinarily popular Balabodha or Jyotisasarasangraha of Mufijaditya.23 But since the earliest dated manuscript of this latter work was copied in 1479, Mufijaditya must have flourished in about 1450 or perhaps a bit before. It is probably theelementary nature of the Balabodha to which its popularity was due. A brief but also popular muhurta poem is the Brahmavyavahara or Trivikramasataka24 composed by Trivikrama25 before 1484,when the earliest dated manuscript was copied. That manuscript also contains the commentary, Budhavallabha, of Goplnatha.26 As in many other fields, so in muhurta Kesuva of Nandigrama wrote an important work, the Muhurtatattva.27 His son, Ganesa, dutifully wrote a tiled, theMuhurtadipika, at Nandigrama before 1554. Another tiledwas written by Visvanatha in the early seventeenth century; the oldest dated manuscript was copied in 1637. Probably also in the early sixteenth century Kasmatha28 composed hisvery successful Sighrabodha,29 of which theearliest dated manu

Probably also to be dated in the early sixteenth century is the brief Balavivekinl or Paficavimsatika30 of Nahnidatta ;31 the earliest dated manuscript of it wascopied in 1589. A far more impressive treatise is the Muhurtamartanda32 composed by Narayana33 at Tapara north of Devagiri in 1571. A year later he wrote a

commentary, the Martandavallabha. A Laghumuhurtamartanda was apparently composed by Narayana himself; an abridgment ofthe Muhurtamartanda was made byNilakantha34 in 1680. But within thirty years thepre-eminence of Narayana's great treatise was eclipsed by Rama, who completed theMuhurtacintamani35 with its tika,the Pramitaksara, at Kasi in 1600.Another commentary, the Piyusadhara,was composed by Rama's nephew, Govinda, at Ka&i in 1603. For the sake of comparison the titles of the adhydyas in the works of Narayana, Rama,and Ganapati arepresented in Table 6; this shows clearly Narayana's new approach to the subject, Rama's dependence on him, and Ganapati's return (anticipated by Vitthala) to the old tradition of Sripati. But before Ganapati wrote toward the endof the seventeenth century, a large number of lesser authors tried their hand. These include: Bhanu,36 who wrote a Sajjanavallabha37 at Mandhatr in Gujarat (the earliest dated manuscript wascopied in 1602); Nagesa, the author ofthe Grahaprabodha in1619, who also composed a Muhurtadipaka; Vitthala, theauthor of a Paddhatikalpavalli in 1626, who wrote a Muhurtakalpadruma38 atKasi in 1627; Raghuvira, Vitthala's son, who composed a Muhurtasarvasva in 1635; Mahadeva,39 the author of a brief Muhurtadipaka40 at Anjara in Kaccha in 1640 and of a vydkhyd on the same at Bhuja in 1661; Nandikesvara,41 who composed the Ganakamandana at Sristhala in Gujarat in about 1640;Paramahamsa Parivrajakacarya,42 whowrote a Muhurtamuktavali,43 of which the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1645; $rlkantha, who wrote another Muhurtamukta

Clearly, the interest in muhurta during the seventeenth century wasconcentrated in Benares andGujarat. This didnot change when Ganapati Ravala4* completed his gigantic Muhurtaganapati45 at Kasi in 1686. In the eighteenth century the only notable treatises on muhurta were the Ratnadyota48 composed by Gangarama Dviveda47 in 1718and the Jyotiscandrarka48 composed by Rudradeva Sarman at Kas"! in 1726. Butthelast such work to which reference should be made here is theVyavahararatna49 written by Bhanunatha50 in Mithila in 1872. This tradition, like that of genethlialogy, is still very much alive.
Ydtrd
Military "astrology," an aspect of catarchic astrology in which the Indian developments influenced the Syriac scholar, Theophilus of Edessa,51 inthe eighth century and through him thelater astrology of Islam, Byzantium,and Western Europe, began in India with the omens during the late first millennium B.C. I t is found, then, in such texts as theGS (32—34) and in numerous other collections of omens, including the Narapatijayacarya and other texts on svara, and regularly in treatises onmuhurta. Ydtrd, which combines omens with real astrology, is also the subject of a section of the Y J (73—76); in the commentary thereon (vol. 2, pp.389—393) a partial list of authorities on the subject, numbering fifty-six, wasgiven.

and the Brhadyatra.54 Verses from each ofthese works occur in the other two. In addition to the omens and astrology proper, the BY (18), following the lead of Sphujidhvaja (YJ 76, 66 and 77, 1), gives detailed instructions for the worship of the planets (grahayajna). Commentaries on the YYandthe BY were composed by Bhattotpala in Kasmira in about 970, andon the BY by Suryadeva at Gangapura in the early thirteenth century; of the two commentaries ontheBY allthat now survives seems to bea miserable fragment of Bhattotpala's. Varahamihira refers toBadarayana55 as oneof his authorities, and Bhattotpala in his tiledonthe YY cites many verses from a Badarayanlyayatra, ofwhich a few manuscript copies are known.56 After the tenth century, new literature on military astrology (aside from adhydyasin muhurta texts) seems to have followed the models of the Narapatijayacarya andthe Samarasara rather than Varahamihira; such seems to be thecase, for example, with theYuddhajayotsava of Gangarama,57 and it is also to a large extent true ofKumara Ganaka,58 whowrote his Ranadfpika59 in Kerala. As yetlittle is known ofthe Rajavijaya of Ranahastin save that it was composed for a king named Mandana, the sonof Hammira, the son of Simhanadeva, and that the oldest dated manuscript was copied in 1600. Clearly Mandana is the Haihaya (Kalacuri) ruler of Ratnapura, Madanabrahman, theson of Damghira (?), theson of Singhana, who is mentioned in the first Kosgain (Kosanga) Stone Inscription of his (Madanabrahman's) great-grandson Vaharendra,60 whoruled from about 1480 till about 1515. Ranahastin, therefore, flourished at Ratanpur north of Bilaspur in Madhya Pradesa in about 1400.
Vivdha
Varahamihira incorporated into hisBS (102) a chapter ontheastrology of marriage entitled vivdhapatala, the "marriage chest;" this was attributed to Vindhyavasin byhis commentator, Bhattotpala. But healso wrote a separate and more extensive treatise on theastrology of marriage, also entitled Vivahapatala.61 Acommentary onthis was written bythe faithful Bhattotpala at

Ka^mira in about 970. Thereafter, when muhurta treatises became popular, they all included a section on vivdha—sometimes little else; and, of course, most works on jdtaka also included discussions of this topic. Thus, Visnusarman, in commenting on VM 8 in about 1365, quotes notonly from Varahamihira, but also from Atri, Kalyanavarman, Gargya, Guru, Narapati, Narada, Brhaspati, Bharadvaja, Bhagila, Bhrgu, YavanesVara (notSphujidhvaja or Minaraja), Lalla, Vasistha, Vamadeva, Vamana, $aunaka, $rlpati, and the Saptarsis. He quotes as well from a number of works whose titles but not authors he names. Among these is theVivahavrndavana,62 which is indeed thework of that title63 composed by Kesuvarka.64 In seventeen adhydyas it deals in unparalleled completeness with all aspects of the subject. A commentary, the Vivahadlpika or Karapidanadipika, was composed by Ganega at Nandigrama in 1554. Also ascribed to a Kesavarka65 is a Maunjipatala66 in but twelve verses. The other vivdha texts that we have include theSarasamuccaya or Vivahapatala67 of Sarangapani, a nibandha based largely on the Sarasamuccaya of Vaidyanatha (the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1597); the Vivahapatala68 of Brahmaditya69 (the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1605); and the Vivahapatala70 composed byPitambara71 at Stambhatirtha (Canibay, Gujarat) (the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1615).

CHAPTER VII
INTERROGATIONS
In catarchic astrology the jyotisl determines for his client the moment (muhurta) at which itis most propitious for him to undertake a specific act; in interrogations (prasna) he responds to a query about some aspect of the client's life onthe basis of the horoscope of the moment of the query. Obviously, there isconsiderable overlapping of topics and methods between these two branches of astrology. Praina is also related to omens since the latter are of two kinds: spontaneous and induced. The second variety, in which the diviner requests that the gods send him an omen, has clear similarities to prasna. Even the ceremonies of ritual purification andsupplication used for induced omens (see, e.g., BS24 and43) arereflected in praina texts (e.g., P J 3—4). But in general the techniques of praina are derived from jdtaka. And it isin ajdtaka treatise, Sphujidhvaja's YJ, that praina was introduced to India from the Hellenistic world. Sphujidhvaja begins (YJ52, 1—5) with rules for reconstructing the lost horoscope of the nativity of the client from the horoscope of the time of his query; this topic, entitled nastajdtaka, was normally dealt with in later jdtaka texts. Thereafter he discusses methods of determining the subject of the querist's question before he puts it (YJ 52, 7—10, and 53—62); in part heuses the pharmacological categories ofdyurveda (YJ 62)associated with celestial bodies. Thefollowing adhydya (YJ 63) answers the question of whether what the querist is thinking of will in fact occur;and then there come discussions of lost or stolen objects (YJ64), of sicknessand death (YJ 65),of the sex of unborn or unseen children (YJ 66),of dinner (YJ 67), of various aspects of sleep (YJ 68), and of the subjects of dreams (YJ 69—70). The final two adhydyas in this section (YJ 71—72) give elaborate rules forreconstructing names from astrological phenomena. Only parts of this treatment of prasna are found in the Satpancasika1

composed by Varahamihira's son,Prthuyasas,2 in the second half of the sixth century. Heis interested in travel, warfare, profit andloss, sickness and death, marriage, and pregnancy. Themost important commentaries on these fifty-six verses were composed byBhattotpala inKasmira in about 970, byParamesVara in Kerala in the early fifteenth century, and by Damodara Ranabha3 at Kasl in about 1680 (Prakas"ika). Similar in content andin brevity are Badarayana's4 Prasnavidya5 in seventy-six verses, onwhich Bhattotpala wrote a commentary in about 970,and Bhattotpala's ownPrasnajnana or Aryasaptati6 in seventy verses, on which commentaries were composed by Ramakrsna at AmaravatI and by Sridatta. The amount of detail in pras'na texts, though not their scope, wasenlarged in the Vidvajjanavaliabha7 written by (or for) the Paramara JBhojaraja of Dhara in the first half of the eleventh century. This poem contains 180verses divided into eighteen adhydyas; nine verses are taken from Badarayana.8 At about the same time, if the ascription to Sripati of Rohinikhanda is valid (the work is also, more obviously falsely, associated with Varahamihira in 15, 43), there was composed a Daivajnavallabha9 in 250 verses divided into fifteen adhydyas, of which the last is almost entirely derived from Varahamihira's ydtrd works.10 The only rival to Prthuyasas' Satpaiicasika for popularity among prasna treatises is the Bhuvanadipaka11 that Padmaprabha Suri,12 a member ofthe

Nagapurlya Tapa Gaccha of Jainas, wrote in 1164. I t gives the elementsof astrology (1—42); lists the queries to be judged from each astrological place (42—54), anddiscusses, in addition to more common topics, prices (127—137), sailing (138—144), andsex (163—164). There are several commentaries; the most notable is that written by the Jaina Simhatilaka Suri at Vijapura in 1269. Contemporary with Padmaprabha wasanother Jaina, Naracandropadhyaya of the Kasahrada Gaccha who composed theBedavrtti on hisown Janmasamudra in Gujarat in 1167. Adecade later, in 1177, hewrote a PraSnaf-iata with accompanying avacurni; he also is the author of the succinct Jfianacaturvims'ika.13 A few years after this Candesvara, who is probably identical with the scholar who commented onthe SSin Mithila in about 1185, produced an enormous Prasnavidya in thirty-five or forty adhydyas. Unfortunately I have as yet had access only to incomplete manuscripts of this work,14 but from these theextreme importance of this treatise for a history of pra&na in India is evident. Hemaprabha Suri, thepupil of Devendra Suri, is generally alleged to have written the Trailokyaprakasa15 in 1248; in anycase, the earliest dated manuscript wascopied in 1457. This invaluable treatise is a Sanskrit version of an Arabic (or Persian) work on interrogations (it is filled with tdjika technical terms notrecognized as such by theeditor) arranged in thestandard fashion of Arabic astrology—a fashion going back to Theophilus of Edessa—that is, by the queries appropriate to each astrological place. At sometime before 1569(if that date for the copying of a manuscript of the work is correct; thenext wascopied in 1647) someone published a Lokamanorama16 in twenty-two verses under the name of Garga;17 this gives a computation that determines substances in the three categories of animal, vegetable, andmineral, andsome of their attributes. In the early sixteenth century—he was a leader of the Gosvamins (of the followers of Caitanya?), andthe earliest dated manuscript of his work was copied in 1543—Narayanadasa Siddha18 composed the Prasnavaisnava or Prasnarnavaplava19 in which again elements of tdjika (i.e., Arabic-Persian) interrogational astrology enter into praina. Also inthe early sixteenth century Kasinatha20 composed hisPraSnapradlpa;21 the earliest dated manuscript was

copied in 1556. And perhaps from the same period is the Prasnamanikyamala of Paramananda Sarman;22 one manuscript is said to have been copied in 1560, but the author is also said to have nourished at the court of Balavantasimha, the Maharaja of Kasi in about 1748. But we return to a secure chronology and to the renewed influence to tdjika science with the Prasnatantra23 written by that Nilakantha who composed the Tajikanilakanthi in 1587. In the course of this treatise he quotes many verses from earlier works, making it a sort of nibandha;his favorite authorities besides the Tajikas, are Prthuyasas and Padmaprabha Suri. In the seventeenth century pradna was the subject of a number of treatises, many of which cannot be securely dated. Among these are to be included the Prasnajnana of Brahmarka,24 of which the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1622, and the Jnanamafijari of Rsisarman,25 of which the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1646.Probably to be included in this group is the Prasnatattva26 of Cakrapani,27 whose floruit lies between 1514, the year in which Vibhakara composed his Prasnakaumudi which Cakrapani cites (10, 18), and 1800, the year in which the earliest dated manuscript of the Prasnatattva was copied. Other texts on prasna written in the seventeenth century include: the Prasnabhairava28 composed by Gangadhara, the author also of works on jdtaka, kosthaka, muhurta, and tdjika, at Kasi in 1629; the Prasnapradipa written by Mahadeva, the author of the Muhurtadipaka, in Kaccha in 1647; the Prasnamarga29 composed by Natha,30 a member of the Panakkattu31 family of Itakkat in Kerala, in 1650(the author wrote his owntiled on this, the Durgamarthaprakasini); and the Prasnasiromani32 composed by that Rudramani Tripathin who wrote the Ramalenduprakasa in 1682. As in the cases of the other astrological sciences in India, interest in pradna has continued into modern times.

CHAPTER VIII
ENCYCLOPAEDIAS AND DICTIONARIES
Some early authors on jyotisa, such as Varahamihira, Lalla, Sripati, and Bhojaraja, wrote works on several of this sdstra'sbranches. Inthis chapter I wish to consider those who attempted to encompass the same diversity within one work. The earliest of such authors is a Buddhist Mahasthavira from Srllarika, Anavamadarsin Sangharaja1 ofthe Hastavanagalya Mahavihara, who wrote his Daivajfiakamadhenu2 during the reign of Parakramabahu II(1236—1271), apparently in 1241.This deals with omens, jdtaka, muhurta, and praina. Anavamadarsin's sources include Varahamihira and Bhojaraja. In 1315 the Jaina scholar Thakkura Pheru3 composed in Prakrit at Kannanapura aJyotisasara4 on astronomy, jdtaka,and muhurta. To this isaddeda separate wrork onmathematics, theGanitasara,5 also in Prakrit. The next work that ought to be placed inthis category combines jdtakawith muhurta; it is Srinivasa's Suddhidipika.6 His date is a matter of great uncertainty, buthe probably flourished inthe fourteenth or fifteenth century. The earliest dated manuscript wascopied in 1607; but a commentary, the Arthakaumudi, had been penned byGovindananda Kavikankana7 nearly a century before. TheSuddhidipika waspopular primarily inBengal and Mithila, so that this Srmivasa probably lived in that area of India. Suramahatha Sivadasa, (orSivaraja), however, the author of the largest extant astrological nibandha, theJyotirnibandha,8 probably lived in Maharastra or Madhya Pradesa. Though the edited text contains various additions from

the seventeenth century9 (its relation to the revision by Krsna,10 the Samhitasara, has not been investigated), the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1579 and the JN was cited by Pitambara and others earlier in the sixteenth century. Moreover, Sivadasa (p. 25) mentions 1440 as the first year of a sixtyyear cycle, which it was in the Northern Cycle. One must conclude, therefore, that he wrote in the latter half of the fifteenth century. His work is an extraordinarily rich collection of excerpts on all branches of astrology and some branches of divination from a wide range of named sources, many of which are no longer extant. A thorough investigation of Sivadasa's manuscripts and his sources would do much to illuminate the rather obscure history of Indian astrology outside of Gujarat in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The most extensive encyclopaedia of science conceived and executed in premodern India was the Todarananda11 in twenty-three saukhyas sponsored by Todaramalla,12 an official in Akbar's government from at least 1565 till his death in 1589. He entrusted the Jyautisasaukhya, the third section, along with several sections on branches of dharmaSdstra to Nilakantha, who later wrote the far more influential Tajikanilakanthi and Pras"nakaumudi. Nilakantha completed the Jyautisasaukhya in 1572; it contains three skandhas~on samhitd (omens), on ganita (astronomy; it is not known whether or not mathematics was included), and on hard (genethlialogy). There are also two saukhyas by Nilakantha on muhurta, one of which does not appear as part of Todaramalla's plan as reconstructed; these are the Vivahasaukhya and the Vastusaukhya, which latter is saukhya 5. Judging from the quality of Nilakantha's published works these encyclopedic opera would be well worth investigating. On a smaller scale Krpasankara13 composed a Jyotiskedara14 in 1627. This work has four avails: samhitd(including muhurta) ganita(astronomy only), hord (jdtakaand tdjika), and prasna. There is a commentary by Cirarijiva Bhatta,15 who wrote a Ramapraka^a at Indurakhi, Gwalior, in 1647. At about the same time Suka composed a Jyotisasara16 that is primarily on muhurta,but includes a substantial amount of jdtakaand pradna material. The earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1647. It was probably in the eighteenth century that someone claiming to be the great poet, Kalidasa,17 wrote an

Ko&a
Though various normal Sanskrit dictionaries contain definitions of terms used in astronomy and astrology (e.g., a large part of the first Jchanda of Amarasimha's Linganusasana), very few specialized dictionaries of such terms were produced. It appears that the only one describing the traditional Sanskrit vocabulary is Haridatta's Ganitanamamala,19 of which the earliest dated manuscript was copied in 1697. Krsnadasa,20 a protege of Akbar, wrote a Parasiprakasa21 in about 1575. This work consists of two parts: a PersianSanskrit dictionary (including terms relating to the heavens, to the directions, and to time), and a Persian grammar in Sanskrit. This, however, was entirely insufficient for translators of Persian astronomical and astrological works into Sanskrit; so,in 1643, Malajit,22 who received the title Vedangaraya from Shah Jahan, wrote his Paraslprakasa at Sristhala in Gujarat. In consideration ofthe numerous translations made from Persian and Arabic, both in the Mughal period and before, one must conclude that many other aids were available. The one that we are definitely informed of is the bilingual Muhammad Abidda who assisted Nayanasukhopadhyaya; and it should also be noted that many Persian technical terms used by al-Qushji are given their Sanskrit equivalents in the Hayatagrantha.

CHAPTER. IX
TRANSMISSION OF JYOTIHSASTRA
At present there exist in India and outside of it some 100,000 manuscripts on the various aspects of jyotiMdstra. The great majority of these were copied within the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries; for manuscripts cannot long survive in India except under exceptional circumstances. We have, therefore, essentially only those texts selected for study or composed by the scholars of the Mughal and British rdjyas.Since the practice of copying manuscripts is virtually dead in modern India, many of these estimated 100,000 manuscripts will soon disappear, and the possibilities of our achieving a reasonably accurate assessment of the continuity, development, and transformation of the astral and mathematical sciences in India will be correspondingly diminished. But even without this appalling prospect, we must constantly be aware of the arbitrary way in which was made the selection of texts and commentaries preserved in today's libraries. For manuscripts were preserved, with some exceptions, in India before the nineteenth century in family libraries. It is true that Anupasimha,1 the Maharaja of Bikaner in Rajasthan from 1674 till 1698, formed a vast collection rich in jyotiMdstra manuscripts (many from the Deccan, where he campaigned with Aurangzib) that still survives intact in the Anup Sanskrit Library; that the core of the Sarasvati Mahal Library in Tanjore goes back to Tulajaraja,2 the Maharaja of Tanjore from 1728 till 1736, and his predecessors; that, at the same time, Savai Jayasimha collected some of the manuscripts now in the Jayapura Museum; and that the incredible treasures of a number of the ancient Jaina Bhandaras of Gujarat and Rajasthan have been accumulating since the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Still, most of our manuscripts were in small private collections till recently—or still are. And these small collections tend to preserve a few of the accepted astronomical works of the region (if the family
produces pancdngas) and the standard works on jdtaka,tdjika, muhurta, prasna^ and samhitd (if they are astrologers); beyond this they might contain locally popular works, or even manuscripts—sometimes unique—of treatises composed by members of their own families. Since education in the sdstra was through a guru normally rather than through a pdthasdld or matha, the enrichment of these family libraries was probably most common when a son was sent to study with an external guru;one of the most notable examples of this that we have is

Divakara of Golagrama, whose family we shall soon discuss. In large cultural centers like Kas"I, of course, intercourse was easier. And Jaina monks in their ordained peregrinations spread both learning and manuscripts. It was a recognized pious act for a Jaina layman to bear theexpense of the copying of manuscripts for these monks; and many of them, as we know from their colophons, occupied the rainy seasons with scribal work. It is clear, then, that chance hasto a large extent determined what has survived ofthe truly immense body ofmaterial on jyotihsastra that has existed in thepast. Asan example of this, let us examine themembers of the Girinarayanajilati3 of Gujarat, who areknown primarily because much of their family library was included in the gift of manuscripts presented to the East India Company by the Gaikawar of Baroda in 1809.4 Many of them copied extant manuscripts (their names are followed byS), and some were authors of original works (see Table 7). Though there areseveral gaps at present in our knowledge of the precise relationship of several generations of this family, it is clear that they were active asscribes and authors from about 1500 till 1750; and that, if their library had notbeen preserved by the Gaikawar's gift, we would not know of the Ganitacudamani of Harihara or the Grahavidyadhara of Vidyadhara (there is just one other manuscript of his Paiicangavidyadharl besides that inthe family collection), and a number of the relatively rare works would beattested byaneven smaller number ofextant copies. Another case that it is instructive to examine is that of the family which produced the great Bhaskara in the twelfth century (see Table 85) and which lived in the Sahyadri range, though we possess no manuscripts from their family library. That library presumably was part of the endowment of the matha established by Soldeva under the Yadava Singhana atPatna in Khandesh in 1207for the study of the works of Bhaskara; Bhaskara's grandson, Cangadeva, was one ofSinghana's court astrologers, aswas also Bhaskara's nephew's son, Anantadeva. It is regrettable, then, that we no longer have either of Anantadeva's works orhis great grandfather, Mahesvara's, Karanas"ekhara. However, we dohave one treatise that may well have been written bya student of the matha;this is theLaghukhecarasiddhi composed by Srldhara in 1227, a rare work of which one of the three available manuscripts was copied by Nllakantha of the Girinarayanajnati at Jlrnadurga in1555. Whatever the fate of the matha and its library after the fall of Devagiri in 1312, the region was particularly fertile inproducing families oijyotisls who

PINGREE, !§rldhara's Laghukhecarasiddhi, Baroda 1976, pp. 10—16. 5 The earliest known member of the family, Trivikrama, is sometimes identified with the author of the Damayantlkatha, who was the son of Nemaditya, the son of Sridhara of the f§aNdilyagotra. However, this identification is unlikely since Trivikrama the son of Nemaditya composed the Navasari grant of Rastrakuta Indra III in 915, while our Trivikrama's son Bhaskara was honored by Bhojaraja a century later.

were proud to preserve their lineages. One center of activity was Parthapura on the Godavari, which has been identified with Pathri in the Parbhani District some eighty miles southeast of Devagiri, whose Muslim lord ruled the area for much of the medieval period. In Parthapura flourished from about 13006 the family that produced Jflanaraja, Suryadasa, and others (see Table 9). In keeping with the traditions of the region, several members of this family wrote works dependent on those of Bhaskara; their family library clearly contained copies of his opera. We are lucky to have a partial genealogy of the descendents of Suryadasa provided by one of them in 1895.7 Suryadasa's great-grandson in this lineage was a Gopala, who lived from 1623 till 1668. He is not identical with the father of Viresvara (see Table 10), a fellow resident of Parthapura, since Viresvara was old enough to comment on Bhaskara's L in 1639; but he may be a cousin (perhaps once or several times removed). Some of the manuscripts belonging to this family could be ascertained by a careful examination of their works; whether or not Viresvara had access to the same library might be then determined by reading his commentaries and other treatises. In a village in the district (desa) of Parthapura named Golagrama another family of the Bharadvajagotra began its career in the middle of the fifteenth century (see Table 11); it is linked to the family we have just discussed by the fact that one of VlresVara's works is a commentary on one of Divakara's astrological treatises. However, its history is quite different; for in the early sixteenth century that Divakara's great-grandfather, also named Divakara, went to Nandigrama to study with the famous Ganesa (see Table 12). From Gujarat he evidently travelled to Kasi, where his descendents became one of the two prominent families of jyotisis in the seventeenth century. Divakara presumably brought with him copies of his guru's works and those of his guru's father, KeSava; and we find that a considerable portion of the scholarly energy of the family was devoted to explicating the various treatises of Kes"ava and Ganesa. However, following the local preference in Kas"i, they also expounded the Saurapaksa; and they were receptive to some elements of Islamic astronomy. The rival family in Kail (see Table 13) in the seventeenth century originated at Dadhigrama on the Payosni to the northwest of Parthapura; for Munisvara places it near Gangabhaisilanagara near the Godavari (perhaps Gangapur in the Aurangabad District), in the district (samadeia) of Elavapura (Ellora). The Payosni on whose bank Dadhigrama lies, then, must be the Purna that eventually flows into the Godavari some thirty miles to the east of Parthapura, though Dadhigrama would have been near the headwaters, just south of Bhaskara's Sahyadri range. This family traces its history back to the middle of the fifteenth century also, and moved to Kasi in the late sixteenth century. Its interests were divided between Bhaskara's works, the Saurapaksa, and

GanesVs works, while some of its members vehemently attacked members of the Golagrama family for their acceptance of Islamic astronomical theories. Another family (see Table 14) that flourished in the same area came originally from an unidentified place called SasamanUra, but had settled in Tapara to the north of Devagiri in the late sixteenth century. One last case may be considered to illustrate the influx of jyotisls from Vidarbha into Kail in the sixteenth century. This family (see Table 15) originated at Dharmapura on the Narmada in the early part of that century, but became prominent—primarily as astrologers—at Kasi toward the end of the century. This pattern of families of jyotisls equipped with their own libraries that we can trace in some instances over several centuries was not the norm in South India, though family connections there also obviously had a strong influence. The area that is best known is Kerala, where libraries were maintained at the family Mam, but where new members of the "school" were often recruited from outside the family. The most impressive line is that of ParamesVara8 (see Table 16); it can be continued from Acyuta to the middle of the nineteenth century.9 Other, lesser lines are known from Kerala; unfortunately, our information from other Dravidian-speaking areas is not detailed enough to discern any such pattern (but see Table 17). However, the continuation of these traditions throughout India was, of course, due not only to the transmission of learning from father to son or from guru to iisya; it was also actively cultivated by the patronage of the powerfulusually Maharajas. Thus the court of Paramara Bhojaraja at Dhara produced a number of jyotisa treatises under the Maharaja's name in the early eleventh century, and provided encouragement to Bhaskara's great-great-great-grandfather, and probably to Dasubala as well. Mughal patronage of Sanskrit works on jyotisa in the sixteenth and seventeenth century was extremely generous.10 And, of course, various of the courts of Rajasthan in the same period—and into the nineteenth century in some cases—maintained jyotisls, many of whom became authors. But a more interesting development occurred in Gujarat under the Caulukyas. A number of their leading state officials or members of their families, belonging primarily to the Pragvatavamsa (see Tables 18, 19, and 20), though there are also some who belonged to the Janyalayakula (see Table 21), wrote on jyotisa. The reasons for this phenomenon are not apparent. Naturally, other scholars worked in this field under the Caulukyas who were not members of ministerial families; such are the Jaina Naracandropadhyaya, who composed one of his works at Campavati in 1167 under Caulukya Kumarapala, and

Narapati, the son of Naradeva of Dhara, who completed the Narapatijayacarya at Anahilanagara in 1177 under Caulukya Ajayapala. But there was another relationship that we can observe in Gujarat in this period. Jaina monks such as Naracandropadhyaya often became authors of jyotisa texts; but we usually are ignorant of the intellectual climate and economic situation under which they labored. Vastupala, the minister of Caulukya [Vaghela] Viradhavala and Visaladeva at Dhavalakka (Dholka, Gujarat) from 1220 till his death in 1240 and a Jaina member of the Pragvatavamsa, was a great patron of Jaina scholars,11 among whom were numbered two jyotisls: Udayaprabha Suri and Naracandra Suri. The extent to which these men, or others, Jaina or Hindu, who received princely rewards for their scientific activities, were encouraged and assisted by the milieus provided by their patrons must have varied from individual to individual. But it must be recognized that this patronage of scholars by the powerful, sporadic as it was (it seems to have been more frequent and sustained over longer periods in Gujarat and Rajasthan than elsewhere in India), served as an alternative mode for the intermingling of traditions, the production of new works, and the copying and preservation of manuscripts to the more traditional family libraries and Jaina bhdnddras. When CESS is completed, it will be possible to analyze the surviving evidence concerning who copied manuscripts (often we observe families of scribes functioning for as many generations as the families of jyotisls) and who owned them. Until then I leave the question at this point.
