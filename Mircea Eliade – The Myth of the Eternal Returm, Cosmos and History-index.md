PREFACE TO THE
TORCHBOOK EDITION
I AM delighted that this little book is to be republished
in the Harper Torchbook series, especially because it has
given me the opportunity to restore the original title. The manuscript that I began in May, 1945, was headed Cosmos and History. It was only later that I changed
its title to Archetypes and Repetition. But finally, at the
suggestion of the French publisher, I made Archetypes
and Repetition the subtitle, and the book was published in 1949 as The Myth of the Eternal Return (Le Mythe
de reternel retour). This has sometimes given rise to
misunderstandings. For one thing, the archaic ideology of ritual repetition, which was the central subject of my
study, does not always imply the "myth of the eternal
return. " And then too, such a title could lead the reader
to suppose that the book was principally concerned with
the celebrated Greek myth or with its modern reinterpre
tation by Nietzsche, which is by no means the case.
The essential theme of my investigation bears on the
image of himself formed by the man of the archaic
societies and on the place that he assumes in the Cosmos.
The chief difference between the man of the archaic and
traditional societies and the man of the modern societies
with their strong imprint of Judaeo-Christianity lies in the fact that the former feels himself indissolubly con
nected with the Cosmos and the cosmic rhythms, whereas
the latter insists that he is connected only with History.
Of course, for the man of the archaic societies, the Cosmos

too has a "history," if only because it is the creation of
the gods and is held to have been organized by super
natural beings or mythical heroes. But this " history " of the Cosmos and of human society is a "sacred history,"
preserved and transmitted through myths. More than
that, it is a "history" than can be repeated indefinitely, in the sense that the myths serve as models for cere
monies that periodically reactualize the tremendous events that occurred at the beginning of time. The myths
preserve and transmit the paradigms/ the exemplary models, for all the responsible activities in which men engage. By virtue of these paradigmatic models revealed
to men in mythical times, the Cosmos and society are
periodically regenerated. Later on in this book I discuss
the effects that this faithful reproduction of paradigms
and this ritual repetition of mythical events will have
on the religious ideology of the archaic peoples. It is not difficult to understand why such an ideology makes it
impossible that what we today call a "historical consciousness" should develop. In the course of the book I have used the terms "ex
emplary models," "paradigms," and "archetypes" in order, to emphasize a particular fact namely, that for
the man of the traditional and archaic societies, the models for his institutions and the norms for his various
categories of behavior are believed to have been "re
vealed" at the beginning of time, that, consequently, they are regarded as having a superhuman and "transcendental" origin. In using the term "archetype," I neglected to specify that I was not referring to the archetypes described by Professor C. GL Jung. This was a
regrettable error. For to use, in an entirely different
meaning, a term that plays a role of primary importance in Jung's psychology could lead to confusion. I need
viii



PREFACE TO THE TOBCHBOOK EDITION
scarcely say that, for Professor Jung, the archetypes are structures of the collective unconscious. But in my
book I nowhere touch upon the problems of depth psy
chology nor do I use the concept of the collective un
conscious. As I have said, I use the term "archetype,"
just as Eugenio d'Ors does, as a synonym for "exemplary model" or "paradigm," that is, in the last
analysis, in the Augustinian sense. But in our day the word has been rehabilitated by Professor Jung, who has
given it a new meaning; and it is certainly desirable that the term "archetype" should no longer be used in its
pre-Jungian sense unless the fact is distinctly stated.
An author is seldom satisfied with his work ten years
after finishing it. There is no doubt that, if I were writing
this little book now, it would be very different. Yet such
as it is, with all its faults of commission and omission, I still consider it the most significant of my books ; and
when I am asked in what order they should be read, I
always recommend beginning with Cosmos and History. To some of the problems treated in it I have returned
in my later publications, especially in Images et symboles (Paris, 1952) and Mythes, reves et mysteres (Paris,
1957). A new presentation of archaic mythology periodically reactualized as "sacred history" is outlined in my
recent book on initiations, Birth and Rebirth (Harper,
1958). MIBOEA. ELIADE

FOREWORD
HAD WE not feared to appear overambitious, we should have
given this book a subtitle: Introduction to a Philosophy of History.
For such, after all, is the purport of the present essay; but with the distinction that, instead of proceeding to a specu
lative analysis of the historical phenomenon, it examines the
fundamental concepts of archaic societies societies which, al
though they are conscious of a certain form of "history," make
every effort to disregard it. In studying these traditional socie
ties, one characteristic has especially struck us: it is their revolt
against concrete, historical time, their nostalgia for a periodical return to the mythical time of the beginning of things, to the "Great Time." The meaning and function of what we have
called "archetypes and repetition" disclosed themselves to us
only after we had perceived these societies' will to refuse con
crete time, their hostility toward every attempt at autonomous
"history," that is, at history not regulated by archetypes. This dismissal, this opposition, are not merely the effect of the con
servative tendencies of primitive societies, as this book proves.
In our opinion, it is justifiable to read in this depreciation of history (that is, of events without transhistorical models), and
in this rejection of profane, continuous time, a certain metaphysical "valorization" of human existence. But this valoriza
tion is emphatically not that which certain post-Hegelian
philosophical currents notably Marxism, historicism, and existentialism have sought to give to it since the discovery of "historical man," of the man who is insofar as he makes him
self, within history. xi



FOREWORD
The problem of history as history, however, will not be
directly approached in this essay. Our chief intent has been to
set forth certain governing lines of force in the speculative field
of archaic societies. It seemed to us that a simple presentation of
this field would not be without interest, especially for the
philosopher accustomed to finding his problems and the means of solving them in the texts of classic philosophy or in the
situations of the spiritual history of the West. With us, it is an
old conviction that Western philosophy is dangerously close to
"provincializing" itself (if the expression be permitted): first
by jealously isolating itself in its own tradition and ignoring,
for example, the problems and solutions of Oriental thought;
second by its obstinate refusal to recognize any "situations"
except those of the man of the historical civilizations, in defiance
of the experience of "primitive" man, of man as a member of
the traditional societies. We hold that philosophical anthro
pology would have something to learn from the valorization
that pre-Socratic man (in other words, traditional man) accorded
to his situation in the universe. Better yet: that the cardinal
problems of metaphysics could be renewed through a knowledge of archaic ontology. In several previous works, especially in our
Traite d'histoire des religions, we attempted to present the
principles of this archaic ontology, without claiming, of course,
to have succeeded in giving a coherent, still less an exhaustive,
exposition of it. This study, likewise, does not attempt to be exhaustive.
Addressing ourselves both to the philosopher and to the eth
nologist or orientalist, but above all to the cultivated man, to
the nonspecialist, we have often compressed into brief state
ments what, if duly investigated and differentiated, would de
mand a substantial book. Any thoroughgoing discussion would
have entailed a marshaling of sources and a technical language
that would have discouraged many readers. But instead of
furnishing specialists with a series of marginal comments upon xii



FOREWORD
their particular problems, our concern has been to draw the
attention of the philosopher, and of the cultivated man in gen
eral, to certain spiritual positions that, although they have been transcended in various regions of the globe, are instructive for
our knowledge of man and for man's history itself.
This essay appeared in French in 1949 as Le Mythe de Veternel
retour: archetypes et repetition (Paris, Librairie Gallimard). On the occasion of the present English translation we have revised
and enlarged the text and have included in the footnotes ref
erences to certain studies published within the last few years.

The Problem
book undertakes to study certain aspects of archaic
A ontology more precisely, the conceptions of being
and reality that can be read from the behavior of the man of
the premodern societies. The premodern or "traditional" societies include both the world usually known as "primi
tive" and the ancient cultures of Asia, Europe, and Amer
ica. Obviously, the metaphysical concepts of the archaic world were not always formulated in theoretical language;
but the symbol, the myth, the rite, express, on different
planes and through the means proper to them, a complex system of coherent affirmations about the ultimate reality
of things, a system that can be regarded as constituting a metaphysics. It is, however, essential to understand the
deep meaning of all these symbols, myths, and rites, in order to succeed in translating them into our habitual lan
guage. If one goes to the trouble of penetrating the au
thentic meaning of an archaic myth or symbol, one cannot
but observe that this meaning shows a recognition of a
certain situation in the cosmos and that, consequently, it
implies a metaphysical position. It is useless to search archaic languages for the terms so laboriously created by the
great philosophical traditions: there is every likelihood
that such words as "being," "nonbeing," "real," "unreal," "becoming," "illusory," are not to be found in the lan
guage of the Australians or of the ancient Mesopotamians.
But if the word is lacking, the thing is present; only it is "said" that is, revealed in a coherent fashion through
symbols and myths. If we observe the general behavior of archaic man, we
are struck by the following fact: neither the objects of the
external world nor human acts, properly speaking, have
any autonomous intrinsic value. Objects or acts acquire a
$



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
value, and in so doing become real, because they partici
pate, after one fashion or another, in a reality that tran
scends them. Among countless stones, one stone becomes
sacred and hence instantly becomes saturated with being
because it constitutes a hierophany, or possesses mana, or again because it commemorates a mythical act, and so
on. The object appears as the receptacle of an exterior force that differentiates it from its milieu and gives it meaning and value. This force may reside in the substance
of the object or in its form; a rock reveals itself to be
sacred because its very existence is a hierophany: incom
pressible, invulnerable, it is that which man is not. It re
sists time; its reality is coupled with perenniality. Take the commonest of stones; it will be raised to the rank of
"precious," that is, impregnated with a magical or religious power by virtue of its symbolic shape or its origin: thunderstone, held to have fallen from the sky; pearl, because it comes from the depths of the sea. Other stones
will be sacred because they are the dwelling place of the
souls of ancestors (India, Indonesia), or because they were
once the scene of a theophany (as the bethel that served Jacob for a bed) , or because a sacrifice or an oath has con
secrated them. 1 Now let us turn to human acts those, of course, which
do not arise from pure automatism. Their meaning, their value, are not connected with their crude physical datum
but with their property of reproducing a primordial act, of repeating a mythical example. Nutrition is not a simple physiological operation; it renews a communion. Marriage and the collective orgy echo mythical prototypes; they are repeated because they were consecrated in the beginning
("in those days," in illo tempore, ab origine) by gods, ancestors, or heroes.

ARCHETYPES AND REPETITION
In the particulars of his conscious behavior, the "primitive," the archaic man, acknowledges no act which has not
been previously posited and lived by someone else, some
other being who was not a man. What he does has been
done before. His life is the ceaseless repetition of gestures initiated by others.
This conscious repetition of given paradigmatic gestures
reveals an original ontology. The crude product of nature,
the object fashioned by the industry of man, acquire their
reality, their identity, only to the extent of their participa
tion in a transcendent reality. The gesture acquires mean
ing, reality, solely to the extent to which it repeats a
primordial act. Various groups of facts, drawn here and there from dif
ferent cultures, will help us to identify the structure of this
archaic ontology. We have first sought out examples likely to show, as clearly as possible, the mechanism of tradi
tional thought; in other words, facts which help us to
understand how and why, for the man of the premodern
societies, certain things become real. It is essential to understand this mechanism thoroughly,
in order that we may afterward approach the problem of
human existence and of history within the horizon of ar
chaic spirituality.
We have distributed our collection of facts under several
principal headings: 1 . Facts which show us that, for archaic man, reality is
a function of the imitation of a celestial archetype.
2. Facts which show us how reality is conferred through
participation in the "symbolism of the Center": cities, temples, houses become real by the fact of being assimi
lated to the "center of the world."
3. Finally, rituals and significant profane gestures which acquire the meaning attributed to them, and materialize
5



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
that meaning, only because they deliberately repeat such and such acts posited ab origine by gods, heroes, or an
cestors. The presentation of these facts will in itself lay the
groundwork for a study and interpretation of the ontologi
cal conception underlying them.
Celestial Archetypes of Territories,
Temples, and Cities
ACCORDING to Mesopotamian beliefs, the Tigris has its model in the star Anunit and the Euphrates in the star of
the Swallow. 2 A Sumerian text tells of the "place of the
creation of the gods," where "the [clivinity of] the flocks
and grains" is to be found. 3 For the Ural-Altaic peoples
the mountains, in the same way, have an ideal prototype in the sky.4 In Egypt, places and nomes were named after
the celestial "fields": first the celestial fields were known,
then they were identified in terrestrial geography. 6
In Iranian cosmology of the Zarvanitic tradition, "every
terrestrial phenomenon, whether abstract or concrete, cor
responds to a celestial, transcendent invisible term, to an
"idea" in the Platonic sense. Each thing, each notion pre
sents itself under a double aspect: that of mSndk and that of
gltik. There is a visible sky: hence there is also a mSndk
sky which is invisible (Bundahisn, Ch. I). Our earth corre
sponds to a celestial earth. Each virtue practiced here be
low, in the gzttih, has a celestial counterpart which repre
sents true reality. . . . The year, prayer ... in short, whatever is manifested in the gtt&h, is at the same time

. The creation is simply duplicated. From the cos
mogonic point of view the cosmic stage called m&iok pre
cedes the stage ggtlk." 6
The temple in particular pre-eminently the sacred place had a celestial prototype. On Mount Sinai, Jehovah shows Moses the "form" of the sanctuary that he is to
build for him: "According to all that I shew thee, after
the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it. ... And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount" (Exodus 25 : 9, 40). And when
David gives his son Solomon the plan for the temple build
ings, for the tabernacle, and for all their utensils, he assures him that "All this . . . the Lord made me understand in
writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern** (I Chronicles 28 : 19). Hence he had seen the
celestial model. 7
The earliest document referring to the archetype of a
sanctuary is Gudea's inscription concerning the temple he built at Lagash. In a dream the king sees the goddess Nidaba, who shows him a tablet on which the beneficent
stars are named, and a god who reveals the plan of the
temple to him. 8 Cities too have their divine prototypes.
All the Babylonian cities had their archetypes in the con

Journal Asiatique (Paris), CCXIX (July-Sept., 1931), pp. 35-36. But, as Henry
Corbin rightly remarks, "we must avoid reducing the contrast which they the
men5k and the gttlk^ express to a mere Platonic schema. What is involved is not
exactly an opposition between Idea and Matter, nor yet between universal and sensible. M$nQJc is rather to be translated by 'celestial state' invisible, subtle, spiritual, but perfectly concrete. Gtttk designates a terrestrial state visible, cer
tainly material, but of a matter which in itself is luminous, an immaterial matter
in comparison with the matter which we actually know." Corbin, "Le Temps

stellations: Sippara in Cancer, Nineveh in Ursa Major,
Assur in Arcturus, etc. Sennacherib has Nineveh built ac
cording to the "form . . . delineated from distant ages
by the writing of the heaven-of-stars/' Not only does a
model precede terrestrial architecture, but the model is
also situated in an ideal (celestial) region of eternity. This is what Solomon announces: 'Thou gavest command to
build a sanctuary in thy holy mountain, And an altar in
the city of thy habitation, A copy of the holy tabernacle which thou preparedst aforehand from the beginning/' 10
A celestial Jerusalem was created by God before the city
was built by the hand of man; it is to the former that the
prophet refers in the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch II, 4
: 2-7: " 'Dost thou think that this is that city of which I
said: "On the palms of My hands have I graven thee"?
This building now built in your midst is not that which is revealed with Me, that which was prepared beforehand
here from the time when I took counsel to make Paradise,
and showed it to Adam before he sinned . . / " n The
heavenly Jerusalem kindled the inspiration of all the Hebrew prophets: Tobias 13:16; Isaiah 59 : 1 1 ff.; Ezekiel 60,
etc. To show him the city of Jerusalem, God lays hold of
Ezekiel in an ecstatic vision and transports him to a very
high mountain. And the Sibylline Oracles preserve the
memory of the New Jerusalem in the center of which there
shines "a temple . . . with a giant tower touching the very clouds and seen of all . . /' 12 But the most beautiful
description of the heavenly Jerusalem occurs in the Apoc

alypse (1 : sff.): "And I John saw the holy city, new
Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband/'
We find the same theory in India: all the Indian royal
cities, even the modern ones, are built after the mythical
model of the celestial city where, in the age of gold (in
illo tempore), the Universal Sovereign dwelt. And, like the
latter, the king attempts to revive the age of gold, to
make a perfect reign a present reality an idea which we shall encounter again in the course of this study. Thus, for
example, the palace-fortress of Sigiriya, in Ceylon, is built after the model of the celestial city Alakamanda and is
"hard of ascent for human beings" (Mahavastu, 39, 2). Plato's ideal city likewise has a celestial archetype (Re
public, 592b; cf. 500<?). The Platonic "forms'' are not astral;
yet their mythical region is situated on supraterrestrial planes (Phaedrus, 247, 50). The world that surrounds us, then, the world in which
the presence and the work of man are felt the mountains
that he climbs, populated and cultivated regions, navigable rivers, cities, sanctuaries all these have an extraterres
trial archetype, be it conceived as a plan, as a form, or
purely and simply as a "double" existing on a higher cosmic level. But everything in the world that surrounds
us does not have a prototype of this kind. For example,
desert regions inhabited by monsters, uncultivated lands,
unknown seas on which no navigator has dared to venture,
do not share with the city of Babylon, or the Egyptian
nome, the privilege of a differentiated prototype. They cor
respond to a mythical model, but of another nature: all
these wild, uncultivated regions and the like are assimilated
to chaos; they still participate in the undifferentiated, form
less modality of pre-Creation. This is why, when posses9



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
sion Is taken of a territory that is, when its exploitation
begins rites are performed that symbolically repeat the act of Creation: the uncultivated zone is first "cosmicized,"
then inhabited. We shall presently return to the meaning
of this ceremonial taking possession of newly discovered
countries. For the moment, what we wish to emphasize
is the fact that the world which surrounds us, civilized by
the hand of man, is accorded no validity beyond that which
is due to the extraterrestrial prototype that served as its
model. Man constructs according to an archetype. Not
only do his city or his temple have celestial models; the
same is true of the entire region that he inhabits, with the
rivers that water it, the fields that give him his food, etc.
The map of Babylon shows the city at the center of a vast
circular territory bordered by a river, precisely as the Sumerians envisioned Paradise. This participation by urban
cultures in an archetypal model is what gives them their
reality and their validity. Settlement in a new, unknown, uncultivated country is
equivalent to an act of Creation. When the Scandinavian
colonists took possession of Iceland, Landnama, and began to cultivate it, they regarded this act neither as an original
undertaking nor as human and profane work. Their enter
prise was for them only the repetition of a primordial act: the transformation of chaos into cosmos by the divine act
of Creation. By cultivating the desert soil, they in fact
repeated the act of the gods, who organized chaos by giving it forms and norms. 13 Better still, a territorial conquest
does not become real until after more precisely, through
the ritual of taking possession, which is only a copy of the primordial act of the Creation of the World. In
Vedic India the erection of an altar dedicated to Agni
13 Cf, van Hamel, cited by Gerardus van der Leeuw, VHomme primitif et la religion (French trans., Paris, 1940), p. 110.

ARCHETYPES AND REPETITION
constituted legal taking possession of a territory. 14 "One settles (avasyati) when he builds the garhapatya, and who
ever are builders of fire-altars are 'settled' (avasitaK)"
says the Satapatha Brdhma^a (VII, 1 , 1, 1-4). But the erection of an altar dedicated to Agni is merely the micro
cosmic imitation of the Creation. Furthermore, any sacri
fice is, in turn, the repetition of the act of Creation, as Indian texts explicitly state. 15 It was in the name of Jesus
Christ that the Spanish and Portuguese conquistadores took possession of the islands and continents that they had
discovered and conquered. The setting up of the Cross was
equivalent to a justification and to the consecration of the
new country, to a "new birth/* thus repeating baptism (act of Creation). In their turn the English navigators took possession of conquered countries in the name of the king of England, new Cosmocrator.
The importance of the Vedic, Scandinavian, or Roman
ceremonials will appear more clearly when we devote a
separate examination to the meaning of the repetition of
the Creation, the pre-eminently divine act. For the mo
ment, let us keep one fact in view: every territory occupied for the purpose of being inhabited or utilized as Lebensraum
is first of all transformed from chaos into cosmos; that is,
through the effect of ritual it is given a "form" which
makes it become real. Evidently, for the archaic mentality,
reality manifests itself as force, effectiveness, and duration.
Hence the outstanding reality is the sacred; for only the sacred is in an absolute fashion, acts effectively, creates things and makes them endure. The innumerable gestures
of consecration of tracts and territories, of objects, of
men, etc. reveal the primitive's obsession with the real,
his thirst for being.

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
The Symbolism of the Center
PARALLELING the archaic belief in the celestial archetypes
of cities and temples, and even more fully attested by docu
ments, there is, we find, another series of beliefs, which re
fer to their being invested with the prestige of the Center.
We examined this problem in an earlier work; 16 here we
shall merely recapitulate our conclusions. The architectonic
symbolism of the Center may be formulated as follows:
1. The Sacred Mountain where heaven and earth meet is situated at the center of the world.
. Every temple or palace and, by extension, every sacred city or royal residence is a Sacred Mountain, thus
becoming a Center.
3. Being an axis mundi, the sacred city or temple is re
garded as the meeting point of heaven, earth, and hell.
A few examples will illustrate each of these symbols:
1. According to Indian beliefs, Mount Meru rises at the center of the world, and above it shines the polestar.
The Ural-Altaic peoples also know of a central mountain,
Sumeru, to whose summit the polestar is fixed. Iranian
beliefs hold that the sacred mountain Haraberezaiti (El
burz) is situated at the center of the earth and is linked with
heaven. 17 The Buddhist population of Laos, north of Siam,
know of Mount Zinnalo, at the center of the world. In the
Edda, Himinbjorg, as its name indicates, is a "celestial mountain"; it is here that the rainbow (Bifrost) reaches the dome of the sky. Similar beliefs are found among the

Finns, the Japanese, and other peoples. We are reminded that for the Semangs of the Malay Peninsula an immense
rock, Batu-Ribn, rises at the center of the world; above it is hell. In past times, a tree trunk on Batu-Ribn rose into the
sky. 18 Hell, the center of the earth, and the "gate" of the
sky are, then, situated on the same axis, and it is along this
axis that passage from one cosmic region to another was
effected. We should hesitate to credit the authenticity of
this cosmological theory among the Semang pygmies if
we did not have evidence that the same theory already
existed in outline during the prehistoric period. 19 According to Mesopotamian beliefs, a central mountain joins
heaven and earth; it is the Mount of the Lands, 20 the con

gurat was a cosmic mountain, i.e., a symbolic image of the cosmos, the seven stories representing the seven planetary heavens ( as at Borsippa) or having the colors of the world
(as at Ur). Mount Tabor, in Palestine, could mean tabbur, i.e., navel, omphalos. Mount Gerizim, in the center of Palestine,
was undoubtedly invested with the prestige of the Center, for it is called "navel of the earth" (tabbur eres; cf. Judges

to the summit of the cosmic mountain was not covered by
the Deluge. A rabbinic text says: "The land of Israel was
not submerged by the deluge." 21 For Christians, Golgotha was situated at the center of the world, since it was the summit of the cosmic mountain and at the same time the place where Adam had been created and buried. Thus the blood of the Saviour falls upon Adam's skull, buried precisely at the foot of the Cross, and redeems him. The belief that Golgotha is situated at the center of the world
is preserved in the folklore of the Eastern Christians. 22

Babylon was a Bab-ilani, a "gate of the gods," for it was there that the gods descended to earth. In the capital of the
Chinese sovereign, the gnomon must cast no shadow at
noon on the day of the summer solstice. Such a capital is,
in effect, at the center of the universe, close to the mirac

temple of Borobudur is itself an image of the cosmos, and
is built like an artificial mountain ( as were the ziggurats) .
Ascending it, the pilgrim approaches the center of the world, and, on the highest terrace, breaks from one plane
to another, transcending profane, heterogeneous space and entering a "pure region/' Cities and sacred places are assimilated to the summits of cosmic mountains. This is
why Jerusalem and Zion were not submerged by the
Deluge. According to Islamic tradition, the highest point on earth is the Kaaba, because "the polestar proves that
... it lies over against the center of heaven/' 26
3. Finally, because of its situation at the center of the
cosmos, the temple or the sacred city is always the meeting
point of the three cosmic regions: heaven, earth, and hell. Dur-an-ki, "Bond of Heaven and Earth/' was the name given to the sanctuaries of Nippur and Larsa, and doubt
less to that of Sippara. Babylon had many names, among
them "House of the Base of Heaven and Earth/' "Bond of Heaven and Earth." But it is always Babylon that is the scene of the connection between the earth and the lower
regions, for the city had been built upon bob ap$ly the "Gate of the Apsu" 27 apsu designating the waters of chaos be
fore the Creation. We find the same tradition among the
Hebrews. The rock of Jerusalem reached deep into the subterranean waters (tehdm). The Mishnah says that the
Temple is situated exactly above the tehom (Hebrew
equivalent of apsu}. And just as in Babylon there was the "gate of the apsu," the rock of the Temple in Jerusalem
contained the "mouth of the tehQm." 28 We find similar
conceptions in the Indo-European world. Among the Romans, for example, the mundus that is, the trench dug around the place where a city was to be founded consti

world meet. "When the mundus is open it is as if the gates
of the gloomy infernal gods were open/* says Varro (cited
by Macrobius, Saturnalia, I, 16, 18). The Italic temple
was the zone where the upper (divine), terrestrial, and subterranean worlds intersected. The summit of the cosmic mountain is not only the
highest point of the earth; it is also the earth's navel, the
point at which the Creation began. There are even in
stances in which cosmological traditions explain the symbolism of the Center in terms which might well have been borrowed from embryology. "The Holy One created the world like an embryo. As the embryo proceeds from the
navel onwards, so God began to create the world from its
navel onwards and from there it was spread out in different directions/' The Toma affirms: "The world was created
beginning from Zion." 29 In the J&g-Veda ( for example
X, 149), the universe is conceived as spreading from a central point. 30 The creation of man, which answers to the
cosmogony, likewise took place at a central point, at the
center of the world. According to Mesopotamian tradition, man was formed at the "navel of the earth" in uzu (flesh),
sar (bond), M (place, earth), where Dur-an-ki, the "Bond of Heaven and Earth," is also situated. Ormazd creates
the primordial ox Evagdath, and the primordial man, GajOmard, at the center of the earth.31 Paradise, where
Adam was created from clay, is, of course, situated at the center of the cosmos. Paradise was the navel of the Earth
and, according to a Syrian tradition, was established on a mountain higher than all others. According to the Syrian
Book of the Cave of Treasures, Adam was created at the

center of the earth, at the same spot where the Cross of Christ was later to be set up. The same traditions have
been preserved by Judaism. The Jewish apocalypse and a
midrash state that Adam was formed in Jerusalem. 32 Adam
being buried at the very spot where he was created, i.e., at the center of the world, on Golgotha, the blood of the
Saviour as we have seen will redeem him too.
The symbolism of the Center is considerably more complex, but the few aspects to which we have referred will
suffice for our purpose. We may add that the same symbolism survived in the Western world down to the thresh
old of modern times. The very ancient conception of the
temple as the imago mundiy the idea that the sanctuary re
produces the universe in its essence, passed into the re
ligious architecture of Christian Europe: the basilica of
the first centuries of our era, like the medieval cathedral,
symbolically reproduces the Celestial Jerusalem. 33 As to the symbolism of the mountain, of the Ascension, and of the "Quest for the Center/' they are clearly attested in me
dieval literature, and appear, though only by allusion, in certain literary works of recent centuries. 34
Repetition of the Cosmogony
THE CENTER, then, is pre-eminently the zone of the sacred, the zone of absolute reality. Similarly, all the other sym

Fountain of Youth, etc.) are also situated at a center. The
road leading to the center is a "difficult road" (durohana),
and this is verified at every level of reality: difficult con
volutions of a temple (as at Borobudur); pilgrimage to sacred places (Mecca, Hardwar, Jerusalem); danger-ridden voyages of the heroic expeditions in search of the
Golden Fleece, the Golden Apples, the Herb of Life;
wanderings in labyrinths; difficulties of the seeker for the
road to the self, to the "center" of his being, and so on.
The road is arduous, fraught with perils, because it is, in
fact, a rite of the passage from the profane to the sacred,
from the ephemeral and illusory to reality and eternity,
from death to life, from man to the divinity. Attaining the
center is equivalent to a consecration, an initiation; yester
day's profane and illusory existence gives place to a new, to a life that is real, enduring, and effective.
If the act of the Creation realizes the passage from the
nonmanifest to the manifest or, to speak cosmologically, from chaos to cosmos; if the Creation took place from a
center; if, consequently, all the varieties of being, from the inanimate to the living, can attain existence only in an area
dominantly sacred all this beautifully illuminates for us
the symbolism of sacred cities (centers of the world), the
geomantic theories that govern the foundation of towns,
the conceptions that justify the rites accompanying their
building. We studied these construction rites, and the
theories which they imply, in an earlier work, 35 and to this
we refer the reader. Here we shall only emphasize two im
portant propositions:
1. Every creation repeats the pre-eminent cosmogonic act, the Creation of the world.
2. Consequently, whatever is founded has its foundation at the center of the world (since, as we know, the Creation itself took place from a center) .

Among the many examples at hand, we shall choose only one, which, as it is interesting in other respects too, will reappear later in our exposition. In India, before a
single stone is laid, "The astrologer shows what spot in the foundation is exactly above the head of the snake that supports the world. The mason fashions a little wooden peg from the wood of the Khadira tree, and with a coco
nut drives the peg into the ground at this particular spot,
in such a way as to peg the head of the snake securely
down. ... If this snake should ever shake its head really
violently, it would shake the world to pieces." 36 A foundation stone is placed above the peg. The cornerstone is thus situated exactly at the "center of the world." But the act of
foundation at the same time repeats the cosmogonic act,
for to "secure" the snake's head, to drive the peg into it,
is to imitate the primordial gesture of Soma (Rg-Veda, II,
1, l) or of Indra when the latter "smote the Serpent in his
lair" (VI, 17, 9), when his thunderbolt "cut off its
head" (I, 5, 10). The serpent symbolizes chaos, the formless and nonmanifested. Indra comes upon Vrtra
(IV, 19, 3) undivided (aparvari), unawakened (abudhyam), sleeping (abudhyamanam) , sunk in deepest sleep
(susupa%am), outstretched (asay&nam) . The hurling of the
lightning and the decapitation are equivalent to the act of Creation, with passage from the nonmanifested to the manifested, from the formless to the formed. Vrtra had confiscated the waters and was keeping them in the hollows of the mountains. This means either that Vrtra was the absolute master in the same manner as Tiamat or any
serpent divinity of all chaos before the Creation; or that
the great serpent, keeping the waters for himself alone, had left the whole world ravaged by drought. Whether this confiscation occurred before the act of Creation or is to

be placed after the foundation of the world, the meaning remains the same: Vrtra "hinders" 37 the world from being
made, or from enduring. Symbol of the nonmanifested, of
the latent, or of the formless, Vrtra represents the chaos which existed before the Creation. In our commentaries on the legend of Master Manole
(cf. note 35, above) we attempted to explain construction rites through imitation of the cosmogonic gesture. The
theory that these rites imply comes down to this: nothing
can endure if it is not "animated," if it is not, through a
sacrifice, endowed with a "sour*; the prototype of the construction rite is the sacrifice that took place at the time
of the foundation of the world. In fact, in certain archaic
cosmogonies, the world was given existence through the sacrifice of a primordial monster, symbolizing chaos
(Tiamat), or through that of a cosmic giant (Ymir,
Pan-Ku, Purusa). To assure the reality and the enduringness of a construction, there is a repetition of the divine act
of perfect construction: the Creation of the worlds and of
man. As the first step, the "reality" of the site is secured
through consecration of the ground, i.e., through its transformation into a center; then the validity of the act of con
struction is confirmed by repetition of the divine sacrifice.
Naturally, the consecration of the center occurs in a space
qualitatively different from profane space. Through the paradox of rite, every consecrated space coincides with the
center of the world, just as the time of any ritual coincides
with the mythical time of the "beginning." Through repetition of the cosmogonic act, concrete time, in which the
construction takes place, is projected into mythical time, in illo tempore when the foundation of the world occurred.
Thus the reality and the enduringness of a construction are

assured not only by the transformation of profane space
into a transcendent space (the center) but also by the transformation of concrete time into mythical time. Any
ritual whatever, as we shall see later, unfolds not only in a
consecrated space (i.e., one different in essence from profane space) but also in a "sacred time/' "once upon a time"
(in illo tempore, ab origine), that is, when the ritual was performed for the first time by a god, an ancestor, or a hero.
Divine Models of Rituals
EVERY RITUAL has a divine model, an archetype; this fact
is well enough known for us to confine ourselves to recall
ing a few examples. "We must do what the gods did in the
beginning" (Satapatha Brahma^a, VII, 2, 1,4). "Thus the
gods did; thus men do" (Taittirlya Brahmana, l y 5, 9, 4). This Indian adage summarizes all the theory underlying
rituals in all countries. We find the theory among so-called
primitive peoples no less than we do in developed cultures.
The aborigines of southeastern Australia, for example, practice circumcision with a stone knife because it was thus
that their ancestors taught them to do; the Amazulu
Negroes do likewise because Unkulunkulu (civilizing hero)
decreed in illo tempore: "Let men circumcise, that they may
not be boys/' 38 The hako ceremony of the Pawnee Indi
ans was revealed to the priests by Tirawa, the supreme God, at the beginning of time. Among the Sakalavas of
Madagascar, "all domestic, social, national, and religious customs and ceremonies must be observed in conformity

unwritten laws inherited from the ancestors . . /* 39 It is
useless to multiply examples; all religious acts are held to have been founded by gods, civilizing heroes, or mythical ancestors. 40 It may be mentioned in passing that, among
primitives, not only do rituals have their mythical model but any human act whatever acquires effectiveness to the
extent to which it exactly repeats an act performed at the
beginning of time by a god, a hero, or an ancestor. We
shall return at the end of this chapter to these model acts,
which men only repeat again and again. However, as we said, such a "theory" does not justify
ritual only in primitive cultures. In the Egypt of the later
centuries, for example, the power of rite and word possessed by the priests was due to imitation of the primordial
gesture of the god Thoth, who had created the world by
the force of his word. Iranian tradition knows that re
ligious festivals were instituted by Ormazd to commemorate the stages of the cosmic Creation, which con
tinued for a year. At the end of each period representing,
respectively, the creation of the sky, the waters, the earth,
plants, animals, and man Ormazd rested for five days,
thus instituting the principal Mazdean festivals (cf.
Bundahisn, I, A 18 ff.). Man only repeats the act of the Creation; his religious calendar commemorates, in the
space of a year, all the cosmogonic phases which took place
ab origins. In fact, the sacred year ceaselessly repeats the Creation; man is contemporary with the cosmogony and with the anthropogony because ritual projects him into the
mythical epoch of the beginning. A bacchant, through his orgiastic rites, imitates the drama of the suffering Diony
sos; an Orphic, through his initiation ceremonial, repeats
the original gestures of Orpheus.

The Judaeo-Christian Sabbath is also an imitatio dd*
The Sabbath rest reproduces the primordial gesture of the
Lord, for it was on the seventh day of the Creation that
God ". . . rested . . . from all his work which he had
made" (Genesis 2:2). The message of the Saviour is first
of all an example which demands imitation. After washing
his disciples' feet, Jesus said to them: "For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you"
(John 13 : 15). Humility is only a virtue; but humility practiced after the Saviour's example is a religious act and
a means of salvation: "... as I have loved you, that ye
also love one another" (John 13 : 34; 15 : 12). This Chris
tian love is consecrated by the example of Jesus. Its actual practice annuls the sin of the human condition and makes
man divine. He who believes in Jesus can do what He did;
his limitations and impotence are abolished. "He that be
lieveth on me, the works that I do shall he do also ..."
(John 14 : 12). The liturgy is precisely a commemoration
of the life and Passion of the Saviour. We shall see later
that this commemoration is in fact a reactualization of
those days. Marriage rites too have a divine model, and human mar
riage reproduces the hierogamy, more especially the union
of heaven and earth. "I am Heaven," says the husband,
"thou art Earth" (dyaur aham, pritwl tvam; Brhadaran
yaka Upanisad, VI, 4, 20). Even in Vedic times, husband and bride are assimilated to heaven and earth (Atharua
Veda, XIV, 2, 71 ), while in another hymn (Atharva-Veda,
XIV, l) each nuptial gesture is justified by a prototype in mythical times: "Wherewith Agni grasped the right hand of this earth, therefore grasp I thy hand . . . Let god
Savitar grasp thy hand . . . Tvashtar disposed the gar
ment for beauty, by direction of Brhaspati, of the poets; therewith let Savitar and Bhaga envelop this woman, like 23



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
Surya, with progeny (48, 49, 52).
" 41 In the procreation ritual transmitted by the Brhadaravyaka Upanisad, the generative act becomes a hierogamy of cosmic proportions,
mobilizing a whole group of gods: "Let Visnu make the
womb prepared! Let Tvashtri shape the various forms!
Prajapati let him pour in! Let Dhatri place the germ for
thee!" (VI, 4, l). 42 Dido celebrates her marriage with Aeneas in the midst of a violent storm (Virgil, Aeneid, VI,
1 60); their union coincides with that of the elements;
heaven embraces its bride, dispensing fertilizing rain. In Greece, marriage rites imitated the example of Zeus se
cretly uniting himself with Hera (Pausanias, II, 36, ). Diodorus Siculus tells us that the Cretan hierogamy was
imitated by the inhabitants of that island; in other words,
the ceremonial union found its justification in a primordial event which occurred in illo tempore.
What must be emphasized is the cosmogonic structure of
all these matrimonial rites: it is not merely a question of
imitating an exemplary model, the hierogamy between heaven and earth; the principal consideration is the result
of that hierogamy, i.e., the cosmic Creation. This is why,
in Polynesia, when a sterile woman wants to be fecundated,
she imitates the exemplary gesture of the Primordial
Mother, who, in illo tempore, was laid on the ground by the
great god, lo. And the cosmogonic myth is recited on the same occasion. In divorce proceedings, on the contrary, an incantation is chanted in which the "separation of
heaven and earth" is invoked. 43 The ritual recitation of the
cosmogonic myth on the occasion of marriages is current
among numerous peoples; we shall return to it later. For

the moment let us point out that the cosmic myth serves
as the exemplary model not only in the case of marriages but also in the case of any other ceremony whose end is the
restoration of integral wholeness; this is why the myth of
the Creation of the World is recited in connection with
cures, fecundity, childbirth, agricultural activities, and so
on. The cosmogony first of all represents Creation.
Demeter lay with lasion on the newly sown ground, at
the beginning of spring (Odyssey, V, 125). The meaning of this union is clear: it contributes to promoting the fertility
of the soil, the prodigious surge of the forces of telluric
creation. This practice was comparatively frequent, down to the last century, in northern and central Europe witness the various customs of symbolic union between
couples in the fields. 44 In China, young couples went out in spring and united on the grass in order to stimulate
"cosmic regeneration" and "universal germination." In
fact, every human union has its model and its justification in the hierogamy, the cosmic union of the elements.
Book IV of the Li Chi, the "Yiieh Ling" (book of monthly
regulations), specifies that his wives must present themselves to the emperor to cohabit with him in the first month
of spring, when thunder is heard. Thus the cosmic example
is followed by the sovereign and the whole people. Marital
union is a rite integrated with the cosmic rhythm and vali
dated by that integration. The entire Paleo-Oriental symbolism of marriage can
be explained through celestial models. The Sumerians cele
brated the union of the elements on the day of the New
Year; throughout the ancient East, the same day receives its luster not only from the myth of the hierogamy but also
from the rites of the king's union with the goddess. 45 It is

on New Year's day that Ishtar lies with Tammuz, and the
king reproduces this mythical hierogamy by consummating
ritual union with the goddess (i.e., with the hierodule who
represents her on earth) in a secret chamber of the temple,
where the nuptial bed of the goddess stands. The divine
union assures terrestrial fecundity; when Ninlil lies with
Enlil, rain begins to fall. 46 The same fecundity is assured by the ceremonial union of the king, that of couples on
earth, and so on. The world is regenerated each time the
hierogamy is imitated, i.e., each time matrimonial union is
accomplished. The German Hochzeit is derived from
Hochgezlt, New Year festival. Marriage regenerates the "year" and consequently confers fecundity, wealth, and
happiness. The assimilation of the sexual act to agricultural work
is frequent in numerous cultures. 47 In the Satapatha Brahmaiia (VII, 2, 2, 5) the earth is assimilated to the fe
male organ of generation (yoni) and the seed to the semen
virile. "Your women are your tilth, so come into your till
age how you choose" (Qur'dn, II, 23).48 The majority of
collective orgies find a ritual justification in fostering the forces of vegetation: they take place at certain critical
periods of the year, e.g., when the seed sprouts or the harvests ripen, and always have a hierogamy as their
mythical model. Such, for example, is the orgy practiced
by the Ewe tribe (West Africa) at the time when the barley
begins to sprout; the orgy is legitimized by a hierogamy
(young girls are offered to the python god). We find this same legitimization among the Oraons; their orgy takes place in May, at the time of the union of the sun god with
the earth goddess. All these orgiastic excesses find their

justification, in one way or another, in a cosmic or biocosmic act: regeneration of the year, critical period of the
harvest, and so forth. The boys who paraded naked through
the streets of Rome at the Floralia ( April 28) or who, at the
Lupercalia, touched women to exorcise their sterility; the
liberties permitted throughout India on the occasion of
the Holi festival; the licentiousness which was the rule in central and northern Europe at the time of the harvest
festival and against which the ecclesiastical authorities
struggled so unavailingly 49 all these manifestations also
had a superhuman prototype and tended to institute universal fertility and abundance. 50 For the purpose of this study, it is of no concern that we
should know to what extent marriage rites and the orgy
created the myths which justify them. What is important is that both the orgy and marriage constituted rituals imi
tating divine gestures or certain episodes of the sacred
drama of the cosmos the legitimization of human acts through an extrahuman model. If the myth sometimes fol
lowed the rite for example, preconjugal ceremonial unions preceded the appearance of the myth of the preconjugal relations between Hera and Zeus, the myth which served to justify them the fact in no wise lessens the
sacred character of the ritual The myth is "late" only as a formulation; but its content is archaic and refers to sacra
ments that is, to acts which presuppose an absolute re

nothing of "profane" activities: every act which has a

definite meaning hunting, fishing, agriculture; games,
conflicts, sexuality, in some way participates in the sacred. As we shall see more clearly later, the only pro
fane activities are those which have no mythical meaning,
that is, which lack exemplary models. Thus we may say
that every responsible activity in pursuit of a definite end is, for the archaic world, a ritual But since the majority
of these activities have undergone a long process of
desacralization and have, in modern societies, become pro
fane, we have thought it proper to group them separately.
Take the dance, for example. All dances were originally sacred; in other words, they had an extrahuman model.
The model may in some cases have been a totemic or em
blematic animal, whose motions were reproduced to con
jure up its concrete presence through magic, to increase its
numbers, to obtain incorporation into the animal on the part of man. In other cases the model may have been re
vealed by a divinity (for example the pyrrhic, the martial
dance created by Athena) or by a hero (cf. Theseus' dance in the Labyrinth). The dance may be executed to acquire food, to honor the dead, or to assure good order in the
cosmos. It may take place upon the occasion of initiations,
of magico-religious ceremonies, of marriages, and so on.
But all these details need not be discussed here. What is of
interest to us is its presumed extrahuman origin ( for every
dance was created in illo tempere, in the mythical period, by
an ancestor, a totemic animal, a god, or a hero) . Choreographic rhythms have their model outside of the profane
life of man; whether they reproduce the movements of the totemic or emblematic animal, or the motions of the stars; whether they themselves constitute rituals (labyrinthine
steps, leaps, gestures performed with ceremonial instruments) a dance always imitates an archetypal gesture or commemorates a mythical moment. In a word, it is a repe28

tition, and consequently a reactualization, of illud tempits,
"those days."
Struggles, conflicts, and wars for the most part have a ritual cause and function. They are a stimulating opposition
between the two halves of a clan, or a struggle between the
representatives of two divinities (for example, in Egypt,
the combat between two groups representing Osiris and
Set); but this always commemorates an episode of the
divine and cosmic drama. War or the duel can in no case be
explained through rationalistic motives. Hocart has very
rightly brought out the ritual role of hostilities. 51 Each time
the conflict is repeated, there is imitation of an archetypal
model. In Nordic tradition, the first duel took place when
Thor, provoked by the giant Hrungnir, met him at the * 'frontier" and conquered him in single combat. The motif
is found again in Indo-European mythology, and Georges
Dumezil 52 rightly regards it as a late but authentic version
of the very ancient scenario of a military initiation. The young warrior had to reproduce the combat between Thor
and Hrungnir; in fact, the military initiation consists in an
act of daring whose mythical prototype is the slaying of a three-headed monster. The frenzied berserkir, ferocious
warriors, realized precisely the state of sacred fury (wut,
menos, furor) of the primordial world. The Indian ceremony of the consecration of a king, the
rajasuya, "is only the terrestrial reproduction of the ancient
consecration which Varuna, the first Sovereign, performed
for his own benefit as the Brahmaya repeat again and
again . . . All through the ritual exegeses, we find it
tediously but instructively reiterated that if the king makes

such and such a gesture, it is because in the dawn of time,
on the day of his consecration, Varuna made it." fi3 And
this same mechanism can be shown to exist in all other tra
ditions, so far as the available documentation permits. 54
Construction rituals repeat the primordial act of the cosmogonic construction. The sacrifice performed at the build
ing of a house, church, bridge, is simply the imitation, on the human plane, of the sacrifice performed in illo tempore
to give birth to the world.
As for the magical and pharmaceutical value of certain
herbs, it too is due to a celestial prototype of the plant,
or to the fact that it was first gathered by a god. No plant
is precious in itself, but only through its participation in an
archetype, or through the repetition of certain gestures and words which, by isolating it from profane space, consecrate it. Thus two formulas of incantation, used in England
in the sixteenth century at the gathering of simples, state
the origin of their therapeutic virtue: they grew for the
first time (i.e., ab origine) on the sacred hill of Calvary, at the "center" of the Earth:
Haile be thou, holie hearbe, growing on the ground;/all in the mount Caluarie first wert thou found./Thou art good for manie a sore, and healest manie a wound;/in the name of sweet
Jesus, I take thee from the ground [[1584].
Hallowed be thou, Vervein [verbena], as thou growest on the ground,/for in the Mount of Calvary, there thou wast first found./Thou healedst our Saviour Jesus Christ, and staunchest
his bleeding wound;/in the name of [Father, Son, Holy Ghost], I take thee from the ground [1608].
The effectiveness of these herbs is attributed to the fact
that their prototypes were discovered at a decisive cosmic

moment (in illo tempore) on Mount Calvary. They received their consecration for having healed the Redeemer's
wounds. The virtue of gathered herbs is effective only in
sofar as the person gathering them repeats this primordial gesture of cure. This is why an old formula of incantation
says: "We go to gather herbs to put them on the wounds of the Lord . . ." 55
These formulas of popular Christian magic continue an
ancient tradition. In India, for example, the herb Kapit
thaka (Feronia elephantum) cures sexual impotence because, ib origine, the Gandharva used it to restore the virility of
Varuna. Hence the ritual gathering of this herb is, in
effect, a repetition of the Gandharva's act. "Thee that the Gandharva dug for Varuna whose virility was dead, thee
here do we dig, a penis-erecting herb" (Atharva-Veda
IV, 4, l). 56 A long invocation in the Papyrus magique de Paris indicates the exceptional status of the herb gathered:
"Thou wast sown by Cronos, received by Hera, preserved
by Ainmon, brought forth by Isis, nourished by rainy
Zeus; thou grewest by grace of the Sun and dew . . ." For Christians, medicinal herbs owed their effectiveness to
the fact that they were found for the first time on the mount
of Calvary. For the ancients, herbs owed their curative
virtues to the fact that they were first discovered by gods.
"Betony, thou who wast first discovered by Aesculapius, or by the centaur Chiron . . ." such is the invocation
recommended by a treatise on herbs. 57
It would be tedious, as well as purposeless, for this
essay to mention the mythical prototypes of all human ac
tivities. The fact that human justice, for example, which is

art" (Aitareya Brahmaya, VI, 27) 58 is likewise a leitmotiv
of archaic aesthetics, as Ananda K. Coomaraswamy's
studies have admirably shown. 59 It is interesting to observe that the state of beatitude itself, eudaimonia, is an
imitation of the divine condition, not to mention the
various kinds of enthousiasmos created in the soul of man by
the repetition of certain acts realized by the gods in illo
tempore (Dionysiac orgy, etc.) : "The Working of the Gods,
eminent in blessedness, will be one apt for Contemplative Speculation: and of all human Workings that will have
the greatest capacity for Happiness which is nearest akin to this" (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 11786, 21 );

We must add that, for the traditional societies, all the
important acts of life were revealed ab origine by gods or
heroes. Men only repeat these exemplary and paradigmatic gestures ad infinitum. The Yuin tribe of Australia
know that Daramulun, the "All Father," invented, for their especial benefit, all the utensils and arms that they have
employed down to today. In the same way the Kurnai tribe
know that Mungan-ngaua, the Supreme Being, lived among them, on earth, at the beginning of time, in order to
teach them to make their implements, boats, weapons, "in
fact, all the arts they know." 61 In New Guinea, many

myths tell of long sea voyages, "and thus they provide exemplars for the modern voyagers/' as well as for all
other activities, "whether of love, or war, or rain-making,
or fishing, or whatever else . . . [[Myth]] gives precedents for the stages of construction, the tabu on sexual
intercourse, etc." When a captain goes to sea, he personi
fies the mythical hero Aori. "He wears the costume which
Aori is supposed to have worn, with a blackened face (and
in a way prematurely) the same kind of love in his hair
which Aori plucked from Iviri's head. He dances on the
platform and extends his arms like Aori's wings ... A
man told me that when he went fish shooting (with bow
and arrow) he pretended to be Kivavia himself." 62 He did
not implore Kivavia's favor and help; he identified himself with the mythical hero.
This same symbolism of mythical precedents is to be found in other primitive cultures. In regard to the Karuk
Indians of California, J. P. Harrington writes: "Everything that the Karuk did was enacted because the Ikxare
yavs were believed to have set the example in story times.
The Ikxareyavs were the people who were in America before the Indians came. Modern Karuks, in a quandary now to render the word, volunteer such translations as 'the

Marcel Mauss has devoted a well-known study,64 is only
the repetition of a practice introduced by the ancestors in
mythical times. It would be easy to multiply examples. 65
Myths and History
EACH of the examples cited in the present chapter reveals
the same "primitive" ontological conception; an object or an act becomes real only insofar as it imitates or repeats an
archetype. Thus, reality is acquired solely through repeti
tion or participation; everything which lacks an exemplary model is
*
'meaningless/' i.e., it lacks reality. Men would
thus have a tendency to become archetypal and paradig
matic. This tendency may well appear paradoxical, in the
sense that the man of a traditional culture sees himself as
real only to the extent that he ceases to be himself (for a
modern observer) and is satisfied with imitating and repeating the gestures of another. In other words, he sees
himself as real, i.e., as "truly himself," only, and precisely, insofar as he ceases to be so. Hence it could be said that this
"primitive" ontology has a Platonic structure; and in that
case Plato could be regarded as the outstanding philoso
pher of "primitive mentality," that is, as the thinker who
succeeded in giving philosophic currency and validity to the modes of life and behavior of archaic humanity. Ob
viously, this in no way lessens the originality of his philosophic genius; for his great title to our admiration remains
his effort to justify this vision of archaic humanity the

oretically, through the dialectic means which the spirituality of his age made available to him.
But our interest here is not in this aspect of Platonic
philosophy; it is in archaic ontology. Recognizing the Platonic structure of that ontology would not take us very far.
No less important is the second conclusion to be drawn
from analyzing the facts cited in the foregoing pages that
is, the abolition of time through the imitation of archetypes
and the repetition of paradigmatic gestures. A sacrifice, for example, not only exactly reproduces the initial sacrifice revealed by a god ab origine, at the beginning of time, it also takes place at that same primordial mythical moment;
in other words, every sacrifice repeats the initial sacrifice
and coincides with it. All sacrifices are performed at the
same mythical instant of the beginning; through the paradox of rite, profane time and duration are suspended. And the same holds true for all repetitions, i.e., all imitations of
archetypes; through such imitation, man is projected into the mythical epoch in which the archetypes were first re
vealed. Thus we perceive a second aspect of primitive
ontology: insofar as an act (or an object) acquires a certain reality through the repetition of certain paradigmatic gestures, and acquires it through that alone, there is an im
plicit abolition of profane time, of duration, of "history";
and he who reproduces the exemplary gesture thus finds himself transported into the mythical epoch in which its revelation took place.
The abolition of profane time and the individual's pro
jection into mythical time do not occur, of course, except at essential periods those, that is, when the individual is
truly himself: on the occasion of rituals or of important acts
(alimentation, generation, ceremonies, hunting, fishing, war, work). The rest of his life is passed in profane time, which is without meaning: in the state of "becoming/* 35



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
Brahmanic texts clearly bring out the heterogeneity of these two times, the sacred and the profane, of the modality
of the gods, which is coupled with immortality, and the modality of man, which is coupled with death. Insofar as
he repeats the archetypal sacrifice, the sacrificer, in full ceremonial action, abandons the profane world of mortals
and introduces himself into the divine world of the im
mortals. He himself, indeed, declares this, in the following
terms: "I have attained Heaven, the gods; I am become
immortal!" (Taittirtya Sawhita, I, 7, 9). Should he now descend once more to the profane world, which he has left during the rite, he would die instantly; hence various rites
of desacralization are indispensable to restore the sacrificer to profane time. The same is true in the case of cere
monial sexual union; the individual ceases to live in pro
fane and meaningless time, since he is imitating a divine
archetype ("I am Heaven, thou art Earth/' etc.). The Melaneskn fisherman, when he goes to sea, becomes the hero Aori and is projected into mythical time, into the mo
ment when the paradigmatic voyage took place. Just as profane space is abolished by the symbolism of the Center,
which projects any temple, palace, or building into the same central point of mythical space, so any meaningful act
performed by archaic man, any real act, i.e., any repetition
of an archetypal gesture, suspends duration, abolishes profane time, and participates in mythical time. This suspension of profane time answers to a profound need on the part of primitive m<an, as we shall have occasion to observe in the next chapter when we examine a
series of parallel conceptions relating to the regeneration
of time and the symbolism of the New Year. We shall then
understand the significance of this need, and we shall see
that the man of archaic cultures tolerates "history" with
difficulty and attempts periodically to abolish it. The facts 36



ARCHETYPES AND REPETITION
that we have examined in the present chapter will then ac
quire other meanings. But before entering upon the prob
lem of the regeneration of time, we must look from another point of view at the mechanism of the transformation of
man into archetype through repetition. We shall examine a definite case: to what extent does collective memory pre
serve the recollection of a historic event? We have seen
that the warrior, whoever he may be, imitates a hero and
seeks to approach this archetypal model as closely as pos
sible. Let us now see what the memory of the people re
tains concerning a well-documented historical personage.
By attacking the problem from this angle, we advance a
step because in this instance we are dealing with a society
which, though "popular," cannot be called primitive.
Thus, to give only one example, a familiar paradigmatic myth recounts the combat between the hero and a gigantic
serpent, often three-headed, sometimes replaced by a
marine monster (Indra, Herakles, and others; Marduk). Where tradition is still more or less a living thing, great monarchs consider themselves imitators of the primor
dial hero: Darius saw himself "as a new Thraetaona, the
mythical Iranian hero who was said to have slain a three
headed monster; for him and through him history was
regenerated, for it was in fact the revivification, the re
actualization, of a primordial heroic myth. The Pharaoh's adversaries were considered "sons of ruin, wolves, dogs/'
and so forth. In the Book of Afophis the enemies whom the
Pharaoh fights are identified with the dragon Apophis, while the Pharaoh himself is assimilated with the god Re,
conqueror of the dragon. 6* The same transfiguration of history into myth, but from another point of view, is found in the visions of the Hebrew poets. In order to "tolerate

history/' that is, to endure their military defeats and poli
tical humiliations, the Hebrews interpreted contemporary
events by means of the very ancient cosmogonico-heroic myth, which, though it of course admitted the provisional
victory of the dragon, above all implied the dragon's final extinction through a King-Messiah. Thus their imagination gives the Gentile kings ( Zadokite Fragments, IX : 19
20) the characteristics of the dragon: such is the Pompey
described in the Psalms of Solomon (IX : 29), the Nebu
chadrezzar presented by Jeremiah (51 : 34). And in the Testament of Asher (VII : 3} the Messiah kills the dragon under water (cf. Psalm 74 : 13). In the case of Darius and the Pharaoh, as in that of the Hebrew Messianic tradition, we are dealing with the con
ception of an "elite" who interpret contemporary history
by means of a myth. A series of contemporary events is
given an articulation and an interpretation that conform with the atemporal model of the heroic myth. For a hyper
critical modern, Darius' pretention might signify boasting or political propaganda; the mythical transformation of the
Gentile kings into dragons might represent a labored invention on the part of a Hebraic minority unable to toler
ate "historical reality" and seeking to console themselves
at any cost by taking refuge in myth and wishful thinking. That such an interpretation is erroneous, because it makes no allowance for the structure of archaic mentality, is
shown, for one thing, by the fact that popular memory
applies a strictly analogous process of articulation and interpretation to historical events and personages. If the transformation into myth of the biography of Alexander the
Great may be suspected of having a literary origin, and consequently be accused of artificiality, the objection has no force in regard to the documents to which we shall now
refer.

Dieudonne de Gozon, third Grand Master of the Knights of St. John at Rhodes, has remained famous for
having slain the dragon of Malpasso. Legend, as was natural, bestowed on him the attributes of St. George, famed
for his victorious fight with the monster. Needless to say, the documents of de Gozon's period make no reference to any such combat, and it does not begin to be mentioned until some two centuries after the hero's birth. In other
words, by the simple fact that he was regarded as a hero,
de Gozon was identified with a category, an archetype,
which, entirely disregarding his real exploits, equipped
him with a mythical biography from which it was impossible to omit combat with a reptilian monster. 67
Petru Caraman, in a copiously documented study of the
genesis of the historical ballad, shows that, of a definitely established historical event the expedition against Poland
by Malko Pasha in 1499, in an especially severe winter, which is mentioned in Leunclavius' chronicle as well as in
other Polish sources, and during the course of which a whole Turkish army perished in Moldavia the Romanian
ballad that narrates the catastrophic Turkish expedition
preserves almost nothing, the historical event having been
completely translated into a mythical action (Malkos Pasha fighting King Winter, etc.). 68
This "mythicization" of historical personages appears in exactly the same way in Yugoslavian heroic poetry.
Marko KraljeviC, protagonist of the Yugoslavian epic, became famous for his courage during the second half of the
fourteenth century. His historical existence is unquestionable, and we even know the date of his death (1394). But

the popular memory than it is abolished and his biography
is reconstructed in accordance with the norms of myth. His mother is a Vila, a fairy, just as the Greek heroes were
the sons of nymphs or naiads. His wife is also a Vila; he wins her through a ruse and takes great care to hide
her wings lest she find them, take flight, and abandon
him as, by the way, in certain variants of the ballad,
proves to be the case after the birth of their first child. 69
Marko fights a three-headed dragon and kills it, after the
archetypal model of Indra, Thraetaona, Herakles, and others. 70 In accordance with the myth of the enemy broth
ers, he too fights with his brother Andrija and kills him.
Anachronisms abound in the cycle of Marko, as in all
other archaic epic cycles. Marko, who died in 1394, is now
the friend, now the enemy of John Hunyadi, who distinguished himself in the wars against the Turks ca. 1450.
It is interesting to note that these two heroes are brought
together in the manuscripts of epic ballads of the seven
69 Cf. the myth of the Maori hero Tawhaki, whom his wife, a fairy come down
to earth from heaven, abandons after giving him a child.
70 This is not the place to enter upon the problem of the combat between mon
ster and hero (cf. Bernhard Schweitzer, Herakles, Tubingen, 1922; A. Lods, Comptes
rendus de I'Academic des Inscriptions, Paris, 1943, pp. 283 fi\). It is highly probable,
as Georges Dumzil suggests (Horace et Us Curiaces, Paris, 1942, especially pp. 126 ff.), that the hero's combat with a three-headed monster is the transformation into myth of an archaic initiation ritual. That this initiation does not always belong
to the "heroic" type, appears, among other things, from the British Columbian
parallels mentioned by Dumezil (pp. 129-30), where shamanic initiation is also involved. If, in Christian mythology, St. George fights and kills the dragon
"heroically," other saints achieve the same result without fighting (cf. the French
legends of St. Samson, St. Marguerite, St. Bie", etc.; Paul Se"billot, Le Folk-lore de
France, I (Paris, 1904), p, 468; III (Paris, 1906), 298, 299. On the other hand, we
must not forget that, apart from its possible role in the rites and myths of heroic initiation, the dragon, in many other traditions (East Asiatic, Indian, African, and others) is given a cosmological symbolism: it symbolizes the involution, the pre
formal modality, of the universe, the undivided "One" of pre-Creation (cf.
Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, The Darker Side of Dawn> Washington, 1935; "Sir
Gawain and the Green Knight: Indra and Namuci," Speculum (Cambridge, Mass.),
Jan., 1944, pp. 1-23). This is why snakes and dragons are nearly everywhere
identified with the "masters of the ground," with the autochthons against whom
the newcomers, the "conquerors," those who are to form (i.e., create) the occupied
territories, must fight. (On the assimilation of snakes and autochthons, cf. Charles
Autran, L'Epopte indoue, Paris, 1946, pp. 66 ff.).

teenth century; that is, two centuries after Hunyadi's death.
In modern epic poems, anachronisms are far less frequent. 71
The personages celebrated in them have not yet had time to be transformed into mythical heroes.
The same mythical prestige glorifies other heroes of Yugoslavian epic poetry. Vukasin and Novak marry Vila.
Vuk (the "Dragon Despot") fights the dragon of Jastrebac
and can himself turn into a dragon. Vuk, who reigned in
Syrmia between 1471 and 1485, comes to the rescue of
Lazar and Milica, who died about a century earlier. In the
poems whose action centers upon the first battle of Kos
sovo (1389), persons figure who had been dead for twenty
years (e.g., VukaSin) or who were not to die until a cen
tury later (Erceg Stjepan). Fairies (Vila) cure wounded heroes, resuscitate them, foretell the future to them, warn
them of imminent dangers, just as in myth a female being
aids and protects the hero. No heroic "ordeal" is omitted:
shooting an arrow through an apple, jumping over several horses, recognizing a girl among a group of youths dressed alike, and so on. 72
Certain heroes of the Russian byliny are most probably
connected with historical prototypes. A number of the heroes of the Kiev cycle are mentioned in the chronicles.
But with this their historicity ends. We cannot even determine whether the Prince Vladimir who forms the center of the Kiev cycle is Vladimir I, who died in 1015, or Vladi
mir II, who reigned from 1113 to 11 5. As for the great
heroes of the byliny of this cycle, Svyatogor, Mikula, and Volga, the historic elements preserved in their persons and adventures amount to almost nothing. They end by
becoming indistinguishable from the heroes of myths and

folk tales. One of the protagonists of the Kiev cycle,
Dobrynya Nikitich, who sometimes appears in the byliny as Vladimir's nephew, owes his principal fame to a purely
mythical exploit: he kills a twelve-headed dragon. Another
hero of the byliny , St. Michael of Potuka, kills a dragon
that is on the point of devouring a girl brought to it as an
offering.
To a certain extent, we witness the metamorphosis of
a historical figure into a mythical hero. We are not re
ferring merely to the supernatural elements summoned to reinforce their legends: for example the hero Volga, of the
Kiev cycle, changes into a bird or a wolf, exactly like a shaman or a figure of ancient legend; Egori is born with
silver feet, golden arms, and his head covered with pearls;
Ilya of Murom resembles a giant of folklore he boasts that he can make heaven and earth touch. But there is
something else: this mythicization of the historical prototypes who gave the popular epic songs their heroes takes place in accordance with an exemplary standard; they are "formed after the image" of the heroes of ancient myth. They all resemble one another in the fact of their miraculous birth; and, just as in the Mahabharata and the Homeric
poems, at least one of their parents is divine. As in the
epic songs of the Tatars and the Polynesians, these heroes undertake a journey to heaven or descend into hell.
To repeat, the historical character of the persons cele
brated in epic poetry is not in question. But their historicity does not long resist the corrosive action of mythicization.
The historical event in itself, however important, does not
remain in the popular memory, nor does its recollection
kindle the poetic imagination save insofar as the particular
historical event closely approaches a mythical model In

the army has been forgotten, as have the name and the importance of Borodino; all that survives is the figure of
Kutusov in the guise of a popular hero. In 1919., an entire
Serbian brigade saw Marko Kraljevie lead the charge
against the castle of Prilep, which, centuries earlier, had been that popular hero's fief: a particularly heroic exploit
provided sufficient occasion for the popular imagination to seize upon it and assimilate it to the traditional archetype
of Marko's exploits, the more so because his own castle was at stake.
"Myth is the last not the first stage in the develop
ment of a hero." 73 But this only confirms the conclusion
reached by many investigators (Caraman and others): the
recollection of a historical event or a real personage sur
vives in popular memory for two or three centuries at the
utmost. This is because popular memory finds difficulty in
retaining individual events and real figures. The structures
by means of which it functions are different: categories in
stead of events, archetypes instead of historical personages.
The historical personage is assimilated to his mythical
model (hero, etc.), while the event is identified with the
category of mythical actions (fight with a monster, enemy brothers, etc.). If certain epic poems preserve what is called "historical truth," this truth almost never has to do with
definite persons and events, but with institutions, customs,
landscapes. Thus, for example, as Murko observes, the Serbian epic poems quite accurately describe life on the Austrian-Turkish and Turkish-Venetian frontier before
the Peace of Karlowitz in 1699. 74 But such "historical
truths" are not concerned with personalities or events, but

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
with traditional forms of social and political life (the "be
coming'* of which is slower than the "becoming" of the
individual) in a word, with archetypes. The memory of the collectivity is anhistorical. This
statement implies neither a popular origin for folklore nor
a collective creation for epic poetry. Murko, Chadwick, and other investigators have brought out the role of the
creative personality, of the "artist," in the invention and
development of epic poetry. We wish to say no more than that quite apart from the origin of folklore themes and
from the greater or lesser degree of talent in the creators
of epic poetry the memory of historical events is modi
fied, after two or three centuries, in such a way that it can
enter into the mold of the archaic mentality, which cannot
accept what is individual and preserves only what is ex
emplary. This reduction of events to categories and of in
dividuals to archetypes, carried out by the consciousness of
the popular strata in Europe almost down to our day, is
performed in conformity with archaic ontology. We might say that popular memory restores to the historical per
sonage of modern times its meaning as imitator of the
archetype and reproducer of archetypal gestures a meaning of which the members of archaic societies have always
been, and continue to be, conscious (as the examples cited
in this chapter show), but which has been forgotten by such personages as Dieudonne de Gozon or Marko
KraljeviC.
Sometimes, though very rarely, an investigator chances to come upon the actual transformation of an event into
myth. Just before the last war, the Romanian folklorist Constantin Brailoiu had occasion to record an admirable
'ballad in a village in Maramures. Its subject was a tragedy of love: the young suitor had been bewitched by a mountain fairy, and a few days before he was to be married, the 44



ARCHETYPES AND REPETITION
fairy, driven by jealousy, had flung him from a cliff. The
next day, shepherds found his body and, caught in a tree, his hat. They carried the body back to the village and his
fiancee came to meet them; upon seeing her lover dead,
she poured out a funeral lament, full of mythological allusions, a liturgical text of rustic beauty. Such was the content of the ballad. In the course of recording the variants
that he was able to collect, the folklorist tried to learn the
period when the tragedy had occurred; he was told that it
was a very old story, which had happened "long ago." Pursuing his inquiries, however, he learned that the event
had taken place not quite forty years earlier. He finally
even discovered that the heroine was still alive. He went
to see her and heard the story from her own lips. It was a
quite commonplace tragedy: one evening her lover had
slipped and fallen over a cliff; he had not died instantly; his cries had been heard by mountaineers; he had been carried
to the village, where he had died soon after. At the funeral, his fiancee, with the other women of the village, had re
peated the customary ritual lamentations, without the slightest allusion to the mountain fairy.
Thus, despite the presence of the principal witness, a few years had sufficed to strip the event of all historical
authenticity, to transform it into a legendary tale: the
jealous fairy, the murder of the young man, the discovery of the dead body, the lament, rich in mythological themes, chanted by the fiancee. Almost all the people of the village
had been contemporaries of the authentic historical fact;
but this fact, as such, could not satisfy them: the tragic
death of a young man on the eve of his marriage was
something different from a simple death by accident; it
had an occult meaning that could only be revealed by its
identification with the category of myth. The mythiciza
tion of the accident had not stopped at the creation of a 45



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
ballad; people told the story of the jealous fairy even when
they were talking freely, "prosaically/' of the young man's
death. When the folklorist drew the villagers' attention to
the authentic version, they replied that the old woman had
forgotten; that her great grief had almost destroyed her mind. It was the myth that told the truth: the real story
was already only a falsification. Besides, was not the myth
truer by the fact that it made the real story yield a deeper
and richer meaning, revealing a tragic destiny?
THE ANHISTORICAL CHARACTER of popular memory, the in
ability of collective memory to retain historical events and
individuals except insofar as it transforms them into arche
types that is, insofar as it annuls all their historical and
personal peculiarities pose a series of new problems,
which we are obliged to set aside for the moment. But at
this point we have the right to ask ourselves if the im
portance of archetypes for the consciousness of archaic
man, and the inability of popular memory to retain anything but archetypes, do not reveal to us something more than the resistance to history exhibited by traditional
spirituality; if this mnemonic lacuna does not reveal the
transitoriness, or at least the secondary character, of hu
man individuality as such that individuality whose creative spontaneity, in the last analysis, constitutes the au
thenticity and irreversibility of history. In any case, it is remarkable that, on the one hand, popular memory refuses
to preserve the personal, historical elements of a hero's
biography while, on the other hand, higher mystical experiences imply a final elevation of the personal God to the transpersonal God. It would also be instructive to
compare, from this point of view, the conceptions of life after death that have been elaborated by various traditions.
The transformation of the dead person into an "ancestor" 46



ARCHETYPES AND REPETITION
corresponds to the fusion of the individual into an arche
typal category. In numerous traditions (in Greece, for example) the souls of the common dead no longer possess a
"memory"; that is, they lose what may be called their
historical individuality. The transformation of the dead
into ghosts, and so on, in a certain sense signifies their
reidentification with the impersonal archetype of the an
cestor. The fact that in the Greek tradition only heroes
preserve their personality (i.e., their memory) after death, is easy to understand: having, in his life on earth, per
formed no actions which were not exemplary, the hero
retains the memory of them, since, from a certain point of view, these acts were impersonal.
Leaving aside the conceptions of the transformation of
the dead into "ancestors," and regarding the fact of death
as a concluding of the "history" of the individual, it still seems very natural that the post-mortem memory of that
history should be limited or, in other words, that the
memory of passions, of events, of all that is connected with the individual strictly speaking, comes to an end at a
certain moment of his existence after death. As for the
objection that an impersonal survival is equivalent to a real death (inasmuch as only the personality and the memory that are connected with duration and history can
be called a survival), it is valid only from the point of view
of a "historical consciousness," in other words, from the point of view of modern man, for archaic consciousness
accords no importance to personal memories. It is not easy to define what such a "survival of impersonal con
sciousness" might mean, although certain spiritual ex
periences afford a glimpse. What is personal and historical in the emotion we feel when we listen to the music of
Bach, in the attention necessary for the solution of a mathe
matical problem, in the concentrated lucidity presupposed 47



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
by the examination of any philosophical question? Insofar
as he allows himself to be influenced by history, modern
man feels himself diminished by the possibility of this impersonal survival. But interest in the "irreversible" and
the "new" in history is a recent discovery in the life of
humanity. On the contrary, archaic humanity, as we shall
presently see, defended itself, to the utmost of its powers,
against all the novelty and irreversibility which history en
tails.

CHAPTER TWO
THE REGENERATION OF TIME
Tear, New Tear, Cosmogony Periodicity of the
Creation Continuous Regeneration of Time






Year, New Year, Cosmogony
THE rites and beliefs here grouped under "Regeneration
of Time" afford an endless variety, and we are under
little illusion as to the possibility of fitting them into a
coherent and unified system. In any case, the present essay requires neither an exposition of all the forms this regen
eration assumes nor a morphological and historical analysis
of them. Our aim is not to learn how the calendar came to
be constituted, nor to discover how far it might be possible
to work out a system that would comprehend the concep
tions of the "year" held by various peoples. In most
primitive societies, the New Year is equivalent to the
raising of the taboo on the new harvest, which is thus declared edible and innoxious for the whole community.
Where several species of grains or fruits are cultivated,
ripening successively at different seasons, we sometimes
find several New Year festivals. 1 This means the divisions
of time are determined by the rituals that govern the re
newal of alimentary reserves; that is, the rituals that
guarantee the continuity of the life of the community in its entirety. (This does not justify any conclusion that these
rituals are simple reflexes of economic and social life: in
traditional societies, the "economic" and the "social" bear
an entirely different meaning from that which a modern
European tends to give them.) The adoption of the solar year as the unit of time is of Egyptian origin. The majority of other historical cultures and Egypt itself down
to a certain period had a year, at once lunar and solar, of
560 days (that is, 12 months of SO days each), to which
five intercalary days were added. 2 The Zufii Indians called

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
the months the "steps of the year" and the year the "passage of time." The beginning of the year varied from
country to country as well as in different periods, calendar
reforms being constantly introduced to make the ritual
meaning of festivals fit the seasons with which it was sup
posed to correspond. However, neither the instability and latitude in the be
ginning of the New Year ( March-April, July 1 9 as in ancient Egypt September, October, December-January, etc.) nor the different lengths attributed to the year by dif
ferent peoples were able to lessen the importance attached, in all countries, to the end of a period of time and the be
ginning of a new period. Hence, as will easily be understood, it is a matter of indifference to us that, for example,
the African Yoruba divide the year into dry season and rainy season and that among them the week numbers five
days as against eight days for the Bakoto; or that the Barundi distribute the months by lunations and thus ar
rive at a year of about thirteen months; or, again, that the
Ashanti divide each month into two periods of ten days ( or
of nine days and a half). For us, the essential thing is that
there is everywhere a conception of the end and the be
ginning of a temporal period, based on the observation of
biocosmic rhythms and forming part of a larger system
the system of periodic purifications (cf. purges, fasting,
confession of sins, etc.) and of the periodic regeneration of
life. This need for a periodic regeneration seems to us of
considerable significance in itself. Yet the examples that
we shall presently adduce will show us something even
more important, namely, that a periodic regeneration of time presupposes, in more or less explicit form and es
pecially in the historical civilizations a new Creation, that
is, a repetition of the cosmogonic act. And this conception
of a periodic creation, i.e., of the cyclical regeneration of



THE REGENERATION OF TIME
time, poses the problem of the abolition of "history/* the
problem which is our prime concern in this essay.
Readers familiar with ethnography and the history of
religions are well aware of the importance of a whole series
of periodic ceremonies, which, for convenience, we can group under two main headings: (l) annual expulsion of demons, diseases, and sins; (2) rituals of the days preced
ing and following the New Year. In the part of The Golden
Bough entitled The Scapegoat, Sir James George Frazer has, in his fashion, brought together a sufficient number of facts in the two categories. There can be no question of
repeating this documentation in the following pages. In
broad outline, the ceremony of expelling demons, diseases, and sins can be reduced to the following elements: fasting,
ablutions, and purifications; extinguishing the fire and ritually rekindling it in a second part of the ceremonial;
expulsion of demons by means of noises, cries, blows (in
doors) , followed by their pursuit through the village with
uproar and hullabaloo; this expulsion can be practiced under the form of the ritual sending away of an animal
(type "scapegoat") or of a man (type Mamurius Veturius), regarded as the material vehicle through which the
faults of the entire community are transported beyond the limits of the territory it inhabits (the scapegoat was driven
"into the desert" by the Hebrews and the Babylonians). There are often ceremonial combats between two groups
of actors, or collective orgies, or processions of masked
men (representing the souls of the ancestors, the gods, and so forth) . In many places the belief still survives that, at
the time of these manifestations, the souls of the dead ap
proach the houses of the living, who respectfully go out to meet them and lavish honors upon them for several days,
after which they are led to the boundary of the village in
procession or are driven from it. It is at the same period
53



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
that the ceremonies of the initiation of young men are
performed (we have definite proofs of this among the Japanese, the Hopi Indians, certain Indo-European peoples,
and others; see below, pp. 66 ff.). Almost everywhere the expulsion of demons, diseases, and sins coincides or at
one period coincided with the festival of the New Year.
Naturally, we seldom find all these elements together in explicit conjunction; in certain societies the ceremonies
of extinguishing and rekindling the fire predominate; in
others, it is the material expulsion (by noise and violent
gestures) of demons and diseases; in yet others, the expul
sion of the scapegoat in human or animal form. But the meaning of the whole ceremony, like that of each of its
constituent elements, is sufficiently clear: on the occasion
of the division of time into independent units, "years/' we witness not only the effectual cessation of a certain tem
poral interval and the beginning of another, but also the
abolition of the past year and of past time. And this is the
meaning of ritual purifications: a combustion, an annulling of the sins and faults of the individual and of those of the
community as a whole not a mere "purifying." Regen
eration, as its name indicates, is a new birth. The examples
cited in the preceding chapter, and especially those which we are now to review, clearly show that this annual ex
pulsion of sins, diseases, and demons is basically an attempt
to restore if only momentarily mythical and primordial time, "pure" time, the time of the "instant" of the Cre
ation. Every New Year is a resumption of time from the
beginning, that is, a repetition of the cosmogony. The ritual combats between two groups of actors, the presence
of the dead, the Saturnalia, and the orgies are so many ele
ments which for reasons we shall soon set forth denote
that at the end of the year and in the expectation of the
New Year there is a repetition of the mythical moment of the passage from chaos to cosmos.



THE REGENERATION OF TIME
The ceremonial for the Babylonian New Year, the akitu, is sufficiently conclusive in this respect. Akitu could be celebrated at the spring equinox, in the month of Nian, as well as at the autumnal equinox, in the month of TiSrit
(derived from surri, "to begin"). The antiquity of this ceremonial admits of no doubt, even if the dates at which
it was celebrated were variable. Its ideology and its ritual structure existed as early as the Sumerian period, and the system of the akitu has been identified from Akkadian
times. 3 These chronological details are not without impor
tance; we are dealing with documents of the earliest "his
torical" civilization, in which the sovereign played a considerable role, since he was regarded as the son and vicar
of the divinity on earth; as such, he was responsible for the regularity of the rhythms of nature and for the good estate
of the entire society. Hence it is not surprising to find him
playing an important role in the ceremonial of the New
Year; upon him fell the duty of regenerating time. During the course of the akitu ceremony, which lasted
twelve days, the so-called epic of the Creation, Enfima
elis, was solemnly recited several times in the temple of Marduk. Thus the combat between Marduk and the sea monster Tiamat was reactualized the combat that had
taken place in illo tempore and had put an end to chaos by the final victory of the god. 4 Marduk creates the cosmos
from the fragments of Tiamat's torn body and creates man
from the blood of the demon Kingu, to whom Tiamat had
entrusted the Tablets of Destiny (Enfima eliS, VI, 33) .

p. 130; Giuseppe Furlani, La Rdigione degli Hittiti (Bologna, 1936), p. 89.
6 The motif of creation by means of the body of a primordial being occurs in
other cultures: in China, India, and Iran, and among the Germanic tribes.
55



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
reactualization of the cosmogonic act is proved both by the rituals and by the formulas recited during the course of the ceremony. The combat between Tiamat and Marduk
was mimed by a struggle between two groups of actors, a ceremonial that is also found among the Hittites (again
in the frame of the dramatic scenario of the New Year) ,
among the Egyptians, and at Ras Shamra. 6 The struggle between two groups of actors not only commemorated the
primordial conflict between Marduk and Tiamat; it re
peated, it actualized, the cosmogony, the passage from chaos to cosmos. The mythical event was present: "May he continue to conquer Tiamat and shorten her days!" the
celebrant exclaimed. The combat, the victory, and the
Creation took place at that very moment. It is also within the frame of the same akitu ceremonial
that the festival called the "festival of the fates/' Zakmuk,
was celebrated, in which the omens for each of the twelve
months of the year were determined, which was equivalent to creating the twelve months to come (a ritual that has
been preserved, more or less explicitly, in other traditions;
see below, pp. 65 ff.). To Marduk's descent into hell (the
god was a "prisoner in the mountain/' i.e., in the infernal
regions) there corresponded a period of mourning and fasting for the whole community and of "humiliation" for
the king, a ritual that formed part of a great carnival system into which we cannot enter here. It was at the same
period that the expulsion of evils and sins took place by
means of a scapegoat. The cycle was closed by the god's

Near East (Uppsala, 1943), pp. 11, 101. There are also traces of a ritual combat
at Jerusalem; see below, p. 60. A similar combat took place in the Hippodrome
of Constantinople down to the last centuries of the Byzantine Empire; Joannes Malalas speaks of it in his Chronographia (Bonn, 1831, pp. 173-76) and Benjamin
of Tudela also mentions it; see Raphael Patai, Man and Temple (London, 1947),
pp. 77 ff.

THE REGENERATION OF TIME
hierogamy with Sarpanitu, a hierogamy that was repro
duced by the king and a hierodule in the chamber of the
goddess and to which there certainly corresponded a period
of collective orgy. 7
As we see, the akitu festival comprises a series of dramatic elements the intention of which is the abolition of
past time, the restoration of primordial chaos, and the
repetition of the cosmogonic act: 1 . The first act of the ceremony represents the domination of Tiamat and thus marks a regression into the
mythical period before the Creation; all forms are supposed to be confounded in the marine abyss of the beginning, the
apsu. Enthronement of a "carnival" king, "humiliation"
of the real sovereign, overturning of the entire social order
(according to Berossus, the slaves became the masters,
and so on) every feature suggests universal confusion,
the abolition of order and hierarchy, "orgy," chaos. We
witness, one might say, a "deluge" that annihilates all humanity in order to prepare the way for a new and
regenerated human species. In addition, does not the Babylonian tradition of the Deluge, as preserved in Tablet XI
of the Epic of Gilgamesh, tell us that Ut-napistim, before embarking in the ship which he had built in order to escape
the Deluge, had organized a festival "as on the day of the

New Year (akitu}"? We shall find this deluge element sometimes a mere water element in certain other tradi
tions. 2. The creation of the world, which took place, in illo
tempore, at the beginning of the year, is thus reactualized
each year.
3. Man participates directly, though to a reduced ex
tent, in this cosmogonic work (struggle between the two
groups of actors representing Marduk and Tiamat; "mys
teries 1 * celebrated on certain occasions, according to the interpretation of Zimmern and Reitzenstein 8
) ; this par
ticipation, as we saw in the preceding chapter, projects
him into mythical time, making him contemporary with
the cosmogony. 4. The "festival of the fates" is also a formula of cre
ation, in which the "fate*' of each month and each day is
decided. 5. The hierogamy is a concrete realization of the "re
birth" of the world and man.
The meaning and the ritual of the Babylonian New Year
have their counterparts throughout the Paleo-Oriental
world. We have noted a few of these in passing, but the list is far from being exhausted. In a remarkable study,
which has not aroused the interest it deserves, the Dutch scholar A. J. Wensinck has demonstrated the symmetry
between various mythico-ceremonial systems of the New Year throughout the Semitic world; in each of these systems we find the same central idea of the yearly return to
chaos, followed by a new creation. 9 Wensinck has rightly
discerned the cosmic character of the New Year rituals
(with all due reservations in regard to his theory of the

THE REGENERATION OF TIME
"origin" of this ritualo-cosmic conception, which he tries
to find in the periodic spectacle of the disappearance and
reappearance of vegetation; the fact is that, for "primitives," nature is a hierophany, and the "laws of nature" are the revelation of the mode of existence of the divinity).
That the deluge and, in general, the element of water are
present, in one way or another, in the ritual of the New
Year is sufficiently proved by the libations practiced on this occasion and by the relations between this ritual and
the rains. "In Tisrit was the world created," says Rabbi
Eliezer; "in Nisan," affirms Rabbi Josua. Now, both these are rainy months. 10 It is at the time of the Feast of Taber
nacles that the quantity of rain allotted for the coming
year is settled, i.e., that the "fate" of the months to come is determined. 11 Christ blesses the waters on Epiphany,
while Easter and New Year's Day were the habitual dates
for baptism in primitive Christianity. (Baptism is equiva
lent to the ritual death of the old man followed by a new
birth. On the cosmic level, it is equivalent to the deluge:
abolition of contours, fusion of all forms, return to the
formless.) Ephraem Syrus rightly discerned the mystery of this yearly repetition of the Creation and attempted to
explain it: "He has created the heavens anew, because
sinners have worshipped all the heavenly bodies; has created the world anew, which had been withered by Adam, a
new creation arose from His spittle." 12
Certain traces of the ancient scenario of the combat and
the victory of the divinity over the marine monster, incarnation of chaos, can also be discerned in the Jewish
ceremonial of the New Year, as it has been preserved in
10 Ibid., p. 168, See further texts in Patai, pp. 68 ff.
11 Rosh Hashshana, I, 2; Wensinck, p. 163; Patai, pp. 24 ff. Rabbi Ishmael and
Rabbi Akiba agree on this point: that the Feast of Tabernacles is the time when the quantity of the rains for the coming year is decided in heaven; cf, Patai, p. 41.

the Jerusalem cultus. Recent studies ( Mowinckel, Peder
sen, Hans Schmidt, A. R. Johnson, for example) have de
fined the ritual elements and the cosmogonico-eschatological implications of the Psalms and have shown the role
played by the king in the New Year festival, which commemorated the triumph of Yahweh, leader of the forces
of light, over the forces of darkness (the chaos of the sea,
the primordial monster Rahab). This triumph was fol
lowed by the enthronement of Yahweh as king and the
repetition of the cosmogonic act. The slaying of the monster Rahab and the victory over the waters (signifying the
organization of the world) were equivalent to the creation of the cosmos and at the same time to the "salvation" of
man (victory over "death," guarantee of food for the coming year, and so on). 13 Of these various traces of ar
chaic cults, let us for the moment bear in mind only the
periodic repetition (at the "revolution of the year," Exodus 34 : 22; at the "going out" of the year, 23 : 16) of
the Creation; for the combat with Rahab presupposes the
reactualization of primordial chaos, while the victory over the waters can only signify the establishment of "stable
forms," i.e., the Creation. We shall see later that in the
consciousness of the Hebrew people this cosmogonic vic
tory becomes victory over foreign kings present and to come; the cosmogony justifies Messianism and the Apocalypse, and thus lays the foundations for a philosophy of
history. The fact that this periodic "salvation" of man finds an
immediate counterpart in the guarantee of food for the
year to come (consecration of the new harvest) must not be allowed to hypnotize us to the point of seeing in this
ceremonial only the traces of a primitive agrarian festival.

THE REGENERATION OF TIME
Indeed, on the one hand, alimentation had a ritual meaning
in all archaic societies; what we call "vital values'* was
rather the expression of an ontology in biological terms; for archaic man, life is an absolute reality, and, as such,
it is sacred. On the other hand, the New Year, the Feast
of Tabernacles so called (hag hasuk-k6t), pre-eminently the
festival of Yahweh (Judges 1 : 19; Leviticus 23 : 39; etc.), took place on the fifteenth day of the seventh month
(Deuteronomy 16: IS; Zechariah 14: 16), that is, five
days after the 'iom ha-kippurim (Leviticus 16 : 29) and its
ceremonial of the scapegoat. Now it is difficult to separate
these two religious moments, the elimination of the sins
of the collectivity and the festival of the New Year, es
pecially if we bear in mind that, before the adoption of the Babylonian calendar, the seventh month was thefirst month
in the Jewish calendar. It was customary, at the time of the
i6m ha-kippurim, for the girls to go outside the boundaries
of the village or town to dance and amuse themselves, and
it was on this occasion that marriages were arranged. But it was also on this day that freedom was allowed to a number of excesses, sometimes even orgiastic, which remind
us both of the final phase of the akitu (also celebrated out
side the town) and of the various forms of license that were
the rule almost everywhere in the frame of New Year
ceremonials. 14
Marriages, sexual license, collective purification through confession of sins and expulsion of the scapegoat, conse
cration of the new harvest, enthronement of Yahweh and commemoration of his victory over "death," were so
many moments of an extensive ceremonial system. The
ambivalence and polarity of these episodes (fasting and
excess, grief and joy, despair and orgy) only confirm their

complementary function in the frame of the same system.
But the chief moments indubitably remain the purification
through the scapegoat and the repetition of the cosmogonic
act by Yahweh; all the rest is only the application, on dif
ferent planes answering to different needs, of the same
archetypal gesture: the regeneration of the world and life
through repetition of the cosmogony.
Periodicity of the Creation
THE CREATION of the world, then, is reproduced every year. Allah is he who effects the creation, hence he repeats it
(Qur'dn, X, 4f.)- This eternal repetition of the cosmo
gonic act, by transforming every New Year into the in
auguration of an era, permits the return of the dead to
life, and maintains the hope of the faithful in the resurrec
tion of the body. We shall soon return to the relations be
tween the New Year ceremonies and the cult of the dead.
At this point let us note that the beliefs, held almost everywhere, according to which the dead return to their families
(and often return as "living dead'*) at the New Year
season (during the twelve days between Christmas and
Epiphany) signify the hope that the abolition of time is
possible at this mythical moment, in which the world is
destroyed and re-created. The dead can come back now,
for all barriers between the dead and the living are broken
(is not primordial chaos reactualized?), and they will come back because at this paradoxical instant time will be sus
pended, hence they can again be contemporaries of the
living. Moreover, since a new Creation is then in prepara
tion, they can hope for a return to life that will be enduring
and concrete. This is why, where belief in the resurrection of the body
69,



THE REGENERATION OF TIME
is prevalent, it is also believed that it will take place at
the beginning of the year, that is, at the opening of a new epoch. Lehmann and Pedersen have shown this for the
Semitic peoples, while Wensinck 15 has collected copious
evidence for it in the Christian tradition. For example:
"The Almighty awakens the bodies (at Epiphany) together
with the spirits/* 16 A Pahlavi text given by Darmesteter
says: "It is in the month Fravardin, on the day Xurdath, that the Lord Ormazd will produce the resurrection and the
'second body* and that the world will be saved from im
potence with the demons, the drugs, etc. And there will be abundance everywhere; there will be no more want of
food; the world will be pure, man liberated from the op
position [of the evil spirit] and immortal for ever/* 17
Qazwlnl, for his part, says that, on the day of Nawroz, God resuscitated the dead "and he gave them back their souls,
and he gave his orders to the sky, which shed rain upon
them, and thus it is that people have adopted the custom
of pouring water on that day/' 18 The very close connec
tions between the ideas of Creation through water ( aquatic
cosmogony, deluge that periodically regenerates historical life, rain), birth, and resurrection are confirmed by this
saying from the Talmud: "God hath three keys, of rain, of birth, of rising of the dead/' 19
The symbolic repetition of the Creation in the setting
of the New Year festival has been preserved down to our
times among the Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran. Even today, at the beginning of the year the Tatars of Persia plant seed
in a jar filled with earth; they do it, they say, in memory of the Creation. The custom of sowing seed at the time

of the spring equinox (we must remember that March
marked the beginning of the year in numerous civiliza
tions) is found over a very extensive area and has always
been linked with agricultural ceremonies, 20 But the drama
of vegetation enters into the symbolism of the periodic
regeneration of nature and man. Agriculture is only one
of the planes upon which the symbolism of periodic re
generation applies. And if the popular and empiric char
acter of the "agricultural version" of this symbolism has enabled it to attain an extreme dissemination, that version
can in no case be regarded as the principle and intent of
the complex symbolism of periodic regeneration. That symbolism has its foundation in lunar mysticism; hence,
from the ethnographic point of view, we are able to recog
nize it even in preagrarian societies. What is primordial
and essential is the idea of regeneration, that is, of repeti
tion of the Creation. The custom of the Tatars of Persia must, then, be fitted
into the Iranian cosmo-eschatological system that presup
poses it and explains it. The Nawroz, the Persian New Year, is at once the festival of Ahuramazda (celebrated on the day "Ormazd" of the first month) and the day on
which the Creation of the world and of man took place. 21
It is on the day of Nawroz that "renovating the creation" takes place. 22 According to the tradition transmitted by
Dimasqi,23 the king proclaimed: "Here is a new day of a new month of a new year; what time has wasted must be

renewed/* It is on this day too that the fate of men is
fixed for a whole year.24 On the night of Nawroz, innumerable fires and lights are to be seen,25 and purifications by water and libations are performed to ensure abundant rains for the coming year. 26 Moreover, at the time of the
"great Nawroz" it was the custom for everyone to sow seven kinds of seed in a jar "and from their growth they
drew conclusions regarding the corn of that year/' w This
custom is similar to the "fixing of fates" of the Babylonian
New Year, a "fixing of fates" that has been perpetuated
down to our day in the New Year ceremonials of the
Mandaeans and the Yezedis. 28 It is also because the New
Year repeats the cosmogonic act that the twelve days be
tween Christmas and Epiphany are still regarded today as
a prefiguration of the twelve months of the year. The
peasants of Europe have no other reason for their universal practice of determining the weather of each month and its quota of rain in accordance with the meteorological signs
of these twelve days. 29 We hardly need remind ourselves that it was at the Feast of Tabernacles that the quantity of rain assigned to each month was determined. For their part, the Indians of the Vedic era set apart the twelve
days of midwinter as an image and replica of the year
(Kg-Veda, IV, S3, 7). However, in certain places and at certain periods, espe

daily in the calendar of Darius, the Iranians recognized yet
another New Year's Day, Mihragan, the festival of Mithra,
which fell in the middle of summer. The Persian theolo
gians, says al-BIrum, "consider Mihragan as a sign of
resurrection and the end of the world, because at Mihragan that which grows reaches its perfection and has no more
material for further growth, and because animals cease
from sexual intercourse. In the same way they make Nawr6z a sign for the beginning of the world, because the
contrary of all these things happens on Nawroz/' 30 The
end of the past year and the beginning of a new year are
interpreted, in the tradition transmitted by al-BIrum, as an
exhaustion of biological resources on all cosmic planes, a veritable end of the world. (The "end of the world," i.e., of
a particular historical cycle, is not always occasioned by a
deluge, but also arises through fire, heat, etc. A magnificent apocalyptic vision, in which summer, with its scorching heat, is conceived as a return to chaos, is found in Isaiah
34 : 4, 9-11. Cf. similar images in Bahman-Tast, II, 41;
and Lactantius, Dimnae Institutiones, VII, 16, 6.) 31 In his Le Probleme 'des centaures, Professor Georges Dumezil has studied the scenario of the end and the be
ginning of the year in a considerable part of the Indo
European world (Slavs, Iranians, Indians, Greco-Romans) and has distinguished the elements deriving from initiation
ceremonies and preserved, in more or less corrupt form,
by mythology and folklore. From an examination of the
myths and rites of the Germanic secret societies and Mannerbunde, Otto Hofler has drawn similar conclusions as to
the importance of the twelve intercalary days and especially
of New Year's Day. For his part, Waldemar Liungman has

made the fire rites of the beginning of the year and the scenario of the carnival proceedings during these twelve
days the subject of an extensive investigation, with the
orientation and results of which we are, however, not al
ways in agreement. We may also mention the researches
of Otto Huth and J. Hertel, who, applying themselves to
Roman and Vedic data, have especially insisted upon their motifs of renewal of the world through rekindling of the
fire at the winter solstice, a renewal that is equivalent to a
njew creation. 32 For the purposes of the present essay, we
shall recall only a few characteristic facts: (l) the twelve intermediate days prefigure the twelve months of the year
(see also the rites mentioned above) ; (%) during the twelve
corresponding nights, the dead come in procession to visit their families (apparition of the horse, pre-eminently the
funerary animal, on the last night of the year; presence of the chthonico-funerary divinities Holda, Perchta, "Wilde Heer," etc., during these twelve nights), and this visit often ( among the Germanic peoples and the Japanese) occurs in the frame of the ceremonial of the male secret
societies; 33 (s) it is at this period that fires are extin
guished and rekindled; ** and finally (4) this is the moment of initiations, one of whose essential elements is precisely this extinction and rekindling of fire. 35 In this same

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
mythico-ceremonial complex of the end of the past year
and the beginning of the New Year, we must also include
the following facts: (5) ritual combats between two op
posing groups (see above, pp. 53 IF.); and (6) presence of
the erotic element (pursuit of girls, "Gandharvic" mar
riages, orgies; above, pp. 61 ). Each of these mythico-ritual motifs testifies to the
wholly exceptional character of the days that precede and follow the first day of the year, although the eschato
cosmological function of the New Year (abolition of past
time and repetition of the Creation) is not explicitly stated, except in the rites of prefiguration of the months and in
the extinction and rekindling of fire. Nevertheless, this function can be shown to be implicit in all the rest of these
mythico-ritual motifs. How could the invasion by the souls
of the dead, for example, be anything but the sign of a
suspension of profane time, the paradoxical realization of a coexistence of "past" and "present"? This coexistence
is never so complete as at a period of chaos when all
modalities coincide. The last days of the past year can be
identified with the pre-Creation chaos, both through this invasion of the dead which annuls the law of time and
through the sexual excesses which commonly mark the occasion. Even if, as the result of successive calendar re
forms, the Saturnalia finally no longer coincided with the end and the beginning of the year, they nevertheless con
tinued to mark the abolition of all norms and, in their
violence, to illustrate an overturning of values (e.g., ex
change of condition between masters and slaves, women
treated as courtesans) and a general license, an orgiastic modality of society, in a word a reversion of all forms to
indeterminate unity. The very locus appropriated to orgies
among primitive peoples, preferably at the critical moments of the harvest (when the seed was buried in the
68



THE REGENERATION OF TIME
ground), confirms this symmetry between the dissolution
of the "form" (here the seed) In the soil and that of "social
forms" in the orgiastic chaos. 36 On the vegetable plane, as
on the human plane, we are in the presence of a return to
the primordial unity, to the inauguration of a "nocturnal" regime in which limits, contours, distances, are Indiscernible.
The ritual extinguishing of fires is to be attributed to
the same tendency to put an end to existing forms (worn
away by the fact of their own existence) in order to make room for the birth of a new form, issuing from a new
Creation. The ritual combats between two groups of actors reactualize the cosmogonic moment of the fight be
tween the god and the primordial dragon (the serpent
almost everywhere symbolizing what is latent, preformal, undifferentiated) . Finally, the coincidence of initiations
in which the lighting of the "new fire" plays an especially
important part with the period of the New Year is ex
plained both by the presence of the dead (secret and in
itiatory societies being at the same time representatives of the ancestors) and by the very structure of these cere
monies, which always suppose a "death" and a "resurrec
tion/' a "new birth," a "new man." It would be impossible
to find a more appropriate frame for the initiation rituals
than the twelve nights when the past year vanishes to give
place to another year, another era: that is, to the period
when, through the reactualization of the Creation, the
world in effect begins.
Documented among almost all the Indo-European peo
ples, these mythico-ritual scenarios of the New Year
86 Of course, the role of the orgy in agricultural societies is far more complex.
Sexual excesses exercised a magical influence on the coming harvest. But it is always possible to trace in it the tendency toward a violent fusion of all forms, in
other words toward the reactualization of the pre-Creation chaos. See the chapter
on agrarian mysticism in our Traite d'histoire des religions (Paris, 1949), pp. 85 ff.

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
with their entire train of carnival masks, their funerary
animals, their secret societies were doubtless organized
in their essential lines as early as the period of the Indo
European community. But such scenarios, or at least the
aspects that we have emphasized in the present essay, cannot be regarded as an exclusively Indo-European creation. Centuries before the appearance of the Indo-Euro
peans in Asia Minor, the mythico-ritual complex of the
New Year, regarded as repetition of the Creation, was known to the Suxnero-Akkadians, and important elements of it are found among the Egyptians and the Hebrews.
Since the genesis of mythico-ritual forms does not concern us here, we can content ourselves with the convenient
hypothesis according to which these two ethnic groups (peoples of the Near East and Indo-Europeans) already possessed them in their prehistoric traditions. This hy
pothesis, by the way, is made even more plausible by the fact that an analogous system has been discovered in an
eccentric culture: that of Japan. Dr. Slawik has studied the
symmetries between the Japanese and the German secret
organizations and has brought out an impressive number of parallel facts. 37 In Japan, as among the Germans (and
among other Indo-European peoples) , the last night of the
year is marked by the appearance of funerary animals
(horses, etc.), and of the chthonico-funerary gods and goddesses; it is then that the masked processions of the
secret societies take place, that the dead visit the living,
and that initiations are performed. Such secret societies are
very old in Japan M and any influence from the Semitic East
or of Indo-European origin appears to be excluded, at least in our present state of knowledge. All that can be
87 Slawik, op. cit.
* Ibid., p. 762.
70



THE REGENERATION OF TIME
said, Slawik prudently notes, is that in the West as in the
East of Eurasia, the cult complex of the "visitor" (souls of
the dead, gods, and so on) developed before the historical
period. This is one more confirmation of the archaic char
acter of the New Year ceremonials.
At the same time, Japanese tradition has preserved the
memory of a conception that is connected with the cere
monials of the year's end and that we may perhaps classify
under the head of mystical psycho-physiology. Using the
findings of the Japanese ethnographer Dr. Masao Oka,39 Slawik situates the ceremonials of the secret societies in
what he calls the tama complex. This tama is a spiritual
substance that is found in man, in the souls of the dead,
and in "holy men," and that, when winter passes into
spring, becomes agitated and attempts to leave the body, while it impels the dead toward the dwellings of the living
(cult complex of the visitor). It is to prevent this forsaking of the body by the tama that, according to Slawik's inter
pretation,40 the festivals designed to hold or fix this
spiritual substance are celebrated. It is probable that one
of the purposes of the ceremonials of the end and the be
ginning of the year is likewise the "fixation" of the tama.
Of this Japanese mystical psycho-physiology we shall, however, stress in particular the sense of annual crisis: the
tama's tendency to become agitated and quit its normal
condition when winter passes into spring (that is, during
the last days of the ending year and the first days of the
beginning year) is simply an elementary physiological formulation of retrogression into the nondistinct, of the reactualization of chaos. In this annual crisis of the tama>
the primitive's experience finds a presage of the inevitable 89 "Kulturschichten in Altjapan," German translation (still unpublished) from
Dr. Masao Oka's Japanese MS. 40 Slawik, pp. 679 ff. 71



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
confusion that is to put an end to a particular historical
epoch in order to permit its renewal and regeneration, that
is, in order to resume history at its beginning.
We shall further cite the group of periodical ceremonies
practiced by the Karuk, Yurok, and Hupa tribes of Cali
fornia, ceremonies known by the names "New Year,"
" world's restoration/' or "repair." The institution of the
rites is attributed to mythical and immortal beings who inhabited the earth before mankind; it is these immortal beings who had first performed the ceremonies of the
"world's renewal" and in exactly the places where mortals perform them today. "The esoteric magic and avowed pur
pose of the focal ceremonies comprising the system," Kroeber writes, "include reestablishment or firming of the
earth, first-fruits observances, new fire, prevention of dis
ease and calamity for another year or biennium." Hence we here have to do with an annual repetition of the cosmo
gonic ceremony inaugurated, in illo tempore, by immortal beings; for among the symbolic gestures performed, one of the most important is what the tribesmen call "putting
posts under the world," and the ceremony coincides with
the last moonless night and the appearance of the new
moon, which implies the re-creation of the world. The fact
that the New Year rite also includes the raising of the
interdict upon the new harvest also confirms that we are
dealing with a wholly new beginning of life. 41

72



THE REGENERATION Of TIME
In connection with this "world's restoration/' it is in
structive to recall the ideology at the base of what has been
called the ghost-dance religion; this mystical movement, which seized upon the North American tribes toward the
end of the nineteenth century, prophesied the approach of universal regeneration, that is, the imminence of the end
of the world, followed by the restoration of a paradisiacal
earth. The ghost-dance religion is too complex to be summarized in a few lines, but for our purposes it will suffice
to say that it attempted to hasten the end of the world by a massive and collective communication with the dead, achieved after dances that continued for four or five days
without intermission. The dead invaded the earth, com
municated with the living, and thus created a "confusion"
that announced the close of the current cosmic cycle. But
since the mythical visions of the "beginning" and the
"end" of time are hoinologues eschatology, at least in
certain aspects, becoming one with cosmogony the eschaton of the ghost-dance religion reactualized the mythi
cal illud tempus of Paradise, of primordial plenitude. 42
Continuous Regeneration of Time
THE HETEROGENEOUS nature of the material reviewed in the
preceding pages need cause the reader no uneasiness. We
have no intention of drawing any sort of ethnographic con
clusion from this rapid exposition. Our sole aim has been
a summary phenomenological analysis of these periodic
purification rites (expulsion of demons, diseases, and sins) and of the ceremonials of the end and beginning of the
year. That within each group of analogous beliefs there

73



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
are variations, differences, incompatibilities, that the origin and dissemination of these ceremonials raise a host of
problems requiring further study, we are the first to admit.
It is for this very reason that we have avoided any kind of
sociological or ethnographic interpretation and have limited ourselves to a simple exposition of the general meaning that emanates from all these ceremonials. In short, our
ambition is to understand their meaning, to endeavor to
see what they show us leaving to possible future studies
the detailed examination (genetic or historical) of each
separate mythico-ritual complex.
It goes without saying that there are we should al
most feel justified in writing that there must be very con
siderable differences between the various groups of peri
odic ceremonies, if only for the simple reason that we are dealing with both historical and "anhistorical" peoples or
strata, with what are generally called "civilized man" and
"primitive man." It is further of interest to note that the
New Year scenarios in which the Creation is repeated are
particularly explicit among the historical peoples, those
with whom history, properly speaking, begins that is, the Babylonians, Egyptians, Hebrews, Iranians. It almost seems that these peoples, conscious that they were the
first to build "history/* recorded their own acts for the
use of their successors (not, however, without inevitable
transfigurations in the matter of categories and archetypes, as we have seen in the preceding chapter). These same
peoples also appear to have felt a deeper need to regenerate
themselves periodically by abolishing past time and reactualizing the cosmogony. As for the primitive societies that still live in the para
dise of archetypes and for whom time is recorded only
biologically without being allowed to become "history" that is, without its corrosive action being able to exert
74



THE REGENERATION OF TIME
itself upon consciousness by revealing the irreversibility of events these primitive societies regenerate themselves
periodically through expulsion of "evils" and confession of sins. The need these societies also feel for a periodic
regeneration is a proof that they too cannot perpetually
maintain their position in what we have just called the
paradise of archetypes, and that their memory is capable (though doubtless far less intensely than that of a modern
man) of revealing the irreversibility of events, that is, of
recording history. Thus, among these primitive peoples
too, the existence of man in the cosmos is regarded as a
fall. The vast and monotonous morphology of the confes
sion of sins, authoritatively studied by R. Pettazzoni in
La confessione del peccati, shows us that, even in the sim
plest human societies, "historical" memory, that is, the recollection of events that derive from no archetype, the
recollection of personal events ("sins" in the majority of
cases), is intolerable. We know that the beginning of the
avowal of sins was a magical conception of eliminating a fault through some physical means (blood, speech, and so forth). But again it is not the confessional procedure in
itself that interests us it is magical in structure but
primitive man's need to free himself from the recollection
of sin, i.e., of a succession of personal events that, taken
together, constitute history. Thus we observe the immense importance that collective
regeneration through repetition of the cosmogonic act ac
quired among the peoples who created history. We might point out here that, for reasons which, of course, are various, but also because of the metaphysical and anhistori
cal structure of Indian spirituality, the Indians never elab
orated a cosmological New Year scenario as extensive as
those found in the ancient Near East. We might also point
out that an outstandingly historical people, the Romans, 75



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
were continuously obsessed by the "end of Rome" and
sought Innumerable systems of renovatio. But for the mo
ment we do not wish to set the reader on this path. Hence
we shall limit ourselves to pointing out that, aside from
these periodic ceremonies of abolishing history, the tra
ditional societies (that is, all societies down to those which
make up the modern world) knew and applied still other
methods intended to bring about the regeneration of time.
We have shown elsewhere 43 that construction rituals
likewise presuppose the more or less explicit imitation of the cosmogonic act. For traditional man, the imitation of
an archetypal model is a reactualization of the mythical
moment when the archetype was revealed for the first time. Consequently, these ceremonies too, which are
neither periodic nor collective, suspend the flow of profane
time, of duration, and project the celebrant into a mythical
time, in illo tempore. We have seen that all rituals imitate a divine archetype and that their continual reactualization
takes place in one and the same atemporal mythical instant.
However, the construction rites show us something beyond
this: imitation, hence reactualization, of the cosmogony, A
"new era" opens with the building of every house. Every
construction is an absolute beginning; that is, tends to
restore the initial instant, the plenitude of a present that contains no trace of history. Of course, the construction
rituals found in our day are in great part survivals, and it is difficult to determine to what extent they are accom
panied by an experience in the consciousness of the per
sons who observe them. But this rationalistic objection
is negligible. What is important is that man has felt the
need to reproduce the cosmogony in his constructions,
whatever be their nature; that this reproduction made him

contemporary with the mythical moment of the beginning of the world and that he felt the need of returning to that
moment, as often as possible, in order to regenerate himself. It would require a most uncommon degree of perspicacity for anyone to be able to say to what extent those
who, in the modern world, continue to repeat construction
rituals still share in their meaning and their mystery.
Doubtless their experiences are, on the whole, profane:
the New Year signalized by a construction is translated
into a new stage in the life of those who are to live In the house. But the structure of the myth and the rite remains
unaltered by any of this, even if the experiences aroused by their actualization are no longer anything but profane:
a construction is a new organization of the world and life. All that is needed is a modern man with a sensibility less closed to the miracle of life; and the experience of renewal would revive for him when he built a house or entered it
for the first time (just as, even in the modern world, the
New Year still preserves the prestige of the end of a past
and the fresh beginning of a new life) . In many cases the available documents are sufficiently
explicit: the construction of a sanctuary or a sacrificial
altar repeats the cosmogony, and not only because the
sanctuary represents the world but also because it in
carnates the various temporal cycles. Here, for example, is what Flavius Josephus ** has to tell us on the subject in
connection with the traditional symbolism of the Temple
of Jerusalem: the three parts of the sanctuary correspond to the three cosmic regions (the court representing the
sea that is, the lower regions the Holy Place the earth,
and the Holy of Holies heaven) ; the twelve loaves on the table are the twelve months of the year; the candelabrum
with seventy branches represents the decans. The builders

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
of the Temple not only constructed the world; they also
constructed cosmic time.
The construction of cosmic time through repetition of
the cosmogony is still more clearly brought out by the symbolism of Brahmanic sacrifice. Each Brahmanic sacri
fice marks a new Creation of the world (cf., for example,
Satapatha Brahma^a, VI, 5, 1 ff.). Indeed, the construction of the sacrificial altar is conceived as a "Creation of the world/' The water with which the clay is mixed is the
primordial water; the clay that forms the base of the altar
is the earth; the side walls represent the atmosphere.
Furthermore, each stage in the building of the altar is accompanied by verses in which the cosmic region that has
just been created is explicitly named (Satapatha Brahmaya,
I, 9, 2, 29; VI, 5, 1 ff.; 7, 2, 12; 7, 3, 1; 7, 3, 9). But if the
raising of the altar imitates the cosmogonic act, the sacri
fice proper has another end: to restore the primordial
unity, that which existed before the Creation. For Pra
japati created the cosmos from his own substance; and once he had given it forth, "he feared death" (X, 4, 2, 2) and the gods brought him offerings to restore and revive
him. In just the same way, he who today celebrates the
sacrifice reproduces this primordial restoration of Praja
patL "Thus whosoever, knowing this, performs this holy
work, or he who but knows this [without practicing any
ritual] makes up this Prajapati whole and complete" (X,
4, 3, 24, etc.}. 48 The sacrificed conscious effort to re-es
tablish the primordial unity, that is, to restore the whole
that preceded the Creation, is a very important characteristic of the Indian spirit with its thirst for primordial
unity, but we cannot pause to consider it. Let it suffice that
we have found that, with every sacrifice, the Brahman
45 Trans. Julius Eggeling, in The Sacred Booh of the East, XLIII (Oxford, 1897),

78



THE REGENERATION OF TIME
reactualizes the archetypal cosmogonic act, and that this
coincidence between the ''mythical instant" and the "pres
ent moment" supposes both the abolition of profane time and the continual regeneration of the world.
In effect, if "Prajapati is the Year" (Aitareya Brahma^ta, VII, 7, 2, etc.), "the Year is the same as Death; and who
soever knows this Year (to be) Death, his life that (year)
does not destroy . . /' (Satapatha Brahma%a, X, 4, 3,
l). 46 The Vedic altar, to employ Paul Mus' apt formula, is time materialized. "That fire-altar also is the Year,
the nights are its enclosing stones, and there are three hundred and sixty of these, because there are three hun
dred and sixty nights in the year; and the days are its
yagushmati bricks, for there are three hundred and sixty of these, and three hundred and sixty days in the year"
(X, 5, 4, 10). 47 At a certain moment in the construction of
the altar, two bricks called "of the seasons" (rtavya] are laid, and the text comments: "And as to why he lays
down these two in this (layer): this Agni (fire-altar) is
the year . . . Again, . . . this fire-altar is Prajapati,
and Prajapati is the year" (VIII, , 1, 17-18). 48 To reconstruct Prajapati by means of a Vedic altar is also to recon
struct cosmic time. "Of five layers consists the fire-altar
(each layer is a season), five seasons are a year, and the
year is Agni (the altar) . . . And that Prajapati who became relaxed is the year; and those five bodily parts of his
which became relaxed are the seasons; for there are five
seasons, and five are those layers: when he builds up the
five layers, he thereby builds him up with the seasons . . .
And those five bodily parts of his, the seasons, which be
came relaxed, are the regions (or quarters; i.e., the four
cardinal points of the compass and the upper region) ; for

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
five in number are the regions, and five those layers: when he builds up the five layers, he builds him up with the
regions" (VI, 8, 1, 15; I, , 18 ff.).
49 Thus, with the con
struction of each new Vedic altar, not only is the cosmogony
repeated and Prajapati revived, but the year is constructed;
that is, time is regenerated by being "created" anew.
The English anthropologist A. M. Hocart, in his brilliant and controversial book Kingship, has studied the
ceremonial of the enthronement of the king among a num
ber of civilized and primitive peoples and compared them with initiation rituals (which he regards as derived from
the scenario of the royal ritual). That initiation is a "new
birth," which includes a ritual death and resurrection, has long been known. But we are indebted to Hocart for
identifying the initiatory elements of the coronation cere
monial and thus establishing suggestive parallels between various groups of rituals. It is interesting to note further
that among the Fijians of the mountainous region of Viti
Levu, the installation of the chief is called "Creation of the
world," while among the tribes of eastern Vanua Levu it bears the name of mbuli vanua or tuli vanua, terms which
Hocart translates as "fashioning the land" or "creating the
earth." 50 For the Scandinavians, as the preceding chapter
showed, taking possession of a territory was equivalent to a repetition of the Creation. For the natives of the Fijis, the Creation takes place at each enthronement of a new
chief, an idea that is also preserved in other places in more or less obvious forms. Almost everywhere a new reign has
been regarded as a regeneration of the history of the people or even of universal history. With each new sover
eign, insignificant as he might be, a "new era" began. Such formulas have often been viewed as flattery or stylistic

THE REGENERATION OF TIME
artifices. The fact is that they seem exceptional to us only because they have been transmitted to us with a certain
solemnity. But in the primitive conception, a new era begins not only with every new reign but also with the con
summation of every marriage, the birth of every child, and so on. For the cosmos and man are regenerated cease
lessly and by all kinds of means, the past is destroyed, evils
and sins are eliminated, etc. Differing in their formulas, all these instruments of regeneration tend toward the same
end: to annul past time, to abolish history by a continuous
return in illo tempore, by the repetition of the cosmogonic
act.
But to return to the Fijians, these islanders repeat the
Creation not only on the occasion of each enthronement
but also each time that the crops are bad. This detail, upon which Hocart does not insist, since it does not confirm his
hypothesis of the "ritual origin" of the cosmogonic myth, seems to us of considerable significance. Each time that
life is threatened and the cosmos, in their eyes, is exhausted
and empty, the Fijians feel the need for a return in prin
cipio; in other words they expect the regeneration of cosmic life not from its restoration but from its re
creation. Hence the essential importance, in rituals and
myths, of anything which can signify the "beginning/' the original, the primordial (new vessels and "water drawn before sunrise" in popular magic and medicine, the motifs
of the child, the orphan, and so forth). 51 This idea that life cannot be restored but only re-created
through repetition of the cosmogony is very clearly shown in curative rituals. In fact, among many primitive peoples an essential element of any cure is the recitation of the
cosmogonic myth; this is documented, for example, among the most archaic tribes of India, the Bhils, the Santals, the
81 Cf. our Comentarii la kgenda Me$tendui Manole, especially pp. 56 ff. 81



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
Baigas. 5f It Is through the actualization of the cosmic
Creation, exemplary model of all life, that it is hoped to
restore the physical health and spiritual integrity of the
patient. Among these tribes the cosmogonic myth is also recited on the occasion of birth, marriage, and death; for
it is always through a symbolic return to the atemporal instant of primordial plenitude that it is hoped to assure
the perfect realization of each of these situations.
Among the Polynesians, the number of "situations" in
which the recitation of the cosmogonic myth is efficacious
is still greater. According to the myth, in the beginning there were only the primordial waters, plunged in cosmic
darkness. From "within the breathing-space of immen
sity/* lo, the supreme god, expressed the desire to emerge
from his repose. Immediately, light appeared. Then he went on: "Ye waters of Tai-Kama, be ye separate. Heav
ens, be formed!" And thus, through lo's cosmogonic words, the world came into existence. Recalling these
"ancient and original sayings . . . the ancient and orig
inal cosmological wisdom (wananga), which caused growth from the void, etc./' a Polynesian of our day, Hare Hongi, adds, with eloquent awkwardness:
And now, my friends, there are three very important applications of those original sayings, as used in our sacred rituals.
The first occurs in the ritual for planting a child in the barren
womb. The next occurs in the ritual for enlightening both the
mind and body. The third and last occurs in the ritual on the
solemn subject of death, and of war, of baptism, of genealogical
recitals and such like important subjects, as the priests most particularly concerned themselves in. The words by which lo fashioned the Universe that is to
say, by which it was implanted and caused to produce a world of light the same words are used in the ritual for implanting a

THE REGENERATION OF TIME
child in a barren womb. The words by which lo caused light to shine in the darkness are used in the rituals for cheering a
gloomy and despondent heart, the feeble aged, the decrepit; for shedding light into secret places and matters, for inspiration in song-composing and in many other affairs, affecting man to despair in times of adverse war. For all such the ritual includes
the words (used by lo) to overcome and dispel darkness.
Thirdly, there is the preparatory ritual which treats of successive formations within the universe, and the genealogical history
of man himself." M
Thus the cosmogonic myth serves the Polynesians as the archetypal model for all "Creations," on whatever plane
they are manifested, be it biological, psychological, or
spiritual. To listen to the recital of the birth of the world
is to become the contemporary of the creative act par
excellence, the cosmogony. It is significant that among the Navajos the principal occasion for the narration of the
cosmogonic myth is in connection with cures. "All the
ceremonies center around a patient, Hatrali (one sung
over), who may be sick or merely sick in mind, i.e.,
frightened by a dream, or who may be needing only a ceremony, in order to learn it in the course of being initiated
into full power of officiating in that chant for a Medicine
Man cannot give a healing ceremony until he has the
ceremony given over him/' M The ceremony also comprises the execution of complex designs on sand (sand paintings), which symbolize the different stages of the Creation and
the mythical history of the gods, the ancestors, and hu
manity. These designs (which bear a strange resemblance to the Indo-Tibetan ma%$alas) reactualize, one by one,
the events which took place in illo tempore. Listening to the

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
recital of the cosmogonic myth (followed by the recitation
of the myths of origin) and contemplating the sand paint
ings, the patient is projected out of profane time into the plenitude of primordial time: he has gone back to the origin of the world and is thus a witness of the cosmogony.
Very often the patient takes a bath on the same day that
the recitation of the myth or the execution of the sand
paintings begins; in effect, he too rebegins his life, in the strict sense of the word.
Among the Navajos, as among the Polynesians, the cos
mogonic myth is followed by recitation of the myths of
origin, which contain the mythical history of all "beginnings": the creation of man, animals, and pLints, the origin of the tribe's traditional institutions and culture, and so on.
In this way the patient goes over the mythical history of
the world, of the Creation, down to the moment when the narrative that is being told was first revealed. This is ex
tremely important for an understanding of primitive and traditional medicine. In the ancient East, as in every
"popular" medical tradition, whether in Europe or else
where, a remedy becomes effective only if its origin is
known and if, consequently, its application becomes con
temporary with the mythical moment of its discovery. This is why, in so many incantations, the history of the disease,
or of the demon who causes it, is related and at the same time the moment is evoked when a god or a saint suc
ceeded in conquering it. Thus, for example, an Assyrian incantation against toothache relates that "after Anu made
the heavens, the heavens made the earth, the earth made the rivers, the rivers made the canals, the canals made the pools, the pools made the Worm/' And the Worm goes
"weeping" to Shamash and Ea and asks them what will
be given it to eat, to "destroy." The gods offer it fruits,
but the Worm asks them for human teeth. "Since thou hast 84



THE REGENERATION OF TIME
spoken thus, O Worm, may Ea break thee with his power
ful hand!" w Here we are presented not only with a simple
repetition of the paradigmatic curative gesture (destruc
tion of the Worm by Ea) , which ensures the effectiveness
of the treatment, but also with the mythical history of the
disease, by evoking which the doctor projects the patient
in illo tempore.
THE EXAMPLES that we have given could easily be multiplied, but it is not our intention to exhaust the themes we
encounter in this essay; we only wish to situate them in
accordance with a common perspective: the need of archaic
societies to regenerate themselves periodically through the annulment of time. Collective or individual, periodic or
spontaneous, regeneration rites always comprise, in their structure and meaning, an element of regeneration through
repetition of an archetypal act, usually of the cosmogonic
act. What is of chief importance to us in these archaic
systems is the abolition of concrete time, and hence their
antihistorical intent. This refusal to preserve the memory
of the past, even of the immediate past, seems to us to
betoken a particular anthropology. We refer to archaic man's refusal to accept himself as a historical being, his
refusal to grant value to memory and hence to the unusual
events (i.e., events without an archetypal model) that in
fact constitute concrete duration. In the last analysis, what
we discover in all these rites and all these attitudes is the
will to devaluate time. Carried to their extreme, all the
rites and all the behavior patterns that we have so far
mentioned would be comprised in the following statement:
"If we pay no attention to it, time does not exist; furthermore, where it becomes perceptible because of man's
'sins/ i.e., when man departs from the archetype and

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
falls into duration time can be annulled." Basically, if
viewed in its proper perspective, the life of archaic man
(a life reduced to the repetition of archetypal acts, that is,
to categories and not to events, to the unceasing rehearsal
of the same primordial myths), although it takes place in time, does not bear the burden of time, does not record
time's irreversibility; in other words, completely ignores what is especially characteristic and decisive in a conscious
ness of time. Like the mystic, like the religious man in
general, the primitive lives in a continual present. (And
it is in this sense that the religious man may be said to be
a "primitive"; he repeats the gestures of another and, through this repetition, lives always in an atemporal
present.) That, for a primitive, the regeneration of time is continually effected that is, within the interval of the "year"
too is proven by the antiquity and universality of certain
beliefs in respect to the moon. The moon is the first of
creatures to die, but also the first to live again. We have
elsewhere ** shown the importance of lunar myths in the
organization of the first coherent theories concerning death
and resurrection, fertility and regeneration, initiation, and so on. Here it will suffice to recall that, if the moon in fact
serves to "measure" time,57 if the moon's phases long
before the solar year and far more concretely reveal a unit
of time (the month), the moon at the same time reveals
the "eternal return."
The phases of the moon appearance, increase, wane,
disappearance, followed by reappearance after three nights of darkness have played an immense part in the elabora
tion of cyclical concepts. We find analogous concepts es~
66 fraitf d'histoire des religions (Paris, 194-9), pp. 142 flf.
57 In the Indo-European languages the majority of terras designating the month
and the moon derive from the root me-, which, in Latin, in addition to mentis, produced metiar, "to measure."
86



THE REGENERATION OF TIME
peclally in the archaic apocalypses and anthropogonies; deluge or flood puts an end to an exhausted and sinful
humanity, and a new regenerated humanity is born, usually from a mythical "ancestor" who escaped the ca
tastrophe, or from a lunar animal. A stratigraphic analysis of these groups of myths brings out their lunar character. 58
This means that the lunar rhythm not only reveals short
intervals (week, month) but also serves as the archetype
for extended durations; in fact, the "birth" of a humanity,
its growth, decrepitude ("wear"), and disappearance are assimilated to the lunar cycle. And this assimilation is im
portant not only because it shows us the "lunar" structure
of universal becoming but also because of its optimistic
consequences: for, just as the disappearance of the moon is never final, since it is necessarily followed by a new moon,
the disappearance of man is not final either; in particular,
even the disappearance of an entire humanity (deluge, flood, submersion of a continent, and so on) is never total, for a new humanity is born from a pair of survivors.
This cyclical conception of the disappearance and reappearance of humanity is also preserved in the historical cultures. In the third century B.C., Berossus popularized the Chaldean doctrine of the "Great Year" in a form that
spread through the entire Hellenic world (whence it later
passed to the Romans and the Byzantines). According to this doctrine, the universe is eternal but it is periodically
destroyed and reconstituted every Great Year (the corresponding number of millennia varies from school to school); when the seven planets assemble in Cancer
("Great Winter") there will be a deluge; when they meet in Capricorn (i.e., at the summer solstice of the Great
Year) the entire universe will be consumed by fire. It is
probable that this doctrine of periodic universal conflagra
68 Cf. our TraitS, the chapter on the moon.
87



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
tions was also held by Heraclitos (e.g., Fragment 26B =
66D). In any case, it dominates the thought of Zeno
and the entire Stoic cosmology. The myth of universal
combustion (ekpyrosis) was decidedly in fashion throughout the Romano-Oriental world from the first century B.C. to
the third century of our era; it successively found a place in a considerable number of gnostic systems derived from
Greco-Irano-Judaic syncretism. Similar ideas (doubtless influenced at least in their astronomic formulas by
Babylon) are found in India and Iran, as they are among the
Mayas of Yucatan and the Aztecs of Mexico. We shall
have to return to these questions; but, even now, we are in
a position to emphasize what we referred to above as the
optimistic character of these ideas. In fact, this optimism
can be reduced to a consciousness of the normality of the
cyclical catastrophe, to the certainty that it has a meaning and, above all, that it is never final.
In the "lunar perspective/' the death of the individual
and the periodic death of humanity are necessary, even as the three days of darkness preceding the "rebirth" of the
moon are necessary. The death of the individual and the
death of humanity are alike necessary for their regeneration. Any form whatever, by the mere fact that it exists
as such and endures, necessarily loses vigor and becomes worn; to recover vigor, it must be reabsorbed into the
formless if only for an instant; it must be restored to the
primordial unity from which it issued; in other words, it must return to "chaos" (on the cosmic plane), to "orgy"
(on the social plane), to "darkness" (for seed), to "water" (baptism on the human plane, Atlantis on the plane of
history, and so on).
We may note that what predominates in all these cos
mico-mythological lunar conceptions is the cyclical recurrence of what has been before, in a word, eternal return. 88



THE REGENERATION OF TIME
Here we again find the motif of the repetition of an arche
typal gesture, projected upon all planes cosmic, biologi
cal, historical, human. But we also discover the cyclical structure of time, which is regenerated at each new "birth"
on whatever plane. This eternal return reveals an ontology
uncontaminated by time and becoming. Just as the Greeks,
in their myth of eternal return, sought to satisfy their metaphysical thirst for the "ontic" and the static (for,
from the point of view of the infinite, the becoming of
things that perpetually revert to the same state is, as a result, implicitly annulled and it can even be affirmed that "the world stands still"),59 even so the primitive, by con
ferring a cyclic direction upon time, annuls its irreversi
bility. Everything begins over again at its commencement every instant. The past is but a prefiguration of the future.
No event is irreversible and no transformation is final. In
69 See Henri-Charles Puech's fine exposition, "La Gnose et le temps," Eranos
Jahrbuch, XX (Zurich, 1951), especially pp. 60-61: "Dominated by an ideal of intelligibility that assimilates authentic and complete being to that which exists
in itself and remains identical with itself, to the eternal and immutable, the Greek holds that motion and becoming are inferior degrees of reality, in which identity
is no longer apprehended at best save in the form of permanence and perpe
tuity, hence of recurrence. The circular movement that ensures the maintenance of
the same things by repeating them, by continually bringing back their return, is the most immediate, the most perfect (and hence the most nearly divine) expression of that which, at the pinnacle of the hierarchy, is absolute immobility. According to
the celebrated Platonic definition, time, which is determined and measured by the revolution of the celestial spheres, is the moving image ofunmoving eternity, which it imitates by revolving in a circle. Consequently all cosmic becoming, and, in the
same manner, the duration of this world of generation and corruption in which we live, will progress in a circle or in accordance with an indefinite succession of cycles
in the course of which the same reality is made, unmade, and remade in conformity
with an immutable law and immutable alternations. Not only is the same sum of existence preserved in it, with nothing being lost and nothing created, but in addition certain thinkers of declining Antiquity Pythagoreans, Stoics, Platonists reached the point of admitting that within each of these cycles of duration, of
these aiones, of these aeva, the same situations are reproduced that have already
been produced in previous cycles and will be reproduced in subsequent cycles
ad infinitum. No event is unique, occurs once and for all (for example the condemnation and death of Socrates) , but it has occurred, occurs, and will occur, perpetually; the same individuals have appeared, appear, and reappear at every
return of the cycle upon itself. Cosmic duration is repetition and anakuklosis, eternal return."
89



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
a certain sense, it is even possible to say that nothing new
happens in the world, for everything is but the repetition
of the same primordial archetypes; this repetition, by
actualizing the mythical moment when the archetypal gesture was revealed, constantly maintains the world in the
same auroral instant of the beginnings. Time but makes
possible the appearance and existence of things. It has no final influence upon their existence, since it is itself con
stantly regenerated. Hegel affirmed that in nature things repeat themselves
for ever and that there is "nothing new under the sun/' All that we have so far demonstrated confirms the existence
of a similar conception in the man of archaic societies: for
him things repeat themselves for ever and nothing new
happens under the sun. But this repetition has a meaning, as we saw in the preceding chapter: it alone confers a
reality upon events; events repeat themselves because they imitate an archetype the exemplary event. Further
more, through this repetition, time is suspended, or at least its virulence is diminished. But Hegel's observation
is significant for another reason: Hegel endeavors to es
tablish a philosophy of history in which the historical event,
although irreversible and autonomous, can nevertheless
be placed in a dialectic which remains open. For Hegel,
history is "free" and always "new/* it does not repeat
itself; nevertheless, it conforms to the plans of providence; hence it has a model (ideal, but none the less a model) in
the dialectic of spirit itself. To this history which does
not repeat itself, Hegel opposes nature, in which things
are reproduced ad infinitum. But we have seen that, during a very considerable period, humanity opposed history by
all possible means. May we conclude from all this that,
during this period, humanity was still within nature; had not yet detached itself from nature? "Only the animal is 90



THE REGENERATION OF TIME
truly innocent/* Hegel wrote at the beginning of his Lec
tures on the Philosophy of History. The primitives did not always feel themselves innocent, but they tried to return
to the state of innocence by periodically confessing their
faults. Can we see, in this tendency toward purification, a
nostalgia for the lost paradise of animality? Or5 in the primitive's desire to have no "memory," not to record
time, and to content himself with tolerating it simply as a
dimension of his existence, but without "interiorizing" it,
without transforming it into consciousness, should we rather see his thirst for the "ontic," his will to be, to be
after the fashion of the archetypal beings whose gestures
he constantly repeats? The problem is of the first importance, and we certainly cannot hope to discuss it in a few lines. But we have
reason to believe that among the primitives the nostalgia
for the lost paradise excludes any desire to restore the
"paradise of animality." Everything that we know about the mythical memories of "paradise" confronts us, on the
contrary, with the image of an ideal humanity enjoying a beatitude and spiritual plenitude forever unrealizable in
the present state of "fallen man." In fact, the myths of
many peoples allude to a very distant epoch when men knew neither death nor toil nor suffering and had a bounti
ful supply of food merely for the taking. In illo tempore, the gods descended to earth and mingled with men; for their
part, men could easily mount to heaven. As the result of a ritual fault, communications between heaven and earth
were interrupted and the gods withdrew to the highest
heavens. Since then, men must work for their food and are no longer immortal.
Hence it is more probable that the desire felt by the man
of traditional societies to refuse history, and to confine
himself to an indefinite repetition of archetypes, testifies
91



THE MYTH OT THE ETERNAL RETURN
to his thirst for the real and his terror of "losing" him
self by letting himself be overwhelmed by the meaningless
ness of profane existence.
It matters little if the formulas and images through
which the primitive expresses "reality" seem childish and even absurd to us. It is the profound meaning of primitive
behavior that is revelatory; this behavior is governed by
belief in an absolute reality opposed to the profane world
of "unrealities"; in the last analysis, the latter does not
constitute a "world," properly speaking; it is the "unreal"
par excelknce^ the uncreated, the nonexistent: the void.
Hence we are justified in speaking of an archaic ontol
ogy, and it is only by taking this ontology into consider
ation that we can succeed in understanding and hence in
not scornfully dismissing even the most extravagant behavior on the part of the primitive world; in fact, this behavior corresponds to a desperate effort not to lose con
tact with being.



CHAPTER THREE
MISFORTUNE AND HISTORY
Normality of Suffering History Regarded as
Theophany Comic Cycles and History
Destiny and History






Normality of Suffering
WITH this chapter, we hope to approach human life
and historical existence from a new point of view.
Archaic man, as has been shown, tends to set himself in
opposition, by every means in his power, to history, regarded as a succession of events that are irreversible,
unforeseeable, possessed of autonomous value. He re
fuses to accept it and to grant it value as such, as history
without, however, always being able to exorcise it; for
example, he is powerless against cosmic catastrophes, mili
tary disasters, social injustices bound up with the very
structure of society, personal misfortunes, and so forth. Thus it would be interesting to learn how this "history" was tolerated by archaic man; that is, how he endured the
calamities, the mishaps, and the "sufferings
" that entered
into the lot of each individual and each collectivity.
What does living mean for a man who belongs to a
traditional culture? Above all, it means living in accordance with extrahuman models, in conformity with arche
types. Hence it means living at the heart of the real since
as Chapter I sufficiently emphasized there is nothing truly real except the archetypes. Living in conformity with the archetypes amounted to respecting the "law/' since
the law was only a primordial hierophany, the revelation in illo tempore of the norms of existence, a disclosure by a
divinity or a mystical being. And if, through the repetition
of paradigmatic gestures and by means of periodic cere
monies, archaic man succeeded, as we have seen, in annul
ing time, he none the less lived in harmony with the cosmic
rhythms; we could even say that he entered into these
rhythms (we need only remember how "real" night and
day are to him, and the seasons, the cycles of the moon,
the solstices). 95



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
In the frame of such an existence, what could suffering
and pain signify? Certainly not a meaningless experience that man can only "tolerate" insofar as it is inevitable, as,
for example, he tolerates the rigors of climate. Whatever
its nature and whatever its apparent cause, his suffering
had a meaning; It corresponded, if not always to a proto
type, at least to an order whose value was not contested.
It has been said that one of the great superiorities of
Christianity, compared with the old Mediterranean ethics,
was that it gave value to suffering: transforming pain from
a negative condition to an experience with a positive
spiritual content. The assertion is valid insofar as it refers
to a giving of value to suffering and even to a seeking out
of pain for its salutary qualities. But if pre-Christian hu
manity did not seek out suffering and did not grant value
to it (with a few rare exceptions) as an instrument of
purification and spiritual ascent, it never regarded it as
without meaning. Of course, we here refer to suffering as an
event, as a historical fact, to suffering brought on by a
cosmic catastrophe (drought, flood, storm), by an invasion
(incendiarism, slavery, humiliation), by social injustices, and so on.
If it was possible to tolerate such sufferings, it is precisely because they seemed neither gratuitous nor arbi
trary. It would be superfluous to cite examples; they are
to be found everywhere. The primitive who sees his field laid waste by drought, his cattle decimated by disease, his
child ill, himself attacked by fever or too frequently un
lucky as a hunter, knows that all these contingencies are
not due to chance but to certain magical or demonic in
fluences, against which the priest or sorcerer possesses weapons. Hence he does as the community does in the
case of a catastrophe; he turns to the sorcerer to do away
with the magical effect, or to the priest to make the gods 96



MISFORTUNE AND HISTORY
favorable to him. If the intervention of priest or sorcerer
produces no result, the interested parties recollect the
existence of the Supreme Being, who is almost forgotten
at other times, and pray to him by offering sacrifices.
"Thou who art above, take not my child; he is too young/*
pray the nomadic Selk'nam of Tierra del Fuego. "O,
Tsuni-Goam!" the Hottentots wail, "Thou alone knowest
that I am not guilty!" During a storm, the Semang pyg
mies scratch their calves with bamboo knives and scatter
drops of blood in all directions, crying: "Ta Pedn! I am not hardened, I pay for my fault! Accept my debt, I pay
it!" l We must, in passing, emphasize a point which we developed in detail in our Traite d'histoire des religions: in
the cults of the so-called primitive peoples, the celestial
Supreme Beings intervene only as the last resort, when every address to gods, demons, and sorcerers, to the end
of banishing a suffering (drought, excessive rains, calam
ity, illness, etc.), has failed. On such an occasion, the
Semang pygmies confess the faults of which they believe
themselves guilty, a custom which we find sporadically
among other peoples, always as an accompaniment to the last recourse to escape from suffering.
Meanwhile, every moment of the magico-religious treat
ment of suffering most clearly illustrates its meaning: suf
fering proceeds from the magical action of an enemy, from breaking a taboo, from entering a baneful zone, from the
anger of a god, or when all other hypotheses have proven insufficient from the will or the wrath of the Supreme
Being. The primitive and not the primitive alone, as we shall see in a moment cannot conceive of an unprovoked
suffering; 2 it arises from a personal fault (if he is con

even today in the peasant civilizations of Europe.

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
vinced that it is a religious fault) or from his neighbor's malevolence (in cases where the sorcerer discovers that
magical action is involved); but there is always a fault at
the bottom of it, or at the very least a cause, recognized
in the will of the forgotten Supreme God, to whom man is finally forced to address himself. In each case, the suffering
becomes intelligible and hence tolerable. Against this suf
fering, the primitive struggles with all the magico-religious means available to him but he tolerates it morally be
cause it is not absurd. The critical moment of the suffering
lies in its appearance; suffering is perturbing only insofar as its cause remains undiscovered. As soon as the sorcerer
or the priest discovers what is causing children or animals
to die, drought to continue, rain to increase, game to dis
appear, the suffering begins to become tolerable; it has a meaning and a cause, hence it can be fitted into a system
and explained.
What we have just said of the primitive applies in large
measure to the man of the archaic cultures. Naturally, the
motifs that yield a justification for suffering and pain vary
from people to people, but the justification is found everywhere. In general, it may be said that suffering is regarded as the consequence of a deviation in respect to the "norm/ 1
That this norm differs from people to people, and from
civilization to civilization, goes without saying. But the important point for us is that nowhere within the frame
of the archaic civilizations are suffering and pain regarded
as "blind" and without meaning. Thus the Indians quite early elaborated a conception of universal causality, the karma concept, which accounts for
the actual events and sufferings of the individual's life and
at the same time explains the necessity for transmigrations. In the light of the law of karma, sufferings not only
find a meaning but also acquire a positive value. The suf98



MISFORTUNE AND HISTORY
ferings of one's present life are not only deserved since
they are in fact the fatal effect of crimes and faults com
mitted in previous lives they are also welcome, for it is
only in this way that it is possible to absorb and liquidate part of the karmic debt that burdens the individual and
determines the cycle of his future existences. According
to the Indian conception, every man is bom with a debt, but with freedom to contract new debts. His existence
forms a long series of payments and borrowings, the ac
count of which is not always obvious. A man not totally
devoid of intelligence can serenely tolerate the sufferings, griefs, and blows that come to him, the injustices of which he is the object, because each of them solves a karmic equation that had remained unsolved in some previous
existence. Naturally, Indian speculation very early sought
and discovered means through which man can free himself
from this endless chain of cause-effect-cause, and so on, determined by the law of karma. But such solutions do
nothing to invalidate the meaning of suffering; on the contrary, they strengthen it. Like Yoga, Buddhism sets out from the principle that all existence is pain, and it
offers the possibility of a concrete and final way of escape
from this unbroken succession of sufferings to which, in
the last analysis, every human life can be reduced. But
Buddhism, like Yoga, and indeed like every other Indian
method of winning liberation, never for a moment casts
any doubt upon the "normality" of pain. As to Vedanta, for it suffering is "illusory" only insofar as the whole
universe is illusory; neither the human experience of suf
fering nor the universe is a reality in the ontological sense
of the word. With the exception constituted by the mate
rialistic Lokayata and Charvaka schools for which neither the "soul" nor "God" exists and which consider avoiding
pain and seeking pleasure the only rational end that man 99



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
can set himself all India has accorded to sufferings, what
ever their nature (cosmic, psychological, or historical), a clearly defined meaning and function. Karma ensures that
everything happening in the world takes place in conformity with the immutable law of cause and effect. If the archaic world nowhere presents us with a formula
as explicit as that of karma to explain the normality of suffering, we do everywhere find in it an equal tendency to grant suffering and historical events a "normal mean
ing/* To treat all the expressions of this tendency here is
out of the question. Almost everywhere we come upon the
archaic concept (predominant among primitives) according to which suffering is to be imputed to the divine will,
whether as directly intervening to produce it or as permitting other forces, demonic or divine, to provoke it. The destruction of a harvest, drought, the sack of a city by an
enemy, loss of freedom or life, any calamity (epidemic, earthquake, and so on) there is nothing that does not, in
one way or another, find its explanation and justification in the transcendent, in the divine economy. Whether the
god of the conquered city was less powerful than the god of the victorious army; whether a ritual fault, on the part
of the entire community or merely on that of a single
family, was committed in respect to one divinity or an
other; whether spells, demons, negligences, curses are involved an individual or a collective suffering always has
its explanation. AncJ, consequently, it is, it can be, tolerable.
Nor is this all. In the Mediterranean-Mesopotamian area, man's sufferings were early connected with those of
a god. To do so was to endow them with an archetype
that gave them both reality and normality. The very ancient myth of the suffering, death, and resurrection of
Tammuz has replicas and imitations almost throughout the
Paleo-Oriental world, and traces of its scenario were pre
100



MISFORTUNE AND HISTORY
served even down to post-Christian gnosticism. This is
not the place to enter into the cosmologico-agricultural
origins and the eschatological structure of Tarnmuz. We shall confine ourselves to a reminder that the sufferings
and resurrection of Tammuz also provided a model for the
sufferings of other divinities ( Marduk, for example) and
doubtless were mimed (hence repeated) each year by the
king. The popular lamentations and rejoicings that com
memorated the sufferings, death, and resurrection of Tam
muz, or of any other cosmico-agrarian divinity, produced, in the consciousness of the East, a repercussion whose
extent has been badly underestimated. For it was not a
question merely of a presentiment of the resurrection that will follow death, but also, and no less, of the consoling
power of Tammuz' sufferings for each individual. Any suf
fering could be tolerated if the drama of Tammuz was remembered.
For this mythical drama reminded men that suffering is
never final; that death is always followed by resurrection; that every defeat is annulled and transcended by the final
victory. The analogy between these myths and the lunar
drama outlined in the preceding chapter is obvious. What
we wish to emphasize at this point is that Tammuz, or any other variant of the same archetype, justifies in other words, renders tolerable the sufferings of the 'just/'
The god as so often the "just/' the "innocent" suffered
without being guilty. He was humiliated, flogged till the
lash drew blood, imprisoned in a "pit," that is, in hell. Here it was that the Great Goddess (or, in the later,
gnostic versions, a "messenger") visited him, encouraged him, and revived him. This consoling myth of the god's
sufferings was long in fading from the consciousness of the
peoples of the East. Professor Widengren, for instance, believes that it is among the Manichaean and Mandaean
101



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
prototypes/ though of course with the inevitable changes
and new valences that it acquired during the period of Greco-Oriental syncretism. In any case, one fact forces it
self upon our attention: such mythological scenarios pre
sent an extremely archaic structure, which derives if not
"historically," at least morphologically from lunar myths
whose antiquity we have no reason to question. We have observed that lunar myths afforded an optimistic view of
life in general; everything takes place cyclically, death is inevitably followed by resurrection, cataclysm by a new
Creation. The paradigmatic myth of Tammuz (also ex
tended to other Mesopotamian divinities) offers us a new
ratification of this same optimism: it is not only the indi
vidual's death that is "saved"; the same is true of his suf
ferings. At least the gnostic, Mandaean, and Manichaean
echoes of the Tammuz myth suggest this. For these sects, roan as such must bear the lot that once fell to Tammuz;
fallen into the pit, slave to the Prince of Darkness, man is
awakened by a messenger who brings him the good tidings of his imminent salvation, of his "liberation." Lacking
though we are in documents that would allow us to extend the same conclusions to Tammuz, we are nevertheless inclined to believe that his drama was not looked upon as
foreign to the human drama. Hence the great popular suc
cess of rites connected with the so-called vegetation di
vinities.
History Regarded as Theophany

regarded as a punishment inflicted by Yahweh, angered by the orgy of sin to which the chosen people had aban

doned themselves. No military disaster seemed absurd, no
suffering was vain, for, beyond the "event/' it was always possible to perceive the will of Yahweh. Even more: these
catastrophes were, we may say, necessary, they were fore
seen by God so that the Jewish people should not contra
vene its true destiny by alienating the religious heritage left by Moses. Indeed, each time that history gave them
the opportunity, each time that they enjoyed a period of comparative peace and economic prosperity, the Hebrews
turned from Yahweh and to the Baals and Astartes of their
neighbors. Only historical catastrophes brought them back to the right road by forcing them to look toward the true
God. Then "they cried unto the Lord, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand
of our enemies, and we will serve thee" (I Samuel 12 : 10). This return to the true God in the hour of disaster reminds
us of the desperate gesture of the primitive, who, to rediscover the existence of the Supreme Being, requires the
extreme of peril and the failure of all addresses to other
divine forms (gods, ancestors, demons). Yet the Hebrews,
from the moment the great military Assyro-Babylonian empires appeared on their historical horizon, lived constantly under the threat proclaimed by Yahweh: "But if
ye will not obey the voice of the Lord, but rebel against the commandment of the Lord, then shall the hand of the
Lord be against you, as it was against your fathers" (I Samuel 12 : 15).
Through their terrifying visions, the prophets but confirmed and amplified Yahweh's ineluctable chastisement
upon His people who had not kept the faith. And it is only
insofar as such prophecies were ratified by catastrophes
(as, indeed, was the case from Elijah to Jeremiah) that
historical events acquired religious significance; i.e., that 103



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
they clearly appeared as punishments inflicted by the Lord in return for the impiousness of Israel. Because of the
prophets, who interpreted contemporary events in the light of a strict faith, these events were transformed into "nega
tive theophanies," into Yahweh's "wrath." Thus they not
only acquired a meaning (because, as we have seen, for the
entire Oriental world, every historical event had its own signification) but they also revealed their hidden coherence
by proving to be the concrete expression of the same single divine will. Thus, for the first time, the prophets placed a value on history, succeeded in transcending the traditional
vision of the cycle (the conception that ensures all things will be repeated forever) , and discovered a one-way time.
This discovery was not to be immediately and fully accepted by the consciousness of the entire Jewish people,
and the ancient conceptions were still long to survive.
But, for the first time, we find affirmed, and increasingly accepted, the idea that historical events have a value in
themselves, insofar as they are determined by the will of
God. This God of the Jewish people is no longer an
Oriental divinity, creator of archetypal gestures, but a per
sonality who ceaselessly intervenes in history, who reveals
his will through events (invasions, sieges, battles, and so on). Historical facts thus become "situations" of man in
respect to God, and as such they acquire a religious value that nothing had previously been able to confer on them. It may, then, be said with truth that the Hebrews were the
first to discover the meaning of history as the epiphany of
God, and this conception, as we should expect, was taken
up and amplified by Christianity.
We may even ask ourselves if monotheism, based upon
the direct and personal revelation of the divinity, does not
necessarily entail the "salvation" of time, its value within
the frame of history. Doubtless the idea of revelation is 104



MISFORTUNE AN0 HISTORY
found, In more or less perspicuous form, in all religions,
we could even say in all cultures. In fact (the reader may
refer to Chapter I), the archetypal gestures finally reproduced in endless succession by man were at the same
time hierophanies or theophanies. The first dance, the first
duel, the first fishing expedition, like the first marriage ceremony or the first ritual, became examples for humanity
because they revealed a mode of existence of the divinity,
of the primordial man, of the civilizing Hero. But these revelations occurred in mythical time, at the extratemporal
instant of the beginning; thus, as we saw in Chapter I, everything in a certain sense coincided with the beginning
of the world, with the cosmogony. Everything had taken place and had been revealed at that moment, in illo tempore:
the creation of the world, and that of man, and man's es
tablishment in the situation provided for him in the cos
mos, down to the least details of that situation (physiology,
sociology, culture, and so on). The situation is altogether different in the case of the
monotheistic revelation. This takes place in time, in his
torical duration: Moses receives the Law at a certain place
and at a certain date. Of course, here too archetypes are
involved, in the sense that these events, raised to the rank
of examples, will be repeated; but they will not be re
peated until the times are accomplished, that is, in a new
illud tempus. For example, as Isaiah (ll : 15-16) prophesies, the miraculous passages of the Red Sea and the Jordan
will be repeated "in the day." Nevertheless, the moment of the revelation made to Moses by God remains a limited
moment, definitely situated in time. And, since it also
represents a theophany, it thus acquires a new dimension: it becomes precious inasmuch as it is no longer reversible, as it is historical event.
Yet Messianisrn hardly succeeds in accomplishing the
105



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
eschatological valorization of time: the future will regen
erate time; that is, will restore its original purity and
integrity. Thus, in illo tempore is situated not only at the
beginning of time but also at its end. 4 In these spacious
Messianic visions it is also easy to discern the very old
scenario of annual regeneration of the cosmos by repetition of the Creation and by the drama of the suffering king. The Messiah on a higher plane, of course assumes the
eschatological role of the king as god, or as representing the divinity on earth, whose chief mission was the periodi
cal regeneration of all nature. His sufferings recalled those
of the king, but, as in the ancient scenarios, the victory
was always finally the king's. The only difference is that this victory over the forces of darkness and chaos no longer
occurs regularly every year but is projected into a future and Messianic illud tempus.
Under the "pressure of history" and supported by the
prophetic and Messianic experience, a new interpretation of historical events dawns among the children of Israel.
Without finally renouncing the traditional concept of ar
chetypes and repetitions, Israel attempts to "save" historical events by regarding them as active presences of
Yahweh. Whereas, for example, among the Mesopotamian
peoples individual or collective sufferings were tolerated
insofar as they were caused by the conflict between divine and demonic forces, that is, formed a part of the cosmic drama (the Creation being, from time immemorial and
ad infinitumy preceded by chaos and tending to be reab
sorbed in it; a new birth implying, from time immemorial
and ad infinitum, sufferings and passions, etc.), in the Israel of the Messianic prophets, historical events could
be tolerated because, on the one hand, they were willed
4 Cf. G. van der Leeuw, "Urzeit und Endzeit," Eranos-Jahrbuch, XVII (Zurich, 1960), pp. 11-51.
106



MISFORTUNE AND HISTORY
by Yahweh, and, on the other hand, because they were necessary to the final salvation of the chosen people.
Rehandling the old scenarios (type: Tammuz) of the "passion" of a god, Messianism gives them a new value, es
pecially by abolishing their possibility of repetition ad
infinitum. When the Messiah comes, the world will be saved once and for all and history will cease to exist. In
this sense we are justified in speaking not only of an
eschatological granting of value to the future, to "that day," but also of the "salvation" of historical becoming.
History no longer appears as a cycle that repeats itself ad
infinitum, as the primitive peoples represented it (creation, exhaustion, destruction, annual re-creation of the cosmos),
and as it was formulated as we shall see immediately
in theories of Babylonian origin (creation, destruction, creation extending over considerable periods of time: mil
lennia, Great Years, aeons). Directly ordered by the will
of Yahweh, history appears as a series of theophanies, negative or positive, each of which has its intrinsic value.
Certainly, all military defeats can be referred back to an
archetype: Yahweh's wrath. But each of these defeats,
though basically a repetition of the same archetype, nevertheless acquires a coefficient of irreversibility: Yahweh's
personal intervention. The fall of Samaria, for example,
though assimilable to that of Jerusalem, yet differs from
it in the fact that it was provoked by a new gesture on the
part of Yahweh, by a new intervention of the Lord in
history. But it must not be forgotten that these Messianic con
ceptions are the exclusive creation of a religious elite. For
many centuries, this elite undertook the religious educa
tion of the people of Israel, without always being success
ful in eradicating the traditional Paleo-Oriental granting
of value to life and history. The Hebrews' periodic returns
107



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
to the Baals and Astartes are also largely to be explained
by their refusal to allow a value to history, that is, to
regard it as a theophany. For the popular strata, and es
pecially for the agrarian communities, the old religious
concept (that of the Baals and Astartes) was preferable; it kept them closer to "life" and helped them to tolerate
history if not to ignore it. The Messianic prophets' stead
fast will to look history in the face and to accept it as a
terrifying dialogue with Yahweh, their will to make mili
tary defeats bear moral and religious fruit and to tolerate
them because they were regarded as necessary to Yahweh's
reconciliation with the people of Israel and its final salva
tion their will, again, to regard any and every moment as a decisive moment and hence to give it worth religiously
demanded too great a religious tension, and the majority of the Israelites refused to submit to it,5 just as the ma
jority of Christians, and especially the popular elements, refuse to live the genuine life of Christianity. It was more
consoling, and easier, in misfortunes and times of trial, to
go on accusing an "accident" (e.g., a spell) or a "negligence" (e.g., a ritual fault) that could easily be made good by a sacrifice (even though it were the sacrifice of infants
to Moloch). In this respect, the classic example of Abraham's sacri
fice admirably illustrates the difference between the tradi
tional conception of the repetition of an archetypal gesture
5 Without religious elites, and more especially without the prophets, Judaism
would not have become anything very different from the religion of the Jewish colony in Elephantine, which preserved the popular Palestinian religious view
point down to the fifth century B.C.; cf. Albert Vincent, La Religion des Judto
Arameens d' l$phantine (Paris* 1937). History had allowed these Hebrews of the
Diaspora to retain, side by side with Yahweh (Jaho), other divinities (Bethel, Harambethel, Ashumbethel), and even the goddess Anath, in a convenient syn
cretism. This is one more confirmation of the importance of history in the development of Judaic religious experience and its maintenance under high tensions.
For, as we must not forget, the institutions of prophecy and Messianism were
above all validated by the pressure of contemporary history.
108



MISFORTUNE AND HISTORY
and the new dimension, faith, acquired through religious experience. 6 Morphologically considered, Abraham's sac
rifice is nothing but the sacrifice of the first born, a frequent
practice in this Paleo-Oriental world in which the Hebrews
evolved down to the period of the prophets. The first child
was often regarded as the child of a god; indeed, through
out the archaic East, unmarried girls customarily spent a night in the temple and thus conceived by the god ( by his
representative, the priest, or by his envoy, the *
'stranger* *). The sacrifice of this first child restored to the divinity
what belonged to him. Thus the young blood increased
the exhausted energy of the god (for the so-called fertility
gods exhausted their own substance in the effort expended
in maintaining the world and ensuring it abundance; hence
they themselves needed to be periodically regenerated). And, in a certain sense, Isaac was a son of God, since he had been given to Abraham and Sarah when Sarah had
long passed the age of fertility. But Isaac was given them through their faith; he was the son of the promise and of
faith. His sacrifice by Abraham, although in form it resembles all the sacrifices of newborn infants in the Paleo
Semitic world, differs from them fundamentally in content.
Whereas, for the entire Paleo-Semitic world, such a sacri
fice, despite its religious function, was only a custom, a
rite whose meaning was perfectly intelligible, in Abra
ham's case it is an act of faith. He does not understand why
the sacrifice is demanded of him; nevertheless he per
forms it because it was the Lord who demanded it. By
this act, which is apparently absurd, Abraham initiates a
6 It may be of some service to point out that what is called "faith" in the Judaeo
Christian sense differs, regarded structurally, from other archaic religious experi
ences. The authenticity and religious validity of these latter must not be doubted,
because they are based upon a universally verified dialectic of the sacred. But the
experience of faith is due to a new theophany, a new revelation, which, for the
respective elites, annuls the validity of other hierophanies. On this subject, see our Zraitf d'histotre des religions^ Ch. I.
109



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
new religious experience, faith. All others (the whole
Oriental world) continue to move in an economy of the
sacred that will be transcended by Abraham and his suc
cessors. To employ Kierkegaard's terminology, their sac
rifices belonged to the "general"; that is, they were based
upon archaic theophanies that were concerned only with
the circulation of sacred energy in the cosmos (from the
divinity to man and nature, then from man through sac
rifice t^k to the divinity, and so on). These were acts
whose justification lay in themselves; they entered into a
logical and coherent system: what had belonged to God
must be returned to him. For Abraham, Isaac was a gift from the Lord and not the product of a direct and material
conception. Between God and Abraham yawned an abyss; there was a fundamental break in continuity. Abraham's
religious act inaugurates a new religious dimension: God reveals himself as personal, as a "totally distinct" exist
ence that ordains, bestows, demands, without any rational
(i.e., general and foreseeable) justification, and for which
all is possible. This new religious dimension renders
"faith" possible in the Judaeo-Christian sense.
We have cited this example in order to illuminate the
novelty of the Jewish religion in comparison with the traditional structures. Just as Abraham's experience can be
regarded as a new religious position of man in the cosmos, so, through the prophetic office and Messianism, historical events reveal themselves, in the consciousness of the
Israelitic elites, as a dimension they had not previously
known: the historical event becomes a theophany, in which
are revealed not only Yahweh's will but also the persona]
relations between him and his people. The same concep
tion, enriched through the elaboration of Chris tology, will
serve as the basis for the philosophy of history that
Christianity, from St. Augustine on, will labor to con110



MISFORTUNE AND HISTORY
struct. But let us repeat: neither in Christianity nor in Judaism does the discovery of this new dimension in re
ligious experience, faith, produce a basic modification of
traditional conceptions. Faith is merely made possible for each individual Christian. The great majority of so-called
Christian populations continue, down to our day, to preserve themselves from history by ignoring it and by toler
ating it rather than by giving it the meaning of a negative
or positive theophany. 7 However, the acceptance and consecration of history by
the Judaic elites does not mean that the traditional atti
tude, which we examined in the preceding chapter, is transcended. Messianic beliefs in a final regeneration of the
world themselves also indicate an antihistoric attitude.
Since he can no longer ignore or periodically abolish history, the Hebrew tolerates it in the hope that it will
finally end, at some more or less distant future moment.
The irreversibility of historical events and of time is
compensated by the limitation of history to time. In the
spiritual horizon of Messianism, resistance to history appears as still more determined than in the traditional hori
zon of archetypes and repetitions; if, here, history was re
fused, ignored, or abolished by the periodic repetition of the Creation and by the periodic regeneration of time, in the Messianic conception history must be tolerated be
cause it has an eschatological function, but it can be tolerated only because it is known that, one day or another,
it will cease. History is thus abolished, not through con
sciousness of living an eternal present (coincidence with the atemporal instant of the revelation of archetypes) , nor
by means of a periodically repeated ritual (for example, the rites for the beginning of the year) it is abolished in the
'This does not imply that these populations (which are for the most part
agrarian in structure) are nonreligious; it implies only the "traditional" (arche

future. Periodic regeneration of the Creation is replaced
by a single regeneration that will take place in an in Ufa
tempore to come. But the will to put a final and definitive
end to history is itself still an antihistorical attitude, ex
actly as are the other traditional conceptions.
Cosmic Cycles and History
THE MEANING acquired by history in the frame of the
various archaic civilizations is nowhere more clearly re
vealed than in the theories of the great cosmic cycles, which
we mentioned in passing in the preceding chapter. We must return to these theories, for it is here that two dis
tinct orientations first define themselves: the one tradi
tional, adumbrated (without ever having been clearly
formulated) in all primitive cultures, that of cyclical time,
periodically regenerating itself ad injinitum; the other modem, that of finite time, a fragment (though itself also cyclical) between two atemporal eternities.
Almost all these theories of the "Great Time" are
found in conjunction with the myth of successive ages, the
"age of gold" always occurring at the beginning of the cycle, close to the paradigmatic illud tempus. In the two doctrines that of cyclical time, and that of limited cyclical
time this age of gold is recoverable; in other words, it is repeatable, an infinite number of times in the former doc
trine, once only in the latter. We do not mention these
facts for their intrinsic interest, great as it is, but to clarify
the meaning of history from the point of view of either
doctrine. We shall begin with the Indian tradition, for
it is here that the myth of the eternal return has received
its boldest formulation. Belief in the periodic destruction
and creation of the universe is already found in the



MISFORTUNE AND HISTORY
Atharva-Veda (X, 8, 39-40). The preservation of similar ideas in the Germanic tradition (universal conflagration,
Ragnarok, followed by a new creation) confirms the IndoAryan structure of the myth, which can therefore be con
sidered one of the numerous variants of the archetype
examined in the preceding chapter. (Possible Oriental influences upon Germanic mythology do not necessarily destroy the authenticity and autochthonous character of the
Ragnarok myth. It would, besides, be difficult to explain why the Indo-Aryans did not also share, from the period
of their common prehistory, the conception of time held
by all primitives.) Indian speculation, however, amplifies and orchestrates the rhythms that govern the periodicity of cosmic creations
and destructions. The smallest unit of measure of the cycle
is the yuga, the "age/' A yuga is preceded and followed by a "dawn" and a "twilight" that connect the ages to
gether. A complete cycle, or Mahayuga, is composed of four ages of unequal duration, the longest appearing at the beginning of the cycle and the shortest at its end. Thus
the first age, the Krta Yuga, lasts 4,000 years, plus 400
years of dawn and as many of twilight; then come the
Treta Yuga of 3,000 years, Dvapara Yuga of ,000 years, and Kali Yuga of 1,000 years (plus, of course, their corresponding dawns and twilights). Hence a Mahayuga lasts 12,000 years (Manu, I, 69 IF.; Mahabharata, III, 1,86).
To the progressive decrease in duration of each new yuga,
there corresponds, on the human plane, a decrease in the
length of life, accompanied by a corruption in morals and a decline in intelligence. This continuous decadence upon
all planes biological, intellectual, ethical, social, and so on assumes particular emphasis in the Puranic texts (cf,
for example Vayu Puraqa, I, 8; Visqu Purd%a, VI, 3).
Transition from one yuga to the next takes place, as we

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
have seen, during a twilight, which marks a decrescendo
within the yuga itself, each yuga ending by a phase of darkness. As the end of the cycle, that is, the fourth and
last yuga, is approached, the darkness deepens. The Kali
Yuga, that in which we are today, is, moreover, considered
to be the "age of darkness/' The complete cycle is termi
nated by a "dissolution/' a Pralaya, which is repeated
more intensively (Mahapralaya, the "great dissolution") at the end of the thousandth cycle.
H. Jacobi 8 rightly believes that, in the original doctrine,
a yuga was equivalent to a complete cycle, comprising the birth, "wear," and destruction of the universe. Such a
doctrine, moreover, was closer to the archetypal myth (lu
nar in structure), which we have studied in our Traite
d'histoire des religions. Later speculation only amplified
and reproduced ad infinitum the primordial rhythm, creation-destruction-creation, by projecting the unit of measure, the yuga, into more and more extensive cycles. The 1,000 years of a Mahayuga were considered "divine
years," each lasting 360 years, which gives a total of
4,320,000 years for a single cosmic cycle. A thousand such Mahayuga constitute a Kalpa; fourteen Kalpa make a
Manvantara. A Kalpa is equivalent to a day in the life of
Brahma; another Kalpa to a night. A hundred "years" of Brahma constitute his life. But even this duration of the
life of Brahma does not succeed in exhausting time, for the
gods are not eternal and the cosmic creations and destruc
tions succeed one another ad infinitum. (Other systems of
calculation even increase the corresponding durations.)

is the cyclical character of cosmic time. In fact, we are
confronted with the infinite repetition of the same phe
nomenon (creation-destruction-new creation), adumbrated in each yuga (dawn and twilight) but completely realized by a Mahayuga. The life of Brahma thus comprises ,560,
000 of these Mahayuga, each repeating the same phases (Krta, Treta, Dvapara, Kali) and ending with a Pralaya, a Ragnarok ("final" destruction, in the sense of a retro
gression of all forms to an amorphous mass, occurring at the end of each Kalpa at the time of the Mahapralaya). In
addition to the metaphysical depreciation of history which, in proportion to and by the mere fact of its duration, provokes an erosion of all forms by exhausting their
ontologic substance and in addition to the myth of the
perfection of the beginnings, which we also find here once
again, what deserves our attention in this orgy of figures
is the eternal repetition of the fundamental rhythm of the
cosmos: its periodic destruction and re-creation. From this
cycle without beginning or end, man can wrest himself
only by an act of spiritual freedom (for all Indian soterio
logical solutions can be reduced to preliminary liberation
from the cosmic illusion and to spiritual freedom).
The two great heterodoxies, Buddhism and Jainism, ac
cept the same pan-Indian doctrine of cyclical time, at least in its chief outlines, and compare it to a wheel with twelve
spokes (this image is already employed in Vedic texts; cf. Atharva-Veda, X, 8, 4; Rg-Veda, I, 164, 115; etc.). As its unit of measure for the cosmic cycles, Buddhism

ber of "incalculables" (asarfikhyeya, Pali: asaqkheyya). Pali
sources generally speak of four asaqkheyya and a hundred
thousand kappa (cf., for example, Jataka, I, 2); in Mahayanic literature, the number of incalculables varies be
tween 3, 7, and 33, and they are connected with the
career of the Bodhisattva in the various cosmoses. 10 In the
Buddhist tradition, the progressive decadence of man is marked by a continuous decrease in the length of human
life. Thus, according to Dlgha-nikaya, II, -7, at the time of the first Buddha, Vipassi, who made his appearance 91 kappa ago, the length of a human life was 80,000 years; at
that of the second Buddha, Sikhi (31 kappa ago), it was
70,000 years, and so on. The seventh Buddha, Gautama,
appears when a human life is only 100 years, i.e., has been reduced to the utmost. (We shall encounter the same motif
again in Iranian and Christian apocalypses.) Nevertheless, for Buddhism, as for all Indian speculation, time is limit
less; and the Bodhisattva will become incarnate to an
nounce the good tidings of salvation to all beings, in
aeternum. The only possibility of escaping from time, of breaking the iron circle of existences, is to abolish the
human condition and win Nirvana. 11 Besides, all these
"incalculables*' and all these numberless aeons also have a
soteriological function; simply contemplating the panorama of them terrifies man and forces him to realize that

he must begin this same transitory existence and endure
the same endless sufferings over again, millions upon mil
lions of times; this results in intensifying his will to escape,
that is, in impelling him to transcend his condition of
"living being/' once and for all.
Indian speculations on cyclical time reveal a sufficiently marked "refusal of history." But we must emphasize an
aspect in which they differ fundamentally from archaic con
ceptions; whereas the man of the traditional cultures re
fuses history through the periodic abolition of the Creation, thus living over and over again in the atemporal instant
of the beginnings, the Indian spirit, in its supreme tensions, disparages and even rejects this same reactualization
of auroral time, which it no longer regards as an effective
solution to the problem of suffering. The difference be
tween the Vedic (hence archaic and primitive) vision and
the Mahayanic vision of the cosmic cycle is, in sum, the
very difference that distinguishes the archetypal (tradi
tional) anthropological position from the existentialist
(historical) position. Karma, the law of universal causality, which by justifying the human condition and accounting
for historical experience could be a source of consolation
to the pre-Buddhistic Indian consciousness, becomes, in time, the very symbol of man's "slavery." Hence it is that
every Indian metaphysics and technique, insofar as it proposes man's liberation, seeks the annihilation of karma.
But if the doctrines of the cosmic cycles had been only an
illustration of the theory of universal causality, we should
not have mentioned them in the present context. The con
ception of the four yuga in fact contributes a new element:
the explanation (and hence the justification) of historical
catastrophes, of the progressive decadence of humanity,
biologically, sociologically, ethically, and spiritually. Time,
by the simple fact that it is duration, continually aggra117



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
vates the condition of the cosmos and, by implication, the
condition of man. By the simple fact that we are now living
in the Kali Yuga, hence in an "age of darkness/' which
progresses under the sign of disaggregation and must end
by a catastrophe, it is our fate to suffer more than the men
of preceding ages. Now, in our historical moment, we can
expect nothing else; at most (and it is here that we
glimpse the soteriological function of the Kali Yuga and
the privileges conferred on us by a crepuscular and cat
astrophic history), we can wrest ourselves from cosmic
servitude. The Indian theory of the four ages is, conse
quently, invigorating and consoling for man under the terror of history. In effect: (l) on the one hand, the suf
ferings that fall to him because he is contemporary with
this crepuscular decomposition help him to understand the precariousness of his human condition and thus facilitate
his enfranchisement; (2) on the other hand, the theory
validates and justifies the sufferings of him who does not choose freedom but resigns himself to undergoing his
existence, and this by the very fact that he is conscious of
the dramatic and catastrophic structure of the epoch in
which it has been given him to live (or, more precisely, to
live again).
This second possibility for man to find his place in a
"period of darkness," the close of a cycle, is of especial interest to us. It occurs, in fact, in other cultures and at other historical moments. To bear the burden of being
contemporary with a disastrous period by becoming conscious of the position it occupies in the descending trajectory of the cosmic cycle is an attitude that was especially to
demonstrate its effectiveness in the twilight of Greco
Oriental civilization.
We need not here concern ourselves with the many
problems raised by the Orientalo-Hellenistic civilizations.
118



MISFORTUNE AND HISTORY
The only aspect that interests us is the place the man of
these civilizations finds for himself in respect to history,
and more especially as he confronts contemporary history.
It is for this reason that we shall not linger over the
origin, structure, and evolution of the various cosmological
systems in which the antique myth of the cosmic cycles is elaborated and explored, nor over their philosophical con
sequences. We shall review these cosmological systems from the pre-Socratics to the Neo-Pythagoreans only in
sofar as they answer the following question: What is the
meaning of history, that is, of the totality of the human
experiences provoked by inevitable geographical condi
tions, social structures, political conjunctures, and so on? Let us remark at once that this question had meaning only
for a very small minority during the period of the Orientalo-Hellenistic civilizations only for those, that is, who
had become dissociated from the horizon of antique spirit
uality. The immense majority of their contemporaries still
lived, especially at the beginning of the period, under the dominance of archetypes; they emerged from it only very late (and perhaps never for good and all, as, for example, in
the case of agricultural societies) , during the course of the powerful historical tensions that were provoked by Alexander and hardly ended with the fall of Rome. But the
philosophical myths and the more or less scientific cos
mologies elaborated by this minority, which begins with the pre-Socratics, attained in time to very wide dissemi
nation. What, in the fifth century B.C., was a gnosis acces
sible only with difficulty, four centuries later becomes a
doctrine that consoles hundreds of thousands of men (wit
ness, for example, Neo-Pythagoreanism and Neo-Stoicism in the Roman .world). It is, to be sure, through the "success" that they obtained later, and not through their in
trinsic worth, that all these Greek and Greco-Oriental
119



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
doctrines based upon the myth of cosmic cycles are of
interest to us.
This myth was still discernibly present in the earliest
pre-Socratic speculations. Anaximander knows that all
things are bom and return to the apeiron. Empedocles con
ceives of the alternate supremacy of the two opposing prin
ciples philia and neikos as explaining the eternal creations
and destructions of the cosmos (a cycle in which four phases are distinguishable, 12 somewhat after the fashion of the
four "incalculables" of Buddhist doctrine). The universal
conflagration is, as we have seen, also accepted by Heraclitus. As to the eternal return the periodic resumption, by all beings, of their former lives this is one of the few
dogmas of which we know with some certainty that they
formed a part of primitive Pythagoreanism. 13 Finally, according to recent researches, admirably utilized and syn
thesized by Joseph Bidez, 14 it seems increasingly probable that at least certain elements of the Platonic system are of
Irano-Babylonian origin.
We shall return to these possible Oriental influences.
Let us pause for the moment to consider Plato's interpre
tation of the myth of cyclical return, more especially in the fundamental text, which occurs in the Politicus, %69c ff. Plato finds the cause of cosmic regression and cosmic catastrophes in a twofold motion of the universe: ". . . Of
this Universe of ours, the Divinity now guides its circular
revolution entirely, now abandons it to itself, once its
revolutions have attained the duration which befits this
universe; and it then begins to turn in the opposite direc
tion, of its own motion . . ." This change of direction is

accompanied by gigantic cataclysms: "the greatest destruction, both among animals in general and among the
human race, of which, as is fitting, only a few representatives remain'* (270<r). But this catastrophe is followed by a
paradoxical "regeneration." Men begin to grow young again: "the white hair of the aged darkens/* while those
at the age of puberty begin to lessen in stature day by
day, until they return to the size of a new-bom infant; then
finally, "still continuing to waste away, they wholly cease to be/* The bodies of those who died at this time "disap
peared completely, without leaving a trace, after a few days" (27Cte). It was then that the race of the "Sons of
Earth" (gegeneis), whose memory was preserved by our ancestors, was born (2710). During this age of Cronos, there were neither savage animals nor enmity between
animals (271<?). The men of those days had neither wives
nor children: "Upon arising out of the earth, they all returned to life, without preserving any memory of their
former state of life." The trees gave them fruits in abund
ance and they slept naked on the soil, with no need for
beds, because then the seasons were mild (2720).
The myth of the primordial paradise, evoked by Plato,
discernible in Indian beliefs, was known to the Hebrews
(for example, Messianic illud tempus in Isaiah 11 : 6, 8;
65 : 25) as well as to the Iranian ( DSnkart, VII, 9, 3-5} and
Greco-Latin traditions. 15 Moreover, it fits perfectly into
the archaic (and probably universal) conception of "para
disal beginnings," which we find in all valuations of the
primordial illud tempus. That Plato reproduces such traditional visions in the dialogues that date from his old age is
nowise astonishing; the evolution of his philosophical thought itself forced him to rediscover the mythological

categories. The memory of the age of gold under Cronos
was certainly available to him in Greek tradition (cf., for
example, the four ages described by Hesiod, Erga, 1 10 ff.).
This fact, however, constitutes no bar to our recognizing that there are also certain Babylonian influences in the
Politicus; when, for example, Plato imputes periodic cata
clysms to planetary revolutions, an explanation that cer
tain recent researches 16 would derive from Babylonian
astronomical speculations later rendered accessible to the
Hellenic world through Berossus' Babyloniaca. According
to the Timaeus, partial catastrophes are caused by planetary deviation (cf. Timaeus, Q2d and QSe, deluge referred
to by the priest of Sai's), while the moment of the meeting
of all the planets is that of "perfect time" (Timaeus, 39d), that is, of the end of the Great Year. As Joseph Bidez re
marks: "the idea that a conjunction of all the planets
suffices to cause a universal upheaval is certainly of Chaldaean origin/' 17 On the other hand, Plato seems also to
have been familiar with the Iranian conception according to
which the purpose of these catastrophes is the purification of the human race (Timaeus, rf).
The Stoics, for their own purposes, also revived specu
lations concerning the cosmic cycles, emphasizing either
eternal repetition 18 or the cataclysm, ekpyrosis, by which cosmic cycles come to their end. 19 Drawing from Hera
clitus, or directly from Oriental gnosticism, Stoicism propagates all these ideas in regard to the Great Year and to
the cosmic fire (ekpyrosis] that periodically puts an end to the universe in order to renew it. In time, these motifs of
eternal return and of th'e end of the world come to domi

nate the entire Greco-Roman culture. The periodic renewal
of the world (metacosmesis) was, furthermore, a favorite
doctrine of Neo-Pythagoreanism, the philosophy that as Jerome Carcopino has shown, together with Stoicism,
divided the allegiance of Roman society in the second and first centuries B.C. But adherence to the myth of "eternal
repetition," as well as to that of apokatastasis (the term entered the Hellenic world after Alexander the Great) are
both philosophical positions in which we can perceive a very determined antihistorical attitude together with a
will to defend the self from history. We shall discuss both
of these positions.
We observed in the preceding chapter that the myth of
eternal repetition, as reinterpreted by Greek speculation, has the meaning of a supreme attempt toward the "static
ization" of becoming, toward annulling the irreversibility of time. If all moments and all situations of the cosmos are
repeated ad iiifinitum, their evanescence is, in the last
analysis, patent; sub specie infimtatis, all moments and all situations remain stationary and thus acquire the ontological order of the archetype. Hence, among all the forms of
becoming, historical becoming too is saturated with being.
From the point of view of eternal repetition, historical
events are transformed into categories and thus regain the
ontological order they possessed in the horizon of archaic spirituality. In a certain sense it can even be said that the
Greek theory of eternal return is the final variant under
gone by the myth of the repetition of an archetypal gesture, just as the Platonic doctrine of Ideas was the final version
of the archetype concept, and the most fully elaborated. And it is worth noting that these two doctrines found their
most perfect expression at the height of Greek philosophi
cal thought. But it was especially the myth of universal conflagration



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
that achieved a marked success throughout the Greco
Oriental world. It appears more and more probable that the myth of an end of the world by fire, from which the
good will escape unharmed, is of Iranian origin (cfl, for
example, Rundahisn, XXX, 18), at least in the form
known to the "western mages" who, as Cumont has
shown,20 disseminated it in the West. Stoicism, the Sibylline
Oracles (for example II, 53), and Judaeo-Christian literature make this myth the foundation of their apocalypses
and their eschatology. Strange as it may seem, the myth was consoling. In fact, fire renews the world; through it will come the restoration of "a new world, free from old
age, death, decomposition and corruption, living eternally,
increasing eternally, when the dead shall rise, when im
mortality shall come to the living, when the world shall
be perfectly renewed" (Ta5t 9 XIX, 14, 89). 21 This, then,
is an apokatastasis from which the good have nothing to fear. The final catastrophe will put an end to history,
hence will restore man to eternity and beatitude. Notable studies, by both Cumont and H. S. Nyberg,22
have succeeded in illuminating some of the obscurity that
surrounds Iranian eschatology and in defining the influ
ences responsible for the Judaeo-Christian apocalypse. Like India (and, in a certain sense, Greece), Iran knew the
myth of the four cosmic ages. A lost Mazdean text, the

IX, 8), referred to the four ages: gold, silver, steel, and
"mixed with iron." The same metals are mentioned at the
beginning of the Bahman-Tast (I, 3), which, however, somewhat further on (II, 14), describes a cosmic tree with
seven branches (gold, silver, bronze, copper, tin, steel, and a "mixture of iron"), corresponding to the sevenfold
mythical history of the Persians. 23 This cosmic hebdomad
no doubt developed in connection with Chaldaean astrolog
ical teachings, each planet "governing" a millennium. But Mazdaism had much earlier proposed an age of 9,000 years
(3 X 3,000) for the universe, while Zarvanism, as Nyberg
has shown,24 extended the maximum duration of this uni
verse to 1,000 years. In the two Iranian systems as,
moreover, in all doctrines of cosmic cycles the world will
end by fire and water, per pyrosim et catadysmum, as Firmicus Maternus (III, l) was later to write. That in the
Zarvanite system "unlimited time," Zarvan akarana, pre
cedes and follows the 12,000 years of "limited time" cre
ated by Ormazd; that in this system 'Time is more
powerful than the two Creations," 25 that is, than the
creations of Ormazd and Ahriman; that, consequently, Zarvan akarana was not created by Ormazd and hence is
not subordinate to him all these are matters that we need
not enter into here. What we wish to emphasize is that,
in the Iranian conception, history (whether followed or
not by infinite time) is not eternal; it does not repeat
itself but will come to an end one day by an eschatological
ekpyrosis and cosmic cataclysm. For the final catastrophe that will put an end to history will at the same time be a
judgment of history. It is then in ilk tempore that, as we are told, all will render an account of what they have

done "in history" and only those who are not guilty will
know beatitude and eternity. 26
Windisch has shown the importance of these Mazdean
ideas for the Christian apologist Lactantius. 27 God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he rested; hence
the world will endure for six aeons, during which "evil
will conquer and triumph" on earth. During the seventh
millennium, the prince of demons will be chained and hu
manity will know a thousand years of rest and perfect
justice. After this the demon will escape from his chains
and resume war upon the just; but at last he will be vanquished and at the end of the eighth millennium the
world will be re-created for eternity. Obviously, this divi
sion of history into three acts and eight millennia was also
known to the Christian chiliasts,28 but there can be no
doubt that it is Iranian in structure, even if a similar
eschatological vision of history was disseminated through
out the Mediterranean East and in the Roman Empire by Greco-Oriental gnosticisms.
A series of calamities will announce the approach of the
end of the world; and the first of them will be the fall of
Rome and the destruction of the Roman Empire, a frequent
anticipation in the Judaeo-Christian apocalypse, but also not unknown to the Iranians. 29 The apocalyptic syndrome is, furthermore, common to all these traditions. Both Lactantius and the Bahman-Td$t announce that "the
year will be shortened, the month will diminish, and the
day will contract," 30 a vision of cosmic and human de
terioration that we have also found in India (where human
life decreases from 80,000 to 100 years) and that astrologi

cal doctrines popularized in the Greco-Oriental world. Then the mountains will crumble and the earth become
smooth, men will desire death and envy the dead, and but
a tenth of them will survive. "It will be a time," writes
Lactantius, "when justice will be rejected and innocence
odious, when the wicked will prey as enemies upon the
good, when neither law nor order nor military discipline
will be observed, when none will respect gray hairs, or do
the offices of piety, nor take pity upon women and children; all things will be confounded and mixed, against divine and
natural law. . . ." 31 But after this premonitory phase,
the purifying fire will come down to destroy the wicked and will be followed by the millennium of bliss that the
Christian chiliasts also expected and Isaiah and the Sibyl
line Oracles had earlier foretold. Men will know a new
golden age that will last until the end of the seventh
millennium; for after this last conflict, a universal ekpyrosis will absorb the whole universe in fire, thus permitting the
birth of a new world, an eternal world of justice and hap
piness, not subject to astral influences and freed from the dominion of time. The Hebrews likewise limited the duration of the world
to seven millennia,32 but the rabbinate never encouraged mathematical calculations to determine the end of the
world. They confined themselves to stating that a series of
cosmic and historical calamities (famines, droughts, wars, and so forth) would announce the end of the world. The
Messiah would come; the dead would rise again (Isaiah
26 : 19); God would conquer death and the renewal of the
world would follow (Isaiah 65 : 17; Book of Jubilees I : 29,
even speaks of a new Creation). 38

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
Here again, as everywhere in the apocalyptic doctrines
referred to above, we find the traditional motif of extreme
decadence, of the triumph of evil and darkness, which precede the change of aeon and the renewal of the cosmos.

sees the apocalypse: "When such and such things happen in heaven, then will the clear become dull, the pure dirty,
the lands will fall into confusion, prayers will not be heard,
the signs of the prophets will become unfavorable. . . .
Under his [i.e., a prince who does not obey the commands
of the gods] rule the one will devour the other, the people
will sell their children for gold, the husband will desert his
wife, the wife her husband, the mother will bolt the door
against her daughter/' Another hymn foretells that, in those days, the sun will no longer rise, the moon no longer
appear, and so on.
In the Babylonian conception, however, this crepuscular period is always followed by a new paradisal dawn. Fre
quently, as we should expect, the paradisal period opens with the enthronement of a new sovereign. Ashurbanipal
regards himself as a regenerator of the cosmos, for "since the time the gods in their friendliness did set me on the
throne of my fathers, Ramman has sent forth his rain . . .
the harvest was plentiful, the corn was abundant . . . the
cattle multiplied exceedingly/' Nebuchadrezzar says of
himself: "A reign of abundance, years of exuberance in my
country I cause to be." In a Hittite text, Murshilish thus describes the reign of his father: ". . . under him the
whole land of Katti prospered, and in his time people,
cattle, sheep multiplied/' a5 The conception is archaic and

universal: we find it in Homer, in Hesiod, in the Old
Testament, in China, and elsewhere. 36
Simplifying, we might say that, among the Iranians as
among the Jews and Christians, the "history" apportioned to the universe is limited, and that the end of the world
coincides with the destruction of sinners, the resurrection
of the dead, and the victory of eternity over time. But al
though this doctrine becomes increasingly popular during the first century B.C. and the early centuries of our era, it
does not succeed in finally doing away with the traditional
doctrine of periodic regeneration of the world through
annual repetition of the Creation. We saw in the preceding
chapter that vestiges of this latter doctrine were preserved among the Iranians until far into the Middle Ages. Simi
larly dominant in pre-Messianic Judaism, it was never totally eliminated, for rabbinic circles hesitated to be pre
cise as to the duration that God had fixed for the cosmos
and confined themselves to declaring that the illud tempus
would certainly arrive one day. In Christianity, on the other hand, the evangelical tradition itself implies that
/3ao-i\ia rov $eov is already present "among" (oro?)
those who believe, and that hence the illud tempus is eter
nally of the present and accessible to anyone, at any moment, through metanoia. Since what is involved is a re
ligious experience wholly different from the traditional
experience, since what is involved is faith, Christianity translates the periodic regeneration of the world into a
regeneration of the human individual. But for him who
shares in this eternal nunc of the reign of God, history
ceases as totally as it does for the man of the archaic cul
tures, who abolishes it periodically. Consequently, for the

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
Christian too, history can be regenerated, by and through each individual believer, even before the Saviour's second
coming, when it will utterly cease for all Creation.
An adequate discussion of the revolution that Chris
tianity introduced into the dialectic of the abolition of his
tory, and of the escape from the ascendancy of time, would
lead us too far beyond the limits of this essay. Let us simply note that even within the frame of the three great
religious Iranian, Judaic, and Christian that have limited
the duration of the cosmos to some specific number of
millennia and affirm that history will finally cease in illo tempore, there still survive certain traces of the ancient
doctrine of the periodic regeneration of history. In other
words, history can be abolished, and consequently renewed, a number of times, before the final eschaton is
realized. Indeed, the Christian liturgical year is based
upon a periodic and real repetition of the Nativity, Passion, death, and Resurrection of Jesus, with all that this mystical
drama implies for a Christian; that is, personal and cosmic regeneration through reactualization in concrete of the
birth, death, and resurrection of the Saviour.
Destiny and History
WE HAVE referred to all these Hellenistic-Oriental doc
trines relative to cosmic cycles for only one purpose that
of discovering the answer to the question that we posed
at the beginning of this chapter: How has man tolerated
history? The answer is discernible in each individual sys
tem: His very place in the cosmic cycle whether the cycle
be capable of repetition or not lays upon man a certain
historical destiny. We must beware of seeing no more here
than a fatalism, whatever meaning we ascribe to the term,

that would account for the good and bad fortune of each
individual taken separately. These doctrines answer the
questions posed by the destiny of contemporary history in its entirety, not only those posed by the individual destiny.
A certain quantity of suffering is in store for humanity
(and by the word "humanity" each person means the mass
of men known to himself) by the simple fact that humanity finds itself at a certain historical moment, that is, in a
cosmic cycle that is in its descending phase or nearing its end. Individually, each is free to withdraw from this his
torical moment and to console himself for its baneful conse
quences, whether through philosophy or through mysti
cism. (The mere mention of the swarm of gnosticisms,
sects, mysteries, and philosophies that overran the Mediterranean-Oriental world during the centuries of historical
tension will suffice to give an idea of the vastly increasing
proportion of those who attempted to withdraw from his
tory.) The historical moment in its totality, however, could not avoid the destiny that was the inevitable conse
quence of its very position upon the descending trajectory of the cycle to which it belonged. Just as, in the Indian view, every man of the Kali Yuga is stimulated to seek his
freedom and spiritual beatitude, yet at the same time cannot avoid the final dissolution of this crepuscular world in
its entirety, so, in the view of the various systems to
which we have referred, the historical moment, despite the
possibilities of escape it offers contemporaries, can never,
in its entirety, be anything but tragic, pathetic, unjust, chaotic, as any moment that heralds the final catastrophe
must be.
In fact, a common characteristic relates all the cyclical
systems scattered through the Hellenistic-Oriental world:
in the view of each of them, the contemporary historical
moment (whatever its chronological position) represents 131



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
a decadence in relation to preceding historical moments*
Not only is the contemporary aeon inferior to the other
ages (gold, silver, and so on) but, even within the frame
of the reigning age (that is, of the reigning cycle), the
"instant" in which man lives grows worse as time passes. This tendency toward devaluation of the contemporary moment should not be regarded as a sign of pessimism. On the contrary, it reveals an excess of optimism, for, in
the deterioration of the contemporary situation, at least a
portion of mankind saw signs foretelling the regeneration
that must necessarily follow. Since the days of Isaiah, a
series of military defeats and political collapses had been
anxiously awaited as an ineluctable syndrome of the Mes
sianic illud tempus that was to regenerate the world.
However, different as were the possible positions of
man, they displayed one common characteristic: history could be tolerated, not only because it had a meaning but
also because it was, in the last analysis, necessary. For those who believed in a repetition of an entire cosmic
cycle, as for those who believed only in a single cycle
nearing its end, the drama of contemporary history was necessary and inevitable. Plato, even in his day, and despite his acceptance of some of the schemata of Chaldaean astrol
ogy, was profuse in his sarcasms against those who had
fallen into astrological fatalism or who believed in an
eternal repetition in the strict (Stoic) sense of the term
(cf., for example, Republic, VIII, 546 ff.). As for the
Christian philosophers, they fiercely combated the same astrological fatalism, 87 which had increased during the last
91 Among many other liberations, Christianity effected liberation from astral
destiny: "We are above Fate," Tatian writes (Oratio ad Graecos, 9), summing up
Christian doctrine. **The sun and the moon were made for us; how am I to worship
what are my servitors "
(ibid., 4). Cf. also St. Augustine, De civitate Dei, XII,
Ch. X-XIII; on the ideas of St. Basil, Origen, St. Gregory, and St. Augustine,
and their opposition to cyclical theories, see Pierre Duhem, Le Systems du monde

temps," Eranos-Jahrbuck, XX (Zurich, 1951), pp. 68 ff. 132

centuries of the Roman Empire. As we shall see in a moment, Saint Augustine will defend the idea of a perennial
Rome solely to escape from accepting &/atum determined by cyclical theories. It is, nevertheless, true that astrological fatalism itself accounted for the course of historical
events, and hence helped the contemporary to understand them and tolerate them, just as successfully as did the
various Greco-Oriental gnosticisms, Neo-Stoicism, and
Neo-Pythagoreanism. For example, whether history was governed by the movements of the heavenly bodies or
purely and simply by the cosmic process, which necessarily
demanded a disintegration inevitably linked to an original
integration, whether, again, it was subject to the will of God, a will that the prophets had been able to glimpse, the result was the same: none of the catastrophes manifested in
history was arbitrary. Empires rose and fell; wars caused
innumerable sufferings; immorality, dissoluteness, social injustice, steadily increased because all this was neces
sary, that is, was willed by the cosmic rhythm, by the
demiurge, by the constellations, or by the will of God.
In this view, the history of Rome takes on a noble
gravity. Several times in the course of their history, the Romans underwent the terror of an imminent end to their city, whose duration as they believed had been determined at the very moment of its foundation by Romulus.
In Les Grands Mythes de Rome, Jean Hubaux has pene
tratingly analyzed the critical moments of the drama provoked by the uncertainties in calculations of the "life" of
Rome, while Jerdme Carcopino has recorded the historical
events and the spiritual tension that justified the hope for a noncatastrophic resurrection of the city. 38 At every his
torical crisis two crepuscular myths obsessed the Roman
people: (l) the life of the city is ended, its duration being
limited to a certain number of years (the "mystic number"
88 Jean Hubaux, Les Grands Mythis de Rome (Paris, 1945); Carcopino, op. cit. 133



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
revealed by the twelve eagles seen by Romulus); and
the Great Year will put an end to all history, hence to that
of Rome, by a universal ekpyrosis. Roman history itself
undertook to show the baselessness of these fears, down
to a very late period. For at the end of 10 years after the
foundation of Rome, it was realized that the twelve eagles seen by Romulus did not signify 1 20 years of historical
life for the city, as many had feared. At the end of 365
years, it became apparent that there was no question of a
Great Year, in which each year of the city would be equiva
lent to a day, and it was supposed that destiny had granted Rome another kind of Great Year, composed of twelve
months of 100 years. As for the myth of regressive "ages" and eternal return, professed by the Sibyl and interpreted
by the philosophers through their theories of cosmic cycles,
it was more than once hoped that the transition from one
age to the other could be effected without a universal
ekpyrosis. But this hope was always mingled with anxiety. Each time historical events accentuated their catastrophic rhythm, the Romans believed that the Great Year was on
the point of ending and that Rome was on the eve of her
fall. When Caesar crossed the Rubicon, Nigidius Figulus foresaw the beginning of a cosmico-historical drama which
would put an end to Rome and the human race. 39 But the same Nigidius Figulus believed 40 that an ekpyrosis was not
inevitable, and that a renewal, the Neo-Pythagorean meta
cosmesis, was also possible without a cosmic catastrophe an idea that Virgil was to take up and elaborate.
Horace, in his Epode XVI, had been unable to conceal
his fear as to the future fate of Rome. The Stoics, the
astrologers, and Oriental gnosticism saw in the wars and
calamities of the time signs that the final catastrophe was
99 Lucan, Pkarsalta, 639, 642 *5; Carcopino, p. 147. Ibid., pp. 52 ff.

MISFORTUNE AND HISTORY
imminent. Reasoning either from calculation of the life of
Rome or from the doctrine of cosmico-historical cycles, the
Romans knew that, whatever else might happen, the city
was fated to disappear before the beginning of a new aeon.
But the reign of Augustus, coming after a series of long and sanguinary civil wars, seemed to inaugurate a pax
aeterna. The fears inspired by the two myths the "age"
of Rome and the theory of the Great Year now proved
groundless: "Augustus has founded Rome anew and we
have nothing to fear as to its life," those who had been concerned over the mystery of Romulus' twelve eagles
could assure themselves. "The transition from the age of
iron to the age of gold has been accomplished without an
ekpyrosis
" those who had been obsessed by the theory of
cycles could say. Thus Virgil, for the last saeculurn, that of the sun, which was to bring about the combustion of the
universe, could substitute the saeculum of Apollo, avoiding an ekpyrosis and assuming that the recent wars had them
selves been the sign of the transition from the age of iron
to the age of gold. 41 Later, when Augustus' reign seemed
indeed to have inaugurated the age of gold, Virgil undertook to reassure the Romans as to the duration of the city.
In the Aeneid ( I, 55 ff.) Jupiter, addressing Venus, assures her that he will lay no bounds of space or time upon the Romans: "empire without end have I given them." 42 And
it was not until after the publication of the Aeneid that
Rome was called urbs aeterna, Augustus being proclaimed
the second founder of the city, His birthday, September 23, was regarded "as the point of departure of the Universe, whose existence had been saved, and whose face had been
changed, by Augustus." 43 Then arose the hope that Rome

Hubaux, p. l8ff. 48 Carcopino, p. 200.
135



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
could regenerate itself periodically ad infinitum. Thus it
was that, liberated from the myths of the twelve eagles and
of the ekpyrosis, Rome could increase until, as Virgil fore
tells, it embraced even the regions "beyond the paths of
the sun and the year" ("extra anni solisque vias").
In all this, as we see, there is a supreme effort to liberate
history from astral destiny or from the law of cosmic cycles
and to return, through the myth of the eternal renewal of
Rome, to the archaic myth of the annual (and in particular
the noncatastrophic!) regeneration of the cosmos through its eternal re-creation by the sovereign or the priest. It is
above all an attempt to give value to history on the cosmic
plane; that is, to regard historical events and catastrophes
as genuine cosmic combustions or dissolutions that must
periodically put an end to the universe in order to permit
its regeneration. The wars, the destruction, the sufferings
of history are no longer the premonitory signs of the transition from one age to another, but themselves con
stitute the transition. Thus in each period of peace, history
renews itself and, consequently, a new world begins; in the last analysis ( as we saw in the case of the myth built
up around Augustus), the sovereign repeats the Creation of the cosmos. We have adduced the example of Rome to show how
historical events could be given value by the expedient of
the myths examined in the present chapter. Adapted to a particular myth theory (age of Rome, Great Year), catastrophes could not only be tolerated by their contemporaries but also positively accorded a value immediately after
their appearance. Of course, the age of gold inaugurated by Augustus has survived only through what it created in
Latin culture. Augustus was no sooner dead than history
undertook to belie the age of gold, and once again people
began living in expectation of imminent disaster. When 136



MISFORTUNE AND HISTORY
Rome was occupied by Alaric, it seemed that the sign of Romulus' twelve eagles had triumphed: the city was enter
ing its twelfth and last century of existence. Only Saint
Augustine attempted to show that no one could know the
moment at which God would decide to put an end to his
tory, and that in any case, although cities by their very nature have a limited duration, the only "eternal city"
being that of God, no astral destiny can decide the life or
death of a nation. Thus Christian thought tended to tran
scend, once and for all, the old themes of eternal repetition,
just as it had undertaken to transcend all the other archaic
viewpoints by revealing the importance of the religious experience of faith and that of the value of the human per
sonality.

CHAPTER FOUR
THE TERROR OF HISTORY
Survival of the Myth of Eternal Return The
Difficulties of Historicism Freedom and
History Despair or Faith






Survival of the Myth of Eternal Return
THE problem raised in this final chapter exceeds the
limits that we had assigned to the present essay. Hence
we can only outline it. In short, it would be necessary to
confront "historical man" (modem man), who consciously
and voluntarily creates history, with the man of the tradi
tional civilizations, who, as we have seen, had a negative
attitude toward history. Whether he abolishes it periodi
cally, whether he devaluates it by perpetually finding transhistorical models and archetypes for it, whether,
finally, he gives it a metahistorical meaning (cyclical
theory, eschatological significations, and so on), the man of the traditional civilizations accorded the historical event
no value in itself; in other words, he did not regard it as
a specific category of his own mode of existence. Now, to
compare these two types of humanity implies an analysis of all the modern "historicisms," and such an analysis, to
be really useful, would carry us too far from the principal
theme of this study. We are nevertheless forced to touch
upon the problem of man as consciously and voluntarily historical, because the modern world is, at the present
moment, not entirely converted to historicism; we are even witnessing a conflict between the two views: the archaic
conception, which we should designate as archetypal and
anhistorical; and the modern, post-Hegelian conception,
which seeks to be historical. We shall confine ourselves to
examining only one aspect of the problem, but an important aspect: the solutions offered by the historicistic view
to enable modern man to tolerate the increasingly powerful
pressure of contemporary history.
The foregoing chapters have abundantly illustrated the way in which men of the traditional civilizations tolerated
141



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
history. The reader will remember that they defended
themselves against it, either by periodically abolishing it
through repetition of the cosmogony and a periodic regen
eration of time or by giving historical events a metahistori
cal meaning, a meaning that was not only consoling but was above all coherent, that is, capable of being fitted into a well-consolidated system in which the cosmos and man's
existence had each its raison d'etre. We must add that this
traditional conception of a defense against history, this
way of tolerating historical events, continued to prevail in
the world down to a tim^ very close to our own; and that
it still continues to console the agricultural ( = traditional)
societies of Europe, which obstinately adhere to an anhis
torical position and are, by that fact, exposed to the violent
attacks of all revolutionary ideologies. The Christianity of the popular European strata never succeeded in abolishing either the theory of the archetype (which transformed a
historical personage into an exemplary hero and a his
torical event into a mythical category) or the cyclical and
astral theories (according to which history was justified,
and the sufferings provoked by it assumed an eschatological meaning). Thus to give only a few examples the barbarian invaders of the High Middle Ages were assimi
lated to the Biblical archetype Gog and Magog and thus
received an ontological status and an eschatological func
tion. A few centuries later, Christians were to regard
Genghis Khan as a new David, destined to accomplish the
prophecies of Ezekiel. Thus interpreted, the sufferings and
catastrophes provoked by the appearance of the barbarians on the medieval historical horizon were "tolerated" by the
same process that, some thousands of years earlier, had made it possible to tolerate the terrors of history in the
ancient East. It is such justifications of historical catas
trophes that today still make life possible for tens of mil



THE TERROR OF HISTORY
lions of men, who continue to recognize, in the unremitting
pressure of events, signs of the divine will or of an astral
fatality. If we turn to the other traditional conception that of
cyclical time and the periodic regeneration of history, whether or not it involves the myth of eternal repetition
we find that, although the earliest Christian writers began
by violently opposing it, it nevertheless in the end made
its way into Christian philosophy. We must remind our
selves that, for Christianity, time is real because it has a
meaning the Redemption. "A straight line traces the
course of humanity from initial Fall to final Redemption.
And the meaning of this history is unique, because the
Incarnation is a unique fact. Indeed, as Chapter 9 of the Epistle to the Hebrews and I Peter 3:18 emphasize, Christ died for our sins once only, once for all (hapax,
ephapax, semel); it is not an event subject to repetition, which can be reproduced several times (pollakis). The de
velopment of history is thus governed and oriented by a unique fact, a fact that stands entirely alone. Consequently the destiny of all mankind, together with the individual
destiny of each one of us, are both likewise played out
once, once for all, in a concrete and irreplaceable time
which is that of history and life/* * It is this linear con
ception of time and history, which, already outlined in the second century by St. Irenaeus of Lyon, will be taken up
again by St. Basil and St. Gregory and be finally elabo
rated by St. Augustine. But despite the reaction of the orthodox Fathers, the
theories of cycles and of astral influences on human destiny
and historical events were accepted, at least in part, by

THE MYTH OF THE ETEHNAL RETURN
other Fathers and ecclesiastical writers, such as Clement
of Alexandria, Minucius Felix, Arnobius, and Theodoret. The conflict between these two fundamental conceptions of time and history continued into the seventeenth century.
We cannot even consider recapitulating the admirable anal
yses made by Pierre Duhem and Lynn Thorndike, and re
sumed and completed by Pitirim Sorokin. 2 We must remind
the reader that, at the height of the Middle Ages, cyclical
and astral theories begin to dominate historiological and
eschatological speculation. Already popular in the twelfth century,3 they undergo systematic elaboration in the next,
especially after the appearance of translations from Arabic
writers. 4 Increasingly precise correlations are attempted between the cosmic and the geographical factors involved
and the respective periodicities (in the direction already indicated by Ptolemy, in the second century of our era, in
his Tetmbiblos). An Albertus Magnus, a St. Thomas, a
Roger Bacon, a Dante (Convivio, II, Ch. 14), and many
others believe that the cycles and periodicities of the
world's history are governed by the influence of the stars,
whether this influence obeys the will of God and is his
instrument in history or whether a hypothesis that gains increasing adherence it is regarded as a force immanent
in the cosmos. 5 In short, to adopt Sorokin's formulation, the Middle Ages are dominated by the eschatological conception (in its two essential moments: the creation and the
end of the world) , complemented by the theory of cyclic undulation that explains the periodic return of events. This
twofold dogma dominates speculation down to the seven
teenth century, although, at the same time, a theory of

144



THE TERROR OF HISTORY
the linear progress of history begins to assert itself. In
the Middle Ages, the germs of this theory can be recog
nized in the writings of Albertus Magnus and St. Thomas;
but it is with the Eternal Gospel of Joachim of Floris that
it appears in all its coherence, as an integral element of a
magnificent eschatology of history, the most significant contribution to Christianity in this field since St. Augus
tine's. Joachim of Floris divides the history of the world
into three great epochs, successively inspired and dominated by a different person of the Trinity: Father, Son, Holy Ghost. In the Calabrian abbot's vision, each of these
epochs reveals, in history, a new dimension of the divinity
and, by this fact, allows humanity to perfect itself progres
sively until finally, in the last phase inspired by the Holy Ghost it arrives at absolute spiritual freedom. 6
But, as we said, the tendency which gains increasing adherence is that of an immanentization of the cyclical
theory. Side by side with voluminous astrological treatises, the considerations of scientific astronomy assert them
selves. So it is that in the theories of Tycho Brahe, Kepler,
Cardano, Giordano Bruno, or Campanella, the cyclical ideology survives beside the new conception of linear
progress professed, for example, by a Francis Bacon or a Pascal. From the seventeenth century on, linearism and the
progressivistic conception of history assert themselves more and more, inaugurating faith in an infinite progress, a
faith already proclaimed by Leibniz, predominant in the century of "enlightenment," and popularized in the nine
8 It was a real tragedy for the Western world that Joachim of Floris' prophetico
eschatological speculations, though they inspired and fertilized the thought of a St. Francis of Assisi, of a Dante, and of a Savonarola, so quickly sank into oblivion,
the Calabrian monk surviving only as a name to which could be attached a multi
tude of apocryphal writings. The immanence of spiritual freedom, not only in respect to dogma but also in respect to society (a freedom that Joachim con
ceived as a necessity of both divine and historical dialectics), was again professed, at a later period, by the ideologies of the Reformation and the Renaissance, but in entirely different terms and in accordance with different spiritual views,

THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
teenth century by the triumph of the ideas of the evolu
tionists. We must wait until our own century to see the
beginnings of certain new reactions against this historical
linearism and a certain revival of interest in the theory
of cycles; 7 so it is that, in political economy, we are witnessing the rehabilitation of the notions of cycle, fluctua
tion, periodic oscillation; that in philosophy the myth of eternal return is revivified by Nietzsche; or that, in the
philosophy of history, a Spengler or a Toynbee concern themselves with the problem of periodicity. 8
In connection with this rehabilitation of cyclical con
ceptions, Sorokin rightly observes 9 that present theories concerning the death of the universe do not exclude the
hypothesis of the creation of a new universe, somewhat after the fashion of the Great Year in Greco-Oriental
speculation or of the yuga cycle in the thought of India (see above, pp. 113 ff.). Basically, it may be said that it is only in the cyclical theories of modern times that the mean
ing of the archaic myth of eternal repetition realizes its full
implications. For the medieval cyclical theories confined
themselves to justifying the periodicity of events by giving them an integral place in the rhythms of the cosmos and the
fatalities of the stars. They thereby also implicitly affirmed
the cyclical repetition of the events of history, even when
this repetition was not regarded as continuing ad injinitum. Even more: by the fact that historical events depended
upon cycles and astral situations, they became intelligible and even foreseeable, since they thus acquired a transcend

THE TERROR OF HISTORY
ent model; the wars, famines, and wretchedness provoked
by contemporary history were at most only the repetition of an archetype, itself determined by the stars and by
celestial norms from which the divine will was not always
absent. As at the close of antiquity, these new expressions of the myth of eternal return were above all appreciated
among the intellectual elites and especially consoled those
who directly suffered the pressure of history. The peasant
masses, in antiquity as in modern times, took less interest
in cyclical and astral formulas; indeed, they found their
consolation and support in the concept of archetypes and
repetition, a concept that they 'lived'' less on the plane of the cosmos and the stars than on the mythico-historical
level (transforming, for example, historical personages into exemplary heroes, historical events into mythical categories, and so on, in accordance with the dialectic which
we defined above, pp. 37 ff.).
The Difficulties of Historicism
THE REAPPEARANCE of cyclical theories in contemporary
thought is pregnant with meaning. Incompetent as we are to pass judgment upon their validity, we shall confine our
selves to observing that the formulation, in modern terms, of an archaic myth betrays at least the desire to find a
meaning and a transhistorical justification for historical
events. Thus we find ourselves once again in the pre
Hegelian position, the validity of the "historicistic" solu
tions, from Hegel to Marx, being implicitly called into
question. From Hegel on, every effort is directed toward
saving and conferring value on the historical event as such,
the event in itself and for itself. In his study of the German
Constitution, Hegel wrote that if we recognize that things 147



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
are necessarily as they are, that is, that they are not arbi
trary and not the result of chance, we shall at the same time
recognize that they must be as they are. A century later,
the concept of historical necessity will enjoy a more and
more triumphant practical application: in fact, all the cruelties, aberrations, and tragedies of history have been, and still are, justified by the necessities of the "historical mo
ment." Probably Hegel did not intend to go so far. But
since he had resolved to reconcile himself with his own
historical moment, he was obliged to see in every event the will of the Universal Spirit. This is why he considered
"reading the morning papers a sort of realistic benediction
of the morning/' For him, only daily contact with events could orient man's conduct in his relations with the world and with God.
How could Hegel know what was necessary in history, what, consequently, must occur exactly as it had occurred? Hegel believed that he knew what the Universal Spirit
wanted. We shall not insist upon the audacity of this
thesis, which, after all, abolishes precisely what Hegel
wanted to save in history human freedom. But there is an
aspect of Hegel's philosophy of history that interests us because it still preserves something of the Judaeo-Christian conception: for Hegel, the historical event was the mani
festation of the Universal Spirit. Now, it is possible to
discern a parallel between Hegel's philosophy of history
and the theology of history of the Hebrew prophets: for the latter, as for Hegel, an event is irreversible and valid
in itself inasmuch as it is a new manifestation of the will of
God a proposition really revolutionary, we should remind ourselves, from the viewpoint of traditional societies
dominated by the eternal repetition of archetypes. Thus,
in Hegel's view, the destiny of a people still preserved a transhistorical significance, because all history revealed a
148



THE TERROR OF HISTORY
new and more perfect manifestation of the Universal Spirit.
But with Marx, history cast off all transcendental signifi
cance; it was no longer anything more than the epiphany
of the class struggle. To what extent could such a theory
justify historical sufferings? For the answer, we have but to turn to the pathetic resistance of a Belinsky or a Dostoev
ski, for example, who asked themselves how, from the
viewpoint of the Hegelian and Marxian dialectic, it was possible to redeem all the dramas of oppression, the col
lective sufferings, deportations, humiliations, and massacres that fill universal history.
Yet Marxism preserves a meaning to history. For Marxism, events are not a succession of arbitrary acci
dents; they exhibit a coherent structure and, above all,
they lead to a definite end final elimination of the terror
of history, "salvation." Thus, at the end of the Marxist
philosophy of history, lies the age of gold of the archaic eschatologies. In this sense it is correct to say not only
that Marx "brought Hegel's philosophy back to earth" but also that he reconfirmed, upon an exclusively human level, the value of the primitive myth of the age of gold, with
the difference that he puts the age of gold only at the end
of history, instead of putting it at the beginning too. Here, for the militant Marxist, lies the secret of the remedy for
the terror of history: just as the contemporaries of a "dark age" consoled themselves for their increasing sufferings
by the thought that the aggravation of evil hastens final
deliverance, so the militant Marxist of our day reads, in
the drama provoked by the pressure of history, a necessary evil, the premonitory symptom of the approaching victory that will put an end forever to all historical "evil."
The terror of history becomes more and more intoler
able from the viewpoints afforded by the various his
toricistic philosophies. For in them, of course, every 149



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
historical event finds its full and only meaning in its reali
zation alone. We need not here enter into the theoretical
difficulties of historicism, which already troubled Rickert,
Troeltsch, Dilthey, and Simmel, and which the recent efforts of Croce, of Karl Mannheim, or of Ortega y Gasset have but partially overcome. 10 This essay does not require
us to discuss either the philosophical value of historicism
as such or the possibility of establishing a "philosophy of history" that should definitely transcend relativism.
Dilthey himself, at the age of seventy, recognized that "the relativity of all human concepts is the last word of the historical vision of the world/' In vain did he proclaim an
allgemeine Lebenserfahrung as the final means of transcending this relativity. In vain did Meinecke invoke "examina
tion of conscience" as a transsubjective experience capable of transcending the relativity of historical life. Heidegger had gone to the trouble of showing that the historicity of
human existence forbids all hope of transcending time and
history. For our purpose, only one question concerns us: How can the "terror of history" be tolerated from the view
point of historicism? Justification of a historical event by
the simple fact that it is a historical event, in other words,
by the simple fact that it "happened that way/' will not
go far toward freeing humanity from the terror that the event inspires. Be it understood that we are not here concerned with the problem of evil, which, from whatever
10 Let us say, first of all, that the terms "historism" or "historicism" cover many
different and antagonistic philosophical currents and orientations. It is enough to
recall Dilthey's vitalistic relativism, Croce's storicismo, Gentile's attualismo, and
Ortega's "historical reason" to realize the multiplicity of philosophical valuations
accorded to history during the first half of the twentienth century. For Croce's
present position, see his "La storia come pensiero e come azione," Cr#/ca(Bari),
1937. Cf. also Jose* Ortega y Gasset, Historia como sistema (Madrid, 1941); Karl
Mannheim, Ideology and Utopia (trans, by Louis Wirth and Edward Shils, New
York, 1936}. On the problem of history, see also Pedro Lain Entralgo, Medidna e
Mstoria (Madrid, 1941); and Karl Lowith, Meaning in History (Chicago, 1949).
150



THE TERROR OF HISTORY
angle it be viewed, remains a philosophical and religious
problem; we are concerned with the problem of history as history, of the "evil" that is bound up not with man's con
dition but with his behavior toward others. We should
wish to know, for example, how it would be possible to
tolerate, and to justify, the sufferings and annihilation of so many peoples who suffer and are annihilated for the
simple reason that their geographical situation sets them
in the pathway of history; that they are neighbors of em
pires in a state of permanent expansion. How justify, for example, the fact that southwestern Europe had to suffer for centuries and hence to renounce any impulse toward
a higher historical existence, toward spiritual creation on the universal plane for the sole reason that it happened
to be on the road of the Asiatic invaders and later the
neighbor of the Ottoman Empire? And in our day, when
historical pressure no longer allows any escape, how can
man tolerate the catastrophes and horrors of history from
collective deportations and massacres to atomic bombings
if beyond them he can glimpse no sign, no transhistorical
meaning; if they are only the blind play of economic, social, or political forces, or, even worse, only the result of the "liberties" that a minority takes and exercises directly on
the stage of universal history?
We know how, in the past, humanity has been able to
endure the sufferings we have enumerated: they were re
garded as a punishment inflicted by God, the syndrome of
the decline of the "age," and so on. And it was possible
to accept them precisely because they had a metahistorical
meaning, because, for the greater part of mankind, still clinging to the traditional viewpoint, history did not have, and could not have, value in itself. Every hero repeated
the archetypal gesture, every war rehearsed the struggle between good and evil, every fresh social injustice was
151



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
identified with the sufferings of the Saviour (or, for ex
ample, in the pre-Christian world, with the passion of a
divine messenger or vegetation god), each new massacre
repeated the glorious end of the martyrs. It is not our part to decide whether such motives were puerile or not,
or whether such a refusal of history always proved effi
cacious. In our opinion, only one fact counts: by virtue of
this view, tens of millions of men were able, for century
after century, to endure great historical pressures without
despairing, without committing suicide or falling into that
spiritual aridity that always brings with it a relativistic or nihilistic view of history.
Moreover, as we have already observed, a very considerable fraction of the population of Europe, to say
nothing of the other continents, still lives today by the
light of the traditional, anti-"historicistic" viewpoint. Hence it is above all the "elites" that are confronted with
the problem, since they alone are forced, and with in
creasing rigor, to take cognizance of their historical situ
ation. It is true that Christianity and the eschatological philosophy of history have not ceased to satisfy a consider
able proportion of these elites. Up to a certain point, and
for certain individuals, it may be said that Marxism es
pecially in its popular forms represents a defense against the terror of history. Only the historicistic position, in all
its varieties and shades from Nietzsche's "destiny" to
Heidegger's "temporality" remains disarmed. 11 It is by
no means mere fortuitious coincidence that, in this philoso
11 We take the liberty of emphasizing that "historicism" was created and pro
fessed above all by thinkers belonging to nations for which history has never been
a continuous terror. These thinkers would perhaps have adopted another viewpoint
had they belonged to nations marked by the "fatality of history." It would cer
tainly be interesting, in any case, to know if the theory according to which every
thing that happens is "good," simply because it has happened, would have been
accepted without qualms by the thinkers of the Baltic countries, of the Balkans, or
of colonial territories.
152



THE TERROR OF HISTORY
phy, despair, the amorfati, and pessimism are elevated to the rank of heroic virtues and instruments of cognition.
Yet this position, although the most modern and, in a
certain sense, almost the inevitable position for all thinkers
who define man as a "historical being," has not yet made a
definitive conquest of contemporary thought. Some pages
earlier, we noted various recent orientations that tend to
reconfer value upon the myth of cyclical periodicity, even the myth of eternal return. These orientations disregard
not only historicism but even history as such. We believe
we are justified in seeing in them, rather than a resistance
to history, a revolt against historical time, an attempt to restore this historical time, freighted as it is with human
experience, to a place in the time that is cosmic, cyclical, and infinite. In any case it is worth noting that the work
of two of the most significant writers of our day T. S.
Eliot and James Joyce is saturated with nostalgia for the
myth of eternal repetition and, in the last analysis, for the abolition of time. There is also reason to foresee that, as
the terror of history grows worse, as existence becomes
more and more precarious because of history, the positions of historicism will increasingly lose in prestige. And, at a
moment when history could do what neither the cosmos, nor man, nor chance have yet succeeded in doing that
is, wipe out the human race in its entirety it may be
that we are witnessing a desperate attempt to prohibit the "events of history" through a reintegration of human societies within the horizon (artificial, because decreed) of
archetypes and their repetition. In other words, it is not inadmissible to think of an epoch, and an epoch not too
far distant, when humanity, to ensure its survival, will find itself reduced to desisting from any further "making"
of history in the sense in which it began to make it from
the creation of the first empires, will confine itself to re
153



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
peating prescribed archetypal gestures, and will strive to forget, as meaningless and dangerous, any spontaneous gesture which might entail "historical" consequences. It would even be interesting to compare the anhistorical
solution of future societies with the paradisal or eschato
logical myths of the golden age of the beginning or the
end of the world. But as we have it in mind to pursue these
speculations elsewhere, let us now return to our problem:
the position of historical man in relation to archaic man,
and let us attempt to understand the objections brought against the latter on the basis of the historicistic view.
Freedom and History
IN HIS rejection of concepts of periodicity and hence, in the
last analysis, of the archaic concepts of archetypes and
repetition, we are, we believe, justified in seeing modern man's resistance to nature, the will of "historical man" to
affirm his autonomy. As Hegel remarked, with noble self
assurance, nothing new ever occurs in nature. And the
crucial difference between the man of the archaic civiliza
tions and modern, historical man lies in the increasing
value the latter gives to historical events, that is, to the
''novelties" that, for traditional man, represented either
meaningless conjunctures or infractions of norms (hence "faults," "sins," and so on) and that, as such, required to
be expelled (abolished) periodically. The man who adopts
the historical viewpoint would be justified in regarding the traditional conception of archetypes and repetition as an aberrant reidentification of history (that is, of "free
dom" and "novelty") with nature (in which everything
repeats itself). For, as modern man can observe, archetypes themselves constitute a "history" insofar as they are 154



THE TERROR OF HISTORY
made up of gestures, acts, and decrees that, although supposed to have been manifested in illo tempore, were never
theless manifested, that is, came to birth in time, "took
place/' like any other historical event. Primitive myths
often mention the birth, activity, and disappearance of a god or a hero whose "civilizing" gestures are thenceforth
repeated ad injinitum. This comes down to saying that
archaic man also knows a history, although it is a primor
dial history, placed in a mythical time. Archaic man's re
jection of history, his refusal to situate himself in a con
crete, historical time, would, then, be the symptom of a
precocious weariness, a fear of movement and spontaneity; in short, placed between accepting the historical condition
and its risks on the one hand, and his reidentification with
the modes of nature on the other, he would choose such a
reidentification.
In this total adherence, on the part of archaic man, to
archetypes and repetition, modern man would be justified in seeing not only the primitives' amazement at their own
first spontaneous and creative free gestures and their
veneration, repeated ad infinitum, but also a feeling of guilt on the part of man hardly emerged from the paradise
of animality (i.e., from nature), a feeling that urges him to
reidentify with nature's eternal repetition the few primor
dial, creative, and spontaneous gestures that had signalized the appearance of freedom. Continuing his critique, modern man could even read in this fear, this hesitation or fatigue
in the presence of any gesture without an archetype, nature's tendency toward equilibrium and rest; and he would read this tendency in the anticlimax that fatally fol
lows upon any exuberant gesture of life and that some
have gone so far as to recognize in the need felt by human
reason to unify the real through knowledge. In the last
analysis, modern man, who accepts history or claims to 155



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
accept it, can reproach archaic man, imprisoned within the
mythical horizon of archetypes and repetition, with his
creative impotence, or, what amounts to the same thing,
his inability to accept the risks entailed by every creative
act. For the modern man can be creative only insofar as
he is historical; in other words, all creation is forbidden
him except that which has its source in his own freedom;
and, consequently, everything is denied him except the freedom to make history by making himself. To these criticisms raised by modern man, the man of
the traditional civilizations could reply by a countercriticism that would at the same time be a defense of the type
of archaic existence. It is becoming more and more doubt
ful, he might say, if modern man can make history. On the contrary, the more modern 12 he becomes that is, without
defenses against the terror of history the less chance he
has of himself making history. For history either makes
itself ( as the result of the seed sown by acts that occurred
in the past, several centuries or even several millennia ago;
we will cite the consequences of the discovery of agriculture or metallurgy, of the Industrial Revolution in the
eighteenth century, and so on) or it tends to be made by
an increasingly smaller number of men who not only pro
hibit the mass of their contemporaries from directly or in
directly intervening in the history they are making (or which the small group is making), but in addition have at
their disposal means sufficient to force each individual to
endure, for his own part, the consequences of this history,
that is, to live immediately and continuously in dread of
history. Modern man's boasted freedom to make history
is illusory for nearly the whole of the human race. At most,
12 It is well to make clear that, in this context, "modern man" is such in his insistence upon being exclusively historical; i.e., that he is, above all, the "man" of historicism, of Marxism, and of existentialism. It is superfluous to add that
not all of our contemporaries recognize themselves in such a man.
156



THE TERROR OF HISTORY
man is left free to choose between two positions: (l) to
oppose the history that is being made by the very small minority (and, in this case, he is free to choose between
suicide and deportation); (2) to take refuge in a subhuman existence or in flight. The "freedom" that historical
existence implies was possible and even then within cer
tain limits at the beginning of the modern period, but it
tends to become inaccessible as the period becomes more
historical, by which we mean more alien from any trans
historical model. It is perfectly natural, for example, that Marxism and Fascism must lead to the establishment of
two types of historical existence: that of the leader (the
only really "free" man) and that of the followers, who find, in the historical existence of the leader, not an arche
type of their own existence but the lawgiver of the gestures
that are provisionally permitted them. Thus, for traditional man, modern man affords the type
neither of a free being nor of a creator of history. On the
contrary, the man of the archaic civilizations can be proud
of his mode of existence, which allows him to be free and
to create. He is free to be no longer what he was, free to
annul his own history through periodic abolition of time
and collective regeneration. This freedom in respect to
his own history which, for the modern, is not only irreversible but constitutes human existence cannot be
claimed by the man who wills to be historical. We know
that the archaic and traditional societies granted freedom
each year to begin a new, a "pure" existence, with virgin
possibilities. And there is no question of seeing in this an imitation of nature, which also undergoes periodic regen
eration, "beginning anew" each spring, with each spring
recovering all its powers intact. Indeed, whereas nature
repeats itself, each new spring being the same eternal
spring (that is, the repetition of the Creation), archaic 157



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
man's "purity" after the periodic abolition of time and the
recovery of his virtualities intact allows him, on the thresh
old of each "new life," a continued existence in eternity
and hence the definitive abolition, hie et nunc, of profane
time. The intact "possibilities" of nature each spring and archaic man's possibilities on the threshold of each year
are, then, not homologous. Nature recovers only itself,
whereas archaic man recovers the possibility of definitively
transcending time and living in eternity. Insofar as he fails to do so, insofar as he "sins," that is, falls into historical
existence, into time, he each year thwarts the possibility. At least he retains the freedom to annul his faults, to wipe
out the memory of his "fall into history," and to make
another attempt to escape definitively from time. 13 Furthermore, archaic man certainly has the right to consider himself more creative than modern man, who sees
himself as creative only in respect to history. Every year,
that is, archaic man takes part in the repetition of the
cosmogony, the creative act par excellence. We may even
add that, for a certain time, man was creative on the cosmic
plane, imitating this periodic cosmogony (which he also repeated on all the other planes of life, cf. pp. 80 ff.) and
participating in it. 14 We should also bear in mind the
"creationistic" implications of the Oriental philosophies
and techniques (especially the Indian), which thus find a place in the same traditional horizon. The East unani
mously rejects the idea of the ontological irreducibility of the existent, even though it too sets out from a sort of
"existentialism" (i.e., from acknowledging suffering as the
situation of any possible cosmic condition) . Only, the East does not accept the destiny of the human being as final and irreducible. Oriental techniques attempt above all to
18 On this, see our Trazte d'histoire des religions (Paris, 1949), pp. 340 flf.
14 Not to mention the possibilities of "magical creation," which exist in tradi
tional societies, and which are real.
158



THE TERROR OF HISTORY
annul or transcend the human condition. In this respect, it
is justifiable to speak not only of freedom (in the positive
sense) or deliverance (in the negative sense) but actually
of creation; for what is involved is creating a new man and
creating him on a suprahuman plane, a man-god, such as
the imagination of historical man has never dreamed it
possible to create.
Despair or Faith
HOWEVER this may be, our dialogue between archaic man
and modern man does not affect our problem. Whatever
be the truth in respect to the freedom and the creative
virtualities of historical man, it is certain that none of the
historicistic philosophies is able to defend him from the
terror of history. We could even imagine a final attempt: to save history and establish an ontology of history, events
would be regarded as a series of "situations" by virtue of
which the human spirit should attain knowledge of levels
of reality otherwise inaccessible to it. This attempt to
justify history is not without interest,16 and we anticipate returning to the subject elsewhere. But we are able to
observe here and now that such a position affords a shelter
from the terror of history only insofar as it postulates the
existence at least of the Universal Spirit. What consolation
18 It is only through some such reasoning that it would be possible to found a
sociology of knowledge that should not lead to relativism and skepticism. The "influences" economic, social, national, cultural that affect "ideologies" (in
the sense which Karl Mannheim gave the term) would not annul their objective
value any more than the fever or the intoxication that reveals to a poet a new poetic creation impairs the value of the latter. All these social, economic, and other influences would, on the contrary, be occasions for envisaging a spiritual universe
from new angles. But it goes without saying that a sociology of knowledge, that is, the study of the social conditioning of ideologies, could avoid relativism only
by affirming the autonomy of the spirit which, if we understand him aright,
Karl Mannheim did not dare to affirm.
159



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
should we find in knowing that the sufferings of millions of men have made possible the revelation of a limitary situ
ation of the human condition if, beyond that limitary
situation, there should be only nothingness? Again, there is no question here of judging the validity of a historicistic
philosophy, but only of establishing to what extent such a philosophy can exorcise the terror of history. If, for his
torical tragedies to be excused, it suffices that they should
be regarded as the means by which man has been enabled
to know the limit of human resistance, such an excuse can in no way make man less haunted by the terror of history.
Basically, the horizon of archetypes and repetition cannot be transcended with impunity unless we accept a phi
losophy of freedom that does not exclude God. And indeed
this proved to be true when the horizon of archetypes and
repetition was transcended, for the first time, by JudaeoChristianism, which introduced a new category into re
ligious experience: the category of faith. It must not be forgotten that, if Abraham's faith can be defined as "for
God everything is possible/' the faith of Christianity implies that everything is also possible for man. "... Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever
shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be
thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but
shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say
unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them" (Mark
11 : 2-24). 16 Faith, in this context, as in many others,
means absolute emancipation from any kind of natural
"law" and hence the highest freedom that man can imagine: freedom to intervene even in the ontological con
16 Such affirmations must not be complacently dismissed merely because they
imply the possibility of miracle. If miracles have been so rare since the appearance
of Christianity, the blame rests not on Christianity but on Christians.
160



THE TERROR OF HISTORY
stitution of the universe. It is, consequently, a pre-emi
ently creative freedom. In other words, it constitutes a
new formula for man's collaboration with the creation
the first, but also the only such formula accorded to him since the traditional horizon of archetypes and repetition was transcended. Only such a freedom (aside from its
soteriological, hence, in the strict sense, its religious value)
is able to defend modern man from the terror of history
a freedom, that is, which has its source and finds its
guaranty and support in God. Every other modern freedom, whatever satisfactions it may procure to him who
possesses it, is powerless to justify history; and this, for
every man who is sincere with himself, is equivalent to the terror of history.
We may say, furthermore, that Christianity is the "re
ligion" of modern man and historical man, of the man who
simultaneously discovered personal freedom and continu
ous time (in place of cyclical time). It is even interesting
to note that the existence of God forced itself far more
urgently upon modern man, for whom history exists as
such, as history and not as repetition, than upon the man of the archaic and traditional cultures, who, to defend him
self from the terror of history, had at his disposition all
the myths, rites, and customs mentioned in the course of
this book. Moreover, although the idea of God and the
religious experiences that it implies existed from the most distant ages, they could be, and were, replaced at times by
other religious "forms" (totemism, cult of ancestors, Great Goddesses of fecundity, and so on) that more promptly
answered the religious needs of primitive humanity. In the
horizon of archetypes and repetition, the terror of history, when it appeared, could be supported. Since the "inven
tion" of faith, in the Judaeo-Christian sense of the word
( =s for God all is possible) , the man who has left the
161



THE MYTH OF THE ETERNAL RETURN
horizon of archetypes and repetition can no longer defend himself against that terror except through the idea of God.
In fact, it is only by presupposing the existence of God
that he conquers, on the one hand, freedom (which grants him autonomy in a universe governed by laws or, in other
words, the "inauguration" of a mode of being that is new
and unique in the universe) and, on the other hand, the certainty that historical tragedies have a transhistorical
meaning, even if that meaning is not always visible for
humanity in its present condition. Any other situation of
modern man leads, in the end, to despair. It is a despair
provoked not by his own human existentiality, but by his presence in a historical universe in which almost the whole
of mankind lives prey to a continual terror (even if not
always conscious of it).
In this respect, Christianity incontestibly proves to be the religion of "fallen man": and this to the extent to
which modern man is irremediably identified with history
and progress, and to which history and progress are a fall, both implying the final abandonment of the paradise of
archetypes and repetition.
