PREFACE.
Among the many wonderful achievements of the present
century there is none more wonderful than the recovery
and decipherment of the monuments of ancient Nineveh.
For generations the great oppressing city had slept
buried beneath the fragments of its own ruins, its his
tory lost, its very site forgotten. Its name had passed
into the region of myth even in the age of the classical
writers of Greece and Rome ; Ninos or Nineveh had become a hero-king about whom strange legends were told, and whose conquests were fabled to have extended from the Mediterranean to India. Little was known of the history of the mighty Assyrian Empire beyond what
might be learnt from the Old Testament, and that little
was involved in doubt and obscurity. Scholars wrote
long treatises to reconcile the statements of Greek his
torians with those of Scripture, but they only succeeded
in evolving theories which were contradicted and overthrown by the next writer. There was none so bold as
to suggest that the history and life of Assyria were still
lying hidden beneath the ground, ready to rise up and
disclose their secrets at the touch of a magician’s rod.
The rod was the spade and the patient sagacity which



8 PREFACE.
deciphered and interpreted what the spade had found.
It might have been thought that the cuneiform or wedge
shaped inscriptions of Assyria could never be forced to
reveal their mysteries. The language in which they
were written was unknown, and all clue to the meaning
of the multitudinous characters that composed them had
long been lost. No bilingual text came to the aid of the
decipherer like the Rosetta Stone, whose Greek inscrip
tion had furnished the key to the meaning of the
Egyptian hieroglyphics. Nevertheless the great feat
was accomplished. Step by step the signification of the
cuneiform characters and the words they concealed was
made out, until it is now possible to translate an ordinary
Assyrian text with as much ease and certainty as a page
of the Old Testament.
And the revelation that awaited the decipherer was
startling in the extreme. The ruins of Nineveh yielded
not only sculptures and inscriptions carved in stone, but
a whole library of books. True, the books are written
upon clay, and not on paper, but they are none the less
real books, dealing with all the subjects of knowledge
known at the time they were compiled, and presenting
us with a clear and truthful reflection of Assyrian
thought and belief. We can not only trace the archi
tectural plans of the Assyrian palaces, and study the
bas-reliefs in which the Assyrians have pictured them
selves and the life they led ; we can also penetrate to
their inmost thoughts and feelings, and read their history
as they have told it themselves



PREFACE. 9
It is a strange thing to examine for the first time one
of the clay tablets of the old Assyrian library. Usually
it has been more or less broken by the catastrophe of
that terrible day when Nineveh was captured by its
enemies, and the palace and library burnt and destroyed together. But whether it is a fragment or a complete
tablet, it is impossible not to handle it reverently when
cleaning it from the dirt with which its long sojourn in
the earth has encrusted it, and spelling out its words for
the first time for more than 2,000 years. When last the
characters upon it were read, it was in days when Assyria
was still a name of terror, and the destruction that God’s
prophets had predicted was still to come. When its last
reader laid it aside, Judah had not as yet undergone the
chastisement of the Babylonish exile, the Old Testament
was an uncompleted volume, the kingdom of the Messiah
a promise of the distant future. We are brought face to
face, as it were, with men who were the contemporaries
of Isaiah, of Hezekiah, of Ahaz ; nay, of men whose
names have been familiar to us since we first read the
Bible by our mother’s side.
Tiglath-Pileser and Sennacherib can never again be
to us mere names. We possess the records which they
caused to be written, and in which they told the story of
their campaigns in Palestine. The records are not copies
of older texts, with all the errors that human fallibility
causes copyists and scribes to make. They are the
original documents which were recited to the kings who
ordered them to be compiled, and who may have held



10 PREFACE.
them in their own hands. The gulf of centuries and
forgetfulness that has divided us from Sennacherib is
filled up when we read the account of his invasion of Judah, which seems to come from his own lips. Never
again can the heroes of the Old Testament be to us as
lay-figures, whose story is told by a voice that comes from a dark and unreal past. The voice is now become
a living one, and we can realise that Isaiah and those of
whom Isaiah wrote were men of flesh and blood like
ourselves, with the same passions, the same needs, the
same temptations.
This realisation of Old Testament history is not the
only result of the recovery of Assyria upon Biblical
studies. It is a very important result, but there are
others besides of equal importance. One of these is the
unexpected confirmation of the correctness of Holy Writ
which Assyrian discovery has afforded. The later his
tory of the Old Testament no longer stands alone. Once
it was itself the sole witness for the truth of the narra
tives it contains. Classical history or legend dealt with
other lands and other ages ; there were no documents
besides those contained in the Old Testament to which
we could appeal in support of its statements. All is
changed now. The earth has yielded up its secrets ; the
ancient civilisation of Assyria has stepped forth again
into the light of day, and has furnished us with records,
the authenticity of which none can deny, which run side
by side with those of the Books of Kings, confirming,
explaining, and illustrating them. It has been said that



PREFACE. II
just at the moment when sceptical criticism seemed to
have achieved its worst, and to have resolved the narra
tives of the Old Testament into myths or fables, God’s
Providence was raising up from the grave of centuries a
new and unimpeachable witness for their truth. Indeed,
so strikingly was this the case, that one of the objections
brought against the correctness of Assyrian decipherment in its early days was that Assyrian monarchs could
never have concerned themselves with petty kingdoms
like those of Samaria and Judah, as the decipherers made
them do. Before the cuneiform monuments were inter
preted, no one could have suspected that they would have poured such a flood of light upon Old Testament
history.
This light is manifold. The very language of the
inscriptions has helped to explain difficult passages in
the Hebrew Bible. Assyrian turns out to be very closely
related to Hebrew, as closely related, in fact, as two
strongly marked English dialects are to one another.
There is no other Semitic language (except, of course,
Phoenician, which is practically the same as Hebrew)
which is so nearly allied to it. And thanks to the
library of Nineveh, and its lexicons and lists of synony
mous words, we have a larger literature, and a larger
vocabulary, to draw upon in the case of Assyrian than we have in the case of Hebrew. The consequence is that Assyrian may sometimes settle the meaning of a word which occurs only once or very rarely in the Old Testament. Thus the word z'bhul
\
which Hebrew



12 PREFACE.
scholars had supposed to mean ‘a dwelling,’ is shown
by the Assyrian texts to signify a ‘height,’ so that in
i Kings viii. 13, Solomon does not declare to God that
he had built Him ‘an house to dwell in,’ as the
Authorised Version renders the passage, but ‘a lofty
temple.’ Naturally words of Assyrian origin, like Rab
shakeh and Tartan, have first received their explanation
from the decipherment of the Assyrian inscriptions.
They are not proper names, but titles, the Rab-shakeh
being ‘the chief of the princes,’ or Vizier, and the
Tartan, the commander-in-chief.
But not only do we find parallels to Hebrew in the
individual words of Assyrian, we also find parallel
expressions which illustrate and explain those of the
Hebrew text. We all remember the statement that the ‘ Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brim
stone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.’ The
same phrase occurs in an unpublished Accadian hymn
addressed to a deity whose name is lost, but who was
probably Rimmon the Air-god. The Accadian original
describes him as ‘ raining fire and stones upon the
enemy,’ which the Assyrian translation changes into
‘ raining stones and fire upon the foe ’ in exact confor
mity with the Hebrew phrase. The familiar expression
‘ the Lord of Hosts,’ similarly finds its analogue and illus
tration in the common Assyrian title of the supreme god
Assur : ‘ lord of the legions of heaven and earth,’ these
legions being the multitudinous spirits and angels whose
home was in ‘ the heaven above and the earth below.’



PREFACE. 13
We can hardly speak here of the accounts of the
Creation, the Deluge, and the Tower of Babel, to which Mr. George Smith gave the name of ‘the Chaldean
Genesis/ and which agree so closely with the corre
sponding accounts in the Hebrew Book of Genesis.
Though found in the library of Nineveh, they are really
copies of older Babylonian works, and therefore belong
rather to Babylonian than to Assyrian history. It is
only the account of the Creation in six days which may
perhaps be of purely Assyrian origin. What a resem
blance it offers to the first chapter of Genesis will be
seen from the extracts from it in the chapter on Assyrian
Religion.
It is in the domain of history that the light cast upon
Old Testament Scripture by Assyrian research has been
fullest and strongest. No one can read the sketch of Assyrian history as revealed by the monuments which
is given in the following pages, without perceiving how
important it is for the proper understanding of the
ancient Scriptures. For the first time the prophecies in
Isaiah which refer to a capture of Jerusalem receive
their explanation, and the sceptical criticism is answered
which found in them a prediction of events that never
took place. The chapter in which Isaiah describes the
onward march of the Assyrian host against Jerusalem
(ch. x.) is no ‘ ideal ’ description of ‘ an ideal campaign/
the verses in which he tells us of the sufferings endured
by the beleaguered inhabitants of the Jewish capital
(ch. xxii.) are no ‘exaggerated account of a possible



PREFACE.
14
catastrophe,’ the prophecies in which he declares that
the devoted city was about to fall into the hands of its
enemies (x. 34, xxii. 14) were not unfulfilled threats.
We learn from the inscriptions of Sargon that already,
ten years before the campaign of his son Sennacherib,
the Assyrian monarch had swept through ‘ the wide
spread land of Judah,’ and had made it a tributary
province. It was not the army of Sennacherib to which
Isaiah was alluding on the day whereon he declared that
the Assyrian host was at Nob, only a short half-hour to
the north of Jerusalem, but the more terrible veterans of
Sargon who marched against the holy city along the
northern road. Similar light is thrown by the Assyrian
monuments upon another prophecy of Isaiah, in which he pronounces the doom upon the land of Egypt (ch. xix.). The prophecy has sometimes been referred
by critics to a later age than that of the great prophet
;
but the records of Esar-haddon prove that it is strictly
applicable to his time, and to his time only. The
unexpected revelation they have made to us of the
Assyrian conquest of Egypt, and its division into twenty
vassal satrapies shows us who was the ‘ cruel lord ’ and ‘ fierce king ’ into whose hands the Egyptians were
given, and paints the picture of an epoch in which ‘ the
Egyptians’ fought ‘ every one against his brother, and
every one against his neighbour ; city against city, and
kingdom against kingdom.’ The Isaianic authorship of
‘ the burden of Egypt ’ can never again be denied.
Nahum, again, we can now read with a new interest



PREFACE. 5
and a new understanding. The very date of his pro
phecy, so long disputed, can be fixed approximately by
the reference it contains to the sack of No-Amon or Thebes (iii. 8). The prophecy was delivered hard upon
sixty years before the fall of Nineveh, when the Assyrian
Empire was at the height of its prosperity, and mistress
of the Eastern world. Human foresight could little
have imagined that so great and terrible a power was so
soon to disappear. And yet at the very moment when
it seemed strongest and most secure, the Jewish prophet
was uttering a prediction which the excavations of Botta and Layard have shown to have been carried out
literally in fact. As we thread our way among the ruins
of Nineveh, or trace the after history of the deserted
and forgotten site, we see everywhere the fulfilment of Nahum’s prophecy. Of the words that he pronounced
against the doomed city, there is none which has not
come to pass. Those who would learn how marvellously the monu
ments of Assyria illustrate and corroborate the pages of
sacred history, need only compare the records they
contain with the narratives of the Books of Kings which
relate to the same period. The one complements and supplies the missing chapters given by the other. The Bible informs us why Sennacherib left Hezekiah
unpunished, and never despatched another army to
Palestine ; the cuneiform annals explain the causes of
his murder, and the reason of the flight of his sons to
Ararat or Armenia. The single passage in Scripture in



1

PREFACE.
which the name of Sargon is mentioned, no longer
remains isolated and unintelligible ; we have no longer
any need to identify him with Tiglath-Pileser, or
Shalmaneser, or any other Assyrian prince with whom the fancy of older commentators confounded him ; we
now know that he was one of the most powerful of
Assyrian conquerors, and we have his own independent
testimony to that siege and capture of Ashdod which is
the occasion of the mention of his name in Scripture.
Between the history of the monuments and the history
of the Bible there is perpetual contact ; and the voice
of the monuments is found to be in strict harmony with that of the Old Testament;
Before concluding this Preface, I have to thank Mr.
W. G. Hird for his kindness in undertaking the task of
compiling an Index to the volumo.

ASSYRIA:
ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
CHAPTER I.
The Country and People.
Assyria was the name given to the district which had
been called ‘ the land of Assur ’ by its own inhabitants.
Assur, however, had originally been the name, not of a
country, but of a city founded in remote times on the
western bank of the Tigris, midway between the Greater
and the Lesser Zab. It was the primitive capital of the
district in which it stood, and to which, accordingly, it
lent its name. It seems to have been built by a people
who spoke an agglutinative language, like the languages
of the modern Fins and Turks, and who were afterwards
supplanted by the Semitic Assyrians. The name in
their language probably signified ‘ water-boundary.’
When the country was occupied by the Semitic As
syrians the name was slightly changed, so as to assume the form of a word which in Assyrian meant ‘ gracious.’ It so happened that Assyrian mythology knew of a
deity who represented the firmament, and was addressed



22 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
as Sar. The name of Sar came in time to be confused
with that of Assur, the divine patron of the Assyrian
capital, the result being that Assur signified not only a
city and country, but also the supreme deity worshipped
by their inhabitants. Assur, in fact, became the divine
impersonation of the power and constitution of Assyria
;
at the same time he was also * the gracious * god and the
primaeval firmament of heaven.
Assur, whose ruins are now called Kalah Sherghat,
did not always remain the capital of Assyria. Its place
was taken by a group of cities some 60 miles to the
north, above the Greater Zab, and on the eastern side of
the Tigris, namely, Nineveh, Calah, and Dur-Sargon.
The foundation of Nineveh, the modern Kouyunjik,
probably goes back to as early an age as that of Assur,
but it was not until a much later period that it became
an important city, and supplanted the older capital of the kingdom. Calah, now called Nimrud, though built
some four centuries before, was not made the seat of
royalty until the reigns of Assur-natsir-pal and Shal
maneser II, in the 9th century B.C., and Dur-Sargon (the modern Khorsabad), as its name implies, was the
creation of Sargon. Instead of Dur-Sargon the Book of
Genesis (x. 11) mentions Resen ‘between Nineveh and
Calah.’ The site of Resen has not been identified,
though its name has been met with in the Assyrian
inscriptions under the form of Res-eni, ‘ the head of the
spring.’
The passage of Genesis in which Resen is referred to



THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLE. 23
unfortunately admits of a double translation. If we
adopt the rendering of the margin, and translate ‘ out of
that land he went forth into Assyria and builded
Nineveh,’ we might infer that Nineveh and its neigh
bouring towns had no existence before the days when
Babylonian emigrants settled in the territory of the city
of Assur, and superseded its older inhabitants. How
ever this may be, we know from the cuneiform monu
ments that the rise of Assyria did not take place until
the Babylonian monarchy was already growing old. The country afterwards known as Assyria had been comprised in Gutium or Kurdistan, a name which has
been identified, with great probability, by Sir H. Raw
linson, with the Goyyim or ‘ nations ’ of Genesis xiv.
over which Tidal was king. There seems to have been
a time when the rulers of Assur were mere governors
appointed by the Babylonian monarchs ; at all events,
the earliest of whom we know do not give themselves
the title of king, but use a word which signifies * viceroy ’
in the Chaldean inscriptions.
These viceroys, however, managed eventually to shake
off the yoke of their Babylonian masters, and one of
them, Bel-kapkapi by name, established an independent
kingdom at Assur in the 17th or 16th century before
our era. His kingdom extended on both sides of the
Tigris, and doubtless included the country north of the
Greater Zab, where Nineveh was situated. The exact
frontiers of Assyria, however, were never accurately
fixed. They varied with the military power and con



24 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
quests of its monarchs. Sometimes portions of the plateau of Mesopotamia on the west were comprehended
within it, as well as the country through which the
Tigris flowed, as far south as the borders of Babylonia,
and as far north as the Kurdish mountains. At other
times Assyria was confined to the narrow space within
which its great cities stood.
The -inhabitants of Assyria belonged to the Semitic
stock, that is to say, they were allied in blood and
language to the Hebrews, the Aramaeans, and the
Arabs, The older population had been either expelled
or destroyed. The Assyrians thus differed from the
Babylonians, who were a mixed race, partly Semitic
and partly non-Semitic. The non-Semitic element is
generally termed Accadian ; it spoke agglutinative
dialects, and was the original possessor of the plain
of Chaldaea. The Accadians invented the cuneiform
system of writing, founded the chief cities and civilisa
tion of Babylonia, and erected the earliest Babylonian
monuments with which we are acquainted. It was only
gradually that they yielded to the advance of the
Semites ; in fact, the final triumph of the Semites in
Babylonia was only effected by their amalgamation
with the old population of the country, and their com
plete acceptance of Accadian culture. The Accadian
language lingered long, and when it died out was pre
served as a learned language, like Latin in our own day,
which every educated Babylonian was expected to know.
It was natural, therefore, that the pure-blooded



THE COUNTRY AND PEOPLE. 25
Semites of Assyria and the mixed population of Baby
lonia should differ from one another in many respects.
The Babylonians were agriculturists, fond of literature
and peaceful pursuits. The Assyrians, on the contrary,
have been appropriately termed the Romans of the
East : they were a military people, caring for little else
save war and trade. Their literature, like their culture
and art, was borrowed from Babylonia, and they never
took kindly to it. Even under the magnificent patron
age of Assur-bani-pal, Assyrian literature was an
exotic. It was cultivated only by the few ; whereas in
Babylonia the greater part of the population seems to
have been able to read and write. If the Assyrian was
less luxurious than his Babylonian neighbour, he was
also less humane. Indeed, the Assyrian annals glory in
the record of a ferocity at which we stand aghast. On
the other hand, the Assyrian was not so superstitious as
the Babylonian, though he ascribed his successes to the
favour of Assur, and impaled the inhabitants of con
quered towns or burnt them alive because they did riot
believe in his national deity. He was, as Nahum
declared, the lion which ‘ did tear in pieces enough for
his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled
his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.’
Assyria was so wholly a military power, that the
destruction of Nineveh not only destroyed the Assyrian
Empire but blotted out the Assyrian nation itself.
When ‘the gates of the rivers’ of Nineveh—the Tigris
and Khusur—were opened, and ‘ the palace dissolved,’



26 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
Assyria ceased to exist. In the Sassanian period the
mounds which covered the ruins of the old city were for
a short time occupied by the houses of a village, but
these, too, disappeared after a while, and the very site
of Nineveh remained for centuries unknown. Rich, in
1 8 1 8, conjectured that the mounds of Kouyunjik, oppo
site the modern town of Mosul, concealed its ruins
beneath them, but it was not until the excavations of
the Frenchman Botta, in 1842, and the Englishman Layard, in 1845, that the remains first of Dur-Sargon,
and then of Nineveh itself, were revealed to the eyes of
a wondering world. The capital of the Assyrian Empire
was recovered, and with it the sculptured monuments of
its kings, and the relics of its clay-inscribed library.
The discovery came at an opportune moment. The
cuneiform inscriptions of Persia had at last yielded up
their secrets to the patient sagacity of European
scholars, and had furnished the key to other inscriptions,
-—also in cuneiform characters, but of a wholly different
kind, and expressing a wholly different language—which
now proved to be the long-lost records of the Assyrian
people. Little by little the records were deciphered ;
fresh expeditions to the buried cities of Assyria and
Babylonia returned to Europe with fresh spoils, and it
is now possible to describe the history and even the
daily life and thoughts of a people who but half a
century ago were but a mere name. The following
pages are intended to give a picture of that history and
life.



CHAPTER II.
Assyrian History.
Assyrian history, as we have seen, begins with the
patesis or viceroys of the city of Assur. We know little about them except their names; contemporaneous annals
do not commence until Assyria has ceased to be the
dependency of a foreign power, and has become an
independent kingdom. It was in the 17th or 16th cen
tury before the Christian era that Bel-kapkapi first gave
himself the title of king. For two or three centuries
afterwards our chief information about the monarchy he
founded is derived from the relations, sometimes hostile
and sometimes peaceable, which his successors had with Babylonia. One of them, however, Rimmon-nirari I by
name (about B.C. 1320), has left us an inscription in
which he recounts the wars he waged against the Baby
lonians, the Kurds, the Aramaeans, and the Shuites,
nomad tribes who extended along the western bank of the Euphrates. It was his son, Shalmaneser I, to whom
the foundation of Calah is ascribed. P"or six generations
his descendants followed one another on the throne ;
then came Tiglath-Pileser I, who may be regarded as



28 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
the founder of the first Assyrian Empire. He carried his
arms as far as Cilicia and Malatiyeh on the west, and
the wild tribes of Kurdistan on the east ; he overthrew
the Moschi or Meshech, defeated the Hittites and their
Colchian allies, and erected a memorial of his conquests
at the sources of the Tigris. The Hittite city of Pethor,
at the junction of the Euphrates and Sajur, was gar
risoned with Assyrian soldiers, and at Arvad the As
syrian monarch symbolised his subjection of the Medi
terranean by embarking in a ship and killing a dolphin
in the sea. In Nineveh he established a botanical
garden, which he filled with the strange trees he had
brought back with him from his campaigns. In B.c. 1130
he marched into Babylonia, and, after a momentary
repulse at the hands of the Babylonian king, defeated
his antagonists on the banks of the Lower Zab. Baby
lonia was ravaged, and Babylon itself was captured.
With the death of Tiglath-Pileser I, Assyrian history
becomes for awhile obscure. The sceptre fell into feeble
hands, and the distant conquests of the empire were
lost. It was during this period of abeyance that the kingdom of David and Solomon arose in the west. The
Assyrian power did not revive until the reign of Assur
dan II, whose son, Rimmon-nirari II (b.c. 91 i

889),
and great-grandson, Assur-natsir-pal (B.C. 883 —858), led
their desolating armies through Western Asia, and
made the name of Assyria once more terrible to the
nations around them. Assur-natsir-pal was at once
one of the most ferocious and most energetic of the



ASSYRIAN HISTORY. 2 9
Assyrian kings. His track was marked by impalements,
by pyramids of human heads, and by other barbarities
too horrible to be described. But his campaigns reached
further than those of Tiglath-Pileser had done. Armenia,
Mesopotamia, and Kurdistan, were overrun again and
again ; the Babylonians were forced to sue for peace ;
Sangara, the Hittite king of Carchemish, paid tribute,
and the rich cities, of Phoenicia poured their offerings
into the treasury of Nineveh. The armies of Assyria
penetrated even to Nizir, where the ark of the Chaldsean
Noah was believed to have rested on the peak of
Rowandiz. In Assyria itself the cities were embellished
with the spoils of foreign conquest ; splendid palaces
were erected, and Calah, which had fallen into decay,
was restored. A library was erected there, and it
became the favourite residence of Assur-natsir-pal. He was, succeeded by his son Shalmaneser II, so
named, perhaps, after the original founder of Calah.
Shalmaneser’s military successes exceeded even those of
his father, and his long reign of thirty-five years marks
the climax of the first Assyrian Empire. His annals are chiefly to be found engraved on three monuments now
in the British Museum. One of these is a monolith from Kurkh, a place about twenty miles from Diarbekr.
The full-length figure of Shalmaneser is sculptured upon
it, and the surface of the stone is covered with the
inscription. Another monument is a small ‘ obelisk ’
of polished black stone, the upper part of which is
shaped like three ascending steps. Inscriptions run

round its four sides, as well as small bas-reliefs repre
senting the tribute offered to ‘the great king’ by
foreign states. Among the tribute-bearers are the
Israelitish subjects of ‘Jehu, son of Omri.’ The third
monument is one which was discovered in 1878 at
Balawat, about nine miles from Nimrud or Calah. It
consists of the bronze framework of two colossal doors,
of rectangular shape, twenty-two feet high and twenty
six feet broad. The doors opened into a temple, and
were made of wood, to which the bronze was fastened
by means of nails. The bronze was cut into bands,
which ran in a horizontal direction across the doors, and
were each divided into two lines of embossed reliefs.
These reliefs were hammered out, and not cast, and the
rudeness of their execution proves that they were the
work of native artists, and not of the Phoenician settlers
in Nineveh, of whose skill in such work we have several
specimens. Short texts are added to explain the reliefs,
so that the various campaigns and cities represented in
them can all be identified. Among the cities is the
Hittite capital Carchemish, and the warriors of Armenia
are depicted in a costume strikingly similar to that of
the ancient Greeks.
Shalmaneser s first campaign was against the restless
tribes of Kurdistan. He then turned northward, and fell upon the Armenian king of Van and the Manna or
Minni (see Jer. li. 27), who inhabited the country between the mountains of Kotur and Lake Urumiyeh. The
Hittites of Carchemish, with their allies from Cilicia and



ASSYRIAN HISTORY. 31
other neighbouring districts, were next compelled to sue
for peace, and the acquisition of Pethor, which had been
lost after Tiglath-Pileser’s death, again gave the Assy
rians the command of the ford over the Euphrates.
The result of this was, that in B.C. 854 Shalmaneser came into conflict with the kingdom of Hamath. The common danger had roused Hadadezer of Damascus,
called Benhaded II in the Bible, to make common cause
with Hamath, and a confederacy was formed to resist
the Assyrian advance. Among the confederates ‘ Ahab
of Israel’ is mentioned as furnishing the allies with
2,000 chariots and 10,000 infantry, But the confederacy
was shattered at Karkar or Aroer, although Shalmaneser
had himself suffered too severely to be able to follow up
his victory. For a time, therefore, Syria remained un
molested, and the Assyrian king turned his attention to
Babylonia, which he reduced to a state of vassalage,
under the pretext of assisting the Babylonian sovereign
against his rebel brother.
Twelve years, however, after the battle of Karkar, Shalmaneser was once more in the west. Hadadezer had been succeeded by Hazael on the throne of Damas
cus, and it was against him that the full flood of Assyrian power was turned. For some time he managed to stem
it, but in B.C. 841 he suffered a crushing defeat on the
heights of Shenir (see Deut. iii. 9), and his camp, along
with 1,121 chariots and 470 carriages, fell into the hands
of the Assyrians, who proceeded to besiege him in his
capital, Damascus. The siege, however, was soon raised,



3 2 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
and Shalmaneser contented himself with ravaging the Hauran and marching to Beyrout, where his image was
carved on the rocky promontory of Baal-rosh, at the
mouth of the Nahr el-Kelb. It was while he was in
this neighbourhood that the ambassadors of Jehu arrived
with offers of tribute and submission. The tribute, we
are told, consisted of ‘ silver, gold, a golden bowl, vessels
of gold, goblets of gold, pitchers of gold, a sceptre for
the king’s hand and spear-handles,’ and Jehu is errone
ously entitled ‘ the son of Omri.’
After the defeat of Hazael Shalmaneser’s expeditions
were only to distant regions like Phoenicia, Kappadokia,
and Armenia, for the sake of exacting tribute. No
further attempt was made at permanent conquest, and
after B.C. 834 the old king ceased to lead his armies in
person, the tartan or commander-in-chief taking his
pla,ce. Not long afterwards a revolt broke, out headed
by his. eldest son, who seems to have thought that he
would have little difficulty in wresting the sceptre from
the hands, of the enfeebled king. Twenty-seven cities,
including Nineveh and Assur, joined the revolt, which
was, however, finally put down by the energy and
military capacity of Shalmaneser’s second, son Samas
Rimm.on, who succeeded him soon afterwards (B.C.
823-—810). On his death he was followed by his son Rimmon-nirari III (810—781), who compelled Mariha
of Damascus to pay him tribute, as well as the
Phoenicians, Israelites, Edomites, and Philistines. But
the vigour of the dynasty wa.s beginning to fail. A few



ASSYRIAN HISTORY. 33
short reigns followed that of Rimmon-nirari, during which the first Assyrian Empire melted away. A formidable power arose in Armenia, the Assyrian armies
were driven to the frontiers of their own country, and
disaffection began to prevail in Assyria itself. At
length, on the 15th of June, B.C. 763, an eclipse of the
sun took place, and the city of Assur rose in revolt.
The revolt lasted three years, and before it could be
crushed the outlying provinces were lost. When
Assur-nirari, the last of his line, ascended the throne
in B.C. 753, the empire was already gone, and the
Assyrian cities themselves were surging with discontent.
Ten years later the final blow was struck ; the army
leclared itself against their monarch, and he and his
3 ynasty fell together. On the 30th of Iyyar of the year
B.C. 745, a military adventurer, Pul, seized the vacant
crown, and assumed the venerable name of Tiglath
Pileser.
If we may believe Greek tradition, Tiglath-Pileser II began life as a gardener. Whatever might have been
his origin, however, he proved to be a capable
ruler, a good general, and a far-sighted administrator.
He was the founder of the second Assyrian Empire,
which differed essentially from the first The first
empire was at best a loosely-connected military
organization ; campaigns were made into distant
countries for the sake of plunder and tribute, but little
effort was made to retain the districts that had been
conquered. Almost as soon as the Assyrian armies C



34 ASSYRIA : ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
were out of sight, the conquered nations shook off the
Assyrian yoke, and it was only in regions bordering on
Assyria that garrisons were left by the Assyrian king. And whenever the Assyrian throne was occupied by
a weak or unwarlike prince, even these were soon
destroyed or forced to retreat homewards. Tiglath
Pileser II, however, consolidated and organised the
conquests he made ; turbulent populations were deported from their old homes, and the empire was divided
into satrapies or provinces, each of which paid a fixed
annual tribute to the imperial exchequer. For the
first time in history the principle of centralisation was
carried out on a large scale, and a bureaucracy began
to take the place of the old feudal nobility of Assyria.
But the second Assyrian Empire was not only an
organised and bureaucratic one, it was also commercial.
In carrying out his schemes of conquest Tiglath
Pileser II was influenced by considerations of trade.
His chief object was to divert the commerce of Western
Asia into Assyrian hands. For this purpose every
effort was made to unite Babylonia with Assyria, to
overthrow the Hittites of Carchemish, who held the
trade of Asia Minor, as well as the high road to the
west, and to render Syria and the Phoenician cities
tributary. The policy inaugurated by Tiglath-Pileser
was successfully followed up by his successors.
Babylonia was the first to feel the results of the
change of dynasty at Nineveh. The northern part of it
was annexed to Assyria, and secured by a chain of



ASSYRIAN HISTORY. 35
fortresses. Tiglath-Pileser now attacked the Kurdish
tribes, who were constantly harassing the eastern frontier
of the kingdom, and chastised them severely, the
Assyrian army forcing its way through the fastnesses
of the Kurdish mountains into the very heart of Media.
But Ararat, or Armenia, was still a dangerous neighbour,
and accordingly Tiglath-Pileser’s next campaign was
against a confederacy of the nations of the north headed
by Sarduris of Van. The confederacy was utterly
defeated in Kommagene, 72,950' prisoners falling into
the hands of the Assyrians, and the way was opened
into Syria. In B.C. 742 the siege of Arpad (now Tel
Erfad) began, and lasted two years. Its fall brought
with it the submission of Northern Syria, and it was next
the turn of Hamath to be attacked. Hamath was in
alliance with Uzziah of Judah, and its king Eniel may
have been of Jewish extraction. But the alliance
availed nothing. Hamath was taken by storm, part of
its population transported to Armenia, and their places
taken by colonists from distant provinces of the empire,
while nineteen of the districts belonging to it were
annexed to Assyria. The kings of Syria now flocked
to render homage and offer tribute to the Assyrian
conqueror. Among them we read the names of Menahem of Samaria, Rezon of Syria, Hiram of Tyre, and Pisiris of Carchemish. This was the occasion when, as we learn from 2 Kings xv. 19, Menahem gave a thousand talents of silver to the Assyrian king Pul, the
name under which Tiglath-Pileser continued to be



36 ASSYRIA : ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
known m Babylonia, and, as the Old Testament informs
us, in Palestine also.
Three years later Ararat was again invaded. Van,
the capital, was blockaded, and though it successfully
resisted the Assyrians, the country was devastated far
and near for a space of 450 miles. It was long before
the Armenians recovered from the blow, and for the next
century they ceased to be formidable to Assyria.
Tiglath-Pileser’s northern frontier was now secure, and
he therefore gladly seized the opportunity of interfering
in the affairs of the west which was offered him by
Ahaz, the Jewish king. Ahaz, whom the Assyrian
inscriptions call Jehoahaz, had been hard pressed by Rezon off Damascus and Pekah of Israel, who had combined to overthrow the Davidic dynasty and place
a vassal prince, ‘the son of Tabeal,’ on the throne of
Jerusalem. Ahaz in his extremity called in the aid of
Tiglath-Pileser, offering him a heavy bribe and acknow
ledging his supremacy. Tiglath-Pileser accordingly
marched into Syria ; Rezon was utterly defeated in
battle and then besieged in Damascus, to which he had
escaped. Damascus was closely invested ; the trees in
its neighbourhood were cut down the districts dependent on it were ravaged, and forces were despatched
to punish the Israelites, Ammonites, Moabites, and
Philistines, who had been the allies of Rezon, Gilead
and Abel-beth-maachah being burnt, and the tribes
beyond the Jordan carried into captivity. The Philistine
cities were compelled to open fheir gates ; the king of



ASSYRIAN HISTORY. 37
Ashkelon committed suicide in order not to fall into the hands of the enemy, and Khanun of Gaza fled to
Egypt. At last in B.C. 732, after a siege of two years,
Damascus was forced by famine to surrender. Rezon
was slain, Damascus given over to plunder and ruin, and
its inhabitants transported to Kir. Syria became an
Assyrian province, and all its princes were summoned to
do homage to the conqueror, while Tyre was fined 150
talents of gold, or about ^400, 000. Among the princes
who attended the levee or ‘durbar’ was Ahaz, and it was while he was attending it that he saw the altar of
which he sent a pattern to Urijah the priest (2 Kings
xvi. 10).
All that now remained for Tiglath-Pileser to do was
to reduce Babylonia as he had reduced Syria. In
B.C. 731, accordingly, he marched again into Chaldaea.
Ukin-ziru, the Babylonian king, was slain, Babylon and
other great cities were taken, and in B.C. 7 29, under his
original name of Pul, Tiglath-Pileser assumed the title of
‘ king of Sumer (Shinar) and Accad.’
He lived only two years after this, and died in B.C.
727, when the crown was seized by Elulaeos of Tinu, who took the name of Shalmaneser IV. Shalmaneser’s
short reign was signalised by an unsuccessful attempt to
capture Tyre, and by the beginning of a war against the
kingdom of Israel. But the siege of Samaria was hardly commenced when Shalmaneser died, or was murdered, in B.C. 722, and was succeeded by another usurper who
assumed the name of Sargon, one of the most famous of



38 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
the early Babylonian kings. Sargon in his inscriptions
claims royal descent, but the claim was probably without
foundation. He proved to be an able general, though
his inscriptions show that he continued to the last to be
a rough but energetic soldier who had perhaps risen
from the ranks.
Two years after his accession (B.c. 720) Samaria was
taken and placed under an Assyrian governor, 27,280 of
its leading inhabitants being carried captive to Gozan
and Media. But Sargon soon found that the task of cementing and completing the empire founded by
Tiglath-Pileser was by no means an easy one. Babylonia had broken away from Assyria on the news of
Shalmaneser’s death, and had submitted itself to
Merodach-Baladan the hereditary chieftain of Beth
Yagina in the marshes on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
The southern portion of Sargon’s dominions was
threatened by the ancient and powerful kingdom of
Elam ; the Kurdish tribes on the east renewed their
depredations ; while the Hittite kingdom of Carchemish
still remained unsubdued, and the Syrian conquests
could with difficulty be retained. In fact, a new enemy
appeared in this part of the empire in the shape of
Egypt.
Sargon’s first act, therefore, was to drive the Elamites
back to their own country with considerable loss. He
was then recalled to the west by the revolt of Hamath,
where Yahu-bihdi, or Ilu-bihdi, whose name perhaps
indicates his Jewish parentage, had proclaimed himself



ASSYRIAN HISTORY. 39
king, and persuaded Arpad, Damascus, Samaria, and
other cities to follow his standard. But the revolt was
of short duration. Hamath was burnt, 4,300 Assyrians being sent to occupy its ruins, and Yahu-bihdi was
flayed alive. Sargon next marched along the sea-coast
to the cities ©f the Philistines. There the Egyptian
army was routed at Raphia, and its ally, Khanun of
Gaza, taken captive.
In B.C. 717 all was ready for dealing the final blow at
the Hittite power in Northern Syria. The rich trading
city of Carchemish was stormed, its last king, Pisiris,
fell into the hands of the Assyrians, and his Moschian
allies were forced to retreat to the north. The plunder
of Carchemish brought eleven talents and thirty manehs
of gold and 2,100 talents of silver into the treasury of
Calah. It was henceforth placed under an Assyrian
satrap, who thus held in his hands the key of the high
road and the caravan trade between Eastern and Western
Asia.
But Sargon was not allowed to retain possession of
Carchemish without a struggle. Its Hittite inhabitants
found avengers in the allied populations of the north, in
Meshech and Tubal, in Ararat and Minni. The struggle
lasted for six years, but in the end Sargon prevailed.
Van submitted, its king Ursa, the leader of the coalition
against Assyria, committed suicide, Cilicia and the Tibareni or Tubal were placed under an Assyrian governor, and the city of Malatiyeh was razed to the
ground. In B.C. 71 1, Sargon was at length free to



40 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
turn his attention to the west. Here affairs wore a
threatening aspect. Merodach-Baladan, foreseeing that
his own turn would come as soon as Sargon had firmly
established his power in Northern Syria, had despatched
ambassadors to the Mediterranean states, urging them to
combine with him against the common foe. We read in
the Bible of the arrival of the Babylonian embassy in
Jerusalem, and of the rebuke received by Hezekiah for
his vainglory in displaying to the strangers the resources
of his kingdom. In spite of Isaiah’s warning, Hezekiah
listened to the persuasions of the Babylonian envoys,
and encouraged by the promise of Egyptian support
along with Phoenicia, Moab, Edom, and the Philistines,
determined to defy the Assyrian king.
But before the confederates were ready to act in
concert Sargon descended upon Palestine. Phoenicia
and Judah were overrun, Jerusalem was captured, and Ashdod burnt, while the Egyptians made no attempt to
help their friends. This siege of Ashdod is the only
occasion on which the name of Sargon occurs in the
Bible (Isaiah xx. i). As soon as all source of danger
was removed in the west Sargon hurled his forces against Babylonia. Merodach-Baladan had made every
preparation to meet the coming attack, and the Elamite king had engaged to help him. But the Elamites were
again compelled to fly before the warriors of Assyria,
and Sargon entered Babylon in triumph (b.C. 710). The following year he pursued Merodach-Baladan to
his ancestral stronghold in the marshes ; Beth- Vagina



ASSYRIAN HISTORY. 41
was taken by storm, and its unfortunate defenders were
sent in chains to Nineveh. Sargon was now at the height of his power. His empire was a compact and
consolidated whole, reaching from the Mediterranean on
the west to the mountains of Elam on the east, and his
solemn coronation at Babylon gave a title to his claim to
be the legitimate successor of the ancient Sargon of Accad. The old kingdoms of Elam and Egypt alone remained to threaten the newly-founded empire, which
received the voluntary homage of the smaller states that
lay immediately beyond it. Thus the sacred island of
Dilvun in the Persian Gulf submitted itself to the terrible
conqueror, and the Phoenicians of Kition or Chittim
in Cyprus erected a monumental record of his supre
macy. Sargon’s end was consonant with his whole career.
He was murdered by his soldiers in his new city of Dur-Sargon or Khorsabad, on the 12th of Ab or July,
B.C. 705, and was succeeded by his son Sennacherib. If we may judge from Sennacherib’s name, which means
‘ the Moon-god has increased the brothers,’ he would
not have been Sargon’s eldest son. In any case he had
been brought up in the purple, and displayed none of the
rugged virtues of his father. He was weak, boastful, and
cruel, and preserved his empire only by the help of the
veterans and generals whom Sargon had trained. Merodach-Baladan had escaped from captivity, and two years after the death of Sargon had once more
possessed himself of Babylon. But a battle at Kis



42 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
drove him from the country nine months subsequently,
and Sennacherib was able to turn his attention to affairs
in the west. In B.C. 701, he marched into Phoenicia and
Palestine, where Hezekiah of Judah and some of the
neighbouring kings had refused their tribute. Tirhakah,
the Ethiopian king of Egypt, had promised support to
the rebellious states, and Padi, the king of Ekron, who
remained faithful to the Assyrians, was carried in chains
to Jerusalem. The Assyrian army fell first upon
Phoenicia. Great and Little Sidon, Sarepta, Acre, and
other towns, surrendered, Elulaeos, the Sidonian
monarch, fled to Cyprus, and the kings of Arvad and
Gebal offered homage. Metinti of Ashdod, Pedael of Ammon, Chemosh-nadab of Moab, and Melech-ram of Edom, also submitted. Then, says Sennacherib
:
‘ Zedekiah, king of Ashkelon, who had not submitted to
my yoke, himself, the gods of the house of his fathers,
his wife, his sons, his daughters, and his brothers, the
seed of the house of his fathers, I. removed, and I sent
him to Syria. I set over the men of Ashkelon Sarluaari,
the son of Rukipti, their former king, and I imposed
upon him the payment of tribute, and the homage due
to my majesty, and he became a vassal. In the course
of my campaign I approached and captured Beth
Dagon, Joppa, Bene-berak, and Azur, the cities of
Zedekiah, which did not submit at once to my yoke, and
I carried away their spoil. The priests, the chief men, and the common people of Ekron who had thrown into
chains their king Padi because he was faithful to his



ASSYRIAN HISTORY. 43
oaths to Assyria, and had given him up to Hezekiah,
the Jew, who imprisoned him like an enemy in a dark
dungeon, feared in their hearts. The king of Egypt, the
bowmen, the chariots, and the horses of the king of
Ethiopia, had gathered together innumerable forces, and
gone to their assistance. In sight of the town of
Eltekeh was their order of battle drawn up ; they called
their troops (to the battle). Trusting in Assur, my lord,
I fought with them and overthrew them. My hands
took the captains of the chariots, and the sons of the king
of Egypt, as well as the captains of the chariots of the
king of Ethiopia, alive in the midst of the battle. I
approached and captured the towns of Eltekeh and Timnath, and I carried away their spoil. I marched
against the city of Ekron, and put to death the priests and the chief men who had committed the sin (of
rebellion), and I hung up their bodies on stakes all round the city. The citizens who had done wrong and
wickedness I counted as a spoil ; as for the rest of them who had done no sin or crime, in whom no fault was
found, I proclaimed a free pardon. I had Padi, their
king, brought out from the midst of Jerusalem, and
1 seated him on the throne of royalty over them, and
I laid upon him the tribute due to my majesty. But
as for Hezekiah of Judah, who had not submitted to
my yoke, forty-six of his strong cities, together with
innumerable fortresses and small towns which depended on them, by overthrowing the walls and open attack, by
battle engines and battering-rams, I besieged, I captured,



44 ASSYRIA : ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
I brought out from the midst of them and counted as a
spoil 200,150 persons, great and small, male and female,
horses, mules, asses, camels, oxen and sheep without
number. Hezekiah himself I shut up like a bird in a
cage in Jerusalem, his royal city. I built a line of forts
against him, and I kept back his heel from going forth
out of the great gate of his city. I cut off his cities that
I had spoiled from the midst of his land, and gave them
to Metinti, king of Ashdod, Padi, king of Ekron, and
Zil-baal, king of Gaza, and I made his country small. In
addition to their former tribute and yearly gifts, I added
other tribute, and the homage due to my majesty, and
I laid it upon them. The fear of the greatness of my
majesty overwhelmed him, even Hezekiah, and he sent
after me to Nineveh, my royal city, by way of gift and
tribute, the Arabs and his body-guard whom he had
brought for the defence of Jerusalem, his royal city, and
had furnished with pay, along with thirty talents of
gold, 800 talents of pure silver, carbuncles and other
precious stones, a couch of ivory, thrones of ivory, an
elephant’s hide, an elephant’s tusk, rare woods of various
names, a vast treasure, as well as the eunuchs of his palace, dancing-men and dancing-women ; and he sent
his ambassador to offer homage.’
In this account of his campaign Sennacherib discreetly
says nothing about the disaster which befell his army
in front of Jerusalem, and which obliged him to return
ignominiously to Assyria without attempting to capture
Jerusalem, and to deal with Hezekiah as it was his



ASSYRIAN HISTORY. 45
custom to deal with other rebellious kings. The tribute
offered by Hezekiah at Lachish, when he vainly tried to
buy off the threatened Assyrian attack, is represented
as having been the final result of a successful campaign.
There is, however, no exaggeration in the amount of
silver Sennacherib claims to have received, since 800
talents of silver are equivalent to the 500 talents stated by
the Bible to have been given, when reckoned according to
the standard of value in use at the time in Nineveh.
Sennacherib never recovered from the blow he had
suffered in Judah. He made no more expeditions
against Palestine, and during the rest of his reign
Judah remained unmolested. Babylonia, moreover,
gave him constant trouble. In the year after his
campaign in the west (B.G 700) a Chaldean, named
Nergal-yusezib, stirred up a revolt which Sennacherib
had some difficulty in suppressing. Two years later
he appointed his eldest son, Assur-nadin-sumi, viceroy of Babylon. In B.G 694, he determined to attack the
followers of Merodach-Baladan in their last retreat at
the mouth of the Eulaeus, where land had been given
to them by the Elamite king after their expulsion from Babylonia. Ships were built and manned by Phoenicians
in the Persian Gulf, by means of which the settlements
of the Chaldean refugees were burnt and destroyed. Meanwhile, however, Babylonia itself was invaded by
the Elamites ; the Assyrian viceroy was carried into
captivity, and Nergal-yusezib placed on the throne of
the country. He defeated the Assyrian forces in a



46 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
battle near Nipur, but died soon afterwards, and was
followed by Musezib-Merodach, who like his pre
decessor is called Suzub in Sennacherib’s inscriptions.
He defied the Assyrian power for nearly four years.
But in B.C. 690 the combined Babylonian and Elamite
army was overthrown in the decisive battle of Khalule,
and before another year was past Sennacherib had
captured Babylon, and given it up to fire and sword.
Its inhabitants were sold into slavery, and the waters
of the A raxes canal allowed to flow over its ruins.
Sennacherib now assumed the title of king of Babylonia,
but with the exception of a campaign into the Cilician mountains he seems to have undertaken no more
military expeditions. The latter years of his life were
passed in constructing canals and aqueducts, in
embanking the Tigris, and in rebuilding the palace of Nineveh on a new and sumptuous scale. On the
20th of Tebet, or December, B.C. 681, he was murdered
by his two elder sons, Adrammelech and Nergal-sharezer,
who were jealous of the favour shown to their younger
brother, Esar-haddon. Esar-haddon was at the time conducting a campaign against Erimenas, king of Armenia, to whom his
insurgent brothers naturally fled. Between seven and
eight weeks after the murder of the old king, a battle
was fought near Malatiyeh, in Kappadokia, between
the veterans of Esar-haddon and the forces under his brothers and Erimenas, which ended in the complete
defeat of the latter. Esar-haddon was proclaimed king,



ASSYRIAN HISTORY. 47
and the event proved that a wiser choice could not have
been made. His military genius was of the first order, but it was
equalled by his political tact He was the only king of
Assyria who endeavoured to conciliate the nations he
had conquered. Under him the fabric of the Second Empire was completed by the conquest of Egypt. In the
first year of his reign he rebuilt Babylon, giving it back its
captured deities, its plunder, and its people. Henceforth
Babylon became the second capital of the empire, the
court residing alternately there and at Nineveh. It was
while Esar-haddon was holding his winter court at Babylon that Manasseh, of Judah, was brought to him
as prisoner.1
The trade of Phoenicia was diverted into Assyrian
hands by the destruction of Sidon. The caravan-road
from east to west was at the same time rendered secure
by an expedition into the heart of Northern Arabia.
Here Esar-haddon penetrated as , far as the lands of
Huz and Buz, 280 miles of the march being through
a waterless desert. The feat has never been excelled,
and the terror it inspired among the Bedouin tribes was
not forgotten for many years. The northern frontiers
of the kingdom were also made safe by the defeat of Teispes, the Kimmerian, who was driven westward with
his hordes into Asia Minor. In the east the Assyrian monarch was bold enough to occupy and work the
copper-mines on the distant borders of Media, the very

name of which had scarcely been heard of before. Westward, the kings of Cyprus paid homage to the
great conqueror, and among the princes who sent
materials for his palace at Nineveh were Cyprian rulers
with Greek names.
But the principal achievement of Esar-haddon’s reign
was his conquest of the ancient monarchy of Egypt.
In B.C. 675 the Assyrian army started for the banks of
the Nile. Four years later Memphis was taken on the
22nd of Tammuz, or June, and Tirhakah, the Egyptian
king, compelled to fly first to Thebes, and then into
Ethiopia. Egypt was divided into twenty satrapies,
governed partly by Assyrians, partly by native princes,
whose conduct was watched by Assyrian garrisons. On
his return to Assyria Esar-haddon associated Assur
bani-pal, the eldest of his four sons, in the government
on the 1 2th of Iyyar, or April, B.C. 669, and died two
years afterwards (on the 12th of Marchesvan, or
October), when again on his way to Egypt. Assur
bani-pal, the Sardanapalos of the Greeks, succeeded
to the empire, his brother, Samas-sum-yukin, being
entrusted with the government of Babylonia.
Assur-bani-pal is probably the ‘ great and noble ’
Asnapper of Ezra iv. 10. He was luxurious, ambitious,
and cruel, but a munificent patron of literature. The
libraries of Babylonia were ransacked for ancient texts,
and scribes were kept busily employed at Nineveh in
inscribing new editions of older works. But unlike his
fathers, Assur-bani-pal refused to face the hardships of

a campaign. His armies were led by generals, who were required to send despatches from time to time to the
king. It was evident that a purely military empire, like
that of Assyria, could not last long, when its ruler had
himself ceased to take an active part in military affairs.
At first the veterans of his father preserved and even
extended the empire of Assur-bani-pal ; but before his
death it was shattered irretrievably. It is characteristic
of Assur-bani-pal that his lion-hunts were mere battues,
in which tame animals were released from cages and
lashed to make them run ; in curious contrast to the
lion-hunts in the open field in which his warlike prede
cessors had delighted.
His first occupation was to crush a revolt in Egypt.
Tirhakah was once more driven out of the country, and
Thebes, called Ni in the Assyrian texts, and No-Amon,
or ‘No of the god Amun ’ in Scripture, was plundered
and destroyed. Its temples were hewed in pieces, and
two of its obelisks, weighing 70 tons in all, were carried
as trophies to Nineveh. It is to this destruction of the
old capital of the Pharaohs that Nahum refers in his
prophecy (iii. 8).
Meanwhile Tyre had been besieged and forced to surrender, and Cilicia had paid homage to the Assyrian
king. Gog, or Gyges, of Lydia, too, voluntarily sent
him tribute, including two Kimmerian chieftains whom
the Lydian sovereign had captured in battle. When the Lydian ambassadors arrived in Nineveh they found
no one who could understand their language ; in fact, D2

the very name of Lydia had been unknown to the
Assyrians before.
The Assyrian Empire had now reached its widest
limits. Elam had fallen after a long and arduous
struggle. Shushan, its capital, was razed to the ground,
and the three last Elamite kings were bound to the yoke
of Assur-bani-pal’s chariot, and made to drag their con
queror through the streets of Nineveh. The Kedarites
and other nomad tribes of Northern Arabia were also
chastised, the land of the Minni was overrun, and the
Armenians of Van begged for an alliance with the
Assyrian king.
But while at the very height of his prosperity, the
empire was fast slipping away from under Assur-bani
pal’s feet. In B.C. 652 a rebellion broke out headed
by his brother, the Babylonian viceroy, which shook it
to the foundations. Babylonia, Egypt, Palestine, and
Arabia made common cause against the oppressor.
Lydia sent Karian and Ionic mercenaries to Psam
metikhos of Sais, with whose help he succeeded in over
throwing his brother satraps, and in delivering Egypt
from the Assyrian yoke. The revolt in Babylonia took
long to quell, and for a time the safety of Assur-bani-pal
himself was imperilled. At last in 647 Babylon and Cuthah were reduced by famine, and Samas-sum-yukin
burnt himself to death in his palace. Fire and sword
were carried through Elam, and the last of its monarchs
became an outlawed fugitive.



ASSYRIAN HISTORY. 53
When Assyria finally emerged from the deadly
struggle, Egypt was lost to it for ever, and Babylonia
was but half subdued. The latter province was placed under the government of Kandalanu, who ruled over it for twenty-two years, more like an independent sovereign
than a viceroy. His successor, Nabopolassar, the father
of Nebuchadnezzar, threw off all semblance of submis- '
sion to Nineveh, and prepared the way for the empire of his son. But meanwhile the once proud kingdom of Assyria had been contending for bare existence.
Assur-bani-pal’s son, Assur-etil-ilani, rebuilt with dimi
nished splendour the palace of Calah, which seems to have been burnt by some victorious enemy ; and when the last Assyrian king, Esar-haddon II, called Sarakos
by the Greeks, mounted the throne, he found himself
surrounded on all sides by threatening foes. Kaztarit or Kyaxares, Mamitarsu the Median, the Kimmerians, the
Minni, and the people of Sepharad leagued themselves
together against the devoted city of Nineveh. The frontier towns fell first, and though Esar-haddon in
his despair proclaimed public fasts and prayers to the
gods, nothing could ward off the doom pronounced by God’s prophets against Nineveh so long before.
Nineveh was besieged, captured, and utterly destroyed ; and the second Assyrian Empire perished more hope
lessly and completely than the first. All that survived
was the old capital of the country, Assur, whose former inhabitants were allowed to return to it by Cyrus at the

time when the Jewish exiles also were released from
their captivity in Babylon. 1

CHAPTER III.
Assyrian Religion.
The Assyrians derived the greater part of their deities
and religious beliefs, like their literature and culture
generally, from Babylonia. The Babylonian gods were
the gods of Assyria also. Most of them were of
Accadian or prae-Semitic origin, but the Semitic Baby
lonians, when they appropriated the civilisation of the
Accadians, modified them in accordance with their own
conceptions. The Accadians believed that every object and phenomenon of nature had its Zi or ‘ spirit/ some
of them beneficent, others hostile to man, like the objects
and phenomena they represented. Naturally, however,
there were more malevolent than beneficent spirits in the
universe, and there was scarcely an action which did not
risk demoniac possession. Diseases were due to the
malevolence of these spirits, and could be cured only by the use of certain charms and exorcisms. Exorcisms, in fact, gave those who employed them power over the
spirits ; they could by means of them compel the evil
spirit to retire, and the beneficent spirit to approach.
The knowledge of such exorcisms was in the hands of
the priests, so that priest and magician were almost synonymous terms.



56 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
Among the multitude of spirits feared by the
Accadians, there were some which had been raised
above the rest into the position of gods. Of these, Anu,
‘ the sky ;
’ Mul-ge, ‘ the earth ;
’ and Ea, ‘ the deep/
were the most conspicuous. At their side stood the
‘ spirits * of the heavenly bodies—the Moon-god, the
Sun-god, the evening star, and the other planets. The
Moon-god ranked before the Sun-god, as might indeed
have been expected to be the case among a nation of
astronomers like the Chaldeans.
When the Semitic Babylonians adopted the deities of
their predecessors and teachers, Anu and his compeers
lost much of their elemental nature, while the Sun-god
Samas came to assume an important place. The religion
of the Babylonian Semites, in fact, was essentially solar ;
the Sun-god was addressed as Bel or Baal, the supreme
‘lord/ and adored under various forms. He appeared
to them, moreover, under two aspects, sometimes as the
kindly deity who gives life and light to all things,
sometimes as the scorching sun of summer who
demanded the sacrifice of the first-born to appease his
wrath. Sometimes, again, he was worshipped as the
young and beautiful Tammuz, slain by the boar’s tusk
of winter ; whose death was lamented at the autumnal
equinox, and who was invoked as adoni {Adonis) or
‘ master/
Unlike the Accadians, who did not distinguish
gender, the Semites divided all nouns into masculines
and feminines. By the side of the god, consequently,



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 57
stood the goddess. She was, however, but a pale
reflection of her male consort, created, so to speak, by the necessities of grammar. She had no independent
attributes of her own ; Beltis, or Bilat, the wife of Bel,
was nothing more than the feminine complement of the
god. The Accadians had known of one great goddess, Istar, the evening star ; but Istar was an independent
deity, with attributes as strongly and individually
marked as those of the gods. Among the Semites,
Istar became Ashtoreth, with the feminine sufflx th.
and though in Babylonia the old legends and traditions
prevented her from losing altogether her primitive
character, she tended more and more to pass into the
mere reflection of some male deity. Just as the gods
could be collectively spoken of as Baalim or ‘ lords,’ all
being regarded as so many different forms of the Sun
god, the goddesses also were termed Ashtaroth or
‘ Ashtoreths.’
We see, therefore, that in adopting the pantheon of
Accad, the Semites made three important changes. The
Sun-god was assigned a leading place in worship and
belief ; female deities were introduced, who were, how
ever, mere reflections of the gods ; while the inferior
deities of the Accadians were classed among * the 300
spirits of heaven ’ and * the 600 spirits of earth,’ only a
few of the more prominent ones retaining their old
position. These latter may be grouped as follows :
At the head of the divine hierarchy still stood the old
triad of Anu, Mul-ge, and Ea. Mul-ge’s name, however,



58 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
was changed to Bel, but since Merodach was also known
as Bel, he fell more and more into the background,
especially after the rise of Babylon, of which city
Merodach was the patron deity. At Nipur, now Niffer,
alone, he continued to be worshipped down into late
times. His consort was Bilat, or Beltis, ‘the great lady/
who eventually came to be regarded as the wife of
Merodach rather than of ‘ the other Bel.’ Like Anu and
Ea, Bel was the offspring of Sar and Kisar, the upper
and lower firmaments.
Anu was the visible sky, but he also represented the
invisible heaven, which was supposed to extend above
the visible one, and to be the abode of the gods. The
chief seat of his worship was Erech, where he was
regarded as the oldest of the gods, and the original
creator of the universe. But elsewhere, also, he was
looked upon as the creator of the visible world, and the
father of the gods. By his side, in the Semitic period,
stood the goddess Anat, whose attributes were derived from his. The worship of Anat spread from Babylonia
to the Canaanites, as is shown by the geographical
names Beth Anath, ‘the temple of Anat’ (Josh. xix. 38 ;
xv. 59), and Anathoth, the city of ‘ the goddesses Anat.’
It was even introduced into Egypt after the Asiatic
wars of the eighteenth dynasty. In the prae-Semitic days
of Chaldea, a monotheistic school had flourished, which
resolved the various deities of the Accadian belief into
manifestations of the one supreme god, Anu ; and old
hymns exist in which reference is made to ‘the one



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 59
god.’ But this school never seems to have numbered
many adherents, and it eventually died out. Its exist
ence, however, reminds us of the fact that Abraham was
born in ‘ Ur of the Chaldees/
Ea originally represented the ocean-stream or ‘ great
deep,’ which was supposed to surround the earth like a
serpent, and by which all rivers and springs were fed.
He was symbolised by the snake, and was held to be
the creator and benefactor of mankind. One of his
most frequent titles is ‘ lord of wisdom/ and the chief
seat of his worship was at Eridu, ‘ the holy city/ near
which was the sacred grove or * garden/ the centre of the
world, where the tree of life and knowledge had its roots.
It was Ea who had given to mankind not only life, but
all the arts and appliances of culture also, and it was his help that the Babylonian invoked when in trouble. He was emphatically the god of healing, who had revealed
medicines to mankind. As god of the great deep, he
was often figured as a man with the tail of a fish, and in this form was known to the Greeks under the name of
Oannes or ‘ Ea the fish/ Sometimes the skin of a fish was suspended behind his back. Oannes, it was said,
had in early days ascended out of the Persian Gulf, and
taught the first inhabitants of Babylonia letters, science,
and art, besides writing a history of the origin of man
kind and their different ways of life. His wife was
Dav-kina, ‘the lady of the earth/ who presided over
the lower world.
Among the numerous offspring of Ea and Dav-kina,



66 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS^ AND PEOPLE.
Merodach held the foremost place. He was originally a
form of the Sun-god, regarded under his beneficent
aspect, and was believed to be ever engaged in combating
the powers of evil, and in performing services for man
kind. Hence he is addressed as ‘ the redeemer of
mankind/ ‘ the restorer to life,’ and the ‘ raiser from the
dead/ and a considerable number of the religious hymns
are dedicated to him. He was believed to be continually
passing backwards and forwards between the earth and
the heaven where Ea dwelt, informing Ea of the suffer
ings of men, and returning with Ea’s directions how to
relieve them. One of the bas-reliefs from Nineveh, now
in the British Museum, represents him as pursuing with
his curved sword or thunderbolt the demon Tiamat, the
personification of chaos and anarchy, who is depicted
with claws, tail, and horns. As we have already seen,
he was commonly addressed as Bel or ‘ lord/ and so
came gradually to supplant the older Bel or Mul-ge.
Among the planets his star was Jupiter. His wife was
Zarpanit or Zirat-panitu, in whom some scholars have
seen the Succoth-benoth of 2 Kings xvii. 30. The children of Merodach and Zarpanit were Nebo,
‘the prophet/ and his wife Tasmit, ‘the hearer/ Nebo
was the god of oratory and literature ; it was he who
‘ enlightened the eyes ’ to understand written characters,
while his wife ‘enlarged the ears/ so that they could
comprehend what was read. The origin of the cuneiform
system of writing was ascribed to Nebo. To him was
dedicated ‘ the temple of the Seven Lights of Heaven



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. .6

and Earth,’ at Borsippa, the suburb of Babylon, which is
now known to the Arabs as the Birs-i-Nimrud, and his
worship was carried as far as Canaan, as we may gather
from such names as the city of Nebo, in Judaea (Ezra ii.
29), and Mount Nebo, in Moab (Deut. xxxii. 49). In
Accadian he had been called Dimsar, ‘ the tablet-writer,’
and a temple was erected to him in the island of
Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf, where he was worshipped under the name of Enzak. As a planetary deity, he was
identified with Mercury. He was often adored under
the name of Nusku, although Nusku had originally been
a separate divinity, and the same, perhaps, as the
Nisroch of the Bible (2 Kings xix. 37). The companion of Merodach was Rimmon, or rather
Ramman, ‘ the thunderer.’ He represented the atmo
sphere, and was accordingly the god of rain and storm,
who was armed with the lightning and the thunderbolt.
Sometimes he was dreaded as ‘ the destroyer of crops,’
‘ the scatterer of the harvest at other times prayers
were made to him as ‘the lord of fecundity.’ His worship extended into Syria, where Rimmon appears to have been the supreme deity of Damascus, and where he was also known under the name of Hadad or Dadda.
Two other elemental gods were Samas, the Sun-god, and Sin, the Moon-god. Samas was the son of Sin, in
accordance with the astronomical view of the old Babylonians, which made the moon the measurer of
time, and regarded the day as the offspring of night.
Samas, however, like Saul or Savul, another deity of



62 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
whom mention is made in the inscriptions, was really
but a form of Merodach, though in historical times the
two divinities were separated from one another, and
received different cults. Samas, again, was originally
identical with Tammuz ; but when Tammuz came to denote only the sun of spring and summer, while the
myth that associated him with Istar laid firm hold
of men’s minds, Tammuz assumed separate attributes,
and an individual existence apart from Samas. Sin, the Moon-god, was termed Agu or Acu by the
Accadians, and if the name of Mount Sinai was derived
from him, as is sometimes supposed, we should have
evidence that he was known and worshipped in Northern
Arabia. At all events he was one of the deities of
Southern Arabia. Sin was the patron-god of the city of
Ur, and it was to him that the Assyrian kings traced
the formation of their kingdom. One of the most famous
of his temples was in the ancient city of Harran, where
he was symbolised by an upright cone of stone. As the emblem of the Sun-god was the solar orb, the emblem
of Sin was the crescent moon.
According to some of the legends of Babylonia, the
daughter of the Moon-god was the goddess Istar. Other
legends, however, placed Istar among the older gods,
and made her the daughter of Anu, the sky. In either
case she was at the outset the goddess of the evening
star, and when it was discovered that the evening and
morning stars were the same, of the morning star also.
As the evening star, she was known as Istar of Erech, as



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 63
the morning star, she was identified with Anunit or Anat, the goddess of Accad. At times she was also regarded as androgynous, both male and female.
Istar was the chief of the Accadian goddesses, and she
retained her rank even among the Semites, who, as we
have seen, looked upon the goddess as the mere consort
and shadow of the god. But Istar continued to the last
a separate and independent divinity. She presided over
love and war, as well as over the chase. She was
invoked as * the queen of heaven,’ ‘the queen of all the
gods,’ and there was often a tendency to merge in her
the other goddesses of the pantheon. Her principal
temples were at Erech, Nineveh, and Arbela, but altars
were erected to her in almost every place, and she was
adored under as many forms and titles as she possessed shrines. Her name and worship spread through the
Semitic world, in Southern Arabia, in Syria, in Moab,
where she was identified with the Sun-god, Chemosh,
and in Canaan, where she was called Ashtoreth, the
Astarte of the Greeks. But the Greeks also knew her as
Aphrodite, the goddess whom they had borrowed from the Phoenicians of Canaan, and we may discover her
again in the Ephesian Artemis. The rites performed in
her temples made Istar or Ashtoreth the darkest blot in Assyrian and Canaanitish religion, and excited the
utmost horror and indignation of the prophets of God.
When the moon came to be conceived as a female
divinity, the pale reflection, as it were, of the sun, Istar,
the evening star, became also the goddess of the moon.



64 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
Hence it is that ‘the queen of heaven’ (Jer. xliv. 17)
passed into Astarte ‘ with crescent horns.’
One of the most popular of old Babylonian myths told
how Istar had wedded the young and beautiful Sun-god,
Tammuz, ‘the only-begotten,’ and had descended into
Hades in search of him when he had been slain by the
boar’s tusk of winter. A portion of a Babylonian poem
has been preserved to us, which describes her passage
through the seven gates of the underworld, where she
left with the warden of each some one of her adornments,
until at last she reached the seat of the infernal goddess
Ailat, stripped and bare. There she remained imprisoned
until the gods, wearied of the long absence of the goddess
of love, created a hound called ‘ the renewal of light/
who restored her to the upper world. The myth clearly refers to the waning and waxing of the monthly moon,
and must therefore have originated when Istar had
already become the goddess of the moon. The myth
entered deeply into the religious belief of the worshippers
of Istar. The Accadians called the month of August
‘the month of the errand of Istar,’ while June was
termed ‘the month of Tammuz’ by the Semites. It was
then that, as Milton writes, his
‘annual wound in Lebanon allured
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate In amorous ditties all a summer’s day
;
While smooth Adonis from his native rock
Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood
Of Tammuz yearly wounded.’



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 65
But it was not only in Assyria and Phoenicia that the death of Tammuz was lamented by the women year by
year. The infection spread to Judah also, and even in
Jerusalem, within the precincts of the temple itself, Ezekiel saw ‘women weeping for Tammuz’ (Ezek.
viii. 14).
Nergal. CFrom the original in the British Museum.)
There are only two other Assyro-Babylonian deities who need be mentioned, Nergal and Adar. Nergal was the presiding deity of Cuthah and its vast necropolis. 1
He shared with Anu the privilege of superintending the
regions of the dead,, and he was also a god of hunting and war. His name, like those of Anu, Ea, and Istar,
1 Confer 2 Kings xvii. 30*



66 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
was of Accadian origin. Adar, the son of Beltis, was one of those solar deities who were formed by worshipping
the Sun-god under some particular attribute. The
reading of his name is, unfortunately, not certain, and
Adar is only its most probable pronunciation. If it is
correct, Adar will be the deity meant in 2 Kings xvii.
31, where it is stated that the people of Sepharvaim, or
the two Sipparas, burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, that is to say, to ‘ King Adar ’ and 4 King Anu.’
Such were the principal divinities of Babylonia and
Assyria. But the Assyrians had another also, whom
they exalted above all the rest. This was Assur, the
divine impersonation of the state and empire. It was
Assur who, according to the Assyrian kings, led them to
victory, and the cruelties they practised on the conquered
were, they held, judgments exercised against those who
would not believe in him. Assur, in the form of an
archer, is sometimes represented on the monuments in
the midst of the winged solar disk, and above the head
of the monarch, whom he protects from his enemies.
The Assyrian, however, was not so pious or super
stitious as his Babylonian neighbour. The Babylonian
lived in perpetual dread of the evil spirits which thronged
about him ; almost every moment had its religious
ceremony, almost every action its religious complement.
Not only had the State ritual to be attended to; the
unceasing attacks of the demons could be warded off
only by magical incantations and the intervention of the



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 67
sorcerer-priest. But the Assyrians were too much
occupied with wars and fighting to give all this heed to
the requirements of religion. It is significant that,
whereas in Babylonia we find the remains of scarcely
any great buildings except temples, the great buildings
of Assyria were the royal palaces. The libraries, which
in Babylonia were stored in the temples, were deposited
in Assyria in the palace of the king.
Nevertheless, the greater part of the religious system
of Babylonia had been transported into Assyria. Along
with the Babylonian deities had come the Babylonian
scriptures. These were divided into two great collections
or volumes. The first, and oldest, was a collection of
exorcisms and magical texts, by the use of which, it was
believed, the spirits of evil could be driven away, and the
spirits of good induced to visit the reciter. When,
however, certain independent deities began to emerge
from among the multitudinous ‘ spirits ’ of the primitive Accadian creed, hymns were composed in their honour,
and these hymns were eventually collected together,
and, like the Rig-Veda of India, became a second sacred
book. After the Accadians had been supplanted by the
Semites, the Accadian language, in which the hymns
were originally written, was provided with a Semitic
translation ; but it was still considered necessary to recite
the exact words of the original, since the words them
selves were sacred, and any mistake in their pronunciation
would invalidate the religious service in which they were
employed. Some of the incantations embodied in the
E2



68 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
collection of exorcisms must have been introduced into
it subsequently to the compilation of the sacred hymns,
since the latter are found inserted in them. From this
it would appear that the older collection continued to
receive additions for a long while after the younger
collection—that of the sacred hymns—had been put
together and invested with a sacred character. This
could not have been till after the beginning of the
Semitic period, since there are a few hymns which do not seem to have had any Accadian originals. If
we may compare the two collections with our own
religious literature, we may say that the collection of
hymns corresponded more to our Bible, that of exorcisms
to our Prayer Book.
The Babylonians and Assyrians, however, possessed a
liturgy which answered far better to our conception of
what a Prayer Book should be. This contained services
for particular days and hours, together with rubrics for
the direction of the priest. Thus we are told that ‘ in
the month Nisan, on the second day, two hours after
nightfall, the priest [of Bel at Babylon] must come and
take of the waters of the river, must enter into the
presence of Bel, and change his dress ; must put on
a robe in the presence of Bel, and say this prayer : “ O
my lord who in his strength has no equal, O my lord,
blessed sovereign, lord of the world, speeding the peace
of the great gods, the lord who in his might destroys
the strong, lord of kings, light of mankind, establisher
of trust, O Bel, thy sceptre is Babylon, thy crown is



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 69
Borsippa, the wide heaven is the dwelling-place of thy
liver. . . . O lord of the world, light of the spirits of
heaven, utterer of blessings, who is there whose mouth
murmurs not of thy righteousness, or speaks not of thy
glory, and celebrates not thy dominion ? O lord of the
world, who dwellest in the temple of the sun, reject not
the hands that are raised to thee ; be merciful to thy
city Babylon, to Beth-Saggil thy temple incline thy
face, grant the prayers of thy people the sons of
Babylon.” ’
Part of the liturgy consisted of prayers addressed to
the various deities, and suited to various occasions. Here are examples of them :
‘ At dawn and in the night
prayer should be made to the throne-bearer, and thus
should it be said : “ O throne-bearer, giver of prosperity,
a prayer!” After that, let prayer be made to Nusku,
and thus let it be said : “ O Nusku, prince and king of
the secrets of the great gods, a prayer ! ” After that, let
prayer be made to Adar, and thus let it be said : “ O
Adar, mighty lord of the deep places of the springs, a
prayer ! ” After that let prayer be made to Gula (Beltis),
and thus let it be said : “ O Gula, mother, begetter of
the black-headed race (of Accadians), a prayer ! ” After
that, let prayer be made to Nin-lil, and thus let it be
said: “O Nin-lil, great goddess, wife of the divine
prince of sovereignty, a prayer ! ” After that, let prayer
be made to Bel, and thus let it be said : “ O lord supreme,
establisher of law, a prayer ! ” The prayer (must be repeated) during the day at dawn, and in the night,

with face and mouth uplifted, during the middle watch. Water must be poured out in libation day by day
. . . at dawn, on the beams of the palace/
One of the most curious of these petitions is a prayer
after a bad dream, of which a fragment only has been
found. This reads as follows : ‘ May the lord set my
prayer at rest, (may he remove) my heavy (sin). May
the lord (grant) a return of favour. By day direct unto
death all that disquiets me. O my goddess, be gracious
unto me ; when (wilt thou hear) my prayer ? May they
pardon my sin, my wickedness, (and) my transgression.
May the exalted one deliver, may the holy one love.
May the seven winds carry away my groaning. May
the worm lay it low, may the bird bear it upwards to
heaven. May a shoal of fish carry it away ; may the
river bear it along. May the creeping thing of the field
come unto me ; may the waters of the river as they flow
cleanse me. Enlighten me like a mask of gold. Food
and drink before thee perpetually may I get. Heap up
the worm, take away his life. The steps of thy altar, thy many ones, may I ascend. With the worm make me
pass, and may I be kept with thee. Make me to be fed, and may a favourable dream come. May the dream I
dream be favourable ; may the dream I dream be
fulfilled. May the dream I dream turn to prosperity.
May Makhir, the god of dreams, settle upon my head.
Let me enter Beth-Saggil, the palace of the gods, the
temple of the lord. Give me unto Merodach, the
merciful, to prosperity, even unto prospering hands.



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 7 1
May thy entering (O Merodach) be exalted, may thy
divinity be glorious ; may the men of thy city extol thy
mighty deeds.’
Along with these prayers, the Assyrians possessed a
collection of penitential psalms, which were composed at
a very remote period in Southern Babylonia. The most
perfect of those of which we have copies is the
following :

My Lord is wroth in his heart : may he be appeased again.
May God be appeased again, for I knew not that I sinned.
May Istar, my mother, be appeased again, for I knew not
that I sinned,
God knoweth that I knew not : may he be appeased.
Istar, my mother, knoweth that I knew not : may she be
appeased.
May the heart of my God be appeased.
May God and Istar, my mother, be appeased.
May God cease from his anger.
May Istar, my mother, cease from her anger.
The transgression (I committed my God) knew.

The transgression (I committed, Istar, my mother, knew).
(My tears) I drink like the waters of the sea.
That which was forbidden by my God I ate without knowing.
That which was forbidden by Istar, my mother, I trampled
on without knowing.
O my Lord, my transgression is great, many are my sins
O my God, my transgression is great, many are my sins

The sin he has sinned turn into good.
Let the wind carry away the transgression I have committed.
Destroy my manifold wickednesses like a garment.
O my God, seven times seven are my transgressions, my
transgressions are (ever) before me.
A rubric is attached to this verse, stating that it is
to be repeated ten times, and at the end of the whole
psalm is the further rubric: ‘For the tearful supplica
tion of the heart let the glorious name of every god be
invoked sixty-five times, and then the heart shall have
peace.’
Reference is made in the psalm to the eating of for
bidden foods, and we have other indications that certain
kinds of food, among which swine’s flesh may be men
tioned, were not allowed to be consumed. On particular
days also fasts were observed, and special days of fasting
and humiliation were prescribed in times of public
calamity. In the calendar of the Egibi banking firm,
the 2nd of Tammuz or June is entered as a day of
‘ weeping.’ The institution of the Sabbath, moreover,



74 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
was known to the Babylonians and Assyrians, though it was confounded with the feast of the new moon, since
it was kept, not every seven days, but on the seventh,
fourteenth, twenty-first, and twenty-eighth days of the
lunar month. On these days, we read in a sort of
Saints’ calendar for the intercalary Elul : ‘ Flesh cooked
on the fire may not be eaten, the clothing of the body
may not be changed, white garments may not be put on,
a sacrifice may not be offered, the king may not ride in
his chariot, nor speak in public, the augur may not
mutter in a secret place, medicine of the body may not
be applied, nor may any curse be uttered.’ The very name of Sabattu or Sabbath was employed by the
Assyrians, and is defined as ‘ a day of rest for the heart,’
while the Accadian equivalent is explained to mean ‘ a
day of completion of labour.’
So far as we are at present acquainted with the
peculiarities of the Assyro-Babylonian temple, it offers
many points of similarity to the temple of Solomon at
Jerusalem. Thus there were an outer and an inner
court and a shrine, to which the priests alone had access.
In this was an altar approached by steps, as well as an
ark or coffer containing two inscribed tablets of stone,
such as were discovered by Mr. Rassam in the temple of
Balawat. In the outer court was a large basin, filled
with water, and called ‘a sea,’ which was used for
ablutions and religious ceremonies. At the entrance
stood colossal figures of winged bulls, termed ‘cherubs,’
which were imagined to prevent the ingress of evil



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 75
spirits. Similar figures guarded the approach to the
royal palace, and possibly to other houses as well. Some
of them may now be seen in the British Museum.
Within, the temples were filled with images of gods,
great and small, which not only represented the deities
whose names they bore, but were believed to confer of
themselves a special sanctity on the place wherein they
were placed. As among the Israelites, offerings were
of two kinds, sacrifices and meal offerings. The sacrifice
consisted of an animal, more usually a bullock, part of
whose flesh was burnt upon the altar, while the rest was
handed over to the priests or retained by the offerer.
There is no trace of human sacrifices among the Assy
rians, which is the more singular, since we learn that
human sacrifice had been an Accadian institution. A
passage in an old astrological work indicates that the
victims were burnt to death, like the victims of Moloch ;
and an early Accadian fragment expressly states that
they were to be the children of those for whose sins
they were offered to the gods. The fragment is as
follows : ‘ The son who lifts his head among men, the
son for his own life must (the father) give ; the head of
the child for the head of the man must he give ; the neck of the child for the neck of the man must he give ; the
breast of the child for the breast of the man must he
give.’ The idea of vicarious punishment is here clearly
indicated.
The future life to which the Babylonian had looked forward was dreary enough. Hades, the land of the



76 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
dead, was beneath the earth, a place of darkness and gloom, from which ‘ none might return,’ where the spirits
of the dead flitted like bats, with dust alone for their
food. Here the shadowy phantoms of the heroes of old time sat crowned, each upon his throne, a belief to which
allusion is made by the Hebrew prophet in his pro
phecy of the coming overthrow of Babylon (Is. xiv. 9).
In the midst stood the palace of Allat, the queen of the
underworld, where the waters of life bubbled forth
beside the golden throne of the spirits of earth, restoring
those who might drink of them to life and the upper air.
Tiie entrance to this dreary abode of the departed lay
beyond Datilla, the river of death, at the mouth of the
Euphrates, and it was here that the hero Gisdhubar
saw Xisuthros, the Chaldean Noah, after his translation
to the fields of the blessed. In later times, when the
horizon of geographical knowledge was widened, the
entrance to the gloomy world of Hades, and the earthly
paradise that was above it, were alike removed to other
and more unknown regions. The conception of the
after-life, moreover, was made brighter, at all events, for
the favoured few. An Assyrian court-poet prays thus
on behalf of his king : ‘ The land of the silver sky, oil
unceasing, the benefits of blessedness may he obtain
among the feasts of the gods, and a happy cycle among
their light, even life everlasting, and bliss ; such is my
prayer to the gods who dwell in the land of Assur.’
Even at a far earlier time we find the great Chaldean epic
of Gisdhubar concluding with a description of the bliss



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 77
ful lot ol the spirit of Ea-bani : ‘ On a couch he reclines
and pure water he drinks. Him who is slain in battle
thou seest and I see. His father and his mother (sup
port) his head, his wife addresses the corpse. His friends
in the fields are standing ; thou seest (them) and I see.
His spoil on the ground is uncovered ; of his spoil he
hath no oversight, (as) thou seest and I see. His tender
orphans beg for bread ; the food that was stored in (his)
tent is eaten.’ Here the spirit of Ea-bani is supposed to
behold from his couch in heaven the deeds that take
place on the earth below.
Heaven itself had not always been ‘the land of the
silver sky ’ of later Assyrian belief. The Babylonians
once believed that the gods inhabited the snow-clad peak of Rowandiz, ‘ the mountain of the world ’ and ‘ the
mountain of the East,’ as it was also termed, which
supported the starry vault of heaven. It is to this old
Babylonian belief that allusion is made in Isaiah xiv. 13,
14, where the Babylonian monarch is represented as
saying in his heart : ‘ I will ascend into heaven, I will
exalt my throne above the stars of God : I will sit also
on the mount of the assembly (of the gods) 1 in the
extremities2 of the north : I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.’
As in all old forms of heathen faith, religion and mythology were inextricably mixed together. Myths
were told of most of the gods. Reference has already been made to the myth of Istar and Tammuz, the pro
1 A. V ‘congregation.’ 2 a. y. ‘sides.’



y 8 ASSYRIA: ITS princes, priests, and people.
totype of the Greek legend of Aphrodite and Adonis.
So, too, the Greek story of the theft of fire by Prome
theus has its parallel in the Babylonian story of the god
Zu, ‘ the divine storm-bird/ who stole the lightning of
Bel, the tablet whereon the knowledge of futurity is
written, and who was punished for his crime by the father
of the gods. In reading the legend of the plague-demon
Lubara, whom Anu sends to smite the evildoers in
Babylon, Erech, and other places, we are reminded of
the avenging angel of God whom David saw standing
with a drawn sword over Jerusalem. One of the most curious of the Babylonian myths was
that which told how the seven evil-spirits or storm
demons had once warred against the moon and threat
ened to devour it. Samas and Istar fled from the lower
sky, and the Moon-god would have been blotted out from heaven had not Bel and Ea sent Merodach in his
‘ glistening armour ’ to rescue him. The myth is really
a primitive attempt to explain a lunar eclipse, and finds
its illustration in the dragon of the Chinese, who is still
popularly believed by them to devour the sun or moon
when an eclipse takes place.
The primaeval victory of light and order over dark
ness and chaos, which seems to be repeated whenever
the sun bursts through a storm-cloud, was similarly
expressed in a mythical form. It was the victory of
Merodach over Tiamat, ‘ the deep,’ the personification of
chaos and elemental anarchy. The myth was embodied
in a poem, the greater part of which has been preserved



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 79
to us. We are told how Merodach was armed by the
gods with bow and scimetar, how alone he faced and
fought the dragon Tiamat, driving the winds into her throat when she opened her mouth to swallow him, and
how, finally, he cut open her body, scattering in flight
‘ the rebellious deities ’ who had stood at her side.
Tiamat, or the watery chaos, is usually represented with
wings, claws, tail, and horns, but she is also identified
with ‘ the wicked serpent ’ of * night and darkness/ ‘ the
monstrous serpent of seven heads/ ‘ which beats the sea/
The most interesting of the old myths and traditions
of Babylonia are those in which we can trace, more or
less clearly, the lineaments of the accounts of the
creation of the world and the early history of man,
given us in the early chapters of Genesis. There was
more than one legend of the creation. In a text which
came from the library of Cuthah, it was described as
taking place on evolutionary principles, the first created
beings being the brood of chaos, men with ‘ the bodies
of birds ’ and ‘ the faces of ravens/ who were succeeded
by the more perfect forms of the existing world. But
the library of Assur-bani-pal also contained an account
of the creation, which bears a remarkable resemblance
to that in the first chapter of Genesis. Unfortunately,
however, it seems to have been of Assyrian and not
Babylonian origin, and, therefore, not to have been of
early date. In this account the creation appears to be
described as having been accomplished in six days. It begins in these words :



SO ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
‘ At that time the heavens above named not a name,
nor did the earth below record one ; yea, the ocean was
their first creator, the flood of the deep (Tiamat) was
she who bore them all. Their waters were embosomed
in one place, and the clouds (?) were not collected, the
plant was still ungrown. At that time the gods had not
issued forth, any one of them ; by no name were they
recorded, no destiny (had they fixed). Then the (great) gods were made ; Lakhmu and Lakhamu issued forth the first. They grew up. . . . Next were made the
host of heaven and earth. The time was long, (and
then) the gods Anu, (Bel, and Ea were born of) the host
of heaven and earth.’ The rest of the account is lost,
and it is not until we come to the fifth tablet of the
series, which describes the appointment of the heavenly
bodies, that the narrative is again preserved. Here we
are told that the creator, who seems to have been Ea,
‘ made the stations of the great gods, even the stars,
fixing the places of the principal stars like ....
He ordered the year, setting over it the decans ; yea, he
established three stars for each of the twelve months/
It will be remembered that, according to Genesis, the
appointment of the heavenly bodies to guide and govern
the seasons was the work of the fourth day, and since
the work is described in the fifth tablet or book of the
Assyrian account, while the first tablet describes the
condition of the universe before the creation was begun,
it becomes probable that the Assyrians also knew that
the work was performed on the fourth day. The next



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 8l
tablet states that * at that time the gods in their
assembly created (the living creatures). They made
the mighty (animals). They caused the living beings
to come forth, the cattle of the field, the beast of the
field, and the creeping thing.’ Unfortunately the rest of
the narrative is in too mutilated a condition for a trans
lation to be possible, and the part which describes the
creation of man has not yet been recovered among the
ruins of the library of Nineveh.
The Chaldean account of the Deluge was discovered by Mr. George Smith, and its close resemblance to the
account in Genesis is well known. Those who wish to
see a translation of it, according to the latest researches,
will find one in the pages of ‘ Fresh Light from the Ancient Monuments.’ The account was introduced as
an episode into the eleventh book of the great Baby
lonian epic of Gisdhubar, and appears to be the amalga
mation of two older poems on the subject. The story
of the Deluge, in fact, was a favourite theme among the Babylonians, and we have fragments of at least two
other versions of it, neither of which, however, agree so
remarkably with the Biblical narrative as does the version discovered by Mr. Smith. Apart from the pro
found difference caused by the polytheistic character of the Chaldean account, and the monotheism of the
Scriptural narrative, it is only in details that the two
accounts vary from one another. Thus, the vessel in which Xisuthros, the Chaldean Noah, sails, is a ship,
guided by a steersman, and not an ark, and others F

besides his own family are described as being admitted
into it. So, too, the period of time during which the
flood was at its height is said to have been seven days
only, while, beside the raven and the dove, Xisuthros is
stated to have sent out a third bird, the swallow, in
order to determine how far the waters had subsided.
The Chaldean ark rested, moreover, on Rowandiz, the
highest of the mountains of Eastern Kurdistan, and the peak whereon Accadian mythology imagined the
heavens to be supported, and not on the northern or
Armenian continuation of the range. Babylonian tradi
tion, too, had fused into one Noah and Enoch, Xisuthros
being represented as translated to the land of immor
tality immediately after his descent from the ark and
his sacrifice to the gods. It is noticeable that the
Chaldean account agrees with that of the Bible in one
remarkable respect, in which it differs from almost all
the other traditions of the Deluge found throughout the
world. This is in its ascribing the cause of the Deluge
to the wickedness of mankind. It was sent as a punish
ment for sin.
As might have been expected, the Babylonians and
Assyrians knew of the building of the Tower of Babel,
and the dispersion of mankind. Men had ‘ turned
against the father of all the gods/ under a leader the
thoughts of whose heart ‘ were evil.5 At Babylon they
began to erect ‘ a mound/ or hill-like tower, but the
winds destroyed it in the night, and Anu ‘confounded
great and small on the mound/ as well as their ‘ speech/



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 83
and ‘ made strange their counsel.’ All this was supposed
to have taken place at the time of the autumnal equinox,
and it is possible that the name of the rebel leader,
which is lost, was Etana. At all events the demi-god
Etana played a conspicuous part in the early historical
mythology of Babylonia, like two other famous divine kings, Ner and Dun, and a fragment describes him as
having built a city of brick. However this may be,
Etana is the Babylonian Titan of Greek writers, who, with Prometheus and Ogygos, made war against the
gods.
If we sum up the character of Assyrian religion, we
shall find it characterised by curious contrasts. On the
one hand we shall find it grossly polytheistic, believing
in ‘ lords many and gods many,’ and admitting not only
gods and demi-gods, and even deified men, but the
multitudinous spirits, ‘the host of heaven and earth,’
who were classed together as the ‘ 300 spirits of heaven
and the 600 spirits of earth.’ Some of these were
beneficent, others hostile, to man. In addition to this
vast army of divine powers, the Assyrian offered worship
also to the heavenly bodies, and to the spirits of rivers
and mountains. He even set up stones or ‘ Beth-els/ so called because they were imagined to be veritable ‘houses of god,’ wherein the godhead dwelt, and over
these he poured out libations of oil and wine. Yet, on
the other hand, with all this gross polytheism, there was a strong tendency to monotheism. The supreme god, Assur, is often spoken of in language which at first sight
F2



84 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
seems monotheistic : to him the Assyrian monarchs
ascribe their victories, and in his name they make war
against the unbeliever. A similar inconsistency prevailed
in the character of Assyrian worship itself. There was
much in it which commands our admiration : the
Assyrian confessed his sins to his gods, he begged
for their pardon and help, he allowed nothing to
interfere with what he conceived to be his religious
duties. With all this, his worship of Istar was stained
with the foulest excesses—excesses, too, indulged in,
like those of the Phoenicians, in the name and for the
sake of religion.
Much of this inconsistency may be explained by the
history of his religious ideas. As we have seen, a large
part of them was derived from a non-Semitic population,
the primitive inhabitants of Babylonia, under whose
influence the Semitic Babylonians had come at a time
when they still lacked nearly all the elements of culture.
The result was a form of creed in which the old
Accadian faith was bodily taken over by an alien race,
but at the same time profoundly modified. It was
Accadian religion interpreted by the Semitic mind and
belief. Baal-worship, which saw the Sun-god everywhere
under an infinite variety of manifestations, waged a
constant struggle with the conceptions of the borrowed
creed, but never overcame them altogether. The gods
and spirits of the Accadians remained to the last, although
permeated and overlaid with the worship of the Semitic
Sun-god. As time went on, new religious elements were



ASSYRIAN RELIGION. 85
introduced, and Assyro-Babylonian religion underwent
new phases, while in Assyria itself the deified state in
the person of the god Assur tended to absorb the
religious cult and aspirations of the people. The higher
minds of the nation struggled now and again towards
the conception of one supreme God and of a purer form
of faith, but the dead weight of polytheistic beliefs and
practices prevented them from ever really reaching it.
In the best examples of their religious literature we
constantly fall across expressions and ideas which show
how wide was the gulf that separated them from that
kindred people of Israel to whom the oracles of God
were revealed.

CHAPTER IV.
Art, Literature, and Science.
ASSYRIAN art was, speaking generally, imported from
Babylonia. Even the palace of the king was built of
bricks, and raised upon a mound like the palaces and
temples of Babylonia, although stone was plentiful
in Assyria, and there was no marshy plain where
inundations might be feared. It was only the walls that
were lined with sculptured slabs of alabaster, the
sculptures taking the place of the paintings in vermilion,
which adorned the houses of Babylonia (Ezek. xxiii. 14). It is at Khorsabad, or Dur-Sargon, the city built by
Sargon, to the north of Nineveh, that we can best study
the architectural genius of Assyria. The city was laid
out in the form of a square, and surrounded by walls
forty-six feet thick and over a mile in length each way,
the angles of which faced the four cardinal points. The
outer wall was flanked with eight tall towers, and was
erected on a mound of rubble.
On the north-west side stood the royal palace, defended
also by a wall of its own, and built on a T“shaped
platform. It was approached through an outer court,
the gates of which were hung under arches of enamelled
brick, and guarded by colossal figures in stone. From



ART, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE. 87
the court an inclined plane led to the first terrace
occupied by a number of small rooms, in which the
French excavators saw the barracks of the palace-guard.
Above this terrace rose a second, at a height of about
ten feet, upon which was built the royal palace
itself. This was entered through a gateway, on either
side of which stood the stone figure of a ‘ cherub,’ while
within it was a court 350 feet long and 170 feet wide.
Beyond this court was an inner one, which formed a
square of 1 50 feet. On its left were the royal chambers,
consisting of a suite of ten rooms, and beyond them
again the private chapel of the monarch, leading to the
apartments in which he commonly lived. On the west
side of the palace rose a tower, built in stages, on the
summit of which was the royal observatory.
It is a question whether the Assyrian palace possessed
any upper stories. On the whole, probability speaks
against it. Columns, however, were used plentifully.
The column, in fact, had been a Babylonian invention,
and originated in the necessity of supporting buildings
• on wooden pillars in a country where there was no stone.
From Babylonia columnar architecture passed into
Assyria, where it assumed exaggerated forms, the column being sometimes made to rest on the backs of
lions, dogs, and winged bulls.
The apertures which served as windows were pro
tected by heavy folds of tapestry, that kept out the heats
of summer and the cold winds of winter. In warm
weather, however, the inmates of the house preferred to



88 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
sit in the open air, either in the airy courts upon which
its chambers opened, or under the shady trees of the
paradeisos or park attached to the dwellings of the rich.
The leases of houses let or sold in Nineveh in the time
of the Second Assyrian Empire generally make mention
of the ‘ shrubbery,’ which formed part of the property.
Assyrian sculpture was for the most part in relief.
The Assyrians carved badly in the round, unlike the
Babylonians, some of whose sitting statues are not
wanting in an air of dignity and repose. But they
excelled in that kind of shallow relief of which so many
examples have been brought to the British Museum.
We can trace three distinct periods in the history of this
form of art. The first period is that which begins, so far
as we know at present, with the age of Assur-natsir-pal.
It is characterised by boldness and vigour, by an absence
of background or landscape, and by an almost total want
of perspective. With very few exceptions, faces and
figures are drawn in profile. But with all this want of
skill, the work is often striking from the spirit with
which it is executed, and the naturalness with which
animals, more especially, are depicted. A bas-relief
representing a lion-hunt of Assur-natsir-pal has been
often selected as a typical, though favourable, illustration
of the art of this age.
The second period extends from the foundation of the
Second Assyrian Empire to the reign of Esar-haddon.
The artist has lost in vigour, but has compensated for it
by care and accuracy. The foreground is now filled in



ART, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE. 89
with vegetable and other forms, all drawn with a pre
Raffaeliite exactitude. The relief consequently becomes
exceedingly rich, and produces the effect of embroidery
in stone. It is probable that the delicate minuteness of
this period of art was in great measure due to the work
in ivory that had now become fashionable at Nineveh.
The third, and best period, is that of the reign of
Assur-bani-pal. There is a return to the freedom of the
first period, but without its accompanying rudeness and
want of skill. The landscape is either left bare, or
indicated in outline only, the attention of the spectator
being thus directed to the principal sculpture itself.
The delineation of the human figure has much im
proved ; vegetable forms have lost much of their stiff
ness, and we meet with several examples of successful
foreshortening. Up to the last, however, the Assyrian
artist succeeded but badly in human portraiture.
Nothing can surpass some of his pictures of animals ;
when he came to deal with the human figure he ex
pended his strength on embroidered robes and the
muscles of the legs and arms. The reason of this is not
difficult to discover. Unlike the Egyptian, who excelled in the delineation of the human form, he did not draw
from nude models. The details of the drapery were with him of more importance than the features of the
face or the posture of the limbs. We cannot expect to
find portraits in the sculptures of Assyria. Little, if any,
attempt is made even to distinguish the natives of
different foreign countries from one another, except in



90 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
the way of dress. All alike have the same features as
the Assyrians themselves.
The effect of the bas-reliefs was enhanced by the
red, black, blue, and white colours with which they were
picked out. The practice had come from Babylonia,
but whereas the Babylonians delighted in brilliant
colouring, their northern neighbours contented them
selves with much more sober hues. It was no doubt
from the populations of Mesopotamia that the Greeks
first learnt to paint and tint their sculptured stone.
Unfortunately it is difficult, if not impossible, to find
any trace of colouring remaining in the Assyrian bas
reliefs now in Europe. When first disinterred, however,
the colours were still bright in many cases, although
exposure to the air soon caused them to fade and
perish.
The bas-reliefs and colossi were moved from the
quarries out of which they had been dug, or the workshops
in which they had been carved, by the help of sledges
and rollers. Hundreds of captives were employed to
drag the huge mass along ; sometimes it was trans
ported by water, the boat on which it lay being pulled by men on shore ; sometimes it was drawn over the
land by gangs of slaves, urged to their work by the rod
and sword of their task-masters. On the colossus itself
stood an overseer holding to his mouth what looks on
the monument like a modern speaking-trumpet. Over
a sculpture representing the transport of one of these
colossi Sennacherib has engraved the words : ‘ Senna

cherib, king of legions, king of Assyria, has caused the
winged bull and the colossi, the divinities which were
made in the land of the city of the Baladians, to be
brought with joy to the palace of his lordship, which is
within Nineveh.’ We may infer from this epigraph that
the images themselves were believed to be in some way
the abode of divinity, like the Beth-els or sacred stones
to which reference has been made in the last chapter.
Like Assyrian art, Assyrian literature was for the
most part derived from Babylonia. A large portion of
it was translated from Accadian originals. Sometimes
the original was lost or forgotten ; more frequently it
was re-edited from time to time with interlinear or
parallel translations in Assyro-Babylonian. This was
more especially the case with the sacred texts, in which
the old language of Accad was itself accounted sacred,
like Latin in the services of the Roman Catholic Church,
or Coptic in those of the modern Egyptian Church.
The Accadians had been the inventors of the hiero
glyphics or pictorial characters out of which the
cuneiform characters had afterwards grown. Writing
begins with pictures, and the writing of the Babylonians
formed no exception to the rule. The pictures were at
first painted on the papyrus leaves which grew in the marshes of the Euphrates, but as time went on a new and
more plentiful writing material came to be employed in
the shape of clay. Clay was literally to be found under
the feet of every one. All that was needed was to
impress it, while still wet, with the hieroglyphic pictures,



94 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
and then dry it in the sun. It is probable that the
bricks used in the construction of the great buildings of
Chaldea were first treated in this way. At all events we
find that up to the last, the Babylonian kings stamped
their names and titles in the middle of such bricks, and hundreds of them may be met with in the museums of
Europe bearing the name of Nebuchadnezzar. When
once the discovery was made that clay could be
employed as a writing material, it was quickly turned to
good account. All Babylonia began to write on tablets
of clay, and though papyrus continued to be used, it was
reserved for what we should now term ‘ Editions de
luxe.’ The writing instrument had originally been the
edge of a stone or a piece of stick, but these were soon
superseded by a metal stylus with a square head. Under
the combined influence of the clay tablet and the metal
stylus, the old picture-writing began to degenerate into
the cuneiform or ‘ wedge-shaped ’ characters with which
the monuments of Assyria have made us familiar.
It was difficult, if not impossible, any longer to draw
circles and curves, and accordingly angles took the
place of circles, and straight lines the place of curves.
Continuous lines were equally difficult to form ; it was
easier to represent them by a series of indentations, each
of which took a wedge-like appearance from the square
head of the stylus. As soon as the exact forms of the
old pictures began to be obliterated, other alterations
became inevitable. The forms began to be simplified by
the omission of lines or wedges which were no longer



ART, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE. 95
necessary, now that the character had become a mere
symbol instead of a picture ; and this process of simpli
fication went on from one century to another, until in
many instances the later form of a character is hardly
more than a shadow of what it originally was. Educa
tion was widely spread in Babylonia ; in spite of the
cumbrousness and intricacy of the system of writing, there
were few, it would appear, who could not read and write,
and hence, as was natural, all kinds of handwritings were prevalent, some good and some bad. Among these various cursive or running hands were some which
were selected for public documents ; but as the hands
varied, not only among individuals, but also from age
to age, the official script never became fixed and
permanent, but changed constantly, each change,
however, bringing with it increased simplicity in the
shapes of the characters, and a greater departure
from the primitive hieroglyphic form. The earliest con temporaneous monuments with which we are at present
acquainted, are those recently excavated by the French
Consul M. de Sarzec at a place called Tel-Loh ; on
these we see the early pictures in the very act of
passing into cuneiform characters, the pictures being
sometimes preserved and sometimes already lost. A
comparison of the forms found at Tel-Loh with those usually employed in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, will
show at a glance what profound modifications were undergone by the cuneiform syllabary in the course of
its transmission from generation to generation.



96 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
In contrast to the Babylonians, the Assyrians were a
nation of warriors and huntsmen, not of students, and
with them, therefore, a knowledge of writing was con
fined to a particular class, that of the scribes. At an
early period, accordingly, in the history of the kingdom,
a special form of script was adopted not only in official
documents, but in private documents as well, and this
script remained practically unchanged down to the fall
of Nineveh. This form of script was one of the many
simplified forms of handwriting that were used in
Babylonia, and it was fortunately a very clear and well
defined one. Now and then, it is true, contact with
Babylonia made an Assyrian king desirous of imitating
the archaic writing of Babylonia, and inscriptions were
consequently engraved in florid characters, abounding in
a multiplicity of needless wedges, and reminding us of
our modern black-letter. Such ornamental inscriptions
are not numerous, and were carved only on stone. The
clay literature was all written in the ordinary Assyrian
characters, except when the scribe was unable to
recognise a character in a Babylonian text he was
copying, and so reproduced it exactly in his copy.
The clay tablets used by the Assyrians were an
improvement on those of Babylonia. Instead of being
merely dried in the sun, they were thoroughly baked in
a kiln, holes being drilled through them here and there
to allow the steam to escape. As a rule, therefore, the
tablets of Assyria are smaller than those of Babylonia,
since there was always a danger of a large tablet being

broken in the fire. In consequence of the small size of
the tablets, and the amount of text with which it was.
often necessary to cover them, the characters impressed
upon them are frequently minute, so minute, indeed, as
to suggest that they must have been written with the
help of a magnifying glass. This supposition is con
firmed by the existence of a magnifying lens of crystal
discovered by Sir A. H. Layard on the site of the library
of Nineveh, and now in the British Museum.
A
literary people like the Babylonians needed
libraries, and libraries were accordingly established at a
very early period in all the great cities of the country,
and plentifully stocked with books in papyrus and clay.
In imitation of these Babylonian libraries, libraries were
also founded in Assyria by the Assyrian kings. There
was a library at Assur, and another at Calah which
seems to have been as old as the city itself. But the
chief library of Assyria that, in fact, from which most of
the Assyrian literature we possess has come, was the
great library of Nineveh (Kouyunjik). This owed its
magnitude and reputation to Assur-bani-pal, who filled
it with copies of the plundered books of Babylonia. A whole army of scribes was employed in it, busily engaged
in writing and editing old texts. Assur-bani-pal is
never weary of telling us, in the colophon at the end of
the last tablet of a series which made up a single work,
that ‘Nebo and Tasmit had given him broad ears and
enlightened his eyes so as to see the engraved characters
of the written tablets, whereof none of the kings that
G2



100 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
had gone before had seen this text, the wisdom of Nebo,
all the literature of the library that exists,’ so that he
had ‘ written, engraved, and explained it on tablets,
and placed it within his palace for the inspection of
readers.’
A good deal of the literature was of a lexical and
grammatical kind, and was intended to assist the
Semitic student in interpreting the old Accadian
texts. Lists of characters were drawn up with their
pronunciation in Accadian and the translation into
Assyrian of the words represented by them. Since the
Accadian pronunciation of a character was frequently
the phonetic value attached to it by the Assyrians,
these syllabaries, as they have been termed— in
consequence of the fact that the cuneiform characters
denoted syllables and not letters—have been of the
greatest possible assistance in the decipherment of the
inscriptions. Besides the syllabaries, the Semitic scribes
compiled tables of Accadian words and grammatical
forms with their Assyro-Babylonian equivalents, as well
as lists of the names of animals, birds, reptiles, fish,
stones, vegetables, medicines, and the like in the two
languages. There are even geographical and astro
nomical lists, besides long lists of Assyrian synonyms
and the titles of military and civil officers.
Other tablets contain phrases and sentences extracted from some particular Accadian work and explained in
Assyrian, while others again are exercises or reading
books intended for boys at school, who wore learning



ART, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE. 101
the old dead language of Chaldea. In; addition to
these helps whole texts were provided with Assyrian
translations, sometimes interlinear, sometimes placed in
a parallel column on the right-hand side ; so that it
is not wonderful that the Assyrians now and then
attempted to write in the extinct Accadian, just as we
write nowadays in Latin, though in both cases, it must
be confessed, not always with success.
Accadian, however, was not the only language besides
his own that the Semitic Babylonian or Assyrian was required to know. Aramaic had become the common
language of trade and diplomacy, so that not only was
it assumed by the ministers of Hezekiah that an official
like the Rab-shakeh or Vizier of Sennacherib could
speak it as a matter of course (2 Kings xviii. 26), but even in trading documents we find the Aramaic
language and alphabet used side by side with the Assyrian cuneiform. This common use of Aramaic
explains how it was that the Jews after the Babylonish
captivity gave up their own language in favour not of the Assyro-Babylonian, but of the Aramaic of Northern
Syria and Arabia. An educated Assyrian was thus
expected to be able to read and write a dead language,
Accadian, and to read, write, and speak a foreign living
language, Aramaic. In addition to these languages, moreover, he took an interest in others which were
spoken by his neighbours around him. The Rabshakeh of Sennacherib was able to speak Hebrew, and
tablets have been discovered giving the Assyrian



102 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
renderings of lists of words from the barbarous dialects of the Kossaeans in the mountains of Elam and of the
Semitic nomads on the western side of the Euphrates.
All the branches of knowledge known at the time
were treated of in Assyrian literature, though naturally
history, legend, and poetry occupied a prominent place
in it. But even such subjects as the despatches of
generals in the field, or the copies of royal corre
spondence found a place in the public library. The
chronology of Assyria, and therewith of the Old
Testament also, has been restored by means of the lists
of successive ‘eponyms’ or officers after whom the
years were named, while a recent discovery has brought
to light a table of Semitic Babylonian kings, arranged
in dynasties, which traces them back to B.C. 2330. A flood of light has been poured on Chaldean
astronomy and astrology, by the fragments of the
original work called ‘ The Observations of Bel ’ which was
translated into Greek by the Babylonian priest Berdssos.
It consisted of seventy-two books, and was compiled
for king Sargon of Accad, whose date is assigned by
Nabonidos to B.C. 3800. Another work on omens, in 137 books, had been compiled for the same king, and
both remained to the last days of the Assyrian Empire
the standard treatises on the subjects with which they
dealt. To the same period we should probably refer a
treatise on agriculture, extracts from which have been
preserved in a reading-book in Accadian and Assyrian.
Here the songs are quoted with which the Accadian



ART, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE. 109
ox-drivers beguiled their labours in the field : * An heifer
am I : to the cow thou art yoked : the plough’s handle
is strong : lift it up lift it up or again : ‘ The knees are
marching, the feet are not resting ; with no wealth of
thy own grain thou begettest for me.’ Some of the
most curious specimens of this department of literature
are the fables, riddles, and proverbs, which embody the
homely wisdom of the unofficial classes.
Here, for instance, is a riddle propounded to Nergal
and the other gods by ‘ the wise man,’ such as Orientals
still delight in
:
‘ What is (found) in the house ; what is (concealed)
in the secret place ; what is (fixed) in the foundation of
the house ; what exists on the floor of the house ; what
is (perceived) in the lower part (of the house) ; what
goes down by the sides of the house ; what in the ditch of the house (makes) broad furrows; what roars like a
bull ; what brays like an ass ; what flutters like a sail
;
what bleats like a sheep ; what barks like a dog ; what
growls like a bear ; what enters into a man ; what enters
into a woman ?’ The answer is, of course, the air or wind.
Among the most treasured portions of the library of
Nineveh was the poetical literature, comprising epics,
hymns to the gods, psalms and songs. Fifteen of these
songs, we are told, were arranged on the eastern and
northern sides of the building, * on the western side
being nine songs to Assur, Bel the voice of the firmament, the Southern Sun,’ and another god. The
mention of songs to Assur shows that there were some



IIO ASSYRIA: ITS FRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
which were of Assyrian origin. The epics, however, all
came from Babylonia, and were partly translations from
Accadian, partly independent compositions of Semitic
Babylonian poets. The names of the reputed authors of many of them have come down to us. Thus the
great epic of Gisdhubar was ascribed to Sin-liki-unnini
;
the legend of Etana to Nis-Sin ; the fable of the fox to Ru-Merodach the son of Nitakh-Dununa.
The epic of Gisdhubar, as has already been stated,
contained the account of the Deluge, introduced as an
episode into the eleventh book. It consisted in all of
twelve books, and was arranged upon an astronomical
principle, the subject-matter of each of the books being
made to correspond with one of the signs of Zodiac.
Thus the fifth book records the death of a monstrous
lion at the hands of Gisdhubar, answering to the
Zodiacal Leo ; in the sixth book the hero is vainly
wooed by Istar, the Virgo of the Zodiacal signs; and
just as Aquarius is in the eleventh Zodiacal sign, so the
history of the Deluge is embodied in the eleventh book.
There was a special reason, however, for this arrange
ment ; Gisdhubar himself wras a solar hero. He seems
originally to have been the fire-stick of the primitive
Accadians, and then the god or spirit of the fire it
produced, eventually in the Semitic period passing first
into a form of the Sun-god, and then into a solar hero.
His twelve labours or adventures answer to the twelve
months of the year through which the sun moves, like
the twelve labours of the Greek Herakles. The latter,



ART, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE. Ill
indeed, were simply the twelve labours of Gisdhubar
transported to the west. The Greeks received many
myths and mythological conceptions from the
Phoenicians, along with their early culture, and these
myths had themselves been brought by the Phoenicians
from their original home in Chaldea. It has long been
recognised that Herakles was the borrowed Phoenician
Sun-god ; we now know that his primitive prototype
had been adopted by the Phoenicians from the Accadians
of Babylonia. It is not strange, therefore, that just as in the Greek myth of Aphrodite and Adonis we find the
outlines of the old Chaldean story of Istarand Tammuz,
so in the legends of Herakles we find an echo of
the legends of Gisdhubar. The lion destroyed by Gisdhubar is the lion of Nemea ; the winged bull
made by Anu to avenge the slight offered to Istar is
the winged bull of Krete ; the tyrant Khumbaba, slain
by Gisdhubar in ‘ the land of pine-trees, the seat of the
gods, the sanctuary of the spirits ’ is the tyrant Geryon ;
the gems borne by the trees of the forest beyond ‘ the
gateway of the sun ’ are the apples of the Hesperides
;
and the deadly sickness of Gisdhubar himself is but the
fever sent by the poisoned tunic of Nessos through
the veins of the Greek hero. It is curious thus to trace
to their first source the myths which have made so deep
an impress on classical art and literature. The indebted
ness of European culture to the valley of the Euphrates
is becoming more and more apparent every year.
It is impossible to determine the age of the great



12 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
Chaldean epic, but it must have been composed subse
quently to the period when, through the precession of
the equinoxes, Aries came to be the first sign of the
Zodiac instead of Taurus, that is to say, about B.C. 2500.
On the other hand, it is difficult to make it later than
B.C. 2000, while the whole character and texture of the
poem shows that it has been put together from older
lays, which have been united into a single whole. The
poem deservedly continued to be a favourite among the
Babylonians and Assyrians, and more than one edition
of it was made for the library of Assur-bani-pal. A
translation of all the portions of it that have been dis
covered will be found in George Smith’s ‘ Chaldean
Account of Genesis.’
It is difficult for the English reader to appreciate
justly the real character of many of these old poems.
The tablets on which they are inscribed were broken in
pieces when Nineveh was destroyed, and the roof of the
library fell in upon them. A text, therefore, has gene
rally to be pieced together from a number of fragments,
leaving gaps and lacunae which mar the pleasure of
reading it. Then, again, the translator frequently comes
across a word or phrase which is new to him, and which
he is consequently obliged to leave untranslated or to
render purely conjecturally. At times there is a lacuna
in the original text itself. When the Assyrian scribe
was unable to read the tablet he was copying, either
because the characters had been effaced by time or
because their Babylonian forms were unknown to him,



ART, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE. 113
he wrote the word khibi,
‘ it is wanting/ and left a blank
in his text It is not wonderful, therefore; that what is
really a fine piece of literature reads tamely and poorly
in its English dress, more especially when we remember
that the decipherer is compelled to translate literally,
and cannot have recourse to those idiomatic paraphrases
which are permissible when we are dealing with known
languages.
But it must be confessed that many of the best com
positions of Babylonia are spoilt for us by the references
to a puerile superstition, and. the ever-present dread of
witchcraft and magic which they contain. A good
example of this curious mixture of exalted thought and
debasing superstition is the following hymn to the Sungod :

‘ O Sun-god, king of heaven and earth, director of things above
and below,
O Sun-god, thou that clothest the dead with life, delivered by
thy hands,
judge unbribed, director of mankind,
supreme in mercy for. him that is in trouble,
bidding the child and offspring come forth, light of the world,
creator of all thy land, the Sun-god art thou !
O Sun-god, when the bewitchment for many days,
is bound behind me and there is no deliverer,
the expulsion of the curse and return of. health are brought
about, (by thee).

or the bewitchment of my father and of him who is not my

May the name of my god be a father where there is no justice.
To mankind, the flock of the god Ner, whatever be their names,
who are in field and city,
speak, O Sun-god, mighty lord, and bid the evil enchantment
be at rest.’
Even the science of the Babylonians and their Assy
rian disciples was not free from superstition. Astronomy
was mixed with astrology, and their observation of
terrestrial phenomena led only to an elaborate system
of augury. The false assumption was made that an
event was caused by another which had immediately preceded it ; and hence it was laid down that whenever
two events had been observed to follow one upon the
other, the recurrence of the first would cause the other
to follow again. The assumption was an illustration of
the well-known fallacy : ‘ Post hoc, ergo propter hoc.”
It produced both the pseudo-science of astrology and
the pseudo-science of augury.
The standard work on astronomy, as has already been
noted, was that called ‘ The Observations of Bel/ com
piled originally for the library of Sargon I at Accad.
Additions were made to it from time to time, the chief object of the work being to notice the events which happened after each celestial phenomenon. Thus the
occurrences which at different periods followed a solar
eclipse on a particular day were all duly introduced
into the text and piled, as it were, one upon the other.
The table of contents prefixed to the work showed that
H2



Il6 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
it treated of various matters— eclipses of the sun and
moon, the conjunction of the sun and moon, the phases
of Venus and Mars, the position of the pole-star, the
changes of the weather, the appearance of comets, or, as
they are called, ‘ stars with a tail behind and a corona in
front,’ and the like. The immense collection of records
of eclipses indicates the length of time during which
observations of the heavens had been carried on. As it
is generally stated whether a solar eclipse had happened
‘ according to calculation ’ or ‘ contrary to calculation,’ it
is clear that the Babylonians were acquainted at an
early date with the periodicity of eclipses of the sun.
The beginning of the year was determined by the
position of the star Dilgan (a Aurigm) in relation to
the new moon at the vernal equinox, and the night
was originally divided into three watches. Subsequently
the kasbu or ‘double hour’ was introduced to mark
time, twelve kasbu being equivalent to a night and day.
Time itself was measured by a clepsydra or water-clock,
as well as by a gnomon or dial. The dial set up by
Ahaz at Jerusalem (2 Kings xx. n) was doubtless one
of the fruits of his intercourse with the Assyrians.
The Zodiacal signs had been marked out and named
at that remote period when the sun was still in Taurus
at the beginning of spring, and the equator had been
divided into sixty degrees. The year was correspond
ingly divided into twelve months, each of thirty days,
intercalary months being counted in by the priests when
necessary. The British Museum possesses fragments of



ART, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE. II 7
a planisphere from Nineveh, representing the sky at the
time of the vernal equinox, the constellation of Tam
muz or Orion being specially noticeable upon it. Another
tablet contains a table of lunar longitudes.
With all this attention to astronomical matters it is
not surprising that every great city boasted of an
observatory, erected on the summit of a lofty tower. Astronomers were appointed by the state to take charge
of these observatories, and to send in fortnightly reports
to the king. Here are specimens of them, the first ol
which is dated B.C. 649:—‘To the king, my lord, thy
servant Istar-iddin-pal, one of the chief astronomers of
Arbela. May there be peace to the king, my lord, may
Nebo, Merodach, and Istar of Arbela, be favourable to
the king, my lord. On the twenty-ninth day we kept a
watch. The observatory was covered with cloud : the
moon we did not see. (Dated) the month Sebat, the
first day, the eponymy of Bel-kharran-Sadua.’ ‘ To
the king, my lord, thy servant Abil-Istar. May there
be peace to the king, my lord. May Nebo and Mero
dach be propitious to the king, my lord. May the great
gods grant unto the king, my lord, long days, soundness
of body, and joy of heart. On the twenty-seventh day
(of the month) the moon disappeared. On the twenty
eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days, we kept a
watch for the eclipse of the sun. But the sun did not
pass into eclipse. On the first day the moon was seen during the day. During the month Tammuz (June) it
was above the planet Mercury, as I have already re

ported to the king. During the period when the moon
is called Anu (i.e., from the first to the fifth days of the
lunar month), it was seen declining in the orbit of
Arcturus. Owing to the rain the horn was not visible.
Such is my report. During the period when the moon
was Anu, I sent to the king, my lord, the following
account of its conjunction :—It was stationary and
visible below the star of the chariot. During the period
when the moon is called Bel (i.e., from the tenth to the
fifteenth day), it became full ; to the star of the chariot
it approached. Its conjunction (with the star) was pre
vented ; but its conjunction with Mercury, during the
period when it was Anu, of which I have already sent a
report to the king, my lord, was not prevented. May
the king, my lord, have peace !
’
Astronomical observations imply a knowledge of
mathematics, and in this the Babylonians and Assy
rians seem to have excelled. Tables of squares and
cubes have been found at Senkereh, the ancient Larsa,
and a series of geometrical figures used for augural
purposes presupposes a sort of Babylonian Euclid.
The mathematical unit was 60, which was understood
as a multiple when high numbers had to be expressed,
IV, for example, standing for (4 x 60 =) 240. Similarly,
60 was the unwritten denominator of fractional num
bers. The plan of an estate outside the gate of Zamama
at Babylon, and belonging to the time of Nebuchad
nezzar, has been discovered, while the famous Hanging
Gardens of that city were watered by means of a screw.



ART, LITERATURE, AND SCIENCE. II9
Medicine also was in a more advanced state than
might have been expected. Fragments of an old work
on medicine have been found, which show that all
known diseases had been classified, and their symptoms
described, the medical mixtures considered appropriate
to each being compounded and prescribed quite in
modern fashion. Here is one of them : ‘ For a diseased
gall-bladder, which devours the top of a man’s heart
like a ring (?) . . . within the sick (part), we pre
pare cypress-extract, goats’ milk, palm-wine, barley, the
flesh of an ox and bear, and the wine of the cellarer, in
order that the sick man may live. Half an ephah of
clear honey, half an ephah of cypress-extract, half an
ephah of gamgam herbs, half an ephah of linseed, half an
ephah of . . . , half an ephah of imdi herbs, half an
ephah of the seed of tarrati, half an ephah of calves’ milk,
half an ephah of semi wood, half an ephah of tik powder,
half an ephah of the ... of the river-god, half an
ephah of usu wood, half an ephah of mountain medicine,
half an ephah of the flesh (?) of a dove, half an ephah of
the seed of the . . ., half an ephah of the corn of
the field, ten measures of the juice of a cut herb, ten
measures of the tooth of the sea (sea-weed), one ephah
of putrid flesh (?), one ephah of dates, one ephah of palm-wine and insik, and one ephah of the flesh (?) of
the entrails ; slice and cut up ; or mix as a mixture,
after first stirring it with a reed. On the fourth day
observe (the sick man’s) countenance. If it shows a
white appearance his heart is cured ; if it shows a dark



120 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
appearance his heart is still devoured by the fire ; if it
shows a yellow appearance during the day, the patient’s
recovery is assured ; if it shows a black appearance he
will grow worse and will not live. For the swelling (?),
slice (the flesh of) a cow which has entered the stall and
has been slaughtered during the day. Seethe it in water
and calves’ milk. Drink the result in palm-wine. Drink
it during the day.’
Generally, however, the prescriptions are not so
elaborate as this. They are more usually of this nature :
‘ For low spirits, slice the root of the destiny tree, the
root of the susum tree, two or three other vegetable compounds, and the tongue of a dog. Drink the mix
ture either in water or in palm-wine.’
Even medical science, however, was invaded by super
stition. In place of trying the doctor’s prescription, a
patient often had the choice allowed him of having
recourse to charms and exorcisms. Thus the medical
work itself permits him to ‘place an incantation on the
big toe of the left foot and cause it to remain ’ there,
the incantation being as follows : ‘ O wind, my mother,
wind, wind, the handmaid of the gods art thou ; O wind
among the storm-birds ; yea, the water dost thou make
stream down, and with the gods thy brothers liftest up
the glory of thy wisdom.’ At other times a witch or
sorceress was called in, and told to ‘bind a cord twice
seven times, binding it on the sick man’s neck and on
his feet like fetters, and while he lies in his bed to
pour pure water over him.’ Instead of the knotted cord

verses from a sacred book might be employed, just as
phylacteries were, and still are, among the Jews. Thus
we read : ‘ In the night-time let a verse from a good
tablet be placed on the head of the sick man in bed.’
The word translated ‘verse’ is masal, the Hebrew mashal
\
which literally signifies a ‘ proverb ’ or ‘ parable.’
It is curious to find the witch by the side of the wizard
in Babylonia. ‘ The wise woman,’ however, was held in
great repute there, and just as the witches of Europe
were supposed to fly through the air on a broomstick so
it was believed that the witches of Babylonia could
perform the same feat with the help of a wooden staff.

CHAPTER V.
Manners and Customs; Trade and Government.
The monuments of Assyria do not give us the same
assistance as those of Egypt in learning about the
manners and customs of its inhabitants. We find there
no. tombs whose pictured walls set before us the daily
life and doings of the people. We have to acquire our
knowledge from the bas-reliefs of the royal palaces,
which represent to us rather the pomp of the court and
the conquest of foreign nations than scenes taken from
ordinary Assyrian life. It is only incidentally that the
manners and customs of the lower classes are depicted.
It is true that we can learn a good deal from the
contract-tablets and other kinds of what may be called
the private literature of Babylonia and Assyria. At
present, however, but a small portion of these has been
examined, and a literature can never paint so fully and
distinctly the manners and customs of the day as the
picture or sculpture on the wall. It is only in times
comparatively modern that the novelist has sought to
give a faithful portrait of the life of the peasant and
artisan.
The dress of the upper classes in Assyria did not
differ essentially from that of the well-to-do Oriental of



MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 123
to-day. In time of peace the king was dressed in a robe
which reached to the ankles, bound round the waist
with a broad belt, while a mantle was thrown over his
shoulders, and a tiara or fillet was worn on his head.
The tiara sometimes resembled the triple tiara of the
Pope, sometimes was of cone-like shape, and the fillet
was furnished with two long bandelettes which fell
down behind. The robe and mantle were alike richly embroidered and edged with fringes. The arms were
left bare, except in so far as they could be covered by
the mantle, and a heavy pair of bracelets encircled each,
the workmanship of the jewelry being similar to that
of the chain which was worn round the neck. The feet
were shod with sandals which had a raised part behind
to protect the heels, and they were fastened to the feet
by a ring through which the great toe passed, and a
latchet over the instep. Sandals of precisely the same
character are still used in Mesopotamia. The monarch’s
dress in war was similar to that used in time of peace,
except that he carried a belt for daggers, while a fringed
apron took the place of the mantle. Boots laced in
front were also sometimes substituted for the sandals.
The upper classes, and more especially the officials
about court, wore a costume similar to that of the king,
only of course, less rich and costly. In all cases they
were distinguished by the long fringed sleeveless robe
which descended to the ankles. The dress of the
soldiers and of the common people generally was quite
different. It consisted only of the tunic, over which in

all probability the long robe of the wealthy was worn,
and which did not quite reach the knees. Sometimes a
sort of jacket was put on above it, and, in a few
instances, a simple kilt seems to take its place. The kilt
was frequently worn under the tunic, which was fastened
round the waist by a girdle or sword-belt. The arms,
legs, and feet, were bare. Some of the soldiers, how
ever, wore sandals, and others, more particularly the
cavalry, wore boots, which were laced in front, and came
half way up the leg. The upper part of the legs was
occasionally protected by drawers of leather or chain
armour, and we even find tunics made of the same
materials. Helmets were also employed, but the
common soldier usually covered his head with a simple
skull-cap.
The dress of the women consisted of a long tunic and
mantle, and a fillet for confining the hair.
The king and his officers rode in chariots even when
on a campaign. In crossing mountains the chariots
often had to be carried on the shoulders of men or
animals, their wheels being sometimes first taken off for
the purpose. The chariot was large enough to contain
not only the king but an umbrella-bearer and a cha
rioteer as well. The latter held the reins in both hands,
each rein being single and fastened to either side of a
snaffle-like bit. When in the field the royal chariot was
followed by a bow-bearer and a quiver-bearer, as well
as by led horses, intended to assist the monarch to
escape, should the fortune of battle turn against him.



MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 125
The chariot was drawn by two horses, a third horse
being usually attached to it by a thong in order to

take the place of one of the other two if an accident
occurred. Beside the chariots the army was accompanied by
a corps of cavalry. In the time of the first Assyrian
Empire the cavalry-soldier rode on the bare back of the
horse, with his knees crouched up in front of him
;
subsequently saddles were introduced, though not
stirrups.
The cavalry was divided into two corps-—the heavy
and the light-armed. The latter were armed only with



126 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
the bow and arrow and a guard for the wrist, and were
chiefly employed in skirmishing. Most of the archers,
however, belonged to the infantry. The Assyrians were
particularly skilled in the use of the bow, and their
superiority in war was probably in great measure due to
it. Besides the bow they employed the spear, the short
dagger or dirk, and the sword, which was of two kinds.
The ordinary kind was long and straight, the less usual
kind being curved, like a scimetar. For defence, round
shields, of no great size, were carried.
Only the king and the chief nobles were allowed the
luxury of a tent. The common soldier had to sleep on
the ground, wrapped up in a blanket or plaid. The
tent was probably of felt, and had an opening in the
centre through which the smoke of a fire might escape.
Not only, however, was a sleeping-tent carried for the
king, a cooking-tent was carried also. So also was the
royal chair, called a nimedu, on which the monarch sat
when stationary in camp. The chair may be seen in the
bas-relief, now in the British Museum, which represents
Sennacherib sitting upon it in front of the captured
town of Lachish. Above is a short inscription which
tells us that ‘ Sennacherib, the king of legions, the king
of Assyria, sat on an upright throne, and the spoil of the
city of Lachish passed before him.’
There were various means for assaulting a hostile
town. Sometimes scaling-ladders were used, sometimes
the walls were undermined with crowbars and pickaxes ; sometimes a battering-ram was employed armed with



MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 127
one or two spear-like projections ; sometimes fire was
applied to the enemy’s gates. Other engines are men

tioned in the inscriptions, but as they have not been
found depicted on the monuments it is difficult to
identify them.
The barbarities which followed the capture of a town
would be almost incredible, were they not a subject of
boast in the inscriptions which record them. Assur
natsir-pal’s cruelties were especially revolting. Pyramids
of human heads marked the path of the conqueror ;
boys and girls were burned alive or reserved for a worse
fate ; men were impaled, flayed alive, blinded, or de
prived of their hands and feet, of their ears and noses,
while the women and children were, carried into slavery,
the captured city plundered and reduced to ashes, and
the trees in its neighbourhood cut down. During the second Assyrian Empire warfare was a little more
humane, but the most horrible tortures were still exer



128 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
cised upon the vanquished. How deeply-seated was the
thirst for blood and vengeance on an enemy is exempli
fied in a bas-relief which represents Assur-bani-pal and
his queen feasting in their garden while the head of the
conquered Elamite king hangs from a tree above.
The Assyrians made use of chairs, tables, and couches.
A piece of sculpture from Khorsabad introduces us to
a scene in which the priests of the king are seated, two
on a chair on either side of a four-legged table. Their
sandals are removed, as was the custom among the
Greeks when eating. In the luxurious days of Assur
bani-pal the couch seems to have partially taken the
place of the chair, since in the scene alluded to above
the king is depicted reclining, though the queen sits in a
chair by his side. The number of different kinds of
food mentioned in the inscriptions seems to imply that
the Assyrians were fond of good living. The common
people, it is true, lived mostly on bread, fruit, and vege
tables ; but the monuments show us soldiers engaged in
slaughtering and cooking oxen and sheep.
Wine was the usual beverage at a banquet, and the
Assyrians appear to have resembled the Persians in
their indulgence in it. Various sorts of wine are
enumerated in the inscriptions, most of which were
imported from abroad. Among the most highly prized was the wine of Khilbun or Helbon, which is mentioned
in Ezek. xxvii. 18, and was grown near Damascus at a
village still called Halbun. Besides grape-wine, palm
wine, made from dates, was brought from Babylon, and



MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. I29
beer, milk, cream, butter or ghee, and oil, were all much
used. At a feast the wine was ladled out of a large
vase into cups, which were then presented to the
guests.
The table was ornamented with flowers, and musicians
were hired to amuse the banqueters. No less than
seven or eight different musical instruments were known,
among them the harp, the lyre, and the tambourine.
The lyre seems to have been specially employed at
feasts, and the harp for the performance of sacred
music. The instrumental music was at times accom
panied by the voice, and bands of musicians celebrated
the triumphant return of the king from war.
Polygamy was permitted—at all events to the monarch
—and the palace was accordingly guarded by a whole
army of eunuchs. They were generally in attendance
on the sovereign, like the scribes whose offices were
continually needed in both peace and war. Another
attendant must not be forgotten—the servant who stood
behind the king armed with a fly-flap, and was almost
a necessity in hot weather. Considering the number of
captives carried away every year to Assyria in the
successful campaigns of its rulers, slaves must have been
very plentiful in Nineveh. Indeed, after the Arabian
campaign of Assur-bani-pal we are told that a camel
was sold for half a shekel of silver, and that a man was
worth a correspondingly small sum. Next to hunting men the chief employment and delight of an Assyrian king was to hunt wild beasts.
I



130 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
Tiglath-Pileser I had hunted elephants in the land of
the Hittites, as the Egyptian Pharaohs had done before
him ; subsequently the extinction of the elephant in
Western Asia caused his successors to content them
selves with lesser game. The reem or wild bull and the
lion became their favourite sport, smaller animals like
the gazelle, the hare, and the wild ass being left to their
subjects to pursue. It was not until the reign of Assur
bani-pal that the lion-hunt ceased to be a dangerous and
exciting pastime. With Esar-haddon, however, the old
race of warrior kings had come to an end, and the new
king introduced a new style of sport. The lions were
now caught and kept in cages, until they were turned
out for a royal battue. As they had to be whipped into
activity, neither the monarch nor his companions could
have run much risk of being harmed.
The Assyrians were not an agricultural people like
the Babylonians. .Nevertheless, the kings had their
paradises or parks, and the wealthier classes their
gardens or shrubberies. The garden was planted with
trees rather than with flowers or herbs, and afforded a
shady retreat during the summer months. Tiglath
Pileser I had even established a sort of botanical garden,
in which he tried to acclimatise some of the trees he
had met with in his campaigns. He tells us of it : * As
for the cedar, the likkarin tree, and the almug, from the
countries I have conquered, these trees, which none of
the kings my fathers that were before me had planted,
I took, and in the gardens of my land I planted, and by



MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 131
the name of garden I called them ; whatsoever in my
land there was not I took, and I established the gardens of Assyria/ The gardens were abundantly watered
from the river or canal, by the side of which they were
usually planted. Summer-houses were built in the
midst of them, and as early as the time of Sennacherib
we meet with a ‘ hanging garden,’ grown on the roof of
a building.
Fishing was carried on with a line merely, and with
out a rod. The fisherman sat on the bank, or else
swam in the water, supporting himself on an inflated
skin.
These inflated skins were largely used in warfare for
conveying troops and animals across a stream. The
chief officers, along with their chariots and commissariat,
were ferried across in boats, but the soldiers had to strip,
and with the help of the skins convey themselves, their
arms, the horses, and other baggage to the opposite bank.
At times a pontoon-bridge of boats was constructed, at other times the Assyrian army was fortunate enough
to meet with bridges of stone or wood. In fact, such
bridges existed on all the main roads which it traversed.
Western Asia was more thickly populated then than is
at present the case, and the roads were not only more
numerous than they are to-day, but better kept. Hence
the ease and rapidity with which large bodies of men
were moved by the Assyrian kings from one part of
Asia to another. Where a road did not already exist, it



132 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
was made by the advancing army, timber being cleared and a highway thrown up for the purpose.
As road-makers the Assyrians seem to have antici
pated the Romans. Both their military and their
•trading instincts led them in this direction. It was only
when they came to the water that their career was
checked. Excellent as they were as soldiers, they never
became sailors. The boats of the Tigris and Euphrates
were either rafts or circular coracles of skins stretched
on a wooden framework. When Sennacherib wished to
attack the Chaldeans of Bit-Yagina in their place of
refuge on the Persian Gulf, he had to transport Phoeni
cians from the west to build his galleys, and to navigate
them afterwards. It was the Babylonians ‘whose cry
was in their ships ;
’ the Assyrians fought and traded on
shore.
It was not until the rise of the Second Assyrian
Empire that the trade of Assyria became important.
The earlier kings had gone forth to war for the sake of
booty or out of mere caprice ; Tiglath-Pileser II and his
successors aimed at getting the commerce of the world
into the hands <of their own subjects. The fall of
Carchemish and the overthrow of the Phoenician cities
enabled them to carry out their design. Nineveh
became a busy centre of trade, from whence caravans
went and returned north and south, east and west.
The old Hittite standard of weight, called ‘ the maneh
of Carchemish ’ by the Assyrians, was made the ordinary legal standard, and Aramaic became the common lan



MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 133
guage of trade. Not unfrequently an Aramaic docket
accompanies an Assyrian contract tablet, stating briefly
what were its contents and the names of the chief con
tracting parties. These contract tablets have to do with
the sale and lease of houses, slaves, and other property,
as well as with the amount of interest to be paid upon
loans. We learn from them that the rate of interest
was usually as low as four per cent., and when objects
like bronze were borrowed as three per cent. House
property naturally varied in value. A house sold at
Nineveh on the sixteenth of Sivan or May, B.C. 692,
fetched one maneh of silver or £ 9, the average price of
a slave. Thus, three Israelites, as Dr. Oppert believes,
were sold by a Phoenician on the twentieth of Ab or
July, B.C. 709, for ^27, retractation or annulment of the
sale being subject to a penalty of about ^230, part of
which was to go to the temple of Istar of Arbela.
Twenty years later, however, as many as seven slaves, among them an Israelite, Hoshea, and his two wives,
were sold for the same price, while we find a girl
handed over by her parents to an Egyptian lady Nitdkris, who wished to marry her to her son Takhos,
for the small sum of £2 iox. The last deed of sale, by
the way, proves that wives in Assyria could sometimes
be bought.
All deeds and contracts were signed and sealed in
the presence of a number of attesting witnesses, who
attached their seals, or, if they were too poor to possess
any, their nail-marks, to the documents. It was then



134 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
enclosed in an outer coating of clay, on which an
abstract of its contents was given. Sometimes a further
document on papyrus was fastened to it by means of a
string.
It was only in the case of the monarch himself that
the signatures of attesting witnesses were dispensed
with. The British Museum possesses a sort of private
will made by Sennacherib in favour of Esar-haddon,
when the latter was not as yet heir-apparent to the
throne. In this no witnesses are mentioned, and it is
considered sufficient that the document should be lodged
in the imperial archives. It runs as follows :
‘ I, Senna
cherib, king of legions, king of Assyria, bequeathe
armlets of gold, quantities of ivory, a platter of gold,
ornaments and chains for the neck, all these beautiful
things of which there are heaps, and three sorts of pre
cious stones, i \ manehs and 2 \ shekels in weight, to
Esar-haddon, my son, whose name was afterwards
changed to Assur-sar-illik-pal by my wish. I have
deposited the treasure in the house of Amuk. Thine is the kingdom, O Nebo, our light ! ’ Payments, it must
be remembered, were still made by weight, coined
money not having been introduced until after the time
of Nebuchadnezzar.
The business-like character of the trading community
of Nineveh will best be gathered from the documents
themselves which have been left to us. It will, there
fore, not be out of place to add here translations of some
of the contract tablets :




MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 135
I. ‘Ten shekels of the best silver for the head of Istar of
Nineveh, which Bil-lubaladh has lent on a loan in the
presence of Mannu-ki-Arbela [here follow three seals] ;
the silver is to have interest paid upon it at lour per

Khanni, and Bel-sad-ili.’
Then follow two lines and a half of Aramaic, the first
of which contains the name of Mannu-ki-Arbela.
II. ‘Two talents of bronze, the property of Istar of Arbela,
which Mannu-ki-Arbela gives to the goddess in the month Ab, in the presence of Samas-akhi-erba ; if they
are given, interest shall be paid on them at three per
cent. (Dated) the eleventh day of Si /an, in the

III. ‘ Four manehs of silver, according to the standard of
Carchemish, which Neriglissor, in the presence of Nebo
sum-iddin, son of Nebo-rahim-baladhi the superinten
dent of the Guards at Dur-Sargon (Khorsabad), lends
out at five shekels of silver per month interest. (Dated)
the twenty-sixth day of the month of Iyyar, in the
eponymy of Gabbaru (b.c. 667). The witnesses are
:

eponymy of Mannu-ki-Assur-lih ’ (b.g 709).
It will be noticed that the Israelitish witnesses to the
last deed of sale, Pekah and Nadabiah, hold public
offices, though the exact nature of them is at present
unknown. We may conclude from this that some of the
Samaritan captives were allowed to live in Nineveh, and
so far from being in a condition of slavery were able to



138 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
be in the service of the state. Among the earliest
known examples of Israelitish or Jewish writing are
seals which probably belong to a period anterior to the
Babylonish Exile, and have been found at Diarbekr
and other places in the neighbourhood of the Tigris
and Euphrates. It is also possible that the great
banking firm of Egibi, which flourished at Babylon from
the time of Sennacherib and Esar-haddon to that of
Darius and Xerxes, and carried on business transactions
as extensive as those of the Rothschilds of to-day, was
of Israelitish origin. At all events the name Egibi is
not Babylonian, while it is a very exact Babylonian
transcript of the Biblical name Jacob.
The contract tablets throw a good deal of light upon
Assyrian law. In its main outlines it did not differ
much from our own. Precedents and previous decisions
seem to have been held in as high estimation as among
our own lawyers. The king was the supreme court of
appeal, and copies exist of private petitions preferred to
him on a variety of matters. Judges were appointed
under the king, and prisons were established in the
towns. An old Babylonian code of moral precepts
addressed to princes denounces the ruler who listens to
the evil advice of his courtiers, and does not deliver
judgment ‘according to the statutes,’ ‘the law-book,’
and ‘the writing of the god Ea.’ The earliest existing
code of laws is one which goes back to the Accadian
epoch, and contains an express enactment for pro
tecting the slave against his master. How far it was



MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 139
made the basis of subsequent Semitic legislation it is
difficult to say ; in one respect, at all events, it differed
considerably from the law which followed it. This was
in the position it assigned to women. Among the
Accadians, the woman was the equal of man ; in fact,
she ranked before the husband in matters relating to the family; whereas among the Semites she was degraded
to a very inferior rank. It is curious to find the
Semitic translator of an Accadian text invariably
changing the order in which the words for man and
woman, male and female occur in the original. In the Accadian the order is ‘ woman and man,’ in the AssyroBabylonian translation, ‘ man and woman. 5
The high-roads were placed under the charge of
commissioners, and in Babylonia, where brick-making
was an important occupation, the brick-yards as well.
Certain of the taxes, which were raised alike from
citizens and aliens, were devoted to the maintenance
of them. Unfortunately we know but little at present
of the precise way in which the taxes were levied, and
the principle on which they were distributed among the
various classes of the population. In Babylonia, how
ever, the tenant does not seem to have paid much to
the government, since we are told of him that after
handing over one-third of the produce of an estate to his
landlord, he might keep the rest of it for himself. There
is no hint that any portion of it was distrained for the
state.
As in modern Turkey, the imperial exchequer after



140 ASSYRIA: ITS PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PEOPLE.
the time of Tiglath-Pileser II was supplied by fixed
contributions from the separate provinces and large
towns. Thus Nineveh itself was assessed at thirty
talents. The best way, however, of giving an idea of
the assessment is by a translation of the few fragments
of the assessment lists of the Second Empire which have
been preserved to us.

In spite of the fragmentary character of these lists,
and the difficulty of understanding them perfectly in
consequence of their brevity and the omission of prepo
sitions, we may nevertheless glean from them a fair
idea of the method in which the imperial exchequer of
Assyria was replenished, and the objects to which the
taxes and tribute were devoted. A considerable amount
1 The Kue or Kuans inhabited the northern and eastern shores of the Gulf of Antioch. M. Frangois Lenormant has ingeniously suggested that in I Kings x. 28, we ought to read (with a slight change of vowel punctuation), ‘And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and out of Kue the king’s merchants received a drove at a price.’

must have gone to the great army of officials by whom
the Second Empire was administered. ‘The great king,’
it was true, was autocratic like the Russian Czar, but
like the Russian Czar he was also controlled by a bureaucracy which managed the government under him.
In military matters alone he was supreme, though even
here two commanders-in-chief stood at his side, ready to
take his place in the command of the troops whenever
age or disinclination detained him at home. The lists
of Assyrian officials which we possess are very lengthy,
and their titles seem almost endless. At the head came
the two commanders-in-chief, the Turtannu or Tartan of
the right, and the Turtannu of the left, doubtless so
called from their position on the right and left of the
king. Next to them were the Chamberlain or superin
tendent of the singing men and women, and then after
five other officials whose posts are obscure, the ‘ Rab
sak * or ‘ Rab-shakeh.’ His title means literally ‘chief
of the princes/ and he corresponded to the Vizier or
Prime Minister of the Turkish Empire. Among other
public offices we may notice that of the astronomer,
who was supported by the state like the rest, and who
ranked immediately after the ‘superintendent of the
camel-stables.’ The latter again was inferior in rank to
the ‘captain of the watch/ ‘the captain of fifty/ ‘the
overseer of the vineyards/ and ‘ the overseer of the
quays.’
Such, then, was the constitution of the great Assyrian
Empire, which first endeavoured to organise Western



MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. r 45
Asia into a single homogeneous whole, and in effecting
its purpose cared neither for justice nor for humanity.
Nineveh was ‘ full of lies and robbery,’ but it was God’s
instrument in chastising His chosen people, and in pre
paring the way for the ages that were to come, and for
a while, therefore, it was allowed to ‘ make the earth empty ’ and ‘ waste.’ But the day came when its work
was accomplished, and the measure of its iniquity was
full. Nineveh, ‘ the bloody city,’ fell, never to rise again
and the doom pronounced by Nahum was fulfilled. For
centuries the very site of the imperial city remained
unknown, and the traveller and historian alike put the
vain question : ‘ Where is the dwelling of the lions, and
the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion,
even the old lion, walked, and the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid ? *

* In the eponymy of Dayan-Assur (b.C. 854) on the
14th of the month Iyyar I left the city of Nineveh. The river Tigris I crossed. I approached the cities of Giammu on the river Balikh. The fear of my lordship,
the sight of my strong weapons they feared, and in the
service of themselves they slew Giammu their lord. I descended into the cities of Kitlala and Tul-sa-abil-akhi [the mound of the son of the brother] ; I caused
my gods to enter his palaces ; a plundering in his palaces I made. I opened his store-chambers ; his treasures I seized. His goods, his spoil, I carried off
;
to my city of Assur I brought (them). From the city of Kitlala I departed ; to the city of the Fort of Shalmaneser [Tul-Barsip, the Barsampse of Ptolemy] I approached. In boats of inflated skins for the second time I crossed the Euphrates at its flood.

Euphrates, and above the river Saguri [the Sajur], which the Hittites call the city of Pethor, in the midst (of it) I received. From the Euphrates I departed. The city of Khalman [Aleppo] I approached ; they
feared battle ; they embraced my feet. Silver and gold I received as their tribute ; I offered sacrifices before the
god Rimmon of Khalman. From the city of Khalman I departed ; to two cities of Irkhulena of Hamath I
approached. The cities of Adennu [the Eden of Amos i. 5], Barga and Argana his royal city I captured.1 His spoil, his goods, and the treasures of his palaces I brought out. To his palaces I set fire. From the city of Argana I departed, the city of Karkar [Aroer] I approached. (His) royal city of Karkar I threw down, dug up, and burned with fire. 1,200 chariots, 1,200 horsemen, and 20,000 men of Hadadezer of Damascus, 700 chariots, 700 horsemen, and 10,000 men

of Bahsa son of Rukhubi [Rehob] of Ammon, these twelve kings (Irkhulena) brought to his help, and to (make) war and battle against me they had come. With the exalted help which Assur the lord rendered, with the mighty weapons which the great protector who goes
before me bestowed, I fought with them. From the city of Karkar to the city of Guzau I overthrew them. 14.000 of their troops I slew with weapons. Like Rimmon, the air-god, I caused the storm to come forth upon them. I filled the surface of the water with their (wrecks). I laid low their wide-spread forces with weapons. The low ground of the district received (?)

‘ In my eighteenth year for the sixteenth time I crossed the Euphrates. Hazael, of Damascus, trusted in the might of his army, and assembled his army
without number. He made Mount Shenir, the highest peak of the mountains which are as you come to Mount Lebanon, his fortress. I fought with him ; I overthrew him ; 16,000 of his fighting men I slew with weapons, 1,121 of his chariots, 470 of his horsemen, along with
his camp, I took from him. To save his life he ascended (the country) ; I pursued after him. In Damascus, his royal city, I shut him up ; his plantations I cut down. To the mountains of the Hauran I went ; cities innumerable I threw down, I dug up, I burned with fire ; their spoil innumerable I carried away. To the mountains of Baal-rosh at the promontory of the sea I
went ; I made an image of my majesty there. At that time I received the tribute of the Tyrians, of the Sidonians, and of Jehu, son of Omri.’

descriptive appellation signifying ‘water-boundary’ at first, but was slightly changed by the Semitic conquerors so as to mean ‘ gracious ;’ the name of Sar, the god of the firmament, in time, was confused with that of the patron deity, and Assur thus came to signify the city, country, and the deity; hence Assur represented at the same time the power and constitution of Assyria, the ‘gracious’ god, and the primeval firmament; ruins now called Kalah Sherghat, 21-2.

Shalmaneser I said to have built Calah, and his descendants reigned uninterruptedly six generations, 27.
