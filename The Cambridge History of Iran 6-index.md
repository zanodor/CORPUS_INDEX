PREFACE
The period of Iranian history from the death of the last important Il-Khan, Abu Sa'Id, in 1335 down to the mid 18th century has scarcely received adequate notice from western historians. Since this volume was first conceived, the void has been filled partially by two works in English, The Aqquyunlu by J. E. Woods (1976) and R. M. Savory's Iran under the Safavids (1980). But there is as yet no authoritative monograph on Tlmur or the Timurids (with the qualified exception of Barthold's work on Ulugh Beg and on the court of Husain Balqara); and the standard work on the Qara Quyunlu is in Turkish. It is not the least merit of Professor Roemer's first four chapters, therefore, to make the pre-Safavid era as a whole accessible and intelligible to the Western reader. The relative neglect from which late medieval and early modern Iran has suffered is all the more remarkable when it is borne in mind that this period witnessed the first emergence of Iran as a "national" state enjoying a recognisable continuity with the present day. To a large extent this was of course fortuitous rather than a matter of conscious policy on the part of the Safavid rulers. The defeat at Chaldiran ensured that the Safavids would not extend their power into Anatolia, just as the simultaneous rise of the Uzbeks and of the Mughal empire curtailed attempts to enter into the Timurid political legacy in the east. Yet the fact remains that under the Safavid dynasty, which contrived to last longer than any of its predecessors since the Islamic conquest, Iran came to constitute a single political entity roughly within its present-day boundaries. The part played in this process by the adoption of Shl'a Islam as the state religion; the reshaping of the Persian monarchic ideal; the need to resolve the conflicts inherent in Iranian society, as for instance between tribal and non-tribal elements all these are problems which merit detailed investigation. The period has other fascinations for Western Europe. If diplomatic contact between Iran and the West had begun under the Tl-Khans, it had nevertheless been shortlived. Not until the late 15 th century, in the time of the Aq Quyunlu, did such exchanges become a regular phenomenon, fortified under both Uzun Hasan and his Safavid heirs by the common hostility of the parties concerned towards the Ottoman empire. These contacts, and the growing attractiveness of Iran also to Western merchants in search of manufactures and raw materials,

endow the Safavid period especially with a wealth of European travellers' reports which are among our principal sources for the country's political, economic and social history. This volume was first planned in 1961, when Laurence Lockhart was appointed editor, and invitations to most of the contributors had been sent out by the end of 1963. Several chapters were as yet unfinished or awaited translation into English at the time of Lockhart's death in 1976. Professor J. A. Boyle, who had produced the fifth volume in this series, then took over the editorship of volume 6, but had been able to do very little when he in turn died two years later. It has fallen to me, as editor since the autumn of 1979, to receive the chapters still outstanding, to edit and prepare the entire manuscript for the press. Some of the contributors - Professor Savory, Dr Hillenbrand and Mr Gray - have revised their chapters within the last few years; and we are indebted to Professor Schimmel and Professor Yarshater for adding, at somewhat short notice, two valuable chapters to the literature section of the volume. The remaining chapters were drafted earlier, and consequently the most recent research has not been taken into account. For this, of course, the authors themselves are not to blame. It should also be mentioned that the maps and genealogical tables were drafted by me and not by the authors of the chapters within which they are located. Every effort has been made to achieve a high degree of standardisation throughout the volume. I have adhered, on the whole, to the system of transliteration followed in volume 4 and to the practice adopted there of using italics only for the first appearance of technical terms, and roman characters thereafter, within each chapter. A major difficulty has arisen from the fact that, even in the period covered by this volume, Arabic names and terms are by no means totally eclipsed by Persian ones, and that it is necessary to employ different transcriptions (Arabic th, dh, d, and w for Persian /, £, % and v). The results may occasionally seem startling, as when the convention is applied to the titles of books written by the same author but in different languages; or in the case of the Islamic months and of religious and philosophical terminology, which have been given in their Arabic form (thus qadt rather than qa^t, except where part of a proper name, as in QazI Burhan al-Dln). The ligature used in previous volumes, indicating that the roman letters concerned represent a single consonant in the AraboPersian alphabet, has been discarded. Diacritical marks are also omit



PREFACE XX111
ted, for example, in the names of dynasties where these are anglicised (thus Safaviyya, but Safavids) and in such titles as shah unless an integral part of a proper name (thus Jahan Shah, Shah Jahan; but Shah 'Abbas). For Turkish and Mongol words and names I have slightly modified the system of transcription found in volume 5; and in any case those dynasties which held extensive sway over Iranian territory, as did the later Qara Quyunlu and Aq Quyunlu rulers, have been treated as if they were Persian. It is hoped that the adoption of these admittedly complex principles will have proved more vexatious to the editor than to the reader. It remains to thank those who contributed to the completion of this volume. Hubert Darke, the Editorial Secretary for the Cambridge History of Iran, has been of considerable assistance with the bibliography, plates and figures. I have benefited also from the help of Iain White, who sub-edited the manuscript. My colleagues and friends at Keele have had to live with me while I wrestled with editorial tasks; I should like finally to thank them for their patience and good humour. The Publishers and the Editorial Board of The Cambridge History of Iran are grateful for a generous donation from The Yarshater Fund, Columbia University.

CHAPTER I
THE JALAYIRIDS, MUZAFFARIDS AND
SARBADARS
THE LAST CHINGIZIDS
The end of the Il-Khanid empire resulted in Persia, if not in the creation of a vacuum, at any rate in a dilution of power, which worked in favour of various forces contending for authority in the state. The rivals involved in the struggles which now began fall into three categories. The most obvious of these were princes from several lines of the dynasty of Chingiz Khan, who looked to a restoration of centralised Mongol rule. They set about their task partly on their own initiative and partly as mere figureheads put up by legitimist groupings in the background. A second group was the representatives of local dynasties or highly placed families, who had served the Tl-Khans as generals or senior servants of the state, and also the leaders of powerful tribal associations. And there were,finally,other groups for whom what mattered was not dynastic or aristocratic considerations but religious adherence to Shl'I or extremist movements. The power struggles that went on within or between these groups lasted for half a century. Though one or other of the rivals might for a time contrive to establish a certain measure of political and economic stability in his area of effective control, none had any lasting success, and there was no question of their unifying the country alone and unaided. Whatever the hardships Persia suffered as a result of divisions and chaotic conditions, even greater sacrifices were demanded of the people when, at the beginning of the eighties of the 8th/14th century, reunification was finally achieved: imposed, in fact, from outside by the conqueror Tlmur. Pressing forward from Central Asia, he soon swept aside the contending parties or merely allowed them to fade into insignificance. It is typical of Persia that in spite of the troubles of the decades between the end of the Il-Khanid empire and the appearance on the scene of TTmur, Persian culture was not submerged, as one might have expected, but achieved, in its intellectual life, for example in the sphere of poetry, a distinction hardly equalled in any other period. The flowering of poetry which reached its highest point in the unique figure of



JALAYIRIDS, MUZAFFARIDS AND SARBADARS
Hafiz of Shlraz is a striking phenomenon in the cultural history of 8th/14th century Persia. In marked contrast, public life and political affairs were throughout most of this period in a sorry state. Political confusion, the tyranny of petty princes, bloody conflicts between local powers, and devastating invasions were a constant menace, not only to the general well-being but to people's very existence, even when they managed to save their skins in the apocalyptic horrors which now descended on their homeland, depopulating many towns and laying waste entire areas. The collapse of the Mongol empire of Iran, struggles for the Mongol inheritance and the horrors of another conquest and occupation of the country at the hands of Tlmur made up the fate of the luckless inhabitants of Iran in this century; a fate which was all the more keenly felt as the memory of the halcyon days under the last of the Tl-Khans was no doubt still widely treasured. Strangely enough, the very time at which - with the death of the Tl-Khan Abu Sa'Id and the passing of Hvilegii's dynasty - the end of their empire became imminent, was the year in which Tlmur was born, the man who a few decades later incorporated Persia into an empire destined eventually to extend from the Jaxartes to Asia Minor. Though he himself was actually of Turkish origin, throughout his life, and even when he had become the most powerful man on earth, he set the greatest store by his Mongol family connections — a plain indication of the high regard in which Chingiz Khan and his descendants were held even long after the fall of the Il-Khanid empire. Of course, the extinction of the line of Hiilegu need not necessarily have implied the end of the Persian Mongol empire, and there is no doubt that many people in Persia at this time were convinced that Mongol rule would survive, for there was plainly no lack of influential Mongol leaders and politicians, nor of princes belonging to the most diverse lines of descent from Chingiz Khan who could theoretically have provided for the continuation of the empire. Abu Sa'id's successor Arpa Ke'iin, for instance, belonged to the family of Tolui. He was a competent prince, who might have been able to secure Mongol control of Persia had he not met his end a few months after his accession as a result of a conflict with a general who was seeking to put another Chingizid in power. But he was the last of the princes who emerged, or were thrust forward in these struggles for power, to show any competence, at least in terms of their success in re-establishing a united Iranian empire. Not one of them was able to assert control, nor could



THE LAST CHINGIZIDS
any of their military or nomadic backers. The disappearance of centralised authority not only opened the way for Mongol princes and influential military leaders or tribal chieftains to engage in political adventures; it was also the signal to local rulers who had hitherto been submissive to Mongol power to make a bid for independence. The Chingizids' control of Iran was at an end by half way through the 8th/14th century. This is true whether one chooses to take as critical the year 740/1340, in which Hasan-i Buzurg, the founder of the house of the Jalayirids, took power personally in Baghdad in place of his figurehead Jahan Temiir, a descendant of the Il-Khan Gaikhatu (690—4/1291 —5), or whether one prefers the year 754/135 3, in which an equally insignificant Chobanid caused the last coins to be minted bearing the name of the puppet khan Anushlrvan and, in addition, the last Chingizid, Togha Temiir, was murdered by a Sarbadar. From then on until Timur's invasion of the country, Iran was under the rule of various rival petty princes of whom henceforth only the Jalayirids could claim Mongol, though not Chingizid, descent. They ruled from Baghdad and were later significantly involved in the history of the country with the conquest of Azarbaljan. In the east, especially in the Khurasanian city of Sabzavar, the Sarbadars increased in power, while in Fars and Isfahan members of the house of Tnjii sought to assert themselves over the Muzaffarids. In the south-east, princes of the Kart (or Kurt) dynasty at Herat were active on the political scene, just as they had been under the Tl-Khans. Later, Turkmen confederations appeared, thrusting forward from eastern Anatolia towards the Iranian highlands. These were the Qara Quyunlu and the Aq Quyunlu, of whom the former were already beginning to influence the fortunes of Persia in the 8th/14th century. It is necessary to discuss the political scene at this time, grim and unedifying though it is, because it forms the background to a significant epoch in Iranian intellectual life; and also because it shows up in clear colours the negative reasons for Timur's successes on Iranian soil. Before tracing the main lines of this development, which extended over some fifty years, it will be as well to try to clarify the situation of the time by means of a table setting out the most important political forces which began to operate after the fall of the Il-Khanid empire. Although the plan which follows is not exhaustive, it does demonstrate the fragmentation of the country. It is evident from the dates given, which in many cases can only be tentative, that various of these



JALAYIRIDS, MUZAFFARIDS AND SARBADARS
regimes survived the conquest by Tlmur or in some cases even the entire Timurid era: The Chobanids in 'Iraq-i 'Ajam, Azarbaljan and Armenia, until
744/1343;
The Jalayirids in 'Iraq-i 'Arab and later also in the territory of the Chobanids, until 835/1432; The Qara Quyunlu in Azarbaljan, and later with further extensions of influence to Firs and Khurasan, till 873/1468-9; The "Tl-Khan" Togha Temiir in western Khurasan and Gurgan, until 754/1353; The Sarbadars in western Khurasan, until 783/1381; The Sayyids of Mazandaran, until 794/1392, and Gllan down to
The Karkiya in Lahijan, until 1060/1650; The Kartids (Kurtids) of Herat in eastern Khurasan and Afghanistan, with influence extending into Slstan and Kirman, until 791/1389; The Injuids in Fars and Isfahan, until 758/1357; The Muzaffarids in Kirman and Yazd, and later also in the former territory of the Injuids, until 795/1393; The maliks of Shabankara in the area lying between Fars and Kirman on the Persian Gulf, until 756/1355; The governors (hukkam) of Lar, until 983/1575; The maliks of Hurmuz, until 1031/1622; The atabegs of Greater Luristan (Lur-i Buzurg), until 828/1425; The atabegs of Lesser Luristan (Lur-i Kuchak), until 1006/1597. A number of these princely houses and their representatives such as Togha Temiir, the Chobanids, and particularly the conflict of the "two Hasans", i.e. the Chobanid Shaikh Hasan-i Kuchak and Shaikh Hasan-i
Buzurg of the Jalayir tribe, have been treated elsewhere,1 and the Qara Quyunlu will be dealt with later; others are of such minor significance in the history of Iran, in this period at least, that no more than a brief reference can be made to them here. We shall therefore summarise the most important events in three brief sections on the Jalayirids, on the Tnjii family and the Muzaffarids, and on the Sarbadars and their rivals.

THE JALAYIRIDS
THE JALAYIRIDS
The name Jalayir is derived from that of a large and important Mongol
tribe.1 The dynasty of the same name, whose rule began in 740/1340 with Shaikh Hasan-i Buzurg's seizure of power in Baghdad and ended with the death of Husain II at the siege of al-Hilla, is also quite often referred to as the Ilka dynasty or the Ilkanids. The name originates with Shaikh Hasan's great-grandfather Ilge (<Tlka) Noyan, who as one of Hiilegii's generals took a significant part in the Mongol conquest of Central Asia and the Near East. His sons likewise attained to high rank in the military aristocracy of the Il-Khanid empire, and several of them were able to take princesses of the house of Hiilegii in marriage* Thus Ilge's grandson Husain (d.722/1322) married a daughter of the Tl-Khan Arghun named Oljetei, who became the mother of Shaikh Hasan, the founder of the dynasty. Shaikh Hasan-i Buzurg, who under Abu Sa'Id and again under Arpa Ke'iin had attained to the highest offices as ulus beg and deputy, proved to be the strongest personality in the massive struggles for power which took place at the end of Mongol rule in Iran, though he was frequently hard pressed in the conflicts with the Chobanids, and especially with Shaikh Hasan-i Kiichak and, after the latter's murder in 744/1343, with his brother Malik Ashraf. If we are to credit a recent interpretation, he was more interested in seeing restoration of the Il-Khanid empire than
its overthrow, which of course he did in fact bring about.2 He is said never to have assumed any title other than ulus beg ("amir of the state", from Tu. beg, "amir", and Mo. ulus, "state, people") and to have recognised the legitimate Chingizids - Togha Temiir (739/1338-9, 741-4/ 1340—4), Jahan Temiir (740/1339—40) and Sulaiman (747/1346) — and subsequently, in the period 747-57/ 1346-56, to have left the throne unoccupied. The remarkable thing is that this prince was able to maintain his position in these troubled times right up to his death in 7 5 7/13 5 6. "No one in his position has lived to such an age nowadays", commented
1 In "Ilat", EP, Professor Lambton discusses a manuscript said to be taken from the state papers of the Safavid Sultan Husain, in which the distribution of tribes at the beginning of the 12th/18th century is surveyed and a distinction drawn between Persian and non-Persian tribes: here the Jalayir in Khurasan are listed in the former category. 2 The view of Smith, "Djalayir, Djalayirids", EP. According to Spuler, Die Mongolen in Iran, p. 133, and Boyle, CHI v, 41;, however, Shaikh Hasan began his autonomous rule in Baghdad with the deposition of Jahan Temiir. On this question Shaikh Hasan's coinage appears relevant: cf. Spuler, p. 303, n.7.

in amazement Ibn Bazzaz; and he finds a supernatural explanation for the fact — namely the good relationship which (in contrast to the Chobanids) Hasan-i Buzurg had established with the saintly Shaikh SafI
al-Din of Ardabll, who had died twenty-two years previously.1 He was succeeded by Shaikh Uvais, a son of Hasan and the Chobanid princess Dil-Shad Khatun. In the same year — as had happened once before, at the death of Abu Sa'Id — an attack was launched by the Golden Horde against Persia, namely in Khurasan and Azarbaljan. However, the khan Janl Beg (Jambek) Jalal al-Din Mahmud, who had defeated and executed Malik Ashraf, the ruler in Azarbaijan, was forced to withdraw as a result of developments in the northern part of his realm. When he died in the following year, his son BerdI Beg, whom he had left as governor in Persia, also returned to Saral. This amounted to the abandonment of the Persian conquests, even if we regard Akhlchuq, one of Ashraf's amirs, who placed himself at the disposal of the conquerors after the defeat, and following their withdrawal twice took possession of Tabriz, as belonging to the Golden Horde; for he, too, was unable to maintain his position for any length of time. In 761/1360 Uvais, who had at first recognised the overlordship of the Golden Horde, conquered Azarbaijan, which his father had lost to Shaikh Hasan-i Kuchak twenty years earlier. Thus another attempt to restore Mongol rule in Iran, this time from the direction of the Golden Horde, had also failed. Shaikh Uvais' success had not been achieved at the first attempt, however. It was preceded by an abortive attack on his part and a campaign led by Mubariz al-Din Muhammad b. al-Muzaffar of Yazd, which had thoroughly weakened Akhlchuq's fighting power. In the years that followed, Shaikh Uvais intervened in the power struggles of the Muzaffarids. To Shah Mahmud, who acknowledged his sovereignty and married one of his daughters, he handed over Isfahan and recognised his conquest of Shlraz. These great successes were offset by many difficulties and setbacks with which Shaikh Uvais had to contend. Thus in the winter of 766/1364, during a campaign against the Shlrvan-Shah Kai-Ka'us b. Kai-Qubad, news reached him of the revolt of his governor in Baghdad, Khwaja Mirjan, and he was obliged to return and restore order in his own capital city. Among his worst enemies were the Qara Quyunlu
1 Cf. Glassen, Die friiben Safawidtn, p. 43. Good relations with the Ardabll order continued into later times, as may be seen from an edict of the Jalayirid Ahmad of 1372: see Masse, "Ordonnance".



THE JALAYIRIDS
in Diyarbakr, the same Turkmen federation which later, at the beginning of the 9th/15 th century, was to put an end to his dynasty. In the spring of 767/1366 he marched against them and defeated Bairam Khwaja, their leader, at the battle of Mush. Eventually he also brought to heel the Shlrvan-Shah, who had twice exploited his absence from Azarbaijan to launch attacks on Tabriz. In Ray he defeated Amir Vail, who ruled in Astarabad after the death of Togha Temur, but was forced to break off the campaign when news was brought of the death of his brother Amir Zahid in Ojan, which made necessary his return to Azarbaljan. He placed the governorship of Ray in the hands of Qutlugh Shah, one of his amirs, who was followed in the post two years later by 'Adil Aqa. Although Shaikh Uvais retained Baghdad as his capital, his military enterprises and political considerations repeatedly took him to Persia, and he died finally in Tabriz (776/1374). It is not only his military and political achievements that mark him out as unquestionably the most eminent prince of his line; it is particularly his human qualities and the impetus he gave to cultural life. The latter embraced both efforts to revive commercial enterprise in the devastated regions of Iran and his own personal contribution to civilised living, his patronage of and interest in art and literature - to which no doubt we are also indirectly indebted for many of the detailed facts concerning his life and activities found in a chronicle whose author was apparently his official court chronicler, the Tdrtkh-i Shaikh Uvais of Abu Bakr al-Qutbl al-Ahrl. But in addition he wrote verses himself and won renown as a calligrapher and painter. Shaikh Uvais's efforts towards an extension of Jalayirid power to central and eastern Persia, which was clearly to have been initiated by the campaign against Ray, met with no success. Nor were the rulers who followed him any more successful in this direction. Indeed, the decline of Jalayirid power set in immediately and relentlessly after his death. His eldest son, Hasan, failed on account of his general unpopularity and was executed by the top-ranking amirs. The succession passed to his brother Husain (776—83/1374—82).' He experienced immediate difficulties with the Muzaffarids, first with his brother-in-law Shah Mahmud, who marched from Isfahan to occupy Tabriz, though he was obliged to

withdraw from the town as a result of illness and died shortly afterwards. His successor Shah-i Shuja' also made all haste to occupy Tabriz if he could, but again the attempt failed. Disturbances in the city, the inclemencies of a hard winter, and an uprising in Qazvin forced him to return to Isfahan. Not until the summer of 778/1376 was Husain again able to take up residence in Tabriz, only to be compelled in the following spring to march again, against Bairam Khwaja and his Tiirkmens, who were thrusting eastwards once more, this time from the direction of Erzerum. These operations were successful, but Husain soon found himself caught up in problems of an internal nature, in which his brothers Shaikh 'All, Ahmad and Bayazld were involved. The situation was further aggravated by his support of 'Adil Aqa, whose exceptional rise to power provoked the hostility of other influential amirs. Incessant troubles at home, uprisings by local potentates and battles with the Muzaffarids consumed Husain's resources. To all this was added the breach with 'Adil, who had meanwhile risen to a position of unchallengeable power. So he found himself by Safar 784/the end of April 1382 defenceless against an attack by his brother Sultan Ahmad when he advanced with an armed force from his territory around Ardabll and occupied Tabriz. Ahmad, who took over the succession, had his brother executed. Amir 'Adil countered by proclaiming Prince Bayazld, who had managed by the skin of his teeth to escape from Tabriz, as sultan in Sultaniyya. Ahmad, now subjected to attack from several directions, could find no other expedient in the circumstances than to seek help from the arch-enemies of his family, the Qara Quyunlu under Qara Muhammad. His brother, Shaikh 'All, who had advanced from Baghdad to attack Tabriz, was killed in the fighting against them. A treaty providing for the cession of Azarbaljan to Sultan Ahmad, 'Iraq-i 'Ajam to his brother Bayazld, and 'Iraq-i 'Arab jointly to Ahmad and 'Adil, proved to be shortlived, so that it was in a state of utter disunity and discord that the Jalayirids were hurled into the great conflicts of TImur, on the one hand with the Golden Horde under Tokhtamish and on the other with the Ottomans under Bayezld I Yildiri'm. This will be dealt with in the next chapter. The contributions to cultural life made by various princes of the Jalayirid dynasty provide a welcome contrast to the disastrous role played in Iranian politics by this princely house (especially its later

members), with their endless disputes and feuds. Miniature painting is the most significant area. Their artistic activities were centred on Tabriz and especially Baghdad, where impressive examples of their architecture have been preserved. In the period we are dealing with the Jalayirids were largely Turkicised, or at least Turkish-speaking; and they have been credited with establishing the Turkish element in Arabic Iraq on a firmer foundation so that Turkish became the lan
guage most commonly spoken after Arabic.1 But this did not prevent them from acquiring a reputation as patrons of Persian poets: as a prime witness to this fact we may quote no less a name than Salman Savajl. In the religious sphere the Jalayirids display unmistakably Shfl features, as in their preference for such names as 'All, Hasan and Husain. A still clearer indication is to be seen in the dying wish of the founder of the dynasty, Shaikh Hasan-i Buzurg, to be buried in Najaf, where according to tradition 'All b. Abl Talib had found his last resting
place. Nevertheless, as Mazzaoui points out,2 the conversion of ruling princes to Shi'ism at this time did not necessarily assume a spectacular form or result in the conversion of their subjects. Whether this circumstance helps to explain the virtual absence of references to the Shf a on Jalayirid coins must remain an open question. Rabino has found no evidence demonstrating even Shl'I sympathies among the coins — over 150 of them — minted by the Jalayirids which he has examined. In a group of 3 5 other coins preserved in the Muza-yi Azarbaljan, Tabriz, only one bears the names of the Twelve Imams rather than those of the Orthodox caliphs, namely a coin of Hasan-i Buzurg minted at Amul
in 742/1341-2.3 A recent find at 'Aqarquf, 20 km west of Baghdad, contained 227 Jalayirid silver coins, of which 50 belong to Shaikh Uvais and the remainder to Sultan Ahmad. Shl'I characteristics were totally lacking, and the coins of Uvais bore the names of the Orthodox
caliphs.4

THE INJU FAMILY AND THE MUZAFFARIDS
The Jalayirids had been unable to bring any lasting pressure to bear on 'Iraq-i 'Ajam and Fars. On the contrary, the advances made by the Muzaffarids from these areas against their sphere of control, including even the repeated occupation of Tabriz, can be regarded as a pointer to the debilitated condition to which they were so often reduced. The Muzaffarids originated in an Arab family in Khurasan which had been settled there since the Islamic conquest but which, on the advance of the Mongols, had withdrawn to Yazd where they had entered the service of the local atabeg, 'Ala' al-Daula. Various members of the family had then seen service under Hiilegii, while others had remained in Maibud, a town not far from Yazd. Here the eponym of the family, Sharaf al-Din Muzaffar, was finally appointed governor. He served under several Tl-Khans, the last of whom was Oljeitii, as commander of the gendarmerie, with the task of exterminating the robber bands that were springing up in many parts of the country. His son Mubariz al-Din Muhammad, who was only thirteen years old when his father died, lived at first at the Tl-Khan's court but then returned to Maibud after the death of Oljeitii. From here he succeeded after a few years in bringing down the atabeg of Yazd and himself taking possession of the city. Soon after this he was obliged to engage in a whole series of battles with the Negiideris, a Mongol tribal group which was seeking at that time to intervene in the fortunes of Persia
from the south-east.1 For the coup in Yazd, Mubariz al-Din had a helper in Amir Ghiyas al-Din Kai-Khusrau of the house of Tnju. This family, whose destiny is closely linked with that of the Muzaffarids, exercised control in Fars and in various centres of'Iraq-i 'Ajam from 703/1304, the beginning of the reign of the Tl-Khan Oljeitii, until their fall from power in 758/1357. They owed the name Tnju to the circumstance that their ancestor Sharaf al-Din Mahmud Shah, the father of the Kai-Khusrau already mentioned, was responsible for administering the royal domains (Mongol: in/it). Sharaf al-Din was reputedly descended from the well-known mystic of Herat, 'Abd-Allah Ansarl (d. 481/1089). The well-nigh absolute control he had managed to establish by 725/1325 in Fars aroused the suspicion of Abu Sa'Id, who therefore summoned him

to his court and appointed another governor to replace him in Fars. However, the latter was unable to take up his office because Amir Ghiyas al-Dln, who ruled in his father's name in Shiraz, refused to hand over the management of affairs to him, and some time later, on the news of the death of the Tl-Khan, took him prisoner and sent him to Azarbaljan. Even during Abu Sa'Id's lifetime Sharaf al-Dln had been imprisoned in Tabriz after an abortive attempt on the life of his successor. When Arpa Ke'iin had him executed, his sons, who were present in the royal encampment [prdd), took flight, Amir Jalal al-Dln Mas'ud Shah finding refuge with Shaikh Hasan-i Buzurg in Rum, and Shaikh Abu Ishaq with Amir 'AH Padishah in Diyarbakr. Arpa Ke'iin later fell into the power of his rival Musa Khan and was handed over to Mas'ud Shah, who exacted a bloody revenge for his father's death. The same Mas'ud Shah forthwith advanced to the position of vizier to Muhammad Khan, who succeeded Musa Khan as ruler in 736/1336, and after the murder of his master fled to Shiraz, where Kai-Khusrau had meanwhile set himself up as his father's successor. In the struggle for power between the two brothers which promptly began, Mas'ud Shah emerged as the stronger but was unable to rid himself of the dispute with Kai-Khusrau until the latter went the way of all flesh a few years later (739/1338-9). But Mas'ud Shah was destined to have little joy of his reign. The very next year his brother Shams al-Dln Muhammad, whom he had been holding prisoner in the fortress of Qal'a-yi Safld, escaped and threw in his lot with the Chobanid Plr Husain. The two men marched at the head of Mongol troops to Shiraz and conquered the city; and Mas'ud Shah fled from there to Luristan. By his murder of Shams al-Dln Muhammad, Plr Husain forfeited all hope of support from the population, so that he again had to withdraw from Shiraz. His attempt to gain possession of the city the following year also came to nothing. In his disputes with other Chobanids he finally sought refuge with Hasan-i Kuchak. The latter, however, had him executed; and shortly after this was himself murdered (27 Rajab 744/15 December 1343). The two surviving sons of Sharaf al-Dln Mahmud Shah also tried to make their way with the aid of the Chobanids; and likewise it proved their undoing. Mas'ud Shah struck up an alliance in Luristan with Yaghi Basti and marched with him to Shiraz. He met the same fate as his brother and in the same year — murdered by his ally. Abu Ishaq, the last of the Injuids, who had tried to appropriate Yazd to himself when

the rule of the Tl-Khans came to an end, had been entrusted by the above-mentioned Plr Husain with Isfahan; he had also successfully asserted his claim on Shlraz at the collapse of the Chobanids, which followed immediately on the death of Hasan-i Kuchak. His efforts to extend his power into Kirman, beginning in 748/1347, brought him into conflict with the Muzaffarid Mubariz al-Dln Muhammad, a conflict which he only succeeded in intensifying by a campaign against Yazd (751/1350—1). Two years later his troops were defeated in open battle and the Muzaffarid besieged him in Shlraz. He was compelled to capitulate, but managed to make good his escape and — with the aid of the Jalayirid Hasan-i Buzurg — to establish himself again in Isfahan, only to be besieged there in turn by Mubariz al-Dln. He had to capitulate once more, was taken prisoner and executed (758/1357). With this triumph on the part of Mubariz al-Dln the fate of the Injuids was sealed, and it might well be thought that their passing would have gone quite unlamented. But it was not so. 'Ubaid-i Zakani, one of the most famous poets of the time, deplored the death of Shaikh Abu Ishaq in an elegy, and no less a figure than Hafiz praised the happy days in Shlraz under the reign of the last of the Injuids. The latter had been a generous patron of poetry — he was indeed not alone in this among the members of his house — and on this score secured his recognition in world literature in spite of the warmongering intrigues into which he had all too often recklessly blundered. With the victory of Mubariz al-Dln, which also found its way into the history of literature (if only in the negative sense that the victor is recalled as an implacable fanatic who made life hard for literary men), the happy days of Shlraz and its buoyant poets seemed to have come to an end, and both social and public life were placed under the watchful eye of the supervisor of markets and public morals {muhtasib). That this situation did not, however, erect insuperable obstacles for the poetic muse, but even added a certain stimulus to its life — by obliging poets to be discreet and operate with metaphors and ironic allusions — can be read between the lines in a number of passages in Hafiz's Divdn.^ The capture of Shlraz and Isfahan gave Mubariz al-Dln, the first of the Muzaffarid princes, a dominant position in Iranian politics. The little country town of Maibud had served them as a springboard to Yazd; they had then pressed on to Kirman, and now - with Fars and

JALAYIRIDS, MUZAFFARIDS AND SARBADARS
'Iraq-i 'Ajam taken - they possessed two of the most important provinces of the country. Mubariz al-Dln Muhammad made Shiraz his capital. The fame of his military exploits caused the khan-of the Golden Horde, JanI Beg, who was in Tabriz at the time, to invite him to enter his service. He was in a position to be able to decline the invitation, and when the khan, and shortly afterwards also his son and successor BerdI Beg, had withdrawn from Tabriz, he promptly marched his forces to Azarbaljan, defeated Akhlchuq, the khan's governor, at Miyana, and occupied Tabriz. But his triumph was shortlived, for when Jalayirid troops moved up from Baghdad he found himself unable to hold on to his conquests and retreated from Tabriz. This meant the failure of an undertaking which could be regarded as an attempt to solve the major problem of Persia in the half-century between the fall of the Il-Khanid empire and the emergence of Tlmur, namely the establishment of centralised control. Mubariz al-Dln Muhammad's bleak tyranny did not endure long after the removal of the house of Tnju from the scene. His intolerance, combined with severity and treachery, inspired fear and hostility in his
own sons. One of them, Abu'l-Favaris Shah-i Shuja'1, took him prisoner, had his eyes put out, and incarcerated him in Qal'a-yi Safld. He contrived to improve his lot quite soon afterwards, but never again managed up to his death (765/1364) to secure a dominant influence in government, not even by means of a plot hatched by his supporters against his son. The period of his rule in Shiraz stands out in stark contrast to the cultivated standards of the city with which we are familiar from contemporary literary evidence. Under the new ruler, Shah-i Shuja', the liberal spirit of freedom and tolerance that had been enjoyed before was once again in vogue, and was jubilantly greeted by Hafiz. Though his long reign (759-86/1358-84) reintroduced an atmosphere of liberty and meant the end of narrow bigotry, yet it was anything but a period of undisturbed peace. The constant squabbles of the prince with his brothers and his attempts to extend his power produced even worse conditions than under the Jalayirids and the Injuids - namely, almost unremitting warlike entanglements with alternations of success and failure. As early as 765/1363 Shah-i Shuja' marched against his brother Shah Mahmud, who ruled in Isfahan. Although a reconciliation was initially effected, he met

with a reverse somewhat later when Mahmud, with the support of his father-in-law, the Jalayirid Shaikh Uvais, who ruled in Baghdad, invaded the province of Fars, besieging and finally conquering Shiraz. It was three years before he could again take possession of his capital city. The idea of uniting the north-western areas of Persia with the Muzaffarid territories had not died with Mubariz al-Din Muhammad and his abandonment of Tabriz; in fact, various further attempts were made to achieve it. The first impetus was given by the complex situation involved in the succession to the throne of Tabriz (described above) after Shaikh Uvais had died there in 776/1374. At that time Shah Mahmud had challenged his brother-in-law Husain's claim to his father's inheritance, but was forced by a sudden severe illness to yield up Tabriz, which he had by then occupied — just as his father had done before him. Not long after this he died (776/1375), and Isfahan passed into the hands of Shah-i Shuja', who now himself sought to annex Azarbaljan. In spite of a victorious advance on Tabriz, he too was denied success, fundamentally because conditions in Fars were not sufficiently stable for him to risk being absent for any length of time. This fact was quickly made plain when his nephew Shah Yahya, now installed in Isfahan, rose in revolt. He therefore acceded to a compromise arrangement with Husain, hoping to secure his position by marrying his son Zain al-'AbidIn to a sister of the Jalayirid ruler. This proved to be an illusory hope, for the Jalayirids, particularly Amir 'Adil, promptly prepared to strike back. They got no further than Sultaniyya, however, where Shah-i Shuja' managed to halt them. He now contrived to draw over to his side the Jalayirid Bayazld, who had been proclaimed sultan there by Amir 'Adil, by making him his deputy; but even this move failed to save the town from falling into the hands of Sultan Ahmad. Shortly before his death in 786/1384 Shah-i Shuja' appointed his son Zain al-'AbidIn as his successor and his brother 'Imad al-Din Ahmad as governor of Kirman. This arrangement was far from satisfying Shah Yahya, who advanced against Shiraz. However, a peaceful settlement of the conflict was reached. Shah Yahya was unable to hold onto Isfahan for long, but was driven out by the populace, which even at that period
was prone to riots and disturbances,1 and found refuge in Yazd; whereupon Isfahan was placed under the supervision of Muzaffar-i KashI, an uncle of Zain al-'Abidln.

The final end of the Muzaffarids proved to be as bloody as the period of their rule. They fell at the hands of TTmur, who invaded Persia just when Shah-i Shuja"s days were approaching their end. He was already on his deathbed when he wrote a letter to the conqueror in the autumn of 786/1384 - in which he commended his sons to the benevolence of TTmur on the strength of their good relationship. The discovery of Timur's real attitude towards the members of his house was an experience he was spared. However bleak the record of political and social conditions under the Injuids and the Muzaffarids, the cultural achievements of the period were impressive. Many representatives of the two houses had a share in these, either as generous patrons or — like Shah-i Shuja' with his poetry — as active participants. We have already indicated that this is one of the most brilliantly productive periods in Persian literature. But it is also important to mention the great contribution made by the two dynasties to the art of book illumination. Another area of significant achievement was that of architecture, which contributed not only to shaping the style of the metropolis, Shlraz, but gave many towns their distinctive cast, as for instance Yazd, Kirman and Isfahan. As for the religious sphere, in contrast with the Jalayirids the SunnI allegiance of the two princely houses cannot seriously be doubted. Nur-AUah Shushtari does list the Injuids among the dynasties he
regards as Shl'I,1 but the evidence he adduces is vague and unconvincing. If Shah-i Shuja' is sometimes aligned with the Shl'a it is on account, it would seem, of his close relationship with Hafiz, whom many writers describe as Shl'I. However, it is no longer possible to sustain the view of that prince of poets as belonging within this reli
gious category.2 On the contrary, Shah-i Shuja"s SunnI religious persuasions are demonstrated conclusively by his recognition, in 770/1368, of the 'Abbasid shadow caliph of Cairo, al-Mutawakkil I.

the north and the desert in the south to a narrow strip of settlements, played a special part in events at the end of the Persian Mongol empire. Here too, a pretender to the throne was to be found in the person of
Togha Temur,1 who could trace his ancestry back over six generations to Jochi Qasar, a brother of Chingiz Khan, and had contrived to attract support from the powerful figures in the province. The situation of Khurasan, more or less isolated as it was from the rest of Persia, provided what was effectively a favourable precondition for his plan of restoring the Il-Khanid empire. Nevertheless, the several attempts he
made to achieve his object were doomed to failure.2 This was due partly to various developments in eastern Persia of greater interest to the historian than the campaigns undertaken by Togha Temiir or even certain successes he achieved at home in temporarily stabilising conditions in limited areas. Of these developments it is especially those concerned with the Sarbadar state that are of interest. Its beginnings and further growth are among the strangest in the Islamic world, the history of which is certainly not lacking in odd political structures. Whereas the founders of the principalities we have been discussing in other parts of Iran based their claims to authority on their relationship to individual Mongol rulers, or on an office conferred by them or by one of the shadow khans, the Sarbadars of Sabzavar were usurpers, principally belonging to the Shl'I creed, who certainly entertained no such legitimist notions. Certain social characteristics of the Sarbadar movement — if we accept this description as a meaningful r>ne - have attracted the attention of socialist historians and have led them to indulge speculative views that are far from being adequately borne out on all points by the evidence available. The community they created differed from other systems in that it was not dynastic but a realm without kings. But it also displayed other unusual features, the most striking of which were its religious aspect and, associated with this, the part played by dervishes of an extreme form of Shi'ism. Various interpretations have been offered for the name by which the Sarbadars have gone down in history, none of which can be seen to be totally appropriate. It may be derived from an utterance of 'Abd

al-Razzaq, one of its best known representatives, intended to express the idea that the political success aimed at was worth the risk of hanging
(sar ba-dar,"he&d on gallows").1 And not only has it been the name that has produced varying interpretations; right up to the present day the same is true of evaluations of the Sarbadars' historical importance. Whereas many commentators continue to dismiss them as a robber state, another interpretation would see them in terms of a socially orientated reform movement having the character of a class struggle, in which the unmistakable faith in a Mahdl, i.e. a kind of messianic belief, and a striving for a theocratic order, were no more than passing features of minor import
ance.2 Both interpretations - robber state and the socio-critical view have met with sharp opposition from John Masson Smith. Togha Temiir and the Sarbadars, however, were not the only rivals for power in Khurasan. Another contender was the Kart dynasty
in Herat.3 They were descended from an eminent dignitary of the Ghurids named Shams al-Din, who had succeeded in establishing his authority out of the wreckage of his masters' realm when the territory was recovering from the marauding expeditions of the Mongols around the middle of the 7th/13 th century. He himself and his descendants ruled, as Mongol vassals, from Herat over Balkh and Slstan and in the east as far as the Indus. Notwithstanding their Indian connections, they were from the outset also orientated towards the west, and not only kept a careful eye on the struggles for power going on in Khurasan and other parts of Persia at the end of the period of Mongol rule, but also pursued their own interests by military and political means. For instance, they supported the opponents of the Muzaffarid Mubariz al-Din in Kirman, and were involved in the conflict between the Tl-Khan Abu Sa'Id and his generalissimo Amir Choban. Their efforts did not always meet with success, in fact: in spite of their military intervention, Kirman did pass into the hands of Mubariz al-Din, and in 727/1327, on the insistence of Abu Sa'id, Amir Choban had to be executed in Herat, where he had taken refuge - an action which resulted in a severe loss of prestige for the Kart prince. When he and two of his successors died within a brief interval, many of their

subjects saw this as a punishment from God for the treachery committed against Amir Choban as one seeking asylum. These shortlived rulers were followed in 732/1331—2 by Mu'izz al-Dln Husain, who was later to intervene actively in the power struggles in Khurasan. The situation in Khurasan at the start of the succession conflicts following the death of Abu Sa'Id is thus none too easy to trace out. It appears still more confused if we bear in mind certain ethnic factors of political importance. These are ethnic strands which had arisen in eastern Khurasan and on the frontiers with India since the Mongol invasion as a result of a racial mixing due partly to military dispositions and affecting various elements, particularly Mongol and Turkish ones; and partly to environmental associations, for example with the Indian population. Several of them were to be found under the name Qara'unas in the area of their origin, and also in other regions of Central Asia and the Middle East, as well as in Egypt. Research on the complex relationships between these ethnic groups has recently progressed as a result of Aubin's work, though many questions remain unanswered at the present stage. We have already come across the Negiideris, who belong in this context. We have now to deal with the Ja'un-i Qurban. By an unjustified analogy with the known family connections of their leaders, they are often referred to as Oirats, but in fact they arose from what was known as a "little thousand" {hat^aracba) which, under the command of Amir Arghun Aqa (d. 673/1275), had been formed out of the Mongol army by the detachment of three (Je'iiri) soldiers in every hundred {qurban), that is to say, irrespective of tribal membership. In 736/1335 a grandson of this military leader, named Amir Arghun Shah, was in command of this unit, which at the time was deployed over the area of Nlshapur, Mashhad and Ablvard, and also north-west of these cities as far as the upper course of the Atrak. It is to the historian and geographer Hamd-Allah MustaufI (d. some time after 740/1339—40), who hailed not from Khurasan but from Qazvln, that we are indebted for certain details important to our
understanding of the developments we must now consider.1 According to his account, the large number of viziers and officials in the Mongol financial administration who came originally from Khurasan had contrived so to arrange things that their home province, together with Quhistan, Qumis, Mazandaran, and Tabaristan, had been

grouped together as a special tax area; and its governors were permitted to hold in reserve a considerable sum from the tax yield, under the pretext that it was required for the payment of troops. Some years before the death of Abu Sa'Id, it seems, his vizier Ghiyas al-Dln Muhammad b. Rashld al-Dln had taken steps to abolish this abuse, calling upon the support of Shaikh Hasan-i Buzurg, the recently appointed amir of the ulus, Shaikh 'All Qushjl, and 'Ala' al-Dln Muhammad FaryumadI, who had been ordered to Khurasan for this very purpose. It is evident that those who chiefly suffered from this measure were Togha Temiir, Amir Arghun Shah and 'Abd-Allah b. Mulai, the master of Quhistan. We may end this introduction to the major political figures by some reference to Shaikh 'All b. 'AH Qushjl who has just been mentioned. He had been ruling as the Tl-Khan's governor in Khurasan since 729/1328-9. After the death of his master he proposed as his successor the Chingizid Togha Temiir, and having gained the support of the amirs of Khurasan, caused the prince's name to be adopted on the coinage (sikka) and in the official prayers (khutbd). He thus secured an influential position with the new khan, who in any case was not a strong personality. Allowing also for the fact that about this time (737/1337) the pretenders Arpa Ke'iin and Musa Khan had already failed in their claims, there was no question of Togha Temiir being recognised without friction in other parts of the realm, where of course control was generally in the hands of fairly strong princes. A campaign to the west, his first military undertaking, was aimed at restoring the Il-Khanid empire under his own sceptre. But even during the march rivalries broke out between the amirs, in which Arghun Shah and 'Abd-Allah b. Mulai, alarmed at the growing power of 'All Qushjl, deserted and set off back with their troops. Their defection was indeed counterbalanced by the addition of large numbers of Mongol troops whom Hasan-i Buzurg had defeated, including their leader Musa Khan, to whom reference has just been made. Nevertheless, the campaign ended in catastrophe; for the Jalayirid prince inflicted a crushing defeat on this army as well in a battle at Sultaniyya - an encounter whose outcome Togha Temiir did not even wait to witness in person. Now Amir Arghun Shah's hour had come. He captured his rival, Shaikh 'All Qushjl, who was already in flight, in Bistam, had him executed, and sent his head to Hasan-i Buzurg, with whom, it will be recalled, the victim had cooperated in abolishing the privileges of the Khurasanls. Then he again joined up with Togha Temiir and became

his military commander {amir al-umard'). A governor whom Hasan-i Buzurg had appointed for Khurasan, a man named Muhammad-i Mulai, was defeated and executed. It looks very much as though the Jalayirid, in thus attempting to gain control of eastern Persia, had turned against Arghun Shah, but not against Togha Temiir. This is supported by his loyal attitude to the Chingizids, referred to above, and by subsequent developments. Even at this time he may have reckoned on the khan's readiness to make concessions, realising that the latter's only concern was the restoration of the Persian Mongol empire under his rule. And in fact this assessment proved well grounded in the case of an offer of alliance which he made to Togha Temiir in the summer of 738/1338, after his defeat in battle against the Chobanid Hasan-i Kuchak. The khan accepted the offer and once more led his troops west; again ineffectually, however, for Hasan-i Kuchak had sown doubts about him in the mind of his ally by sending him a letter written in the khan's own hand. This contained the statement that he, the khan, was prepared to take up an offer of alliance made by Hasan-i Kuchak, to marry Amir Choban's widow SatI Beg, the sister - of Abu Sa'Id, and thus to revive the Il-Khanid empire with Chobanid assistance. Shocked by such blatant disloyalty, Hasan-i Buzurg agreed to the alliance proposed by his old adversary, and in view of the opposition now ranged against him Togha Temiir was left with no other choice but to withdraw to Khurasan. The harmony between the Jalayirids and the Chobanids did not, in fact, endure for any length of time, and after various disagreements with his ally which worked out to his disadvantage, Hasan-i Buzurg again turned to the khan of Khurasan. A new agreement he made with him managed to survive for three years, until 744/1343-4. Coins struck at Baghdad and other Mesopotamian mints which bear his name are evidence that the Jalayirid recognised Togha Temiir's suzerainty at this time. Although his accord with the Jalayirid prince had ensured the recognition Togha Temiir so desired over large areas of Persia, indeed even in Iraq and eastern Anatolia, this lasted only for a short period in each case. And the price he paid for this episode in his career, the fleeting dream of an Il-Khanid restoration, was its devastating results. A mere few years of ill-advised policy had been enough to deplete the military strength of Khurasan and its economic resources to a point from which no regeneration was possible. Worse still, the way was now open for
21



JALAYIRIDS, MUZAFFARIDS AND SARBADARS
political forces to come into play with which neither Togha Temiir nor anyone else in Khurasan could contend. These forces burst out in the rising of the Sarbadars, a revolt which in all probability was a reaction to fiscal burdens imposed on the amirs and leading men of Khurasan by 'Ala' al-Dln Muhammad, mentioned earlier, to cover the increased costs pf maintaining the KhurasanI, and no doubt also the Jalayirid, troqps, and coming on top of the increases provided for in the financial reforms carried out only a few years before by the vizier Ghiyas al-Dln (see above). That Sabzavar itself was the centre of the disturbances may possibly be connected with the fact that the city, and Bashtln, which belonged to it, lay in the area administered by 'Ala' al-Dln himself and would thus be hit by the full severity of the new measures. The rebellion cannot be precisely dated, but it seems most likely that it took place at a time when the KhurasanI troops were otherwise engaged and not available for use in Sabzavar. Various interconnections would suggest the period shortly before the first Khurasanl-Jalayirid alliance. Of the various conflicting accounts we possess of the beginning of the rising, Hafiz-i Abru's seems the most inherently probable version. According to this, Amir 'Abd al-Razzaq, the son of a very powerful figure and himself a highly placed person, killed a government official ('amil), probably a tax-collector, in the township of Bashtln, which formed part of the district of Sabzavar, and then fomented a rising in order to avoid punishment. The motive for the killing is explained as an act of protest against oppressive methods used to collect increased taxes. By chance, the murdered official was a nephew of 'Ala' al-Dln. Although 'Abd al-Razzaq found support, which enables us to conclude that the situation was tense, it is stretching the available evidence too
far to talk, as does Petrushevsky,1 of angry masses consisting of peasants, impoverished town-dwellers and artisans; nor is there sufficient warrant for the class struggle, racial friction or national antagonisms which he adduces as additional factors to support his hypothesis of a peasants' revolt. The solid fact of the matter which we should keep in mind is that 'Abd al-Razzaq belonged to the feudal ruling class of Khurasan, which had plainly been made to bear the brunt of considerable increases resulting from 'Ala' al-Dln's tax reforms. Had he belonged to the class of small landowners, there would have been no

22



THE SARBADARS AND THEIR RIVALS
plausible reason for his action: for the rise in taxation applied only to the wealthy and powerful in the land and not to the peasants and small landowners, whose own taxes, moreover, had been cancelled at the same time as these increases were imposed. Immediately after the start of the rising, the ranks of the rebels, who - no doubt following well-tried precedents - had fallen back into the mountains, were so heavily swollen as a result of their successes against the militia and raids on caravans and herds of cattle that in the summer of 738/1337 they were able to take possession of the city of Sabzavar. 'Abd al-Razzaq, who now assumed the title of amir and had himself named on the coinage and in the official prayers, was stabbed to death by his brother Vajih al-Din Mas'ud shortly afterwards in the course of a marauding expedition. The incident did take place in hot blood, during an argument between them, but may also have had deeper political motives. At all events, Mas'ud, who now took over the leadership of the Sarbadars, for the moment abandoned the policy of confrontation in favour of one of compromise. He recognised Togha Temiir and solemnly undertook to pay taxes to him. This change is authenticated by coins from Sabzavar. Both sides gained advantages from the new modus vivendi: the khan no longer needed to fear raids by the Sarbadars, which had seriously jeopardised supplies for his troops, and the Sarbadars were not exposed to government sanctions. By taking the city of Sabzavar, the Sarbadars had not only acquired a considerable political centre but had also established contact with an ideological movement which was to exercise a powerful influence on their future development: above all it provided them with new adherents and strong religious stimuli. In contrast to other places in Khurasan, it contained a large number of Shl'Is whose zeal for the faith had shortly before been roused to a pitch of intensity by the preaching of a mystic from Mazandaran named Shaikh Khalifa. The Sunnls must have regarded his activities as dangerous; at all events, they had him murdered. After his death one of his disciples, Hasan Jurl, took over his role, scoring even greater successes in his propagandistic travels from one town of Khurasan to another. His activities aroused the suspicion of the government authorities; in Shawwal 736/May 1336 he had to take refuge in flight and went to 'Iraq-i 'Ajam. When he later returned, by a circuitous route, Arghun Shah had him arrested (740/1339-40). It is quite possible that Mas'ud had a hand in his eventual release: later, Hasan's personal influence and wide popularity

induced him not only to join the order as a novice imurld) but also following a practice seen among the earlier Sarbadars — to give Hasan a joint share in government, for in the official prayers Hasan's name was mentioned first, before that of Mas'ud. The shaikh proclaimed the imminent return of the Twelfth Imam. He had earlier founded a secret organisation to prepare for Shl'I theocratic rule; this included an armed
force which was apparently organised along the lines of the futuwwa1 and was composed of artisans and merchants. Though the oddly matched joint rulers began by cooperating well, tensions were present from the outset. In the first place, there was Hasan Jurl's popularity among the Shl'I population of Sabzavar, with which Mas'ud could not compete. Then there were the totally different objectives of the two men. Hasan continued to hold to his Shl'I and theocratic idea of the state, whereas Mas'ud regarded Khurasan as an integral part of an Il-Khanid empire that was in the very nature of things essentially SunnI, at first under the rule of Togha Temiir and then - as we shall see - under Chobanid lordship. Finally, Hasan's adherents, with their markedly religious orientation, were devotedly intent on furthering radical Shl'I ideas, whereas those of Mas'ud, in so far as they were Shl'I at all, supported a moderate line. This led to the emergence of two groups of Sarbadars, namely the original followers of 'Abd al-Razzaq and Mas'ud, and those of Hasan Jurl, who were called Shaikhiyan to distinguish them from the others. It was the latter in particular who were responsible for the reputation the Sarbadars have had with many commentators — even earlier ones — as robbers and riff-raff. Although Vajlh al-Dln Mas'ud's reign lasted only six years, i.e. until the summer of 745/1344,2 it brought about a quite remarkable expan

sion of the Sarbadar state. What made this possible was the efficient army he created, said to consist of 12,000 well armed mounted peasants and 700 Turkish slave troops as his personal bodyguard, together with Hasan Juri's dervishes, the Shaikhiyan. The first blow was directed in 741/1340 against Arghvin Shah's Ja'un-i Qurban, who were obliged to give up Nlshapur and retreated to Tus. As coins with Togha Temiir's name were minted in Sabzavar in the very next year, the Sarbadars must have assumed that the khan, who had been away on operations in the west at the time of their campaign, would overlook this liberty. He did not, however, but marched against them. His troops were routed, and while fleeing to Mazandaran such eminent figures as the vizier 'Ala' al-Dln Muhammad and 'Abd-Allah b. Mulai were killed; indeed even the khan's brother 'All Ke'iin, lost his life. The victors occupied Jajarm, Damghan and Simnan, together with Togha Temiir's capital, Gurgan. By this victory a totally different situation had been created. When they took Nlshapur the Sarbadars had come up against a population which was almost exclusively Sunni, and by conquering Simnan they had become neighbours to the Chobanids, who were also Sunni. Naturally, they considered the suzerainty of Togha Temiir as having lapsed, and Mas'ud recognised in his place the Chobanid Hasan-i Kuchak and the shadow khan Sulaiman whom he had appointed; though the decision can hardly have been taken in consultation with his co-regent, since these were Sunni princes. Differences had in fact already arisen between them because Mas'ud rejected the idea of forcibly converting the Sunnls of the conquered territories to Shi'ism. The dominions of the Sarbadars now embraced a territory the size of Ireland. But with the recognition of Hasan-i Kuchak they were confronted with a real threat emanating from the Kartid of Herat, Mu'izz al-Dln Husain, whose father, it will be remembered, had killed Amir Choban when he was in flight from Abu Sa'Id and sought refuge at his court. Furthermore, Husain was an ally of Togha Temiir. The Sarbadars attempted to scotch this danger by means of a preventive strike. The armies met at Zava (13 Safar 743/18 July 1342), and the battle initially went in favour of the Sarbadars. But when Shaikh Hasan Jiirl fell, the fortunes of war changed, since the dervishes broke off the engagement, assuming - probably not without justification - that their shaikh had not died at the hands of the enemy but had been struck down by an assassin hired by Mas'ud. The battle thus resulted not only
25



JALAYIRIDS, MUZAFFARIDS AND SARBADARS
in defeat but also in an unleashing of hostilities and tensions that had been latent in the relations between the moderate supporters of Mas'ud and the radical Shaikhiyan for a long time past. The total implications of this clash of views, however, did not become plain until later. At first Mas'ud may well have thought that he could attain his objectives even without the dervishes. In his next expedition, two years later, he aimed to eliminate Togha Temur, who had withdrawn to the region of Amul, secured the support of local princes, and was blocking the Sarbadars' lines of communication with their Chobanid allies in the west. Although the campaign got off to a good start, it ended in catastrophe. On the march from Sari to Amul the Sarbadar army was trapped in a pincer movement by the enemy. Mas'ud himself was taken prisoner and executed. Their two defeats, one in the east, the other in the west of their dominions, had thrown the Sarbadars back upon the starting-point of their operations, the region of Sabzavar and probably also Juvain and Nlshapur. Nevertheless, they had no need to fear for their survival. None of their rivals was in a position after all these years of heavy fighting to subject the whole of Khurasan to his control, let alone to extend his power beyond its frontiers. For much the same reasons, there was little danger from the outside. The princes of Khurasan came to a compromise agreement. Togha Temiir was free to return to Astarabad and Gurgan, having settled for the recognition of his suzerainty on the part of the Sarbadars; and even Arghun Shah in the east was once more able to exercise his authority as leader of the Ja'un-i Qurban. The Sarbadars of Khurasan survived by almost forty years the death of Mas'ud, who had more than a dozen successors. Since one of them, 'All-yi Mu'ayyad, managed to stay in power for twenty years (763—83/1361—81), their very number is evidence of how troubled the period from 745/1344 to 763/1361 must have been. The chief feature of these years was in fact incessant fighting and quarrelling over the rulership. The way these disputes are recorded in the evidence we have is not free of contradictions; but the details are in any case only of limited importance for the history of the region and certainly for the history of Iran. In the context we are considering it is sufficient to trace the main lines of development. How important the division into two parties (the moderate adherents of Mas'ud and the party of the radical dervishes) was for the

further progress of events, requires a more closely differentiated treat
ment. John Masson Smith1 reckons among Mas'ud's supporters not only the members of his family such as his son Lutf-Allah, (who, incidentally, later himself reigned for a short time), but also the gentry of Bashtin, as well as his army, to which — apart from professional soldiers - belonged also escaped slaves, former bandits and Turkish slave troops {ghulaman). On the other side there was the group of the Sabzavaris, of which Hasan Jurl's dervish organisation has already been mentioned. It also included the Sabzavari aristocracy [khwdja^adagari) and the trade guilds, which may have been organised on the principles of the futuwwa. Not only were the two main parties at odds with each other, but each lacked internal unity as well. For example, there were considerable points of difference within the Sabzavaris arising from the theocratic concepts of the extreme dervishes. These did not meet with the approval of all Shl'is, for there were moderate groups even among them who leaned more towards cooperation with the Sunnis than towards the acceptance of such radical ideas. All in all, this kind of analysis of Sarbadar society would appear to do more justice to the facts than Petrushevsky's division into "popular masses" of peasants, urban poor, and artisans in opposition to the feudal lords consisting of small Iranian landowners and a Mongol-Turkish nomad aristocracy, and his hypothesis of class struggle and racial hostilities in the period. Vajlh al-Dln Mas'ud's first three successors came from the group of his adherents: these were two of his military commanders and his brother Shams al-Dln b. Fazl-Allah. All fell from power after the briefest time, and the periods of their rule total only three years. Meanwhile, the alliance with the Chobanids was abandoned; their power in any case came to an end with the fall of Hasan-i Kuchak about this time. In addition, the death in 743/1343 of Arghun Shah, the leader of the Ja'un-i Qurban, proved convenient to the Sarbadars, since his son and successor Muhammad Beg, giving up his alliance with Togha Temiir, established friendly relations with them; so that, with one exception, there were no further clashes with this neighbour. Not until Shams al-Dln 'All, a dervish of the Sabzavari group, came to power was there again a personality of stature in charge of affairs. The achievements of his five years of government (748 to 752/1347 to

1351-2) are praised by the historian Daulatshah. He records that the people lived under quite reasonable conditions. The officials were paid in cash. Notes (bardf) were no longer issued to cover salaries and soldiers' pay on tax payments due, an abuse which was evidently quite common. The new ruler carried out effective tax reforms, by means of which he reorganised the shaky finances of the state. Thus he was able to maintain efficient fighting units, with which he effectively protected his territory, now extending from Nishapur in the east to Damghan in the west. He admittedly failed to take the city of Tus, but did succeed in putting down a revolt in Damghan. By his simple manner of life, through the honesty and thrift on which he insisted in the conduct of state affairs, he won the affection of large sections of the population. His measures against prostitution, drugs, and alcohol are also worthy of mention. The swift decline of Mas'ud's adherents and the passing of power to a Sabzavarl may be seen as indications of the growth of this party. In fact the strength of Mas'ud's adherents and his troops had been severely weakened by his unfortunate military enterprises, whereas the dervishes, who had taken no further part in his campaigns since the death of Shaikh Hasan Jurl, had suffered no losses. Nevertheless, it must have been consideration for the forces of Mas'ud, predominantly Sunnls or moderate Shfls, that kept Shams al-Dln 'AH, who had belonged to Hasan's intimate circle and therefore must in all probability himself have been a ShI'I, from officially introducing the Shl'I confession. For ten years, from 748/1347 to 758/1357, the government of the Sarbadars was SunnI, as shown by the coins of which details have been published to date. In spite of his efforts for the common weal — perhaps even because of them - Shams al-DIn 'All soon made some bitter enemies, especially among those who distrusted him for his connections with extreme Shl'Is, i.e. the dervishes; among the libertines, who disliked his puritanical ways; and finally among the corrupt servants of the state, who lost out as a result of his reforms. One of the latter, Haidar Qassab, whose name suggests that he was a member of an artisan guild, was responsible for his murder. Although the immediate motive for the act was revenge for a punishment he had received for irregularities in the conduct of the tax collection for which he was responsible, it looks very much as if he also had backers in the circles of those of higher rank who were dissatisfied.
28



THE SARBADARS AND THEIR RIVALS
The elimination of Shams al-Dln 'All is probably not to be traced, as might be supposed, to the adherents of Mas'ud, but to the Sabzavarls, that is to say, the group to which he himself belonged, as also did his successor, Yahya Karavl (752 to 756/1351-2 to 1355-6), a member of the Sabzavari aristocracy. Under his rule the power and extent of the Sarbadar state reached a new peak. But first it was necessary to remove the major danger that had threatened this state from the beginning, the khan Togha Temiir. In spite of the reverses he had had to endure in his struggle with the Sarbadars, he regarded them as rebels who were to be destroyed at the earliest possible opportunity. They might be tolerated under the pressure of sheer circumstance, but they could not be recognised. Togha Temiir's dominions had indeed been severely reduced in size, most recently by the defection of the Kartid of Herat, who had previously paid tribute to him, and of the Ja'un-i Qurban and the Turkish tribes in the steppelands around Herat. Nevertheless, with his tribal units living in Gurgan and Astarabad, estimated at 50,000,' he was a potential danger to the Sarbadars, who had only 22,000 men under arms at the time. Yahya successfully attempted to lull the khan into a sense of false security by promising to recognise his suzerainty (a fact which is authenticated by many coins bearing his name struck in Sabzavar), and by undertaking to pay taxes as well as to make loyal visits once every year to demonstrate his obedience. When in Dhu'l-Qa'da 754/ November—December 1353 he went to the Mongol winter camp of Sultan-Duvln in the vicinity of Astarabad, accompanied by only a small military train, his appearance must have been associated with such a visit which was just about due. At all events, he was able to make his way unchallenged through the camp and into the tent of the khan. The men with him assassinated Togha Temiir and cut down his courtiers. In order to eliminate any possibility of a successor, the Mongol troops were done to death and the khan's herds, without which the nomads were deprived of the very basics of life, were all slaughtered. Though Luqman, a son of the murdered khan, constantly reappears up to the year 790/1388 in the struggle for mastery in Khurasan, the fall of Togha Temiir put paid once and for all to any idea of a restoration of the Il-Khanid empire. The power of the Sarbadars now once more reached those far-flung

frontiers which Mas'ud had achieved by his conquests and then forfeited by his recklessness; indeed, it even spread beyond them — in the
west into the area around Ray, in the east as far as Tus, and m t n e north-west to Astarabad and Shasman in the region of Gurgan. Even these great efforts in the cause of Sarbadar power could not spare Yahya Karavl the fate which had come to be almost customary for Sarbadar princes, namely murder by his opponents. From the evidence available it is not possible to say with certainty who was behind the assassination. It could have been adherents of Mas'ud who would have preferred to see one of their number in power. The likely candidate would have been Mas'ud's son Lutf-Allah, who in fact did later
become ruler. It has even been argued1 that he had, strictly speaking, already succeeded by the time of his father's death, but that in view of his youth others had exercised the regency on his behalf. If the state had had to contend up to this point with external enemies, it was from now on affected by severe internal crises. These could well have threatened its very existence, and that they did not was only because there were no strong external enemies to be confronted at the time. Haidar Qassab, whom we have already mentioned, now promptly arrived from Astarabad to bring Yahya's murderers to justice. He installed Yahya's nephew Zahlr al-Dln Karavl as ruler, but soon afterwards seized power himself when the latter failed to fulfil his expectations. Lacking sufficient supporters, he had in fact overreached himself by this action. As will be recalled, he had originally been a member of Shams al-Dln 'All's party, which is the reason why he found no friends among the adherents of Mas'ud; later he had murdered his master and thereby had forfeited also the sympathies of the dervishes (the Shaikhiyan). Meanwhile, in Isfara'in, the most important city of the Sarbadars after Sabzavar, Lutf-Allah's royal tutor and atabeg Nasr-Allah had fomented a rebellion with the aid of those of Yahya's murderers who had escaped the vengeance of Haidar Qassab. Haidar now turned upon the rebels. But before the issue could be decided in the field, he was struck down by the dagger of an assassin hired by Hasan Damghanl. Now Lutf-Allah's hour had come, and since there were still certain circles with sympathies for his father he could well have succeeded in founding a dynasty for the Sarbadars. But this opportunity was lost when, in

the conflict with Hasan DamghanI which ensued with inevitable rapidity, he was defeated. As a result the party of his father's supporters was
to all intents and purposes annihilated.1 These events in themselves show how feeble were the foundations of the state; but the civil war which now began demonstrated how utterly incapable it was of coping with the centrifugal forces that threatened it. Haidar Qassab's move out of Astarabad had left a vacuum which encouraged Amir Vail, a son of the previous governor of the province, to return from the refuge he had been granted by a prince of the Ja'un-i Qurban. He claimed to be representing the interests of Luqman b. Togha Temiir in his absence from Mazandaran, in order to gather the latter's sympathisers around him, but had not the remotest intention when he arrived there of actually handing over power to him. For in the meantime he had beaten in succession two expeditionary corps sent against him by Hasan, and finally he defeated Hasan himself, so that he was in a position to extend his power over other territories of the Sarbadars as well. In eastern Khurasan a radical Shl'I named Darvlsh 'Aziz2 rose in revolt and established a theocracy in Mashhad in the name of the Twelfth Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdl (d. 329/940). This sort of enterprise was in the air at the time: Hasan Jurl and Shams al-Dln 'All, after all, had themselves wanted to establish the theocratic state of the Mahdi, and we may assume that the Shaikhiyan of Sabzavar were represented among the supporters of Darvish 'Aziz. At any rate his successes in Mashhad, which were continued still further with the conquest of Tus, must have electrified the Sabzavarl dervishes, who were of course also devoted to the idea of a theocratic state. Hasan DamghanI recognised the danger that this implied for him, marched east and put an end to the Mahdist state. Darvlsh 'Aziz went into exile in Isfahan. While Hasan DamghanI was fully engaged in the north-western and eastern parts of his country, another danger was brewing for him in Damghan, to the west. Here 'All-yi Mu'ayyad rose in revolt and gathered around him the troops of Hasan's enemies who had been defeated and were in flight. He also sent for Darvlsh 'Aziz in Isfahan and joined

his order; and together they prepared for the conflict with Hasan Damghanl. When the latter was laying siege to the castle of Shaqqan, near Jajarm, after taking Mashhad and Tus, they captured Sabzavar in a surprise attack (763/1361-2). They succeeded in acquiring not only the possessions of Hasan's followers but also their families. 'All-yi Mu'ayyad's demand to Hasan's followers, that they should depose their master and send him his head as a sign of their loyalty, therefore produced the desired result. Authority among the Sarbadars was now vested in a duumvirate which shows striking similarities to that of Vajlh al-Dln Mas'Gd and Hasan Jurl. As in the former situation, the condominium worked quite well to begin with, in fact for ten months. Though 'AH-yi Mu'ayyad, who was himself a Shl'I, played his part in raising Shi'ism to the state religion, he resisted certain notions dear to the heart of Darvlsh 'Aziz as to what the Mahdist state should be; and this led, just as before, to severe tensions, culminating in the removal of the dervish leader. Again the decisive moment came during a campaign against Malik Husain of Herat, except that 'All's men did not wait until they met up with the enemy, but picked a quarrel with the dervishes while still on the march. Darvlsh 'Aziz and many of his adherents were killed as they attempted to escape. 'All-yi Mu'ayyad did not leave it at this but seized his opportunity to rid himself of the threat from the dervishes once and for all. He smashed their organisation and hounded them out of Sabzavar; he even went so far as to have the graves of Shaikh Khalifa and Hasan Jurl destroyed. But although he had broken the power of his enemy for the time being, banishing the dervishes from his immediate entourage, they were still not done away with altogether. They found a welcome from Malik Husain in Herat, from the Ja'un-i Qurban and from the Muzaffarid Shah-i Shuja' in Shlraz. It goes without saying that from these places of refuge they now bided their time; nor, if things ran to the form familiar to contemporaries, would it be long in coming. In fact, in the final phase of the Sarbadar state which now began, the dervishes were a significant element and contributed their share to its downfall. ( 'All-yi Mu'ayyad managed to remain ruler for twenty years and even survived Tlmur's invasion. Although it would be quite wrong to infer that this long reign was a period of peace and quiet, a certain degree of stabilisation does seem to have taken place, at least for a time. There is

evidence of this in the steady quality of the coinage to begin with, although only up to the middle of his reign, when against a background of stormy political events a decline in quality set in which was never to be halted. 'AH-yi Mu'ayyad is described as a just and efficient prince, in so far as anyone could be in the conditions of the day, and he did in fact improve the lot of the peasants by a reform of the tax system. The unsolved external problems of the Sarbadar empire which 'All-yi Mu'ayyad had taken on when he assumed power in Sabzavar had a determining influence on his reign. Though the Ja'un-i Qurban gained control of Tus again, there do not seem to have been any further conflicts with them. There was a conflict, however, with Amir Vail, who had in the past enjoyed their protection and was related by marriage to one of their leading men. Hasan DamghanI had had trouble with him in his time but had not been able to put him down. He had extended his control over Bistam and Simnan, whereas Astarabad, where between 767/1365-6 and 770/1368-9 Sarbadar coins were struck, was at least for a time subject to the government at Sabzavar before falling back again into the hands of Amir Vail. 'All-yi Mu'ayyad in fact avoided bringing the dispute to a head, because he saw this rival's area of control as a convenient buffer state against the Jalayirids. At the time they were beginning to evince rapacious designs on Khurasan, with the result that Amir Vail was obliged to mount campaigns against them in the region of Ray and Sava. 'All-yi Mu'ayyad found himself drawn into a critical situation as a result of what was happening among the Kartids of Herat when in 771/1370 Malik Mu'izz al-Din Husain died and the succession passed to his two sons Ghiyas al-DIn Plr 'All and Malik Muhammad. Plr 'All, a grandson of Togha Temur through his mother Sultan Khatun, saw 'All-yi Mu'ayyad as sympathising with the murderers of his grandfather and stirred up against him the Sabzavari dervishes now living as emigrants in his own territory. The Sarbadar leader retorted by conspiring with Plr 'All's stepbrother Malik Muhammad, who ruled over the smaller portion of the Kartid empire from the city of Sarakhs. When Plr 'All marched against Malik Muhammad, 'All-yi Mu'ayyad rescued him in a flanking attack by overcoming one of Plr 'All's castles near the frontier whose captains were emigrant Sabzavari dervishes. This was not only a blow struck at his own enemies; it also induced Plr 'All to come to a compromise with his brother. So commenced the

years of fighting against Pir 'All which tied down the Sarbadars to Nishapur, the most important place in the eastern part of the country, and inevitably prejudiced the defence of their capital. This situation proved to be a challenge to 'All-yi Mu'ayyad's opponents in the west, especially the dervishes who had fled to Shlraz, who had found an enterprising leader in Rukn al-Dln, a disciple of their unsuccessful master Darvlsh 'Aziz. Together with Iskandar, Pir 'All's former governor of Nishapur, he now mounted against Khurasan a campaign which was supported with money and arms by Shah-i Shuja'. They conquered Sabzavar (778/1376-7); and 'All-yi Mu'ayyad was forced intoflightand found refuge with Amir Vail. The new condominium in Sabzavar, which promptly set about establishing a radical Shl'I regime based on the teachings of Hasan Jurl, was followed at once by a still more drastic reduction of the Sarbadar state, which had in any case severely contracted. Nishapur was conquered by Pir 'All, and it was not long before Amir Vail appeared before the gates of Sabzavar. His entourage included Shah Mansur, the rival of the Muzaffarid Shah-i Shuja' of Shlraz, and 'All-yi Mu'ayyad, whom Amir Vail reinstated as ruler after the capture of the town. The alliance between Amir Vail and the Sarbadar leader did not endure for long. By 783/1-3 81 Amir Vail was once again besieging the city. In his extremity 'All-yi Mu'ayyad turned to Tlmur; and his appeal for help was destined not to go unheeded. It afforded the immediate pretext for Tlmur's invasion of Persia. This did not yet mean the final end of the history of the Sarbadars of Khurasan, even though it was the end of their autonomy as a state. It will be necessary to refer to their later fortunes when discussing Tlmur's appearance on the Persian scene. At this point, however, some comment is required on various effects of, and parallels with, the rule of the Sarbadars, extending to regions outside
Khurasan. We shall not consider the Sarbadars of Samarqand,1 since they do not directly form part of the history of Persia; but some mention should be made, if only in broad outline, of events in Mazandaran, Gllan arid Kirman. In the reign of Shams al-Dln 'All an adherent of Hasan Jurl, named 'Izz al-Dln, together with a group of co-religionists who like him were not prepared to accept the conditions in Sabzavar, resolved to
1 See Barthold, "Narodnoe dvizhenie"; also Yakubovsky, "Timur", pp. 56—8, who on the authority of 'Abd al-Razzaq's Mafia' refers to the Samarqand rebels as "Sarbadars", though whether they themselves employed the term is doubtful.

THE SARBADARS AND THEIR RIVALS
return to his homeland of Mazandaran. However, he died en route, and his son Sayyid Qivam al-Dln, known as Mlr-i Buzurg, took his place. He managed to settle in Amul and to found a state in conjunction with Kiya Afrasiyab b. Hasan ChulabI, who in 750/1349 had brought down the local dynasty of the Bavandids, which had lasted for
seven hundred years.1 This state ran in many respects along the lines of that of Sabzavar. The dichotomy between a ruler who leant towards secular attitudes and a dervish aiming at a theocratic structure again led to a conflict, which ended with the victory of the religious fanatic. This state lasted until its destruction by Tlmur in 794/1392, but after his death it emerged briefly once more. With the aid of the Mazandaranl dervishes a group of Shl'I shaikhs also gained control in Gllan under the leadership of Shaikh Amir Kiya. The state he called into being endured for over two centuries - which was doubtless largely due to its geographical remoteness - until it was
finally absorbed in 1000/15 92 i n t o t n e Safavid empire. In 774/1373 a revolt took place in Kirman against Shah-i Shuja', the prince of Shlraz, fomented by Pahlavan Asad b. Toghan Shah. The rebellion received military support from 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad, whose relations with Shah-i Shuja' have already been discussed, but was put down in Rajab 776/December 1374 by troops sent from Shlraz.
Seen as a historical phenomenon, the Sarbadars of Khurasan are a quite typical product of the situation in Persia after the collapse of the Il-Khanid empire, but they display certain noteworthy differences from what is found elsewhere. Khurasan resembled other parts of the empire in that it lacked a single dominant power, and possessed in Togha Temiir a descendant of the Mongol rulers who was too weak to assert effective control. But what distinguishes the Sarbadars from practically all contemporary rulers in Persia is the absence of any legitimist claims on their part. It was not only that none of them could claim descent from a Mongol or other princely house or the warrant of having previously exercised high office; they plainly did not even consider it necessary to seek to establish any legitimate claim to rule. None of them had a Mongol shadow khan or marriage ties with a highly placed family, and there was no serious attempt to found a dynasty. Another point of difference is the religious aspect, which played so great a part among the Sarbadars. It was expressed particularly, though

not exclusively, in the share the Sabzavarl dervishes had in Sarbadar rule, whether in the form of a condominium with a secular ruler, or as observers keeping at a discreet distance, or as rivals with a keen eye to their chances or even occasionally as sole rulers. It is undoubtedly significant that the population of their capital city had a strong Shl'I component and that also, we may assume, many of their rulers, perhaps even the majority of them, belonged to the Shl'a. But none of this was decisive, any more than the basic opposition between Shl'a and Sunna in this particular situation. Moderate Shl'Is in this period could, and in some cases actually did, reach a modus vivendi with Sunnls more easily than with the dervishes. The stumbling-block for both parties was rather the dervishes' adherence to a rigid organisation with unambiguous ideas of what the state should be, ideas which they advanced with uncompromising firmness. The goal of the dervishes was a Mahdist state, a theocracy with an extremist Shl'I state religion, and hence a Utopia which admitted of no compromise with other conceptions of statehood. It appears very much as if the princes who did not come from the ranks of the Shaikhiyan were at first not fully conscious of this aim. How else are we to explain the numerous attempts at establishing a condominium together with committed supporters of the dervishes? Not even so far-reaching a concession as joining the dervish order as a novice (murld) saved those rulers who did so from the painful discovery that the theocracy the dervishes demanded was not to be reconciled with their own divergent conceptions of the state, nor even, in fact, with Shl'I ideas on the subject. Practical illustrations of this are not far to seek, and at bottom it was this very incompatibility of other attitudes with an ideological conception of government which was the undoing of the Sarbadar state. In spite of numerous successes scored by each party over the other, the dichotomy of the Sarbadar state displays a balance of forces leading not to a modus vivendi but to decades of conflict, the net result of which was to weaken both parties. Mas'ud's adherents were unable to exclude the dervishes; nor again were the dervishes powerful enough to supplant their opponents. The result was a process of mutual exhaustion, a gradual attrition that had virtually extinguished the Sarbadars' will to survive by the time Tlmur advanced against Persia. The Shaikhiyan must of course be reckoned among the many religious movements in the Islamic world that strove for power and in a

THE SARBADARS AND THEIR RIVALS
fair number of instances actually gained control. Iran seems to have been good soil for such movements, as can be seen from a number of comparable phenomena from both earlier and later periods. It was the tragedy of the Sabzavari dervishes that in their time and in their country there were also other political forces at work, especially among the provincial nobility, who were aiming at power simultaneously with them; and that it was impossible either to win these over or subject them - so that, in the end, there was nothing left for any of them but to sink together. But apart from the conflict of interests at home, the Sarbadars were also threatened by external enemies. They did manage to overcome Togha Temur after some time, but not his less impressive successor Amir Vail. Though there were conflicts with the Ja'Gn-i Qurban, for a long time peaceful relations prevailed; while the struggle against the Kartids of Herat remained indecisive. All these opponents kept up a state of feud with the Sarbadars, irrespective of which of their two parties happened to have provided the ruling figure of the time. Although the Sarbadars' rule started with a rising against the Mongols or their representatives, their further history cannot be thought of exclusively from this point of view. Once they had compelled Togha Temiir to tolerate them in principle, their policies were no longer determined solely by an anti-Mongol attitude, so that eliminating Togha Temiir was ultimately only a matter of choosing the right moment. As for the question of their constituting a robber state, it is doubtful whether such a view is justified by any of the circumstances of their history - neither the frankly dubious name they chose to go by, nor their lack of or indifference to a legitimate claim, nor the absence of a dynastic line, nor the conflicts waged against established rulers of somewhat questionable legitimacy. The fact that the Sarbadars in their campaigning were not given to considerate treatment of their enemies or the civilian population is hardly an argument to be used against them, since it is hard to imagine any belligerent party of the time which would have behaved differently. To this extent, therefore, the estimate we make of the Sarbadars need be no different from that applied to their rivals or any other rulers in contemporary Persia. This view is also supported by the fact that they were not without their share of cultural activity or at least various efforts in this direction. We may mention just two examples: the efforts made by Shams al-Dln 'All to develop Sabzavar architecturally, which led to the building of a Friday
37



JALAYIRIDS, MUZAFFARIDS AND SARBADARS
mosque (masjid-i jami') and a warehouse affording work for artisans. Another aspect was their interest in poetry, as evidenced by their panegyrist Muhammad Tughra'I, known as Ibn-i Yamin, who made a
name for himself in literary history1. At the battle of Zava he fell into the hands of the Kartids, spent some time as court poet in Herat, and eventually managed to escape and return to the Sarbadar dominions. Finally we may mention the relations of 'All-yi Mu'ayyad with the
eminent Shl'I theologian Ibn Makkl al-'Amill,2 who was responsible for so important a Shl'I book of law as al-Lum'a al-Dimashqiyya. This sort of evidence is also not easily fitted into the notion of a robber state. If not a robber state, then, what of the interpretation of the Sarbadars as the social revolutionary movement of which Petrushevsky speaks? This view is certainly correct to the extent that the phenomenon is traceable back to a revolt by suppressed and exploited sections of the population. But proof is lacking that it was a rebellion of the mass of the producing class against the exploiters. 'Abd al-Razzaq, with whom, in this view, the beginnings of the rising are very closely associated, was neither a peasant nor a representative of the lesser gentry who had espoused the peasants' cause because the latter were not in a position to press their own case. In fact, he belonged precisely to that aristocratic class of society at which the revolt of the exploited masses would have needed to be aimed. Moreover, the sources bearing on the social class of the various leading figures only rarely give any lead to speak of, so that any coherent interpretation on the pattern of socio-critical models is a dubious undertaking in the present state of knowledge. Nevertheless, it is still legitimate to ask whether the dervishes of the Shaikhiyan may not properly be seen as a socially progressive group: in other words, whether the radical ideas they stood for in religious matters did not also have social implications or effects going beyond the principles of their order and their idea of a theocratic state. It is possible to infer an answer to this question from the particular manifestations within whose framework the Shaikhiyan are located. We are very well informed on one of these, which had experienced a spectacular upsurge at this very period, namely the Safaviyya of Shaikh SafI al-Dln

from Herat: cf. Rypka, HIL, p. 261, and "Ibn-i Yamin", El2.

THE SARBADARS AND THEIR RIVALS
Ishaq (d. 735/1334)- This was the religious-cum-political nucleus from which, at a later time, Shah Isma'U I's state was to emerge. Even though at this time - in contrast to the Shaikhiyan - it was not yet Shi'I, certain approaches of the two orders may very well have corresponded closely to each other. Reduced to a brief formula: both orders were groups based on religious principles with an unmistakable orientation towards political influence and claims to secular power, except that in the case of the Shaikhiyan the political component was already
much more strongly developed than in the Safaviyya.1 This may have been due to differences in local conditions, but was probably due also to the markedly theocratic inclinations of the dervishes of Sabzavar, aimed as they were at the establishment of a Mahdist state. Social effects may occasionally have come about in the process. But these are rather to be understood as ingredients of the religious programmes of politically motivated groups, and most certainly not the other way round. Interpretations of the Shaikhiyan as a social revolutionary movement go beyond the limits imposed on the historian by the available evidence.
The cliche of a social-progressive movement or group does not apply to the Shaikhiyya of Sabzavar, any more than the label of a robber-state applies to the Sarbadar movement. The designation "Sarbadar dynasty" is hardly adequate, given the absence of a hereditary succession, which is
the characteristic feature of a dynasty.2 It would be possible, rather, to
speak of an oligarchy and even, in a very limited sense, of a republic,3 if
one is unwilling to retain the definition of "a kingdom without kings",4 which is most suited to the conditions of this period.
1 Glassen, Die friihen Saftmiiden, p. 43, nevertheless reaches the conclusion: "The early Safawlya were a mass movement ... Safi ad-dln had no wish to be the leader of an esoteric tariqa in the midst of an elite association of disciples, but consciously devoted his whole energy to winning over the broad masses." Even Bina-Motlagh, Scheich Safi von Ardabil, pp. 53-68, gives detailed consideration to Shaikh SafTs political connections, though he tends to see him rather as a saint (p. 126: "totally set apart from earthly things"). 2 The title of John Masson Smith's book is not to be understood, of course, in a genealogical
sen3seA. ubin, "La fin de l'etat Sarbadar", p. 95: ". . . un Etat.. . organise en 'republique', sans devolution hereditaire de l'autorite, par les representants de divers courants politiques". On p. 117, in the same context, he even speaks of the "phenomene d'auto-gouvernement iranien".

CHAPTER Z
TTMUR IN IRAN
Timur's advances from Transoxiana into the Near East radically transformed conditions in Iran. The resulting changes were not confined to political affairs or to the structure of the state but also affected to a considerable degree the ethnic composition of Persia, the economic and social situation in the country and its cultural development. In the decades following the demise of the Tl-Khan Abu Sa'Id the state of Iran was fragmented and there was widespread evidence of the collapse of national power. In itself, this might well have aroused the expansionist appetites of neighbouring states much earlier, but with the exception of the Golden Horde they simply lacked the military strength to take advantage of the situation. The Ottoman empire, as yet in its early stages, was just one of countless Anatolian principalities and constituted even less of a threat to Iran than any of the Turkmen tribal groups, such as the Qara Quyunlu, that were still struggling to obtain a political status. Nor is there any record of military advances by Egypt into Iran. The vast distances and the almost insurmountable geographical barriers involved make it unlikely that even the Mamluk
sultans contemplated such invasion plans,1 and certainly any hopes the Muzaffarid Shah-i Shuja' may have entertained when he granted recognition to the token caliph al-Mutawakkil 'ala'llah Abu 'Abd-Allah Muhammad of Cairo were to remain unfulfilled. The situation was quite different, however, as far as the Golden Horde was concerned. At the court of Saral a keen interest was shown in events in Persia, and the ruling khans of the period were greatly attracted by the idea of gaining influence there. Indeed, as we have seen, attacks had already been made on Khurasan and Azarbaijan in 758/1357, as a result of which Tabriz remained occupied for several years. The successes of the khans JanI Beg and BerdI Beg proved ephemeral in view of the fifteen-year period of civil strife in the Golden Horde that followed their deaths, but Iran was to play a significant part in the duel between Tlmur and Tokhtami'sh

TIMUR'S EARLY CAREER
Khan and influence the actions and decisions of the two rivals over a long period, a subject that will be discussed in detail later.
TIMUR'S EARLY CAREER
First, some reference must be made, if only briefly, to Timur's origins and the early stages of his life. At roughly the same time as central power was breaking down in Il-Khanid Persia, its eastern neighbour, the ulus of Chaghatai, named after its founder, Chingiz Khan's second son, was also undergoing severe political and religious disruption. In the process the Chaghatayid empire was split up into two khanates. One of these was Mughalistan, on the river Hi in eastern Turkestan, a land ruled by Mongols in which Mongol tradition was so staunchly upheld that even Islam failed to gain a footing there. The other was Transoxiana, an area peopled by strongly Turkicised Mongols who were being converted to Islam in ever increasing numbers. They were in time given the name Qara'unas, a term originally applied only to the
Mongols of mixed race living in the Indo-Iranian border area.1 By the year 747/1346 Qara'unas amirs had replaced the Chaghatayid khans who had previously ruled the area. From now on the amirs were the defacto rulers, although each of them raised to the throne a shadow khan and exercised power in his name. These khans no longer came exclusively from the line of Chaghatai, some of them being descendants of his brother Ogedei. It was natural that the name Qara'unas should be transferred to the Chaghatai Mongols, for this people in Transoxiana had become assimilated to its original population so as to form a distinct culture. By the middle of the 8th/14th century, the process of assimilation was complete throughout Transoxiana and beyond, even as far as Slstan. Among those affected were the Barlas in the valley of the QashqaDarya, the tribe of Tlmur (Tu. temur,"iton"), whose name has been corrupted, via the Persian Tlmur-i Lang ("the lame"), into the European form Tamerlane. This, in rough outline at least, was the milieu
1 See Aubin, "L'ethnogenese", and "Le khanat de Cagatai", p. 18. Three possible meanings of the term Qara'unas have to be taken into account: (1) the mixed Mongol population originating in the Indo-Iranian border area; (2) the Turco-Mongol population of Transoxiana; and (3) the Turco-Mongol dynasty of amirs ruling in Transoxiana after the death of Qazan Khan in 1346. For the Timurid chroniclers the designation Qara'unas ("half-castes") was taboo because the Mughals came to use it as their nickname for the Chaghatais. See Barthold, Vlugh Beg, p. 11, quoting Marco Polo and MIrza Haidar Dughlat. For their part the Chaghatais called the Mughalsys/f ("robbers").

TIMUR IN IRAN
into which he was born on z 5 Sha'ban 736/8 April 13 36, in Kish (Shahr-i Sabz), where he spent his childhood and probably also his youth. Although not a wealthy man, Tlmur's father Amir Taraghai was highly regarded within the Barlas tribe. A burial inscription ascribes to the family a common ancestry with Chingiz Khan, but during his lifetime Timur never laid claim to such a relationship. Indeed, when he had come to power, he even installed puppet Chingizid khans in Samarqand: first Soyurghatmish Khan (proclaimed in 771/1370; d. 786/1384), a descendant of Ogedei, and then his son Sultan Mahmud Khan (d. 805/1402). This suggests that he felt his rule stood in need of legitimisation. He called himself Amir, claiming the title A.mir-i bu^urg, Amir al-kabir or the like, in addition to the attribute Kurgan, which derives from the Mongol kiiregen ("son-in-law"): this last was a reference to his marriage connection with the Chingizids, of which we shall speak later. In accordance with the customs of tribal life Timur learned in his youth every skill a warrior needed, especially horsemanship and archery. In addition to the Turkish language of his tribe he also acquired Persian, although he did not learn to read or write. The spread of Islam, which was making great strides in Transoxiana at that time, had also affected the Barlas tribe. Timur, who can scarcely be described as a particularly religious man, was to value the conversation of dervishes and pious shaikhs throughout his life, a habit which may perhaps be ascribed to the influence of his father's spiritual adviser, whose name is given as Shams al-Dln Kulal. Even in his early days Timur found such recognition amongst his contemporaries in the Barlas tribe that some of them aligned themselves with him more closely as liegeman (nokiit, sing, nokiir). His qualities as a leader and the success with which his various enterprises were crowned swelled the number of his followers. When considering the nature of these enterprises it must be borne in mind that in those times Transoxiana, just like Persia, was largely in a state of anarchy. They were in fact adventures typical of the circumstances of the time, warlike and predatory raids, mostly on a local scale - in other words nothing unusual in the nomadic milieu with which we are concerned. Reports of skirmishes in Slstan, where civil wars were then a common occurrence, show that Timur gradually extended his sphere of action. His involvement in this area may have had something to do with the Qara'unas or Negiideris living there. Of course, whether one chooses to regard the leader of such exploits as an ambitious tribal warrior or as
44



TIMUR S EARLY CAREER
a bandit and robber chieftain depends on one's point of view. What the court chroniclers thought of them is fairly obvious, since they pass over this phase of Timur's career in stubborn silence. Several attempts were made from Mughalistan to re-establish the unity of the former ulus of Chaghatai under Mongol rule. The murder in 759/13 5 8 of Amir Qazaghan, who in 747/1346 had founded a line of Qara'unas princes in Transoxiana, prompted Tughluq Temiir Khan to launch a campaign against the region, as a result of which the governor of Qashqa-Darya, Hajjl Barlas, took flight. Timur, also convinced that it was pointless to put up any resistance, did not flee but acknowledged the authority of the khan, who then transferred to him the governorship of Qashqa-Darya. This compact was short-lived, however, because Timur then allied himself with Amir Husain, a grandson of Amir Qazaghan who initially ruled the territory from Balkh to Kabul, but with Timur's support managed after a long struggle to reconquer the lands of his grandfather. In one of these exchanges Timur received the injuries to the right shoulder, the right hand and the right thigh which account for his nickname and traces of which were detected on his skeleton by the archaeological commission which opened up his sarcophagus in the Gur-i Mir in 1941. For the present Timur cemented the alliance with Husain by marrying one of his sisters, named Oljei Terken. Then, taking advantage of the increased social prestige this afforded him, he entered into further marriage alliances with the aristocracy of Central Asia. Yet in the long run neither the alliance, nor the fact that they were related, nor even their shared experience of danger, imprisonment, defeats and eventual victories could prevent the two princes from becoming rivals. Timurfinallylaid siege to Balkh and conquered it. Although he had granted Husain safe conduct he allowed one of the local princes to murder him in revenge for the killing of his brother ten years earlier. Thus sovereignty over Transoxiana passed to Timur. He now married Sarai Mulk Khatiin, a member of Husain's harem. She was a daughter of the Chaghatayid khan Qazan, who had ruled until 747/1346, and it was on this connection that Timur based his claim to the epithet Kurgan (son-in-law,
that is, of a member of the dynasty of Chingiz Khan).1 The events just discussed took place against a background of great social upheaval and change for the population of Transoxiana. In part
1 For the document of 804/1401 recording this, see Fekete, Einfiibrmg, pp. 7 1 - ; and plates 3-6.
45



TIMUR IN IRAN
this was due to the fact that political power passed from the hands of the Mongol khans and their adherents to Qara'unas amirs who of course had their own followers. It is known that Amir Husain ousted from their positions and estates numerous amirs and landlords, many of whom took refuge with Timur. The social consequences are particularly clear in the case of Sarbadars of Samarqand, to whom brief reference has already been made. They managed to save the city from attack by the Mongols but were subsequently destroyed by Amir Husain, apart from those who escaped to Timur or were rescued by him. Another notable factor is the change from a nomadic to a more settled way of life. An example of this is Husain's fortification of Balkh, a task he undertook despite Tlmiir's warnings. In the eyes of the nomads this was tantamount to a criminal offence, since they regarded it as a matter of principle never to settle permanently in any one place but constantly to renew their migrations. Yet the impulse to establish a permanent capital city, if not to adopt a wholly settled way of life, was so strong that even Timur succumbed to it. Once he had eliminated his rivals, he too set about fortifying and architecturally developing his capital, Samarqand.
THE CONQUEST OF EASTERN IRAN
Tlmiir's advances to the south and west are in no way linked to a population explosion or to a mass migration of peoples. They lacked the spontaneity associated with the rise of Chingiz Khan. Timur planned his campaigns against Afghanistan and the Iranian uplands with as much care as the early part of his career up to 1370 with which we have so far been concerned. Indeed, so thorough were his plans that more than a decade went by before he proceeded to put them into operation. Although he now had at his disposal the troops of his defeated rival, who had switched their allegiance to him, his forces were still not strong enough to outmanoeuvre the Qara'unas amirs, who had been watching his advancement with envy and suspicion. In order to ensure himself against surprise attacks in Transoxiana as he marched into the Near East he had either to eliminate them or to win them over to his side. To secure his position at the rear it was also necessary to subjugate Khwarazm. At this time a variety of links existed between Transoxiana and Khurasan. Following the murder of the Mongol ruler of Astarabad,
46



THE CONQUEST OF EASTERN IRAN
Togha Temiir (754/1353), there remained in eastern Persia three significant political powers. These were the realm of the Kartids of Herat, the state of the Sarbadars of Sabzavar, and the dominion of the Ja'un-i Qurban around Tus. Tlmur had to deal with all three, and in each case the issue was settled differently. With the Kartids, who lived closest to his home territories, Timur established links at an early date. Malik Mu'izz al-Din Husain (732 to 771/1331-2 to 1370), who after his victory over the Sarbadars at Zava (743/1342) had carried out various successful campaigns against the ulus of Chaghatai, took Timur into his service. He had himself proclaimed Sultan (750/1349), which was tantamount to abrogating Mongol supremacy and was a measure typical of the increasingly strong tendencies in Herat at that time towards a revival of Islam. Although married to a Chingizid princess, the daughter of Togha Temiir, the malik was not himself of Mongol descent and thus according to the law of Chingiz Khan, the Yasa, he did not qualify for sovereign rule. From his Mongol father-in-law he had nothing to fear ; it was Amir Qazaghan, exercising power in the name of a Mongol puppet khan, who moved against him and forced him to give up his independence. The alliance with Timur came to an end as a result of a predatory raid by the Kartid that impinged upon his immediate sphere of influence. After the death of his father, sovereignty over the Kartid empire passed to Ghiyas al-Din Pir 'AH, except for Sarakhs and part of Quhistan, which were the inheritance of his stepbrother Malik Muhammad. In the struggle to gain absolute power that inevitably ensued, each of the two brothers attempted to secure his position by enlisting Timur's support. The prince of Herat sent an embassy to him, and his brother even arrived in person, seeking asylum after being driven out of Sarakhs. This did not prevent Timur from proposing to Ghiyas al-Din Pir 'All that they should renew "the old ties of friendship" and indeed strengthen them by means of a marriage between one of his nieces and Ghiyas al-Din's eldest son, who for this purpose came to Samarqand. Not until two years later was he allowed to return to Herat, and then only as a result of pressure from his father. Scarcely were the marriage celebrations in Herat at an end when Ghiyas al-Din was summoned by Timur to a great council (quriltai). This summons may well suggest that Timur was beginning to doubt the loyalty of the prince of Herat, probably because of conspicuous defence works that the latter had undertaken. When Ghiyas al-Din now made all sorts of excuses to try
47



TIMUR IN IRAN
to postpone the date of his departure, Tlmur armed himself for battle and arrived with his troops outside the city in Muharram 783/April 13 81. This was the prelude to one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of Iran. There is no lack of evidence to suggest that Tlmur was well informed about the desperate political plight of Persia, the breakdown of power and the widespread internecine strife within the country. Moreover, some important figures in Iran actually wanted Tlmur to intervene. Evidence of this can be seen from a letter sent by Mu'in al-DIn JamI, the aged vizier of Mu'izz al-DIn Husain, in which Tlmur was openly invited to make his way to Khurasan. When Tlmur was nearing their city, the shaikhs of Jam, who were related to the vizier and had great political influence in the country, called upon all the dignitaries to go out and welcome the conqueror: almost without exception they did so. It is likely that Tlmur was similarly encouraged by those Khurasanian emigres and refugees who were in his camp, such as the Kartid prince of Sarakhs and Togha Temiir's son Luqman. No doubt they held hopes of being restored to power by Tlmur, hopes which, incidentally, were often fulfilled. Despite the city's strong fortifications Tlmur had no difficulty in taking Herat. Ghiyas al-DIn Pir 'All, who was by no means as skilful or capable as his father, had failed to arouse in the population the strength of will to defend the city. Tlmur showed effective command of the tactics of psychological warfare by promising to spare the lives and possessions of those who took no part in the battle. He went even further when he made the magnanimous gesture of releasing some two thousand prisoners of war. After the city had been occupied the fortifications were dismantled, although not the citadel of Ikhtiyar al-Din. A fairly large group of respected citizens, including theologians and other scholars, was deported to Shahr-i Sabz in Timur's more immediate homeland, and a high tribute was exacted from the population. Ghiyas al-DIn had no choice but to submit to the authority of his father's former liegeman and could count himself lucky to be reinstated as Timur's vassal. In 785/1383, however, his career was terminated when he was suspected of complicity in a plot hatched by members of the house of Herat. Timur's son Mlran Shah, the Chaghatayid governor, managed to nip the rebellion in the bud and annexed Herat. In 798/1396 he was to murder the other surviving Kartids at a banquet to which he had invited them. Thus ended, after 130 years, the sway of a
48



THE CONQUEST OF EASTERN IRAN
local dynasty of no little significance in the history of Iranian civilisation. In the very year he conquered Herat, Tlmur turned his attention to the west, where 'AH Beg Ja'un-i Qurbani, who had succeeded his brother as ruler of Kalat and Tiis, had ignored the summons to assist in the campaign against Herat. After a long siege Tlmur took him prisoner, sent him to Transoxiana and shortly afterwards had him killed. A sizeable contingent of the Ja'un-i Qurban was deported to Samarqand and the surrounding area, where they were later to attract
the notice of chroniclers.1. Tlmur installed one of their number, Hajjl Beg, as governor (hakim) of Tus, thus entrusting to him a Chaghatayid protectorate which he was to administer until his rebellion in the year 791/1389. It is sometimes maintained that the sovereign of the Sarbadar state of Sabzavar, Khwaja 'All-yi Mu'ayyad, suffered a fate similar to that of the ruler of the Ja'un-i Qurban. The proponents of this view would have us believe that Tlmur subjected him to his overlordship, only to dispose of him a few years later when he had outlived his usefulness. However, as Jean Aubin has recently shown, this version of events is not only inaccurate but also runs counter to the general policy pursued by Tlmur in Persia. Already, towards the Sarbadars of Samarqand, it will be recalled, Timiir had adopted a more or less friendly attitude. It is reasonable to suppose that he also established friendly contacts with the Sarbadar leader in Khurasan before embarking on his westward advance from Herat. When he arrived in the region of Nlshapur, Khwaja 'All was there to pay him homage. What he had to offer the conqueror may have been no more than a modest remnant of the once glorious Sarbadar state, but the offer suited Tlmur's plans well. His policy was not to dismantle established political structures but to make use of them whenever it was possible to do so without risk to himself. Timiir was right to anticipate possible risks in western Khurasan, as the conflicts with 'AH Beg Ja'un-i Qurbani had already shown. In addition there were the activities of Amir Vali, self-appointed guardian of the interests of the Il-Khanid prince Luqman. As we have already mentioned, Khwaja 'All-yi Mu'ayyad sought assistance from Tlmur against him when he was already close to conquering Sabzavar. Tlmur promptly relieved the pressure on the leader of the Sarbadars by
1 See Roemer, in Sams al-Husn, pp. 99ff.,quoting Shaml 11 (commentary), 46, 48, 49, 76.
49



TIMUR IN IRAN
actions against Gurgan and the possessions of Amir Vail in Mazandaran, but above all by the brutal treatment he meted out to the latter's forces and the population of Isfara'In. In Radkan, as he was returning from the campaign in Mazandaran, Tlmur confirmed the appointment of Khwaja 'All-yi Mu'ayyad as governor of Sabzavar. Khwaja 'All remained loyal to Tlmur until the end, fulfilling his military obligations towards him until 788/1386, when he died as a result of a wound sustained in battle in Lesser Luristan. His loyalty was respected by TTmiir, who did not occupy Sabzavar with a Chaghatai garrison. Khwaja 'All may have forfeited his independence, but he did retain control of the local administration and - although this did not always protect him from the encroachments of Chaghatai finance officers — even enjoyed in principle exemption from taxation. How can one reconcile this picture of events with the reported rebellion of 785/1383 in Sabzavar and the terrible retribution that followed it? The answer is quite simple. The scene of the uprising was not the capital of the Sarbadars but a place in eastern Khurasan that lay some 70 miles
south of Herat and was furthermore called Isfizar.1 Nor had the ringleader of the rebellion, Shaikh Da'iid-i Khitatal, any connection with the Sarbadars. He was a military man who, having left the service of the Kartids to join Tlmur, had been made governor of the place. The rebellion was thus the work of the petty aristocracy of the Kartid empire. The death of Khwaja 'All did not mean that his family ceased to play an active role in Tlmur's empire. The territory of the Sarbadars was divided up amongst several of his relatives, possibly in imitation of the Turkish or Mongol principle of inheritance. The army of Sabzavar and a number of Khwaja 'All's relations featured in several campaigns, usually playing a loyal part. Only Muluk Sabzavarl allowed himself to become involved in the rebellion of Hajjl Beg of Tiis, to which we have already referred. After its failure he sought refuge with the Muzaffarid Shah Mansur in Isfahan, but was eventually pardoned by Tlmur and made governor of Basra at the beginning of 796/end of 1393. When they had quelled the rebellion of Sabzavar/Isfizar, Tlmur's forces marched on Slstan. After heavy fighting they captured the capital Shahr-i Slstan, and plundered and destroyed it. They then devas
1 Aubin, "Lafinde l'etat Sarbadar", pp. io<)ff., traces the origin of the confusion to ShamI 1, 91: Barthold had already correctly equated Sabzavar with Isfizar in 1903 in Istoricheskii-geograficbeskii ob^pr Irajta (see n o w his Socbineniya v n , 84)

tated the country, destroying especially irrigation works vital to its agriculture, a factor often cited as contributing to the continuing backwardness of the region even to this day. Qandahar was to suffer a similar fate in the course of the army's return march. One other advance can be seen as part of this first phase of Tlmur's operations against Iran. Begun in 786/1384, it took him back initially to Mazandaran. The Il-Khanid prince Luqman, a son of Togha Temiir who himself had found refuge in Samarqand in his day, was appointed governor of Astarabad. This was not, however, the sole aim of the offensive. Timur advanced further, against the Jalayirid Sultan Ahmad in Azarbaljan, but failed to capture him either in this campaign or later. As a result of the latter's flight, however, Timur had little difficulty in conquering the ancient Il-Khanid capital Sultaniyya, where he halted his advance. After going into winter quarters in Ray, he returned to Samarqand. Persia was to be further subjugated in the course of Tlmur's three famous campaigns, the three-year campaign of 788-90/1386-8, the five-year campaign of 794-8/1392-6 and the so
called seven-year campaign1 which he began on 4 Sha'ban 801/11 April 1399. These will be dealt with later.
MOTIVATION AND METHODS
An account has now been given of the most important stages of the military operations by means of which Timur in the space of less than five years imposed his sovereignty on the east and south-east of Iran, i.e. Mazandaran, eastern and western Khurasan, and Slstan. Already a few typical features have emerged, a number of which were to recur in later operations against Iran. Particularly striking is the thorough preparation of each individual operation. It is obvious that all the military possibilities were carefully considered, as well as the means needed to put them into operation. Without prior reconnaissance this would certainly have been impossible. Members of Islamic orders, dervishes and itinerant monks {qalandarari) all played a part in the gathering of secret military information. For a SunnI Timur was relatively indifferent in his personal attitude to religion but he treated the champions of
1 When Tlmur died on 18 Feb. 1405, six years had elapsed since the start of the campaign and the seventh had begun only thirteen days previously, i.e. on 4 Sha'ban 807/j February. The traditional designation "Seven Year Campaign" is therefore somewhat problematical, unless perhaps it derives from some plan of Tlmur's.

TIMUR IN IRAN
the Islamic faith with obvious benevolence. Descendants of the family of the prophet Muhammad (sayyid, pi. sdddt), shaikhs, Sufis, dervishes and judges of the religious law {qudat, sing, qadt) all enjoyed his special protection. Their lives or property were never in jeopardy when he was taking terrible reprisals against a captured city. Even when tributes were being raised, when the rest of the population had to surrender money and other belongings under threat of death or were forced by torture to reveal the whereabouts of hidden valuables, they were able to move about freely in the streets and squares. On occasion, indeed, they were able with some hope of success to intercede for one or another of the victims of Timur's myrmidons. Naturally, they proved grateful for such great privileges, and Tlmur could count on many of them whenever he was in need of their help. The mobility of this class of people and the widespread organisation of their orders made them ideal agents of reconnaissance. The objects of Timur's military ventures and campaigns were various: they might be designed to eliminate a permanent military threat, as in the case of the Golden Horde; to secure political influence, as in India or Anatolia; or to impose his own power in the face of dangerous rivals in the Chaghatayid heartlands, as was the case with the struggle against the Qara'iinas amirs in Transoxiana and the subjection of Khwarazm. The invasion of Iran, however, had none of these aims. When he began his advance into Khurasan, Tlmur never contemplated annexing the territory or incorporating it into his homelands, as is quite clear from his endeavours to maintain existing political structures in being rather than destroy them. His objective was to neutralise other rulers, that is, to extend his own sphere of influence by setting up protectorates. The rulers were, of course, obliged to give up their independence and required to pay considerable sums in tribute. Although only one of the three protectorates, that of the Sarbadars of Sabzavar, lasted for any length of time, whereas the other two — the empire of the Kartids and the realm of the Ja'un-i Qurban - were liquidated soon after they had been established, this was due solely to the rebellions that occurred there after Tlmur had withdrawn. Increased political power was, however, by no means the only motive for Timur's invasion of Iran. Economic considerations must have played an equally important part. In this connection it is worth bearing in mind the economic situation in Chaghatayid Transoxiana. It was far inferior to that of Iran even after almost three decades of
52



MOTIVATION AND METHODS
confusion and civil war had, it would appear, reduced to ruins the Il-Khanid empire, which had attained a particularly high level of development thanks to the reforms of Ghazan Khan. Culturally, too, the Chaghatais were backward in comparison with the people of Iran. It would therefore be reasonable to assume that Tlmur with his pragmatic cast of mind was concerned to redress the situation in favour of his Central Asian homeland. His idea was, as far as it was possible, to transfer material goods to Transoxiana in order to lay the foundations of economic prosperity and to give his authority as ruler a fitting air of splendour. His advances into Iran may have been predatory raids, but they were carefully considered and executed in accordance with previously established plans, unlike those of nomadic peoples attracted by the material wealth of sedentary populations. From Iran and other countries, therefore, the means were to be acquired to develop Transoxiana's economy and to transform Tlmur's capital Samarqand into a splendid metropolis appropriate to so great a monarch. In fact, Timur was not content to strip the cities he conquered or occupied of their treasures and objects of value, but also seized movable property of all kinds, including riding-horses and pack animals, domestic animals, herds of cattle, weapons, provisions and supplies of consumable commodities. No less important was the acquisition of human labour-forces, prisoners who could be used as slaves, especially qualified men such as craftsmen and artisans who could be put to work to improve and develop the homelands; although theologians and scholars were also included. The description just given of the economic aspects of Tlmur's conquests conforms to the type normally found in books. It is not wrong, but it is somewhat summary and lacking in concrete information. More recent investigations have served to clarify the picture, and though they may differ as regards points of detail, what emerges most strikingly from them is Tlmur's essentially systematic and consistent approach. They provide an insight into the methods used when exacting tribute, ransom money and capital levies or confiscating property; and the extent to which such measures succeeded in individual cases can also be seen. In addition, they tell us what sort of means the army leaders used either to hold in check their soldiers' rapacity when it threatened to have an adverse effect on the superior claims of official revenue or, conversely, how they gave them free rein when the situation demanded it, i.e. when reprisals no longer worked or concessions had to be made to sustain the fighting spirit of the troops.

TIMUR IN IRAN
It was the normal military custom for troops on the march to live off the land, but the occasional mention of a requisition order suggests that they did not always go about it in an irregular manner. As far as they could be obtained, lists of businesses and tax registers were used as a basis for levying tribute. Responsibility for implementing the levies was entrusted to the tax-collectors (muhassilan) of the Supreme Divan, to whom military assistance was also made available. The first step was to seal off all but one of a city's gates, sometimes even to wall them up. At any rate they were closely guarded, with two different aims in mind: to prevent the inhabitants from escaping or removing possessions that they were required to surrender, and to stop the troops who were eager for plunder from entering the city before the appointed time. Accompanied by torturers, the tax-collectors then moved through those areas of the city that had been assigned to them, confiscating money and possessions, carrying out house searches and extracting forced confessions from inhabitants whom they suspected of concealing valuables or possessing information about the circumstances of others who were liable to pay tribute. All takings were to be delivered to specified collection centres where they were registered, loaded and dispatched under the supervision of responsible amirs. As the means of transport available for removing the confiscated possessions was often inadequate, particularly intensive searches were made for pack-animals. The ransom money {mal-i amdnt) with which a city could buy immunity from plunder was usually distributed amongst the amirs. Tlmur's efforts to persuade every city he arrived at with his forces to capitulate by negotiating a ransom sum show that economic considerations weighed heavily with him. Naturally the desire to spare his own troops was also a significant factor, but above all he was concerned to secure the expected booty or tribute which would be considerably reduced, if not totally lost, as a result of the plundering that inevitably followed any seizure by force. As a rule the soldiers were only given permission to plunder, and then on a specific signal, when the officials of the divan had completed their requisitions; although such a regulation was no longer applicable when a city had been taken by storm. Tlmur only resorted to military force when negotiations of surrender had failed, but when this happened he took extremely aggressive action, showing the city's inhabitants little or no mercy.
The economic and administrative aspect of Tlmur's conquests — a feature common to all of them, not only those in Iran — has not
54



MOTIVATION AND METHODS
received such clear recognition until now. This is probably because one's attention is all too easily distracted from such details by the descriptions of acts of cruelty and brutality found in reports. On the other hand, an economic approach to events must not be allowed to disguise the fact that bestial atrocities were commonplace. Indeed, to quote one historian, "The Great Amir regarded terror as the means of
government"1 and all the more of waging war. The most horrifying atrocities were committed in the course of reprisals ordered by Timur when his negotiators or officials sent into a city after its capitulation were attacked or killed, when a city prevented negotiations by attacking the forces besieging it, or when a conquered city subsequently rose up once more against the victors. In such cases punishment took the form of a bloodbath (qatl-i 'dmm), the slaughter of the entire population. While the menfolk were murdered, women, boys and girls were violated, but this did not necessarily mean that they escaped death. Only old people and very young children under the age of five had any chance of survival, providing they did not die of starvation later. Otherwise the inhabitants of conquered cities were considered as part of the booty, sold as slaves and deported to Transoxiana. Many of them — often one in two — died of exhaustion, starvation or disease on the way. The pyramids {minaraha) of skulls that Timur had erected outside the gates of cities punished in this manner may be regarded as direct symbols of his unbridled cruelty. The worst instance of this was in Isfahan, where in 790/1388 the population had attacked the tax-collectors. The historian Hafiz-i Abrii, renowned for the reliability of his historical accounts, records how, in the aftermath of the reprisals, he walked with a friend halfway round the periphery of the city and counted twenty-eight such towers, each consisting of roughly 1,500 heads. He also mentions similar towers on the other side of Isfahan, though not so many. Figures mentioned in the sources of 70,000 heads taken by Timur's troops from the bodies of slain inhabitants of Isfahan may not, therefore, exceed the bounds of possibility. Timur may have taken as his model the massacres carried out by the Mongols during their conquest of the Middle and Near East, but nothing they did equalled this degree of inhumanity. Nor could they rival in ingenuity the act of bestiality perpetrated in Sabzavar/Isfizar after the suppression of the above-mentioned uprising.

Two thousand prisoners were heaped up in a living mound, which was
then walled in with clay and fragments of brick.1 The conquest of a particular area could also be followed by resettle
ment operations on a fairly large scale.2 Their significance is not always easy to determine, but as a rule they were probably carried out for reasons of security. This was the case with the group of the Ja'un-i Qurban whose deportation has already been mentioned, and perhaps also with the Qara Tatar who were moved from Amasya and Qaisariyya
to Central Asia in 806/140 3.3 The principles by which Tlmur proceeded in his conquest of Iran were scarcely ever so rigid as not to admit of exceptions. From time to time even a city in revolt, like Yazd in 798/1396, was able to benefit from his flexibility. Timur gave orders that it was neither to be plundered nor held to ransom, and it was even spared the biennial tax normally imposed in such cases. On the other hand, thousands of the city's inhabitants had already starved to death during the siege that led to its eventual capitulation. Yazd was a centre of textile manufacture, and it may be that Tlmur dealt with the city relatively leniently because he was concerned about a possible demise of the local industry. A bloodbath of the kind suffered by quite a number of cities could reduce them to a state of almost total depopulation and economic collapse. Nevertheless, the majority were able to recover after some time. That this was so is probably due to the fact that even when the collective murder of a population was involved Tlmur imposed certain limits on the use of arbitrary violence and ensured that these limits were observed. As we have already noted, sayyids, shaikhs, qadls and other members of the religious classes could be granted protection against murder and pillage. We have also encountered one example of a city where the dignitaries were given exceptional treatment, namely Herat in 783/1381. In fact, the leading members of a city's aristocracy or "the rich", as they were sometimes called, were generally spared, together with their relatives and servants: it was not unknown for Timur to

Returning from his campaign against Bayezld in the spring of 806/1404, Tlmur is said to have handed them over to the Safavid leader Khwaja 'All in Ardabil at the latter's request (Hinz, lrans Aufstieg, pp. 1 jff.): on the authenticity of this meeting, see Horst, "Timur und Hoga 'All, " pp. 25, 38; also below, pp. 80, 205-6.

THE GOLDEN HORDE
protect this section of society from the fate suffered by the remainder of the population by ordering a military cordon to be thrown around the closed districts in which they lived. No direct comparison can be made between the planning of Tlmur's advances into Iran and that of his other military enterprises, such as his campaigns against the Golden Horde, India and Anatolia. This is apparent even from the earliest of his operations which we have so far discussed. The subjugation of the Kartids of Herat, the removal of the Ja'un-i Qurban and the partnership with the Sarbadars of Sabzavar were not simply conceived as predatory raids, whatever gains they brought in terms of booty. Nor was there any intention, at least from the outset, to annex these territories. Tlmur aimed rather at eliminating or, more precisely, at neutralising these hitherto more or less independent political entities by turning them into Chaghatai protectorates. His first raids on Slstan, Gurgan and Mazandaran may be regarded as flanking manoeuvres to secure the principal territories of Khurasan. The conquest of eastern Persia owed its success, as we have shown, to several carefully planned operations. There were good reasons for proceeding in so calculated a manner. Tlmur had to tread cautiously because the internal situation in Transoxiana was only gradually returning to stability and because he saw danger threatening from his neighbours, the White Horde and the Golden Horde to the north, and the Mughals from the region of the river Hi in the north-east.
THE GOLDEN HORDE
The offensive of 786/13 84 against Sultaniyya in itself makes it clear that Timur's conquests in eastern Persia were not designed merely to establish a glacis for his Chaghatayid empire, but were the beginning of a campaign to subjugate Persia as a whole. In this connection a brief consideration of the political situation in Central Asia is necessary, and in particular of TTmur's relations with Tokhtami'sh. The latter, after clashing with Qipchaq princes, had sought refuge with Tlmur, who gladly welcomed him, not so much out of respect for his Chingizid descent, if he had such respect at all, but because he recognised the opportunity this offered to weaken the position of his northern neighbours, the White Horde and possibly also the Golden Horde. The campaigns Tokhtamish fought in Tlmur's service all ended in defeat, but eventually he gained dominion over the White Horde and even
57



TIMUR IN IRAN
over the Golden Horde. From then on his actions were quite the opposite of what Tlmur had expected from him. He strove to make his territory a major power, first by invading Russia and plundering and destroying Moscow, then by pursuing ambitions in Transoxiana and Iran which led to attacks across the Jaxartes in the east and over the Caucasus in the west. Although there are coins of Tokhtami'sh that were minted in Khwarazm in 785/1383, it is not clear whether it was his incursion into this area that prompted Tlmur to return to Samarqand from his first campaign to Azarbaljan, instead of pursuing the Jalayirid Sultan Ahmad, who had retreated from Sultaniyya to Tabriz. On the other hand, all the evidence indicates that Tokhtami'sh kept a careful eye on Timur's movements in Persia and began making preparations for an attack on Tabriz on receiving news of his return to Central Asia. After advancing via Darband, his troops captured and plundered the city in the winter of 787/1385—6. At the outset of the three-year campaign the Chaghatai forces aimed initially for the Jaxartes, a line of attack which might lead one to conclude that Tlmur had in mind a show of force against Tokhtami'sh. There is, however, greater reason to believe that it was a diversion designed to cover up Timur's real objectives, which were central and western Persia together with the invasion routes leading there from Qi'pchaq. In fact his forces first went into action against the Lurs, on the pretext that they had been ambushing caravans of pilgrims bound for Mecca. But it is more likely that the slaughter TTmur inflicted upon them was designed to make secure the route to Mesopotamia because of its possible strategic importance in the struggle against Sultan Ahmad Jalayir. To suppress him was, after all, clearly one of the principal objectives of Timur's campaign. Soon after the withdrawal of the Qi'pchaq forces, Sultan Ahmad had recovered control of the city of Tabriz, and Tlmur lost no time in marching there once the operation in Luristan had been completed. He had no difficulty in capturing the city in the summer of 788/1386, but the Jalayirid, whose army and resources had been seriously weakened by Tokhtami'sh's attack, had again managed to evade him by taking flight. The inhabitants of Tabriz, still quite prosperous through their trading connections, were forced to pay a heavy tribute, and scholars, artists and craftsmen were deported to Samarqand. The Chaghatai court remained in residence in Tabriz throughout the summer, and the rulers of the surrounding territories came to pay homage. Amir Vail, who as Sultan Ahmad's city comman

THE END OF THE MUZAFFARIDS
dant in Tabriz had been swept away by Tokhtami'sh's forces, led a rebellion in Mazandaran, but it was put down, and the ringleaders were captured and executed. A nephew of TTmur, Muhammad Sultan, was eventually made governor, and the Chaghatai troops moved on. They now began a campaign against Georgia, the first of six invasions whose object was not only to subjugate and exploit the local population but also to cut off the approach routes normally used by the armies of the Golden Horde for their attacks on the Iranian uplands. As a result of these operations, the territory of Georgia was devastated and depopulated. The Georgians, a Christian people, were usually more than capable warriors, but they proved no match for the ferocious Chaghatais. The city of Tiflis, which was difficult to capture and tenaciously defended, was taken by storm in the very first campaign. King Bagrat V was imprisoned together with his wife Anna Comnena, a princess of Trebizond. Only by accepting Islam was he able to save his life, but subsequently he apostatised and as a result his country suffered further calamities. In the winter the Qi'pchaq forces again advanced through Darband to attack Persia. They were defeated by MIran Shah, who then went with his prisoners to Qarabagh, an Armenian territory where Timur had set up his winter quarters. Against all expectations and contrary to his usual practice, Tlmur treated the prisoners leniently. He set them free with no more than a warning, thus clearly making one last effort to convince Tokhtamish that he still enjoyed the goodwill of his former protector and at the same time discouraging him from further hostilities.
THE END OF THE MUZAFFARIDS
Reference was made in the previous chapter to the official dispatch that Shah-i Shuja' issued shortly before his death, in which he sought to
commend to Tlrriur's favour the members of his dynasty1. Timur's mistrust of foreign rulers and the intrigues by individual relatives of the recently deceased Muzaffarid prince made him unwilling to take this document at face value. After the struggles in Armenia and Georgia he might have been expected to continue the pursuit of Sultan Ahmad Jalayir into Mesopotamia, but he chose first to establish order and stability in those territories of central Persia as yet not touched upon in his campaigns. A letter was dispatched to Zain al-'Abidln 'All,
1 See above, p. 16.

TIMUR IN IRAN
the son and successor of Shah-i Shuja', reminding him of the latter's declaration of loyalty. As this had no effect, TTmur marched on Isfahan, whose governor, Muzaffar-i Kashl, surrendered the keys to him. The citizens would probably have suffered no more than the tribute imposed upon them, harsh though it was, had not a rebellion against the Chaghatai tax gatherers aroused Tlmur's wrath and resulted in the slaughter ofthe population as was described above. On Tlmur's approach, Zain al-'Abidin fled from his capital Shlraz, intending to go to Baghdad. Near Shushtar he encountered his cousin Shah Mansur, who treated him kindly at first but subsequently had him taken prisoner and thrown into gaol. In the circumstances Shlraz easily fell prey to the Chaghatai troops. Along with 'Imad al-DIn Ahmad and other Muzaffarid princes and local rulers, Shah Mansur then came to Tlmur's court in the city to pay homage to the conqueror. As before, Timur resorted in this instance to his old practice of reinstating the members of previously ruling families as governors in his service or allowing them to continue in office. Such a course of action was particularly advisable in this case, as reports of incursions by Tokhtamish called for his immediate return to Transoxiana. He entrusted the administration of Shlraz to Nusrat al-DIn Shah Yahya, a nephew of Shah-i Shuja'. It was obvious that Tlmur's successes in Transoxiana and Persia, the bloodbath of Isfahan and the plundering of Shlraz had all failed to teach the Muzaffarids a lesson, for they resumed their old feuds as soon as he had departed. Shah Mansur, a particularly enterprising prince, set about re-establishing the old sphere of influence of the MuzafFarids. He first gained control of Shlraz, forcing Shah Yahya to flee to Yazd. Then he captured Abarquh, but his attempts to conquer Isfahan met with less success and he returned to Shlraz. Meanwhile Zain al-'Abidin had escaped from prison and proceeded to Isfahan, where the inhabitants gave him a warm welcome. His cousin Shah Yahya tried to form an alliance with him and Sultan Ahmad, the ruler of Kirman, against Shah Mansur. Negotiations took place in Safar 793 (began on 8
January 1391) in Slrjan,1 at the home of the local ruler, a Muzaffarid by the name of Abu Ishaq. The common front agreed upon against Shah Mansur, however, was soon to crumble. When they were met by the latter's troops near Furg on the border of Kirman, Shah Yahya's

THE END OF THE MUZAFFARIDS
forces were not on the spot, and Sultan Ahmad retreated in the direction of Nairlz, accompanied by his son Ghiyas. He eventually joined battle at Fasa, but lost the day and fled to Kirman. Zain al-'Abidln for his part repaired to Isfahan, pursued by Shah Mansur. When he attempted to slip away into Khurasan he was captured in Ray by the local ruler Musa Jaukar and handed over to Shah Mansur, who had him blinded and imprisoned in Qal'a-yi Safid. The following year Shah Mansur devastated the city of Yazd and its hinterland. He then appeared before the gates of Kirman and tried to persuade Sultan Ahmad and Shah Yahya, who had sought refuge there, to join him in an alliance against Timur. When his efforts failed, he clearly recognised that he was in no position to capture the city, for he returned to Shlraz, probably with the intention of strengthening his forces. At all events, he renewed his attacks on Yazd and Kirman soon afterwards, though again without success except in terms of pillage and destruction. He failed to take Kirman, so it is said, because a number of his officers defected to Sultan Ahmad. Such was the state of affairs in Fars, in 'Iraq-i 'Ajam and in Kirman when Timur left Transoxiana on 14 Dhu'l-Qa'da 794/3 October 1392 to begin his new five-year campaign against Iran. In the interim he had been involved in conflicts with the powers that had invaded Iran during his absence, and with those who had aided and abetted them, i.e. the khans of the Golden Horde, the khans of Mughalistan and the ruler of Khwarazm. Since these campaigns are only indirectly connected with the history of Iran, a few brief references to them will suffice for our purposes. By now respect for Tlmur's military genius had grown to such an extent that the mere news of his approach was sufficient to scatter the troops of his enemies, who were wreaking havoc in Transoxiana. But he was not content to let matters rest there. He launched a campaign against Khwarazm, plundering and destroying Urgench, the country's flourishing capital, and emptying it of its inhabitants, who were abducted as slaves. This raid meant the end of the local Sufi dynasty, whose last representative, Sulaiman Sufi, sought refuge with the Golden Horde. After two campaigns against Mughalistan, where sovereignty had passed to Khizr Khan, Timur then prepared to strike against Tokhtami'sh. At the head of powerful forces he marched to Qi'pchaq and inflicted a heavy defeat on his former protege by the river Qundurcha, to the north of the city of Samara (15 Rajab 793/18 June 1391). Even though Tokhtami'sh had
61



TIMUR IN IRAN
suffered heavy losses and was forced to flee, the foundations of his power had by no means been destroyed, as events were soon to show. A new khan was installed by the grace of Timur, but this measure was of no lasting consequence because the Chaghatai troops soon withdrew once more. Nevertheless Timur was able to march to the west again in the following year without having to worry about the situation in Samarqand and Transoxiana, his departure having been delayed only by a serious illness. If the account in Yazdl's Zafar-nama can be relied upon, Tlmur's route took him through Gurgan and Mazandaran. The "heretical Sayyids", of whom he killed many in this area, may have been adherents of the HurufI sect. Its founder Fazl-Allah Abu'1-Fazl, whom Tlmur's son Miran Shah executed with his own hands in Dhu'l-Qa'da 796 (began 6 November 1393) at the fortress of Ali'njaq near Nakhchi
van, was a native of Astarabad and had many followers in the region.1 However, this was probably no more than a minor action. Tlmur's advance was aimed principally against the Muzaffarids or, to be more precise, against the one particularly active representative of the family, Shah Mansur. Even though it meant conflict with his own relatives, the latter was doing everything in his power to re-establish the political dominance of his dynasty, and this in open opposition to Timur. When he received the news of Tlmur's departure from Samarqand, of his activities in Mazandaran and of his further advance, begun in Safar 795/at the end of December 1392, via Damghan, Ray, Kurdistan and Burujird, Shah Mansur resolved initially to make Isfahan his defensive base. However, he was persuaded to drop this plan by the Sarbadar Muluk, who had switched his allegiance to him, and instead remained in Shiraz. He dispatched Muluk to Kashan as commandant (ddrugba) of the city, with the task of protecting the northern frontier of the Muzaffarid territory and of keeping him informed of the movements of the Chaghatai forces. By Rabf II 795/the beginning of March 1393 Timur had advanced to Dizful and Shushtar, where he installed the Sarbadar Khwaja Mas'ud as governor. On the way he freed prince Zain al-'Abidln from imprisonment in Qal'a-yi Safld, treated him kindly and promised to exact vengeance from Shah Mansur on his behalf. At the approach of the Chaghatais Shah Mansur had first left Shiraz, but thinking better of it he turned back to face Timur and

THE END OF THE MUZAFFARIDS
fought with great personal courage at the head of a feeble contingent whose numbers were further decreased by desertions. Wounded several times, he finally attempted to fight his way through to Shlraz but was captured by prince Shah Rukh's forces and decapitated. This conflict was also of vital concern to the other princes of the house of Muzaffar, and its outcome served to convince them of the futility of all further resistance. Arriving to announce their submission to Tlmur, they were given an honourable reception, but on 10 Rajab 795/22 May 1393 in Qumisha, to the south of Isfahan, a supreme order was issued for their execution. So ended the rule of the Muzaffarids. Only Zain al-'Abidln and Sultan Shibll, the eldest and the youngest sons of Shah-i Shuja', were spared and sent to Samarqand. For an insight into conditions in general in Iran during the eighty years (713—95/1313—93) in which the Muzaffarids were politically active we have already had recourse to the testimony of Hafiz (d.791/1389 or 792/1390), whom many literary experts consider the greatest poet in the Persian language. His divan provides outstanding evidence of the cultural and intellectual situation at the time. It is significant both as a poetic masterpiece and as a rich source for the history of ideas, not least because of the style in which it is written, a subtle interplay of normal sense usage and mystical hidden meaning. Although the divan contains verses that are cheerful in mood, it does not of course follow that the circumstances of its author and his contemporaries were happy ones. On the contrary, the vein of melancholy which again and again predominates in the work carries rather more conviction. It is a reflection of the sceptical and often pessimistic attitude to life that was widespread amongst the people of Iran as a result of numerous national catastrophes, foreign domination, despotism and tyranny, typified especially by the beginning and end of the Mongol empire. Strangely enough, these conditions of existence, however wretched and miserable they may have been, did not inhibit the development of strong cultural energies in the country, as has been indicated in the previous chapter. We have mentioned Shah-i Shuja"s patronage of Hafiz, but this was not an isolated example. Even a prince like Shah Mansiir took an interest in literature and promoted the Khwaja. Mubariz al-DIn Muhammad, too, though his interest was more narrowly religious, encouraged certain intellectual disciplines, as can be seen from his generous patronage of 'Azud al-DIn al-Iji (d.756/

TIMUR IN IRAN
1355), the distinguished Shafi'I jurist and Ash'ari theologian.1 When the latter was in Isfahan, Shah-i Shuja' took the opportunity of studying under his guidance the commentary of Ibn Hajib (d.626/1229) on al-Mufassal fi'l-Nahw, a study of Arabic grammar by al-Zamakhshari
(d. 5 38/1144).2 Finally, one could point to the example of Shaikh Majd al-Dln Isma'il, whose reputation for scholarship prompted the famous
traveller Ibn Battuta (d.780/1378) to visit Shlraz.3 The Muzaffarids may have failed to rescue Persia from the chaos of civil wars and disruption that followed the collapse of the Il-Khanid empire: indeed their fratricidal warring brought untold disaster to countless inhabitants of the country and facilitated its almost effortless conquest by Timur. Yet they managed reasonably well to maintain a minimum of public order and security, thus making possible cultural achievements such as we have just mentioned, achievements that are of greater significance in the history of Iran than the Muzaffarid rulers themselves.
THE CONQUEST OF THE JALAYIRIDS
Tlmur's only adversary in Persia after the defeat of the Muzaffarids was Sultan Ahmad Jalayir, whose sphere of influence stretched from Azarbaljan into Mesopotamia as far as Baghdad. Normally his summer residence, Baghdad had served him as a refuge from the Chaghatais ever since he had taken flight during Tlmur's first advance on Sultaniyya. Hoping to surprise him by attacking in the hottest part of summer, Timur took only eight days to march at the head of his advance guard from Fars to Mesopotamia and arrived at the gates of Baghdad on 30 Shawwal 795/29 August 1393. He caught his opponent unawares but failed to defeat him, for although Sultan Ahmad had no time to prepare for the defence of Baghdad he did manage to withdraw to the west bank of the Tigris, taking with him what ships he could and scuppering the rest, as well as destroying all the bridges. To no avail, for Timur wasted no time on the fortifications of the city, which at this period stood only on the east bank; nor did he halt at the Tigris. Showing great foresight, he had equipped his troops with planks and

THE CONQUEST OF THE JALAYIRIDS
beams by means of which they were able to cross the river both above and below the city. Nevertheless, they arrived too late. Sultan Ahmad narrowly escaped them, just as he did later when his pursuers came within a hair's breadth of capturing him near Karbala. He fled to Syria, where his request for asylum was granted by the ruler of the Mamluk empire, Sultan Barquq (784—801/1382—1399). Tlmiir occupied Baghdad without a fight. Several writers, including
two eye-witnesses,1 have left detailed accounts of the Chaghatai troops' behaviour in Mesopotamia, and we also have data on specific outrages and atrocities they committed. Yet it would appear that the population of Baghdad itself, in so far as they remained within the city walls, were treated relatively leniently, albeit at the price of a high ransom that was extorted from them. Plunder and confiscation were succeeded by dearth and famine when Tlmur marched away again some two months later. On this occasion too, scholars and artists were deported, including the masters of the renowned Baghdad school of book illumination, who had enjoyed the protection of Sultan Ahmad. Tlmur also had captives, both male and female, taken away to be sold as slaves. The governorship of Baghdad was conferred upon Khwaja Mas'ud Sabzavarl, a nephew of Khwaja 'All-yi Mu'ayyad, the last Sarbadar prince of Sabzavar. His force of Sarbadars, however, though 3,000 strong, was not sufficient to defend the city when Sultan Ahmad marched back again a year later. Instead of giving battle, Khwaja Mas'ud withdrew his troops from Baghdad to Shushtar. Sultan Ahmad was thus able to re-establish his control over Baghdad. As if nothing had happened, he proceeded to live in the same unrestrained fashion as before, thus giving many a leading figure in his entourage cause to criticise him. In 800/1397—8 this discontent found expression in a conspiracy, and although he triumphed over the conspirators Sultan Ahmad no longer felt secure. Secretly leaving the city, he sought assistance from the Qara Quyunlu chief Qara Yusuf, but when the latter's Turkmen cavalry arrived in the outskirts he had a hard task preventing them from occupying and — almost inevitably — plundering the city. Eventually, however, he persuaded them to turn back. Despite the air of nonchalance he usually displayed, Sultan Ahmad was well aware of the danger of his position. Even though an attempt by Miran

Shah to advance against him from Tabriz in the summer of 800/1398 had to be abandoned, it provided, along with other signs, clear evidence of a recurring Chaghatai interest in Mesopotamia. Two years later, when news reached him of TTmur's presence in Anatolia, he left Baghdad. Subsequently, when Timur was occupied in Syria, he returned for a short while and handed over command of the city to Amir Faraj, one of his army leaders, before taking refuge himself with the Ottomans. Sultan Ahmad's fear that a new Chaghatai advance against Baghdad was in the offing proved well grounded. After his numerous military successes, to which we shall return later, TTmur must have been especially irritated by the thought that the Jalayirid prince remained undefeated. In addition, of course, Baghdad was still an important centre of trade and communications. It was also strategically significant as a possible base for campaigns directed against the rear or the flank of those of his units active in Anatolia or Syria, and thus constituted a threat to the very operations that occupied his mind at this time. The disaster Sultan Ahmad had anticipated soon occurred. It befell Baghdad in May 1401, when a Chaghatai division Timur had sent out from Mosul to exact tribute met with vigorous resistance outside the city from Turkmen units and bands of bedouins called to the scene by Amir Faraj. Even when Timur's troops received reinforcements the resistance did not slacken, for the commandant of the city clearly had no idea that he was dealing with Timur himself. As it was, the latter had arrived in person at the head of comparatively small forces, leaving behind the main body of his troops in the Kurdish mountains in view of the summer heat. There they had the benefit not only of a better climate but also of rich grazing grounds. Although all Baghdad's supplies were exhausted in a siege that lasted forty days, Timur's hopes of a bloodless surrender were disappointed. As a result, when the city was taken by storm on 27 Dhu'l-Qa'da 803/9 July 1401, he ordered a ruthless massacre of the population from which not even women and children were exempted. The only people whose lives were spared were theologians, shaikhs and dervishes. The city's fortifications were then demolished and its public buildings, including some from the 'Abbasid period, destroyed; the only exceptions were mosques, universities and hostels. By all accounts the depopulation and destruction of the city were carried to such lengths that TTmur had no need to instal a governor. Despite all

THE CONQUEST OF THE JALAYIRIDS
this Sultan Ahmad returned to Baghdad soon afterwards and set about rebuilding the city. In the middle of winter he had another narrow escape when a Chaghatai raiding party advancing from Kurdistan caught him unawares. Nevertheless he arrived back in his city again a few months later, this time accompanied by Qara Yusuf. The friendship between the two princes was not to last long. When they quarrelled, Sultan Ahmad was expelled by the Turkmen leader. Any hopes he entertained of being kindly received and granted asylum by the Mamluks a second time proved illusory. Sultan Faraj (801-815/1399-1412), who in the meantime had succeeded his father Barquq on the Egyptian throne, imprisoned the Jalayirid in a stronghold because he feared Timur's vengeance. Here Sultan Ahmad was to meet up again a short time later with Qara Yusuf, who in the autumn of 806/1403 was driven out of Baghdad by Aba Bakr, a grandson of Tlmur, and similarly sought refuge with the Mamluks. In prison the two of them formed a new alliance, but despite all guarantees it proved shortlived when they regained their liberty some time later. Qara Yusuf moved to Tabriz, whilst Sultan Ahmad returned to Baghdad and again assumed power. He retained it for five difficult years before Qara Yusuf defeated him in battle, took him prisoner and executed him. The victor handed over Baghdad to his son Shah Muhammad Qara Quyunlu, who conquered the city on 5 Muharram 814/29 April 1411. Thus began the Turkmen phase of the city's history. Elsewhere, notably in Khuzistan, Jalayirid rulers managed to retain power until as
late as 835/1432.l Apart from the Sarbadars, who won Timur's favour by promptly establishing good relations with him and continuing to serve him loyally, the Jalayirids were the only political force of any importance on Persian soil that survived the conqueror, though not by many years. The price Sultan Ahmad had to pay for his survival was not only unsettled and precarious, but also depended on an uncertain alliance with his rivals, the Qara Quyunlu. This alliance was bound to end in a trial of strength, and when it finally came he proved no match for them
1 Ouda, "Buchmalerei", p. 32, lists (following Shirln Bayan!) the remaining Jalayirids: Sultan Valad (813-14/1410-11); Sultan Uvais II (814-24/1411-21); Sultan Mahmud (824-8/1421-4); and Sultan Husain II (828-36/1424-32). Of these the first three were sons of Sultan Ahmad, and Husain his grandson. In Yinanc, "Celayir", the successor of Uvais is named as Muhammad, and it is alleged that Valad's widow Tandu Khatun bint Jalal al-DIn Husain (previously married to the Egyptian Sultan Barquq) paid homage to the Timurid Shah Rukh and ruled over Wasit, Basra and Shushtar until her death in 819/1416.

either in Tabriz or in Baghdad. Sultan Ahmad's survival also entailed the sacrifice of a considerable cultural inheritance. His family had made Tabriz and more particularly Baghdad into important cultural centres, and in both cities a miniaturist school of the highest rank was crippled, if not entirely destroyed, when Tlmur carried off the best painters to Central Asia. Scholars and other representatives of intellectual, religious and artistic life were also deported. In the nine years that remained to him after 803/1401, Sultan Ahmad was quite incapable of repairing the damage caused by this drain on his cultural resources, even though he did everything in his power to try to restore Baghdad. In terms of his character and role, about which we have considerable detailed evidence, the Jalayirid prince was probably a typicalfigurenot only of his dynasty but of his times in general, for he was a man of startling contrasts. He was both a patron of the arts and a practising artist in his own right : none other than the famous 'Abd al-Haiy taught him drawing. He was a miniaturist, a skilled calligrapher, well versed in music, and a poet whose Arabic and Persian verses were collected in a divan. On the other hand he is described as cruelly despotic, fratricidal, disloyal and avaricious. Others depict him as a courageous warrior, in spite of his tactical retreats in conflicts with Tlmur and his generals, and also as a protector of scholars and poets. We have already mentioned the court poet Jamal al-Dln Salman Savajl (b. c.700/1300, d. 778/1376), who was highly esteemed by Sultan Ahmad's father, Shaikh Uvais. Primarily a panegyrist, he was also a master of the romantic epic and of lyric poetry. A measure of the respect he enjoyed is the quatrain, ascribed to Hafiz, in which he is praised as "chief among the cultured men of the age" {sar-amad-i fu^ald-ji %amdnd). One unusual feature of his poetry is that he takes real events as his subject matter - a rare phenomenon in the classical literature of Iran. This is true of his Firaq-nama ("Book of Separation"), in which he describes Shaikh Uvais's pain at the loss of one of his favourites, first when he disappears from the court, then when he is
away on a military campaign, and finally when he dies unexpectedly.1 Salman is mentioned here as just one example of the many poets,

THE INDIAN CAMPAIGN
famous and less well known, who lived under the Jalayirids and were patronised by them. With their liking for ostentation at court, it was also natural that several of the Jalayirids should distinguish themselves as builders, but many of the architectural achievements for which they were renowned have been destroyed. One of the buildings of Khwaja Mirjan, who was the Jalayirid governor of Baghdad on more than one occasion, has survived, however. It is the Islamic university (madrasd) in Baghdad,
which was later named Jami'-i Mirjan.1 The Spanish ambassador Clavijo, usually a reliable observer, records having seen a palace of gigantic proportions in 804/1401 in Tabriz which was called Daulatkhana and had been erected by Uvais. His observations could well be based on fact. Lastly, Sultan Ahmad's repeated efforts to improve or restore the architecture of Baghdad are emphasised in many sources. The most impressive legacy of the Jalayirids is their painting. Examples of miniatures from Tabriz and Baghdad that have been preserved derive for the most part from the Sultans Uvais, Husain and Ahmad. The Jalayirid schools suffered greatly as a result of the deportations ordered by TImur, but the Baghdad school at least survived the first conquest of 795/1393 and did not finally come to an end until the second in 803/1401. This is demonstrated by works of art produced during the intervening period. The cultural and intellectual achievements of the Jalayirids, particularly the complex and controversial subject of iconography, its genesis and styles, will be considered in more detail in later chapters. Here we have been content to give a general sketch of the world that TImur destroyed in his efforts to eliminate the political and military power of the dynasty. Although Sultan Ahmad personally succeeded in eluding Tlmur's grasp, the blows he suffered sapped the vitality of his empire. Each military defeat drained away more of its cultural and intellectual energies until by the time of the conflicts with the Tiirkmens it had exhausted all its strength, and neither Sultan Ahmad nor his successors could bring about its regeneration.
THE INDIAN CAMPAIGN
For the history of Iran the most important outcome of the five-year campaign was that the country became an integral part of Tlmur's

sphere of influence. Opponents such as Sultan Ahmad Jalayir, the Turkmen Qara Yiisuf Qara Quyunlu, or individual Georgian princes who managed to elude the grasp of the Chaghatais, constituted at most a latent threat. In practice they were reduced to living as best they could either as exiles abroad or in border areas of Iran to which access was difficult. Yet Timur by no means underestimated the possibility of trouble from them. Contemplating as he did further conquests, he had to guard against all eventualities in his rear. His plans did not stop at the destruction of the military power of the Qipchaqs. For Mongol supremacy to be restored, as he envisaged, he would need to subjugate India and China too, not to mention areas of the Near East outside Persia. His grandson, Pir Muhammad b. Jahanglr, who since 794/1392 had occupied the "throne of Mahmud of Ghazna" and had the closest knowledge of Indian affairs, was ordered to march against the Punjab in the autumn of 800/1397. This was the prelude to Tlmur's Indian campaign of the next two years, culminating in the sack of Delhi in 801/i 398. No political reasons for the expedition are mentioned in the sources. Since it was directed not solely against non-Muslim princes but also, indeed primarily, against Muslim rulers, the view that the campaign was motivated by a desire to spread Islam cannot be accepted without qualification. The weakness of the Indian princes and the fact that they were in conflict with one another may well have prompted Tlmur's decision to attack, for booty and the payment of tribute seem to have been his principal aim. As a consequence the Indian territories affected suffered devastation and slaughter on an unimaginable scale, together with disease and famine, as one can see from Ghiyas al-Din 'All's record of the expedition.
THE FINAL CONFLICT WITH TOKHTAMISH
Our summary of the fortunes of the later Jalayirids has taken us well beyond the period of Tlmur's five-year campaign (794-798/13921396). The time has now come to pick up the thread of events following Timur's departure from Baghdad in the late autumn of 795/1393, events which took place not in Iran itself but in border areas and neighbouring countries. In what follows they will be considered in more or less detail depending on the extent to which they affected Persian history. When Timur moved on up the Tigris after conquering Baghdad, it

THE FINAL CONFLICT WITH TOKHTAMISH
was not clear what his next military objective would be. Syria, Egypt, western or eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus were all possible targets, and the news of Tlmur's military successes as well as his brutal methods of waging war not only perturbed the rulers of these territories but also struck fear into the hearts of their populations. Nor was the situation eased when the conqueror sent envoys to numerous princes and rulers, inviting them to establish friendly relations or demanding that they should submit to his sovereignty, as was the case with Sultan Barquq of Cairo, who had granted asylum to Sultan Ahmad Jalayir, and with Ahmad's Turkmen ally, Qara Yusuf of the Qara Quyiinlu confederation. One other act of Tlmur was probably designed to strike terror in the hearts of his rivals. This was the spectacular feat of capturing the fortress of Takrlt on the Tigris, which had been considered impregnable. Its commandant and garrison were slaughtered, and pyramids of skulls were erected for all to see. After the capture Tlmur held a military parade on the west bank of the Tigris to demonstrate to the world the strength of the Chaghatai forces. Such demonstrations had their effect, though not in the way Tlmur had desired. They resulted in intensive diplomatic exchanges on the part of his adversaries. The ruler of Sivas informed Barquq of his fears and asked him for support. The Ottoman Sultan Bayezld made contact with the Egyptian ruler and sent him subsidies. Tokhtamish and Barquq also entered into an alliance, which was of particular significance since it showed that Tlmur's campaign against Qi'pchaq in 793/1391 had failed to neutralise or at any rate intimidate the khan of the Golden Horde. Nevertheless, Tlmur now delayed, in fact for a whole year, before deciding on his next major blow. In the meantime he turned his attention to operations on a geographically limited scale. As well as the Artuqids in Mardin, he again attacked the Georgians. This was the prelude to later offensives against their territory, that of 1395 under the command of Mlran Shah and those of 1399 and 1403 which Tlmur was again to lead himself. Qara Yusuf and his Qara Quyiinlu, at this time Tlmur's most dangerous enemy south of the Caucasus, were also engaged in battle. They lost the fortress of Avnik on the Araxes, and its commandant, a brother of Qara Yusuf called Misr Khwaja, was taken captive and sent to Samarqand together with his family. Events of importance on the personal level at this time were the birth of Ulugh Beg, a son of Shah Rukh who was to become Tlmur's favourite grand

son, and the death of the conqueror's oldest surviving son, 'Umar Shaikh, which must have come as a severe blow. Summoned to the court from Fars, where he was governor, he was fatally wounded by an enemy arrow while besieging a Kurdish stronghold en route. A letter of 8 Jumada I 797/1 March 13951 shows that Tlmur made one last effort to effect a reconciliation with Tokhtami'sh. Even though it failed, it provides further evidence of his concern to remain loyal to the descendants of Chingiz Khan. Another communication, addressed
to the Ottoman sovereign,2 indicates that at this time - and perhaps even earlier - Tlmur was contemplating something quite different. This was an expansionist policy on a grand scale, stretching as far as eastern Europe. As his starting point, Tlmur took the old division of the ulus of Jochi into two parts, i.e. the area east of the river Dnieper as the left flank (sol qol), the empire of the Golden Horde, and the territories west of the Dnieper as the right flank (prj qol), together with the Ukraine, the lands of the Lithuanians and Poles, who were the allies of Tokhtami'sh. In his letter Tlmur praised Bayezld's achievements in the holy war (jihad) against the Christian princes in the Balkans and suggested that they should establish mutual spheres of interest. The right flank, that is the area extending west of the Dnieper to the Balkans, was to be allotted to Bayezld, the left flank or all territory to the east of the Dnieper to Tlmuf. The letter also reveals that two of the basic principles behind Tlmur's global political strategy were the spread of Islam throughout the world and the restoration of the world
wide supremacy of the Mongols. If, as Togan assumes,3 Tlmur's new campaign against Tokhtamish was designed not merely to punish a disloyal ally, but "to put into effect a comprehensive plan for eastern Europe", it failed because the sultan was not prepared to cooperate with him. At that time Bayezld regarded a siege of Constantinople and operations in northern Greece as more important than any far-reaching projects Tlmur was contemplating. Be that as it may, the spring campaign of 797/1395 turned out to be more urgent than any other actions Tlmur may have been considering, such as operations against the Mamluks in Syria and Egypt or indeed against Bayezld himself. For this there were two reasons. First, the attempts to negotiate an alliance between the Golden Horde and Cairo,

THE FINAL CONFLICT WITH TOKHTAMISH
which cannot have escaped the attention of the Chaghatai high command, meant that the ruler of Iran faced the risk of being hemmed in between these two powers, as was the situation of the Il-Khanid Empire and other Iranian empires before it. Secondly - and here the danger was no less acute — incursions into Tlmur's domain in the Caucasus provided clear evidence of hostile intentions on Tokhtami'sh's part. When, in addition, Tokhtamish replied in unsatisfactory terms to Tlmur's conciliatory message, the Chaghatai troops received the order to march against him that same spring. The decisive battle, in which both rivals personally took part, was fought in the valley of the river Terek in the northern Caucasus. It ended in a crushing defeat for the Q'ipchaq army. The way was now clear for Timur to advance into the Volga area and to strike against the capital of the Golden Horde, Saral. It was looted and plundered together with other cities of the lower Volga, the Crimea and the northern Caucasus. An immeasurable amount of booty was carried off, and many of the native people, not just soldiers but women and children too, were abducted into slavery. Stories of Timur advancing as far as Moscow have no basis in fact, although he did make raids on cities in southern Russia that were close to the frontiers of the Golden Horde. The country was so devastated and depopulated, its economic potential so effectively destroyed, that the Q'ipchaq empire never again recovered. Moreover, with the severance of the trade routes and the destruction of key transfer-points, long-distance trade between the Far East and Europe, in so far as it passed via the Golden Horde, was virtually paralysed. Timur had probably intended to ruin the country's economy in this way, for it is unlikely that he thought of usurping power there even though he helped Temiir Qutlugh, a pretender of his choice, to assume control. Tokhtamish, who lost his throne as a result of the defeat, still had a role to play in later eastern European conflicts, but any ambition he or the Golden Horde had in Transoxiana or Iran were thwarted once and for all. Although its effects were to be felt for some time, Tlmur's brutal punishment of the Q'ipchaqs came to an end in the spring of 798/1396 when he marched to Persia via Darband. Isolated operations in Georgia, Azarbaljan, Fars and other areas of Iran, including the suppression of a rebellion in Yazd, brought the five-year campaign to a close. In the summer the Chaghatai troops set out on the return journey to Samarqand, where Timur was to make his most protracted sojourn prior to embarking on the Indian campaign we have already noticed.
73

THE CAMPAIGNS IN SYRIA AND ANATOLIA
Tlmur had scarcely recovered from a severe illness suffered on the return march from India to Transoxiana when not long after his arrival back in Samarqand, in May 1399, he began preparations for a new campaign. This was the so-called seven-year campaign against the West. A mass of information reaching him from that quarter led Tlmur to decide on this course of action. All was not well in the realm of his son Mlran Shah, who reigned "on the throne of Hiilegu" in Sultaniyya and Tabriz. The situation was eased somewhat by the death in 801/1399 of Barquq, the Mamluk Sultan of Cairo, and the succession of his son Faraj, a boy often. On the other hand, it was aggravated by the constant and apparently irresistible rise to power of the Ottoman Sultan Bayezld I. On 25 September 1396 he had won a spectacular victory over an army of crusaders at Nicopolis on the lower Danube. Later, during Timur's Indian campaign, he had enjoyed success in Anatolia in operations against the princes of Qaraman. Other news to reach Samarqand at this time was that of the death in 1398 of the emperor T'ai-tsu, who thirty years earlier had brought the Yuan dynasty to an end and expelled the Mongols from China. No doubt this greatly interested Tlmur, but not enough to make him waver in his resolve to take action first against the threats looming in the west. When the Chaghatai troops set off for Persia, a detachment under the command of Sulaiman Shah, one of Timur's nephews, was sent on ahead to investigate the charges that had been made against Prince Miran Shah. Doubts had arisen about his loyalty because he had alluded in letters to his father's advanced age and incapability. The charges also concerned his failure to deal with instances of unrest and refusal to pay taxes in the area he ruled, as well as the loss of the stronghold of Alinjaq, a pocket of resistance of great importance to the
Jalayirids1 where Georgian troops had come to the relief of Prince Tahir, a son of Sultan Ahmad Jalayir. Far from making difficulties, Miran Shah actually came forth with Sulaiman Shah to meet his father. Tlmur deposed him, and without further punishment assigned him to his retinue, where he was to remain for the next four years. His friends

74



THE CAMPAIGNS IN SYRIA AND ANATOLIA
and advisers, some of them well known figures in cultural life, were not treated so lightly. They were severely punished, and some of them even executed, for allegedly corrupting the prince and leading him astray; this despite the fact that he was by now thirty-three years of age. Timur personally directed operations to restore order in northwestern Persia. Then he moved into winter quarters in Qarabagh, a stretch of country in the bend of the river Araxes that offered good winter shelter, especially for cavalry. From here he launched a punitive raid against the Georgians that was interrupted only by adverse weather conditions. The very next spring saw the start of a new campaign against the Georgians, the fifth in all, in the course of which Tiflis was again stormed. Timur had demanded that the Jalayirid Tahir, who had sought refuge with the Georgians, be handed over, but King Giorgi VII allowed him to escape just in time, and he made his way to the Ottoman Sultan Bayezld. In view of the destruction caused by the Chaghatais and the heavy losses sustained by his troops and people, the Georgian king was forced to open negotiations withTimur, in the course of which he agreed to pay a considerable tribute and to furnish a contingent of troops for the conqueror's army. Even though Sultan Barquq had now died, Timur still had a score to settle with the Mamluks because of the support they had given to Sultan Ahmad Jalayir, their attempts to form an alliance with the Golden Horde, and above all the murder of his ambassador to Cairo. Although some years had elapsed since the murder took place, Timur could scarcely allow it to go unexpiated, if only for reasons of prestige. Another factor he had to consider was the position of Mesopotamia. The presence of a strong opponent in Egypt would pose a real threat to its security and might leave one flank dangerously exposed, should he ever contemplate an expedition to Anatolia. Nor can one entirely rule out the possiblity that Timur, with his respect for Mongol tradition, felt an obligation to avenge the historic defeat that the Mamliiks had inflicted upon the Mongols in 658/1260 at 'Ain Jalut in Palestine. Lastly, it can scarcely have escaped his attention that since the death of Barquq and young Faraj's elevation to the throne rivalries among the military commanders had made the internal situation in the Mamluk kingdom highly unstable, a state of affairs that positively invited intervention on his part. Such were the considerations that led to the advance of the Chaghatais against Syria in the autumn of 803/1400. Setting off from Malatya,
75



TIMUR IN IRAN
the armies marched via 'Aintab and captured the city of Aleppo. There they laid siege to the citadel, forcing it to surrender within four weeks. Not long afterwards Hama, Hims and Ba'labakk also fell. Early in Jumada I/at the end of December Timur arrived outside Damascus. Sultan Faraj, who had arrived with his forces from Cairo a few days earlier, was encamped in the Ghuta, not far from the city. He did not join battle, however, but marched off again, ostensibly because of rumours of an impending coup in Cairo. The sultan's withdrawal was a shattering blow to the morale and resistance of the Damascenes. The surrender of the city was followed by that of the fortress. The tribute Damascus had to pay was so high that all its resources were exhausted. Even so, the city was thrown open to the Chaghatai troops for three days of general pillage in the middle of March 1401. They committed untold crimes and atrocities despite TTmur's orders to spare the population.
For Timur the Syrian campaign reaped a rich reward in terms of goods and valuables confiscated and slaves captured. For the country itself it meant economic ruin, the devastation of its cities, the decimation of its population and the destruction of countless businesses and trades. This state of collapse, which was to last for many years, suited Tlmur's plans perfectly. Together with the unstable political situation inside Egypt, it offered, for the time being at least, the best possible guarantee against dangerous activities on the part of the Mamluks, let alone any revival of the idea of an alliance between them and the Ottomans. Conscious of the success he had thus achieved and perhaps influenced by the warnings of a Western observer, Bertrando di Mignanelli, of a possible attack from the rear by the Ottoman Sultan, Timur resolved to refrain from advancing further southwards against Egypt and to turn his attention once more to activities in Anatolia. Before doing so, however, he still had to avert the danger threatening from Baghdad. Thus, in the summer he proceeded to carry out the terrible revenge on that city to which we have already referred. Just as Sultan Ahmad Jalayir and the Qara Quyunlu prince Qara Yusuf had sought refuge with the Ottoman sovereign, so Anatolian chiefs came to ask Timur for asylum, having lost their dominions to the Sultan of Edirne. They were able to ensure that the Chaghatais were kept well informed about developments in the Ottoman sphere of influence. Although no military confrontation had yet taken place,
76



THE CAMPAIGNS IN SYRIA AND ANATOLIA
Tlmur and Bayezld Yildirim ("the Thunderbolt") had already been in opposition to one another for some time. When Tlmur had invaded eastern Anatolia in the preceding year, the Sultan had been besieging Constantinople and was unable to react, first because of the great distance involved and secondly because of the impossibility of confronting the enemy with his troops before the onset of winter. He was thus unable to relieve the city of Sivas, which he had captured only a few years previously from the renowned QazI Burhan al-Dln Ahmad. In revenge for the devastation of the city, he conquered Arzinjan in 1401, deposing for the time being its commandant, a protege of Tlmur
named Taharten.1 Bayezid was only too well aware, however, that much more was at stake than this or that stronghold in eastern Anatolia, than one more city or less pillaged by the Chaghatais. Timur's plans for global conquest, long since a topic of daily conversation in every kingdom, were now jeopardising the very existence of the Ottomans. Up to now Bayezld had succeeded not only in centralising power in his own empire but had also subjugated the Balkan states within a few years and won a brilliant victory over the Hungarian King Sigismund at Nicopolis. If he wished for further success in this direction he simply had to eliminate the Chaghatai threat. He was now confronted by a new situation, for in his desire to expand he had so far looked principally to the west and north-west. Raising the siege of Constantinople, he marched eastwards with his army. In doing so he planned to force Timur, who had again spent the winter in Qarabagh, into fighting a battle at a spot on the upper reaches of the Euphrates where conditions would be much less favourable to Tlmur than to his opponent. By strategically skilful manoeuvres Tlmur managed to avoid the confrontation. Indeed, he even lured Bayezld into what, for him, proved a fatal race to reach Chubuq-ovasi, a plain north-west of Engiiriye, on the site of present-day Ankara, where he, Tlmur, contemplated fighting the decisive engagement. Arriving a few days earlier on the field of battle, the Chaghatais from the outset enjoyed an advantage over the Ottomans, who were late on the scene and, what is more, exhausted after days of forced marches in the summer heat. Tlmur made good use of

his start by fortifying his camp and cutting off the enemy's access to water. Sources differ as to the precise date of the battle. The most likely
date is 27 Dhu'l-Hijja 804/28 July 1402.l There are also considerable discrepancies in the figures quoted for the strength of the two armies, the highest estimates being those of the Bavarian, Johann Schiltberger, who himself participated in the battle and was captured by the Chaghatais — namely, 1,600,000 Chaghatai and 1,400,000 Ottoman troops. A modern historian, after taking into account every known or accessible circumstance, particularly the distances marched and the movement of supplies, puts the figure for each side at a maxi
mum of 20,000 men.2 Apart from a few dozen Indian elephants on Tlmur's side, the most important difference between the two armies was the strong representation in the Ottoman ranks of Janissaries, who were crack troops. In contrast to the bulk of the Chaghatais, however, these were not mounted forces. In the first phase of the battle it was by no means clear which army would be victorious, which was hardly surprising since some of the most successful and efficient fighting troops of that time had come face to face. A turning point was reached only when whole contingents of the Sultan's army left the field en bloc or went over to Tlmur's side. This was the result of earlier propaganda by the Chaghatais, helped by the Anatolian princes who had taken refuge with Tlmur after being deposed by Bayezid. Although the Sultan lost all his cavalry in this way, he fought stubbornly on together with his Janissaries. They struggled with a courage born of despair, but had no chance against the might of the Chaghatai cavalry: in the end they were massacred, and Bayezid, who fell from his horse in a last minute attempt to escape, was taken captive. If the battle of Ankara did not seal the fate of the Ottoman empire, it was because Tlmur failed to exploit his victory to the full. Some of his generals did pursue fleeing enemy contingents, but quite a number of them escaped across the Sea of Marmora to Europe. Tlmur also advanced further to the west, but at an unusually slow pace attributed by RolofF in part to the depleted strength of the Chaghatai forces after the battle and to the delay in reinforcements from the east. In spite of

THE CAMPAIGNS IN SYRIA AND ANATOLIA
the many places he conquered (and they included the former Ottoman capital Bursa); in spite of his advance to the Aegean, where at the end of 1402 he stormed the stronghold of the Knights of St John at Smyrna (Izmir) and afterwards received the homage of the lords of several Aegean islands, there can be no question of Tlmur's having truly eliminated the Ottomans. Nor did he set up a Chaghatayid administration in Anatolia. Instead he was content for the most part to reestablish under his suzerainty the regional principalities that the Sultan had abolished. As far as Constantinople was concerned, he was happy to accept the offer of submission brought to him by the hastily dispatched envoys of Emperor Manuel II, and he did not concern himself with the Balkans. The Sultan himself was taken along as a prisoner in Tlmur's retinue until his death in Aqshehir on 13 Sha'ban 805/8 March 1403. Even though suicide was relatively rare in the Islamic world, the possibility cannot be ruled out that he took poison because it had been divulged to him that he would have to accompany Timur to Samarqand. Tlmur's problems in Anatolia were more or less at an end when Prince Siileyman, one of Bayezld's sons, subsequently declared his submission. Since the conqueror used the same methods to subjugate Anatolia as he had in other countries — raising excessive tributes, plundering and destroying cities, depopulating and devastating the countryside — the result was that the country's economic strength was destroyed when the campaign ended and his troops marched off eastwards. Politically, too, the area had been effectively neutralised, because for the time being Timur could rest assured that the Ottoman princes and the regional dynasts, both in Anatolia and in Europe, would be occupied with their own rivalries. The Chaghatai victory at Ankara gave rise to numerous diplomatic exchanges, not only between Tlmur's headquarters and oriental courts, but also with Western powers. These will be discussed in detail later, but it is worth mentioning at this point that even Sultan Faraj of Cairo made efforts to win Tlmur's favour. Hitherto he had detained the latter's envoys, but he now gave them permission to leave and sent an embassy of his own to declare his submission, which Timur accepted. The reaction of the Georgian King Giorgi VII was different. He had failed to congratulate Timur on his victory over Bayezld. In late summer, when Timur was approaching, he tried to make good the omission, but the conqueror rejected the gifts he sent, demanding that he should appear before him in person. He then resorted to various
79



TIMUR IN IRAN
excuses, but could not prevent the Chaghatais from invading his country and again subjecting it to the most terrible devastation. Giorgi at first retreated without any show of resistance, but eventually he managed to appease Tlmur by offering him valuable gifts, including droves of horses and gold coins struck in the conqueror's name. Tlmur again spent the winter of 806/1403—4 in Qarabagh, setting off on the return march to Transoxiana the following spring. If we were to accept the evidence of Safavid historians, it would have been in the course of this journey that he visited Ardabil and agreed to a request from Khwaja 'All, the master of the Safaviyya, for the release of his Ottoman
prisoners of war.1 He arrived back in Samarqand at the beginning of 807/the end of July or early in August 1404, after an absence of five years.
THE PLAN TO INVADE CHINA AND TIMUR'S DEATH
In the middle of the 8th/14th century the famous Arab traveller Ibn Battuta had written that Transoxiana, the kingdom of Sultan 'Ala' al-Dln Tarmashirin, was surrounded by four of the world's great kings: the king of China, the king of India, the king of Persia and the king of the Golden Horde (Ozbeg), all of whom sent gifts to the
sultan, and honoured and respected him.2 This statement gives some insight into the view of the world with which Tlmur grew up. It is not difficult to imagine what it now meant to the ageing prince to have conquered all the renowned rulers who had played a role in his boyhood and youth - all, that is, except for the emperor of China. To appreciate the full significance of this, it has to be realised that Tlmur considered it his mission to restore the former Mongol world empire, of which China had of course been a part. In fact, Mongol domination in China had actually outlasted the world empire, continuing as it did until the collapse of the Yuan dynasty in 1368. Chaghatayid court circles were of course familiar with the political situation in contemporary China. It was known, for instance, that just recently, in 1402, the Emperor Hui-ti, grandson and successor of the Ming Emperor T'ai-tsu who had died four years previously, had been deposed by his uncle Yung-lo. Information about Yung-lo's policy towards the Mongols was also available. The new sovereign was known to be a

THE CHINA PLAN AND TIMUR S DEATH
particularly efficient warrior and thus probably represented a special challenge to Timur. As had been his custom prior to making a major decision, Tlmur again summoned a quriltai. Concerning this assembly, which took place in September 1404 on the plain of Kan-i Gil close to Samarqand, we possess a report by the Castilian ambassador Clavijo, who had then just arrived to take up his post and attended the gathering together with his advisers. It amounted to a demonstration of power, designed not only to impress external enemies against whom military operations were planned, but also to bolster the confidence of Timur's own forces. In addition to military consultations, Timur held a gigantic review of his troops in which the various Chaghatai hordes appeared. In conjunction with the assembly magnificent banquets were given, including the marriage celebrations for several royal princes, notably Prince
Ulugh Beg, Tlmur's favourite grandson.1 During the festivities and consultations in Kan-i Gil preparations for the expedition to China, which Tlmur had already commenced from Anatolia, were in full swing. Thus his forces, which included numerous auxiliaries in addition to the hard core of Chaghatais, were able to begin their march soon afterwards. Timur himself left Samarqand on 23 Jumada I/27 November. The orders he issued regarding the government and administration of the capital and the country as a whole, as well as the measures he took to protect his advance and his supply lines, all pointed to a particularly long absence. Despite severe weather conditions Timur pressed on with all speed. He left Aqsulad, where it had been planned to spend the winter, even before December was over. The bitter cold and the snow made life very difficult for the troops with their numerous baggage trains, but on the other hand a thick covering of ice on the Jaxartes made the river easier to cross. Nevertheless, there were instances of both men and animals succumbing to the frost. In the middle of Rajab 807/January 1405 Timur reached Utrar, some 250 miles from Samarqand. This city, the point of departure for caravans going to China by the route through Mughalistan north of the Tien Shan range, was to serve as the rendezvous for the planned operation. Timur lodged in the governor's palace. Although he had made use of a litter as on previous occasions when he had been unwell, e.g. on

the return journey from India, the long trip had left its mark on the conqueror, who was now nearing the end of his sixty-ninth year. In Utrar he continued to suffer from the extreme cold, and when members of his entourage suggested holding a feast to relieve the general atmosphere of depression, he readily agreed. The celebration lasted three days, during which Tlmur, in his efforts to keep warm, constantly drank wine and other alcoholic beverages, but touched no food. Although he became feverish and suffered from stomach and bowel trouble, rather as in cases of gastritis, he continued drinking until he eventually lost the power of speech. For all their efforts his court physicians were unable to bring him relief. When he finally recovered consciousness and was able to speak again, he himself announced that his end was near. His doctors, asked to tell him the unvarnished truth about his condition, could not in all seriousness contradict him. To the princes and dignitaries assembled around his sick-bed he declared his last will and testament, in which he appointed as his successor on "the throne of Samarqand" his grandson Plr Muhammad b. Jahanglr. All the nobles present, whose spokesmen were Amir Shah Malik and Amir Shaikh Nur al-Dln, had to swear a solemn oath that they would respect this stipulation. Tlmur died in the night of 17 Sha'ban 807/18 February
1405.
The princes and generals resolved to abandon the projected expedition to China and to proceed only with the smaller scale action against Mughalistan, which had formed the first stage of the original plan and which Tlmur had ordered to begin on 10 Sha'ban/11 February, even before he fell ill. They would in any case only have been carrying out an order given long ago, since prince Ulugh Beg had been appointed governor of Mughalistan on the occasion of his marriage in Kan-i Gil, and his retinue had already been assembled. In order to accomplish this much at least, it was decided to keep secret the monarch's death for the time being. Khwaja Yusuf, who was charged with transporting Tlmur's mortal remains to Samarqand, was to leave under cover of darkness so as to escape notice. In addition he was to spread the rumour that he was conveying the remains of a dead princess. Despite all attempts to cover things up, however, it quickly became common knowledge that the conqueror had passed away. As a result the planned campaign against Mughalistan was also abandoned.

February,1 buried Timur in total secrecy alongside his grandson Muhammad Sultan b. Jahanglr (who had originally been designated as Timur's successor but had died on the return march from the Aegean in March 1403), in the vault that bore the latter's name, the Khangah-i Muhammad Sultan. Later, probably in 1409 after Shah Rukh's occupation of Samarqand, the body was removed — once more with that of Muhammad Sultan - to its present resting place in the Gur-i Mir.
AN ASSESSMENT OF TIMUR
Before assessing Timur's significance in the framework of Iranian history, a brief sketch of his personality will be given, especially those features not yet touched upon. For this we are indebted to several excellent studies of Timur that have appeared in the course of the last sixty years. Concerning Timur and his times there is an abundance of source materials. They provide details not only of his campaigns, actions, and policies but also of his person, character and outlook on life. We can even say with certainty what he looked like. He was tall in stature and broad-shouldered. His right thigh bone had coalesced with the kneecap, which made him drag his right leg, and similar deformities in the right shoulder and lower arm deprived him of the normal use of his right hand. This coincides with what Ibn 'Arabshah, who was a fourteen-year old boy when he saw Timur, later wrote about his appearance from memory. It is also borne out by the account of the Castilian ambassador Clavijo, who met the conqueror a few weeks before his death and thus also speaks of his great age, his weakening eyesight and his already clouded judgment. There exists, in addition, a modern reconstruction by the Soviet anthropologist and sculptor M. M. Gerasimov, of Timur's head which gives a reasonably accurate likeness of his facial features inasmuch as it has been modelled on his
preserved skull.2 It is not, however, adequate to help determine whether any of the illustrations that have been preserved in miniature paintings has the character of a portrait. The information available about Timur's character and personality is of course far less reliable than the data just mentioned, which are based

on examinations of his skeleton. Here we are dependent to a large extent on the accounts of writers who were anything but impartial, for example the polemical utterances of Ibn 'Arabshah, who had every reason to be resentful of the conqueror, or the panegyrics of Sharaf al-Dln 'All Yazdi, who was in the pay of Timur's descendants. More or less neutral observers, such as Clavijo or the North African philosopher of history Ibn Khaldun, are rare exceptions, but there are many questions on which they remain silent. One of Timur's characteristics was truly extraordinary: his military genius. His victories and conquests, his strategic and tactical feats are almost without parallel in world history. The callousness and bestial cruelty with which he achieved them are similarly almost unrivalled. As a rule only those who surrendered without a struggle had any chance of escaping his dreadful vengeance. His imposing appearance, his exceptional physical strength, his powerful voice, his courage and resilience may well have contributed to his military rise to power, but such qualities are not in themselves enough to explain his unprecedented successes. The example set by heroes of the nomadic tradition in which he had grown up must certainly have played a great part. This is clear from the reverence he had for the Chingizids and his predilection for Mongol customs that culminate in warlike deeds and demand from their adherents above all else feats of military prowess. When such imponderables have been taken into account, together with the fact that from his earliest youth he enjoyed a first-rate military training, a great deal still remains which must be ascribed to natural talent. Timur's immense political and military power may be regarded as the ultimate achievement of a nomadic warrior tradition that was modelled on the exploits of the Mongols, but this is by no means the only reason why he is a figure of historical interest and significance. Whilst it is true that he criticised his fellow warrior and rival Amir Husain for fortifying the city of Balkh and thus violating nomadic tradition, to which any idea of fixed settlements was utterly foreign, he himself proceeded to establish a fixed capital of his own after Husain had been defeated. At first it was intended to be Shahr-i Sabz, but in fact it turned out to be Samarqand. Tlmur, the descendant of nomads, spent decades of his life making this city more and more splendid. He surrounded it with a ring of newly built villages named after the ancient centres of the Islamic world — Baghdad, Sultaniyya, Shlraz, Misr (Cairo) and Dimashq (Damascus) - thus emphasising the unique

AN ASSESSMENT OF TIMUR
distinction and superiority of the new metropolis. His military campaigns provided the resources, materials and manpower needed to carry out the architectural projects he had in mind. The vast wealth of booty brought to Samarqand from the countries he had conquered, and the architects, craftsmen and artists selected from the populations of captured cities and deported to Transoxiana, all made it possible to develop the capital and other places as well. Many of the buildings Tlmur had erected have been preserved to this day. Some have survived intact or have been restored, some are merely representative remains; but all testify to the artistic taste of the period and also, it is reasonable to assume, to the taste of their architect, Tlmur himself. The question now arises as to whether all this architectural activity stemmed from genuine cultural impulses or whether it was merely the product of Timur's desire to provide as splendid a framework as possible for the power he had gained. We may perhaps be in a better position to answer this question if we first examine Timur's attitudes to other areas of cultural life to see whether he had any feeling for such activities at all, and if so to what extent. Even though he could neither read nor write, TTmur had a command of Persian in addition to his Eastern Turkish mother tongue. Persian was the language not only of his court chroniclers, who had to read out their works for his critical
comments, but also that of his chancellery.1 His interest in history was not confined to contemporary chronicles but included also the past of the Turks, the Persians and the Arabs. Two other disciplines in which he is said to have shown an interest were medicine and astrology, although it is claimed that he did not avail himself of the latter for his personal use, preferring instead to seek guidance from oracles (tafd'ul) in the Qur'an. Regarding his attitude to philosophy and logic the sources contain conflicting statements. Tlmur always had a number of scholars in close attendance, and he had a particular liking for the conversation of members of religious orders, theologians and representatives of spiritual life in general. Of these the most famous — if one ignores the meeting with Hafiz which cannot be entirely ruled out but is not reliably documented — was Ibn Khaldun (b. 732/1332, d. 808/1406). The Moroccan scholar has left us
1 Evidence of this is provided by three documents: (1) Timur's decree of 804/1401, referred to in n. 1 p. 4;; (2) his letter to Charles VI of France, in Qazvlnl, "NamaT'; and (3) his letter of 1395 to Bayezld, referred to in n. 2 p-7*. It goes without saying that the use of Persian was not confined exclusively to Timur's chancellery.

detailed accounts of the conversations he had with Tlmur in January and February 1401, when they met on numerous occasions in the military camp outside Damascus. The very fact that the conqueror knew of Ibn Khaldun's reputation as a historian and philosopher, immediately enquired after him in Damascus, and received him time and again for lengthy conversations is in this context highly significant. The various discussions are said to have been conducted in a friendly indeed positively cordial — atmosphere. This was probably because the historian with his engaging appearance, elegant bearing, shrewdness and eloquence was soon able to gain Timur's sympathy. The fact that he mentioned several prophecies from his younger days that might be interpreted as relating to Tlmur may also have played its part. In view of the large number of audiences he was granted and the favours readily bestowed upon him for his personal security and that of his friends and colleagues, as well as unconditional leave to return to Cairo, one can scarcely describe Ibn Khaldun's account of his friendly reception by Tlmur as exaggerated. The historian's Moroccan homeland figured largely in the discussions. The conqueror, who knew little about it, not only made him talk at some length about the country but also caused him to write a fairly detailed expose of the subject during those weeks in Damascus. It is likely that they devoted even more time to historical questions, discussing the heroes of classical antiquity, the ancient East and Iranian mythology, as well as more recent matters such as the continuation of the 'Abbasid caliphate after the fall of Baghdad in the persons of the puppet caliphs at Cairo and the problem of their legitimacy. Tlmur did not hesitate to recognise them, influenced as he probably was by the legitimist attitude which he himself observed towards his own Chingizid shadow khan, Mahmud, whose name had been duly inserted in the khutba of the Umayyad mosque following the capture of Damascus. The account of the conversations in Damascus conveys the impression that Tlmur, even at an advanced age (he was then just completing his sixty-fifth year), was blessed with an active mind, intellectual curiosity, unclouded judgment and a remarkable degree of culture. Ibn Khaldun expressly credits him with high intelligence, discernment and delight in the discussion of topics both familiar and unfamiliar. As far as his religious attitudes were concerned, Tlmur remained strongly attached to Mongol traditions; indeed, after his death his followers felt constrained to design his burial-place according to Mon

gol custom and in defiance of Muslim beliefs.1 Yet he frequently stressed his faith in Islam, claiming that he would make it the dominant religion in the world. As an example of this attitude one need only point to his conflict with the Mughals, whom he quite justifiably regarded as unbelievers. In general the evidence for his religious beliefs is conflicting: some factors suggest a commitment to Islam, others cast doubt upon it. His relations with representatives of the Muslim faith theologians, members of religious orders and dervishes — have already been mentioned, as has his predilection for religious debate. One could also point to the sums he spent on religious causes, on sacred buildings and visits to Muslim holy places. On the other hand, it is impossible to ignore the fact that his troops desecrated mosques, transgressed the laws of sanctuary, murdered prayer-leaders in the Umayyad mosque of Damascus and killed Muslim men, women and children or took them captive by the thousand in order to sell them as slaves. Ibn al-Shihna records hearing Tlmur vent his anger upon troops who were found to have decapitated people alive instead of collecting human heads severed from corpses, as they had been ordered, but such evidence scarcely mitigates the overall picture of disregard for Muslim lives. Another contradictory aspect of Tlmur's behaviour was his simultaneous observance of both the customary law of the Mongols (ttirii, turd) and the Muslim religious law {Shortd). No less peculiar was his ambivalent attitude to the split within Islam between Sunna and Shl'a. In Mazandaran he punished Shl'I dervishes for disparaging the Companions of the Prophet, whereas in Syria he appeared as the protector of the Shl'a and the descendants of 'All. Here one must assume that either his contemporaries and associates in general or he himself lacked all awareness of the acute polarisation between the two views of Islam, or that he acted in a purely opportunist fashion, adopting religious causes for reasons of political expediency. Despite conflicting evidence in the sources Tlmur cannot be regarded as an adherent of the Shl'a. Yet even though he was not a religious man, his personal development was influenced to a great extent by three theologians. They were Shams al-Dln Kulal, his father's spiritual adviser, who was greatly attached to him in his childhood; Zain al-Dln Abu Bakr TayabadI KhwafI, who is said to have protected him from the start of his military career; and Sayyid Baraka, his own spiritual adviser.

89



TIMUR IN IRAN
Tlmur's attitude to religion becomes somewhat clearer if it is seen against the background of his homeland Transoxiana. At that time the country was the meeting point of the Muslim sphere of influence (Ddr al-lsldm) and the as yet non-Islamic world {Ddr al-harb). The sedentary population, predominantly Persian, had adopted the Muslim faith. So too had the nomadic population, Chaghatai Turks and Mongols, although their Islamic beliefs were less orthodox and still left room for elements of Shamanism and other heathen notions. Alongside these were tribes which were totally unaffected by Islam and attracted the attention of itinerant Muslim mystics, who attempted to convert them. The majority of these were Sufi dervishes whose views as a rule did not accord with strict SunnI doctrine. One such itinerant monk was Ni'mat-Allah Vail KirmanI, the famous founder of a religious order, who when they met personally made so strong an impression on Timur that the conqueror feared he might exert a suspect political influence
and banished him from Transoxiana.1 The assertion that Timur was a proponent of uncompromising orthodoxy does not bear investigation, any more than do attempts to compare him with Charlemagne, Charles V or Napoleon and other great historical figures. Not even the apparently convincing comparison with Chingiz Khan is well founded. The Mongol conqueror was a nomad, and remained a nomad all his life. The Chaghatai was himself no longer a nomad, even though he won his victories with predominantly nomadic troops and actually came from a nomadic environment. He had, after all, given up the vital principle of not becoming attached to any one place, at the latest when he made Samarqand his capital and set about developing it into a splendid metropolis with the help of the treasures, artists and craftsmen of the countries he had conquered. Of course he was familiar with the nomadic way of life and even liked to take part in it frequently, but from his earliest childhood he had connections with the settled rural population and also with city life, as can be seen from his knowledge of Persian alone. Timur, if one wants to characterise him aptly, was a Turkish aristocrat of Central Asian origin, in essence a military man but not lacking either in cultural interests or intellectual refinement. If anything, his respect for Mongol traditions strengthens rather than detracts from

this view, as does his ideal of restoring Mongol world domination. His cruel methods of warfare were not unique to him, but corresponded to the almost inconceivably harsh practices of the period, as we have seen from those symbols of terror, the pyramids of skulls. What set him apart from all other contemporary princes was his mastery as a general and the unprecedented good fortune in battle that accompanied his career right up to the end. It is this that has guaranteed him a place not only in the annals of history but also in the popular legends and literatures of the East and the West even down to the present day.
Timur's effective destruction of the military and economic might of the Golden Horde did a great deal to liberate Old Russia from the Tartar yoke under which it had suffered for so long. The catastrophic fall of the Ottoman empire after the defeat at Ankara and the capture of Sultan Bayezld, granted Constantinople, which was then close to falling, another fifty years' respite. In this way Tlmur, who considered himself the standard-bearer of Islam, rendered the Christian powers valuable service. Needless to say, this was not his intention; indeed, it is doubtful whether he ever became aware of such causal connections. There can be even less question of agreements with the prince of Moscow and the Byzantine Emperor. It does, however, show that Tlmur, who after all had undertaken to re-establish the Mongol world empire, was not always guided by global political considerations. Just as it is difficult to discern any clear global policy behind his campaigns, so it is hard to see what were the objectives in his various campaigns in the case of victory. Nor is there much evidence of economic planning and consideration, apart from the primary need to supply Samarqand and a certain amount of assistance given to other cities of Transoxiana, notably Shahr-i Sabz. Tlmur seems to have lacked any really clear sense of the need to make long term arrangements or to plan for the future. The conquered territories were held together as if in a vice by their fear of Timur's policy of inexorable terror, as experienced by all those who disobeyed him or rebelled against him. In this sense the gruesome examples of Herat, Tabriz, Isfahan and Baghdad had the desired effect, but in the long run they could not make up for Timur's lack of statesmanly vision and his failure as a consequence to make appropriate structural changes. Originally Tlmur seems to have pursued a policy of setting up protectorates in the conquered territories under the control of mem

bers of the previously ruling dynasties who were loyal to him. However, this solution only proved practical in exceptional cases because the danger of such governors defecting was too great. As his sons and grandsons, along with other princes of his dynasty, gradually grew older, TTmur therefore reverted to the old Turkish principle of appointing princely governors from among his own family. In such cases an experienced amir would be assigned to the younger princes as atabeg or tutor, whose job it was to ensure that they exercised power correctly. This, at any rate, was the policy Tlmur applied in Iran soon after his very first advance against Khurasan, though he did not necessarily adhere to it in other countries as well. Thus Amir Shah Malik was appointed governor of Damascus, and Prince Aba Bakr received Baghdad. But Tokhtamish, on the other hand, was replaced by one of his Mongol relatives, while in India power was similarly entrusted to a native regent, and it was an Ottoman prince who after the battle of Ankara was set up as ruler in the Ottoman dominions. Basic to this principle was of course the idea that power belonged not only to the ruler but to his whole family, or more precisely to all its male members. As far as the continuity of the dynasty was concerned the concept was not without its attendant risks, for an almost inevitable consequence of the death of the ruler was the creation of minor principalities, a problem that duly arose in Tlmur's realm. In such cases it was necessary, if the empire was not to become fragmented, to neutralise all those princes who were surplus to succession requirements. The Ottomans solved the problem by murdering them. Later, the Safavids were to confine them strictly to the harem and to exclude them from all the affairs of state. In the case of the Timurids the problem never became quite so acute, because their dominions collapsed before such a stage was reached. In a recent study of administration and authority in Tlmur's empire, Beatrice Forbes Manz points out that the information on the subject available in the sources is inadequate. The very fact that such data are scarce has led Gafurov to conclude that Tlmur had no interest in
setting up a new system of administration in his dominions.1 The large number of different - indeed in themselves conflicting - settlements he is reported to have made do in fact suggest that he was more concerned to limit the powers of the governors, and leave himself as much oppor

tunity as possible for intervention, than to introduce unified and clearly defined forms of organisation. Certain features of Tlmur's military organisation bear this out. Whereas the main body of the fighting forces remained under the control of the central authority, the governors had only relatively small contingents at their disposal. In this way units could be called away from a particular territory without any need to consult the local governor responsible. Even though we are only concerned with Iran, it is necessary at this point to consider some features at least of the Chaghatai military system, to which Timur owed his victories and conquests. The nucleus of his armed forces was the Chaghatai units. Shortly after the invasion of Persia they were joined by Iranian troops such as, for example, the Khurasanian contingents under Sarbadar command, which were renowned for their efficiency and for which Timur had a particularly high regard. In the tightness of their organisation and the strictness of their discipline Timur's forces were more akin to the armies of Chingiz Khan than to any Islamic contingents of the period. No doubt this was Tlmur's intention, but it would be wrong to assume that he modelled his forces on those of the Mongols in every respect. In fact, he also pursued quite new tactics of warfare to outwit his opponents, such as abruptly changing the direction of his marches, using novel methods of deployment and reorganising his troops into hitherto unknown combat units. The military and administrative organisation of Iran under Timur differed in essential points from that of Transoxiana. The seven tiimens of Transoxiana had no equivalent in Persia. Instead the country was divided into provinces or areas controlled by governors of the kind that, with the exception of Farghana, did not exist in Transoxiana. Here especially there was a lack of uniformity. The Persian gubernatorial districts differed in size, and their legal arrangements were neither uniform from case to case nor over the course of time. Two of them are particularly notable - both because of their size and because of their titles, which were derived from older traditions. They are Tabriz (or Sultaniyya) and Qandahar. Prince Mlran Shah was expressly appointed to "the throne of Hiilegu" when he received the governorship of Azarbaljan, a post he occupied from 1396 until his dismissal in 1399. So too was his successor Muhammad Sultan b. 'Umar Shaikh on his appointment in 1401. Three years later he was in turn followed by prince 'Umar, Mlran Shah's second son, who was to have jurisdiction over all the princes in western Persia, including Fars and 'Iraq-i 'Ajam

as well as Mesopotamia. This immense power was in turn curtailed when the highly influential amir Jahan Shah was appointed as his guardian. As governor of Qandahar, PIr Muhammad b. Jahangir received, along with the territories stretching west of the Hindu Kush to the Indus, "the throne of Mahmiid of Ghazna". Since such high ranking princes were appointed to these two governorships — no less than three of them were designated successors to the throne — Tlmur must have considered them very important territories, perhaps even the most important of all after Transoxiana. In the case of Azarbaljan and the areas belonging to it this clearly makes sense, but it is not immediately obvious why Qandahar, which was economically no match for Tabriz, should have carried such weight. Evidently, however, it had a certain military and political significance, above all by virtue of its glorious past under the Ghaznavids, but also on account of its sheer size. Even in 1383, long before the Indian campaign, when it was first conferred upon a Timurid prince (MIran Shah), it comprised Herat, Balkh, Qunduz, Baghlan, Badakhshan, Khuttalan and Hisar. There were of course other large provinces in Iran, especially Fars with its capital Shlraz, which was conferred upon 'Umar Shaikh and later upon his son PIr Muhammad (not to be confused with his namesake, Jahanglr's son, who was prince of Qandahar). In addition there were any number of medium-sized and small governorships, such as Isfahan under Rustam, Hamadan under Iskandar, Kirman under the amir Idiku, Ray under Sulaiman Shah and Firiizkuh under Iskandar Shaikhl. Although the majority of the governors were descendants or relatives of Tlmur, such posts were also open to other deserving military commanders. Appointments of this kind, as the example of Fars suggests, could take the form of fiefs, called suyurghal, which were either hereditary
(suyiirghal-i abadt) or granted for a fixed duration.1 The suyurghal was an extension of the older iqtS that covered administration and jurisdic
tion in addition to taxes and duties.2 It probably dates from the turn of
1 According to ShamI i, 135:' Umar Shaikh Babadur-ri an mamlakat [sc, Fars] ba-suyiirghalfarmuda bdkim-i mutlaq gardanld. This evidence is important because it is the sole instance mentioned by ShamI of a large Persian territory being granted as suyurghal. The other examples he lists where a suyurghal was granted are: 1, 77 (Jl va vilayat); i, 95 (Kavkarsh in the Nisa area as suyiirghal-i abadi); 1, 122 {vilayatimu tabar); i, 145 {an qal'at-ra); and I, 153 (yilayat-i Akhlai). He employs the word suyirghal(at) on numerous other occasions, but not with reference to enfeoffments.

the 7th-8th/i3th-i4th centuries, and thus cannot have been intro
duced by Tlmur, as has been suggested,1 but must have been in exis
tence before his time. It was given specific form first by the Jalayirids,2 then by the Turkmen confederations, and finally by the Safavids. Although further research into the matter is needed, the suyurghal appears to have had various functions in Tlmur's time, such as the granting of territories, cities or strongholds, first to relatives of Tlmur, secondly to deserving military commanders, and lastly to former holders of such possessions who had surrendered to the conqueror. Whether exemption from taxation was also granted in every case remains to be seen, although it was probably a regular feature of the last mentioned type of arrangement. What is certain is that the suyurghal was not yet of great importance during Tlmur's reign, so that no comparison with the Safavid period is possible. Tlmur's governors in Persia, even if they were his own close relatives and enjoyed wide ranging powers, were not given unlimited jurisdiction vis-a-vis the
armed forces or the organs of civilian administration.3 There is ample evidence to show that they were subject to direct supervision from above and that they could be deposed where necessary, as the fate of prince MIran Shah demonstrates. When they were appointed, they were given the task of getting trade and business going again, putting the administration on a regular footing and bringing to heel or eliminating rebellious elements. In each case they were granted an initial period of a few years to accomplish such tasks, after which they were again required to report for military service. Under this administration, however much it may have varied from one area to another, Iran as a whole gradually recovered from the heavy damage it had sustained during the period of turmoil resulting both from the collapse of the Il-Khanid empire and the conquest and subjugation of the country by the Chaghatais. No lesser an authority

2 The word suyurghal occurs fifteen times in Nakhchivani's Dastur al-katib, dedicated to the Jalayirid Shaikh Uvais; but it is used not in the sense of "fief" or "transfer of territory" but rather of "favour", otherwise forming part of a compound verb meaning "to grant" or "to donate".
3 In this respect it would be wrong to make too much of the fact that the formula so^iimi^ is used in documents of MIran Shah dating from 796/1394 and 798/1396 and in a document of Muhammad Sultan of 804/1401. It is particularly interesting to note that in addition to the preamble Sultan Mahmud jarligbind'm, which is common to all three documents, the last also contains the formula Amir Timur kiiregen so^umindin.

than Barthold claimed that Tlmur's constructive achievements were just as astonishing as the destruction he wrought, and he has been praised in particular for the security that prevailed in his dominions. For instance, the example of a merchant's widow travelling on business, accompanied only by two young Indian slaves, has been cited to show that the route from Qandahar to Diyarbakr was absolutely safe. In dangerous areas robbery and theft were effectively curbed by the introduction of severe sanctions and also by military or police operations against notoriously disruptive elements amongst the nomadic populations of Tiirkmens, Kurds and Lurs. Not only Iran but Tlmur's entire empire also enjoyed the benefit of an efficient postal system. Apart from these by no means negligible achievements of Timur and his governors, what other benefits did the conqueror bring to Iran? We know of irrigation works in the steppes of Mughan and in Khurasan
that he either had installed or had restored to working order.1 He is said to have shown great enthusiasm for the reconstruction or restoration of cities and villages destroyed during his conquests; indeed it is claimed that he could not bear to see a patch of arable land lying fallow. As far as cultural life is concerned, one can point to the fact that Persian poetry continued to flourish, although there is relatively little evidence of its being directly encouraged by Timur. Persian historical scholarship owes a greater debt to him, for he commissioned several
works of distinction.2 One can also name Persian scholars who enjoyed his patronage, and who wrote their works exclusively or predominantly in Arabic, e.g. the theologian and grammarian Sa'd al-Dln Mas'iid al-Taftazanl (d. 791/1389 or six years later), the famous mystic and logician 'All b. Muhammad al-Sayyid al-Sharif al-Jurjani (d. 816/1413) and the renowned lexicographer Abu Tahir b. Ya'qub alShirazI al-Flruzabadl (d. 817/1414). The lack of any well organised, uniform system of administration, in conjunction with the basically destructive attitude to ruling authority which ceased to be latent among the Timurids when their eponymous leader died, did not detract from the gradual process of recovery in Persia, at least during the last phase of the conqueror's life. Once the news of his death had spread, however, these factors proved fatal both

to the continued existence of the empire and to the unity of Persia. But as far as the cultural foundations of the empire were concerned, the situation was quite different. Within the broad framework of his sphere of authority Timur once more, and for the last time, re-established the total cultural entity of Iran - from Transoxiana to eastern Anatolia, from the Aral Sea to Mesopotamia and from the Caucasus to the Indus. It is idle to speculate whether or not he was himself conscious of this fact. Certainly he personified the transition from a nomadic to a sedentary way of life, and in this his contact with Iranian culture played a decisive role. For him, indeed, Iran may well have been the very epitome of culture. This can be seen from his tireless efforts over a period of decades to develop his homeland, and in particular the metropolis of Samarqand, by means of buildings, works of art and other cultural achievements, the vast majority of which bore the imprint of Persian taste, Persian artistic sensibility and Persian craftsmanship. The fact that scholars, poets, artists and craftsmen were selected from the population of conquered cities and deported to Samarqand is also clear proof of this, for Iranian elements predominated in these cultural circles both outside Persia and within. Of course, as a result of this influx and in other ways, that section of the capital's population which was responsible for its cultural development also contained a sprinkling of Turkish and, to a lesser extent, Mongol elements: in certain particulars they too left their mark on the resulting culture, but they had no effect on its essential features. With the development of Samarqand the centre of gravity of Persian culture was switched to the periphery, a process not without precedent in the history of Iran. After Tlmur's death, however, this was offset by the enforced exodus of numerous people and by the development of new centres of Iranian culture under the Timurids. Not only did the culture of Iran survive the trials inflicted upon its representatives by Timur and his Chaghatais, but it also conserved sufficient energy to experience a further development in the constituent states that were formed after 807/1405. This was true even of Samarqand under Ulugh Beg, who had a marked preference for Mongol traditions. Timur thus laid the foundations for the culture of the Timurids, which was one of the most important epochs in Persian cultural history.

CHAPTER 3
THE SUCCESSORS OF TlMUR
The empire Tlmur left behind at his death was of vast extent. But as there existed neither an effective disposition for the succession nor a firm political organisation for the realm, its unity immediately crumbled. In spite of this, large portions of the territory remained for a long period in the hands of Timur's successors, some of them ruling over independent states, some in the manner of joint rulers and local princes as governors of the individual provinces in the daughter empires which now emerged. The distinction of this period was no longer military in character, nor political; it is to be sought rather in an astonishing upsurge of cultural and intellectual life, the shaping of which involved both Persian and Turkish elements under Timurid control and largely also Timurid patronage. After some years of violent conflict for the possession of the throne, the countries of Central Asia and the Near East again enjoyed periods of relative quiet in comparison with the reign of Tlmur. During such periods many of the old wounds inflicted by Tlmur in his campaigns and acts of devastation were healed. Conditions in individual regions, however, varied considerably, and hardly anywhere was there any sure guarantee of tranquil life, since local risings, disputes concerning the succession and incursions on the part of warlike neighbours were a constant possibility. The period of Timurid government in Iran extends from 807/1405 to 913/1507. Successors of Tlmur did in fact rule long after this period, in the Mughal empire in India founded by Zahir al-Dln Babur. However, that state had no immediate influence upon the development of Persia — at least, none of any major consequence. The importance of the Timurid age for Iran lies in the intellectual, religious, and cultural developments which were beginning to take shape at that time. These led at the end of the 9th/15 th and the beginning of the ioth/i6th century to radical changes in many parts of the Islamic world and particularly in the Iranian area.
EARLY SUCCESSION DISPUTES
Of the conqueror's sons, Jahanglr had died in 777/1575 and 'Umar Shaikh in 796/1394. The third, Miran Shah, suffered from mental trouble as the result of an accident, while the fourth, Shah Rukh, who
98



EARLY SUCCESSION DISPUTES
had been born in 779/1377 and had a reputation for excessive modesty, peaceableness and personal piety, appeared to lack the necessary qualities to rule. Hence Timur had appointed as his successor his grandson, Plr Muhammad b. Jahanglr, who was thirty-one years of age and occupied at the time the governorship of Qandahar, the "throne of Mahmiid of Ghazna". In the absence of support from his relatives he was unable to succeed to the throne and was murdered by his own vizier in 809/1407. It was clearly the case that the great empire which had been built upon the conquests of three decades was all too dependent on the personal authority of its founder. His sons and grandsons, whom he had appointed as governors of individual countries and provinces, where they reigned in effect as joint rulers, had been obliged to defer to his authority. With his death, however, that authority was at an end, and now they ignored his dispositions for the succession. Any one of them who was in a position to do so had his name incorporated in the official prayers and inscribed on the coinage in his own domain, so claiming for himself the status of an independent ruler. The governmental pattern Timur had given to his empire thus revealed its weakness. It based itself on the conception commonly accepted among Turkish peoples that the state belonged not to the ruler alone, but to the whole ruling family, and hence that the territory entrusted to the
administration of any one member of the family was his property.1 Under a monarch as strong as Timur such notions might not endanger the unity of the empire; but it was a very different matter in the situation obtaining after his death, when no personality comparable in terms of personal authority was at hand to take over the succession. The empire disintegrated into a number of separate principalities; and although a large number of them were later for some decades reintegrated into one state, the territorial extent of Timur's empire was never again attained. In the disputes over the succession and the confusions which now followed, various of his successors made war on one another, and certain amirs who had deserved well of the state and had been entrusted by him with offices at court or in the provinces were inevitably drawn into the conflicts. Others involved were local princes

THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
who derived their claims from the period before the reign of Timur and who now came forward to urge their own particular demands by force of arms. These struggles lasted for some years. At the death of Timur the troops of the main army formed part of his immediate train. Their amirs really wanted to prosecute the war against China, if only with the limited aim of striking a blow against the Mughals in eastern Turkestan. They abandoned the project, however, when on the news of Tlmur's death the succession did not work out according to plan. Samarqand, Tlmur's capital, fell into the hands of Prince Khalll Sultan b. Mlran Shah (b. 786/1384), who had distinguished himself in the campaign in India, had in 1402 received the governorship of Farghana, and had enjoyed his grandfather's particular favour. While still in Tashkent he had forthwith had his amirs pay homage to him; and regarding himself as Tlmur's successor, he took possession of his treasure, which he squandered, and transferred the title and authority of khan, which had hitherto always been vested in a direct descendant of Chingiz Khan, to a Timurid prince. Sultan Husain, the son of one of Tlmur's daughters, who at first had also been a pretender to the throne, relinquished his claim and joined forces with Khalll Sultan; though after various adventures he was to finish up in captivity and was put out of the way by Shah Rukh while under detention in Herat. Shah Rukh marched his army from his city of Herat to the Oxus, but made no further offensive move against Khalll, no doubt because the latter's father Mlran Shah represented a serious threat, advancing at the head of his troops from Azarbaljan — which had been given into his charge by Tlmur - with Aba Bakr, another of his sons, to the support of Khalll. He later withdrew, however, without having carried out his intentions. Although there were a series of more or less unproductive negotiations between Shah Rukh and Khalll Sultan, the latter was finally reduced after many clashes even though he had frequently been victorious. His attitude had provoked general disapproval in Samarqand. His amirs could not condone the powerful influence permitted to his wife Shad Mulk, as a result of which individuals of low rank were elevated to high positions to the disadvantage of Tlmur's old companions-in-arms, while the widows and concubines of Timur, not without some pressure, it seemed, were married off to men of humble origin. A famine which affected the land contributed its share to the general mood of discontent. And finally Khalll Sultan fell into the hands of Khudaldad Husain, a

REIGN OF SHAH RUKH
powerful tribal amir, leader of the Dughlat, a man who had once been his mentor. The latter accompanied him to Farghana, had him proclaimed as ruler in Andijan, and himself went to join the Mughals in order to win their military support for further operations. Meanwhile, on 27 Dhu'l-Hijja 811/13 May 1409, Shah Rukh occupied his own home city of Samarqand without striking a blow. He declared his eldest son Ulugh Beg (b. 796/1394) governor of Transoxiana, with his seat of government in Samarqand, initially under the guardianship of Amir Shah Malik, one of Tlmur's long-serving military commanders. Khalll Sultan, whose wife had fallen into the hands of Shah Rukh, now betook himself to his uncle in Samarqand, received his wife back from him and became governor of Ray. Shortly afterwards, however, on 16 Rajab 814/4 November 1411, he died there; whereupon Shad Mulk took her own life. Khalll Sultan, whose generosity, liberality and credulity, and unquestioning love of Shad Mulk, contributed largely to his own failure, has gone down in history — not least for his literary and artistic leanings — as a romantic figure, difficult to place in the general picture of the age.
THE REIGN OF SHAH RUKH
Now that, at a point in time marked at the latest by the death of Khalll Sultan and following the execution of Sultan Husain and the murder of Plr Muhammad, all immediate rivals had left the scene, Shah Rukh became Timur's successor. In spite of the fact that his father had not considered him for the succession, he had made him governor of Khurasan, the most centrally situated province of his empire, which he administered from Herat. He plainly felt so attached to that city that he declined to move to Samarqand and conducted the government of the Timurid empire from Herat until his death in 850/1447. Some years before the acquisition of Transoxiana Shah Rukh had extended his domains to include Gurgan and Mazandaran. Insubordination on the part of his nephew Balqara b. 'Umar Shaikh led to his mounting an expedition to Fars in 817/1414. Two years later he succeeded in subduing Kirman, where Sultan Uvais b. Amir Idiku Barlas had reigned since 811/1408 as an independent ruler. The area under his control was further extended as the pull of his steadily consolidated dominion made itself felt, either by voluntary subordination on the part of minor princes or by means of alliances. Thus it was not long after the fall of Khalll

Sultan that in a single year emissaries presented themselves from the land of the Uzbeks, from the Qi'pchaq steppes, from Shirvan, Hazarjarlb, Sari, Flriizkuh, Garmsir and Qandahar. Up until 823/1420 Shah Rukh was able to assert his power in the eastern areas of Timur's empire, central and southern Persia, but not in Mesopotamia and Azarbaljan. After the death of Tlmur, the Jalayirid Sultan Ahmad b. Uvais, who had been expelled by Tlmur fifteen years previously, once again seized power, only to be driven out of Tabriz by Aba Bakr b. MIran Shah. Shortly afterwards, however, an opponent made his appearance on the scene for whom Aba Bakr was no match. This was Qara Yusuf Qara Quyunlu, who defeated him, first in 809/1406 at Nakhchivan and then again in 810/1408 at the battle of Sardrud near Tabriz, in which MIran Shah met his death. In 813/1410 this Turkmen prince defeated and destroyed also Ahmad Jalayir when the latter attempted to reconquer Tabriz. As a result of his conquest of Diyarbakr and Baghdad and successful operations against Georgia and Shirvan, and above all by the conquest of Sultaniyya, Tarum, Qazvln and Sava in 822/1419, he established himself as a dangerous neighbour to the Timurids. The threat which arose in this advance of the Tiirkmens remained for decades the great unresolved problem of the Timurid empire. Shah Rukh attempted to solve it by political and — in three campaigns against Azarbaljan - military means, but never achieved more than partial success. Qara Yusuf, the real founder of the princely power of the Qara Quyunlu, an energetic and battle-hardened man, ended his days in Dhu'l-Qa'da 823/November 1420 as Shah Rukh entered Azarbaljan in the course of the first of these campaigns, so that the Timurid troops were at first able to occupy not only Tabriz but also Azarbaljan and Armenia without difficulty; but even so Shah Rukh was obliged to assert his sovereignty in the summer of the following year in a battle of several days' duration against the Turkmen prince's sons. However, as Iskandar b. Qara Yusuf contrived to re-establish the power of the Qara Quyunlu in the years that followed, another Azarbaljan campaign proved to be necessary in 832/1429. Once again, Shah Rukh won the day against the Tiirkmens. But his attempt to solve the problem by installing a Qara Quyunlu prince named Abu Sa'Id under Timurid suzerainty met with only short-lived success; for in 835/1431 Qara Iskandar reoccupied Tabriz and had Abu Sa'Id executed. Faced with the extension of Qara Iskandar's control over an ever wider area, Shah

REIGN OF SHAH RUKH
Rukh early in 838/near the end of 1434 resolved upon his third and last campaign against north-west Persia. This campaign, although it did not achieve a final settlement of the Turkmen question, at least brought about one which was adequate for the remainder of his reign, namely the installation of Qara Iskandar's brother Jahan Shah as the Timurid governor of Tabriz. It is noticeable that Shah Rukh, at least in the early part of his reign, frequently made transfers among the princes who held court as governors in the provinces of his empire. Among those transferred were not only Khalll Sultan (from Samarqand to Ray) but also 'Umar Mlrza (from Azarbaljan to Astarabad), Iskandar Mlrza (from Farghana and Kashghar to Hamadan and later to Shlraz), and Balqara Mlrza (from Shlraz to Qandahar and Garmslr), to mention only a few examples. It is reasonable to assume that the motive behind such measures, which were quite often directly connected with acts of insubordination on the part of those affected, was the desire to ward off possible hankerings after independence. Certainly Shah Rukh, for all his precautions, was not spared dangerous rebellions on the part of the Timurid princes. And though he was not hard put to it to suppress them in the eastern parts of his empire, it was a different matter in his western dominions. Over and over again he had to intervene with armed might against recalcitrant relatives, as for instance in 816/1413 against his nephew Iskandar b. 'Umar Shaikh, who once before, in 812/1409, had encouraged his brother Plr Muhammad to attack Kirman and, moreover, after the latter's murder had himself assaulted Isfahan and Kirman, systematically devastating the country in the process. Mention has already been made of Shah Rukh's campaign against Balqara b. 'Umar Shaikh, who not long afterwards rose in rebellion in Shlraz. Even shortly before his death, Shah Rukh, already weakened by age and illhealth, again had to march to the west, where one of his grandsons, Sultan Muhammad b. Balsunqur, had risen in revolt. In Ramadan 850/December 1446 he managed to bring the latter's supporters to justice in Sava, but the prince himself had eluded his grasp and escaped to Luristan. Three months later, on 25 Dhu'l-Hijja 850/13 March 1447, Shah Rukh died in winter quarters at Ray. At first sight his long reign seems to yield a fairly favourable overall
picture.1 Although Tlmur's enormous empire was not preserved in its

103



THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
entirety under his rule, it remained a coherent dominion of considerable extent in Central Asia and the Near East. In spite of protracted and sanguinary conflicts at home, which inevitably brought misery and suffering to the populations affected, the state was preserved for four decades from the anarchy which threatened to engulf it upon Timur's death; and in some parts of the empire there was an improvement not only in economic standards but also in cultural achievements. It must be admitted that the credit for the turn of the tide and these more hopeful developments was not all - perhaps not even primarily - Shah Rukh's. Although certain aspects of his character are in marked and refreshing contrast to the hardness and ruthlessness of his father, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that he should be credited with outstanding skill as a statesman, and even his character is not a matter of agreement amongst modern historians. It is rather the case that at the court of Herat other personalities exercised a more powerful influence on government than the ruler himself, especially hisfirstwife, Gauhar Shad, who together with her sons and a few state officials made it her business to provide for orderly continuity in the state's affairs, which contributed to the welfare of wide sections of the population. The highest offices of state had indeed been entrusted to men of unusual ability, some of whom, moreover, remained in office for a very long period, with the result that they had full scope to develop their talents. Examples are Jalal al-Din Flruz Shah, who was for thirty-five years supreme commander of the armed forces; Ghiyas al-Din Plr 'All KhwafI, who was supreme secretary for thirty-one years; and Amir 'Allka Kokultash, vizier in charge of the finances of the state for forty-three years. Shah Rukh's piety, indeed bigotry in religious matters, is well known. He regarded himself as an Islamic ruler for whose actions the prescriptions of the Sharf a were authoritative, not the Mongol traditions which had of course meant so much to Tlmur that he called himself Kiiregen (i.e. bound by marriage ties to the dynasty of Chingiz Khan) and was constantly accompanied by a Chingizid shadow khan even when he had reached the peak of his power. Shah Rukh's son Ulugh Beg adhered to this tradition in Samarqand by taking the title Kiiregen and immediately after the deposition of Khalil Sultan, whose Timurid shadow khan disappeared from Transoxiana simultaneously with him, appointed a Chingizid to be khan in Samarqand. In contrast, Shah Rukh called himself neither Khan nor Kiiregen (though he did bear the title Bahadur accorded him by Tlmur) and appointed no shadow khan in Herat.
104



ULUGH BEG
Shah Rukh's relations with China,1 in which Ulugh Beg was also involved, are renowned. They were not restricted to the exchange of ambassadors but included also trading contacts. Other commercial links, too, especially with Egypt and India, were fostered. Source material contains in addition details of the encouragement of agriculture. River control and irrigation schemes in the Herat and Marv regions are also mentioned. The reign of Shah Rukh saw significant advances in cultural life, especially in the sphere of the arts and intellectual inquiry. These included painting, especially miniatures and calligraphy, architecture,
music, historiography,2 and the law and theology of Islam. The encouragement of artistic and intellectual achievement, however, was due not only to the ruler but also to his sons and other members of the family, and to certain highly placed members of his court. The interest of Prince Balsunqur (d. 837/1433) in promoting calligraphy is well known; so, too, is the patronage at Shlraz of Prince Iskandar b. 'Umar Shaikh, one of whose proteges was the mathematician and astronomer Ghiyas al-Dln Jamshld b. Mas'ud KashI, who later lived in Samarqand. Poetry, too, in this period is marked by such distinguished names as those of the Sufi poets Qasim al-Anvar and Shah Ni'mat-Allah Vail. In addition to Persian literature the beginnings of an eastern Turkish literature are also to be discerned. Even though the cultural achievements of the Timurid age were only just moving towards their climax, however, the death of Shah Rukh saw the onset of the decline of the Timurid empire as the leading political power in Central Asia and the Near East.
ULUGH BEG AND HIS RIVALS
Shah Rukh had made no disposition for the succession, but it was understood that he would prefer to see Muhammad Juki, a man of some forty years of age then ruling as governor in Balkh, as the next occupant of the throne.

known as Ulugh Beg, survived him. Yet at the time of his father's death he was neither in the royal entourage nor in Herat. In fact he had only ever made an occasional appearance at court as a guest and had never been invited to share in the imperial government; since 812/1409 he had been merely a more or less independent local prince in Samarqand. He had up to this time had coins struck bearing the name of his father, though his edicts were issued in the name of the Chingizid shadow khan he himself appointed; and he had provided military contingents for his father's campaigns, but had never personally served in command. He appears not to have been required to make contributions to the central treasury in Herat, or at any rate he never in fact did make any. The question of the succession under the existing circumstances could have been a comparatively straightforward matter. Nevertheless, as early as 848/1444, when Shah Rukh had fallen ill and his impending death had to be reckoned with, there had been a kind of prelude to the confusions which now ensued in real earnest. At that time, Muhammad Juki had gone to Herat, hoping to succeed to his father's throne, while the troops, at the direction of Gauhar Shad, were quickly sworn in allegiance to 'Ala' al-Daula b. Balsunqur (b. 820/1417), in confident but, as things turned out, misplaced expectation of a change of ruler. The latter, together with Ulugh Beg's third son 'Abd al-Latlf, had previously been a supporter of the princess in her conduct of government affairs. It looked almost as if the demise of Shah Rukh was going to produce a repetition of what had happened at the death of Tlmur. Again there was no one outstanding figure strong enough to assert himself against the aspirations to power of the numerous princes. But there the parallel ends, for on this occasion there was nobody on the scene, like Shah Rukh in his day, to profit from the general turn of events or to enlist competent aides in order to build up a centralised administration and thereby to preserve the unity of the empire. It soon became evident, moreover, that what had been experienced at the time of Shah Rukh's illness in 848/1444, far from easing the question of the succession, had if anything exacerbated it. Gauhar Shad, who had accompanied Shah Rukh on his last campaign, induced 'Abd al-Latlf, who was also present in the royal camp, to take over supreme command of the army. Abu'l-Qasim Babur b. Balsunqur (b. 825/1422), together with Khalll Sultan b. Muhammad Jahanglr, Shah Rukh's daughter's son, plundered the main baggage-train of the army and marched to

ULUGH BEG
Khurasan. 'Ala' al-Daula, who had remained in Herat, at first played a waiting game, but then had himself proclaimed ruler when he realised how the situation was shaping. He distributed his grandfather's treasure among his troops and had Mashhad occupied. Ulugh Beg, who regarded himself as his father's only rightful successor, called his troops together and advanced as far as the Oxus. However, he found himself prevented from further immediate action because Mlrza Abu Bakr, governor of Khuttalan, Arhang and Sail Saral, had crossed the river ahead of him and occupied the region of Balkh, Shaburghan and Qunduz as far as Badakhshan and expelled his brother Muhammad Qasim, to whom Balkh had been entrusted after the death of their father Muhammad Juki. Such was the situation at the beginning of the struggles for power which developed after the death of Shah Rukh among his descendants, lasting the whole two years of Ulugh Beg's reign, and which has been described in detail by Barthold in his classic study of Ulugh Beg. In the struggle of each party against every other which now began, the fortunes of war ebbed to and fro, but no decisive victory was won, nor were clear alignments established. The various parties agreed to certain alliances, frontier settlements and other arrangements, which led in some instances to a temporary lull in hostilities. But these agreements were hardly ever kept for any length of time and their infringement in each case became the cause of renewed conflict. Various princes were captured, regained their freedom, or were killed. Ulugh Beg did achieve a certain measure of success. He contrived, for example, to foil the plans of Prince Abu Bakr b. Muhammad Juki, and in the spring of 852/1448 he won a victory over his nephew 'Ala' al-Daula at the battle of Tarnab and occupied Mashhad, while his son 'Abd al-Latlf conquered the fortress of Herat. Yet his political and military skill was nowhere near sufficient to master the complexities of the situation. The occupation of Herat, important though it was in strategic terms and still more — as the former capital — in a psychological sense, was only a step in the right direction, since he did not wish to remain there but intended to make Samarqand the capital of the Timurid empire. The military enterprises he carried out from Herat did not bring about the consolidation of his power, but rather led to the most detrimental of results for the population of Khurasan and their economic life through the devastation of the countryside which was involved. In Transoxiana at this period it was the same
107



THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
disastrous story. The continuing confusions had remained no secret to the Timurids' neighbours, especially the Tiirkmens in the west and the Uzbeks in the east. The first move was made by the Uzbek khan Abu'l-Khair, who invaded Transoxiana and marched through the region around Samarqand, looting and burning as he went. When Ulugh Beg left Herat for Samarqand late in 8 5 2/at the end of 1448, taking his father's body with him, the problems of Khurasan were no nearer solution than they had ever been, not to mention those of other parts of the empire: indeed he was not even able to march unimpeded to Transoxiana. First a detachment dispatched by Abu'l-Qasim Babur inflicted heavy losses on him; and then, to make matters worse, his troops were ambushed by the Uzbeks while crossing the Oxus before reaching their intended winter quarters at Bukhara. To summarise the first phase of the conflicts arising from the succession to Shah Rukh, it remains only to be said that two years after his death no centralised form of government had been achieved, and what was emerging was rather a tripartite division of his empire. Ulugh Beg, who may be regarded as his father's rightful successor, evidently imagining that he could make Samarqand the capital once again as in the days of his grandfather Timur, had - by yielding up Khurasan as the real base from which to extend his rule over the whole of Shah Rukh's territory - de facto limited the area of his control to Transoxiana. To begin with, Abu'l-Qasim Babur asserted himself in Khurasan, conquering both Mashhad and Herat, while 'Ala' al-Daula, after the defeat at Tarnab, was soon forced to abandon his plan of marching on Samarqand and had to be content with a small territory in south-western Afghanistan. From here he was able in the next few years to intervene in the struggle for Khurasan, but without any enduring success. Central Persia ('Iraq-i 'Ajam) and Fars passed into the control of Sultan Muhammad b. Balsunqur, who after the death of his grandfather at once emerged from his hiding-place in Luristan and played a significant part in the ensuing struggles for the succession. Finally, the supremacy of the Timurids over the Turkmen principality of the Qara Quyiinlu under Jahan Shah in north-west Persia and eastern Anatolia, which Shah Rukh had secured in three campaigns, had become virtually meaningless in the present circumstances. It was not to be long before Jahan Shah's expansionist potential would be made evident, to the detriment of the Timurids. Ulugh Beg had no further opportunity to put into effect his
108



ULUGH BEG
intention of again subjugating Khurasan in the spring of 853/1449, since his strained relations with 'Abd al-Latif, who ruled in Balkh, led to the latter breaking into open rebellion around this juncture. During his time in Herat Ulugh Beg had on various occasions humiliated his son, in connection, it would seem, with the planned transference of the capital city. When his pent-up anger was still further increased after his father's departure, the result was a military confrontation in the autumn of 85 3/1449, the consequences of which were decisive. Ulugh Beg was defeated near Samarqand at the township of Dimashq. Previously a series of uprisings had broken out in the capital against Ulugh Beg's appointed governor, his youngest and favourite son 'Abd al-'Aziz, in which it would appear that representatives of the religious classes had played some part, just as they had in the downfall of Ulugh Beg's predecessor Khalll Sultan in 811/1409. The ruler had been able to restore order, but dissatisfaction and resentment had continued. After his defeat, and plainly in association with these events, his stock had sunk so low that wherever he sought shelter he could find no refuge, not even in his own capital. He was only able to escape the imminent threat of being captured and handed over to his victorious son by voluntarily giving himself up. He received permission to undertake a pilgrimage to Mecca, as often happened in such cases, but was killed on the journey in accordance with the verdict which 'Abd al-Latif had caused to be passed on him in his absence and without his knowledge at a false trial. This was in Ramadan 853/October-November 1449. Some days later the same fate overtook 'Abd al-'AzIz; but in his case no legal means had been invoked. This sorry end after a rule of only two years, consisting of a series of political and military failures and errors, is by no means what has gone down in history as the dominant image of the man Ulugh Beg. What are remembered as significant are rather the cultural achievements brought about in the course of his reign of almost four decades as prince of Transoxiana, achievements either associated with his name or attributed to him personally. We may mention his initiation of building projects in Samarqand and Bukhara or his interest in problems of Persian poetry, which he discussed in a correspondence with his artistically inclined brother Balsunqur. Mention may also be made of the fact that certain Chaghatai poets eulogised him in Turkish verse, though it is not known what attitude he adopted towards the eastern Turkish literature which was just emerging during his lifetime. A

historical work, the Tdrikh-i arba' uliis, a history of the four states which came into being at the disintegration of the Mongol empire, is reputed to have been written at his behest. Though such interests and activities may have encouraged the view of him as "the scholar on the throne", they did not succeed in really validating it. What did, however, was his involvement in the 'uliim-i riya^Jva hukmi — the exact sciences as one would say nowadays. In this he was in line with an attitude of mind that had prevailed in the Near East, and especially in Persia, since the rule of the Mongols and amounted to a view of scientific findings as being of lasting benefit to mankind in contrast to theology and literature, whose significance in terms of time and also - on account of language differences - in terms of space could only ever be limited. Among the scholars available to provide Ulugh Beg with instruction or collaborate with him in scientific research a number of astronomers and mathematicians are noteworthy, especially Salah al-Dln Musa b. Qazlzada RumI, Ghiyas al-Dln Jamshld b. Mas'ud KashI, 'Ala' al-Dln b. Muhammad QushchI and
Mu'In al-Dln Kashanl.1 Ulugh Beg's observatory in Samarqand, dating from 823/1420, is famous (its remains were excavated in 1908); yet the period during which it was in use did not outlast the death of its founder. His writings on astronomy won him an enduring reputation. His astronomical tables, usually known as Zij-i Ulugh Beg or Zij-ijadid-i sultdni, represent a climax of achievement in that science, which declined in the Islamic world after his death. Ulugh Beg's splendid style in Samarqand did not lag behind that of the court of Herat, even in his father's lifetime. However, he found his model not in Shah Rukh but in his grandfather Tlmur. The very choice of royal title, already mentioned, reveals that his pattern was not the figure of the Muslim prince but that of the Mongol ruler, for whom the prescriptions of the Yasa rather than those of the Sharl'a were authoritative. Thus he was given to such secular delights as cannot be reconciled with the religious law of Islam. In Samarqand there were carousals with music and singing. Wealthy inhabitants of other cities even had musicians and singers of both sexes come from Samarqand. As a result of his predilection for such pleasures Ulugh Beg came into conflict with certain religious circles, not the representatives of the official theology, on whose support he could broadly count, but the

adherents of Folk Islam, as embodied in the manner of life of sufIs and dervishes, usually adherents of the Naqshbandiyya order. The situation was therefore the precise opposite of that in Islamic lands situated further west, in which the theologians figured as the guardians of the religious law, whereas sufis and dervishes gave their allegiance to more liberal notions in which the requirements of the religious law could easily be relegated to an unimportant place. Ulugh Beg was a cultured prince of keen intellectual interests; but he was not a man of action and he lacked political and military talent. Thus after a defeat which he had sustained in the spring of 830/1427 in a battle against a small force of Uzbeks he took no further part in any campaign for twenty years, and even in the dispute over the succession following the death of Shah Rukh he did not distinguish himself through bold action or strategic acumen. In contrast to his pious, not to say bigoted, father he was a man of savoir vivre and cheerful demeanour. Towards his subjects he was, it seems, an easy-going if not a popular prince. At all events, he contented himself with a modest land rate, though he insisted implacably on the tax imposed on commerce and trades, the tamghd — a tax, moreover, which conflicted with the Shari'a.
'Abd al-Latlf, who succeeded his father, was, like him, interested in secular scholarship. He introduced a stricter discipline among the population and the military than had been the case hitherto. However, by a pious personal life and respectful treatment of the dervishes he managed to secure the goodwill of those religious circles which had been offended by Ulugh Beg's habits. Since many amirs could not forget the murder of his father and brother, a conspiracy was eventually mounted against him, to which he fell victim after a reign of only six months, in Rabl' I 854/May 1450. 'Abd-Allah b. Ibrahim (b. 836/1433), another grandson of Shah Rukh, who replaced him on the throne, also enjoyed only a short reign. Earlier, Fars had been entrusted to him by his grandfather, but he had been obliged to withdraw from there in 851/1447 under attack from Sultan Muhammad's troops. As an adherent of Ulugh Beg he had been imprisoned at the latter's fall. His release and installation as sultan, for which he had to show his recognition by handsome gifts of money to the troops, did not meet with universal approval. 'Ala' al-Daula b.
in



THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
Balsunqur, whose ambitions have already been mentioned in connection with the death of Shah Rukh, rose against him, though with only passing success. Far more dangerous, however, was the reaction in Bukhara, the traditional centre of dervishism in Transoxiana. There, Abu Sa'Id b. Muhammad (b. 1424), a great-grandson of Timur of the lineage of Mlran Shah, who had also been incarcerated at the death of Ulugh Beg, was released from captivity and proclaimed ruler. After some initial setbacks he eventually marched from Tashkent to Samarqand with the military support of the Uzbek Abu'l-Khair Khan, defeated his rival in Jumada I 85 5/June 1451, took him prisoner and had him executed, causing himself to be enthroned instead. Abu Sa'Id was able to maintain his authority for some considerable time, in fact until the winter of 873/1468—9, and he even succeeded in bringing about a stabilisation of the internal situation in his dominions. However, these only embraced western Turkestan, Khurasan, Mazandaran and parts of present-day Afghanistan (Kabulistan and Zabulistan), so that it is not possible to speak of a restoration of the Timurid empire, even to the extent of Shah Rukh's territorial possessions. But even such limited successes were not achieved without warfare. Since the fall of Ulugh Beg, changes had also come about beyond Transoxiana. Sultan Muhammad b. Balsunqur, not content with Fars and 'Iraq-i 'Ajam, had advanced on Khurasan and compelled Abu'l-Qasim Babur in an initially victorious campaign culminating, in March 1450, in a battle at Mashhad, to cede to him certain parts of his domain. Somewhat later, however, the fortunes of war turned against him. Abu'l-Qasim took him prisoner and had him executed, reestablished his authority over the whole of Khurasan, and then marched to Shlraz to incorporate his vanquished opponent's lands into his own empire. He had proceeded to appoint governors for Qum and Sava when Jahan Shah of the Qara Quyunlu, who had hitherto remained loyal to the vassal relationship instituted by Shah Rukh, advanced westwards from Tabriz and threatened the two cities. His action had in a sense even been provoked by Babur, and not merely by the unstable political conditions prevailing in eastern Persia and Transoxiana; for Babur, in spite of having placed his name on the coinage and in the public prayers, the privileges of the Muslim sovereign, had merely communicated the news of his victory over Sultan Muhammad to him in a letter bearing the royal seal rather than in the form of an edict
112



{nishdn), with the demand which might be expected from a successor of Shah Rukh, to the effect that henceforth Jahan Shah must pay him tribute money (bdj), as formerly laid down by Shah Rukh, and the taxes (khardj) for the province of Azarbaljan. Babur, who had already set off to relieve Qum and Sava, was obliged to return to Herat, ostensibly because of the news of intrigues on the part of 'Ala' al-Daula, in league with the Tiirkmens, but more likely as a result of the massive onslaught of the troops led by Pir Budaq, Jahan Shah's son. The way was now wide open for the further expansion of the Qara Quyunlu. An additional factor was that they could count on a friendly attitude on the part of certain groups among the population in many places. Hardly one of the Timurid princes and other governors was able to hold at bay the Turkmen assault for any length of time. Thus in Rajab 856/August 1452 the control over almost the whole of Persia and Mesopotamia established by Ttmur seventy years before came to an end, with the exception of Abarquh, which was not taken until a year later, and Kirman, which was temporarily reconquered and was intended to have served as a base position for more ambitious operations by the Timurid forces. These losses were final, and a few thrusts against Ray at a later date could do nothing to alter the situation. An invasion of Transoxiana carried out by Babur as a reply to the conquest of Balkh by Abu Sa'Id in the spring of 858/1454 from Herat led to the siege of Samarqand. Apparently it was only under pressure from the Naqshbandl shaikh 'Ubaid-Allah Ahrar that Abu Sa'Id resolved to defend the city. But hostilities were finally brought to an end by the mutual recognition of the Oxus as frontier. This was agreed in a treaty of peace which remained effective until the death of Babur in 861/1457. Babur's successor, his eleven-year-old son Mahmud, was forced out of Herat by Ibrahim b. 'Ala' al-Daula after only a few weeks. The latter himself, however, had to flee in Sha'ban 861/July 1457 from Abu Sa'Id, who had never abandoned the idea of annexing Khurasan. Nevertheless, Abu Sa'Id did not succeed in capturing the citadel of Herat, but took up winter quarters in Balkh. The conflicts going on among the Timurids induced Jahan Shah, after his amazing successes in central Persia, Fars and Mesopotamia, to attempt further advances eastwards. Having occupied Gurgan, he defeated Ibrahim in a battle near Astarabad. The vanquished Timurid withdrew to Herat, where he was joined shortly afterwards by his father 'Ala' al-Daula and his forces. Yet there was no question of the
"3



THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
pair offering resistance to Jahan Shah, so that there was nothing left to them but flight, whilst the Turkmen prince made his entry into Herat on 15 Sha'ban 862/28 June 1458. Four months later Plr Budaq also arrived in the city with his troops, clearly in order to strengthen the Turkmen forces. Jahan Shah, now installed in the capital city of his former overlord Shah Rukh, promptly had his name incorporated into the official prayers and inscribed on the coinage. It was soon evident, however, that he had outreached himself by his advance into such remote regions. He had to contend with the same handicap as the Timurids, namely the unceasing struggle for power on the part of the princes of his own house; ambitions which were all the more dangerous for him as his capital Tabriz was so far distant. Faced with a revolt led by his son Hasan 'All, who had managed to escape from the fortress of Maku where he had been held prisoner, he saw no other course open to him but to return to Azarbaljan. Abu Sa'Id, who had not remained in ignorance of his opponent's tight situation, demanded in the ensuing negotiations that all Timurid possessions which Jahan Shah had conquered should be handed back. In the event, all he secured was the return of Khurasan. Qara Quyunlu rule over Herat remained no more than an episode in the history of the Timurids without other direct results of any consequence. No more Turkmen operations were undertaken, nor were the Turkmen governors able to hold Khurasan for any length of time after this. Quite soon, more or less friendly relations were established between Abu Sa'Id and Jahan Shah, since each of them had enough to do to keep his own house in order. Thus we know of Turkmen missions in 1461, 1463, 1465 and 1466 which were amicably received in Herat. On balance, the whole train of events had tended to consolidate the power of Abu Sa'Id. In the very next spring he defeated 'Ala' al-Daula, Ibrahim and Sultan Sanjar b. Ahmad b. 'Umar Shaikh in the vicinity of Sarakhs. He had Sanjar, who had fallen into his hands, executed, but the two other princes managed to escape. However, they both died soon afterwards, Ibrahim within only a few months and his father the following year. And as, in addition, Babur's son Mahmud met his death about this time, Abu Sa'Id was able to consolidate his power still further, being rid of so many rivals, and even to extend it to Mazandaran and Slstan. Meanwhile, Prince Husain Balqara (b. 842/1438), a grandson of 'Umar Shaikh who had formerly lived in Khwarazm, had appeared
114



upon the scene in Khurasan. After Jahan Shah's withdrawal from Herat he succeeded in defeating the latter's governor of Gurgan, Husain Beg Sa'dll, the chief of one of the most important Qara Quyunlu tribes, and taking over his territory. Although, to begin with, he recognised Abu Sa'id's sovereignty, as soon as the latter was involved in putting down a rising in Transoxiana in 1460, he lost no time in occupying Mazandaran, and in Dhu'l-Qa'da 86 5/September 1461 he laid siege to Herat. Though his successes were not permanent and he was later compelled to seek refuge again in Khwarazm, he was nevertheless able in 868/1464 to undertake a pillaging expedition to Khurasan with impunity. Abu Sa'Id had gained power with Uzbek aid. In spite of this, Uzbek incursions across the Jaxartes into Transoxiana did not cease during his reign. The same Abu'l-Khair Khan who a few years previously had supported Abu Sa'Id in his struggle against 'Abd-Allah and had then received a daughter of Ulugh Beg in marriage, was by 859/1454-5 granting Uvais b. Muhammad b. Balqara his assistance in a rising in the course of which Abu Sa'Id suffered a serious defeat. Another Timurid, Muhammad Juki b. 'Abd al-Latlf, rose in revolt in 865/1461, marched through Transoxiana pillaging as he went, and finally took up a position in Shahrukhiyya, where Abu Sa'Id besieged him from November 1462 to September 1463. The danger from the Mughals also became acute once again but receded after Abu Sa'Id had repulsed two attacks by the Chaghatayid khan Esen Buqa and from 860/1456 onwards lent his support to the latter's elder brother Yunus, whom he had recognised as joint ruler in Mughalistan. It would be wrong to conclude from the friendly relations which Abu Sa'Id maintained with Jahan Shah after 863/1458 that he had given up the idea of re-establishing Timurid rule over the territory conquered by the Tiirkmens. This was plain when early in 872/at the end of 1467 Jahan Shah, coming up against the rivalry of the Aq Quyunlu Tiirkmens, met his death in a clash with their ruler Uzun Hasan. Abu Sa'Id was quite aware that the reconquest of the Iranian territories previously lost to the Qara Quyunlu and now passing into the hands of the Aq Quyunlu might become a forlorn hope - indeed an absolute impossibility - if he did not succeed in checking the menacing rise of Uzun Hasan. In face of this danger the traditional alliance linking the Timurids with the Aq Quyunlu no longer carried much weight. Abu Sa'Id therefore embarked on a campaign to the west under the



THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
pretext of relieving Jahan Shah's son Hasan 'All, who had asked for his assistance after an unsuccessful battle against the Aq Quyunlu. Even the start of this operation, at the beginning of Sha'ban 872/end of February 1468, was clearly undertaken so impetuously and with so little planning that he did not wait for all the troops at his disposal to arrive, let alone ensure that he had adequate reserves. He did in fact manage to dislodge the Turkmen governors of 'Iraq-i 'Ajam and Fars; and elsewhere, as in Gilan, his sovereignty was once again recognised. But he continued his advance without paying due regard to establishing order in the hinterland, and failed to capture all the strongholds — Ray, for example, was one which was simply bypassed. Nor did he pay any attention to asseverations of friendship and peaceful intentions on the part of Uzun Hasan, which reached him en route. The situation for Abu Sa'id was in fact far from unfavourable. After the disastrous end of Jahan Shah there were a fair number of amirs and members of the Qara Quyunlu federation who were only awaiting the opportunity to throw in their fortunes with a new leader, especially in a campaign against Uzun Hasan. Thus when the Timurid army arrived in Miyana, Jahan Shah's son Ytisuf, a large number of amirs of the Qara Quyunlu, and troops totalling allegedly some fifty thousand men joined him; so did Prince Hasan 'All b. Jahan Shah with his son Amlrzada 'All; and when he was about to take up winter quarters on the banks of the Araxes he was joined also by the Shlrvan-Shah Farrukh-Yasar, who was in alliance with him. In spite of this accession of strength, the Timurid army found itself in a critical situation at this time, caused not only by the inclemencies of the Azarbaljan winter but also by serious supply problems. Not only were its supply routes to Khurasan - extending some 1,250 miles vulnerable in themselves, but to make matters worse Uzun Hasan succeeded within a short space of time in severing all routes by which reinforcements could be brought up. He cut off the access of supply ships from Shirvan, intercepted a supply column (Jtbakkhand) from Khurasan and mounted attacks from Ray against his enemies' communications. The lack of food and winter clothing, the loss of riding and transport animals, and the constant surprise attacks by fast raiding groups of Tiirkmens undermined the morale of the Timurid troops. When Uzun Hasan succeeded, in addition, in persuading the Shirvan-Shah to defect from Abu Sa'id and withdraw, the demoralisation of the army reached a nadir which manifested itself in numerous
116



ABU SA'lD
desertions. The depleted army marched via Ardabil, low in spirit and with little heart for fighting, into the Mughan steppes and was there met by the waiting Turkmen troops. After suffering heavy losses, Abu Sa'Id was taken prisoner. On 22 Rajab 873/5 February 1469 he was handed over to Yadgar Muhammad, a great-grandson of Shah Rukh who had sought refuge with Uzun Hasan. Yadgar Muhammad took a belated bloody revenge on him for Gauhar Shad, the energetic wife of Shah Rukh, who had been murdered in Herat twelve years previously on Abu Sa'Id's orders. With his overthrow the loss to the Timurid empire of all Persian territories west of Khurasan was finally sealed. The verdict on Abu Sa'Id as a man and a ruler is sometimes more favourable than his achievements warrant, not least because he succeeded in holding his own in the succession struggles of his day throughout eighteen years. This does not of course offset his failure to re-establish the previous extent of the empire and bring about peaceful conditions. He is best seen as a typical representative of the Turkmen military aristocracy. The main prop of his power was clearly the Turkish tribe of the Arghun, who had elected him as their chieftain and on whom he could rely in his political and military ventures. The means he used to consolidate his power was the granting of fiefs {suyurghdt), in which he indulged most liberally, and not only to leading members of the tribe, but also to his sons and to secular and religious dignitaries, to Turks and non-Turks alike. We should not fail to observe the religious element in the sultan's character. Sufi shaikhs had a considerable influence on him, especially Khwaja 'Ubaid-Allah Ahrar. He described himself as a murid of this particular dervish, who exercised absolute power in Samarqand under his government, persuaded him to reinstitute the religious law (the Sharl'a) in Samarqand and Bukhara, and even to give up the tax on commerce and trades (tamgha), which could not be reconciled with Islam. It was he, too, who fortified him in his fatal decision to undertake the campaign to the west from which he was never to return. In the domestic sphere he can be seen to have shared the kind of interest in agriculture and the welfare of the peasants which we have observed earlier in the empire of the Timurids. His measures included tax provisions favouring agriculture and improvements in the irrigation system. In this connection his vizier Qutb al-Dln SimnanI was particularly active in organising the laying of the Jul-yi Sultani to



THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
the north of Herat. Source materials also speak of peasants' revolts, however, and it therefore needs to be clarified how far these measures in the area of agricultural policy may have been inspired only as a response to uprisings and the threat of violent action on the part of desperate peasants. As there is no lack of evidence of Abu Sa'Id's cruelty we should not simply attribute his tax reductions to motives of generosity and sympathy.
With the passing of Abu Sa'Id the Timurid empire entered a new phase of disintegration. In the territory which Shah Rukh had at least nominally ruled as one whole, three independent empires now emerged: in Persia, Transcaucasia and eastern Anatolia a Turkmen empire with its capital at Tabriz, in which, however, it was no longer princes of the Qara Quyunlu who ruled, but the Aq Quyunlu Uzun Hasan, until 882/1478, and later his son Ya'qub (883-96/1478-90) and his successors; in western Turkestan, Timurid Transoxiana with its capital at Samarqand, in which Khwaja Ahrar (d. 895/1490) was the dominant figure until his death, but where sovereignty passed to the sons of Abu Sa'Id, beginning with Sultan Ahmad (b. 855/1451, ruled 873-899/1469—94); and finally Cisoxiana, i.e. the territory to the west and south-west of the Oxus together with Khurasan and the greater part of present-day Afghanistan, where the great-grandson of 'Umar Shaikh, Sultan Husain Balqara (873-911/ 1469-1506), came to power. The latter ruled in Herat, with whose attractions Samarqand had not been able to compete since the days of Shah Rukh, so that even Abu Sa'Id had transferred his seat of government there after finally managing to conquer the city in 863/1459. While Uzun Hasan was engaged in raising his empire to a position where it commended itself even to Western powers as an ally against the Ottomans, things were going steadily from bad to worse with the two Timurid principalities. They were plagued with the age-old Turkish rivalry between princes, who operated in the cities and provinces entrusted to them as governors with an independence that grew in proportion to the weakness of the central power fundamentally the inevitable result of that Turkish concept of the state referred to earlier, whereby the country did not belong to the ruler, let alone the people, but jointly to all the members of the ruling family.

TRANSOXIANA
The disintegration of power in Transoxiana was particularly drastic. Here, as previously, danger threatened from two eastern neighbours, the Uzbeks, who in 1447, under Abu'l-Khair Khan, a descendant of Shaiban (or Shiban), a son of Jochi and grandson of Chingiz Khan, had advanced their area of control at the expense of the Timurids as far as the Jaxartes; and the Mughals, who lived in the Semirechye, that is to say on the Issyk Kul and the rivers Talas, Ili, Yulduz and Manas. In spite of originally friendly relations between them, Abu Sa'Id had of course been obliged to defend himself repeatedly against Uzbek intrigues. Moreover, he had succeeded in weakening the offensive power of the Mughals by promoting the division of Mughalistan between two rival Chaghatayid princes. However, it proved to be his own protege Yunus Khan (866—892/1462-87) who later reunified the country under his rule, thus becoming so powerful that he was able to intervene in the disputes of the Timurids of western Turkestan. In this connection it should be remembered that these princes, regardless of their respective genealogies, even if they boasted descent from Chingiz Khan himself, were, like their peoples, Turks or Turkicised. It is doubtful, even in the case of the inhabitants of Mughalistan, who called themselves Mongols and were thus designated by other ethnic groups, whether by this time they spoke the Mongol language. Yunus Khan, whom we have mentioned, had spent long years in Persia in his youth and had there acquired a degree of cultivation thanks to which he is described as the "most educated Mongol of all time". Sultan Ahmad's brother 'Umar Shaikh, who ruled as prince of Farghana from Andijan (not to be confused with Tlmur's son of the same name, who had similarly governed Farghana in his day), maintained friendly relations with him. 'Umar's wife, Qutluq Nigar Khanum, the khan's sister, was the mother of his son Zahlr al-Dln Muhammad Babur (b. 888/1483), who was thus descended on his father's side from Timur and on his mother's from Chingiz Khan: he later became the founder of the dynasty and empire of the Great Mughals in India. The fall of Abu Sa'Id had been preceded in 872-3/1468 by the death of the Shaibanid Abu'l-Khair Khan. After years of heavy righting with the Oirats pressing forward from western Mongolia he had finally been defeated and done away with by members of his own family who had earlier defected from him and taken up their abode in Mughalistan. In the same year his son Shaikh Haidar had met his death in a conflict with Yunus Khan. Thus the Uzbek menace to the Timurids had been
119



THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
brought under control, but only temporarily. A grandson of Abu'l-Khair named Muhammad ShaibanI (b. 855/1451) had managed to survive after the death of his grandfather and uncle, until he found the opportunity of re-establishing himself in a position of power in the service of Mahmud b. Yunus Khan. When he finally marched across the Jaxartes into western Turkestan, there arose once more an Uzbek dominion: it was to spread rapidly at the expense of the Timurids, who were prevented from taking effective counter-measures by incessant family strife, and was to provide the basis for a powerful empire that endured for a century and played a significant role in the history not only of Central Asia but also of Iran. Muhammad Shaibanfs objective was of course Samarqand. At the same time, he had a Timurid competitor in Prince Babur, of whom mention has just been made and who had succeeded his father in Andijan in 899/1494, when the latter was killed in an accident. His uncle Sultan Ahmad promptly marched against him to take possession of Farghana, since 'Umar Shaikh had withdrawn from his obedience under the protection of his Mughal allies and had even made attacks on territories belonging to Samarqand; but Babur was saved by Sultan Ahmad's sudden death in the course of his advance. Since his brother Mahmud, who succeeded him, died in the following year and none of the sons of Sultan Ahmad was able to hold his own, Babur occupied Samarqand in 903/1497, but then had to yield it up on account of a conspiracy in Andijan. The partition of Farghana which he arranged with his brother Jahanglr (who enjoyed the support of the Mughals) provided him with a free hand for a new move against Samarqand in competition with Muhammad ShaibanI, in which he was, however, defeated. In 905/1500 the Uzbeks conquered Samarqand, and in the course of the fighting the ruling Timurid Sultan 'All lost his life. But shortly afterwards Babur succeeded in taking the city by means of a coup de main. In Ramadan 906/April—May 1501, however, he was defeated at the battle of Sar-i Pul by the Uzbeks, following which he had to abandon Samarqand to them again. They were now able to establish a firm hold on Transoxiana, while he himself, losing even his homeland of Farghana, which Jahanglr now claimed for himself alone, set off on his celebrated wanderings and was not able to gain a foothold until 910/1504, in Kabul. Here, two years later, a plea for help reached him from Husain Balqara of Herat, who was now also being hard pressed by the Uzbeks.
120



HUSAIN BAIQARA
HUSAIN BAIQARA
We must now trace out the beginnings of the Timurid empire of Herat, which had arisen shortly after the death of Abu Sa'Id. That state also had to struggle against heavy odds but, in contrast to the Timurid empire in Transoxiana, it was distinguished by great achievements in the sphere of intellectual and material progress, a continuation for more than three decades of the great age which had begun under Shah Rukh and which had given the state of Herat that characteristic stamp that now reached its ultimate development under the rule of the Timurid Husain Balqara. Sultan Husain b. Mansur b. Balqara, to give him his full name, had lost his father when he was only seven or eight years;of age, and in 856/1452 had entered the service of Abu'l-Qasim Babur, interrupted for a brief time only after the latter's unsuccessful campaign against Samarqand. After the death of his master he led the irregular life of a wandering mercenary captain, the kind of man frequently found over the years among the auxiliary troops of various Timurids engaged in their struggles for power, until he eventually began to wage war on his own account, for a long time indeed without lasting success. To begin with, his interests lay in Mazandaran, then particularly in Khwarazm, whence he repeatedly set out on invasions or pillaging expeditions into Khurasan. These won him the enmity of Abu Sa'Id, against whom he sought assistance from the Uzbek khan Abu'l-Khair. However, his overtures were brought to nothing by the latter's death, to which we have referred.
With the news of Abu Sa'Id's fall, a situation had therefore arisen in which Husain Balqara was no longer dependent on Uzbek aid. Seeing his opportunity, he forthwith exploited it. On 25 Sha'ban 873/10 March 1469 the news reached Herat of the events in the Mughan steppes; on 2 Ramadan/16 March Sultan Mahmud, a son of the executed prince, arrived in the city with the remnants of his father's army, but had to quit it again shortly afterwards; and only a week later the official prayers were proclaimed in the name of Husain Balqara, who had meanwhile made his entry into the city. Although Sultan Ahmad was already approaching Herat with a powerful force from Samarqand, he broke off his campaign to Khurasan after meeting up with his brother Mahmud en route.
Nevertheless, Husain Balqara's succession did not remain undisputed. Uzun Hasan did not fail to exploit his victory over Abu
121



THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
Sa'Id. He transferred his capital from Diyarbakr to Tabriz, and not only occupied 'Iraq-i 'Ajam, Fars and Kirman but also declared Yadgar Muhammad, the prince who had put Abu Sa'Id to death, as the only legitimate heir to the throne, sending him off with the Timurid soldiery who were in his company at the time to Khurasan. A victory which Husain Balqara scored over him at Chinaran on 8 Rabf I 874/15 September 1469 proved indecisive, because Uzun Hasan promptly sent reinforcements to the aid of his protege. It was plainly his intention to extend his influence, if not his sovereignty, over Khurasan. Thus he demanded from Husain Balqara, in vain as it turned out, the handing over of various Qara Quyunlu amirs who had fled to Herat while he was occupying Kirman. When Uzun Hasan's sons Zainal and Khalll were brought in to support Yadgar Muhammad, Husain Balqara found himself in a critical situation. So many of his troops deserted to the enemy that he even had to abandon Herat, where his rival made his entry on 9 Muharram 875/8 July 1470. The latter, in fact, could not rely on his troops either, especially the contingents of the Aq Quyunlu, so that Husain Balqara, having assembled fresh forces and having met the three sons of Abu Sa'Id in a victorious engagement, reoccupied his capital six weeks later. Yadgar Muhammad, who fell into his hands, was executed, and with him the last descendant of Shah Rukh left the political stage. Since the line of Jahanglr had ceased to play a political role only a few years after the death of Tlmur, the activity of Tlmur's heirs was now restricted to descendants of his two sons MIran Shah and 'Umar Shaikh - that is to say, respectively the scions of Abu Sa'Id in Transoxiana, of whom only Babur had a significant future, and Husain Balqara and his family in Khurasan. With the death of Yadgar Muhammad the designs of Uzun Hasan on Khurasan likewise came to an end. There were no further attempts to extend his territorial power over eastern Persia. And Husain Balqara, too, refrained from any move against his western neighbour. His frontier with the empire of the Aq Quyunlu followed from the coast of the Caspian Sea a line west of Astarabad running in a southerly direction, then ran along the edge of the Dasht-i Lut, finally reaching Lake Hamun. Both parties were intent on good-neighbourly relations, which were not affected by occasional frontier incidents. Though he had achieved signal distinction through his courage and enterprise before his accession to the throne, Husain Balqara seems henceforth to have yielded to no further desire for military enterprises of any scope. Thus he substantially respected the Oxus frontier,
122



HUSAIN BAIQARA
though the incessant conflicts of his cousins beyond the river and their military weakness in fact represented a constant invitation to intervene. This is all the more remarkable since from his own experience and acquaintance with the personalities of the situation he knew only too well what dangers were lurking in the background; that is to say, how strongly the peoples who lived on the Jaxartes, particularly the Uzbeks, were pressing towards the west and developing into an immediate threat to him personally with every success they scored in western Turkestan. Before he found himself in direct confrontation with the Uzbeks at the end of his life, only incidents of a more or less limited significance took place on the Oxus frontier, with one exception: the campaigns carried out by Khurasan forces against the Timurid Sultan Mahmud ruling in Hisar. These in fact fruitless operations were connected with the conflicts which Husain Balqara had to fight out against his sons, especially in the second half of his reign. Fundamentally, the cause yet again was always the question of the authority enjoyed by the Timurid princes who ruled in the most important cities; a perpetual temptation to challenge the central power as soon as differences of opinion with the ruler arose. As early as 1490 Darvlsh 'All, a brother of'AH Shir (see below), had - as guardian of Prince Ibrahim Husain, a son of Husain Balqara who had his residence in Balkh - intrigued with Hisar, which apparently led to a campaign against the city. Years later, in the course of a further campaign, Husain Balqara's eldest son Badf al-Zaman was transferred from his governorship in Astarabad to Balkh and rose in rebellion when his son Muhammad Mu'min, whom he had left behind in Astarabad, was passed over for appointment as governor there. Badl' al-Zaman was defeated in battle, and chance decreed that his son, who had also risen in rebellion and had consequently been imprisoned in Herat, was executed at about the same time, though this had no connection with his father's defeat. A reconciliation was brought about, but this revolt was not the last, and in 1499 the prince even besieged Herat. Other sons, too, rose against the ageing ruler. As a result, there were frequent occasions for military operations but no upheavals, apparently, serious enough to endanger the state. We have detailed knowledge of the Turkish and Persian figures of eminence in the empire on whom Husain Balqara depended in the business of government, even down to the details of court intrigues. Among these figures, one personality stands out, a man of distinction in both political and intellectual history. This is 'All Shir Nava'I
I23



THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
(b. 844/1441), who had been closely connected with Husain Balqara even in his youth. He was a Turk born in Herat who had been present at Sultan Ahmad's headquarters in 873/1469 and arrived in the capital only a few weeks after Husain's accession to the throne. He was appointed keeper of the great seal, and in 876/1472 member {divan begt) of the great state council {divdn-i bu^urg-i amdraf). The influence he exerted was so powerful that he is referred to as second only to the prince. In the course of time relations between ruler and adviser did indeed become strained, and this state of affairs took some years to pass, with 'All Shir Nava'I in 892/1487 going to Astarabad as governor for fifteen months. The high esteem in which he was held, which incidentally is not to be dissociated from his achievements in the cultural sphere, was strikingly evident in the ceremonies of mourning ordered by the prince on the occasion of his death in 906/1501. The year 1501 ushered in a new era for both Central Asia and the Middle East involving the fall of the Timurids and the rise of new powers. It saw the consolidation of Uzbek power, as has been mentioned above, resulting from Muhammad Shaibanl's final conquest of Samarqand, and the accession of Shah Isma'H I, with which the Safavid empire began. Husain Balqara, who had moved further and further away from the military prowess of his youth in the three decades of his rule in Herat, was prevented by advanced age and protracted illness from taking energetic decisions. As may be seen from his correspondence, he was at pains to avoid conflict with Shah Isma'Il. For a long time — far too long, in fact — he closed his eyes to the immediate threat of a massive attack on the part of the Uzbeks, whose successes in Transoxiana could of course have been no secret to him, and trusted in his fortresses which barred the way to Khurasan. Even Babur's attempt to spur him to action against the common enemy was unable to prevail against this view. So it came about that the Uzbeks were able to cross the Oxus, conquering Khwarazm and carrying out pillaging expeditions against Khurasan. Husain Balqara did not live to see the collapse of his empire. He died on 11 Dhu'l-Hijja 911/4 May 1506, having finally marched against the Uzbeks. It was just at this very time that Babur was making preparations to answer the appeal for help that he had received from Herat by advancing from Kabul with his troops. Though he received the news of Husain Balqara's death en route, he continued his march until, after four months, he reached his objective. In his memoirs he records of Badl' al-Zaman and Muzaffar Husain, two sons of the
124



EARLY CAREER OF BABUR
dead prince who were at odds over the succession, that they were no doubt experienced in matters of court ceremonial but not in the rules of warfare. Judging the military situation to be hopeless, he retreated without waiting to clash with Muhammad Shaibanl. In the very next year he received news of the Uzbeks' entry into Herat and theflightof Husain Balqara's sons. Muzaffar Husain did not long survive the disaster; his brother found refuge first at the court of Shah Isma'Il and afterwards in Istanbul, where he died in 923/1517. It stands to the credit of Husain Balqara that in the thirty-seven years of his rule in Herat he gave the Timurid empire, in spite of everything, fairly peaceful conditions, albeit within a severely reduced area. Babur speaks of his reign as a wonderful period, in which many significant men lived in Khurasan. The able warrior he is described as being in the first half of his life was not only a famous sabre-fighter who plunged fearlessly into hand-to-hand fighting in battle, but also a cultivated man, actively interested in the intellectual and artistic life of his time, and a renowned patron of the arts. He himself wrote Turkish and Persian poetry under the pseudonym of Husainl. It should, however, be said that his Turkish divan, which has come down to us, contains only poems of average merit. He also left behind a brief treatise in which his opinions and ideals are set out. He does not appear to have been strongly committed in a religious sense. He was entitled to plead the rheumatism he suffered from for years as an excuse for neglecting the prescribed prayers; but this and similar excuses cannot account for offences against the laws of fasting or for other derelictions from the religious law which appealed to him, such as daily indulgence in wine, pigeon-flying, ram-fighting and cock-fighting. His lack of political acumen and his all but apathetic absence of resolution in dealing with the Uzbeks — among the main contributory factors in the fall of the Timurid empire — may have been signs of senility, for he was generally credited with an alert mind which found expression not only in rapid utterance but also, at the beginning of his career, in swift decision.
THE EARLY CAREER OF BABUR
The Uzbek conquest of Khurasan need not in itself have signified the end of the Timurids in Central and Western Asia, for Zahlr al-Dln Babur was still ruling in Kabul. Indeed, the idea of a Timurid restoration in these territories remained alive in him, and he was to be pre
125



THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
sented with the necessary opportunity a few years later, on the fall of Muhammad ShaibanI. Although an incursion into India in 910/1505 shows a new direction of his ambitions, the march on Herat which he carried out at Husain Balqara's request reveals his sense of involvement in the Timurid heartlands and his hatred for the Uzbeks who had expelled him from them. In the fresh circumstances he was once again threatened in Kabul by the same enemy, and from two directions: in the north from Qunduz and the province of Badakhshan, and in the south-west from Qandahar. To begin with, he had to witness his younger brother Nasir Mlrza falling back before the Uzbeks in Badakhshan. And when Muhammad ShaibanI also laid siege to Qandahar, Babur does seem temporarily to have given his cause up for lost. At all events he took care to evacuate his men from Kabul in order to march on India. Only because he was prevented from making a rapid advance by ambushes mounted by Afghan tribes did he learn en route that due to difficulties in the hinterland the Uzbeks had raised the siege of Qandahar after offering easy conditions to the besieged troops. At once he returned to Kabul. Here he received news, some time later, of Shah Isma'H's victorious campaign against Khurasan, the battle of Marv, in which Muhammad ShaibanI had been killed on 1 Ramadan 916/2 December 1510, and the entry of Isma'Il into Herat. In spite of the winter conditions he at once set off for Transoxiana. In Qunduz, where he was held up by Uzbek resistance, he was joined by his sister Khanzada Begum, whom he had agreed to marry off to Muhammad ShaibanI when he had been forced to give up Samarqand. She had fallen into the hands of the Persians at Marv and had now been sent to him by the shah. To this gesture of amity he responded by sending Prince MIrza Khan on a mission with presents and felicitations. The shah confirmed the ambassador in the governorship of Badakhshan and gave an assurance that Babur should retain all the territories in Transoxiana he could take from the Uzbeks — on condition, however, that he converted to the Shi'a. Babur accepted, although of course this implied recognising the sovereignty of the Safavids. On his advance through Transoxiana he took Hisar and Bukhara. In Rajab 917/October 1511 he occupied Samarqand - for the third time - but was compelled to evacuate the city again in the following Safar/May after a reverse in battle with the Uzbeks. Meanwhile, the initial jubilation at his return had subsided, and indeed had turned to disaffection and hatred, because the SunnI population could not come to terms with the Shi'a. Though nothing more than
126



TIMURID POLITICAL TRADITIONS
mere verbal assent was involved for Babur, the official prayers did include the name of Shah Isma'Il, whose brutal treatment of eminent Sunnis in Herat was common talk; and also the Shl'I confession of faith. The same objections no doubt applied to the inscriptions on the coinage. Shortly afterwards, with the arrival of Persian auxiliaries under Isma'Il's viceroy (vakil) Yar Ahmad KhuzanI, known as Najm-i
sani,1 Babur realised that his position had become untenable. It was not merely that he was to be subjected to the military authority of the Persian general; the latter inspired terror and revulsion in the people as a whole for having, against Babur's advice, slaughtered the entire population of the city of QarshI which he had conquered. Thus at the battle of Ghujduvan on 3 Ramadan 918/12 November 1512, Babur held back. The Uzbeks were victorious and the Safavid general was killed; while Babur withdrew in all haste. He remained in fact in Badakhshan for some considerable time after this before admitting to himself that there was no future for him in Transoxiana and Khurasan. After 920/1514, the year of his return to Kabul, he turned his whole attention to India and undertook several campaigns in that direction, until on 8 Rajab 932/20 April 15 26 he won a decisive victory against Ibrahim LodI, the sultan of Delhi, at the battle of Panlpat. This was the moment at which the Mughal empire was born, a Timurid state founded on Indian soil, which endured until the 13 th/19th century. And though parts of Afghanistan, and Kabul, which was not lost until it was conquered by Nadir Shah in 1738, belonged to this empire, the fact is that its centre of gravity lay in India. This state of affairs was not altered by occasional later thrusts towards Khurasan and Transoxiana, which led at best to ephemeral successes. In Central and Western Asia the Timurids had ceased to play a vital part on the political scene in 913/1507, with the Uzbek victory over the sons of Husain Balqara, and at the latest with the return of Babur to Kabul in 920/1514.
THE POLITICAL TRADITIONS OF THE TIMURID EMPIRE
What, then, are the characteristic features of this Timurid period? The state which Timur had left to his successors was made up,
according to Barthold,2 from components derived from the TurcoMongolian military system, and ample trimmings of Islamic culture,

THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
generally of a Persian cast. The relationship of these elements to one another varied in the different states deriving from the Timurid empire according to the attitudes and inclinations of the particular ruler at any one time. An extreme example of this is found in the reign of Ulugh Beg in Samarqand. During the lifetime of his father Shah Rukh, who ruled strictly according to the prescriptions of the Sharl'a, he was able to promote his own enthusiasm for the Yasa and the tradition of Chingiz Khan in the management of the state. If this was possible in an area loyal to the central government, it is all the more likely that in the Timurid states of later times, each leading an independent existence from the others, certain differences will have been found. The main reason for the obvious lack of success with which the Timurids had to contend in Azarbaijan and Iran was the rise of the Turkmens, firstly the Qara Quyunlii and then the Aq Quyiinlu. It may be the case that the stimulus which came to these two nomadic federations to strive for independence was partly due in the first
instance to the destructions wrought by Tlmur,1 for example in eastern Anatolia and Azarbaijan; though hardly in Iran, where the details given by the Spanish ambassador Clavijo concerning the cities he visited shortly before Timur's death preclude the possibility that these had been devastated or not rebuilt. Of smaller significance were the nomadic tribes in western Turkestan and - less still - in Khurasan. Nevertheless, there still existed, as in Timur's day, nomadic tribes originally Mongol in descent which had become Turkish in culture, certainly in respect of speech, though we should be cautious in the assessment of their ethnic composition. This nomadic element was referred to in Transoxiana as Chaghatai, after Chaghatai (d. 639/1242), the second son of Chingiz Khan, even long after there were any surviving khans of this dynasty in western Turkestan. The most important of these tribes were according to the account given by Ibn 'Arabshah - the Arlat in the northern part of present-day Afghanistan, the Jalayir in the region of Khujand, and the Barlas on the Qashqa-Darya. Their chiefs had extensive sovereign rights in the areas in which they lived. Still stronger was the position of those Timurid princes who, as joint or autonomous rulers, were appointed as governors in individual provinces. We have referred a number of times to the conception
1 This is at any rate the reasoning of Cahen, Der Islam i, 3} i.

TIMURID POLITICAL TRADITIONS
underlying their legal position, namely that the empire was not the sole possession of the ruler but belonged to all male members of the ruling family, and have drawn attention to the fateful results which followed from this assumption. Taken together with the absence of an effective disposition for the succession, this conception led to unending disputes over the rightful inheritance and to the fragmentation and diminution of the territory as a whole. At the same time, military strength crumbled, and when powerful opponents took the offensive, disaster followed. One of the basic features of the Timurid state was feudalism, the material foundation of the military. The prime beneficiaries were the princes and those holding high military command, including tribal chieftains. From the beginning of Shah Rukh's reign we come across the institution known as the suyurghal, a further development of the
earlier iqtS. Etymologically, as we have seen,1 this suggests a beneficium, an "act of largesse" or "reward" on the ruler's part towards persons employed in his service. De facto it was the granting of a territory as a fief, especially a military fief, which carried the obligation to serve in the army of one's lord and at the same time to make available a fixed number of armed warriors. In return, the fiefholder was guaranteed freedom from rates and taxes in his own territory but allowed the right to raise such contributions for his own benefit from the population, who of course did not share the privilege of this freedom. Unlike the iqta', this immunity not only applied to the fiscal sovereignty of the central authorities but extended also to their administrative and judicial sovereignty. A typical feature of the Timurid administration was the existence of extremely large fiefs of this kind embracing whole provinces. In time, the suyurghal acquired a hereditary character and was not restricted to military beneficiaries, being accorded also to civilians such as the holders of religious offices and dignities.
The organisation of the Timurid governmental machinery has been only inadequately researched as yet. Although it cannot be assumed that it remained even in broad outline uniform throughout the whole period from 807/1405 to 913/1507 or even among the various states existing alongside each other, we may nevertheless reasonably infer that certain basic characteristics were common, for instance the influences exerted by the different elements in the population on the organisation of the communities, or at any rate the Turkish/Persian dichot

THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
omy. A brief consideration of the most important authorities among the supreme imperial institutions under Husain Balqara gives the easiest
general picture.1 The supreme body in the Herat administration was the Great State Council {divdn-i bu^urg-i amdrat) already mentioned. As the designation divdn-i amdrat-i tuvdjiydn is also found, it is to be assumed that
it was identical with the tuvdji divdnifrequently referred to.2 Among yet other titles for the same institution, tiirk divdni'is especially interesting as a reflection of the responsibility for army matters: the army was of course composed mainly of Turks and Turkicised Mongols. It was a sort of general staff with additional functions corresponding to the increased importance of the forces in maintaining a state constantly threatened by external and internal enemies. Its members were amirs ( = begs) with the title amir-i tuvdjiot divan begi. They took precedence in rank over all other amirs. As inspectors of troops they had a wide area of responsibility. At court or in the military headquarters this included preparing and carrying out the receptions and parades given by the ruler. The secretaries of this divan were called bakbshiydn or navisandagdn-i turk, never va^ir. Of course, there were also viziers; but they were responsible for the financial affairs that fell within the competence of another divan, the divdn-i mdl, which appears to have been identical with the divdn-i 'dli and was also called sart divdni in order to distinguish it from the tiirk divdni. In contrast to the "Turkish secretaries" just referred to, in the case of this divan only the term "Persian secretaries" was used {navisandagdn-i tajik). At its head stood the amir-i divdn-i mdl. The superior status of the tuvajl dlvani is suggested by the fact that it was also called the supreme divan (divdn-i a'la). This interpretation of the source material, incidentally, is not upset if we adopt the explanation of the function of the Great Amir {ulugh beg), who is sometimes referred to, as that of supreme head of both the divans we have considered. It must be admitted, though, that the schema suggested here need not offer the only possible explanation for what is a highly complex set of facts.
ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL LIFE
The economic life of the Timurid age was not so darkened by the destructions carried out by Tlmur as might be imagined. In this connection the particularism of the Timurid princes and governors even

ECONOMIC LIFE
had favourable results; for they had a strong vested interest in rebuilding the cities which were their seats of government and - in the economic sphere - of putting the political, and more especially the cultural, aspirations which most of them cherished on a sound footing. In most comparisons made of the cruelty and destructive fury of Tlmur with that of the Mongols, Tlmur comes off badly. Yet it is a fact that the desolation he wrought did not have such a lasting effect as those for which they had been responsible. Whereas whole cultivated areas were destroyed and reduced to pastureland as a result of Mongol campaigns, under Tlmur public order was at any rate to some extent soon restored after the cessation of hostilities. Where the irrigation systems vital to agriculture had deteriorated as a result of devastation or lack of attention, they were put in order without delay. It is known of a number of rulers, for instance Shah Rukh, Ulugh Beg and Abu Sa'Id, that they paid particular attention to the irrigation system and were renowned for their construction of famous installations. The holders of fiefs and benefices also had an interest in the development of the territories whose taxes and rates were under their control. There is evidence of specific measures to encourage agriculture in many places, not only in Transoxiana and Khurasan, but for example also in the vicinity of Isfahan. In some places the pre-Mongol standard was reached or even surpassed. However, there were areas in which the destructions of the Mongols could not be made good. Care for agriculture is seen as one of the characteristic features of Timurid rule. Nevertheless, arbitrary increases in the rates imposed and abuses in the taxation system on occasion caused distress and poverty among the
peasantry, sometimes proving so oppressive that revolts broke out.1 Under the Timurids there was a commercial life which was as active as it was important, and which did not stop at the frontiers. Tabriz, due to its peripheral situation, was indeed.not able to continue to play the same part in east-west trade as it had under the Mongols. Even the trade relations with Byzantium, the Ottomans and the Mamluks in Egypt were now necessarily based on other routes. The trade routes to the east and the north, to China and the Golden Horde, ran via Samarqand and in part also via Herat, which was in addition an important stage on the trade route via Kabul to and from India. The ortaq system provided a remarkable trading institution. By means of this, merchant entrepre

neurs invested loan capital for orders and for the benefit of their financial backers, of whom quite often the ruler himself was one. In the taxation system Mongol traditions were quite unmistakably preserved: payments in kind made by the agricultural section of the population, and trade and craft taxes (tamgha) in the towns, levied to some extent as local and transit tolls. We do in fact often hear of such levies being waived or reduced, either because of the results of natural catastrophes, epidemics or crop failures, or for religious reasons on the occasions when a pious mystic or a theologian succeeded in steering his ruler back onto the path of the religious law (Sharl'a), whose prescriptions condemned such sources of revenue. But this sort of concession was rarely permanent; with the best will in the world, the rulers could usually not manage to forgo the tamgha, the most productive of all the taxes. Even the pious Shah Rukh went no further than giving a semblance of legality when he attempted to declare trading taxes to be alms levies (p^akdi) — by a simple change of terminology — just in order to rescue them from the odium of illegality that attached to the tamgha. What has been said here of the restoration of public order, the recouping of losses due to destruction at the hands of Tlmur, and the rebuilding of cities does not by any means imply that in Central and Western Asia under the Timurids peaceful and prosperous conditions everywhere prevailed. The long reigns of Shah Rukh, Abu Sa'id, and Husain Balqara did in each case bring about a certain stabilisation of affairs in comparison with earlier times and the intervening periods. Nevertheless, in view of the incessant risings, the incursions by the Tiirkmens in the west and the Uzbeks and Mughals in the east, the endless succession disputes and the concomitant military measures, troop movements, requisitionings and reprisals, it is not reasonable to speak of general peace and prosperity, even though the conjunction of all these things was generally confined to a few limited areas. The sufferings of the people in the districts and cities affected were protracted and had long-lasting effects. In the first half of the 9th/15 th century reports from the province of Kirman speak of the constant
insecurity to which daily life was subject.1 Here even a town such as Bam, described by Arabian geographers as a flourishing city with an important textile industry, fell back into village conditions with a mere four or five thousand inhabitants. In Khurasan, too, a decline in

population density in contrast with the Mongol period can be observed which is recognisable in the changes that took place in the territorial
pattern.1 The constituent units of Timurid territory were larger than those of the Mongols; and the reason for older administrative units having been abandoned is clearly to be sought in a considerable reduction in the size of populations. Quhistan, for instance, formerly the largest district (yilayat) belonging to Herat, was now no longer a unit administratively speaking, but only geographically.
RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL ACTIVITY
This somewhat grim background of general conditions is eminently important for an understanding of the religious situation of the Timurid period. It is undoubtedly true to say that the larger part of the population should be thought of as belonging to a SunnI form of Islam, yet this is an inadequate description of the pattern. Even the limitation that individual areas such as Gllan, Mazandaran, Khiizistan and eastern Quhistan, and a few cities such as Ray, Varamln, Qum, Kashan, and Sabzavar in Khurasan, were traditional centres of the ShI'a — and especially of the Twelver ShI'a - amounts to no more than a rough amplification of what is only a crude sketch. In reality, it was a far more complicated matter. The facts show that much of the Islamic world was vigorously involved in religious change. This begins at the latest with the disappearance from the scene of the 'Abbasid caliphate, the rule of the Mongols and the resulting curtailment of the influence of the theologians in the Islamic east. The most important aspects of these changes were numerous manifestations of popular piety, an increase in Islamic monasticism (Jdriqa, tasavvuf), veneration of the saints, pilgrimages, belief in miracles, veneration of 'All and the ahl al-bait generally. Such phenomena often bore a Shl'I stamp, but this is far from justifying the conclusion that they are evidence for religious assent and adherence to the ShI'a. For some time past the term Folk Islam has been applied to this kind of phenome
non,2 usually in reference to conditions in Asia Minor; but there is no lack of convincing evidence for an analogous development further to the east, in the dominions of the Timurids.

THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
The oscillation between Sunna and Shl'a typical of Folk Islam also exercised a powerful influence on the political potentates of the age. The traditional formula which speaks of the Shl'I Qara Quyunlu and the SunnI Aq Quyunlu can now no longer be sustained in its former
exclusive sense.1 It is undoubtedly truer to say that the princes of the two federations were hardly concerned about a religious issue but far more about political ones when they sought to achieve assent and more effective support among the population by favouring one side or the other. Similar motives of expediency — in addition to personal preferences, no doubt — may explain something of Abu Sa'Id's adherence to the Naqshbandiyya, the order of Khwaja Ahrar, who was omnipotent in Samarqand and indubitably persecuted SunnI attempts at a restoration of the Shari'a; or again, it would seem, when Husain Baiqara, who after his succession to the throne in Herat had taken the first steps to introduce the Shl'a, then abandoned the project at the instigation of 'All Shir; not to mention Zahlr al-Dln Babur's conversion to the Shl'a on his third conquest of Samarqand, when his only concern was to secure the support of Shah Isma'Il for his plans. All in all there developed in the atmosphere of Folk Islam favourable preconditions for heterodox tendencies and hence also for the Shl'a, either because it formed a bridge to the popular variant of Shl'a and thus advanced the Imamiyya, or because it prepared the ground for extremist sects, which in the course of the 9th/15 th century attracted
many new adherents and had far-reaching effects.2 The underground political-cum-religious activities of the time are vividly projected for a moment on 22 RabT 11 830/21 February 1427 by an attempt on the life of Shah Rukh, when an adherent of the Hurufiyya attempted to stab
him as he was leaving the Friday prayers.3 This was by no means the first outbreak of heretical violence. It had been preceded by religiously inspired risings, immediately after the death of Tlmur, in Sabzavar, where Shah Rukh had only been able to exert his authority with difficulty, and a year later in Mazandaran, where an attempt was made to re-establish the amirate of the Shl'I Mar'ashI Sayyid. One rising

which was successful, at least against the Timurid governor of Fars and Khuzistan, was that of Sayyid Muhammad b. Falah (845/1441—2), who claimed to be the Mahdl and who made the city of Havlza the official seat of an extremist provincial dynasty, the Musha'sha', which even
outlasted theTimurids.1 It must also be assumed that the revolt of Muhammad b. Balsunqur in 849/1446 had a religious background. This would also explain the severity of Shah Rukh, unusual for him in his dealings with Islamic aristocrats and scholars {sddat and 'ulamd'), when in Ramadan 850/December 1446 in Sava his verdicts on the adherents of the rebellious prince — to the horror of many contemporaries — did not spare this category of persons the penalty of execution. In fact he thus dealt a severe blow to the Shi'a, which was spreading rapidly in Fars, as elsewhere, from which it could not easily recover. This action of his is intimately connected with his religious attitudes and the role as restorer of orthodoxy and protector of the SunnI theologians which he had assumed. Even though it is difficult, and in many cases impossible, to classify individuals or indeed even particular orders as to their religious attitude — Sunna or Shi'a — this does not mean that all the distinctions were simply blurred. Orthodox theology existed under the Timurids as it had before. It had indeed passed its ultimate climax with 'Azud al-DIn al-ljl (d. 756/135 5), who had gathered its doctrines together in a
new form in his Mawdqij — and in a challenging fashion.2 His ideas were, moreover, still widespread among the theologians of the 9th/15 th century. But they had long since ceased to be productive and had petrified into merely scholastic forms. With a few exceptions - one of them the Suliik al-muluk of Fazl-Allah b. Ruzbihan al-Khunji, written in the Fiirstenspiegel tradition — the theological writings of the period have nothing to offer but commentaries and super-commentaries in devastating quantity, and glosses and manuals which in their use of abbreviations are barely comprehensible to the modern reader.
To be brief, the representatives of the Sunna were in no position to have their own way in the conflict with the rising tide of Shl'I or heretical movements. The decisive blow was struck, as far as large areas of the Timurid territory were concerned, when one of these movements, that of the Safavids, succeeded in Persia in forcing through its religious ideas against the Sunna by the use of the military

might which it had acquired through the support of fanatical adherents. However, it was unsuccessful against the mortal enemies of the Timurids, the Uzbeks, who now became the protective power of orthodoxy in the eastern Islamic world. The results of these events were, however, only clearly perceptible after the fall of the Timurid states of Central and Western Asia. The intellectual life of the Timurid age may be traced through the ample evidence which has come down to us, the most noteworthy source being Daulatshah of Samarqand. If their best historians do not quite approach the leading figures of Mongol historiography, they did leave behind works of a highly respectable quality. Their most important writers include such names as Hafiz-i Abru (d. 833/1430), 'Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandl (d. 887/1482) and Mir Khwand (d. 903/1498). The lastnamed chronicler not only soon aroused the interest of historically minded groups in the Ottoman empire, but later intensively occupied Western historians, as can be seen by the numerous translations of his work, especially in the last century. Hafiz-i Abru offers in his works interesting evidence of the historical method and the historical interests of the age. His Majmita embraces twelve works, of which a majority are based on earlier authors and the rest are his own work. His Majmd al-tavarikh with its four parts is a universal history, the fourth section of which, separately entitled Zubdat al-tavarikh-i Batsunquri, contains the history of Shah Rukh up to 830/1427. 'Abd al-Razzaq's work, entitled Matla' al-sa'dain, is also in the nature of a universal history. Its treatment of the Timurid period is based primarily on Hafiz-i Abru and is a valuable source in itself for the events which its author experienced in person. Since the Timurid historical writings were mainly, if not exclusively, commissioned by princes intent on transmitting their own renown or that of their dynasties to posterity, we have of course to be prepared for much rosecoloured presentation of the facts. Furthermore, the lives and sufferings of the common people usually disappear in the aura of court history. In the area of religious and social history certain works of popular literature, especially hagiographical writings - which for some time now have been evaluated with remarkable results — are therefore of very considerable importance. Aspects of constitutional history and the history of finance are being illuminated by documents which to date indeed are only seldom available in their original form but frequently are to be found in the copies which figured in a literary genre highly appreciated at that time, the works called Insha'. Analysis of these, too, has now been taken in hand.

While historical writing in the Timurid period, and also, it seems, the astronomical and mathematical work mentioned in connection with Ulugh Beg, was written in Persian, in the sphere of literature there figures also Chaghatai, an eastern Turkish language of which no literary monuments are preserved from the time before Timur's reign. Its first known representative is Sakkaki, a poet from Transoxiana who died in the first half of the 9th/15 th century. He may have been writing as early as the lifetime of Tlmur, but at all events he is mentioned as court poet to Khalll Sultan and Ulugh Beg. Outstanding among his successors is Lutfi, the author of a divan and a verse narrative (masnavi) entitled Gulu Naubabar. His home was Herat, where he died in 1462 or 1463 at the age of ninety-nine. Turkish poetry was written by Timurid princes such as Khalll Sultan, Aba Bakr MIr2a and Abu'l-Qasim Babur. Chaghatai literature reached its peak under Husain Balqara, who personally con
tributed a divan and a risala.x While his works lack the touch of real distinction, this is found in the numerous compositions of his famous minister and friend Mir 'All Shir Nava'I, who not only finally raised Chaghatai to the level of a literary language but, in one of his works entitled Muhakamat al-lughatain ("Arbitration on the Two Languages", i.e. Persian arid Turkish), accorded Chaghatai the primacy for its greater expressiveness. The first history of Chaghatai literature, the Majdlis
al-nafd'is, came from his pen.2 Among the other prose writings Zahlr al-Dln Babur's memoirs of the period 899—936/1494—1529, entitled Vaqd'i'-i Bdburi or more usually Bdbur-ndma, occupy an eminent place from a biographical, a historical and a geographical point of view. There is no reason to conclude from NavaTs "Arbitration" that there existed any antagonism between the use of Turkish or Persian, if only because the authors of Turkish works usually had in addition Persian writings to their credit. Chaghatai poetry also has many if not most forms in common with Persian - and the same ones, moreover, as had been favoured by Persian poets as early as the 8th/14th century. Even the subject matter corresponds, except that Turkish poets show a somewhat stronger preference for subjects derived from popular literature. Evidence for the good relationship between Chaghatai and Persian literature is provided by Nava'I himself with his Turkish translations of Jamfs Nafahdt al-uns and 'Attar's Mantiq al-tair.

139



THE SUCCESSORS OF TIMUR
The brilliant period of Persian literature before Tlmur's invasion is not repeated after his death. One does come across Timurids who wrote in Persian, esteemed Persian poetry, and as patrons also reinvigorated court poetry. Favourable external circumstances of this kind increased the number of poets but not the intellectual and aesthetic worth of their production. The originality and richness of thought of the previous century declined, and adherence to poetic convention and heavy stress on formal elements took their place. As Indian style extended its influence, classicising rigidity was further encouraged. Such negative elements are a burdensome legacy even for considerable talents.
The increased tendency to turn for guidance to the religious orders, due to the troubles of the time, is matched by an increase in mystical poetry. Typical exponents are such saints as Shah Ni'mat-Allah Vail (d. 834/1431), the author of numerous works, some in Arabic and some in Persian, which display pantheistic emphases, and the poetically far more gifted Qasim al-Anvar (d. 837/1433-4). The latter was born in Azarbaljan, lived for a time in Herat, and was suspected of being involved in a heretical conspiracy in connection with the attempt on Shah Rukh's life, but finally found asylum with Ulugh Beg in Samarqand. But in addition to this religiously orientated poetry, there are represented also love lyrics and romantic and heroic epics. The lyric poetry quite often shows the same weave of mystical and pseudomystical elements as is frequently found in the work of Hafiz. This is particularly true of the writings of Kamal al-Din Bina'I (executed in 918/1512). In the romantic epic KatibI of Nlshapur (d. between 1434 and 1436) earned a high reputation, while 'Abd-Allah Hatifl (d. 927/ 15 20), a nephew of JamI, is worthy of mention for his Timiir-nama, a heroic epic in praise of Timvir.
These few examples would adequately characterise Persian poetry were it not for the fact that the century produced one other remarkable figure, Maulana Nur al-Din 'Abd al-Rahman JamI (b. 817/1414, d. 898/1492), who was outstanding not only as a poet and mystic but also as a scholar in various disciplines and as a powerful personality. True to his training under Sa'd al-Din Muhammad Kashgharl, the pupil and follower of the founder of the order, Baha' al-Din Naqshband, he remained loyal throughout his life to the Sufism observed by the Surma, in spite of the pantheistic ideas found in his works. He was a friend of 'AH Shir Nava'I and Khwaja Ahrar and had good connec

tions with the court of Herat. He dedicated various of his works to Husain Balqara and Sultan Ya'qub Aq Quyunlu, the prince of Tabriz. Yet he was never tempted into the conventional flattering panegyrics of his day. Nor did he take up an invitation to move to the Ottoman court, though he did not disdain travel, as is shown by his pilgrimages to Mashhad and Mecca and quite lengthy stays en route in Baghdad, Damascus and Tabriz. As a scholar, Jam! dealt with questions of theology, prosody, and Arabic grammar. In his poetry, an oeuvre of unusual scope, almost all the traditional genres are represented. He left three divans, and in seven long poems (masnavls) under the general title Haft aurang he took up again the main themes of Persian poetry. As the mature expression of Persian thought, his works have commanded high regard and found numerous translators in Europe. There is an apparent contradiction to be seen between the fair consolidation of outward conditions in the Timurid dominions, on the one hand, especially under the long reigns of Shah Rukh, Abu Sa'Id and Husain Balqara, and the insecurity, distress and oppression, on the other, which obtained at particular stages and in many areas for the population of the plains and the provincial towns. This contradiction, however, is exceeded by the remarkable imbalance between the general social and economic conditions and the brilliance of some of the larger cities, especially the royal cities such as Samarqand, Shlraz and Herat. The great pattern and standard the Timurids imitated was Tlmur, who had applied his best efforts to making Samarqand the radiant metropolis of the Islamic world. We know that he deported master builders and artisans, artists and scholars for this purpose to Samarqand from the cities he conquered, in order to use their skills to enhance the beauty and renown of his capital. We find the same habit in his successors, if not to the same extent. We know, at any rate, the names of certain artists, poets and scholars who at the whim of the particular conqueror had to shift their sphere of operations away from various cities when these were occupied, to where the prince resided. Of course it should not be assumed that coercion was always used, since clearly the patronage of many princes had a powerful attraction for those involved in cultural life.
The most obvious expression of all this was to be found in the buildings of the Timurid empire, of which many are preserved and others are at least known from the descriptions of contemporary writers, of whom some were travellers from Europe. They bear testi

mony to a great flourishing of Islamic architecture at this time, which largely accounts for the phrase "Timurid renaissance" coming into vogue in Europe. One of the characteristic features was an adherence to existing architectural traditions, expecially — but not exclusively Iranian traditions; another is a striking eclecticism. Both are seen by scholars as symptomatic of that coming together of professional artists, especially from central and southern Persia, which we mentioned above. And it was precisely this that preserved architecture from slipping away into provincialism. We cannot reject the suggestion that the personal taste of the clients also gave a new impulse to artistic creativity. This is a question which would merit detailed investigation. Finally, there is some prima facie evidence suggesting foreign influences, for instance from the Far East. The beginnings of essentially Timurid architecture go back to the time of Tlmur, and had already achieved their peak of perfection in the palace of the conqueror at Kish (Shahr-i Sabz), known from the description of the Spanish ambassador Clavijo, who saw it in 1404 before its completion, and in the Ahmad Yasavl mosque at Turkistan, built 797/1394—5, and the Bibi Khanum mosque at Samarqand, completed five years later. A new era, the first Khurasan period, occurs during Shah Rukh's reign, in which his wife Gauhar Shad and their son Baisunqur (d. 837/1433) are remembered for the work they commissioned, and Qivam al-Din ShlrazI as their builder. In contrast to the preceding era in Transoxiana it shows considerable progress in both design and decoration, as can clearly be seen by a simple comparison of the Gauhar Shad mosque at Mashhad (begun 808/1405—6 and completed 821—2/1418-9) with the Blbi Khanum mosque at Samarqand. This structure initiated the predominantly classical Timurid style of the next few decades. The basic architectural plan — as in the 8th/14th century - was the inner court with its four cloisters with pointed arches {aivdri), connected by two-storey arcades, but now also extended by a portal. In the next architectural period, which lasted from the end of Shah Rukh's reign to the fall of the Timurid empire of Herat, this type of structure only occurs once, namely in the Herat madrasa. Otherwise we find the covered mosque, which demanded less expenditure, or a kind of combined form, a mixture of covered and courtyard mosque, represented by Abu'l-Qasim Babur's mosque in Anau dating from 848/1444—5. As an example of the more common covered mosque we may cite the Masjid-i Shah (1451) at Mashhad. As

the period went on the statesman and writer Mir 'All Shir Nava'I won renown as the builder of a large number of edifices. Among the striking innovations of Timurid architecture are not only the increase in expenditure involved and — especially in the first Khurasan period — the tendency to magnificence seen in the greater height of the buildings, precious surface decorations, numerous cupolas and minarets and a greater number of rooms in contrast with former designs, but also new structural features such as the portal with stalactites in droplet form and — very typically — the tall pear-shaped cupola which now appears, in addition to the flat cupola which is still used. The first instance of this is found in the Gur-i Mir at Samarqand. It rests on a supporting cupola not visible from the outside, which, in addition to its function as a support, also serves to restore the normal height dimension to the space beneath. Still more important, though, indeed perhaps the most important feature, is the hitherto unprecedented wealth of colour. It is often found in the faience mosaics of the surface decoration, which is frequently embedded in stucco and covers the representational sides of whole buildings in a lavish display of plant and script motifs. Whereas the Timurid faiences of the early period have only a modest, somewhat austere range of colours, what develops in the course of time is a rich palette as great in its variety as in its aesthetic elegance which gives the whole architectural concept its characteristic fascination. With the choice achievements of its architecture, in terms both of technical and decorative developments, Timurid civilisation undoubtedly reached its peak. It is part of the great artistic heritage which passed to the Safavids in the ioth/i6th century and became the starting-point of a new development which so impressed itself on the outward appearance of Persia that it remains to this day one of the characteristic features of the country. The initiative of the Timurid princes, no matter what may have been the motives and personal interest of the art-loving patrons among them, was responsible for the emergence of painting of high quality. No examples of mural or textile painting have been preserved, but specimens of miniature art are numerous. Illuminated manuscripts of the Timurid period constitute some of the most priceless treasures in
the libraries and collections of east and west.1 Even before TImur's

time several generations of artists, influenced by the work of the Far East, and under Mongol and probably also Turkish influences, had awakened the art of old Iran to new life out of the petrifaction of obsolete forms. In the 9th/15 th centupy, under Timurid - that is to say, essentially Turkish — patronage, the art of painting looks back to its Iranian past, and the influence of this past forces back the hitherto dominating influences. Research to date places the origins of Timurid painting in the workshops of the Jalayirids in Baghdad and Tabriz, perhaps also in those of the Muzaffarids in Shlraz, attributing them to artists deported by
Timur to Samarqand after his conquest of these cities.1 Since none of their work survives, it cannot be proved, though it may reasonably be assumed, that it was here that the roots of a syncretism of various different styles are to be found, and moreover those of totally different schools of painters, a syncretism which is characteristic of Timurid painting throughout the whole period of its existence. The political upheavals which followed the death of Timur induced many artists to leave Samarqand and to seek their livelihood at the newly developing Timurid princely courts. This would account for the fact that the style of the period, in spite of the great distances that separated the individual centres, shows a remarkable unity in which the only differences are matters of nuance. This style can only in fact be traced as an unbroken sequence at two places, Shlraz and Herat. Under Iskandar b. 'Umar Shaikh, who ruled from 812/1409 to 817/1414, painting in Shlraz enjoyed a period of distinction strikingly marked by the refinement of its draughtsmanship and the delicacy of its colours. And in the following twenty years under Ibrahim (d. 838/1435), whom his father Shah Rukh appointed governor of Fars after the victory over Iskandar, the distinction of this school continued, even though its production was no longer quite of the same high standard. At the same time there grew up a powerful rival to it under the patronage of Shah Rukh and his son Balsunqur in the form of the Herat school, which eventually reached and later even surpassed its achievements by its success in evolving new means of expression and a unique wealth of colour. Signs of age were already appearing in Timurid art when it once again had the good fortune to

acquire generous patrons in Husain Balqara and Mir 'AH Shir Nava'I. Under their protection emerged the greatest painter of Muslim Iran, Kamal al-Dln Bihzad (d. c. 1535). Combining direct observation of nature with traditional elements, he was responsible for the renaissance of book illumination. He outlived the fall of the Timurids, went to Tabriz, and achieved high renown at the court of the Safavids. As a result of his work and the wide circle of his pupils he introduced into Safavid miniature art what was to be a continuation of Timurid painting, distinguished by the brilliance of its achievements.

CHAPTER 4
THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
INTRODUCTION: THE TURKISH BACKGROUND
With the conquest of Baghdad in 656/1258, the Mongols dealt a deathblow to the empire of the caliphate. This event, together with the dramatic circumstances that attended it, is often regarded as a dividingline between two historical epochs. This view is justified only in so far as the fall of the caliphate destroyed the last tie which, up till that time, had with difficulty been holding together the world of Islam. Yet the historical significance of this event should not be over-estimated. It is true that, apart from the liquidation of the 'Abbasids, it represented the prelude to new historical developments, such as the rise of the UKhanid dynasty, which was to be of great importance in the history of Persia. But its total effect on the history of the Islamic world was of a more or less superficial nature. For the political organisation of the caliphate which the Mongols had destroyed was little more than an outer shell, which had long been crumbling away, around heterogeneous structures which as a whole had very little to do with the Islamic empire of the early 'Abbasids, and which indeed actually negated the raison d'etre of a common polity. In spite of the catastrophic effect of the Mongol assault upon the people of that time, and in spite also of the changes which it caused and the traces which, here and there, it left behind it, eighty years later it already belonged to the past. Of distinctly greater historical significance were other developments which had begun long before. One of the most important of these, though not the earliest chronologically, was the influx of the Turks into the Islamic world which, by the 5 th/1 ith century, had reached considerable proportions, but had in fact begun in a small way as early as the 3rd/9th. The advance of Turkish peoples has been likened to the Teutonic migrations because by invading a unified ancient culture - the Teutons that of the West, the Turks that of Islam - both movements created the necessary preconditions for the rise of national states. It should be remembered that the Turkicisation of Anatolia did not begin in the 7th/13 th century, as was once supposed, but had already started in the jth/i ith century, or even earlier: there is mention in the 3rd/c)th century of the Tourkopouloi as

THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
auxiliary troops of the Byzantine emperor, presumably Oghuz Tiirkmens, who are known to have existed in Bukhara towards the end
of the 4th/ioth century.1 Indeed, the political success of single Turkish groups and individuals within the world of Islam which had thus begun more than two centuries before the Mongol onslaught, was one of the most important prerequisites for later developments. The Turkish invasion did not merely bring about the fall of the Byzantine empire. In addition, the arrival in the Holy Land of victorious Turkish hordes furnished the pretext for the crusading movement in the West; it was Turkish forces which marched against the Crusaders as they drew near their goal; Turkish troops, this time under the Mamluks, who halted the hitherto irresistible advance of the Mongols in the Syrian approaches to Egypt; and Turkish initiative, again, that prevailed during the jockeying for political power in the Near East after the end of Mongol hegemony. In fact, if the 20th century be disregarded, nearly all the later states of the Islamic world were of Turkish foundation. But of particular historical import in this connection were the events that took place during the 8th/14th and 9th/15 th centuries, since they were the prelude to a development whose effects were to last until well into the 20th century. Great though the Turkish share in this process may have been, it would not be correct to describe it as being exclusively Turkish. To speak of an age as being entirely Turkish is possible only with reserve and within very restricted limits for the reason that there was another and very significant factor at work. Even before the Turkish migration had reached the highlands of Iran other, Iranian, forces had begun the work of undermining and subverting the 'Abbasid caliphate, whose effective strength was by then already in decline. So the Turks in fact did nothing more than take over and continue the work that Persians had already begun: that work concerned the formation and development of indigenous forces in Iran, which in their turn succeeded in establishing political dominions without the central government in Baghdad being able to put a stop to their activities, but also without these forces having in view the removal of the caliphate. This political development was accompanied by a cultural one, for at about the same

THE TURKISH BACKGROUND
time the New Persian literary language was reaching its zenith, and this manifested itself in literary achievements of the first order; it is but one example, though an especially striking one, of the cultural impulse then at work in Iran, which, together with its many other manifestations, is sometimes called Iranism. It is true that none of the Iranian sub-principalities survived for long. But the cultural movements which were inspired or encouraged under their aegis are all the more remarkable. They set their stamp upon wide areas of the Islamic world, though in varying forms. The Turks who later made their appearance from Central Asia showed themselves particularly receptive to this Islamic culture. These migrating bands need not be seen as completely uncivilised barbarian hordes; the Turkish immigrants in Anatolia consisted predominantly of
nomads, but there were also some sedentary elements.1 Nevertheless it may be conjectured that even after the adoption of Islam they brought with them to the west the lightest of cultural burdens and were therefore quite remarkably open to new influences. At all events, the fact remains that Persian culture of that time exercised upon them a peculiar attraction to which they readily responded. Of course they did not take over everything that was proffered lock, stock and barrel, nor did they leave unchanged what they absorbed. In the place of the more or less unified Islamic culture which had been brought about by the 'Abbasid empire, there arose something quite new, a Turco-Persian culture which is always to be found wherever Turks settled on Persian soil or wherever, after contact with Iranian lands and their cultural emanations, they appeared elsewhere. A new, and not uncontested, interpretation sees in this the initial phase of national political developments, a question which will be discussed in greater detail in connection with the Safavids. Among the Turkish immigrants into the Near East the Oghuz, Turkmen peoples under leaders of the house of Saljuq, had been particularly successful as a result of founding several kingdoms, of which that in Anatolia with its capital Qonya, the former Iconium, is of special interest in our particular context. From the start, these Saljuqs were not the only Turkish princes in Asia Minor with political ambitions, since under their dominion, or alongside them, there were other families of high standing who were awaiting their opportunity.
1 See Siimer, "Anadolu'ya yalniz go^ebe Tiirkler mi geldi?".
149



THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
That had arrived with the downfall of the Saljuq kingdom in Asia Minor in 708/1308, which was followed soon after, through the decline and final extinction of Mongol power, by a political vacuum, a challenge to men of enterprise. Among the principalities which were then formed or grew in strength was that of the Ottomans, later to take its place in world history, a destiny which at the time seemed by no means assured and indeed cannot yet have been envisaged. Seen in retrospect, the rise and fall of most of these ruling houses, some twenty in all, belong to the sphere rather of Ottoman than of Persian history, although all of them, not excluding the Ottomans themselves, came under that influence of Iranian culture already mentioned. Yet some of them are of primary significance in the history of Iran, not only because of cultural ties but also for political, dynastic and religious reasons. Two of them, the principalities of the Aq Quyunlu and Qara Quyunlu, which also fall within the immediate Ottoman context, are closely connected with Persia; at times individual rulers of these dynasties were able to bring large sections, even the whole, of Persian territory under their sway, and thus a role very nearly devolved upon them which in the event was to be reserved for others. At any rate, in the eyes of contemporary European observers in the 9th/15 th century it seemed certain that here were the eastern counterparts to the dangerously expanding Ottomans. The impressive reports of these informants led the European powers to enter into negotiations with the Tiirkmens with a view to an alliance. Under their rule there were also Shi'I movements which were to have far-reaching historical consequences. It is a measure of their importance that those who followed them, the Safavids, are seen as the successors of these same Turkmen princes, as a collateral, that is, of the ruling house of Aq Quyunlu, with
a different territorial area.1
ORIGINS AND EARLY HISTORY OF THE TWO TURKMEN GROUPS
While in recent times much new light has been shed on these Tiirkmens,
their actual origin is still obscure.2 The uncertainty begins with their very names. There is, indeed, nothing especially remarkable about

ORIGINS OF THE TWO TURKMEN GROUPS
designations like Aq Quyunlu, "those (tribes) with white sheep (qoyun)" and Qara Quyunlu, "those (tribes) with black sheep", among nomads whose flocks were among their most valuable possessions. But still the question remains as to how they should be interpreted. There is a tendency today to see them as referring to totem animals, to which, however, it must be objected that in ancient times — at least according to Rashid al-Dln Fazl-AUah - Turks had been prohibited from eating the flesh of their totem animals. Had this proscription still been in force in this instance, such an interpretation would have to be rejected on grounds of practicality alone, in which case greater probability would accrue to a more mundane interpretation, namely that the designations in question are expressions of nothing more than the colour of the sheep exclusive to, or predominating in, their respectiveflocks.The designations must also have had an antithetical character in that they reveal the desire of the two groups to be clearly distinct one from the other. The dynastic emblems of the Aq Quyunlu and Qara Quyunlu found on coins, documents and tombstones have no recognisable con
nection with their names.1 In considering the genesis of such groups it should be remembered that these are nomad confederations of which, in the course of time, the composition changes frequently under the influence of political, geographic or economic factors. A strong tribe may, by the successes it achieves, attract other tribes, absorb them into its alliance and eventually through such accretions become a major constellation. But the opposite process is also possible when an important tribe loses its renown, its power, its magnetism; until, perhaps, it finally disintegrates altogether, while its various components achieve independence or seek to join other tribes that are on the upward climb. This explains how one and the same name may attach now to a kinship, now to a tribe or even to a confederation of several tribes. It is obvious that some part is played in this by rivalry, feuds and military struggles. It is not always possible to trace the underlying events, because history scarcely records them - if indeed they are recorded at all - unless they are preserved in oral tradition or in legendary accounts. Not until a tribe

or confederation achieves prominence does its destiny attract the attention of historians, whereupon the question of its origin and provenance arises, but often without any satisfactory answer being found. What is discovered, then, in the sources is all too often confused, incomplete and contradictory. Thus it is with the beginnings of the Aq Quyunlu and Qara Quyunlu. It is not impossible that they once belonged to the same confederation, or perhaps even formed one tribe, later to separate and seek their fortunes, in both cases successfully, as independent tribes. By the time when they are clearly discernible historically, in the 8 th/14th century, their names are no longer those of mere tribes, but of two confederations with numerous sub-tribes. Some of the names of these latter are known from earlier times, from the catalogue of the original twenty-four Oghuz tribes found in Rashld al-Dln and from other
legendary accounts.1 We are thus concerned with two confederations formed from various Turkmen tribes — those, in fact, which in all probability came with the Oghuz to Western Asia in the 5 th/11 th century, some of them no doubt getting as far as Anatolia. The sources give no direct information concerning these associations, but they must have been formed in the 8th/14th century after the fall of the Anatolian Saljiiq dynasty and to some extent out of the latter's bankruptcy. At that precise moment, too, the disintegration of the Mongol hegemony by which they and their member tribes had been contained enabled them to pursue their aspirations in the area of the resulting power vacuum, namely eastern Anatolia, northern Mesopotamia and north-west Persia. There is, indeed, no record of the names of the Aq Quyunlu and the Qara Quyunlu in the pre-Mongol period, though there does exist a record of the principal kin-groups which were later to become the ruling families among their subjects: the Bayindir (Bayundur) with the Aq Quyunlu, and the Baharlii, sometimes called BaranI, with the Qara Quyunlu. Bayindir is found in Rashld al-Din's index of tribes mentioned above as the designation of one of the twenty-four Oghuz tribes, whereas in the Kitdb-i Dede Qorqud, a Turkish epic that was recorded about 1400, it is the name of an Oghuz ruler. It is supposed that the Aq Quyunlu were a clan of the Bayindir tribe, but in the sources Bayindir or

152



ORIGINS OF THE TWO TURKMEN GROUPS
Bayi'ndiriyya is also found as a synonym for Aq Quyunlu; at any rate the tribal name Bayindir is met with in the 8th/14th century in Asia Minor. Certain central Anatolian place-names which must go back to the Oghuz conquest give rise to the supposition that the Bayindir took part in the Saljuq conquest of Asia Minor. After the fall of the Aq Quyunlu dynasty, the Bayindir settled in Tripoli and Aleppo, and also to the south of Slvas. The name Baharlu borne by the ruling family of the Qara Quyunlu is
sometimes connected with Bahadur,1 but is almost certainly linked with the locality of Bahar north of Hamadan, the seat of a powerful Turkmen family also represented at Irbll, Maragha and Akhlat: from the basin of Lake Urmiya, that is, to that of Lake Van, as well as considerably to the north and south of these. The pressure of the Mongol invasion may have driven them completely into the area north of Lake Van, where later the confederation of the Qara Quyunlu was to form. This connection can be deduced from the name Tva'I which is recorded as early as 629/1230 at Akhlat and again with one of the last 'Abbasid caliph's most famous ministers, who came from the village of Bahar and was executed in 656/1258 in Baghdad by the Mongols. Tva'I is merely a derivative of Iva or Y'iva, which is the name of another of the original Oghuz tribes. The connection between the Qara Quyunlu and the Yiva is proved by the dynastic emblem common to both, and which the Qara Quyunlu dynasty must have taken over from the
Yiva.2 The designation BaranI, as used in respect of the Qara Quyunlu, has not yet been satisfactorily explained. It has been supposed that it is the name of the tribe's ruling family, or that it is connected with a
place-name,3 two interpretations which need not be mutually exclusive. The early history of the two Turkmen groups with which we are here concerned is closely bound up with the "social sickness", as a
Turkish scholar has called the period of decline,4 which set in with the end of Mongol hegemony throughout a large part of the Near East. Freelance mercenaries and adventurers, basing themselves upon nomadic tribes and robber bands, disrupted economic life in town and
1 Siimer, "Kara-Koyunlular", p. 292, mentions a Bahadurlu tribe. There is no mention of the transition from bahadur to bahar amongst the many references collected by Doerfer, TMEN11, s.v. bahadur, apart from the ba bar occurring in Caucasian languages (p. 373).

country, often bringing it to a complete standstill. They offered their services, or allied themselves, to any prince who seemed likely to succeed, but they never hesitated to abandon master or ally as soon as fortune beckoned elsewhere. Lust for booty, a thirst for power and a striving for territorial dominion, such were their motives. Only the successful could count on the following that perhaps might enable them to achieve political authority. It was in these circumstances that the two confederations evolved, and under these conditions that they prospered, so that during the second half of the 8th/14th century they were both able to found dynasties, that of the Aq Quyunlu in Diyarbakr, with its centre at Amid, that is in the lands of the Tigris and Euphrates with Urfa and Mardin in the south and Baiburt in the north; that of the Qara Quyunlu immediately to the east, with a centre at Arjlsh on the north-east shore of Lake Van, and spreading north to Erzerum and south to Mosul. The territories of both confederations were then occupied, as they had long been already, by a predominantly sedentary population, consisting of Armenians, Kurds, Aramaeans and Arabs, but at first including no Persian elements. While no doubt exploited and much oppressed by the Tiirkmens, these peoples were never driven out or exterminated. Individuals, families, and sometimes even much larger groups, might fall victim to circumstances, abandon their homes, or marry into one of the oppressor's tribes, but the ethnic pattern remained much the same, with groups surviving Turkmen overlordship and persisting in their own locality, in some cases actually until the present day. Their role in the political developments we have to consider was, with rare exceptions, non-existent; they were the suffering witnesses of events upon which, generally speaking, they could have no influence whatsoever. The rise of the two confederations was accompanied, not only by endless conflicts with their neighbours, but also by mutual jealousies and rivalries: the destruction of Erzerum in 733—5/1332—4 resulted
from the feud between them.1 These quarrels and conflicts determined their policies of alliance and their choice of enemies, in other words, their entire destiny, until eventually the Aq Quyunlu triumphed, destroyed the dominion of the Qara Quyunlu, assimilated not only their lands, but also many of their sub-tribes, and entered the ranks of the major powers of the Near East. In spite of certain peculiarities

154



ORIGINS OF THE TWO TURKMEN GROUPS
distinguishing the two groups from one another, they have so much in common ethnically, politically, historically, culturally and economically, that their history is best considered in conjunction. We are better informed regarding the political inception of the Aq Quyunlu than about the first stages of the Qara Quyunlu. No doubt this is due to the nature of one of their first objectives, the Comnenian empire of Trebizond, which they set out with great determination to attain, their raids and conquests for the rest not being confined to eastern Anatolia, but extending into Mesopotamia and Syria. Their often repeated attacks on Trebizond after 741/1340 gave the Byzantine chroniclers every cause to write about them. Thus they mention Tur 'AH Beg, lord of the "Turks of Amid", who had already attained the rank of amir under the Il-Khan Ghazan (694-703/1295-1304). When in 749/1348, under his leadership, the Tiirkmens reappeared before Trebizond, they again failed to take the town, but the youthful John Comnenus, soon to ascend the throne as Alexios III but never to achieve military fame, had evidently been so terrified that he, and no doubt also his advisers, deemed it politic to betrothe his sister, Maria Despina, to Fakhr al-Din Qutlugh Beg, son of the Turkmen leader,
thus finally warding off the danger.1 The calculation proved correct: Trebizond was spared for the time being, and later generations witnessed several other such unions between Comnenian princesses and Aq Quyunlu chiefs. It may well be to these that the empire of Trebizond owed the respite which enabled it to survive until 865/1461, eight years after the fall of Constantinople. However this may be, we know that Uzun Hasan intervened with Mehmed the Conqueror on
Trebizond's behalf.2 From the Tiirkmen-Trebizond marriage of 75 3/13 5 2, the first to be attested, was born the founder of the Aq Quyunlu dynasty, Qara
Yoluq3 'Usman Beg who, in 791/1389, followed his brother Ahmad Beg as head of the Aq Quyunlu. The chief chronicle of the dynasty, Tihranl's Kitab-i Diyarbakriyja, not only mentions his grandfather, Tur 'All Beg, the besieger of Trebizond, and his father, Qutlugh Beg, who presumably succeeded the latter in 764/1363, but traces his lineage

THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
through 51 generations back to Oghuz Khan, the legendary eponym of
the Oghuz.1 Such genealogical trees are, of course, notoriously unreliable, yet this is a significant point, revealing as it does the view which the Aq Quyunlu held of themselves, since around 875/1470, the time of the chronicle, when they were in their heyday, they may well have regarded this genealogy not only as mere flattery but also as political legitimation. We do not know - indeed it is doubtful - whether this claim was made at the time of the dynasty's foundation, or in fact whether it could be made at all. At that time, a family alliance with the Comneni may in itself have represented political capital. In any case, Qara 'Usman followed the example of his father by marrying a Trebizond princess. Seldom were the many conflicts in which the Aq Quyunlu engaged so romantically resolved. Generally these were feudal struggles with neighbouring and usually local rulers, in which territorial expansion and spheres of influence were involved. In the course of his long life, Qara 'Usman carried out many more of these than his far from peaceable father, always impelled by the belief that he would succeed in establishing his tribal lands of Diyarbakr as a stable dominion. It is not necessary, nor possible, to describe in detail these never-ending quarrels, if only because accounts in the sources differ from each other in many respects and most have not yet been critically assessed. Yet they cannot be completely ignored, for in them can sometimes be discovered the lines of later development. This is usually so when one of the major powers is involved, as could of course happen even in a mere quarrel with any princeling whatsoever. This was the case with the rulers of Slvas, to whose assistance the Ottoman Turks willingly hastened because the rise of the Aq Quyunlu had filled them with foreboding and mistrust, especially when, as here, it was a question of lands in which they themselves were interested. The struggle ended in the year 800/1397 with the defeat and death of QazI Burhan al-Dln, a man renowned as a poet, who had risen from being a lawyer to the rank of sultan of Slvas. There was also friction with the rulers of Egypt, the Mamluks, whose possessions in northern Syria and southern Armenia were threatened by Qara 'Usman. This did not lead to more serious consequences at the time, perhaps because Barquq (784-801/1382-1399), the

sultan of Cairo, was compelled by a serious rising in Syria to devote all his energies to the preservation of that country, and even to the protection of his own throne and person. But there was one adversary who, above all others, was dangerous to the Aq Quyunlu and the political aims they pursued, namely their tribal kinsmen of the Turkmen Qara Quyunlu confederation. Their leader, Qara Muhammad, it is true, did not long survive 'Usman Beg's father, against whom he had often fought. His successor, Qara Yusuf, however, showed himself uncommonly active and was, of course, determined to keep up the traditional feud. At first the issue remained undecided. Only when Tlmur appeared in the Near East did a change seem imminent. The Qara Quyunlu, the first to encounter his troops, ignored his demands for surrender, opposed him and suffered defeat every time that battle was joined. This gave rise to a feud that persisted with Tlmur's successors. There appear to have been many different accounts current at the time concerning the conqueror's character and his military methods. Whereas in Cairo he was still being referred to in 788/1386 as "a Mongol rebel by the name of Tlmur", who was on his way to Tabriz, in Persia and Mesopotamia his advance aroused so intense a state of terror as sometimes to induce a kind of paralysis. Qara Yusuf did not wait for a final military decision, but chose rather to seek refuge with the Ottoman Turks. Returning later, he again had to flee, this time to Syria where he was interned in a castle near Damascus by the governor because of his earlier activities against the Mamluks. His conduct, and the attitude of hostility towards Tlmur adopted by the other Qara Quyunlu chiefs, may have been the incentive that determined the Aq Quyunlu leader to join the conqueror and to offer
him his services. This took place in 801/1399, ^n t n e Transcaucasian camp at Qarabagh, where Qara 'Usman paid homage to Tlmur. During the first campaign in Anatolia he was made commander of the vanguard, and his name is also mentioned in connection with the subsequent Syrian campaign. Next, in 804/1402, he took part in the battle of Ankara. The defeat and imprisonment of Bayezid I brought about a serious crisis in the Ottoman empire. Tlmur awarded the title of amir to the leader of the Aq Quyunlu as a reward for his services, and conferred on him all the lands of Diyarbakr in fief. Thus it seemed that the Aq Quyunlu's dream of a principality had come true, for at that time there was no greater feudal lord in the Near East than Tlmur. But their joy was shortlived; for when Tlmur died
157



THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
in February 1405 during a campaign in the east, it was immediately apparent that the vast empire he had accumulated by his conquests lacked internal stability. The anarchy following his death saw the rise of a number of rulers. One of the main causes for the rapid decline of so great an empire was undoubtedly the fact that the princes of Timur's house, scattered throughout the dominions as governors and ruling their provinces with virtually unlimited power, although they had submitted to the supreme authority of the conqueror, did not feel bound to any successor. This phenomenon has its parallel in the origins of many Turkish states and is also found, as we shall see, among the Tiirkmens. Notwithstanding these upheavals, a considerable empire survived, mainly in eastern Persia and in Afghanistan, under the rule of Timur's son, Shah Rukh, as it continued to survive under his successors for the next hundred years. But exert themselves as they might, these rulers were unable to overpower the Tiirkmens. The immediate effect of Timur's campaigns is apparent in the fact that neither the Timurids nor the Ottomans nor yet the Egyptian Mamluks succeeded in containing the political ambitions of the two Turkmen confederations, a circumstance that was to play a significant role in their subsequent development. In the sorely afflicted countries of the Near East, the struggle continued after Timur's death. Qara 'Usman, whose successes at Timur's side had earned him considerable prestige in the eyes of his confederation and had won over a number of tribes of doubtful allegiance, waged war, usually with success, against many of the neighbouring princelings. His relations with Egypt were initially peaceful, but later he again attacked her possessions. In nearly all his undertakings against the Qara Quyunlu, still his main adversaries, he was unsuccessful, probably because in Qara Yusuf he had encountered an equal, if not a superior, antagonist. He remained loyal to Timur's house, however, though the patronage of Shah Rukh (807—50/1405—47) was very far from being as significant as that of his father, so that the alliance was therefore of small advantage to Qara 'Usman and was partly responsible for bringing about his death. During Shah Rukh's three Azarbaijan campaigns (823/1420, 832/1429, 838—9/1434—5), all conducted against the Qara Quyunlu, Qara 'Usman is found each timefightingon the Timurid side. Although Qara Yusuf had died at the very start of the first expedition, his troops had been dispersed, and Iskandar Beg, his second son and eventual successor, had been beaten, the Qara

Quyunlu were quick to recover. During the third campaign, when this same Iskandar fled before Shah Rukh to take refuge with the Turks, Qara 'Usman, now almost eighty years old, tried to cut off his retreat. During a fight near Erzerum he was severely wounded, and died as a result in Safar 839/at the end of August 1435. Returning from exile, Iskandar Beg passed through the town, had the Aq Quyunlu leader's grave opened and the corpse decapitated, characteristically sending the skull to the sultan of Egypt, who caused it to be publicly displayed in Cairo. 'Usman Beg's fearlessness and military fame were immensely admired by his contemporaries, yet when the results of his turbulent career are considered, it is found that he did little more than make a first attempt at founding a state. It is true that he had achieved royal status, had extended his dominion's by the conquest of numerous lands including important places such as Ruha (formerly Edessa, now Urfa), Slvas and Toqat, and had consolidated his sovereignty shortly before his death by victories over al-Malik al-'Adil Jikam, the governor of Aleppo and Damascus, as well as over al-Malik al-Zahir 'Isa, the commander of Mardln, but these achievements were to a large extent nullified by the violent disputes that broke out between his sons after his death. For a time their dynasty was eclipsed by that of the Qara Quyunlu, though it was later to make a brilliant recovery. Thus the initiative had now passed to the Qara Quyunlu, who entered on the period of their greatest expansion. Before considering their subsequent history, something should be said of the early years of this confederation, which have not been dealt with before because less significant than the founding of the Aq Quyunlu state. In the decades following the death of the Tl-Khan Abu Sa'Id (716—736/1316—1335), which brought Hiilegii's dynasty to a close, various Mongol princes and other potentates attempted to subdue the Il-Khanid empire, or portions of it. The ensuing struggle for power quickly brought about the disintegration of the Mongol empire, part of which re-emerged as the dominion of the Jalayirids, extending across Mesopotamia, Azarbaljan and, later, Shlrvan. During the reign of Shaikh Uvais (757-776/1356-1374), an energetic and successful representative of this dynasty, the Qara Quyunlu emerged for the first time as an undoubted political force. In the sources, their name is mentioned in connection with Bairarn Khwaja and two of his brothers, who belonged to the Baharlu tribe, of which we have already spoken



THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
as the sometimes unruly followers of Shaikh Uvais1. Although after the latter's death Bairam Khwaja did not shake off Jalayirid authority, he succeeded in acquiring Arjlsh, Mosul and Sinjar, as well as some places in Transcaucasia, so that on his death in 782/1380, Qara Muhammad, presumably his son but according to some sources his nephew, succeeded to dominions extending from Erzerum to Mosul. Qara Muhammad, whom we have already encountered as the antagonist of Qutlugh Beg Aq Quyunlu, the son-in-law of the Comneni, is generally regarded as the founder of the Qara Quyunlu ruling house, and rightly so if we consider the strength of his influence in the abovementioned lands. His successes against the Artuqids, a dynasty of Turkmen origin that had existed for something like two centuries in and around Mardin, against the Aq Quyunlu and against the Syrian
nomadic Turkmen tribe of the Dogher under their leader Salim2, were threatened by Tlmur's conquest of western Iran in 788/1386 and his campaign against the Qara Quyunlu in the very next year. At the very beginning of his reign, Qara Muhammad had secured for the Jalayirid Ahmad the succession against other pretenders; thus, though the dependent position of his dynasty vis-a-vis the Jalayirids was not actually reversed, it was at least converted into one of alliance, and hence of independence. In any event, there was now nothing to prevent him from trying to establish friendly relations with the Egyptian Mamluks, and the report of Egyptian chroniclers that on the occupation of Tabriz in 790/1388 he paid allegiance to Sultan Barquq, declaring that the latter's name was to be mentioned in the Friday prayers and on the coinage, seems highly probable, since this ruler would appear to have been a perfect ally, both against the Aq Quyunlu and against Timur. However, his policy towards Egypt had to be temporarily abandoned for several reasons, not least because as early as the spring of 791/1389 Qara Muhammad was killed in a struggle with rival Tiirkmens.
We have already mentioned the flight of his son, Qara Yusuf, to the Ottomans, and it should be added that his stay in Turkish territory was Tlmur's main incentive for his second Anatolian campaign, although by that time Qara Yiisuf was already on his way back. Ahmad Jalayir had also taken refuge with the Ottomans, and the paths of the two princes crossed for the second time when, after their return from

ORIGINS OF THE TWO TURKMEN GROUPS
Anatolia, they again fled before Tlmur's troops, this time to Syria, in the domain of the Mamluks. Here they received a welcome less kindly than that of the Ottomans; indeed they were interned in a castle near Damascus for having some time previously attacked and defeated Egyptian governors of northern Syria, and an order for their execution actually arrived from Cairo, having its origin either directly or indirectly in Tlmur; but it was not carried out. Their imprisonment together led to a renewal of their former friendly relations, differences that had sprung up in the meantime were ironed out and an agreement was reached regarding spheres of influence that was intended to eliminate all dispute. According to this, Mesopotamia with Baghdad was to be an area of Jalayirid influence, and AzarbaTjan with Tabriz an area of Qara Quyunlu influence. When the two princes regained their freedom in the spring of 806/1404, this agreement turned out to be little more than a programme, for both dominions had meanwhile been incorporated into Tlmur's empire and made over to one of his grandsons, MIrza Aba Bakr b. Mlran Shah, a prince who had already on a previous occasion defeated Qara Yusuf in battle. But circumstances soon changed. The Qara Quyunlu leader's personal renown and the successes that he soon achieved again won him a considerable following which increased on the death of Tlmur: for this we have the evidence of the Spanish ambassador Clavijo, who encountered his troops in the summer of
1406 in the region of Khuy.1 In the struggle against Aba Bakr he was victorious first in 809/1406, again in 810/1408, and on several subsequent occasions. The news that his former fellow prisoner, Ahmad Jalayir, had occupied Tabriz was a severe blow, however, for not only was it a violation of the treaty we have mentioned, but it also put in jeopardy his eastward expansion which, in view of Ottoman resurgence and the tenacious resistance of the Aq Quyunlu in the west, might well prove to be a question of life and death. Thus the occupation of the town of Tabriz cut across Qara Yusuf's most vital plans and represented a pretext for war. He therefore marched against Ahmad Jalayir, who was defeated, taken prisoner and executed in
813/1410.
During the time of his Syrian imprisonment, a son, Pir Budaq, had been born to Qara Yusuf. This boy had been adopted at the time of his

THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
birth in 1403 by Ahmad Jalayir, probably to demonstrate the sincerity of his friendship. It was probably owing to legitimist considerations that Qara Yusuf nominated this particular son, while still of tender years, lord of Tabriz, even getting his adoptive father to appoint him by royal decree as his successor, while he himself retained only the regency. The Turkmen leader, not in other respects a scrupulous man, obviously had sufficient reason for thus reasserting his claims to independence when he made Tabriz his capital city. He had repeatedly occupied it since 793/1391, but never held it firmly in his grasp. With the elimination of the Jalayirids, the power of the Qara Quyunlu moved rapidly towards its zenith. The very next year, in 815/ 1412, Shah Muhammad, another of the prince's sons, conquered Mesopotamia and Baghdad which he retained, in spite of some disputes with his father, under the latter's overlordship, until driven out in 836/1433 by his younger brother, Aspand. Qara Yusuf himself fought successfully against the Aq Quyunlu in eastern Anatolia, conquering parts of Georgia and Shlrvan, whose rulers had owed allegiance to the Jalayirids. While an advance into Persia, namely to Sultaniyya, the former capital of the Tl-Khans, and to Qazvin, Isfahan and Fars, increased his military fame, it was a move that had serious consequences, for it made Shah Rukh aware of the full extent of the danger that was threatening from the Tiirkmens. We have already seen that he did not remain idle in the face of that threat but led an expedition against Azarbaljan. Qara Yusuf, though mortally ill, went out to meet him, but death overtook him before battle had even been joined. In spite of the crisis brought about by Shah Rukh's attack and the death of their leader, the Qara Quyunlu dynasty had foundations stable enough to withstand these perils. That this was so was due in large measure to the achievements of Qara Yusuf, who had not only created an efficient army and repeatedly held his own on the field of battle, but had so successfully conducted his internal affairs with justice and liberality, at the same time keeping a close watch over the conduct of his wayward governors and showing concern for his dominions' agriculture, that he is extolled as the most able statesman of his house. His successor, Qara Iskandar, while victorious in his battles against the Kurdish amirs and the Shlrvan-Shah, did not succeed in adding appreciably to the power of his confederation, though he was relatively successful in keeping their dominions intact. He was not, however, a match for the intrigues of the Timurids, whose intention it was to play
162



JAHAN SHAH QARA QUYUNLU
off his ambitious brothers against him. It is true that he was able to assert himself in 835/1431 against Abu Sa'Id, who had been made governor of Tabriz while he himself had been in exile. But when, after another defeat in 840/1436, he had to meet in battle his brother Jahan Shah, the new governor of Azarbaljan — another appointee of Shah Rukh's — his soldier's luck deserted him once and for all. He was defeated near Tabriz, in the locality of Sufiyan, and retreated to Al'injaq, a castle in the neighbourhood of Nakhchivan. There he was murdered soon after by his son Shah Qubad in 841/1437.
JAHAN SHAH QARA QUYUNLU
Under Jahan Shah, the power of the Qara Quyunlu confederation reached its height, but his death was followed by an abrupt decline. Though he owed his rise to the political strategy of Shah Rukh, by whose favour he had in fact become governor, he did not carry gratitude and loyalty beyond what was necessary to secure his sway over the principal lands of the Qara Quyunlu. As early as 850/1447 circumstances changed through the death of his overlord and, like his predecessors, he followed the basic tendency of his house, the Turkmen drive towards the east. His brilliant victories in the ensuing campaigns against the Timurids did not always lead to lasting gains, but they clearly demonstrate the growth of Turkmen influence in the history of Persia at that time; not through the occupation of Persian provinces alone, but also from an ethnological standpoint, for at the time of Jahan Shah's seizure of power the second of three waves of Turkmen peoples flooding back into Persia from Anatolia was in full swing: they were to play a considerable part in the development of that country. The fall of Qara Iskandar had brought into Jahan Shah's hands the Qara Quyunlu principality, with the exception, however, of central and southern Mesopotamia; here his brother Aspand, who had extended his dominion as far as Havlza and Basra, refused him recognition. During two campaigns in Georgia similar to those which that country's Muslim neighbours had been waging for many years, he was able to try out his troops and allow free rein to their thirst for plunder. On the death of Aspand, when inheritance disputes afforded an opportunity for intervention, he conquered Baghdad and Mesopotamia. The inevitable conflicts following the death of Shah Rukh were a signal for Jahan Shah to shake off the overlordship of the Timurids and
163



THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
to extend his power eastwards at their expense. He assumed the title of Sultan and Khaqan, immediately reoccupied Sultaniyya and Qazvln, and seized Isfahan in 856/1452 and Fars and Kirman in the following year. After an advance upon Herat, the capital of Khurasan, undertaken in 862/1458, he had clearly over-reached himself, but was wise enough to relinquish his conquest when a reserve army from Turkestan under the Timurid Abu Sa'Id marched against him, and impending danger in the Turkmen west necessitated his return. Soon after his arrival there he effectively subdued his son Hasan 'All's insurrection in Azarbaljan. He faced a more difficult conflict with another of his sons, Plr Budaq (not to be confused with his namesake, Qara Yusuf's son, who had died as early as 816/1413), who had already proved unruly when governor of Fars and who had now rebelled as governor of Baghdad. Not until the summer of 870/1466, after the city had been under siege for a year and a half, was he overthrown and killed, perhaps by his brother MuhammadI, who took over the succession. Contemporary observers saw in Plr Biidaq's execution, which directly contravened the promise of safe conduct, not only a breach of faith but a Pyrrhic victory because Jahan Shah, already an old man, thus deprived himself of an exceptionally capable comrade-at-arms.
Indeed, Jahan Shah's tactics were eventually to fail in confrontation with the Aq Quyunlu confederation. This heralded a development which was to bring about the fall of the Qara Qoyunlu. Before going into this further, it would seem pertinent to consider briefly Jahan Shah's character and the political system which he succeeded in setting up in opposition to the sovereign claims of the Timurids. With Jahan Shah's reign of almost thirty years, the principality of the Qara Quyunlu achieved not only independence from the Timurids but, as a result of territorial expansion from Lake Van to the deserts which separated Persia from its eastern province of Khurasan, and from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf, attained almost imperial dimensions. In asking ourselves what this kingdom was like, we must again recall the importance attached by the Qara Quyunlu to their appearance as legitimate successors of the Jalayirids. There was a further consideration underlying this, namely that the successors of the Jalayirids were also entitled to the inheritance of the Tl-Khans. Whether or not Jahan Shah really called himself "Tl-Khan", it is certain that the Qara Quyunlu adopted the political forms of the Persian Mongol empire, as is evident from the Mongol titles of "Khaqan", "Noyan" and
164



JAHAN SHAH QARA QUYUNLU
"Bahadur" adopted by them. Again, comparison of the available documents issued by their court chancelleries with those of the Jalayirids
supports the assumption.1 While in this respect Jahan Shah was merely following in the footsteps of his predecessors, his personality achieves greater definition when considered in the context of the Tiirkmens' cultural achievements. The rulers who preceded him seldom afford any opportunity for insight into the intellectual and artistic life of the times. Even allowing for the gaps in our knowledge and for the fact that the information we possess regarding the Qara Quyiinlu derives for the most part from writers who were not well-disposed towards them and hence were sparing of expressions of praise and appreciation, yet the picture we have of their cultural activity is somewhat colourless, if their excessive religious enthusiasm and the literature it produced, discussed later on in this volume, are disregarded. Amongst the Turkmen leaders we have encountered up till now — mercenary characters for the most part, avid for power and spoils - Jahan Shah stands out both for his military and political prowess and for his cultural merits. Traces of his building works remain in a number of Persian cities, an especially remarkable monument being the Blue Mosque in Tabriz. His literary activity discloses rather more about him. Under the pseudonym Haqiqi or Haqlqat, we possess an anthology of his work consisting partly of Persian and partly of Turkish poems astonishing for their unusual and difficult verse-forms which are handled with considerable skill. Even if we are justified in suspecting that these are not the work of the ruler himself but of a ghost-writer, they nevertheless allow us to deduce a good deal respecting his cultural level and his literary tastes. Indeed Jahan Shah is said to have patronised large numbers of poets and scholars, as well as himself being actively involved in intellectual matters. These constructive traits, however, are not at all in keeping with the portrait on which the sources are virtually unanimous. They describe him, rather, as a grasping tyrant, a powerful and successful man perhaps, but of an unpredictable, malicious and merciless temperament

who, on the slightest pretext, would fling his officers in gaol, invariably for life. His cruelty towards vanquished towns, such as Tiflis (843/ 1439—40) and Isfahan (856/1452), must be taken as proven. He was reputed to have a partiality for opium and wine, debauchery and licentiousness, and for that reason was known contemptuously at the Ottoman court as "the bat". He is reproached with lack of assiduity in prayer, with ignoring religious precepts and with heretical inclinations. Against all this calumny only one voice is raised in approval; and because it comes from so unexpected a quarter, it is a voice that commands a hearing. 'Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandl, the court chronicler of the Timurid Shah Rukh and his successors, praises Jahan Shah's righteousness, his careful government and the good treatment meted
out to his subjects;1 his capital of Tabriz, with its large and prosperous population, compares favourably with Cairo; even Jahan Shah's model regime during the occupation of Herat comes in for praise. Such contradictory judgments are difficult to reduce to a common denominator. One can only seek for an explanation as to how and why they arose. The suggestion that 'Abd al-Razzaq was under an obligation to Jahan Shah, perhaps because of certain gifts or favours bestowed upon him on the occasion of a not altogether implausible encounter in Herat, can have little foundation in view of the chroni
cler's name for impartiality in reporting his times.2 It might, indeed, profit us more to assess the crimes and misdeeds of which Jahan Shah has been accused in the context of the debased morality of those days, which might have led a well-disposed or even merely unprejudiced reporter of the 9th/15 th century to see them in a milder light. Yet the idea is not to be arbitrarily dismissed that SunnI - and perhaps also Safavid - writers depicted the prince's adverse characteristics in more lurid colours because of his heretical leanings or his hostile attitude towards the Safavids. This brings us to the question of Jahan Shah's religious attitude. If no clear picture is attainable of his qualities as a man, in this particular respect he proves still more elusive. Here we are concerned not only with the evaluation of his personality, but also with circumstances of political import. For he has sometimes been designated as a progenitor

of Shl'I heresy1 and his dynasty, on account of its heterodox views, as the virtual predecessors of the Safavids, who were just then beginning to make the Shi'a the basis of a political system that was to determine Persia's destiny for more than two hundred years and, so far as religious matters were concerned, even right up till the present. How the Shl'a achieved such significance has not yet been adequately accounted for, although recently avenues have been opened up that promise new discoveries. What is known without doubt is that during the 8 th/14th and 9th/15 th centuries heretical movements of various kinds proliferated throughout the whole area of what had been
the Il-Khanid empire.2 It is incontestable that there were also Shl'I tendencies among the Qara Quyunlii. Yet the thesis of their Shl'I bigotry, culminating in the person of Jahan Shah, is no longer altogether tenable. We know, indeed, that his brother Aspand, when governor of Baghdad (836-848/1433-1445), introduced the Twelver (Ithna'ashariyya) Shl'a into Mesopotamia as the official religion, and this most certainly was not without Jahan Shah's knowledge and consent. It is also a fact that Sultan Qull, descendant of one of Jahan Shah's nephews, who fled from Hamadan to India in 883/1478, embraced the Shl'a and became the founder of the Qutbshahl dynasty of Golkonda, who were well known for their Shl'I views. No less incontestable is the occasional use of Shl'I coin-inscriptions by Jahan Shah. It is bewildering, but perhaps also characteristic, that his coins should as a rule have on their obverse side what was, from a Shl'I point of view, a highly unacceptable enumeration of the Orthodox Caliphs. The suppression of a HurufI rising in Tabriz is hardly compatible with the
picture of an anti-Sunnl fanatic,3 nor for that matter is the fact that he twice banished from Ardabll, in about 852/1448 and again in 863/1459, the Safavid Shaikh Junaid, a man whom many people charge with Shl'I views. These arguments justify us in concluding that Jahan Shah cannot indeed have been the Shl'I zealot depicted by many writers. This is

For an interesting example, see Ritter, "Die Anfange der Huruflsekte". 3 It is not absolutely certain, however, that this rising and its suppression took place in Jahan Shah's reign: cf. Minorsky, quoted by Ritter, "Die Anfange der Huruflsekte".

THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
also substantiated by the divan mentioned earlier, which cannot really be cited as evidence of a Shl'I mentality, especially when it is compared with that of Shah Isma'Il, where extreme heretical convictions are professed. Thus the thesis of heresy is based upon little more than certain Shl'I inclinations not entirely incompatible with a SunnI environment, as other examples go to show. A further contributory factor was the down-to-earth opportunism which, for better or worse, dictated a policy of compromise with the dangerous religio-political movements of the day. Whatever Jahan Shah's moral qualities and his religious convictions may have been, it is undeniable that his military and diplomatic skill acquired for the Qara Quyunlu a sizeable empire extending far into Persian territory, and testifying in many ways to a notable cultural achievement. Had this kingdom been granted time for peaceable development and the construction of an ordered polity, it would undoubtedly have exerted considerable influence on the subsequent course of Persian history. But that was not to be, for the very moment of time that marked the zenith of its power, also marked the beginning of its decline.
THE RISE OF UZUN HASAN AQ QUYUNLU
We must now return to the history of the confederation of the Aq Quyunlu, which we last noticed in 839/1435 when, in a battle against Iskandar Beg, Qara 'Usman was mortally wounded before the gates of Erzerum. None of his many sons was of the same fibre as their warrior father, and for a whole decade it seemed as though the ruling house of the Aq Quyunlu would be engulfed in the turbulence of endless strife and intrigue. It would be otiose to recount the details of this anarchy. We need only mention here that two of Qara 'Usman's sons,first'AH Beg (d. 842/1438), then Hamza Beg (d. 848/1444), strove to preserve their father's heritage, sometimes in conflict with the Egyptian sultans, sometimes with their support and that of the Ottomans, but either way without any marked success, failing in particular to repel Jahan Shah's inroads into their dominions, which were eventually reduced to the region between Diyarbakr and Arzinjan. Nor was the decline of Aq Quyunlu power affected by the recognition 'AH Beg had succeeded in eliciting from Shah Rukh and the sultan of Cairo. Incidentally, after 'All's death this was also to earn for Hamza the rank of an Egyptian amir.
168



THE RISE OF UZUN HASAN AQ QUYUNLU
Circumstances began to change only with the accession of 'AH Beg's son Jahangir. Under his rule some at least of the land seized by the Qara Quyunlu was recovered. But his endeavours to restore the previous territorial position and to consolidate his confederation were hindered by family disputes which constantly impelled him into conflict with his uncles and cousins. Particularly troublesome in this respect were his father's two brothers, Qasim Beg and Shaikh Hasan. The one looked for support to the Egyptian Mamluks, the other received it from the Qara Quyunlu, thus threatening Jahanglr's very existence. He therefore sent his brother, Uzun Hasan, against his uncle. The battle ended with Shaikh Hasan's defeat and death. The good understanding between the two brothers - based, it would seem, on yet other services rendered by Uzun Hasan — subsequently proved illusory. At any rate there can have been no question of brotherly affection in the summer of 85 7/145 3, if not actually earlier, when Uzun Hasan, during Jahanglr's absence, seized the town of Diyarbakr (Amid) by a ruse and at once became master of the Aq Quyunlu. The resulting situation must have reflected the actual balance of power, for Jahangir, in spite of many and dogged attempts during the years that followed, was unable to regain his position and finally had to be content with retaining only Mardin, where he ended his days in 874/1469.
Uzun Hasan's rule not only led to the resurgence of the Aq Quyunlu, but represents the most successful of all the Turkmen undertakings discussed so far. This cannot be attributed to unusually favourable circumstances, of which, except for the decline of Timurid power, there is no question. Not even the fortunes of war by which Uzun Hasan was so often, though by no means always, favoured suffice to explain his success. More important than any other circumstance were the outstanding qualities by which he was distinguished, not merely as a military leader, but also as a statesman.
It is questionable whether the conquest of Constantinople by Sultan Mehmed II in 857/1453 was, in the eyes of oriental princes, so epochmaking an event as it was to the minds of Western observers, both then and later. There are many indications to show that the sultan failed to impress Uzun Hasan as a result. To the latter the Comnenian empire at Trebizond, even after 1453, was not a doomed structure, but a power factor with which, at least to a certain extent, its neighbours must continue to reckon. At any rate he carried on the tradition of his house, to which we have already alluded, marrying in 863/1458 Kyra

THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
Katerina, a daughter of the emperor Kalo Johannes, a princess generally known, even in European chronicles, as "Despina Khatun". Uzun Hasan forged another family link — with Shaikh Junaid, the enterprising chief of the community of the Safavid order at Ardabll (851-64/1447-60). After the difficulties the latter had experienced ten years earlier with Jahan Shah, he now found himself invited for a long visit by the new ruler who gave him his sister Khadija Begum in marriage. While this course may have been dictated by the sympathy he felt for dervishes in general, and for the young shaikh in particular, there must certainly have been some dominant political considerations. In the years that followed his seizure of power, Uzun Hasan not only held his own in conflict with his brother Jahanglr and other kindred, but also engaged in numerous campaigns to enlarge and round off his territory and to consolidate his power. During that time he gave evidence of political skill and military prowess which nearly always brought success, whether in the conquest of the domains of Hisn Kaifa on the Tigris (866/1462) and Qoylu Hisar on the river Kelkit (863/1459), the capture of the fortress Shabin Qara Hisar, his first campaigns in Georgia (145 9,1462-3) or the expulsion from Kharput (869/1465) of the Dulghadir (a Turkmen tribe whose rulers were related to the Ottomans by marriage and had their capital at Abulustan). It was inevitable that such successes should arouse the suspicions of his powerful neighbours, the Ottomans in the west, the Qara Quyunlii and the Timurids in the east, and the Egyptian Mamluks in the south. Since Uzun Hasan did not merely impinge upon their spheres of interest, but in a number of cases actually invaded their territories, serious conflicts were bound to develop. It must have been clear to Uzun Hasan that sooner or later there would come a life and death struggle. The Aq Quyunlu's closest neighbours, and hence the most threatened by their expansion, were the Qara Quyunlii, and it was from that quarter that the first strong reaction came. Even before Uzun Hasan's seizure of power there had been a clash between the two rivals. Jahan Shah had then been unable to break Jahanglr's resistance, but had extorted from him a declaration of loyalty recognising the suzerainty of Tabriz. A few years later Jahanglr, as a defence measure against his brother's political coup, had asked the Qara Quyunlii for support. But their reinforcements were beaten back. When Jahan Shah claimed suzerainty over Uzun Hasan as well, the latter went no further than to give assurances of allegiance.



THE RISE OF UZUN HASAN AQ QUYUNLU
In the long run this failed to satisfy Jahan Shah, and in the spring of 871/1467 - that is, in the year following the conquest of Baghdad - he decided on a campaign against the Aq Quyunlii in upper Mesopotamia. It may have been partly the pacific nature of Uzun Hasan's letters that led him to believe that there was no immediate danger and hence to spend the summer in the region of Khuy. When, at the end of Rabl' I 872/October 1467, he eventually entered the eastern Anatolian plain of Mush, he was overtaken by the premature onset of wintry conditions, interrupted his campaign against Uzun Hasan, sent the majority of his troops into winter quarters and with a small following made his way northwards. Uzun Hasan, who had been keeping a wary eye on his opponent's movements, was in no way put out by the change in weather, seeing it rather as an opportunity. While Jahan Shah was encamped near Sanjaq in the Chapakchur region, Uzun Hasan took advantage of the negligence of the Qara Quyunlii to attack in the halflight of dawn on 14 Rabl' II 872/11 November 1467. Jahan Shah was surprised in his sleep, after a night of of drunkenness, according to the sources. Though he succeeded at the last moment in making his escape, he was killed as he fled by one of Uzun Hasan's soldiers. The defeat was total, for his sons MuhammadI, the crown prince, and Abu Yusuf also fell into enemy hands, the latter being blinded, the former killed later on. Jahan Shah's death also brought about the dissolution of his kingdom. It is true that Hasan 'AH, one of his surviving sons, was able to take up the succession, but in spite of the considerable following that he collected at first, he was not long able to maintain his position. With the Aq Quyiinlu hot on his heels, he fled to the region of Hamadan where, in Shawwal 873/April 1469, he committed suicide. His brother Abu Yusuf, who had regained his freedom, also paid with his life for his attempt to restore the power of the Qara Quyunlii in Fars. Thus the
political role of the Qara Quyunlii in the Near East came to an end.1 The fact that a few decades later one branch of the dynasty succeeded in founding a kingdom on Indian soil at Golkonda is outside the scope of this work. With the elimination of the ruling family both the state of the Qara Quyunlii and the confederation of that name disappeared. Their territories soon fell to Uzun Hasan. Individual tribes which had

belonged to their alliance looked for new affiliations; many found them with the victor, whose confederation thus gained in size and striking power.
HEYDAY OF THE AQ QUYUNLU
With the unexpected victory over Jahan Shah, Uzun Hasan took the centre of the stage of Persian history. Whereas previously he had been no more than an ambitious Turkmen prince with territorial interests outside Iran, the heritage of the Qara Quyunlu which he now took over brought him at one stroke dominion over nearly the whole of Persia. He also became the immediate neighbour of the Timurids, however, and while he and his forebears had remained their loyal allies since the days of Tlmur, it seemed improbable that his sudden rise to power could fail to disturb them. It will be remembered that Jahan Shah's expansion eastwards after 850/1447, the year of Shah Rukh's death, had occurred at the Timurids' expense. Herat, which he had later also occupied but had then relinquished, had been the price he had had to pay for a good understanding with Tlmur's great-grandson Abu Sa'Id when in Safar 863/December 1458 domestic problems had compelled his return to his home territory. It was to Abu Sa'Id also that Hasan 'All had successfully turned for support against Uzun Hasan after his father's death. Clearly in the hope that here was an opportunity to regain at little cost the territories lost to the Tiirkmens, the Timurid moved precipitately westwards. A contributory factor was, of course, the thought of the danger to the Timurids which so active a ruler as Uzun Hasan would represent if given free scope in a new Turkmen state extending from eastern Anatolia to the borders of eastern Persia. All endeavour to restrain Abu Sa'Id's impetuous advance by negotiation proved vain; vain, too, the reminder of the alliance maintained through some generations. It cannot have been with a light heart that Uzun Hasan marched to encounter so determined an enemy. But the fortunes of war continued to smile upon him. Abu Sa'Id, who with his cavalry had rushed ahead, careless of his lines of communication, was at the mercy of the Azarbaijan winter, and finally suffered annihilating defeat on 14 Rajab 873/28 January 1469, after being surrounded on the Mughan steppe beside the lower reaches of the Araxes river. He himself was taken prisoner and ten days later was executed.
J74



HEYDAY OF THE AQ QUYUNLU
After the fall of Abu Sa'id, the Timurids, whose dominion in eastern Persia, Afghanistan and Turkestan continued to survive for several decades, presented no danger worthy of the name to the Aq Quyunlti. It was only now that the latter could feel secure in the possession of the land they had seized after their victory over the Qara Quyunlii. They had risen to be virtually the only uncontested power in Persia. That Uzun Hasan was conscious of the role thus devolving upon him is apparent from his prompt transfer of his capital from Amid in Diyarbakr, one of Anatolia's local centres of power, to Tabriz. By so doing he chose a residence with an ancient tradition where not only the Qara Quyunlu had previously had their capital, but also the Mongol Tl-Khans and their heirs, the Jalayirids. This procedure symbolised the assumption of power in Persia; it also led to a new phase, the second great wave of Turkmen population elements which flooded back from Anatolia into the Iranian highlands and for a century afterwards was to play a considerable role in the development of that country, as will presently be shown. News of Uzun Hasan's astonishing rise spread not only among his eastern neighbours, but also among the Western powers. While their interest in the Near East during the first half of the 9th/15 th century had been determined largely by the old idea of the crusade, that is to say the liberation of the Holy Sepulchre and the conquest of Egypt along with Syria and the Arabian peninsula, since the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 8 5 7/145 3 the new and most important motive had been the reconquest of that city, and even the word "crusade" had finally come to mean the struggle against the Ottomans. The fall of Constantinople, too, had made plain to the West the growing danger that Ottoman expansion represented. Pope Nicholas V had promulgated a bull on 30 October 145 3 in which he called for a crusade against the Turk. At the same time he had sent to the east an ambassador, probably the Franciscan Ludovico da Bologna, to win allies behind the back of the powerful monarch. Even though the idea of a pact with non-Christian powers was not exactly popular in the West, it was far from being a new one, for Western powers had previously negotiated with the Mongols to effect an alliance behind the back of the Egyptian Mamluks. Venice, too, who saw her interests in the eastern Mediterranean threatened, had already despatched a mission to "Persia" in 1454. Although at that early date Uzun Hasan had not shown himself prepared to discuss proposals for an alliance against the
175



THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
Ottomans, he would seem to have been alive to its inherent possibilities and to have desired to show himself uncommitted; for a group of ambassadors of Anatolian princes arriving in Rome in 1460, whence they were to proceed to other European courts, included a Turkmen ambassador whose presence among envoys predominantly Christian aroused considerable attention. Before long Uzun Hasan adopted a positive policy and, indeed, after 872/1467, became the moving force behind the busy interchange of diplomatic missions, a subject that will be treated in greater detail in a later chapter. This can be seen as a presage of the imminent struggle with the Ottomans, the more so since Uzun Hasan had been forced to witness the Ottoman conquest of Trebizond in 865/1461. The idea of an East-West anti-Turkish league had numerous and sometimes changing advocates both on the European side and on that of Asia Minor. The Curia, Venice, Naples, and other powers were the partnership that corresponded to the Trebizond, Georgian and Turkmen princes. But just as Venice was to become the principal spokesman in the West, so Uzun Hasan eventually assumed that position in the East. Preliminary agreements in 1458 were followed by an alliance in 1464, and this was further strengthened when relations culminated in the mission of Caterino Zeno. The latter left for Tabriz in 1471, probably at the beginning of October, and did not return to Venice for another four years. Being personally acquainted with the East, and even related to Uzun Hasan through his wife, a niece of Despina Khatun, he was particularly well-equipped for his mission. On account of the TurcoVenetian war (867-84/1463-79) the Turkmen alliance had certainly acquired a new significance for the Signoria, especially since the Ottomans had conquered the Morea, Lesbos, and also Euboea (875/1470), which had been in Venetian hands for 264 years. The object of all these negotiations was common and coordinated military action to destroy the Ottoman empire, as well as agreement on the distribution of eventual spoils. Over and above this, Uzun Hasan had expressed the urgent request that Venice should supply him with artillery and other firearms so that in this respect at least he could be a match for the Ottomans, who were already thus equipped. These weapons were despatched by decision of the Senate on 4 February
1473The Porte, naturally, was not unaware of what was going on. Through Uzun Hasan's rise to power, Sultan Mehmed II, the con
176



HEYDAY OF THE AQ QUYUNLU
queror of Constantinople, found himself increasingly in the same kind of situation as had existed on the eve of the catastrophe of 804/1402, except that this time his enemies both to the East and to the West were in agreement. There were precedents not only for the East—West confrontation but also for the involvement of Asia Minor. By his marriage with the Despina, Uzun Hasan had become part of an alliance directed against the Ottomans, thus joining forces with the rulers of
Trebizond, Georgia and Qaraman, and in the following year, 1459,n e had sent a mission to the Sublime Porte requesting that the latter should waive the contributions paid yearly by the emperor of Trebizond, while at the same time he reminded him of the annual presents formerly made by the sultan to the rulers of Diyarbakr. For more than fifty years this had not been paid. The negative outcome of the move can hardly have come as a surprise. None the less it provided a pretext for Uzun Hasan to attack the small principality of Qoylu Hisar on the river Kelkit which commanded the approaches from central to eastern Anatolia and to Trebizond. While this failed to bring him lasting success, he had at least shown that he regarded himself as the protector of the Comnenian dynasty. When in 865/1461 Mehmed II advanced to attack Trebizond, Uzun Hasan sent his troops to meet him between Arzinjan and Kamakh, though after several unsuccessful skirmishes he was forced to acknowledge that he could not obstruct the sultan's intentions. He was clever enough to avoid a premature trial of strength, but sought rather to come to an understanding by despatching his mother, Saral Khatun, into the Ottoman camp, not, it would seem, without success. In spite of this reverse and his quite manifest desire for the moment to avoid a definite break with the sultan, he still did not relinquish his Anatolian ambitions; and indeed his western commitments hardly allowed him to do so. For if that alliance were to be fully effective, he must needs maintain direct contact with his European allies. How else, for instance, could arms reach him from Venice? Since at this time Cyprus was governed by King Jacques II de Lusignan, husband of the Venetian Catarina Cornaro, and so was open to Venetian ships, it was clear that Uzun Hasan must seek access to that part of the Anatolian coast facing the island. The way that led there passed through Qaraman country, where Uzun Hasan's interests clashed with those of the Ottomans and the Egyptians. A favourable opportunity arose when, in 868/1464, after the death of the Qaramanid Ibrahim, his eldest



THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
son Ishaq was driven out by his brother Plr Ahmad, and sought help from his father's old friend, Uzun Hasan. This was forthcoming, and with Turkmen support he regained his throne. So important was Qaraman to Mehmed, however, that by the spring he had restored the former status quo in Qonya, the Qaraman capital. Whether the ruler of the Aq Quyunlu was deterred by the death of his protege a short while after, or by fear of provoking the Porte, or by developments to the east of his territory, he did not seek to intervene when the sultan reinstated Plr Ahmad, nor yet when he drove him out again not long afterwards, to incorporate Qaraman within his own dominions. If to modern eyes Uzun Hasan's actions seem predominantly aggressive, the impression of him that prevailed in Istanbul in his own time was one of moderation and readiness for compromise. Jahan Shah's message to the sultan, which was accompanied by a request for support, that he was about to march against the Aq Quyunlu, met with refusal on the grounds that the Porte had no cause for war with Uzun Hasan. It can only be assumed that a campaign in the east did notfitin with the sultan's plans. Doubtless, too, he also nourished the conviction that, if it came to a crisis, the ruler of Amid would present a problem no greater than had any of the other potentates of the Anatolian hinterland, and could be dealt with as had recently those of Trebizond and Qaraman, a fatal miscalculation, as it turned out, when by his victories over Jahan Shah and Abu Sa'Id Uzun Hasan had grown to be almost the leading power in the Near East. For not even Istanbul could dismiss as a mere Anatolian princeling a ruler having at his disposal the combined resources of eastern Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Azarbaljan and Persia. Moreover, his Western alliance, of which the effects were gradually becoming perceptible, now appeared in a quite different light. With such an enemy in his rear, the sultan's hands were tied in regard to his far-reaching ambitions in the west and north-west, for were he to leave his eastern frontier exposed he would have to reckon with the threat of surprise attack. Uzun Hasan did not hesitate to take advantage of the changed situation. Significantly, he began with Qaraman, returning for the first time to the plans which the sultan had thwarted in 1469. It would seem that he had already undertaken an expedition against Qaraman in 875/1471, but without success. The following year a strong force set out, ostensibly against the Dulghadir in Abulustan, but in reality once more against Qaraman. To mislead the sultan and his informers in
178



HEYDAY OF THE AQ QUYUNLU
Anatolia, Uzun Hasan simultaneously sent a mission to Istanbul, soliciting a pardon for the Qaramanids exiled from Qonya, while all the time these were marching on their country with the Turkmen levies. In August Turkmen troops laid waste Toqat and pressed on through Slvas to Qaisariyya and Qaraman. Certainly Uzun Hasan's immediate objective was to contact his western allies on the Mediterranean coast and to take delivery of the firearms which had arrived there meanwhile from Venice. Nevertheless, ultimately all his military activity was directed against the Ottoman sultan: it was a question of supremacy in Anatolia. If further proof was required in Istanbul of the gravity of the situation, it was forthcoming in the news that Admiral Pietro Mocenigo, well-known to the Turks from many a battle as a daring enemy, had entered Qaramanian waters with a fleet of ninety-nine Venetian, Neapolitan, Papal and Cypriot galleys and was conquering towns and fortified places on the coast. Uzun Hasan's advance on Qaraman was intentionally planned for late summer because this meant that the sultan must first muster his troops, then bring them over a large distance, and hence would not be able to counter-attack before the winter, so that nothing was to be feared from that quarter earlier than the following spring. Under these circumstances it might have been expected that Uzun Hasan would shortly make his way south-west to join his allies in person. But this was not to be. When news of the destruction of Toqat reached Mehmed II, he knew that the time had come for action. Undeterred either by the lateness of the season or by the warnings of his cautious advisers, he demonstrated his intentions by transferring the royal camp to the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus and made everything ready so that he could march on eastern Anatolia in the spring without any further delay, a plan which in fact he put in operation. At the first encounter between the two forces, which took place between Arzinjan and Tarjan, Uzun Hasan's troops were victorious. But in the decisive battle at which both rulers were present, on 16 Rabl' I 878/11 August
1473, n e a r t n e village of Bashkent on the Otluqbeli, the Ottomans triumphed; and every detail of the battle is described in a victory

THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
effect of their artillery on the Turkmen cavalry in this battle was
devastating.1 The result of this struggle was a peace treaty whereby the Euphrates became the western frontier of the Turkmen empire, a demarcation which Uzun Hasan and his successors were in fact to observe. While their defeat at Bashkent can be seen as an indication that the Turkmens had reached the limits of their expansion and had passed the zenith of their political development, the defeat was of little immediate consequence to the Turkmen empire, if only because Mehmed II did not exploit his victory but refrained from the pursuit of his conquered foe. Perhaps this circumstance also explains why the Western powers so obviously underrated the extent and significance of the Turkmen defeat. How otherwise is it comprehensible that Venice should actually have intensified her efforts to involve Uzun Hasan in common action against the Ottomans after the disaster of 878/1473, although in retrospect it is obvious to historians that this had shattered the Western-Turkmen alliance? The defeat at Bashkent, which set the final seal upon Uzun Hasan's failure in Qaraman, did in fact preserve him from a clash with Egypt, the fourth of his powerful rivals, which would have been inevitable had he continued to press onwards towards the Mediterranean. As it turned out, however, his relations with the Mamluks, which up till then had been clouded only by an occasional episode, were to remain more or less friendly until the end of his reign. We have recounted in detail only those of Uzun Hasan's military operations which are of significance in the expansion of his kingdom or in the general field of politics, while lesser operations such as his campaigns in Georgia or his battles with the Kurds have been men
tioned, if at all, only cursorily.'Of the further struggles after 1473, onty the rebellions of his sons, Ughurlu Muhammad in Shiraz and Maqsud in Baghdad (879/1474), and that of his brother Uvais in Ruha (880/1475) are worthy of note. In these, needless to say, his military skill did not again fail him. More important than a detailed account of these occurrences, which we can now leave behind, is a survey of the forces which Uzun Hasan employed in the conquest of his kingdom and for the maintenance of order within it. Some reasonably reliable figures are available in a study

of an account of a review held by Prince Khalll, governor of the province of Fars, in 881/1476.* We are told that the standing army consisted of 25,000 horsemen and 10,000 infantry, with corresponding staff and commissariat. Besides these there were the contingents of the provincial governorships, among which Fars led with an almost equal strength, while the rest of the provinces put up levies commensurate with their smaller capacity. All in all, Uzun Hasan probably had at his disposal an army of more than 100,000 men. The strength of that army lay in its exceptionally effective cavalry, according to the eye-witness account of the Venetian ambassador, Caterino Zeno; its weakness, as we have seen, was its lack offirearms,and particularly of artillery. Besides military qualities, Uzun Hasan also possessed striking political ability. This was particularly apparent during the final phase of his reign, from about 875/1471 to 882/1478. To this time probably belongs the Qaniin-ndma-yi Hasan Padishah, a kind of legal code, of whose con
tents the greater part at least is known to us.2 It concerns the codification of fiscal regulations as handed down, probably from ancient times, in many different parts of the Turkmen empire, and was compiled with the intention of protecting the people against arbitrary increases in existing taxation and the introduction of new taxes and levies. To gauge the significance of the introduction of binding and effective fiscal laws, one need only call to mind the ruthless exploitation of the people, the oppression and the horrors of war which, for more than a hundred and fifty years, had been the predominant characteristics of that region. Not only were these laws a determining factor in the population's welfare, but they were also the prerequisite for a healthy economic life. And, indeed, the "Codex Uzun Hasan", as this compilation might be called, was still in use many decades later in regions of the Turkmen empire by then in Ottoman hands and in Persia. Eastern writers of that time mention it with approval. Its originator thus exercised a lasting influence on government and finance and secured for himself an honourable place alongside another Near Eastern reformer, the great Mongol statesman Ghazan Khan. When Uzun Hasan breathed his last on 1 Shawwal 882/5 January 1478 at the age of barely 5 3, he left behind him a Turkmen empire even larger than that lost to him eleven years earlier by Jahan Shah Qara

Quyunlu. It extended from the upper reaches of the Euphrates to the Great Salt Desert and the Kirman province in south Persia, and from Transcaucasia to Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. Uzun Hasan had made no provision for the succession; nevertheless, it seemed atfirstas though this kingdom, unlike so many other states of Turkish foundation, possessed enough internal stability to survive its founder. Even though his son Khalll Sultan, who succeeded him on the throne, was able to hold it for only a few months, his younger brother Ya'qiib who overthrew him succeeded in preserving the kingdom through twelve comparatively peaceful years. In this he was favoured by the fact that Mehmed the Conqueror's successor in Istanbul, Bayezld II (886—918/1481 —1512), was an inferior warrior, and also by having less threatening neighbours in Husain Balqara (873—911/1469—1506), the ruler of the Timurid kingdom in Herat, and in the Egyptian sultan Qa'itbal (872-901/1468-96). The predominantly peaceful conditions at this time can be ascribed to the skill shown by the young ruler in obtaining the allegiance of the country's magnates. Thus secured against many an internal difficulty, he was able to devote his whole energy to domestic policy, to cultural interests and to such military matters as even he found unavoidable. Amongst these was a victory over an Egyptian force which had been despatched in 885/1480 to conquer Diyarbakr, and also a number of campaigns, such as those in Kirman, Georgia, Gllan and Mazandaran which were judged to be necessary during his reign. From beginning to end, none of these operations presented any real threat. Such cannot have been Ya'qub's estimation of the events of 893/1488, that is to say, the machinations of his cousin and brotherin-law, the young leader of the community of the Safavid order at Ardabll. We have already seen his father, Shaikh Junaid, as the foe of the Qara Quyunlu and protege of Uzun Hasan. Subsequently he had met his death in 864/1460 during a battle with the Shirvan-Shah Khalll Sultan, whom he had provoked on the occasion of an attack upon the Circassians. His son and successor, Shaikh Haidar, also waged a war against the Circassians the motives of which will be discussed in the chapter on the Safavids. In order to reach their country, which was not adjacent to Ardabll but about 250 miles away, he had to march through Shlrvan, which was subject to the Aq Quyunlu. Although he had not omitted to obtain Ya'qub's permission, the increased power that accrued to him from the very active support of sufl followers seems to
182



DECLINE AND END OF THE AQ QUYUNLU
have aroused suspicions in Tabriz and as a result he was invited in 891-2/1487 to Ya'qub's court, where he had to swear an oath of fealty. But only a year later, the Turkmen leader, happening to be at Qum, received a call for help from the Shlrvan-Shah Farrukh-Yasar, his brother-in-law, whom the shaikh had attacked and beleaguered in his capital city, Shamakhl, while returning from a campaign against the Circassians. Circumstances cannot have left him long in doubt as to his course of action in regard to these two brothers-in-law, since he must have feared that the victorious Safavid shaikh, were he also to conquer Shlrvan, would become a serious menace to himself. He therefore despatched troops and set out himself for Shlrvan. On 29 Rajab 893/9 July 1488 the Safavid forces were vanquished by the Tiirkmens near the village of Dartanat at the foot of the Alburz mountains, Shaikh Haidar being killed during the righting. It could not then have been predicted that, in spite of their annihilating defeat, the future belonged to the Safavids. The necessary preconditions did not arise until after Sultan Ya'qub's sudden death in 896/1490, when the resulting continuous struggle for power among the Turkmen princes brought about a condition of chaos.
THE DECLINE AND END OF THE AQ QUYUNLU
Under the last representatives of the Aq Quyunlu dynasty, Balsunqur (d. 898/1493), Rustam (d. 902/1497), Ahmad Govde (d. 903/1497), Alvand (to 907/1502), Muhammad! (d. 905/1500), and Murad (to 908/1503), the empire created by their grandfather Uzun Hasan fell into decay. Its future development had already been presaged when Sultan 'All, son of the Safavid Shaikh Haidar, secured the succession for Rustam. Their friendship did not last long. Fleeing before the troops of his now mistrustful protege, he was killed in 899/1494. It was reserved to his brother Isma'U, born in 892/1487, to secure the heritage of the Aq Quyunlu for the Safavids — in Persia for good, but temporarily only in eastern Anatolia, until the Ottoman victory. In 907/1501 he ascended the throne in Tabriz and defeated Alvand the following year. With the conquest of Mardin, held by the Aq Quyunlu until some time
prior to 913/1507,1 and the almost simultaneous flight of Murad from Baghdad to Turkey, Turkmen rule came to an end.

THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
Historians of the West are not forward in praising Turkmen achievement, including that of the Aq Quyunlu, and its subsequent
influence in the field of culture.1 This might, however, appear in a more favourable light if seen against the background of the appalling conditions brought about by the Mongol invasions and Tlmur's campaigns. In the general devastation of the Near East, architectural activity such as that of the Aq Quyunlu, especially of Uzun Hasan and Ya'qub, however little of it may have survived, has a certain significance in that it formed a connecting link with later, happier times. The relations they established with Western powers were also to have certain repercussions. Finally, the intellectual life at the court of Tabriz under Uzun Hasan and Ya'qub was distinguished by the presence of a number of eminent men whose names have gone down in the history of Persian thought.
The Aq Quyunlu are supposed to have belonged to the Sunna, and are therefore seen as directly contrasting with the Qara Quyunlu. This dichotomy may well be due to a failure in discrimination, itself perhaps the result of reliance on the classifications of eastern, and notably Shl'I, writers. We have already seen that the Shl'I zeal of the Qara Quyunlu has certain doubtful features, and probably much the same applies to Uzun Hasan's SunnI orthodoxy, of which the pro-dervish policy, not only towards the Ardabil shaikhs, is somewhat suspect. It should not be overlooked that the SunnI label attaching to the Aq Quyunlu, who repeatedly engaged in strife with the Safavids during the phase of their decline, is problematical, especially when based on later Shl'I accounts. In future research rather more consideration should be given to the religious factor. The political structure of the Aq Quyunlu, like that of the Qara Quyunlu, was based in many respects upon Mongol foundations and the Jalayirids must be regarded in this instance as its mediators. Uzun Hasan's reforms have already been discussed. While his achievement appears to have been the stabilisation of existing principles of law so as to prevent arbitrary fiscal innovations, towards the end of Ya'qub's reign there was an energetic attempt to eradicate utterly such principles of Mongol taxation as were out of step with the prescriptions of Islamic religious law, and to set up the latter in their stead. Although the attempt failed and Sultan Rustam (897—902/1492—7) returned to

the old customs,1 it was repeated, once again without success, under Ahmad Govde ("the Dwarf"), who during the years of his exile had become familiar with the corresponding Ottoman regulations. With the fall of the Aq Quyunlu, the second wave of Turkish population elements flowing back from Anatolia to the east, to Azarbaljan and the Iranian highlands, came to an end. When it had been in full spate, states had been founded that seemed full of promise, but their success was never of long duration. They were too closely bound up with exceptional individuals, and there was no sound political organisation to ensure their continuance. In the final analysis, the nomadic form of life and government were still too strong. Although neither Turkmen confederation was destined to have noteworthy reverberations, the role of their respective ethnic groups was not yet played out.

CHAPTER 5
THE SAFAVID PERIOD
In the summer of 906-7/1501,l after his victory over the Aq Quyunlu, Isma'Il entered the Turkmen capital Tabriz, ascended the throne and took the title of Shah. He thereby founded the rule of the Safavid dynasty in Iran which was to last until 1148/1736. Thus after becoming Grand Master of the Ardabil order on the death of his brother Sultan 'All, hefinallyattained the political power in pursuit of which his father and grandfather had already lost their lives. Whether we think of this event as marking the beginning of modern Persian history or not, it certainly heralds a new era. The historical achievement of the Safavids was to establish a strong, enduring state in Iran after centuries of foreign rule and a lengthy period of political fragmentation. Although the preceding Turkmen dynasties, the Qara Quyunlu and the Aq Quyunlu, created certain preconditions of this achievement and on the surface pursued similar aims for a short time came near, indeed, to realising them — their success was only temporary. Despite all their military and political attainments in the late 8th/14th and 9th/15 th centuries — for example, the way in which they maintained their independence vis-a-vis such powerful neighbours as the Ottomans, the Mamluks and the Timurids, or founded new states culminating in the kingdoms of Jahan Shah and Uzun Hasan - not one of their rulers succeeded in establishing a lasting political structure. Though their rule extended deep into Persian territory, it represents from the point of view of the history of Persia merely peripheral formations beyond or on the frontiers of Iran. Not until the Safavid era did Iran witness the rise of a state similar in importance to the Ottoman empire or the empire of the Egyptian Mamluks. For more than two centuries the Safavid kingdom prolonged the older political and cultural tradition of Persia and endowed the country and its peoples with a unique character of historic significance, which has in part endured even up to the present day. Its typical features include the revival of the monarchist tradition, the acquisition of historically justified territory, the creation of a new military and political structure, the spread of a

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
Shl'I creed as the state religion, the Iranicisation of Persian Islam, the continued progress of modern Persian towards becoming the language of politics and administration in modern Iranian history, and the development of a specific culture which reached its peak in architecture (still visible today), but which also produced remarkable results in the intellectual life of the Persian nation. The importance of this dynasty is not confined to the national history of Persia: it was the Safavids who led Iran back on to the stage of world history. Their conflicts with the Ottomans and their policy of alliance with the Western powers have a world-historical interest and a direct relevance to the history of Western Europe.
THE BACKGROUND OF THE SAFAVIDS
Who was this Isma'Il, who made such an impact on the Persia of his time and whose influence was still felt centuries later? His personality presents difficulties to the historian which cannot be resolved adequately by reference to either his biography or his career. Rather, they become clear and comprehensible only when one considers his origins and the strange intellectual climate which produced him. We have already met his father, Shaikh Haidar, and his grandfather Junaid as notably enterprising characters in Turkmen history, politically ambitious representatives of the Safaviyya, a widespread sufI order centred on Ardabll in the south-western coastal region of the Caspian Sea. The early history of this order differs little from that of other Islamic
conventicles,1 but the political development in which it culminates is quite unique. The order is named after Shaikh SafI al-Dln Ishaq, whose lifespan (650-735/1252-1334) coincides almost exactly with the Persian Mongol empire of the Il-Khans, a circumstance which in several respects helped to determine his life and actions. This era constitutes a special period in the history of Islam. With the destruction of the Caliphate by the Mongols and the decline of almost all the previous centres of power in the Islamic East, Islam was faced with a grave crisis, both political and religious; indeed, even its very existence seemed threatened. Moreover, after the numerous theological disputes and the endless wrangling between heretical sects in preceding

BACKGROUND OF THE SAFAVIDS
centuries, the chance of a reconciliation of the warring factions and a reversion to the essential elements of the faith might have been found in this very crisis. It cannot be said that the opportunity was exploited: even at this point Islam did not undergo a genuine renaissance or reformation. However, in the territories under Mongol rule at least, certain differences were pushed into the background, for example, the split between the four schools of law and the violent opposition between the Sunna and the Shi'a, the origin of which - the question of the legitimate ruler of the Islamic world - had lost its immediate significance in the light of the Mongol victory. With the loss of the political background, the official theology, which had never been popular because of its rationalism, was deprived of much of its importance and influence. A popular religiosity became widespread, displaying several characteristics which had probably existed earlier but which had not prevailed owing to orthodox hostility. These included a marked willingness to believe in miracles, a cult of saints with the growth of muchfrequented places of pilgrimage, and even the veneration of 'All, the cousin and son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad, an aspect fundamental to ShI'I belief but which does not necessarily have the same importance in Folk Islam since even devout Sunnis have venerated 'All as amir al-mu'minln. They also included Islamic mysticism, which had flowered long before the Mongol invasion but now underwent a great revival. At the same time the sufl orders which practised it expanded to unprecedented dimensions. Their shaikhs were known and loved by the masses and the great respect commanded by certain masters of the religious chapters filled the scholarly theologians with envy and resentment. In this respect Shaikh Safi was a typical religious leader, a representative of Folk Islam far removed from the official theology, whose spokesmen viewed his career with grave suspicion. But in no other regard: for even his origins as a member of a respected family which had lived in Ardabll for generations, are by no means typical of the religious leaders of the time, who normally came from the lower classes. Although he was renowned for asceticism and piety, he displayed other qualities which for the most part accord ill with a propensity for the meditative existence of a recluse: self-confidence, enterprise, acquisitiveness and a militant activism. Shaikh Safi is portrayed as a paradoxical personality in which the miracle worker and man of God combined with a sober, practical politician and a cunning merchant.
191



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
His teacher, Taj al-Dln Ibrahim GllanI, known as Shaikh Zahid
(b. 615/1218, d. 700/1301),] a familiar figure in the history of Islamic religious orders, is said to have perceived his extraordinary gifts at their very first meeting and - according to the legend - to have realised even then that he was destined to become conqueror of the world. At all events, Shaikh Zahid allowed him to marry one of his daughters and appointed him as his successor. Round about 1300, perhaps while his spiritual leader was still alive, Shaikh SafI founded his own order in Ardabil, the Safaviyya. He never in fact conquered the world, but Shaikh Zahid's assessment of his other qualities proved accurate. As grand master of his order, as one of the holy men who in those days ruled alongside the political leaders, he achieved extraordinary success. Unless we are very much mistaken, his cell even became the focal point of a mass religious movement. He was friendly with the secular rulers and enjoyed remarkable esteem on their part; undoubtedly their attitude was determined by the size of his following and his influence over the people. He became the protector of the poor and the weak, while his convent at Ardabil became a refuge for the persecuted and the oppressed. In the last analysis he owed his popularity not merely to his reputation for sanctity, miracles and prophecies, but also to his political authority and to the wealth which he acquired in due course through the generous gifts of his supporters and admirers. His network of disciples and emissaries, so we are told, extended throughout the land from the Oxus to the Persian Gulf, from the Caucasus to Egypt. An emissary (khalifa) of his is even said to have
risen to a position of influence in Ceylon.2 The intertwining of religion and politics in Islam, such as is seen in the history of the Prophet Muhammad himself, is also a characteristic feature of the Safavids which, as we can see, marks even the career of their founder. Although he was not very concerned with secular power, he certainly did not lack political influence. The integrity of his religious position is beyond question. Not only his good works and his asceticism, but also his missionary efforts to convert the Mongols, many of whom were not of the Islamic faith, and his influence on certain Turkish or Turkmen groups stamp him as a particularly consci
entious Muslim. The theory3 that he dreamed of a renewal of Islam

which would transcend the dogmatism of the theologians and the squabbling of the heretics is not without foundation. He certainly could not achieve so paramount a success during his lifetime, nor did the effects of his activities, once this success materialised later, cover the whole Islamic oecumene. But the religious revival and unification of Persia which came about two centuries later are unthinkable without the brotherhood he founded — although there is no direct connection between them. Whether on the other hand Shaikh SafI envisaged a Shl'I Persia is quite a different question, with which we shall deal later. Nevertheless, his role in the Safaviyya was not confined to founding the order and giving it his name; he also established a firm basis for future development through the great number of supporters which he
won for it and the prosperity with which he endowed it.1 The ancestors of the Safavid rulers are often depicted as unassuming monks, but this image does not really correspond to the historical facts even in the earliest phase. It is scarcely appropriate for the later period either. Although we have only meagre evidence about the immediate successors of Shaikh SafI as masters of the Ardabll order, we can conclude simply from occasional references in the sources that they were highly
esteemed — by the early Ottoman sultans, among others.2 How otherwise could one explain the ambitious plans and the political aspirations of Junaid and Shaikh Haidar under the Turkmen princes of the latter half of the 9th/15 th century — aspirations which were after all by no means entirely unfulfilled?
After his entry into Tabriz, Shah Isma'U immediately proceeded to institute the Shl'I creed as the state religion. Until it is proved otherwise, we can assume that he took this decision out of religious convic
tion, not out of political expediency.3 The precise nature of Ismail's commitment to the Shl'I faith — to what extent he was familiar with and himself observed the precepts of the Shl'a — remains to be seen. At present it will suffice to affirm that he desired to abolish the Sunna with

its veneration of the Orthodox Caliphs and to replace it with the belief in 'All and the Twelve Imams. We know that Isma'il's advisers voiced grave reservations about his intention because the entirely SunnI population of Tabriz would be violently opposed to the Shl'a. But Isma'Il would not be deterred, and in fact achieved success. The first phase of Safavid rule does not lack a certain grotesque trait, in as much as theologians who were fully conversant with the Shl'a must have been few and far between at that time. Detailed information about Shi'i precepts was hard to come by; indeed, there was a lack of books from which this might have been culled. In the search for appropriate texts there eventually came to light a solitary
volume of the Qawa'id al-ahkdm ft ma'rifat al-haldl wa'l-baram of Ibn Mutahhar al-Hilli (d. 726/1325), a famous Shi'i theologian of the Mongol period. Admittedly the book was in Arabic and therefore unsuitable for general use until it had been translated into Persian, for a knowledge of Arabic could by that time no longer be presupposed among the populace. Given the tremendous importance of the introduction of the Shl'a for Isma'il's future and for Persia, we must ask ourselves what made him take this decision. It is not easy to find an answer. We do not know for certain who was the first member of the future dynasty to profess the Snfl faith. Was Isma'Il himself thefirst?Or were his father and grandfather adherents of the sect? Or must we go back even further, perhaps to Shaikh Khwaja 'All, or even Shaikh Safl in person? Circumstantial evidence of all kinds is adduced in this connection, but none is conclusive. There are various reasons for our being still so much in the dark. First, there is the lack of evidence in the sources, or at least in the reliable ones; in this context we must certainly disregard most documents written under Safavid rule and many sources which originated among their enemies. The complex relationships within Folk Islam similarly constitute an obstacle to a clear understanding of the situation. This Shl'I-Sunnl syncretism, as it might be termed, occurs in Iran from the time of the Mongol invasion, and even in the 8th/14th and 9th/15 th centuries, after the decline of the Tl-Khans, it continued to mould the religious outlook of the ordinary people. Finally, it is by no means impossible that if one or other of Isma'Il's ancestors had been a Shi'i, he might have practised taqiyja, that is, he might have concealed his convictions; this is in fact prescribed by the Shl'a whenever an open profession of the faith might be dangerous.
194



BACKGROUND OF THE SAFAVIDS
All these considerations should not be allowed to obscure the fact that even the question of what Shl'a and Sunna meant in the 9th/15 th century cannot at present be answered at all precisely. This would require careful examination of the theological writings of the age, and such an analysis we do not yet possess. For the time being we must be content to surmise that at this period the well-known definitions of earlier times were no longer entirely valid. Until we possess more detailed knowledge, we cannot define more closely the religious ideas of Isma'H's ancestors. In order to characterise the situation, the following factors may be emphasised. That Shaikh SafI was a Sunni is beyond all shadow of a doubt. Yet the orthodoxy of his beliefs should not be judged too rigidly since the mere ideas of the religious world in which he lived cannot be entirely reconciled with orthodox tenets. Significantly he belonged to the Shafi'I madbhab, that is, to precisely that school of religious law which is closest to the Shl'a and therefore normally adopted by Shl'Is who are masquerading as Sunnls. For the first hundred years after his death we have so little information that we can do no more than surmise that his successors adopted a similar position. Shaikh Khwaja 'All (d. 832/1429) could be linked with the Shl'a on account of his name and especially because he is said to have seen 'All, the fourth Caliph and son-in-law of the Prophet, in a dream, and sang his praises in verses which are still extant. Sunni writers are particularly distrustful of Junaid, the grandfather of Isma'Il, because he is alleged to have compromised himself round about 1450 in Qonya in the presence of the famous theologian Shaikh 'Abd al-Latif through a pro-Shl'I remark transmitted to us by a friend of the shaikh, the Ottoman historian 'Ashiqpashazade. We are told also that when Junaid died some of his followers began to call him God and his son Haidar the Son of God. Admittedly this statement stems from an embittered enemy of the Safavids, Fail-Allah b. Ruzbihan Khunji, the chronicler of Sultan Ya'qub Aq Quyunlu, who later fled from Isma'Il to Transoxiana. Haidar too is reported to have seen 'All in a dream. This is supposed to be the origin of the "Haidar cap", the red hat of the Qizilbash, whose twelve gores are explained by reference to the Twelve Imams. We could certainly draw conclusions from these reports if we had any certain knowledge of the dividing lines between Sunna and Shl'a in the 9th/15 th century. Since it is possible that these were no longer what



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
they had been, we must be cautious. Yet it should be noted that not one of the relevant writers describes any ancestor of Isma'Il unambiguously as a Shl'I - not even those authors who attack their religious attitude. It is also significant, on the other hand, that an unbroken, direct Shl'I tradition extending from Junaid via Haidar to Isma'Il is out of the question. Haidar was not born until 864/1460, several weeks after his father's death, and was brought up at the court of his uncle Uzun Hasan in Amid, in an environment which has so far not been suspected of sympathy towards the Shl'I doctrine. Not until he was nine years old did he arrive in Ardabll where again it is unlikely that any marked Shl'I atmosphere predominated under Shaikh Ja'far. If Haidar was actually converted to the Shl'a later, he had no opportunity to introduce Isma'Il to the creed, for Isma'Il was born on 25 Rajab 892/17 July 1487, only a year before his father's death. Haidar could not have achieved this indirectly through Sultan 'All, his eldest son, either, as the latter was still a child. In the next seven years which the sons of Shaikh Haidar spent in the custody of the Aq Quyunlu, we cannot exclude completely the possibility that they were exposed to Shl'I influence, for example on the part of their guardians, but neither can we impute this to them without further ado. Although we cannot speak of a direct transmission of ideas between those three generations, we must posit a certain virulence of Shl'I thought in order to begin to grasp the course of events. Perhaps the solution of the problem lies precisely in the fact that Shaikh SafI and his descendants, possibly including Isma'Il until shortly before his seizure of power, must be seen in the framework of Folk Islam without ever having consciously or overtly gone over to the Shl'a. In the case of adherents of a sufl order such as they, this is a perfectly reasonable conjecture in the light of all that we know. We can pass over the question of whether the equation of tasavvuf (Sufism) with the Shl'a is justified or whether it oversteps the mark: what is certain is that the step from Sufism to heresy was a fairly small one. The SunnI theologians had only too good a reason for their antipathy towards the dervishes and their religious brotherhoods. If it is permissible to link the Ardabll order from the outset with Folk Islam, certain Shl'I features become clear. Though in Folk Islam these Shl'I elements were stronger or weaker depending upon the area and the period, they were surely always present. Therefore certain Shl'I affinities in the case of Shaikh SafI and his successors (who at all events bear the stigma of
196



BACKGROUND OF THE SAFAVIDS
Sufism in the eyes of the distrustful orthodox theologians) do not necessarily mean that they had abjured the Sunna and turned Shl'I. Neither the name of Shaikh Khwaja 'All, the second successor and grandson of Shaikh SafI, nor the manifestation of 'All in dreams which he and later Shaikh Haidar are said to have had, nor his verses in praise of 'All therefore constitute clear signs of a Shl'I faith, and they are perhaps no more than features of Folk Islam. If one examines Isma'U's notions against the Folk Islam background, it is quite possible that the worship of 'All widespread in his environment grew more firmly rooted in him so that a tendency towards the Shl'a became predominant. This accords well with his youthful capacity for enthusiasm (he was only fourteen years old when Tabriz fell). We see his enthusiasm in his collection of Turkish poems, particularly where religious ideas are concerned, but also with regard to the heroes of Iranian legend. What is so disconcerting about the introduction of the Shl'a is the violent hostility exhibited towards the Sunnis, whereby the execration of the Caliphs Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman is far more strongly emphasised than the Shl'I additions to the shahdda, which is what really matters. Even if propaganda purposes played a part in this, there remains an impression of youthful protest, perhaps because Isma'il had grown tired either of the compromises of Folk Islam or of the secretiveness of taqiyya. We must not underestimate the importance for Isma'U's religious beliefs of his stay in Lahljan which followed his escape from the soldiers of Sultan Rustam Aq Quyunlu. From 899/1494 onwards he spent five years there under the protection of Karkiya Mlrza 'All, the then ruler of Gllan, who claimed to be a descendant of the Caliph 'All and was a Shl'I. He appointed one of the theologians in his kingdom, one Shams al-Dln Lahljl, to be Isma'U's teacher. This man must have influenced his pupil to a certain extent, since he occurs again, immediately after Isma'il ascended the throne, as sadr, occupying the highest religious office in the realm; later we see him as tutor to the princes at court. There is scarcely any doubt but that he was a Shl'I. And this would be certain if he should be identical with a disciple of the same name of Sayyid Muhammad Nurbakhsh, who along with Muhammad b. Falah, the famous Mahdl, had been trained by the well-known Shl'I theologian Ahmad b. Fahd al-Hilll. Whatever the truth about the religion of his forebears, where Ismil'Il himself is concerned we already have a valid explanation of the origin of his Shl'I faith in the few years



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
he spent with his tutor in Lahljan. This factor lends credence to the suggestion that his religious attitude was determined by inner conviction. His collection of Turkish poems mentioned above provides an insight into his religious ideas. The Shl'I character of these verses is unmistakable. But clearly what we have here is not something that can be related to the High Shl'a as delineated in Shl'I theology, but rather rabid fanaticism. The worship of 'All expressed here betrays an extremism which cannot be reconciled with the normal Shl'I doctrine. 'AH is named before the Prophet Muhammad and placed on a level with God. In these lines we see perhaps an unrestrained exaggeration of certain Shl'I ideas which also occur incipiently in Folk Islam. It is also significant that the particularly extreme passages are only to be found in the oldest extant versions of the collection: later manuscripts do not contain them, presumably because they derive from a version expurgated under the influence of Shl'I theologians. Anyway the creed which Isma'il avowed on coming to power could not have been the Shl'a of the theologians, no matter of what school. Even if he himself, lacking clear religious ideas, envisaged no more than changing from the Sunna to the Shl'a, his poems proclaim very different notions. Nor can they be interpreted as a gradual transition from Folk Islam to the High Shl'a. If one pursues Isma'Il's thought to its conclusion and relates it to his political intentions, one realises that he is proclaiming a Shl'I theocracy with himself at its head as a god-king.
However Isma'Il's attitude may be judged from the point of view of the official theology, his claim to be venerated as a god {sijda) did not prevent him from favouring the Ithna'ashariyya, the Twelver Shl'a, among the manifold divisions of the Shl'a existing at the time. This creed acknowledges not the Caliphs but only the Twelve Imams as the legitimate successors of the Prophet Muhammad; a succession commencing with 'All and ending with the Mahdl Muhammad HujjatAllah who, his followers believe, did not die but was merely carried off on 24 July 874, to return once more at the end of the world. It was on this theory of succession that the Safavids based their claim to be direct descendants of 'All and thereby of the Prophet Muhammad. It rests on a genealogy which links Shaikh SafI via a line of twenty ancestors with Musa al-Kazim (d. 183/799), the Seventh Imam.
198



BACKGROUND OF THE SAFAVIDS
Clearly such a lineage lent great weight to Isma'Il's bid for power in the legitimist atmosphere of the Shl'is, perhaps also in the rather monarchist concepts of certain Iranian circles. However, this lineage has not gone unchallenged. It was attacked even during the Safavid period and likewise deemed a forgery in recent times by Persian and non-Persian
scholars alike.1 It is indeed possible that the family tree of the Safavids cannot bear any closer analysis than many another table of this kind. The question still remains whether Isma'Il invoked it, knowing it to be false, or even undertook or commissioned the forgery himself as
alleged by the Ottoman historian 'All;2 or whether he acted in good faith, convinced of the authenticity of this genealogy. The answer to this question determines whether he began his extraordinary career in the honest, though biased, belief that he had a legitimate claim to the throne, or whether right from the outset he was prepared to stoop to anything, even outright forgery, to achieve his aim. Given his numerous embittered enemies, it is not surprising that he has indeed been accused of deliberate deception — unjustly, as far as one can tell. For even the Shlrvan-Shah Khaffl-Allah addresses Junaid, Isma'Il's grandfather, in a letter the text of which has been preserved, as a descendant of the Sayyids; and the Turkish Sultan Bayezld II applies to Shaikh Haidar epithets such as are only used for a scion of 'All's
family.3 If therefore alien rulers who were opposed to the Safavids accepted this notion, why should not Isma'Il himself have believed in all honesty that he was descended from 'AH? This belief is also attested by the spontaneity and originality which characterise his divan, precisely at the points where he emphasises his 'Alid blood. Finally, Isma'Il may also have been aware that Shaikh SafI himself had allegedly
claimed to be related to the Prophet's family.4 At least in childhood

But Togan thereby ignores the fact that this expression corresponds exactly to the attitude of a Sunnl who, though a descendant of 'All, does not wish to draw too much attention to himself. Togan nevertheless concedes the possibility that Shaikh SafTs son, Sadr al-Dln Musa, as is claimed, could have ordered the sharif, on the occasion of a hajj, to authenticate a genealogy going back to 'All; given this, it is unfair to dismiss outright Ismail's good faith as he does.

and certainly at the time of his accession to the throne in Tabriz, Isma'H was convinced that his family tree reached back to Caliph 'All. Whether he maintained this belief in later life, when perhaps he had access to more reliable sources of information, is another question.
Thus whether or not Isma'Il was the first of Shaikh Safl's descendants to embrace the Shl'a, he was certainly the first whose Shi'I faith can be proved without a shadow of a doubt, and was viewed in this light by
certain ioth/i6th century writers.1 The political ambitions which he combined with his faith were after all not without precedent in his family. We saw that Shaikh SafI enjoyed respect and influence among political leaders of his time, even though he did not himself pursue any political goals. That his successors were not entirely remote from the affairs of this world may be judged from Timur's legendary visit to Khwaja 'All, and we meet his son Ibrahim, described by a Christian eye-witness as the "cruel governor of Ardabil", in the retinue of Jahan
Shah on a campaign in Georgia.2 We have fairly detailed knowledge of the military and political exploits of Junaid, Shah Isma'H's grandfather. Since up to his father's death the leadership of the order had always passed from father to son, he could have inherited the office in 851/1447, and there is in fact a well-attested tradition which speaks of his accession in that year. Nevertheless, he might thereafter have lost the leadership again: this would not necessarily be recorded in the official history of the Safavids, which naturally sets out to portray Isma'H's grandfather in the appropriate light. The point is that at this time not he, but one of his father's brothers, Shaikh Ja'far, was head of the order, while he himself was mostly away from Ardabil, not always of his own accord. It is of secondary importance whether Ja'far functioned as his nephew's guardian or representative, or whether he personally was-invested with the office of grand master. What interests us is that Ja'far too did not stay remote from and uninvolved in the political events of his age, for he mobilised
against Junaid the powerful Jahan Shah Qara Quyunlii,3 who was the father-in-law of Ja'far's son Qasim. Ja'far also had contacts with the Timurid Abu Sa'id and went out to greet him when the latter reached Sultaniyya on his fatal campaign of 873/1469 to the Mughan steppe.

BACKGROUND OF THE SAFAVIDS
We also know about Ja'far's correspondence with the Shlrvan-Shah
Khalll-Allah, again to the detriment of his nephew.1 There is no doubt that, soon after Shaikh Ibrahim's death, around 852/1448 a serious estrangement occurred between Shaikh Ja'far and Junaid which was still not resolved at the time of Junaid's death. But we have no such certainty concerning its cause. The motive is sought in diverging religious beliefs. According to this explanation Ja'far, who remained faithful to the Sunna, quarrelled with his nephew because of the latter's Shi'I proclivities. This is indeed possible, but finds no adequate support in contemporary sources; one cannot draw conclusions about Junaid's early years from records which refer to his behaviour in later life. In Fazl-Allah Khunji's royal chronicle of the Aq Quyunlu, which is relevant here, we read that he diverged from the life of his forebears. This might of course allude to divergent religious beliefs, if the writer did not expressly state that he had something else in mind: he says that Junaid strove for secular power, was driven into alien lands by his lust for conquest, instigated revolts against individual provincial governors in Anatolia, and constantly suffered fresh onsets of folly. All this need not necessarily be connected with Shi'I heresy. There were probably sufficient grounds for the conflict in Junaid's militaristic tendencies alone, for we read that his multitudinous supporters occasionally gave Ardabll the appearance of an armed camp. Junaid's career doubtless gave many of his contemporaries cause for admiration or criticism, especially those who clung to the pattern of a devout life as led by his famous ancestors. He was anything but the ideal religious leader whose life was composed of pious striving and progression along the path of mystic perfection. When first exiled from Ardabll, he wandered for seven years through Azarbaijan, Anatolia and northern Syria, probably in the manner of a travelling monk but without observing the limitations of this role. His ambition was political success and a military following that would help him attain it. His charismatic personality must have had a great impact especially on the adventurous elements among the Turkmen tribes which he visited. On the other hand, he rightly saw that his opportunity lay in the rivalry between the Qara Quyunlu and the Aq Quyunlu. The hostility of Jahan Shah Qara Quyunlu drove him to cultivate the latter's opponent

in Amid and eventually in 861/1456 he succeeded in being received there. Uzun Hasan welcomed him and showed him such favour that Junaid enjoyed his hospitality for three whole years and, after some time, was even allowed to marry his sister. Although at that time Uzun Hasan was not the famous potentate he was later to become, this connection represented for the young Safavid a gain in prestige which gave many an observer food for thought in that twilight world between religion and politics.
Such events are by no means typical of the career of a member of a religious order at that period. They cannot be explained by Junaid's eminent lineage nor by the sympathy which Uzun Hasan is supposed to have shown towards dervishes. It is more fruitful to suppose that the Turkmen potentate took this unusual step out of certain political expectations, for example, the hope of winning over along with Junaid the latter's militant followers for his own cause. But such an assumption would only be reasonable if Junaid had been at this time a man of some importance or at least potentially a great military leader. And that indeed appears to have been the case. We have to postulate a change in the conception of a religious order, which seems to have occurred with Shaikh Safi's descendants. There is some evidence that with Junaid this development reached its climax. In order to understand it, we must remember that even the founder of the order had been reproached for allowing his disciples to grow too numerous for him to be able to instruct them in the precepts of the mystic initiation. In fact, he must have modified the mystic practice (such as he himself had followed under his teacher Shaikh Zahid) which he handed down to his disciples; thus the word sufl, originally denoting an Islamic mystic, seems to have declined even during his lifetime to the meaning "active Muslim", in accordance with the religious mass movement which in those days appears to have been centred on Ardabll. The esteem which the order continued to command under Safi's successors indicates that a similar situation also prevailed under their rule. We can assume that during his stay in Anatolia and northern Syria Junaid exploited the contacts which the Ardabll order enjoyed there and which in many cases it had maintained for a long time. We may even suppose that he did his best to strengthen those relations and to influence them according to his lights. Here lies the explanation of statements to the effect that at this time he had a lively following which

increased during his years at the court of Amid, and that from there he intensified recruitment by appointing new emissaries (khulafa).^ His success with Uzun Hasan must have endowed his ideas with a peculiar attraction in precisely those circles which mattered to him. At all events it is clear that his exploits must be seen in relation to the Ardabll order; this is also indicated by the fact that he did not abandon the idea of returning to the home of the order, and in 863/1459 actually attempted to gain a footing in Ardabll again — but without success. Although several aspects of Junaid's personality remain at present obscure, there is no doubt that he gave military training to the adherents of the order who lived in his retinue and used them in military operations. Here lies the origin of the equating of the words sufi and gha%i ("soldier of the faith") which is taken for granted in the Safavid chronicles thereafter. The change in meaning of the word sufi, which occurs even in the early Safaviyya, reaches a new and far more advanced stage round about this time. The change is not confined to the semantic history of one word, but has a prominent political significance. Members of a sufi order, whose mystical rule was probably preserved only as a more or less faded memory, were converted to the ideals of a Holy War which are inherent in Islam, trained as fanatical warriors and, as we shall see, actually led into battle. The ghazi idea has another historical bearing which should be mentioned here. Defenders of the faith known by this name played an important part as early as the first third of the 8th/14th century in western Anatolia, on the Byzantine frontier of the Ottoman heartlands. From the collapse of the Salju<q empire onwards, when the pressure of Mongol power on western Asia Minor lessened, they contributed substantially to the protection and extension of the frontiers with Byzantium, while the Ottoman empire was being established. Recent research shows, however, that the ghazi concept was not limited to western Asia Minor but also existed in eastern Anatolia, where they are credited with the attacks of the Aq Quyunlu on the Comnenian empire
of Trebizond,2 which was discussed earlier. That had been about the middle of the 8th/14th century. But the ghazi concept appears to have survived even after that and to have finally been taken over by Shah Isma'Il's two predecessors. This theory is supported by the fact that the Safavid chronicles prefer to use the word ghazi to denote the military

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
followers of the master of the order - not exclusively, of course, but almost more frequently than sufl or Qizilbash. It remains to be seen whether in practice the Safavids were familiar with the Jihad, the Holy War, in this sense. In fact such seems to have been the case. A fairly conclusive instance of this is Junaid's attempt to conquer Trebizond in 860-1/1456, that is, prior to his appearance at the court of Uzun Hasan, from where he could not very well have launched such a venture since after all it would have been directed against his host's relatives. He was, moreover, on the point of conquering the city, but at the last moment had to relinquish his impending victory because the Turkish Sultan, seeing his interests in Trebizond threatened, despatched an armed force to the scene which would have proved too much for Junaid. Other military adventures undertaken by Junaid can also be included under the ghazl heading; although it is clear that in Junaid's case, just as elsewhere, other motives in addition to the ghazl concept were instrumental in the attacks on non-Muslim peoples - the problems of feeding and paying a large military retinue, and the thirst of Junaid's adherents for adventure and plunder. We shall not examine
these exploits in detail.1 The last was a campaign against the Circassians of Tabarsaran, which he decided to undertake in 863/1459 after again being banished from Ardabll on the orders of Jahan Shah. This exploit met with success, but he was then attacked by the Shlrvan-Shah Khalll-Allah, through whose territory he had marched and to whom the defeated Circassians may have been tributary, and on 11 Jumada I 864/4 March 1460 was killed in battle. If we sum up Junaid's life, we see an unruly spirit with political ambitions and military propensities, but not a religious reformer. Even
if it is true that, as KhunjI claimed,2 he was worshipped as a god after his death, this betokens the unbridled fanaticism of his followers or those of his successor, rather than the nature of his own religious beliefs. Although as a member of the order he may have been susceptible to the 'All-venerating or even Shl'I tendencies in Folk Islam, he need not necessarily for that reason have been the wild Shl'I fanatic which his enemies - especially KhunjI and 'Ashiqpashazade - make him out to be. Even the quarrel with Shaikh Ja'far, as we saw, need not

BACKGROUND OF THE SAFAVIDS
have been due to religious differences. It can easily be explained by the fact that after Ibrahim's death two strong personalities whose political ambitions were irreconcilable clashed in Ardabll: Junaid's ambition may be gauged, after all, from the fact that he aspired to the headship of the order even though not his father's eldest son but only his sixth. Finally, it must remain an open question whether during his wanderings in Anatolia Junaid came across such strong Shi'I tendencies among supporters of the Ardabll order or among sections of the population which he hoped to win over, that he was compelled to profess
the Shl'a, either out of expediency or out of conviction.1
However much recent scholars have concerned themselves with the rise of the Safavids, several features of this unusual phenomenon have yet to be satisfactorily explained. We know that Turkmen adherents of the Ardabll order played an essential part, but how this participation came about cannot yet be elucidated in every detail. The question is vital not only because of the share of the Turkmen in founding the Safavid state, but also because during the first century of its existence the majority of its ruling class and, up to the time of 'Abbas I, virtually all the officers and men in the army were in fact Tiirkmens. That the Safavids themselves cannot be called Tiirkmens, in spite of their close ties and the blood relationship with the Aq Quyunlu, simply makes the problem more complicated. How then did Turkmen tribes come to play such a crucial role? Even their contemporaries in Persia probably racked their brains over this question. They searched for an explanation and found it - in a visit to Ardabll by Tlmur, a visit which he was supposed to have paid to the then head of the order, Khwaja 'AH. It is said that the latter's miracles impressed him deeply, whereupon he made Khwaja 'All a present, at his request, of 30,000 prisoners of war whom he had brought with him from Anatolia. These were the forefathers of the Tiirkmens who a century later played a prominent role in the foundation of the Safavid empire. Tlmur's visit to Ardabll is likely to have occurred in the spring of 806/1404. That it was in honour of the Safavid leader, or that he even glimpsed the latter on this occasion, is not, it is true, out of the question, but neither is it anywhere attested. Moreover, the presentation of these Anatolian prisoners is pure myth,
1 As Minorsky, "Shaikh Ball Efendi", p. 439, maintains.
205



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
since the captive nomads deported from Anatolia by Tlmur were Qara
Tatars and were subsequently settled not in Persia but in Transoxiana;1 and the story is apparently a home-grown attempt to account for the Turkmen part in the founding of the Safavid empire. A plausible explanation for their role can be found in something I have already mentioned, the spread and popularity of Islamic religious communities in the 8th-9th/i4th—15th centuries. As will be recalled, in addition to the focal point of the order at the seat of the master {murshid [-i kami/] or ptr), they had a following scattered over a wide area which kept in touch with the centre through so-called representatives or emissaries (khulafa'). We know that this following included numerous Turkmens, if not whole tribes or tribal groups. This is true in general of all such orders but especially of the Safavid order, which even in the
founder's time had had Turkish or Turkmen supporters2 and which seems later to have enjoyed an increasing popularity among the Turkmens. This Turkmen following probably extended in the main through Azarbaljan, Anatolia and northern Syria. It was thus not fortuitous that Junaid visited precisely these areas on his raids. Here he could be certain of support and assistance. On the other hand the presence of an enterprising, even fascinating, descendant of the great Ardabll Shaikh SafI could not have failed to win recruits for the local sufl groups. Although our knowledge of the early history of the Turkmen tribes, whose names occur very frequently in the sources, is in several respects incomplete, certain tribal names which can be construed with certainty confirm that they originated in the areas mentioned: the Shamlu must have had their home in Syria (Sham), the Rumlu in Anatolia or, to be more precise, in the province later known as Slvas but which earlier had been called Rum. The name Takkalu points to the province of Tekke in southern Anatolia, and Dulghadir, corrupted to the Arabic form Dhu'1-Qadr, had been since 1337 the name of a local Turkmen dynasty in Abulustan, the region between Jaihan and the Euphrates. The intellectual atmosphere to which Junaid owed his success among the Turkmens - possibly too the impression which his personality left on these simple people, who were always inclined to believe in the miraculous and the extraordinary - must have lasted a long time after his death, long enough anyway for his son Haidar to slip effortlessly, or so it seems, into his father's role. We do not know the exact

BACKGROUND OF THE SAFAVIDS
point when this happened, or when he assumed the leadership of the Safavid order. He came to Ardabll in 1470 when he was barely ten years old, from Amid, where his childhood had been spent at the court of Uzun Hasan. Perhaps his uncle sent him to the home of the order in order to neutralise Shaikh Ja'far, whose once powerful protectors, the Qara Quyunlu Jahan Shah and the Timurid Abu Sa'Id, were no longer alive. It seems indeed that Ja'far was loth to accept and tolerate his greatnephew in Ardabll. The man of religion, himself highly educated, appears to have consistently neglected to complete or at least improve Haidar's religious training which had been totally overlooked in Amid. Perhaps the love of arms which Uzun Hasan had inspired in the boy, together with a corresponding natural bent, had already grown too strong. Perhaps too the advanced politicisation of the order stood in the way of any change of heart. Unless we are very much mistaken, Haidar's self-image already suggested the son of a secular prince rather than the future head of a mystical order. "Instead of the school bench, he sat on a horse, instead of mystic treatises he read mythical tales": in
such words he is censured by Fazl-Allah b. Ruzbihan KhunjI,1 who at the same time testifies to his great courage and mastery of the arts of war. It is not surprising that under his leadership the secularisation of the order proceeded apace and its militarisation neared a climax. An external sign of this development was Shaikh Haidar's introduction of a uniform for members of his order. Its characteristic feature was a red turban with twelve gores, called taj-i haidart, the "Haidar cap". Their enemies gave the wearers of this headgear the nickname qi^tlbdshlar ("Redheads"), a designation, however, which they soon proudly adopted as a title of honour. The name Qizilbash for the followers of the Ardabll shaikhs undoubtedly goes back, together with the introduction of the red turban, to the time of Haidar. The word is not found in Tihranl's Kitab-i Diydrbakriyja, completed in 1470, but it is used by KhunjI fifteen years later in a derogatory sense. But whether even at that period as later this was bound up with a religious motif, the accusation of Shl'I heresy on the part of opponents or the public profession of the Shl'a on the part of those concerned, or whether we have here the projection of subsequent conditions back to an earlier age, cannot be ascertained with

207



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
certainty, whether or not one accepts the explanation that Haidar acted in accordance with a command given him by the Imam 'AH in a vision. Were one to relate the twelve gores, as is usually done, to the Twelve Imams, this does not necessarily indicate ShI'I convictions, since the Twelve Imams also had a place in the Folk Islam of those times. Even a SunnI sectarian like Fazl-Allah KhunjI wrote a poem in praise of the
Twelve Imams which has been preserved.1 Thereby we come to the problem of Shaikh Haidar's religious beliefs. Was he a ShI'I or not? As we have seen, in the first ten years of his life in Amid he scarcely had any religious education at all, and certainly not a ShI'I one. In Ardabll he came into contact with Shaikh Ja'far, whose orthodoxy (not, of course, to be measured by the standards of SunnI theology but rather against the more moderate conditions of Folk Islam) has never been disputed. Again, it is KhunjI alone who questions Haidar's orthodoxy, and even he does not accuse him of subscribing to the Shl'a, maintaining rather that his foolish followers worshipped Junaid as God and Haidar as the Son of God. It is difficult to accept this at its face value, especially in the case of someone with such an underdeveloped religious sensibility as Haidar. Normally, the influence exerted over him by his father's followers when he lived in Ardabll is the reason put forward for his supposed conversion to the ShI'I faith. It is of course true that Turkmen supporters of the Safavids flocked to Ardabll when it was learnt that the young shaikh was recruiting fighting men like his father before him, possibly in the aftermath of the collapse in 872/1467 of the Qara Quyiinlu confederation, whose elements may now have striven for a new relationship with the Ardabll shaikhs. One can therefore quite reasonably reckon on a strong Turkmen influence on Haidar whereby religious zeal may have been a factor — but not necessarily the ShI'I creed. Folk Islamic ideas, with a greater or lesser ShI'I tinge, combined with the ghazi concept, suffice to explain the process. And we may almost with certainty impute the ghazi idea to a military mind like that of Shaikh Haidar. He too carried the Holy War into the land of the Circassians. Twice, in 888/1483 and 892/1487, his campaigns went according to plan. The third time, in 893/1488, there was again no need for complications, because Haidar had obtained permission to march through Shlrvan.

But when he attacked the town of Shamakhl in order, we are told, to avenge his father, he came into conflict with Farrukh-Yasar, who had succeeded the Shlrvan-Shah Khalll-Allah in 867/1462. With the support of troops of the Aq Quyunlu sent to his aid by Sultan Ya'qub, the Shlrvan-Shah was victorious. Shaikh Haidar fell in battle on 29 Rajab 893/9 July 1488 in Tabarsaran, not far from the spot where his father had been killed in 864/1460.' As early as the Mongol period several Turkmen tribes had learnt to absent themselves from the arena of great events whenever danger threatened. In later times too this ability appears to have been shared by many Turkmen adherents of the Safavids, as when they vanished from the stage for many years after Junaid's death. Following Haidar's death, they again withdrew into obscurity for more than a decade and bided their time, leading the unobtrusive life of nomads.
Just as at the beginning of the 9th/15 th century the leaders of the Aq Quyunlu and the Qara Quyunlu expended all their energies in attaining military power and acquiring territorial sovereignty, so Junaid and Haidar too were dedicated to the pursuit of political goals. Then as now the notion of warring for the faith appears to have figured as a welcome motive, if not as a pretext. Whether the two Safavids were driven by a more profound religious zeal, for instance by a desire to launch a Shl'l mission, cannot at present be established and in fact seems doubtful, although in their case too the ideas of Folk Islam certainly included a series of Shl'l features. In Isma'Il's case we are faced with different assumptions, inasmuch as he spent a lengthy period of his childhood in a Shl'l enviroment and was apparently given instruction in the Shl'l faith. Moreover, he must have had a well-defined religious sensibility, as can be seen from his divan. Here he calls 'AH a manifestation of God and proudly asserts that he himself is a descendant of 'AH and Fatima who came into the world at 'All's behest. Of course such notions cannot be reconciled with the Shl'a or the Shl'l theology; but they originate in the world of the Shl'a rather than in that of Folk Islam.
1 Savory, "Haydar", EP, concludes that in view of the help rendered by the Aq Quyunlu Haidar must have had stronger forces than his father, whom the Shlrvan-Shah had defeated without outside assistance.
209



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
Although Isma'Il's statements are somewhat vague, they at least convey a marked sense of mission. This makes more comprehensible his decision in the summer of 905/1499, that is, at the age of twelve, to leave his refuge in Lahljan, despite the warnings of his protector Karkiya Mlrza 'All, in order to try to emulate the deeds of his father and grandfather. However strange this venture may seem, it was very well timed from a political point of view. The power of the Aq Quyunlu, in whose territory Isma'Il lived, had been more or less paralysed by the dispute over the succession triggered off by the death of Sultan Ya'qub in 896/1490. The role of the Timurids in Persia had been curtailed by the fall of Abu Sa'Id. Both the Ottomans in the west and the Uzbeks in the east were at this time unable - as yet, at least - to intervene in the affairs of Persia. And in Cairo, where the rule of the powerful Sultan Qa'itbal had ended in 901/1496, a grave crisis was simmering, characterised by a rapid succession of new rulers. Apart from a few local dynasties of little influence, there was a political vacuum in Persia. Since the death of his brother Sultan 'AH in 899/1494, Isma'Il had been grand master of the Ardabil order. It is not known whether he himself underwent the mystical initiation and conveyed it afterwards to
novices; in fact this seems unlikely.1 His sufism seems rather to be confined to the extreme Shl'I ideas which occur in his poetry. Nevertheless, after leaving Lahljan he made straight for Ardabil, the centre of the Safavid order. Emotional reasons may have influenced this choice, and probably too the hope that there he was most likely to attract the militant adherents of the order whom he now needed. This expectation was not in fact fulfilled, clearly because through the respect he commanded the local governor, who owed his appointment to the Aq Quyunlu, deterred members of the order from openly supporting Isma'Il. And because of this same governor Isma'Il could not remain in Ardabil. Uncertain what to do next, he decided — significantly — to lead a holy war (gha^a-ji kdfirdri) against Georgia. The messianic spirit which inspired Isma'Il had its pendant in the religious mood of the people. Many seem to have had an apocalyptic awareness at this time. Insecurity caused by war, anarchy, bandits, catastrophes, plagues and famine had given rise to religious expectations typified by the hope — shared by others besides the Shl'a — of the

ISMA'IL I
return of the Mahdl, which would mark the end of the world. There was evidence of a connection between the young Isma'Il and the Mahdl; there were even those who saw in him the returning Imam or at least his harbinger. Typical of this was the scene when Isma'Il arrived at the summer camp of the Turkmen tribe of the Ustajlu. When news of his approach reached them, the whole tribe, led by the elders (rishsafiddn), went to greet him, singing and dancing, and escorted him just as centuries earlier the old Companions {ansar) had welcomed the Prophet Muhammad in Medina when he arrived there on the Hijra from Mecca. In the stories of these Tiirkmens he was seen as the messenger of the Lord of Time {sahib al-^amdn). Isma'Il's physical appearance must also have had some effect when he entered public life. The testimony of an eye-witness depicts him as being of truly regal bearing, gentlemanly and with engaging features, a fair complexion and reddish hair. If one thinks of the enthusiasm with which even today the mostly dark-skinned Persians greet a fair-headed youth, it is easy to imagine the impact made by the young head of the order, about whom various anticipatory legends were circulating, in that period of intense religious awareness. Isma'Il's descent from the shaikhs of Ardabll, his personal appearance, his religious ideas and his sense of mission corresponded almost perfectly with the expectations which an oppressed people might nourish in their religious daydreams. His youthfulness, which arouses scepticism in the rational mind of the modern observer, must in the circumstances have fostered his plans. The great influence of the Ardabll order, the propagandist and military endeavours undertaken by his father Haidar and particularly by his grandfather Junaid among the Tiirkmens, now bore abundant fruit. He had already brought with him a group of Turkmen companions from Lahljan, and other members of these tribes joined him during his first winter camp in Arjuvan on the Caspian Sea. The intention of finding further reinforcements was certainly one of the motives behind a campaign against Arzinjan in eastern Anatolia, upon which he embarked in the middle of Sha'ban 905/March 1500. Finally his army grew to 7,000 men and he launched the intended holy war. The ghazl troops again marched on Shirvan. This time, in Jumada I 906/December 1500, at the village of JabanI near the Shirvan capital of Shamakhi, they clashed at the outset with the Shlrvan-Shah, the same Farrukh-Yasar who had defeated Isma'Il's father twelve years previously. At that time he had been helped by the Aq Quyunlu; on this
211



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
occasion he was unaided. In spite of his superiority of numbers he was vanquished and killed. Thereby Isma'Il not only avenged his father and grandfather, but also conquered a land which had enjoyed for long periods a certain independence under the family of the Shlrvan-Shahs, although under different suzerains. Admittedly, he could not yet claim to have a firm grip on it, since several sons of Farrukh-Yasar had escaped and there were to be Shlrvan-Shahs under Safavid suzerainty until 945/1538. In the spring of 906/1501 Isma'Il initiated from his winter camp at Mahmudabad measures to complete the subjugation of Shlrvan. Meanwhile news reached him that Alvand, the sultan of the Aq Quyunlu, like himself a grandson of Uzun Hasan, had been disquieted by Isma'Il's victory over the Shlrvan-Shah and was mobilising against him; but that because of the disorderly circumstances in which Alvand lived, the time was ripe for a preventive blow. Isma'Il therefore interrupted his enterprise in Shlrvan and for the time being also abandoned his plans for Georgia. Battle was joined at Sharur in the Araxes valley and as a result Alvand took flight. This victory at the beginning of 907/in July or August 1501, opened up for Isma'Il the way to Tabriz, the Turkmen capital. His reign over Iran is usually dated from the occupation of that city, although the dynasty of the Aq Quyunlu was not finally eliminated for some years, after the expulsion of Alvand, the victory over Murad at Hamadan on 24 Dhu'l-Hijja 908/20 June 1503 and the fall of Mardln still later. In the existing political and religious situation the appearance and early successes of Isma'Il must have had extraordinary results. I have already pointed to the way in which the activity of his father and grandfather stood him in good stead when he went among the Turkmen tribes. The departure of the first tribal groups doubtless hastened the decision of many others to follow suit, for as a result of the decline and final collapse of the power of the Aq Quyunlu they were faced with the necessity of finding new connections — upon which nomadic peoples at the time depended if only for the sake of self-preservation to replace their previous affiliation to the federation of the Aq Quyunlu. Indeed many of them were only too willing to join Isma'Il after he had given impressive proof of his enterprise and military skill in the battles at JabanI and Sharur. His unequivocal support for the Shl'a, which may have aroused hostility in some instances, for example among the urban population, would not have been a serious obstacle
212



for these people, who subscribed to Folk Islam and were not interested in theological arguments. A description of Isma'lPs political career reveals how significant a part the Tiirkmens played in the founding of the Safavid state. In this his kinship with the Aq Quyunlu is naturally a pertinent factor; but at least as important is the fact that his military strength was based on his rapidly growing retinue of Turkmen tribesmen. It was on their leaders that he drew when he had to fill military posts at court, posts in the civil administration and, as his conquest grew, in the provinces. A certain Shams al-Dln Zakariya KujujI, who had been vizier to the Aq Quyunlu, had earler presented himself at the winter camp at Mahmudabad and encouraged Isma'Il to undertake the successful campaign against Alvand by describing the confused situation at the court of his erstwhile masters. He then became Isma'U's first vizier. Thereby a firm link was forged with the Turkmen tradition of government and administration, whose institutions were undoubtedly taken over following the capture of the previous centre of government at Tabriz. What is true of the military posts in the earliest Safavid administration — namely, that they were filled by Turkmen notables — is by no means true of the civil posts, for example in the treasury, or of the extensive sphere of religious law ranging from the judiciary and the administration of the pious endowments to the charitable institutions. These posts were not occupied by Tiirkmens, any more than under the Aq Quyunlu or the Qara Quyunlu. As members of the military aristocracy they did not lay claim to them — nor would they have been suitable candidates for the vacancies. For some time past this type of administrative post had been staffed by the native Iranian bureaucracy, irrespective of which dynasty happened to be reigning. The Zakariya
KujujI mentioned above belonged to this civil servant class.1 To that extent Iranian personnel provided continuity between the Turkmen and the Safavid administrations. The adoption of Turkmen institutions or the dependence on existing traditions does not, on the other hand, exclude the introduction of major changes. It was an innovation that the two groups of Turkmen soldiers and Iranian civil servants — the "lords of the sword" (arbab-i saif) and the "lords of the pen" (arbab-i qa/am) - should be united even ethnically in the person of the Safavid ruler. In the Turkmen states discussed

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
earlier, the sultans had always been Turkmen: the Safavid Shah combined in himself the blood of both Turkmen and Iranian ancestors. It is irrelevant, therefore, whether the founder of the dynasty, Shaikh SafI, was descended from Iranian dibqans, from 'AH, or from Kurds, since Isma'H himself was connected equally with the military and the administrative aristocracy. The consequences of this remarkable dualism will be seen later. But the divergence from the pattern of Turkmen government did not stop there. Isma'il, who ascribed to himself divine qualities as the representative of the Twelve Imams, was also the head of a theocracy, which had not been the case with either the Aq Quyunlii or the Qara Quyunlu. He was therefore infallible and could command divine veneration. Moreover, the state which he founded perpetuated the Ardabll religious order. Isma'il was grand master (pir, mursbid, murshid-i kdmil) of the Safaviyya. His adherents were therefore called murid and sufi or ghdstf. Their external appearance was again characterised by the taj-i haidarl, the turban with twelve red gores which had been introduced by Haidar but which had grown less popular after his death. Thereby the name Qizilbash became common usage. As far as can be ascertained, the overwhelming majority of Isma'U's militant supporters belonged to Turkmen tribes. What was demanded of them was suftgari, "conduct becoming to a sufi", though this can scarcely have meant the same duties as those normally incumbent upon members of an Islamic mystical order. We must leave unanswered the question of how far under Isma'U's rule the Safavid sufls had to discharge the religious duties of prayer and worship belonging to the mystic path (tartqa), asceticism and a retiring life, vigils and fasts, litanies and the invoking of God. On the other hand, there is no doubt that, just as with the members of a dervish community, absolute obedience to the murshid was demanded of them. We know that the Qizilbash soldiers fulfilled this obligation; they even accepted the king's claim to be venerated as a divine being. Their battle cry is significant:
Qurban oldigbim piriim miirshidim!
("My spiritual leader and master,forwhom I sacrifice myself!")
Reports of their fanatical conduct in battle indicate that this cry truly conveyed their inner conviction, that they cared nothing for their own safety in war, either because they believed themselves to be invulner
214



able or because they positively longed for death as a direct access to paradise. The belief in Isma'il's invincibility, repeatedly confirmed over the years, also contributed to the process of turning his hordes into an efficient fighting force. At that time, when the morale of almost every army was extremely low, a strong moral impulse and several intangible factors must have been necessary to organise a military force adequate to the task of conquering a country as large as Persia. In order to understand further developments in the story, it is important to remember that the Turkmen tribesmen were grouped together in units or bands according to their tribe. Their tribal grouping also played a part in certain specialised units which were set up in
due course.1 It was of particular importance when it came to allocating provinces to the amirs. Each one would take all or some of his fellow tribesmen with him to his new place of residence, and employ them to help carry out his decrees: he was thus able to exercise an almost regal authority. The survival of tribal loyalties subsequently had serious repercussions for the Safavid state. Of the tribes which played a part in founding the empire, we have already mentioned the Ustajlu, the Shamlu, the Rumlu, the Takkalu and the Dulghadi'r. Also important are the Turkman, the Afshar and the Qajar. Besides these there were smaller tribes which had little or no influence on events; and there were other tribal groups which formed
subdivisions of or clans within the main tribes.2
Apart from regarding himself as god-king, Isma'H seems to have seen himself as the legitimate heir of his grandfather Uzun Hasan Aq Quyunlu. His desecration of the graves of the Aq Quyunlu rulers following his coronation does not necessarily contradict this. More pertinent are not only the fact that he preferred Tabriz as his capital to other cities such as Ardabll, but also his acceptance of the Turkmen administration described above, and the important contribution made by Turkmen tribes to his success. The same can be seen in his decision not to press further eastwards after the final expulsion of Alvand and the victory over Murad Aq Quyunlu which established his control over Hamadan with central and southern Iran; instead he turned his attention to the old heartlands of Uzun Hasan, Diyarbakr and the

earlier capital, Amid. Here in eastern Anatolia he even advanced as far as Mar'ash and Abulustan, the home of the Dulghadir tribe, only a section of which had hitherto been numbered among his adherents. Thereby he had reached the eastern frontier of the Ottoman empire. But he was clever enough not to provoke his powerful neighbour further. Although certain tensions had existed between them, peaceful relations still appeared possible at this point, particularly since Sultan Bayezld II was known to be a friend and protector of dervishes and sufis. Shortly before, he had granted an annual pension to a Qizilbash
leader in southern Anatolia named Hasan Khalifa,1 and he had hitherto set great store by the cultivation of the traditional friendly relations between his dynasty and the Ardabll order. After the conquest of Azarbaljan and eastern Anatolia Isma'Il turned his attention to Mesopotamia; its conquest began before 1507 with the capture of Mardln, the last bastion of the Aq Quyunlu, and was completed the following year with the capture of Baghdad. We do not propose to describe these campaigns in detail, but must discuss a little more closely a remarkable exploit which followed the conquest of Baghdad. This was a campaign to the southern Persian province of Khuzistan, directed against ultra-Shl'I sectarians who had lived there
since 840/1436 under the name of Musha'sha'2. According to the testi
mony of a Safavid chronicler3 they had at that time a leader named Sayyid Fayyaz and professed the heretical belief that 'All, the fourth Caliph, was God and that finally their leader Sayyid Fayyaz was also an incarnation of God. We are also told that at their prayer meetings they recited verses about 'A^li Ildhi and so on, thereby achieving invulnerability: if they then tried to thrust a sword into their bodies, it left no wound — on the contrary, the blade would bend like a bow. Certain aspects of the teaching of these sects, of which we have more detailed knowledge, bring to mind notions which we know to have occupied Isma'Il, above all the exaggerated adulation of 'All. There seems to be further proof here that such ideas were in the air at the time. Naturally, it is easy to see that such extreme viewpoints could scarcely coexist harmoniously, the less so when they were linked with rival political claims. It is not surprising that Isma'Il refused to tolerate in others religious demands similar to those which he voiced himself. The Khuzistan campaign ended the independence of the kingdom of

Haviza. Sayyid Fayyaz was killed in battle. Soon, however, his brother Sayyid Falah took his place. With him began a line of princes who were vassals of the Safavids except when they were prevented from fulfilling their allegiance by the Ottomans. Under their rule the border country of 'Arabistan around Haviza formed a kind of buffer state between the Ottomans and the Safavids and rendered the Safavids in particular valuable services. We must not forget either the way in which the rulers of Haviza mediated between the Persian and Arabic cultures. Before the Ottoman-Safavid conflict - which we have touched upon several times already - could be resolved, there was a clash with another enemy of the Safavids, the Uzbeks of eastern Iran, who had begun to rise to power in Transoxiana around 149 5. Their ruler, Muhammad ShaibanI Khan, was waiting for a chance to annex the territory of the Timurids together with their capital Herat. There, since the fall of Abu Sa'Id in 873/1469, power had been in the hands of Husain Balqara, who had turned his capital into a splendid centre of Islamic culture. When he died in 911/1506, two of his sons quarrelled over the succession, so that the following year Herat fell an easy prey to the Uzbek khan. Thereby the western part of Khurasan was also threatened. The information which Isma'Il received about these events, and certainly too the personal appeal of Bad!' al-Zaman, Husain Balqara's son and heir, who had sought asylum at Isma'H's court, led him to launch a campaign in the east. He defeated and slew the Uzbek ruler in battle at Marv at the beginning of the winter of 916/1510. Isma'Il captured Herat, appointed one of his amirs governor, and withdrew again. The fall of Muhammad ShaibanI Khan did not remove the Uzbek threat to the Safavids; on the contrary, it remained acute until the end of the ioth/i6th century. Two years after the battle of Marv there was another Uzbek attack which overwhelmed the Safavid troops in Khurasan. Reinforcements sent by Isma'Il under the leadership of the famous general Najm-i sanl proved no match for 'Ubaid-Allah Sultan, the new khan, even though they were supported by the Timurid Babur, who later founded the Mughal empire in India. After the catastrophic defeat of his forces at Ghujduvan on 3 Ramadan 918/12
November 15121, Isma'Il had to go to Khurasan in person the following spring, in order to save the situation. His arrival brought about the withdrawal of the Uzbeks without any battle being fought.

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
In a relatively short period Isma'H had won control over both the territory of the Aq Quyunlu and the rest of Persia, with the exception of a few small areas. Apart from the Uzbek khan Muhammad Shaibanl, he had not come across any truly dangerous opponent. Admittedly he had not been greeted everywhere by a jubilant populace. There were cities like Kashan and Qum with an old-established Shl'I population which clearly welcomed a Shi'I ruler. In several places, too, the propaganda which preceded his arrival and the reputation of his fascinating personality doubtless prepared the ground; similarly, the far-reaching intellectual climate of Folk Islam had favourable consequences for him. These circumstances doubtless facilitated for many their conversion to the new faith. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to think that in the course of the expansion of the Safavid state the population of Persia was converted overnight from the Sunna to the Shi'a. The propagation of the Shi'a was not accomplished uniformly or with unqualified success or without conflict. There are even grounds for supposing that decades after the commencement of Safavid rule, for instance, in Khurasan (where there was to be no lack of Sunnls at the time of the
Uzbek conquest in 997/15891), and probably in other parts of the realm too, adherents of the Sunna continued to practise their creed in secret. But in the course of these conquests there were also fervent Sunnls who refused to relinquish their religious principles and were not prepared even to make a pretence of being converted. In such cases - for example, in Baghdad or Herat - Isma'H reacted with brutal severity, ruthlessly executing theologians, scholars and even poets who
refused to accept the Shl'I faith.2 I have already alluded to the extensive spread of the Safavid order in Asia Minor. We also know that Isma'H prepared for his seizure of power by despatching envoys to mobilise his supporters in Anatolia. It has been suggested that the purpose of his march to Arzinjan may have been to shorten the march of the Qizilbash hastening to meet him from the west and thus to have them at his disposal at the earliest possible moment. It is true that many Anatolian Tiirkmens flocked to Isma'Il's standard when he embarked on his first exploits. In the first ten years of his rule this influx grew year by year. The reason lay above all in his military successes, but also in his reputation for generosity in the

218



distribution of booty, news of which spread rapidly throughout the Near East. Adventurousness and religious zeal played their part. Although the desire to join Isma'lFs army at an opportune moment before the final triumph of the Safavid movement may have been a contributory factor, it was not merely that kind of motive which drove so many Turkmen tribesmen into the Safavid camp. An additional reason was the persistent economic crisis among the population of Asia Minor at this time, following natural disasters, plagues and famines. When one realises that many of these Tiirkmens - in fact, all those who came from the province of Rum — were Ottoman subjects, one readily appreciates that this occurrence, a movement of population which the Ottoman authorities could not fail to notice, was viewed in Istanbul with suspicion and growing disquiet. It was seen as a confirmation of certain separatist tendencies which had been evinced in the province of Rum for some time. Even a ruler sympathetic towards the dervishes like Sultan Bayezld II could not look on indifferently: at least since the attempt on his life in 897/1492 by an Islamic wandering mystic, he knew what to expect of political fanatics who had donned the cowl. Although the would-be assassin had been a qalandar dervish, not a Qizilbash, the political aspirations of the Qizilbash had been clear enough to the Sublime Porte since the time of Junaid. Thus when Isma'II appeared in Arzinjan, the Ottoman government feared an attack on the province of Rum, which in the circumstances might only too easily result in the loss of this territory. It therefore made extensive military preparations, which were not abandoned until Isma'II had turned his attention to the regions further to the east. Although the expected attack had not materialised, there remained grave concern about the continuing flow of Anatolian mercenaries into Isma'U's armies. In order to stem this massive emigration of able-bodied subjects and put an end to the reinforcement of a potential enemy, the sultan ordered in 907-8/1502 the first persecution of Qizilbash in Anatolia. Every inhabitant who was known to have Safavid sympathies was branded on the face and deported to the west, usually to Modoni and Koroni in southern Greece. The amirs on the eastern frontier were ordered to prevent Qizilbash from crossing the border. However, these measures could have had little permanent effect in the conditions of the time, particularly in the case of a partly nomadic population whose religious and political loyalties were difficult to check. But the campaign was not a total failure either, as can be seen from Ottoman

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
chroniclers who record that Isma'Il sent the sultan a written (and unsuccessful) appeal asking him not to forbid his adherents to cross the frontier. Relations between the Ottomans and the Safavids worsened after Isma'Il's campaign of 913/1507 against the principality of the Dulghadi'r, which lay within the Ottoman sphere of influence; though whether he also advanced into Ottoman territory proper is not known,
since the sources contradict each other.1 In any case the Ottoman military were provoked into taking new defensive measures which in the event again proved unnecessary. The extent of the threat to the province of Rum, if not to the whole Ottoman empire, of Isma'Il's rise to power and of the movement he led, was not seen until several years later - and then not as the result of a military attack but through a grave internal crisis. When the sons of Sultan Bayezld II began to quarrel over the succession even while their father was still alive, Prince Sultan Qorqud secretly left his city of Antalya at the beginning of 1511 and headed for Manisa, a town closer to the capital, from where he could more easily observe the developments at court. His departure, which did not in fact pass unnoticed, gave rise to rumours of the death of the sultan, who had been in poor health for years. This totally unfounded news brought to a head the resentment which had been simmering among the Qizilbash, especially in the province of Teke-Ili, of which Antalya was the capital, ever since the persecutions mentioned above; the tension had been increased by their fear of deportation and their anger at not being allowed to cross into Persia. Led by a certain Qizilbash called Shah Qull, who hailed from that area but whose origins are otherwise not completely clear, hordes of rebellious Tiirkmens, composed almost entirely of Qizilbash, roamed the region, murdering and looting. The rebels belonged to the landless rural classes who had nothing to lose but who believed themselves to be assured of paradise if they were killed. The economic distress in Anatolia should not be ignored as a motivating factor in the uprising. This social aspect combined with Shl'I extremism is clearly discernible. Wherever the rebels appeared they spread fear and panic. Villages whose inhabitants refused to join them were razed to the ground, the people - even women and children - were massacred, and all the animals

slaughtered. Even mosques and Islamic monasteries were not spared their lust for destruction. Regular forces which intercepted them were defeated, whether under the command of the governor of Anatolia or of Prince Sultan Qorqud, who did battle with them on the plain of Alashehir. In the end Sultan Bayezld had to despatch his Grand Vizier Khadim 'All Pasha with a large army. The latter pursued Shah Qull and his bands, who had fled from him at Antalya, across wide stretches of Anatolia until finally on 2 July 1511 he caught up with them in the neighbourhood of Slvas. The battle ended in catastrophe for both sides: the Grand Vizier was mortally wounded, and Shah Qull was killed either during or soon after the engagement. Despite heavy losses his adherents managed to escape across the Persian frontier. At Ray they joined Isma'il, who was probably filled with suspicion by their misdeeds. At all events, the leaders were executed on his orders for committing robbery on Persian soil, and the others distributed among the fighting units, obviously because he feared the consequences of accepting such troops into his ranks as a separate and unified force. Although Shah Qull had begun as a supporter of the Safavids, in the later stages of the revolt he had been worshipped as God, Prophet and Mahdl and had thus relinquished his support for Isma'il. For this reason alone it is somewhat unlikely that the rebellion was instigated or assisted by the Safavids. Moreover, this is never suggested in the sources. A very different situation prevailed subsequently. The revolt was not quelled by the battle of Slvas and the death of Shah Qull. On the contrary, only after this did it break out properly in the province of Rum. Here there are clear links between the rebels and the Safavids. The proximity of the Persian frontier allowed them in an emergency to evade their pursuers by withdrawing on to Safavid territory, there to plan fresh exploits. The rebellious Qizilbash even obtained support from members of the Ottoman royal house. Prince Shehln Shah, one of Bayezld's sons and governor of Qaraman, tried to reach an agreement with them but died suddenly before achieving anything. When his brother Ahmed, whom the sultan had in fact chosen as his successor, saw his hopes of ascending the throne fade and rebelled as a result, his son Murad, who had been deputising for him in his capital Amasya, negotiated with the Qizilbash and allowed them to occupy Amasya in the middle of April 1512. The history of the revolt in Rum is characterised by atrocities just as terrible as those committed in western Anatolia by Shah Qull and his followers. Whether the conduct of the rebels met with Murad's
221



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
approval, we do not know. At all events he soon lost the initiative and had no alternative but to flee to Shah Isma'H. The revolt of the Anatolian Qizilbash contributed substantially to a turn of events which was highly unpropitious for the rebels: under pressure from his generals Sultan Bayezld abdicated in favour of his son Sellm, who ascended the throne on 7 Safar 918/24 April 1512. The new sultan was not only energetic and determined, but was also a bitter enemy of Shah Isma'Il. He understood the true magnitude of the threat to his empire from the Qizilbash, for as governor of Trebizond he had watched from relatively close range the rise of the young Isma'H, the orphaned son of a religious fanatic and political adventurer, to become the invincible God-King of Persia. He had seen too the fanatical valour of Isma'lPs warriors. He did not doubt that Ottoman rule, at least in the provinces of Asia Minor, was in jeopardy as long as the revolt of the Qizilbash in Anatolia was allowed to continue. The developments in Persia and their repercussions in the eastern territories of the Ottoman empire - for this is how the revolt must have appeared to Sellm - had already given him enough grounds for concern: now, about the time of his accession, further disquieting information reached him. The Persian intervention which Istanbul, erroneously, had expected earlier at the time of Isma'il's campaigns against Arzinjan in 905/1500 and Abulustan in 913/1507, had finally occurred. Not the shah in person, but his governor in Arzinjan, Nur 'All Khalifa Rumlu, had now invaded Ottoman territory on the orders of his master to assist the rebels in Rum. He sacked several Ottoman towns and finally, together with Prince Murad, whom he had intercepted on his march towards Persia, the city of Toqat. He inflicted a devastating defeat on an Ottoman general, Yular Qisd'i Sinan Pasha, who attacked him on his return march close to the frontier. As soon as Sellm I had prevailed over his brothers, he ordered a pitiless repression of the Anatolian Qizilbash. Anyone who was known or suspected to be a member of the movement was called to account. All ascertainable Qizilbash were registered; some were executed, others imprisoned. On this occasion too the victims were nomadic Turkmen tribesmen or peasant villagers; townspeople as a rule showed little tendency to support extremist movements. The reason for the persecution was the repeated revolts of the Qizilbash and their connection with the Safavids - not their Shi'I faith, even though this conflicted with the dominant SunnI creed of the Ottoman empire. There
222



were other ShI'I groups who remained unscathed as long as they refrained from treasonable activities. It is possible that Sellm saw in the rebellion of the Anatolian Qizilbash the culmination of certain separatist tendencies which had troubled the province of Rum for decades. At all events he did not draw the line at internal measures, but on 10 March 1514 set out for a campaign against Persia. Both his military advisers and his troops were loth to undertake this campaign, a factor which subsequently proved of some consequence. If we have hitherto examined the relations between the Safavids and their Turkmen adherents in Anatolia primarily from a religious point of view, it is because this is the prevailing interpretation. However, a
recently elaborated thesis,1 according to which social and political factors outweighed religious motives, also deserves attention. According to this argument the Turkmen tribes of Asia Minor turned to Persia because they neither would nor could be integrated into Ottoman society. For one thing their own strong racial consciousness stood in the way of any integration (though in the event the Safavids too failed to bring about such an integration). For another, their leaders would have had no chance of promotion in the Ottoman army of this period because a Turkish military aristocracy had already been formed - whereas in Persia Turkmen amirs had been offered a wide sphere of action not only in the conquest of territory but also in the political organisation and provincial administration of the empire. This argument is not implausible, although its validity remains to be tested on some points, especially the idea that tribal interests overshadowed all other ties, even the religious ones, and that these Turkmens were in fact quite indifferent to the religious issue, being still close to the shamanistic faith of their forebears. Such assertions are not adequately supported by the sources discovered to date, and for the time being we must assume that the rise of Isma'Il was inspired by strong religious motives which must have impinged on his Anatolian adherents. There, even if one attaches no great significance to the religious motives of his father and grandfather, the matter must rest, until the opposite is proved to be the case. Whatever the details of events in Anatolia, Sellm had of course good reason to view the development of the new Safavid state as a threat to

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
the Ottoman empire. With the far-reaching plans which he had doubtless already conceived and which shortly afterwards he put into effect with the conquest of Syria and Egypt in 922/1517, he could not accept the risk of being attacked on the flank or from the rear. But as he marched towards Persia in the spring and summer of 920/1514, he was dogged by the worry that he might not be able to engage the shah in battle. He could not be sure that Isma'Il would fight, in spite of the provocation contained in the letters exchanged by the two rulers, the texts of which have come down to us. Should Isma'Il seek to avoid doing battle, the march eastwards could not be continued indefinitely with troops who were already less than eager (there is a report of a mutiny among the janissaries). Spending the winter in eastern Anatolia was also out of the question, if only for climatic reasons. The whole difficulty of the operation was brought home when the Safavid governor of Diyarbakr retreated from his province as the enemy approached and implemented a scorched-earth policy against his pursuers. In the end this anxiety proved to be unfounded: Isma'Il did not avoid doing battle, although he must have known that the sultan commanded greatly superior forces. If certain sources can be relied upon, he deliberately relinquished certain advantages which would have accrued to him in his base in the mountains of Khuy in northwest Azarbaljan, and instead marched down into the plain of Chaldiran. Moreover, we are told that he refused to attack the enemy before their troops had time to recover from the exertions of their long march and could be deployed in battle order, the advice of two of his generals, Muhammad Khan Ustajlu and Nut 'All Khalifa, based upon their experience of fighting Ottoman troops. Although such information smacks slightly of the hindsight of participants, it is not impossible in view of the good fortune which had hitherto smiled on Isma'Il's military ventures that he really did act in this way out of a feeling of invincibility. In the battle of Chaldiran on 2 Rajab 920/23 August 1514 the shah suffered a shattering defeat. He himself managed to escape to his capital Tabriz with a small band of followers, but his army was beaten and many of his generals were killed. The magnitude of the disaster may be judged from the fact that the royal harem with two of Isma'Il's wives fell into the hands of the enemy. The reasons adduced for the Persian defeat include not only those already mentioned, especially the numerical superiority of the Turkish army, but also its possession of artillery
224



and firearms which the Persians lacked almost completely1 and which had a devastating effect on their cavalry, particularly on the plain. The brilliant solution of the logistical problem, the difficulties of which should not be underestimated, on such a long march mostly through loyal territory certainly contributed to the Turkish victory, although perhaps it did not play a decisive role. However thorough Isma'lPs defeat had been, the Turkish Sultan was in no position to exploit his victory properly. He pursued the shah and captured Tabriz, but a week later, on 13 September, he had to withdraw again westwards after failing, despite their impressive victory, to persuade his officers to winter in Tabriz, let alone advance on the Iranian highlands as would have been necessary if the pursuit of the shah was to be continued. Here we see a situation from which the Safavids were often to profit in their subsequent conflicts with the Ottomans; the extended lines of communication, the difficulties of transportation and the harsh climate of eastern Anatolia and Azarbaljan. Cleverly exploiting these circumstances, they avoided a decisive battle with the Ottomans after Chaldiran and caused their offensives to dissipate themselves, in the certain expectation that the approach of winter would force them to turn back. Shortly after Sellm's withdrawal Isma'Il returned unopposed to Tabriz. Yet he was unable to prevent the Turkish occupation and eventual annexation of the provinces of Arzinjan and Diyarbakr, losses which after 1517 were in fact never recovered.
For Shah Isma'Il Chaldiran did not mean merely the loss of a battle and of extensive tracts of land. In the eyes of his followers he had also lost the nimbus of invincibility, even if the defeat had done nothing to impair his reputation for sanctity. After all, the later Safavid monarchs were still considered sacred persons. However, his confidence must have been dealt a considerable blow. How else is one to explain the fact that thereafter in the ten years up to his death he never once summoned up the strength to take part in a military campaign, against either external or internal enemies? After Chaldiran there seems to have been little left of his old dynamism or of the boldness which he had still shown even on the battlefield of Chaldiran, although there was no lack of opportunity for military action, whether because of the revolt of

225



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
individual governors or because of attacks from outside, for example a new Uzbek invasion in 927/15 21 under 'Ubaid-Allah Khan. Tasks such as these he left to his officers. He himself appears to have lapsed into a persistent passivity, at least as far as the military defence of his throne and empire was concerned. Although he continued the customary transfer of the royal court and headquarters from one province to another, the alternation of summer and winter camps, he spent most of his time in hunting, competitive games and carousing. In the spring of 930/15 24, on a hunting trip to Georgia, the shah fell ill, but recovered in Ardabll on the way back and continued his journey. However, he developed a violent fever en route and succumbed to it in Tabriz in the month of Rajab/May. Before we proceed to discuss the later history of the Safavid empire, this is an appropriate point to assess Isma'Il's personality and historical significance. Contemporary Italian reports convey a vivid picture of the appearance of the first Safavid shah. This is supplemented by a
portrait which nowadays hangs in the Uffizi palace in Florence.1 The Italian informants, who saw Isma'Il with their own eyes, describe him as of prepossessing appearance, not too tall but of adequate stature, heavily built and broad-shouldered, with a fair complexion, cleanshaven except for a reddish moustache, and with apparently thinning
hair.2 Isma'Il is reputed to have been shrewd, to have had a lively mind and a quick intelligence. His personality as deduced from the sources does not lack positive features. The chronicles depict him as a just ruler who had the interests of his subjects at heart. His poems bespeak an unusual religious enthusiasm. Therein lies probably the key to his early political and military success: his ability to inspire others with his zeal - though the age was such that we may presuppose a certain susceptibility on their part. Courage and boldness together with physical strength and a masterly skill in the arts of war - he was said to be a superb archer - distinguished him in battle. But elsewhere too he did not lack courage, as is shown for instance by his decision to introduce officially the Shl'I faith in Tabriz, a city which had been hitherto two thirds Sunnl. These qualities characterise his conduct even at a very early age. We hear that while out hunting as a boy he fearlessly faced

THE EARLY SAFAVID EMPIRE
bears, leopards and lions. He was famedforhis boundless generosity, especially when it came to distributing booty: of course his behaviour may not have been influenced by altruism alone but also by the realisation that this was the quickest way to win recruits. However unstinting the shah may have been towards his adherents, he also showed merciless severity, for example towards arbitrary acts on the part of his governors. Opponents who refused to submit were pursued with unrelenting vengefulness and horrifying cruelty. We recall the faithful SunnI executed on his orders or the refined tortures which, according to the chronicles, he inflicted upon some delinquents. His hatred could outlast the death of his opponents; for instance, he had the skull of the Uzbek Muhammad ShaibanI Khan fashioned into a drinking vessel for his own use, and ordered the desecration of graves and corpses. One's revulsion at such horrors is scarcely mitigated by any allusion to the general barbarity of the age. A curious light is thrown on Isma'Il's character by his passivity and his hedonism during the last ten years of his life. The transformation from a remarkable military and political ambitiousness to a life limited to the confines of the court and devoted to drinking bouts, hunting and contests, appears to have puzzled even his contemporaries. At all events their naive attempt to present the shah as the victim of the wiles of worthless courtiers such as the Grand Vizier Mlrza Kamal al-Din Husain (murdered in 1523) or other Isfahan notables, suggests that this was the case.
CHARACTER OF THE EARLY SAFAVID EMPIRE
Two sections of the population of the Safavid empire stand out in particular, the Turks and the Iranians. They are distinct not only in language and customs, but also in origin and culture. Whereas the Turkish element is composed of Turkmen tribesmen, for the most part nomadic herdsmen and warriors, the Iranian consists of the oldestablished peasantry and the urban mercantile and artisan classes. In the figure of Isma'Il the Turkish and the Iranian groups fused. It was not immediately apparent whether Isma'Il would cast in his lot with one or the other of these two sections of the population, and if so which one he would choose. Although the sultan had not been able to exploit his victory to the full, the battle of Chaldiran had immense repercussions not only on
227



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
Shah Isma'lFs personal conduct but also on the history of Persia. With the resulting loss of the Safavid territory in eastern Anatolia the capital Tabriz found itself deprived of its more or less central location and placed on the frontiers of the empire; the geographical centre of gravity of the Safavid realm was thereby well-nigh compulsorily transferred to the Iranian highlands. Despite all Isma'lFs Iranian conquests as far as Khurasan, it was by no means clear in the first phase of his rule whether his realm, whose western frontier with the Ottoman empire was marked by the upper stretches of the Euphrates, would develop into an Iranian state with a Turkish glacis to the west, or into a Turkish state with an Iranian perimeter to the east. Both were possible, although certain circumstances such as the inclusion of some Turkmen traditions in the administration and the army appeared to indicate a preference for the Turkish option. The defeat at Chaldiran did not indeed supply a final answer to this question, for Isma'Il still clung to Tabriz as his capital and the seat of government was not moved to Qazvln for another generation; but without doubt it caused Safavid policy to be directed towards the east, especially since Isma'Il accepted the new situation without endeavouring to reverse it. It would be wrong to see in the distinction between Turks and Persians at this time something approaching a national bias, if only because nationalism in the modern sense came only much later from Europe to the Near East. On the other hand, the individual peoples were fully aware of the differences between themselves and others. In the Safavid empire discord and even violent antagonism deriving from the rivalry between Turks and Persians were not only common, they even exerted a strong influence on the internal development, at least in the ioth/i6th century and, moreover, as early as Shah Isma'Il's own reign. From the outset there were on the one hand Turkish soldiers who could claim credit for having laid the political foundations of the new state, and on the other hand members of the Iranian aristocracy who were proud of the part they had played in organising and administering the realm. For generations certain Iranian families had furnished civil servants for the chancellery and the highest positions in the administration. These families belonged to the native Iranian aristocracy. Irrespective of whether their rulers were Qara Quyunlu, Timurids or Aq Quyunlu, the senior civil servants were always drawn from this Iranian aristocracy. Sometimes it can be ascertained that members of one and the
228



THE EARLY SAFAVID EMPIRE
same family, and occasionally even the very same men, served several dynasties. Isma'Il too when he came to power had no alternative but to make use of the same class of experienced bureaucrats, just as earlier rulers had done, for there were no other qualified candidates to fill these posts, certainly none of Turkish or Turkmen origin. We may ask ourselves whether, as is maintained,1 Isma'Il was really the symbolic representative of the Iranian population through whom they made their last and most successful attempt to win political power. What is certain is that in his case the recourse to the native aristocracy had quite different consequences than under earlier rulers such as the Tiirkmens. Hitherto the influence of Iranian officials had always been strictly limited by the interests of members of the royal house and of the Turkmen military aristocracy, as instanced in the fate
of the reformer QazI Safi al-Dln 'Isa Savaji in 897/1492.2 With Isma'Il, however, we see the effect of his own link with the Iranian feudal class — to which, without prejudice to his Turkmen ancestry, he after all belonged — in that he was no less sympathetic towards the Iranian element than towards the Tiirkmens. To this must be added the overwhelming influence of the Turkmen tribes who had helped him to victory. The part played by their leaders especially in his early years must have positively compelled him to be on the look-out for a counterbalance; and almost inevitably this could only be found in the Iranian aristocracy. According to the traditional interpretation, there existed a sharp distinction in the Safavid empire before Shah 'Abbas I (995-1038/ 1587—1629) between military posts which were reserved for the Turkish tribal leaders, and civil and religious posts which were filled by members of the native aristocracy, that is by Persians, often called Tajik. More recent studies have revealed that such a summary account
does not adequately describe the position at the time.3 Even under Shah Isma'Il numerous significant departures from this schema can be ascertained. The bestowing of senior posts in the chancellery and of the highest authority over the pious endowments (the office of sadr-i a\am) on Iranian notables is quite in line with the dichotomy described above. But it is no longer consistent with this principle that a man like

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
QazI Muhammad KashI should have become simultaneously sadr and amir. The abandonment of the principle becomes even clearer with the appointment of a deputy {vakil) for the shah who had to combine in his own person the functions of commander-in-chief {amir al-umara') and grand vizier {va^tr-i a'%am). Even the first occupant of this office, Shaikh Najm al-Dln Mas'ud Rashtl, was an Iranian, and the recruitment policy which he pursued in this high post was unequivocally directed towards the favouring of Iranian notables and the reduction of Turkish influence. On his death in 15 09 another Persian, Yar Ahmad Khuzanl, better known as Najm-i sanl, was appointed as his successor, again with the double function, both military and civil. That he took the military section of his duties seriously is beyond all doubt, since in 918/1512 he led the royal armies against the Uzbeks and was killed in the battle of Ghujduvan. From 1509 to 1514 the appointment of commander-in-chief, or the more comprehensive office of vakil, was in Iranian, not Turkish, hands. The position is illustrated by the examples cited, and one could quote many more. They show clearly that even under Isma'Il I the highest military appointments and the military commands in the field were open to Iranian notables. It can be shown that under Isma'Il Iranian dignitaries used their influence to restrict the once well-nigh unlimited power of the Turkish amirs, something which would scarcely have been possible without the agreement or acquiescence of the ruler. We know too that Shah Isma'Il heaped tokens of his favour on the Iranian notables already mentioned and on their fellows, so that several of them acquired immense wealth. It does not require much imagination to picture the indignation and resentment of the Turkmen aristocracy when they witnessed such favouritism and particularly the serious encroachments on their privileges, real or imagined. Here lies the origin of the strained relations between Turkish and Iranian dignitaries which lasted throughout the ioth/i6th century and are even characteristic of this period of Safavid rule. They will recur frequently in the subsequent history of the dynasty. Isma'Il was undoubtedly aware of these effects of his Iranophile policies, at least to a certain extent. It is therefore plausible to suggest that he had some definite purpose in mind, if only the combatting of the influence of the Turkish military, to whom can be imputed the desire to make him an instrument of their own ambitions. Be that as it may, the geographically determined Iranicisation of the Safavid
230



THE EARLY SAFAVID EMPIRE
empire, referred to above, was now compounded with the strengthening of the Iranian element or, to be more precise, the ruling class of the native population. For all the similarity with the previous empire of the Aq Quyunlu, which had also fostered a certain Iranicisation through transferring the capital from Amid to Tabriz, through Uzun Hasan's defeat by the Ottomans in the battle of Bashkent in 878/1473 and through the appointment of Persian notables to posts in the government and the civil service, one observes under Isma'Il's regime signs of more or less deliberate measures. It cannot be proved that he consciously attempted to bring about an Iranicisation of the country; but one can certainly postulate that he was familiar with the problem, if only in vague terms. This conclusion is justified by a letter written to him by Sultan Bayezld II. For this letter urges Isma'Il to regard himself as an Iranian ruler and to confine his activities to the affairs of the inhabitants
of Iran.1 Admittedly the recipient of this advice bequeathed to posterity a collection of poems written in Turkish; but according to the testimony of his son Sam Mlrza he also wrote Persian poems. We may credit him with an insight into the differences in culture and civilisation between the Persians and the Turks, differences which were probably not insignificant. However strong Isma'Il's Turkish connections may have been, however important the contribution of the Qizilbash to his political success, the state which he founded could scarcely have been intended to be a Turkish empire. The Iranian aristocracy favoured by Shah Isma'Il's recruitment
policy were essentially large landowners.2 As everywhere else in the Near East, where latifundia and feudal-type institutions governed economic life, the territory annexed by Isma'Il contained broad sections of population who lived in reduced circumstances, many in abject penury. This suggests that the religious movement which carried Isma'Il to victory may have been inspired by social motives and aspirations, especially by a concern to remedy existing abuses. Before Isma'Il's appearance on the scene there had in fact been movements of this kind often enough in the Islamic world, for instance the communistic uprisings under Shaikh Badr al-Dln b. QazI Samavna and Baba Biirkluje

Mustafa in western Anatolia at the beginning of the $)th/i 5th century.1 If Isma'Il originally showed some understanding of the social prob
lem,2 he did not introduce any social reforms when he became shah. The favouritism shown towards Iranian notables indicates rather that he did not wish to tamper with existing social conditions. Of course, no reforms could be expected from the Iranian aristocrats themselves, and the less so the more powerful they grew. But such ideas were also foreign to the Turkmen leaders with whom they were at loggerheads: the Turkmens thought of nothing but the defence of their own privileges which could best be achieved by the preservation of the old feudal order, and certainly not by its curtailment or abolition. Although new men were appointed to posts of responsibility, nothing changed in the sphere of economic and social conditions. The burdens which Isma'H's subjects had to bear at this time are all too clearly revealed by the long lists of taxes and dues found in documents relating
to tax exemptions and immunities.3 The foundation of an empire whose frontiers corresponded approximately to those of present-day Persia, the political organisation of these lands, a certain internal consolidation, and protection from foreign enemies — such is Isma'Il's incontestable achievement. The propagation of the Shl'a as the state religion, however dubious the methods employed, can be seen in retrospect to have made a limited contribution towards the unification of the empire and its peoples. On the other hand it had little immediate effect upon the antagonism between the predominantly nomadic Turkmens and the Iranian town-dwellers. The new state did not display any particular national character. This notion occurs in the older literature, but it must be dismissed, if for no other reason than that nationalist ideas (in the modern sense) did not exist at that time. Shah Isma'Il I did not carry out any social or political reforms. The form of government which he adopted in his empire represents no advance upon that of preceding dynasties: it was an absolute monarchy, distinguished from other oriental political systems by its theocratic trappings.

TAHMASP I
TAHMASP I
Shah Tahmasp I (930-84/15 24-76),1 Isma'U's eldest son, was only ten years old when he ascended the throne. At that age, clearly, he could not exercise any great influence on the government and to begin with other elements gained the upper hand with the result that it rapidly became evident on what weak foundations the Safavid empire still rested. The internal situation was marked by immense difficulties, among them the lust for power and the unbridled tribalism of the Qizilbash, which was henceforth to remain the main problem of Safavid domestic politics for decades. Immediately after Tahmasp's accession, and again on successive occasions thereafter, disputes and intrigues among the Turkmen tribes crippled the military strength of the Safavids in the face of such powerful foes as the Ottomans in the west and the Uzbeks in the east. Historians usually pronounce a somewhat unfavourable verdict on the reign of the new shah, which lasted fifty-two years. However, if one considers the problems and perils which he had to face during this period — and which on the whole he overcame successfully - one cannot pass a purely negative judgment on his rule. The first decade of his reign, the period from 930/1524 to 940/1533, has the appearance of an interregnum during which power was wielded not by the shah himself but by Qizilbash amirs. In addition, it was in a sense a reaction against the last phase of Isma'U's rule. As will be recalled, the latter had lost much of his earlier self-confidence after his defeat at Chaldiran which deprived him of his aura of invincibility. Evidently in connection with this, there occurred a certain retreat from the theocratic system of government of the early years — and above all the attempt to circumscribe the power of the Turkmens by appointing Iranian dignitaries to the highest administrative and military posts. It is obvious that on Isma'U's death this policy terminated for the time being, that the Turkmen leaders immediately undid what had been achieved and saw to it as long as they were able that similar tendencies did not prevail under the new shah. Tahmasp's tutor (atabeg), Dlv Sultan of the Rumlu tribe, took over the direction of public affairs with the office of Great Amir (amir al-umara). His position did not go unchallenged, however, since the other Turkmen tribes and particu
1 Dickson, "Fall of the Safavl Dynasty", prefers the form Tahmasb.



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
larly the strongest among them, the Ustajlu, who dwelt in Khurasan and also in Tabriz, were loth to accept this arrangement. Nevertheless, Dlv Sultan managed to assert his authority to the point of being able to enter the capital. But he had to make concessions: together with Kopek Sultan, an influential amir of the Ustajlu tribe, and a leader of the Takkalu by the name of Chuha Sultan, he formed a triumvirate to rule the empire. In trying to oust his two co-regents, whom he regarded from the outset as his rivals, he came to grief or, rather, brought about conflicts in the course of which, from the spring of 932/1526 onwards, regular battles broke out between individual tribes. At first these were confined to north-west Persia, but later other parts of the country, above all Khurasan, were also dragged into the strife. The result was civil war and chaos throughout the land, and fresh activity on the part of the Uzbeks in the east. The Ustajlu suffered heavy losses in these battles and Kopek Sultan was killed. Thereupon Chuha Sultan Takkalu succeeded in winning the support of the shah and in poisoning his mind against Dlv Sultan Rumlu, so that in the summer of 933/1527, before the assembled court, the shah shot an arrow at his atabeg, thereby giving the signal for his removal. The dominance of the Rumlu tribe was now followed by that of the Takkalu, but only for three years. As early as 937/1530—1 there was a clash between the Takkalu and the Shamlu, whose leader Husain Khan, governor of Herat, went so far as to brawl with his opponents in the royal tent. Thereby Chuha Sultan met his death and Husain Khan took his place. Just like the Ustajlu and the Rumlu before them, the Takkalu were now ousted in favour of the Shamlu. But Husain Khan's days were also numbered: three years later he was overthrown and executed,, although he was related to the shah through his mother, a sister of Shah Isma'Il. This brief outline of the Qizilbash interregnum must suffice. It is enough to illustrate the steady development of the Turkmen tribes into a kind of Safavid praetorian guard, an evolution characteristic of the ioth/i6th century. It can readily be imagined how each of these coups brought with it an intrigue involving various individuals and the tribes to which they belonged or whose allies they were. The fall of a powerful amir signified each time a severe blow for the government and the whole realm, because the situation at court had its repercussions in the provinces: each victorious amir attempted to appoint fellow tribesmen or members of allied tribal groups to the most important positions
234



TAHMASP I
both at court and in the provinces, naturally at the expense of the defeated faction. This process produced innumerable enmities. The ousting of Husain Khan denoted a turning point in this development. The young shah knew now what to expect from the Turkmen amirs and did not hesitate to draw the appropriate conclusions. He rode roughshod over the allocation of offices already decided by the amirs, by entrusting the command of the Shamlu contingent not to one of the amirs of that tribe but to his brother Bahram Mirza and by once again nominating a Persian as the shah's viceroy (vakil). This was Qazi Jahan Qazvini, who had already held this post earlier. For the time being the enormous perils confronting both throne and empire as a result of the ambitions and cabals of the Qizilbash amirs had been checked, but they were by no means eliminated. From time to time they continued to loom up with varying degrees of ominousness. The latent threat remained the same as under Isma'Il. However, Tahmasp succeeded in asserting his authority for forty years from 940/15 3 3 onwards, until a new rebellion, similar in extent to that which troubled the beginning of his reign, again rocked the empire.
Scarcely less devastating were the effects of the strife among the Qizilbash on the external political situation of the Safavid empire. The Uzbek danger which we encountered in the reign of Shah Isma'Il for a long time plagued his son in turn. It crystallised into five separate assaults, the first of which took place in the year of Tahmasp's accession. It is unlikely that this initial attack was aimed at the conquest of Khurasan, though mounted as it was by a strong force it was more than a mere raid in search of booty and indeed culminated in a prolonged but unsuccessful siege of Herat. On the other hand, this intention, which we have already observed in the case of the Uzbeks, is so clearly discernible behind the subsequent invasions that a modern writer has appropriately described the Persian-Uzbek conflicts
between 930/1524 and 947/1540 as "the duel for Khurasan".1 It is not certain whether the decision to launch the first of the five Uzbek attacks was taken in the light of the events enacted at the Persian court after Tahmasp's accession, since the evidence of the sources is contradictory, some placing the outbreak of hostilities prior to Isma'Il's

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
death; but it is undoubtedly the case that these events influenced the course of the conflict. The governorship of Khurasan province together with that of the capital Herat was at that time in the hands of Tahmasp's younger brother Sam Mirza. In view of his youth, power was exercised on his behalf by his tutor, Durmish Khan Shamlu. Letters exchanged by the Uzbek prince 'Ubaid-Allah Khan, Muhammad Shaibanl's nephew, and the commandant of the fortress of Herat which he was investing, apparently during the winter of 932/1525—6, are still extant and convey a good impression of the situation. For in his summons to surrender, the Uzbek indicates that no assistance could be expected from the shah in view of the quarrelling among the Qizilbash amirs. And indeed Dlv Sultan Rumlu did not dare to weaken his army by despatching a force to relieve Herat. As it happened, there were no serious repercussions at this particular point because 'Ubaid-Allah Khan was not prepared to prolong the siege until the enemy had been ground down. Some time later he withdrew empty-handed. Shortly after that, however, he must have resolved to conquer Khurasan, indubitably influenced by the unending squabbles among the amirs of the shah, and perhaps too by news of the death of Durmish Khan. As early as 934/1528 he mounted a fresh attack, occupied Mashhad and Astarabad and appeared once again before the walls of Herat to begin a seven-month siege. This time a Persian relief force was organised and the shah accompanied it to Khurasan. He intervened personally in the battle of Jam (10 Muharram 935/24 September 1528) and won a victory principally by methods which his amirs had learnt from the Ottomans: for example, by the use of artillery, which was new to the Uzbeks. Unfortunately, the Safavid troops failed to exploit their victory, allowing the enemy to escape, and the following spring they marched westwards again in order to put down a revolt in Baghdad which had been instigated by Zu'1-Faqar Beg Mausillu. Because of its connections with the Ottomans this uprising had a more than local significance for the shah. He considered it to be more dangerous than the Uzbeks, who would predictably return in the event of his own withdrawal. Indeed, he did not have to wait long for news of 'Ubaid-Allah's third attack. After conquering Mashhad, 'UbaidAllah this time achieved the surrender of the fortress of Herat by Husain Khan Shamlu, the tutor of Sam Mirza, in return for a guarantee of safe conduct out of the city. The reasons for this were firstly that
236



TAHMASP I
Herat had not yet recovered from the previous siege; and secondly that the court made no effort to go to the aid of Khurasan, clearly because Chuha Sultan Takkalu had nothing to gain from assisting his enemy Husain Khan. On the face of it relief was perfectly possible, for the shah had been able to resolve the problem in Baghdad with unexpected rapidity. Zu'1-Faqar had been murdered and with the collapse of this revolt Baghdad had fallen to Tahmasp on 3 Shawwal 935/10 June 15 29. But instead of then returning to Khurasan, the shah set up a summer camp at Abhar, and on top of that spent the winter in Qazvln. Not until the following summer did he march towards Khurasan at the head of a strong army. At the news of his advance, 'Ubaid-Allah Khan's governors took flight. 'Ubaid-Allah himself likewise retreated from Herat, tried to raise reinforcements in Marv and, when that failed, marched on to Bukhara. The shah assigned Khurasan to Prince Bahram Mlrza and appointed GhazI Khan Takkalu as his tutor. In spite of the lateness of the season he left Khurasan again in mid-Rabl' I 937/at the beginning of November 15 30, perhaps because the size of his army would have caused grave supply problems had he decided to winter there. About this time the Persian court witnessed the fall of Chuha Sultan and the ousting of the Takkalu. The events connected with this were of such a spectacular nature that the Uzbeks must have learnt about them forthwith and conceived the idea of a fresh campaign against Khurasan. An attack by the Ottomans on north-west Persia, with which we will deal later, was another contributory factor. As in 935/1528 the shah again reacted nervously to the Ottoman initiative and marched to Azarbaljan, which not even a fresh Uzbek invasion in the spring of 938/1532 could induce him to leave. The reason for his different estimation of the foes on Persia's western and eastern flanks lay probably not only in the greater military potential of the Ottomans and the obvious success of their expansionist policies, but also in the geopolitical situation. The remote province of Khurasan is connected with the Safavid central provinces only by a small colonised strip between the southern face of the Alburz mountains and the northern edge of the desert; an enemy like the Uzbeks, who were essentially interested only in Khurasan, would scarcely venture beyond that strip in any largescale actions (though they occasionally raided further, as in 939/1533, when they reached Ray). In Azarbaljan, on the other hand, with its tracts of agricultural land, vital interests were at stake, including several access routes to the country's central provinces.
237



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
The fourth Uzbek assault on Khurasan thus coincided with the shah's stay in Tabriz. It led to the almost complete occupation of the province. Herat alone resisted the attack and a siege lasting a year and a half, which might still have achieved its aim had not 'Ubaid-Allah suddenly retreated in mid-Rabl' I 940/at the beginning of October 1533. His action may have been determined by internal events in his homeland of Transoxiana, but scarcely by news of Shah Tahmasp's advance, since the latter did not reach Khurasan for another two months. The fact that the Herat garrison was equal to the hardships of a protracted siege is astonishing, the more so since the local Qizilbash had hitherto been dominated by the Takkalu, who had long since been ousted from the shah's immediate circle. Nevertheless, the new constellation now had its impact on Herat. Sam MIrza was again appointed governor, as before with a tutor from the Shamlu tribe, called Aghzlvar Sultan. This time the shah wintered in Herat. In preparation for a campaign against the Uzbeks he sent troops to Marv and the territory of Gharchistan on the sources of the Murghab. In Dhu'l-Hijja 940/June 15 34 he himself departed for Balkh with the main force. There news reached him of an Ottoman raid on north-west Persia. He thereupon changed his plans and marched towards the west. Before we discuss the events of the ensuing war in the context of Ottoman—Persian friction, we would do well to consider the course and temporary termination of the struggle against the Uzbeks. But we can record at this point that the Ottoman attack created the most dangerous crisis of Shah Tahmasp's reign, because it was connected not only chronologically but also inherently with the machinations of the Qizilbash touched on earlier. That 'Ubaid-Allah Khan made the most of the opportunity afforded him by the shah's involvement in the west and by the crisis at the Persian court is scarcely surprising. But we must dismiss the notion that the Turkish sultan conceived of an alliance with the Uzbeks in order to trap the Safavids in a pincer movement, or that similar ideas existed in Bukhara. The latter supposition is refuted by the mere fact that 'Ubaid-Allah did not mount his attack until the Ottomans had already begun to retreat. It is quite another question whether 'Ubaid-Allah had some connection with the rebellion of the Qizilbash, in the course of which, as we saw, Husain Khan Shamlu was executed. The consequences of this uprising for Khurasan began with an official edict (hukm) from the Herat authorities, permitting the Turkmens to plunder the civilian
238



TAHMASP I
population. The revolt of Sam Mirza, his tutor and his amirs was revealed when without the shah's authorisation they undertook a campaign against Qandahar, which was part of the Mughal empire in India. The enmity existing between 'Ubaid-Allah Khan and the Mughals, together with the fact that 'Ubaid-Allah initially did not launch any offensive, but only minor thrusts against Herat, although the city had been left in a state of turmoil akin to civil war and entirely without any military protection — all this points to a secret understanding. It was undoubtedly known in Bukhara that the Turkish sultan had already officially recognised Sam Mirza as shah in place of his brother Tahmasp. When in 942/at the end of 15 3 5 'Ubaid-Allah Khan mounted his fifth offensive against Khurasan, a revolt of the population against the Qizilbash was under way in and around Herat in consequence of the ruthless plundering to which it had been subjected. The rebels were so strong and numerous that they were able to place Herat under a regular state of siege. They put themselves at the disposal of 'Ubaid-Allah, who was camped before Mashhad, and summoned him to Herat. Finally, treason on the part of Persian citizens delivered the town into the hands of the rebels and their Uzbek allies. With the conquest of Herat, 'Ubaid-Allah, who meanwhile had been elected supreme khan of the Uzbeks, might have seen himself at the summit of his ambition to enter upon the heritage of the Timurids in their famous capital, had not the collapse of discipline in his army become all too evident. When news reached him that the shah was approaching after a victory over the Ottoman sultan, his amirs refused to risk a battle with the Qizilbash and insisted instead on returning to Bukhara and abandoning their conquests in Khurasan. Thus it came about that Herat was evacuated in mid-Sha'ban 943/ at the end of January 1537 and was occupied without a struggle by the new governor whom the shah had sent on in advance. He was Tahmasp's eldest son, the future Shah Muhammad Khudabanda, accompanied by a tutor from the Takkalu tribe, Muhammad Khan Sharaf al-Din-ughll, who as governor of Baghdad during the rebellion of his tribe had remained faithful to the shah. Tahmasp remained in Khurasan for six months, waged a campaign against the Mughals, thereby conquering Qandahar (if only for a brief interval), and sent his troops into action against various Uzbek dominions. When in Rabl' II 944/September 1537 he began his return march towards Tabriz, the
239



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
Uzbek threat had been dispelled for a long time to come. Tahmasp's prestige, founded on his triumphs over the Ottomans, Uzbeks and Mughals, but above all over his own Qizilbash amirs, did not fail to have its effect. The shah was now twenty-three years old, and had acquired experience from the events of his childhood and adolescence which, in conjunction with his political and military aptitude, had turned him into a ruler of considerable stature. He had survived with flying colours the long probation period of internal and external crises since his accession. The very circumspection of his reaction to the Uzbek attacks leads one to postulate a sound judgment in complicated situations. He may have known that 'Ubaid-Allah Khan's aspirations in Khurasan, however serious, were limited by the lack of internal stability in Transoxiana. In fact 'Ubaid-Allah's ideas could not by any means have been identical with the plans of his generals. Whereas he envisaged an extension of Uzbek territory - namely the revival of the former Timurid glory - his followers had perfectly concrete, more modest ends in mind, that is, forays and expeditions to Khurasan and what seemed to them to be the untold wealth of its settlements.
Tahmasp was right: his most dangerous enemies were the Ottomans, not the Uzbeks. Naturally, he was not to know that his opponent Siileyman the Magnificent (926-74/1520-66) would go down in history as the most important sultan of the Ottoman empire. Whether the shah had adequate information right from the beginning of the conflict about the sultan's military strength and his dealings with the western powers, we do not know. The mere memory of his father's grave defeat at Chaldiran may have been sufficient to determine his estimate of the Ottoman threat. Although that battle had taken place as early as 920/1514, the year of Tahmasp's birth, eye-witness accounts which he heard as a child doubtless had their effect in later years. As an indication of the fact that the shah was none too well informed of the Ottomans' plans or at least exaggerated the potential danger, we might look at his reaction to the revolt of Zu'1-Faqar Sultan Mausillu Turkman. It will be recalled that it was this uprising which, after the victory at Jam in the autumn of 935/1528, caused Tahmasp to leave Khurasan again with the greatest speed. Since news of the rebellion had reached him even before the Khurasan campaign, the reason for his haste was probably that Zu'1-Faqar had recognised the authority of
240



TAHMASP I
the Ottomans. Now the sultan had just returned from the conquest of Hungary and was preoccupied with a campaign against Austria, the attack which led to the siege of Vienna (27 September - 15 October 15 29); he was thus scarcely in a position to pay much heed to the events in Baghdad, but this was clearly not so obvious from the point of view of the Persian court encamped in Jam. Only with the Austrian ceasefire of 14 January 1533 and the peace treaty which quickly followed did a really serious situation arise for Persia, resulting in the first of three Turco-Persian wars waged during Tahmasp's reign. Sultan Suleyman could scarcely have been under any illusion concerning the danger which a strong Safavid empire might represent for him and his ambitious plans in the west and north-west of his realm. Moreover the revolts of the Anatolian Qizilbash — especially
that of Shah Qull but also others that had followed1 - were still fresh in his mind. When the peace with Austria restored his freedom of action, he therefore proceeded to tackle this problem. As will be recalled, the Takkalu had been ousted from their position of dominance in Persia in 937/1531. The ensuing persecution and harassment of the members of this tribe provoked one of their leaders, Ulama Sultan, a governor of the shah in Azarbaljan who had earlier fled to Persia from Anatolia, to seek refuge at the Ottoman court. Describing the precarious position of the shah, exposed as he was to tribal strife at court and in the provinces and to Uzbek attacks on Khurasan, he drew attention to the favourable conditions for an Ottoman initiative. The sultan readily took up this suggestion, hoping in such circumstances to abolish a potential danger in his rear which might have grown acute at a time when he was engaged in campaigns in Europe. He sent Ulama Sultan, who had meanwhile been given the rank of pasha, to Hisn Kaifa as governor with the task of conquering Bitlls and supporting the Turkish offensive against Persia. In Muharram 941/July 1534 the Turkish Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha occupied Tabriz and two months later Suleyman himself arrived in the city. He marched via Hamadan on Baghdad, which surrendered to the Turks at the end of November without a struggle. The shah, who had broken off his campaign against the Uzbeks upon learning of the Ottoman invasion, and had hastened a distance of some 1,200 miles to meet it, found himself in desperate straits. In Khurasan there had been an

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
attempt to poison him. The Shamlu were in revolt, and more and more Qizilbash amirs were leaving him in the lurch. This was the last of the great tribal feuds before the shah succeeded in asserting his authority and in taking over the government of the realm himself. Suleyman exploited this situation by making contact with the rebellious prince Sam in Khurasan, whom he believed he could set on the Persian throne at the price of Azarbaljan. The Shamlu, and perhaps also the Takkalu, seem to have been behind this project. Contact between the Khurasan rebels and the sultan may have been established by GhazI Khan Takkalu, who had been tutor to Bahram Mirza during his governorship of Herat and now paid a brief visit to the Ottoman winter headquarters at Baghdad. Nevertheless, Tahmasp was able to reverse all of Suleyman's gains as soon as the latter retreated into Mesopotamia. This led the sultan to launch a fresh campaign against Persia in the following spring. The shah again refused to fight a pitched battle - indeed he was probably not in a position to do so. He confined his activity to attacking the Turkish rearguards and involving them in skirmishes. When the sultan began the return march to Istanbul at the end of 1535, his conquests were again completely lost, with the sole exception of Baghdad, which remained permanently Turkish, apart from a Persian interlude in the nth/17th century. Sultan Suleyman had failed to achieve his goal of freeing himself from the Persian threat to his rear. His failure was all the greater in that Tahmasp emerged strengthened from the grave crisis into which the Ottoman attack had plunged him. There is little doubt that the Turkish failure must once again be attributed to the rigours of the climate and to the extended lines of communication which presented the Ottoman armies with practically insoluble logistical problems. The Persian problem had been shelved, but not solved. In the next fifteen years Safavid troops established several strong points along the Turkish frontier, yet without noticeably straining rela
tions with the Ottomans. Not until Tahmasp's brother Alqas1 Mirza, who., had once played a prominent part in the struggle against the Uzbeks and had been made governor of Shlrvan, rebelled against the shah and was granted asylum at the Porte did relations once more grow perilously tense. On this occasion too a recent peace treaty with

TAHMASP I
Austria gave the sultan a free hand in any conflict with Persia. The encouragement of the Persian prince to this effect found a ready ear, especially since another refugee, a son of the last Shlrvan-Shah, was working along the same lines. In the spring of 955/1548 the sultan attacked Persia. Again a two-year campaign ensued, and again the Ottomans failed to win any decisive gains. Tabriz was captured, but only for a few days. With the sultan's permission, Alqas Mlrza launched a thrust towards Isfahan and other Persian towns, using not Turkish but irregular troops. Eventually, however, he fell into his brother's hands and was imprisoned in a fortress, where he soon met his death. While Siileyman withdrew to a winter camp at Aleppo, Tahmasp laid waste large areas of eastern Anatolia. Thereby he achieved his aim: although the Turks sent a force into Georgia, they would not risk an engagement with the shah and in the late autumn of 956/1549 they began their retreat. The repeated capture of his capital by the Turks must have demonstrated to the shah its exposed location. He therefore decided in
95 5/1548 to transfer his seat to Qazvln.1 It was to remain there for half a century until finally Isfahan became the capital. One may also see in this change a token of the increasing Iranicisation of the Safavid empire, for which the Turkmen tradition linked with Tabriz had now lost its erstwhile importance. That the second Persian campaign of Siileyman the Magnificent had likewise failed to fulfil its objective soon became apparent when shortly afterwards Tahmasp's second son Isma'Il Mlrza invaded eastern Anatolia, invested various towns in the neighbourhood of Van, captured Akhlat and later Arjlsh, and defeated Iskandar Pasha, governor of Erzerum, before the gates of his own city. When similar exploits were repeated, the sultan decided on another campaign which initially he intended to entrust to one of his generals, but which in the event he led himself. In Jumada II 961/May 1554 he left his winter camp in Aleppo for Amid and advanced as far as the Armenian territory of Qarabagh in the southern bend of the Araxes. But by the time he returned to Erzerum in Ramadan/August all that had been achieved was extensive pillaging and more or less insignificant skirmishes. Then a Persian envoy appeared and an armistice was negotiated. Clearly it

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
was in the interest of both sides to terminate hostilities. For after Tahmasp, whose pacific nature is often emphasised, had despatched another plenipotentiary the following spring, a peace treaty was concluded in the sultan's camp at Amasya on 8 Rajab 962/29 May 1555, the first official peace between the Safavids and the Ottomans. It was observed until after the deaths of both rulers - in fact, until 986/1578. Admittedly the Turkish attacks had deprived Tahmasp of Baghdad and Mesopotamia, together with the fortress of Van. But he had been able to prevent any further loss of territory, above all the loss of Azarbaljan. Confronted by a foe who was at the height of his power, whose exploits had been crowned with success far into Europe, the shah had acquitted himself not at all badly. Thereby one is of course overlooking the repercussions of three decades of war in the east and in the west, combined with the simultaneous internal strife amongst the Qizilbash tribes, for the Persian economy and the material circumstances of the population. Alongside the conflict with the Uzbeks and the Ottomans, Tahmasp's relations with the empire of the Indian Mughals, which had been founded shortly before the beginning of his reign by Zahlr al-Dln Muhammad Babur, the famous descendant of Tlmur, were of secondary importance. Though in 943/1537 the shah had occupied the Mughal city of Qandahar, he omitted to take any retaliatory measures when it was shortly afterwards recaptured from the governor he had appointed. Some years later, when Babur's successor Humayun sought refuge at his court, the shah placed at his disposal Persian troops, with whose help he retook the town. In fact, Qandahar did not revert into the shah's possession until the accession of the Emperor Akbar
(963-1014/1556-1605).1
The Safavid empire possessed numerous frontier areas like Qandahar. Some of them were ruled as vassal states by native governors, who occasionally bore the title of vali. The territories were often remote and differed from the rest of Persia in the language, culture and religion of their populations. Sometimes they formed a kind of buffer state between Persia and her powerful neighbours. In the course of time they

TAHMASP I
were integrated with the Persian state as provinces, thereby of course losing their special status. This tendency can be seen even in the reign of Tahmasp I: in fact, from 943/1536-7, with the appointment of a governor in Lahijan, where following the death of Isma'H's benefactor Karkiya Mirza 'All relations between the Safavid court and the ruler of east Gllan had rapidly deteriorated; the appointment was short-lived, though another was made for a few years towards the end of the shah's
reign.1 Shirvan lost its autonomy once and for all in 1538, Baku followed some years later and Shakkl in 15 51. Tahmasp also appointed a governor over part of Mazandaran, but the latter could only maintain his position from 1569 to 1576. The rulers of'Arabistan, the Musha'sha', had remained loyal to the Safavids since their subjugation by Isma'H I. To be sure, Badran b. Falah found himself in a cleft stick when the Ottomans began their operations against Mesopotamia, and had no choice but to go to greet Siileyman the Magnificent on his advance from Hamadan towards Baghdad in 941/1534. Yet his son and heir Sajjad once again acknowledged the shah as his lord when Tahmasp proceeded to Dizful in 948/1541. On this occasion Sajjad was confirmed as governor {hakim) of Havlza.
Naturally there were also territories conquered by Isma'Il I which were lost to his son; for example, Bitlls on the Turkish frontier, which has already been mentioned, and Slstan in the far south-east of Persia. Georgia — including the areas of Shirvan and Shakkl — held a particular attraction for the Safavids, as indeed it did for the Ottomans and had also done for previous Muslim dynasties such as the Turkmens. Tahmasp was following an established precedent, therefore, when he undertook no fewer than four Georgian campaigns, three of them in the period 947-61/i 540-54. Great as was the attraction of this land for the Safavids, the difficulties confronting them there were no less daunting, both on account of its geography and because of the military prowess of the Georgians. Tahmasp was not able to hold the capital Tiflis, although it had been captured several times by the Qizilbash, until he succeeded in establishing there as his governor the Bagratid David, a brother of King Simon I, who came to the Persian court, was converted to Islam and entered Tahmasp's service. This, however, did not by any means solve the Georgian problem. Nevertheless, the oper

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
ations of the Safavids in Georgia had a domestic significance which will be discussed below.
In order to elucidate the domestic repercussions of Safavid-Georgian relations, we must again recall the frequent revolts and mutinies of the Qizilbash amirs, the civil wars unleashed by them at the beginning of Shah Tahmasp's reign, their unbridled tribalism, individual cases of desertion to the Ottomans, and their attempt to depose Shah Tahmasp in favour of his brother Sam Mlrza — all alike basically the consequence of the failure of Tahmasp, and still more of Isma'il I, to assimilate the old Safavid order, the Qizilbash, within the state. As has already been mentioned, such incidents had led occasionally under Isma'il, and all the more under Tahmasp, to successive attempts either to oust the Qizilbash amirs or to reduce their predominance. This was possible only if they could be dislodged from the most important military and administrative posts in the empire. We have seen what courses of action the two rulers adopted in order to attain this goal. They probably realised that although they could obtain partial success by playing off rival tribes or individuals one against the other, no definitive success could be achieved in this way. Shah Isma'lPs practice of appointing Iranian dignitaries to the highest military posts indicates his awareness that a fundamental change could only be brought about by recruiting non-Turkmen elements. In these efforts not only Persians play a role, but even more so
Georgians1 and Circassians (in the then accepted sense of anyone living
north of Darband2), who as a rule were recruited into the army as bodyguards (qiirchis). The commander of the royal guard (qurchi-bashT) was already gaining more and more importance during the second half of Shah Tahmasp's reign, while the power and influence of the Great Amir (amir al-umara') diminished. This process, which extended over several decades and eventually resulted in the undermining or even neutralisation of the Turkmen military aristocracy, the Qizilbash, did not, of course, escape the attention of the victims, even though to begin with it was not perhaps as apparent as the preference given to representatives of the Persian aristocracy under Shah Isma'il I. They were of course reluctant to accept this turn of events, and so repeated disturbances and

TAHMASP I
rebellions ensued until Shah 'Abbas I succeeded in finally quelling the Qizilbash.
Yet before this point was reached, the Safavid empire had to survive another grave internal crisis, so grave indeed that its very existence was in danger. The trouble began at the end of Shah Tahmasp I's long reign, when in October 1575 the aged ruler fell ill. Among the members of the royal family and the court, especially the chief amirs of the Qizilbash, the question of the succession was inevitably debated. This matter was not governed by any set rules, any more than was the leadership of the Ardabll order, in which, although it had been customary for the leadership to be handed down from father to son, the eldest son had not always been chosen and the rule does not seem in any case
to have been followed invariably.1 Nor had the shah made any explicit disposition by nominating a crown prince. Although he had for some time past shown favour to Prince Sultan Haidar Mlrza by inviting him to participate in affairs of state, he had nevertheless refrained from endowing him with any specific office. Admittedly there were influential tribal leaders, among them amirs of the Ustajlu and powerful Georgians, who looked upon Haidar as the future shah. His elder brother Muhammad Khudabanda was not considered a serious contender because he suffered from a major eye complaint. Yet Prince Haidar was opposed by amirs of the Rumlu and Turkman tribes, for instance, who like Haidar's influential sister Parl Khan Khanum had a quite different candidate in mind, namely Prince Isma'Il. The reasons for this choice are not very clear, for the prince in question had lived for eighteen years under close arrest in the fortress of Qahqaha, in the Savalan mountains west of Ardabll. Presumably little more than tribal particularism lay behind it. Perhaps, too, one may adduce the fame that Isma'Il had won through his victories over the Turks and which had never entirely faded, that very esteem combined with the common touch and a certain arrogance which may have induced Shah Tahmasp to imprison Isma'Il after all his unpleasant experiences with his brothers Sam Mlrza and Alqas Mlrza. We cannot, however, dismiss the possibility that in spite of everything his father still considered Isma'Il an eventual successor, since the shah sent a

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
reliable bodyguard to protect him from any attempts on his life that might have been instigated by the fortress commandant. Initially it seemed as if the discussions at the court of Qazvln about the succession had been premature. Shah Tahmasp recovered from his illness and devoted his attention as before to affairs of state. But the tensions among his entourage remained in spite of the king's attempts to dispel them by making changes in the personnel surrounding him. The tensions still prevailed when he finally died six months later, as a result of poison, on 15 Safar 984/14 May 1576. Whether this was by accident or design has never been established.
Tahmasp's death triggered off a series of dramatic events. Before proceeding to deal with these, however, we must dwell at least briefly on an assessment of his character and his fifty-two-year reign. In general the verdict of historians has tended to be adverse. They criticise his miserliness, his greed and his cowardice. They are also offended by the bigotry which he demonstrated at an early age, apparently following
the failure of a poisoning attempt,1 and which not only affected his personal conduct and his immediate retinue but was also responsible for a series of narrow-minded ordinances imposed on the population as a whole. The notion that he refused to conclude any treaties with the Christian powers of Western Europe on religious grounds can no
longer be sustained.2 But his bigotry is discernible in his stubborn attempts to convert the Great Mughal Humayun to the Shl'I faith when the latter sought asylum at his court in 1541. A particularly repugnant act of treachery may be seen in his treatment of the Ottoman Prince Bayezld, who sought refuge in Persia in 1559 after rebelling against his father. The shah could have been in no doubt as to the impending fate of the prince and his four sons when he handed them over to an Ottoman delegation after negotiations lasting two years. Even if political considerations were involved — Siileyman had threatened military reprisals, in other words, the termination of the Peace of Amasya - it is to Tahmasp's discredit that he accepted payment for his
collaboration in gold coin and territorial concessions.3 Such misdeeds, errors and weaknesses throw a murky light on

TAHMASP I
Tahmasp as a person and as a ruler. Yet a just appraisal of the shah cannot be reached on the basis of this evidence alone: we must also consider other factors together with his political achievements and behaviour. We should not forget that the first decade of Tahmasp's life - the whole period prior to his accession - coincided with that phase in the career of his father Isma'Il I during which the latter, clearly disillusioned and discouraged by his defeat at Chaldiran, could not bring himself to take any notable political or military initiative and therefore failed to inspire his son with any noble aspirations. On the other hand, we should not underestimate Tahmasp's achievement in personally taking over the reins of power within a space often years, after the land had been at the mercy of plotting tribal chieftains. If in the first decade of his reign he was a puppet in the hands of Turkmen amirs, he certainly cannot be accused of weakness during the next forty years. What is remarkable is not only the skill with which he freed himself from the tutelage of the Qizilbash leaders but also the courage with which he faced the Uzbeks, particularly in the battle of Jam, and then in 941/15 34, even before the Uzbek danger had been averted, took the correct decision to withdraw from the fighting in the east and march to meet the greater threat posed by the Ottoman invasion. He adhered steadfastly to this policy despite the Ottoman.successes and despite the conspiracy of his brother Sam and the defection of most of his Turkmen generals. Only in this way did he succeed eventually in asserting his authority, quelling several revolts on the part of the Qizilbash (nowadays we would describe them as civil wars), retaining Khurasan with Herat and Mashhad in defiance of five Uzbek attacks and even emerging relatively unscathed from three wars against the Ottomans. Persia was able to absorb the loss of Baghdad, and the surrender of eastern Anatolia gave an impetus to the Iranicisation (at least in a geographical sense) of the Safavid empire, for which both its Turkmen forebear Uzun Hasan and the latter's son and heir Ya'qiib had, so to speak, established certain preconditions. Another instance of this development was manifest from 955/1548 onwards, when the Safavid capital was transferred from Tabriz, now standing on the boundaries of the empire, to Qazvln. Although Tahmasp and his advisers probably had no conscious thought other than to avoid the ever-present threat to the capital from the Ottomans, the idea of a Turkmen state with its centre at Tabriz and its fulcrum in eastern Anatolia, Mesopotamia and north-west Persia was thereby abandoned in favour of an
249



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
empire centred on the Iranian highlands. At this time, therefore, arose roughly the same geopolitical situation that still prevails today. There is no reason to seek here the beginnings of a deliberate policy of Iranicisation. Yet the implications of the development are clear. At most one can speak of an involuntary Iranicisation that shows even fewer signs of being a conscious intention than the previously mentioned recruitment of non-Turkmen notables for the civil and military administration. The shah's character also appears in a rather more favourable light when we learn that in spite of his cupidity piety led him to forgo highly lucrative taxes on the grounds that they offended against religious law;
thereby rejecting an income of some 30,000 tumdns.x The extant record of the speech he made on 19 July 1562 to the envoys of the Turkish sultan who had come to negotiate the extradition of Prince Bayezld
betokens his political skill,2 while his highly cultured mind, his scholarliness and his patronage of the arts ensure him a measure of sympathy. After all, under his aegis the art of book illumination attained between
15 30 and 1545 a zenith of development that has never been surpassed.3 Thus, if one carefully weighs up the positive and negative features that were combined in Tahmasp's character, favourable qualities are by no means lacking. It must be counted a particular achievement that by the time of his death he had managed to preserve the essential fabric of his father's empire in the face of grave internal and external dangers.
That same day the explosive nature of the domestic political situation in the Safavid empire became evident. It was revealed less by the immediately erupting dispute over the succession than by the peculiar character of the antagonisms that now came to the fore. It was not only a matter of a conflict between rival interests which grouped themselves around the two contenders, but also (and to a far greater extent) of a struggle between Turkmen and non-Turkmen. Admittedly, the picture does not appear so clear-cut at first sight. On the one hand we find

Prince Haidar supported partly by the Turkmen Ustajlu tribe but mainly by the Georgian leaders at court; on the other hand the party of Prince Isma'Il, who was still imprisoned at Qahqaha — a group led by Princess Par! Khan Khanum and supported partly by her Circassian uncle Shamkhal Sultan but in the main by all the Turkmen tribes other than the Ustajlu. Prince Haidar considered himself not without good reason as the heir appointed by Tahmasp, but did not even get a chance to take power: he fell into the hands of his opponents and was immediately murdered. Thereafter the way was open for his brother to ascend the throne as Isma'Il II. The eighteen months of his rule constituted a reign of terror unusual even by oriental standards. That the party which had suffered a defeat over the succession should have been exposed to the revenge of the victors is not surprising. What is remarkable is the merciless cruelty with which the new shah exterminated his brothers. Only one of them, the almost blind Muhammad Khudabanda, eluded his assassin — and that only because Isma'Il died before the order could be carried out. This brutality is explained by the hypothesis that Isma'Il, whose health had been ravaged by the constant use of drugs during his long captivity, was on the verge of insanity when he succeeded to the throne and from then on acted purely out of paranoia. This theory may well be correct; but it is equally possible that he was deliberately imitating the example of the Ottoman court, where at this time, after several unfortunate experiences, the "superfluous" princes were systematically eliminated to ensure that the accession of the
crown prince would not be threatened.1 It can be assumed that Isma'Il, remembering his earlier battles with the Turks, continued to show an interest in developments in the Ottoman empire even during his captivity. We even know that he could draw on certain sources of information at Qahqaha. Why should he therefore not have come to the same conclusions as had been drawn in Istanbul? Perhaps the distrust and fear that he showed reflected his own attitude towards his father; they were certainly dictated by his father's bitter experience with his brothers Alqas and Sam. There is no evidence that the murdered princes had given the new shah any concrete grounds for suspicion, with the exception of one of his cousins, Sultan Husain MIrza, who set

up an independent principality in the remote region of Qandahar and who perished early in 15 77 without Isma'il's contrivance. If one looks for positive features to alleviate the sinister picture of Isma'il's personality during his brief reign, there is very little to fall back on. One could probably point to the success with which he re-established law and order in the land. In the last eight years of Tahmasp's reign, we are told, conditions in Persia had grown very insecure. It is alleged that thousands of Persians were killed by bandits or as a result of the raids of Turkmen soldiery. Isma'Il apparently succeeded in re-establishing law and order with relentless severity. One can also point to the glimmerings of Isma'il's military glory that may have preserved the country from attacks by foreign enemies, although news of events inside Persia, of the murder of the princes and especially of the strife between various Qizilbash tribes, which took a particularly violent turn in Khurasan, might have been expected to arouse their interest and ever-present greed for plunder. Even though Isma'Il II had to proceed cautiously in his relations with the Ottomans, one of the most extraordinary measures that he attempted to carry out shortly after assuming power, namely the re-introduction of the SunnI faith, can scarcely be explained in terms of his respect for their religious susceptibilities (although such a notion was current in the
capital)1 - not even in the light of the Ottoman demand in the Peace of Amasya of 962/15 5 5 that the execration of the Caliphs Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman that dated back to Shah Isma'Il I should cease in Persia. What Isma'il's real motives for such a step may have been remains a mystery, at least in the present stage of knowledge. Naturally one can adduce his hatred for his merciless father and the corresponding endeavour always to do the very opposite of what Tahmasp had deemedfit;in this case, therefore, to abandon the typical Safavid credo which Tahmasp had maintained with such exaggerated piety. One could combine with this explanation the argument that a reaction against the previous Shl'I fanaticism was inevitable. It is possible, however, that the step was dictated by a sober political consideration: Isma'il's concern about the excessively powerful position of Shl'I dignitaries, which would have been undermined by a reintroduction of the Sunna. Before the full repercussions of Isma'il's completely disastrous and aimless policies could be felt, he met his death on 13 Ramadan 985/24

November 15 77 in an unexpected and mysterious fashion. Some accounts claim that he died of an overdose of drugs, others that he was poisoned by his ambitious sister Parl Khan Khanum, who had been instrumental in ensuring his succession but who had earned only ingratitude for her pains. Others again relate that he was murdered by Qizilbash amirs who refused to tolerate his political measures, particularly the religious changes.
MUHAMMAD KHUDABANDA
Some of Isma'Il's relatives had escaped the systematic elimination of the royal princes. These included his eldest brother Muhammad Khudabanda and four of his sons, the eldest, Sultan Hasan Mlrza, having been murdered in Tehran shortly before on Isma'Il's orders. In the council of the Qizilbash amirs at court who met to discuss the succession various suggestions were made. Shah Shuja', Isma'Il's infant son, who was only a few weeks old; his eleven-year-old nephew, Sultan Hamza Mlrza; and the latter's father, Crown Prince Muhammad Khudabanda, who had been passed over at the time of Tahmasp's death, were all mooted as successors. In each case Princess Parl Khan Khanum, who was at this time about thirty years old, hoped to be able to take over the regency — even when the choice finally fell on Muhammad Khudabanda, for owing to an ophthalmic disease he was almost blind. When he moved from Shlraz, where he had escaped the fate of his brothers, to Qazvin and ascended the throne on 3 Dhu'l-Hijja 985/11 February 15 78, the land was delivered from a harrowing tyranny, but the ten years of his reign brought little joy to his people. What at first made him appear a mild ruler was the sheer contrast with Isma'Il's cruelty. If one looks closer, his gentleness is seen to be really weakness, indifference and incompetence. Although his eye trouble was not conducive to an effective reign, it cannot explain completely his total lack of involvement in affairs of state. In these circumstances power soon passed into other hands. The shah lived so much in the background that some foreign observers evidently never became aware of his existence; this is the reason for Sultan Hamza Mlrza being described more than once as a reigning monarch in the list of Safavid rulers — a
position which in reality he never held.1

255



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
The principal feature of the new shah's whole reign was the quarrelling and intrigues of the Qizilbash amirs that had gone on for decades and were only quelled when a particular ruler was able to counter them either by force or by cunning. Since Muhammad Khudabanda could do neither, their unruliness and jockeying for position reached a climax during his reign, until his son 'Abbas succeeded in suppressing them. When news of Isma'Il's death was received, bloody conflicts immediately broke out among the Qizilbash, with the Shamlu and Ustajlu on the one side and the Turkman and Takkalu on the other. Although the Grand Vizier, Mirza Salman Jabirl, a member of an aristocratic family
from Isfahan which had served the Safavids from an early date,1 managed to reconcile the warring parties for a time, these quarrels sometimes amounting to serious rebellion and even civil war - were to remain the dominant factor in Persian politics for the next ten years. The mention of the grand vizier indicates that not only various factions among the Turkmen tribes, but also non-Tiirkmens such as members of the Iranian aristocracy took part in these clashes. This particular combination, which had already existed before even as early as the reign of Shah Isma'Il I, foreshadowed future developments. Admittedly it would be wrong to speak of a confrontation between Turkmen and non-Turkmen, or even between Turkmen and Iranian. On the contrary, one finds elements of both groups on either side at any given moment. On the death of Isma'Il II the reins of power, as we have seen, were gathered together in the hands of Princess Parl Khan Khanum. She was supported by her Circassian uncle, Shamkhal Sultan, the lord of the seal. As at the time of her father's death, the princess could muster considerable support among the Qizilbash and with their help was able to assert her claims. Thus it came about that the Grand Vizier Mirza Salman, who had been appointed by the late shah in Rabi' I 98 5 /June 1577 and did not find favour with the princess, soon left the capital ostensibly to pay his respects to the new shah but in fact prompted by a well founded fear for his own safety. Here we see an alliance of interests that is worth noting. In the retinue of the new shah it was evidently known what was to be expected of his reign. The way that he had exercised previous functions, most recently in Shlraz, permitted the drawing of fairly reliable conclusions: neither his eye ailment nor

MUHAMMAD KHUDABANDA
the indifference towards public affairs that he had shown previously was likely to change. The role of the royal spouse Khair al-Nisa Begum, known as Mahd-i 'Ulya, would therefore be all the more important. She was an ambitious woman, born into the MazandaranI nobility, and her enterprise and lust for power now found undreamedof opportunities, after she had gone for months in constant fear of her life. When the grand vizier arrived in Shlraz she must have welcomed him not only as a man fully conversant with the latest events in the capital, but also as a potential ally ideally suited to her purpose. He was familiar with the details of the administrative machinery and at the same time enjoyed no particular following among the Qizilbash, since he belonged to a famous Iranian family. Thus he was not likely to find any better opportunity than an alliance with the queen of such a weak ruler as the new shah. All the same, he could not have been unaware of certain dangers inherent in this community of interests. To begin with, Mlrza Salman's calculations were apparently proved correct. He retained his high office even under the new ruler and saw his enemy Princess Parl Khan Khanum brought low when, along with her uncle Shamkhal Sultan, she lost all influence shortly after the arrival of the court in Qazvln and was murdered. Yet the grand vizier could scarcely have foreseen the extent to which the queen herself appropriated power, any more than had the Turkmen amirs, who had presumably voted for Muhammad Khudabanda not least because of his weakness and inadequacy. She was by no means content to exercise a more or less indirect influence on affairs of state: instead, she openly carried out all essential functions herself, including the appointment of the chief officers of the realm. In place of the usual royal audience, these high dignitaries had to assemble each morning at the entrance to the women's apartments in order to receive the Begum's orders. On these occasions the royal edicts were drawn up and sealed. Political affairs continued to be dealt with in such a manner for well over a year. By that time the amirs were so infuriated by the regiment of women that they conspired against the queen, and openly demanded that the shah should remove her. They achieved their aim: the Begum was strangled in the harem on i Jumada I 987/26 July 1579, on the pretext - whether justified or not, it is uncertain - of having entered into a love-affair with 'Adil Girai, a brother of the khan of the Crimea. The queen's murder was tantamount to the usurpation of power by the influential leaders of the Qizilbash. First there occurred a violent
255



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
explosion of hatred against the Iranian aristocracy, particularly because of their entrenched positions of power in the central government and other branches of the administration. During the ensuing persecution of Iranians, especially the Mazandarani supporters of the murdered consort, only those under the protection of powerful Turkmen amirs survived unscathed and unmolested. One such man was the Grand Vizier MIrza Salman Jabirl, who had joined the conspirators at an opportune moment even though he did not agree with them on every point. The difficulties that he had to face during the persecution of the Iranians may well have deceived the shah into overlooking his previous conduct. At all events the shah allowed him to remain in his high office. The conspirators found it easy enough to persuade the shah to continue on the throne and to satisfy him with renewed protestations of their fealty. Naturally they emerged scot-free; for who could have called them to account? However, it is interesting that Muhammad Khudabanda's address to the amirs and the reproaches that he levelled at them contained clear allusions to the old relationship between the shah as sufl master and the amirs as his disciples (sufigart, 'aqida-yi bdtint). From this we may conclude that in theory the original basis of the Safavid empire was still adhered to, even though the religious bond with the shah had long since been dissolved, probably as early as the second half of the reign of Shah Isma'Il I. On this occasion Prince Hamza was proclaimed crown prince. Since he was only eleven years old the Qizilbash had nothing to fear from him for the moment. However, in time, as we have seen, he stepped into the limelight. He had a strong ally in the Grand Vizier Mlrza Salman Jabirl, who soon achieved a position of prominence once more. Naturally, the increasing influence of the prince and the vizier earned them the suspicion and ultimately the enmity of the Qizilbash amirs. It is therefore not surprising that they both met a violent end.
In fact, they were not killed until 991/1583 and 994/1586 respectively. Before that the disputes and fighting among the Turkmen tribes grew so acute that the internal crisis of the Safavid empire, which had been simmering ever since Shah Tahmasp's death, began to have wider repercussions: both in the east and in the west Persia's neighbours launched attacks on her. In the context of the present study a mere outline of the main events and their background will suffice.
256



MUHAMMAD KHUDABANDA
An attack by Uzbek bands in the spring of 986/1578 was repulsed by Murtaza Qull Sultan, the governor of Mashhad. This was perhaps a legacy of the Uzbek wars waged by Tahmasp I, rather than a prelude to later Uzbek onslaughts of a greater magnitude. In the west the position was more serious. Whether one chooses to see the Turkish defeat at the hands of Don Juan of Austria at the battle of Lepanto in 15 71 as a turning point in the history of Turkish power, or merely as one of many signs of incipient decline - perhaps even as an attempt to seek
compensation in the east for reverses suffered in the west1 — the Ottomans still remained by far the greatest threat to the Safavids. Relations between the Ottomans and their western and north-western neighbours were just as important a factor in determining the fluctuating extent of the danger as the strength or weakness of particular Safavid rulers. The confusion surrounding the accession of Shah Muhammad Khudabanda created ideal conditions for Sultan Murad HI (982-1003/1574-95) to mount military expeditions in the eastern part of his empire, because the Habsburg Rudolf II had shortly before paid him tribute and he could reasonably assume that he had nothing to fear from that quarter. The Grand Vizier Mehmed Soqollu, who was inclined to accept the Persian offer to abide by the Peace of Amasya, was unable to dissuade his monarch; the Sultan was bent on war. A series of uprisings in the Persian frontier areas among the Kurds and in Shlrvan, quarrels among the Georgian princes — some of whom inclined towards the Turks, others more to the Persians — favoured the Turkish plans. These tribesmen may well have had a presentiment of a new Ottoman-Safavid confrontation: indeed in some cases it was known that neighbouring Turkish governors were stirring up trouble
on instructions from above.2 The Turko-Persian war (986-98/1578-90) was launched by the Porte with the dispatch of the third vizier Mustafa Pasha, known as Lala Pasha. He gained victories in Georgia, and also defeated Persian troops on Lake Childir (some 30 miles north of Kars) and invaded Shlrvan, but the decisive breakthrough into Persia eluded him. Although the khan of the Crimea also sent an expeditionary force into Shlrvan, there were no lasting gains to begin with, since the Safavids despite great losses — harassed the initially victorious invaders, often

forcing them to withdraw. However, other Ottoman generals operated more successfully, with the result that ultimately Persia suffered considerable territorial losses not only in Transcaucasia but also in Kurdistan and Luristan and in 993/1585 she even lost Tabriz. Nothing could be wider of the mark than to suppose that such military disasters would have helped to terminate the fateful strife between the different factions among the Qizilbash tribes, or at least to keep it within tolerable bounds. As before, dissenting tribal interests remained the guiding principle of the amirs' actions. They were blind to the interests of the empire as a whole, in the foundation of which their forefathers had played such a large part and whose very existence was now at stake. Their attitude naturally had repercussions on the military developments and aggravated the situation to a marked extent. Particularly dangerous was a rebellion in Khurasan that led in 989/1581 to this province temporarily seceding from the central government in Qazvln. In order to understand this event we must recall that within the Safavid administrative framework certain Qizilbash amirs, together with their tribes or individual groups of tribal followers, represented the central government in various provinces as viceroy (hakim, vail) and wielded political authority on its behalf. Certain provinces were placed in the charge of royal princes who entrusted the duties of their office to the Turkmen amirs attached to them as guardians or tutors. Thus we encountered Muhammad Khudabanda, before his accession, as governor of Shlraz. This post was bestowed on him eighteen months after the birth of his son 'Abbas on 1 Ramadan 978/27 January 15 71, while Herat, which he had governed hitherto, was allotted to the new-born prince. Khurasan, which included parts of present-day Afghanistan, had two centres at this time, Mashhad and Herat. The importance of this land and the value placed upon it by the Safavids will be remembered from the earlier account of Shah Tahmasp's Uzbek wars. It should be noted that Khurasan produced centrifugal tendencies more than once in the course of Persian history owing to its remoteness from the central areas of Iran and to the narrow corridor that was its sole link with them between the Alburz mountains and the Kavlr desert. This separatism now manifested itself once again, as during the bloody strife between the Turkmen tribes the victory of any particular group was immediately countered by reprisals against the kinsfolk of the victors in another area. This escalation reached its peak when an alliance

MUHAMMAD KHUDABANDA
composed mainly of Turkman and Takkalu triumphed over the more closely linked Shamlu and Ustajlu at the royal court. The man who had become tutor to Prince 'Abbas was one 'All Quli Khan Shamlu, who had originally been made governor of Herat by Shah Isma'Il II and sent there with orders to eliminate the prince. However, he had not found the opportunity to carry out this commission when he learnt the news of the shah's death, and this enabled him to take up office without fulfilling his instructions. Thereafter, before the demands of Queen Mahd-i 'Ulya that the prince be sent to the court could be met, she too perished. Thus in the dispute with the court, where his enemies were now all-powerful, and in the struggle with their representative in Mashhad, Murtaza Quli Khan, the governor still possessed an important pawn. He defeated his rival and retained the upper hand even when the latter was reinforced by troops sent from the capital. Then fresh reprisals were taken at court against his fellow tribesmen and in consultation with confederate amirs he resolved to have the prince proclaimed shah. The accession took place at Herat in Rabl' I 989/April 15 81. However, Shah Muhammad Khudabanda advanced into Khurasan in such strength that the ambitious 'All Quli Khan was worsted at Ghuriyan, then forced to retreat and was finally surrounded at Herat. He thereupon surrendered. Nevertheless, he remained governor of his province and guardian of Prince 'Abbas. The motive force behind the counter-attack in Khurasan had been the Grand Vizier Mlrza Salman Jabirl. He had gained more and more influence at court and even when the queen was murdered his career suffered no more than a temporary setback. In the perilous game in which he was involved he staked his fortunes on Prince Hamza, married off his daughter to him, made his eldest son Mlrza 'Abd-Allah the prince's vizier, and accompanied him on his campaign in Qarabagh and Shlrvan. The grand vizier distinguished himself during this campaign, as also in the war against the Ottomans and in the battle against 'Adil Girai Khan, the brother of the khan of the Crimea. The public token of this rise to power was the bestowal of the rank of governor or iyalat. Eventually Mlrza Salman enjoyed the same kind of authority as
the shah's viceroy (vakil) in the days of Shah Isma'Il I,1 though he was never given this particular title. His success aroused the suspicion and jealousy of the Turkmen amirs and finally inspired them with a grow

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
ing hatred for him. They accused him of being hostile to the Qizilbash and of plotting against them, of harbouring a lust for power and interfering in military affairs which in their view could never be the concern of a vizier, an Iranian. The Herat campaign brought things to a head and they demanded that he be handed over (991/1583). Such was the bitterness of the amirs that the shah and Prince Hamza had no choice but to abandon the grand vizier to his enemies. His assassination demonstrates that in the eighty years since the beginning of Shah Isma'Il's career the rift within the Safavid empire between Iranian and Turk had still not been healed. Shah Isma'Il's plans to break the power of the Qizilbash by uniting the supreme administrative and military authority in the hands of a non-Turkish, Iranian vakil had been frustrated despite five successive attempts to tackle the problem. Shah Tahmasp I's endeavours had likewise met with little success. Although the office of viceroy existed during his reign, none of those appointed took a hand in military affairs after an initial attempt to do so had almost cost the vakil his life. However, these experiences had left the Turkmen generals with an almost traumatic sensitivity towards possible military aspirations on the part of some leading Iranian even though no military rank had in this case been conferred. Since they felt it degrading to be under the command of an Iranian, they fought to defend their military privileges even when a political analysis would have revealed that their position could rather be strengthened by a unanimity to be displayed in the face of external enemies.
We have taken a somewhat closer look at the internal conflicts of the Safavid empire after the accession of Muhammad Khudabanda in order to show the extent of the crisis caused by the advent of an incompetent ruler. The bloody quarrels among the amirs, the murder of the queen and Mlrza Salman, and the attempted secession in Khurasan were all merely symptomatic of this crisis. The tribal self-seeking of the Turkmen amirs continued to make itself felt even after the assassination of the grand vizier. But it would be pointless to unravel the details of the ensuing intrigues. What is more important is the effect that the obvious weakness of the Persian government had on its external foes. Events among the Safavids offered them a temptation which soon proved irresistible. One result was a new Ottoman attack on north-west Persia in 992/1584. Prince Hamza was dispatched at the

MUHAMMAD KHUDABANDA
head of inferior forces to confront 'Osman Pasha and Farhad Pasha, the commanders of the invading Turkish armies, but failed to recapture Tabriz. Even in the face of the enemy he had to deal with quarrels among the Qizilbash. On 24 Dhu'l-Hijja 994/6 December 15 86 he was assassinated in his camp in Azarbaljan. It has been claimed, though never proven, that the murderer, a barber by the name of KhudavardI,
had been hired by a group of conspirators among his officers.1 This new assassination triggered off a development of vital significance. It brought about the accession of Prince 'Abbas. After the death of Prince Hamza amirs of the Shamlu and Ustajlu tribes at court managed to thwart the succession of the shah's next son, Prince 'Abbas, and instead had his younger brother Abu Talib Mlrza (b. 15 74) proclaimed crown prince. This step led to immediate repercussions in Khurasan, where by now the initiative no longer lay in the hands of 'All Qull Khan Shamlu, the governor of Herat, but in those of the new governor of Mashhad, Murshid Qull Khan Ustajlu, who had succeeded in spiriting Prince 'Abbas off to Mashhad. He now proceeded to set in motion plans far more ambitious than those pursued by the governor of Herat in 989/1581 with his rebellion against the central government. He cleverly induced some Turkmen leaders in Khurasan to lend him their support. In addition declarations of loyalty to Prince 'Abbas arrived from other parts of the country. Since the shah had left the capital with the crown prince and his military retinue, Murshid Qull Khan ventured to ride with 'Abbas and a small escort - not more than a few hundred horsemen — to Qazvln in order to make his ward shah in place of his father. When he ascended the throne in Qazvln on 16 October 1587, 'Abbas became the fifth shah of the Safavid dynasty. Muhammad Khudabanda did not challenge the usurper even after returning to the capital. He continued to live in Qazvln for a time, but was then banished from court, a measure probably connected with an attempt to restore him to the throne. According to the accepted version of events, he was taken with Prince Abu Talib to Alamut, where his son Tahmasp Mlrza was already being held: it is said that all three were bunded. Since, however, Iskandar MunshI records that Navvab-i Sikandar-sha'n, as Khudabanda was known posthumously, died at Qazvln in the ninth

'ABBAS 1
Murshid Qull Khan Ustajlu, whom Shah 'Abbas appointed his viceroy {yakil-i divan-i 'alt), may well have counted on the sixteen-year-old ruler now giving him a free hand. This hope was rapidly dispelled. Before long the measures taken by the new government bore the hallmark of the young monarch himself. The most urgent problems confronting him were the same as those which had constantly recurred in previous years. In the first place there was the internal problem of the Turkmen tribalism which had been fostered by the protracted weakness of the central government. From the beginning of the reign of the Safavids, all-powerful tribal princes had filled the military offices at court, while others held sway with their clans in the provinces as feudal lords, either as governors or as the guardians of princes who had not yet attained the age of majority. In some provinces it appears that certain tribes regarded it as their prescriptive right to hold the governorship and other administrative offices — for instance, the Dulghadir in Fars and the Shamlu in Kirman. At about this time another problem arose with the renewed rise to power of certain previously subjugated local dynasties, mostly in the frontier regions of the empire. However, the external difficulties of the realm were almost more acute than the domestic situation. The enemies of the Safavids, especially the Ottomans in the west and the Uzbeks in the east, had overrun large areas, totalling well-nigh half the territory bequeathed by Shah Tahmasp to his successors; and now they were making preparations for fresh attacks on Persia. Under such conditions trade and industry suffered and the living standards of the people were correspondingly wretched. Through determined and consistently applied policies Shah 'Abbas I overcame the crisis in which the country had found itself at the beginning of his reign. It took him many years and he repeatedly suffered grave setbacks. Yet his eventual success, like his personality, left a deep

impression on his people. The memory of this particular shah survived in Iran for generations and even to this day it has not completely disappeared. What interests us, however, is the question of how he found for these problems the solutions which had eluded his predecessors for so long. The most urgent problem at the time of the shah's accession was the feuding of the Turkmen amirs, which had grown to the proportions of a civil war. As will be recalled, their power rested ultimately on the services rendered by their forefathers as soldiers of the Ardabll order at the time of the foundation and expansion of the Safavid empire. Of course, there could no longer be any question of the old relationship between the shah as grand master of the order and the Qizilbash as his disciples, nor is there any doubt that the theocratic ideas of Isma'Il I had lost their validity for Shah 'Abbas. If, however, the strength of the former religious ties had declined, this is not to say that they had been completely forgotten or had dwindled into insignificance. The erosion of these old ties has been amply demonstrated by the above-mentioned activities of the amirs. But their decay is also demonstrated by 'Abbas's readiness to cast aside the old customs of the order whenever it was in his interest to do so. On the other hand he willingly obeyed or enforced them if it suited him. Naturally the conflict with the Qizilbash was in the first instance a political problem, but
an element of the original religious relationship remained.1 Apart from this religious aspect the history of the Safavid empire up to 'Abbas I is synonymous with the history of the rivalry between the two leading ethnic groups within the state, the Turkmen and the Iranian elements. One can also view it as a conflict between town and country, between nomads and settlers. There were plenty of attempts to achieve a solution. It is an open question whether we should lay greater emphasis on the endeavour to break the dominant power of the Turkmen amirs or on the effort to unite and reconcile Persian and Turk such as was represented in the person of individual members of the Safavid dynasty. Whichever view we take, the failure is obvious:
1 Its foundations had already been undermined at Chaldiran, as pointed out by Savory, "The Principal Offices ....during the reign of Isma'Il I", p. 91. But this leaves open the question how far the Safavid monarchs were still seen as masters of the order or laid claim to that role. At any rate, as late as 'Abbas's death in 1038/1629 attempts were made to obtain the consent of all available members of the order regarding the succession, in the traditional manner: Braun, Das Erbe Schah 'Abbas' I, p. 104; and below, p. 279 . See also Savory, "The Office of Khalifat al-khulafa".
263



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
nobody succeeding in working out a compromise between these opposing elements. The new shah tackled the Turkmen amirs from the outset in a relentless and uncompromising fashion. He began by executing a group of tribal amirs whom he held responsible for the murder of his brother Hamza. He continued by crushing savagely a conspiracy of tribal leaders who were plotting to depose him, and then eliminated his erstwhile guardian Murshid Qull Khan Ustajlu, who had boycotted an expedition to relieve the siege of Herat by the Uzbeks because of his long-standing dispute with the city governor, 'AH Qull Khan Shamlu. There were several other examples over the years, but we need not go into detail at this-point. The experiences of the shah's youth, such as the assassination of his mother and his brother Hamza, undoubtedly helped to inspire his life-long suspicion of the Qizilbash. So ineradicable was this suspicion that he even removed an outstanding general for the sole reason that he considered him to have acquired too much power. In the end Shah 'Abbas succeeded in breaking the stranglehold of the Turkmen amirs and in suppressing the constant squabbles among the tribes. Shah 'Abbas's reign saw the beginning of the end for the Tiirkmens, the decline of their military and political influence and the eclipse of their social status. The contempt and distrust with which they were regarded by the ruler resulted in their being squeezed out of the most important military commands. We witness in effect the disbanding of the praetorian guard into which the Qizilbash had developed after the accession of Shah Tahmasp I. This is not to say that they disappeared from the scene altogether: there were still Qizilbash units in Persia during the reign of Shah 'Abbas and even down to the collapse of his dynasty in the 12th/18th century. But henceforth they were no longer the sole military caste. After they had been neutralised the structure of the Safavid empire was fundamentally transformed. Shah 'Abbas could only achieve a lasting success by creating a counterbalance to the Qizilbash on the one hand and by compensating for the loss of military striking power on the other. He employed various means to this end. One was a procedure associated with the term shablsavani which aimed at polarising feeling among the Qizilbash. It took the form of a summons to "those loyal to the king", the royalists. It seems that in this way reliable elements among the Qizilbash were identified and then probably reor

ganised into fresh military units. However, we have no detailed know
ledge of this.1 We know a good deal more about the establishment of a new corps in the Safavid army, the cavalry formation of royal squires (qullar or ghuldmdn-i kbdssa-yi sharifa) whose commander bore the title of qullardqdsi. These royal squires, mostly Muslim converts descended from Christians of diverse races, had either come to Persia as children or had been born of Georgian, Circassian, Caucasian and Armenian parents, often prisoners of war, who had already settled in Persia. This corps, which was raised by 'Abbas shortly after his accession, proved so valuable that the Qizilbash formations were soon reduced to a half or even less of their original establishment. As their first commander, a Georgian convert to Islam by the name of AllahvardI Khan, won great esteem and was honoured with the title of Sultan. Qullar who proved their worth could rise to high office: they were employed as governors - AllahvardI Khan himself succeeded in becoming governor of Fars or were even appointed commanders of Turkmen troops when the latter failed to produce suitable candidates for vacant positions from among their own ranks. In time they came to occupy about a fifth of all the key positions in the administration. Among the royal squires there was a secondary troop, the corps of musketeers {tufangchtydri) which had already existed in a more modest way under Shah Tahmasp I. It was composed of the most diverse ethnic elements, among them representatives of the Persian peasantry, Arabs and also Tiirkmens. In addition there was an artillery corps (tupchiydri), a military arm of which the Persians were not particularly enamoured. Although the Safavids exploited it readily enough in siege situations, they did not make much use of artillery in the field. Sir Robert Sherley, an English adventurer, is usually credited with the introduction of artillery into Persia. He arrived at the Persian court in 1598 with his brother Sir Anthony and a group of other Europeans. It is a fact that Shah 'Abbas sought this man's advice on the question of military reforms and AllahvardI Khan adopted his suggestions for the reorganisation of the army. He also supervised the production of artillery pieces. But he had nothing to do with the introduction of artillery

From the synonymous phrase sala-ji shabisavanikardan it is clear that the meaning is not "to make Shah's friends", as in Tapper, "Shahsevan", p. 6j, but rather "to proclaim: Let him who loves the Shah present himself at such and such a place". Cf. further Minorsky, "La Perse au XVe siecle", p. 326.

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
into Persia, because the Persians had long since been familiar with it.1 By the end of the ioth/i6th century the number of troops at the shah's disposal - in addition to the Qizilbash - amounted to 37,000 men. This total comprised the corps of royal squires (10,000), a bodyguard again formed by squires (3,000), and the corps of musketeers and
artillery (12,000 each). The artillery was equipped with 500 cannons.2 The essential characteristic of these new formations was that they were not tied to any one tribal organisation and hence were not commanded by members of the Turkmen military aristocracy. Moreover they were paid directly out of the royal chest, not out of the military appropriations like the Qizilbash.
These military and administrative reforms took many years to complete and it was some time before they bore fruit. They were of no help in the military crises which confronted Shah 'Abbas I at the beginning of his career. What was needed there above all was astute political decisions — in the first place peace with the Ottomans, which could not have been easy for the shah to accept. But since he had no hope of defeating them as long as several provinces were in revolt and the Uzbeks were occupying Khurasan, this was the only means open to him of securing a free hand to deal with his other, even more pressing problems. Ottoman troops who had already invaded large areas of Persia in the reign of Muhammad Khudabanda — parts of Azarbaljan along with Tabriz, parts of Georgia and Qarabagh, the city of Erivan, Shirvan and Khuzistan — extended their conquest of Persian territory still further after the accession of the new shah. Baghdad was lost to them in 995/1587 and shortly afterwards they took Ganja. Negotiations with the Porte led to the Peace of Istanbul on 21 March 15 90. This put an end to twelve years of hostilities between the Ottomans and the Safavids. The conditions imposed on the shah were unusually harsh. They included the loss of Azarbaljan and Qarabagh together with Ganja, • of Shirvan and Daghistan, of the Safavid possessions in Georgia, of parts of Kurdistan and Luristan, of Baghdad and Mesopotamia. Although Ardabil, the seat of the Safavid order, remained in Persian hands, the old capital of Tabriz, where Shah Isma'Il I had founded

his empire, had to be relinquished. A clause which decreed that the Persians should desist from anathematising the Orthodox Caliphs — a practice instigated by the founder of the empire - added a particularly humiliating note to the peace treaty, for it involved the original hallmark, as it were, of the Safavid state. The peace which was bought at such a price gave the shah a free hand to solve urgent internal problems and to confront his foreign enemies in the east. (We shall discuss these measures later.) Yet the fundamentally unacceptable terms militated against a final peace settlement, and relations with the Ottomans were to occupy 'Abbas for the rest of his life. To begin with, however, he turned his attention to the Uzbeks, who had been occupying Khurasan for the past ten years. Disputes concerning the succession in Transoxiana favoured his undertaking, and in 1007/1598-9 he reconquered Herat and Mashhad, also extending his control to include Balkh, Marv and Astarabad. But when, two years later, BaqI Muhammad Khan, the new ruler of Transoxiana, reoccupied Balkh, the Safavid troops found they were no match for him and were finally not only forced to withdraw, but lost the greater part of their new artillery in the process (1011/1602-3). That, for the moment, was the end of the Safavid-Uzbek conflict. In spite of their eventual losses, the Persians had gained from it by the reconquest of western Khurasan, the area lying to the north of it and bordering the Turkmen desert and including Marv and Nasa, and eastern Khurasan, including Herat, Sabzavar and Farah. Later — in 1031/1622 — they also won back Qandahar, which the Mughal emperor Akbar had wrested from the Safavids in 1003/1594, when 'Abbas had been in no position to put up an effective defence. With the successes in the east the danger of a war on two fronts was
checked, so that even by 1012/1603—4 t n e shah was able to risk a confrontation with the Ottomans. He now reconquered Azarbaljan, Nakhchivan and Erivan. The Turkish supreme commander Chighalezade Pasha, preparing to strike back, suffered a crushing defeat at Tabriz. Although a new peace agreement was drawn up in 1612 at Istanbul which re-established the old Turkish — Persian frontier, the sultan tried once again a few years later, albeit in vain, to recover control of the ceded Transcaucasian and Persian conquests by means of another military expedition. A Safavid campaign against Mesopotamia in 1033/1623-4 re-established Persian control over the Kurdish territories of Daquq, Kirkiik and Shahrazur, Karbala and

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
Najaf, and in addition over Baghdad, though in this case only for fifteen years; a further result was the occupation of Diyarbakr. These had been preceded by further extensions of territory: in 1010/ 1601—2 the island of Bahrain had been annexed, and in 1016/1607-8 Shlrvan had been reconquered. A series of campaigns brought extensive areas of Georgia into Persian hands. However, 'Abbas was not able to subdue Kakhetia, and was in fact obliged to recognise the government of King Theimuraz I. In 1031/1622 he succeeded though only with the help of the English - in driving the Portuguese out of Hurmuz.
The chaotic state of affairs at home at the beginning of the reign of 'Abbas seemed to herald the dissolution of the Safavid empire or, more correctly, the rump state that was left after the depredations of neighbouring powers. This, it seemed, was what was likely to happen, with the development of various opposing small states under Turkmen princes, roughly comparable to the petty princedoms {uc beylikleri) of Anatolia in the 8th/i4th century. It is not inappropriate to describe the situation by saying that Shah 'Abbas had to reconquer his own land "from the Tiirkmens and other military leaders who had to all intents
and purposes become autonomous".1 By throwing in his newly constituted forces, and by dint of an adroit policy at home, he managed to master this Sisyphean task. His perspicacity is particularly evident from the fact that in spite of the tough, even brutal measures he took, he did not allow himself to be swept into a rigid consistency of action which might have called forth a solid front on the part of the mutually disaffected tribal chieftains. Thus he not only preserved the old lifeguards (qurchls) but, as we have seen, retained in addition to the new military formations contingents of the old Qizilbash amirs; and he did not touch the possessions of the Turkmen lords provided they re
mained loyal. Indeed, new fiefs {tiyul)7- were granted, and not only to Turkmen army officers but also to the non-Tiirkmen commanders of the new corps. His appeal to the old discipline of the order (suflgari), to which reference has been made above, and the loyalty due to the shah as grand master of the order (shahlsavanl) may well have reflected similar considerations.

ABBAS I
Nevertheless, during his reign of over forty years, the shah adhered consistently to the principle of centralisation for his state. Evidence for this is to be found not only in the reorganisation of the armed forces, with the creation of a standing army, the quashing of particularist tendencies on the part of the Qizilbash amirs and the abolition of practically independent tribal rulerships such as those just mentioned, the Dulghadir in Fars or those of the Afshar in Kirman, but also the annexation of the former vassal states of Mazandaran (1005-6/1596-8), Gllan (1000/1592 Lahljan, 1003/1595 Rasht) and Lar (1010/1601-2) and the resubjection or firmer attachment of independent areas such as the Georgian regions of Kakhetia (1029-30/1620-1) and Meskhetia (1032-3/1623-4) and the province of Makran (1017/1608-9). The idea of centralisation is particularly in evidence in the way in which crown lands {khassa or khalisa) were systematically increased. There had in fact been royal demesnes in the Safavid empire prior to this. But it was 'Abbas I who began the process of incorporating whole provinces, indeed major provinces, into the crown lands, a practice to which his successors adhered. The implications of this can be assessed if we remember that between 996/1588 and 1014/1606 the provinces of Qazvln, Kashan, Isfahan, Kirman (in part), Yazd, Qum, Mazandaran, Gllan, Astara and Gaskar were finally, or at any rate for some considerable period, converted into royal demesne lands, so that their total revenue was reserved for the use of the shah, i.e. could neither be paid into the state treasury nor used for purposes of enfeoffment. At the end of the ioth/i6th and the beginning of the nth/17th century, Shah 'Abbas had mastered the crisis which had shaken his country at the time of his accession, in respect both of external enemies and of disruptive forces at home. Iran now enjoyed the greatest territorial extent it ever reached under the Safavids. After security had been restored in the country, 'Abbas turned his attention to establishing an effective administration. In the development of transport routes, which he pursued with energy, particularly noteworthy is the network of caravansarais he created, many of which are still preserved today,
either completely or in remarkable remains,1 and take their place among the characteristic monuments of Persia. These and other measures invigorated trade and industry, so that the broad masses of the population also found that their standard of living was at first

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
improved and ultimately reached a level never known up to that time. Whereas in other parts of the Islamic world around this period economic setbacks occurred, due to the recessions in Mediterranean trade and the extension of Atlantic trade, Persia - at any rate in this period seems to have been spared these changes and the consequences of the decline of the Central Asian caravan routes, from which it was in any case largely cut off by its Uzbek neighbours. Isfahan, which took the place of Qazvln as the new capital of the country in 1006/1598 - Qazvln having in its half a century as the metropolis undergone no significant development as a city - now became, as it were, the symbol of resurgence. 'Abbas called on the services of architects, artists and craftsmen to develop it. Though basing their approaches on an older tradition in architecture, town planning and decorative style, they developed the specifically Safavid style to a point of such rare maturity that it still has power to captivate the observer of today. Some of its most beautiful monuments are grouped around the Royal Square (Maidan-i Shah), which - according to the testimony of European travellers of the time - were without parallel anywhere, especially the Masjid-i Shah, the 'All Qapu gatehouse and the Shaikh Lutf -Allah Mosque. With these, a new array of jewels was added to the rich treasury of brilliant architectural achievements left by the earlier dynasties in Persia, and such as represented a culmination of the aesthetic standards of a whole epoch. The artistic creativity of the Islamic world once more attained to a peak of achievement, represented in the popular punning phrase Isfahan nisf-i jahdn: "Isfahan, half the world". The motives that led Shah 'Abbas to move his capital from Qazvln to Isfahan are not as clearly discernible as those of his grandfather
Tahmasp fifty years earlier, when he chose Qazvln in place of Tabriz.1 The decisive element at that time had been fear of the Ottomans and, connected with this, a certain tendency towards Iranicising the Safavid empire, together with a mistrust of the Turkmen tribes and their influence (which was particularly strong in Azarbaljan and Tabriz). But it is possible that now, in changed circumstances, it was especially his desire for a centrally situated position within the reconstituted Persian empire that determined 'Abbas to make the change, and the

'ABBAS I
opportunities of developing the city according to his own ideas. And of course we must not underplay his personal preference for Isfahan, to which sources refer. It seems highly likely that another factor was the climatic advantages of the area, its ample supply of water and the fertility of the developed land in the vicinity, even though the population had from time immemorial not enjoyed the best of reputations for their tendency - attested by KhunjI, himself a native of the city - to
indulge in rumour-mongering and intrigues of every kind.1 The shah succeeded in creating a position of parity for his new capital among the famous Islamic metropolises. As a result not only of its development architecturally, but also by virtue of its vigorous economic, social and political life, Isfahan was preserved from the odium of provincialism that Qazvln had never been able to shake off. With the international repute that 'Abbas won for himself, the diplomatic contacts linking him to the potentates of his time also intensified. These included, in addition to the contiguous powers such as the Great Mughals of India, the khan of the Crimean Tartars and the Tsar of Muscovy, as also many Western powers, and there are many contemporary descriptions of the magnificence attending the comings and goings of emissaries from other countries. An associated factor was the presence of Western merchants, artists and monks, who were free to move around at will in the country provided they did not engage in proselytising activities among the Muslims. We know of Carmelites, Augustinians and Capuchins who paid visits to Isfahan and other places in the land, and to some of these we owe highly informative accounts of the shah's court and of life in the country and among the
people, and accounts of events they witnessed at first hand.2 This period of distinction for Isfahan must be attributed in part no doubt to the shah's population policy, a matter we have already touched on in connection with his reform of the armed forces. This fed in elements, not only to the troops, but to the population at large, whose energy and skills in various crafts and whose trading enterprise benefited the economic life of the capital. It was particularly evident in the transfer of three thousand Armenian families from the AzarbaTjanI city of Julfa to Isfahan, where they were settled beyond the Zayandariid in a new part of the city which was then given the same name as their old home town, a name it still preserves. Many Georgians, too,

were brought into the country as prisoners of war and around the middle of the nth/17th century numbered 20,000 souls in Isfahan alone. Unlike the Armenians and also, incidentally, the members of the
old Jewish community,1 both of which groups adhered doggedly to their separate linguistic and religious traditions, they were assimilated fairly easily into the indigenous population.
The Iran of the end of the ioth/i6th and the first quarter of the nth/17th century: the rebirth of the Safavid state out of chaos; the emergence of a state enjoying high regard abroad among the powers of the Near East which had already begun to expand into Persian territory; widespread revival of economic life; the development of an indigenous cultural style, accompanied by an admirable flowering of the arts - all this was the work of Shah 'Abbas I. And though his historical significance has long been known there has as yet been no adequate appraisal in the West of 'Abbas as a ruler — for he was the ruler without whom Persia's transition to the modern age cannot be understood — in spite of the wealth of material available. In what follows we will attempt to trace out at least the most important features of his personality. Robert Sherley, who of course knew the shah personally, speaks of him in the following terms: "His person is such as well-understanding nature wouldfitfor the end proposed for his being — excellently wellshaped, of most well-proportioned stature, strong and active; his colour, somewhat inclined to a man-like blackness, is also more black by sun-burning; the furniture of his mind infinitely royal, wise, valiant, liberal, temperate, merciful; and an exceeding lover of justice, embracing royally other virtues as far from pride and vanity as from all
unprincely sins or acts."2 Of these qualities, it is his liberality of outlook which is expecially striking in contrast with his bigoted father, Tahmasp I, not to mention other oriental potentates of the day. It was clearly evident in his tolerance towards Jews and Christians, for instance, not only in his permitting them to exercise their religion and to build churches, but in the fact that he himself even had a church built for the Armenians brought to New Julfa.

ABBAS I
There was no question of his indulging in libertarian attitudes in questions of religion. He is, rather, described as a good Muslim, and in this connection there is a reference to a pilgrimage to Mashhad which
he made on foot;1 we hear, too, of the repair work he had carried out to the mausoleum of the Eighth Imam, damaged by the Uzbeks, and his fondness for visiting the famous Shl'I places of pilgrimage at Ardabll, Mashhad, Karbala and Najaf. It is significant that he insisted on keeping his role as master of the order of the Safaviyya among the population, as can be seen on the occasion of his visits to Ardabll. This is consistent with his having regarded himself as a sayyid, that is to say, his claiming descent from 'All, whose memory he held in honour along with that of the Twelve Imams. In his personal life he kept in a high degree to the religious commandments except where he allowed himself to be driven into breaches of it by his fundamentally sensuous approach to life. Numerous pious foundations (auqdf) were the work of Shah 'Abbas, such as grants of land from his demesnes in Azarbaijan, Qazvin, Kashan and Isfahan; and he maintained close relations with many religious scholars ('u/ama), especially those who eschewed worldly ambition. In spite of his great tolerance towards non-Islamic confessions, there was a limit to his indulgence regarding the Sunnls among his own subjects. Though he would go no further than to make unmistakeable allusions to his own Shl'I faith in his dealings with the ambassadors of neighbouring SunnI countries, his Sunni subjects or SunnI prisoners of war, especially theologians amongst them, could count on no consideration and clemency from him; far less the adherents of heretical movements, of which there were many at the time, e.g. the ahl-i nuqta, also known as the Nuqtavtydn, followers of Mahmud PasikhanI GllanI, who had proclaimed a doctrine with metempsychotic characteristics around
the year 1400.2 Enthusiasts for these and similar views, who were to be found in various Persian cities and in various social classes up to the highest strata of society, were persecuted on the orders of the shah, and where it was possible to arrest them or to trace them in his entourage, they were sentenced to death. Such movements were in fact not without a dangerous aspect, since they generally entailed political aims, as for instance in the case of Mulla Qasim, a Nuqtavi who challenged the

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
shah's right to the throne. This being so, the shah's reaction was no different from those of his Sunni opponents to the west and east of his empire in their attitude towards ShfI tendencies. Though the shah was in advance of his time in many ways, he remained a child of his age in other respects, especially in the superstitious notions he entertained. It is possible to find a religious explanation for his putting on a shirt embroidered with verses from the Qur'an when marching into battle, but not for the respect he showed to astrological predictions and the dreams he had, and to which he paid heed in reaching decisions. Such facets of his character are of course of no consequence in estimating his personality. Of more interest is his relationship to art, especially representational art of various kinds; and this, of course, touches on religious issues in a number of respects. We are referring not to sacred architecture or its decor, mentioned above, but particularly to painting, which clearly implies some attitude to the Islamic prohibition of visual representation. Reference has been made to Tahmasp's service to book miniatures: we should add that as he grew old, and under the influence of increasing bigotry, he turned more and more away from this interest. The case was quite different with Shah 'Abbas. He seems to have shared neither the personal engagement of his grandfather nor his religious scruples. It is natural that a man who had spent the greater part of his youth among the productions and abiding stimuli of Timurid art in Herat and Mashhad was not without sensitivity to the artistic expressions of his time. Indeed we can still see in the Shaikh Lutf -Allah mosque, with its textual scrolls and lacy roof ornamentation, a personal involvement of the shah in architecture and its development similar to that of his grandfather in the sphere of art; and with the transfer of the capital from Qazvln to Isfahan the workshops attached to the royal court also had to move, and the artists employed there along with them. Thus it came about that the great painter Riza-yi 'AbbasI was able in Isfahan to develop an entirely new style, differing from that of Qazvln, in whose traditions he had grown up and worked hitherto. It is plain that this sort of thing did not take place without the active interest and encouragement of the ruler. The latter's influence, however, hitherto a decisive factor in artistic developments, begins — precisely under Shah 'Abbas I — to decline, and to decline in favour of commercial influences. This is most evident in the sphere of ceramics, textiles, and carpet designing, all of them up to this time
274



ABBAS I
areas of largely individual creativity. With the introduction of workshops for export production — a departure for which the shah was responsible — their products lost their value as individual artistic achievements and sank to the level of industrial products. This change was also felt in book illustration. What was now produced in this sphere was no longer made for the ruler alone, or at any rate for governors of princely rank in the provincial capitals, but also for other customers, who included parties with a commercial interest. Recent attempts to rescue the Safavids from the odium of indiffer
ence to creative writing,1 if not indeed of its neglect or suppression, show that Shah 'Abbas took a positive attitude at all events to individual poets, for example to Sharaf al-Dln Hasan Shifa'I (d. 1037/1628), whom he appointed poet laureate, or to ShamI, whom he had weighed in gold as a sign of his recognition, and to Kamall Sabzavari (d. 1020/1611 —12), who celebrated his exploits in a verse epic entitled
Shah-nama or 'Abbas-ndma.2 However, since relationships of this kind form the exception rather than the rule, they signify little. The criticism of Safavid poetry, whether justified or not, as lacking in originality, full of banalities and "endless verbal niceties" is not shaken by such evidence. Emigration of Persian poets, particularly to India, which had been going on at least since the time of Shah Tahmasp, did not cease under Abbas. Indian courts, at which the old interest in courtly poetry continued, offered at any rate better opportunities than Isfahan with its Safavid traditions, and not only for poets but for other artists such as calligraphers and miniature painters, whose success was largely dependent on the ruler's attitudes to aesthetic matters. The shah's interest in the intellectual and artistic culture of his time is unmistakeably evident, sometimes in the form of unique works of art, and certainly also in the large number of artistic achievements that appeared. But it is also unmistakeably the case that this influence was exercised, if not exclusively, at any rate largely, to resuscitate an older heritage, that of the Timurids; in other words, it was not always based on original conceptions. And in addition, these reversions to the past, however impressive they may be when seen from a distance or at a casual glance, reveal on closer inspection a more or less hasty manner

of execution, a lesser degree of thoroughness than the originals, and the use of less costly materials. Nevertheless, alongside the successes of the statesman, the general, and the far-sighted politician must be reckoned also the achievements of the builder of cities, the architect and the patron of the arts. Enterprise, energy, shrewdness and a degree of tolerance remarkable for his time went together in 'Abbas with intellectual curiosity, as is clear from his taste for conversations with Islamic and Christian theologians and with western diplomats and merchants, his aesthetic sensitivity and, albeit with certain limitations, his knowledgeability in artistic matters. In spite of his many talents, the shah was unable to muster either the statesmanship or the personal qualities to contend with one momentous problem relating both to the political situation and to the personal sphere. This was the question of arranging the succession and the treatment of his sons; and here he may have been influenced by residual elements of the Turkish notion that authority did not reside exclusively in,the reigning prince but was the property of the ruling family as a
whole.1 Among the eleven children of the shah known to us, five were sons: (i) Muhammad Baqir MIrza, usually called SafI MIrza, (a) Hasan MIrza, (3) Sultan Muhammad MIrza, also referred to as Ruzak MIrza or Muhammad Khudabanda MIrza, after his grandfather, who died in the year of his birth (1006/1597-8), (4) Isma'Il MIrza, and (5) Imam
Qull MIrza.2 Of these princes, Hasan MIrza and Isma'Il MIrza died while still in childhood. Abbas was not only conscious of problems with princes that had come the way of his immediate predecessors - some during his own lifetime - and, before that, of most of his forebears who had occupied the throne; he had himself come to the throne as the result of a coup d'etat, had deposed his own father and banished him from the capital together with his two surviving brothers, whom he had caused to be blinded. To these memories was added the fear of possible acts of vengeance on the part of malcontents among the aristocracy of the empire, especially the relatives of tribal chieftains he had eliminated or

In the genealogy provided by Rohrborn, Provm%en und Zmtralgewalt, p. 1 j 8, "Sultan Husain MIrza" should be deleted and Isma'Il MIrza included in the penultimate position. A further son, Tahmasp MIrza, mentioned in some of the sources, is apparently identical with Hasan MIrza.
276



ABBAS I
stripped of power among the generals of the Qizilbash. With these things in the background, he developed attitudes of suspicion and mistrust that stayed with him all his life. In his efforts to rule out conspiracies and coups d'etat, he kept his courtiers, especially the military men, away from his sons as far as it lay in his power to do so, and expressly forbade them to have dealings with his offspring, in several instances punishing infringements of his orders with cruel penalties. The princes were largely banished to the harem, where their social relationships were restricted to the princesses, the ladies of the harem, and the eunuchs. They received no training in either statecraft or soldiering and were likewise excluded from participating in their father's campaigns.
As a result of the sanguinary means by which the shah had seized and secured power, and of his rigid conduct of state affairs, he had indeed made many enemies. A number of these entertained sympathies for his eldest son, the crown prince Safi Mlrza, and would have liked to see him ruling in his father's place, particularly as he had the reputation of good character and warm personal qualities. The very fact of the increasing popularity of the prince was a thorn in the flesh to the shah. When, in addition, he encountered plans to depose him in Safi Mlrza's favour, he resolved to remove him from the scene. Upon warnings given by one of the court astrologers and the advice of his closest counsellors, he was persuaded to do away with the prince. He met his end at the age of twenty-seven while on a visit to Rasht, where, in 1024/1615, he was stabbed to death on his father's orders while returning from his bath. All the evidence suggests that the prince was innocent, as 'Abbas seems to have realised afterwards. At all events, he never recovered, to his dying day, from the horrific memory of his evil decision. Nevertheless, his concern for the security of the throne and his own life had such a grip on him that some time later he had the eyes put out of Prince Sultan Muhammad Mlrza, his grandson Sulaiman Mlrza, the eldest son of Safi Mlrza, and even — at the very end of his life — the crown prince Imam Qull Mlrza, thus eliminating them from the succession, which in accordance with Islamic ideas is barred to pretenders who are blind.
The murder of Safi Mlrza aroused an enormous sensation of disquiet and horror not only in the shah's entourage but also among the people. In Rasht even riots ensued. But since the circle of those who knew the true facts was a small one, such expressions of anger or
277



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
protest led to no further consequences. Persian historians, from whom the truth of these events was not hidden, have named Shah 'Abbas "the Great", and so he is known in Iran to this day. In view of his splendid achievements and the services he rendered his country it is a title which can hardly be challenged. Possibly his actions can be judged in a somewhat more lenient light in view of the circumstances of the time in which he lived.
It is too easy for the observer of history, impressed by the record of Shah 'Abbas's great achievements for his country, not only to be tempted to feel that the less spectacular ages which followed his reign were a period of decline, but to see his death as the beginning of the end of Safavid rule. This view is emphatically not justified. Apart from the outward and visible magnificence which continued under the later Safavids, there were in the remaining century of their rule in Iran still decades in which the empire maintained an impressive level of achievement and when large sections of the population were able to enjoy wealth or at least reasonable prosperity, even though the period of territorial expansion was over once and for all. One fateful cause of the later decline of his dynasty and its power was indeed the work of Shah 'Abbas himself, namely his neglect of the succession. The elimination of royal princes, whether by blinding them or immuring them in the harem, their exclusion from the affairs of state and from contact with the leading aristocracy of the empire and the generals, all the abuses of the princes' education, which were nothing new but which became the normal practice with 'Abbas at the court of Isfahan, effectively put a stop to the training of competent successors, that is to say, efficient princes prepared to meet the demands of ruling as kings. The result was that from then on the princes who came to the throne had from their earliest youth been ruined by living in the women's quarters, by indulgence shown towards them by all around, by courtiers, eunuchs and concubines, and were not only quite useless in the performance of their duties but often totally uninterested.
SAFI I
When Shah 'Abbas died at his summer palace at Ashraf in Mazandaran on 24 Jumada I 1038/19 January 1629 none of his brothers and none of his sons was available to take on the succession. Those who were still
278



SAFI I
alive had been blinded and were thus unsuitable to rule. He had appointed his grandson Sam Mlrza, a son of the murdered SafI Mlrza as his successor, although in a not entirely unambiguous fashion. The decision to have the prince come to Ashraf to prepare him to take over the throne came too late, and the negotiations about what was to happen after his death, which the shah conducted with various leading figures from his deathbed, achieved no results. As it proved impossible to keep the shah's death a secret, and as the alternative possibility of unforeseeable developments such as the enthronement of another prince, local risings, or intervention by neighbouring powers, could not be ruled out, the leading figures in the empire who were present in Ashraf, especially the Grand Vizier {va^tr-i a'^ani) Khalifa Sultan and the commander of the guards (qiirchi-bdshi) 'Isi Khan, made every effort to arrange for the succession of Sam Mlrza at the earliest possible moment. A document to this effect which was sent to Isfahan had the desired effect. Promptly on 28 January 1629, three weeks before the court entourage returned, he mounted the throne in accordance with the wishes of his grandfather, adopting the royal title Shah SafI (I). Reports on this change of rulers expressly stress the part played by members of the Safavid order and the fact that the observances of the
order were fulfilled.1 According to these reports, the leading aristocrats of the empire had assured themselves of the agreement of this group at the Ashraf meeting, and in Isfahan the rules of the sufls were observed at the enthronement. It may be legitimate to see in this regard a connection with the attitude of the dead shah, who repeatedly had attached the greatest importance to his position as pir and murshid, i.e. master of the order and its spiritual leader. On the other hand, it is of some interest to note (especially in view of the observances of the order we have referred to, but of which we obtain no very precise details in the source materials), that Mir Damad, equally famous as a philosopher and representative of "orthodox" Shl'I theology, took part in the solemn ceremonies at Isfahan. The details we have about the character of the new ruler, who began his reign at the age of eighteen, seem at first sight to be contradictory. On the one hand he is praised for his lavish generosity, and on the other he is reproached with unbounded cruelty. Foreign observers

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
who had personal contacts with him praise his charm and his uncomplicated character, which they contrast with the inscrutable and incalculable attitudes of his grandfather. Which of these estimates is correct? Was Shah SafI a warm and generous ruler or a bloody despot? It is certainly the case that, for instance, at his enthronement he distributed lavish presents. But when we learn that so enormous a sum as 5 00,000 tumans was spent for this purpose, and Imam Quli Khan, the grand beg of Fars, was remitted a whole year's instalment (60,000 tumans) of the dues he owed, it is more appropriate to speak of wild extravagance than of generosity. It can also not be denied that in the early years of his reign almost all the royal princes, including the sons of his predecessor's daughters and even the princes who in any case had been blinded, were systematically murdered and that, in addition, a large number of leading figures in the empire and servants of the court were done to death, for example - in 1630 — the commander-in-chief of the armed forces (sipdbsdldr-i kull-i sipdh) Zainal Khan Shamlu, in 1632 the generals of the guards (qurchi-bashl) 'Isa Khan and Chiragh Khan Zahidi, in 1634 the Grand Vizier (vazlr-i a'zam) MIrza Talib Urdubadi and the lord marshal {ishik-dqdsi-bdsht) Ughurlii Khan Shamlu. These are merely a few names, quoted as examples which may stand for many more besides. Even if one is disposed, in view of the circumstances of this period, to see the liquidation of royal rivals as an understandable protective measure and even to attribute the execution of undesirable dignitaries in the state and army to the exigencies of raison d'etat; indeed, if one assumes it to have been probable that the shah was heavily influenced by individuals in his immediate entourage, it is still not possible to
acquit SafI of the charge of exceptional cruelty.1 The study of the actions and attitudes of the new shah reveals no sign of a more human dimension to his personality which would explain the positive comments of European observers; rather, it is the features of a moody despot that stand out, one who kept those around him in a state of fear and trembling by assassination and arbitrary death sentences. Moreover, the degree of interest he evinced for the business of state was only peripheral in character, if not non-existent, and it seems likely that he took not the slightest part in the intellectual and cultural life of his people; for in spite of a number of efforts to begin, he had not even

managed to attain a reasonable standard in reading and writing. If we add to this the fact that he indulged with increasing frequency a taste for wine and that it had been prescribed, we are told, to counteract certain effects of opium, to which he had apparently become addicted at quite an early age, we are left with a somewhat grim picture of the ruler and the thirteen years he occupied the throne before death from excessive drinking carried him off. Although he received instruction from several experienced leading figures of the empire in affairs of state, starting shortly after he ascended the throne, little appears to have been achieved through these efforts to influence the shah to take more than the slightest interest - a reaction which is clearly the result of his upbringing in the harem. The decisions that had to be taken therefore became the responsibility of other important personages, however much they may have contrived to suggest to their master that they emanated from him. With a simpleminded, uncomplicated personality, as his is described, this can hardly have been a very difficult matter, for he was quite incapable of keeping himself immune from the intrigues and insinuations of his courtiers. This was especially serious when such machinations were aimed at competent and unexceptionable people, whose fate was then almost invariably sealed. If we enquire who were the real rulers in the state, we find that in the early years of the new reign four outstanding personalities emerge: the lord marshal (ishlk-aqasl-bashl) Ughurlu Khan Shamlu; a Georgian named Rustam Beg, formerly imperial provost (divdn-begi), and later in addition general commanding the musketeers (tufangchiaqasT) and commander-in-chief of the armed forces (sipahsalar-i kull-i sipah); Chiragh Khan Zahidl, who at first had no special office and later was appointed general of the guards (qurchl-bashl); and lastly another Georgian named Rustam Khan, who was town governor (ddriigha) of Isfahan and general of the royal squires (qullaraqasi) and had originally been known as Khusrau Mirza and also as Khusrau Khan. We may also assume that various ladies of the harem, for example the queen mother and, at least for a time, Zainab Begum, one of 'Abbas I's daughters, exercised some influence. We have already come across the names of two of the people mentioned above, Ughurlu Khan Shamlu and Chiragh Khan Zahidl, in connection with the victims of Shah Safl's tyrannical rule. In 1630 Rustam Beg Dlvanbegl became grand beg {begkrbegi) of Azarbaljan and his namesake

Mention should be made at this point of the elimination of the most powerful and wealthy man in Iran after the ruler, and his sons. This was Imam Qull Khan, the recipient of such munificence on the occasion of Safl's accession. He was not only grand beg of Fars and Kuhglluya, but also governor of Lar, Hurmuz (Jarun), the Bahrain islands, Gulpalgan and Tuysirkan. In these offices he had followed in the footsteps of his father, AllahvardI Khan, who had risen to high office under Shah 'Abbas I. Shah 'Abbas had even honoured him, a practice not unknown among the Safavids, by giving him one of his own wives in marriage. On the rather threadbare charge of conspiracy with insubordinate dignitaries in north-west Persia and Georgia, he and nearly all his numerous sons were put to death in 1632. The simultaneous conversion of the province of Fars into crown lands was entirely in line with the policy of centralisation that Shah 'Abbas had pursued on a grand scale by strengthening the shah's position as the central authority at the expense of the provinces controlled by state governors. Ultimately, the dominant influence at the court of Isfahan came to be that of the Grand Vizier (va^tr-i a'^am-i divan-i a'la) Mlrza Muhammad Taql, usually known as Mlrza TaqI or Saru Taqi ("Taqi of the fair hair"). Appointed in 1634, he had had a successful career in administration, where he had distinguished himself through services in the sphere of construction, including road building projects undertaken for 'Abbas I in Mazandaran and the rebuilding of the sanctuary of Najaf on the orders of Safi I, and through his activity as vizier of Mazandaran and of the whole of Gllan after the rising stirred up there by Gharib
Shah.1 Sarii Taqi, who held office as grand vizier until the death of Safi and for as long as three years afterwards, was not only an experienced specialist in administration but also a person of integrity, incorruptible and not at all intent on personal financial advantage. He so won the support and goodwill of the shah that he was able to get his way with all the authorities, in earlier years even including the military aristocracy. Efficient administrative measures, especially in finance, enabled him to raise revenues to a level never before known in Iran. He did indeed make use of a secret information service to this end, the

SAFI I
activities of which, while it may have increased his popularity in some quarters, had quite the reverse effect elsewhere. In the course of time, moreover, he became so hardened and implacable, and so given to autocratic behaviour and contempt for others, that he not only played into the hands of his opponents but sometimes even offended against the interests of the state. Thus in 1638 his misplaced reluctance to compromise gave the impetus to the loss of Qandahar, when he insisted on withdrawing certain privileges in the payment of annual contributions to the Grand Divan from the local governor, 'All Mardan Khan, which had been granted by his predecessors. Instead of obeying the summons to appear at court, the governor proceeded to place himself and his province under the jurisdiction of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.
This brings us to the question of Iran's foreign relations under Safi I. Even under normal circumstances a change of ruler in the Safavid empire always touched off increased interest and, all too easily, covetous aspirations among neighbouring powers. Since Shah Safi revealed himself only too soon as a weak, insecure and impressionable character, his neighbours lost no time in making appropriate moves. In the reign of Shah Safi hostilities started up on the frontiers with the Ottoman empire, in Georgia, with the Uzbeks and with India, and these resulted in territorial losses or at all events in the necessity for counter-measures. The fact that Iran escaped fairly lightly is hardly attributable to its ruler, but was due rather to other circumstances. The first disorders that occurred after the death of Shah 'Abbas were incursions on the part of Bedouin Arabs of the Banu Lam tribe into the area around Baghdad. These, however, had no significant effect upon the destinies of Iran; and even various conflicts among the Musha'sha' in the area of Havlza (Huvaiza), a tribe subject to the shah, which broke out after the murder of the governor of Shlraz, Imam Qull Khan, had no particularly momentous consequences. This was because 'All Pasha, the independent Turkish governor of Basra, who might have caused difficulties, was shrewd enough to avoid any involvement in these disputes. Grave news, however, was arriving in Isfahan from the west, where under the young Sultan Murad IV (1032-49/1623-40) an enterprising and ruthless grand vizier had come to power in the person of Khiisrev Pasha. The object of his planning was clearly to exploit the
283



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
easement achieved as a result of the renewal of the Peace of Szony recently negotiated between the Porte and the Emperor Ferdinand II by mounting a blow against Persia. At the news of his approach in the summer of 1038-9/1629, the Persians did not find themselves unprepared. Zainal Khan Begdell Shamlu, the newly appointed commanderin-chief, moved at the head of the Persian forces to Hamadan, where the shah was also encamped with his court. Khiisrev Pasha, who had temporarily given up his original objective, Baghdad, and had advanced in the direction of Hamadan, scored a victory on 4 May 1630 at Mahldasht. Though Hamadan then fell into his hands, he resisted the temptation to press on further into the interior of Persia and turned his attention to his real objective, Mesopotamia and Baghdad. As the Baghdad contingent under SafI Qull Khan held out against the Ottoman assault following heavy artillery bombardment, Khiisrev Pasha regarded the venture as a failure, and withdrew. It seems likely that his decision was prompted in part by the thought of the approaching winter — the attack took place between 8 and 12 November 1630 and no doubt by the associated thought of how vulnerable his lines of communication to the rear would be, having regard to their length and particular geographical location. It proved not too difficult for the Persians to clear out the garrisons left behind by the Ottomans in the central part of the Euphrates region, and to bring to heel the Kurds, who had largely sided with the enemy. Although it at first looked as if peace could be brought about between the Ottomans and the Safavids, these hopes were destined to be dashed because the new Turkish Grand Vizier, Tabanyas'i Mehmed Pasha, observing the murder of the
Persian princes and the Georgian resistance to the shah,1 did not regard Persia as a dangerous enemy and had no interest in concluding a peace. Hence the next four years saw no end to frontier skirmishes in which the initiative and the outcome alternated from one side to the other constantly. The Ottoman conquest of the fortress of Erivan in 1045/163 5, at which the Sultan Murad IV was present in person, was a more serious matter. So was the subsequent advance on Tabriz, which was plundered and laid in ruins, but not occupied. Shah SafI himself took part in the Persian counter-offensive in the following spring, which ended
1 See below, pp. 285—6.

SAFI I
with the reconquest of Erivan. Overtures of peace made by the Persians immediately afterwards were once more unavailing. The reason for the Supreme Porte's reluctance to make peace was no doubt that Istanbul had not given up the idea of reconquering Baghdad. In fact, in 1048/1638 the sultan again undertook a campaign into Mesopotamia, by means of which he achieved the desired result, for Baghdad fell into his hands in mid-Sha'ban/the closing days of December without the Persians making any attempt to relieve their garrison in the city. From then until the First World War the city remained an Ottoman possession.
In spite of the atrocities that followed the conquest, the Persians entered into peace negotiations with the Ottomans. These resulted, on
14 Muharram 1049/17 May 1639 *n t n e P e a c e treaty of Zuhab, as a consequence of which a settlement of frontiers was agreed that survived beyond the end of the Safavid empire and — apart from the northern sector, where a new situation was created by the advance of the Tsarist empire in the 12th/18th century — endured up to the present time. For Persia, it meant not only the loss of Baghdad, but also the final abandonment of the whole of Mesopotamia. Both parties abided by the terms of the treaty, and after this no more wars were fought between the Safavids and the Ottomans.
Nor were there any serious consequences from conflicts in the Transcaucasian petty states, especially the Georgian kingdoms and principalities, where Safavid and Ottoman interests overlapped. It will be remembered that Shah 'Abbas I had not only undertaken campaigns of conquest into Georgia, but had transplanted very large numbers of Georgians to Persia, where many of them, in connection with the reorganisation of the army, were taken into the Iranian forces and not infrequently rose to the higher and even to the highest military and governmental positions. Stubbornly though the Georgians clung to their own national ways in their homeland, even under Muslim rule, to their language, and to their Christian faith especially, in Persia they were quickly assimilated and, alongside Iranians and Turks, formed the third ethnic element of modern Persian society. In this they contrasted markedly with their Armenian neighbours, whose treatment under Persian tutelage was entirely comparable.
Shah Safi's relations with Georgia have already been touched on in the context of the transfer of the governor of Isfahan, Rustam Khan. He held to the Islamic faith and had made his entire career in Persia up

to this point; but in 1634 he succeeded in defeating Theimuraz and seizing power in Tiflis in the name of the shah. His success determined the lords of Imeretia, Mingrelia and Guria, who strictly owed allegiance to the Ottoman state and its ruler, to declare their willingness to accept the shah's authority. Even Theimuraz, who at first disappeared from the scene, but later managed to oust the Safavid governor of Kakhetia, finally placed himself under the Isfahan government, which confirmed his rule over Kakhetia - clearly in order thus to create a rival to Rustam and prevent his gaining excessive power. Conflicts between the two viceroys, Rustam and Theimuraz, were not slow to develop, but did not assume very serious proportions. Thus Rustam Khan, who remained in office until his death in 1658, was able to give his country a long period of peace and reconstruction, of which it was sorely in need after the serious devastations and losses of population resulting from the campaigns of Shah 'Abbas I. The exportation of Georgians to Persia, especially boys and girls, continued throughout the nth/17th century, but it was no longer in the form of official, obligatory requisitions or forced deportations, as had formerly been the case, but was arranged by agents, who tackled the problem by
means of bribes, persuasion, and cunning.1 There was more serious unrest on Iran's north-east frontier. A reconciliation was effected with the neighbouring Tiirkmens after they had invaded from Khiva (Khwarazm), when its Yadgarid ruler Isfandiyar Khan (1032-52/1623-42) apologised for the attack and in 1039/1630 handed over to the shah his brother Abu'l-Ghazi, on whose shoulders he put the blame. Abu'l-Ghazi, later Isfandiyar's successor and a celebrated historian, spent the next ten years at the shah's court. In contrast, the Uzbeks of Transoxiana, now under the rule of the Janid dynasty, kept the Persians fully occupied. The most important
figures here were Imam- Qull Khan, the prince of Bukhara (1020—5 II 1611-41), and his brother Nadr Muhammad Khan, who was initially his governor in Balkh and was appointed by him as his successor in 1051/1641 when he himself had gone blind. Imam Qull Khan set off on a pilgrimage to Mecca and only just managed to escape into Persian territory from pursuers sent after him on the orders of his brother, who at the last moment had resolved to prevent his leaving. He was received

there by the shah with the highest honours due to an eminent guest, and finally died in Arabian territory. Strangely enough, Nadr Muhammad Khan in turn at a later date (105 6/1646) had to seek refuge in Persia, and he too was received with great ceremony. Nevertheless, it would be quite wrong, on the evidence of the reception accorded by Safavid rulers to Uzbek princes in difficulties, to conclude that good neighbourly relations existed between the two powers. The opposite was, in fact, the case. As they had from the very beginning of Safavid rule, Uzbek incursions and plundering raids into Persia continued unabated during the nth/17th century, and in the reign of Shah SafI they reached a climax, with no fewer than eleven Uzbek campaigns against Persia. Even though most of these were no more than forays, we find that such large forces were involved — numbers amounting to 20,000 or 30,000 Uzbek warriors are mentioned — that the possibility that the Uzbeks intended a conquest of Khurasan cannot simply be dismissed. Nevertheless, no significant results in this direction were achieved. The tense relations between Shah SafI and the Indian Mughals led, among other reasons, in 1636 to the severance of a strange IndoPersian connection. 'Abd-Allah Qutb Shah, the lord of the principality of Golkonda in the Deccan (1020-1083/1626-72), and the descendant
of a Shi'I Qara Quyunlu refugee,1 had attached himself for religious reasons to Shah 'Abbas I and thereafter had caused the name of the Persian shah to be incorporated in the official prayers (khutba) and adopted on the coinage. He now abandoned his association with Persia and placed himself under the Great Mughal Shah Jahan after the latter's victory over his neighbour to the west, the prince of Bljapur.
When Shah SafI died unexpectedly on 12 Safar 1052/12 May 16422 at the early age of thirty-one, he left behind him a country whose territory was quite considerably smaller than it had been at his succession, but which still embraced all the heartlands of Persia. From the point of view of the Iranicisation of the Safavid empire, the loss of the Mesopotamian territories — and these were by far the most extensive was in any case of no very great importance. More significant was the fact that at the time of his death the country was not threatened by any serious external dangers, and especially that it was no longer at risk

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
from the Ottoman empire. This fairly positive state of affairs, however, could hardly be credited to Shah SafI, but rather to various dignitaries in his empire distinguished by special competence, particularly the Grand Vizier Sam Taqi. In Safl's character we see clearly manifested some of the weak points in the structure of the Safavid empire which were to play a fateful role in its decline and final demise. These were especially the lack of preparation of the crown prince for the position of ruler and the unlimited power of a despotic monarch totally orientated on himself, and — since the time of Shah 'Abbas I — further strengthened by the exclusion of the Qizilbash amirs and the increasing centralisation of the state. A figure possessing the personal qualities of a Shah 'Abbas could exploit such a position of omnipotence to the best advantage of Iran and its people. A man as weak as SafI in mind and character — a man who was also physically weak — was not equal to the tasks involved in the office.
ABBAS II
Though SafI cannot be compared with his grandfather 'Abbas in any respect, it is not proper to speak of the thirteen years of his reign as the beginning of the decline of Safavid power. It is true that the Safavid state at this time shows signs of ageing and also gives certain indications of decadence. But that it was still able to survive and guarantee its subjects good, if not outstandingly good, conditions in which to live, was evident under Safl's son and successor, Prince Sultan Muhammad Mlrza, who ascended the throne on 16 Safar 1052/15 May 1642 with the name 'Abbas II. Certainly there could be no question, to begin with, of his influencing the affairs of state, since the new shah was not
quite ten years old at the time.1 Since Saru TaqI remained in office as grand vizier, it was inevitable that his should be the authoritative voice in government. Less self-evident was the part the queen mother played in state affairs. In the case in question, the practicalities of carrying out joint rule were in fact fairly simple, because the grand vizier was a eunuch, so that he was not subject to the usual prohibitions on access to the ladies of the court. If there had been indications under the rule of Shah SafI that the

ABBAS II
shift in power from the Turkmen tribal leaders to the shah and the tight centralisation that 'Abbas I had carried through would become a permanency, this now became clearer still. The grandees of the empire (arkan-i daulat), who were no longer dependent on or challenged by the Qizilbash aristocracy, now looked simply to the ruler. Indeed to such an extent was this so that the latter, if ever he should be unwilling to take action or if he should be as yet not of age to rule, could be represented for years by an efficient chancellor of the imperial court or grand vizier without such persons needing - as MIrza Salman Jabirl had once needed - to fear the intrigues of the Turkmen military. This is far from saying that he was proof against the conspiratorial activities of other members of the court, especially the palace eunuchs and the ladies of the harem. Even though the ruler still possessed supernatural powers in the estimation of his subjects, his role as master of the order now no longer had any practical significance. Perversions of what remained of this role, his alleged incapacity for doing any wrong (so that religious commandments and prohibitions did not apply to him), could have fateful results. The observances that derived from the rule of the order had been replaced by an ingeniously devised court ceremonial which is described in much detail by European observers living in Isfahan at the time. When the Turkmen military aristocracy was stripped of power, the role of the provinces as epicentres of central government was — as we have seen — reduced almost to nothing. There were among the leading figures of the empire, the incumbents of high office in the court, still some Turkmen tribal princes, but they had no significant power to fall back on in the provinces; they had to be content with fairly small governorships which might be associated with the court offices for which they were responsible. They no longer derived their influence from the fact that they belonged to particular tribes or from the economic power of their office in the provinces, but — like all other servants of the court, such as Georgians, Armenians or Circassians from the favour of the ruler and, at times, of the grand vizier, largely depending on the degree of loyalty and competence they had shown. All in all, these are the typical characteristics of a court aristocracy. A significant aspect of the situation was that the court offices, which in the ioth/i6th century had been largely only titular, now increasingly entailed specific functions, which on the one hand made their incumbents, i.e. the leading men in the empire, into pillars of the state
289



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
(arkan-i daulat), and on the other invested them at particular times with considerable influence. Although it is not intended here to examine the details of the Safavid governmental apparatus, it is worth casting a brief glance at the top echelons of the empire at the time of the new shah's accession. The ruler held solemn court at unspecified intervals for particular purposes. At these, affairs of state were discussed, ambassadors of foreign powers were received, and the conferment of offices announced. One noteworthy additional authority was the court and imperial council, one of whose functions was to supervise the work of governors and senior officials. Since it was responsible for enquiring into complaints from the population about abuses of authority, oppression and arbitrary government, there may well have been some connection with the divan al-mat^alim of earlier times. Any verdict it announced led to sentence being passed by the shah, who also had the right to exercise direct judicial power. Among the members of the court and imperial council the grand vizier and the commander of the mounted guard (qurchl-bashl) occupied the first place. In addition, the commanders of the royal squires (qullar-aqasl), of the musketeers (tufangchl-aqasi) and of the artillery corps (tupchl-bashl) belonged to it, as did the dlvan-begl, the state privy clerk [vdqi'a-nivis), the lord marshal (ishlk-aqasl-bashl), and sometimes the imperial sadr {sadr al-mamalik). At the head of the financial administration, with partial responsibility for administering crown lands, was the imperial director of finances {mustaufi al-mamalik). Court administration was under the care of a supreme major-domo or intendant-general {na%tr-i buyiitaf), who also had charge of the court workshops. The Persian army, once the nucleus of Safavid power, had been weakened as a result of the tribal particularism and insubordination of the Qizilbash amirs, but reformed both radically and effectively by Shah 'Abbas I to represent a powerful striking force. Under Shah Safi, in spite of the decimation of the generals, it had nevertheless so far contrived to preserve its strength that in 105 8/164.8 it proved itself a force to be reckoned with against the Indian invasion troops during the conflict over Qandahar. But quite soon afterwards the changed political situation began to take effect. The dangers which earlier on had threatened the existence of the state or its territorial integrity had either been averted or were no longer so menacing that they demanded
290



ABBAS II
trained troops in a constant high degree of readiness and in great numbers. As the government was no longer pursuing a policy of expansion, its military undertakings were confined to fairly small-scale punitive expeditions within the country or on the frontiers. The decline was first evident among the provincial contingents and not as yet among the main body of the royal army, which in 1654 was in fact increased by a small corps of bodyguard infantry, theja^a'irt, consisting of 600 men to begin with, a number later increased to 2,000 men. The falling-off became plain among the artillery, which was the force least needed in long periods of peace and which had never been especially popular among the Persians with their marked preference for
cavalry.1 As time went on, the typical extravagance, luxurious living and idleness of the court did not fail to have a demoralising effect on the royal troops. Corruption in the intendant's office, inadequate provision for the lower ranks, casualness and neglect became the order of the day, and the shah's lack of interest added the finishing touches. Thus it was possible for it to happen that, in 1666, at a parade of troops, the same soldiers were marched past the shah several times over. The result of such abuses was that discipline disintegrated and the strength of units was allowed to fall, so that it was eventually said of the army that it was quite useful for military parades but no use at all for war.
Such, then, were the instruments of power available for the government of Iran when the new shah ascended the throne. If his personal share in the affairs of state was still confined for the time being to representative functions only, he nevertheless learned to make it more effective a few years later. To begin with, he had to catch up on the education he had been denied hitherto; and he made such good progress in reading and writing that it was soon possible to introduce him to religious texts. The foundations of his lifelong interest in theological questions may well have been laid at this time, and this interest may have provided the stimulus for a new Persian translation of al-KulInl's Usu/ al-kdjift 'Urn al-dtn, the most important of the four books of the ShI'i tradition. In addition to his intellectual training, which was not

291



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
confined merely to religious subjects, the shah also learned riding, archery, polo and other equestrian games. Meanwhile, the real power lay in the hands of the trusted Grand Vizier Saru TaqI, who did not shut himself off from the influence of the queen mother. He also willingly carried out ideas put forward by the Shl'I jurists, who were deeply concerned to eradicate the excesses of Shah Safi's reign that ran counter to the law. These included the tendency to wild extravagance at court and, in imitation of it, in the provincial capitals. The grand vizier insisted on the principle of economy and was able to curb the excessive drinking at court. However, the successes he achieved were not destined to last long, as in this respect 'Abbas II later followed in his father's footsteps. After the accession had been carried through smoothly there were more important concerns to worry about than the lax observance of the religious law at court. Experience taught that the fluid situation created by a change of ruler meant a challenge for discontented elements, power-hungry individuals, and centrifugal forces. Saru TaqI met the new dangers with the classic ploys of generous tax concessions for the provinces and by confirming almost all of the highly-placed officials at the court and in the provinces. This policy had the desired effect. There were no disturbances or revolts when the change of ruler took place - with one exception. This was the trial of strength with the imperial field-marshal (sipahsalar) Rustam Khan. He opposed the order to remain in Mashhad on account of the threat from Indian troops, having gone there to prepare a campaign, already planned but later abandoned, against Qandahar. He now set off" for Isfahan, clearly with the intention of bringing pressure to bear on state policy with the change of ruler. The grand vizier reacted to this act of insubordination by promptly arranging for sentence of death to be passed on him. This was carried out in Mashhad on 9 Dhu'l-Hijja 105 2/1 March 1643. "Lord of the amirs, servant of the poor", boasted Saru TaqI in an inscription of 1053/1643 recording his foundation of a mosque he
caused to be erected in Isfahan.1 The death of Rustam Khan is not the only case in which he held to this principle. Integrity and incorruptibility were among the virtues for which he is remembered, and to which we have already referred. These alone made him many enemies. A compulsive urge to dominate, a contempt for people and the implac

able severity with which he proceeded against crooked dealings in the management of state affairs, and especially the system of spies employed in the collection of state taxes — each played its own part in increasing the number of people opposed to the grand vizier, who in any case does not seem to have been particularly popular even among the highest dignitaries in the land. Not surprisingly, a plot was hatched against him, led by JanI Khan Shamlu, the qurchl-bashl, who with five other conspirators attacked and murdered him in his home on 20 Sha'ban 105 5/11 October 1645.
It was by no means certain whether what lay behind the murder was only the pent-up resentment of a fairly small group of officers or possibly — and perhaps more probably — a more ramified conspiracy of Turkmen tribal chieftains, such as those which may still have been remembered from the remote period of the Qizilbash conspiracies, aimed perhaps at dethroning the shah in favour of another prince. The crime was consequently followed by a period of some days in which bewilderment and confusion swept the court. Not until various senior officers and other dignitaries manifested their loyalty did the shah issue the order to proceed against the murderers and have them and their supporters put to death. It was again a Shamlu amir, Murtaza Qull Khan Bljarlu, who was appointed to the position of qurchl-bashl. He occupied this office for four years and his place was then taken by Husain Qull Khan.
Sarii Taql's successor was Khalifa Sultan, who had been grand vizier once before, from 1623 to 1632, and now remained in office until his death (1064/1653—4). Shah SafI had had four of his sons blinded at the time of the persecution of the princes. He was a pious man, concerned to see respect paid to the religious law, though his successes in this direction were at best only limited. It would seem that what he was able to achieve in the matter of prohibiting visual representation — in view of the many examples of portraiture and especially of miniature painting at the time — was just as modest as in the matter of drinking, which was a widespread habit, particularly at court, and could be suppressed only occasionally by imposing sharp penalties. It is well known that he made an effort to curb pederasty and to reduce prostitution by measures taken against the brothels that existed in many of the towns. In spite of his zeal in these directions, he seems on the whole in welcome contrast to the severity, abruptness, and overbearing ways of his predecessor - to have been a conciliatory character, disposed to
293



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
make allowances. Nevertheless, he was not without rivals at court. Since 1644 AllahvardI Khan, the son of the Armenian Khusrau Khan, had been master of the hunt (amtr-shikar-basht). He was hardly less successful in securing the favour of the ruler than his namesake of earlier days with Shah 'Abbas I. He can be seen as almost the ideal embodiment of the courtier, and in his strategy as such he exploited especially the shah's passion for hunting. His brilliantly arranged battues secured him the shah's affection and indeed also bore testimony to the organisational skills which brought him the office of qullar-aqasl when this position fell vacant; he held it until his death {c. 1663). This high position, together with the unwavering goodwill of the shah, made it possible for him to manoeuvre one of his proteges into the position of grand vizier when Khalifa Sultan died. This was Muhammad Beg, a Tabriz Armenian of modest origins, who up to that time had been intendant-general of the court (nazir-i buyutat) and had made a name as an efficient administrative and financial specialist. The problems he was required to solve, however, were beyond his capabilities. He did not succeed in reducing the immoderate outlay on the court and the high military expenditure as the situation demanded, not even by taking the necessary measures to reduce the quality of the coinage, attempting to foster mining, and further increasing the crown lands. His high-handed manner, his dismissal of several governors, and the disputes he was involved in with the Isfahan city administration created many enemies for him, among them some very influential people. When he finally became involved even in differences with the powerful AllahvardI Khan, he was removed from office and compelled to take up permanent abode in Qum (18 Jumada I 1071/19 January 1661). The shah did not hurry to appoint his successor. The fact that ultimately Mlrza Muhammad Mahdl, scion of a highly respected family of theologians, who had been sadr-i mamalik for over ten years, was made grand vizier, may have been a concession to the Shl'I jurists. Trouble had been fermenting in their ranks for a long time, not only on account of the libertarianism at court (the stricter discipline introduced after SafI's death, with prohibition of wine and strict adherence to the other religious prescripts, had long since been allowed to go by the board), but also because of the magnanimity of the ruler towards Christians, and Christians only recently converted to Islam, who were able to attain to high office, indeed to the highest offices in the land.
294



ABBAS II
In contrast to his predecessor, 'Abbas II took an active interest in the business of government, although he too had been raised in the seclusion of the harem and had received no preparation whatsoever for the throne. Exactly when he began to play an active role is impossible to determine, but it appears to have been at quite an early age, possibly in the period immediately following the assassination of Saru TaqI, when he was scarcely more than fifteen years old. A distinctive feature of his reign was the consolidation of his power, which he achieved by pursuing policies of centralisation such as increasing the number of provinces belonging to the royal estates. In this respect he adhered firmly to the policy of Sarii TaqI who, under Shah SafI, had already incorporated the province of Lar into the crown lands and who, only a year before his death, had also annexed the land of the Bakhtiyar, in consequence of a revolt against the local governor KhalU Khan. Subsequently other territories such as Hamadan (1654), Ardabil (1656—7) and Kirman (1658) were also incorporated in the royal estates. The increased revenues and the greater power of the monarch resulting from these measures did not necessarily make for an improvement in the lot of the population. In certain instances they even proved detrimental, because the administrators of the crown lands, as the immediate subordinates of the shah, were frequently in a position to disregard constraints to which the former governors had been subject. On the other hand, it was not unknown for the shah to intervene against his provincial officials on receiving complaints from peasants or other of his subjects that they had been dealt with too harshly. This explains why European observers are able to contrast the well-being of the rural population in Persia with the very much worse plight of the peasantry in the West. The relatively favourable living conditions, also of course attributable to the fact that Persia was spared any serious involvement in major wars during this period, in turn help to explain why, for most of the time, the country remained peaceful internally and the roads were safe. When disorders and rebellions did develop they were confined, like the uprising of the Bakhtiyars mentioned above, to border areas or vassal territories. This was the case with various dominions in Georgia and Daghistan which were either under Persian tutelage or loosely subject to the shah. Reference has already been made to Rustam Khan, who ruled as governor or viceroy (vail) in Tiflis, and to conflicts between him and Theimuraz. These conflicts continued under 'Abbas II, in the first instance

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
shortly after his accession, then again in 1648. Even though Theimuraz was eventually excluded from power and sent to Astarabad, fresh disturbances occurred, despite — or even because of — an attempt to restore peace by means of a special policy of colonisation and construction of fortresses, directed from Isfahan. Hostilities bordering on civil war were not brought to a conclusion until the beginning of the 1070s/1660s under a new viceroy called Shahnavaz. Theimuraz himself, albeit in vain, had sought support from the government of the Tsar. His efforts were certainly not misplaced, for Cossacks had advanced as far as the river Terek around the year 1600. When, however, they proceeded to build fortifications commanding the approach routes to eastern Georgia, Persian troops were sent into action who destroyed their strongholds and put the garrisons to flight. To guard against renewed incursions by the Russians, or those of the Ottomans, any rebellions on the part of the princes of Daghistan were quelled. No account of the development of domestic politics under 'Abbas II would be complete without a brief consideration of Western trading companies and their activities in Persia, although a later chapter will be devoted to a detailed discussion of this topic. By the beginning of the i ith/iyth century, at the latest, these companies had become a significant factor not only in Persian history but also in the overseas history of various European powers, i.e. in the development of what nowadays would be termed Western imperialism and colonialism. We have already touched on the expulsion of the Portuguese with the aid of the English, who aimed at establishing secure trade relations with
Persia.1 Other European powers now endeavoured in much the same way to forge economic links with Iran and to set up suitable trade bases in the country. Portugal had still been granted minor rights by the shah in a treaty of 1625, but when Muscat was conquered by the imam of 'Uman in 1060/16 50, she lost her foothold in the Persian Gulf and with it, simultaneously, her final opportunity for influence in Persia. It would, however, be quite wrong to conclude from their relations with the Portuguese that the rulers of Persia were in principle opposed to foreign trade delegations. They were in fact only too well aware of the benefits the country derived from the presence of Western trade representa

tives. These benefits were not confined solely to the economic sphere. Just how diverse they were can be gauged from two examples: the deployment of English ships in support of the Persian government, for instance, during the expulsion of the Portuguese, and the influence of Western art on that of Persia, which is of particular interest in view of the artistic inclinations of Shah 'Abbas II. The English East India Company had been represented in Shiraz and Isfahan since 1617. Later, in gratitude for the assistance it had given against the Portuguese, it was granted significant privileges by 'Abbas I and Safi I, for example, a customs franchise in Bandar 'Abbas (Gombroon), which had replaced the Portuguese Hurmuz; representation by a permanent ambassador at the court; a guarantee of free trade throughout the country; independent legal authority; freedom of worship; the right to carry arms, and the pledge of greater supplies of silk. Despite all this it would be wrong to conceive of the activity of the company as being outstandingly successful. More often than not it encountered difficulties when seeking to exercise its privileges, and not infrequently it was obliged to relinquish them altogether. Moreover, the role of the company was dependent upon the prestige that the English homeland, about which they were quite well informed, enjoyed amongst the Persians; and this, particularly since the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642, was not exactly high. Not many years after the English, the Dutch had also founded a settlement in Bandar 'Abbas. The Dutch East India Company was more successful in defending its interests than its English rival because, unlike the latter, it could count on the support of its government and also enjoyed greater freedom to act on its own authority. The privileges conceded to it by 'Abbas I were endorsed by the governments of both SafI and 'Abbas II, though in the latter case not before drastic pressure had been brought to bear by sending a Dutch fleet from Batavia to the
Persian Gulf.1 The principal Dutch imports to Persia were spices, sugar and textiles. They purchased various silks, such as brocade, taffeta, velvet and satin, in addition to raw silk. A trade agreement remained in force until the end of the dynasty, but from time to time it proved damaging or problematical to one or other of the parties as the result of a stipulation obliging the Dutch to take agreed quantities of Persian silk at a fixed price, which proved ruinous for them.

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
French attempts to establish trade relations with the shah led to agreements, the contents of which were sanctioned by 'Abbas II in a farman issued shortly before his death, but for the time being nothing came of them in practice. Apart from the exchange of goods they facilitated, the activities of the Western trading companies contributed to a certain opening up of Iran towards the West. The companies brought large numbers of Europeans to Persia, amongst them men of great acumen and intellectual curiosity who made it their ambition to really get to know the country and its inhabitants in depth, men who recorded their observations and experiences and subsequently published them. Reports of this nature not only provided the contemporary Western world with reliable information on Persia, but constitute to this day indispensable source-material for certain areas of study. Through the agency of the trading companies, for instance by using their ships, Persian merchants also visited European countries and were able to inform themselves of cultural conditions there. Western ideas reached Persia, where their influence is clearly discernible, if not so much on intellectual life, then certainly in the field of art and in the increasing refinement of Persian culture.
In discussing the European trading companies we have already moved to the subject of external relations, which were, as has already been indicated, predominantly peaceful in the reign of 'Abbas II. The treaty of 1049/1639 proved a reliable basis for relations with the Ottomans. In other respects the judicious restraint of the shah paid dividends. He was not tempted by such favourable opportunities to expand his territory as arose, for instance, in Transcaucasia, where the risk of war was so acute that the governor of the Turkish border provinces had even evacuated the civilian population in expectation of a Persian attack, or in Basra, where the shah's aid had been sought to settle a struggle for the succession. Under these circumstances no danger threatened from the Ottomans, whether because the Porte was pursuing interests elsewhere - the conquest of Crete occurs in the period 105 5-80/1645-69 or because their desire for expansion was counterbalanced by considerable difficulties at home. A significant indication of the peaceful nature of relations between Persia and the Ottomans is the exchange of a number of legations. Nor did any threat to peace emerge from the north-east, where in

ABBAS II
Khiva a new ruler had ascended the throne in the same year as 'Abbas II. This was Abu'l-GhazI Khan, whom we have previously encountered as an exile in Isfahan. On the other hand, Persia was drawn into conflicts which arose amongst the Uzbeks of Bukhara. Here we have in mind not those incursions by nomadic Uzbek tribes which did occasionally still occur, though no longer as frequently or on so large a scale as under Shah SafI, but rather conflicts within the ruling dynasty. Just as Imam Qull Khan had in his day arrived in Isfahan as a refugee from his brother Nadr Muhammad Khan, so now this selfsame prince appeared seeking help at the Persian court after being banished from the throne by his son 'Abd al-'Aziz and having, if anything, further exacerbated the situation by asking the Great Mughal for military support. With Persian cooperation a settlement was arrived at between father and son, but it lasted only until the beginning of the fifties. The renewed strife, which had again led Nadr Muhammad Khan to
announce his arrival in Isfahan, was resolved by the latter's death.1 From then on Persia seems to have had no further difficulties of any great significance with her Uzbek neighbours.
Nadr Muhammad Khan's request for aid had reached Shah Jahan as he was beginning preparations for an attack on Transoxiana with the initial aim of securing the approach route across the Hindu Kush, across Badakhshan and Balkh, a situation of which the khan of Bukhara was completely unaware. Small wonder, then, that the Indian troops for whose support he was hoping had no other aim in mind than the annexation of his country. The Great Mughals, a Timurid dynasty, had consistently regarded the conquest and occupation of Central Asia as a hereditary commitment handed down from generation to generation, the legacy of their founder Zahir al-Dln Babur, who, it will be recalled, had refused to give up the idea of a return to Samarqand even when it was a practical impossibility.
The Indian advance on Central Asia eventually ended in catastrophe. In Isfahan this led to a revival of the old plan to reconquer Qandahar which had had to be abandoned on the death of Shah SafI. In the autumn of 105 8/1648 the shah moved troops, supported by artillery, into Afghanistan and succeeded in conquering Qandahar and the fortresses of the surrounding district before the arrival on the scene of an
1 Braun, Das Erbe Schah 'Abbas' 1, p. 62, dates this crisis in 1653. According to Luft, Iran tmter Schah 'Abbas II, p. 140, Nadr Muhammad abdicated in 1650 and died later that year in Bistam while undertaking a pilgrimage to Mecca.

Indian relief force under the command of Prince Aurangzlb. A counterattack by the Indians proved ineffectual and had to be abandoned. Even when, two years later, Shah Jahan himself advanced at the head of an army with elephants and cannon, victory was denied him, despite a siege which lasted ten weeks. The Crown Prince Dara Shukuh, who tried his luck in 1653, also failed. His attack was repulsed by Autar Khan, who, as a former member of a diplomatic mission to the country, was well versed in Indian affairs and now turned his experience to account as the shah's governor. Despite all efforts on the part of India, Qandahar remained in Persian hands even after the Safavid dynasty had come to an end, until the middle of the 12th/18th century, when it became a part of the emerging independent state of Afghanistan. The illness of Shah Jahan in Dhu'l-Qa'da 1067/September 1657 gave rise to a war of succession among his sons, of whom Prince Dara Shukuh attempted to gain military support for his cause from the shah. It may well be the case that some form of intervention was contemplated in Isfahan, for a smallish contingent of troops was detailed for this purpose. However, no measures of great significance were taken and the prince eventually fell into the hands of his brother Aurangzlb, who had him executed in 1069/165 9. It is possible that the prompt
despatch of troops from Qandahar might have saved him.1 In the course of his struggle for power, in 1065/165 5 and 1067/165 7 respectively, Aurangzlb sent troops into the Deccan states of Golkonda and Bljapur, both of which had previously been under Persian suzerainty. He allowed them, however, to retain a certain measure of independence and it is possible that in view of this the authorities in Isfahan conceived the idea of playing off the Shl'I princes of these states against the new Mughal emperor, himself a declared Sunnl. The sending of a Persian ambassador to the states would appear to support this conjecture. If it is correct, however, the shah must very quickly have convinced himself of the futility of such a scheme, for only a short time after the coronation of Aurangzlb, he resolved to recognise the Mughal's sovereign authority. Aurangzlb, whose position was still precarious, appears to have received this information with some sense of relief. If the shah's decision was motivated by concern for the security of Qandahar, he was to be disappointed, for when ambassadors were exchanged it transpired that the Indian monarch by no

means considered this particular question closed. Subsequently tensions between Persia and India increased to such an extent that the shah, even in his last days, when he was suffering from the illness which eventually killed him, was making preparations for a campaign against India. It was not, however, destined to be carried out.
A dominant feature of the reign of 'Abbas II is the indefatigable concern he personally showed for the affairs of state. This did not change even when, in 1073/ at the end of 1662, he displayed the first symptoms of what was to prove a long and painful illness, although his reactions to irregularities and maladministration on the part of individual dignitaries and officials became, from this point onwards, more severe and violent than in previous years. Executions for reasons of this nature were no longer a rarity. When a deterioration in the condition of the shah, who according to the descriptions of European reporters was
probably suffering from syphilis,1 forced him to recuperate in Mazandaran, he still retained sufficient energy to take charge of state business even from there. At the age of thirty-three, in the autumn of 1077/1666, probably
during the night of 26 Rabi' II/25-6 October,2 'Abbas passed away in Khusrauabad, a small mountain castle between Damghan and Gurgan. His body was brought to Qum, where he was buried next to his father Safi. Not without reason is his name often mentioned in the same breath as those of Isma'Il I and 'Abbas I as the three outstanding ruling figures of the Safavids. Because he might otherwise have been just the man to prevent the downfall of the Safavid kingdom, there is no lack of expressions of regret at his untimely end, either in the primary sources, of which the accounts of Western visitors to Persia have the first if not the sole claim to credibility, or in the writings of historians. The validity of such speculation can best be judged by a consideration of his personality.
Surviving portraits show the shah to have been a finely proportioned young man of medium height with a longish face, sharply defined features and a wide, sweeping moustache of the kind fashion

able at the time.1 He was renowned for his skill in and enthusiasm for sporting activities such as riding and archery, as well as for his passionate interest in hunting. 'Abbas II adhered to the traditional conception of the divine kingship and sacred status of the Safavids and did not hesitate to dispute the views of those theologians who argued that until the return of the departed Imam, i.e. the Mahdl, temporal power belonged by right not to the Safavid shah but to the mujtahid of the time. On the other hand, he was concerned to foster good relations with the Shl'I jurists, which explains in part why he chose his sisters' husbands from amongst their number. He did so also, of course, with the ulterior motive of precluding any issue eligible for succession to the throne, an eventuality he would have had to face had his brothers-in-law been members of the ruling dynasty or eminent military figures in the realm. The desire to consolidate his own power, for decades the overriding concern of the Safavid monarchs, prompted 'Abbas II to have his nephews killed and his four brothers blinded. Nor was he content to follow the practice hitherto customary at the court, of rendering the cornea opaque, but ordered the actual removal of their eyeballs. This fear of potential rivals did not, however, extend to his own two sons, in spite of certain misgivings concerning them in court circles. A propensity to cruelty can also be discerned in certain directives issued when 'Abbas was in an inebriated condition. The prohibition imposed at the time of his accession by the Grand Vizier Saru Taqi and representatives of the religious classes had been shortlived, and excessive consumption of alcohol, just as in the days of his father, had again
become the order of the day at court. According to one chronicle,2 probably the only activity the young shah preferred to a bout of heavy drinking was watching a game of polo. Another passion he indulged was his love of the fair sex, and it would seem that his early death was not unconnected with his lack of restraint in this regard. Although such characteristics tarnish the image of the ruler somewhat, he was by no means lacking in conspicuously good qualities which earned the praise of native and foreign observers alike. Foremost amongst these was a pronounced love of justice. He would inter

vene quite ruthlessly whenever corruption or despotism, irregularities or malpractices came to his notice, irrespective of whether it was a question of the normal administration of justice or the surveillance of political and administrative bodies, both civil and military. He even went to the length of personally devoting several days a week to the administration of justice, amongst other things initiating measures to promote public safety and above all to suppress banditry and highway robbery. The energy and drive displayed by 'Abbas in this and other areas of public life led not only to the eradication of particular abuses which had crept in since the death of his great-grandfather, but also to an overall reform of Safavid politics as such. A clearer image of the ruler's personality emerges when one considers his attitude towards things spiritual, intellectual and artistic, something which has already been alluded to in passing. He valued the company of intellectuals and scholars as well as that of dervishes, on whom, incidentally, he lavished considerable sums. At court he would organise discussions and debates with them on topics chosen from their sphere of interest. On occasions, moreover, committed leaders of the faith such as his Grand Vizier Khalifa Sultan succeeded in inciting him in his religious zeal to attempt to convert the non-Islamic minorities of the realm. Whereas the Christians emerged relatively unscathed because they were not pursued with any great rigour or stringency, the fate of the Jews, above all the sizeable Jewish community in Isfahan, was much worse. All kinds of coercive measures and underhand practices were employed to convert them to Islam. Measures of this nature, however, seem only marginally to have affected the general climate of religious affairs under 'Abbas II, reliable accounts indicating as they do that, in contrast to other Islamic countries, religious discussions between Christians and Muslims were not merely permitted in Persia during this period, but actually took place frequently. Although the Islamic faith undoubtedly formed the undisputed basis of national and public life, there is ample evidence for the existence of liberal attitudes and, apart from the exceptions such as those just mentioned, the tolerance extolled by European observers of the time of'Abbas I seems to have reigned during this period also. This can be seen, for example, from cases in which the shah intervened against Islamic judges who in legal disputes between Christians and Muslims had unfairly favoured the latter. The ruler's attitude towards the fine arts shows him in a particularly
3°3



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
sympathetic light. There was admittedly a long tradition of artistic inclination and aesthetic sensibility among the Safavids, but in 'Abbas II, who was himself a practising artist, these qualities found quite outstanding expression. The painting of the time owes its charm not least to the traces of European and Indian influence detectable in it. These are the result not only of the increasing number of pictures which found their way to Persia from Europe and India but also of personal contacts between Persian artists and European and Indian masters. 'Abbas II is himself the best example of this trend. After gaining experience of skilled craft-work in his early youth, he later received lessons in painting too, from European as well as Persian teachers. The artistic interests of the ruler also extended to architecture and lengthy accounts of the buildings he erected in Isfahan are to be found in the sources. Apart from preservation and reconstruction work, however, no mention is made of the building of mosques, to which his great-grandfather owed his immortal renown as an architect. All the more significant and numerous, on the other hand, are his achievements in the field of secular architecture, such as caravansarais, bridges and palaces. Much that owed its inspiration to him has subsequently been destroyed, but to this day monuments have been preserved in the architecture of Isfahan which testify to his exquisite taste, such as, for instance, the most charming bridge Pul-i Khaju over the Zayandariid and above all the garden palace Chihil Sutun, which in its combination of architecture and painting gives some impression of the radiance that adorned the royal household and the festivities of the shah.
SAFI ri (SULAIMAN)
With the death of 'Abbas II, who for all his faults was a just and magnanimous - if not a liberal - monarch, Persia came once and for all to the end of a long period of peace and prosperity. Problems began to arise even on the question of the succession, for which the late shah had made no provision. Was the eldest son, the approximately nineteenyear-old Safi Mlrza to succeed his father in accordance with the established custom of the Safavids, even though he had not been on particularly good terms with 'Abbas? Or would the throne fall to his favourite son Hamza Mlrza, a mere seven-year-old? Despite initial support for Hamza MIrza's claim on the part of the Grand Vizier Mlrza

SAFI II (SULAIMAN)
Muhammad Mahdi, the leading figures of the realm, assembled where 'Abbas had died, decided in favour of the older prince's succession, merely on the basis of representations made to them by his personal tutor and confidant, the eunuch Mirza Aqa Mubarak. Subsequently
he ascended the throne on i November 1666 with the title SafI II.1 The new shah, the son of a Circassian slave called Naklhat Khanum, had been raised, according to what by now had become the firmly established custom, in the wives' quarters, that is in the sole company of the ladies of the harem and eunuchs, without the slightest preparation for the throne. He lacked not only experience and observation of the practice of government but also.those excellent human qualities his father had possessed, although he shared with the latter such vices as excessive drinking, cruelty, principally when under the influence of alcohol, and a tendency towards immoderate sexual indulgence. To a fondness for pomp and circumstance, evinced also by his father, came in addition an inordinate extravagance, at least in the early part of his reign. Later on, admittedly, he was to swing to the opposite extreme of avarice and covetousness, two qualities that remained with him until the end of his days. Engelbert Kaempfer, a German doctor, who lived in Isfahan in the years 1683-4, left behind an excellent account of the Safavid capital and of the administration of the court and coun
try, including also a character sketch of the shah.2 Alongside his more familiar faults and vices are listed irascibility, indolence and superstition, but a few good qualities also find mention: occasional acts of justice and clemency, piety, an unusual love of peace and winning social manners. Kaempfer testifies not only to the shah's kindheartedness but also to his popularity with his subjects. The very beginnings of SafI IPs rule in Iran were anything but encouraging. The news from Mazandaran of his father's death and his own appointment to the succession had found him, just like his grandfather before him, in a state of total unpreparedness. Never before having set foot outside the harem, he was seized with panic and responded to the invitation to appear in the throne room for his coronation only after a considerable show of reluctance, because he assumed that he was being lured there simply to be murdered or blinded. Shortly after he came to the throne, prices soared in the capital and
1 This and the second coronation are discussed in detail by Chardin, Le couronnement de Soleimaan Troisiime [sic], roy de Perse (Paris, 1671), an account also included in his Voyages ix and x.

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
there were outbreaks of famine and disease in the country. The province of Shirvan suffered a violent earthquake and in the following year the Caspian provinces had to endure the predatory raids of Stenka Razin's Cossacks, whom the Persian forces were unable to subdue. Since all was not well with the ruler's health either, presumably because of the dissolute life he led, one of the physicians who were striving in vain to cure him hit on the idea that all these misfortunes not only the shah's sickliness but all the untoward occurrences in the land — must stem from a miscalculation of the horoscope determining the date of his accession to the throne. It did not take long to find a court astrologer who confirmed this assumption, and the leading figures of the realm together with the shah duly concluded that the
remedy to the situation lay in repeating the ceremony of accession.1 A new horoscope indicated 20 March 1668, at nine o'clock in the morning, as the most propitious time. The second coronation, which was again observed in every ceremonial detail, was supposed to betoken a completely fresh start. Thus, on this occasion, the shah ascended the throne under a new name also, that of Shah Sulaiman, by
which he is known in history.2 However, neither the renewed accession to the throne nor the adoption of a new name by the sovereign made for an improvement in the fortunes of the Safavid kingdom. The ruler was simply not a man of substance. The qualities he had lacked previously - energy, courage, decisiveness, discipline, initiative and an eye for the national interest all these he subsequently proved incapable of acquiring. His fundamental indifference towards the tasks of government was reinforced, as before, by his fondness for alcohol and women. As the years went by, the respective grand viziers - initially MIrza Muhammad Mahdl, who had served under 'Abbas II, then after the latter's death (f.1673) the Kurd Shaikh 'All Zangana until 1690, and finally MIrza Muhammad Tahir Vahld Qazvlnl - were granted less and less frequently the morning audience with the shah which previously had been the custom. More and more he made the harem the focal point of his existence, and whilst there he was inaccessible even to his grand vizier. Thus it
1 On occasions one reads (cf. Stchoukine, Manuscrits Safavis, p. 3 2) that instead of SafT II a selfappointed "usurper" ascended the throne at this time so that he could be the victim of the evil fate ordained in the stars. This is possibly connected with ancient eastern ideas: cf. K. Hecker, Die Institution des Ersat^konigs im alien Zweistromland, probationary lecture in Freiburg, 9 Dec. 1970.

happened that, even when important decisions had to be made, the grand vizier was often left entirely to his own devices or, alternatively, the shah would discuss affairs of state with his wives and eunuchs and communicate through a servant of the harem any decision arrived at in this manner. Indeed, the shah even set up a privy council in the harem, to which the most important eunuchs belonged, a kind of private administration which effectively deprived the real organs of government, i.e. the council of State {divan) and the court assembly {majlis) as well as the grand vizier, of their functions. In practice state dignitaries were reduced to the level of mere executive organs of this privy council. Even when the shah condescended to participate in consultations outside the harem it was hardly ever possible to discuss in detail problems that had arisen, because he had neither the inclination nor the patience necessary to familiarise himself with the facts of a complex situation; and the leading figures of the realm had learned from bitter experience not to be too energetic in their efforts to arouse his interest. Sovereignty resided in the harem, where eunuchs, princesses and concubines intrigued constantly. The shah's indifference, bordering on apathy, with regard to questions of political administration inevitably gave rise to grave abuses. In the absence of any effective control or sanction against oppression and exploitation, corruption was rife. In the circumstances, the practice of bestowing favours, widespread in Persia, rapidly led to bribery in public life. Sinister developments in the armed forces, of which there had been indications even under 'Abbas II, now became widespread. Oblivious of their military duties, soldiers came to regard their pay as little more than a gratuity, in exchange for which no effort was required on their part. Some contingents, indeed, existed only on
paper.1
Shah Sulaiman ruled for twenty-eight years, until 1105/1694. To judge from the observations of European travellers, the royal household was maintained with a pomp and splendour no less lavish than that which characterised earlier Safavid rulers. One reads, for example, of excursions organised by the shah with his estimated eight hundred ladies of the harem. At the beginning of his reign these took place once or twice a week, bringing the activities of whole areas of the city to a standstill,

because all males, even boys and old men, were banned under penalty of death (quriiq) from the streets through which the royal procession
was due to pass.1 The discrepancy between this outer veneer and the tawdry reality underneath becomes positively grotesque when one finds others, no doubt in all sincerity, reporting that the people revered
this ruler and that life during his reign was not at all bad for them.2 As a matter of fact, dissatisfaction with conditions in the country did not find expression in uprisings of any significance. How is one to explain this? Undoubtedly the Persian government's aggressive policy of centralisation since the reign of 'Abbas I had in the meantime borne fruit. Quasi-autonomous provincial administrations had been systematically eradicated. At the same time, those elements most likely to constitute a threat to the shah, especially the Qizilbash and their leaders, had been divested of power and ultimately suppressed. However, this is not of itself an adequate explanation. It is doubtless
also significant that, according to Malcolm,3 no events whatsoever of major importance occurred during the reign of Sulaiman. But what decisively influenced public verdict on the shah was probably the fact that he did not involve the country in war. His apathetic and nonchalant attitudes may well have been construed as a love of peace. In the judgement of the masses, reports of the dignified bearing and the external appearance of this blonde, blue-eyed man of great
physical strength4 are likely to have outweighed any evidence of lack of initiative. It is true that in the sphere of foreign policy Sulaiman avoided doing anything that might lead him into difficulties. Although the Ottomans, owing to wars with Austria, Poland and Venice, would scarcely have been capable of action on any large scale in the eastern parts of their empire, he steadfastly refused to violate the peace treaty which his
grandfather had made with the Porte in 1049/1639; tn*s despite, for instance, repeated offers from Mesopotamia (1684, 1685) and from Basra (1690) to re-establish Persian suzerainty there. In addition, he allowed the Dutch East India Company to establish a base on the island

of Kishm in the Persian Gulf. Similarly he shunned conflict with Russia when the Cossacks, in the course of their increasingly frequent incursions on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea after 1662, requested on more than one occasion that they might be placed under Persian suzerainty. The Uzbeks were able to make plundering raids on eastern Persia without fear of vigorous reprisals. Such raids, always undertaken when the Persians least expected them, were, however, relatively small-scale actions carried out by tribes of rapacious nomads not fully integrated into the sphere of influence of the khan. At all events they did not mar the good relations the shah enjoyed with successive rulers of Bukhara, 'Abd al-'Aziz Khan and, after 1091/1680, the latter's brother, Subhan Qull Khan. In 1685 ambassadors were exchanged in an attempt to settle existing differences diplomatically. Another neighbouring people from the north, the Kalmucks, a Western Mongolian race from the Ust-Urt region between the Caspian and Aral Seas, had already attracted the attention of the government in Isfahan in the time of 'Abbas II, at first because of an incursion into the province of Astarabad and later when a legation was sent to the Persian capital. The Kalmucks, clearly under the impression that Persia was militarily weak, made further attacks during Sulaiman's reign. From time to time they also sent ambassadors to the Persian court again. It is,
however, unlikely that they were held in any great esteem there.1
In contrast to earlier periods there were no difficulties of note with the Georgian lands. In Kakhetia the previously mentioned governor Shahnavaz had been succeeded in 1664 by his son Archil Khan and in 1675, for a short period, by Herakleios I (Erekle), a grandson of the famous Theimuraz. All subsequent administrators were Persians. In Kartlia, on the other hand, a native dynasty, the Mukhranids, remained under Persian suzerainty. Because of the pomp and circumstance associated with the reception of foreign legations, detailed accounts of the diplomatic activity of the period are given both by Persian sources and by foreign travellers. European missions figure prominently, such as those from Sweden, Russia and France. Their object was usually the development of trade relations, Persian silk in particular being in great demand. On 29 July 1694 Shah Sulaiman died in Isfahan at the age of forty

six. According to one version he suffered a stroke during a particularly
heavy drinking bout.1 According to another the cause of death was gout, which had already confined him to bed for two years. Other
authorities see his death as the outcome of decades of debauchery.2 The brief sketch of his reign we have just drawn contains ample evidence of his failure as a ruler. The picture of Sulaiman the human being is no less shameful. Two instances of his insulting behaviour towards his Grand Vizier Shaikh 'All Zangana will suffice to make the point. On one occasion, after forcing the grand vizier to imbibe intoxicating liquor, he spent hours revelling at the sight of his pathetic condition. On another occasion, after ordering the removal of the grand vizier's beard, he had the barber's hand chopped off because he had not done the job thoroughly enough. These and other still worse atrocities of which he was guilty are grotesquely incompatible with the "saint-like" and "unblemished" status to which he laid claim and
which was attributed even to this shah by his subjects.3 Sulaiman's only redeeming feature might perhaps be his appreciation of art, specifically painting and the work of miniaturists. He must be regarded as an outstanding connoisseur if, as is likely, it is true that as a patron he influenced directly or indirectly some of the most impressive works of the three greatest painters of the late nth/ 17th century, 'All Qull Jabbadar, Muhammad Zaman and Mu'In Musavvir. His promotion on the one hand of the traditional style found in Mu'In Musavvir and, on the other hand, of the new tendencies inspired by Western painting which mark the work of 'All Qull Jabbadar and Muhammad Zaman may well be evidence of an artistic taste that could, in more favourable circumstances, have led to the development of a new aesthetic sense.

Intrigues in the harem, which had played a decisive role in so many of his political affairs, seem also to have determined the choice of Sulaiman's successor. He himself had failed to nominate a crown prince. Instead, he is said to have advised the dignitaries gathered around his

sick-bed during his last hours that if they were concerned to maintain peace and quiet they should make his elder son, the twenty-six-year old Sultan Husain Mlrza his successor; if, on the other hand, they wished to strengthen royal power and expand the empire they should rather appoint the latter's twenty-three-year old brother, 'Abbas Mlrza. The ruler passed away at an unforeseen moment when no-one was present. His death was discovered by his aunt, Princess Maryam Begum, whose sympathies lay wholly with Prince Husain. She informed the influential eunuchs and it is unlikely that she had any difficulty in winning their support for her favourite. His coronation on 14 Dhu'l-Hijja 1105/6 August 1694 meant the continuation of his father's misrule, albeit in a somewhat different key. At the same time it was the prelude to the fall of the Safavid dynasty. Sultan Husain had, it is true, a reign of twenty-eight years before him, but not one, however, destined to bring happiness to the empire. He and his country, which for more than two centuries had withstood serious crises within and powerful enemies without, were to suffer a catastrophe at the hands of an opponent as unforeseen as he was basically insignificant, but whom the shah and his army were powerless to repulse. Before considering this, however, we need to discuss his character, his outlook on life and his conduct of government. Shah Sulaiman's statement concerning the choice of his successor, whether actually made or subsequently attributed to him, was well founded in the quite different personalities of his sons, the two eldest of a total of seven. Both had grown up in the seclusion of the harem and neither of them had received an education or preparation of any kind for the tasks which awaited a future monarch of Persia. Manliness, bellicosity, sobriety and adroitness were the main characteristics of Prince 'Abbas. Sultan Husain was totally different: a placid, social personality, studious, abstemious and, even in his early years, pious to such a degree that he was given the nickname "Mulla Husain" by those around him. His indifference towards the governmental duties assigned to him — in this respect he was just like his father — found expression in another nickname he was given, Yakhshidir ("very well!"), which was his stock response whenever matters of government were expounded to him. In the good intentions with which he began his reign the new shah had the support of the Shaikh al-Islam Muhammad Baqir MajlisI

(b. 1037/1627, d. mi/1699), a famous theologian on whom Shah Sulaiman had already conferred office. Initially, it looked as though this man, who had girded on Husain's sword during the solemn inves
titure,1 would prevent the young monarch from following in the evil ways of his predecessors. He was the driving force behind Husain's first decrees, which forbade abuses of the religious code that had become widespread, such as unbridled consumption of alcohol. On his initiative too the sufis were banished from the capital, members of the very order of which the shah himself was master but with whom he no longer felt any affinity. The influence exerted by Muhammad Baqir and his theologians inevitably roused the jealousy of the people of the harem, the eunuchs and the princesses. Anxious not to lose power, they did their utmost to counteract any attempts to weaken their position; and not without success, as shown by the fate of the ban on alcohol just mentioned. Cunningly exploiting the concept of moral infallibility associated with the office of shah, a Shl'I version of the maxim "the king can do no wrong", they successfully tempted Husain to indulge in wine drinking. Here again the Princess Maryam Begum, herself a hardened wine drinker, played a significant role. Although at first sight these events appear to stem from a palace intrigue on the part of various pressure groups composed of court and state dignitaries, their real causes lie deeper. These will be dealt with in our concluding remarks, but at least some allusion to them is necessary at this point in the discussion. It will be recalled that Shah 'Abbas I had not only destroyed the military might of the Qizilbash but also neutralised the more strongly religious elements of the group, the sufis proper - by that time the arms-bearing ghazls could probably no longer be regarded as actually identical with the practising members of the sufl order. 'Abbas I had put the latter firmly in their place in 998/1589-90 after a trial of strength to which they had challenged him. From then on he had suppressed their influence more and more, most effectively by a policy of ignoring them or treating them with contempt. After his death their standing suffered still further, especially when in the reign of Shah 'Abbas II a group of well-versed theologians appeared on the
1 Lockhart, Tbe Fall, p. 38, writes: "Sultan Husain refused to let the Sufis gird him with the sword in the customary manner, and called upon the Shaikh al-Islam to do so instead." Safi II (Sulaiman) had done the same at his coronation : Lambton, "Quis custodiet custodes?", SI vi (1956), i4if.; Braun, Das Erbe Schab 'Abbas' I, p. 50.

scene who were no longer prepared to recognise "the mystic vagaries of
the earlier period".1 This group, the 'ulama', with the mujtahid at their head, advanced unassailable Shi'i doctrines to refute the religious concepts of the sufls and resolutely strove, for their own part, to win power over the shah. In the case of Shah Sulaiman and, as will now be seen, Shah Sultan Husain, they succeeded. Of the 'ulama, the group which thus greatly increased in strength, a prominent representative was Muhammad Baqir Majlisl. As his theological writings prove, he was a man of great erudition, but this in no way diminished his interest in secular power. Nor, certainly, did it counteract a religious intolerance on his part from which not only Christians and Jews but also Sunnis, the aforementioned sufls and even philosophers were made to suffer. The shah let him have his own way. Far from unifying the population of the country, this policy of intolerance, which was also pursued by Muhammad Baqir's grandson and successor Mir Muhammad Husain, tended to sow dissension because it encouraged people to denounce one another. It was one of the factors that subsequently, in the hour of need, rendered religious commitment ineffective as a stimulus to popular resolve to defend the country. A truly paradoxical situation characterises the final phase of Safavid rule. A monarch, pious to the point of bigotry, submits to the demands of orthodox Shi'i theologians, the adversaries of his ancestors who had won over the nation to Shi'ism and preserved it in that belief. Of course these ancestors, especially Isma'Il, the founder of the state, had held radically different views of Shi'ism from the theologians who now triumphed as power slipped from the hands of a weak and irresolute ruler. These did not use their power to the best advantage of the country, any more than did their rivals inside the harem, who with few exceptions were men of little ability. The decline in royal power, the indifference of the shah with regard to the affairs of state, his lack of initiative, energy and consistency ruled out all possibility of progress in the country, whether one considers trade and commerce, administration or agriculture, the national finances or the army. Nor were successes in foreign policy to be achieved in the prevailing circumstances. Nevertheless, the institutions of state continued to function, even if ominous signs of ossification and torpor became noticeable, for example, in the military sphere.

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
Even cultural life continued on its way, in some fields with considerable achievements. Examples of craftwork, such as ceramics, metalwork and textiles, testify to the uninterrupted activity at the monarch's court workshops. Their products nowadays enjoy immense popularity amongst collectors and museums throughout the world. Architecture, too, remained productive. The shah was reponsible for the improvement and extension of his palace buildings and the Madrasa-yi Chaharbagh, founded by his mother, is even one of the masterpieces of Safavid architecture. Contacts with Europe continued: we learn of legations from the courts of Louis XIV and Peter the Great in 1708, as well as a further legation from the Tsar in 1715. Persia herself sent diplomatic missions, for example to France. Although these exchanges were concerned primarily with specific problems of international trade, they were at the same time not without significance for the cultural and particularly the artistic development of the country. They brought aesthetic ideas from the West to Persia, European works of art such as paintings and even Western artists and craftsmen. Thus the already mentioned European influence on Persian art, especially painting, was enhanced. Clearly the shah himself did not stand in the way of this development, since he even agreed to pose for a Dutch portrait
painter.1 In this respect, at any rate, he had no religious scruples.
The religious policy just referred to, which was designed to impose Shi'I Islam as the sole confession in Persia, naturally created a good deal of bad blood because of the forcible conversion of Zoroastrians, Jews, Christians and relatively small groups of Shi'I sectarians, but it had positively devastating consequences for the more or less closed SunnI sections of the population. If they lived near the borders, such communities reacted to the pressure of forcible conversion by developing separatist tendencies. This occurred in the Afghan areas of the Safavid empire, and it was there in the region of Zamlndavar and Qandahar that the storm gathered which was eventually to cause the downfall of the shah.
The warlike tribe of the Ghalzai2 had penetrated into these areas,

the population of which had been severely reduced during the reign of 'Abbas I with the resettlement of the Abdalls in Herat. The Ghalzai policy of playing off the Persian governor of Qandahar against the Mughal governor in Kabul had so far helped them to overcome considerable difficulties. Inveterate Sunnls as they were, the Ghalzai now attempted to counter Persian religious pressures by treating with India. Initially they had no intention of rebelling against the Persians, towards whom, if anything, they were more favourably inclined than to the Mughals. But a sudden switch in policy occurred when, as a result of an attack by the Baluchls which the commandant of Qandahar proved powerless to resist, Gurgln Khan (i.e. the former King Giorgi XI of Kartlia) was appointed governor-general in May 1704 and dispatched together with his forces from Kirman to Qandahar. Brutal treatment at the hands of the Georgians now provoked a revolt amongst the Ghalzai. Gurgln Khan suppressed them, took prisoner their leader, the wealthy and influential Mir Vais, and sent him to Isfahan. Although Gurgln Khan had warned that his prisoner was a dangerous man, Mir Vais managed to gain the favour of the shah and even to arouse his suspicion against the governor-general. A few years later he returned to Qandahar a free man and Gurgln Khan was unable to take any action against him. During his long stay in the capital he had gained a deep insight into the abuses of the government and central administration.
In April 1709, when a large proportion of the Georgian troops had left on an expedition in the provinces, Mir Vais staged a carefully planned coup. Surprising the governor-general in a camp outside the fortress, he overpowered and defeated him together with his followers. Later, when the expeditionary force returned, it was unable to retrieve the situation. The man sent to quell the rebellion, Kai-Khusrau, prefect of Isfahan and a nephew of Gurgln Khan, proved unequal to the task. It took him more than a year and a half even to arrive on the scene although the forces at his disposal — Georgians and Qizilbash, who were joined in Herat by a group of the Abdali tribe, hereditary foes of the Ghalzai — were numerically strong. Despite initial successes, he was brought to a standstill outside the walls of Qandahar, and lack of reinforcements as well as the outbreak of an epidemic amongst his troops forced him to raise the siege at the end of October 1711. As he retreated the pursuing Ghalzai inflicted a crushing defeat which also cost him his life. The next commander to be entrusted with the recon

quest of Qandahar, the qiirchl-bashl Muhammad Zaman Khan Shaman, fell ill and died en route in Herat long before his forces could make contact with the enemy. Whether these failures helped to persuade the authorities in Isfahan that nothing could be achieved against the Ghalzai with forces of the quality hitherto dispatched, or whether the indifference of the shah had now spread to those members of the government who had so far retained an inclination for decisive action, Mir Vais suffered no further attacks from the central government in the years up to his death in 1127/1715. He subjected the whole territory of Qandahar to his control and ruled it as an independent prince, if only under the modest title of vakil ("administrator"). The plans sometimes attributed to him of marching on Isfahan, dethroning the shah and assuming sovereign command in Persia seem to have scarcely any foundation in fact and are probably embellishments of the truth in the light of subsequent devel
opments.1 The starting point of these developments may be discerned in the policies initiated by Mir Vais, and he might even be regarded as a pioneer of Afghan independence, though not as its founder. Since his ambitions did not extend so far, that title is usually reserved for another tribal leader, Ahmad Shah Durrani, who does not come to full historical prominence until thirty years later. One reason for this may be that the latter's tribe has greater claims to be called Afghan than the
Ghalzai, namely the Abdalis2 of Herat, whom we have just encountered as the hereditary foes of the Ghalzai and allies of the luckless Kai-Khusrau. The Abdalis, finding themselves in a plight similar to that of their adversaries in Qandahar, revolted against oppression and exploitation by representatives of the central government in Isfahan. The shah sent one force after another to suppress the uprising, but they all failed. Although the warlike spirit of the Afghans was a contributory factor, the lack of training and discipline on the part of the troops sent and the incompetence and inadequate fighting experience of their leaders was of greater account, as ample evidence from both Persian and Western sources shows.
In the face of such catastrophic information from the east of the

country — to which may be added the news of the occupation of Bahrain and other islands of the Persian Gulf by Sultan b. Saif II, the imam of 'Uman — Princess Maryam Begum, who still had a certain influence over the shah, tried to stimulate him to a more effective course of action. As a result he transferred his court in the winter of 1129— 30/1717—18 to Qazvln, hoping that he might be able to raise more efficient fighting troops in the north-west. During the three years he spent there, however, not a single successful expedition was made against the Abdalls or the Ghalzai. Opportunities for effective intervention doubtless arose; it was merely a question of choosing the right moment. But in practice Sultan Husain and his advisers allowed events in the east to take their course. During the turbulent period associated with the Abdall uprising, which spread from Herat to Mashhad, events of vital interest to the shah were occurring, as it were, behind the scenes. For the brother and successor of the vakil, 'Abd al-'AzIz, intended in spite of all the opposition the idea aroused amongst his fellow tribesmen to announce his submission to Sultan Husain. The intention proved fatal. In 1129/1717 it prompted Mir Mahmud, a son of his late brother, to murder him and seize power. It seems that nobody at the Persian court was even aware of the opportunity that an arrangement with 'Abd al-'Aziz might have offered. Similarly the Persians made little attempt to exploit the opportunities arising from the internal power struggles of the Abdall leaders and failed to profit from the conflicts between the Abdalls and the Ghalzai which soon developed. When Mir Mahmud sent the shah the head of the Abdall leader Asad-Allah who had fallen in battle (1132/1719—20), the most obvious interpretation of the gesture — that it was a disarming ploy — never even occurred to him. Choosing instead to see it as a manifestation of loyalty, he appointed Mir Mahmud governor-general with the title Husain Qull Khan and sent him a royal robe of honour.
The death-blow to the Safavid kingdom did eventually come from the east, but it was impossible to foresee that it would happen as it did. Nor, initially, did the government locate the principal danger in that direction. Given the incursions from Russia mentioned earlier, Peter the Great's interest in Persia should have given cause for alarm, and a Russian attack on the south-west coast of the Caspian Sea was in fact to occur in the summer of 1134/1722. By that time, however, Safavid

might was in any case at the last gasp, and the Russians achieved little
more than the capture of Darband.1 There was unrest amongst the Lezgians, a Sunnl people in the northwest of the country, even though one of their number was Grand Vizier. The Shlrvanls, also Sunnl, were led by the intolerance of their Persian governors to appeal for aid to the Porte. This may have contributed to Durri Efendl's being sent to Persia as ambassador, a move by which Istanbul probably hoped to gain a clearer picture of Persian affairs. In 1719 the Lezgians became involved in armed conflict, first with the Shlrvanls, then with the Georgians under Vakhtang VI of Tiflis. The latter was just preparing to deal a final, crushing blow to the Lezgians when the government intervened to prevent him. Although the Lezgians were saved the future loyalty of the Georgian prince was forfeited. Rebellious Kurds occupied Hamadan and penetrated almost to the outskirts of Isfahan. In Khuzistan rivalry for the office of viceroy (vail) led to unrest among the Musha'sha'. Baluchi tribes made plundering raids on Bam and Kirman. Since the government could not possibly contemplate dealing with all these potential threats simultaneously it chose to concentrate on what in its view was the most dangerous: the Arabs on the Persian Gulf and the imam of 'Uman, who in occupying the Gulf islands had of course already encroached on Persian territory. The Grand Vizier (i'timad al-daula) Fath 'All Khan Daghistanl entrusted the task to his nephew, Lutf'All Khan, the governor of Fars, who assembled a force of 9,000 men which he intended to transport to 'Uman in Portuguese ships. But the project was not destined to reach fruition. It seemed as if the government's attention was diverted from Qandahar as a result of this plan. There the young Mahmud — he was only eighteen years old when he seized power — was gaining the respect of his fellow tribesmen through his warlike bearing and his cunning. It suited his plans that the death of Aurangzib in 1118/1707 had provoked a crisis in the Mughal empire, which meant that he was safe from surprise attacks on that flank. At the end of 1719 he gained an unqualified success when he advanced on Kirman with 11,000 men. The startled governor took flight and the Ghalzai were able to occupy the city without difficulty. Soon, however, they were forced to march back to Qandahar because Mahmud's position there was threatened.

SULTAN HUSAIN
The sudden attack on Kirman must have caused Fath 'All Khan to change his mind. At all events he endeavoured to divert the government's interest from the Persian Gulf and to concentrate it instead on Qandahar. He urged that all the armed forces should be marched there, the shah himself and the government taking part in the campaign in order to lend the desired weight to the operation for the benefit of external observers. The assembled court did in fact set off for the east at the end of 113 2/beginning of October 1720, but it advanced no further than Tehran. The grand vizier's standing at court was problematical, partly as he was a Lezgian and not a Persian proper, but above all because of his SunnI beliefs which were considered unthinkable by those dignitaries still capable of reasoning in the old Safavid-Shi'I categories. Moreover, he could not rely on the shah, apathetic, irresolute and inconsistent as he was. In these circumstances every member of the government and court strove to realise his own particular aims — or at least each pressure group did - and to thwart the opposing plans of others. In this way the proposed Qandahar campaign had met with violent opposition. The chief opponents of the grand vizier were the mulla-bdsht, Muhammad Husain, and the royal physician {hakim-bdshi), Rahlm Khan, in this case because of the increased power and prestige a successful campaign might bring him. With the help of a forged letter to a Kurdish tribal chief they made accusations of high treason against him to the shah. Fath 'All Khan was alleged to be part of a SunnI conspiracy to depose the monarch and assume power himself. Without investigating the charge, Sultan Husain relieved him of his office and had him blinded and imprisoned. Lutf 'All Khan was likewise accused of complicity in the plot, enticed from Shlraz to Isfahan and there thrown into prison. Any continuation of the march to Qandahar was now out of the question. The court turned back to Isfahan, where it arrived at the end of April 1721. Those of Lutf 'All Khan's troops who had not already dispersed, now the only remaining operational force of the shah, were dispatched under a different command against the Afghans. As a result of various conflicts on the way, however, they were almost totally wiped out long before their destination was reached. Although by no means all
authors agree in their judgment of Fath 'All Khan Daghistani,1 it is certain that in eliminating him and his nephew the shah had removed

the two strongest pillars of the now shaky edifice of his power. The accounts of the Turkish ambassador DurrI Efendi, who left Persia at this time, confirm precisely what his Russian counterpart Volynsky had reported to the Tsar two years earlier, namely that Safavid rule was on the point of collapse because of a lack of talented personalities in the government. As a result of the fall of their tribesman Fath 'All Khan, unrest among the Lezgians increased. Together with fellow-Sunnis from Shlrvan and other Transcaucasian areas they besieged and conquered the capital of Shlrvan, Shamakhl, taking terrible revenge for earlier Shi'I oppression and placing themselves and the city under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Turkey. In the meantime the government had also lost its influence in the south and south-west of Iran, and chaos had supervened.
The Safavid empire was in flames, but it still enjoyed a respite which might have saved it from utter ruin — a respite, however, of which no advantage was taken. Immediately after his return from Tehran, Sultan Husain repaired to his favourite castle of Farahabad on the other side of the Zayandarud and occupied himself with its further development, seemingly oblivious of the reasons for the campaign that he had intended to pursue only shortly before. Only when news arrived that Mahmud was again about to enter Kirman did the government in Isfahan begin to appreciate the seriousness of the situation. The Ghalzai had indeed arrived outside the city on 22 October 1721, but after suffering heavy casualties during an unsuccessful attack on the citadel Mahmud decided to forgo a renewed attempt, probably because of the risk of further losses, and marched on. A similar situation occurred in Yazd, where after an unsuccessful blockade Mahmud raised the siege in exchange for the payment of a high tribute and continued his march in the direction of Isfahan. Authorities there must by this time have realised that Mahmud was out to clinch matters, if reports are true that en route he was twice interrupted by messengers of the shah who were to offer financial inducements to halt his advance. Mahmud rejected such offers, rightly inferring that Sultan Husain's preparations for defence could not be very strong. In Sagzl, twenty-five miles east of Isfahan, he received intelligence of a Persian force advancing against him. He then continued his march only as far as the village of Muhammadabad where he divided his

troops, positioning them on three hills where they had an uninterrupted view over a plain stretching some 4,000 yards or more to the next village, Gulnabad. The Ghalzai forces were not all that strong: probably 10,000 men, to which must be added the support troops of the Hazaras and Baluchls. Although details of the numerical strength of the two sides vary considerably in the sources, it is in all unlikely that Mahmud had more than 18,000 combatants at his disposal, and allowance must be made for the losses he had so far incurred: the abortive assault on the
citadel of Kirman alone had cost him 1,500 men.1 On 7 March 1722 the Persian forces arrived on the battlefield. Their army of 42,000 men was superior, numerically and in various other respects, to that of the Afghans. Although it contained a fairly large proportion of hastily assembled volunteers who were inadequately trained and armed, there were also experienced fighting troops such as the corps of royal squires (qullar), which included a four-hundredstrong guards unit under the command of the experienced Georgian general Rustam Khan; a 12,000 strong corps of Arab cavalry commanded by the vail of 'Arabistan, who is said to have been called Sayyid 'Abd-Allah; two Lorian contingents of mounted tribal warriors, one under the command of 'All Mardan Khan Faill, the other under 'All Riza Khan from Kuhglluya; and a detachment of artillery with twenty-four guns commanded by a Persian with the assistance of an experienced French master-gunner. When battle commenced the following afternoon, the Persians gained initial successes that very nearly reduced Mahmud to a state of panic. It soon became apparent, however, that there was a total lack of coordination on the Persian side. There was no unified supreme command, responsibility being shared by two men who were, what is more, sworn enemies. They were the new Grand Vizier (i'timad al-daula) Muhammad Qull Khan Shamlu and the vail of 'Arabistan. The latter owed his position to the special favour of the shah whilst the Grand Vizier, as a former general of the guards (qurchi-bashl), was expected to possess military ability - a totally unwarranted assumption. The Persians' main asset, their heavy artillery, was scarcely of any account because the Afghans succeeded in eliminating it early in the battle. Whereas the absence of a clear hierarchy of command proved

321



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
fatal to the Persians, the superior coordination of their own forces enabled the Afghans to make the best of a bad job even in awkward situations. By the end of the day the Persian forces had collapsed and were retreating in undisciplined fashion into Isfahan. Their- losses are estimated at 5,000 men, whereas the Afghans are said to have lost only a tenth of that number. Only fear of an ambush prevented the Afghans from pursuing the defeated Persians into the city. It seems that Mahmud did not immediately realise the full extent of the Persian defeat and the demoralisation it entailed. The fact that he had neglected to take the citadels of both Kirman and Yazd during the course of his advance may well suggest that a military engagement with the shah was his major aim, but it does not necessarily imply that he had in mind the destruction of Safavid rule from the very outset of his campaign. At any rate, the victory does not appear to have deprived him of the capacity for making a realistic assessment of the possibilities open to him. It is difficult otherwise to explain why he let three days go by before resuming his march on Isfahan, now only nineteen miles away. On reaching the area south of the Zayandarud, he came upon Sultan Husain's favourite castle of Farahabad. In spite of the existence of defence works, he was able to take it without a fight and set up his headquarters there. The Armenian suburb Julfa was then plundered and a tribute ruthlessly exacted from the inhabitants, to whom — rather than to Persian soldiers — it owed its defence. These actions suggest that the Afghan troops were still very much aware of the fact that they might suddenly have to retreat. Mahmud no doubt saw clearly that the victory of Gulnabad had been won to a large extent thanks to a combination of favourable circumstances; nor is he likely to have forgotten that at one moment during the battle he had been close to accepting defeat and retreating. Finally, he must have realised that in spite of the defeat the shah's military resources were as yet by no means exhausted. One thing, for the moment at least, that the Ghalzai leader could not be expected to know was the absurd state of affairs that the shah, whenever a decision was required of him, was more or less guaranteed to choose the alternative least favourable or even fatal to his cause. Despite repeated disasters, he remained stubbornly faithful to those counsellors whose advice had constantly proved detrimental, especially the mulla-bashl, Mir Muhammad Husain, grandson and successor of the famous theologian Muhammad Baqir Majlisi, and the royal physician, Rahlm Khan. Each of these men had, as we have seen, acted as

evil genius to the ruler at an earlier stage. They were now joined by the vail of 'Arabistan, for whom the shah had a particularly high regard despite his failure in the battle of Gulnabad. He persisted in his opinion when rumours too loud to ignore indicated that the governor was conspiring with the enemy and even when incontrovertible evidence of the fact came to light. First in a whole series of fatal mistakes made by the shah was his decision to remain in Isfahan instead of mobilising fresh troops in other parts of the country to combat the Afghans. His peace proposal, which probably reached the Afghans as they were advancing on the capital, may more than anything else have given the game away and confirmed them in their intentions. On two occasions he then rejected Mahmud's offers of negotiation, one at the beginning of April, the other at the beginning of August 1722. He imposed a general ban on leaving the city and failed to evacuate the civilian population when it would still have been feasible. He successively dismissed the two royal princes Mahmud Mirza and SafI Mirza from the position of crown prince and from their military functions, merely because of acts of
intervention on their part of which his advisers disapproved.1 In addition, he dispatched to Kashan and Qazvln the unreliable Prince Tahmasp, who, instead of raising a relief force and returning with it to the sorely pressed capital as he had been commanded, engaged in dissolute pleasures. Finally, he even dismissed Ahmad Agha, the capable general of the royal squires (qullar-aqasl), because in the heat of the moment his troops had taken revenge on some of the vali's Arab cavalrymen who had left them in the lurch during a sortie.
At the beginning of April Mahmud succeeded in capturing a bridge in the 'Abbasabad quarter and establishing a bridgehead. A little later he was able to link up with contingents based in the east and north, thus making it impossible to either leave or enter the city without risk.
Given its size — Kaempfer set its circumference at 57 miles2 — the Afghan troops were unable to encircle the city completely, but Mahmud did establish powerful strong points, between which units of cavalry constantly patrolled.
In the circumstances, living conditions in the city became increasingly difficult. Supplies of food ceased, and to prevent their being

resumed in future Mahmud ordered all crops in the area to be destroyed. The shah made every effort to obtain relief. The most important fighting force, the Georgians, who could probably have dealt with the Afghans on their own, had to be ruled out when Vakhtang VI refused to come to the shah's aid because he had not yet forgotten the latter's intervention on behalf of the Lezgians. Other contingents such as the Bakhtiyar under Qasim Khan, the Lurs of 'All Mardan Khan or the 10,000 strong force advancing under the command of Malik Mahmud Slstani, the governor of Tun and Tabas, were either repulsed by the Afghans or ultimately had second thoughts, in part convinced by Mahmud of the pointlessness of their enterprise. From mid-June onwards there was famine in Isfahan. All attempts to depose the shah or to persuade him to abdicate were of no avail. At the end of August, when the famine was at its height and more and more people were dying of starvation and disease, despair spread throughout the city. Cannibalism was rife, the dead could no longer be buried and thousands lost their lives in hopeless attempts to escape. In the end the coffers of both government and crown were empty and troops could only be paid out of funds loaned to the shah against the security of the crown jewels by the Dutch and, to a lesser extent, the British East India Companies. By the beginning of October even the shah was convinced that further resistance was pointless, and he capitulated to Mahmud. The latter was not, however, prepared to receive him before 23 October 1722. The meeting took place in the morning of that day in the castle of Farahabad. The shah announced his abdication and the transfer of power to Mahmud, as a gesture of confirmation taking from his head the bejewelled tuft of heron's feathers (Jiqa), the symbol of monarchy, and affixing it to Mahmud's turban with his own hands. Two days later Mahmud entered Isfahan in solemn triumph. Sultan Husain rode at his left hand and, on arrival in the audience chamber of the royal palace, was obliged to acknowledge Mahmud as his successor once more, this time before the assembled military dignitaries, the viziers and the nobles of the realm.

Ghalzai supremacy was to represent only a brief interlude in the history of Persia, coming to an end as early as 1730 with the fall of Ashraf,

Mahmud's cousin and successor. Apart from the liquidation of the already tottering Safavid dynasty, it was scarcely of any significance. The Afghans were able neither to counteract Russian and Turkish incursions into Iranian territory nor to eradicate hotbeds of unrest in various parts of the country, whether these emerged before or after the fall of the Safavid empire. Least of all did they manage to restore the unity of Persia. They even proved incapable of reviving life in the
sorely tried capital in which they now resided.1
The seventy-five years leading up to the end of the 12th/18th century
have been not inaccurately described by Perry as a morass of anarchy2 in which three periods, those of the Afshars, the Zands and the early Qajars, stand out like islands. During each a strong and relatively sensible government was headed by a figure of significance: Nadir Shah, Karlm Khan Zand and Agha Muhammad respectively. The extent to which the traditions of the Safavids were taken over, preserved, adapted, diminished or enlarged by these rulers before they passed to the Qajars and were finally handed down, via the 19th century, to the modern age, is a problem for the cultural historian. Within the narrower framework of Safavid history, our task is to investigate attempts to continue or resurrect the Safavid empire that were made either by members of the dynasty or with their assistance.
When the central government in Isfahan came to an end the Safavids were by no means totally eliminated. On the contrary, individual representatives of the dynasty were still to play a certain part in the political life of the country. Strictly speaking, there were Safavid puppet rulers and periods of partial Safavid rule until as late as 1187/1773, the year in which Isma'Il III, last of the Safavid rois faineants, died; and the efforts of genuine Safavid princes or impostors to gain power in various parts of Persia were of considerable significance. No share in subsequent historical developments was granted to Sultan Husain, nor is it likely that he sought any. During his lifetime, Mahmud ensured that he was well treated although, like all Safavid princes resident in Isfahan, he was imprisoned. He remained in prison
1 The Persian forces are said to have lost 20,000 men in the course of the siege, and civilian losses are put at 80,000. If the population was really 650,000 at the end of the Safavid period, an enormous migration must have occurred as \ result of the siege and the capture of the city by the Afghans. A census of 1882 lists only 73,654 inhabitants, and an estimate made by Schindler in 1893 gives 82,000. Even the rise in population in the last few decades has not yet caught up with the Safavid figure: see Lambton, "Isfahan", EP; Lockhart, Tie Fall, pp. 169, 476ft".

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
until 1139/1726, when he was beheaded on the orders of Ashraf as a result of an insulting letter the latter had received from the Ottoman general Ahmed Pasha, then operating in Persia. He called Ashraf a usurper and informed him that he considered it his duty to reinstate the legitimate ruler of Iran whom the Afghans had deposed. Only a year before, probably in afitof persecution mania, Mahmud Shah had killed the majority of the princes imprisoned with Sultan Husain, some of
them with his own hands.1 For wide sections of the population in Iran the collapse of the Safavid empire that occurred when Sultan Husain relinquished the throne and power was assumed by Mahmud was a catastrophe greater than anything they could possibly have imagined. The result was an almost universal willingness to accept without question any sign of the continued existence of the dynasty or its possible revival — an ideal
situation for pretenders! One source2 lists eighteen of them in the Afghan period alone, and no less than twelve more are mentioned by chroniclers of the reigns of Nadir Shah and his immediate successors. A number of these claimants found support in widely differing areas of the country and managed to occupy or conquer cities and strongholds. Not infrequently they were able to defeat strong regular troops, including even Ottoman invasion forces. Sooner or later, however, they failed because their supporters proved inadequate in numbers or lacked perseverance when really put to the test. The claims of these pretenders to be Safavid princes — no fewer than three SafI Mlrzas and three Isma'Il Mirzas emerged - were at best dubious and as a rule totally without foundation. Yet genuine princes of the fallen dynasty did exist, as well as others whose claims, whilst doubtful, could not simply be rejected out of hand. As we have already seen, Tahmasp Mlrza (b. 1704), appointed crown prince by Sultan Husain, succeeded in breaking through the Afghan lines during the siege of Isfahan and managed to reach Qazvln. There, as early as 30 Muharram 1135/10 November 1722, he had himself proclaimed shah, had the style of Shah Tahmasp II included in official prayers and on the coinage, and issued decrees (arqdm) in all parts of the country, announcing his accession to the throne. Although his was only a nominal

rule, he reigned in fact for a good ten years.1 In addition to Tahmasp, another prince, Mirza Sayyid Ahmad, son of Shah Sulaiman's eldest
daughter,2 had managed to escape. In 1139/1726 he rose to the level of ruler in Kirman and proved to be a serious opponent in combats with the forces of both Tahmasp II and the Afghans. He did indeed constitute a greater threat to the Afghans than Tahmasp, and accordingly received more attention from them. Eventually he was defeated and brought as a prisoner to the Afghan chieftain, who had him executed in
1140/1728.
In foreign affairs, the greatest threat to Persia after the abdication of Sultan Husain came from Russian and Ottoman designs on territory in the Caspian provinces and the north-west of the country respectively. Russian troops were already present in Darband and other places on the shores of the Caspian Sea. The Ottomans, for their part, were not slow to act. Sending a declaration of war in 1135/1723, they marched troops into Georgia and — via Kirmanshah and Hamadan — into Persia itself. The policy of Tahmasp II, who had been forced to withdraw from Qazvln to Tabriz by the Afghans, from there to Ardabll by the Turks and ultimately via Ray to Mazandaran, again by the Turks, was dictated by the notion that his position at home would be consolidated if only the Russians and Ottomans could be induced to recognise him as the legitimate ruler of Persia. With this in mind he had sent negotiators to Istanbul and St Petersburg. As a result the Porte changed its view in his favour, but in a treaty for the division of western Persia, concluded by the Sultan and the Tsar for 2 Shawwal 1136/24 June 1724, the two powers merely expressed a desire to help the shah to achieve "his legitimate rights". Moreover, he was to restrict himself to the territory in the west of the country, defined by the places Ardabll, Sultaniyya and Qazvin. Tahmasp II's first vakil al-daula was Fath 'All Khan Qajar. He was followed by Nadr Qull Beg Afshar, a particularly capable military commander who successfully fought the Afghans and the Turks on his behalf and subjugated Azarbaljan, Georgia and most of Armenia. In other respects, too, he did everything to gain the shah's favour. In 1138/1726 he had conferred upon him the title Tahmasp Qull ("servant of Tahmasp") and by driving out the Afghan Ashraf he even made it

possible for the shah to return to Isfahan. It became increasingly clear, however, that the weak and unreliable shah was incapable of being anything more than a puppet in the general's hands, and when he suffered a heavy defeat in a battle with the Turks the latter's patience came to an end. He exposed the shah publicly as a drunkard and dethroned him. He clearly still thought it advisable, however, to take account of popular sympathy for the Safavids, otherwise he would scarcely have nominated a new Safavid shah, the deposed monarch's eight-monthold son, who as 'Abbas III was puppet king from 1144/1732 to 1148/ 1736. The general then deposed him as well and mounted the throne himself under the name Nadir Shah. Tahmasp II and 'Abbas III were imprisoned and executed in 1740 at Sabzavar together with Isma'Il, another son of Tahmasp. Although it is true that the Afshar tribe to which he belonged was one of the Qizilbash tribes which had contributed in large measure to
the rise of the Safavids,1 Nadir Shah's general outlook by no means accorded with the Safavid conception of the state. Two things demonstrate this clearly: his religious policy, which involved a turning away from the Twelver Shl'a, and his decision to transfer the capital to Mashhad. Although this city lay in the middle of his Khurasanian homeland, the main reason for the transfer was more probably its central position within the extensive territory that Nadir Shah thought of as his empire, as is shown by his campaigns in Central Asia, Afghanistan and India. His conception was, therefore, an imperial one that had nothing in common with the Safavids' idea of their realm, which was confined solely to Iranian lands. At any rate, Nadir's outlook could be compared to that of Tlmur. It might be thought that the successes he enjoyed in realising this conception would have caused the glory of the Safavids to fade somewhat in the eyes of the Persian people. But the situation soon changed. When, after the murder of Nadir, the princes of his family were systematically eliminated, one of his grandsons, Shah Rukh by name (b. 1734), was spared. Now his mother was a daughter of Sultan Husain, and it was clearly the intention that a legitimate prince of Safavid descent should be available as puppet ruler in case renewed enthusiasm for the dynasty were to arise. At the time nobody could have foreseen that Shah Rukh would rule over the

THE LAST SAFAVIDS
inheritance of Nadir Shah, or what still remained of it, from 1161/1748 to 1210/1796, albeit with some interruptions. In the conflicts that followed upon the fall of Nadir Shah, Mir Sayyid Muhammad, curator of sacred relics (mutavalli) in Mashhad, was also involved. Like the above mentioned Mlrza. Sayyid Ahmad, he was a son of Shah Sulaiman's eldest daughter and was held in high regard. When, as the result of a mutiny, Shah Rukh was deposed and blinded, he was the rebels' choice as a successor. In 1163/1750 (or shortly
before)1 he was elevated as shah in Mashhad with the style Sulaiman II. A move to Isfahan could not remotely be contemplated because quite different forces had in the meantime assumed effective control there. As it was, he fell victim to a conspiracy only a few weeks after his elevation to the throne, and Shah Rukh, despite his blindness, returned to power in his place. The concept of divine right, associated with the person of the shah in the thinking of the Safavids, cannot be ruled out as a significant factor in the stubborn survival of the dynasty. Developments in Isfahan and in central Persia generally at any rate suggest such an interpretation. Here, the downfall of Nadir Shah left behind a vacuum into which streamed nomadic tribes from the Zagros mountains, e.g. Lurs, Bakhtiyars, Kurds and also the Zands. Initially, the dominant figure in Isfahan was the Bakhtiyar leader 'AH Mardan Khan. He too seems to have regarded a Safavid figurehead as indispensable and found one in the person of the seventeen-year-old Prince Abu Turab, the son of a marriage between Sayyid Murtaza and a daughter of Shah Sultan Husain. He was crowned in 1163/1750, receiving the name
Isma'U III.2 From then on 'All Mardan himself bore the title of vakil al-daula. It appears that the prince was not happy with the role assigned to him, but he had no other option. In the battle of Chahar Mahall (spring 1165/1752), fought between the Bakhtiyar leader and Karlm Khan Zand, Isma'Il went over to the side of the Kurds with a section of the troops when he realised that his vakil would be defeated. In subsequent conflicts between Karlm and
1 According to Lockhart, The Fall, appendix I, he reigned from Dec. 1749 to Jan. 1750. Perry, "The last Safavids", pp. 65IT., says that he was crowned in Jan. 1750 and deposed and blinded in the following month.
2 Lockhart, The Fall, appendix I, says that Isma'Il III "ruled nominally in 1750 and again between 1752 and 1756". Perry also speaks of an "unsuccessful pretender Sultan Husain II".

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
Muhammad Hasan Khan Qajar, he similarly chose to side with the stronger party, only to discover that the Qajar was eventually worsted. Handed over to Karim Khan, he was greeted with the words shqh-i namak ba-haram ("ungrateful Shah") and interned in the fortress of Abada, half way between Shlraz and Isfahan. Nevertheless, Karim was at first also content to be called vakil al-daula. When in 176 5 he opted for Shlraz as capital city, he then changed his title to vakil al-ra'ayd and occasionally vakil al-khalayiq, meaning roughly "Vice-regent of the people" and "Vice-regent of mankind" respectively. He would refuse to be addressed as "Shah", maintaining that the true shah was in Abada and that he was merely his deputy {kadkhuda). When Isma'Il III passed away in 1187/1773, Karim Khan, who outlived him by eight years, neither installed a new phantom ruler nor made himself shah. The concept of the Safavid monarchy now ceased to exist. Although it had outlasted the fall of the Safavid empire by half a century, it had not been sufficiently strong to bring about a genuine restoration. The concept of monarchy as such was preserved in Iran. In the early i3th/late 18th century it was given a new lease of life by the Qajars, who were successfully to unite the fragmented country within the territorial boundaries of the Safavid empire, albeit without Safavid participation.
One of the most important reasons for the fall of the Safavids was their failure to groom successive members of the dynasty for the task of ruling. Of all people, it was Shah 'Abbas I who abolished the original practice of assigning to the crown princes a large province in order to introduce them to the business of government, even if, until they attained their majority, they did nothing more than observe the governor at work and remained under the supervision of a tutor {laid). 'Abbas I was also responsible for the fatal policy of confining the princes to the harem, thus not only preventing them from learning the practice of government, but also barring them from all contact with the outside world, making it impossible for them to associate with the aristocracy of the realm and giving them no opportunity to come to terms with the conditions of life in general. Naturally there were other reasons for the fall of the dynasty. Amongst the most significant may be cited the increasing inefficiency of central authority within a system organised on centralist lines; the concomitant strengthening of local authorities such as respected tribal

THE SAFAVID STATE
leaders; the ruin of the economy, which has been covered in detail elsewhere in.this volume, and especially the disintegration of the armed forces which ultimately caused the shah to succumb even to an enemy as insignificant as the Afghans. The disintegration of the religious foundations on which the empire had been built also had fatal consequences. And finally, within the ruling classes there was a marked decrease in the supply of able personalities. Depressing though conditions in the country may have been at the time of the fall of the Safavids, they cannot be allowed to overshadow the achievements of the dynasty, which were in many respects to prove essential factors in the development of Persia in modern times. These include the maintenance of Persian as the official language and of the present-day boundaries of the country, adherence to the Twelver Shl'a, the monarchical system, the planning and architectural features of the urban centres, the centralised administration of the state, the alliance of the Shl'I 'ulama with the merchants of the bazaars, and the symbiosis of the Persian-speaking population with important non-Persian, especially Turkish-speaking, minorities.
A few of the most important factors - the peculiar antagonism between Persians and Turks, religious developments in so far as they were of political significance, and alterations in the monarchical system - will be considered in the following summary.
THE SAFAVID STATE
From the 8th/14th to the ioth/i6th century, three waves of returning Turkish emigrants gravitated from eastern Anatolia and northern Syria towards the highlands of Iran. Each of them belonged to a particular tribal confederation and the leaders of each devoted all their energies to the establishment of political and territorial sovereignty. All three confederations succeeded in this, but only the third of them, the Safavids, had lasting success. The first of these Turkmen confederations, the Qara Quyunlu, began their endeavours in the 8th/14th century, establishing a principality the capital of which eventually became the Persian metropolis Tabriz. In 872/1467, when at the height of their power, they were defeated in armed conflict by the rival Aq Quyunlu, who after their victory also transferred their capital to Tabriz. In 907/1501 the city then became the capital of the third confederation of Tiirkmens, the Safavids, after they had in turn overcome the Aq Quyunlu. Like their two



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
predecessors, the Safavids extended their domain to cover the whole of present-day Iran, an intervention in the fortunes of the country which proved of great significance for the whole development of Persia in the modern era. How is one to explain these movements of population and the centuries-long interest of Turkish tribes in Iran, a country whose people were neither Turks nor Turkish speakers? True, the ancestors of the tribesmen in question had already been in Iran - during the course of the Oghuz migrations, mass movements of Turks into the Near East and Asia Minor — and come into contact with Iranian culture, some of them for the second time, since they had been exposed to the cultural influence of Iran in Central Asia even before their migration to the west. The state and court chancelleries of the confederations, as well as their chroniclers, used the Persian language, which in itself points to a certain degree of Iranicisation. This influence was, however, confined to a minute ruling class whose admiration for, and love of, Iran and its culture naturally cannot in themselves have triggered off migrations of whole tribes nor determined the particular direction of their movement. More important was the fact that, as a rule, the Tiirkmens in question had no access to the Ottoman army, any more than their leaders had to the Ottoman military aristocracy, which offered few real openings to them either before or after the battle of Ankara: The Qara Quyunlu leader Qara Yusuf was not even integrated into the Ottoman forces when he sought refuge with • the Ottomans in flight from their mutual enemy Timur. At this time Ottoman power did not extend as far as eastern Anatolia, let alone to Azarbaijan or the Iranian highlands. In the power vacuum left behind after the death of Timur and the fall of his empire these areas offered good opportunities for politically motivated tribal leaders interested in establishing independent domains. To the broad masses of the nomads the prospects of rich spoils of war from the civilised country of Iran and extensive grazing grounds for their herds were unfailing attractions. Together with the restlessness and spirit of enterprise typical of nomadic life, they probably constituted sufficient motive for the eastward thrusts of Turkmen tribes and their federations, at any rate for thefirsttwo waves, those of the Qara Quyunlu and the Aq Quyunlu. A quite different motive, however, underlay the third wave, that occurring under the Safavids. They were attracted by a sufl order, the Ardabil Safaviyya and by a religious concept which, at the end of the 9th/15 th century or perhaps somewhat earlier, had developed from
332



THE SAFAVID STATE
vague beginnings in popular piety into a politico-religious ideology. This ideology aroused in its adherents enthusiasm, fanaticism and ultimately unconditional commitment - precisely those attitudes of mind associated with militant believers in Islam. The order's centre in Ardabll had always attracted men of piety from near and far, including Turkmen tribesmen, long before the aspirations of its masters became unmistakeably political. But in the second half of the 9th/15 th century the hitherto customary pilgrimages gave way to something quite different and the donations arriving in Ardabll at that time, far from being mere oblations as before, had probably been given with other purposes in mind. What had changed? With the travels of Shaikh Junaid in Anatolia and Syria an intensive phase of Safavid propaganda had begun, and his marriage with the Bay'indir princess, a sister of Uzun Hasan, had both increased his prestige and made him, to a certain extent, an acceptable ally of the Tiirkmens. The importance of these two facts for subsequent developments can scarcely be overestimatjed. On the one hand the order was intensifying contacts with the Outside world; on the other it was effacing the dividing line between the two key national groupings in the region. As the descendants of a line of Gllani landowners, the Ardabll shaikhs were representatives of Persian agricultural life, and not Tiirkmens or nomads. Distinctions between nations of the kind familiar to us from later European nationalism were foreign to Islam and are scarcely applicable in this case. Yet the Persians and Turks incontestably sensed that they were essentially different, and this feeling frequently finds explicit expression in historical sources. Intermarriage between the two, in so far as it occurred at all, was not common. Junaid's marriage did not, however, remain the only example of a Tajik-Turkmen union, and these initial indications of a symbiosis might perhaps help to explain just why Turkish nomads should have chosen as their leader the Persian-born master of a religious
order.1 Be that as it may, the activities of Junaid to which we have referred were significant factors in the formation of the third great Turkmen federation.
A brief look at the early history of the Safavid order should help to clarify these developments. The motives behind the formation of the

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
fraternity were certainly religious in nature, but it also played a considerable role in economic and political life, even in the time of Shaikh SafI, who gave the family its name. Landed property, revenues from religious foundations, donations and other sources of income brought him economic influence, and in politics he was able to establish wideranging contacts, even with one so eminent as the Mongol Tl-Khan. His descendants, amongst whom the position of master of the order was usually handed down from father to son, likewise went on to achieve distinction in public life. Without going into further detail, it can now be seen that Junaid's intervention in politics did not represent a radically new departure. What was new was the way he, and afterwards his son and successor Shaikh Haidar, set about militarising the order. The organisational measures and reforms they carried out must have been of lasting effect, for they remained in force until Isma'Il came to public prominence decades later, in Muharram 90 5 /August 1499, this despite the fact that their two initiators, and after them Sultan 'All, lost their lives on the battlefield — three masters of the order in the space of thirty-four years. Recent research has thrown more light on these matters even if some questions still remain unanswered. We now have at least some notion of how the alliance between Ardabll and its outposts worked, especially those in Anatolia and Syria that provided the main body of the forces which supported the Safavid seizure of power. Local cells existed under a headman, called a khalifa. In individual cases, though not as a general rule, there was a supervisor, called a ptra, who was responsible for their coordination. At the head of the organisation was the khalifat al-khulafa, who was also deputy of the master of the order (murshid-i kamil). It has not yet been possible to ascertain exactly when this organisation was established, but it is known that there was a khalifat al-khulafa as early as 1499, i.e. before Isma'lPs accession to the throne. Once the decision to seize power had been taken, the organisation demonstrated its efficiency. Assertions in some sources that the young Isma'Il personally made this decision cannot be accepted at face value. Although he became master of the order five years earlier in place of his brother Sultan 'All, he was still merely twelve years old at the time of the march out of Gllan. Even if one assumes that he was abnormally gifted, it is still inconceivable that a boy of that age could have carried out the complex political and military planning and preparation that must have preceded the uprising.
334



THE SAFAVID STATE
Who, if not Isma'Il, could have taken the momentous decision and begun to put the operation into effect? Some time ago, Soviet historians referred, if only in vague terms, to the existence of Turkmen
confidential agents as advisers of Isma'Il.1 More precise information has since come to light. They were in fact a group of leading Turkmen tribesmen, the ahl-i ikhtisds ("those endowed with a specific responsibility" or "those legally empowered to act"), a sort of "central com
mittee" as they were recently described in modern terminology.2 These were the people who sustained Isma'Il after the death of his brother, who made it possible for him to escape to Gllan and kept him in hiding there, who took care of his education and ultimately persuaded him to march against the Aq Quyunlii. In the light of this obviously convincing interpretation, the elaborate myth of Isma'Il the child prodigy becomes superfluous. Even so, the events associated with his public appearances remain extraordinary enough and messianic elements, evident even at the outset of his career, are now no longer mere
surmise but have actually been proved to exist.3 The hundred and fifty years of the Safavid order that culminated in the accession to the throne of Shah Isma'Il not only have their place in the religious history of Islam but are from the outset of political significance. Although there had always been a certain influx of Tiirkmens into the order, it was not until the time of Shaikh Junaid that the strong links with Turkmen tribesmen were forged, that made for an increasingly tight-knit organisation. His years of propaganda in Anatolia, in Syria and, of course, also in Azarbaljan ultimately unleashed the third wave of Turkish emigrants returning to the Iranian uplands and created the conditions necessary for the formation of the third Turkmen federation, which may be called the "Safavid" or perhaps, more accurately, the Qizilbash federation. This migration persisted, as
has recently emerged,4 right up to the death of Shah 'Abbas I, a time when the Qizilbash had decades previously forfeited their privileged role.

formation due to the influence of the Shl'a. The fact that presentday Persian adherence to the Shl'a derives from the early Safavids, especially Shah Isma'Il I, might lead one in retrospect to conclude that a change of faith took place according to the principle emus regio eius religio. But appearances are deceptive. In reality the transition was a lengthy and highly complex process, connected with the spread of certain Shl'I ideas via Folk Islam or Islamic popular piety — a process which cannot be discussed in detail here. On his accession to the throne, Isma'Il did in fact proclaim Shi'ism the official religion, or state religion, as it might be called. As he extended his sphere of influence, he then proceeded to implement it throughout Persia with the aim, so it is claimed, of distinguishing
Persia from the Ottoman empire.1 This may not, however, have been his sole intention or at all premeditated, but merely a more or less unconscious motive. What he proclaimed was ostensibly the Twelver Shl'a, a creed which certainly cannot be reconciled with his own personal religious views. These we know from what is a quite unimpeachable source of personal testimony, his own poems. In them he claims to be the reincarnation of 'All, an emanation of God and indeed God himself. Such notions have no place in the Shi'a, indeed they are sheer heresy from an orthodox Shl'I point of view, a fact which cannot be denied by arguing that they are perhaps merely the literary extravagances of a mystically impassioned youth, along the lines of such sufi conceptions as unto mystica, union with God {tauhid). In fact they were by no means merely obsessive mystical speculations but articles of faith which were widely held by the supporters of the Safavids and had powerful practical consequences. Isma'Il's enthusiastic disciples {muridan) took them so seriously that they were firmly convinced of his invincibility. Imbued with such ideas, they marched into battle, going from triumph to triumph until the whole of Persia had been subjected to the sway of the Safavids. Admittedly the defeat at Chaldiran destroyed Isma'H's charisma, but even after this reverse he continued to be revered like a god by many of his subjects, and the same is also true, incidentally, of his son Tahmasp. The state founded by Isma'Il was a theocracy, comparable with the
1 Lambton, "Quis custodiet custodes?", SI vi (1956), 126. As against this view, it would be worth investigating whether the Ottomans, who were then on the brink of turning to Shi'ism, did not rather have rapid second thoughts when the Shfa was raised to the level of state religion in Persia.

empire of the caliphs but based on ShI'I rather than on SunnI principles. The distinction is important because it meant that ShI'I theories of the state and of succession, radically different from those of the Sunnls, were to be authoritative. Instead of the elected caliph, the head of state was to be an imam descended from the Prophet Muhammad, at any rate as long as such a person existed, i.e. until 260/873-4, the date of the disappearance of the Twelfth Imam. Subsequently the office passed to a vakil whose entitlement did not depend on direct descent from the prophet, but rather on being nominated by a legitimate predecessor (nass). This regulation remained in force until 329/940—1, when the vakil Abu'l-Hasan al-Samarrl passed away without having exercised his right to designate a successor. According to the doctrine of the Twelver Shl'a, from that point onwards until the return of the Mahdl - i.e. for the duration of the great ghaiba which still continues today - a given mujtahid was to be considered as the latter's steward. The mujtahid is that singular dignitary who without being appointed, without either office or clearly defined responsibilities, has a commanding influence within the Shl'a community in matters of religious law and practice purely by virtue of his personal authority, based on his learning and his exemplary conduct. It must be emphasised that neither the vakil nor the mujtahid is required to be a descendant of the Prophet. Bearing in mind these considerations, how legitimate was the Safavids' claim to sovereignty over Persia? Neither in Isma'Il's case nor in that of his father, grandfather or any other ancestor can there be any question of nass, and indeed none of them claimed to have been designated ruler by a legitimate predecessor. Nor was any one of them a mujtahid. In these circumstances, how could they have become sovereigns? Can it really be the case that so fundamental a qualification for the post of steward of the imam was disregarded, perhaps, as has been suggested, on account of Safavid propaganda, deliberately
designed to divert attention from it?1 To consider the matter of Isma'Il's accession in such a theoretical light is in all probability inappropriate. Because it was markedly religious in character it is of course tempting to judge it from a theological point of view. But this is surely a mistake. Obviously Isma'U was a personality with a pronounced sensitivity for things religious. For

some years he had received Shl'I religious instruction, but he had certainly not acquired any theological knowledge. Nor can one assume that those around him possessed any. Moreover, the Shl'a he caused to be proclaimed in Tabriz by no means accorded with the theology of the Twelver Shl'Is. True, this neglect of theological considerations was not to last, but for the situation to change Shl'I theologians had to come from outside the country, a fact which in itself points to a certain paucity of theological knowledge at the outset of his reign. It would appear that the young Isma'Il and his advisers were not even aware of
the meaning of the concept of nass.1 Although initially the sharp distinctions of theological concepts may have been foreign to the young Isma'Il's world of ideas, it by no means follows that he was totally ignorant of legitimist theories as such. He was probably just as familiar with general ideas of this kind as were his contemporaries. Whereas SunnI theories of sovereignty allow for the recognition of a usurper, in Shl'I teaching the principle of legitimacy finds particularly strong expression. It is encountered also in popular thinking, a concrete example of which is the quasi-legendary tale in which the hidden Imam performs the investiture of Isma'Il before the
eyes of a dervish in a dream.2 Here the underlying idea of the necessity for the ruler to be designated in accordance with divine wish or approval is unmistakeable, even though the concept of nass is not mentioned. To that extent the tale does not necessarily contradict our supposition that Isma'Il and his loyal supporters could scarcely have been familiar with so complex an idea. Whether Isma'Il, in emerging from Gllan, intended from the outset to win sovereignty over Iran remains debatable, however much subsequent reports suggest such an interpretation. Initially, of course, he had to establish himself as master of the Ardabll order. This may explain the military campaigns and predatory raids he carried out which were similar to those of his father and grandfather before him with their bands of ghazls. Like them, he was probably inspired by the ghazl concept and perhaps by the idea of vendetta as well. The turningpoint was probably not reached until the emergence of Shams al-Dln Zakariya KujujI, a native of Tabriz who for many years had served the Aq Quyunlu as vizier. For this man, whom Isma'Il made his own

vizier, reported that his former masters were in a state of utter chaos.' At all events, his reports demonstrated just how favourable an opportunity had arisen for seizing power. After all, Isma'U was the grandson of Uzun Hasan. Why should he not ascend the throne of his grandfather instead of his cousins? A clear indication that Safavid rule was to represent a continuation of that of the Aq Quyunlu is the fact that the Turkmen capital of Tabriz was retained, whereas no mention is made of Ardabll, which might equally well have been chosen as the royal residence. Further evidence of a desire to follow in the line of Turkmen rulers is Isma'il's assumption of the title Padishah-i Iran, previously held by Uzun Hasan. At the same time it provides documentary proof of the Persian monarchs' continued adherence to the concept of divine right — khwarna, "regal majesty", which under Islam was
changed to %tll Allah, "the shadow of God [on earth]".2 Isma'U's assumption of power in Tabriz in no way affected his position as murshid-i kamil, master of the order of the Safaviyya. On the contrary, this office — which was relevant only to members of the order and not to his other subjects — had increased in significance as a result of his military and political successes, for in addition to his powers as sovereign it guaranteed him, by virtue of the plr-murld relationship, the particular loyalty of his armed forces, the Qizilbash. As we have seen, these were mostly Turkmen tribesmen from Anatolia, Syria and Azarbaljan. Its importance was not to wane until the defeat of Chaldiran later destroyed the messianic radiance and charisma of the ruler, making him less sacrosanct in the eyes of his supporters. Not surprisingly, the khalifat al-khulafa gained in influence, since he had to deputise for the shah to a large extent in his duties as master of the order. No outright confrontation between the two was to occur until half a century later, in the reign of Shah Isma'Il II, when members of the order made no secret of the fact that they felt a greater obligation to the khalifa than to the monarch. This clear indication of the order's decline was followed by another confrontation, this time with 'Abbas I in 998/1589-90, which practically speaking put an end to its respected status in the realm.

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
More problematical than the two foundations of Safavid power we have discussed so far was its third basis, descent from the Prophet Muhammad, i.e. the sayyid status of the dynasty. With a touch of dry irony Aubin remarks that the Safavids did not become Sayyids until
late on, probably just before the middle of the 9th/15 th century.1 Since that other scion of the prophet, Sayyid Ahmad Kasravl, made his violent attacks on the genealogy of the Safavids fifty years ago the arguments for and against their genuineness have constantly been the object of critical debate, but no clear-cut and definitive verdict has yet
been reached.2 Without pursuing the argument further here, we may confine ourselves to the observation that in the absence of proof to the contrary there is no reason to doubt the young Isma'Il's good faith with regard to his ancestry before he ascended the throne. That such a conviction cannot simply be dismissed as absurd is evident from the clearly unobjectionable testimony of a poet who, around the middle of the 8th/14th century, praises the then master of the Ardabll order, Shaikh Sadr al-Dln, as having emerged from the sea of the
sayyids.3 Since, according to the doctrine of the Twelver Shl'a, what determines the legitimacy of a ruler is designation by a rightful predecessor (nass) and not so much his genealogy, no particular significance should really be attached to descent from 'All. Whether he is a sayyid or not, the man who seizes power without either nass or ijtihad is a usurper. This is a theory which still has its supporters today. Whether it is in fact applicable to the case of Isma'Il is, however, open to discussion. If it were, one would be obliged to deny the legitimacy even of his subjective claim to assume power. In that case the great significance the Safavids attached to their descent from 'All would matter only in terms of the respect it brought them, the great proximity to divine truth resulting from it and the justification of their claim to sinlessness ('isma). This presupposes, however, that Isma'Il actually knew of the paramount importance of designation, which is probably the very opposite of the case. No evidence from the intellectual and spiritual

THE SAFAVID STATE
sphere in which he lived, familiar to us both from the chronicles and from his own divan, supports the assumption that he had so sublime a knowledge of Shl'I theory. In the long run, of course, with the increasingly dominant influence of theology, the Safavids must have discovered the existence of this doctrine. Exactly when they became acquainted with it remains to be investigated, but in this context it is not so important. Suffice it to say that no knowledge of it can be attributed to Isma'Il in the summer of 907/1501. The probability, rather, is that on the one hand he considered himself eligible to succeed by virtue of his descent from Uzun Hasan, and on the other hand he saw his 'Alid lineage as giving him the advantage in legitimacy over his Aq Quyunlu cousins and other claimants.
These are the decisive criteria for judging whether Safavid rule was from the outset established on the basis of a fraudulent manoeuvre, the only mitigating circumstances for which would be the tender age of the dynasty's founder and the unscrupulousness of his confidential advisers. Since Isma'Il's character was not without its sinister traits — it is sufficient to recall the inconceivable cruelty with which he imposed his authority and his religious views — one is inclined to believe him capable of any other misdeed. Yet his ruthless treatment of genuine and potential adversaries has to be seen against the moral background of his time and his immediate environment, in which humanity, magnanimity and clemency could prove fatal and were of as little account as in the West during the same period. Clearly allowance has to be made for a different scale of moral values, although it would be going too far to assume a total absence of ethical norms.
These reflections do not, however, do full justice to Isma'Il's seizure of power, because they leave out of account certain irrational factors that played a considerable role. A first-rate reliable source for these is, as has been mentioned, KhataTs dlv3n, Khata'I being the pseudonym he used as a poet. This collection of poetry shows him to be a man of great religious ardour and strong mystical impulse, surely evidence of a centuries-old tradition of sufism prevalent in his family. This is certainly borne out by his first emergence as a public figure. The ecstatic fervour he exudes is striking and transmits itself in an even more intense form to his adherents. Recognisably messianic features find a lively echo in contemporary expectations of the return of the MahdI. It no more occurs to this religious revivalist to enquire into the theological minutiae of Shl'I doctrine than to trouble himself with the details of



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
what is essentially an established theory of succession, even assuming that he was familiar with it. For him, descent from 'All, of which at this stage at any rate he may have been convinced, must have been the decisive factor in his entitlement to rule. If he knew anything at all about the concept of nass, one must suppose that he either equated or confused it with membership of the family of the Prophet {dudmdri), in other words with descent from the Seventh Imam, Musa al-Kazim, to which the Safavids laid claim. After all, when he ascended the throne, he had likewise not hesitated to make Shi'ism the official religion of the state, in spite of the heretical notions expressed in his divan. The young master of a religious order, of Iranian rural stock but with forebears in Turkmen and Byzantine dynasties, seizes power, with the aid of fervently religious Turkmens, in Iran, a Persianspeaking country. He establishes a theocracy and proclaims a new faith, the Twelver Shi'a, of which his knowledge is so superficial that he can equate it with his own quite personal belief which, precisely
formulated, is a syncretism of metempsychotic Islam and Shamanism.1 Such is the situation at the outset of the Safavid empire, under the auspices of which Persia crosses the threshold of the modern era. Inevitably this start was associated with a plethora of complex political and religious problems. The dynasty was to have two and a half centuries in which to solve them. In view of the continued influence and effect of their achievements down to the present day, one can scarcely say that the Safavids and their subjects failed in this task, even if the disintegration and catastrophe that marked the end of their empire makes it impossible to speak of total success. It is probably more accurate to see the Safavid era as a significant phase in the struggle for their identity which the Persians had to undergo as they entered the modern age. Let us now return to the main problems which concern us, the antagonism between Persians and Turks, the religious developments and the changes in the monarchical system that occurred in Persia during this period. Without doubt the foundation of the Safavid state would have been impossible without the military effectiveness of the Qizilbash. There were also Qizilbash of non-Turkish descent, for
1 Melikoff, "Le probleme kizilbaj", p. 52, speaks of a Qizilbash variant of Shi'ism in Anatolia which also existed, in a much more archaic form, in Iranian Azarbaljan. Cf. also the phenomena discussed by Aubin, "La politique religieuse des Safavides", p. 257.

THE SAFAVID STATE
example Persians and Kurds,1 but their numbers were small, probably even minute. The vast majority of the disciples who flocked to the Ardabll order from the middle of the 9th/15 th century onwards were members of nomadic Turkmen tribes or at times probably Turkmen
peasants as well.2 Whether, as has been discussed above, these were ethnic groups which had no connection with the foregoing confederations, the Qara Quyunlu and the Aq Quyunlu, or whether on the
contrary they comprised to a large extent their ethnic rump,3 is a question that need not concern us here. What is important is the fact that Isma'Il's state so clearly bore the stamp of his Turkmen adherents that at first it scarcely differed from the principalities which preceded it and has justifiably been described as a direct continuation of them. Given the powerful impetus which animated the Qizilbash, their rise to political power ought in itself to have brought about a Turkicisation of Persia, but things took a different course. Even though fewer and fewer historians still maintain the view that the Safavid empire was a Persian national state, it is undeniably true that the state founded by Isma'Il was from the outset exposed to strong Iranicising tendencies, which ultimately led to the integration of the Tiirkmens. At all events there can be no question of a Turkicisation of Iran at the hands of the Safavids. How is this to be explained? To quote Minorsky, Tiirkmens and Persians, like oil and water, did not readily mix. According to him, the dualistic character of the population considerably affected both military and civil administration and can be seen, for example, in the dichotomy between Turkish "lords of the sword" and Persian "lords of the pen" which is mentioned in
chronicles.4 His diagnosis is accurate. The worst manifestation of antagonism between Persians and Turks had been eradicated within a century, but it would be utterly mistaken to ascribe this success to a gradual convergence of the two peoples. Rather was it the result of a lengthy and bloody confrontation which made the first half of the
1 Cf. Efendiev, "Le role des tribus". An example is Isma'Il I's famous vakil, Najm-i sanl. The Talish of north-west Persia referred to in Minorsky, Tadhkirat al-Mulik, p. 14, as supporters of
Isma'Il, were probably Qizilbash too. 2 Sumer, Safevt devktinin kuru/u{u, p. 213.
3 Siimer's remark ibid, that Isma'Il's Turkmen helpers were "Anatolian Turks ... completely distinct from the Qara Quyunlu and Aq Quyunlu confederations" cannot, of course, be taken to mean that elements belonging to these confederations were in no way involved in the foundation and rise of the Safavid empire. One has only to consider the Chepnl, to whom he himself refers and who had been part of the Aq Quyunlu confederation. Cf. Sohrweide, "Der Sieg der Safaviden", p. 121; Babinger, "Der Islam in Kleinasien", pp. 6jff.; Efendiev, "Le role des tribus". 4 Tadhkirat al-Muluk, p. 188.
343



THE SAFAVID PERIOD
Safavid era a time of ever recurring political crises both at home and abroad. These began immediately in the reign of Isma'Il I with constantly abortive attempts to combat the omnipotence of the Qizilbash generals by appointing an eminent Persian to the office of vakil, the shah's deputy with regard to his political and military functions. They culminated in massive revolts on the part of the Qizilbash during the reigns of Shah Tahmasp I and Shah Muhammad Khudabanda and in the murders of Queen Mahd-i 'Ulya (987/1579), mother of the subsequent Shah 'Abbas, and the Grand Vizier Mlrza Salman Jabirl (991/1583).! The final chapter of these dramatic events saw the destruction of Turkmen supremacy by Shah 'Abbas I in the course of a thorough reform of the armed forces carried out at the beginning of his reign. The Turkmen tribal aristocracy was stripped of all power, new types of weaponry were introduced and a regular corps established which can be regarded as the model and source of later efforts to create a standing army. One of the most significant consequences of the reform was the fact that members of the Georgian, Armenian and Circassian ethnic groups were now recruited to the armed forces and the highest offices of state. The reorganisation of the armed forces, completed by the end of the ioth/i6th century, also involved administrative and financial reforms. Payment of troops from the funds of the royal household replaced the feudal system on which the army had previously been based. Increasing numbers of provincial governorships, until now in the hands of Turkmen military commanders, were transformed into crown lands, with the result that their levies and taxes accrued to the shah and could be used for the maintenance of the new contingents. The destruction of Turkmen autonomy was not the only consequence of these measures. They also led to large-scale social change and restratification which still await closer investigation. Qizilbash tribes continued to exist, and some of their leaders even retained their posts as governors, but all in all the reform of the army constituted an advance along the road towards the integration of the Tiirkmens with the Persian population. Even in the 12th/18th century, Turkmen tribes still supplied Persia with royal dynasties like the Qajars whose rule

THE SAFAVID STATE
came to an end a mere fifty years ago. Alliances between Turkish and Persian elements - the example of Isma'H's marriage was repeatedly followed by his successors - in the long run became a possibility for wider circles in the community. Even more important was the fact that just as Persian and other non-Turkish dignitaries could, from the end of the ioth/i6th century onwards, occupy military commands and offices of state, so Turkmen tribesmen were able in time to play an
active part in various spheres of Persian cultural life.1 A few examples from the field of history alone will suffice: Sadiql Beg Afshar and Hasan Rumlu, both born shortly after 1530, and their younger contemporary, Iskandar Beg Turkman, usually known as Iskandar Munshi, one of the greatest historians of Islamic Persia.
One final consequence of the reform of the army needs to be emphasised. The ensuing transformation into crown lands of provinces previously ruled by governors lasted for decades, indeed until the time of Shah 'Abbas II (1052—77/1642—66), and went hand in hand with a strong policy of centralisation, affecting the administration and other spheres of life. This was of enormous importance for subsequent developments, even up to the present day. Ultimately it put an end to the polycentric system, inherited from the days of TTmur, which might have been of significance, especially in terms of artistic and intellectual development. A further contributory factor may have been 'Abbas I's decision to discontinue the practice of appointing the royal princes to governorships in particularly important provincial cities. At the start of Safavid rule, religious fanaticism, as we have seen, played a far more prominent part than theological knowledge, which would have been useful in confrontations with established Sunni theology. At that time Persia was a largely Sunni country, with numerous theologians of that persuasion. In the circumstances, the advisers of the new shah, and presumably Isma'Il himself, must quickly have recognised the disadvantages of their theological ignorance. Significant evidence of this is the search — albeit not exactly successful — for specialist literature on the subject, which is mentioned in a chronicle of the
period.2 Soon the situation changed as the call for Shl'i theologians was answered. They came from areas in which there was a Shl'I tradi

THE SAFAVID PERIOD
tion, from Bahrain and from the Jabal 'Amila in southern Lebanon, and brought Safavid religious views, which bore the imprint partly of popular piety and partly of the extremist currents of the early period of the empire, into line with the official tenets of the Twelver Shl'a. The extent to which they became respected in Persia can be judged, for example, from the fact that Shah 'Abbas the Great married the daughter of one of them, Shaikh Lutf-Allah MaisI from the Lebanese Mais al-Jabal, whose memory is kept aliveJm this day in what is one of the gems of Persian architecture, the little mosque on the Maidan-i Shah in Isfahan which is named after him. However, not all the consequences of this increase in the influence of Shl'I theology proved welcome to the Safavids. The concept of divine right, so important to the shah's reputation, especially amongst large numbers of the common people, had no place in the doctrines of the Shl'I theologians. They, of course, were familiar with the theory of nass, according to which any representative of the departed Imam needed to be designated by a legitimate predecessor. They were only too aware that the Safavids had not been designated in this way and could not make up for this deficiency by claiming descent from the Prophet. The dynasty had thus usurped the power which rightfully belonged to the mujtahid of the time. At first the theologians probably acquiesced in this without too much difficulty since both they and, of course, the mujtahid enjoyed a better position under the Safavids than under any SunnI regime, however magnanimous. As their activities gradually influenced the beliefs and religious practices of the population, and the official doctrines of the Twelver Shi'a supplanted the heresy introduced by Isma'Il, so the shah lost the preeminent position he had held previously in religious matters. Eventually, by the end of the nth/17th century, he retained only executive power, and the people showed a greater devotion to the mujtahid. There is therefore a certain parallel here with previously discussed developments within the Safavid order, in which the khalifat al-khulafa was able to assert his superiority over the shah in his capacity as murshid-i kamil. More than a century later, the Qajars, who after decades of indecision finally resolved to grant the Shl'I theologians ('ulama) their former privileged status, thus hoping to give their rule the semblance of legitimacy, were also disappointed. The theologians could not change their fundamental beliefs. Monarchs, no matter whether they were Safavids or Qajars, were and remained in their eyes usurpers. Instead of supporting those
346



THE SAFAVID STATE
to whom they owed a debt of gratitude, they contributed, in the case of both dynasties, to their downfall. Shah 'Abbas I may well have realised where things were leading. His ostentatious displays of religious devotion — from his visit to the shrine at Ardabll to his pilgrimage to Mashhad — were primarily designed, although genuine religious motives cannot be ruled out, to establish a healthy relationship between monarchy and the Shl'a. In vain: it fell to him not only to destroy the might of the Qizilbash; he was also the instigator of the most important measures of social discrimination against the sufls, which, according to the testimony of foreign travellers, had taken effect by the middle of the nth/17th century. Within his own lifetime Shah 'Abbas I was to witness the triumph in Persia of the representatives of Shl'i orthodoxy, beginning with his famous contemporary Mir Damad (d. 1630). The idea of the sanctity of the monarch had fallen into decay, the heretical beliefs of his greatgrandfather had been banished and the Safavid order had declined.
One of the things modern-day Persia inherited from the Safavids had been the tradition of monarchy. Although initially it had taken the form of kingship by divine right, towards the end of the Safavid era the monarchy shed more and more of its supernatural aspects until ultimately it was completely devoid of them. Subsequent ruling dynasties held fast to the principle of monarchy but did not revive the idea of the shah as God incarnate. The Safavids, as we have seen, were obliged to pursue unconventional policies in order to achieve a reconciliation between the indigenous Iranians and the Turkmens their ancestors and they themselves had brought to the country, two ethnic groups with which they were, of course, linked by descent. Although they were unable to eradicate all antagonism between the two, they certainly managed to remove the most important obstacles to a reconciliation. Finally, it was as a result of their endeavours that Persia became a Shl'I country, which it has remained to the present day. Two attempts to abolish the Shl'a failed, the first under Shah Isma'Il II around 984/15 76, the second a hundred and sixty years later under Nadir Shah. The introduction of the Shl'a to Iran is the most striking contribution of the Safavids to modern-day Persia because it is the factor that most clearly distinguishes the country from its neighbours.

CHAPTER 6
THE SAFAVID ADMINISTRATIVE
SYSTEM
Before the principal phases in the development of the Safavid administrative system are discussed in detail, a brief outline of the Safavid administrative and social structure may be helpful. At the apex of this structure was the shah. Never was the Divine Right of Kings more fully developed than by the Safavid shahs. Shah Isma'Il I, who established the Safavid dynasty in 907/1501—2, considered himself to be the living emanation of the godhead, the Shadow of God upon earth, and the representative of the Hidden Imam by virtue of direct descent from the Seventh Imam of the Twelver (Ithna'ashariyya) Shl'a, Mvisa al-Kazim. It is axiomatic that such a ruler would command instant and unquestioning obedience from his subjects. Since the ruler was directly appointed by God, men were required to obey his commands whether just or unjust. Since the ruler, as the representative of the Hidden Imam, was closer to the source of absolute truth than were other men, opposition to him was a sin. This led inevitably to an assumption of kingly infallibility. In other words, the Safavid shahs usurped the function which the Ithna'asharl mujtahids had arrogated to themselves, namely, that of acting as the representative on earth of the Mahdi, the Ithna'asharl messiah. The net result of these various Safavid theories of kingship was
absolutism.1 In practice, however, there were well defined limits to this absolutism, even when the shah was a strong and capable ruler. Chardin declares emphatically that outside court circles there was no arbitrary exercise of power by the shah, and both Chardin and Malcolm assert that the awe in which the shah was held by the court and the nobility was the primary reason for the relative security and freedom from oppression enjoyed by the lower classes. Minorsky has written: "It is a moot question how the idea of the State, if ever distinctly realised, was expressed in Safavid terminology". Though the term daulat was sometimes used as an abstract concept, he says, the nearest equivalent in a concrete sense was mamdlik-i mahrusa,
the "divinely-protected dominions".2 This rather extreme statement

THE SAFAVID ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
must now be modified. There is abundant evidence that, long before the end of the Safavid period, the concept of the territories under Safavid jurisdiction as a state had crystallised into a more concrete form. During the reign of Shah Sulaiman (1077-1105/1666-94), the term mamlikat-i Iran is found, but the historian Iskandar Beg MunshI, writing in 102 5/1616-17, frequently uses terms of a similar nature with reference to the Safavid state at the time of Shah Tahmasp I (930—84/1524-76): mulk-i Iran; mamalik-i Iran; 'arsa-yi Iran (the last of these perhaps more geographical than political). Even if Iskandar Beg Munshi's use of these terms in regard to the reign of Shah Tahmasp represents a case of prolepsis, it nevertheless indicates that, by the time of Shah 'Abbas I at least, Safavid rule had led to the emergence of a more definite concept of a state operating within fairly welldefined boundaries. The meaning of daulat, now the ordinary word for state, gradually evolved from the rather abstract concept of the "bliss" or "felicity" of the ruler, the aura of beneficence which surrounded him and sheltered his subjects, and came to be used in a more concrete sense. Roemer has pointed out that the existence of Iran as an administrative entity was acknowledged by the Ottomans from the time of the establishment of the Safavid state. A letter to Shah Isma'Il I from the Ottoman sultan Bayezld II refers to him as pddishah-i Iran.1
The administrative organisation of the Safavid state was divided both horizontally, along ethnic lines, and vertically, by Barthold's classic "red thread", namely, "the division of all the organs of administration into two main categories, the dargdh (palace) and divan (chan
cery)".2 On the ethnic plane, the Qizilbash, the Turkmen tribes which had been mainly responsible for bringing the Safavids to power, constituted the military aristocracy of the Safavid state, the "men of the sword" in traditional Islamic terms. The amirs, or chiefs of these tribes, were the military governors of most of the provinces of the Safavid empire during its early period. They filled the most important offices of state, and held a dominant position in political as well as in military affairs. This state of affairs they considered to be no more than their due in view of their services to the Safavid cause. Differing from

THE SAFAVID ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
the Qizilbash in race, language and culture were the Tajiks, or Persian elements of society, the descendants of those who had traditionally filled the ranks of the bureaucracy under a succession of alien Arab, Turkish, Mongol and Tartar rulers. From the Tajik elements were drawn not only the viziers and the numerous classes of officials in the royal secretariat, but also the accountants, the clerks, the tax-collectors and other officials of the financial administration, and, in general, the "men of the pen" of classical Islamic society. In addition, the majority of the members of the religious classes ('u/amd): the mujtahids, the qddis, the sayyids, the khatibs, and other functionaries of the religious institution, were Persians. The few who were originally of Arab blood had become thoroughly assimilated in the course of time, and thought of themselves as Tajiks. The head of the religious institution, the sadr, was always a Persian. The administrative organisation of the Safavid state remained fluid during the whole of the period prior to the accession of Shah 'Abbas I (996/1588). Even when the actual administrative institutions assumed more rigid forms in the course of the administrative reorganisation carried out by 'Abbas I, some lateral mobility still existed, and officials were able to cross the boundary between the religious institution and the political institution with comparative ease. During the early Safavid period, the divan, or mamdlik, branch was predominant. From the time of Shah 'Abbas I onwards, however, the power of that branch of the administration which was under the personal control of the ruler (in Safavid terminology: kbdssa) increased at the expense, and to the detriment, of the mamalik branch. Eventually (1077/1666-7), even the office of sadr was divided into a khassa and an 'dmma (i.e., mamalik) branch. The everyday business of the state was transacted by a council {divan;
later: jdnqt) of high-ranking amirs {arkan-i daulat; umard-yi 'dlijdb; etc.). The vizier iya^Jr) was a member of this council. Later, other officials were nominated to it. They included an official known as the majlisnivis, or vdqi'a-nivis, sometimes termed the va^tr-i chap, because he stood on the left of the shah, whereas the vizier proper stood on the shah's right. This official had three functions: he was the official court historiographer; he was the shah's private secretary; and, most import
ant of all, he was a rapporteur to the shah.1 In this last capacity he was

in effect the head of a widespread intelligence system. The council of amirs was presided over by the shah, or, in his absence, by the vakil-i nafs-i nafis-i humayiin (later, by the i'timdd al-dauld). The amirs who were members of the council resided at court. If any of them held another office in addition, such as a provincial governorship, he would delegate that function to his son, or to another amir from his own tribe. The head of the bureaucracy was the vizier. He had at his command a large staff of viziers of lesser rank, secretaries, and other officials, each of whom was in charge of a branch of the vizier's department, which was called the daftarkhdna-yi humayiin, or royal secretariat. No letter of appointment to a post in the bureaucracy was valid without the vizier's seal. The various branches of his department dealt with such matters as the authorisation of assignments on the revenue, grants, pensions and immunities of many different kinds; the payment of troops, and the. keeping of muster-rolls and other military records; and the keeping of
the archives.1 Financial matters were ultimately the responsibility of the vizier, but the technical business of preparing and auditing the budget, assessing taxes (which were many and varied), and collecting the revenue — in short, the actual operation of the financial machine — was in the hands of a large staff of accountants, clerks, tax-collectors and financial agents under the control of the mustaufi al-mamdlik, the comptroller of
finance.2 As the khassa side of the administration expanded, the office of istlfd-yi mamdlik, like the saddrat, was divided, and the financial business of the khassa branch was conducted by an official termed mustaufi-yi khassa. In the final analysis, however, the latter seems to have been inferior in rank to the mustaufi al-mamalik. The administration of the royal household was carried on by a separate department, headed by the nd^ir-i buyutat, or superintendent of the royal workshops (buyutdt-i khdssa-yi sharifd), of which there were
eventually about thirty-three.3 "The artisans in the Royal Workshops
were organised in royal guilds",4 which continued to provide some of the court's needs. The royal workshops "made large profits for the Safavid Shahs; they not only produced goods such as textiles and rugs for the court, but also sent expensive silks and textiles to Europe and

India, and paid the profits made in this way to the Shah".1 Each royal workshop was in the charge of a sahib-jam' and a mushrij', and the nazir-i buyutat had in addition many other subordinate officials who assisted him in the discharge of his multifarious duties. These included: the preparation of an estimate of the expenditure of the royal household (which was then submitted to the central vizier for approval); agreeing on the price of, and signing contracts for, foodstuffs and other goods supplied to the royal household; the supervision of the day-to-day expenditure of the various royal workshops; the payment of the workmen employed in the said workshops; the maintenance of all the buildings connected with the royal household; and the general supervision of the management of the royal stables and the arsenal. The administration of the harem (haram) and the private quarters of the shah did not come within the purview of the nazir-i buyutat, but constituted an entirely separate branch, the internal palace administration, staffed mainly by eunuchs. The latter were initially all black eunuchs, but from the time of Shah 'Abbas I a number of white eunuchs, Georgian ghuldms, were employed in the palace. Not all the staff of the internal palace administration were eunuchs. The exceptions were: the royal physician; the royal astrologer; the comptroller of assay and other officials of the royal mint: and the keepers of various seals. All the officials of the internal palace administration were known under the general title of muqarrab al-khdqdn. Officials whose duties lay at the entrance to, or outside, the harem and the private quarters of the shah, were classified as muqarrab al-ba^rat. Included in this category were the officials of the department of the nazir-i buyutat, referred to above, and an extensive staff of doorkeepers, gentlemen-in-waiting, ushers, and
the like.2 The administration of justice was a complicated affair. During the early Safavid period the sadr, as head of the religious institution, was ultimately responsible for the administration of canon law. The business of the courts, however, was in the hands of a number of other religious officials in addition to the sadr, including the qddial-quddt and the shaikh al-isldm. As a result, there was a considerable degree of conflict of jurisdiction. At some point, not yet determined, a new post was created in an attempt to draw all these strands together under one overriding authority. The holder of this new office was termed
1 Ibid., p . 166. 2 Minorsky, Tadhkirat al-Muluk, pp. ;6ff.
355



THE SAFAVID ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
the divan-begt. Although the sadr was supposed to possess superior authority in cases involving capital offences, the fact that such crimes were tried in the divan-begl's tribunal indicates that the supreme authority, in these as in other legal matters, in fact lay with the dlvan-begl. In addition, the divan-begl's court was the highest court of appeal. By the time of Phase Three (as defined below) of the development of Safavid administrative institutions, or possibly earlier, officials such as the mustaufl al-mamalik, the nazir-i buyiitat, and the dlvan-begl, were classified as amirs of the highest rank, and consequently were admitted to membership of the council of amirs. By the end of the Safavid period, membership of this council stood at nineteen, but during the early period it was only about one-third of that size. Safavid administrative institutions derived from two main sources: the administrative institutions of the Tiirkmens and the Timurids rival dynasties which for a hundred years had disputed the succession to Tlmur's empire in Persia - and the basic sufl organisation of the Safaviyya, the militant Shl'I order which brought about the establishment of the Safavid state in 907/1501. Thus in part the Safavids were the inheritors of a bureaucratic system which resembled the traditional bureaucracy of a Persian Muslim state. The existence of the tightly-knit sufl organisation of the Safaviyya, however, constituted an essential point of difference between the Safavids and their predecessors. When Shah Isma'Il became the first ruler of the Safavid dynasty in 907/1501, he was faced with the problem of incorporating this sufl organisation in the administrative system of the Safavid state. In the event, the problem proved insuperable. As the Safavid administration system gradually evolved along more conventional lines, the remains of the original sufl organisation continued to exist as a system within a system, but as an organism devoid of any real function within the state. There are three main phases in the development of Safavid administrative institutions: first, the period between the accession of Shah Isma'Il I and that of Shah 'Abbas I (907-96/1501-88); second, the reign of Shah 'Abbas I (996-1038/15 88—1629); and third, the period from the accession of Shah SafI to the overthrow of the Safavid dynasty (1038-1135/1629-1722). The first period was one of change and adjustment, during which the functions of the principal officers of state were not clearly defined. As a result, the powers of one official frequently clashed with those of another. During the second period, the administration of the Safavid state was reorganised on entirely new

bases by Shah 'Abbas I. The third period is one of gradual sclerosis and consequent decline.
PHASE ONE ( 9 0 7 - 9 6 / 1 5 0 1 - 8 8 )
At his accession, Shah Isma'Il, as mentioned above, was confronted by the problem of fusing very dissimilar elements into one harmonious administrative system. On the one hand were his Qizilbash followers, the sufls of the Safavid order who had brought him to power. These men accorded Shah Isma'Il adoration as a quasi-divine figure, since they regarded him as the Shadow of God upon earth and the representative of the Hidden Imam. He was also, as head of the Safavid order, their murshid, and they, as his murtds, gave him unquestioning obedience. From the ranks of the Qizilbash were drawn the ahl-i ikhtisds, a small group of special staff officers, who maintained the Safaviyya on an active service footing during the years that Isma'Il was in hiding in Gllan (899-905/1494-9). These officers included a lala ("tutor",
"guardian"), an abddl, a dada, a khddim and a khalifat al-kbulafd. On the other hand were the Persian bureaucrats and 'ulama, many of whom had held secular and religious posts respectively under the predecessors of the Safavids. The task of combining a traditional mediaeval Muslim administrative system of the Persian type with what was in effect a theocratic organisation, would in any case have been a formidable one. It was rendered still more difficult by the fact that the elite of the Qizilbash fighting men were of Turkish stock, members of Turkmen tribes from eastern Anatolia and Syria, such as the Rumlu, Dulghadi'r, Takkalu, Ustajlu, and Shamlu. The mutual suspicion and hostility between the Turkish and Persian elements in the state split the Safavid administration irrevocably along ethnic lines. What steps did Isma'Il take in his attempt to effect a synthesis of these disparate elements? In the first place, he created the new office of vaktl-i nafs-i nafts-i humayiin. This official was to be the vicegerent of the shah and was to represent him both in his spiritual capacity (as murshid-i kamil of the Safaviyya) and his temporal capacity (as pddishdh). The powers of the vizier, traditionally the first minister and the head of the bureaucracy, were temporarily eclipsed by the overriding powers of this new official. The creation of this office clearly represented an attempt on the part of Isma'Il to bridge the gap between a theocratic form of govern
357



THE SAFAVID ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
ment and a bureaucratic one. It was only natural that the first incumbent should be one of the ahl-i ikhtisas, referred to above, the Turkmen officer Husain Beg Lala Shamlu. Secondly, Isma'Il attempted through the office of sadr to forge a link between the political institution, which in the early Safavid period had a markedly military character and was dominated by the Turkmen aristocracy, and the religious institution, the Persian 'ulama. The office of sadr had been inherited from the administrative system of the Timurids and the Turkmen dynasties, but the scope and purpose of the office under the Safavids was quite different. The chief function of the Safavid sadr, who was, of course, always a Persian, was the imposition of doctrinal uniformity throughout the Safavid state, and, as a corollary, the extirpation of heresy. This goal had largely been achieved by the end of Isma'Il's,reign in 930/1524. By establishing that the sadarat was subordinate to the political institution, Isma'Il hoped to prevent that separation of secular and religious powers which in fact occurred under his successors. The predominantly military character of the early Safavid state is again shown by the fact that the sadrs often held military rank and not infrequently military command. At the critical battle of Chaldiran in 920/1514, for instance, the entire Safavid centre was under the command of sadrs and other members of the religious classes. The other principal offices of state during the early Safavid period were those of the amir al-umard, the qurchi-bdsht, and the vizier. The office of amir al-umara, or commander-in-chief of the Qizilbash tribal forces, was considered by the Qizilbash to be their prerogative. Apart from his military duties, this officer was one of the great amirs of the supreme divan and played a considerable part in the affairs of state. Although, because of the predominantly military character of the Safavid state during this first phase, the terms "military" and "civil" cannot be used with precision in defining the functions of particular officials, it is clear that the amir al-umara was primarily a "military" officer who encroached on the prerogatives of the vizier and other topranking officials of the bureaucracy, to the extent permitted by the prevailing political situation. In the event that the shah was weak or a minor, the amir al-umara and the leading Qizilbash amirs assumed full control of the machinery of government. Another high-ranking military officer was the qurchl-bashl, who later superseded the amir al-umara. During the early Safavid period, however, we hear little of
558



PHASE ONE ( 9 O 7 - 9 6 / 1 5 O I - 8 8 )
the qurchl-bashl, and his function, which was distinct from that of the amir al-umara, remains obscure. Finally, we have the vizier, whose powers were drastically diminished during the early Safavid period by the creation of the office of vakll-i nafs-i nafls-i humayun, by the interference of the amir al-umara in political affairs, and even by the activities of the sadr, who, by virtue of his special role in the Safavid administrative system, wielded greater power than did his predecessors in the Turkmen and Timurid administrations. Almost from the start, however, there were indications that the Turco-Persian condominium was not working smoothly. It seems clear that Isma'Il made a mistake in allotting to one man, Husain Beg Lala Shamlu, the two most important offices of state, that of vakll-i nafs-i nafls-i humayun and that of amir al-umara, so that too much power was concentrated in the hands of one individual. Isma'Il's realisation of this fact can be seen in his dismissal of Husain Beg from the vikalat only six years after the establishment of the Safavid state. From then on Isma'Il, as a matter of deliberate policy, excluded the Qizilbash from the vikalat, and Husain Beg was followed by a succession of five Persian vakils between 913/1508 and 930/1524. But if Isma'Il thought to balance the power of a Persian vakil against that of a Turkmen amir al-umara, he was mistaken again. There was an immediate and violent reaction on the part of the Qizilbash against the appointment of Persians to the vikalat. Of the five Persian vakils mentioned above, two were murdered by the Qizilbash, a third met his death as the direct result of the hostility between himself and the Qizilbash, and the remaining two held office for only two years each. The decisive defeat suffered by the Safavids at the hands of the Ottomans at Chaldiran in 920/1514 had far-reaching effects, not only on the character and behaviour of Isma'Il himself, but on his relations with the Qizilbash amirs. This in turn affected the relative importance of the principal administrative offices, and the relations between the Persian and Turkish elements in the administration. Although the Qizilbash amirs had suffered heavy losses at Chaldiran, Isma'lPs virtual withdrawal from the conduct of both military and administrative affairs enabled the survivors to strengthen their position vis-a-vis the ruling institution, namely, the shah. An even more important effect of Chaldiran was the tacit assumption by the Qizilbash that their murshid's reputation for infallibility and invincibility was now in ruins. From the time of Chaldiran onwards, the Qizilbash by their actions demonstrated incontrover
359



THE SAFAVID ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
tibly that they considered that they need no longer in practice accord the shah the unquestioning obedience demanded of a murld by his murshid. More and more their behaviour resembled that of turbulent barons, and, when Shah Isma'il I died in 930/1524 and was succeeded by Shah Tahmasp, who was only ten and a half years old, they took advantage of the shah's youthfulness to assert their own power at the expense of the monarch. In the course of their internecine struggles to determine which tribe or coalition of tribes should rule the state, they showed so little respect for the shah's person or position that there were armed clashes between rival groups even in the presence of the shah, whose life was on one occasion endangered. The fiction of their loyalty to their spiritual director was maintained, however, and as late as 1629 Shah 'Abbas I was still recognised in theory as the murshid-i kamil. By the end of the reign of Isma'il, important changes had taken place in regard to three of the principal offices of state. First, after 920/1514, the term vakll-i nafs-i nafls-i humayun was abandoned, and the vikalat was referred to in terms more appropriate to the vizierate. There is no doubt that this marks the failure of the attempt to create in the person of the vakll-i nafs-i nafis-i humayun a superior authority who would be able, because he was the alter ego of the shah both in his spiritual and in his temporal capacity, to harmonise and co-ordinate the activities both of the political institution and of the religious institution. It marks, further, a decisive movement away from the concept of a theocratic state, and towards that separation of religious and temporal powers which became an accomplished fact under the later Safavids. Second, the task of imposing doctrinal uniformity, which had been the justification for the extraordinary powers wielded by the early Safavid sadrs, was virtually completed by the end of Isma'lPs reign, and consequently there was from then on a progressive decline in the authority of the sadr, who had less and less influence in political matters. Third, Isma'il himself had taken steps to curb the power of the amir al-umara by appointing to that office in 915/1509—10 an officer of inferior rank. This proved effective, since the officer in question, although he held the office for fifteen years, does not figure prominently in the events of that period. In 930/15 24, the evolution of Safavid administrative institutions was rudely interrupted when the Qizilbash amirs seized control of the state from the youthful Tahmasp. For a period of ten years, different Qizilbash tribes, ruling either separately or in alliance with others,
360



PHASE ONE ( 9 0 7 - 9 6 / 1 5 0 1 - 8 8 )
dominated the scene. The imposition of military government naturally had its effect on the Safavid administration. The Qizilbash had always considered the vikalat to be their prerogative, and the new rulers of the state dubbed themselves vakil (but not, be it noted, vakil nafs-i nafls-i humayiin) and/or amir al-umara. By vakil they wished to indicate a rank superior to that of the vizier, who was a Persian and therefore, in their eyes, inferior and only fit to hold positions in the civil service. During this period, the fluidity of the administrative system was such that the sources often refer to two officials as vakil simultaneously. This causes some confusion, but the military and political aspect of the vakil's function is always uppermost in the one, and the administrative and bureaucratic aspect is predominant in the other. The former is always a Turkmen and may also hold the office of amir al-umara. The latter is always a Persian, and his office may also be referred to as the vizierate or ni%arat-i divdn-i 'all.
About 940/1533, Shah Tahmasp succeeded in imposing his authority on the Qizilbash amirs. The immediate effect of the shah's assertion of himself as the ruling institution was the decline of the amir al-umara. In fact this officer disappears from the list of the officials of the central administration (although the title amir al-umara continued to be applied to the Qizilbash military governors of important provinces, particularly in times of crisis, up to the end of the reign of Shah 'Abbas I). His disappearance was accompanied by the rise of the qurchl-bashi, a formerly subordinate officer, to the position of commander-in-chief of the Qizilbash forces. Like the amir al-umara before him, the qurchl-bashi exercised his authority in political as well as in military affairs. During a period of some forty years (95 5-95/1548-87) prior to the accession of Shah 'Abbas I, the majority of the qurchl-bashls were drawn from the Afshar Turkmen tribe. In addition, a marked hereditary tendency became apparent in appointments to this office. At first sight, this might suggest that the power of the qurchl-bashi was increasing. Although this may possibly be true in regard to individual qurchl-bashls, I would suggest that both these tendencies reflect a weakening of the position of the Qizilbash as a whole within the state, and in their position relative to the shah. With the abandonment of the concept of the vakll-i nafs-i nafls-i humayiin, and the disappearance of the amir al-umara, the qurchl-bashi had emerged as the most powerful military officer in the state. If the Qizilbash were prepared to allow this office to be monopolised by one tribe, several conclusions may be drawn. First, during this
361



THE SAFAVID ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
period the Qizilbash were not prepared to challenge the authority of the shah, a complete reversal of the position obtaining during the first decade of Tahmasp's reign. Second, the Qizilbash tribes which had formerly been most prominent - the Shamlu, the Ustajlu, the Takkalu and the Rumlii — had either been weakened, or discredited, or both, by the decade of civil wars (930-40/1524-33). Thus the way had been opened for a hitherto less important tribe, the Afshar, to come to the fore. Third, the fact that the more powerful tribes acquiesced in the appointment of a succession of Afshars to the office of qurchl-bashl again suggests that the shah's will now prevailed. Another significant trend during the reign of Tahmasp I (930—84/15 24—76) was the continued decline in the power of the sadr. With the successful establishment of Ithna'asharl Shi'ism as the "orthodox" form of Islam throughout the Safavid dominions, the special powers which had been conferred on the sadr at the inception of the Safavid state became less necessary. The sadrs ceased to play any significant part in political affairs and were largely preoccupied with routine religious matters, particularly the administration of the auqdf (bequests and endowments for pious purposes). Even their position as head of the religious institution was not secure, and there are certain portents during the latter part of Tahmasp's reign of what became an established fact by the time of 'Abbas I, namely the eclipse of the sadr by the powerful theologians known as mujtahids, who emerged as the exponents of Shl'I orthodoxy as it assumed more rigid doctrinal forms. Finally, we may note the increased power and prestige of the vizier after the shah had brought the Qizilbash amirs to heel about 940/1533. During the preceding decade, the viziers had been mere tools in the hands of the "military" vakil/amir al-umara. To sum up, we may recapitulate the following characteristics of the Safavid administrative system under Tahmasp I: a continued movement away from the theocratic form of government associated with Safavid origins; a greater separation of temporal and spiritual powers; an increase, after an initial setback, in the authority of the ruling institution (the shah) and a corresponding curtailment of the influence of the Qizilbash in political affairs. In the second half of Tahmasp's reign, the introduction into the Safavid state of elements of different ethnic origin, namely Georgians and Circassians, also militated against the Qizilbash supremacy. This will be considered in the next section.

PHASE TWO ( 9 9 6 - I O 3 8/l 5 8 8 - 1 6 2 9 )
It was stated above that Shah 'Abbas the Great reorganised the Safavid state on entirely new bases. Why was it necessary to do this? Briefly, Shah 'Abbas was forced to take drastic action to preserve the fabric of the state. In 982/15 74 Shah Tahmasp's physical powers began to fail, and this was the signal for the recrudescence of Qizilbash dissension. Tahmasp's death in 984/1576 was followed by more than a decade of disastrous government by Isma'Il II and Muhammad Khudabanda, neither of whom was capable of effective rule. Various power groups took advantage of the situation to pursue their particular ends at the expense of the state, which was rent by their faction. The situation in 982/1574, however, differed from that obtaining in 932/1526 in one important respect. In 15 26 the precarious balance between the Turkish and Persian elements in the administration had been upset when the Qizilbash seized control of the state, and the object of the civil wars which followed had been to decide which Qizilbash tribe, or tribal coalition, should dominate the rest. It was, so to speak, a domestic quarrel. In 15 74 and subsequent years, however, the point at issue was whether the Qizilbash could maintain their privileged position in the state in the face of the threat posed by the new Georgian and Circassian elements which were beginning to oust them from administrative posts. Where had these new elements come from? In the main, they were prisoners, or the offspring of prisoners, taken captive in four Caucasian campaigns fought by the Safavids between 947/15 40— 1 and 961/i 5 5 3—4, and brought back to Persia. The rivalries of Georgian and Circassian women in the royal harem led to dynastic struggles based on ethnic considerations, of a type hitherto unknown in the Safavid state. Not all the Georgians were captives taken in battle. Some Georgian noblemen voluntarily entered Safavid service, and before the end of Tahmasp's reign we hear of one such who held a provincial governorship. In addition to anarchy at home, Shah 'Abbas was faced at his accession by a war on two fronts against the arch-enemies of the Safavid state, the Ottomans and the Uzbeks. The former had taken advantage of Persia's internal weakness to occupy more Safavid territory in the north-west than ever before; the latter had overrun Khurasan in the north-east. 'Abbas had therefore to restore internal stability and then to expel the invaders from Persian soil.
363



THE SAFAVID ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
In order to do this, 'Abbas desperately needed troops on whose loyalty he could rely. After enduring more than a decade of Qizilbash plots, intrigue and treachery, he decided he could place no further trust in them. He therefore formed, from the ranks of the Georgians and Circassians referred to above, several regiments of a new standing army, owing allegiance only to himself, and paid direct from the royal treasury. These men were known as ghulams, i.e. "slaves" of the shah. This decision meant that a new source of income had to be found for the royal treasury. Hitherto the Qizilbash troops, which had constituted the greater part of the Safavid armies, had been paid by their Turkmen chiefs, who formed the military aristocracy of the early Safavid state and held all the important provincial governorships. The provincial governments were largely alienated from the control of the central government, and the provincial governors held the land under their jurisdiction in the form of assignments of various types, known by the general term ttyiil. They consumed on the spot the greater part of the revenue which they derived from these assignments, and remitted only a small portion, in the form of dues of various kinds, to the central government. Even then these funds were not under the direct control of the shah but were administered by a special "ministry of state lands". The shah's main source of income was crown lands, the revenues from which were collected by the royal agents. The solution adopted by Shah 'Abbas was to increase the revenue remitted to the royal treasury by converting some mamalik or "state" lands into khassa or crown lands. This policy was extended by his successors to such an extent that it became one of the principal causes of Safavid
decline.1 Not all the ghulams were trained for service in the newly-created regiments. Many were employed in the royal household and in the khassa administration in general. The latter necessarily expanded as it took over the administration of more and more state lands. Gradually the ghulams made their presence felt at the higher levels of Safavid administration until they filled about one-fifth of the high administrative posts. Governorships of the khassa provinces went to ghulams rather than to Qizilbash. Finally, in 1007/1598, a ghulam, AllahvardI Khan, was appointed commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The old dichotomy between Turk and Persian had been further complicated by
1 Lambton, Landlord and Peasant, pp. 107—9.
364



PHASE TWO ( 9 9 6 - I O 3 8 / 1 5 8 8 - 1 6 2 9 )
the emergence of the Caucasian elements as a powerful "third force". The numbers involved make it clear that Shah 'Abbas had, in fact, effected a social revolution. For instance, in 1013/1604 20,000 Armenians were enrolled in the ghulams. In 1025/1616 130,000 Georgian prisoners were brought back to Persia. In addition, in order to weaken tribal cohesion and to break down rigid social patterns, 'Abbas moved large groups of Qizilbash tribesmen from one area to another and settled large groups of Caucasian immigrants in strategic areas. As one would expect, this social revolution produced major changes in the administrative system. The abortive attempt by a Qizilbash amir, at the beginning of the reign of Shah 'Abbas, to constitute himself an old-style vakil represented the last bid by the Qizilbash to regain their former position of dominance in the administration. When Shah 'Abbas crushed this attempt, the title of vakil lapsed, as to all intents and purposes did that of amir al-umara in so far as it denoted an officer of the central administration. Instead of these titles, associated specifically with the period of Qizilbash supremacy, we find the commanders of two of the new regiments ranked among the six principal officers of state, namely the qullar-dqdsi and the tufangcbi-dqdsi. The former commanded the regiment of qullar, or ghulams, and the latter commanded the regiment of musketeers. The commander of the Qizilbash forces still retained the title of qurchi-bashl, but since the Qizilbash constituted only one element of the Safavid army as reconstituted by Shah 'Abbas, his influence in military and political affairs was necessarily curtailed. At best, he was now primus inter pares. The greater centralisation of the administration under 'Abbas is reflected in the improved status of the vizier, the head of the bureaucracy and leader of the Persian elements in the administration. As a token of this new status, the vizier was commonly referred to as i'timad al-daula ("trusty support of the state") or sadr-i a'%am ("exalted seat of honour"). The sadr (with whom the sadr-i a'zam should not be confused) remained the head of the religious institution, but his position, as we saw above, was increasingly challenged by the mujtahids. The sixth and last of the principal officers of the realigned administration was the isblk-dqdsi-bdshi-yi divdn, who was naturally a Qizilbash amir and whose duties as Grand Marshal were largely of a ceremonial nature. The measure of the achievement of Shah 'Abbas I - and for this reason alone he is deservedly called "the Great" - is that the administrative system of the Safavid state, as reorganised by him, continued to
365



THE SAFAVID ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
function for a century after his death, more or less under its own momentum because his successors, with the exception of 'Abbas II, were weak and incompetent rulers. One must point out, however, that the germs of future decay were present in this system. The pernicious effect of the extension of the khassa system has already been mentioned. The reasons why it was pernicious are not hard to seek. Granted that the old-style Qizilbash military governors consumed the greater part of the provincial revenue in situ, and remitted little to the state coffers. But precisely because they enjoyed the use of this revenue it was in their own interests to maintain a flourishing economy in the area under their jurisdiction, and not so to tax the province that prosperity declined and the amount of revenue consequently decreased. In the khassa provinces, on the other hand, the taxes were farmed by the shah's agents or intendants, who had no material interest in the province in question, and whose sole concern was to increase the amount remitted to the royal treasury; by pleasing the shah in this way they ensured that they would retain their own jobs. The more rapacious the shah and his viziers, the harsher the burden of taxation imposed on the population of the khassa provinces. In contrast to the position obtaining in the mamalik provinces, little if any of the revenue collected from the khassa provinces was ever used to support the economy of those provinces. The second major cause of subsequent decay was the growth of the haram system. In the first phase of Safavid development it had been the practice for the shah to appoint his sons to provincial governorships. While they were still minors, the royal princes were placed under the guardianship of a Qizilbash amir, termed lala (or, less commonly, atabeg, an echo of Saljuq practice). The lala was responsible for the moral and physical education of the prince committed to his charge, and the latter thus received a training which fitted him to take his place if need be, as ruler of the Safavid empire. In particular, he received first-hand training in the conduct of political and military affairs. The obvious danger inherent in this system was that an ambitious prince, or an overweening amir, might seek to anticipate events by rebelling against the ruler. But when one observes the moral and physical degeneration of the dynasty which resulted from the practice, instituted by 'Abbas I, of confining the royal princes to the harem, and entrusting their training to the court eunuchs, one is bound to feel that the possibility of treachery was the lesser of two evils.
366



PHASE THREE ( 1 0 3 8 - I I 3 5 / 1 6 2 9 — 1 7 2 2 )
PHASE THREE ( 1 0 3 8 - I I 3 5 / 1 6 2 9 - 1 7 2 2 )
Almost a century elapsed between the death of Shah 'Abbas I and the usurpation of the Safavid throne by the Afghans. It was a period of gradual but continuous decline. This decline was checked, but not stopped, by Shah 'Abbas II (1052—77/1642—66). 'Abbas II was a strong ruler, who asserted his authority as the ruling institution. During his reign, however, the policy of bringing state (mamalik) lands under the direct administration of the crown was not only continued but extended. It has already been pointed out that this policy contributed largely to Safavid decline. Apart from the harmful effects resulting from the impersonal and oppressive administration of the khassa provinces by the shah's intendants, the loss of each successive mamalik province meant a proportionate reduction in the number of the Qizilbash, and a consequent decline in Safavid military strength. Although the Georgian and other ghulam regiments were loyal to the shah - indeed, by the end of the nth/17th century they were almost the only troops on whose loyalty he could rely as fighting men — they were not comparable to the Qizilbash. In many cases, too, the reduction in the Qizilbash strength was not made good by a corresponding increase in the numbers of the ghulams. During the first phase of Safavid administrative development, the whole administrative system had a pronounced military character, as we have seen, and bureaucrats who had no military function had little influence. In Phase Two, Shah 'Abbas broke the power of the Qizilbash, and as a consequence of this, and of the increased centralisation of government, the power of the bureaucracy grew. In Phase Three, the transformation was completed. The military arm was weakened to the point where it was no longer possible to check the incursions of marauding tribesmen from Baluchistan and Afghanistan. At the same time, the bureaucracy expanded in size, and became more rigid in its organisation and operation, until it resembled the complex and ponderous machine described in the Ta^kirat al-muluk, a manual of Safavid administration, unique of its kind among Persian historical records, completed about 1726. The vizier became the most powerful officer of state and, in conjunction with the court and the harem, exercised undue influence over a succession of weak and debauched shahs. We have already noted, in Phase Two, an increasing tendency
367



THE SAFAVID ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
towards the separation of spiritual and temporal powers. In Phase Three, the separation between the political institution and the religious institution became complete. No longer subject to overriding political control, the religious classes tightened their grip on the nation, and their power reached its zenith during the reign of the two weakest Safavid shahs, Sulaiman and Sultan Husain, who together ruled forfifty-sixyears (1077-1135/1666-1722). Particularly during the reign of the latter, the mujtahids, who had only reluctantly conceded the claim of the Safavid shahs to be the representatives of the Hidden Imam, took advantage of the weakness of the political institution to reassert their independence of it and to regain their prerogative as the representatives of the MahdI. Some sources even suggest a period of "direct religious rule by means of
a concourse of mujtahids above the monarch".1 As E.G.Browne put it, the domination of the state by the "great ecclesiastics" "hardly made for
either spiritual unity or national efficiency".2 The founder of the Safavid state, Isma'Il I, had recognised the potential dangers to the fabric of the state which would flow from unbridled intervention by the 'ulama in political, economic and military affairs. It was for this reason that he had made the sadr a political appointee, charged with ensuring that the religious classes remained subject to political direction. This system worked only as long as the shah maintained a strong hand at the helm. According to Sir John Malcolm, however, under Shah Sultan Husain the "meekness and bigotry" of the shah "proved more destructive to his country than the vices of Soliman [Shah Sulaiman: 1077—1105/ 1666—1694]. So great was his pious zeal, that none but Moollahs [mu/Jds], or holy Syuds [sayyids], were appointed to high stations .. -High nobles gave place, with feelings of resentment, to eunuchs and priests; but their
discontent was only vented in complaints."3 Up to the time of Shah Sulaiman, the prosperous multicultural Safavid state, in which "strangers were encouraged and protected, and foreigners from every quarter of the globe, but particularly Europe,
resorted to Persia"4, continued to exist. Under Shah Sultan Husain, however, the position of the Armenian merchants, whose commercial and financial expertise had contributed much to Safavid economic prosperity, declined greatly, since the shah was too weak to protect

them from the "rapacious ministers and bigoted priests of his court"1. During the second half of the 17th century, the status of the sadr, an officer whose function was closely connected with the original concept of the Safavid state during Phase One, continued to decline. Shah 'Abbas II had deliberately restricted the power of the sadr, and in 1077/1666-7 the sadarat had been divided into a khassa and an 'amma (mamalik) branch, a step which accurately reflected the current division of the Safavid administration and indicated that the sadr was no longer an official of the first importance. From the beginning of the reign of Sultan Husain (1105/1694) at least, and possibly earlier, the supreme
religious official was the mulla-bashi.2 The sadrs, however, continued to be primarily responsible for the administration of the auqaf and also assisted the qadls in various juridical functions.
PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION
The provincial governments were, to a large extent, replicas in miniature of the central government. Some of the principal officers of the central government had their counterparts at the courts of provincial governors. Foremost among these were the vizier and the sadr. The provincial viziers and sadrs were, in general, appointed by the shah and not by the central vizier and central sadr respectively. If the provincial governor had more than one province under his jurisdiction, or if his province was of exceptional importance, the vizier who was in attendance at the seat of the provincial governor frequently controlled the activities of other viziers, subordinate to himself, who were resident at other large provincial centres. To denote the superior rank of the former, the term va%jr-i kull was used. In appointing viziers and sadrs to the provincial administrations, the Safavids were once again following the practice of their predecessors, the Timurids, Qara Quyunlu and Aq Quyunlu. Documentary evidence points to the continuity, at many levels, of the Persian bureaucratic tradition under a succession of Mongol and Turkmen rulers. In some instances the vazlr-i kull was hardly less influential than the vizier who was the organ of the central administration. In many cases the provincial vizierate was the stepping-stone to appointment to the central vizierate. Many families had a tradition of public service going back

369



THE SAFAVID ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM
for several generations, but the facility and frequency with which provincial viziers were transferred from one part of the country to another militated against the growth of family dynasties or bureaucratic empires in the provinces. The provincial sadr controlled the religious institution in his province, just as the central sadr was the head of the religious institution overall. He had authority over all members of the religious classes, and was responsible for the administration of the auqaf and the conduct of all transactions connected with them. During Phase One of the development of the Safavid administrative system, the provincial sadr, again like his central counterpart, not infrequently held the military rank of amir. That this was no token appointment is shown by the fact that as late as 955/1548 we have evidence of a provincial sadr being in command of an actual military operation. Such was the predominantly military character of the Safavid administration during this first phase that not only sadrs, but also qadls and other members of the religious classes, took part in military operations, in particular the defence of cities. In such cases, when qadls moved to protect the lives and property of the citizenry, they were fulfilling the traditional role of the Persian 'ulama as organisers of popular action. The lack of any clear boundary, during this first phase, between "political" and "religious", between "civil" and "military", is even more marked at the provincial level than in the central administration. Qadls were frequently appointed to the vizierate and vice versa, and members of the religious classes often encroached on the preserves of temporal officials in regard to financial matters and the conduct of the business of the divan. The remaining principal officers of state had no counterparts at the provincial government level. For instance, the amir al-umard't, or office of the supreme commander of the Qizilbash forces, had no provincial equivalent. The regional commanders of Qizilbash troops were, in the mamalik provinces, the military governors of the provinces concerned. These governors were termed indifferently amir, hakim, and beglerbeg (-/") (more rarely, darugha or ttyiilddr). In times of crisis, however, the governors of the strategically important frontier provinces - in particular Azarbaljan, Shlrvan and Khurasan - were accorded the title of amir al-umara, in recognition of the fact that the military aspect of their office was all-important at such times. From the time of 'Abbas I onwards, an increasing number of mamalik provinces were converted to khassa and brought under the direct



CONCLUSION
administration of the shah. The administration of the khassa provinces was carried on in times of peace by viziers, drawn from the ranks of the ghulams. If military officers were needed in the khassa provinces, they were furnished by one of the ghulam regiments. The number of provincial governors who were drawn from the ranks of the Qizilbash tribes was drastically reduced. As a result, the title of amir al-umara became increasingly uncommon, and in fact is rarely, if ever, used after the death of'Abbas I (1038/1629). We saw previously that during the reign of Shah Tahmasp the qurchi-bashl replaced the amir al-umara as the principal military officer of the central administration. As had formerly been the case with the amir al-umara, the qurchl-bashl did not have an equivalent in the provincial administrations, and for the same reason. When the term qurchi-bashl occurs in connection with provincial government, it denotes the commander of a local detachment of qurchls, or the commander of a small bodyguard of qurchls attached to the person of a royal prince, or has some other special connotation. Finally, the vakll-i nafs-i nafis-i humayun (as he originally was), or the vakil-i saltana or plain vakil (as he later became), naturally had no provincial counterpart. When the term vakil occurs in the sources in relation to provincial government, it is used simply in the sense of "agent", "deputy", "representative". Not infrequently it is used to denote an official who seems to be subordinate to the provincial vizier.
CONCLUSION
The Safavids went down to defeat ultimately because they failed to reconcile the irreconcilable: Turk and Persian; tribal organisation and urbanism; the pastoral-nomadic tradition and the sedentary life of the agriculturalist; revolutionary sufism and dogmatic Shi'ism; theocracy and the complex bureaucracy required by an expanding empire; the "men of the sword" and the "men of the pen"; the claim of the mujtahids to constitute the only legitimate form of government in an Ithna'ashari Shl'I state, and the imperatives of a multi-cultural state. The measure of their success is that they had a greater degree of success in dealing with these problems than had the Saljuqs, the Mongols and the Tiirkmens who had preceded them. The dynasties which followed them - the Afghans, Afshars, Qajars and Pahlavis, all of whom were confronted by at least some of the same problems - were also to

prove less successful in finding solutions to them. The Safavid administrative machine, with its complex system of checks and balances, worked with surprising efficiency, except when there was lack of effective direction from the centre. Life and property were secure; travel was safe; trade and commerce flourished; minorities were tolerated and protected; formidable foreign foes were kept at bay. Alone of all the countries of the Middle East, Iran resisted the most efficient military machine of its time, that of the Ottoman empire. The contrast with the position in the second half of the 18th century and the 19th century, after the breakdown of the Safavid administrative system, is startling: absence of effective central control; total lack of internal security; depopulation of the cities and economic decline; the unrestrained play of centrifugal forces; and the permanent annexation of Iranian territory by enemies in the north-west, north-east and east. In order to make a proper assessment of the merits and defects of the Safavid administrative system, one must take into account the ephemeral nature of the Turkmen dynasties which preceded it, and the chaos which followed its collapse. Despite the internal stresses and external pressures to which the system was subject, it gave Iran two and a quarter centuries of stable and prosperous government.

CHAPTER 7
EUROPEAN CONTACTS WITH PERSIA,
Although historians generally have regarded the Mongol irruption of the 7th/13 th century into Persia and countries further to the west as an unmitigated disaster, this calamity may be taken as a starting point for this chapter because it in fact served one purpose that can be regarded as beneficial. The Mongol armies may have been motivated solely by lust for conquest and destruction, but even out of their evil sprang a positive development when they rent asunder the veil which had for so long shut off Persia and other Islamic countries from the West. For as a result of the Mongol invasions new contacts between the East and the West became established, though at first only slowly and with all the handicaps of much ignorance on both sides. As the pioneers in establishing this contact between East and West, such as William of Rubruck, the Polos, Marino Sanuto and Friar Odoric of Pordenone, all belonged to the period covered by the previous volume of this series, there is no need to say more here than to state that their achievements were of prime importance, since they showed the way for later travellers to follow. The East was no longer a closed book to the West, but as yet comparatively few pages had been turned. It must be borne in mind when studying the development of contact between Persia and the West that the "traffic" was not merely from West to East; there were also travellers in the opposite direction. On the whole, a good deal less has been heard of these visitors from Persia partly because they were fewer in number, and partly because their accounts did not, in the majority of cases, become widely known, if at all, in Europe. One may begin this survey of contacts between Persia and the West by examining what were, on both sides, the main incentives for establishing and maintaining relations. These incentives were of a fourfold nature, but they were not, of course, always operative simultaneously; moreover, they were of varying intensity. In the first category, but only in the West, there was the religious incentive. In consequence of the tolerant religious policy of the Mongol Il-Khans, towards the close of the 1 jth century a number of
373

Dominican and Franciscan friars visited northern Persia and some were allowed to establish themselves in Tabriz. In 1318 Sultaniyya was made a metropolitan see, the first archbishop being Francus of Perugia, a Dominican. Between 1320 and 1329 bishoprics were established at Maragha, Tabriz and Tiflis, all the occupants being likewise Domini
cans.1 In 1350 Nakhchivan was made an episcopal see, and a century later, with the decline of Sultaniyya, became an archbishopric; it was destined to outlast all the other sees, surviving until 1745. A notable increase in the number of European missionaries occurred during the reign of Shah 'Abbas I, when his tolerant religious policy made possible the establishment in Persia of the Augustinians, Carmelites and other orders. Like the Dominicans, these missionaries had to learn Persian, Turkish and Armenian in order to be able to preach in those languages. Although the proselytising efforts of these missions among Muslims had meagre results, their members made important contacts, and many of their letters to Europe, particularly of the Carmelites and Jesuits, are most valuable sources of information. Secondly, there was the desire for concerted military action by both East and West against the Ottoman Turks, whose growing power and aggressive nature constituted a serious threat not only to Persia but also to the Byzantine empire and other countries in the West. This desire led to the despatch of a number of diplomatic missions from various Western nations to Persia and also from the latter to the West. Though these attempted diplomatic exchanges were continued by both sides over a long period, they all failed. The reason for this failure was not lack of good will; it was the extreme difficulty of making and retaining close contact between East and West with a hostile Turkey in between. The consequence was that properly concerted and synchronised operations against the common foe proved to be impossible. In the third place there was the commercial incentive. It was as advantageous to the Western nations as to the Persians to establish trade relations. The desire to forge commercial links resulted in the sending of a number of commercial missions by both Persia and the nations of the West. In the fourth category of incentives to increased contact between Persia and the West were those travellers who passed through that country on their way to or from India or beyond. There were also
1 Gams, pp. 4J4-;.

some persons who visited the country merely out of curiosity, as Persia was still a relatively unknown land. Some of the earliest contacts between Persia and the West in the period covered by this chapter were made by the Dominicans and Franciscans, particularly the former. In March 1377 a Dominican named Johannes de Galonifontibus was appointed bishop of Nakhchivan. In
August 1398 Pope Boniface IX made him archbishop of Sultaniyya.1 Tlmur, after his great victory over the Ottoman Turks near Ankara in July 1402, sent Archbishop Johannes on a mission to Venice, Genoa,
London and Paris with tidings of his triumph.2 To Henry IV of England and Charles VI of France Timur sent letters in which he proposed to conclude treaties for the granting of reciprocal privileges for the merchants of his realm and for those of England and France. Both Henry IV and Charles VI replied in suitable terms and congratulated Timur on his
brilliant victory.3 On his return to Persia, Johannes de Galonifontibus remained at Sultaniyya until his transfer to the Crimea about the year
1423.4
Tlmur's victory over Bayezld transformed for a time the whole situation in the east and gave the already moribund Byzantine empire another half century of existence. In order to obtain up to date information on the results of this victory, Henry III of Castile and Leon decided to send a mission to Timur under Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo, Gomez de Salazar and Fr Alonso Paez de Santa Maria. He had already been in touch with Timur, as two of his envoys, Pelayo de Sotomayor and Fernando de Palazuelos, were present at the battle of Ankara; moreover, when they returned to Spain Timur sent with them an envoy of his own named Hajjl Muhammad al-QazI. The Clavijo mission left Spain in 1403. Not being able to reach Timur while he was on his way back to Samarqand, Clavijo and his companions had to traverse the whole of northern Persia from west to east on the outward journey and in the reverse direction on the way back, the two routes differing slightly at certain points. Consequently, they were able to visit a number of important towns in northern Persia

and to meet many persons of note. Clavijo has given us a valuable account of these journeyings. Entering Persia on 1 June 1404, the mission travelled via Khuy to Tabriz, a city which much impressed Clavijo. He described it as large and well laid out, with fine roadways and many great buildings. From Tabriz the mission journeyed on to Sultaniyya, which was still enjoying its brief spell of importance. Clavijo noticed there the great concourse of merchants and traders who were attending the annual fair, held at Sultaniyya every summer
and patronised by a number of Genoese and Venetians.1 While at Sultaniyya, Clavijo and his colleagues were received by Mlran Shah, who, despite his mental instability, behaved very graciously on this occasion. From Sultaniyya the mission travelled via Tehran, Flruzkuh, Damghan and Nlshapur to Mashhad. In that town they were allowed to enter the tomb-chamber of the Imam 'All al-Rida, "whereby when travelling later through other parts of Persia it came to be noised abroad that we had been at Meshed and visited this holy place the people would come and kiss the hem of our robes, deeming that we were of those who had acquired merit for having made the pilgrimage
to the shrine of the great Saint of Khurasan".2 Of the remainder of the journey to Samarqand and of Tlmur's reception of the mission in his capital no mention need be made because they are beyond the scope of this chapter. Nor does the return route, following the same itinerary as the outward one, except for digressions to Simnan and Qazvln, need further comment. What is relevant is that when in March 1406 Clavijo and his companions reached Spain, they had done much to extend and strengthen European contacts with Persia. Little can be said respecting the next contact between Persia and the West, for Nicolo de' Conti, the Venetian who made it, has left no records of much interest or value. Between 1420 and 1425 he sailed from Basra to Hurmuz, of which he gave some description. From Hurmuz he went along the Persian coast to a large town which he called Calabatia, where he claimed to have learned Persian; this place, like a number of others which he mentioned, cannot now be identified. The Ottoman Turks, though so heavily defeated by Timur in 1402, showed such powers of resilience that only twenty years later they were once again hammering at the gates of Constantinople. Although this

attack was beaten off, others followed, and in 1453,to t n e horror of the Christian world, the city fell and the Byzantine empire came to an end. Venice, with her far-flung commercial interests in the east, was gravely threatened by the ever-growing Turkish menace. For some time she and the other European powers which were exposed to this danger sought anxiously for some eastern ruler who, as Tlmur had done, might attack the Turks from the rear, if possible in conjunction with a simultaneous onslaught from the west. At last it seemed that Uzun Hasan, the Aq Quyiinlu ruler of Persia, might be this ally. In 1458 Uzun Hasan made an alliance with the emperor David of Trebizond, whose niece Kyra Katerina, daughter of the penultimate emperor Kalo Johannes, he married. Though the Turks extinguished the empire of Trebizond in 1461, they were unable to overthrow Uzun Hasan. In 1463 the Venetian Signoria sent L. Quirini to Tabriz to induce Uzun Hasan to join Venice in an attack on the Turks, but he failed to do so. Eight years later the Signoria despatched to Persia, with the same object, Caterino Zeno, a more suitable envoy than Quirini, as he was a nephew of Kyra Katerina (or Despina Khatun, as she was pleonastically called after her marriage). In consequence, he was able to persuade Uzun Hasan to make war on the Turks. Although he was successful at first, the Turkmen ruler later met with a serious reverse. Unfortunately, no simultaneous attack was made from the west by the Venetians or other Western powers. In 1473 the Signoria sent Giosafat Barbaro to Tabriz to urge Uzun Hasan to renew his attack on the Turks, but he found the Turkmen ruler still smarting from his defeat and disinclined to cooperate. In other respects, however, Barbaro made an excellent contact with Uzun Hasan. He was able to visit many parts of Persia, of which he afterwards gave a valuable account. He was at Hurmuz not long after the visit of the horse-dealer Afanasil Nikitin, the first Russian of whom we
have any record in that part of the country.1 Barbaro's efforts to make Uzun Hasan take up his sword again were soon reinforced by another Venetian envoy, Ambrogio Contarini, who brought with him an ambitious plan for a simultaneous attack on the Turks from both east and west. By this time, however, Uzun Hasan was in failing health and was preoccupied, moreover, with a revolt by one of his sons. In 1478 he

died. Though Barbaro and Contarini failed in their main object, they brought back with them much information respecting Persia and its resources. Barbaro's account is the more valuable of the two, since he was very observant and had the advantage of knowing Turkish and also some Persian. On the other hand, Contarini's description of Uzun
Hasan's appearance and character is more vivid than Barbaro's.1 Less than a decade after the failure of these Venetian efforts to combine with Persia against trie Ottoman Turks, Bartholomeu Diaz rounded the Cape of Good Hope, but a threatened mutiny of his men prevented him from proceeding further. While Diaz was on his famous voyage, a Portuguese named Pero da Covilha travelled across Egypt, sailed down the Red Sea and crossed the Indian Ocean. He was the first Portuguese to set foot on Indian soil. On leaving India, he landed on the island of Hurmuz, which he was likewise the first of his nation to visit. From Hurmuz da Covilha returned to Egypt, where he wrote in great detail the report of his travels east of Suez. This report proved to be of great value to those responsible for planning Vasco da Gama's truly epoch-making voyage round the Cape of Good Hope to India. This was an achievement of capital importance: the Portuguese sea captains, trained in the tradition of Prince Henry the Navigator, had succeeded in outflanking Islam by sea. Moreover, as was apparent soon afterwards, they had also, commercially speaking, outflanked the Venetians and Genoese. Though it may be doubted whether Henry the Navigator had ever thought of Persia when he was formulating at Sagres his plans for ocean travel and discovery, it was undoubtedly his inspiration which led ultimately to the rounding of Africa and the inauguration of the long sea route from Europe to the Persian Gulf, India and beyond. This wonderful achievement had great effects on the relations between Persia and the West. Portugal, as the pioneer, was naturally the first to benefit and then make the contact permanent. With the additional route to Persia now open, there was soon to be a great increase in the number of travellers from the West to that country. Shortly before the close of the century, a Genoese named Hieronimo di Santo Stefano, after a very hazardous journey to India and Ceylon, returned to Europe via Hurmuz, Shlraz, Isfahan, Tabriz, Aleppo and Tripoli. His account of Persia does not, however, add appreciatively to our knowledge of the country at that juncture.

Although there had been, as has been seen, quite a considerable interchange of travellers between Persia and the West in the course of the 15 th century, it is improbable that more than a limited number of people in Europe had any precise knowledge of the country by its close. It must be borne in mind that the reading public of those days was small and that it was only in the latter part of the century that printed material became available. People were then on the whole more drawn to fabulous tales than to factual narrations. They liked to read of terrible monsters, of dog-headed men and of men with no heads at all. They were regaled with much material of this kind in the Travels of Sir John Mandeville, written about 1356, the real author of which was either Jean de Bourgogne or, less probably, Jean d'Outremeuse, both
of them natives of Liege.1 In the Mirrour of the World, which Caxton translated from Coussouin's Image du Monde and printed in 1480 or the following year, there occurs this passage:
Emonge alle other ther is a contree named Perse, and conteyneth xxxiii
regyons: of which the first is the Royame of Perse, where is a science called
Nygromancie was first founden, which science constrayneth the enemye, the
fende, to be taken and holde prisonner. In this contree groweth a pese whiche
is so hoot that it skaldeth the handes of them that holde it, and it groweth with
encresynge of the mone, and with wayning it discreceth at eche tyme of his
cours. It helpeth wel to them that ben nygromanciers.2
In the early years of the 16th century Ludovico di Varthema of Bologna, whose chief claim to fame is that he performed the pilgrimage to Mecca, landed at Hurmuz, which he described as a noble and extremely beautiful city. He went to Shlraz, where he met a Persian merchant whom he had known at Mecca. This merchant took Varthema to his home at "Eri" (Herat), which he maintained was in "Corazani" (Khurasan), but which was probably the village of Harat-i
Khurra, near Nairlz, in Fars.3 He and his merchant friend wished to go on to "Sambragante" (Samarqand), but could not do so because the
"Soffi"4 (Shah Isma'Il) was ravaging the country and slaughtering the

Sunnls. After spending some months at "Eri", Varthema returned to Hurmuz, whence he sailed to India. Of far more importance than Varthema's visit to Persia was the arrival off Hurmuz in 15 07 of a Portuguese fleet under the command of Affonso d'Albuquerque, who had come via the Cape of Good Hope. The twelve-year-old king of Hurmuz, Saif al-Dln, was under the tutelage of his vizier, the audacious and cunning Khwaja 'Attar, who had received ample warning of the approach of the Portuguese fleet and had done his utmost to put Hurmuz in a state of defence. When Albuquerque demanded the surrender of the island, his demand was rejected. The Portuguese thereupon launched an attack which succeeded only after some hard fighting. The young king agreed to become a vassal of the king of Portugal and to pay an annual tribute. Soon afterwards an official arrived from Shah Isma'Il to collect the annual tribute due to him. In great perplexity the king and his advisers consulted Albuquerque as to their reply. Albuquerque, by way of answer, gave the official cannon balls, grenades and guns and bade him inform the shah that "this was the sort of money wherewith the King of Portugal had ordered his captains to pay the tribute of that kingdom
that was under his command".1 Albuquerque soon repented of this brusqueness, however, and sent the Persian official some valuable presents; while in 1513, still anxious to establish friendly contact with Shah Isma'Il, he sent to him Miguel Ferreira as his envoy with suitable gifts and a message couched in appropriate terms. The Portuguese fleet remained at Hurmuz until 1508, when some of Albuquerque's captains grew restive at the delay and began to intrigue with Khwaja 'Attar. Faced with open mutiny, Albuquerque was reluctantly compelled to abandon the island. He was so conscious of its great strategic and commercial importance, however, that he determined to recover it as soon as opportunity arose. When he had been able to collect a fresh fleet of sufficient strength in 1515, he again appeared off Hurmuz, seizing the island and this time holding it. Soon afterwards, Miguel Ferreira returned from the Persian court with an envoy from the shah. As Isma'Il was still smarting from his defeat by the Ottoman Turks at Chaldiran in the previous year and as, in any case, he had no navy, he had no choice but to accept the Portuguese occupation of Hurmuz as a. fait accompli. Albuquerque was thus able to
1 Albuquerque I, 145.
380



EUROPEAN CONTACTS, I 3 5 O— I 7 3 6
conclude a treaty with Persia which confirmed that the king of Hurmuz was a vassal of the Portuguese crown. In return, the Portuguese were to help the Persians to recover the Bahrain islands from the Arab dynasty of the Jabrids, to enter into an alliance against the Ottomans and to assist the Persian government to put down a revolt by a
Baluchi tribe in Makran.1 One of the earliest Europeans to furnish particulars of Hurmuz after its seizure was Duarte Barbosa, who was
probably an eye-witness of the event.2 Albuquerque, who had sent back with Shah Isma'H's envoy, following the conclusion of the treaty, his own ambassador Fernao Gomes de Lemos with presents double the value of those he had received from
the shah,3 then set out by sea for India, but died before he could reach Goa. Thenceforward, for over a century, Portugal possessed not only a naval base controlling the approaches to the Persian Gulf but a commercial outpost of the first importance. Some years after their occupation of Hurmuz the Portuguese landed on the Bahrain islands and expelled the Jabrid ruler; though instead of handing them over to Persia in accordance with the 1515 treaty they retained possession of them for eighty years. The fort which they built on the north coast of the main island a few miles to the west of Manama is still to be seen but is now in ruins. In 1522 the Portuguese authorities on Hurmuz took over the customs there, but the conduct of their officials provoked a serious revolt, which spread from Hurmuz to the dependencies on the Arabian coast. They had meanwhile concluded a fresh treaty with the puppet king of Hurmuz which tightened their hold on the island even further. In September 1523 Balthasar Pessoa headed an important Portuguese mission to the Persian court. Antonio Tenreiro, who was a member of this mission and afterwards wrote an account of it, describes Pessoa as "a man of much merit". Tenreiro himself was an acute observer who noted the differences between the Sunnls and the Shi'a and correctly described
the red caps of the Turkmen Qizilbash.4 Shah Isma'Il received the mission very graciously, but died shortly afterwards in May 15 24. During Shah Isma'il's reign endeavours had been made by him on

the one side and by the Emperor Charles V and King Ludwig II of Hungary on the other to conclude an alliance against the Turks. In 1516 Ludwig sent a Maronite friar named Petrus de Monte Libano to the shah with that object. Charles, while still king of Spain (he was not elected Emperor until 1519) also sent an envoy to the shah at this time for the same purpose. Shah Isma'lPs replies to these letters have not been preserved, but in the late summer of 1523 he sent a letter written in Latin to Charles V in which, after expressing astonishment that the Christian powers were fighting among themselves instead of combining to crush the Turks, he urged Charles to mobilise his forces and
attack the common foe.1 This same view was strongly expressed by Paolo Giovo somewhat later, in the second volume of his Historia sui Temporis, published in Paris in 15 60. He maintained that the Christian powers, by their feuds and rivalries, had failed to crush the Turks while it was still in their power to do so, and that the Turks were now so strong that they were likely to conquer the whole world. Isma'H's letter did not reach Charles V until after the shah's death in 15 24. It is noteworthy that the news of Shah Ismail's death and of Shah Tahmasp's accession had not reached the emperor by February 1529, for he then addressed a further letter to Shah Isma'Il. This illustrates the parlous state of communications between Persia and the West at that time, which rendered impossible any concerted planning by the powers concerned. In 1547 Sultan Siileyman the Magnificent took advantage of the revolt of Alqas MIrza, Shah Tahmasp's brother, to invade north-west
Persia and occupy Tabriz.2 As it was then the policy of the French government to be on good terms with Turkey in order to be able to play off the sultan against the emperor, it was arranged for Gabriel de Luetz, Baron et Seigneur d'Aramon et de Vallabregues, the French ambassador to the Porte, to accompany the sultan on this expedition. He was accompanied by two of his secretaries named Jacques Gassut and Jean Chesneau. As the Persians had, when they retreated, adopted a "scorched earth" policy, lack of provisions soon forced the sultan to withdraw his troops. He then laid siege to the citadel of Van, which was held by the Persians. The Turkish artillery bombarded the citadel,

but their fire was ineffectual until, at the suggestion of d'Aramon, they moved one of their batteries to the other side of the fortress; the
Persians were then forced to surrender.1 At the beginning of the second half of the 16th century steps were taken which soon led to the opening up of a trade route between England and Persia through Russia, thus turning the left flank of the Ottoman Turks just as the Portuguese and those who had followed them had outflanked them on the right. In 1553 a ship under the command of Richard Chancellor sailed round the north of Norway into the White Sea. Landing at Archangel, Chancellor travelled south to Moscow, where he was well received by the Grand Duke Ivan the Terrible. This visit laid the foundations for the overland trade with Persia via Russia, for which purpose the Muscovy or Russia Company was formed in 1555. Two years later Anthony Jenkinson and the brothers Richard and Robert Johnson set out from England, crossed Russia to Astrakhan and sailed from there down the Volga and across the Caspian Sea. This was truly a pioneering venture. In Jenkinson's words: "Note that during the time of our Navigation, wee set up the redde crosse of St. George in our flagges, for the honour of the Christians, which I suppose was never seene in the Caspian Sea
before".2 On this occasion, however, these pioneers went not to Persia but to Bukhara, where they spent the winter. They were the first English merchants to set foot in Central Asia. Jenkinson and his companions returned to England by the route that they had followed on the outward journey. Encouraged by this success, Jenkinson and his colleagues in 1561 set out for Persia, the company having in the meantime decided to include that country in its sphere of operations. Jenkinson took with him a letter from Queen Elizabeth to the grand duke and another to "the Great Sophie". On reaching Astrakhan, they sailed southwards and landed on the Persian coast near Shabran, whence they journeyed to Shamakhl, the capital of Shirvan. From Shamakhl they had to travel another twenty miles to the summer camp of 'Abd-AUah Khan (Jenkinson's "Obdolowcan"), the governor-general of the province,

383

who gave them a friendly reception. On 2 October Jenkinson set out via Ardabll for Qazvln, the then capital of Persia, where he was received by Shah Tahmasp. At first all went well, but when the bigoted monarch discovered that Jenkinson was a Christian, he brusquely bade him depart. Nevertheless, the shah later relented, treated Jenkinson well, and gave him a handsome parting present when he left for England. The success achieved on this occasion led to several other expeditions from England to Persia by the Russian route. During this period the Russia Company's traders visited a number of towns in Persia,
penetrating as far south as Kashan.1 However, what with the ravages of plague in Persia, attacks by Tartar pirates on the Volga and a number of other troubles, accompanied by serious loss of life and goods, the undertaking was abandoned in 15 81. On 7 October 15 71 the combined fleets of Spain, Venice and other Christian states gained a great naval victory over the Turks to the west of Lepanto. Pope Pius V thereupon wrote to Shah Tahmasp urging him to attack the Turks and so share the fruits of victory instead of the toils of war. However, it was soon made clear from the account given by Vincentio d'Alessandri, who visited Persia in that year, that little or nothing could be expected of Tahmasp. The shah had, he said, been immured in his palace for eleven years and cared only for women and money; he had no inclination for war; the country was in a bad state,
there was much injustice and the roads were unsafe.2 Eight years later, another Venetian, Gasparo Balbi by name, travelled overland to Basra and sailed thence to Hurmuz. In his narrative Balbi gave rather more detail than was usual regarding his journey down the Persian Gulf, but his distortion of many of the names makes it difficult to identify the majority of them. Balbi's description of Hurmuz is of some value in affording particulars of the weights and measures in use there,
together with other details of economic interest.3 Hard on Balbi's heels came that intrepid Elizabethan, John Newberie. The first Englishman to use the overland route via Aleppo and Baghdad, he reached Basra on 1 May 15 81. Leaving Basra by ship, he arrived at Hurmuz on 22 June, after calling at Bushahr ("Abousher"), Nakhilu ("Necchel") and Kishm. Newberie spent six

weeks in Hurmuz, where he met, among other people, a Venetian named Michiel Stropene, who aroused his suspicions by interrogating
his servant very closely as to his affairs.1 Crossing to the mainland, Newberie travelled by the caravan route via Lar to Shlraz and thence to Isfahan, Kashan, Qum and Tabriz. From Tabriz Newberie returned to England via Turkey. Not content with this journey, he soon set out on another, from which he was destined not to return. In company with Ralph Fitch, John Eldred, William Leeds, William Shales and James Story, he sailed to Tripoli in the Tiger. From Tripoli the party went to Aleppo and thence by the usual route to Baghdad and Basra. Leaving Eldred and Shales behind at Basra, the others sailed to Hurmuz, where they intended to establish trading connections. Shortly after their arrival, the Venetian merchants there, probably at the instigation of Stropene, denounced them to the Portuguese authorities as spies, with the result that they were placed under arrest and sent under guard to Goa for trial. Very fortunately, an English Jesuit named Thomas Stephens was able, with the help of Jan Huyghen van
Linschoten and another Dutchman,2 to procure their release on bail. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to record their further adventures and Newberie's tragic end. It seems that Shakespeare had read Fitch's Journal, published in 1598, for in Act I, scene 3, of Macbeth he made the first witch say, "Her husband's to Aleppo gone, Master o' th' Tiger". Incidentally, it is to be noted that Linschoten was apparently the first Dutchman to visit Persia, but as he confined himself to Hurmuz he saw nothing of the rest of the country. In 1583 a new crisis arose in the relations between Turkey and certain of the Western powers. Pope Gregory XIII endeavoured to revive the crusading spirit in Europe and also the project of an alliance with Persia. In order to obtain up to date information on Persia and her military resources, the Pope sent Giovanni Battista Vecchietti, a native of Cosenza, to make a detailed report. As Vecchietti was an intelligent man and was something of an orientalist, he was well qualified for his task. He reached Persia towards the close of the reign of the weak Shah Muhammad Khudabanda, when that monarch was merely a puppet in the hands of the Turkmen tribal leaders. Vecchietti found that the shah had only limited forces and no artillery whatever. He spent some time

385

travelling around the country in order to acquire a more general knowledge of it. While he was in Persia war broke out between that country and Turkey, resulting in a number of defeats for Persia with loss of territory. Vecchietti returned to Europe in 15 87, the year in which Shah 'Abbas I was raised to the throne at the age of sixteen. It was clear from Vecchietti's reports that Persia was then in no position to give effective military aid to the West; on the other hand, no one could foresee the wonderful transformation in his country's fortunes which Shah 'Abbas was going to effect in the years to come. Pedro Teixeira, a Portuguese of Jewish descent, began his eastern travels in 1586, but did not reach Hurmuz until 1593. He spent several years on the island. He was probably the first European resident in Persia (if we can regard Hurmuz as being at that time part of the country) to study and, what is more, to attempt to write Persian history. He read Mir Khwand's Rau^at al-safd fi slrat al-anbiyd va'l-muluk va'-khulafd. With information taken from this source and from Turan Shah's chronicle of the kings of Hurmuz (a work which is unfortunately no longer extant), he compiled his Relaciones de P. Teixeira del origen, descendencia y succesion de los Reyes de Persia y de Hormu^ y de un viaje hecho par el mismo autor desde la India oriental hasta Italia por tierra, published at Antwerp in 1610. He included in this work an account of his journey from Hurmuz to Mazandaran and back. In spite of his use of Persian sources, his book has little merit as a historical work, while his record of his travels in Persia is distinctly jejune. In November 1598 a mission headed by that adventurous but unscrupulous Englishman, Sir Anthony Sherley, arrived in Persia. This mission had been sent by the earl of Essex in order to endeavour to persuade Shah 'Abbas to unite with the Christian powers against Turkey and also to take steps to improve trade between England and Persia. When Sherley was received by the shah, he was treated with much courtesy. The shah, besides promising to facilitate trade with the West, authorised Sir Anthony to go to Europe on his behalf to endeavour to enlist the support of the Western powers against the Turks. Leaving his younger brother Robert and five other members of his mission as hostages until he returned, Sherley set out for Europe via Russia. He was accompanied by the remainder of his suite and by a Persian named Husain 'All Beg Bayat as joint ambassador, as well as some Persian secretaries and servants; one of the secretaries was the
386



EUROPEAN CONTACTS, 1350—1736
ambassador's nephew 'All Qull Beg, while another was named Uruch1 Beg Bayat. After crossing Russia, the two ambassadors and their suites in October 1600 reached Prague, where the Emperor Rudolf treated them with great consideration. The party arrived at Rome at the beginning of April 1601, but their audience with Pope Clement VIII was delayed because Sherley and. Husain 'AH Beg could not agree as to which of them should have precedence. Eventually, the Pope received Sherley first, but when Husain 'All's turn came, he claimed to be the real envoy and main
tained that Sherley was merely his assistant.2 The sojourn of the mission in Rome was far from being a placid one. The dissensions between the two ambassadors reached such a pitch that Sherley gave up his position as envoy in disgust. Husain 'All Beg, though left as undisputed head of the mission, was greatly upset when several of his suite
(one of them his cook) were converted to Christianity.3 The ambassador, together with those of his suite who remained Muslims, went on to Valladolid, where Philip III received him in audience. The ambassador was deeply chagrined when his nephew 'All Qull Beg and Uruch Beg both became Christians, with the king of Spain and his wife, Queen Margarita, acting as their godparents and giving them the names, respectively, of Felipe and Juan. So strongly were Husain 'All Beg's feelings aroused over this conversion that he attempted to have Don Juan (Uruch Beg) murdered. With the aid of a Spanish licentiate named Alfonso Remon, Don Juan wrote in Spanish his Kelaciones. In this book the account of the mission to Europe is prefaced by a history of the Caliphate, followed by that of Persia. In the last section, the early record of the Safavid dynasty is given in some detail and contains corrections of some errors made by Minadoi in his work referred to below. Don Juan's book was published in Valladolid in 1604. In the following year the unfortunate author, having got accidentally involved in a street brawl in Valladolid, was stabbed to death. Before proceeding further with the record of the contacts between Persia and the West, it will not be out of place briefly to review the progress made during the 16th century. Much had been accomplished, though a vast amount yet remained to be done. So far, the Portuguese were the only people in the West to have direct and continuous contact

with Persia. The English had made their gallant but unsuccessful attempt to establish a trading relationship via Russia and the Caspian Sea. There had also been an interchange of envoys on a number of occasions. A notable feature of the second half of the century was the number of books which were written in Europe on the subject of Persia. There were, for example, the histories of the Turco-Persian wars by such writers as G.T. Minadoi, Historia de/la Gverrafra Tvrchi et Persiani (Rome, 1587), and P. Bizarus, Rerum Persicarum Historia (Antwerp, 1583). These works, though written at second- or thirdhand, nevertheless often contained authentic material. In Italy the indefatigable Venetian Giovanni Battista Ramusio collected much valuable material concerning travel and discovery, which was first published in three volumes in Venice between 1550 and 1563 under the title DeHi Navigation! et Viaggi raccolte da M. Gio. Battista Ramusio. In 1598 Richard Hakluyt, Ramusio's English counterpart, published The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoveries, in which he included material relating to Persia such as Ralph Fitch's record of his journeys. In Elizabethan England there was a widespread idea of Persia as a land of great pomp and luxury. Spenser, in his Faerie Queene (Book I, canto iv, 7), referred to Persia as "the nourse of pompous pride". Furthermore, though there were no more "nygromanciers", fantasy and fable were not yet dead. In the closing years of the 16th century, Fr Jose Teixeira published a book supporting the claims of an impostor named Marco Tullio Catizone to be King Sebastian of Portugal, who, he maintained, had not been killed at the battle of al-Qasr al-Kabir in Morocco in 1578 but had recovered from his wounds. He would not return to Portugal, which had been united to Spain in 15 80, but wandered about the world under the title of the Chevalier de la Croix. Anthony Munday translated this book into English with the title of
The Strangest Adventure that ever happened ... containing a Discourse concerning the successe of the King of Portugall Dom Sebastian, from the Time of his Voyage into Affrique, when he was lost in the Battell against the infidels in the Yeare IJ/S, unto the sixt January, this present 1601. On page 90 of this book Munday added that Sir Anthony Sherley had written from Persia to say that the Chevalier, with other gallant gentlemen, had taken service with the Persians and had fought valiantly against the Turks. There is, of course, not a word of truth in this assertion. Shortly before Sir Anthony Sherley and the other members of his mission reached Rome, a Portuguese priest named Francisco da Costa

had arrived there from India by way of Persia. He gave the Pope a most exaggerated idea of the state of the Christians in Persia, and he went so far as to allege that Shah 'Abbas was willing to undergo instruction in the Christian religion and that he would then, as a Christian, be all the more ready to make common cause with the rulers
of Christendom against the infidel Turks.1 He also said that the shah would welcome the advent of Christian missionaries, which was, however, nearer the truth, as will be seen below. It was unfortunate that Pope Clement VIII decided to send this priest and a layman called Diego de Miranda as ambassadors to Isfahan in response to the Sherley mission. The two envoys quarrelled violently on the journey and continued their bickerings on reaching Persia. Furthermore, they behaved very badly in other respects. Fortunately for the good name of Christians in Persia, a mission consisting of three Portuguese Augustinians arrived in Isfahan in 1602 in order to establish a convent in the city. The missionaries, who had been encouraged to take this step by da Costa's assertions, were Antonio de Gouveia, Jeronimo da Cruz and Cristofero do Spirito Santo. They were all three of a very different type to da Costa and Miranda. Shah 'Abbas received them well and not only gave them leave to set up their convent in Isfahan and to build a church, but also paid for part of the cost of decorating the church. As time went on, the duties of the Augustinians in Isfahan grew more diplomatic than religious. The Prior of the Augustinians was also the representative at first of the king of Spain and, after the separation of Portugal from Spain in 1640, of the Portuguese king. This was the first permanent European diplomatic representation to be established in Persia. In return for the embassy led by Sir Anthony Sherley and Husain 'All Beg Bayat, Rudolf II sent one to Persia under a Transylvanian nobleman named Stefan Kakasch' de Zalonkemeny. Soon after this mission reached Gllan, the unhealthy climate claimed a number of victims, among whom was the ambassador himself. George Tectander von der Jabel, Kakasch's assistant, thereupon took charge. As soon as news of the arrival of the mission on Persian soil reached Shah 'Abbas, he sent Robert Sherley to meet it. When Robert reached the members of the mission, he found that Kakasch was already dead. He thereupon took Tectander and the surviving members of his suite to Tabriz,

389



EUROPEAN CONTACTS, 1 3 5 0 - 1 7 3 6
where the court then was. When the shah received Tectander, he treated him graciously and then examined his letters of credence. While he was so occupied, a Turkish prisoner was brought in, and simultaneously a servant entered and gave two sheathed swords to the shah. Drawing one of these swords, the shah, with one swift stroke, cut off the unfortunate prisoner's head. Poor Tectander was terrified, thinking that his turn would come next. However, his fears were groundless, for the shah then turned to him and treated him kindly, and subsequently Tectander received as a gift the other sword which had been handed to the shah. Shortly afterwards, Tectander and the other members of the
mission returned to Prague.1 Although Robert Sherley had been treated at first more or less as a hostage, he later entered the shah's service as a soldier and military adviser, becoming also, as has been stated, a diplomat. He fought valiantly in several battles against the Turks, and he was certainly of some assistance to the shah over the reorganisation of his army, though Samuel Purchas and some other writers have exaggerated his achievements in this respect. It was fortunate for Robert that he was able to justify himself to this extent, since his position at first was very difficult in view of his elder brother's failure to make good his promises. At the beginning of February 1608 Robert married Teresa, the daughter of a Christian Circassian named Isma'il Khan, who was said to have been a relative of one of the shah's wives. Immediately after his marriage, Robert gave up his military duties for good, and went at the shah's orders as his envoy to Europe in order to endeavour to persuade the Christian rulers to combine against the Turks and also to take steps to improve the silk trade with Europe, in which the shah was personally interested, silk being a royal commodity in Persia. At Prague, Robert and his wife were well received by the emperor, who knighted Robert and made him a count palatine. From Prague he went to Rome, where he was again well received, being made a chamberlain
and a count of the Lateran palace;2 but as at Prague he made no real progress with the objects of his mission. He strongly urged Pope Paul V to do his utmost to induce the Christian powers to forget their rivalries and to join Persia in a league against the Turks. The letter from Shah 'Abbas to the Pope was couched in the same terms, though it contained nothing to support the statement in a Venetian source that

Robert had assured the Pope of Shah 'Abbas's willingness, after the overthrow of the Turks, to abjure Islam and become a Christian. It seems unlikely that Sherley would have made such an assertion, knowing the shah so well. On the other hand, many people had been misled by da Costa's mendacious statements, and in addition the shah's own
behaviour lent some colour to the idea.1 From Rome Robert and his wife travelled to Spain. Although Robert made a better impression there than his brother had done, he failed in the end to achieve any concrete results. His position was rendered difficult when Antonio de Gouveia and Denglz Beg Riimlu arrived from Persia as rival envoys. Robert and his wife therefore went to England after he had received assurances that the fact that he had been in Spain as an envoy would not be detrimental to him. Although King James received him in kindly fashion at Hampton Court, Robert failed to persuade the hard-headed merchants of the Levant and East India Companies of the advantages of trading with Persia via Hurmuz. In consequence, he returned empty-handed to Persia in 1613. Details of his subsequent career will be given later. Despite the fact that Robert Sherley was in Europe on his behalf, Shah 'Abbas in 1609 sent Antonio de Gouveia, and Denglz Beg Rumlu, a Persian, as envoys to Philip III of Spain and Pope Paul V. Iskandar MunshI, in his Tdrtkh-i'dlam-dra-yi 'Abbasi, described Denglz
Beg as "smooth-tongued".2 They took with them a number of gifts for Philip III and the Pope and also fifty loads of silk for sale on the shah's personal behalf. They fared in Spain no better than Robert Sherley had done. While in Europe, Gouveia was made bishop of Cyrene and Apostolic Delegate. On their return to Persia in 1613 the shah had Denglz Beg seized and executed in Gouveia's presence on charges of treasonable and corrupt actions while he was in Europe. Gouveia, fearing for his life, fled to the south. He was detained for a time at Shlraz by Imam Quli Khan, the governor-general of Fars, but
1 He would often discuss religious questions with the Augustinians in Isfahan and also with the Carmelites after their establishment in that city in 1608. When pressed by the friars as to whether he would become a Christian, he would pretend to agree, but when pressed further he would make an evasive reply. In Paris in 1606 an anonymous book entitled Nouvelle Conversion du Roy de Perse avec la Defette de deux Cat Mil Tuns was published, and ten years later, also in Paris, another with the title Histoire veritable de toute qui s'est passe en Perse depuis la conversion du Grand Sophy. Far more surprising, however, was the appearance in Paris in 1614 of an anonymous work supplying details of the conversion of the Ottoman Sultan! 2 Iskandar MunshI, trans. Savory, p. 1074 (mard-i charb-^abdri).

was later allowed to go on to Hurmuz. Imam Qull Khan was very severely rebuked by the shah when he learnt of this action, as Gouveia was alleged to have given the silk to Philip III instead of having it sold for the shah's benefit. The shah therefore wished to recover the value of the silk from Gouveia. On reaching Hurmuz, Gouveia sailed to Basra, went overland to Syria and sailed from there for Portugal. His ship, however, was captured by Algerian corsairs and he himself was imprisoned and held for ransom. Truly, a diplomatic career in those days had its hazards and hardships. As Shah 'Abbas had intimated to Philip III that he was tired of receiving friars as envoys and that he would prefer "some gentleman of note", Philip early in 1614 despatched Don Garcia de Silva y Figueroa as his ambassador to the shah. Philip had been much perturbed previously when the Persians had recovered the Bahrain islands in 1602, and he was now worried by reports which he had received of the worsening situation in the Persian Gulf. Imam Qull Khan had sought to regain the shah's favour by offering to recover from the Portuguese the strip of territory to the north of Hurmuz on which the small port of Gamru was situated, but the shah refused permission. Soon afterwards, however, cruel and tactless action by the Portuguese commandant of Hurmuz led to the shah giving permission to Imam Qull Khan to take this action, with the result that the Persians recovered this territory late in 1614. Don Garcia reached Goa in October 1614, but the Portuguese authorities there, greatly angered at a Spaniard being sent on this mission instead of a Portuguese, detained him on various pretexts for over two years before he could set out for Hurmuz. There also the unfortunate envoy was detained for some time, with the result that he did not reach Isfahan until the summer of 1617. As the shah was at Qazvln, Don Garcia had to travel there to present his credentials. It was not until the summer of 1619 that he could obtain a proper audience with Shah 'Abbas. Don Garcia then brusquely demanded the restitution of Kishm, the Bahrain islands and the territory to the north of Hurmuz. He also demanded the exclusion of the English from the Persian markets. These demands so angered the shah that he broke off all relations with Don Garcia and gave him his conge. Don Garcia thereupon returned to Hurmuz, whence he sailed for Spain; he died, however, on the voyage. Under his supervision, one of Don Garcia's secretaries had compiled an interesting record of his mission.

In the meantime, Richard Steele, a factor of the East India Company, when travelling across Persia on his way to India, was struck with its potential value as an additional market. The company was then having difficulty in disposing of all its stocks of cloth in India. It therefore sent Steele and another factor called Crowther to negotiate with the shah. Shah 'Abbas received them well and gave them afarman (royal rescript) enjoining his subjects to "kindly receive and entertaine the English
Frankes or Nation" who might present themselves.1 In consequence, the company, in December 1616, sent a mission to Persia under Edward Connock, who brought with him a cargo of cloth. Despite an attempt at interception by the Portuguese, Connock landed his cargo safely at Jask, and brought it to Isfahan early in 1617. In that year Connock opened factories at Shlraz and Isfahan. Shah 'Abbas undertook to provide the company with between 1,000 and 3,000 bales of silk a year at a price of between 6s. and 6s. 6d per pound. It was also agreed that the staff of the company in Persia were to be allowed the free exercise of their religion, while the company's Agent or Resident at Isfahan was to be regarded as the ambassador of the king of England. By this time Shah 'Abbas had determined to recover Hurmuz from the Portuguese, but he had no shipping. However, by threatening to withdraw its privileges, he forced the East India Company to make its ships cooperate with the Persian forces in an onslaught on the island. The consequence was that Hurmuz fell to the combined forces in May 1622. The loss of Hurmuz marked the beginning of the decline of Portuguese power in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, this development had favourable results for the East India Company, which could never have competed successfully with the Portuguese had they been able to retain their long-established and highly successful entrepot on the island. Shah 'Abbas made the company free of customs at Hurmuz and also promised that it should receive half the customs dues of the port. When soon afterwards Hurmuz was abandoned in favour of Gamru (which the English called Gombroon and which was soon renamed Bandar 'Abbas), these privileges were, in theory, also to be enjoyed there. In practice, however, the company's share of the customs was almost always in arrears. For nearly a century and a half the East India Company maintained

its trading connection with Persia; during this long period many of its employees served in that country. Some of these men who had served in India had learnt Persian there, as it was the language spoken at the Mughal court. By far the most outstanding scholar in its service in Persia was a Scotsman named George Strachan of the Mearns. He had an extremely good knowledge of Arabic and also knew Persian and Turkish well. Strachan, who may be regarded as ranking with his contemporaries Thomas Bedwell and T. van Erpe (Erpenius), was a keen collector of Arabic, Persian and Turkish manuscripts and books and became a close friend of the Italian traveller Pietro della Valle. The East India Company, however, was not left long undisturbed in Persia. The Dutch, though they had cooperated with the English in fighting the Portuguese in the Persian Gulf, soon ceased to be allies and became rivals. With its greater wealth and its extremely vigorous methods, the Oost-Indische Compagnie soon gained and retained for a long while the ascendancy over its English rival. Like the English company, it established factories in many parts of Persia. While Don Garcia de Silva y Figueroa was still in Persia, a traveller of a very different type arrived there. Pietro della Valle, an Italian of noble family and good education, had set out on his eastern travels in 1614 not for commercial gain or diplomatic duties, but primarily to cure himself of a broken heart. He spent much time in Istanbul learning Turkish, and then went on to the Holy Land, Syria and Mesopotamia. In Baghdad he cured his broken heart by marrying a local Christian lady called Maani Gioerida. With her he went on info Persia towards the close of 1616. Going first to Isfahan, he found that Shah 'Abbas was in Mazandaran, so he journeyed northwards to seek an audience. Given his
knowledge of Turkish, which was the language spoken at the court,1 he had no need of an interpreter when with Shah 'Abbas and his courtiers. He established very friendly relations with the shah, to whom he offered his services. He suggested that Persia might conclude an alliance with the Cossacks, who had for some time been raiding the northern coast of Asia Minor, against the Turks, though he did not explain how effective contact was to be made and maintained. He spent in all seven years in Persia, many parts of which he visited. To his friend Mario Schipano, of Naples, he sent voluminous letters describing his experiences and

doings. These letters, which have been published several times as his Viaggi, on the first occasion in 1650, constitute an invaluable record of Persia, its form of government and general conditions at that time. Gibbon, in his Decline and Fall, praised Pietro for his accurate descrip
tions, but accused him of being intolerably vain and prolix.1 More fortunate, or perhaps more circumspect, than Denglz Beg Rumlu was Hajjl Mahmud Shahsavar, a native of the picturesque village of Nava, which is situated high in the Alburz mountains. On Shah 'Abbas's behalf, Hajjl Shahsavar travelled to Venice in 1613 and again eight years later. He also visited London, where he later became a
permanent resident, dying there in August 1626.2 Muhammad, one of his sons, was with him in London and fell in love with the chambermaid of Lady Cokayne, whose husband Sir William was a high city dignitary (he was Lord Mayor in 1619-20). Muhammad pressed his suit assiduously, offering the girl his whole estate and also promising to become a Christian. It seems that Muhammad's wooing was unsuccess. ful, as there is no mention of him being accompanied by a wife when he left for Persia in the spring of 1627 in the same ship as the then youthful Thomas Herbert. The unfortunate Muhammad never reached his native land, as he contracted "a burning fever" and died at sea. Herbert relates that "the captain of our ship honoured his funeral with the rending clamour of four culverins" as his coffin was committed to
the deep.3 It is now time to return to Robert Sherley and to bring his story to its tragic conclusion. Robert and his wife reached India from England in 1613. From India they travelled overland to Persia via Qandahar. On their way they met that strange and whimsical character Thomas
Coryate,4 the author of the Crudities, who, having traversed Persia, was on his way to India on what was to prove his last journey. Soon after Robert's arrival in Isfahan, Shah 'Abbas sent him to Europe again on another mission. He spent five years in Spain in further futile attempts to obtain agreement over the questions of the alliance against Turkey and the commercial treaty. Despairing of success in Spain, he went early in 1622 to England, where despite the hostility of the East

India and Levant Companies he had a promising audience with James I. Unfortunately, James died soon after, and Robert had to start all over again with Charles I. His position was greatly weakened by the arrival of a Persian named Naqd 'All Beg, who denounced Robert as an impostor and treated him with great rudeness. The English government thereupon decided to send an ambassador of their own to Persia, Sir Dodmore Cotton, who left England for Persia via Surat in March 1627. He was attended by a numerous suite, one of whom was a young man of good family named Thomas Herbert. Robert dnd Teresa Sherley left for Persia in the same convoy, as did Naqd 'All Beg, but he was sent in a separate ship. Before the mission reached Persia, Naqd 'All Beg, fearing condign punishment at the hands of the shah for his behaviour in England, committed suicide by taking an overdose of
opium.1 In due course, after travelling from Bandar 'Abbas via Shiraz and Isfahan, Sir Dodmore, the Sherleys, Thomas Herbert and the other members of the mission were received by Shah 'Abbas at Ashraf, in Mazandaran, in May 1628. The shah was gracious to Sir Dodmore and promised Robert Sherley satisfaction for his treatment by Naqd 'AH Beg. Thereafter, however, his attitude changed, owing, it is believed, to the hostility of Muhammad 'All Beg, the shah's chief minister, who Herbert claims had been bribed to work against the English mission. When the shah left for Qazvln, Sir Dodmore Cotton, his suite and Sherley and his wife accompanied him. On reaching Qazvln, Sir Dodmore could make no progress with his negotiations, while Shah 'Abbas, despite all Robert's faithful services, treated him so harshly that he fell ill and died, apparently of a broken heart. A week later Sir Dodmore followed him to the grave, and the mission had perforce to return to England. Herbert wrote a most readable and entertaining account of the mission, with amusing descriptions of incidents at Shiraz and elsewhere; and a more pedestrian record was compiled by Robert Stodart, another member of the mission. Up to this time France had had but little contact with Persia. Pere Joseph de Paris, the celebrated "Eminence Grise", having taken note of the success achieved by the English and Dutch East India Companies, determined that France must follow their example and have overseas interests as well as being a European power. For this purpose, he argued, Persia must be at least a stepping-stone for further penetra

tion in the east. Pere Joseph and Cardinal Richelieu, who shared his views, being aware that the Augustinians in Persia were exclusively Portuguese, while the Carmelite missions in the country contained a preponderance of Spaniards and Italians, in 1627 sent the Capuchin Pere Pacifique de Provins as ambassador to Shah 'Abbas with a request to be allowed to open Capuchin missions in Isfahan and elsewhere. These missions were to be exclusively French in character. The shah readily agreed, with the result that the Capuchins established a mission at Isfahan and another at Baghdad, which was then in Persian hands. From that time on the Superiors of the Capuchins in Persia were regarded as representing the king of France.
Although Persia, after her wonderful efflorescence under Shah
'Abbas I, began to decline following his death in January 1629,1 there was no appreciable change in her relations with the West. Missionaries of the Augustinians, Carmelites and, soon, the Capuchins continued to come and go, and so did the employees of the English and Dutch East India Companies. Furthermore, in 1636 a diplomatic mission from Duke Friedrich of Holstein arrived in Persia in order to arrange for the supply of raw silk for the industry, which he wished to establish in his newly founded town of Friedrichstadt. When Crusius and Brugman, the two envoys, reached Isfahan, Nicolaas Jacobus Overschie, the Agent of the Dutch East India Company, brusquely informed them that he had orders to do all in his power to frustrate their endeavours. The hostility of the Dutch and the bad behaviour of Brugman combined to make success impossible, and hence the mission returned empty-handed to Holstein in December 1637. Adam Olearius (Oelschlager), the secretary of the mission, subsequently wrote a record of it, which makes interesting reading.
Quite the most remarkable of the Capuchins to go to Persia was Pere Raphael du Mans, who in 1644 travelled from Baghdad to Isfahan in company with Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, the well-known French jeweller and traveller. Being a mathematician, Pere Raphael was warmly welcomed at the Persian court and was greatly esteemed by Shah 'Abbas II and by his successor Shah Sulaiman. Pere Barnabas, a Carmelite, wrote of him that "he is constantly with the greatest persons of
the country".2 Besides conscientiously carrying out his religious

duties, he made a study of the Persian language and also spent much time and trouble in gathering together information respecting the country and its people. He compiled his Estat de la Perse en 1660 for the guidance of Colbert when that able minister was collecting data on Persia prior to the formation of the Compagnie Francaise des Indes in 1664. During the rest of his long life (he remained in Persia until his death in 1696 at the age of 93) he continued to give what assistance he could to France and also to visitors from that country such as Francois Petis de La Croix. Pere Raphael was also very helpful to Chardin, and Tavernier was much indebted to him for data respecting Persia, though this indebtedness was not always acknowledged. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier was born in Paris in 1605. The son of a rich jeweller, he had, like Pietro della Valle, the means to gratify his desire to travel. Between 1636 and 1665 he paid six visits to the east. As already stated, in 1644 he travelled from Baghdad to Isfahan in company with Pere Raphael du Mans. In his book, the first edition of which was published in Paris in 1676, Tavernier had a great deal to say respecting the system of government in Persia, the religion of the people, their manners and customs, much of it provided by Pere Raphael. Tavernier had an agreeable style and had much of interest to relate, but his transcription of oriental personal and place names leaves a great deal to be desired. Voltaire took an unfavourable view of him saying that "il n'apprend guere qu'a connaitre les grandes routes et les diamants". The first Jesuit to visit Persia was Pere Francois Rigordi. He was in Isfahan briefly in February 1646, when on an extensive journey to
various Middle Eastern countries. In 1653 P e r e Rigordi, with another French Jesuit, Pere Chezaud, came to Persia with letters of recommendation from Louis XIV in order to establish Jesuit missions there. Shah 'Abbas II received them well and allowed them to set up establishments in Julfa (Isfahan) and Shiraz. Their advent brought the number of religious orders in Persia up to five, namely the Dominicans, Augustinians, Carmelites, Capuchins and Jesuits. Many of these missionaries were good linguists, as they had to preach in Persian, Turkish and Armenian. Acting, apparently, on a suggestion made in a letter from a Persian
Armenian named Khwaja Petros in 16501 to Queen Henrietta Maria,

Charles II and his advisers, who were then in exile in Holland, sent Henry Ward, Viscount Bellomont, a former Fellow of King's College,
Cambridge,1 and an ardent Royalist, on a mission to Persia and India to raise funds. The intention was that Bellomont should endeavour to obtain from Shah 'Abbas II the sums due to the East India Company as its half share of the Gombroon customs receipts; sums which were, as was usually the case, very much in arrears. As England and Holland were then at war, Bellomont was given letters of introduction to the representatives of the Dutch East India Company in Persia, since he could hardly expect to receive any help from the English company, whose share of the Gombroon customs he was to endeavour to divert to Charles. In 1651 J.-B. Tavernier had written to the East India Company at Surat to warn them that Bellomont was on his way to Persia with this object in view. It is not therefore surprising that when Bellomont arrived he met with strong opposition from the representatives of the company in Persia, spending over a year in Isfahan in fruitless attempts to achieve his ends. As peace had by this time been signed between England and Holland, representatives of the Dutch East India Company were unable to give him active assistance. Finally, Bellomont had to make his peace with the English company by promising not to act against it in any way and was then given a passage in one of its ships to India. From Surat, which he reached in January 1656, he set out, after a brief stay, with his young Venetian companion Nicolo Manucci, for the Mughal court at Delhi, but on 20 June he died suddenly, apparently of heat apoplexy, soon after leaving Agra. Jean de Thevenot, like Pietro della Valle, was a man of independent means, and so was able to travel for the sake of gratifying his curiosity regarding foreign lands. Born in 1633, he travelled first extensively in Europe and later went to the Middle East. After traversing Mesopotamia, he entered Persia in August 1664 and travelled to Isfahan, where he stayed with Pere Raphael du Mans for five months. He had a sound knowledge of Turkish, which stood him in good stead, and also acquired some knowledge of Persian. From Isfahan he went to Bandar 'Abbas, intending to take ship to India. No ship, however, was available, and so he went to Shiraz and thence to Persepolis. There he met Tavernier, Jean Chardin, and Andre Daulier-Deslandes, who had been sent to Persia to gather information for establishing commercial rela

tions between that country and France. With a view to returning to Europe via north-west Persia and Turkey, Thevenot set out for Tabriz, but was seized with a fatal illness at Miyana, where he died on 28 November 1667. As already stated, the Compagnie des Indes Orientales was formed in 1664. The long delay in setting up this company was due to a number of causes, such as the Fronde rebellion and war with Spain. Immediately after the formation of the company, a mission consisting of Dupont, Beber and Mariage, representing it, and Nicolas Claude de Lalain and de la Boullaye le Gouz, who were accredited by Louis XIV to the shah, left France for Isfahan, which they reached in November 1665. Furious quarrels then broke out between the various members of the mission, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that Pere Raphael du Mans was able to patch up their differences sufficiently for them to open their negotiations with the Persian government. Notwithstanding the extremely unfavourable impression which these unseemly quarrels had produced, the shah agreed to grant the company exemption from tolls and customs dues for three years, together with the same trading rights as those which had already been granted to other foreigners. The Compagnie des Indes thereupon opened a factory at Bandar 'Abbas and began to trade with Persia, but neither Louis XIV nor the Compagnie sent any presents to the shah; nor was any attempt made to negotiate for a treaty to confirm its rights. The Compagnie later attempted to make amends by sending one of its senior officials from Surat, but he died on the way, and his place was taken by a young and inexperienced man named de Joncheres. In consequence, the Persian government did not take de Joncheres's attempts to negotiate seriously, a fact of which the English East India Company quickly took advantage. However, with the help of Pere Raphael du Mans and a Frenchman named Louis de PEstoile, whose father had settled in Isfahan, he obtained permission for the Compagnie to trade freely, but without having any exceptional privileges. The Compagnie was, moreover, greatly handicapped by the active opposition of the English and Dutch East India Companies. In 1665 Jean Chardin, a French Huguenot jeweller, first arrived in Persia. Between that time and 1677 he spent ten years in the country, mostly in Isfahan, during which he accumulated a vast amount of information regarding the country, its cities, its peoples and their modes of life. His Voyages is a veritable mine of information regarding

Persia in the latter part of the 17th century. Gibbon described Chardin
as the master "of all our travellers of the last century",1 praise which was fully deserved. Of particular interest is Chardin's account of Isfa
han.2 With his friend Herbert de Jager, of the Oost-Indische Compagnie, he used to wander through the streets and alleys of the city, noting down all that was of interest. De Jager took similar action, although his description of Isfahan cannot now be traced and only his account of
Persepolis is extant.3 So little has Isfahan changed in its essentials that it is still possible to use Chardin's Voyages as a guide to many parts of it. Of de Jager himself a few words must be said. By profession a physician, he had practised medicine in the East Indies and had then been sent by the Oost-Indische Compagnie to Persia. He was a remarkable linguist, being well versed in a number of oriental and other languages. Chardin described him as:

Born in 1653, he was sent by Colbert to study Arabic, Turkish and Persian in the Levant, and also to collect manuscripts in those languages for the Bibliotheque du Roi. He spent two years in Persia, mainly in Isfahan, where Pere Raphael du Mans was of great help to him in his studies, besides nursing him through a serious illness. Under the guidance of the head of the Maulavl dervishes in Isfahan, he made a study of the Masnavi of Jalal al-Dln Ruml. The Abbe Carre, who met Petis in Baghdad in 1674, was greatly struck by his aptitude for oriental languages. Petis returned to France in 1680 and fifteen years later succeeded his father as Professor of Arabic at the College du Roi in Paris. Before his death in 1713, he published translations of, inter alia, Sharaf al-Dln Yazdi's biography of TTmur, entitled the Zafar-nama, and of the Thousand and One Nights, the latter translated from a Turkish text.

In the latter part of the 17th century Sweden entered into diplomatic relations with Persia, her emissary being Ludwich (or Ludvig) Fabritius. He was born in Holland in 1649, but accompanied his step-father Beem to Russia in 1660 or the following year. Ludwich subsequently entered the Russian army and took part in the operations against Stenka (Stepan) Razin, the rebel Cossack leader. He was captured by the Cossacks in the Lower Volga region in 1670, but later escaped to Persia, where he remained antil after the Razin revolt had been quelled. Instead of remaining in Russia after his return, he went to Sweden, where he later became naturalised. In virtue of his knowledge of Russian and Persian, the Swedish government sent him, in 1679, as envoy extraordinary to Russia and Persia. The object of this mission was, presumably, to induce Shah Sulaiman to attack the Turks, who were then threatening not only Poland but also the Swedish
possessions to the south of the Baltic.1 If this surmise is correct, nothing came of the request to make war on the Turks, because Shah Sulaiman was the least martial of monarchs and was, moreover, completely indifferent to affairs of state. Fabritius returned to Sweden in 1682. In the following year Charles XI sent him again as envoy to Persia with the twofold object of inducing the shah to attack the Turks, who were then gravely threatening Vienna, and of concluding a commercial treaty. The secretary of this mission was a young German physician named Engelbert Kaempfer, of whom something more will be said later. Fabritius and his suite reached Isfahan in March 1684, and he was received in audience at the end of the month. Also in Isfahan at this time were an ambassador from Poland named Suski and an envoy from Siam. Fabritius could make no progress in his negotiations with the shah. More often than not, Sulaiman was drunk, and he, like Shah Tahmasp, often shut
himself up in his harem, sometimes for long periods.2 Some while after Fabritius's return to Sweden, he was raised to the nobility, and in 1697 he went once again as ambassador to Persia. He died in Stockholm in 1729, aged eighty.
1 Particulars of the mission and its objects are probably to be found in Johan Kempe, Kongl. Swenska Envoijen Ludwich Fabritii Lefwerne, which is apparently not available, however, outside
Sweden. Some details are given in the Svensk Uppslagsbok (Malmo, 1954)IX. <>6; see-also Konovalov; David Butler, letter from Isfahan, 6 March 1671, in Struys, pp. 340-60.

Kaempfer remained in Persia when Fabritius and his suite returned to Sweden in 1684. At the suggestion of Pere Raphael du Mans, he entered the service of the Dutch Oost-Indische Compagnie as a physician and served for some time in the Persian Gulf area and Bandar 'Abbas, leaving Persia for Japan in 1688. In his book Ameonitatum Exoticarum he gave an account of Shah Sulaiman, followed by a detailed description of the system of government and the duties of the court functionaries. His book was published in his native town of Lemgo in 1712, four years before his death.
Dr John Fryer, an M.A. of Cambridge University and in later life a Fellow of the Royal Society, arrived from India on a visit to Persia in March 1677, remaining in the latter country until the end of November 1678. During his visit he spent some time in Isfahan. Although ignorant of oriental languages, he afterwards wrote a very readable and interesting account of his experiences in the country, garnished with many classical quotations. Fryer gave the following unflattering description of Shah Sulaiman:
Shaw Scholymon, the present Emperor; Who is a Man of a good Presence,
and of no mean Capacity, unless by indulging his Body he thickens his
Understanding as well as he has made his Body Gross; he is Tall and very
Fleshy, so that when he stirs or laughs, all the Muscles of the Scapula, as well
as Ribs, move together. In the beginning of his Reign, like another Nero, he
gave good Specimens of his Inclinations, not unworthy the Heroes that were
his Ancestors; but when he began to hearken to Flatterers, and give himself
over to Idleness, he left off to Govern, and listed himself in the service of
Cruelty, Drunkenness, Gluttony, Lasciviousness, and abominable Extortion,
where he perpetrated things not only uncomely to be seen, but even offensive
to the Ears; wherefore at his libidinous Feasts, to enquire what he transacts, or
how he behaves himself, is fitter for an Aretin than a modest Author.1
Fryer made the following amusing comment on the great heat at Bandar 'Abbas: "... The Sailers had stigmatized this Place for its Excessive
Heat, with this sarcastical Saying, That there was but an Inch-Deal betwixt
Gomberoon and Hell".2
During the last two decades of the 17th century a number of ecclesiastics came to Persia, some of whom were French. Pere Sanson, a French secular priest, reached the country in 1683 and remained until 1692. Soon after his arrival in Persia he accompanied Mgr Frangois Picquet, the bishop of Babylon (Baghdad) and coadjutor-bishop of
1 Fryer m , 51. 2 Ibid. 11, 165.
403

Isfahan, to the court, where he spent some time. After the death of that prelate he was for long engaged in endeavouring to free from sequestration the bishop's effects at Hamadan. He thus had ample opportunity to observe the state of affairs at the court. In his book entitled Voyage ou Relation de FEtat present du Kqyaume de Perse, which was published in Paris in 1695, he described, inter alia, the stranglehold over the conduct of affairs which the court eunuchs had established owing to Shah Sulaiman's lack of interest in such matters. Apart from that, Pere Sanson's book does not furnish anything of interest that is not to be found in Pere Raphael du Mans's more authoritative work. To judge from his book, Pere Sanson's knowledge of the Persian language was not extensive. Abler and better informed than Pere Sanson was another French priest, Pere (later Abbe) Martin Gaudereau, who went to Persia as a missionary some years before the end of the century. In 1698 he was appointed vicar-general to Mgr Pietro Paolo di San Francisco, the archbishop of Ancyra, when the latter reached Persia on his way to India as Apostolic Delegate. In so far as Persia was concerned, the objects of the mission were to obtain the renewal of privileges which had lapsed and to endeavour to win over to Catholicism the Gregorian Armenians of Julfa. The archbishop was successful in the case of these privileges, as Shah Sultan Husain, who had succeeded his father Shah Sulaiman in 1694, was well-disposed towards Christians; he failed, however, in regard to the Armenians. Gaudereau left Persia for India with the archbishop and subsequently went back to France. Some years after his return to France Gaudereau was appointed secretary-general for oriental languages to the King. Besides writing the account of the archbishop's mission in Persia, Gaudereau was responsible for several other books on that country, which will be found in the bibliography at the end of this volume. More will be said of Pere Gaudereau later, in connection with the mission of Muhammad Riza Beg to France in 1714-15. Towards the close of the 17th century the Compagnie Francaise des Indes determined to expand its activities in Persia. In 1698 de Chateauneuf, the French ambassador at Istanbul, sent Jean Bilin de Cansevilles, an intelligent and enterprising merchant of Marseilles, to Isfahan to act ostensibly as secretary to the Capuchin mission there. The real object of this appointment was to enable de Cansevilles to obtain a thorough insight into trading conditions in Persia for the benefit of the
404



EUROPEAN CONTACTS, 1 3 5 0 - 1 7 3 6
Compagnie Francaise des Indes. De Cansevilles remained in Persia until 1705, when he returned to France. In 1707 he was sent to Persia again, this time for a shorter visit. De Cansevilles obtained a great deal of data which he embodied in a series of memoranda, most of which have been preserved at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris, though some of them do not bear his name. In the meantime, the French government had decided to send a mission to Persia in order to conclude a commercial treaty. The envoy selected was Jean-Baptiste Fabre, a native of Marseilles who had spent a good many years in the Levant. He was singularly ill-fitted for the task before him. Moreover, he was so much in need of money for his preparations that he had to borrow what he needed from his mistress Marie Petit. Fabre set out for Persia in March 1705. He was accompanied by his young son Joseph, his nephew Jacques Fabre, a surgeon called Louis Robin, a clock-maker named Jacques (or Jacob) Rousseau (a cousin of Jean-Jacques Rousseau) and a number of other persons; among these last was Marie Petit disguised as a "cavalier". Much difficulty was experienced in crossing Turkey, and it was not till January 1706 that the mission reached Erivan.
Fabre was well received by Muhammad Khan, the governor of Erivan, and so was Marie Petit. Just before the mission was due to leave Erivan for the court, Fabre was taken ill with a violent fever from which he died shortly after. A scene of great confusion ensued. Some wished to make young Joseph the head of the mission, while others wanted to nominate Jacques. Marie Petit solved the problem by proclaiming herself the head, and at the beginning of December she and the youthful Joseph set out for the court via Tabriz, accompanied by a Jesuit named Pere Mosnier. Meanwhile, news of these startling developments had reached the Comte de Ferriol, the French ambassador to the Porte. He immediately sent one of his secretaries named Michel to supplant Marie Petit; so great was his haste that he did not pause to obtain proper credentials for Michel. Travelling post haste, Michel overtook the mission at Nakhchivan. However, while he had no credentials, Marie had been given an escort and provided with letters from the governor of Erivan, and so he was powerless to stop her. By different routes, they went on to Tabriz, where Marie received every attention, but Michel met with a very cool reception and was refused permission to proceed. Marie thereupon went on to the court which was then encamped to the east of Tehran. In virtue of her letters from the governors of Erivan and
405



EUROPEAN CONTACTS, 1 3 5 0 - 1 7 3 6
Tabriz, Marie was well received by the I'timad al-Daula, who conducted
her to the shah's harem, where she received "all possible honours".1 Having achieved her great objective, Marie returned to Tabriz. Meanwhile Michel had at last got leave to proceed to the court, but found that he could do nothing there. On returning to Tabriz, in company with Mgr Pidou de Saint-Olon, the bishop of Babylon, he was arrested and thrown into prison with the bishop. They were, however, soon released and then found Marie in penitent mood. Michel bade her return to France and gave her a small sum in cash and a bond on Aleppo which proved to be worthless. On Marie's arrival in France, she was thrown into prison whence she emerged, years later, broken in health and penniless. Michel's letters of credence having at last arrived, he was able to go again to the court at Isfahan, where, despite strong opposition by the English and Dutch East India Companies, he concluded a treaty on 16 September 1708 which, besides providing certain facilities for trade,
gave protection to the Christian religious orders in Persia.2 This was the first official treaty between France and Persia. In return for Michel's mission, the Persian government decided to send an embassy to France. The envoy chosen was Muhammad Riza Beg, the kaldntar (mayor) of Erivan, who was to prove quite as unsuitable for the task before him as Fabre had been. He left Erivan for France in May 1714. After much difficulty in crossing Turkey, where he was imprisoned for a time, he eventually reached Marseilles in October 1714. For various reasons which are too lengthy to be mentioned
here,3 he did not arrive in Paris until the beginning of February 1715. His astounding whims and unpredictable outbursts of rage proved most trying to the unfortunate French officials, including Gaudereau, who had the misfortune to have to look after him. On 19 February 1715 the aged Louis XIV received Muhammad Riza Beg formally at Versailles. After handing over his letters of credence, the ambassador presented the casket containing the shah's gifts to Louis XIV. These gifts proved to be of poor quality; this fact, together with the strange behaviour of the envoy on a number of occasions, led many persons to believe that Muhammad Riza Beg was merely an impostor. They

included Montesquieu, who very probably derived the idea of writing his Lettres Persanes from this mission (see letter no. 92). Negotiations thereupon ensued for the drafting of a new treaty to replace the one concluded by Michel. This new treaty, which was signed on 13 August 1715, was far more favourable to France than its
predecessor.1 Muhammad Riza Beg was given his final audience on the same day that this treaty was signed; it was the last public function to be attended by Louis XIV. The departure of the ambassador for Persia was not unattended by surprise. As he embarked at Le Havre for Russia, a large case with a number of holes in it, said to contain his devotional books, was placed in his cabin. When the vessel was at sea, this case, on being opened, was found to contain a devotional object of a different kind, in the person of the young Marquise d'Epinay. She had fallen madly in love with Muhammad Riza Beg and had arranged to elope with him in this manner. The journey ended in tragedy, for Muhammad Riza Beg, realising that he had greatly exceeded his powers in signing such a treaty, committed suicide soon after reaching Persia. Madame d'Epinay is said to have embraced Islam and to have subsequently married Muhammad Riza Beg's brother. One of the consequences of the conclusion of this treaty was the despatch of the Chevalier Ange de Gardane, the Seigneur de SainteCroix, to Persia to be French consul at Isfahan, accompanied by his
younger brother Francois.2 The Gardane brothers were destined to remain in Persia for sixteen years, during which they had to endure the privations and anxieties of the Afghans' siege of Isfahan in 1722 and the troubled years that ensued under the usurpers Mahmud and Ashraf. They were not able to return to France until after Nadr Qull Beg, the future Nadir Shah, had expelled the Afghans from Persia and restored the Safavid dynasty. A number of other Europeans were in Persia during the Afghan period (1722—9). The one who has given the best and most detailed account of this troubled era was the Polish Jesuit Tadeusz Krusinski, who went to Persia in 1707. A man of energy and ability who became

2 It is noteworthy that two other members of the Gardane family, likewise brothers, went, on a mission to Persia just under a century later: Claude-Mathieu de Gardane, a distinguished general in Napoleon's service, and Ange-Paul-Louis, who, as secretary of the mission, wrote an account of it in his journal Sun Voyage dans la Turquie et la Perse, 1S07—8 (Paris, 1809).
407

procurator-general of the Jesuit missions in that country in 1720, he had considerable linguistic gifts and often had to act as interpreter for the Persian court, thus playing a role like that of Pere Raphael du Mans in the previous century. After the siege of Isfahan, he was able to resume his activities at the court throughout the brief and terrible reign of Mahmud. He left Persia for Europe soon after the accession of Mahmud's cousin, Ashraf. A valuable and so far unpublished record of the siege of Isfahan in 1722 is the Dagregister kept by Nicolaus Schorer, the Chief Merchant of the Oost-Indische Compagnie at Isfahan, and some of his assistants. It covers the period from the beginning of March up to the end of August 1722 and is by far the most detailed account of the siege that we possess. Owen Phillips and his Council of the English East India Company at Isfahan also contributed some valuable data regarding the siege and the succeeding period. Mention must also be made of William Cockell, who succeeded Owen Phillips as Resident of the East India Company at Isfahan. He was in Persia until February 1737, and was thus there throughout the brief reigns of Tahmasp II and the infant 'Abbas III, as well as the beginning of Nadir's de jure reign as shah. Although not mentioned by James Fraser by name in his biography of Nadir Shah, Cockell provided him with much of the material
for the earlier part of that book.1 As the Safavid period came to an end with Nadir's usurpation of the throne in 1736, we may regard Cockell as the last of the contacts between the West and Persia during the period covered by this chapter. In looking back over the four centuries we have examined, we see that while progress in establishing contact between Persia and the West was slow at first, a great advance was made in the 16th century. Nevertheless, the progress then made pales into insignificance when compared with what was accomplished in the succeeding hundred years. Moreover, the contacts made in the 17th century with the establish
1 O n p . iv of The History of Nadir Shah formerly called Thamas Kuli Khan the present Emperor of Persia (London, 1742), Fraser stated: "The Account of Nadir Shah's first Exploits I have been favoured with from a Gentleman now in England, who resided several years in Persia, speaks that Language, and has been frequently in Company with that Conqueror". After quoting Cockell's "Account" on pp.71—128, Fraser stated that Cockell (whom he referred to as "the Gentleman who favoured me with the above Memoirs") left Persia for India in February 1737. We learn from the Gombroon Diary (Vol. iv of The Persia and Persian GulfKecords of the East India Company of 9/20 February 1737) that Cockell was the only employee of the company to leave Persia for India in that month.

ment of the various religious orders and of the English, Dutch and French East India Companies were to prove of a more continuous and lasting nature. Furthermore, we have the narratives of a great number of travellers to, and residents in, Persia. Of these the most important were unquestionably Chardin and Pietro della Valle. For the first thirty-six years of the 18th century we have likewise a mass of material from a number of sources, such as Krusinski's works, which can be regarded as very reliable. To sum up, it may be said that by the end of the Safavid period in 1736, Persia had most certainly ceased to be a terra incognita in the West.

CHAPTER 8
TRADE FROM THE MID-14TH CENTURY
TO THE END OF THE SAFAVID PERIOD
I . GENERAL INTRODUCTION
Persia, wrote Thevenot, the French traveller in the 17th century, was like a caravansarai: merchants travelled in from many directions. This was particularly true of the period from the Timurids to the end of the Safavids. Routes criss-crossed the Iranian plateau linking east and west, the steppes of Central Asia and the plains of India with the ports of the Mediterranean and north and south, down the rivers of Russia to the shores of the Persian Gulf carrying trade from the East Indies, India and China to Europe. Along the roads were strung the main towns, their sites determined as much by geographical and economic factors as political. It is notable that the major trading routes, whilst fluctuating in importance, remained almost constantly in use throughout this period, though from the Mongol ascendancy to the collapse of the Safavids the state of Persia and those of its neighbours in Asia were remarkably transformed. After the disintegration of Mongol rule, Tlmur aspired to similar far-reaching power but after a period of violent success his empire split. By the mid-ioth/i6th century three states had arisen which divided the control of much of the present geographical areas of North Africa, the Middle East, Asia Minor, Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan and India between them for nearly three centuries. These were Ottoman Turkey, Safavid Persia and Mughal India. Across the sea first the Portuguese and then the English and Dutch companies added a new maritime dimension to the ancient trading patterns. There are three main divisions into which the general period from Tlmur to Nadir Shah can be subdivided. They are, in the context of this economic survey, firstly, the ages of the Timurids and their Turkmen successors, secondly, the first century of the Safavid dynasty from Shah Isma'il up to the accession of Shah 'Abbas and, thirdly, the second century of the Safavids till their ultimate eclipse.
412



THE TIMURIDS AND TURKMENS
2. THE TIMURIDS AND TURKMENS
(a) The northern area
The cruelty and destruction of Timur's ruthless military campaigns are well known but amid the political confusion of much Persian history there is an astonishing recuperative capacity and fortitude in the midst of adversity. The reputed defiant encounter of Hafiz with Timur is an eloquent poetic expression of this spirit. In economic terms a recovery took place after the devastating effects of the post-Il-Khanid disorders and Timur's relentless three decades of warfare in the last half of the 8th/14th century. At the beginning of the 9th/15 th century Clavijo reported on the comparative prosperity of many parts through which he travelled on his embassy to Timur. In Arzinjan he noticed "many opulent merchants" and "many caravans carrying much merchandise journey on their way, coming hither from Syria and bound for
Turkey."1 Tabriz he thought "a very mighty city rich in goods and abounding in wealth, for commerce daily flourishes here." It was a wonderful sight, for "throughout the city there are fine roadways with open spaces well laid out: and round these are seen many great buildings and houses, each with its main doorway facing the square. Such are the caravanserais: and within are constructed separate apartments and shops with offices that are planned for various uses. Leaving these caravanserais you pass into the market streets where goods of all kinds are sold: such as silk stuffs and cotton clothes, crapes, taffetas, raw silk and jewelry: for in these shops wares of every kind may be found. There is indeed an immense concourse of merchants and merchandise here." He particularly remarked that "in certain of the caravanserais those who sell cosmetics and perfumes for women are established" and that it was the women who bought them, being "wont to use many
perfumes and unguents."2
Clavijo was also impressed by Sultaniyya,3 "a very populous city, but not so great as Tabriz: though it is a more important centre of exchange for merchants and their goods". In June, July and August of each year the city "is in a state of great commotion, and immense are the customs dues that accrue to the Treasury. Thus every year Sultaniyah is visited
1 Clavijo, trans. Le Strange, pp. 129, 151. 2 Ibid., pp. 152-3. 3 Ibid., pp. ij8ff.
413



TRADE
by numerous merchants from Lesser India who bring with them all kinds of spiceries. Hither too are imported the best sorts of the lesser spices that are not to be found on sale in the Syrian markets, such namely as cloves, nutmegs, cinnamon, manna, mace and the rest. These are prime spiceries that never reach the markets of Alexandretta and hence are not to be procured in the warehouses there." Apart from spices, silk was a commodity in great demand at Sultaniyya, whither was "imported all the silk that is produced in Gilan... where much of that commodity is produced and manufactured. This Gilan silk is exported from Sultaniyah to Damascus and other parts of Syria, also to Turkey and to Kaffa [in the Crimea] with the neighbouring lands. Further to Sultaniyah is brought all the silk made at Shamakhi [in Shirvan] which is a place where much of this article is woven, and Persian merchants travel thither to buy it, also Genoese and Venetians." The importance of silk to the Persian economy was clear at that time. It was not alone spices and silk that were marketed in Sultaniyya but "many kinds of cloth woven of silk or cotton and taffetas with crapestuffs of various kinds" which "came from the country round and about Shiraz which lies towards the border of Lesser India." These textiles were joined by those from Yazd and the province of Khurasan. From the port of Hurmuz came "a great quantity of pearls also many precious stones", in caravans which took sixty days to complete the journey. To Sultaniyya came "merchants from Christian lands, namely from KafFa and Trebizond, with Moslem merchants from Turkey, Syria and Baghdad" meeting in the hostels which "were conveniently disposed for the accommodation of merchants who come to the city". Samarqand, "rather larger than Seville", was another great city which Clavijo visited. Tlmur had spared no effort to beautify and enrich it. It was a large emporium for produce and manufactured goods, for Tlmur obliged artisans of all trades to settle in his capital. Many merchants, "Turks, Arabs and Moors of diverse sects, with Christians who were Greeks and Armenians, Catholics, Jacobites and Nestorians", besides Indians, traded there, for "the markets of Samarqand are amply stored with merchandise imported from distant and foreign countries", such as Russia, Tartary, China and India. The goods included leathers, linens, silk-stuffs, precious stones, unguents, herbs, spices, preserves with special emphasis on Chinese products which were regarded as the "richest and most precious of all those brought thither from foreign parts, for the craftsmen of Cathay are

THE TIMURIDS AND TURKMENS
reputed to be the most skilful by far beyond those of any other
nation".1 Clavijo mentions an 8oo-camel caravan bringing merchandise from China which just preceded him to Samarqand. He writes that the journey from Peking took six months. One of the principal reasons for the trading prominence of Sultaniyya and Samarqand was their significance as the principal residences and military camps of the ruler of Western Persia, prince Mlran Shah, and Timur himself. At a time when the administration and high command accompanied the ruler, such a base provided the central place of government and hence the focal point of buying and selling. This kind of organisational centre which existed in the Mongol, Timurid and Turkmen periods remained important too in Safavid times, when the purchasing power of the
royal court and camp was a powerful economic factor.2 In Persia, where long distances had to be covered by caravans in a variety of exacting climatic and topographical conditions, the security and safety of the routes were vital. In periods of strong central authority there was a satisfactory system of post horses, caravansarais, road guards and market inspectors. It had been so in the heyday of the Achaemenian and Sasanian empires and existed for a time under the Tl-Khans. It was also apparent in the Timurid period, for Clavijo commented on the post houses which had been built "at intervals of a day's journey apart, or sometimes of half a day's journey" with their horses for official use "kept stationed ready for use at post stages" and "cared for by men appointed to see to them". Amongst other places he was complimentary about the caravansarai at Miyana "for the accom
modation of travellers and for merchants on the road".3 He reported that butchers and shoemakers who overcharged in the royal camp were penalised. In general from his descriptions of the main cities and others the picture which emerges is of much commercial and agricultural activity along the route that he travelled. Nlshapur was "very densely populated, and it is a most delightful place to live in"; Tiis, "a most pleasant township, and it has a greater population than any other place that we had come to since leaving Sultaniyah"; Bukhara, where "the merchants here are very rich"; Simnan, "a very populous town";

415



TRADE
Tehran, "a delightful abode being a city furnished with every con
venience".1 Herat, unvisited by Clavijo, played then, and later, an important role in the Timurid trading pattern. "In the 14th Century it became the main centre of the north-east/south-west trade between the Golden Horde, Khwarazm and India and of the west-east trade between the empire of the Il-khans and the western provinces of China. It was soon acknowledged to be the pivot of the commercial and intellectual life of
Central Asia."2 Certainly not all cities were prospering: Erzerum, for example, which previously had been "the richest and greatest city of all those parts" [Anatolia], was not then well populated and similar misfortunes had befallen Qazvln and Zanjan, where "most of the town is now uninhabited, but in former times they said this had been one of the greatest cities in all Persia". It was equally true that not all the roads at all times were safe from banditry and local extortions, as shown by Clavijo's efforts to avoid Qara Yusuf, the Qara Quyunlu chief, who was in revolt against Timur, or his encounter with Cyril Cabasica,
lord of "Zegan".3 Yet generally whatever the political turmoil, trade had reasserted itself in the northern areas, from the Ottoman centre of Bursa to the Chinese capital of Peking through the roads and cities of Persia. Yet later, as a result of the gradual fragmentation of the Timurid legacy, the increasing isolationism of the Chinese behind their Great Wall and the rising power of the Uzbeks, the full flow of trade through northern Persia and Central Asia from east to west began to lessen, though local trade persisted to south-west Asia and with India. Merchants were still passing along the routes from Tana on the sea of Azov to China in the time of Uzun Hasan, for the Venetians commented on Samarqand that it was "a verie great and well enhabited citie well replenished of artificers and merchaunts both". Furthermore, it was heard that "in these parties is verie great trafficque of merchaundize, specially Jewells and clothes, as well of sylke as of other sortes, and
from thense they go into the province of Catay".4 Anthony Jenkinson, the English merchant-traveller, a century later in 1563 came across trade centering on Bukhara. The overland trade with India too was of long standing and increased in importance with the rise of the Mughal empire. Ibn Battuta had mentioned the extensive overland trade in

horses, which were "exported to India (in droves), each one numbering six thousand or more or less. Each trader has one or two hundred
horses or less or more,"1 and they were taken to Sind through Multan, the capital. These were the horses valued for their "strength and length of pace". He noted that "there are manufactured at Naisabur silk fabrics of nakh, kamkha', and other kinds, and these are exported from
it to India".2 They also exported by mounted post fruits from Khurasan to India. Ceramics and textiles were produced in Persia. In the Ottoman empire, Bursa had become a manufacturing city of much wealth and industry, as Clavijo had remarked on leaving Tabriz when he "joined company with a caravan numbering some two hundred sumpter-horses carrying merchandise bound for the country of the Turks, the ultimate destination of the caravan being Brusa". Trade flowed between Persia and Turkey as Persian silk supplied most of the large requirements for the Ottoman looms. European merchandise reached Persia along the routes of Anatolia, the region of the upper Euphrates and by the Black Sea from Trebizond. It is towards the end of the 9th/15 th century, after the Aq Quyunlu under Uzun Hasan had asserted themselves over the Qara Quyunlu, that the complex relationship of mutual animosity and dependence developed between the Persians and Ottomans. Their empires and resources were too extensive for each to dominate the other completely; their economies were complementary. The great Ottoman successes contemporary with the decline of the Timurids affected Venetian trade. The Venetians attempted to counter
this by creating an alliance with Uzun Hasan against the Turks in H72This was no more successful than earlier attempts to enlist the services of Timur against the Turks or, later, the Safavids against the common enemy of Persia and Europe. Venetian emissaries have left interesting descriptions of the state of trade in the late 9th/15 th century. Since Clavijo's time, Sultaniyya had declined in importance, for "it is nowe but evill inhabited" with some 6—7,000 people in it. Tabriz had taken its place as the capital and, according to Contarini, retaining its commercial prominence was a large city though not "very populous". "It abounds in all kinds of provisions but everything is dear. It contains many bazaars. A great quantity of silk passes through in caravans, bound for Aleppo, and there are many light articles of silk from the

manufactures of Jesdi [Yazd] and a great deal of fustians and mer
chandise of almost every kind."1 Yazd and Kashan were recognised as important manufacturing centres by the Venetians. The former produced "clothe of golde, of sylke, and of damaskyne chamlette, lyned with sylke or furred with exceading faire armelynes and sables". It was a town of artificers, "as makers of sylkes, fustians, chamletts, and other like... of V myles in circuite, with very great suburbes, and yet in maner they all arr wevers and makers of divers kindes of sylkes which came from Straua [Astara], from Azzi, and from the parties towardes Zagatai". The articles produced were exported to other parts of Persia, India, China and Turkey and were so highly regarded that "lett him that woll bie good silkes of Soria, faire and well wrought, take of these". Apparently "they saie that towne requireth every daie twoo sompters of sylkes... As for chamletts, fustians, and such other, I saie nothing; for, by the sylke they make, it may easelie be gessed how much more they make of those." Kashan too, well inhabited, was also renowned for its textiles, "wheare for the more parte they make sylkes and fustians in so
greate quantitie that he wolde bestowe xml ducates in a daie may finde enough of that merchaundise to bestowe it on." Isfahan was well provided for the accommodation of merchants, whilst Shlraz "conteigneth innumerable people, and is full of merchaunts.... Hither arr brought many jewelles, sylkes, both great and small, spices, rewbarbe, and semenzina". It was "a very sure dwelling without any disturbance". The Venetians marvelled at the diamonds, rubies and pearls they were shown. They were impressed with the carpets, the "most beautiful carpetts betweene which carpetts and those of Cairo and of Borsa [Bursa] (in my judgement), there is as much difference as betweene the clothes made of Englishe woolles and those of Saint Mathewes", which they saw in Tabriz. The ingenuity of the carpenters
was remarkable in spite of the shortage of suitable timber.2 Especially revealing were the comments on the organisation of the bazaars and the consideration paid to merchants. Writing of Yazd, the Venetian Barbaro wrote, "whan any merchaunt cometh to this towne for wares, he goeth into the Fondaco, rounde about the which arr certein litle shoppes, and in the middest a litle square place, likewise with shoppes, having twoo gates cheyned (bicause horses shulde not

If he lyketh them and the price, he throweth them into the litle shoppe, and so dispacheth them without moore wordes. For he that delivereth the stuff knoweth the owner of the shoppe, and therefore departeth without further question: which markett endureth till noone; and aftre dyner cometh the seller and receaueth his mooney; wheareas, if he fynde none that woll bye at his price one day, that he retorneth an
other day: and so foorthe."1 The caravansarais were locked at night for the protection of the merchandise.
As well as the main east—west route which went through Azarbaljan, followed the foothills of the Alburz mountains and skirted the dangerous deserts of the interior, there was a more northerly route which crossed the Alburz dropping down to the Caspian Sea into the province of Shirvan, Gllan and Mazandaran, part of ancient Hyrcania. Some of the area had belonged to the old kingdom of Armenia, whose political influence had disappeared, but the industry and skill of individual Armenians survived the loss of the state. Armenians were to have a deep influence on the later course of trade in the 16th and, more particularly, the 17th centuries. The result of Timur's campaigns and the resurgence of the Ottomans was to turn the northern provinces into political prizes for which the Persians and Turks contended at the expense of a succession of local rulers. The small pockets of Genoese traders whose principal bases were at Tana and Kaffa in the Crimea became isolated. Timur had ruined the Tartar city of Astrakhan, the first of that name, which was the hub of trade up the Volga or westwards to the Crimea. This ended the Genoese and Venetian trade in the silks and spices there which, in the main, was re-routed through Syria.
This reduced the volume of trade in the former direction but did not stop it. Astrakhan was rebuilt and local trade over the Caspian resumed. The Russian merchant Nikitin, for example, travelled through

TRADE
Astrakhan and over the Caspian with the ambassador of Shirvan to Ivan III, Grand Duke of Russia (1462—1505). Conditions were not easy, for the behaviour of the Tartars was unpredictable and transportation insecure. Contarini wrote that the ships were kept on shore during the winter when they could not be used and were "called fishes, which they are made to resemble in shape, being sharp at the head and stern and wide amidships. They are built of timbers, caulked with rags, and are very dangerous craft. No compass is used, as they keep continually in sight of land. They use oars; although everything is done in a most barbarous manner, they look upon themselves as the only mariners worthy of the name." This Venetian voyaged to Astrakhan from Darband, with "thirty five persons, including the captain and six mariners; there were on board some merchants taking rice, silk and fustians to Citracan [Astrakhan] for the Russian market and some Tartars going to procure furs for sale in Derbent". Grounding on the shallows and shipwreck were not infrequent. It was said that an ambassador and a caravan left Astrakhan every year for Moscow "accompanied by a great many Tartar merchants who... take with them silk manufactured in Gesdi [Yazd] and fustian stuffs to exchange for furs,
saddles, swords, bridles, and other things which they require".1 On the Black Sea, some trade continued at Trebizond but did not represent a significant share of the total volume then entering or leaving Persia. There was, therefore, in the Turkmen period as in that of the Timurids, a thriving textile industry, a considerable export of raw silk to Turkey, and a large import of spices. Whilst trade continued to follow the established pattern east and west across the north, though with diminishing importance as a long distance exchange, it was being augmented in the south by the remarkable rise of Hurmuz. This barren island, virtually devoid of natural resources, resembling a miniature polychromed waste land, became a poetic and real symbol of fabulous wealth. If the world was a ring, it was imagined, then Hurmuz was its jewel.

the hot summer, and along the eastern foothills of the Zagros to the northern junction towns of Azarbaljan with principal spurs running east to west at Lar, Shlraz, Abada, Isfahan, and Sava. From very early times both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf were frequented by traders. Recent discoveries of Achaemenian buildings near Bushira have reinforced the literary evidence of Alexander's admiral, Nearchus, of an early Persian presence in the Gulf. The maritime interest of the Sasanians has been convincingly confirmed by the recent archaeological discoveries at Slraf. The importance of post-Islamic trade up the Persian Gulf is well attested by the Arab geographers and clearly proved by a number of scholars. In the time of the Mamluks, Aden was especially notable for its spice trade and Ibn Battuta commented that "it is the port of the merchants of India, to which come great vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Tanah, Kawlam [Quilon], Qaliqut, Fandaraina, al-Shaliyat, Manjarur [Mangalore], Fakanur [Bacanore], Hinawr [Honavar], Sindabur [Goa], and other places. The merchants of India
live there, and the merchants of Egypt also."1 It retained a commercial importance to the mid 17th century. It was also a port of entry for pilgrims to Mecca. Ibn Battuta visited Hurmuz some thirty years after the city was transferred from its mainland site to the adjacent island of Jarun, shortly after 1300. Then, according to Ibn Battuta, it was "a fine large city, with magnificent bazaars, as it is the port of India and Sind, from which the wares of India are exported to the two 'Iraqs, Fars and
Khurasan".2 Lar too, with its "fine Bazaars" was becoming more important and the pearl fishing off Bahrain was already renowned. Hurmuz retained its preeminent position at the head of the Persian Gulf for three centuries until it was ruined when the Persians took it in 1622 from the Portuguese, who had taken complete control of it under Albuquerque in 1515. Clavijo stressed the importance of Hurmuz in the trade of spices, precious stones and pearls, and stated that only the skilled men of Hurmuz could do the work of boring and stringing the pearls. The great Chinese admiral, Cheng Ho, brought fleets to Hurmuz, as well as Aden, in the early 15 th century. There was no doubt about its wealth, for "foreign ships from every place and foreign merchants travelling by land all come to this country to attend the market and trade". Here were found a wonderful variety of fruits and

foods. The people of Hurmuz were "experts in every kind of art and
craft", and they traded in all kinds of precious stones and textiles.1 Hurmuz was, in fact, the great emporium for the seaborne trade of the east which reached Persia and a vital link in the transhipment of trade between Europe and the Far East. There were a number of ports on which the long distance trade hinged and, as Albuquerque realised, they represented strategic keys for the domination of that trade. Besides Hurmuz, Aden, Goa, Calicut and Malacca were important staging ports, but trade was carried on elsewhere at a number of others along the coasts of India where Persian merchants were to be found. Evidence of this is widespread, notably in the accounts of 'Abd al-Razzaq, the ambassador of Shah Rukh in 845/1441-2, and Afanasil Nikitin, the Russian merchant, a generation later. According to 'Abd al-Razzaq, Hurmuz still continued to attract "the merchants of seven climates". They came from Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, all the provinces of Persia, Turkestan, southern Russia, China, Java, Bengal, Siam, Tenasserim, Socotra, Bljapiir, the Maldives, Malabar, Abyssinia, Zanzibar, Vijayanagar, Gulbarga, Gujarat, Cambay, Arabia, Aden, Jidda and the Yemen, bringing "those rare and precious articles which the sun, the moon and the rains have combined to bring to perfection, and which are capable of being transported by sea". The transactions were carried
out either by money or by exchange.2 There were indications of credit arrangements but it is probable that these were confined to merchants from the same towns as Ibn Battuta implied earlier or through family connections. 'Abd al-Razzaq said of the inhabitants of Hurmuz that they united the nattering character of the Persians with the profound cunning of the Indians. He was impressed with the security and justice of Calicut, to which merchants came from all quarters, and noted that people from Hurmuz resided at Vijayanagar as well as people from Khurasan. Many Persians were employed in the Deccan. Nikitin also noticed this Persian presence, which he exaggerated by asserting that "the rulers and the nobles in the land of India are all Khorassanians". Nikitin remarked on the extensive trade in horses between Persia and India by sea, particularly at the port of Daibul in Sind. He, too, was impressed with Hurmuz, "a vast emporium of all the world; you find there people and goods of every description, and whatever thing is

produced on earth you find it in Hormuz. But the duties are high, one
tenth of everything."1. He thought Chinese goods cheap, especially porcelain. Other travellers such as the Venetian Nicolo de' Conti support the evidence of widespread Persian involvement in the maritime trade with India. Conti refers to his friendship with some Persian merchants about 1440 and to Calicut being "a very noble emporium of the Persians". Just over fifty years later Hieronimo di Santo Stefano, a Genoese, after journeying from Cairo to India, returned home after innumerable adventures through Cambay and Hurmuz, where he was befriended by some Alexandrian and Damascene merchants. These helped him to reach Aleppo by way of Shiraz, Isfahan, Sultaniyya and Tabriz. He refers to Armenian merchants in Hurmuz. Another Venetian mentions that "the merchaunts that travaill either out of India into Persia or out of Persia into India, for the more parte do all arryve
in this ilande".2 All draw attention to the scorching heat and brackish water. It is probable that Persian maritime trade with India in particular and the east in general reached a high level of activity in the last decade of the 15 th century in both variety and volume. The Ottomans had not then won control over Egypt, Turkish—Persian relations were not affecting trade in the south to any great extent, Mughal dominion was not yet felt over India, and the Portuguese had not established themselves or disturbed the pattern of Asian trade. Not for another century and a half, in the time of Shah 'Abbas II, was maritime trade comparable, and then the Persians had to share it not only with Indian merchants, but also with the increasingly powerful Armenian merchant communities who were entrenching themselves in the main trading centres, and with the Dutch and English East India Companies. The Portuguese noticed and admired the well-dressed, good-living inhabitants of Hurmuz, whose trading activities they were to control to their own advantage. Duarte Barbosa described the island in its greatest period at the beginning of the 16th century: "In this city are many merchants of substance, and many very great ships. It has a right good harbour where many sorts of goods are handled which come hither from many lands, and from here they barter them with many parts of India. They bring hither spices of all sorts, and divers kinds, to wit pepper, cloves, ginger, cardamoms, eagle-wood, sandal-wood,

TRADE
brasil-wood, myrobalans, tamarinds, saffron, indigo, wax, iron, sugar, rice (great store) and cocoa-nuts, as well as great abundance of precious stones, porcelain and benzoin, by all of which they gain much money. They have also great plenty of Cambaya, Chaul and Dabul cloths, and from Bengala they bring many synbafos, which are a sort of very thin cotton cloth greatly prized among them and highly valued for turbans and shirts, for which they use them. And from the city of Adem they bring to Ormus abundance of copper, quicksilver, vermillion, rosewater, many brocaded cloths, tafetas and ordinary camlets; also from the lands of the Xeque Ismael come a great quantity of silk, very fine musk and rhubarb of Babilonia. And from Barem and Julfar come seed pearls and large pearls, and from the cities of Arabia a great number of horses come, which they carry hence to India, whither every year they used to take one and at times two thousand horses, and each one of these is worth in India, taking good and bad together, three or four hundred cruzados, more or less according to the demand for them. And in the ships in which these horses are taken they carry also abundance of dates, raisins, salt and sulphur, also coarse seed pearls in
which the Moors of Narsingua take great delight".1 The administration was competent and strict and, in spite of the necessity to import all the provisions of daily life, "all the open places are constantly full of all this food and wood (which also they bring from outside) in great abundance, and everything is sold by weight at fixed rates, with very strict regulations; and any person who gives short weight or departs from the fixed rate and orders given to him, is punished with great severity". The collection of customs was well organised, for "this king keeps his governors and collectors of revenue at those places in Persia and Arabia and the isles which pertain to his seignory". There would appear to have been an adequate supply of money without restrictions on its export and generally constant in its value. It is doubtful if gold was coined there, though it.had a limited circulation, but it is probable that the special silver coinage, Idris, which were like thin beans, were minted there, as Duarte Barbosa says. "All this money", Barbosa affirmed, "silver as well as gold, is in such plenty" that "as many ships as come to the city with goods, after they have sold their goods and bought the horses and sinais which they are to take away with them what balance soever remains over to them"
1 Barbosa i, 93—5.
424



THE TIMURIDS AND TURKMENS
they take in this coin, "as it circulates much in India and has a good value there". This acceptance of the lari facilitated trade. Barbosa specially mentioned connections with Daibul, to which horses were brought from Hurmuz; Goa, where "the harbour was exceeding good, had great trade, and many ships of the Moors, came thither from Mecca, the city of Aden, Ormus, Cambaya and Malabar", where horses were sold and where "the Ormus merchants take hence in their ships cargoes of rice (great store), sugar, iron, pepper, ginger and other
spices of divers kinds, and drugs, which they carry thither".1 Large quantities of rice were also obtained from the west coast of India at Baticala (Bhatkal), as well as sugar, for bartering for horses and pearls, and Bacanore, where it was bartered for copper, coconuts and molasses. Other travellers at the same time corroborate the account of Duarte Barbosa, such as Tome Pires and Ludovico di Varthema. The latter comments on the extent of the trade of Bengal from which "fifty ships are laden every year in the place with cotton and silk stuffs... these same stuffs go through all Turkey, through Syria, through Persia,
through Arabia Felix, through Ethiopia, and through all India".2 Varthema also mentions, as does Tome Pires, Persian merchants at Pegu, a great centre for gumlac. This was probably exported in large olive-coloured jars with dragons and other Chinese motifs in relief and which were thereafter used for carrying holy water from the Ganges to Indian merchants residing in Persia. Tome Pires noted Persians and Armenians at Malacca. An interesting instance of the importance of local brokers in business transactions is described by Varthema as having taken place in Calicut and was probably paralleled elsewhere. Brokers and the money changers (sarrdfs) played extremely important parts in the organisation of trade. There was no doubt at all of the extensive well-organised system of trading which operated along the sea routes. Doubtless greatly facilitated by a common religion and language in many parts among the traders as a result of the spread of Islam in previous centuries, it was nevertheless protected and encouraged by prince and producer for the wealth it brought and the revenues it sustained. The merchants were intrepid, for the voyages were dangerous, uncomfortable and dependent on the monsoons. The ships, apart from the great Chinese junks and the Portuguese galleons, were simple in construction, "the timbers

of which were sewn together with cords and the sails made of rush mats", or cotton. While the art of navigation was well understood, there was not a great deal of order on board ships, and there was the ever-present threat from pirates at sea and brigands on inhospitable coasts, the fear of shipwreck or at best loss of voyage or goods, or starvation in a voyage blown off course. A voyage from Hurmuz to Calicut would last three weeks or more and one from Aden to Calicut would take up to five weeks in normal conditions. In assessing the particular trading role of Hurmuz from the 14th to the 16th centuries in Persian history, it is necessary to bear in mind the composite nature of the trade and the close connections of traders inhabiting the Persian Gulf on both its sides. Duarte Barbosa writes of Hurmuz that "the merchants of this isle and city are Persians and Arabs", and in considerable detail, if not always completely accurately, he enumerates all the places of the Gulf and the coastal districts of Arabia which were to a lesser or greater extent involved with the kingdom of Hurmuz. The trading was cosmopolitan but the kingdom itself was virtually autonomous, also administering part of the Persian mainland. There was no real effort to make it subject to the dynasties that rose and fell in southern Persia, which had neither the means to coerce it nor the power to supplant it whilst they benefited from the trade which was attracted to it. The Safavids sought early to change this state of affairs and make the kingdom of Hurmuz subject to them and sent officials to claim a yearly tribute. The vizier, Khwaja 'Attar, opposed the pretensions of the Safavids as much as the threats of the Portuguese. Shah Isma'Il sent an ambassador to Goa in 1510, before it had been taken by Albuquerque, to solicit assistance from the Goanese ruler in subjecting Hurmuz. Subsequently it was suggested to Albuquerque that the Portuguese and Persians should jointly effect this, but this and other requests were rejected. With the conquest of Hurmuz by Albuquerque in 1515, Persian claims to the island, even to its trading revenues, were unavailing for a century.
(c) Conclusion
There was, therefore, in Timurid and Turkmen times much commercial activity throughout Persia. The merchant had his standing in contemporary society and he had an assured place in the large towns where accommodation was provided and where retailing was carried out in

THE EARLY SAFAVID PERIOD
the bazaars. Manufacturing centres at Yazd, Kashan, Isfahan, Shlraz, Kirman, Tabriz, to mention the major cities, produced a wide variety of textiles, ceramics, leather work and metal work for local consumption and export. The fine arts flourished; the main palace and mosque "so well built that I do not know how to describe it" at Tabriz were regarded by a contemporary Venetian merchant as outstandingly beautiful. The transit trade was extensive from China to the Levant in which Persian merchants were prominent and Hurmuz was the entrepot par excellence. Trade was only very loosely national in character, unlike that of the following centuries.
3. THE EARLY SAFAVID PERIOD
(a) Introduction
The rise to power of the Safavid dynasty in Persia did not generally, in the short term, have a profound effect on the Persian economy. During Shah Isma'Il's early years of achievement, when he held off challenges to his own supremacy from the Turks and Uzbeks, Persia reacted to external events rather than took initiatives. There was, however, no mistaking the militant Shi'ism of Shah Isma'Il, his religious fervour, irrespective of whether the motivation was political or spiritual. In his time he deliberately exploited Iran as the seat of a Shl'I minority sect with all the devotion which such a feeling engenders. This initially may have proved a weakness, for not only did its selfconscious sense of self-righteousness make cooperation with Sunnis difficult, but it led to extravagant claims and aggressive activities. Thus the Portuguese, in return for Persian assistance against the Turks, were requested, amongst other demands, to impose the Shl'I creed in Goa, whilst early efforts to proselytise the Turks of Anatolia provoked wrathful reprisals from the Sultans. As in the previous century sea borne trade with India and beyond was maintained through Hurmuz, though the Persian revenues benefited little. Turkey remained the main market for silk exports, with increasing reliance on Venetians and Armenians as intermediaries. It was on the periphery of Persia that the main events were taking place with such profound political and economic implications. Power was shifting from Central Asia to Anatolia. Many reasons have been advanced for this; many theories formulated. In part it is explained by

TRADE
the spectacular success of the Ottomans themselves. In part it is the triumph of the musket over the bow. In part it is the greater rise of industrial economies with manufacturing skills on a comparatively large scale which were being developed in Europe over peoples mostly exchanging raw materials: the facility of cash payments over bartering arrangements; the skills of navigation and shipbuilding construction over the mule and camel for transportation. Whatever the validity of these and other explanations, there is no doubt of the political and economic changes of the ioth/i6th century. The Turks performed notable feats of administration, commerce and warfare. The Russians from Moscow broke free and stretched out from the Baltic to the Caspian along the Volga and east to Siberia. In Europe the fleets of Portugal, Spain, England and Holland were mastering the seas, adding a new dimension to the politics and trade of the period. The whole Mediterranean world teemed with activity. In Egypt the Mamlfik domination came to an end. The half century from 1510 to 1560 was particularly momentous. Shah 'Abbas and the later Safavids were to derive great advantages from a Persia placed in a decisive position between East and West.
(b) The northern area
As a result of the enmity between the Uzbeks and the Persians-, which continued intermittently throughout the century, and the seizure of Herat by Shah Isma'Il in 1510, which ended the golden age of that noble city, trade from Persia to Central Asia was reduced. Some trade continued to flow through Mashhad and Kabul to Bukhara and Balkh as they remained centres distributing Indian and some European goods throughout Turkestan. In the second half of the century the Russians began actively promoting their trade there after they had defeated the Tartars and taken control of the Volga from Kazan down to the delta including Astrakhan. Anthony Jenkinson, who passed through the land of the Tiirkmens in 1561, reported that in Urgench there was little trade out of Persia, "in most small quantitie not worth the writing", and that in Bukhara, which gave some evidence of its former greatness as a yearly great resort of merchants, they were "so beggerly and poore that there is no hope of any good trade there to be had worthy the following". There was, however, some Persian trade there, for they "doe bring thither Craska [coarse linen] wollen cloth, linnen clothe,
428



THE EARLY SAFAVID PERIOD
divers kindes of wrought pide silkes, Argomacks [Turkmen horses crossed with Arab stock] with such like, and doe carrie from thence redde hides with other Russe wares, and slaves", for which it was the
largest market in Central Asia.1 Besides the Russians, there were some merchants from India, "but golde, silver, precious stones, and spices they bring none". "I enquired", adds Jenkinson interestingly, "and perceuied that all such trade passeth to the Ocean Sea, and the vaines where all such things are gotten, are in the subiection of the Portingals." Jenkinson could not sell his cloth to the Persian merchants "for that they bring thither themselves, and is brought unto them as I have enquired from Aleppo in Syria, and the parts of Turkie". This was confirmed on his return journey, when he was again informed that "the chief trade of Persia is into Syria, and so transported into the Levant seas". The routes were dangerous, thieves abounded, and silver and copper coinage were in short supply and frequently debased. It was Russian interest which was to take in the widespread trade to Central Asia and eventually to culminate in their occupation of the area. On Jenkinson's return from his Central Asian journey he was accompanied by "two ambassadors, the one from the King of Boghar [Bukhara], the other from the King of Balke [Balkh]..." and later "foure more Ambassadors sent from the King of Urgence, and other Soltans, his brethren, unto the Emperor of Russia...". The acquisition of Siberia by Russia in the latter part of the ioth/i6th century was also important in both a political and economic context. The area provided a vast store of furs, particularly sables and foxes, which became an important item of Russian trade to Persia, and some gold and silver. The southern Russian pivotal town for trade east to Central Asia and south to Persia was Astrakhan, 75 miles upstream on the lower Volga from the Caspian Sea. It had been important for centuries and during the 3rd/c)th and 4th/ioth centuries had been a link between the northern Viking communities and the Arab merchants. It acquired more importance in the Mongol period when Ibn Battuta described it as "one of the finest of cities, with great bazars", along with the "fine bazars and harbour" of Azov in the Crimea. As has been noted, in the 9th/15 th century its trade declined, but with the southern and eastward expansion of Russia it gradually increased in importance after its capture in 15 54 and its fortification in the 1580s. It did, how

TRADE
ever, suffer greatly in the anarchical conditions of "the Troubles" over the Russian succession in the early 17th century. Jenkinson on his first voyage described its trade as follows. "The chiefest commodities that the Russes bring thither are redde hides, redde sheepe skinnes, woodden vessels, bridles, and saddles, knives, and other trifles, with corne, bacon and other victualles. The Tartars bring thither divers kindes of wrought silkes; and they that come out of Persia, namely from Shamackie, do bring sowing silke, which is the coursest that they use in Russeland, Crasko, divers kindes of pide silkes for girdles, shirts of male, bowes, swoords, and such like things: and some yeeres corne, and wallnuts." At that time, however, less than a decade after its capture by the Russians, it was not an attractive place. There were "all such things in such small quantitie, the merchantes being so beggerly and poore that bring the same, that it is not worth
the writing."1 The importance of Astrakhan in the third quarter of the 16th century in the context of Persian trade was twofold. Firstly, as a staging point in the route which stretched from the White Sea to the Caspian linking Europe and Asia, it was beyond the interference of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets. From the time of the first English voyage to
Russia in 1553—5 a possible alternative route was available for spices, silkes and dyes, away from Turkish or Venetian control, and a potential market for exports of English cloth, which was then and for many years the staple English export item. As Jenkinson explained to 'Abd-Allah, khan of Shlrvan, "if it would please the sayde Sophie and other princes of that countrey, to suffer our merchaunts to trade into those dominions, and to give us passeport and safe conduct for the same, as the sayde Turke hath graunted to the sayde Venetians, I doubted not but that it should growe to such a trade, to the profite of them, as never before had bene the like, and that they should bee both furnished with our commodities, and also have utterance of theirs,
although there never came Turke into their land...".2 Unfortunately Shah Tahmasp, having just concluded a treaty with Hasan Agha, the Turkish ambassador, in Qazvin in November 1562, was unwilling to listen to Jenkinson's trade proposals at that time, lest he jeopardise his improved relations with the Turks. Laurence Chapman later reported Turkish hostility, their merchants pretending to be friendly "but

secretlie they be our mortall enemies, searching by all meanes to hinder our sales". Arthur Edwards repeated this trade proposition later to Shah Tahmasp when he promised to bring the merchandise as the Venetians did, "abundance of fine karsies, of broad clothes, of all sorts and coulers, as scarlets, violets, and other of the finest cloth of all the world... by the way of Moscovia, with more safetie and in much
shorter time then the Venetians can bring them".1 The shah was then agreeable and authorised the necessary privileges. Secondly, as the most southerly Russian outpost Astrakhan threatened Ottoman interests in the Caucasian area. The six Persian voyages sponsored by the English Russia Company between 15 60 and 15 80 were a premature but interesting attempt to reorientate a portion of Persian trade from its east—west axis to a north—south one. It had attractions for a Persia that wished to be free from Turkish control over its existing major export routes. Shah Tahmasp, in giving the Agent of the Russia Company, Arthur Edwards, the trading privileges and a list of the goods he wanted on 29 June 1566, made it clear that he "desireth to see of all sortes, which will be an occasion that the Venetians and Turkes shall be in lesse estimation than they are, for themselves doe feare and secretly say the same. And truely the Princes subiects intend to enter into trade with us for spices and other commodities that they were woont to sell unto the Venetians and Turkes." Thus at the outset of this trade one of the main objectives was to displace the Levant-routed merchandise, but neither then nor later throughout the rest of the Safavid period was this accomplished either in a northerly or southerly direction. Edwards realised that "to breake the trade betwixt the Venetians and the whole company of the Armenians" was not feasible on the resources he had
available; it never was.2 As will already have been noted, trade to a greater or lesser extent had been carried on between Persia and the trading centres and ports of the Levant for centuries. The rise of the Ottomans, far from reducing its importance, increased it. Thus although the English merchants were in hopes of developing a profitable trade with Persia through Russia, neither the Venetians, the Armenians nor the Turks were disposed to surrender their markets lightly. What was at stake was mentioned by two Russia Company merchants, Thomas Banister and Geoffrey

Ducket, to Sir William Cecil in 1568: "This matter of Percia towchit the Etallians and straungers verye neare, for the Etallians have had the holle trayed of silks and also moche spyces brought by the Venetians, the Flamings; in lyke caise they have the stapill of all Spyces playsid at Andwarpe [Antwerp] by the Portingales, whereof a greate parte is utteride in England, so that if we might bringe the Spyces and
silks this waye, they are all towchid, whiche they are not ignorant of."1 Cloth, silk and spices - these were the main trading counters concerned in this new opening of trade which was definitely acquiring a national character. What, then, did the English merchants discover in the Persia of Shah Tahmasp in their "good hope for a beneffitiall trade of Spices, drugges and silkes out of Persia"? They were informed that "there is more silke brought into some one citie of Persia then is of cloth brought into the
citie of London",2 but, hyperbole aside, silk was the dominant Persian commodity. It was estimated that raw silk cost between 9/- and 10/- a lb., that is 60 shahis, at 6d each, a batman of six and a half lbs. at Qazvln and a mule's lading was 60 batmans. It was thought possible to purchase 60,000—80,000 lbs. yearly at Qa2vln and at Ganja "(if it were not for the Turkes) for a two hundred thousandes pounds [over 400,000 lbs.] besides silke of all colours died in graine", for about 1 is 6d per lb. There was no shortage of silk: "there is in those parts to be had three or foure thousand horses lading, every horse loade being 50 or 60 batmans, beside silke of Groine [Georgia]". The Turks, Venetians and Armenians had the edge over the English merchants not only in the regularity of their supplies, the security of their routes and their superior knowledge of local conditions, but also in their provision of ready money to facilitate sales. The Turks, according to Arthur Edwards, "bring great store of silver to be coyned, to wit, Dollars at ten shaughes the peece. The Hungarie Ducket is at 12 shaughs. And having monie in readiness at the time of the yeere, they buy silke the
better cheap, when the country men bring it first to be sold."3 For this reason it was requested "to send some bulion to be coined here; it will please the prince there, and be profitable to you". The circulation of precious metals had become complex in the ioth/i6th century, and with the introduction of large quantities of silver from South America it was to have increasingly different reper

432



THE EARLY SAFAVID PERIOD
cussions on national economies. In particular the Turkish economy suffered from a bad bout of inflation towards the end of the 16th century, exacerbating its relations with Persia. The movement of precious metals, particularly in the trade between west and east in the nth/17th century, was a subject of acute controversy in the state treasuries. At this time in Persia, according to Vincentio d'Alessandri, "those who introduce silver from Turkey gain twenty per cent., gold fourteen and fifteen per cent., and copper sometimes eighteen and sometimes twenty per cent.; it is true that there are great expenses, as
the exportation of metals is forbidden".1 It was reported by the English merchants that "there is brought into Persia an incredible summe of Dutch dolers, which for the most part are there employed in rawe silke". In exchange for silk or spices English merchants could only provide cloth in quantity, and for this purpose Qazvln, Tabriz, Ardabll and Kashan were the places where resided the chief merchants; Tabriz was "the principall place in this countrey for uttering of cloth or karsies". Kashan was praised for "a towne that consisteth all together of merchandise, and the best trade of all the lande is there, beying greatly frequented by the merchauntes of India. Here our men bought great store of all maner of wrought silkes and some spices, and good store of Turkie stones." To the ordinary people who wore rough cloth, it was hoped to sell kerseys. The wealthier people wore broad cloth. "They talke such of London clothes" or those from Venice and preferred bright colours; "violets in graine and fine reds be most worne". However, though Shah Tahmasp talked of taking 100,000 cloths, this did not materialise, nor was it likely. The shah might exercise a control over trade, especially of silk, but he was not a merchant. It was reported that "the Shaugh neuer tooke cloth unto his treasurie all the dayes of his life, and will not now beginne; his whole trade is in rawe silke, which he selleth alwayes for money to the
Armenians and Turkes, and such other as use to buy it".2 There was thus little chance of bartering cloth for silk directly with the shah. The English merchants were faced with strong competition from the Venetians and Armenians already entrenched in the complementary silk and cloth trade at Aleppo, for "the Armenians yeerely receaue at the Venetians hands kersies in barter for rawe silkes, giving sometimes 60 peeces of kersies for 70 batmans of silke of this countrey, and
1 A Narrative of Italian Travels, pp. 225-6. 2 Jenkinson, Early Voyages 11, 411.
435



TRADE
40 peeces for Grousine [Georgian] silke". It was reported that one Armenian village "yeerely carrieth 400 and 500 Mules lading of silke to Aleppo, and bringeth thence 800 or a thousand Mules laden with kersies and Venice clothes", a mule carrying 60 batmans of silk or 18
kersies.1 The same problem applied to spices, which were, however, in this period in short supply from Hurmuz owing to Portuguese-Indian hostilities, and the English merchants were advised to pay for them "one third part money, the rest, cloth and kersies fitted in coulers meet for this countrey". Commodities thought exportable out of Persia for England through Russia included raw silk, pepper, ginger, nutmegs, mace, cinnamon, brimstone, alum, rice, galls, cloves and bow staves. Much good cotton was produced, some of which was exported to Aleppo. Manufacturing was carried on, and Khurasan was mentioned by Alessandri where "they worked cloths of silk and especially velvets, which are equal in excellence to the Genoese; in other parts they work on smooth stuffs and damask, but not with the finish they have in Italy". Trade, however, by and large was not flourishing. There are frequent references to the interruption caused by the dearth of commerce at Hurmuz, or the effects of warfare around Aleppo, or the difficulties caused by disturbances within the country, or the Cossack brigands at the delta of the Volga. There was unrest with local notables, for example, in Shlrvan on the death of 'Abd-Allah Khan, and an almost perpetual state of Turkish - Persian hostilities. All this reached its climax in the anarchical state of Persia between the death of Shah Tahmasp and the accession of Shah 'Abbas I. There does appear also to have been some deterioration in the accommodation and protection offered to travellers, for a number of the English merchants died or were slain on their journey in the last quarter of the century. The comments of the merchant Laurence Chapman, perhaps prejudiced, were far from flattering. "To travell in this countrey", he wrote, "is not onely miserable and uncomfortable, for lacke of townes and villages to harbour in when night commeth, and to refresh men with wholesome victualles in time of need, but also scarsitie of water, that sometime in three dayes journey together is not found any droppe fit for man or beast to drinke, besides the great danger we

stand in for robbing by these infidels, who do account it remission of sinnes to wash theyr hands in the bloud of one of us. Better it is, therefore, in mine opinion, to continue a begger in England during life then to remaine a rich merchant seven yeeres in this countrey, as some
shall well finde at theyr comming hither."1 Yet, whatever the disturbances caused by local conditions, the Turks made strenuous efforts to procure the silk needed for the looms of Bursa and the revenues of the state. They used political pressure to supplement economic efforts in this as in other areas that touched their vital interests. Not only did the Turks control the routes across Anatolia which came through Erzerum, but they also controlled those to Aleppo along the Upper Euphrates valley after defeating the Persians at Chaldiran in 920/1514 and the Mamluks at Marj Dabiq in 922/1516, and those across the desert as a result of their capture of Baghdad in 941/1534. Thus in the middle of the ioth/i6th century the Turks controlled all the western outlets for Persian silk. It was not surprising that they reacted to the threat of a new northern outlet after the Russian capture of Astrakhan in 1554 and took counter measures. In the first place there was a cessation of Turkish—Persian hostilities signalised by the Peace of Amasya on 8 Rajab 962/29 May 1555. As a response to Russian probing advances to the Crimea, the Grand Vizier, Mehmed Soqollii, conceived of the plan to isolate the Russians, link up with the Muslim khanates of Central Asia and deprive the Persians of their silk-growing territories. The Russians were not only a potential threat to the political and religious prestige of the Turks but a real threat to their trading interests. It was for these reasons that the Don-Volga canal project was opposed. "The Muslims were angry and afraid of Moscow gaining the great commercial roads and market places and thus bringing the trade of the Muslim countries into their own hands. The Ottoman Empire, struggling in the Indian Ocean with the Portuguese for the pilgrim and commercial routes, would certainly have wished to revive the central-Asian—Astrakhan-Crimean road. If a canal could be made at the point where the Don and the Volga are nearest to each other, supplies and ammunition could be brought directly by ships from the Black Sea to the Caspian... it would be possible to subjugate Shirvan, Karabagh and the whole of Georgia,

and thus the Ottoman Empire could attack the innermost parts of
Iran."1 It was a geopolitical enterprise on a vast scale for the period, but it failed, for the idea outran the resources. Besides, Turkey and its Crimean allies were not only suspicious of each other but differed in their objectives. Astrakhan was sacked in 1569 and Moscow burnt by the Tartars a year later, but these were pyrrhic victories over a Russia that was then ill-prepared to sustain a long campaign, but which once more found its chief ally in the arduous winter climate. The Turkish setback was serious but not irreparable. The Turks made peace with the Venetians and bided their time on their eastern front when they could strike a blow at Persia, which besides being an old enemy was the ally of two adversaries, Russia and Portugal. Indeed Persia "was a potential link between the two vast areas of the Portuguese 'oceanic' front and the Russian 'fluvial' front". Once again Persia was threatened because of its strategic position astride the land mass connecting Europe and Asia. The Turkish menace, however, then receded, but Persia's problems remained. The death of Shah Tahmasp occasioned internal disorders in Persia of which the Turks took advantage and annexed most of Azarbaljan, Georgia, Shlrvan, Luristan and parts of Gilan. Turkey controlled the main ports on the Caspian and the silk-producing areas and eventually consolidated her hold by the treaty signed with the young monarch Shah 'Abbas in 998/1590. Thereafter, as long as Persian silk remained a commodity in request till the latter part of the 18th century, Turkish and Russian routes competed.
(c) The southern area
Hurmuz throughout the 16th century continued to play its important trading role, having a "greate traffique", according to Van Linschoten, for "it is the staple for all India, Persia, Arabia and Turkie, and of all the places and Countries about the same, and commonly it is full of Persians, Armenians, Turkes, and all nations, as also Venetians, which lie there to buy spices and precious stones, that in great abundance are brought thether [of all parts] of India, and from thence are sent overland to Venice, and also carried throughout all Turkie, Armenia,

Arabia, Persia and every way. There are likewise brought thether, all manner of marchandises from the same Countries, that is from Persia out of the Countrie called Coracone and Dias, and other places, great store of rich Tapestrie [and Coverlets] which are called Alcatiffas [carpets]: out of Turkie all manner of Chamlets: out of Arabia divers sortes of Drugges for Poticaries, as Sanguis Draconis, Manna, Mirre, Frankinsence and such like, divers goodly horses, that are excellent for
breeding, all manner of most excellent Orientall Pearles..."1 There appears to be no significant change in the goods and commodities passing through Hurmu2, in spite of the Portuguese pass system controlling the movements of local shipping or the exactions of Portuguese officials who claimed extra duties on trade there. Van Linschoten mentions the larls coined at Lar from fine silver and "brought thether in great quantities, whereby there is as great dealing with them, as with other merchandises, because of the greate gaine that is gotten by them and in India they goe very high". The treasure drain to India had commenced long before the arrival of European companies there in the nth/17th Century. At Diu, Cambay and Chaul there continued to exist much traffic to Hurmuz, subject to Portuguese pass restrictions. An indication of the rising power of the Mughals was the growing importance of Agra, which had become a "great resort of merchants from Persia and out of India, and very much merchandise of silk and cloth and of precious stones, both rubies, Diamonds and Pearls". Van Linschoten stated that the reason for such a great traffic was that "every yeare twice there commeth a great companie of people over land which are called Caffiles or Carvanes, which come from Aleppo, out of the Countrie of Surie three dales iornie from Tripoli which lyeth uppon the west of the Mediterranean Sea,... in the months of April and September. There is a Captaine and certain hundreths of Iannisaries, which connvaye the said Caffila untill they come to the Towne of
Bassora, from whence they travaile by water unto Ormus."2 The merchants were informed of the movements of the caravans, which were protected against marauding Arabs. At Basra they regrouped on the way down to Hurmuz or up to Aleppo, "whereby all manner of merchandises, out of all places are brought thether in great abundance, by great numbers of traveling Marchants". It was, quite clearly, true

437



TRADE
that "Basra continued to be, in the mid 16th century, an active centre
of commerce with Asia".1 Not only is the testimony of the customs registers conclusive, but contemporary literary evidence is corroborative. "There is a trade with Hurmuz, whence come all Indian wares: with Barhen, Catifa, Lasan, Persia, Baghdad, and all Arabia there
abouts".2 It was equally apparent that some Venetian merchants had established themselves well in Hurmuz, such as the Stropene family who resented the appearance of three English traders there in 1583. The Portuguese at Lisbon informed those on Hurmuz that "you shall take great heed that neither these people nor other similar ones be allowed in those parts, the which you shall order to be specially guarded against at the fortress of Ormuz, which is the gateway by which they are
chiefly likely to enter".3 This the Venetians did so successfully that the Portuguese authorities arrested the English merchants and sent them off to Goa, from which they subsequently escaped. In this case as over other Europeans, the Spanish and Portuguese, whose crowns were united in 15 8o, were very strict. It was not simply that there was rivalry in Europe but a sense of insecurity arising from the arrival of English and Dutch shipping, which was penetrating further and more frequently into oceans that had been considered exclusively for the use and benefit of the Spanish and Portuguese. The Turks had reacted to the threat posed by the Portuguese astride their maritime routes to the east with seafaring expeditions mounted at great cost to challenge the Portuguese from 15 20 to 1585. In spite of limited successes, they failed to dislodge the Portuguese; but they unsettled them. Because of this activity, the pertinacity of established traders, the increasing security of the routes across Arabia, the desire of Portuguese governors at Hurmuz to profit from trade and the ingenuity of local shippers, the Portuguese authorities were never able officially to operate an effective embargo on trade from the east through Hurmuz towards Basra and through Baghdad to Aleppo. The proportion of the total trade in Hurmuz may have fallen, but the volume remained significant and Hurmuz prospered. This state of affairs lasted till the end of the second decade of the 17th century. After Hurmuz

was captured by the Persians in 1031/1622 and practically destroyed, its place as a port was taken by Gombroon, renamed Bandar 'Abbas, on the mainland opposite, a mile or so away.
(d) Conclusion
Throughout the ioth/i6th century, in spite of frequent Persian Turkish hostilities, the external trade of Persia persisted. In terms of Persian exports the main commodity was silk, which was exported in quantity to Turkey where it was either consumed in the Turkish silk industry based at Bursa or purchased by Venetian merchants for European markets. The silk from the northern provinces of Persia also provided the raw material for the main weaving centres of Yazd, Kashan, and Kirman. Trade to and from Central Asia flagged and did not revive significantly till early in the nth/17th century, when the Russian expansion to the Caspian was consolidated. The enterprise of English traders between 15 60 and 15 80 was an interesting development bringing a new trading force onto the Persian economic scene, but their efforts to re-route Persian trade from its Levant-orientated axis to a northerly one failed in the face of Turkish, Venetian and Armenian opposition. It did, however, demonstrate clearly the close connection between the cloth and silk trades, for they were a complementary exchange. Without cloth exports English traders would not have had the resources to pay for silk imports, lacking the greater Venetian supplies of silver currency. In the south, notwithstanding the arrival of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean and their control over Hurmuz, goods from India and the East Indies continued to reach Hurmuz in quantities for onward shipment up the Gulf and across Arabia or through Persia to Mediterranean ports. Persia, though becoming a stronger power, did not reap the advantages from this transit trade owing to the Portuguese control over the revenues obtained at Hurmuz. Persia realised the importance of this trade but lacked the power to have its rights protected.
4. THE REIGN OF SHAH 'ABBAS I
{a) Introduction
The economic, like the political, condition of Persia at the opening of the reign of Shah 'Abbas I was very unstable. The turmoil of the civil
439



TRADE
war prior to his accession had adversely affected trade. The arbitrary exactions of provincial governors, the lack of responsible central authority, tribal confusion and the atmosphere of uncertainty caused by two erratic monarchs and their courts were not conducive to trade. There were hostilities with the Turks, whose occupation of the main silk-producing provinces and whose incursions around the towns and along the routes severely affected the Persian silk trade and its connections with the eastern Mediterranean. The intermittent insurrections of parts of Georgia, Armenia and elsewhere were a constant drain on resources. The southern trade which flowed into and up the Persian Gulf through Hurmuz and which was fairly strictly controlled by the Portuguese, both officially and unofficially, was gradually lessening. Although some Persian merchants and shipping continued to participate in the seaborne trade with north-west India, Arabia, the east coast of Africa and beyond, many of the caravans were bypassing Persia and going through Mesopotamia. The arrival of Dutch and English trading ships in the Indian Ocean to challenge Portuguese and Spanish dominance there upset the Portuguese navigational pass system whereby they had attempted to control the local shipping routes. As a result such shipping increasingly suffered. Although it was not completely damaged, it became more cautious in its sailings, so reducing the volume of its trade. In the north-east the disturbances among the Uzbeks and their incursions into Khurasan hardly promoted trade. The overland routes through Kabul and Qandahar were suffering not only from Uzbek attentions but also from Akbar's activities to consolidate his empire. All these developments reacted adversely upon trade, disrupting but not entirely preventing it. Indeed one of the economic constants among the variables of economic history was concisely expressed by one of the first English traders to Persia in 1618: "Marchantes muste hazard that will trade." Thus Shah 'Abbas inherited an unpromising political and economic legacy. As long as the trading routes to the east were under the control of the Uzbeks, whilst the Portuguese dictated the course of trade in the south and the Turks possessed the silk-producing provinces in the north-west, Persia was almost economically strangled. Without revenue, Persia was without power. The manner in which Shah 'Abbas defeated the Uzbeks, restored the silk-producing provinces to Persian sovereignty and acquired possession of Hurmuz is recounted
440



THE REIGN OF SHAH ABBAS I
in chapter 5. It was a prerequisite not only for the resumption of trading on the previous scale but for an expansion of Persian trade, upon which Shah 'Abbas placed such a vital emphasis and to which he devoted so much effort.
(b) Early policy
There are two main aspects of Persian trade to be considered in this period. Firstly, there was the maximum advantage to be derived from exporting the produce and manufactures of Persia. Secondly, there was the revenue to be obtained from the transit trade, which was always a feature of Persian economic life by virtue of its position astride the great land routes connecting Europe and Asia. Shah 'Abbas recognised that the key to Persian economic prosperity lay in silk, the export of which he fostered and controlled himself. This was the one commodity in which Persia was then pre-eminent. The provinces of Georgia, Shlrvan and Gllan had the right climatic and soil conditions for the growth of mulberry trees, upon the leaves of which the silkworms fed before they became the chrysalises, having spun around their cocoon the light gossamer silk threads. The damp, close humid atmosphere was right for the rearing of silkworms and the region was famous for its silk industry. The total production of silk seems to have been increasing from the early part of the ioth/i6th century not only in Persia, but in the Levant, the islands of the Aegean, and Italy. Silk became an important element in the Turkish economy and was contributing greatly to the revenue of the Ottoman treasury, apart from dues, services, hire, lodging and general expenses exacted from and disbursed by the caravans traversing the country. For Persia the exports of silk were crucially important, for whilst Persia generally had an unfavourable balance of trade with the east, it was favourable with the west. With the proceeds from the sales of silk Persia principally imported cloth but, most important, coined money was acquired without which a circulating Persian coinage would have been almost impossible. Persia did not have any real gold or silver mines and as there were not enough exports to balance the imports of cotton goods, spices and drugs from the east, the balance was made up in money, part of the flow of precious metals eastwards. As the ioth/i6th century progressed and the volume of silver arriving in Europe from South America increased, setting off with other factors a
441



TRADE
significant price rise, so did inflationary pressures mount and the Persian need for silver grow. At the same time Turkey was also experiencing many of .the same conflicting trading pressures on economic and social conditions. Some Turkish responses were to prohibit the export of precious metals to Persia, to insist on barter transactions in exchanging silk for cloth or to create more state industry to supplant Persian trade. These actions singly or together in various combinations were implemented at different times during the ioth/i6th century. Their double object was to strengthen the Turkish economy and weaken that of Persia by denying it outlets for its major export, except under conditions strictly advantageous to the Turks, thus directly reducing Persian revenue and indirectly curbing its power by depriving it of the means to purchase strategic materials. Such measures were, however, never permanently effective or successful, for the two economies were too closely interdependent. Furthermore, the Turks never developed satisfactory alternative supplies of silk nor adequately enforced their restrictions. Conversely, all the reasons pressing the Turks to extend their hold over the Persian silk trade applied to Persia; but, weaker both politically and militarily, Persia had been unable to exert much pressure on Turkey. Nevertheless it was not a state of affairs which could be long contemplated with equanimity by Shah 'Abbas I. Whilst his enthusiasm for the possibilities of foreign trade may have been whetted by the opportune arrival of the English adventurer Sir Anthony Sherley in Qazvln, when the shah had just returned in triumph from his victories over the Uzbeks in 1007/1598, there were earlier precedents for Persian attempts to bypass the Turks either through Russia or with Venetians. The range of possibilities, however, was extended as a result of the English and Dutch maritime presence in the Indian Ocean. The Cape route added a new dimension to the issue, for it would be invulnerable to Turkish countermeasures and as such had a strong appeal to Shah 'Abbas. Yet more immediate was the need to restore the territorial integrity of Persia by reoccupying the silk-producing provinces and expelling the Turks. The shah envisaged that this could be accomplished in collaboration with certain European powers, to whom he despatched Sir Anthony Sherley. He was prepared to offer, in return for such assistance, a share in the monopoly of the Persian silk exports and privileged trading opportunities. He sought papal support by promising to tolerate the residence of Christian missionaries.
442



THE REIGN OF SHAH ABBAS I
During the crucial two decades of his struggles with the Turks, Shah 'Abbas waited vainly for any decisive intervention on the part of the European powers. The initial Sherleian mission failed because of its inability to persuade any of the countries visited to take any real action and because of mistrust amongst its members aggravated by the recriprocal antipathy of Sir Anthony Sherley and his Persian colleague, Husain 'All Beg. It was a pattern that was frequently repeated in the embassies of Shah 'Abbas to Europe, which were more memorable for their internal dissensions than their actual successes. The Sherleian mission was followed by others to Venice, Rome and Spain. Venice was reluctant to jeopardise its relations with Turkey. The Pope was enthusiastic but ineffectual. Spain was interested, but Persia was insignificant compared to its more pressing problems of the Dutch and English penetrating oceans that were once considered exclusively within the Spanish and Portuguese sphere. These embassies produced no tangible evidence of a European commitment to an alliance with Persia against the Turks. Communications were long, distances great, trust ephemeral; and, besides, a certain trade with Turkey was not to be hazarded for a hypothetical one with Persia. Another concerted attempt was made with the mission of Anthony Sherley's brother, Robert, who had been left behind by his brother in Persia as a hostage and had distinguished himself in Persian military service and as a minor provincial governor. He was sent in 1607 to persuade the Spaniards to establish a silk staple at Hurmuz and ship it to Europe in association with Persian and Armenian merchants. The Spanish were reluctant to become involved in such a trade, for they did not possess adequate facilities to handle it themselves and so would have had to rely upon others to dispose of the silk at no great profit to themselves. Also they were unwilling to waive customs and duties, thereby reducing the advantages to the Persians and Armenians in promoting such a trade. Furthermore, although the Spaniards and Portuguese had been united under one crown since 15 80, they did not, as it were, speak with one voice. The Portuguese resentment of any Spanish interference in their affairs in the east resulted in the failure to formulate any agreed policy. It was a mass of contradictory decisions. Since Goa and Hurmuz would have been the main administrative and trading centres in such an enterprise, Portuguese cooperation was essential. Sir Robert Sherley's subsequent visits to Rome, Holland and England were also inconclusive. Although he was well received by the

TRADE
English court he was rejected by the majority of English merchants. Some time before Sir Robert Sherley returned to Persia in 1615, Shah 'Abbas had realised that an alliance was unlikely, for he had received little beyond missionary solicitude and expressions of support. After his victories over the Turks in 1608, with his recovery of much of the silk-producing area, a fragile peace ensued and he started to assert his authority in the south. His general, Imam Qull Khan, reduced Laristan and captured the mainland areas with the port and fort of Gombroon opposite the island of Hurmuz and took Bahrain in 1614, which had been occupied by small Portuguese garrisons. These successes had an undoubted prestige value but were not militarily or economically significant whilst shipping was still controlled from Hurmuz itself. They marked, nevertheless, the determination of Shah 'Abbas to reassert Persian claims of sovereignty over lost territories, freedom for its trade, and an end to an intolerable political and religious situation aggravated by Portuguese behaviour. Carmelite missionaries had clearly remarked on the likelihood of such action some years before. Since the Persians were no match for Portuguese sea power and since the fort on Hurmuz was virtually impregnable to any assault unaccompanied by artillery, in which the Persians were deficient, there was no real danger to the Portuguese. The Persians for their part realised that they stood little chance of wresting Hurmuz. from the Portuguese without naval and military assistance. Before Shah 'Abbas could attempt to exploit his success in the south, three events occurred, each of which had its own significance and which taken together presaged important developments. Firstly, hostilities with the Turks, which had been smouldering, broke out again in 1024/1615, and the shah found himself hard pressed. So once again Persian silk exports were at risk without alternative markets. Secondly, Sir Robert Sherley arrived back from his disappointing European embassy and within a short time he was despatched again, primarily on a mission to Spain. His task was threefold: to renew the call for an alliance, to reassure the Spaniards over Hurmuz but maintain the Persian claims to the mainland, and to revive the proposals for trade. The third event was the arrival in Isfahan of two Englishmen, sent by the Council of the East India Company at Surat, to investigate the possibilities for trade with Persia. The English company, which had established itself in Surat in 1612 against Portuguese opposition, had failed to find adequate outlets for quantities of cloth, the main English

THE REIGN OF SHAH ABBAS I
export item, and was looking for other markets. The shah, impatient at his failure to induce the Spanish to take up the trade and still very anxious to lessen his dependence on Turkish-controlled export channels, affirmed the opportunities for trade and authorised the necessary permission and privileges to the English company. Perhaps his main consideration was that an English interest would more than counterbalance that of the Portuguese on Hurmuz and that he would be able to play one off against the other. He may also have been hoping for a supply of armaments, which he was being denied by the Portuguese but which he needed against the Turks. At all events, the first English group of merchants arrived off Jask on 4 December 1616 to inaugurate trade with Persia, notwithstanding the lack of enthusiasm of the English ambassador to the Mughal court, Sir Thomas Roe. Roe was apprehensive over the attitudes of the Portuguese and the Turks, who would see their interests threatened if English trade became settled and who would take counter-measures to prevent its establishment. The ambassador was convinced that when Persia and Turkey made peace trade would return to its traditional channels and the shah would break his promises to divert it southwards. He doubted whether the volume of trade would support the expenditure or provide a sufficient exchange of commodities or enough money to make it profitable. His caution was reasonable. Although Shah 'Abbas had accomplished much, the state of the country was not really settled. The shah did not receive complete support and he was suspicious of the intentions of his family and court, as revealed by his later murder of his eldest son. Not all his court agreed that the warfare against the Turks should be sustained until the Persians had won decisively, and many proposed peace on terms that were unacceptable to the shah. Money was in extremely short supply, and only the shah himself was trading on any scale. The crisis was weathered and the shah emerged more powerful than ever. Peace was concluded with the Turks on satisfactory terms in 1027/1618 and the long "Hundred Years' War" with Turkey was almost over. Shah 'Abbas, with his western and northern frontiers guaranteed and his trade routes to the Mediterranean again open, was free to turn his attention to the south and east. Conclusive evidence of his intentions is indicated by his attitude to the Spanish ambassador from Philip III, Don Garcia de Silva y Figueroa. He left him in no doubt in 1617 that he was not prepared to discuss Spanish claims to the mainland or

TRADE
return the island of Bahrain. The English merchants, meanwhile, had not made an impressive appearance, for, lacking supplies, short of money, opposed by the merchants, abused by the officials and uncertain of their prospects, they were quite unprepared and unable to make any extensive purchases of silk, only obtaining 71 bales in their first two years. They persevered, expecting better prospects. The shah approved of their presence, even if he was disappointed with their purchases, for they might be persuaded to assist him one day against the Portuguese. Equally, he was not prepared to offend the Portuguese without cause, for he was still dependent upon their goodwill over the trade on Hurmuz. He had his reservations about the English, for he had seen little evidence of their power, but this opinion was changed as a result of the English company's successes at sea against the Portuguese off Hurmuz in 1621. The following year a pretext was found to hold the bales of silk bought by the English on the point of being shipped out. Restoration was made conditional upon the English company's fleet assisting the Persians to bombard the Portuguese forts on Kishm and Hurmuz and ferry Persian soldiers across the sea to assault the Portuguese garrison. Inadequately defending themselves, the Portuguese capitulated and the Persians under Imam Qull Khan occupied Hurmuz.
(c) Persian trade in the second decade of the ijth century
Thus within four years Shah 'Abbas had effectively freed Persia from the Turkish menace and the Portuguese blockade, and in the very same year he took Qandahar. All the frontiers were open and the routes free, two indispensable conditions for an expansion of Persian trade. What
then was Persian trade at this time?1 Firstly to be considered are Persian exports, and of those suitable for England silk was the most important. It is described as coming principally from four main areas: Georgia, which had three kinds, Ardass, Ardasett and Canaree and which produced about 60,000 mans, but in 1618 only produced 30,000 mans because "at present in regard of the last warrs in those partes the Countrye is much dyvasted and dispeopled" and it sold for 220 shdhis a
man2; Gllan, where silk came from several regions such as Lahijan and

THE REIGN OF SHAH ABBAS I
Rasht, producing about 81,000 mans selling for between 220 and 236 shahis a man; Mazandaran, producing 57,000 mans selling for 200 shahis a man; and Khurasan, producing 34,000 mans of very fine silk which was unsuitable for carrying to Europe, but of which a considerable quantity was carried overland to India via Lahore or transported by ship from Hurmuz to Sind, worth between 350 and 360 shahis a man. Some silk was also produced in Kirman, Yazd and a few other places. Thus it was estimated that the total production of Persian silk then was 232,000 mans (2,900,000 lbs. or 125 tons), of which a third was retained for internal uses to be made into carpets or textiles. Textiles included velvets made in Yazd and Kashan of all colours, costing between 120 and 200 shahis a length of 6 | yards, many satins, damasks and taffetas which were in good supply, usually 26 inches wide and 6 | yards long, worth 48 shahis a piece. The taffetas were comparable to similar European kinds, but the other textiles were less esteemed. Cloths of gold and silver made in Isfahan, Kashan or Khurasan varied greatly in price according to the quality and work, from 200 to 2,000 shahis. There were bezoar stones from Kirman, turquoises, a royal monopoly, from Khurasan, civet, opium which was better than that grown in India, and all kinds of nuts and fruits such as walnuts, pistachios, almonds, prunes, raisins and dates. Among the goods for India were runds (madder), used as a red dye, mostly grown around Ardabll but procurable in Isfahan, costing 10 shahis a man and carried overland in quantities into India via Qandahar; saltpetre, which although obtained at Lar was a royal monopoly and its export prohibited; pearls fished off Bahrain, of which the best were supposed to be reserved for the shah and were better than any to be found elsewhere in the world; rosewater worth 6j shahis for 1^ gallons and other essences, besides silk and textiles already mentioned. First among the commodities from England vendible in Persia were cloths, either broad cloths in various bright colours, of which in lengths of 32 yards, costing £\o—£\z pounds each, between 600 and 1,000 might be sold yearly for 34—36 shahis a yard, or kersies, a rougher cloth. Tin, of which 40—50 tons a year were used in Persia, came principally from Malacca and was worth 48—50 shahis a man; brass was not required; quicksilver not much requested, being sold for 140-145 shahis a man. Lead was almost as cheap as in England, for it was mined in the country, as was iron in Gllan and Hamadan, worth 7 shahis a man. Copper was greatly used for all kinds of utensils and, as it

TRADE
was an import prohibited by the Portuguese, was brought in overland from India at great charge: in plates it was worth 40—44 shahls a man, in ingots 34-36 shahls a man. Hides, of which 300-400 were sold annually, were used for saddles, coarse carpets and drinking vessels and worth, according to quality and size, 50-80 shahls each; furs were in demand, for "noe man in the cold season is without a coate lyned with one furre or other". A limited quantity of vermilion, worth 180-224 shahls a man, and cochineal, worth 2,400 shahls a man; some walrus teeth, 80-100 mans annually, worth 190-200 shahls a man, and large coral beads, worth 24-30 shahls each depending on their size for use as prayer beads, would sell. Ornaments of all kinds were wanted. Indian goods which could be disposed of in Persia included metals such as copper, iron and steel, the last of which was expensive in Persia owing to it being another commodity prohibited by the Portuguese and carried into Persia overland from India. White calicoes in particular and Indian cloth in general sold well in Persia in various qualities and kinds at differing prices to good profit. Sashes, of which there were innumerable varieties from different places such as Agra and Patna, and coloured cloths from Ahmadabad, Agra and Lahore used for lining coats and quilt coverings had good sales. Powdered sugar was consumed from Bengal, Siirat, Agra and Lahore, and some 300 tons were sold yearly at 19—20 shahls a man, as well as sugar candy. It was transported by ship or brought overland from India. Conserves, such as ginger and "mirabolins", had a limited sale of about 1,000 mans. Some cassia fistula, a medical product from the leaves of the Pudding Pipe tree, and aloes from Socotra had a limited sale. Of saffron from Daibul about 10,000 mans could be sold yearly, and of "cardemons" from Cannanore about 2,000 mans for 54—5 8 shahls a man. Of gumlack from Siam, worth 64-70 shahls a man, about 5,000 mans annually, and of indigo about 100 churls, worth 36-38 shahls a man for the Biana
kind and 22—24 f°r Serquess, were used for dyeing. A considerable amount of camphor, worth 230—240 shahls a man, was imported for funeral purposes. Coffee brought in from Moccha costing 24-26 shahls a man was drunk "heere as tobacco in England for idlenesse". About 2,000 mans of tamarind were sold for 6-8 shahls a man. Packaging materials such as rough cloths, cord and cotton wool for bags and bales were expensive. Some 20,000 sheets of paper from Ahmadabad were imported, costing about 3 shahls a sheet. The main commodities received from the East Indian islands and
448



THE REIGN OF SHAH ABBAS I
Ceylon were spices. It was thought that ioo tons of pepper were sold annually at 30—36 shahls a man, 10 tons of cloves from 90—100 shahls a man, and a small quantity of mace, nutmeg and cinnamon. Chinese goods imported included "all sorts of China ware [which] are heere both in greate esteeme and use which beinge sorted of all si2es, pryces and fashions will vend heere at least 100 tonns per annum", ginger, camphor and China roots. Logwood from Pegu in Siam or Cochin on the Indian coast was used in dyeing, some 5,000 mans being sold at 3 2 and 20 shahls a man respectively. Whilst this list seems reasonably complete, it must be remembered that it is primarily concerned with goods bought or sold in Persia, but not necessarily all consumed there. Furthermore, because it is concerned primarily with English interests there are some omissions. Wine, galls marketed in Hamadan, goat's and fine lamb's wool are not mentioned among the exports nor precious stones among the imports. Apart from textiles and carpets, it does not provide information on industry, such as saddlery and glass-making in Shlraz, the copper and tinsmiths of Isfahan, Kirman and Kashan, the silversmiths of Tabriz, the pottery of Kirman or Mashhad. It is to be assumed that at this time most of those products were consumed within the country and did not form an appreciable percentage of exports.
(d) The arrival of the English and Dutch trading companies
Such then was the scope of Persian trade. What further measures or actions did Shah 'Abbas take to foster it? There was the deliberate attempt to encourage further foreign enterprise in Persia, not only to offset the dominant role of the overland Levant routes, but also to stimulate an expansion of trade in all directions. The Levant trade was, in any case, growing as the European trading companies became more established in Ottoman cities. Embassies were received. Relations with Bukhara and Balkh and other Central Asian khanates were intensified, partly on political, partly on economic grounds. With the Portuguese weakening, the shah especially encouraged the English and Dutch trading companies. The English East India Company, with little option, had rendered singular service in helping the Persians to force the Portuguese from their base and emporium on Hurmuz. The Persians transferred the commercial organisation of Hurmuz to Gombroon, which was renamed Bandar 'Abbas. The buildings upon
449



TRADE
Hurmuz were allowed to collapse and its fame and facilities withered away in neglect. The Persians hoped to force either the English or Dutch companies into attacking Muscat, then occupied by the Portuguese, with a view to extending Persian power to the western shore of the Persian Gulf and completely eliminating the Portuguese from the area. The English and Dutch, however, would not allow themselves to be used in this way and the Persians eventually reached an accommodation with the Portuguese in 1630 to grant them the use of the port of Kung with certain rights. This put an end to nearly twenty years of intermittent hostilities between them and opened the Persian Gulf to all shipping. The opportunities offered to the English and Dutch companies were more important. The English company was granted special privileges including relief from customs for its imports, no liability for road taxes and the half of the customs revenue from Bandar 'Abbas in return for its assistance in the capture of Hurmuz. Although possessed of them, it was not always accorded its rights, and only obtained about a tenth, at the most, of its share of the customs. The earliest agreement to trade had been obtained by Richard Steele and John Crowther in 1615 but was subsequently renegotiated and later confirmed on the accession of Shah Safiin 1038/1629. It lasted with relatively little alteration till the reign of Shah Sultan Husain and corresponded in broad terms to the treaties concluded with the Dutch in 1624 and the French in 1664. In principle, the articles granted the residence of an English representative in Persia or a Persian one in England; and fair treatment at the ports of entry according to local conditions and charges so that traders would not be abused. In the event of shipwreck, no hindrance to salvage was to be offered or theft committed. There was freedom to travel anywhere within the country for the purpose of buying and selling goods without restrictions; religious toleration on all sides; and permission to keep and use arms in the defence of person or property. If a man was killed in the act of robbery, the English were not to be called to account for it, or if he was taken the robber was to be punished in the presence of the English; but if he was an Englishman, the English were to have the right to take what action they thought fit themselves. The possession of a residence was confirmed for the duration of their stay; the English Representative was responsible for the punishment of offending Englishmen without recourse to the local judiciary; respect was to be shown at all times to the nominated deputy
450



THE REIGN OF SHAH ABBAS I
of the chief representative. They were guaranteed protection against offences by local people wherever it might be; respect to be shown to all employees of the English and no man to be prohibited their service; the redemption of any slaves from Turkey proved to be English on due payment to the master; no interference in the estate of any Englishman dying in Persia and the right to a proper burial; the return of orphaned children born of Christian parents to the Representative. Ordinary English merchants were to pay no more customs than were exacted in the Ottoman empire at Aleppo or Istanbul, and if any losses occurred along the routes, the road guards were responsible for finding the goods or paying their value upon an affidavit sworn in the presence of a priest or representative. Any dispute between English merchants involving less than £66 was to be decided in the presence of an English representative according to Persian law, and if for a greater amount the same procedure was to be followed, but in the presence of the Representative. And lastly, any goods not disposed of were to be allowed to
be returned without difficulty.1 The Dutch United East India Company first arrived in Persia on 20 June 1623, when Huybert Visnich, as chief merchant, landed from the Heusden at Bandar 'Abbas. He had been sent by Pieter Van den Broecke, who had been appointed the first Dutch director for Arabia, Persia and India in 1620. The Dutch soon made their presence felt and claimed and won the same customs privileges as the English. They soon became the leading importer of spices into Persia. An agreement was concluded in 1624. There was intense rivalry between the English and Dutch companies in the east, and the Dutch soon vaunted to the Persians their superior resources. The English, less well provided, resented this Dutch intrusion, for "they have builded uppon our foundations and reaped where wee had plowne". The Dutch mainly sold spices, purchased silk and obtained ready money through the favourable balance of trade which they were building up with Persia. The English, almost on the point of abandoning Persian trade in 1625, were reluctant to go, "lest our refusall should induce itts delyverie to the Dutch", and so remained after better assurances of support from the shah. Meanwhile, in London from 1623 to 1626, Sir Robert Sherley on his

TRADE
second mission was once again endeavouring to persuade English merchants to take a more active part in Persian trade. Now that the Portuguese had been removed from Hurmuz, the Persians, he argued, could defend their shores themselves if only they were provided with "prefabricated" galleys which could be assembled in the Persian Gulf. When English merchants claimed they could not cope with all the Persian silk exported, not having a sufficient range of suitable goods, nor adequate supplies of ready money, he suggested that Persian merchants "may passe ther goods in such Englishe shippinge as goes ordynarily thether, And which your Merchants are not able to lade themselves, paying such ffraytage as Merchants, with Merchants, may agree upon". It was a shrewd and interesting approach aimed at overcoming the inadequacies of Persian shipping and opening up new and unrestricted markets for Persian merchants by utilising the recently opened sea routes. At the same time it offered a means of overcoming the chronic shortage of ready money for foreign investments that afflicted English and most other European trading for most of the 17th century. James I was impressed with Sherley's advocacy and recommended the English merchants that "you take into your serious consideration and care both the furtherance and manner of settleing of it, as may bee best for the weale of our Kingdome". The king might propose it, but it was the merchants who decided. The East India Company was very reluctant to get entangled with Sherley, and the Levant Company objected to the idea. At this stage Shah 'Abbas took the last of his diplomatic trade initiatives. He despatched embassies to England and Holland, the first under Naqd 'All Beg, which arrived early in February 1626 at Portsmouth in the Star, and the second under MQsa Beg, which arrived on 9 February in the same year. Little is known of the exact circumstances in which these embassies were despatched, but certain explanations are likely. Shah 'Abbas probably recognised that the presence of both the English and Dutch companies in Persia was counterbalancing and favourable to Persia. He therefore probably decided to treat both countries impartially, and as he was hoping to conclude a treaty with the Dutch it was an opportune moment to confirm his interest in England. Be that as it may, it is likely that a renewal of hostilities between the Persians and Turks over Baghdad and unrest in Anatolia were adversely affecting trade again and raised once more the question of alternative markets. The Portuguese, dispossessed of Hurmuz, were
452



THE REIGN OF SHAH ABBAS I
still harrying the Persian coasts and interfering with shipping, so protection was necessary. The failure of a French embassy under Louis des Hayes, Baron de Courmenin, which was to have inaugurated French diplomatic and commercial relations with Persia, to materialise in 1626, together with the opposition expressed against certain Armenians at Marseilles, may have made the shah reluctant to count on French assistance. Neither of the embassies to England and Holland was particularly successful and both had their moments of Comedia del arte in Persian dress. The English responded with an embassy under Sir Dodmore Cotton, the account of which was written by Thomas Herbert but which achieved little except to offer lasting amity and goodwill. A Dutch-Persian treaty was eventually signed on 7 February 1630/1 in
Holland, more formal than the agreement of 1624 in Persia.1
(e) The encouragement of Armenians as traders in relation to the internal aspects of the trading policy of Shah 'Abbas
There are two major considerations: improvements in the local conditions for trade, and the role of the Armenians. The prosperity of transit trade depends on the amenities provided for merchants and the security of the roads. It is uncertain whether all the improvements in trading facilities ascribed to Shah 'Abbas were in fact deliberate, but nevertheless it can be assumed that it was his concern which was responsible for the upsurge of public works throughout Persia. Doubtless in many cases the initiative taken and the costs incurred were the responsibility of the provincial governors. Sometimes buildings were due to competitive patronage, as was the case with AllahvardI Khan's elegant architectural masterpiece, his bridge at Isfahan. The result was an increase in the network of caravansarais at intervals along the main trading routes, a series of bridges spanning rivers at strategic sites, road improvements, such as the stone causeways constructed in the northern provinces of Gllan and Mazandaran and in central Persia, the building of covered bazaars, of which the one surviving in Isfahan is a visible reminder of such attention to trade. Stringent regulations were enforced by the market inspectors on the quality and price of merchandise sold to the public. The status of the judiciary and local officials was enhanced. The stationing of road

TRADE
guards (rdhddrs) along the roads, for which a tax was exacted from merchants, increased the security of the routes. General attempts to improve administrative practice and the answerability of officials were not without their beneficial effects on trade. None of these measures was in itself an innovation, since many had already been applied earlier in Persia and elsewhere, particularly in Turkey; but they certainly had beneficial affects for the economy in general. Perhaps, in the long term, the most vital contribution which Shah 'Abbas made to the Persian economy was his forced introduction into Persia of Armenians. There were many precedents for the transference of populations or groups of artisans. TTmur removed communities of craftsmen to embellish Samarqand, and Sultans Sellm and Siileyman had no scruples about uprooting people and settling them where they needed them. Shah 'Abbas made a virtue out of necessity in driving thousands of Armenians from their homelands around the northwestern frontiers with Turkey in order to implement his "scorchedearth" policy against the invading Turks in 1604 and 1608. Many thousands he dispersed throughout Gilan and Mazandaran to revive the silk-producing industry. Many died on the way or in the pestilential climate for which they were unprepared. Others were settled in areas around Isfahan to till the fertile plains there, or in areas of Azarbaijan further from the Turkish frontiers, or in Kurdistan. Many fled north into Georgia or west to Turkey. A significant group already accustomed to trading were placed in a part of Isfahan, where they were eventually allowed to develop their own thriving and independent community in New Julfa, across the Zayandarud, and were free to follow their own national customs and their Christian practices and be governed by an Armenian of their own choice. Shah 'Abbas had suffered from the malpractices of Persian mer
chants1 and he was determined to manipulate the Armenian community to his own advantage. Apart from being thrifty, hard-working and shrewd, the Armenians had a facility for languages and an ability to travel light. They appealed to Europeans, in that they were Christian in faith, if not always in practice. Since the fall of their kingdom their successes as merchants in the time of their "diaspora" had been acquired in a hard school long before they were utilised by Shah

THE REIGN OF SHAH ABBAS I
'Abbas, for many Armenians had visited Europe on trading ventures. Some were playing an increasing part in Turkish life. Others were travelling eastwards to India and beyond. They had already opposed the English factors of the Russia Company in 1561 in Qazvin. Armenians in the service of Shah 'Abbas first made their appearance in Venice. Gradually the Armenian community in Isfahan extended the range and scope of their trading activities under the patronage of the shah, assisted by his privileges and credit. The community began to prosper, and the wealthier members began building noble residences and stately churches. In 1618 they were opposing the efforts of the English factors to obtain silk when Shah 'Abbas set up an auction for it, the bidding going up to 50 tumans a load. The English complained that "the Armenians were made a stale to draw us on". Soon, however, the Armenians were freighting goods on the English company's shipping to and from Persia and India. In Europe their activities at Marseilles in 1621 aroused the wrath of French merchants who petitioned the French king "de vouloir interdire absolument a ces Armeniens et Persans toute descente de soie en votre Royaume a
peine de confiscations".1 Pietro della Valle in 1618 had advised Shah 'Abbas to break the Turkish hold on Persian trade by engaging the French, "since the intention of the King was that all the silk reach Europe without any whatsoever going through Turkey, to bring about which I say this (still with the intention of harming the Turks), that we needs must bring it about that the French come to Persia; and without them there is nothing to be done: for the French are those
who bring to the Levant the most ready money."2 There was some French and Armenian initiative afoot over Persian silk, for in 1625 the Secretary of the East India Company reported "the offer of the French Embassador of 2 millions yearely to ioyne with the English to bringe the Silke of Persia to Marsellis, but said hee had wholly dis
couraged him therein".3

TRADE
Yet, though the Armenians had only limited success in France, they fared better in Holland, where an influential group settled in Amsterdam and remained throughout the 17th and much of the 18th century. Indeed, it is in Holland that Robert Sherley's earlier suggestions of reciprocal trade which he had made to both the Portuguese and the English were most nearly accepted. In the Dutch—Persian treaty concluded in 1631 the Dutch "in return for privileges accorded to the Dutch in Persia conceded reciprocal benefits to Persian traders in the Netherlands". It was the Armenians who mostly benefited from this provision. Thus during the reign of Shah 'Abbas, whilst ostensibly remaining subordinate to the demands of the shah, who controlled the silk production and its disposal, the Armenians were already consolidating their position in the international trade of Persia and becoming an indispensable factor in its success.
( / ) Conclusion
Shah 'Abbas I stimulated the overseas trade of Persia by concerted efforts to improve the local conditions, by encouraging new foreign traders to lessen dependence on older, more easily monopolised outlets, and by utilising the services of the enterprising Armenians to widen the search for new markets and products and expand the scope of the established routes. The sea routes opened to Europe then and later never supplanted the position of the traditional overland routes linking east and west through Anatolia or Mesopotamia across northern Persia, but they certainly supplemented them. The impetus given to trade between India, Persia and the Levant which came as a result of the opening up of the Persian Gulf to all shipping was also significant. This reactivated local shipping, apart from increasing the volume and value of freight which was carried by the shipping of the Dutch and English companies. All this followed from the impressive Persian revival which was the political as well as the economic achievement of Shah 'Abbas; a legacy which, in spite of the enormous demands made upon it, outlasted the Safavids.
456



THE LATER SAFAVID PERIOD
J. THE LATER SAFAVID PERIOD
{a) Shah Soft
The pattern established by Shah 'Abbas remained substantially unaltered throughout the remainder of the Safavid period. Only in one respect was there a significant change. It concerned the royal silk monopoly which was discarded by Shah Safi. The English merchants of the East India Company commented very clearly on the change evident in the early part of Shah Safl's troubled reign, "these busie tymes where every upstart will have his voice". They reported that "the ould Emperor Shaw Abbas by his commands prohibited all men what nation soever to buy any silks unless from his hands, and to the ende all should be collected and brought into his Magazenes, hee sent his owne servants with ready Money to all places where silks grewe to buy from the Countrey people... att such rates as the owners could afforde itt, with this silke thus gained, hee complied yearlie with the English and Dutch nacons, could partt unto the Jullfaleyne Armenians att Ten Tomands the loade proffitt, which was transported by the way of Aleppo, some hee adventured with them on his proper account, and
the rest hee hoarded upp in his Magazenes."1 Shah SafI, on the other hand, "gave lycence to buy Silks in all partts of his kingdome without restricon". When he failed to honour his contracts with the English merchants he justified himself to Charles I by claiming that "in my grandfather's tyme he made Crooke that no man could buy any but himselfe and of himselfe ... but since my tyme I have broken that Crooke, that Middlemen in my country might reape the benefitt thereof: and that those who are the owners of the silke might sell itt to
whom they would".2 The merchants had no doubt about the reasons for the change and where the responsibility lay: "Jullfalleynes Armenians and other merchants of Guyland and Sherwan, who have their trade to Aleppo by their extreame bribes to his Ducks, Nobles and Ministers preven
teth him".3 The Armenians had consolidated their hold on Persian commerce, mostly over exports and imports of silk and cloth respectively, and had spread their interests into internal trade too, setting up

shops in the bazaars with a network of contacts throughout the country. Against this monopoly the efforts of the English and Dutch merchants were ineffective. They never wrested the silk and cloth trades from the Armenians, however much they "earnestly solicited transport of silk to Bandar Abbas acquainting the Kinge how honourable and profitable an action it would be to him to restore and establish the Commerce of Ormous again which had in former tymes been the
most famous mart in the World".1 After the decision of Shah SafI there was no hope of deflecting a major part of the silk and cloth trades to the seaborne routes in the face of opposition from the Armenians, with whom the European merchants had to come to terms. After the reign of Shah 'Abbas there were few confrontations between Persia and the neighbouring countries, apart from some fighting with the Turks, during which Baghdad was lost in 1048/1638, and intermittent hostilities over Qandahar with the Mughals in 1636, 1642 and 1648. Persia was generally at peace. The relative prosperity and standard of living of Europe in the 17th century was growing; its trade with the rest of the world increased, and this involved Persia too. Reliable statistical information from the 17th century is difficult to find, quantify and interpret. This is particularly true in the case of Persia, where it is not easy to differentiate trade intended for local consumption and that in transit. It is possible that a comprehensive examination of sources not so far consulted in detail, such as Turkish and Russian customs archives, where they exist, would be revealing in this respect. If, however, the volume of silk purchases made by the English Levant Company, the greater part of which came from Persia, and the customs receipts obtained by the East India Company at Bandar 'Abbas are considered, there is no doubt at all that both on the Levant routes and the southern sea routes Persian trade expanded. Moreover, Dutch and, to a lesser extent, French and Venetian purchases of Persian silk rose, not to mention direct Armenian transactions with buyers outside the main companies trading to the Levant. In the south through Bandar 'Abbas the English company's share of the customs, however imperfectly paid, rose over the century from 225 tumans in 1624 to 550 m 1631, 341 in 1634, 345 in 1637, 700 in 1640,
612 in 1643, 635 in 1648, 750 in 1651, 785 in 1652, and by 1672 it was generally assessed at 1,000. This represented only a part of the trade

THE LATER SAFAVID PERIOD
through the main ports of Bandar 'Abbas and Kung, for neither the Dutch nor the Portuguese paid customs. Furthermore many traders in little boats landed goods surreptitiously along the coast to avoid customs. Others made arrangements with the European companies to pass their goods off as belonging to the companies to escape customs, a procedure known as "colouring", greatly resented by the Persian officials but frequently used.
(b) The seaborne trade to Persia
(/) The English and Dutch companies
The direct involvement of the major European companies in the trade of Persia was almost entirely concerned with the southern routes, the seaborne traffic, although indirectly they bought Persian silk and sold cloth to Persia through Armenian middlemen, principally at Aleppo and less frequently at Smyrna and Istanbul. The English were first to land, at Jask in 1616, prematurely hopeful of obtaining 8,000 bales of silk on three years credit at 7/6d a lb. which was expected to sell for 16/- in England. Yet until the Agency of William Burt in 1627, business was uncertain, though probably some 1,700 bales of silk were shipped, purchased with ready money, English commodities and other goods, approximately a third of each. Then in a determined effort in the early 1630s, three separate "voyages" — trading ventures — were directed towards Persia, partly to test the market seriously and partly because conditions in India had deteriorated. Contracts were made with Shah Safi, renewed, and then broken by him. Between 1630 and 1640 a little over 2,000 bales were obtained from the shah at prices ranging from 45 to 50 tumans a load. After these contractsfinishedthe East India Company obtained little further supplies of silk from Persia, for the cost of obtaining it increased, its quality became unreliable and its profitability much reduced. The real reason was that the Armenian control of the market was almost complete. The East India Company realised that no progress could be made against Armenian competition and that only in association with them could they hope to increase their silk purchases and cloth sales. The mid 17th century in England, with its unsettled internal political conditions brought about by the Civil War and the three wars with the Dutch in the 1650s, 1660s and 1672, resulted in a diminished interest in Persian trade. Attention was

concentrated on India, whose exports of calicoes, silk and silk goods satisfied demand. However, after difficulties with the Mughal authorities in the 1680s, culminating in hostilities and the temporary loss of its position in Bengal, the East India Company turned seriously to Persia again and sought Armenian cooperation. Armenians who had settled in London pledged their collaboration. An agreement, therefore, was concluded in 1688 with them whereby in return for privileged treatment they would trade on behalf of the company particularly in India, where they were promised their own settlement, and elsewhere, with special reference to the silk and cloth trades. This was never very effective and in 1693 the East India Company attempted to enter into a more comprehensive agreement with five major Armenian merchants in Isfahan for a close trading partnership. A large consignment of goods amounting to £93,995.1 is yd, almost a third of all overseas investments for 1693-5, was sent to Persia to promote this association, concerning which the company wrote to the Armenians: "We shall God willing haye much more to do with you of the same kind hereafter to such a degree, that your Nations shall not need to travel to Aleppo to sell their Silk or buy their Cloth, but may do both better and cheaper in
their'own Country and at their own doors."1 There was no doubt about the purpose of this proposal, which was nothing less than "to turne the course of Trade between Persia and Aleppo, which hath continued many hundreds, it may be Thousands of Years, for the Persians etc. to buy vast quantities of Silk in the Province of Guiland, to carry it from thence to Aleppo etc., truck it there for Cloth and the Other Europe Goods, and bring that Cloth to Persia where it is finally
consumed within the Limits of our Charter".2 This English proposition threatened the interests of the Armenians and they reacted strongly, for they were not prepared to enter into a contract on terms that were tantamount to a possible commercial harakiri. They replied that "As for bringing Silk to Ispahan, yt is but wind, for nobody will be so mad, when we carry it to Aleppo: we have more ways than one to dispose of it: for there are English, French, Venetians and Dutch; if we cannot sell them for ready money, part money, cloth, Cocheneal, amber, Coral, or false pearl; then we can carry it to Europe

our Selves; but if we bring it to Ispahan there is only you to buy it, and if you won't give us a price, then we must let you have it, as you will; and take cloth of what price you will, for you won't let us put it on
board your Ships from England."1 So the ambitious project of rerouting the silk and cloth trades again failed. The land routes had withstood the challenge from the sea. The experience of the East India Company underlined, the importance of ready money to the European trader in the east, the tenacity of the traditional patterns, the crucial parts played by the local merchants and brokers and the close interdependence of the cloth and silk trades. Though the English company failed to obtain a permanent foothold over the northern-orientated trade of Persia, it achieved more success in the south, though it is not easy to be sure how much of it was due to official policy and encouragement or how much was due to the personal initiative of the company's merchants both in India and Persia who traded on their own account. The first Agent, Edward Connock, tried to encourage local merchants to use the company's shipping, indicating the advantages, "their little charge in freight, their danger less and the brevity of time in their passage least of all". The policy was continued and freightage became an important element in trading to Persia, at least up to the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652, when six English ships were destroyed off Hurmuz by the Dutch. Afterwards English shipping went into eclipse till the 1680s, when it revived again. This increased interest in Persia coincided with the Dutch company's differences with the Persians which led to their temporary occupation of Kishm in 1684 and caused a drop in their freightage. By the beginning of the 18th century Charles Lockyer, with some exaggeration, maintained that it was "a main Branch of the Company's Profit... So that I look upon English ships from Persia to Surat in the latter end of October and November, to be the richest Vessels on that side of the world", estimating them "sometimes to the Value of two or three
hundred thousand Pounds".2 Such ships would also include goods purchased in India or elsewhere for delivery in Persia or Basra. This direct trade by sea had grown significantly since the 1630s as a result of improved security, at least until the piratical activities of the Muscat Arabs towards the end of the 17th century. The deflection of trade from the overland routes

TRADE
between India and Persia in the 1640s, as a result of hostilities around Qandahar, added to the growth of the sea routes, for much of this trade never returned to the old routes. Whilst English shipping brought sugar and cloth, the Dutch brought not only these goods, but spices and copper. The Dutch company's share of Persian trade was proportionately larger than that of the English, commensurate with their greater resources and presence in the east throughout the 17th century. The Dutch too were interested in silk exports, obtaining their first deliveries in 1626, 352 bales. Thereafter, in the 1620s they were exporting about 1,200 bales a year and in the 1630s between 800 and 1,000 bales. In the 1640s they were curtailing their requirements as they had overcommitted their resources in Persia, and like the English merchants the Dutch were finding that the quality had declined and its cost increased, so they were only purchasing between 200 and 5 00 bales a year. In the early 1630s, it seemed as if another competitor for Persian silk might emerge. This was the duke of Holstein, whose mission left Hamburg for the first time in October 1633, travelled to Moscow, where it encountered many difficulties, and returned to Hamburg. Setting out again in October 1635, it reached Isfahan in August 1636 after travelling through Russia, voyaging down the Volga to Astrakhan and crossing the Caspian Sea, where the members of the mission were shipwrecked near Darband. The duke of Holstein hoped to import a considerable quantity of silk through Russia. He was quite unsuccessful, for the Russians proved obstructive, his mission incompetent, the Persians uncooperative and the English and Dutch companies hostile. The Dutch director, Nicolaas Overschie, with the connivance of the Armenians, made extensive purchases of silk to cause a shortage which put up the price. The mission departed empty-handed and rather ignominiously, after quarrelling with an Indian embassy then in Isfahan and behaving with an unfortunate disregard for Persian protocol. As a result of straining resources for some years and the fraudulent practices of some directors, the Dutch authorities at Batavia of the United East India Company made a more vigorous attempt to keep a closer hold over their Persian Agency and to reassert themselves vis-avis the Persians. They tried to raise the price of Dutch imports, lower the price of silk, increase sales of Indian and other East Indian commodities and prevent abuses over the quality and deliveries of silk. The subsequent history of relations between the Dutch company and the
462



THE LATER SAFAVID PERIOD
Persian authorities is basically one in which the Dutch are increasing their sales of imported commodities to Persia, reducing their purchases of silk and remitting the resulting trading imbalance in ready money. This policy became more important as the Japanese increasingly restricted the export of gold, silver and copper, upon which the Dutch had heavily relied for the availability of ready money. The Persians, concerned to balance their trade and reluctant to permit the flow of ready money out of the country, endeavoured to oblige the Dutch company to purchase at least 300 loads of silk yearly. These differing attitudes caused a tension in relations and resulted in mutual retaliatory activities. A Dutch embassy in Isfahan in 1644 considered itself abusively treated, and when there was a failure to reach an acceptable settlement the Dutch bombarded Bandar 'Abbas and the island of Kishm in the following year. Temporarily they obtained better terms. Another mission in 1647 was inconclusive, and the Dutch were preparing for more hostile action but desisted as the English company was benefiting from these Dutch actions. In 1651 Johan Cunaeus arrived with an impressive embassy to settle the outstanding differences of claims and counter-claims and the question of silk contracts. A silk contract for 300 loads yearly at 48 tumans the load was agreed, but little else. The real turning point in the Dutch company's fortunes in Persia resulted from the collapse of the English company's position there caused by losses to its shipping in the east from the First Anglo-Dutch War, which broke out in 1652. English energies were subsequently directed towards Europe and the West Indies against the Dutch. So during the Protectorate official interest in the east waned. The East India Company, for internal political considerations, was deprived of much of its authority and power which it did not begin to regain till after the Restoration in 1661. The Dutch, therefore, for three decades at least, had an almost free hand, for not only was there practically no English competition during this period but the Persians, deprived of the sufficiently counterbalancing power of the English, were forced to reach a less favourable arrangement with the Dutch company. Thus the Dutch exercised a dominating position in the southern trade, though not an exclusive one, for local shipping, in particular Indian and Armenian interests, was increasingly participating in that trade. The final eclipse of Portuguese power in the Persian Gulf with the loss of Muscat in 1649 stimulated trade on the Arabian side. When John

Fryer was at Bandar 'Abbas in 1675 he commented that "the English Company's Trade is but small here" and that "the greatest Traffick, next Indian Cloth, comes from the Spice Trade; which the Dutch engross, beside Sugar and Copper formerly; for which they carry off Fifty thousand Thomands worth of Velvets, Silk, Raw and Wrought,
with Rich Carpets, besides many Tunn of Gold and Silver, Yearly".1 By the 1680s the price of Persian silk had fallen so low in Amsterdam that, in comparison with silk from India or brought to the Levant ports, it was unprofitable. The Dutch company was anxious to free itself from its Persian commitments and tried to accomplish this by intimidation, occupying Kishm in 1684, and by missions led by Reynier Casembroodt in 1683 and Johan Van Leenen in 1689-92, and negotiations. At that time, however, the English company was actively renewing its interest in Persia, so the Dutch did not hold all the advantage. There was, moreover, an increasing shortage of reliable ready money in Persia, caused by royal hoarding, non-productive luxury expenditure, the debasement of the currency and its eastward flow through Persia to India, in spite of efforts to prevent this taking place, and an increasing monetisation of the economy which exerted a growing pressure on supplies of reliable coinage. Thus the Persians were all the more reluctant to let the Dutch company continue to import on the same scale whilst reducing its silk purchases. Fortunately for Persia at this time, supplies of silk from India lessened and those from the Levant suffered from hostilities waged by England and Holland against France, which made the Mediterranean insecure for fleets. Therefore, in 1694 an agreement was reached for 300 loads at 44 tumans a load. At this time, when the demand for Persian silk again outran supply, the Persians attempted to exert pressure on the English and Dutch companies to cooperate with them in an attack on Muscat, whose corsairs were attacking shipping and plundering along the Persian coast. Neither company was agreeable, though the Persians persisted in their efforts. When Jacobus Hoogkammer arrived in Persia in 1701 he was unable to renew the contract on the old terms, for the price demanded for silk was 48 tumans a load or 200 bales at 44 tumans with sufficient douceurs. This state of affairs lasted till the end of the Safavid period, the Dutch continuing to import spices and textiles on a large

scale and refusing assistance over Muscat. Throughout this period there was a sizeable colony of Armenians in Amsterdam, who maintained a network of contacts throughout the Levant and who increasingly turned their attention to Russia.
(/;') The French and Portuguese
The French were not nearly so long represented in Persia as the English and Dutch companies, and exerted very little official influence in the 17th century, though many individuals successfully traded there, as the examples of Tavernier and Chardin show. French policy was strongly affected by the traditional friendship with Turkey and the commercial ties of Marseilles with the Levant. In spite of the early interest of Cardinal Richelieu and the establishment of a Capuchin mission under Pere Pacifique de Provins in Isfahan in 1627, trading connections with Persia were insignificant, though some Armenians managed to trade under difficult conditions in Marseilles. It was not until the interest of Colbert had been aroused that some concerted action was taken to establish the real French presence in Persia. Colbert's objective was to "tirer de la main des Anglais et des Hollandais tout le commerce du Levant par une grande concurrence quel
conque ou les Francais trouvassent un benefice".1 This led to the establishment, on 26 May 1664, of La Compagnie des Indes. On 11 July 1665 a mission from the company arrived in Isfahan composed of Messieurs de Lalin and de la Boulaye Le Gouz, nominated by the French king, and Messieurs Beber, Dupont and Mariage, appointed by the company. An agreement was reached for trading privileges, but the behaviour of certain members of the mission left an unfavourable impression and little resulted from its visit. In 1672 Louis XIV, who had become actively interested in and concerned about the persecution of Armenians who professed the Catholic faith, sent Sieur de la Jonchere with an impressive retinue and presents to confirm the privileges already granted and establish a trading base at Bandar 'Abbas. De la Jonchere unfortunately died on the way and the French director at Surat, Monsieur Gueston, took charge and an agreement was signed with Shah Sulaiman in December 1671. Although the French company appointed a director at Bandar 'Abbas there was, as John Fryer noted, little to occupy him, for "The French have as little

to do at this Port as in other Places; and were it not for the Credit of their Interpreter, who gets good Profit by Wine, (he being priviledg'd with a Wine-press for that Nation at Siras, as well as the other Europe
Nations), they could not subsist".1 Colbert also encouraged Armenians to settle at Marseilles, admonishing the merchants there "de leur donner toute la protection que l'autorite de votre charge vous permettra de les garantir contre les chicanes des habitans... qui ne connaissent pas
en quoi consister leurs avantages".2 At Surat certain Armenians were suggesting loading silk on French vessels instead of transporting it overland through Turkey. Ultimately the policy of encouraging Armenians to bring their Persian trade to Marseilles foundered on the opposition of the French merchants. Ponchartrain, Colbert's successor, was obliged in respect of the Armenians to "leur imposer des condi
tions qui empecheraient de faire tort au sujets de sa Majeste".3 In other respects, however, Ponchartrain persevered with his efforts "d'examiner les moyens d'introduire... les marchandises et manufactures du royaume et lever les obstacles qui pouvaient s'y opposer..., entrer s'il etait possible en concurrence avec le commerce qu'y font les
Anglais et les Hollandais".4 Jean-Baptiste Fabre was sent to Persia for this purpose. The Fabre mission was bedevilled with roguery, intrigues and misfortune, though it had its bizarre aspects when the disguised mistress of Fabre, Marie Petit, took charge of it on her lover's death in 1706. The mission was redeemed by Pierre Victor Michel, who succeeded in negotiating a treaty with the Persians on 14 September 1708, in spite of the hostility of the English, Dutch, Portuguese and Armenians. If the French were mainly concerned to assert their presence in Persia, increase trade and protect Catholic Armenians, the Persians were anxious to find a more effective ally against the Muscat Arabs. As a French envoy was pointedly informed by the Persians, "Le Roy de Perse t'ordonne de proposer au Roy de France que n'etant pas content des services qui luy rendent plus les Anglais contre les Mascatins ses ennemis bien qu'ils soient bien payes pour cela... nous envoyer
equipes des vaisseaux et bombardes necessaires."5 There is some similarity with the Persian predicament a century earlier, when they were forced to rely upon the English company to assist them in dislodging

the Portuguese from Hurmuz. It was only in the reign of Nadir Shah that tentative moves to form a Persian navy began, though in any case they proved abortive. The Persians eventually followed up the Michel embassy with one of their own conducted by Muhammad Riza Beg, who arrived in France on 23 October 1714. It fascinated the Parisian populace but exasperated the court officials, and in spite of a lavish reception, including the last public appearance of Louis XIV, it had little practical result. For whatever the interest of the royal entourage, trade with Persia had little appeal to French merchants, who advised, "n'ecouter ladessus aucune proposition et de ne pas permettre de commerce de France aux mer
chands Persans... le commerce pourra faire tort au gens Marseillais".1 Taking a similar view to the English merchants trading to the Levant, the French merchants of Marseilles maintained their opposition for over a century. Their attitude was confirmed by the experience of the English and Dutch companies. The southern sea routes never supplanted the overland routes to Europe, for unless the trade was supplemented by Indian and other southern commodities it could not be balanced. The English company had its special privileges, the Dutch their spices, but the French merchants had no such inducements to enter a new trade which might jeopardise the old. For the majority of Armenians it held little interest in comparison with their trade through the Levant or later, from the end of the 17th century, through Russia. The importance of the Portuguese in the trade of Persia after their loss of Hurmuz was negligible. Albuquerque believed, "This city of Ormuz is according to my idea the most important of them all." The English merchants reckoned that it was because of spices that the Portuguese "have made that barren island of Ormoze to yield them more profit than any (if not many) their Eastern trade besides". Kung, near Bandar 'Abbas, the port granted to them by Imam Qull Khan provided them with a pale shadow of their former glory. It was used by Indian, Arab and Armenian merchants who wished to avoid Bandar 'Abbas, for little Portuguese trade passed through it. After the
fall of Muscat in 1649 t n e Portuguese had even less hold over local shipping, for they were unable to enforce the pass system effectively and as they lost more ground to the Dutch in the east generally,

TRADE
especially after the loss of Malacca, their trade further declined. Most of their effort was directed against the Arabs from Muscat, with whom they were engaged in almost incessant hostilities till the end of the 17th century.
(Hi) Local shipping and trading
It early became obvious to the English merchants that one of the principal obstacles to a large trade with Persia was that sales of English commodities alone would not balance purchases of Persian goods and in consequence large supplies of ready money would be needed to make up the difference. This was, however, a problem which dominated eastern trade in the 17th and early 18th centuries. English merchants in general and the East India Company in particular did not then have sufficient ready money available. As the first Agent realised, "The want then of ready moneys to be extracted our land, being the life of all (the whole difficulty thereon consisting)". So efforts were made to participate in the local trade either from the East Indies with spices or from India with textiles, metals, drugs, foodstuffs etc. which were traditional Persian imports from these areas. The expectation was that "Your ships from the Southward may furnish with spices, from Suratt, if but only we bring the Moor and Banyan merchants (of whom we may receive great freights), all India commodities may also be supplied." Almost a century later the absolute necessity of such trading was echoed in comments from French merchants who maintained that trade to Persia alone from France would not pay without complementary commerce with India. The Dutch company certainly appreciated the point, for they not only took the position of the Portuguese as the chief suppliers of spices, but were very active in the Indian textile trade with Persia, particularly from Coromandel. Nevertheless, the accusation that the English and Dutch were responsible for ruining trade in the Gulf or for eliminating local traders is unacceptable. In the two decades from 1612 to 1631 when the Portuguese were in conflict with the Persians, trade was already adversely affected and even from 1623 the joint Dutch and English convoys could only protect some of the merchants engaged in the trade for part of the time. With the granting of the port of Kung to the Portuguese in 1631 conditions became much more stable and the following decade saw a remarkable renewal of trade between.

Surat. Gujarat! shipping reasserted itself not only in the Red Sea but also in the Persian Gulf. Armenian interests expanded in India both on their own and with Dutch and English assistance. Khwaja Nazar, who was head of the Julfa Armenian community, requested the East India Company's assistance in 1620 for Armenian merchants travelling by sea to India and their accommodation in Siirat. By 1630 many Armenians were established at Bandar 'Abbas, with trading networks extending throughout India and into the East Indies. Khwaja Minas, originally from Isfahan, was operating from Surat on a large scale in the 1660s as principal buyer and creditor to the East India Company there and as the owner of much shipping. It was an Armenian who owned the Queddah Merchant, which was pillaged by pirates in 1690 and whose cargo was valued at £50,000. The Callendar family, with family connections in Isfahan, Siirat and London, was associated with the East India Company in 1688 in its ambitious project to export Persian silk and import English cloth through Surat and Bandar 'Abbas. A similar scheme was proposed to the French in 1682 by Armenian interests, so there was no lack of initiative displayed by Armenian traders both with their own shipping and in freighting English and Dutch ships. Indian participation in the trade to the Persian Gulf is also acknowledged. Much of the local trade was carried in the shallow-draught single-masted dhows of the time, which generally avoided the main ports of Bandar 'Abbas and Kung with their customs controls. This kind of clandestine trade continued in the Gulf up to the mid 20th century, so it is hardly surprising to find it existing in the 17th century. It is certainly true that there were a large number of Indian merchants, Banians, a rather loose term covering those coming principally from Gujarat, who established themselves in the ports of Persia and the larger cities, such as Shlraz, Kirman, Kashan, Isfahan, Tabriz and Ardabll. They had their own quarters in the bazaars. In Bandar 'Abbas they had frequent difficulties over their religious rites and beliefs. In addition to merchants, there were many Indian money-changers whose expertise in precious metals was widely acknowledged. Shah 'Abbas was very reluctant to agree to their presence, but under Shah SafI and his successor their numbers increased and their knowledge became indispensable in the money markets. Many different coins entered Persia - piastres, chequins, rials, rijks dollars, ducats, pagodas, to mention a few - and the fluctuations in the exchange rates between

themselves and in reference to the Persian silver coinage of 'abbasls and shahls and the unit of account, the tviman, were carefully observed. There was no doubt about the upsurge of trade between India and Persia in the third decade of the 17th century, after Surat had recovered from its famine and floods and peace was made with the Portuguese. The English Resident for India noted in 1637 that merchants "thrive and thronge yearely twixt Gombroone and Masulipatam". Earlier in 1633, according to the English Captain Weddell, merchants "rinding the sweetnes of the trade, beginne, for want of shipping, to come hither in their own vessells". Hostilities between Persia and India over Qandahar in the middle of the century, which intermittently closed the overland routes, resulted in an increased volume of goods being carried by sea, much of which never reverted to the land. Thus in 1640 the English factors reported that the quantity of goods entering Bandar 'Abbas had quadrupled and that "never to any man's remembrance were soe many merchants and goods present at any one time in Surat" for Persia. From the records it is clear that the range and variety of textiles being imported into Persia from India was growing and that throughout the century it remained a profitable investment for both European and local trader. The East India Company reckoned, probably conservatively, on goods from Agra, that "From Disboursement of your mony, to the time it is returned, into your Cash, charge of Transport, way charges in Rhadaree, servants wages employed with Caphillaes, Customes of Surat and Broach, fraight to Gombroon and transport to Spahan, there cannot be lesse reconed then 40 or 45 % one with another which being deducted, from the Spahan prizes there wilbe nonthelesse
a Competent profitt, peradventure 35% one with another."1 Indian merchants, purchasing more cheaply and with fewer overheads, would have traded even more profitably. Indeed, even in the spice trade, Indian merchants were not eclipsed by the Dutch, for they "carried on a traditional and considerable trade with Persia and Mocha". In the 1670s the names of 'Abd al-Ghaffur and Ahmed Chelebl occur as shippers to Bandar 'Abbas amongst other places, and they were not alone. The increasingly aggressive activities of the Muscat Arabs towards the end of the century affected the security of shipping in the Gulf and more local trade began to be carried on European ships, either official

This private trading is difficult to quantify, but the indications are that it was considerable and profitable. The majority of local shipping came from Indian ports, much of it from Surat, where it was subject to control by the Mughal authorities. Thus during the hostilities over Qandahar in 1648 an embargo was placed upon shipping going to Persia. Occasionally Indian shipping expected special privileges to be arranged for it in Persia by the English merchants, such as those accorded to Mir Jumla for his ships from Golkonda which entered customs-free. Frequently goods would be trans-shipped in ports from distant places and in this way goods from China were received, particularly china ware, which was much esteemed in Persia throughout the Safavid era. Sometimes shipping came from the East Indies, such as a vessel from Bantam in 1687, captained by an Englishman, Anderson, bringing spices. There was a brief exchange of trade with Siam in the 1660s. Furthermore, there was much local trade around the Arabian peninsula and along the Gulf to Basra. There were many small fishing and trading communities dotted about the coastline which contributed in some measure to the trade of the area.
(c) Overland trade
(/') Turkey
It has been said that "the silk trade between Persia and Turkey was a dominant element in the economies of both countries. The Ottoman silk industry was dependent upon Persian silk; moreover the trade brought an average of 70,000 alton a year into the treasury. In Persia, the currency in circulation was kept supplied by gold and silver earned
on the Ottoman markets."1 This was true of the 16th century, and it remained true of the 17th century, irrespective of the upheavals in the political and commercial relations between the two countries which virtually came to an end for almost a century with the Peace of Zuhab in May 1639. The greatest part of Persian silk exports passed through Turkey, where it was either manufactured into textiles at Bursa or exported from Aleppo or Smyrna to London, Marseilles and, to a

lesser extent, Venice and Leghorn. In Aleppo, Bursa, Smyrna and Istanbul the silk was traded principally for cloth or money, but other goods such as glass, arms, watches and objects of fashion were bought for import to Persia. It was well organised from the chain of trade silkgrowing provinces to the Turkish market places. It suffered from the arbitrary behaviour of Turkish officials towards the Armenians at the beginning of the 18th century. The Armenians were the main intermediaries in this trade and were also well represented in other commercial and social affairs in Turkey.
(«) Russia
There was a development of Persian trade to Russia towards the end of the Safavid era. Throughout the 17th century embassies had been exchanged between Persia and Russia. Shah 'Abbas received three, in 1618, 1623 and 1626. Some trade accompanied the embassies, for in 1648 a departing Persian ambassador for Russia "made Silke soe deare, hee carringe great quantities with him". The embassies, at least on the Russian side, were often elaborate, for in 1654 the Russian ambassador, Lobanov-Rostovsky, "went in greate pomp and state; he haveing Drums, Trumpetts and Flaggs carryed before him; accompanied with 250 or 300 Russians and had as many Camels for carryage of his present
and Luggage".1 A decade later a Russian ambassador "had a retinue of neerest 600 men of whom 400 sayd to be Merchants, att his entring the Citty rode 16 trumpets before him, 8 drums and 13 large Freezeland horses were led in state; its reported never the like beasts came into these parts before, being intended as presents for the King, with 2 Coaches extraordinary well made, with watches and clocks and abun
dance of other toyes, likewise bares and Doggs of all sorts".2 There were also falcons and sables, which always made highly esteemed presents for the shahs. If there was not always real respect displayed on such visits, nevertheless the Persians recognised their value, for: "Le Moscovite est notre voisin, et notre ami et le commerce est establi entre
nous d'anciennete et sans interruption."3 If there was an element of exaggeration in this statement, there was more than a grain of truth, for by 1670 there were those suggesting to the Dutch traveller Jean Struys, "qu'il leur feroit bien plus facile de

faire descendre leurs marchandises par la Wolga a Arcanguel, et de la en Hollande, que de les envoyer par terre a Smirne, ou ils ne pouvaient les faire tenir sans les exposer a de grands perils, outre que les frais de
cette voiture etoient immenses".1 At this time from the middle of the century onwards, apart from the intermittently troubled period of the Cossack insurrections under Stenka Razin between 1664 and 1671, Armenian trade to Russia was increasing under Russian encouragement. It was the Armenians who were the principal intermediaries in this trade. The importance of Astrakhan as an international entrepot has been mentioned earlier, as have been the earlier efforts in the mid 16th century by Anthony Jenkinson to open up trade between Europe and Persia by the Volga. It was not surprising that Delia Valle drew attention to the advantages of this land route over that by sea as advocated by a Russian embassy in 1622: "if the Muscovites have this in mind and are negotiating to facilitate it, having a sufficiency of money, at least to begin with, I believe it to be perfectly feasible for the English that they themselves can trade in Moscow by this route without such great
risk of war."2 The Armenians were singularly well placed to take an interest in the Persian—Russian trade, not only because of their local connections in the regions bordering the two countries, but because they had been involved to a greater or lesser extent in commercial affairs in Moscow since the end of the 15 th century. Their activities increased as a result of the forward policy of Ivan IV, whose defeat of the Kazan khanate was a prelude to closer relations with the trading centres of Central Asia. Russian internal difficulties then checked this progress, but trade between Persia and Russia again developed depending on the security of the routes along the Caspian hinterland and the Volga. Contemporary accounts do not underestimate the dangers of travel in those regions. Although Armenian merchants settled in the bazaars in Astrakhan during the reign of Shah 'Abbas I, it seems that the Russian encouragement of them becomes more evident in the second half of the century. After having conquered the Ukraine, contained the threat from Turkey

and concluded an alliance with Poland, Russia felt able to turn her attention eastwards again. In 1660 Khwaja Zakar and nine companions from Isfahan were received by Tsar Alexis Mikhallovich. In February 1666 another group of 40 Armenians arrived in Moscow, and after long negotiations a treaty of commerce was signed on 31 May 1667 with the Russian officials, Yury Dolgoruky and Ordin-Nastchokin. It gave the Armenians a concession to transport the goods of Asia to Europe by way of Astrakhan and Archangel on payment of customs of 5 % ad valorem. The principal goods exchanged consisted of cloth, hides, furs, falcons and silk. By the early 1690s the English factors in Persia were complaining about the competing supplies of cloth coming from Russia, but the strongest stimulus to Russian—Persian trade and relations in general followed the return of Peter the Great to Russia in 1698. He was determined to create a more powerful modernised Russia. Although for much of the time preoccupied by wars with Sweden, Poland and Turkey, Peter the Great successfully cultivated ethnic, religious and political links with Georgia and Armenia. In the troubled and weakened state of the northern Persian provinces, he particularly encouraged a closer trading association between the Russians and Armenians, which gradually grew as relations between the Armenians and Turks deteriorated. A Russian consul was established at Shamakhl and embassies sent in 1701 and 1708. In 1718 Artemil Petrovich Volynsky negotiated a satisfactory treaty, including regulations and privileges regarding trade which permitted Russian merchants freedom of movement in Persia and unlimited purchases of silk. The impetus to trade given by Peter the Great survived his ill-fated campaign in 1722, for not only were Persian-Russian trading connections strengthened but the Dutch and English companies traded through Russia with Persia even after the demise of the Safavids till the mid 18th century. It had become obvious, as Jonah Hanway remarked, "that of all the nations who have endeavoured to establish a trade with the people of Persia, the Russians are most advantageously situated".
(Hi) Central Asia and India
Mashhad was the main centre of Persian trade towards Central Asia in the later Safavid period, a gathering place for horses and the wool from the sheep and goats of the mountain pastures. Rhubarb and lapis lazuli were traded with Balkh and Bukhara, which occasionally sent

THE LATER SAFAVID PERIOD
ambassadors to the shah's court. Here pottery, carpets and leather goods were made. Further east Herat and Farah were strategic and commercial outposts but the nodal point of the overland trade between India and Persia was Qandahar, whose possession for half a century was disputed between the two countries. Two English merchants passing through Qandahar in 1615 noticed that "By reason of frequent passage of Caravans it is much enlarged lately, that the Suburbs are bigger then the Citie. For within this two yeare, that the way of Ormus is stopped up by the wars betwixt the Persians and Portugals, all Caravans which passe betwixt India and Persia, must of necessitie goe by this place. And here they doe hire Camels to go into India, and at their returneforPersia... Trade it yeelds not of it selfe, but accidentally by the meeting of Indian, Persian and Turkie Merchants, which are not
willing to travel further at twentie per Cento profit."1 These two merchants were accompanied into Persia by three Armenian and twelve Persian merchants. In 1628 Herbert noted the arrival in Qazvln of a 40-camel caravan from India carrying tobacco. There had always been a close connection between Khurasan and India, particularly Golkonda and the Deccan. Shortly after Shah 'Abbas II had finally recaptured Qandahar an English traveller commented that "Qandahar brings vast Customes to the King of Pertia for theres noe way into the Northern parts of it from Multan and other
India parts by land except it come by way of Sindy."2 A few years later it was reported from Persia that, "By way of Candahar is arrived lately at Spahan near 1,000 camel loads of cloth and indico which hath caused said commodity to fall in price 15%." This was additional to the seaborne trade, of which it was written at about the same time that "Greater quantities of goods than usual arrived this year from India to Gombroon." So whatever the attractions of the sea route some caravans continued to travel throughout the 17th century between India and Persia and were only interrupted intermittently by the warfare around Qandahar. As a result of the raids of the Baluchls and the disturbances with the Afghans at the beginning of the 12th/18th century, the roads then became less secure and the volume of goods carried decreased. An English merchant in Mashhad in 1697 remarked that it was difficult to sell cloth because the ways were blocked.

TRADE
id) The routes
In general the pattern of the routes did not change significantly in Safavid times. The means of transportation remained the camel, the horse and the mule, and the caravans depended upon local pasturage, food and, most crucial of all, water. Wheeled traffic was negligible. Political troubles might deflect the routes temporarily. Trade might, where practical, be moved by sea rather than land, but in the main, geographical conditions determined the choice of routes. In the same way the seasonal changes of the monsoons affected sailings. Ships came up from Indian ports to the Gulf generally from November to May at the latest, but from June to October there were only small local movements of shipping. A voyage from Surat to Bandar 'Abbas would take between three and six weeks, usually about a month, in a European vessel, such as a 300-ton carrack. The smaller Siirat-built pinnaces of 100 tons would take about the same time, as well as the Arab-built dhows which crossed the Indian Ocean to East Africa or went round the Indian coast or across to the East Indies. Once the merchandise had arrived at Bandar 'Abbas it was in one direction despatched either north-east through Jlruft, Bam, Kirman, Yazd and Ardakan, where it joined up with the eastbound route which went to India across the Dasht-i Kavlr to Tabas, Blrjand, Farah and Qandahar or more easterly from Bam through Slstan and the Hilmand valley to Qandahar, but this became more dangerous because of the Baluchis. From Qandahar further routes went either north into Central Asia through Ghazna and Kabul or east into Multan and Lahore. The other way was north to Isfahan through Lar, Jahrum, Khafr, Shlraz, Zarqan, Mayln, Ojan, Asupas, Dihgirdu, Yazdikhwast and Qumisha. Alternative routes were from Bandar 'Abbas to Shlraz through Darab and Fasa and from Shlraz to Isfahan through Slvand, Dihbld and Abada before rejoining the main route at Yazdikhwast. Another route went north from Kung through Kuhkird, Bastak and Nimar, where it joined the main route at Lar. From the lesser ports at Bandar Rig and Bandar Rlshahr routes converged near Burazjan and the road to Shlraz passed through DalakI, Kazarun and the Dasht-i Arjan. These routes were subject to extraordinary variations in climatic conditions, scorching heat when only travelling at night was bearable and perishing cold when travel might be impossible. An English factor, Robert Loftus, noted in April 1628: "I stayed in Digerdoo [Dihgirdu] six daies until

THE LATER SAFAVID PERIOD
the Carravans had broken the waies, which otherwise I coulde not pass by reason of the extremitie of the snowe"; but his courier died on the way. There were many hazardous parts where the direction was confusing or the ground treacherous. John Fryer found the travelling hard in 1676 when "in the day, besides the Heat and Sands, the Winds brought with them another plague the Locusts... The Mountains gape, the Rocks cleft in Sunder, the Waters stagnate... Water...Thick,
Troubled and Slimy", in all "a sensible Map of Purgatory".1 Though accommodation in the main towns was satisfactory, Fryer experienced that it was not always so in the caravansarais along the way. Throughout the 17th century the roads were reasonably secure and patrolled by rahdars who were responsible for guaranteeing the safety of the travellers and the protection of their merchandise. It was also a period of considerable building activity, with officials and merchants putting up caravansarais, bridges, water tanks, baths, and bazaars. In addition to the routes to India and Central Asia already mentioned through Farah and Qandahar, another left Farah through Herat to Mashhad. Coming into Mashhad were the routes from Balkh, Samarqand, Bukhara and Khiva going through Marv. From Mashhad part of the old silk route was followed through Nlshapur, Sabzavar, Damghan, Simnan, Tehran, which was insignificant compared to the ancient town of Ray, and Sava. There the routes divided. One went south through Qum and Kashan, where it branched either in the direction of Isfahan and so south through Shiraz to the coast or more south-easterly through Na'In, Ardakan and Yazd to Kirman and Bam, where it either forked south to the coast or east towards India. Another turned west through Hamadan, where it divided, the northerly route going in the direction of Sanandaj, Mosul, Mardin and Urfa to Aleppo, the more westerly one going to Baghdad, where it divided once more, either north to Mosul along the Tigris or along the Euphrates through the desert to Aleppo. The third main route from Sava passed north-westerly to Qazvln, where it either went towards the Caspian to Rasht, Ardabll and north to Shamakhl and Darband or went to Tabriz through Sultaniyya and Miyana. Tabriz was an important industrial centre, a vital link with connections in all directions. One route went to Erivan, with a road going north to Tiflis and so to Georgia and Armenia, and then on to Turkey where

the first important town was Erzerum. From there routes went to the coast at Trebizond and through Anatolia to Istanbul or Bursa or to the Aegean at Smyrna. Another route from Tabriz which went to Aleppo passed through Khuy, Bitlls, Diyarbakr and Urfa, where it joined the route to Aleppo.
(e) The trade
{i) Persian exports
It was silk which was "the chiefest naturall commodity in and about this place" and which constituted Persia's principal export. As mentioned before, it was produced principally in the northern provinces of Georgia, Mazandaran and Gllan and to a much lesser extent in Khurasan and around Yazd. Production had declined in the last quarter of the ioth/i6th century as a result of the Persian—Turkish wars, but Shah 'Abbas I made determined efforts to expand production. Statistics and terminology concerning the silk industry are unreliable, so that it is only possible to generalise on some of the main features. An estimate was given that in 1618 some 232,000 mans or 125 tons were being produced. Olearius, two decades later, suggested that production was 8,000 bales of 213 lbs. in Gllan, 3,000 bales in Shirvan, 3,000 bales in Khurasan and 2,000 bales each in Mazandaran and Qarabagh: about 192 tons, of which a twentieth perhaps was used in Persia. By Chardin's time production had increased, according to his computation, to some 270 tons, made up of 10,000 bales of 276 lbs. from Gllan, from Mazandaran 2,000, from "Media and Bactria" 3,000 apiece, and 2,000 each from Qarabagh and Georgia, totalling 22,000 bales. Struys, who is less reliable, put the total at 30,000 bales. By the end of the Safavid period in 1740 there was a 40% decline from peak production estimated at around 160 tons by Hanway. By this time Persian silk was meeting increased competition not only in the markets of Europe from Indian and Italian silk of middling and excellent quality, but in the Turkish market from Syrian and Greek silk. In general the silk from Gllan was most favoured, two main grades of which were imported to Europe: firstly, sharbassee, which was the best quality and according to Chardin "la meilleure soye pour les riches etoffes", and was also called legee, though the terms were not always synonymous; and secondly, ardasset, described by Chardin as "grosse,

THE LATER SAFAVID PERIOD
epaise et hide", which was coarser and cheaper and mostly came from Shirvan. Other grades in lessening quality were called Khadkudapasand, Carvari and Canari. Supply was influenced not only by political considerations but by climate and disease. Shah SafI excused himself for the non-compliance of a contract in 1631 by referring to the disease ravaging the silkworms and the bad state of the mulberry trees. In 1721 the English Agent, Owen Philips, alluded to the increased cost of silk caused "by reason of great Loss of Silke and Wormes this year in an Earthquake". The European companies at first dealt almost entirely with the Court, and the tedious negotiations with the officials involved douceurs to those involved as well as presents on other occasions, such as the accession of the monarch, new appointments and at the festivities of Nauruz. Fluctuations in demand naturally influenced prices, and the Dutch complained that the arrival of the Holstein embassy increased the price of silk, though they contributed to this by extensive purchases to thwart them. Price increases were occasionally caused by the departure of an embassy carrying silk away. The English factors at first hoped to obtain a load of silk, 36 mans, for 40 tumans, about 6s. 3d a lb., but found their first consignment costing 50 tumans, about 7s. 6d a lb. It was generally marginally cheaper for ready money than in part exchange for other commodities and money. In general the price to the European companies fluctuated between 45 and 48 tumans a load, according to circumstances and quality. Exceptionally, in 1721 the English Agent reported Gllan legee costing about 75 tumans a load. The cost of transporting a load in 1617 from Isfahan to Bandar 'Abbas, some 5 50 miles, by camel in 45 days, ass in 40 days or mule in 30 days might cost 38 shahis in animal hire and 3^ shahis for tolls. Packing, baling, wrapping and weighing in Isfahan, including materials, cost in 1639 25 shahis the load. Other costs included lighterage and porterage at port and freight charges, which to England were £20 a ton, about 75 shahis a load. Thus in 1640 silk costing 7s. 6d a lb inclusive was being sold in London for 17s. The prices and costs, however, fluctuated greatly, for in 1708 the East India Company was complaining to its Persian factors that the silk invoiced to them at 8s. 4d. was sold for 12s. 2d. on average, "so that considering freight, Custom, and Discount we have not our money again by a great deal
besides all our Charges and Interest and Insurance lost".1 The Dutch

too became less enthusiastic over Persian silk, for it was often short in weight and dirty. At Aleppo costs were complicated by the interaction of cloth and silk prices and supplies, so that silk might be bought for 14 dollars a rotello in cash but 17^ dollars against a particular kind of
cloth at a certain price depending on demand1. An appreciation of the interdependence of the silk and cloth trades in the Levant markets is of fundamental importance. In the early 18th century London prices for silk fluctuated between 20s. and 30s. a lb. in response to increased demand as a result of European hostilities which affected the security of shipping in the Mediterranean. Such silk was being bought for between 12s. and 14s. at Aleppo. Other exports of Persia were of much less importance in comparison with silk. Kirman wool, a fine quality from the goats found in that province, and a little from Mashhad, were exported by the European companies and also went through the Levant. Tavernier gives an amusing account of his experiences with an early consignment in 1654. The East India Company first requested it from its Persian factors in
1659 an<^ within a decade they were requesting 10—12,000 mans yearly. During the 1670s about 150 bales were being exported yearly, "clean good, not to exceed 6d. or 8d. a lb. clear abroad, not black", for red was the preferred colour. The price obtained in London in the years 1669—77 ranged from 2s. 3d. to 6s. 3d. In 1693 392 bales were shipped, in 1697 254, and in 1698 338, with prices ranging between 5s. 7d. for the best and 3s. jd. and 2s. 9d. for second grade. On the eve of the Afghan invasion the English factors had obtained 18,000 mans. The Dutch too exported considerable quantities of this wool, which was principally used in the making of hats and buttons. Of considerable interest is the fact that the production of this wool stimulated a local weaving industry which emerged in the 1670s, causing less supplies for the European companies. By the mid 1680s there was no doubt that the main reason for these restrictions was "the yearly increase of weavers
who get their living by weaving that Commodity" in Kirman.2 Textiles and carpets were important products of the industry of Persia, but whilst they now enjoy a remarkable reputation, this was not necessarily so in the 17th century, for artistic fashion changes. For example, in the 17th century travellers were unimpressed by Persian

painting, and manuscripts were obtained not for their aesthetic qualities but for their religious or historical interest. The pearling industry off Bahrain, which was nominally under Persian jurisdiction, was practically under the control of the strongest local sea power, which meant firstly the Portuguese and then the Muscat Arabs during the 17th century. The export of pearls, important though it was, brought little revenue directly to the Persian treasury. The best pearls were "to be round of good colour and clear, not yellow". An interesting development in the early 18th century was the idea of using a submarine to fish for the pearls. The East India Company was approached in the early 18th century in London "for making use of an Engine lately invented by which persons can continue underwater twenty fathoms deep for several hours. It is supposed great advantage might be made in the Pearl Fishery near Ormus." Bilin de Cansevilles, the French merchant and traveller, at the turn of the century had a similar idea, believing that a submersible machine used off Marseilles for recovering treasure from wrecks would be suitable for fishing "une grande quantite de perles orientales pendant toute la journee sans intermission". Pearls were much used in the decoration of richly embroidered textiles as can be seen in contemporary Persian or European portraits. Red oxide and salt were exported steadily from Hurmuz. Rhubarb, which came from Central Asia to Qazvln, was mostly exported to Aleppo, but occasional consignments were shipped from Bandar 'Abbas. Drugs, gums and medicaments such as lapis tuttia, oppoponax, salarmoniac, worm seeds, ammoniacum, galbanum, olibanum and assafoetida were exported in all directions and though the total volume was small the returns were considerable. An indication of this may be inferred from Lockyer's account of prices at Bandar 'Abbas in 1705, when lapis tuttia cost 7 shahls a Tabriz man of 6J lbs, galbanum 16 shahls and ammoniacum 6^ shahls, whilst prices in London were reckoned in 1661 to be £5 —£6, £io—£\z and in 1686 £3. 10s respectively. Dyestuffs included runas (madder), a red root from the Ardabll area, which was especially in demand in India, and galls, a bitter excrescence forming on oak trees from the Hamadan and Kurdistan regions, which went mostly to the Levant. Persian wine, especially that of Shiraz, in spite of intermittent prohibitions, was highly esteemed in court circles and among the foreigners residing in the country. Tavernier in 1666 estimated the production of
481



TRADE
Shlraz wine at 154,688 imperial gallons, 4,125 barrels of 300 pints each (200,025 mans), of which a quarter was exported to India and another quarter consumed exclusively by the court. There were vineyards in many parts of the country where the climate was favourable, including Azarbaljan around Lake Riza'iyya, Qazvln, Khurasan, particularly about Nlshapur, districts in Georgia and Armenia, as well as Isfahan, Yazd and Shlraz. Shlraz, according to Tavernier, "is particularly
famous for the most excellent wines of all Persia".1 The grapes were fermented in large terra cotta containers before being bottled and transported wrapped with straw in cases. Jews, Armenians and Zoroastrians were those engaged in the trade. The wine of Shlraz was highly esteemed by Europeans, who probably stimulated increased production from the beginning of the 17th century and who were granted special concessions to make their own, which was usually managed for them by Armenians. Tavernier reckoned that in 1666 50,000 mans were produced there for the Europeans and the rest by Jews, 100,000 mans of which much was exported to India. India also took rosewater, orange-flower essence and much fruit. In 1705 Lockyer stated that Shlraz rosewater cost 120 shahls and Shlraz wine cost 140 shahls a chest of 10 gallons, but in 1685 it was priced at 100 shahls with local brandy at 20 shahls a gallon.
(it) Persian imports
The main imports were textiles either for internal consumption or for re-export to neighbouring countries. The principal kinds were firstly woollen cloths from Europe, particularly from England and to a lesser extent from Venice, France and Holland, which entered Persia mostly from the Levant, although the English East India Company especially made strenuous efforts at various times to expand its cloth sales through Bandar 'Abbas. Secondly, there was a wonderful variety of Indian cotton cloths which were brought in by local traders, the Dutch company and to a lesser extent the English Company. Most of the European cloth imported was English broadcloth, thick, well-woven and heavy, generally of the ordinary variety costing between 3s. 6d. and 5 s. a yard dyed and called "Londra", which was the term given to it by Italian merchants towards the end of the 16th century when it was first appearing in the Levant. Though there were considerable varia

tions in quality, weaving, dressing, pressing and dyeing, in general the cloths were some 40 yards long, slightly lengthening towards the end of the century, and between 4 ft. 6 ins. and 6 ft. in breadth and usually sold in bales of five cloths. The Persians preferred bright gay colours and bought them at 30—36 shahis (10s.—12s.) a yard. Some sales were made of kersies, a coarse narrow cloth, some 27 ins. wide, woven from long wool. The newer style of cloths, lighter in texture, known as bays, and perpetuanos, the "new draperies", as they were termed in Europe, coming into fashion early in the 17th century, did not make much headway in the Persian markets. Middling and high quality cloths in rich colours such as scarlet, crimson or deep wine had limited sales and were often used for presents. The Indian cotton cloths came mostly from Sind, Coromandel, Surat, which handled the production from Agra, Broach, Ahmadabad and other north-west Indian textile centres, Bengal and Kutch. The large number of Persians in India facilitated this trade and influenced its methods and patterns. The volume was great; perhaps a third of Indian textile production went to the Red Sea and Persia and onwards to Arabia, the Levant, Turkey, Russia and Central Asia. Fryer noticed the predominance of the textile and spice imports to Persia. The Dutch involvement in the textile imports is well attested by Professor Raychaudhuri, who states that, "starting as a mere accessory to the spice trade in the Indies the Dutch trade with Coromandel developed before long into one of the chief pillars of the Company's
Eastern commerce", and nowhere more so than to Persia.1 The Dutch continued to the end of the Safavid period to import textiles and spices. Four Dutch ships arriving at Bandar 'Abbas in 1721 brought sugar, pepper, sappon wood, lack, cardamons, sugar candy, tin, cinnamon, cloves, nutmegs and a variety of textiles ranging in price from 8 to 13 8 shahls a piece, with the most numerous single kind being Cossas, of which there were 2,280 costing 56 shahls each. In 1721 spices imported by the Dutch, who were not the exclusive but the largest traders in them, were valued in the Bandar 'Abbas customs house registers as follows: cardamons 70 shahls per Tabrl2 man, cinnamon 85 shahls 7 qazbaks, nutmegs 97 shahls, preserved nutmegs 200 shahls, pepper 11 shahls, cloves 142 shahls 8 qazbaks, preserved cloves 250 shahis, benjamin 18 shahls and more 40 shahls per

Apart from these staple items, tin and iron were required and a wide variety of luxuries such as furs, jewels, watches, glassware, cutlery, amber for beads, coral, porcelain, ivory, falcons, exotic animals and fashionable bric-a-brac. Guns were always highly acceptable as presents in court circles and among officials, but there was no largescale importation from European sources.
6. ORGANISATION OF TRADE
Shah 'Abbas had trade organised as a state monopoly, almost on a personal basis. The reasons for this lay partly in his determination to centralise his administration, partly in the effects of the Turkish wars prior to his accession and partly as a consequence of the Portuguese hold over trade in the south, and not least because it was financially advantageous to him. Moreover, Persian merchants were short of capital to sustain trade on a large scale, as the English had noticed on their first arrival. As silk sales were a priority, Shah 'Abbas encouraged the Armenian community he had settled in Isfahan. The shah, however, retained under his own control international trade, which was administered in accordance with his instructions by one of his ministers, Lala Beg or Mulla'Im Beg in the last fifteen years of his reign.
Under Shah SafI the royal monopoly was greatly relaxed and under subsequent monarchs practically abandoned. The operations of the mints, which under Shah 'Abbas were strictly supervised, became less effective and much of the foreign coinage entering the country was never taken to them. As a result of this and court hoarding, the amount of coinage in circulation failed to keep pace with financial requirements as the volume of business increased. Such a state of affairs had not yet become obvious by 1631, for remark was made of "Silver and Gould which is transported yearely from hence into India in great
quantities by merchaunts of these parts",1 but it had become a serious problem thirty years later. Raphael du Mans noted that "la richesse de la Perse n'est done que comme Phumidite de l'eau qui s'attache aux

sin... il reste quelque peu de chose sur le pais".1 Twenty years later still a critical situation had arisen with money in very short supply and the currency debased. "The unhappy Order of not suffering Gold nor Silver to be exported" was decreed and officers commissioned to enforce it, for "the Deputy who is now in towne [Bandar 'Abbas] hath given abunndance of trouble, threatning to open all chests and bales to seek for money, but the merchants at last made a general complaint and got leave for shipping their goods after he had
searched all with running an Iron into both bales and chests".2 This had some effect in the short term, but with the connivance of port officials and other more devious methods it was not long before the flow to India was continued, by which, according to Tavernier earlier, "those who understand the traffic well and carry hence gold or silver to the territories of the Great Mughal, always get 7% or 8%, provided
they take care to shun the customs-house".3 As for the debasement in 1684, it was reported that "the money of Spahanne is soe very bad there is neither buying nor selling, and in fifty abassis there is not five Silver, soe that the Bazars are all shutt up, and noe trading at all, nor will be any until the King hath ordered this money to be cryed downe, and other good money made in the room of it, the which these people are now by the King's order every day at worke upon, but wee fear it will take some time (by reason of the Scarcity of good Silver) before they can gett quoined soe much as will
serve soe great citty as Spahaune".4 The problem continued to bedevil the Persian economy and was as much the result of the lack of administrative control in enforcing unpopular measures as economic. Practically all the silk was exported to the Levant, with little apart from European demand to balance the trade to the south and east, so that the imbalance was compensated by the export of precious metals. There was not such a shortage of these, for Venetian chequins came from the Levant, Hungarian ducats and rijks dollars from Russia. The Spanish real was still current. Much coinage, however, never reached the mints and so was not taxed, but exported directly. The Armenians as a group seemed alone in possessing some kind of social as well as commercial cohesion, even a common school of busi

ness practice, but it must not be assumed that all Armenians everywhere had the same interests, for though some might mutually collaborate closely others were in violent opposition to each other. This became more obvious towards the end of the 17th century, when religious persecution, discrimination and competing commercial conditions began to disrupt their communal solidarity in Isfahan. There was similarly visible a clear reaction arising from the political, economic, social and religious factors throughout the Persia of Shah Sultan Husain. This eventually resulted in its collapse and capitulation to the Afghans of Mahmud, described by a French observer as being "a body of eight thousand shepherds half unarmed". Banians and Jews too began to suffer more intervention in their affairs towards the latter end of the century, but in general Safavid Persia was more tolerant of its minorities than Mughal India and interfered with them less. The bulk of direct European trade with Persia was conducted by the English and Dutch companies. This was regulated by treaties and decrees. Although a royal farman authorising Christian merchants to trade in Persia with protection, privileges and exemption from tolls and customs was granted by Shah 'Abbas I to Sherley in 1599, the significant date is 1615, when Richard Steele and John Crowther obtained a farman permitting the English East India Company to commence trade in Persia with the cooperation of the local officials. The first and second Agents, Edward Connock and Thomas Barker, proposed separate drafts, which if not formally accepted were used as the basis for normal relations until a formal agreement was accepted and issued by Shah SafI in 1629. This lasted in force and in 1697 was confirmed and slightly expanded by Shah Sultan Husain from eighteen to twenty articles. Similar arrangements were entered into by the Dutch with Persians in 1623 and a treaty signed on 29 December 1624. This was subsequently confirmed in 1631, 1642 and 1694. These treaties established the framework in which the European companies operated in general, but secondly there were further raqams required to cover more specific aspects which arose in the course of trading and which needed royal confirmation. These included freedom from rahdari (the road taxes), polite usage from local officials, permission to export an agreed number of horses annually, security of residence, freedom to make wine, provision of guards for caravans, supplies of water, permission to purchase Kirman wool, restitution of
486

goods or money unlawfully taken, and others. In 1697 nineteen such raqams were confirmed by Shah Sultan Husain for the English company. A third kind of official authorisation was that concerned with royal contracts such as those entered into between Shah 'Abbas I and Agent Burt or between Shah Safl and Agents Burt, Heynes, Gibson and Merry for the English company between 1628 and 1640. These might concern the terms and conditions of the sale of Persian silk for English commodities such as cloth or tin or part exchange with money, or they might consist of instructions to certain officials or merchants to furnish a given amount of silk to the English company. The Dutch also required such raqams for their affairs, the granting of which often depended on the relationship between the personnel of the companies and the royal officials, the situation at court and the giving of presents. In many ways the official most closely involved with the European companies was the sbdhbandar, the port officer. There was a similar functionary for the Mughal emperor at Surat. He had the overall jurisdiction of the port, he collected the customs and controlled the customs-house, he regulated the movement of shipping, he authorised the landing and despatch of goods, he provided the lightering facilities which were essential at Bandar 'Abbas, and his goodwill was essential for the merchants. In the time of Shah 'Abbas I it appears that this appointment was in the gift of Imam Qull Khan, the powerful governor of Fars, but on his murder by Shah SafI the appointment became a royal prerogative. The details are not certain: at first it seems to have been a salaried position, but in the latter part of the 1 ith/i7th century it was a "farmed" post, at 24,000 tumans for Bandar 'Abbas. By the middle of the reign of Shah 'Abbas I the facilities for merchants had improved. In the large cities the bazaars were functioning as the centre of trading. Each sector of the bazaar had its own particular kind of trade organised with its own guild administration for servicing the requirements of traders for wholesale and retail purposes, provision of porterage, transportation and stabling, the control of pricing and arbitration over commercial disputes. Food retailing was, however, organised differently and was distributed throughout the bazaar. The importance of the total bazaar complex and its relationship to the city is most clearly seen in Isfahan, where Shah 'Abbas included it among his religious, administrative and economic institutions centering on the great maidan. It is obvious too in a later example at

Shlraz, where Karlm Khan Zand attached very much importance to his Bazar Vakil. Whilst the Armenians gradually dominated the silk and heavy cloth trades, GujaratI merchants were prominent in the Indian trades of spices and light cloths and largely controlled the money exchanges. The European merchants were largely dependent on their local brokers, whose connections with the traders of the bazaar and the officials of the court were indispensable. The English and Dutch companies had their own quarters in Isfahan, but did little direct trading themselves after the reigns of Shah 'Abbas I and Shah Safi. Along the trade routes a determined effort was made to supply sufficient caravansarais for the use of merchants on their journeys.
7. CUSTOMS AND REVENUE
The whole question of the Persian customs at the port of Bandar 'Abbas, which for most of the period handled by far the largest volume of seaborne trade to Persia, is confused in the absence of any reliable statistics, which is not surprising, given the nature and the methods of Safavid bureaucracy and the practices of merchants. Some tentative indications, based primarily on English sources, however, may be proposed with reservations. It was assumed in 1624 that the Portuguese obtained 180,000 rials (some £45,000 at 5s. per rial or some 14,616 tumans at £3. 6s. 8d a tuman) yearly on customs set at 14% nominally at Hurmuz. The English company was entitled to half the customs taken at Bandar 'Abbas in recognition of the services it had provided for the Persians at the capture of Hurmuz. It was admitted that it received at the most only a tenth or even a fifteenth of what was due and in some years less than that or none at all, particularly towards the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. The following amounts were received by the English East India Company for their share of customs in representative years: 1624225 tiimans, 1631 550, 1633242, 1634 341, 1637345, 1640700, 1643 612, 1644 6i6|, 1648 635, 1649 200, 1650 61 z\, 1651 750, 1652 785, 1653 7OO> 1654 500, 1655 400, 1656 700, 1657 650, 1658 400, 1659 500, 1660450, 1661 650, 1664700, 1668700, 1669700, 1670900, 16721,000. Subsequently it remained, though was not always delivered, at the agreed nominal figure of 1,000 tumans. It is possible to hazard a possible cross-referencing of figures around 1670. If it is accepted that the English company only received a
488



ORGANISATION OF TRADE
fifteenth of what was due to it, then this means that it should have had 15,000 tumans and the shahbandar a like figure, or £50,000 each, giving a total of £100,000. Now it was calculated that the customs for 1669-70 trading period amounted to 29,000 tumans, some £96,666. In 1652 the Persian customs were reckoned to be £118,000. In 1682 in London it was believed that the English share of the customs was worth 12,000 tumans (£40,000) yearly in the period 1658-78. In 1661 Nicholas Buckeridge, the English Agent in Isfahan, overheard "the Vizeer of the Custome house acknowledge to his friends (supposing hee did not heare, or that hee did not understand him) that the King's Customes this year amounted to above 15 and 16 thousand Tomands ... [and] hath cheated the King and you, of more then would make it
up 20 Thousand Tomands".1 In 1674 customs were farmed out for 24,000 tumans. The duties were 10% of value. In 1656 and 1657 together some.£444,500 worth of goods was cleared through the customs at Surat for Persia. In attempting to extrapolate from these tentative figures the total value of trade, allowance has to be made for English and Dutch company trade, which was exempt from customs, though the private trade of the merchants was officially not so, but in fact was; the practice of offloading at secluded beaches; and the prevalence of "colouring", whereby local trade was brought in in the guise of company trade. An inspired guess for the total import trade of the southern ports might give a value of £700,000 in the middle of the 17th century, a little less from the Levant and somewhat less still from Russia, Central Asia and the overland trade from India: an overall total of £iim., of which a quarter might be re-exported. As for exports, the bulk of these were composed of silk exports. Chardin in the second half of the 17th century estimated the total production at about £5111. At between 45 and 50 tumans a load of 36 mans of i2^1bs per man, the value of silk production was between £ i i m . and £1,800,000. Perhaps a fifth of the total production was consumed in Persia, leaving a possible £1,750,000 for exports, though these figures varied greatly during the century according to the fluctuation of demand or supplies. Other exports in comparison were limited, and so in general it may be assumed that in the 17th century trade was balanced, but that after the collapse of the Safavids it deteriorated. In 1801 Sir John Malcolm reckoned that "the

annual amount of the imports and exports of Persia do not (if this statement is correct) much exceed two million and a half sterling... it is considered that at least one half of this only passes through the King
dom on its way to others".1 Thus the assumption that the value of the annual trade of Persia at the height of Safavid prosperity was £$m. is not unreasonable. In comparison, the imports and exports of the United Kingdom at this time were estimated at some

CHAPTER 9
SOCIAL AND INTERNAL ECONOMIC
AFFAIRS*
In discussing the economic situation of Iran from the 14th to the 18th century, it seems to us helpful to keep two essential sectors distinct from one another: on the one hand the economy of the open countryside (above all, agriculture, cattle-breeding, hunting, fishing and mining) and on the other hand the urban economy (commerce and industry). Let us turn initially to the sector of rural production, with agriculture and cattle-breeding as its predominant elements. This created to a great extent the basis for almost all the economic activities we shall encounter in the period we are to treat. Subsequently the development of the various forms and institutions of landholding will have to be examined. Thereafter we shall treat the urban sectors of the economy (home trade and industrial production), and we shall end with a description of the financial and taxation systems.
THE RURAL ECONOMY
In the framework of agrarian production we encounter above all two sharply demarcated social groups. While the settled peasants mostly devote themselves to agriculture, cattle-breeding is above all in the hands of nomads and semi-nomads. Let us first discuss some characteristic features of peasant production in our period. The damage done to Iran's agriculture by the Mongol invasion showed its effects for centuries, and it is questionable whether the country, down to the end of the Safavid period, ever regained the degree of prosperity that distinguished Iranian agriculture from the 4th/ioth to the 6th/12th century, though there were indeed regional exceptions. The reasons for this setback lay above all in the destruction of irrigation works, some of them centuries old, and in the deforestation and depopulation of the country: both of the latter were direct consequences of the Mongol invasion. Further devastation occurred in

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
the course of Tlmur's conquests. Nevertheless, there were phases of economic improvement around the middle of the 9th/15 th century and above all in the 1 ith/iyth century. The village was the basis of rural production. Authority over the villages was exercised by landowners, fief-holders or tenants; when the ruler himself was the landowner, that is to say on crown lands, or when he had administrative control in some other way, he was represented in relation to the peasants by fiscal officials. We shall discuss this matter further below. All peasants enjoyed equal rights as members of their village community; each of them, within his village, had a right to the use of a portion of land, to his own household, to the use of the communal pasture and the irrigation works of the village. The portion of land was usually calculated on the unit of a.juft (juft-igdv, "a yoke of oxen"); a juft was as much land as could be cultivated with a yoke of oxen, and it was an established principle that every peasant had the right to a juft. In this situation it was generally accepted that all the jufts of a village should be, as far as possible, of equal value with regard to the harvests they would yield. In some cases, in order to achieve this equal sharing among all the villagers, the jufts were reallocated after a period of several years. Another possible method of establishing equal shares for the individual peasants was the allocation of a fixed quantity of water; in this case a village functionary, the mirdb, saw to it that each peasant's portion of land was supplied with the necessary quantity of water from the irrigation system. The peasant himself was regarded as a tenant of his landlord. In every case the cultivated ground, often also the implements, the draught animals, the water, and of course the irrigation works that cost so much to construct, belonged to the landlord. The human labour was of course supplied by peasants. In conformity with the extent of these preconditions for agricultural production, the harvest of the village at any given time was divided up according to the terms of a "contract of lease" between landlord and tenant. If, for example, the landlord had provided the land, the draught animals, irrigation and seeds, and the peasants of the village concerned merely contributed their labour, then the latter had to be content with only one-fifth of the produce. This was the general rule for villages with straightforward field-tillage. With orchards, vineyards and vegetable plantations in the vicinity of towns, where irrigation was ensured
492



THE RURAL ECONOMY
by natural watercourses and not by expensive underground channels (qanat), a different percentage was customary: here the peasant retained from one-third to one-half of the produce. In every case the peasants the so-called ra'aya, i.e. "the protected" (by the landlord and his representatives), "the flock" - formed a class on their own. They had, since the Jalayirid era, been increasingly bound to the soil and were not allowed to leave the region of their village without official sanction, as illustrated by kfarmdn of Shah SafI issued in Rabl' I 1041/September October 1631, in which there is mention of the return of Slstanl peasants to their villages; they had fled to various parts of Khurasan during
an Uzbek raid.1 Even though it may have held good for previous centuries that the landlord functioned as mediator between peasantry and bureaucracy and was thereby also the peasants' protector, this was hardly the case after the time of the Tl-Khans: from the 8th/14th to the 12th/18th century we repeatedly encounter a tendency towards the development of a landowning class possessing far-reaching powers and authority. In general the peasants hardly ever came into contact with their landlords or their representatives; these lived almost entirely in towns, often far distant, so that the life of the villagers, especially of those living well away from the towns, was characterised by a high degree of isolation. The daily routine followed its course, year in, year out, entirely within the limits of the village community. Requisites for day-to-day use were made at home by the peasants themselves, or else the landlord provided such articles as implements of various kinds and eventually recovered their value by increasing his share of the produce. This fact is of fundamental importance, since it shows clearly that commerce was largely restricted to the urban sector of the economy and at best extended only to villages in the vicinity of towns. These villages supplied the towns with fresh fruit and vegetables. The relative prosperity of the peasants in such areas was by no means a characteristic of the inhabitants of the many remote villages. Their only contact with the outside world was when they met tax-collectors and the landlord's representatives, who had to bring in his share of the produce. It should also be said that these observations do not apply merely to the period under discussion here. This also holds good when we consider the most important agricul

tural products; as in earlier and later times, the main cereals were wheat and barley, the latter mainly as fodder. In the Caspian coastal areas ricegrowing held first place; it was also to be found to a limited extent in the Isfahan area. Sugar-cane had already been cultivated in Khuzistan since the time of the Sasanians. Fruit-growing was not exclusively confined to plantations in the vicinity of towns; however, it always required favourable means of irrigation. Essentially the same kinds of fruit were cultivated as in our own day. Cotton-growing and the rearing of silkworms were widespread, the latter mainly around Yazd, in Khurasan and in Gllan on the Caspian coast. Wine-production was not unusual and mostly found in the vicinity of the vineyards themselves. It is, of course, not surprising that (Christian) Armenians and Georgians were especially active in this trade. Saffron, which was in great demand, came mostly from Khurasan. In districts where there was hardly any frost in winter, figs and above all dates were harvested. There were extensive date-plantations everywhere in Khuzistan and also in the province of Kirman and on the Caspian coast. Olives and citrus fruits were grown in the climatically favoured districts, limes especially in the fertile areas by the Persian Gulf, and Persian bitter oranges {ndranj) mainly on the shores of the Caspian and in Kirman. The cultivation of sweet oranges {purtaqdf) also increased after the contacts with the Portuguese, i.e. in the 17th and 18th centuries, but it did not reach the same extent as today. Cultivation of poppies (for the extraction of opium) and hemp was widespread in all areas. As has been indicated above, in Iran irrigation was a decisive factor for every kind of agriculture. The following irrigation techniques have been handed down from the 1 ith/iyth century: surface irrigation with water from springs or rivers; "underground" irrigation from deep wells {chdh) fed by ground-water; and irrigation by means of qanat (or kartz), underground channels, expensive to construct, which were driven through strata carrying ground-water. These methods are
known well before the 8th/i4th century and are still practised today.1 Orchards and plantations, as we have already mentioned, required a greater supply of water than simple agriculture. We therefore find this type of cultivation mostly in places where surface irrigation with riverwater was possible. In the crown provinces of the nth/17th century the ruler had a monopoly of water and leased it to the holders of fiefs

and to peasants. Thus the Band-i amir dam in Fars, for example, which went back to the Buyid epoch, is said to have brought in some
thousand tumdns annually for the royal treasury.1 In a similar way, in other areas the landlord at any given time had special rights of ownership with regard to water and irrigation works. It hardly needs to be emphasised that the irrigation problem was of an entirely different character in the humid Caspian provinces. Because of the limited range of the irrigation systems, agricultural operations were always restricted to a specific cultivation area; it therefore proved necessary to manure the exhausted and meagre soil regularly. For the most part the dung of asses, cattle, camels and sheep served the purpose, and the fertilising effect of human excreta was also highly esteemed. The cesspits of town houses were therefore emptied regularly by local peasants coming to market, in order that they could transfer this valuable material to their fields and gardens. Generally all the rubbish of the towns was — as it still is — carefully gathered up by
peasants and used as fertiliser.2 Ox and camel dung were also used as fuel. It was a very common practice to use the ground-up remnants of decayed mud walls, which had been made durable by an admixture of fermented straw and chaff and thus contained valuable chemicals. Pigeon droppings were held to be the most valuable fertiliser. Even today strangely shaped pigeon towers {kabutarkhana) are a characteristic feature of the environs of Isfahan; often up to ten thousand birds nest in them. These buildings, of which similar examples are found at al-Fayyum in Egypt, date back to the 17th century. Every day considerable quantities of the precious salpetre-like substance were — and still are — obtained from them. In former times a fixed tax was levied by
the state for the erection of these towers.3 Landlords and wealthy peasants used to store up large quantities of cereals for considerable periods. For this purpose they generally used large vessels, in which the goods to be kept were covered over with dry straw and sand. It was also customary to bury stores in large dry holes in the ground and cover them with sand. Apples, for example, could be kept for a whole year in this manner. Peasants often buried their harvest produce, to keep it out of the reach of tax-collectors, highwaymen or predatory nomads.

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
We should add a word on mills and milling. There were mills in many districts; these, however, did not always belong to the peasant production sector, since their products (meal and flour, especially wheat-flour, and oils in the case of oil-mills) were in great measure intended for urban consumers. The meal needed for private use was generally ground by the peasants themselves. From the technological point of view there were mainly two types of mills: those driven by draught animals and - along watercourses - watermills. There was probably a trend towards an increasing number of watermills; these were in general use in the 17th century. There are also said to have
been windmills in some parts of the country, e.g. in Khurasan.1 The settled peasants practised cattle-breeding only to a limited degree, usually only for the reproduction of draught animals and possibly also to satisfy their own very modest demand for meat. Poultry preferably chickens and pigeons, and in the Caspian regions also ducks — was bred mostly in the vicinity of the towns, obviously with a view to being sold in the markets. The major part in satisfying the demand for meat was played by the nomad cattle-breeders, whose extensive flocks and herds - mostly sheep and goats, camels, and in Khuzistan also buffaloes - were to be met with everywhere. There had been nomad tribes in Iran even before the arrival of the Turks and Mongols - Kurds, Bakhtiyars, Lurs, Baliichis (all of Iranian origin), and Bedouin Arabs (e.g. the Banii Ka'b) in Khuzistan ('"Arabistan"). In the period under discussion here, the tribes of Turkish origin were predominant. In addition, ethnically very heterogeneous tribes had developed in the Il-Khanid period under the leadership of Mongol soldiers; these probably succumbed to far-reaching Turkicisation during the 8th/14th and 9th/15 th centuries. Each tribe had at its disposal a clearly defined and extensive pasture area, consisting of a summer pasture (jailaq) and a winter pasture (qishlaq), which might often be at a great distance from one another. The summer pastures lay in the highlands, while the winter pastures were always to be found in extensive lowland tracts. The tribes were divided into sub-tribes and clans; the smallest organisational unit was a nomad household consisting of several tents (Turkish oba). The total pasture territory of a tribe was
called jurt.2 The supreme authority over a yurt was exercised by the

THE RURAL ECONOMY
members of the tribal aristocracy, headed by the chief. Even though the flocks and herds were regarded as the communal property of the tribe concerned, they were in fact controlled by the leaders of the tribe, whose decisions were generally accepted because of their rank and prestige. The strict discipline prevailing within the tribes was also connected with the fact that every Turkish nomad tribe, down to the time of 'Abbas I and to a lesser degree even later, was at the same time also a military unit and the tribal hierarchy was generally identical with the military hierarchy. We have already mentioned that the nomads met the demand for meat. Besides this, they also produced wool, supplied hides, did a small amount of tanning and made milk products of various kinds. They lived in tents; whereas the Mongolian felt tent (known as yurt) has been used in north-eastern Iran down to the present day, the type called the "black tent" came into general use in the central highlands and in western Iran from the Mongol period onwards. A "black tent" consisted of specially-cut pieces made of spun goat's wool. This was an excellent heat-insulating material, and the tents made of it were probably more mobile than the robust yurt. In Khuzistan the wandering herdsmen and shepherds also made themselves reed huts, which could be quickly erected. The economic aim of the nomad cattle-breeders was a constant enlargement of their stock; it must however be remembered that the annual increase was very much lessened by consumption for their own needs and by substantial surrendering of cattle to the state or the court and above all to the superiors of the tribe and to its leader. Cattle-dealing on a larger scale was carried on only by tribal leaders and their subordinates; these also made the greatest profits. More and more the leaders of tribes settled in the towns, above all in times of peace, and especially when they exercised administrative functions, as for example the Qizilbash governors. They thus became somewhat estranged from the way of life of their fellow-tribesmen, but never to such a degree as to risk losing their absolute authority. These were not the only circumstances in which there was a community of interests between the nomad leaders and the traditional landlords. As we shall see later, in the course of the 14th, 15 th and 16th centuries, tribal chiefs were often the possessors of large "fiefs" or beneficia and thereby combined two social functions. Hunting and fishing were probably always of limited economic importance. Hunting was practised as a sport by the genteel and rich; apart from this it was also one of the special characteristics of nomad
497



SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
life. Among the settled population, large-scale hunting and fishing were carried on only in the Caspian coastal areas, where game and fish were plentiful; there was also fishing in the waters of the Persian Gulf. For obvious reasons, the exploitation of fish was confined to the regions concerned. In general, the consumption of fish or game (chiefly gazelles, wild goats and game birds) was unusual among the town-dwellers of the interior of the Iranian plateau, except at court and in wealthy households, where such things were regarded as special delicacies. It gave 'Abbas I particular pleasure to prepare wifh his own hands game that he had killed
and to have it served to his guests and hunting companions.1 Finally, a few words about the exploitation of mineral resources. In the 17th century at least, the Crown held sovereign rights over mining, salt-production and pearlrfishing. The yield from these formed an essential source of revenue for the royal treasury. Among the most valuable mining products were the turquoises from the celebrated mines near NIshapur. The exploitation of these mines was from time to time prohibited by the shah. Large quantities of copper were extracted in Khurasan and above all in Kirman, while the gold and silver mines of Iran were already so exhausted in the 1 ith/i7th century that it was no longer possible to work them. Lead came mainly from Yazd and Kirman; iron was extracted in Khurasan. Lastly, sulphur, mercury
and antimony were also mined.2 The demand for salt was satisfied by the rich rock-salt deposits of Iran; there were also of course extensive salt-works in the Persian Gulf area, where sea-salt was obtained by evaporation. Travellers made particular mention of such salt-works,
especially in Hurmuz.3 We must also remember the mineral oil deposits in the Baku and Khuzistan (Shushtar) area. Sometimes the exploitation of "oil-wells" {cbab-i naff) was incumbent upon local landlords;
these wells were of course only gushers.4 We must also mention the dangers that threatened the existence of large parts of the population in every age — namely, natural disasters of various kinds. The most serious of these were crop failures and the ensuing famines: they were caused by lack of precipitation during the winter months, and they weighed most heavily on the rural population. The consequences of a period of drought affected not only the

settled peasants but also nomad herdsmen and cattle-breeders; it often took five years or more to re-establish a herd that had been decimated by drought and lack of pasture. In the borderlands of the Great Desert the daily battle for water was coupled with fighting off the wind-borne sand that had for thousands of years been endeavouring to bury the settlements lying there. Walls had to be built to protect fields and gardens, and the advancing desert continually threatened to dry up the essential wells and destroy the irrigation systems. Iran is one of the most restless tectonic zones on earth; in consequence of this, disastrous earthquakes occurred repeatedly. Those who suffered most from them were villagers living in frail mud huts, but hardly anyone escaped unhurt in an affected area. Diseases and epidemics, often intensified by lack of water and absence of hygiene, also endangered many lives. The towns were especially prone to epidemics because of the crowded living conditions in high-concentration centres: the plague epidemic at Herat in the year 838/1435 as described by 'Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandl is an instance of this. In such cases, the sparsely populated flat country proved to be a cordon sanitaire by which the epidemic could be prevented from spreading to other towns. In the rural areas, however, diseases like cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery and malaria were endemic, especially in Gllan, Khuzistan and the coastal areas by the Persian Gulf; they were dreaded - not without cause - by European travellers, and in every age they were a danger to the rural population.
THE VARIOUS FORMS AND INSTITUTIONS OF LANDHOLDING
It is hardly possible to give a simple definition of all the forms of landholding which existed in the period under discussion. At one end of the scale there was private ownership; at the other there were beneficia, privileges and tax-farming ; while in between came grants somewhat reminiscent of the European "fief" and for which that term will be employed in this chapter, although it should be noted that they did not correspond to it at all points. The institutions already existing in the Mongol period underwent various changes between the 14th and the 18th century. Furthermore in the course of time a number of new concepts and institutions arose, which in practice again changed rapidly and probably assumed
499

different forms in different areas of Iran. Clarification of the problem of landholding is also complicated by the fact that the legal concepts of landlordship do not always give a true picture of the actual situation. In the following exposition we will try, as far as possible, to explain the various institutions on the basis of their legal definitions and to describe how they worked in practice, how they developed and changed in the course of time, and how new types of landlordship emerged. In principle, the following categories of land were recognised from the 'Abbasids onwards: (i) divaniland (state land), (ii) mulk land (private estates), (iii) vaqf land ( charitable or religious endowment land), and
(iv) khdssa land (crown land).1 However, this ideal scheme cannot be applied to our period without closer scrutiny. Within the category of "state land" in particular there was a bewildering mass of institutions by which the state's title to land was, to a greater or lesser degree, transferred to individuals. Let us first clarify the concept. All areas whose tax revenues were at the disposal of the state were regarded as divani land. Part of this income was used to finance the civil service and the military; especially from the Mongol period onwards the authorities no longer restricted themselves to collecting the traditional kharaj (land tax), but levied a number of special taxes. These did not conform with the religious law, but were generally legitimised in the Il-Khanid period by the Yasa, the code of Chingiz Khan. Their numbers, and the amounts required, varied at different times and in differ
ent places.2 It was the normal practice for the tax officials ('ummdl) of the time to collect the prescribed taxes on the spot. For centuries, however, this procedure had already been breached by the granting of fiscal privileges and beneficia. The most widespread forms of beneficium - already under the Buyids and particularly from the Saljiiq period onwards - consisted of the various types of iqtS ? This institution was based on the procedure that high officials or military leaders were not paid in cash, but each received the tax revenue of a certain territory instead. In other words, the iqta' consisted above all in the state's yielding the right of tax collection to individual persons. In those cases where this procedure represented a substitute for salary,

FORMS AND INSTITUTIONS OF LANDHOLDING
this right was attached to the performance of certain administrative or military duties within the framework of the state. It was therefore neither transferable nor hereditary on the part of the holder of the beneficium. This stipulation, however, remained legal theory, especially with regard to the military iqta'. The army of the Great Saljuq state was based on nomadic Turkish tribal formations, and every tribal unit was at the same time also a military unit. Just as the leader's rank was hereditary within the hierarchy of the tribe, so also his state function (as a military leader) passed to his heir, and thus the iqta' in question became defacto the basis of subsistence for several generations of tribal leaders. Nizam al-Mulk had still required that the iqta'-dar (also muqta', holder of an iqta') should have no direct contact with the peasants of his iqta' and should confine himself exclusively to collecting the dues. However, towards the end of the 6th/12th century the iqta'-dars regarded their beneficia as hereditary property. If one considers that the iqta'-dar's family had already held the beneficium for some generations and the iqta'-dar himself had military forces under his control, one can easily understand that he was interested in something more than the tax yield of the territory assigned to him. To an increasing extent he appropriated to himself sovereign rights over the territory, and at the beginning of the 8th/14th century the term iqta' signified not only the ceding of the beneficium but also the actual land concerned. The central power insofar as one existed - and the legal institutions connected with it did not always recognise this state of affairs. They held fast to the principle that the iqta' was a beneficium attached to a person and his function. This proceeding was justified, insofar as the spreading and development of the military iqta' system in the time of the Great Saljuqs had undoubtedly played a large part in bringing about the collapse of their state. Moreover, there was probably little inclination to reconcile the legal recognition of the hereditary character of the iqta', and the sovereign rights exercised by the iqta'-dar, with the principle of religious law that the Caliph or the ruler was the owner of all land.
Further development of the iqta' was stimulated in the Mongol period. Under the Tl-Khans the military-nomadic element had gained the upper hand in every sphere of life. After the administrative and economic reforms under Ghazan Khan and his vizier Rashld al-Dln there existed a form of iqta' that no longer had anything much in common with the original fiscal beneficium: the iqta'-dar was the head of a military unit organised on a tribal basis, the commander of a force
501



SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
of anything from a thousand to ten thousand men. His iqta' was hereditary and his powers were so extensive that he was able to regrant sections of his iqta', as subinfeudations, so to speak, to subordinate commanders (tribal sub-leaders). The holders of the various subinfeudations were inspected annually, however, by state officials to make sure that they fulfilled all the duties arising from their grants, especially with regard to military service. Any such holder who was found unworthy was deprived of the right to his beneficium. This was a highly developed form of the authority of amirs — military commanders, as can be deduced from the foregoing, and mainly of Turco-Mongolian origin - over what were often very extensive areas of cultivated land, including the settled population living on and dependent on this land for their livelihood. The break-up of the Il-Khanid state and the consequent weakening of all the elements of the central administration increased the independence of the amirs in all parts of the country. From this form of a large-scale military iqta' in the Mongol period, as we have just described it, a new institution developed under the Jalayirids around the middle of the 8th/i4th century which gave its beneficiaries the greatest power over cultivated land and its people that a landlord could achieve in the following centuries of Iranian history. This was the suyurghal, which we shall discuss later. The development of the iqta' during the Saljuq and Mongol periods had of course not led to the disappearance of the iqta' in its original sense by the middle of the 8th/i4th century or later. It had been customary, under the rule of all the dynasties with which we are concerned, to pay officials or clergy by granting them the tax revenue of certain places or districts, and by the Safavid period a whole series of modifications of this procedure had developed. These various forms differ from one another chiefly because of the fact that often only parts' of the tax revenue were granted — shares of total amounts, or merely the yield of certain tax sources - or else because the areas on which the calculations were based might be of widely differing extent. Moreover, the grant might be subject to certain conditions. The following methods of procedure are in part known from the Jalayirid period. Firstly, the idrdr; an idrar grant gave the beneficiary the right to claim a fixed share of the kharaj revenues from a defined area. His title to this fixed sum was generally hereditary and was conferred, at least nominally, by the ruler. This procedure was basically
502



FORMS AND INSTITUTIONS OF LANDHOLDING
the same as an earlier institution called iqtff-i i/dra.1 It should be said incidentally that an idrar might consist not only of shares of agricultural taxes but also of shares of taxes on commerce and property (tamgha). A non-hereditary form of idrar was also known, namely the idrdr-i ma'isha, which was only valid for the beneficiary's lifetime. In both cases the idrar could be converted into a muqassa by decree of the ruler. A muqassa differed from an idrar in that it granted not shares of taxes but regular shares of property; like the idrar, it was either for life only (muqdssa-ji ma'isha) or devisable. The hereditary nature of a grant was usually expressed by the term abadi ("eternal","perpetual") and sometimes by sarmadi ("eternal"), or else by a combination of the two words, abadi va sarmadi. For a hereditary muqassa there was also the formulation muqdssa-ji idrar. In many respects the muqassa corre
sponded to the iqtet-i tamlik of earlier periods.2 With the establishment of a muqassa the land in question was removed from the authority of the divan, and in the case of an "eternal" muqassa there was little likelihood that the granted land would ever again be available for the profit of the divan. The holder of the muqassa also enjoyed some degree of administrative immunity; in a muqassa decree there appears the set formula which was still in use in the following centuries, qalam va qadam kutah va kashida ddrand ("secured against the pen, protected against access", or sine introitu iudicum); this formula indicated the transfer of administrative rights from the official mentioned in the deed to
the holder of the grant.3 It is, however, possible that in this particular case the formula refers only to tax officials. The advantages of the muqassa over the simple idrar were above all that the holder of the muqassa not only had taxation rights but also received the landlord's shares of the crops due to him as part owner or exclusive owner. In any case, the rights accruing to the landlord from a muqassa-yi idrar were entirely similar to those attached to a large military iqta'. The decisive criterion was probably the size of the area in question. In terms of form, these two procedures had created the basis for the development
of the suyiirghal.4 Idrar and muqassa - even when they were only ma'isha ("for life") - carried too many advantages to the holder for them to be used exclusively for the purpose of paying salaries. It can

therefore be assumed that the recipients of idrar and muqassa could claim meritorious services as grounds for this distinction; they were probably deserving officials, the ruler's favourites, and religious dignitaries. These last were, in the 9th/15 th century and also in the Safavid period, largely holders of smaller and medium-sized suyurghals, with which the muqassa had a good deal in common. On the other hand, the idrar was continued in later times in the form of payment of salaries by means of bardt (tax cheques; see below) and in the mustamarri, which was, down to the Qajar period, understood as the payment of a pension to deserving persons. There are also connections between the idrar and the payment of a va%tfa in certain cases that are known from the later Safavid period. A vazlfa was understood as the payment of an annuity or the grant of certain rights of landholding to members of the religious class; normally vaqf land formed the basis of a vazlfa, and we shall return to this subject when discussing vaqf land. Vazlfa annuities could also be paid out of tax revenues from dlvanl land, and in this case we are strongly reminded of the idrar. The assignment of a vazlfa had, however, to be renewed
every year.1 The same condition existed in the case of ayak-sdia (in
full, bardt-i yak-sdla, i.e. one-year tax cheque).2 As this method of effecting payment out of tax revenues from certain areas — a method known from the Safavid period — was applied exclusively to salaries, we shall deal with it later on. We see then that various forms of "feudal" rule were exercised not only by amirs, local princes and provincial governors, who belonged to the arbdb-i saif ("men of the sword"), but also by civilian landlords, who belonged to the arbdb-i qalam ("men of the pen", officials) or to the arbdb-i 'amd'im ("men of the turbans", i.e. 'ulamd, shaikhs, sayyids, teachers). But the most perfect forms of such "feudal" rule are encountered in the 9th/15 th and as late as the ioth/i6th century within the framework of the institution we have repeatedly mentioned here, the suyiirghal. Before pursuing the history of this institution from the later 14th century to the early 18th century we will try to demonstrate some of its main characteristics. The Mongol word soyurghal originally meant nothing more than "act of favour" (from the ruler), "grant", or "donation". The expres

FORMS AND INSTITUTIONS OF LANDHOLDING
sion suyurghamishi already had this general significance under the Tl-Khans. The first known occurrence of the word as the designation of
a certain kind of "fief" is in the Jalayirid period.1 The holder of a suyurghal {sahib-suyurghat) enjoyed a number of rights over the estate in question. Above all — and this had already been characteristic of the iqta' - he was entitled to the tax yield of his area and in addition exercised rights of ownership over the tract of land in question (which was also called suyurghal). Furthermore, the suyurghal carried with it exemption from taxes; this point was always mentioned separately in the deeds conferring suyurghals. Thus a superficial inspection of the documents might give the impression that the privilege of tax-exemption (mu'dft, musallamt) was a separate element from the suyurghal. This is not quite correct; every suyurghal grant shows at the same time the granting of immunity from taxes, and in many cases it is also stated that even in the event of an increase in the tax yield, e.g. of the kharaj by virtue of rising productivity, or of the poll-tax (Ji%ya) when the population of non-Muslims living in the suyurghal area had
grown, the surplus was to go to the holder of the suyurghal.2 This usage can hardly be explained by saying that the divan authority had wanted to recognise the suyurghal only as a beneficium, in order to prevent too great a concentration of power in the hands of the landlord. The deed, as drawn up, rather served the landlord as a legal instrument that he could produce in order to defend himself successfully against the local and regional tax officials if they made tax claims on the suyurghal land. The same problem arises with the other privileges pertaining to a suyurghal "fief", namely those of administrative immunity and hereditary rights. Just as immunity from taxes was very often indicated by a detailed list of all the relevant dues, so also the previously mentioned formula for administrative immunity was in most cases preceded by a list of all the officials who were forbidden to set foot on the territory of the suyurghal or to make demands upon it. The formula we have already quoted, qalam va qadam kutdh va kashida ddrand, was usually employed for the administrative autonomy of the sahib-suyurghal. Besides this, the following expression might be used: 'ummdl ba-htch vajh min al-vujiih dar an madkhal nasayand ("the tax officials may not penetrate there under any circumstances"). This is

found in a deed of Rustam Aq Quyunlu dated 27 Ramadan 902/29 May 1497. Otherwise the administrative and associated legal prerogatives were simply listed in full detail, as in suyurghal deeds of Jahan Shah Qara Quyunlu dated 3 Rajab 859/19 June 1455 and of Shah
Isma'il I dated 10 Rajab 915/24 October 1509.1 On the demise of the sahib-suyurghal the "fief" passed to his heirs; the Muslim law of inheritance was, however, not necessarily observed. The transfer was always confirmed by the drawing up of a deed,
generally on the part of the ruler.2 But this is not to be taken as implying that the heirs would always have needed the ruler's explicit assent. The rights to the existing suyurghal could be simply transferred to the heir or heirs. It was very much in the interests of the new holder of the suyurghal to have a deed recording the transfer; he could then use this against anyone who was trying to restrict his suyurghal territory or his prerogative. We can deduce from the text of many suyurghal deeds, especially from such confirmations, that particular clauses were inserted for specific reasons. The advantages the suyurghal brought to its holder were often accompanied by conditions, especially with regard to military service, or at least the obligation to provide a number of well-equipped warriors. But there were also suyurghals that were free from any obligations. This was especially the case with religious dignitaries to whom suyurghals were granted, a custom practised under the Timurids and also in the Turkmen and Safavid
periods.3 In such cases the suyurghal was in the nature of a distinction; moreover, this act on the part of the ruler was often interpreted as
payment of the obligatory t^akat (alms tax),4 since it was fundamentally a matter of pious conduct. With such an interpretation, attention could also be called to the fact that a large number of receivers of alms were supported out of the income of a religious suyurghal-holder, even though the beneficiaries might in many cases have been merely the working ra'aya of the suyurghal. It was also possible for non-religious personages to receive such suyurghals of "distinction", as in the case of
the poet Salman Savajl.5 With smaller suyurghals it could happen that the material basis

of the suyurghal was not the title to the entire tax yield from the suyurghal area, but only a claim to certain tax revenues. These were either defined as a specific sum of money or else limited to specific tax sources. In such cases the prerogative rights of the sahib-suyurghal were of course also reduced. Suyurghal land could thus be of varying extent. There were suyurghals on villages, and indeed even on parts of villages; but small or large districts, and even entire provinces, could be granted as suyurghal. In the case of large suyurghals the prerogative rights and the material basis enjoyed by the holder were so extensive that he could acquire not only economic, but also political power. In any case, the institution of suyurghal formed a basis for all the forces in the state that were opposed to centralisation. It is therefore not surprising that we find the largest suyurghals, in terms of both territory and absoluteness of prerogative rights, in the 9th/15 th century. In loose political confederations like those of the Qara Quyunlu and Aq Quyunlu (and also the Timurids) large territories were granted as suyurghal. When new areas came under the sovereignty of the state the former territories of the local rulers were often returned to them as suyurghal. As one surveys the conditions and characteristics of the suyurghal and compares them with the administrative system of governorships in the 15 th century, one comes to the inevitable conclusion that the governorships, in every case where the governor belonged to the military aristocracy or to the
ruling house, to some extent represented gigantic suyurghals.1 When, for instance, Uzun Hasan Aq Quyunlu wanted to abolish the tamgha (the municipal trade taxes, which were forbidden by religious law), he had to give up his intention in face of the resistance of the amirs, i.e.
the Turkmen military leaders;2 obviously most or all of them were entitled to a share of the tax yield not only of villages but also of towns. As the "fiefs" of the tribal military leaders (in fact, these very amirs) in particular were not restricted to individual settlements but also included living-space for the members of their tribes, this practice is clear evidence for the territorial extension of their suyurghals - and it was certainly these that were involved, since the suyurghal had to a great extent superseded the other forms of military "fief" during the Turkmen period. It may be assumed that there were several towns in

each of their areas, and thus it was worth their while to defend their income from the yield of the tamgha. This example makes it plain that every attempt at building an empire, since it required centralisation of power and administration, had to work against the owners of the great suyurghals. A policy of weakening the suyurghals was in fact adopted under the Aq Quyunlu rulers Ya'qub and Ahmad, and the Safavids too regarded the restriction of the suyurghal system as an important element in their internal policy. Ya'qub's vizier, QazI SafI al-Dln 'Isa of Sava, in his attempts to restrain the growth of the suyurghal system, directed his measures primarily against the holders of small and medium-sized suyurghals. It obviously seemed to him too dangerous to embroil himself with the great amirs, and he therefore picked on those that had no condition of obligatory military service attached to them. Most of these, as we have shown above, belonged to religious dignitaries, and thus QazI 'Isa got himself into a paradoxical situation. On the one hand he was basing his intentions on the argument that the abolition of the suyurghals served to assure the supremacy of the Sharl'a over the Yasa, and on the other 'hand he was, on this pretext, actually taking drastic steps against the clergy! After this obviously abortive attempt the importance of the suyurghal increased steadily, and it is related of Rustam Aq Quyunlu (898-902/1493-1497) that he granted more suyurghals than any prince
of the Aq Quyunlu or the Qara Quyunlu had ever done before.1 His successor Ahmad Beg Aq Quyunlu, together with his high officials, renewed the struggle against the suyurghal holders, but this time with different methods from those used by QazI 'Tsa in his day. He declared the provisions of all the "perpetual" suyurghals granted under his predecessors to be invalid. Moreover, he deprived most of the religious holders of their various privileges, especially that of exemption from taxes. It is clear that this action angered the powerful military aristocracy against Ahmad, and after only seven months as ruler he died in battle against insurgent amirs (905/1497). The Safavids did indeed grant suyurghals, but their policy in this field was clearly different from that of their predecessors. There were small and medium-sized suyurghals throughout the Safavid period, and the beneficiaries were generally arbab-i 'ama'im, i.e. religious dignitaries. There were also cases where suyurghals were granted not to

persons but to pious foundations. The mutavalli (administrator) of the foundation in question then had the benefit of such a suyurghal, and the whole business was probably a formal artifice to restrict the
accumulation of prerogative rights in the hands of a single person.1 In addition, various tax liabilities were imposed on the suyurghal holders; for example, in the late 17th and early 18 th century the sadr-i a'%am
received a percentage of the income from the suyurghals.2 The progressive depreciation of the currency also played its part in weakening the suyurghals, especially those whose yield had from the start been defined as a specific sum of money. When the Safavids assumed power the days of the great suyurghals were over. Recalcitrant great landlords were simply deprived of their latifundia by degree; other measures were also taken, such as the suspension of suyurghals in certain provinces (e.g. under 'Abbas I in
Azarbaijan).3 In the newly-arisen Safavid state governorships and large territories were granted to Qizilbash tribes or their leaders, but this was now done in the form not of suyurghal but of non-hereditary tiyiil (see below). Naturally - as the course of Safavid history shows - this procedure could not prevent the appearance of centrifugal tendencies; nevertheless the central power was considerably strengthened by avoiding the growth of large suyurghals, and its organs consciously directed their policy towards this end. There is one peculiarity we should mention. In some Safavid deeds of grant vaqf estates are described as the suyurghal of their mutavalli. This is probably explained by the fact that in those days the functions exercised by a mutavalli were in practice identical with those of a sahib-suyiirghal; they were entitled to tax revenues, enjoyed immunity from taxation, and exercised prerogative rights over their own territory. Moreover, their position was likewise hereditary, and their ra'aya were bound to the soil. The suyurghal-holders belonged mainly to the religious class: according to Chardin none but religious families were
beneficiaries of suyurghals.4 The contamination of the two types of landlordship {tauliyat, i.e. administration of foundation property, and suyurghal) is no longer surprising, since the exercise of power was identical in both cases, even though their legal bases must be distinguished from one another.

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Let us now recapitulate the most important characteristics and peculiarities of the suyurghal. It represented a hereditary grant of land with the title to the tax yield (or part of it), immunity from taxation, and prerogative rights which, in the case of large suyurghals, extended to administrative and judicial immunity. Further, it can be regarded as characteristic that the large suyurghals of the 15 th century (Timurids, Qara Quyunlu, Aq Quyunlu) were in the hands of powerful amirs, mostly of Turkmen origin, and thus formed the basis of their political power. The lords of large suyurghals were more or less independent rulers over their own territories; they were, however, obliged to play an active part in the military operations of their sovereign. Restriction of the large suyurghals was a precondition for any attempt to centralise the state. The small suyurghals - of rather second-rate importance before 15 00 even though they were widespread - represented the archetype of the suyurghal in the Safavid period. This type of suyurghal was less often connected with services to be rendered; it had rather the character of a distinction or honour for special merit. The holders of mediumsized and small suyurghals were from the start predominantly 'ulama; in the late Safavid period there were probably hardly any suyurghals granted to persons who did not belong to the religious sphere. We can see from this summary that the suyurghal involved the elaboration and fusion of a number of "feudal" institutions that had grown up by the middle of the 8th/14th century. In the small suyurghals, especially those of the Safavid type, we can easily recognise elements of the muqassa. Various types of the Saljuq iqta' survived in all the forms of suyurghal, and it is evident that the large suyurghal was a direct development from the Mongol military iqta'. The final form of the suyurghal was made possible mainly by the weakness of the central power in the successor states to the Il-Khanid empire. There is also the very significant fact that the ties between the legal system of that age and the Sharl'a were relatively loose owing to the considerable influence of the Yasa. This makes it much easier to codify the concept of suyurghal. The suyurghal had arisen in a period of weak central power, and in the 15 th century the Timurids, Qara Quyunlu and Aq Quyunlu found it a serious impediment to the development of lasting empires with a strong, centrally oriented monarchy. The large suyurghal was also one of the bases for the economic and administrative opposition between the (military-nomadic) Turkish elements in the population and the settled Persian elements.

FORMS AND INSTITUTIONS OF LANDHOLDING
We still have to ask the question whether the suyurghal was granted from state land and, if so, how far one could still speak of "state land" with reference to suyurghals. Again we have to distinguish between large and small suyurghals. The former undoubtedly represented a change in the character of divanl land, to which their territories had once belonged. With the smaller suyurghals this was not necessarily the case. They were not granted exclusively from state land, but rather from vaqf land and — above all in the 17th and 18th centuries — from
crown land.1 However, at that time it was possible for the ruler to encroach directly upon the interests of a governor and his officials by making a suyurghal grant from divanl land. One of the most important constituents of the suyurghal was the privilege of fiscal immunity, which in medieval Europe was known as exemptio. This privilege had of course been practised long before the collapse of the Il-Khanid state, and in the period with which we are concerned it was by no means exclusively connected with a suyurghal grant. We know of many cases where tax exemptions were granted, and in practice any tax-paying subject could receive one. Here, in connection with the suyurghal, we intend to deal only with exemptions in the agricultural sector. The privilege of tax exemption was in principle designated by the terms mUdji or musallami (pi. musallamiyyat). Fiscal immunity reached back to pre-Mongol times; under the Tl-Khans it was enriched with the qualities of a similar procedure introduced by Chingiz Khan. The Mongol privilege of immunity not only had the character of a mark of distinction or honour, but was also valid for the clergy of any recognised creed, for nobles, and for children. Some elements of this Mongol institution were still practised in the following centuries. It thus became the custom to grant exemptions to religious personages, and among these not only Muslim but also Christian (especially Armenian) clerics were included. Vaqf land was also subject to exemption. Fiscal immunity for aristocrats (probably mostly nomads) or nobles of the state might include a provision — also of Mongol origin and still in use under the Timurids — that the person in question was, in addition to the mu'afl, also exempt from criminal prosecution for transgressions of the law, the number of offences that might go unpunished being precisely denned. Down to the 15 th century the holder of a hereditary tax exemption for a particular tract of land was

called tarkhdn; the granting of this type of immunity and also the land concerned were called tarkhdni. Originally tarkhan was a term applied to Mongol nobles, but later it was extended to those who, without being themselves members or descendants of the Mongol nomad aristocracy, nevertheless enjoyed their privileges, particularly the hereditary tax exemption of their land. In these circumstances the tarkhani represented
a component that had entered into the institution of the suyurghal.1 The recipient of a mu'afl could be a corporate body as well as an individual; as we have mentioned above, the 'ulama and vaqf estates were exempted from taxes. Large mulk estates (see below) often enjoyed a mu'afl, and tenant farmers {musta'jir), who were liable to pay taxes, could likewise be exempted. Tiyuls were also often combined with a mu'afl. In the decrees we find, among others, the following formulae for exemption: mu'df va musallam ddnand ("to be recognised as exempted from liability to pay taxes"), mu'df va musallam va burr va marfif al-qalam ddnand ("to be recognised as freed from liability to pay taxes, disposing freely [of his territory] and secured from the pen"),
mu'df va tarkhdn va mar jit al-qalam ("exempt from taxes, [made] tarkhan and secured from the pen") and mafrur va mustasnd shindsand ("to be recognised as freed and excepted"). Exemptions could be granted en bloc; it was also possible to be exempted from individual dues, sometimes only up to a specified amount. In all cases more or less exact details were given in the decrees. Every decree dealing with a tax exemption was provided with a "tax list", which indeed often included not only the actual taxes of the time but also older ones that no longer existed; when this list was made up, dues from identical (or similar) sources of tax could be grouped together. This was often done in order to prevent the tax-collectors from using the pretext of formal objections, by which they might possibly have been able to collect the dues: this might be done merely by the insertion of previous deeds and by invoking certain chancery traditions. The issuing of decrees for fiscal immunity and the registration of them was the duty of the financial department of the divdn-i mamdlik (state land administration) or the divdn-i khdssa (crown land administration). In both cases the procedure generally resulted in the execution of a deed by the sovereign.

The tiyul1 is an institution that is in many respects similar to the suyurghal. In post-Mongol times this term replaced the word iqta', and various procedures that had developed in the framework of the iqta' up to the early 14th century survived as a rule in the tiyul. Thus tiyul is really a later synonym of iqta', and the historians of the Safavid period
used "iqta"' simply as an archaism for "tiyul".2 In the 15 th century, when the members of the military aristocracy held their great suyurghals, the tiyuls were used to pay officials, and thus the tiyuls of officers of high rank may well have been in many respects similar to the medium-sized suyurghals of "the higher religious dignitaries. For the sake of simplicity, let us set out the various manifestations of the tiyiil in the Safavid period. The following characteristics apply to all tiyuls: (i) The tiyiil was in principle subject to a time-limit and therefore not devisable; tiyuls were hardly ever recognised as hereditary, (ii) The tiyul was always involved with some service to be rendered, either the performance of an office or the obligation to raise an army or military units: it therefore represented the usual method of payment for this, (iii) The fundamental constituent of the tiyul was the grant of the tax yield from a particular area or of a part of that yield. These are the formal basic elements that had been equally characteristic of the earlier iqta'. We must emphasise the word "formal" in this context: the economic, social and political effects of the various forms of tiyul were in no way dependent on these three elements, but were rather related to the territorial and financial extent of the tiyul in question and also to the additional rights granted to the tiyul holder (tiyiilddr) or claimed by him. The large tiyuls of the Safavid period were either "fiefs" of high officials or military "fiefs". As we have already said, under the Safavids the members of the military aristocracy were now granted their extensive territories as tiyul and no longer as suyurghal. This was the case with governors {hakim, pi. hukkam), with Qizilbash nobles who occupied official posts, and with other military dignitaries, who were above all expected to raise troops. It is beyond doubt that the reason for avoiding suyurghal grants in such cases was

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
the intention to restrict, at least formally, the autonomy of the high amirs in the provinces. The fact that henceforward military functionaries (like the officials) were paid by tiyul may also reflect the Safavids' endeavour to assimilate the predominantly Turkish military aristocracy to the higher bureaucracy, which was mostly of Persian origin. The exercise of rights of lordship by the great tiyuldars was not noticeably different from the practice of the great sahib-suyurghals of the preSafavid era. This type of tiyuldar had absolute power over the land and its inhabitants, treated the peasants as he pleased and was assured of the non-intervention of the officials. In the time of Chardin, who travelled to Iran three times between 1655 and 1677, there were a number of tiyuls that had de facto become hereditary, so that the distinction between tiyul and the earlier suyurghal was becoming blurred. Chardin also reported that the inhabitants of tiyuls that were in practice hered
itary enjoyed better treatment than those of non-hereditary "fiefs".1 This is easily understandable: the tiyuldar with a time limit was obviously very much interested in extracting the highest possible profits from his "fief". For the holders of intermediate and higher offices there were tiyuls attached to the office, so that on a new appointment to a post there was also a new grant of the tiyul. This arrangement corresponded largely to the Ottoman khdss. Chardin's observation held good, and to an even higher degree, for the peasants of such "fiefs". However, it often happened that "special" salary contracts were concluded with new office-holders, which meant that they were granted additional tiyuls (probably only for life). In any case it held good for all these tiyuldars that the competence of the organs of the state land administration extended to them only to a limited degree. The payment of ordinary officials and holders of minor military rank was likewise effected by procedures similar to tiyuls, but special forms had developed for this sector. An essential criterion for the significance of the small tiyul with regard to landholding was whether the salary of the person concerned was assigned as global tiyul for a village or at least part of a village, or whether this tiyul was restricted to a specified (larger or smaller) sum of money — often with indication of the tax source. In the former case it could be assumed that the tiyul holder had certain rights of exploitation over the ra'aya. If, however, the tiyul consisted only of relatively small individual sums, then the recipient of

FORMS AND INSTITUTIONS OF LANDHOLDING
the salary was hardly in a position to influence production within the area of his "fief". In this context it is also an important question whether the tiyuldar had the tax yield (i.e. the income from his "fief") collected by persons subordinate to him, or whether this was effected by tax officials. (With governorships both definitions applied: the officials were subordinates of the hakim.) The answer to this question tells us a great deal about the degree of power that the tiyuldars possessed in their territories. It is evident that those paid by way of partial tiyuls stood lowest in the hierarchy of the tiyuldars. For them there were two main methods of payment: either a specified sum of money was awarded from a particular source and they could claim it every year, or the salary was reassigned annually on production of a certificate of employment. In both cases — and this also held good for somewhat more lucrative tiyiil grants — the central financial administration issued a tax-cheque (barat) for the stipulated sum, to be collected from the relevant tax district; the recipient had to cash this cheque on the spot, -and for this reason the category of barat recipients was often contrasted with the possessors of (large) tiyuls. In the former case, this assignment of tax money {havald) was effected automatically, so long as there was no decree ordering a different procedure; a standing assignment of this kind was called hama-sala. Most of the barats were probably issued through the hama-sala procedure. There was also a rather less common procedure called yak-sala, which we mentioned earlier on in our discussion of the idrar: in this case the assignment was renewed every
year.1 Salaries assigned by barat were called mavajib (i.e. dues, income). These mavajib were in practice usually a little less than the nominal value of the barat. The salary of a subordinate recipient was often issued in the form of several small assignments of different types, with the further complication that the localities assigned for payment were often so far away from the recipient that he could not possibly make the journey because of the expense and waste of time. This led to the development of a special source of profit. Persons well provided with capital bought up the issued tax-cheques for less than their nominal
1 From Minorsky, Tadbkirat al-Muluk, p. 29, it is evident that payment of tiyuls was effected through the barat system and that hama-sala and yak-sala were special cases of barat. Consequently the concept of tiyiil applied to governors, officials of high or low rank and all subordinates in receipt of salaries, in so far as their salaries were in the form of assignments. It is therefore not altogether correct, in our view, to regard tiyul, barat and hama-sala as procedures that differed basically from one another. Cf. Kaempfer, p. 96; Schuster-Walser, Das safawidiscbe Persieit, p . 38.

value and then, either personally or through representatives, collected the full amounts on the spot. This procedure was employed especially
with soldiers.1 The Qizilbash warriors of the ioth/i6th century still largely participated in the "fiefs" of their tribe (or in fact those of the tribal leader), in much the same way as with the military iqta' of the Mongols. Later they were more and more paid individually, naturally by way of assignments. The ghulaman — the royal special troops since
the time of 'Abbas I - were, however, paid in cash.2 We see that certain types of landholding survived in the Safavid tiyul. Thus elements of the idrar and the muqassa can easily be recognised in the general salary system; the large tiyuls continued the tradition of the large suyurghals of the 9th/15 th century, though they also showed some features of the Mongol tribal "fief". The replacement of suyurghal domination of the pre-Safavid type by tiyul "fiefs" did not, in the long run, bring about any large-scale weakening of the great land-holders. The attempt to strengthen the powers of the central authority by the expansion of crown land was probably more successful; we shall say more about this later. Different kinds of grants of tax revenue were subsumed, by formal criteria, into the concept of tiyul. This led in the end to a confusion of concepts. Tiyul, on the one hand, was used to convey the idea of grants in general, but also had the special sense of major "fiefs" which might have unmistakable suyurghal character. On the other hand, the term suyurghal had become rarer in the later Safavid period; it was used mainly for hereditary beneficia of distinguished and generally religious families. Clearly there was at no time any effort to define and codify, and eventually there was a certain confusion of the two ideas. In conclusion we should mention that the holders of tiyuls in the later Safavid period had to pay dues for their "fiefs". The smallest amounts were paid for tiyuls connected with military service; with these the total dues came to about 3^%. More than 10% was collected for a hama-sala, and more than 16% for a major tiyul. Holders of
suyurghals had to pay nearly a quarter of the revenue.3 The next category to be discussed is that of the mulk (pi. amldk)

estates. Mulk was understood as unconditional possession of land. The owner {malik) could do what he liked with his land and was free to sell it or transfer it to other persons; it was devisable, mostly in accordance with the relevant Islamic rules, and there were no services of any kind attached to the possession of it. At the same time the concept of mulk included the ownership of irrigation works on the land in question and the water itself. There were precise legal regulations governing the conditions on which land could become mulk, but the practice of earlier centuries had already deviated from the rules. The essential characteristic of mulk land was that the features mentioned above (devisability, vendibility) were attached to the land itself, so long as no action had been taken to divest it of its mulk character. This also applied when there were various privileges connected with the mulk. An ordinary mulk was of course liable to tax: the normal divan taxes for mulk land were one-tenth of the revenue. On the other hand, an estate of the mulk-i burr class gave its owner, to some extent automatically, the advantage of exemption from taxes. The tax officials carried mulk land of this type in their books as isqat (approximately "dropped out", i.e. from tax liability). Land of the mulk-i hurr type could therefore be sold for a considerably higher price than normal mulk land of equivalent value. It might of course also happen that the owner himself, the malik, was granted an exemption (mu'afl) from taxes. However, in this case it was a matter of a strictly personal exemption which, understandably, could not be transferred by sale to other persons together with mulk land, even when the mu'afl was hereditary. We can distinguish two different types of mulk land. On large mulk estates the soil was cultivated by the local ra'aya, and the relations between malik and peasantry had a rather patriarchal character. Here the malik was the beneficiary of his share in the yield. There was also, however, small-scale mulk land cultivated by the malik himself, though this form of mulk was very much on the decline. Conquests and frequent changes of sovereign were a danger to the continued existence of mulk land, as it was always doubtful whether the mulk character of any piece of land would still be recognised under the new ruler. As we have already said, large amlak were often converted into suyurghals. This made no difference to the actual circumstances within the land concerned; it did, however, mean the legal cancellation of its mulk status. Evidently the small malik, in such situations, was particularly at

the mercy of influential and powerful personages. It is therefore hardly possible to prove the existence of small amlak in the Timurid period or later. In the Il-Khanid period very large amlak came into being through sales and purchases. After the collapse of this dynasty the number of large amlak increased rapidly, as many persons with the power to do so possessed themselves of Il-Khanid crown estates and ultimately incorporated them into their own property. At that time it was still possible to acquire large mulk property by purchase, as is shown by the increase in the amount of land owned by the early Safavids in the environs of Ardabll (e.g. under Shaikh Sadr
al-Din).1 Subsequently the number of amlak decreased. After the Safavids had taken over, many amlak were confiscated in the course of efforts to ensure a concentration of power. A further decline of the amlak was occasioned by the creation of crown land (khassa) under 'Abbas I and probably even later; the shah forced the mulk owners to sell him their land at a low price, which almost amounted to confisca
tion.2 One special form of landholding was in many respects comparable with the mulk; this was the khalisa, an institution of Il-Khanid origin. It was understood in the 8th/14th century to be devastated and uncultivated (thus usually unirrigated) territory, forming part of either state land or crown land, which was given the advantages of a mulk (tithe, vendibility, etc.) for a limited period; in these circumstances the person who undertook the task of irrigating and cultivating the land was declared to be its landlord. Such a person was called tdni (pi. tunnS',
"resident").3 This measure to repair the ravages inflicted on agriculture by the Mongol conquest was obviously a thoroughly practical one. There may still have been khalisa land in this sense under the Timurids. Later, however, this expression denoted a particular type of crown land (see below). We may perhaps see in this a hint of the future fate of land affected by this institution. We hardly need to explain here the fundamental principles of the pious foundations (vaqf, pi. auqdf). We will merely remind the reader of a few important points. Anyone who possessed profitable movable

or immovable property could, by fulfilling certain conditions, donate this for charitable or religious purposes. Suitable recipients for donations were mosques, the graves of holy men, khanqahs (hospices for dervishes), institutions of general importance such as schools, caravansarais, bridges and wells, and also groups of persons, for example the donor's family or his descendants. In the latter case, the usual description was vaqf-i ahlt. Even fictitious persons could be made the recipients of a donation: 'Abbas I in 1015/1606-7 converted his private property into vaqf for the "Fourteen Immaculate Ones" (Muhammad, Fatima and the Twelve Imams). We shall return to this subject in a different context. In Persia there were also many auqaf for Christian
(generally Armenian) institutions, especially under the later Safavids.1 Here we shall deal mainly with donations of estates. The donor appointed an administrator (mutavalll) for his vaqf. This office was normally hereditary and an annual stipend was assigned to its holder from the endowment. In general, foundations enjoyed a mu'afl (exemption) from ordinary and special taxes. In the 8th/14th century the auqaf were controlled by the Islamic judges {qadt, pi. qudat) of the regions in question; for technical reasons special authorities were ultimately set up to deal with them. In the Safavid state - and even earlier - the control and administration of the auqaf, besides the safeguarding of the interests of Islamic law, were among the main duties of the sadr, who was head of the divan al-sadara and to whom provincial sadrs were subordinated. The competent authority for the financial administration of the auqaf was the mustauft-yi mauqufat (financial controller of foundations), who was head of an office for endowment affairs (daftar-i mauqufat). Chardin described this mustaufl as a
"lieutenant des sadr".2 Sadr authorities and mutavallls ensured the fulfilment of the various purposes of the foundations; in addition they were themselves beneficiaries of the production from vaqf land and controlled the use of it. This does not mean that the mutavalll himself might have been a member of the sadr authorities: the situation was rather that the mutavalll exercised his hereditary office like a

There are also Christian auqaf in thi Lebanon. 2 Minorsky, Tadbkirat al-Muluk, p. 146. Chardin vi, 61. Lambton, Landlord and Peasant, p. 120. Petrushevsky, KishavanJ n, 29, states that the sadr al-sudur was already the head of the divan-i mauqufat in the Il-Khanid period. According to Roemer, Staatsschreiben, pp. 143—5, however, there is no evidence for the office of sadr until the 1; th century, and at the end of the Il-Khanid period endowment affairs were the responsibility of the bdkim-i auqaj-i mamalik-i mahrusa.

landlord. Dismissal of a mutavalll was usually not within the powers of the representatives of the sadr authorities and the judges subordinated to them. The divan al-sadara and especially the daftar-i mauqufat were merely the competent authorities for the affairs of the mutavalll and his vaqf property. The extent of the autonomy of the landlord in the later Safavid period is clearly illustrated by the fact (already mentioned in our discussion of the suyurghal) that in some deeds of grant the vaqf estates of a mutavalll are spoken of as his suyurghal. Obviously the mutavalll's exercise of power over the land entrusted to him differed only very little from that of a sahib-suyurghal. We must, however, bear in mind that at this time even the sahib-suyurghal was a religious dignitary. Vaqf land could not be converted into another category of land and could, therefore, not be sold. In theory it could also not be confiscated, but in reality this was not always the case. Many auqaf had in fact been confiscated in the Mongol period, and even in later times, under the Safavids, it often happened that foundation land was removed from the competence of the divan al-sadara. Nevertheless the landowner could largely keep himself out of the reach of the organs of the state and the ruler by converting his estates into auqaf and appointing himself (and his descendants) as mutavalll. It was probably the theoretical impossibility of selling vaqf estates that caused the development of a special form of land tenancy; vaqf property was assigned to tenants (musta'jir) for a period of 99 years, in most cases probably in return for a lump sum. When this period had elapsed these tenants had to pay a sum equal to one year's tax yield of the area in question, whereupon the land was assigned to them for another 99 years. In some cases, however, a relatively small sum was collected annually as rent; the actual amount was determined by the size of the rented land. The office of mutavalll appears, at any rate in some cases, to have been very profitable, especially with foundations for the great Shl'I holy places in Iran. 'Abbas II tried to counteract the concentration of administration of large vaqf estates in the hands of a few people by
once again dividing up the estates among the mutavallls.1 It hardly made any difference to the ra'aya whether they lived on a "fief" from dlvanl land or on vaqf land. In some places there may have been some

arrangements by which the mutavalll's or the musta'jir's share in the harvest was fixed as a lump sum. In consequence of the continual devaluation of the currency, however, it was in the landlord's interests to secure a definite percentage share of the harvest. Ultimately this way of determining the share was in general use, as we see in a farman dated
Rabf II 1073/November-December 1662.1 One particular institution dates back to the time of Tahmasp I, namely the foundations for the "Fourteen Immaculate Ones" (see above); the reigning sovereign of the time was appointed as their mutavalll. The best known of these foundations is the one which, as we have already mentioned, arose from the conversion of the private estates of 'Abbas I (1015/1606—7). Such foundation property from crown land, with the sovereign himself as mutavalll, was called auqaf-i tafvijj (tafvt%, "mandate", "authorisation"). Simultaneously with this extensive increase in crown foundations the office of sadr was divided: a sadr-i khassa (sadr for crown foundations) was set up side by side with a sadr-i 'dmma (sadr for general foundations). However, the situation was not exactly that the competence of the sadr-i khassa was confined to regions in which there were foundations created by the sovereign from crown land; he was also competent for some other (defined) territories, and the sadr-i 'amma was also often concerned with crown foundations. At certain times the two sadr offices were
united in a single person.2 To sum up: it appears that in the sphere of the foundation system there was also a marked tendency to develop a fairly uniform type of landholding, of a kind that we have already seen in the tiyiil and the suyurghal. The growth of the crown foundations and the creation of the office of sadr-i khassa may be an indication that the Safavid central power was adjusting its policy, even with regard to the foundation system, so as to restrict the influence of these landlords. Finally we have to consider the category of crown lands. The existence of estates of which the income was directly at the disposal of the court and especially the sovereign was not in itself anything new. As far back as the Il-Khanid period extensive areas, including whole towns, had been converted into crown property, and for these the

Mongol term injii or the Arabo-Persian (amlak-i) khassa was used. After the collapse of the Il-Khanid empire there was a marked decrease in the extent of khassa land. The weakening of the central power in all regions of the former empire led to the conversion of large parts of earlier crown land into dlvanl or mulk land. It is clear, however, that even the post-Mongol dynasties had control of areas whose tax revenues were at the disposal of the sovereign and his nearest relatives and also the court. We cannot take the formal distinction between crown land and state land to imply any opposition between the court and the state administration. In the 9th/15th and ioth/i6th centuries crown estates were characterised by the fact that (at least in theory) sovereignty over them was not assigned to influential personages in the form of suyurghals or large tiyuls, as was the case with dlvanl land. They therefore not only served to finance the sovereign's personal expenditure but also formed a counterpoise against those tendencies towards feudal splintering of the land that we have seen with other categories of land. From this it is apparent that the strengthening of the monarchy and the central power under the Safavids was accompanied by growth in the size and importance of crown estates. Strictly speaking, even before 'Abbas I the crown estates were not free from "fiefs" of various kinds. However, the holders of these "fiefs" were very close relatives of the sovereign, and this was in complete accordance with the traditional character of the crown estates. These had become very substantial in the ioth/i6th century; they included a number of more or less centrally situated provinces and formed a contrast to the governorships that had been bestowed as tiyul, for example on the Qizilbash leaders. Such provinces which were entirely crown property were called khassa. Smaller crown estates, situated within other governorships, at that time generally bore the name of khdlisdt (literally "free", i.e. from interference by the governor); these crown estates must not be confused with the 8 th/14th century institutions that were also called khalisat (see above). The sweeping internal reforms of 'Abbas I (centralisation, repression of the Qizilbash, establishment of the ghuldmdn-i khass) and the increasing requirements of the court were among the causes of accelerating growth of crown estates under this ruler. This extension occurred in various ways. For example, a complaint from the inhabitants of a village near Natanz about the arbitrary attitude of the tax officials

served the shah as a pretext for incorporating the whole district of
Natanz into the crown lands.1 Sometimes too the shah bought up private mulk estates: when this happened, the persons affected - as we have already mentioned - had to put up with a low price. Often the possessions or "fiefs" of dignitaries who had fallen into disgrace (for example Qizilbash leaders) were confiscated for the crown estates. In the end Isfahan, Kashan, parts of Kirman and Yazd, Qazvln, Qum, GHan and Mazandaran all belonged to the sovereign's domains. The political aim of the extension of crown property was above all to break the power of the Qizilbash leaders, who ever since the beginnings of Safavid rule had been holding the governorships as tiyul. As soon as a province was turned into khassa it also became free of Qizilbash troops as there was no longer any governor. This policy was continued under Shah Safi and 'Abbas II. Safl's vizier, Saru TaqI, was one of its most important proponents, and it was he who instigated the incorporation of Fars into the crown lands. The crown estates attained their greatest extent under 'Abbas II, but decreased again thereafter, as the threat of war once more necessitated the appointment of (Qizilbash) governors and these were naturally expected to raise troops. A special administrative machinery for the crown estates had been built up and developed since the time of 'Abbas I. Viziers were put at the head of the khassa provinces. The various administrative affairs came gradually within the competence of the crown land administra
tion {sarkar-i khdssa-ji sbartfa).2 As we have noticed above, there had been a sadr for the crown estates since the time of 'Abbas I, and now in addition a chancellery for the administration of crown property was established, with standing equivalent to that of the state chancellery. In the crown estates the Qizilbash were replaced by the troops of the ghulaman-i khass. The maintenance and payment of these forces made it necessary to depart from the previous practice of paying court and crown servants in cash. From 1026—7/1617—8 onwards the payment of all persons in the service of the domains administration was effected in the usual manner: officials and troops received tiyuls in the same way as others of their kind, or else barat (hama-sala and other
mavajib assignments) from the tax revenues of crown estates.3 In the

late Safavid period the "fiefs and appanages" part of the crown property grew to such an extent that it seemed advisable to bring together, as a new organisational group, the remaining crown estates from which neither tiyuls were assigned nor salaries allocated; the term khalisa found further employment as the name for this type of crown land. It is indisputable that 'Abbas I and his successors, by their policy of extending the crown estates, achieved their object of a political and economic weakening of the Qizilbash tribes and their leaders. They were unable, nevertheless, to prevent the crown land from immediately developing forms of ownership similar to those that had existed previously in the other areas. In the end it made hardly any difference to the simple peasants whether their landlord was a tiyuldar on state or crown land. Moreover their situation was scarcely affected by the question whether their landlord exercised his absolute authority over them by reason of a tiyiil, a suyurghal, or an appointment as mutavalli. The peasants were perhaps more oppressed on the khalisa estates, where they were the victims of arbitrary treatment by the tax officials, than on tiyiil land or in areas that were used as beneficia for certain officials and dignitaries.
THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE CITIES: COMMERCE AND TRADE
In the Saljuq period Iranian foreign trade still extended far beyond the frontiers of the Islamic world. The Mongol conquest dealt a severe blow to this trade; nonetheless at the beginning of the 8th/14th century the big trading cities of Iran again appear as commercial links between east and west. This astonishingly rapid regeneration may well be connected with the fact that under the rule of the Chingizids Iran was brought politically closer to the countries of Central and Eastern Asia and, in consequence, served as a gateway to Europe for the traders of the entire Mongol empire — and vice versa. Moreover, as a result of the downfall of the 'Abbasid Caliphate, Iran's commercial activities had found a new focus: it is true that Baghdad continued to be an economically important city, but in the 8th/14th century Tabriz, the seat of the Tl-Khans, had taken precedence over all other cities in Iran. The ravages of the Mongol invasion, which had set other cities far back from their former stage of development, had long since been repaired

in Tabriz. In spite of the rapid reconstruction of the basic structures of Iranian economic life, however, the economic flowering which had been a characteristic of every large city in the land in the pre-Mongol period could not be achieved again. At this point we should recall how enormously important for oriental foreign trade in all ages was the maintenance of the trade-routes. Commercial development depended in a high degree upon the quality and safety of the roads, the density of the communications network, the number of well appointed halting-places, watering-places, bridges, etc. The degree of development enjoyed by the cities was related ultimately to these factors also. For the city was above all a place of trade and exchange; its economic heart had always been the bazaars, the store-houses, the counting-houses; it was a vital necessity for the city to be attached to a supra-regional communications-network. From this point of view the existence of well-organised, centralised states with the widest possible area of dominion was highly advantageous to the intensification of Iranian internal trade. The administrative organs of such a state-structure were much better able than an often shortlived, unstable local polity would have been to guarantee the quality, safety, and numerical sufficiency of the elements required by the economic infrastructure. For this very reason even trivial political changes frequently exercised an effect upon commercial life. We have already referred to the importance of Tabriz under the Mongols. From this city the main trade route led diagonally across northern Iran to the east, following the traditional silk-route, through Khurasan to Samarqand and eventually to China. Commercial traffic from the interior of the Iranian highlands and from the south did not lead directly into Tabriz, but through several entrepots lying along this west — east route: Sultaniyya, Qazvln, Ray and NIshapur. As Sultaniyya had become the seat of .the Tl-Khans, it overshadowed the other centres. Since the supersession of the port of Slraf on the Persian Gulf by Hurmuz, through which the whole sea traffic between India and the Levant immediately began to flow, the traderoute between Sultaniyya and Hurmuz not only represented the north - south axis of internal Iranian trade, but made Iran the point of intersection of all existing trade links by land and sea between Europe and Asia in the 8th/14th century. The collapse of the Il-Khanid empire ushered in a gradual decline in the importance of Iran in the passage of trade between Europe and the Far East. The interest of the
525



SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Timurids was directed more at promoting theeastern Iranian trade centres such as Samarqand and Herat than at developing Iran's traditional position as theprime link in thechain of east-west trade.As a result of the opening up of the sea route to India round the southern cape of Africa, the importance of Iran for world trade rapidly declined, and constant military confrontations between the Timurids and theTurkmen states in the west, and the labile internal conditions of all these states created obstacles in the way of politicoeconomic concepts and considerations on a grand, supra-regional scale. When at last the country was consolidated under the Safavids, and the internal preconditions for the commercial recuperation of Iran were restored, it was already too late: world trade was now running along new tracks. As a result of the increasing importance of European commercial shipping in inter-continental trade, Iran found itself pushed onto the fringe ofthe world economic scene. It couldno longer pride itself on playing anactive part in world transit trade.To the European commercial powers Iran remained of interest chiefly on account of its products and raw materials. The economic flowering of Isfahan in the nth/17th century is to be traced chiefly to this city's pre-eminence in internal trade. The capital of the Safavid period cannot, therefore, becompared with Tabriz of the Mongol period, when it was a centre forinternational commerce. A special mark of the merchant class, from the 8th/i4th century onwards, was their close association with thegreat landowners. We have already mentioned the fact that the incumbents ofsuyurghals, the usufructuaries of vaqf land (mutavallls, etc.) and the owners of mulk land preferred, unlike their antecedents in the early Islamic period, to live faraway from their lands in the cities, where they were numbered amongst the most prominent citizens. Their large incomes enabled them to take part in a variety of commercial enterprises; they did this partly through capital investment, and partly by consigning large quantities ofagricultural products tomerchant-princes inexchange for a share in their profits. The preconditions for this were present, for ever since the Mongol domination the dues of the ra'aya had increasingly come tobe paid inkind. For their part the landowners invested a great deal of the wealth that they did not require fortheir own usein commercial enterprises. Even the rulers didnot hesitate at times to invest considerable sums outof the privy purse in thebusinesses of commercial magnates. That this phenomenon is characteristic of the
526



CITIES: COMMERCE AND TRADE
big business of that time can be seen from the name given to the
merchant-prince, urtaq (Turkish ortaq,"partner", "shareholder").1 In the i ith/iyth century foreign trade experienced a sharp increase in the volume of government commissions: the monopolisation by the crown of the silk trade, as well as of the production of precious stones and of other branches of industry, created the preconditions for this
increase.2 Under 'Abbas I there was a tremendous opening up of caravan routes and the provision everywhere of installations (inns, etc.) to serve the needs of commercial traffic. One of the most spectacular of these installations was the so-called sang-farsh, about 30 kilometres of paved roadway with several bridges across a swampy salt desert between
Ardistan and FIruzkuh.3 At a single stroke this road-system, built in a very short time, made Isfahan the centre of Iranian internal trade. As a result of these measures the whole commerce of the country naturally experienced an upsurge, but these efforts to extend and improve the communications network in Iran must also be assessed in terms of the commercial interests of the shah. At that time he was probably the biggest merchant-prince in the land; in the course of the nth/17th century, under imperial protection, Armenians and European companies became the carriers of almost the entire export. Evidently the native merchants could only partially adapt to the mercantile requirements of the times and concentrated more on home markets, although even in the late nth/17th century individual merchants were still keeping up com
mercial contacts with distant countries.4 In the centuries now under discussion, commerce in Iran was conducted solely in cash, with the clumsiness that this entailed. Money was packed in leather sacks in lots of 50 (silver) tumans and transported in the merchant caravans. The beginnings of non-cash transactions, which had evolved in the pre-Mongol period, seem to have been forgotten. In the second half of the nth/17th century the Iranian commercial system made a rather poor impression on several European travellers. At that time the road network was becoming increasingly neglected, and the tradition-bound merchants of Iran were indeed

becoming less and less fit to stand up to theconstantly increasing
rivalry ofEuropean world trade.1 And yet the native merchants were well-off. Every year they madea profit of 30-40% on their business capital. In thewarehouse of a merchant of Isfahan were found, during the Afghan siege of 1135/1722, silver coins worth 1,792 tumans (on the value of the tiiman see below.) This gives us some idea of the size of cash hoard a
merchant-prince could command.2 Under the later Safavids export concentrated on the same products as those for which Iran had already become famous in the Mongol period: fabrics of all kinds, brocades, camel-hair, tobacco, precious stones, and, above all,silk; while during the Safavid eraalso the
export of carpets steadily rose.3 By contrast the supply of precious metals seems to have been more or less exhausted in this period.At no time, however, did the export ofsilver, mostly incoin and principally to India, ever cease. Those chiefly responsible for this export were the usurious Indian money-changers and money-lenders, whoin the nth/17th century plied their trade in every important centre of commerce. In Isfahan alone there are supposed to have been 10,000 of them. Their profit margin was allegedly much greater than
that of the native merchants.4 Atallevents they contributed to the universal shortage ofmoney, which was aggravated also by the financial policy ofthe court, for in the later Safavid state cash payment was avoided and asmuch coin aspossible hoarded in the treasury of the
ruler.5 Inter-city trade was profitable only forcommercial magnates with large capital, who were in aposition to deal in costly luxury goods, and had the necessary trade connections and possibly also their own special organisations. The small merchant, who did not have these means, was basically restricted to trading in utility goods, chiefly in the produce from the countryside around his own city. High domestic tolls prevented him from undertaking lengthy overland transport: becauseof

the variations in maximum prices from place to place, it was questionable whether he would make a profit. Artisans, small merchants and other tradesmen — people who offered any kind of service — were organised in guilds (sinf, pi. asndf). Everything Petrushevsky has said in the previous volume about these
guilds in the 8th/14th century applies to the following period.1 We do, however, have some additional information about these organisations as they existed under the Safavids. From the ranks of the "masters" (ustad) they elected representatives (kadkhuda, a term applied also to the head of a city-district), who in turn had to be accredited by an official called a naqib (presumably the head of the sayyids of the city). Only then could the representative be officially installed by the kalantar.The kalantar was an official with functions similar to those of a western European mayor; but he was appointed by the central government and normally belonged to the aristocracy of his city. The office was often hereditary, and in the 8th/14th century the kalantar still bore the title ra'fs. This great interest of the government in the guilds can best be explained by the part they played in the assessment of taxes on profits and of corvees (cf. below, the discussion of the tax-system). In other respects the competence of the heads of the guilds was rather limited. No one was permitted to open a new shop without their permission; and in addition it was their duty to present the monthly schedules for fixing the maximum prices to the sdhib-nasaq, an official whose principal concern was with price control and related problems. This official was responsible to the muhtasib al-mamalik ("overseer of market and morals for the whole realm"), who was represented in each city by thenayib (literally "deputy"). Final decisions were made within the framework of this authority, so that the elders of the guilds exerted only an indirect influence on the price structure. Within the first three months of the tax-year the members of the guilds (most likely only the masters) assembled at the offices of the naqib or before the kalantar in order to
discuss the apportionment of the prescribed dues.2 There is no mention of any other "guild meetings". Chardin reports categorically that they
never took place.3 For the rest, the guilds were very loosely organised, but they did attend to the mutual support of their members, if these should become needy, and provided a not very binding instrument to

represent the members' interests. All in all, their influence onsociety was slight. Only in avery restricted sense might we speak of communal self-government inthe western European sense. In the large cities every conceivable trade was to be found. Du Mans
lists 35 different craft guilds in Isfahan in 1660.1 Tothese must be added theservice-trades —victual-dealers, bakers, cooks - and also such people as dancers, jugglers, beggars, dervishes and sayyids, all of whom belonged toguilds. This multiplicity of trades was not a special feature of the Safavid period: -a government manual from the second half of the 8th/14th century lists a similar number of taxable trade
associations in Tabriz.2 In medium-sized and small cities one often found a certain concentration ofparticular trades. InYazd, forexample, the manufacture of costly textiles predominated, while Kashan was famous for its ceramics and, increasingly, for its carpets. Similar examples can be adduced for almost every city in the country. Those engaged in commerce plied their trades chiefly in the great bazaars of the cities. The bazaar was often the property of the divan or
of the crown, andin many cases bazaars were endowments.3 The tradesmen then had to pay rents for their shops, which served also as workshops. This applied also to the city's cattle-markets, slavemarkets, storehouses, caravansarais, bridges and baths, the rents from which provided an important source of income for the public treasury, the crown, orthe vaqf administration. The central area ofthe bazaars in the large cities — the qaisariyya — was always crown property. The traders who exposed there for sale the choicest and costliest wares (e.g. expensive fabrics, jewels, luxury imports from distant lands) had to
pay considerable sums of money for the privilege.4 At this point a particular form of bazaar must bementioned. The royal headquarters sometimes moved from one place toanother. This happened fora variety ofreasons; e.g. war, orthe search forclimatically favourable summer- or winter-quarters. This habit was indulged especially by the Jalayirid, the Timurid, and the Turkmen rulers. On these occasions the whole court, led bythe ruler, would forsake the capital city andtake off for another, often far distant, part of the country where amid great pomp and ceremony a royal court encampment would be setup. The considerable needs of this encampment

were supplied by an army of scurrying tradesmen who on such occasions often came long distances to take advantage of this urdu-bdv^dr (i.e. "market of the court and army camp"). On the camp being struck, the provisional bazaar likewise was dissolved. This institution of the Tl-Khans was still common under the Aq Quyunlu, and provided the merchants with an enormous turn-over. Not until the time of the Safavids did the urdu-bazar lose its importance. This market, too, was regarded as a crown institution, and the revenues from it were considerable. Besides such institutions there were also industries, the income from which went to the public treasury, to the crown, or to the vaqf administration. The origin of these industries may be connected with the captive and enslaved workers who were set to work at various crafts in the palaces of the Tl-Khans and, at a later date, of Tlmur and even of his successors. At all events, from the 8th/14th century onwards such industries were to be found in many cities. The main industries of this sort were: tanning, pickling and preserving, soap-manufacture, papermaking, dyeing. The mints, too, must be listed among these "state" industries. The income from the mint, which came chiefly from mintage, that is the difference between the real and the nominal value of the
coin, flowed constantly into the royal treasury.1 There was one special form of industry that mainly emerged in the Safavid empire: the buyiitdt (literally "houses") or "royal workshops". These court workshops and court industries of the Safavids were sited inside the royal palace grounds. Their function was chiefly the preparation of every imaginable product that the court might need. The buyiitat comprised, firstly, departments connected in any way whatever with the supply of victuals for the court. Near the court kitchen were the food warehouse, the bakery, storerooms for drinking water and fruit juices, the wine-cellar, slaughterhouse, the coffee-kitchen, the pharmacy and the rest. Then there were storehouses and rooms of various kinds for firewood, torches and lamps, for tablecloths, plates and crockery, for carpets and robes of honour. The royal treasury, too, must be listed here. All the departments which employed manual labour for the provision of the needs of the court household were court workshops in the true sense. Thus the court controlled its own looms,

its own tailoring, shoemaking, and fur and leather industry. There was a goldsmith's workshop and acopper smithy, which supplied the court with all manner of tools andutensils; andthere were many other departments as well. Finally, mention must bemade of the harnessmaker's workshop, the armoury, the ordnance-foundry, and the library in which manuscripts were not only collected but specially produced by a staff of artists. The stables and many other offices were also part of
the buyutat.J As a rule there was adirector {sahib-jam') and a controller {mushrif) over each department. This rule was broken, however, where, for operational reasons, several departments worked closely together and were therefore from time to time put under a single sahib-jam' or a single mushrif. In the late Safavid period the buyutat were entirely under the direction of the na%ir-i buyutat ("overseer of the court workshops"). This had not always been so: at the beginning of the i ith/i7th century the nazir-i buyutat had controlled only certain specific court industries and workshops. Later, however, he was de facto in charge of the, whole royal household and was reckoned to beone of the most powerful and influential ministers ofstate. Countless workmen and specialists with a variety of professional skills were employed inthe court industries. In contrast to their colleagues in the bazaars they enjoyed a number ofprivileges. Each employee was given a deed ofappointment which indicated precisely the manner ofhis work and his rate ofpay. Inthe late Safavid period the annual wage ofa workman ranged from two tumans tothe considerable sum of 5 5 tumans. This was paid in theform of barat — the assignment ofcertain tax returns. One ofthe employees was commissioned to cash these tax-cheques on the spot, so that in fact most employees got a cash payment, although forfeiting in the process 5 — 10% of the wage stated intheir deed ofappointment. Every third year an employee at a court workshop could count on receiving a wage-increase. In addition hehad the right to specific allowances in kind (Jtra). Emoluments in kind were calculated in terms of a unit known as the qab ("dish"). Six orseven persons were supposed tobe able to find subsistence from the food contained in one qab. Highly paid workmen received awhole qab, others only half or aquarter. On request one could have the jira commuted into cash. As well as these

THE POST-MONGOL TAX SYSTEM
regular wages the employees at thebuyutat received premiums or "gifts" {in'am), often amounting to asmuch asa year's wages. This occurred principally when a workman had distinguished himself by
specially good work.1 An appointment in the buyutat was normally forlife. Incaseof illness or unfitness for work the salary continued to be paid. Moreover, it also happened that many of the workmen worked not only by royal commission, but on their own account as well. All of these facts show that apost in court industry at acourt workshop was in many respects a privileged post, and must have been much sought after. In conclusion let us mention the activities of European workmen in the buyutat. Under 'Abbas I, SafI I and 'Abbas IIa series ofpainters worked at the court at Isfahan. There are several reports of watchmakers, but it is notclear whether these were always attached to the buyutat. Several European specialists were employed in the ordnancefoundry atcourt, and itispossible that their number increased under Shah Sultan Husain (1105—35/1694—1722), for at this time the produc
tion of artillery was being stepped up.2
THE TAX SYSTEM IN THE POST-MONGOL PERIOD
During the centuries of the 'Abbasid Caliphate ithad been customary to observe, formally at least, the tax regulations prescribed by the Shari'a, even if the four canonical taxes - kharaj (tax on land and agricultural products), 'ushr (tithe), %akat (alms-tax) andJii(ya (capitation tax for non-Muslims) - covered the most heterogeneous institutions, and the rate of taxation differed greatly from place to place and from time to time, and special impositions had often assumedthe character of regular taxes. InIran this principle was overthrown during the first decades ofIl-Khanid rule: the qubchur tax took its place alongside the canonical kharaj and quickly proved to bethemost
oppressive taxation ever imposed upon the settled population.3 In the Il-Khanid period the term qubchur - originally a pasture-tax on the Mongol nomad herdsmen —denoted various types oftax. For the arable farming community the qubchur was alevy assessed according to the quantity ofthe product, and had to be paid incash. Inmany

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
districts the qubchur was a fairly uniform fixed tax on all subjects and
thus acapitation levy on Muslims too.1 Cattle-breeders also were liable for qubchur dues, which again had to be paid in cash, not in cattle, ashad originally been the custom with the Mongols. The zakat was superseded by the tamgha, introduced by the Tl-Khans. This was a set oftaxes on trade and industry, the combined rate of which was several times greater than the 2V2 % of the canonical alms-tax. In addition, the Il-Khanid regime imposed agreat number of oppressive special burdens upon the population of Iran, most of all upon the settled community. The exaction of taxes by the administrators of the Il-Khanid state had been brutal and capricious and had threatened the life of great sections of the Iranian peasantry. When reform came under Ghazan Khan (694-703/12951304), there was not by any means a return to the norms laid down in the Sharl'a. Such a course would have deprived the rulers of a substantial part oftheir income. What took place was, rather, the systematisation and codification of the practices that had been in operation since the middle of the 7th/13th century. On the basis of this reform the canonical taxes continued for the time being, but income for the public treasury was assured by the cataloguing of a wide range of additional dues. This seems nonetheless to have been to theadvantage of the populace, because the fixing of the rate of taxation put astop in some measureto the often immoderate demands of the tax-collectors. The co-existence of canonical taxes and of levies that werenot consistent with the Sharl'a, plus many special burdens - some of which admittedly had been customary even before the Mongol conquestof the Near East - isplainly characteristic ofthe post-Mongol period as well. Asearly as the8th/14th century there appeared tendencies to obliterate the distinction between canonical and non-canonical taxes. Attempts to put a stop tothis development were made repeatedly,as for example under the Timurid Shah Rukh (811-5 0/1409-47), under the Aq Quyunlu rulers Ya'qub (883-96/1478-90) and Ahmad (902—3/1497), and also under Shah Tahmasp (930-984/1524-1576). Such intentions seem also to have played some part, albeit a limited
one, inthe tax reform of Uzun Hasan (857—82/1453—78).2 The assimi

THE POST-MONGOL TAX SYSTEM
lation of non-canonical and canonical taxes was finally accomplished, it would seem, inthe nth/17th century, presumably under 'Abbas I. His fiscal measures came at the end of a continuous series of tax reforms. They were preceded by the codification and the regulation of the financial system during thesecond half of the 8th/14th century (the Jalayirid period) and by the creation ofthe Qaniin-i(or Qaniin-ndma-yi) Hasan Padishah, the tax book ofUzun Hasan Aq Quyunlii. Common to all of these reforms is that, as we observed about the tax laws of Ghazan Khan, they have to doonly in part with the introduction of totally new measures; for the rest they are concerned with the collating of detailed arrangements and ofusages that had come into existenceat an earlier stage. Thus, forexample, the returns contained inthe Qdniin of Uzun Hasan concerning eastern Anatolia — so important for our consideration —show tremendous variation from place to place, in respect both ofthe type oftax and ofthe rate oftaxation. The reason for this canbe traced to the fact that over a long period of time accepted local traditions had found their way into Hasan's code. And so, such returns as these give us some idea also of fiscal conditions before the codification of the Qdniin.^ And there are some other sources which provide data concerning the tax system. As weexplained in another context, records of tax exemptions always provide valuable evidence, for, in the form of tax lists, they indicate to which typeof levy the exemption inquestion applied. On this subject the number of extant documents from the Safavid period is much greater than the number from the 9th/15 th century or even earlier. Manuals of administration often supply valuable information on this score, and data of this kind inthe records can be augmented from many reports by European travellers. We shall initially follow the development down the centuries of the most important regular taxes, and then discuss irregular special impositions. The first thing to note isthat soon after the collapse of the Il-Khanid state the terms kharaj and zakat occur less frequently in the sources. This applies also to the Mongol expression qubchur, presumably because in the popular mind this conjured up memories of the worst kind of fiscal exploitation. From the second half of the 8th/14th century onwards, in place of these terms we find mal and jihdt, and from the 9th/15 th century onwards they are linked to form mdl-u-jihdt. Bothof

these expressions possessed a comprehensive connotation: milembraced the totality ofthe regular taxes that were payable inkind (that is, chiefly levies on agricultural products), whereas jihat were indirect
taxes to bepaid in cash.1 Amongst these were obviously the regular commercial taxes, but there were also the cattle levies, to be paid in cash (cf. below) and the taxation ofland, inwhich certain elements of the traditional misaha regulations for the kharaj survived. In documents from the9th/15 th century onwards we find mal-u-jihat along with vujuhat (money-taxes of the most varied kinds, presumably mainly dues to officials) set in contrast to the takalif-i dlvdni(special dues forthe state household) and other extraordinary payments. Inthe manualsof administration, too, we meet this term mal-u-jihat, but here, as we might expect, we find rather the specification of the separate classes of levy which made up the totality of the taxes. From this we are ableto deduce that mdl-u-jihatva vujuhat quite simply denoted all regularly collected taxes. Itis clear that mal-u-jihat in predominantly agricultural regions denoted chiefly taxes upon land and itsproduce, whereas in
urban contexts it denoted chiefly taxes upon trade and industry.2 The rate of taxation of farm produce varied considerably from place to place and from time to time. Whereas under the Mongols after the reforms of Ghazan Khan the tithe had to be paid in kind, plus an additional high tax on produce incash (one ofthe so-called qubchur taxes), with the Jalayirids the tendency developed of shifting these cash qubchur payments (tax on produce and the poll tax introduced by the Tl-Khans) into the field of extraordinary taxation. This apparent easing of the burden of the tax on produce promptly made possible the collection of a larger proportion in kind asharvest tax. Under Uzun Hasan in most localities the tithe was replaced by the "fifth" (khums, panj-yafc), and in many regions of Transcaucasia the harvest tax claimed as much asthree-tenths of the whole harvest. In view of this severe oppression of the peasants it isscarcely conceivable that Uzun Hasan's regulations found a favourable reception. About a hundred years later in most districts the khums, orslightly less, was still inforce. According to d'Alessandri, towards the end of the reign of Tahmasp I
(930—84/15 24—76) only one-sixth of the harvest was claimed.3 Chardin reports of the nth/17th century, however, that oncrown estates the

tax on produce accounted for one-third of the entire yield. In the region around Isfahan at the beginning of the 12th/18th century a
quarter of the harvest (chahdr-yak) was claimed.1 These levies applied primarily to grain. Orchards and vegetable gardens were taxed onthe basis ofa tithe or a seventh part ofthe annual yield. In the 8th/14th, and in the first half of the 9th/15 th, century vineyards were often subject to the khums, but under Uzun Hasan this levy was commuted into cash (in eastern Anatolia every hundred vines were assessed at the
flat rate ofabout two Ottoman aqchas).2 This may well indicate that at that time the greater part of the grape harvest was pressed, so that there was no point inclaiming a levy onthe fruit. The sale ofthe wine was subject tovarious commercial taxes, sothat it paid the public treasury on the one hand toput a flat rate on the vineyards, and on the other to encourage wine production to the limit. This tax, known as ra^kdrf, was in operation throughout thewhole period under review, as one
document from the year 1094/168 3 demonstrates.3 Another mal tax in kind consisted inthe supplying ofhay, chaff, or firewood. According tothe regulations ofUzun Hasan the tenant of a juft was liable to supply from one to four kharvdrs(ass-load, cf. Hinz, Masseu. Gewichte, p. 14) of the materials indicated. All of these dues became payable atharvest, except the firewood, which had tobe delivered in late autumn. The fixing of the precise quantities and sums to be given was the responsibility ofthe mumayyi^ or rayya',* the assessorof the harvest, whose underlings performed this task a short time before the harvest. In order to protect himself from too high an assessment, the peasant had to pay the rayya' and his staff both an assessment-due (introduced inthe Aq Quyunlii period) and also the so-called taqabbuIdt. These dues became payable "when a tax-payer agrees tothe assess
ment fixed by the revenue-officer."5 Evidently this was a case oflegalised bribery. Not without some amazement do we find the taqabbulat, in an administrative manual of the early 18 th century, among the regu
lar state revenues.6 In this category must certainly be included the land tax collected in various regions — therasm-i juft. Under Uzun Hasan therasm-i juft
passed in some districts asbeing consistent with the "old law".7 Here

we are dealing with a tax payable in cash and, under Uzun Hasan, varying in rate from district to district (and dhimmls were further assessed at ahigher rate than Muslims). D'Alessandri finds, evidence for the existence of this tax in the late ioth/i6th century, and Kaempfer
puts the rate at five 'abbasis per jarib for the reign of Shah Sulaiman.1 From Kaempfer and from Chardin we learn also that in the second half of the 17th century this category of payment included acontributionto the bdrkhdna-ji Shah ("royal goods-caravan"), claiming the choicest produce ofthe various regions. The yield from both taxes flowed into the coffers of the rulers. That these two interchangeable taxes represented alater form of the rasm-i juft can be seen from the fact that they were expressly catalogued among the regular taxes. The same dichotomy in basic taxation can be observed inthe realm of cattle-rearing, down to the second half of the ioth/i6th century. By a decree ofYa'qub Aq Quyunlu dated 15 Ramadan 884/30 November
1479 t n e addressee of the document was exempted from payingthe
taxes of mavashl (cattle-tax) and marcti (pasture-tax).2 In the tax-regulations of Uzun Hasan both types of tax are mentioned. Let us first examine the cattle-tax. After the end of the Il-Khanid state it continued to be known for some time as qubchiir-i rasmi or qubchur-i aghndm, expressions going back to the reforms of Ghazan Khan and current down to the Timurid period. In the Qdniin-iHasan Padishah wefindthe
above form mavashl.3 In eastern Iran in 15 00 there existed a tax called
pay-i gdvdna,which clearly was identical with this cattle-tax.4 Under Shah Tahmasp, who was renowned for his piety, this undoubtedly non-canonical exaction was camouflaged in the colours ofthe Shari'a, by being interpreted asone form of the alms-tax and named%akdt-i gusfandva mavashl. Obviously, however, even this formal re-interpretation was notsufficient to calm the conscience of the sanctimonious
Tahmasp, for in 972/1565 he had ittotally annulled as being unlawful.5 From the time of 'Abbas I onwards the cattle-tax, nowcalled chupdn-blgl, once again took its place as a fixed element in the malu-jihat and remained so until the 18th century. Under Uzun Hasan in many districts the mavashl tax consisted of

two levies: one was a cash payment offrom 2A to one aqcha foreach wether-sheep or goat (in Anatolia), to which was added a herd-tax in kind - astated number of livestock incurred, in varying amounts, fixed levies, for example one beast per year for every three hundred sheep. In addition female stall-cattle were taxed in cash: mares, cows, and asses
incurred a tax of from 2 to 4 V2aqchas per beast.1 There are records from the reign of Tahmasp of tax rates of 15 btsti for every forty sheep
(excluding tups) and 10 for each bullock.2 Obviously these rates were in force before the above-mentioned cancellation of the cattle-tax in1565. Under 'Abbas I, in theprovince of Khurasan alone, the chupan-blgl yielded annually the sum ofabout 20,000 'Iraqi tumans, and this shows
that here, too, we are dealing with a tax that had to be paid in cash.3 Of the late 17th century Chardin reports, however, that the chupan-blgl for sheep had tobe paid inkind: one-seventh ofthe lambs and the whole yield of fleeces. Foals were assessed atone-third of their fictive price (supposedly fairly assessed) incash. In any case, in this period the ruler was the direct
beneficiary of the income from the chupan-blgl.4 The pasture-tax, too, can be traced back to the period of Mongol rule in Iran, and is explicitly mentioned in the Qanun ofUzun Hasan. Later on it frequently became merged with the categories of cattle-tax listed, but we have evidence that in the time ofTahmasp I it was still
separate.5 Regular taxation of urban commercial activity primarily affected trade and crafts - the latter at first only slightly. Of course the agricultural activity of individual city-dwellers is not in question here: in terms of the total tax yield from the cities revenues from this source
were ofno great importance.6 The most important of the levies imposed upon trade were the customs and sales taxes. From the time ofGhazan Khan these are tobe reckoned as themost important regular revenues of the public treasury. Craft and industry were obviously liable totaxation on sales, but in addition at certain periods shops and workshops were taxable also. Most of these tariffs and taxes go back to the era of the Tl-Khans, andin no way harmonised with the precepts ofthe religious law. First, let us

take up a terminological problem. From the 8th/i4th tothe ioth/i6th century all the taxes on trade and industry were described by the term "tamgha". There isdocumentary evidence that this originally Turkish word (primary meaning "herd-brand"; hence later "seal" or "stamp") had been applied to specific taxes inIran since the late 7th/13th century. In every period the term was applied fundamentally totaxes that were raised on merchants and craftsmen and paid principally in cash. In the course of time theoccasional payment in kind does, however, figure in the complex oftamgha taxes. We do not know exactly how the term tamgha came to be used inthe fiscal realm. It ispossible that the earliest tamgha dues were the customs dues paid by merchants on entry into acity, on all the goods they intended to sell in that city. This view is supported by an early 8th/14th century tradition, according to which, by order ofthe supreme authority, the tamgha dues ofvarious cities had to be displayed in writing on the city gates, so that "the receivers ofcustoms ...should not, under pretext of ...(an increasein the tamgha) .. .collect more (than was prescribed) nor introduce any
innovations".1 On theother hand Naslr al-Dln TusI was already describingthe
tamgha asa kind oftax on sales.2 Inany case, towards the end ofthe Il-Khanid period, the term tamgha already possessed the character of a comprehensive concept covering all levies, often including extraordinary taxes, affecting trade and industry in the cities. The above-mentioned city customs dues, often designated by the word bdj, were part of this concept, as were also taxes on sales and profits. As none of these levies had anything to do with the tax prescriptions of Islamic religious law, the word tamgha, more often in itsArabicised plural tamghavdt, was frequently used quite simply to denote all taxes that were contrary
to the Shari'a.3 Hence thechampions of the Islamic faith (arbab-i 'ama'im) atall times fought for the abrogation of the tamgha, and this cause was taken up even by some of the rulers - either out of personal piety or from political considerations. But with all such "reforms" it was always a case of trying to resolve thecontradiction that arose between religious ends and those forms oftaxation which yielded the highest returns to the public purse and which the state economy simply

THE POST-MONGOL TAX SYSTEM
could not do without. For this reason the success ofevery attempt to do away with the tamgha was very shortlived. The taxes and extraordinary dues embodied under this concept had to beforthwith reintroduced inanother guise. From the reign of Shah Rukh we learn about an even simpler solution. In order to satisfy the requirements of reli
gion the term tamgha was simply replaced by the word zakat.1 InIndia Babur andhis successors frequently dispensed with the tamgha, a
measure which must have produced almost no effect at all.2 The most spectacular abrogation ofthe tamgha occurred in972/1565 in connexion with a dream of the Safavid Tahmasp. The story runs that this shah, notorious for his avarice, saw inavision the Twelfth Imam, who commanded the sovereign to repeal the taxes, including the tamgha,
that were contrary to the faith.3 Naturally, these taxes disappeared from public life only fora short time. Atall events there is evidence that from this time onwards the fiscal term tamgha was used less and less. In the 17th century thetamgha taxes did continue in various forms, but there seemed no longer tobe any point inembracing them all together under the concept oftamgha. The sales taxes which appeared under the Mongols were levied under the Jalayirids mostly atthe rate of about 2 V2 % - less than under the Tl-Khans. Shah Rukh's zakat sales tax still ran at 2Vi% in 1440, but in Uzun Hasan's Qanun it was fixed at 5 %. Moreover, with the codification of the Qaniin efforts to abrogate the tamgha seem to have been effective, although the agents of this abrogation were unable tocarry it
out in face of the opposition encountered from the amirs.4 The rate went up under the Safavids (until Tahmasp). For Christians it wasas high as 10%. Particularly valuable goods such as pearls, jewels and musk were assessed atspecial low rates. Sales taxes, as we have pointed out, were normally collected incash. In several places, however, the tax ona few goods had to be paid in kind. Under Uzun Hasan wine was exempted from the sales tax but became liable to city customs dues and special tariffs, which did not, however, touch wine pressed inside the cities. Likewise possessing a special character was the sales tax oncattle, which in some places was

fixed at4—5 % of the selling price, in other places ata fixed sum (e.g. in Arzinjan at 10 aqchas for one ass). Inorder to distinguish the sales tax clearly from other tamgha taxes, under Uzun Hasan they were given
the title tamgha-ji siydh ("black tamgha").1 During the 17th century the sales tax declined somewhat in importance beside the great number ofother taxes ontrade and crafts. It is possible that they were exacted only in respect of specific goods. In this period certainly, they were calculated not as a percentage but on a flat rate. Olearius reported that in 1637 one paid one 'abbasi to sell a horse,
one muhammadi &n ass, and one qa^baktz sheep.2 Silk, too, was liable to some such sales tax. This decline of the market tax under the later Safavids was certainly connected with the simultaneous restructuring of the financial administration, which we have still todiscuss. Because in Iran one could have the beasts one had bought (bullocks, sheep, lambs) slaughtered in the cattle yards (kbatira), the tamgha which fell due in such a case represented a combination of slaughtering-fees and sales tax. This slaughtering-tamgha could be paid partly or wholly by surrendering the skins to the city tannery, the heads and feet
to the city pickling and salting works, orthe offal tothe gut-factory.3 There isevidence of this-custom as early as the second half of the 14th century; in the later 15 th century the surrender of these parts of the animal may have become obligatory at least in certain districts. This special form ofslaughtering fee isevidenced, however, not merely for eastern Anatolia and Azarbaljan, but also for central Iran, for Qum, for example, where aswell as the skins one had togive up half a sheep's liver and thefat —presumably thefat on therump of the Persian
sheep.4 After the sales taxes wecome now to the customs dues. Onthis topic wemust bear in mind that notall varieties of customs were regarded atall times explicitly as tamgha. At the moment, however, we do not wish to go any further into the question of formal classification. Up tothe 16th century the most lucrative customs dues were the city customs (baj, later also duruV), which presumably were always tamgha payments. They were not based upon some uniform tariff, but were made up of an ever-increasing number of levies, which often belonged neither to the category of mal nor to that of jihat, but were officially

regarded as extraordinary impositions, although in practice certainly
they very soon assumed the character ofregular taxes.1 Like the rest of the tamgha dues the system of city customs displays a continuous development from the Mongol period until the second half of the 16th century. Not until the time of'Abbas I do we find substantial changes. In theIl-Khanid period the goods carried by thecaravans were still taxed at a flat rate, and one distinguished only between therate for goods to be sold within the city and the rate for goods intransit. Inthe course oftime, however, there evolved a refined system of deductions and "administrative fees" - for so we might describe those dues levied on the grounds that they reimbursed those engaged directly or indirectly in the work of collecting the customs dues. We will return to this topic inour discussion ofextraordinary taxation. Once again the data contained in the Qaniin-iHasanPadishah areof assistance in providing a picture of the city customs. The basic levy was the due paid tothe guard atthe city gate, called the rasm-i bavvabi. This was a tax onthe number of loads of goods that passed through the city gate, whether in or out, without distinction of quality,and irrespective of whether the goods were to besold in the city or were merely in transit. If they were in transit, then they were taxed twice,
once onentry, once onleaving.2 Certain goods were exempt from the rasm-i bavvabi - forexample, grain and milk products for the city's food supply. Peasants inthe surrounding district could become exempt from therasm-i bavvabi by paying additional dues in kind on their harvest. It might also happen, however, that in such cases the rasm-i bavvabi could be exacted in kind at thecity gate. In Diyarbakr for fattened beasts, instead of this tax, one paid a levy of one aqcha for every sixsheep that passed through thecity gate, and this levy was called tamghd-ji aghnam ("sheep tamgha"). In addition to thedues paid to theguard at thegate there was a series offurther customs charges, as, for example, the fee tothe scribe {rasm-i kitabat or rasm-i kuttdbi), andfor caravans passing through there was alevy called rasm-i qabi^ana? Duty on wine had tobe paidin kind. There was a fee to themaster of the court cellar, a feeto the commandant ofthe fort, and tothe night watchman. In spite of these specific designations thequantities of wine collected as city customs

went into the royal cellars. Aspecial group ofdifferent levies went to make up thesilk tax, which had to be paid in cash. Certain textile goods were liable toan increased silk tax. The total revenue from city customs amounted ingeneral to between 2% and 3% ofthe valueof the goods. Hinz points out that in the 15 th and 16th centuries the price of an article transported, say, from eastern Iran to Istanbul would double itself solely on account ofthe payment oflocal customs dues. Out-of-the-way cities sought toprofit from this by enticing merchant
caravans with the offer of lower customs rates.1 Not only at the city gates were tolls erected. Along the great caravan routes, at forts, guard posts and bridges, there were road tolls (baj-i shavdri')tobe negotiated. For a long time these taxes, known as roadguard dues (rasm-i rahddri), had served to maintain the guards stationed everywhere along the highways; but these were not always regarded as
a component of the tamgha.2 It is now time to look atthe system of tolls and tariffs in the Safavid state of the 17th and early 18th century. Since the reign of 'Abbas I the dues on the highways and, even more important, atthe ports had been allowed tosupplant city tolls as the most important source ofrevenue for the public treasury. To this must be related the fact that trade with foreign, principally European, powers was constantly widening in scope during the 17th century. The rahdarl dues had long since ceased to provide forthe upkeep of the highway guards. Nevertheless their rate had been creeping up all the time, and this, along with the multiplication of the number of customs posts, had turned them into a public revenue source of the first order. AEuropean traveller made the very pertinent observation, concerning the Iranian road system, that although one came upon scarcely any crossings or bridges one had nevertheless topay up atevery turn. The revenue from this abundant source had been flowing into the royal treasury very probably since the
days of'AbbasI.3 On the state frontiers the customs arrangements were not organised everywhere with the same thoroughness. The fiscal administration concentrated ontaxing all goods imported into the country through the ports on the Persian Gulf, where the average rate ran at 10% of the estimated value of the goods. In the time of 'Abbas II (1052

77/1642-66), from Bandar 'Abbas alone the public treasury collected
annually the sum of 24,000 tumans.1 Later on, this source of revenue was somewhat neglected; under Sulaiman it brought in only 10,000 tumans, and the office of harbourmaster, towhom belonged the supervision ofthe machinery forcollecting the tariffs, was finally leased out
in 1674 forthe relatively small sum of 2,700 tumans.2 On the Persian Gulf there were three large ports: Bandar 'Abbas, Bandar Rig, and Bandar Kangun, each with its own independent customs house. On the inland frontiers and also on theCaspian Sea thecustoms were very irregularly organised. It is worth mentioning, however, that not all foreign merchants were taxed atthe same rate. The British, the Portuguese, the Dutch and the French all paid atdifferent rates, and all were entitled tospecific tariff concessions. Among the tamgha taxes abrogated by Tahmasp in 1565 werethe revenues from themints. We must note that these revenues wereof various kinds. Anyone who on his own initiative struck coin out of precious metal, or had foreign currency, also of precious metal,reminted - a practice that became mandatory inthe 17th century - had to pay a fee to cover expenses. We know, however, from thelater Safavid period that in addition the royal treasury claimed the difference between the real and the nominal value ofevery coin struck. W. Hinz and H.Horst argue convincingly that the mint tamgha was presumably this mintage deduction, averaging 2%, rather than thefees for
minting.3 Atallevents Tahmasp's abrogation of the tamgha did not result in the revenues (ydjibi)from this mintage being renounced for ever, for, ashas been already pointed out, in the 17th century this tax appears as one of the most lucrative sources of revenue forthe royal treasury, and in the first half of the 18th century the rate of mintage
rose to over i5%.4 When discussing the monetary system we will return to this question. Now we turn to the last significant group of tamgha taxes: taxes on crafts. In the reign ofthe Jalayirids, and presumably under the Timuridsas well, the taxation of crafts was operated within the framework of the existent sales taxes, on the principle that it was not the manufacture but the sale of a product that made itliable to taxation. Relevant, too, isthe circumstance that inthe tax codes the sales tax was not computed at a

flat rate for a whole city, but specified for individual professions, artisan guilds (asnaf) and shops. From themodels provided by an assessment book of the year 764/1363 forthe city ofTabriz we learn that asales tax was presented for close on forty professional groups and guilds, which proves that this tax was clearly conceived as a means of
taxing industrial production.1 In the Qaniin of Uzun Hasan Aq Quyunlii, about a hundred years later, wedetect the beginnings of the attempt to tax industrial production itself, irrespective ofthe amount for which the product was "sold. Obviously in the period before the compilation of the Qaniin of Uzun Hasan, thepractice had become established oftaxing weavers at a specified monthly oryearly rate for their looms. The Qaniin prescribed the tax on individual professions in various regions. This might be a tax on shops orworkshops, as inthe case oftradesmen, orit might be a straightforward tax on industry,as in the case of the bakers and cooks in the eastern Anatolian cityof
Kharpiit.2 As a rule these taxes seem tohave been payable incash, but sometimes the rates referred topayment in kind. It is obvious that in the late 15 th century and thereafter these taxes onindustry were regarded asanextension of the previous system of taxing industry according toturn-over, for they were always conceived as tamgha levies. The turning point inthe development ofsome ofthe taxes, which we have placed at the beginning ofthe 17th century, can be perceived in the sphere of industry as early as the reign of Tahmasp in the second half of the 16th century. The historical development of the tax on crafts had followed a different course from region to region. In contrast to this tax as operated by theAq Quyunlu and certainly as operated during the early decades of Safavid rule is the system which comprehensively taxed those engaged in industry. This system we find operating in thelater period of Tahmasp's reign. Because it embraced all urban manufacturers and subjected them to fixed levies, it was a much more efficient fiscal instrument than the codified usages of the Qanun-i Hasan Padishah. In the often quoted administrative manual, Ta%kirat al-muluk, this taxation system isvividly presented. Inaccordance with the guidelines set down by the divan, a high city official, the kalantar (in several respects not unlike a European mayor, cf. above), assisted

by another dignitary, the naqlb (probably the most distinguished of the sayyids, i.e. descendants of the Prophet, inthe city, cf. above), decided on thetotal extent of the taxes on industry due in their city. These taxes, known inTahmasp's time as mal-i muhtarifa, were now called the bunicha. Then the kalantar summoned theheads of the districts (kadkhuda) and the elders of the guilds {rishsafidan-i asnaf) in order to apportion, in their presence, the bunlcha-quotas to the individual "guilds" and other institutions. The aldermen now became responsible for the collection of the amounts apportioned. The bunicha payment was obligatory onall craftsmen, bazaar merchants, sellers at the rope market, cattle market, and other markets, on all bakeries, eatinghouses, inns and baths (in so far as these were not crown properties and thus leased bythe royal treasury, as, forexample, in Isfahan), and at
times on such notorious services as taverns and brothels.1 In the crown provinces the revenues from the bunicha, like all other levies, naturally flowed into the royal treasury, and inthe other provinces they formed part of the regalia, so that in every case it was the sovereign who
profited directly from the bunicha.2 Special value was attached to the tax on the production of silk and cotton. According to Chardin the ruler received asum equivalent to one-third of the product, quite apart from the fact that theexport of silk was one of the most important royal prerogatives. The flat rate assessment ofthe bunicha was ofadvantage to the public treasury in yet another respect. Ifa particular producer was exempted from bunicha levies, this inno way diminished the revenue from taxes, for the cost was shared outbythe other members of the
guild.3 Following Hinz's argument, wemay regard the receipts from certain urban manufactures as alatent tax on industry. The fees levied, for example, bythe city tanneries when someone brought a goatskin or sheepskin to have it tanned, or,as the case might be, took awaythe finished leather, were somewhat higher than thecost of running the
industry. The surplus was claimed by thepublic treasury.4 Certainly this did not apply in every case, nor to all manufactures. Italso covered the processing of certain raw materials claimed as dues by fiscal

fiscal officials. One recalls, for example, the dues payable on slaughtering ananimal. Moreover, the products of these urban manufacturers were frequently the object of a fiscal device which, under the name of tarh, had been widespread since the Mongol period. The populace was compelled tosell certain raw materials tothe fiscal office (explicitly,to the manufacturer) at an artificially low price, or, alternatively, to buy
certain products from the fiscal office at an inflated price.1 Aswith many other devices this one gave thetaxofficials ample scope for malpractice, asaninscription dated 981/1573 records concerning the
compulsory sale of the products ofthe soap works atNairlz.2 We now move on from the discussion of all those levies which were regarded up tothe 16th century as tamgha, and which tosome extent underwent special development during the 17th century. That does not mean that we have abandoned the sphere ofregular taxation. To this sphere certainly belonged the jizya, the Quranic poll tax on nonMuslims. This tax affected Jews and Christians, both native and foreign (including Europeans). The principle underlying the jizya was fundamentally that every adult male dhimml had to pay a specified annual sum. As with all the other taxes, the rate of the jizya varied from place to place and from time totime. Inthe middle ofthe 17th century, for example, Armenians and Jews liable to the jizya had topay annually the equivalent of one misqal of gold (i.e. 4.69 gm). Du Mans, towhom we are indebted for this information, tells us also that this tax was called either kharaj or jizya, an interesting indication of how little awareness there was in the 17th century of the original character of the
canonical taxes.3 We learn from adocument ofSulaiman from the year 1094/1683 that the Quranic poll tax forArmenians in Julfa, southof Isfahan, was calculated at a flat rate and apportioned to the male members of the Armenian community by the kalantar ofthe Armenians ofJulfa in collaboration with the kadkhudas (heads ofthe
districts, elders).4 This procedure was very much inline with what we have already observed concerning the apportionment of the flat rate bunlcha tax. At that time the yield from the jizya for Julfa had reached the figure of 580 tumans. In 'Abbas I's time it had yielded only 180 tiimans, which may indicate that the Armenians ofJulfa inthose days

had been taxed at a specially low rate, in order to encourage their settlement there. Under 'Abbas I's successor SafI (1038-52/1629-42) income from thejizya had already risen to 260 tumans. During the second half of the 17th century the income from thejizya raised in
Julfa flowed into the purse ofthe queen mother.1 From the document mentioned above we learn that at this time the jizya contribution of one of the richest Armenian merchants and his five sons added up to no less than 3 5 tumans. Over and above thejizya, thedhimmls were bound to pay other taxes aswell. In the Qaniin of Uzun Hasan enhanced rates forcertain taxes are indicated asapplying to Christians, and we know that in the 16th century considerably higher tax rates were imposed upon Christian merchants and manufacturers than upon their Muslim colleagues, a fact already mentioned above. Since thetime of 'Abbas I a great Armenian colony had existed in Julfa. The above mentioned reduction in taxes which 'Abbas granted theArmenians of this town did not continue to operate forlong after his death. In the later 17th century the Christians of Julfa were particularly hard hit by tax impositions and other repressive measures. An additional burden upon the Armenian artisans ofJulfa was that they were called upon much more frequently than were others to provide unpaid corvee labour. More will be said about this inthe context ofspecial impositions. A special group offoreigners were the Indians, who had flocked to Iran in the 17th century. These, as we have observed, applied themselves to monetary business and usury. A specially assessed poll tax was
imposed upon them, and was known as sardna-yi Huniid.2 Besides the jizya, there was yet another form ofpoll tax which must not be confused in any way with the canonical tax on non-Muslims: the universal poll taxon Muslims. Let us recall once again theconcept qubchur as it had been understood inthe time ofthe Tl-Khans. One of these qubchur taxes had been alevy to which every subject was unconditionally liable. It was thus a poll tax on all Muslims, in strict contravention ofthe Shari'a. In spite ofchanges in the meaning ofthe term qubchur, and its ultimate disappearance in thepost-Mongol period, this tax continued inother forms, in such forms, indeed, that it could be listed officially amongst the extraordinary taxes, although exacted

with all the regularity ofa regular tax. Under the Jalayirids this levy became known as sarana orsar-shumdra, and in many districts the custom grew upof imposing a khdna-shumdra ona whole household instead of levying a poll tax in the true sense. In the Qdniin of Uzun Hasan we come across this "hearth-tax" (Hinz) in the context of extra
ordinary taxes.1 It was still being exacted under the Safavids. The same sort of thing happened in respect of the host of taxes in the form of "administrative dues". These too did not pass without reservation as regular taxes, and yet defacto were exacted on aregular basis and frequently formed an official component ofregular levies, as was demonstrated above regarding the composition of the tamgha on wine. Such dues undoubtedly constituted an essential element in the comprehensive concept of vujuhat to which we referred earlier. They were designated ikhrdjdt (literally "expenses", signifying reimbursement of expenses incurred inthe course of taxing and administering), rusiim or huqiiq (more or less "dues", to those in whose favour they were granted). A distinction was drawn between muqarrart dues, which were regular exactions, and khdrijiyydt, which were ad hoc extraordinary
dues.2 Itwas undoubtedly true of many dues that their true application did not coincide with the purpose indicated by their title. This was especially obvious with those which were of long standing. For example, in Uzun Hasan's time and later, in certain districts of eastern Anatolia a rasm-i timurjak was raised, a "Tlmiir due", when the conqueror had been dead and buried for fifty years. Itis clear that in sucha
case an originally extraordinary imposition had become a regular tax.3 Obviously the contrary could also occur: the due reached the actual nominee. This probably happened allthe time if the recipient were someone in a high position. Thus the rasm-i ndyib of Hasan's Qdniin most certainly found its way tothe crown's deputy. Equally the rasm al-vi^dra,known in the time of the Jalayirids, went to the vizier, whose upkeep at theend of the Safavid period was provided for almost
entirely out of dues;4 and therasm al-saddra was instituted for the benefit of the sadr. This latter tax had been in operation since the 15 th century, and under the Safavids the suyurghals, too, were liable to it, as
was mentioned inanother context.5 Acharacteristic of many dues was

their persistence, often throughout several centuries: once such a perquisite was introduced, the recipient could hardly bring himself to renounce the income it brought. Thus the due forthe governor ofthe city or the district (shihna, becoming ddriigha under the Timurids) was exacted under all the dynasties with which we are concerned as rasm-i sbibnagi, ddrughagana (under the Timurids) or rasm-iddrugba.1
Another distinction may have lain in whether the duehadbeen imposed for some higher official in thegeneral administration (e.g. nayib, sadr, vizier) or foranofficial who was actively engaged in the collection ofone ormore taxes. Inthe latter case the dues - at least at the time of their introduction - possessed the character of extraordinary taxes, as in the case of reimbursement fees for tax officials in general {rusum-i 'ummal, haqq al-tabsil) ordues destined forthe assessor of taxes (though not tobe confused with the aforementioned taqabbulat). This hadoriginally been thecase with therasm-i bavvabl and rasm-i kuttab, which we mentioned along with the city gate customs, although by thetime of Uzun Hasan they had already taken on the character of regular fiscal revenues. The same was true of the road customs dues (rahdarl), which had originally maintained the highway guards but inthe course oftime became a component ofregular state revenue orofthe ruler's income. Many dues had been conceived as supplementary levies, inthe sense that their rate was computed as apercentage of other taxes. There were other dues, however, which had fixed rates. A complete enumeration of all dues and adetailed exposition of their significance and development would gofarbeyond the framework of this present study. We must becontent, therefore, with the foregoing reflections, and may sum upbystressing the fact that many of these impositions, although notbyany means all of them, revealed a tendency to take on thecharacter of regular state revenues, a tendency which expressed itself in theincreasing alienation of the imposition from itsoriginal purpose aswell asin the transition from "secondary rates", i.e. rates calculated as percentages of other taxes, to primary, fixed rates. Another group ofspecial impositions, fundamentally having something in common with the dues of which we have been speaking,

comprised those levies imposed, originally atleast, on particular occasions during the year. In this sphere, too, the tendency of extraordinary impositions tobecome regular taxes can be detected. We discover, for example, a feast-day levy and a wedding levy listed in the Qanun of Uzun Hasan under thecategory of extraordinary impositions. Itis quite clear, especially ofthe wedding levy, that these taxes, when first introduced, must have fallen due on theoccasion of the particular event. The Qanun, however, indicates that the term when both of these taxes fall due is the beginning of spring, which can only mean that these extraordinary impositions had become disguised as regular taxes
on the population.1 The yield from genuine regular taxation — often described as asl-i mdl-u-jihdt or, in respect of non-Muslims, as asl-iji^ya — was augmented by surcharges in theform of specific percentages of the amounts yielded by theas/. These additions to regular taxes were known as tafavut (literally "the difference"). InMongol times the word used had been far'. The documents usually speak oftafdvut-i mdl-u-jihat andof tafdvut-i ji^ya. The original purpose of the tafavut may have been to offset a putative increase in production without having to revise the fixed tax rates, anoperation which would have involved considerable administrative expense. Infact, however, the tafavut levies were little other than an easily contrived means ofincreasing the principal taxes. They had been exacted even inMongol times and can be traced down
to the late Safavid period.2 One special category ofextraordinary taxes consisted ofobligations which were notdischarged directly through payment in cash or in kind. Here, too, the usage observed was essentially Il-Khanid in origin. First tobe mentioned in this connexion are those services which peasants had to give to travelling officials, whom they had to accommodate along with their entire retinue. This service was called qunalghd. They were required also toprovide forthese people and their animals. In respect of persons, the obligation was called 'alafa and, in respect of animals, 'ulufa. The word ulagh denoted the duty of peasants to provide such officials and their retinues with mounts; while uldm denoted the obligatory service of providing local guides. The manner and form of exacting these services, even under the later Safavids, was very much in

line with Il-Khanid usage.1 The documents show that from the Mongol period until the end ofthe Safavid period other services were required which were known by the names bigar and shikar. The latter term probably applied to unpaid service at the hunt, including possibly the supplyof beaters. Bigar denoted corvee services of all kinds, principally that of supplying agricultural labour. The number ofdays ofsuch service prescribed forpeasants could not at any time have been sovery great. In Uzun Hasan's time, for example, only from one to three days ayear were required, and exemption could be bought by payment of a moderate cash
sum.2 The urban craftsmen, however, especially in the Safavid period, were subject toa much more exacting type ofbigar. They were called out towork chiefly onthe large building projects ofthe shah. In this way it was possible forthe ruler to execute large-scale plans without drawing too drastically on the treasury - one is put in mind of the architectural embellishment of the capital Isfahan by'Abbas I and his successors. The organisation of such acomprehensive system of labour services was handled by precisely the same methods as the bunlcha, the tax onindustry: the kalantars decided onthe quota of men required, and passed this onthrough the "guild" elders tothe craftsmen in the guilds (asnaf). The Armenians of Julfa, called upon frequently on account oftheir manual skills to perform such unpaid work, presumably were not organised inguilds according toprofession. The Armenian kalantar of Julfa, in collaboration with the kadkhudas (headsof the separate residential districts), apportioned the work to the inhabi
tants of a city quarter who practised the particular craft.3 Finally, important revenues of the public treasury included every conceivable form of"gift", squeezed out ofthe people atevery possible opportunity. There was scarcely a European traveller who was not moved toreport inastonishing detail the unlimited appetite ofIranian rulers foranenormous range of valuable "gifts" from the provinces and from individuals, aswell as their confiscation ofproperty. Inthis,
too, we see the persistence ofIl-Khanid institutions and customs.4

SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
The following observations are meant toprovide a rough sketch of the administrative background to the tax system. During the period of our review, we can detect ingeneral a far reaching continuity in state fiscal institutions. It must first be stated, however, that the division of the administration into two components under 'Abbas I and his successors brought about certain changes inthis sphere also. Together with the state chancellery the central finance administration formed the Grand Divan {divdn-i a'la), atthe head of which stood the Grand Vizier. This linking of finance chamber and chancellery dates back, possibly, to Nizam al-Mulk, the celebrated statesman of the time of the Great Saljuqs. One of its consequences was that the Grand Vizier was ultimately responsible forthe financial affairs ofthe state. Nonetheless, thereal head of the finance chamber was the mustaufl al-mamdlik. Since the time of 'Abbas I his counterpart had beenthe mustaufi-yi kbdssa, who was responsible forthe financial affairs of the
crown estates.1 At all events this sharing did not of necessity bring with it — at least not until the last decades of the 17th century — a twofold structure inall of the lower sections of the finance chamber. Even in thetime of the Tl-Khans the mustaufl al-mamalik was assisted atthe head of the finance chamber by two more high officials, although both were of lesser rank: the mushrif al-mamalik and the na\ir al-mamalik. Obviously, in directing the financial administration the primary function of this trio was to exercise mutual control. The same trio was to befound in allprovincial and regional finance chambers also. All regional mustaufls were subject to the mustaufl al-mamalik, and, correspondingly, the mushrifs and nazirs were ultimately subject to the mushrif al-mamalik and nazir al-mamalik respectively. In the Safavid ndqjr-i daftarkhana-yi bumdyun-i aId we can recognise the older nazir al-mamalik; and the mushrif al-mamalik was presumably the prototype ofthe Safavid ddriigba-yi daftarkbdna.2
The foundation of the tax system was theqdniin, the "book of levies". In this book were set down the rates of all taxes that had to be paid, based upon the data in what amounted to anarchive and was comparable toa land register office. According tothis book, the taxes should have been atthe same level from year toyear, but, as we have

THE POST-MONGOL TAX SYSTEM
seen, this was not so inpractice. For this reason, the qaniin had to be revised from time to time. In thelater Safavid period thebook of exactions, under the title dastur al-'amal, was placed within the depart
ment ofthe sahib-taujth (see below).1 In order to clarify theadministrative procedures surrounding the actual collection of taxes we have to discuss two more concepts: tax farming and taxcheque (barat). The raising of the various taxes in separate districts and regions was leased out, always under contract, to private persons orofficials inthe form ofconcessions which varied in range. On making application for such a concession, the applicant had to produce evidence of the state of his own property, for, ifthe application were granted, the lessee assigned his own property assurety for the sum to be raised. Astheowners of tiyuls or suyiirghals, as described above, always possessed the right to collect taxes, contracts had to be made with them also. But they did nothave to provide any special evidence oftheir own financial standing, because inmost cases they enjoyed an exemption from tax (mu'afl), and so the public treasury had no claims upon them. Hence their contracts were different from those of the other tax-lessees, and were given the special name
taslim-nama.2 In all cases tax-cheques (barat) were issued to the tax farmers {musta'jir, mutasarrif) by thecentral financial administration and made outon thebasis of the terms and rates contained in the qaniin. The recipient had tocash these sums right away and atthe end of the tax year balance his account, in accordance with the terms ofhis contract, whereupon he was discharged by the financial authorities. As we have seen, the barat system also served to remunerate or reward officials. This was done by giving them tax cheques to thevalue of their salaries, drawn ona particular city or district where they could raise the fixed sums themselves orthrough an intermediary. These procedures were put on record in two books of the finance chamber. Assigned tax cheques were entered in the daftar-itaujih under
the control of the sahib-taujlh.3 In another book, the daftar-i avarija, appeared the current state of the tax fund for thewhole territory, arranged by cities and provinces; and all financial transactions, including the making out of tax cheques, had to be noted inthis book, which was kept by the avarija-nivis. In the 17th century thebook was sub

divided according to the four traditional administrative regions Azarbaljan and Shlrvan, 'Iraq-i 'Ajam, Kirman and Khurasan - and
each district was under its own avarija-nivls.1 Before making out a barat on the tax income of any city or province, the subordinate officer of the sahib-taujlh had,therefore, always to consult the daftar-i avarija in order tomake sure that he was not issuing an "uncovered" cheque in the event ofthe tax capacity ofthe region being exhausted. In the Safavid period all levies which, as regalia, flowed into the crown treasury, although not falling within the competence of the administration ofthe royal estates, were withdrawn from the "balance-sheet" of the avarija books and, from the first half of the 17thcentury, recorded
in a special department headed by the ^abita-nivis.2In the Mongol period the custom had already become well established of taking the solar year as the fiscal unit of time. This year was based onthe calculations of Naslr al-Dln Tusl. Since the time of the Timurids these solar years, reckoned from the beginning of spring, were given theyear names from the Turco-Mongol twelve animal cycle. This manner of reckoning time - incomparison with reckoning in lunar years - simplified book-keeping and balancing, and eased the lot ofthe tax-payer, who otherwise - asstill happened inthe time of the 'Abbasid Caliphate - would have been taxed 3 3 times in the course
of 32 harvests.3
OBSERVATIONS ON T H E MONETARY SYSTEM
In Iran during the period under our review there existed throughout a two-tier, parallel currency, based upon gold and upon silver. Most coins were minted in silver, but there was always gold coinage too, even ifseldom issued. Iranian coins in precious metal were always of a very high standard. Under Ghazan Khan the fineness of silver coins was 976/1000, and inlater centuries the standard rose even higher. From the 14th until the 18th century the coin chiefly tobe found in currency was silver coin. This circumstance, like several other phenomena in economic life, is to be connected with the reforms of the Tl-Khan Ghazan. During his reign (694-703/1295-1304) a new unit of

OBSERVATIONS ON THE MONETARY SYSTEM
currency was introduced: the silver dinar, called the dinar-irayij. One dinar-i rayij (silver) was equal tosix dirhams. According toa statement of Rashid al-Dln, inthe time of Ghazan Khan the dinar-i rayij weighed 3 misqal (at that time 4.3 gm). The dinar thus weighed 12.9 gm. There were also dirham coins (2.15 gm) and coins valued at half a dirham
all in silver.1 The unit ofreckoning was the tuman (from the Mongol tumen, i.e. 10,000), the equivalent of 10,000 dinars. Until the end ofthe 18th century the silver tuman was never struck, sothat in the period with which we are concerned there never were any silver tuman coins. In his currency reform Ghazan Khan had taken as his model the
"Chinese tuman", which consisted of 10,000 bdlish each ofsix dinars.2 At allevents, this standardisation under Ghazan Khan broke with Islamic tradition, which set the dinar as the unit of gold currency over against thedirham as theunit of silver currency. In Iran, from the Mongol period until its final disappearance, the dirham was regarded as a standardised subdivision of the (silver) dinar, andthis in turn remained the basis of reckoning for the whole monetary system ofIran throughout succeeding centuries, even though atalater stage it was no longer minted and other monetary denominations became common.In what follows the most important coins with their different names and their dinar value will be presented, the gold value ofthe dinar and the tuman at different periods indicated, and some idea given, consequently, of the value of Iranian money in the course of the centuries with which we are dealing. That it had been one ofthe intentions ofGhazan's reform to adopt the term dinar primarily as adesignation for the unit ofsilver currency can be seen from the fact that none ofthe gold coins ofGhazan Khan was named dinar (ornamed as fractions of a dinar or as a dirham, being a fixed fraction ofa dinar). This was soin spite ofthe fact that Ghazan's one misqal gold coin corresponded by weight to one-third of a dinar or two dirhams. Fora gold coin weighing onedirham (\ misqal, say2.ijgm) one used, obviously quite deliberately, theterm nim-misqal.
Ghazan Khan's standard for the dinar-i rayij of three misqal (12.9 gm) could obviously bemaintained only fora few years. By the time

of the Tl-Khan Abu Sa'Id (717— 36/1317-35) the silver dinar weighed only 8.4 gm; but the original dlnar-i rayij continued to be used as aunit of account. In the period following the collapse of the Il-Khanid empire, namely in the second half of the 14th century, various monetary systems grew up inIran. True tothe Il-Khanid tradition, however, all ofthese were based upon the silver dinar, subdivided into dirhams. Whereas a dinar, divided into six dirhams following the tradition of Ghazan's dlnar-i rayij, was still minted in Tabriz, we find inBaghdad, the capital ofthe Jalayirids, a dinar divided into 12dirhams, and another, called the
dinar-i mursal, divided into.10 dirhams.1 In Nishapiir in the province of Khurasan under Togha Temiir (d.754/i353)a silver dinar weighing 4.21 gm and divided into 4 dirhams (at 1.05 gm) was minted. It was known also as a khurasanl or a dlnar-i khurasanl. However, in Khurasan the dlnar-i rayij at that time was still in
use for account purposes.2 Another currency based on a silver dinar was to be found in Transoxiana: in the ulus of Chaghatai anonymous silver coins had been minted since the late 13 th century. From the time of the reign ofKebek Khan (718-26/1318-26), however, these were struck with the name ofa ruler, so that thereafter these coins were known as kapaki money. One silver kapakl dinar weighed approximately 8 gm and
was divided into 6dirhams atfrom 1.3 to 1.4 gm.3 After 792/1390 Tlmur had a new silver coin struck throughout the territories of Iran. At first itwas introduced obviously only into Transoxiana and Khurasan. This was the tanga-ji nuqra or silver tanga, a word which seems to be ofIndian origin. Originally it denoted a unit of weight and was applied first to a coin probably under Mahmud of Ghazna. From the reign of Sultan Shams al-Dln Iltutmish (607-33/ 1211 — 36) a silver tanga (tanga-yi nuqra) weighing 10.76 gm was being minted in Delhi. Ttmur's tanga-yi nuqra followed this standard and weighed exactly half the tanga of Delhi, i.e. 5.38 gm. Itwas divided into four dirhams. Presumably Tlmiir's tanga soon ousted the above-mentioned lighter (dlnar-i) khurasanl of four dirhams, forin the period around 844/1440 there is no further mention of the khurasanl currency.

Under Shah Rukh the weight of this silver tanga was reduced to 4.72 gm, which in his day was the weight of one misqal. In a very large part of the teritory under his rule, during the early decades of the 9th/15 th century, the coin assumed the name shdhrukhi. Moreover, this Timurid tanga at one misqal was minted also in gold, although very rarely, and was called tanga-yi tilld. In later times it became the tilld, the current
gold coinage of the Uzbek khans of Bukhara, Khiva, and Khoqand.1 Even so, in the Timurid period various dinar currencies persisted. There is evidence from 844/1440 of the existence of the following:in Transoxiana there was the kapakl dinar at about 8gm ofsilver.In western Iran there were as many as three different dinar currencies, the relationship of which to the kapakl dinar is known: the Baghdador Shlraz dinar, the dlnar-i 'Iraqi, and the Tabriz dinar. The dlnar-i 'Iraqi seems traceable directly to the earlier Tabriz dinar-i rayij, whereas the dlnar-i Tabrlzl ofthe 15 th century must have appeared for the first time in Timurid times. At that time the relation between the four silver currencies was as follows: one kapakl dinar was equivalent tothree Baghdad (or Shlraz) dinars, tosix 'Iraqi dinars and tonine Tabrlzl dinars. Thus we arrive at the following average weights for the various dinars: Baghdad or Shlraz dinar = ca.2.7 gm; dlnar-i 'Iraqi = ca. 1.35
gm; dlnar-i Tabrlzl = ca.0.9 gm.2 There is one piece of information, likewise applicable to the period around 1440, that startles us: two kapakl dinars are supposed to have
been equivalent to one tanga.3 At first sight this would seem to contradict our affirmation that under Shah Rukh a tanga of 4/72 gm had been minted. Itis possible that meanwhile, at least in eastern Iran and Transoxiana, the name we have already mentioned, shahrukhl, had become so popular for these smaller coins that the name tanga could be used for another species of coin. Asimilar process can be observed happening in the time of the Aq Quyunlu in eastern Anatolia, where the terms tanga and shahrukhl likewise denoted two different species of
coin.4 In the kingdom of Lar also there existed at a later date a monetary unit called a tanga, but this did not prevent a larger coin, the Idri, also being described as atanga (cf. below). In the second half of the 15 th century the dinar currency ofIran suffered an incredibly rapid decline. According to Hinz, in 1440 one

tuman-i 'Iraqi, i.e. 10,000 dinars, was still worth on the gold standard 3,250 German Gold Marks at pre-war standard (cf. below). Twelve years later the tuman-i 'Iraqi had sunk to 1,200 Gold Marks. Under the Safavids the only currencies known were the 'Iraqi and Tabriz dinars, and wemay assume that the distinction between these soon became
purely formal, both currencies becoming equal in value.1 We may, therefore, equate the tuman of916/1510, that isof the reign ofIsma'Il I, with the tuman-i 'Iraqi of1440 and 1452: it was worth only 270 Gold Marks. There is little information available on currency conditions under the Turkmen dynasties ofthe Qara Quyunlu and Aq Quyunlu. Inthe time of Qara Yusuf, and presumably under all the other Qara Quyunlu rulers, the legal tender was the silver dinar, at least inthe form ofthe Tabriz dinar and the 'Iraqi dinar. There are reports, however, which mention sums intumans. Besides these there were silver tangas weighing 5 gm or 5.2 gm, and coins ofShah Rukh and other Timurids were current also. What knowledge we have of the currency system in the Aq Quyunlu state, at least inits territories ineastern Anatolia, comes from the records kept in these territories under the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Sellm I; and it is to these records, too, that we are indebted for our knowledge ofUzun Hasan's Qaniin (cf. above). There we find the following data: one aqcha-ji'TJsmdni (the Ottoman asper, the gold value ofwhich at the time was calculated by Hinz tobe 0.20 Gold Marks or 2.4d.) under the Aq Quyunlu corresponded to three socalled qaraja-aqchas, also known asdirhams. One tanga is equated to two Ottoman aqchas, one shahruql (clearly a corruption of shahrukhl)
to six Ottoman aqchas.2 From this we may deduce: 1 tanga = 6 qaraja-aqcha 1 shahruql = 3 tangas = 18 qaraja-aqchas From this comparison we learn that one "shahruql" had a gold value of 1.2 Gold Marks, which, at the end of the 15 th century, was completely in line with the gold value of the shahrukhl standardised at 4.72 gm under Shah Rukh. In the second half ofthe 15 th century the tanga of the Aq Quyunlu period, ofwhich we have just spoken, was worth only one-third ofthe shahrukhl. This tanga was probably restricted to only a fewprovinces. Also in circulation was a silver coin with a

standard weight of 4.6 gm (or 5.2 gm ifwe follow H.L. Rabino); and this coin, too, was called a tanga. In addition there were coins of half this weight, and even quarters and eighths of this unit. This tanga must have been the counterpart of the "shahruql" weknow existed in
eastern Anatolia.1 Under the Aq Quyunlu, alongside a possibly multiple tanga currency, there was also in circulation the dinar currency, principally the dlnar-i Tabrlzl. A further brief note on the gold coins of the Turkmen dynasties: we know of a gold coin of Jahan Shah Qara Quyunlu, weighing some 3.9 gm; the Aq Quyunlu minted a gold coin weighing one misqal-i shar'i, i.e. a "canonical misqal" ofabout 3.4 gm. Probably these two coins corresponded to the ashrafi;the second one almost certainly did. The ashrafl was an originally Egyptian gold coin which had been minted since 810/1407. It weighed 3.45 gm. There is proof that Mamluk ashrafl coins were in circulation in the Aq Quyunlu kingdom. There are, however, also records mentioning gold tangas of the Aq Quyunlu
rulers.2 We have already referred to the sharp debasement of the coinage in the course of the 15 th century. This must be attributed to the fact that in the Safavid state the silver dinar was no longer being minted. But the dinar still remained what the tuman had been from the beginning:a unit of account. In this period the 'Iraqi dinar was already equated with the Tabriz dinar as we mentioned above. This took place presumably as early as under Isma'Il I. Other currencies based on the silver dinar now existed only outside the frontiers ofthe Safavid state, with the
exception of parts of Khurasan.3 Under Isma'Il I and Tahmasp I,following the traditions of the 15 th century silver tangas were still minted. But the early Safavid tanga no longer belonged to any special currency. Tanga was now the name for a coin of a specific weight, the value of which was expressed onlyin dinars or, which comes to the same thing, in fractions of the tuman. In the early years ofhis reign, Isma'Il's silver coins weighed four, two, and one misqals (18.7 gm, 9.3 gm, and 4.7 gm). Later on their weight was reduced on several occasions. The silver coin weighing one misqal was worth fifty dinars. The term tanga certainly applied tothis coin, for its standard weight ofone misqal corresponded tothe monetary

standard of the silver tanga of the 15 th century. Thus the double tanga
was worth 100 dinars and thequadruple tanga 200 dinars.1 Under Tahmasp the new term sbdhi supplanted the term tanga. One shahl was equal to 50 dinars; the 100 dinar coin was named the du-sbdbi ("double
shahl") and from 1540 weighed one misqal (4.64 gm).2 Under Muhammad Khudabanda (985-95/1578-87) the name ofthe ruler established itself as the designation, khudabanda or muhammadi, forthe 100 dinar coin. In the 17th century thejiame khudabanda was scarcely ever used. Under Muhammad Khudabanda and at the beginning ofthe reignof
'Abbas I, the muhammadi weighed one misqal (about 4.7 gm).3 For a short time it was the most minted coin, until under 'Abbas I (995—1038/15 87—1629) a200 dinar piece appeared, the 'abbasi, which at first weighed two misqals and hence corresponded to the Timurid tanga. In 1593 the weight of the 'abbasi was reduced to 7.8 gm. Under 'Abbas I thefollowing silver coins were minted: the bisti worth 20 dinars, the shahl worth 50 dinars, the muhammadi worth 100 dinars, and finally the200 dinar piece, the 'abbasi we have just mentioned. Besides these there were copper coins also called qd% orqd^baki. One qazbakl used to be worth five dinars. At the beginning of the 18th century there were "small"and "large" qazbakls, worth 5 and 10 dinars respectively. Copper coinage was minted in almost every city,but possessed itsfull value only in its region oforigin; in the rest of the
realm itpossessed only half of its face value; itwas re-minted annually.4 From the second half of the 17th century more silver coins came into currency: the ha^ar (i.e. "thousand"), worth 1,000 dinars, and named also the pan/-'abbasi; and a dah-shdhiot pdnsad-dindr, which, asthe name indicates, was worth 500 dinars. In addition, under Sulaiman there were two different 'abbasi coins: the "little 'abbasi" worth 200 dinars and the so-called "large 'abbasi" worth 250 dinars, also known as the
panj-sbdbi.5 From the reign of 'Abbas I until the endof the17th century theweight of the Safavid silver coins had scarcely altered.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE MONETARY SYSTEM
Only in the 18th century, under Sultan Husain, did the 'abbasi, worth
200 dinars, drop to 5.4 gm.1 We have already mentioned that under Isma'Il I gold coins had been struck according to the monetary standard of the Mamluk ashrafi at
about 3.4-3.5 gm. Thus gold coins of0.887 g ma n d°-77 gm> struck in
the name of Isma'Il, were £ ashrafls.2 Gold coins minted under Tahmasp and Muhammad Khudabanda exhibit by contrast the monetary standard of the Timurid (tanga-yi) tilla (the gold tanga), which lived on in the gold coinage of the Shaibanids andJanids in Transoxiana. One gold coin of'Abbas I weighed 2.3 gm; it represented
a half-tilla, and thus followed thetanga standard, of Timurid origin.3 Later the ashrafi completely ousted the gold tanga coinage. However, alongside the ashrafi currency gold coins were struck which followed the 'abbasi monetary standard current at thetime. And so there were gold 'abbasls, muhammadls, and soon. As has been explained already, these gold coins scarcely ever found their way into circulation. They were struck on special occasions and used chiefly bythe shah as gifts. We must not fail to note, however, that foreign gold coinage,too, principally the Venetian ducat (ptfcchino, ducatd) and the Florentine gulden (Jiorino), were to be found allover the Middle East. In value they
were always equivalent to the ashrafi.4 In conclusion we shall examine the Iranian currencies in circulation outside the Safavid state in the 16th and 17th centuries. One of the most popular coins around the Persian Gulf was the larl, minted in Lar, the capital of Laristan in southern Iran, a territory which in the 16th century did not yet belong to the Safavid empire. The larl consisted of a double twist of silver purl, stamped on both sides, having a metal
purity of98% and weighing 4.8-5.1 gm.5 This and the fact that in 1517 this curious coin was not only known as the larl but sometimes was also designated as"tanga" causes usto surmise that the larl, too, originally had been struck according to the standard of the Timurid tanga. In 1525 two larl mintings were known: the"old larl" equal to 3 tangas and 9dinars, and the "new larl" equal to 3 tangas and 10 dinars. In this

context the tanga, as a fraction of the larl, must not be confused with the
name also commonly used of the whole larl.1 From these data we draw the following conclusion concerning the currency of Laristan: its basis was the dinar of Laristan; 12 dinars made up one Laristan tanga; an "old Ian", therefore, was valued at 45 dinars, a"new larl" at 46 dinars. After the integration of Laristan into the Safavid empire larls continued to be minted, although relatively seldom, but their value was determined from now on only bytheSafavid currency, for obviously a native Laristan currency nolonger existed. And so: one (Safavid) larl= 125
dinars = i j muhammadl =85turnan.2 In Hurmuz, which was under Portuguese rule in the 16th century, there were to be found in circulation at that time, besides larls, coins of a special dinar currency. In the middle of the 16th century they seemed to have stood tothe Safavid dinar currency ofthe same period in the ratio of 4:1. At the beginning of the 16th century there was a 100 dinar piece known as sadi, at that time theonly silver coin in thedinar currency of Hurmuz. The 1,000 dinar piece called the hazar was of gold and was also called the "half ashrafl". One ashrafl, called by the Portuguese "xerafim", was thus equivalent to 2,000 Hurmuz dinars. In 1550 hazars were also minted from silver. There was also a copper fals with anominal value of 10 dinars. Until Hurmuz became absorbed into the Safavid empire in 1622, the Hurmuz currency steadily depreciated. In Transoxiana, namely inthe Uzbek khanates, the tanga currency continued after the days ofthe Timurids; but it was accompanied for some time by the kapakl dinar currency. Rabino conjectures that the dinar currency in circulation in Khurasan in 15 90 was identical with the kapakl dinar currency and istobe traced back tothe period ofUzbek rule in Khurasan. Certainly at that time the value of the Khurasan tuman was less than that of the 'Iraqi (Tabriz) tuman of the Safavids by a
quarter.3 In the following exposition we follow Hinz, whose research into the
monetary system of Iran is of the highest importance.4 We can arrive at a useful value-index ofthe various currencies byexpressing them in terms of gold. Aprecondition for this isknowledge ofthe value ratio

of gold to silver — which was notthe same at all times. This ratio was discovered by collating and assessing many data concerning money from various sources. In the 14th century the ratio was 1:12; in the middle ofthe 16th century it was 1:10; in 1622 it was again 1:12. About 1660 the ratio rose to 1:13^ and by 1680 had reached the level of 1:15. In theearly 18th century theratio went back to 1:12. It is clear that when thegold value of silver fell, a silver coin of fixed weight lost in value, and vice versa.
Having taken these ratios into account, having assessed many parallel data concerning the nominal value ofdifferent coins and currencies, and having made use also of numismatic studies of monetary standards, we are at last ina position tomake a statement concerning the gold value ofthe coinages underlying the currencies. In the following tables, inaccordance with Hinz, we will express the gold value of Iranian currencies and coins bymeans of German Gold Marks on the pre-war standard of 1913. The price of one gram offine gold was then 2.81 Gold Marks. It should be noted that the equivalent of one German Gold Mark in English currency isone Gold Shilling;as far asFrench currency is concerned, 0.81 Gold Mark = 1 Gold Franc (all rates pre-war standard).

CHAPTER IO
THE EXACT SCIENCES IN TIMURID
IRAN
Throughout the four centuries preceding the rise of Tlmur, science had been actively cultivated in many parts of the Iranian plateau by practitioners who were in theforefronts of their respective disciplines. The dissipation of political power which attended the breakup of the 'Abbasid empire entailed also a dispersal of the scientists concentrated at Baghdad. But lines of inquiry opened by them were pursued by scholars supported at the various later dynastic centres. During this time trigonometry emerged as an independent branch of mathematics. The foundations of geometry were repeatedly re-examined, and steps were taken towards generalising the concept ofnumber; solutions were given for extensive classes of algebraic equations. Advances were made in mathematical geography, and in astronomy, both in theory and in observation. In optics, astart was made in explaining the phenomenon of the rainbow. It is the object of this chapter to give anaccount of the extent to which these activities were continued during thecenturyand a half between, say, 1350and 1500. In point of fact, most of what follows describes the accomplishments of one man,Jamshld Ghiyas al-Dln al-Kashi (d. 832/1429), working at one place, Ulugh Beg's Samarqand observatory, and in one subject, numerical analysis. The names of a number of other scientists at Samarqand are known, and many more can be assembled from other localities, but only the writings of Jamshld transcend competence and are contributions to knowledge. This somewhat narrow picture may be changed at anytime by the recovery of additional material. The ratio of scientific manuscripts studied to scientific manuscripts which exist is very low, though perhaps no lower for Timurid Iran than for Europe, or India, or the Far East. But meanwhile only what is known can be described. In what follows, modern mathematical symbols are used where convenient. There is no trace of this in the texts themselves; either the equivalent expressions are written out verbally or they must be inferred from the context.
568



DECIMAL FRACTIONS
DECIMAL FRACTIONS
If any system of representing numbers istobeused formajor computations, itisnecessary that itembody the notion of place value. This means that in the array of symbols which represents anyparticular number, the contribution of any individual symbol is determined not onlyby the symbol itself, butalso byitsplace in the array; forinstance, in the array 2027, thecontribution of one ofthe 2'sis two thousand, of the other, twenty. Only a finite number of different symbols is required, and this number iscalled the base ofthe system. The first place value system to be invented was the sexagesimal representation (base sixty), in Mesopotamia, sometime in thesecond millennium B.C. Much later the now familiar decimal system appeared in India. Both were known and used by Islamic scientists from 'Abbasid times on, but with inherited perversities which require explanation. Sexagesimals aswritten bythe Babylonians incorporated no device analogous to thedecimal point. It wasas though with us
2027 could mean 2027000 (=2027 X io3), or 20.27 ( = 2027 x io~2), or
.0002027 (2O27 x IO~7)> o r i u s t 2O27> o r this times any other powerof the base. Hence aset ofcuneiform numeral symbols (digits) may represent oneof many possible numbers, fractional or integer, and the reader must infer from the context which particular one the scribe had in mind. The Indian decimals, ontheother hand, were used onlyfor whole numbers (or common fractions), so that nodecimal pointwas called for,and therepresentation was unique. For themost part, theresults ofIslamic calculations were expressed neither in pure sexagesimals nor in pure decimals, butin a mongrel arrangement taken over from theGreeks. In it all symbols werealphabetical, the Arabic cognates of Greek letters. For the integer part of a number anon-place-value decimal system was used, the fractional part being in sexagesimals. Butwhen it was necessary to multiply, divide, or extract roots of these numbers, they would first be transformed into a decimal expression in Indian numerals having a denomination of the smallest sexagesimal fraction present in the original expression. For example, the symbols (read from right to left) ^ * «_J3 which may be transcribed as 120 5 53,stand for 120+
5/60+ 53/602. This number would beconverted into the form: 432353

result would be returned to the original alphabetical form, with
sexagesimal fractions.1 Pure sexagesimals were by no means unknown inIslamic writings; they are to be found particularly in chronological tables, wherethe spans of days between pairs of epochs are often very large. Neither were decimal fractions completely unknown. Several occur in the
4th/ioth century arithmetic of al-UqlldisI.2 The medieval Chinese,in computing the appearance of new moons, measured time in days and in units consisting of one ten-thousandth of a day. This special variety of decimal fraction was well-known toJamshld from his work with the
Chinese calendar.3 It may have suggested to him the notion of the decimal fraction in full generality, which he proceeded to describe and to apply inhis textbook ofarithmetic, the Miftab al-bisab. So far asis known he was the first to do this, and in so doing anticipatedthe
Fleming, Stevin, by almost two centuries.4 Jamshld noticed that a sexagesimal representation can be thought of as two sequences ofdigits proceeding inopposite directions from the units digit. Thus inthe representation
which may be transcribed as
4 34 25 9 48 56thirds
and which stands for
4 X 602 + 34 X 601 + 25 X 6o°+ 9 X 60-! + 48 X 60-2 + 56 X 60-3,
the sequence 9, 48, 56 yields the fractional part of the number, and 25, 34, 4 the integer part. He observed further that the decimal system is completely analogous tothe sexagesimal, and that to restrict the former to the writing ofintegers is to throw away, asit were, half the potential of the system. Therefore he adjoined a sequence of fractional digits tothe integer sequence togive, say,
2953871 decimal fourths,
where we would write
295.3871.
It is worth remarking that his notation giving the power of the base by

THE ^-COMPUTATION
which the rest of the representation is to bemultiplied (instead of a mark to setoff the fractional part) is precisely the "floating point" convention used nowadays inprogramming digital computers. Having established the theoretical basis for decimal fractions, Jamshld then went on todemonstrate their utility inthe computation of areas, volumes, andother geometric problems. He gave rulesand examples for converting common fractions into decimals, and conversely, andheworked out tables, still useful, forthe conversion of sexagesimals into decimals, and vice versa. The Miftah was widely disseminated inmanuscript copies. Thatits influence reached asfarasConstantinople isdemonstrated byanarithmetic written there, in Greek, sometime during the latter half of the 9th/15 th century. This book contains one worked example of multiplication and one ofdivision inwhich decimal fractions, converted from common fractions, are employed. The author ascribes the technique to "theTurks", andit is known that at least one of Jamshid'scolleagues at Samarqand, al-Qvishchl, eventually established himself in
Constantinople.1
THE 7t-COMPUTATION
The important number now universally called n,definable asthe ratio between the circumference and the diameter of any circle, has been an object of interest since thebeginning of mathematics. In a treatise devoted entirely to it, al-Risdla al-mubitiyya,Jamshid criticises the approximations to 7t made by various individuals. Heremarks, for instance, that the use ofArchimedes' value, the familiar 3}, tocalculate the earth's circumference in terms ofits radius would entail a possible inaccuracy offivefarsakhs. He therefore proposes tocompute n to such a degree ofprecision that ifit isused tocalculate the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 600,000 earth-diameters, theerror involved will be less than the smallest linear unit known tohim — the breadth of a horsehair. Presumably he chose this diameter as being that of the largest circle in theuniverse, a great circle onthesphere of the fixed stars. Byuse of the hierarchy of units between thehorsehair and the earth-diameter, heshows that the imposed condition demands anorder
of accuracy of 1/609 part of the result.

His method ofprocedure, like that ofall his predecessors, is to use the fact that if a regular polygon is inscribed in (or circumscribed about) a circle, the difference between the perimeter of the polygon and the circumference ofthe circle may be made arbitrarily small by sufficiently increasing the number ofsides ofthe polygon. From elementary geometric considerations, Jamshld adduces relations expressible (in modern symbols) as follows: Let a regular polygon beinscribed in a unit circle such that each side, an, subtends an arc an=6o°lz"~\ and let cn be thechord of the
supplement ofthis arc. Then, since ax =yJ $, the recursion relation
(0 '.=(* + '.-,)l/1
makes it possible tocalculate any desired cn by computing the second c in terms ofthe first, the third from the second, and soon. Moreover, the Pythagorean relation gives
and the perimeter, an approximation to z%,isthe product ofthe length
of a side, an, times the number ofsides, yzaBefore beginning the actual computation, Jamshld proceeds to determine how many iterations of (i) will be required to insure the degree of precision he has set himself, andto how many fractional sexagesimal places he must work. For this purpose, he makes a general estimate of the number of horsehairs which, laid side by side, will encircle the universe. And from this heconcludes that the angle sub
tended at the centre by a single hair is greater than 1/608 of a degree. Hence the required accuracy will be secured if the error isless than the latter. This condition is applied in the course of an involved sequence of inferences drawn from inequalities, and leading tothe conclusion that,
for a circle of radius sixty, an acceptable anmust be less than 8/604.
Thereupon Jamshld sets about successive halvings of 1200 to produce
the sequence of a's. Itturns out that a28 is less than 6°/6o4, and its chord, ^28; satisfies the condition given just above. The number ofsides inthe
inscribed polygon finally used is therefore 3-228 (=805,306,368). Inthe sexagesimal representation this number has sixdigits. This consideration, combined with the requirement that the result must have eight significant fractional digits leads to the conclusion that, with numbers obtained in the course of the computation, digits beyond the eighteenth may safely be neglected, a requirement which is infact unduly rigorous.

TRIGONOMETRIC TABLES
At this stage thecalculation proper cancommence. Themain part of it consists of twenty-eight square root extractions, each one of which takes up an elegantly laid out page of the manuscript. In order to maintain a running check of the operation as it progresses, each successive square root is squared, and the result compared with the radicand. The final result (in modern notation) is
27t = 6516,59,28,1,34,51,46,14,50,
where thecommas separate sexagesimal digits, and the semicolon is the "sexagesimal point". For the benefit of people who are unaccustomed to this base, Jamshld converts it into decimal fractions as
271 = 6.283 185 307 179 586 5,
correct to the last digit.
TRIGONOMETRIC TABLES
Trigonometry as an independent branch of mathematics was in large measure a creation of Muslim medieval astronomers. From the ninth century on, the standard trigonometric functions were made available in tables of continually increasing detail and precision. This trend reached its high point in Timurid Iran, and the function tables produced at the Samarqand observatory of Ulugh Beg are superior to all others of the time, a supremacy which wasretained for a century. The sine table alone in this set has a value for each minute of each degree up to ninety, hence 5,400 entries. Butthis number is doubled by the presence of a tabular difference (for each interpolation) for each entry. All of these are carried to five sexagesimal places, implying precision of the order of one to seven hundred million. These tables have been recalculated with electronic computers, and no error has been observed. Theother trigonometric ratios were tabulated in analogous fashion at Samarqand, as well as many of the special functions encountered in spherical astronomy. Implicit behind these masses of numerals is the knowledge of algorisms, computational schemes, which call for much more than patient and meticulous reckoning. An example is Jamshld's method of determining the sine of one degree to any desired accuracy, the algorism which underlies Ulugh Beg's sine table.

THE EXACT SCIENCES IN TIMURID IRAN
The solution is related to the classical Greek problem of trisecting an angle. Jamshld first derived a relation between the sine ofany angle and the sine of its third, which we may write as
(2) sin 30c = 3 sina —4 sin3a.
The sine ofthree degrees, as it happens, isnot difficult tocalculate,
by manipulating the functions of larger angles (like 300) which are even easier to find. Let x = sin 1° and put q= sin j°, assumed tobe known. Then (2) becomes
(3) * =
which transforms the problem into that of finding a number x satisfying the cubic equation (3). The first sexagesimal digit of this root was already known, from earlier tables. Call this digit dr; regard it as a first appproximation to the root, say xx =dv and try itout by substitution in
(3). Symbolically, put/(x) = (^ +4v3)/3, and calculate
where d2 is formed from r2by dropping off. all its sexagesimal digits save the first. Now regard d2 as a correction tod% and add the twoto obtain a better approximation to the root. I.e., put x2= x^+d2, and repeat the above process to find ady This means, form

until the desired precision is attained. This type ofiterative algorism was used many centuries before the time of Jamshld, and it is valid for categories of f(x) much more general than this particular polynomial. But his is aparticularly elegant example because the only operations involved are additions, subtractions, and multiplications. Furthermore, the process converges so fast
that each iteration pinches off one more digit in the final result.1

INSTRUMENTS - THE EQUATORIUM
COMPUTING INSTRUMENTS - THE EQUATORIUM
Throughout the Middle Ages a great variety of scientific instruments were invented and produced in the countries of Islam, and in Iran in particular. These included astrolabes of many types, quadrants, celestial spheres, sundials, and mechanical or graphical devices designed to accept numerical data and to solve certain categories of problems in instances where tedious computation could beeliminated. Most of the known instruments ofTimurid provenance are oftypes well known in previous periods. The one described briefly below, however, the equatorium invented by Jamshld al-Kashl, is in several ways unique. For a given planet and a given time, the problem ofdetermining its position in thecelestial sphere has been of interest since early times. The operation is reducible to twoparts: the determination of the planet's mean position, and the calculation of its "equation". Solution of the first part is simple indeed. The planet's motion is always in the vicinity of a fixed great circle called the ecliptic, and always generally forward on theecliptic, but sometimes moving faster than its mean velocity, sometimes slower, and sometimes even backwards. It is customary to imagine a point, the "mean planet", which travels with the mean motion of the actual planet, sometimes on one side or the other of it but never exceeding a fixed distance on either side.The position of the mean planet at any time may be found byadding to its position at some known epoch theproduct of the time elapsed since epoch and the mean velocity. The planet's equation at any time is the distance between the mean planet and the true planet at that instant; it is a measure of the irregularity ofthe true motion. The latter, inturn, iscaused primarily by two effects, arising from the common character of the earth's and the planet's orbits about thesun. We view theplanet from, as it were, a moving platform; hence its direction from us isaffected not only byits own travels around thesun, butalso by thechanging point of view afforded byour own annual trip about the same object. Furthermore, neither orbit is quite a circle, and both earth and planet travel faster when they are nearer the sun. The problem ofdetermining the equation istherefore a complicated one. Inmedieval times the most precise method ofsolving it was touse a pair of tabulated functions, the "equation of the centre", and the "equation ofthe anomaly", and to modify the entry obtained from the
575



THE EXACT SCIENCES IN TIMURID IRAN
one table byan involved interpolation procedure utilising the entry from the other table. Tables for determining the mean position, on the other hand, were very easy touse, since addition was the only operation required. A second method of solution would be to construct a scale model of the earth - sun - planet system, consisting essentially of the two orbits, the one being constrained tomaintain its proper position relative to the other. Points properly fixed on the orbits represent the respective celestial bodies. For any particular time, a straightedge passing from the earth to the planet would indicate the planet's true position at that instant. Athird way of solving the problem is tomake a scale drawing of the configuration as of the time inquestion, whereupon the vector drawn from the image of the earth to that of the planet would yield the desired position. Jamshld's planetary equatorium can be characterised as an ingenious combination of the three types of approach sketched above: numerical, mechanical, and graphical. Mean positions were to bedetermined by numerical tables; hence they constituted the initial data fed into the machine. Itconsisted essentially of a large circular plate surrounded by an annular ring, graduated all around in degrees inorder to serve asa
3600 protractor. There were two moving parts, a graduated alidade, pivoted at the centre ofthe plate, and a graduated ruler, arranged so that it and the alidade together could be operated asparallel rulers. They served totransfer angular distances back and forth between the plate, which was used as aplotting board, and the protractor. Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of the instrument as setup to give a true position for the planet Mars. For purposes ofsimplicity, most of the graduations and rulings ofthe actual instrument have been left off the drawing. Ofthe two orbits required foreach planet, one (called the deferent) was permanently engraved on the plate. The other (the epicycle) was never actually drawn, although itappears on our figure. The radius of the epicycle equals the segment CD on the alidade edge. By a rotation ofthe alidade, this length can betransferred to CD', thence displaced to EM. Without going into details, ittranspires that C can be regarded as the image of the earth and M that of Mars, whence the place where thealidade edge crosses theprotractor ring gives the required true position.Thus the device yielded quick results, accurate, say, to within ten minutes of arc. Since the main motive for calculating planetary positions was forthe casting of horoscopes, this degreeof precision was ample.
576



INSTRUMENTS - THE EQUATORIUM
Fig. i. A simplified representation of Jamshld's equatorium as set up to give a true longitude for the planet Mars.
The basic idea of the equatorium reaches back into Hellenistic times, and several were constructed in medieval Europe, one by the poet Chaucer. So far, however, Jamshld's version is the only example recovered from the lands of eastern Islam, and it is probably the most compact of all. In one respect it was far superior to others of its time in that it includes a method for determining planetary latitudes as well as longitudes. The orbital planes of the planets lie almost in the ecliptic plane, and no great error is involved in assuming that the planetary motions take place in the ecliptic, as was done above. The problem is then twodimensional and the motions are known as motions in longitude. In actual fact, however, the orbits diverge slightly from the ecliptic, and the amount of a planet's divergence at any time is called its latitude. The prediction of a latitude, since it adds a third dimension to the
577



THE EXACT SCIENCES IN TIMURID IRAN
problem, is inevitably difficult. By applying what later came to be known as descriptive geometry, Jamshid makes available to prospective users of his equatorium a graphical solution of the latitude problem.
OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY
The observatory founded at Samarqand in 833/1430 by the astronomer-prince Ulugh Beg worthily carried on the tradition established by the Buyid, the Saljuq and the Il-Khanid dynasties. The observatory building, occupying the top of a hillock some 21 metres high, was a three-storey cylindrical edifice about 46 metres in diameter. Theinstallation is dominated by an enormous mural instrument for measuring the altitudes of celestial bodies as they cross the meridian (fig. 2). It consists of an arc,in the meridian plane, and having a radius of about 40 metres. In order to make room for it, part of the arc was sunk into the ground between a pair of walls parallel to the meridian plane, and part was on masonry built up above ground level. The arc, or rather the narrow cylindrical surface which carries it, wascarefully graduated in fractions of degrees. At meridian transit, a ray from the sun, or any other object being observed, would pass through an orifice at the centre of the arc and fall on the graduations, giving the altitude directly. Extensive remains of the building and instrument have been excavated, and are much visited by tourists in the Soviet Union. The instrument is an extreme example of an attempt to gain precision by great size. Other instruments were in use there, but no complete listing can be given. There exists a letter by Jamshid written from Samarqand back home to his father in Kashan. In it he reports progress in the building of the observatory, saying that one armillary sphere had been completed, and that another was being made, as well as a diopter and an azimuth instrument with two quadrants. Both of the latter are types invented or elaborated upon at the Il-Khanid observatory at Maragha. Jamshid states further that before his arrival two massive brass rings had been cast, six cubits in diameter, to observe declinations after the manner of Ptolemy. He pointed out that the progress of the arthad shown this technique to be faulty, and the sultan ordered the rings broken up and the metal used for other instruments. Of other Timurid observatories we have no knowledge, norcan

much be said about actual observations. That the Samarqand observatory was used, follows from the fact that the stellar coordinates in the table of fixed stars in Ulugh Beg's Zij are, for the most part, the result of independent observations. Jamshld reports very completely three
579



THE EXACT SCIENCES IN TIMURID IRAN
lunar eclipses he observed at Kashan in 808/1406 and 809/1407.1 There is no evidence to suggest that the elaborate observatories characteristic of late Islamic astronomy produced results which would have been unobtainable with less massive equipment.
RECAPITULATION AND ASSESSMENT
One general conclusion is clear — that the activity which had given Iran pre-eminence in science from late 'Abbasid through Saljuq and Mongol times fell off markedly during the span of the Timurid dynasty. Steady and continuous progress had been made by Islamic mathematicians in the foundations ofmathematics, inthe solution of algebraic equations, and ingeometrical optics. No Timurid additions can be exhibited inthese fields, although competent practitioners continued to be plentiful. By way of contrast, vigorous work in trigonom
etry was now under way inCentral Europe, and further west Oresme2 was developing the concept offractional exponents. In one branch of mathematics, numerical analysis, brilliant work was done. Jamshld's computational algorisms exhibited afeel for elegance, precision, and control which had never been seen before, and which was not tobe surpassed for along time tocome. The situation is much the same in astronomy. Writings of the Maragha planetary theorists who later so strongly influenced Copernicus
were known and debated inthe group around Ulugh Beg.3 But the available work done atSamarqand is purely Ptolemaic, unaffected by the newer planetary models. The equatorium ofJamshld was matched by one turned out by a French contemporary of his, Fusoris. Whatever observations may have been made at Samarqand were less significant
than the many hundreds recorded at Nuremberg alone by Walther4 and his collaborators. Allthings considered, Iran's scientific output, though weakening, may have maintained herin a leading position through the 9th/15 th century. Thereafter, the lead passed clearly to the West.

CHAPTER I I
PERSIAN SCIENCE IN SAFAVID TIMES
One of the most distinguished European travellers drawn to Persia in Safavid times, SirJohn Chardin, records a native saying in these terms: "Le doute est le commencement de la science; qui ne doute de rien n'examine rien, qui n'examine rien ne decouvre rien, qui ne decouvre
rien est aveugle et demeure aveugle".1 Andhe goes on to place both Persian and Chinese science next to that of Europe in achievement, qualifying his statement by adding that certain theorems which are regarded as new in theWest are, in fact, to be found in thePersianand Arab books. ButChardin was impressed by the legacy of the past, for Islamic science, which hada strong Persian element, reached its zenith with Ibn Sina, al-Blrunl, 'Umar Khayyam, al-Khazinl, and al-Tusi, and, apart from a late burst of activity in Timurid times attributable to Ulugh Begand his school, was then in decline. Medicine alone continued to make newadvances.
There are, nevertheless, several influences which go to make this period in the history of science one of peculiar interest. Persia was a place of exchanges in ideas rather than a focus of original discovery. The protracted and bitter struggle between the Safavid monarchs and the Ottoman Turks, in the course of which the Persians became familiar with embassies from European courts, and Anthony Sherley is said to have suggested to Shah 'Abbas I an alliance with the Christian powers, not only generated an interest in technology, for the shah's armies were initially deficient in the heavier weapons of war; it also enabled Persia to know something of the scientific revolution which was gaining in momentum andinfluence in western Europe. Hertraditional Islamic science, with a few Chinese accretions absorbed inthe years of Mongol dominion, would soon be exposed to a discipline which might be called world science, for Persia was no longer in isolation from the effects of experimental method and the interpretation of its results in terms of mathematical analysis. Lest we beinclined, however, to exaggerate this impact upon thenative science and culture, we are corrected at once by a predominant regard for the

established authors from Ulugh Beg and al-TvisI right back toGalen, Ptolemy, Apollonius, and Euclid; by the perfection in Safavid times of the workmanship and art of the astrolabe, the favourite portable astronomical instrument ofmedieval Islam; by the persistence and further development ofa medical tradition which owed much to India; and, not least, bythe dead hand of orthodoxy. What the exhaustion and ravages ofwar failed to obliterate, the zealots ofthe Shl'I faith strove to deny. In the struggle between the divine and the secular sciences the Legalities were inthe ascendant, the Accomplishments indecline. To quote Mlrza Muhammad Qazvini on the Safavids: "... under this dynasty learning, culture, poetry and mysticism completely deserted
Persia...".1 For two centuries there was a dearth of creative minds inliterature, and many scholars perished in the siege of Isfahan in 113 4-5/1722. The torch of learning which had burned brightest at the court of the ageing Sultan Husain Balqara in Herat in the early ioth/i6th century now reappeared, rekindled at the Mughal court in Delhi, where thinkers and writers gathered from Persia under the liberal patronage of Humayiin. Indeed it is from Persia's nearest neighbours, India and Turkey, that one may glean information which throws further light upon the condition of Persian science as well. This isnot so surprising when it is realised that mathematics (riydqiyjat), natural science (tabt'iyydf) and metaphysics (ma vara,or md ba'd, al-tabi'ai) together comprised philosophy, and that in traditional Islamic science there was a strong a priori tendency inherited from the Greeks. Alchemy and astrology were still powersto be reckoned with, and times were harsh onthose whose predictions failed to meet royal approval; but then it was not so different in Elizabethan England. It is impossible, as it was in medieval Latin Christendom, to sever science as a separate discipline from thewhole corpus of learning, and at the courts of both Shah 'Abbas II in Isfahan and Akbar in Delhi there were poets who were physicians and physicians who were poets. Francis Bacon in England had still to ring the bell that gathered all the other wits together and so point the new way to scientific discovery. This period was one of transition in the West and, to alesser extent, in Persia; thus it isnecessary toevaluate the forces for change against a stable background of tradition.

EMISSARIES, AMBASSADORS, AND MISSIONS
EMISSARIES, AMBASSADORS, AND CATHOLIC MISSIONS
Snippets ofscientific information may be collected from the accounts of European travellers, many of whom settled and worked in the service of the shah. Thus, "Master Jeffrey Ducket, agent for the Muscovie companie" writes c. 15 74: "They have few bookes and lesse learning, and are for the most part very brutish inall kind ofgood sciences, savingin some kind of silke workes, and in such things as pertaine to the furniture
of the horses, inwhich they are passing good".1 Don Juan (Uruch Beg),
who knew both Persia and the Catholic West, speaks2 of "great numbers of water-wheels all along the banks of the rivers and lagoons, these being made after the fashion of the water-wheels andmills we seeon the Tagus", and adds that armour ofthin steel plate "cunningly forged" is made in large quantity andsome "exported into Muscovy". On the subject ofmedicine hesays: "In the matter ofcuring disease they do as with other nations of the barbarians, using herbs and ordering a strict diet. In acute illnesses, such asin cases ofquinsy, pleurisy and the like, they bleed. The people are very superstitious, being given to regarding auguries, and imagine that by praying in the mosque they can favourably affect, or at least prognosticate, the issue of all their maladies."The writer knew of the splendours of Isfahan, its six hundred caravansaraisat the entrance gates and its three hundred hammdms, and the stable system of communications in thereign of Shah 'Abbas theGreat (995— 1038/ 15 87-1629). William Parry, who accompanied Sir Anthony Sherley on his Persian travels in 1598-9, obviously makes a superficial observation when hesays: "They are nolearned nation, but ignorant in allkind of liberal or learned sciences..." andtheir writing is "asa wild kind of
scribbling that hath therein neither form nor matter".3 In fact, the Sherley brothers were bent upon diplomacy and military affairs, sothat we learn only about the technology of ordnance. Abel Pincon, also in the suite ofAnthony Sherley, relates that the Persians had only a heavy armoured clothing and no artillery save that left behind by theOttoman Sultan Selim I in 920/1514. However, this statement has to be considered in relation to onemade by DonJuan, to the effect that when the Turks of Sultan Murad .Tilheld the fortress of Tabriz in

PERSIAN SCIENCE IN SAFAVID TIMES
993/1585 the Persians brought up two immense siege-guns whose bore at the open end "spanned a yard [bara] across, the length of the barrel
being five yards".1 Moreover, cannon seem to have been captured also from theTartars, whilst at the height of his power Shah 'Abbas I appears to have drawn to his allegiance men who had deserted the
Turks and were competent tomanufacture new ones. Creasy2 emphasises the undoubted superiority ofthe Turks in military engineering, but itmay well be that after the encounter with the Sherleys the Persian artillery improved somewhat as a result ofEuropean contact: and this contact was maintained, for Philippe Colombe, aFrenchman, in charge of Persian ordnance under Shah Sultan Husain, was killed in the battle of Gulnabad in 1134/1722. The immediate result ofcooperation with Anthony Sherley, who is said tohave brought a "gun-founder" in his company and to have shown the shah books containing "models of fortifications", is summed upin anexaggerated manner in the wellknown quotation:
The mighty Ottoman, terror ofthe Christian World, quaketh ofa Sherley
fever, and gives hopes of approaching fate. The prevailing Persian hath
learned Sherleian arts of war, and hewhich before knew not the use of
ordnance, hath now 500 pieces ofbrass, and 6,000 musketeers; so that they
which at hand with the sword were before dreadful to the Turkes, now also in
remoter blows and sulphurian arts are grown terrible.3
It is now clear that this statement cannot be taken at its face value, and that a more sober view should prevail: Savory gives first credit to the Portuguese and the Continental gunners in their service. A still later English traveller, who was in Persia on the death of Shah 'Abbas I and who published his account some four years after returning to London, was Thomas Herbert. His comments on the state of Persian science are a useful general summary. Writing of the physicians, he says:
So well as I could apprehend, these are learned in the sciences, and few but are philosophers: nevertheless, their libraries are small; their books usually Arabic, but choice and useful, commonly such asadvance their practice and profession; and in their proper art Iperceived that they prefer plants and other vegetables before minerals...They are masters of much knowledge and nota little delighted with judicial astrology. Many Arabic writers, learned both in

natural philosophy and the mathematics, haveflourishedin those parts, most of whose books they read, namely Hippocrates, Galen, Averroes, Alfarabius, Avicenna, Ben-Isaac, Abbu-Ally, Mahummed-Abdilla, Ben-Eladib, Abu-beer,
Rhazis, Algazzallys, and Albu-mazar."1
Of the cities, Herbert says that Shiraz "has a college wherein is read philosophy, astrology, physic, chemistry, and themathematics; so as
'tis themore famoused through Persia",2 whilst in Isfahan "Within the Maydan the shops"... show "greater variety of simples and ingredients of medicines than ever I saw together in any one city of Europe; and such as may give encouragement to physicians both to
view and judge ..."3 He also refers to the source of assafoetida as the region around Lahore and the River Indus, and remarks onthe prevalence of mulberry forests for the rearing of the silkworm in the northern parts ofthe country (Persia). Like other travellers he notices in thepeople the veneration oftradition, such as adherence to the lunar calendar, and the general lack of enthusiasm for invention and innovation. Without doubt our most valuable informant is Chardin. Knowledgeable in science, he gives theonly systematic account of its condition in Safavid times. His travels took him toPersia in 1666, when he was inIsfahan on the death ofShah 'Abbas II, then toIndia, and back again to Persia in 1669. He returned to Paris in 1670 but was soon once more on his way to Persia, where he arrived in 1672 and stayed for four years. Finally hecame to England, and was made Court Jeweller by Charles II, was knighted in 1681, and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society a year later. According toChardin, the Persians "have a ready disposition to Sciences, andto theLiberal and Mechanick Arts ..." Astronomy and astrology are the most cultivated, especially since the latter affords an infallible key tothe future. There are numerous astrologers in the capital Isfahan, and "the most celebrated originate from Corasson, where there isa little town called Genabad, and one illustrious family, noted for astronomy. The King draws his court astrologers only from Genabad, which has aschool for training all the astronomers of Persia. In this region ofancient Bactria and Sogdiana, between the rivers Oxus and Jaxarte, where the air is pure, dry, and still, there have
flourished for sixhundred years themost competent astronomers."4

PERSIAN SCIENCE IN SAFAVID TIMES
Chardin also has a chapter entitled "Of the Trees, Plants, and
Druggs", for "Persia isa perfect Country for Physical Druggs";1 and he goes on torelate an amusing story concerning the rivalry between astrologers and physicians atthe Court:
Les astrologues sont toujours pleins de jalousie contre les medecins, comme
egalement puissans, riches etrecherches; c'est aqui aura la faveur; les mede
cins veulent agir selon les phenomenes des maladies, etdonner la-dessus les
remedes de l'art; les astrologues s'y opposent, et disent qu'il faut consulter les
phenomenes celestes, pour savoir s'il est bon de prendre medecine, lorsqu'on
en veut donner, et si l'operation en sera heureuse. Je me souviens d'avoir ou'i
dire a un astrologue a ce sujet: "Notre condition est bien differente de celle des
medecins, dans l'exercice de notre profession. Car, siun astrologue fait une
faute, le ciel la decouvre; mais si un medecin en fait une, quelque peu de terre
la couvre.2
Chardin records that the recognised authorities in science, who were highly regarded in Persia, were for astronomy and mathematics Ptolemy, formathematics Archimedes, Euclid, Theodosius, Autolycus, Menelaus, and Apollonius, and for medicine Hippocrates and Galen; whilst inastronomy the leading native exponents were Abu'lHusain 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Umar al-Sufl (d. 376/986), Naslr al-Dln
TiisI, Mahmud Shah Khaljl,3 and Mlrza Ulugh Beg assisted by Jamshld Ghiyas al-Dln al-Kashi, Qazlzada al-Ruml, and 'All b. Muhammad al-Qushchl. Reliance upon tradition and established practice was widespread. Thus Chardin notes the retention ofthe original observations in al-SufTs star maps and, despite a knowledge ofother instruments, the almost universal popularity of the astrolabe. He further adds to his list inastronomy and mathematics al-Ma'mun, al-Kindl, al-Farisi, and 'Umar Khayyam, and mentions Abu'1-Wafa' particularly foralgebra, al-Farabl for music and medicine, one "Ayran" (perhaps Ibn alHaitham) for optics, and Abu'1-Fida for geography. As inthe quadrivium ofmedieval Latin Christendom there was inIslam a tradition of Euclidian geometry inwhich the straight line accounted for phenomena in optics, gnomonics, and perspective, whilst number ratios united mathematics with music. Of their libraries Chardin says that none exceeded four hundred volumes, and compared with those ofEurope

ASTRONOMY AND RELATED SCIENCES
"c'est une mouche aupres d'un elephant",1 whilst dependence upon the Ancients does not make many books nor many discoveries. When inIsfahan Chardin lodged with the Superior ofthe Capuchin Order and obtained information on the astrolabe from the most famous maker, Muhammad Amln, who is remembered by two extant instruments dated 1086/1675—6 and 1097/1685—6. Chardin refers to him as the son of the astrologer Mulla Hasan 'All, but this son was
KhalU Muhammad, known by nineteen extant astrolabes.2 The distinguished Capuchin was Pere Raphael du Mans (Jacques Dutertre), who had accompanied Jean-Baptiste Tavernier to Isfahan and was helpful
also to Thevenot and toChardin.3 He compared the Persian theory of the astrolabe with that ofJean Stoefflerin, whose Elucidatio fabricae ususque astrolabii had appeared in 1513, and Regiomontanus, and found them similar; according to Chardin's report the Persian version was the better and more accurate, being neater geometrically. A mathematician of note, Du Mans was held in high regard byShah 'Abbas II andby Shah Sulaiman in turn. The first mission in Isfahan was Augustinianin
1602-3, a n ^ t n e last ofthe Catholic orders toestablish itself there was the Jesuit in 1653. Contemporary Jesuit influence inChina inthe field of astronomy is significant, and there was a period when Chinese scholars knew of the telescope and of the heliocentric theory of Copernicus; in fact, the China Mission had already collaborated with native scientists to produce, between 1629 and 1635, acompendium on astronomy and the calendar entitled Chhung-Chen Li Shu. But we have as yet no record ofsuch fruitful scientific cooperation between Jesuits and Persians at that time, though there is little doubt that both Iran and Turkey were gradually coming under the influence ofWestern science and technology, as we shall see from the next section.
ASTRONOMY AND RELATED SCIENCES
Islamic astronomy during the Safavid period lies at the end ofa long tradition ofgeometrical representation, characterised mainly by the study of shadows cast upon surfaces by objects placed in the rays of the sun and by stereographic projections ofheavenly bodies upon a circular plate (the astrolabe), and culminating intheobservatories ofJai Singh II in India at a time when the telescope hadfound general

acceptance in Europe, thereby ushering in the optical period, and when Greenwich Observatory was beginning its regular observations. Professor Kennedy has already enlarged upon the achievementsof Timurid Iran in the previous chapter. The great Muslim institutions at
Maragha and Samarqand had had a short life and were now inruins,1 but they were perpetuated by their observational records, Zij-i Il-Khani (Y.670/1271) andZij-i jadtd-i Sultani, which according to 'Abd alMun'im al-'Amill (f.970/1562-3) were the tables ofUlugh Beg, completed in 841/1437. Versions of the latter tables, which were widely disseminated, appeared in Persian, Arabic and Turkish, and reached Oxford in the time of Charles I, whilst the fame of the gigantic meridian arc, which was the central instrument on the Samarqand site, being over 120 feet inradius, had spread tothe astronomers inIstanbul and to a visiting Englishman, John Greaves. Efforts at emulation by the Safavid monarchs came to nothing. Shah Isma'Il I, founder of the dynasty, planned to restore theMaragha observatory and charged Amir Ghiyas al-Dln Mansiir b. Amir Sadr al-Dln Muhammad alShlrazI (d.949/1542—3) with this task. Muslim astronomers had long considered, however, that to compile an adequate set of star tables would require extended observations over a period of thirty years corresponding with the revolution ofSaturn, so Isma'Il abandoned the project. His successor Tahmasp I (930—984/1524—1576) also had a scheme tobuild an observatory ina hall of the royal palace at Isfahan with the object of bringing the tables up to date, but this again failed to materialise. However, a valuable manuscript written in connection with the project as Isfahan survives, and describes the design of instru
ments previously used at Alexandria, Maragha and Samarqand.2 A word ofexplanation isrequired here concerning the brief life of Islamic observatories. There certainly were individual scientists who pursued their investigations for the sake of knowledge itself, as is clear from the prefaces to their writings, but the ruling powers had no such ideals, and the policies ofthe Safavid monarchs were dictated by expediency and the value attached to astrological speculation; thus the observatory was set up as a temporary institution for a restricted programme of work. Nevertheless, the Islamic observatory represents an

important phase inthe history ofastronomy, and - inthe absence of a Persian example - it is worth adding a few remarks about the contemporary Turkish building erected on a height overlooking the Tophane quarter of Istanbul from the south. TaqI al-Dln Muhammad al-Rashid b. Ma'ruf, the director, who was also the author ofa long account ofthe
rectilinear propagation, reflection and refraction of light,1 predicted that the comet of 985/1577 would bring good fortune to Sultan Murad III in his campaign against the Persians, so the observatory was completed in that year, and with the object of rectifying outdated astronomical tables. In its construction "Venetian Ducats were spent like sand", whilst the endeavours ofthe staff appear tohave been crowned with success:
Sultan (to TaqI): Have you untangled knots from the firmament ina hair
splitting manner? TaqI (to Sultan): In the Zlj of Ulugh Bey
There were many doubtful points, oh exalted King;
Now through observations the tables have been
corrected....2
There was an elaborate main building, with offices and alibrary, but with the large instruments mounted in the open. A smaller building nearby housed quadrants, anastrolabe, clepsydras, a terrestrial globe showing Africa, Asia, andEurope, andvarious geometrical instruments; such a small-scale observatory perhaps contained pilot instruments, but in any event it was not short of staff, four or five men being assigned to one instrument, two or three as observers, one as a recorder of readings, and the last for miscellaneous duties. We areindebted to the poet 'Ala' alrDin al-Mansur for more detailed information about the work carried out. Thus he speaks ofan armillary spherefor determining the latitudes andlongitudes of stellar bodies; a mural quadrant for finding the declination of the sun and other "distances" from the equator; a large azimuthal quadrant forazimuths and elevations; awooden or ruler-quadrant with two sights for investigating the motions ofMercury and Venus as well as determining angles ofelevation and zenith "distances"; a parallactic ruler forall angles of elevation and the parallax of the moon; "an instrument with two holes" for studying apparent diameters ofheavenly bodies and the phenomena of eclipses; "an instrument with cords" todetermine the positions ofthe

equinoxes, said to have been invented by Taql al-Din to replace the equinoctial armilla; and finally al-mushabbaha bi'l manatiq.This was an invention of Taql al-Din, based on Ptolemy's Almagest, whose purpose is not quite clear. al-Mansiir writes of it:
Moreover, with the help of the mushabbaha, And thanks to very carefully made observations, The radius of Venus' epicycle, in the third firmament, Became known with great precision...;
and of the sUnaidl ruler, anda mechanical clock with a train of cogwheels,
With the help of careful measurements and corrections made
with the clock, The ascensions of stellar bodies were fixed,
And with the firm and specially chosen ruler,
That wonderful ruler to which the astronomers give the name "sanidi"! All the symbols and signs of astronomical instruments
Became extremely accurate.2
A comparison of the Istanbul instruments of Taql al-Din with those of Tycho Brahe inEurope has been made by Miss Sevim Tekeli, and of those common to both astronomers the mural and azimuthal quadrants long used in Islam were then new to Europe, whilst the large fixed wooden or ruler-quadrant made byTycho antedated bysome years that of Taql. Both used staircases to take readings. Itis clear that there was a good deal of intellectual commerce between Turkey andthe West, and also, despite crippling wars, with Persia, and that what we have described for the Istanbul observatory would have applied largely to any such establishment which might have arisen further east, even to Mughal India. Whilst the mechanical clock from Europe had entered the Ottoman observatory torival the water-clock inthe recordingof duration, Islamic scientific information and ideas were percolating slowly westwards through Elia Misrachi (1456—15 26), who travelled to Basle, and Regiomontanus when ona scientific mission to Hungary. The Islamic hypothesis of solid spherical shells wasadopted by Peurbach. In fact, Sayih remarks that "it seems probable that the

sudden rise in the level of astronomical work inEurope with Peurbach
and Regiomontanus was the result of contacts with Eastern Islam".1 Again, theKassel Observatory of Landgrave Wilhelm IV of Hesse (1532—92), the first European institution comparable with the Islamic ones, was a royal observatory as its predecessors inMuslim lands had been. Of these latter Samarqand had greatest influence upon the West: Maragha was rather too early, Istanbul perhaps rather too late. In this connection we must recall the name ofJohn Greaves. Greaves was one of those enterprising gentlemen associated with the rise of science in 17th-century England. Elected Professor of Geometry at Gresham College in 1630, hebecame interested in Islamic science, and encouraged by Archbishop Laud he left London seven years later in the company of the orientalist Edward Pococke with instruments to make astronomical observations and money to purchase books - in particular, the tables of Ulugh Beg. He collected in Istanbul in 1638, and went onto Alexandria and Cairo (where hesays hefound little), leaving Egypt in 1639 with his assembled manuscripts in Greek, Arabic and Persian. He had left Pococke in Istanbul with instructions to look for further scientific manuscripts. Back in England after alapse of three years, he was to find himself deprived ofhis Gresham professorship through long absence and failure to deliver lectures. However, in 1643 we observe him occupying the Savilian chair ofAstronomy at Oxford, where he settled down to the study of his oriental acquisitions. According to John Ward, Greaves collected five Persian manuscripts of the Samarqand Tables, translated them into Latin, and deposited the copy of his final revision with Archbishop Usher. "But Mr. Thomas Hyde of Queen's College in Oxford notknowing this, made a new version of them, which hepublished with the original, and a learned
commentary, at Oxford 1665, quarto."2 Ejected from his Oxford professorship, with his rooms ransacked, by the Parliamentary visitorsin 1648, Greaves finally retired to London to work onhis writings, and died there in 1652 inhis fiftieth year. Further attention has been directed tothe problem of transmission, this time from West to East, bya letter written in 1624 to a Persian, one Zain al-Din al-Lari, by the Italian traveller Pietro della Valle, who had spent several years in Persia. It relates to Tycho's system of the world and tothe discoveries made with the Galilean telescope, andits

importance has recently been emphasised by apaper of Dr Aydin Sayih entitled "An early seventeenth century Persian Manuscript on the Tychonic System". As in the medieval quadrivium of Latin Christendom, the mathematical sciences in Safavid Persia were closely integrated by a common body of knowledge. Whilst accretions from further east were Sanskrit,
transmissions to theWest were Turkish. TheTabaq al-mandtiq,x a planetary calculating device invented in Timurid times by Jamshld Ghiyas al-Dln al-Kashl (d. 832/1429?), inspired a similar instrument which is described in an early ioth/i6th century risala dedicated to Sultan Bayezld II. It will also be remembered that a colleague of al-Kashl at the Samarqand observatory, 'All b. Muhammad al-Qiishchl, established himself finally in Istanbul. Inevitably and deservedly, the fame of the Samarqand astronomers and mathematicians spread. Al-Kashl's textbook of arithmetic, Miftdh al-bisdb,in which,
according to Kennedy,2 he anticipated Stevinus of Bruges by two centuries inthe exploitation ofdecimal fractions, was widely disseminated through Turkey. From Mughal India came Persian versions of the Li/awati and Vtja-ganitaofBhaskara Acharya, spreading the now common processes of decimal arithmetic and the solution of algebraic equations which had reached their final form with the Hindus in the 12th century. There were many writers of astronomical manuals in Persia: Mlrza QazI b. Kashif al-Dln Muhammad Yazdl (d. at Ardabll in 1075/i664-5), Shaikh al-Islam, whose father had been aphysicianto Shah 'Abbas I, compiled a practical handbook of astronomy under the title Tuhfa-yi 'Abbdsiyya. One of the best known of these writers was Baha' al-Dln Muhammad b. Husain al-'Amill (d. at Isfahan in 1031/1622), who was the author of Tashrih al-afldk,a work on astronomy inArabic which was followed by Persian commentaries; Tuhfa-yi Hdtimt, a short treatise on the astrolabe, dedicated to Mlrza Hatim Beg, vizier of Shah 'Abbas I; another very short composition in Arabic entitled al-Saftha, brief enough to be inscribed on theplate of an astrolabe; and a successful Arabic compendium of arithmetic, Khuldsat al-bisdb, which inspired commentaries in both Persia and India (e.g., Arcot, 1696) and was later printed with the Tuhfa-yi Hdtimi (Tehran 1316/1898-9). An emigrant toIndia, Muhammad 'AH "Hazln" JllanI

(b. in Isfahan in 1105/1692, d. in Benares in 1180/1766), composed a work onthe elements of astronomy, Risd/a dar hai'at, near the endof his life. Indian mathematical influences are represented principally by Persian translations and commentaries onthe first two sections ofthe Siddhdnta-siromani, a Sanskrit astronomical treatise completed around 1150 byBhaskara Acharya of Bldar in the Deccan. An edition of the opening section, Lildwati, dealing with arithmetic and geometry, was prepared in 995/1587 for Akbar by "Faizi", a poet and scholar and brother of the emperor's chief minister Abu'1-Fazl; whilst the second section, Vija-ganita, relating toalgebra, was rendered inPersian under the title Bij ganit, anddedicated to Shah Jahan in 1044/1634— 5,by 'Ata'-Allah "Rushdl". "Rushdl" also wrote Khuldsa-jird^, a metrical work on arithmetic, algebra, and mensuration which eulogised Shah Jahan and Prince Dara Shukiih (to whom it was dedicated). "Rushdl", "Muhandis" and Nur-Allah "Mi'mar" were the three sons of Nadir al-'asr ustad Ahmad-i mi'mar-i Lahauri, thedistinguished architect, who also had two grandsons and a great-grandson to perpetuate this tradition ofscience and learning. Lutf-Allah "Muhandis", "Rushdl's" younger brother, is known for his Arabic commentary on the Khuldsat al-hisdb ofBaha' al-Din (mentioned above) and a Persian translation of al-Suffs famous book on the fixed stars, al-Kitdb suwar al-kawdkib. Incidentally, this last serves toemphasise the long-continued reverence for the masters oftraditional Islamic astronomy.
This Muslim tradition in astronomy, reaching its peak in Samarqand, was perpetuated by theMughal emperors, and came to its close with the observatories erected at Delhi, Jaipur, Mathura (Muttra), Benares, andUjjain, by Raja Jai Singh Sava'I, whohad served Aurangzlb andhis successors as a military commander. His tables Zij-i jadid-i Muhammad Shdht, completed in 1140/1728, were compiled with the object ofcorrecting the earlier Zij-i Ulugh Beg,Zij-i Khdqdni,andtashildt composed for Akbar by Mulla Chand and for Shah Jahan by Mulla Farid. Mulla Farld al-Din Mas'ud b. Ibrahim Dihlavl, Astronomer Royal to Shah Jahan, had completed in 1039/1629 his Zij-i Shah Jahdni, based on Ulugh Begand in the same format, and calculated for 1041/1631—2 in the new era Tarlkh-i Ilahl-yi Shah Jahanl.
Spherical trigonometry of the celestial sphere was equally valuable in terrestrial problems, such as the determination of the latitudes of

cities and of the azimuth of the qibla (the direction of Mecca). The northern hemisphere had been divided into seven climates {haft iqlim) according to a specific definition by latitude: thus, the first climate comprised regions having a maximum daylight of 127 to 13-^ hours, the second climate those having a maximum daylight of 137 to 137 hours, and so on. Most %Jjdt listed the geographical coordinates of cities, since apparent celestial positions are affected by the geographical position ofthe observer, and these appeared inscribed inthe umm of astrolabes. But there is a dearth of information on cartography. After the maps ofthe Arab al-ldrlsl in mid-6th/i2th century Norman Sicily, which superseded the medieval monastic maps and persistedin their influence for four hundred years, no maps appear from the Islamic world until the rise, of Ottoman Turkey as a maritime power. The Turks were keen to amass geographical knowledge and obtained it either at first hand, asfrom the admiral Plrl Re'is, who presented charts of the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean and Black Sea to Sultan Selim in 927/1521 and had personal experience of the Indian Ocean and the China Sea, or from the scholars and cosmographers, such as Katib Chelebl (Hajjl Khalifa), the famous medical bibliographer, who translated inthe mid-nth/17th century the Atlas Minor of Mercator and other European geographical works and drew upon Persian sources for his Jihdn-numd. These latter included a Turkish version, made during the reign of Sultan Murad III (9821003/1574-95), of a Persian Qdnun-nama, written bya merchant and dedicated to Sultan Selim I in 1516, a Risdla of Ghiyas al-Dln al-Naqqash, the painter, who was sent by the Timurid Shah Rukh to the emperor ofChina in 822/1419, and another Persian work, entitled Khitdi-ndma, by Sayyid 'All Akbar-i Khita'I, who spent about three years (1505-8) in China. Persia was the intermediary through which knowledge of China passed westwards tothe Turks and belatedly to Europe, asforexample through the work of Banakiti (fl. 717/1317), of which the eighth section, on China, was translated in 1677; and this knowledge helps to supplement our meagre information concerning the period between Marco Polo and the Jesuits; whilst there is clear evidence of transmission in the opposite direction, e.g. Islamic influences upon Chinese porcelain of the early ioth/i6th century. Following upon early Arab cartography, there is only one Persian map of the world extant, sofaras I know, and this is in an English

version derived from some unknown Persian author.1 The impetus to the study of cartography which was provided in Turkey by her maritime exploits, and the enthusiastic translation of European geographies into Turkish, appear to have aroused no parallel activity in Persia.
THE ASTROLABE
Perhaps the most persistent feature of Safavid astronomy is the popularity of the astrolabe. The earliest dated instrument from Isfahan is one made by Ahmad and Muhammad b. Ibrahim in 374/984 (now in the Museum of the History of Science at Oxford), whilst in that same city seven hundred years later fine astrolabes were being produced by a number of distinguished astronomers and craftsmen. Astrolabes were fashioned in the royal workshops (buyutaf),and to make and decorate one's own instrument became a work of art; Chardin remarks on the fact that an astronomer was not regarded as a learned man who did not know how to make his own instruments, and "parmi le commun peuple meme, chacun garde son astrolabe
comme un bijou".2 Derek J. Price has made an interesting study of the chronological distribution of astrolabes, which shows pronounced activity around the periods which gave birth to each new set of astronomical tables, whilst a great "peak" in the number of Western astrolabes around the year 1580 is seen to be followed by a lesser "peak" (rather more than half in number) of Eastern astrolabes a little later than 1700. This last phase coincides with the activity of Persian, Moorish and Mughal craftsmen which went on almost unabated from the mid-17th century to 1800, and embraces the outstanding achievements of 'Abd al-A'imma the younger in Persia and of the Allahdad family in Lahore. Price writes of the late activity in Islam during the period 1650-1750 as being in many ways a retransmission back from Europe of the popularity of the instrument. Such may well be one of the factors, but Persian craftsmen, with their long tradition, had no need of such a stimulus, whilst there were other influences: outside of the observatories, the portability and the reference data it supplied made the astrolabe popular, to the exclusion of almost all other instruments, with a people much taken with astrology. And again, this Persian renaissance of the astrolabe simply reflects in metalwork the artistic

creativity of an age which produced worthy successors to Bihzad in miniature painting and reared those visionaries who conceived the gems of Mughal architecture in India. Space forbids a full discussion of the theory of the astrolabe;an account by the present writer appeared in 1951 inthe journalEndeavour,but for acomplete treatment itis necessary to consult the article by Willy Hartner (in the Survey ofPersian Art) or the treatise byHenri Michel. Chardin devotes a chapter to the theory and construction of the instrument as he understood them in Isfahan, and adds a geometri
cal illustration.1 It will suffice tosay here that ofthe two faces ofthe plate (umm or mater) of the plane astrolabe, one carried the alidade or sighter, used to determine stellar "altitudes", and secured to the centre of the plate by pin and horse; whilst the other face, together with a number ofadditional thin brass discs {safd'ih)which could be placed singly over the central pin, enabled theoretical calculations to be made. Of these discs, the 'ankabut or rete, or spider (because of its open-work design), indicated the ecliptic, the signs of the zodiac, and by means of sha%ayd, orpointed "branches", the positions of important fixed stars. In the case of a given latitude the face of the mater, acting as adisc or saftha, represented the appropriate stereographic projection of the heavens upon the equator, whilst the 'ankabut moving over itgave the path of the fixed stars around the north pole of the heavens. As an instance of the encyclopaedic value of the instrument we may refer to examples
recently sold in London. ASafavid astrolabe2 inscribed with the name Sayyid RadI al-Dln Muhammad b. Sayyid 'All al-Husainl, but undated, carried on the 'ankabut twenty-six named stars, and had five safa'ih which showed hour lines, Babylonian hours as well as almucantars,
azimuths, and unequal hour lines, for latitudes 220,250,300,32°,340,350,
370, and 3 8°, and atablet of horizons. In the umm itself was a gazetteer of longitudes and latitudes and inhiraf (for defining the azimuth of the qibla ofthirty-one towns, and the longitude and latitude for a further twenty-four towns. On the other face of the umm, over which rotated the alidade, was a sine graph, arcs of the signs of the zodiac with azimuths ofthe qibla, for Isfahan, Yazd, Herat, and two other places (illegible), a shadow square (containing also an astrological table), and a zodiac scale with the faces of the planets and other astrological data.

THE ASTROLABE
It may be noted here that sometimes there is a cotangent scale as well as a sine graph, and an astrological table giving, in addition to the signs of the zodiac and the planets, the twenty-seven or twenty-eight mansions of the moon. This instrument, probably from the time of Shah Sultan Husain, was 14.7 cm in diameter, about the usual popular size. An
Indo-Persian astrolabe, in the same catalogue1 and "inscribed in the blessed city of the port of Surat on the 13th of the holy month Muharram, year 1081 of the Hijra" (2 June 1670), carried on the front an 'ankabut for fifty-five stars, six safa'ih, some Italian hour lines being shown, and inside the umm a gazetteer of longitude and latitude for sixty-seven places; whilst on the back were engraved declination scales for the alidade, a zodiac and calendar scale giving Syrian solar months, a sine and cosine graph with arcs of sines and versed sines, arcs of the signs of the zodiac with a line of the sun's meridian altitude for latitude 2i°3o' (suitable for Surat or Mecca), cotangent scales, and a shadow square within which was a table of the seven "climates" with their latitudes and the hours of the longest day.
The principal makers in Safavid Persia were 'Abd al-A'imma the elder, who made a fine astrolabe for Shah 'Abbas I in 986/1578—9; 'Abd al-A'imma the younger, at least thirty-one of whose instruments made between 1688 and 1720 have survived, though they are perhaps not all by him (a fine example made by him in 1127/1715 is shown in Pis. 1,2); 'Abd al-'AlI b. Muhammad Rafl' (al-Juz'I?), who is remembered by seven examples made between 1707 and 1714, and especially by the superb astrolabe (now in the British Museum) constructed by him for Shah Sultan Husain in 1124/1712 and decorated by Muhammad Baqir,
the maker's brother;2 Khalil Muhammad b. Hasan 'AH, of whose in
struments nineteen are known,3 some of which are again decorated by Muhammad Baqir; Mahmud b. Jalal b. Ja'far al-Asturlabl, who though flourishing near the beginning of our period represents a long line
of tradition;4 Muhammad Amln (who may be identical with Ibn Muhammad Tahir), Muhammad Tahir himself, and Muhammad Amln b. Amlrza Khan al-Nakha'I al-Qumi; Muhammad Mahdl al-khadim al-Yazdl, son of Muhammad Amln, maker and decorator of at least

fifteen extant astrolabes;1 Muhammad Muqlm al-Yazdl, who hadinstruments decorated by the aforementioned Muhammad Mahdl and in 1647 made, in the presence ofMuhammad Shafi', the astronomer of Janabad, an astrolabe for Shah 'Abbas II which was subsequently en
graved by Fazl-Allah al-Sabzavarl;2 Muhammad Zaman of Mashhad, whose name is perpetuated by four astrolabes and two celestial globes, and who constructed an astrolabe in 1677—8 for Subhan Qull Bahadur
Khan of Bukhara;3 and finally Mustafa Ayyubl, who isknown by two instruments of c. 1700. The lastnamed is Ottoman, and it is of interest that few Turkish astrolabes of this period survive: if we areto judge from present evidence there was considerable activity in favour ofsundials, which were in demand formosques and madrasas. On the other hand, the Indo-Persian astrolabes form an interesting class of instruments of which a considerable number of fine examples exist. They are usually less ornate than the Safavid, and most were produced by the Allahdad family inLahore. Acharacteristic is the high triangular kursi whichis
decoratively pierced. A Mughal astrolabe recently sold4 had an 'ankabut forthirty-nine fixed stars, five safa'ih fordifferent latitudes (with azimuths drawn below thehorizon line, and some lines for Babylonian hours), inthe umm a gazetteer of latitudes and longitudes for forty-two places, and on the back (amongst other data) a sine/cosine diagram, scales of cotangents, and lines giving the meridian alti
tude of the sun throughout the year in latitudes 2o°,36°, and 380. This instrument was made by Hamid b. Muhammad Muqlm b. 'Tsa b. Allahdad and dated 6 Dhu'l-Qa'da 1086/22 January 1676. He was the maker of two other known examples, one of 1069/16 5 8-9, the property of the Clockmakers' Company and in the Guildhall Museum, and theother of 1071 \\660-1 in a private collection in Paris.An instrument signed by his father, Muhammad Muqlm, and dated 1051/1641—2 has been described byDrF.

MECHANICS AND TECHNOLOGY
We return to Chardin, who is a mine ofinformation onSafavid technology. He pays particular attention to the technology of agriculture as it relates tothe domestication of water:
They dig atthe foot of Hills for Water, and when they have found a Spring, they guide it in subterraneous conduits toten Leagues distance, and sometimes further, down Hill all the Way, that itmayrun the swifter. No People in the World know better how to Husband Water than the Persians. Those Conduits or Channels, are sometimes near fifteen Fathom deep; and I have seen some ofthem ofthat depth. They are easily measured for atevery ten Fathom distance, there are Vent-holes, the Diameter whereof is as big as that of our Wells... Those subterraneous Ways are usually about nine Foot deep,
and three Foot broad.2
And he adds that in Khurasan there were at onetime forty-two thousand of these underground kenses (qanats).3
As to the distribution ofthe River and Spring water, it is made Weekly or Monthly, as occasion requires, in this manner. They lay on the Canal, which conveys the Water into the Field, a Brass Bowl, round and thin, with a little Hole in the Center of it, whereat the Water comes in by Degrees and when the Bowl sinks the Measure is full, and they begin again, till the quantity of Water agreed upon, be all run into the Field. The Cupis commonly near three Hours before it sinks.

not by their Horns but with an Arch anda Breast-Leather". JAs already pointed out by Needham, inrespect ofthe breast-strap harness
used by the Chinese, this is a superior arrangement.2 Threshing is carried out, notwith flails, butby drawing over the heaps of corn stalks small sledges with iron wheels. Each sledge (some 3 feet long by 2 feet wide) has three or four "round Sticks... which are instead of Axle-Trees; like our Pastry Cooks Rouling Pins, and go in some Iron Wheels, made something like the Wheels of our Jacks, but that they are dented sharp, most like the teeth of a Saw..." When drawn by an animal such as an ass, "Those Wheels break and cutthe Straw, and squeze the Corn out ofthe Ears, without breaking it, because it slips between the Teeth..." As for the hulling of rice, this was done by a hinged-beam device, manually operated; the end of the beam (which was 4feet long) fell on to the rice through an iron ring, half sharp, and
4 inches in diameter.3 Building and architecture afford scientific and artistic achievements of no mean order. Awooden crane, illustrated by Chardin (fig. 1), hada velocity ratio of approximately 5. It was used by the "Joyners; they are very skilful, and very ingenious in composing all sorts of Inlaid-work and Mosaick-work, and they make noble Ceilings of that Kind; they fit them all on the ground, and when they are done they raise them up over the top of the Building, on the Columns, that are to bear them up: I have seen a whole one of fourscore Foot Diameter, rear'd up, with the help of a Machine, like the Draught I present you with on the other side, not knowing whether our European Workmen have any such; the Persians use no other, and they raise every thing with a Pully... The Joyners sit on the Ground attheir Work, their Plains are not like ours, for they thrust the Shavings out ofthe Sides, and not out ofthe Top,
which seems to be a more expeditious way..."4 We have already commented on the state of Persian arms. Chardin in his chapter VII, Of Metals andMinerals, says: "The Persians don't make use ofa Flint totheir Guns, nor tostrike Fire with. They have a Wood which serves them instead ofa Steel and Flint, and has the same

not to be rely'd on".1 Whilst Europeans and Turks were competent in the casting of ordnance in iron and brass, the Persians generally lacked interest in establishing their own industries and "they had rather send
into Europe for Guns..."2 This gradual opening up of trade and the influx of Europeans was in some respects mutually beneficial. In addition to gunnery experts, the French in particular supplied jewellers, clockmakers, and various artisans; Jacob (Jacques) Rousseau, a jeweller and dockmaker from Geneva, settled in Isfahan around 1707,and Chardin stresses the need: "Neither is there in Persia one single Native
that knows well, how to mend aWatch".3 On the other hand, '"Tis certain that the Dutch have much improved themselves in Persia, in the way of making Earthen Ware, and they would make itstill better had they the same clear water, and the same clear Air they have in Persia." And Chardin goes on to praise the native craftsmen: "The Pieces which the Persian Potters called Cacoiper, orEarthen Ware Bakers, make best, are the Enamel Tiles painted and cut out in imitation of Moresk Work. Indeed nothing can be seen livelier and brighter
in that Kind, or drawn finer or more regular".4 The function of the royal workshops must not be overlooked. Rulers have understandably retained the powers of technology within their own grasp. Akbar was not alone in his knowledge of "the Mechanick Arts" and his interest in the manufacture of weapons in his own palace. At Isfahan fine workmanship no doubt produced the exquisite astrolabes for which the Safavid monarchs are famed. According to the Ta%kirat al-muluk, thirty-three such workshops were in active production in the reign of Shah Sultan Husain. What might be called practical mathematics engaged both the writer of compendia and the engineer on the site; thus mensuration, the useof the right-angled triangle, the measurement of arcs, pulleys, the heights of inaccessible objects, and the laws of optical reflection were common subjects ofstudy. The geometry ofarchitecture as reflected inthe superb Muslim style, exemplified in the Taj Mahal at Agra (1638) and the tomb of Dilras Rabi'a DauranI, wife of Aurangzib, at Aurangabad (1666), displays a wonderful exploitation of symmetry in design and of calligraphy in decoration. Persia was already famous for faience in the

1649, w a s t n e architect of the Taj, whilst anephew of his, Abu'l-Khair Khair-Allah Khan "Muhandis", second son of Lutf-Allah "Muhandis" Lahaurl, later became adviser to Jai Singh II of Jaipur in the building of his observatories and wrote a commentary on this distinguished Rajput's astronomical tables under the title Shdrh-i Zij-i Muhammad Shdbi. Finally, there are three small and unrelated items of technological information which deserve mention. The use of the mechanical clock in the observatory of Taqi al-Din recalls the present made by Queen Elizabeth to Sultan Mehmed III in 1599. It was a mechanical organ, made by the famous Thomas Dallam, which incorporated aclock and
other automatic devices.1 In the fifth tashkhis of the Tuhfat al-mu'minin, begun by Mir Muhammad Zaman TunakabunI and completed by his son Muhammad Mu'min-i HusainI, there is a record of the weights used in medicine. An interest in natural history compelled Mir Muhammad Baqir of Astarabad (pen-name Ishraq), known as Mir Damad (d. 1040/1630—1), to have constructed an observation hive of bees.
MEDICINE
We now enter a period ofvernacular medical literature which, apart from the researches of Cyril Elgood, has been largely unexplored. Indian influences return, and valuable contributions were made by the Persians who had migrated tothe Mughal Court. Medicine in Persia had suffered a great loss some two centuries earlier by the pillage of the Rub'-i Rashidl, the quarter of Tabriz upon which Rashld al-Din Fazl-Allah, court physician to the Mongol Tl-Khans, had lavished so much loving care by his establishment of hospitals, colleges, and libraries, where some fifty physicians from India, China and the Near East had each ten students intraining, whilst surgeons, oculists, and bonesetters had each a quota of five. But now there were new clinical observations to supplement the traditional Arabic system exemplified
in the Qanun of Avicenna and the Thesaurus of al-Jurjanl,2 andthe pharmacology of the great botanist Ibn al-Baitar was augmented bya fresh exploitation of drugs. Thus Ghiyas al-Din, ageneral practitioner

in Isfahan who later went to Turkey, dedicated to Sultan Bayezld II in 896/1491 his Mir'at al-sihhafi'l-tibb("Mirror ofHealth in Medicine"), in which a summary of the Thesaurus is amplified in the section dealing with drugs, andhorizons arewidened by a discourse on Turkish medical teaching. As for originality in observation and diagnosis we cannot dobetter than name Baha' al-Daula, who, in the opinion of Elgood, was "the greatest physician who ever lived in Persia after the
passing of the golden age of the caliphs of Baghdad".1
Muhammad HusainI Nurbakhshl Baha' al-Daula had studied under both Persian and Indian teachers at Ray and Herat, and was schooled in the works of Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, Rhazes, Sayyid Isma'Il (al-Jurjani), and Ibn al-Baitar, to which hesoon added a wide and individual clinical experience inhis only known work, written atRay in 907/1501 under the title Khulasatal-tajarib ("The Quintessence of Experience"). In this book there is adescription of an epidemic cough which was rife in Herat; this Elgood thinks may well have been the first account ofwhooping cough, on which the earliest publication in Europe was that by Willis in 1674. Italso gives the earliest description of syphilis in the East. There is a chapter oneruptive fevers which accounts forthree diseases, other than measles and smallpox, which could be chicken-pox, German measles, andthe Fourth Disease. Further, in the chapter on diseases of the eye, there is described what is probably hay fever (not recognised in Europe until 1819), which Baha' al-Daula found peculiarly resistant to treatment. In this last diagnosisit seems likely that he was helped by Rhazes, who had written an essay "On the Cause of the Coryza which occurs in the Spring when the Roses give forth their Scent". Nevertheless, Elgood points out: "Scattered through his works are observations which a physicianof today can neither accept nor deny. They have never been considered" — forexample, the appearance of pigmentary patches onthe face or body of an epileptic denotes acessation of the fits.
The second outstanding physician of Safavid times was 'Imad al-Din Mahmud b.Mas'ud b. Mahmud of Shlraz, who in later life attended patients at the shrine and hospital of Mashhad, where aregular medical service was provided for pilgrims and others. He wrote a monograph on atishak, the Persian form of syphilis, in 15 69.2 China root, which

was acclaimed efficacious in the treatment of this disease, was regarded as a universal panacea, and in an earlier treatise Risa/a-ji chub-i Chtni khwurdan ("Essay on the Eating of China Root") he had already c. 1550 stressed its importance as an antidote in the arrest of a whole list of complaints. Another antidote (bad-%ubr) highly prized was the bezoar stone, a black or reddish stone found in the stomach and gall-bladder of the wild goat which roamed over the north-east extremity of Persia. Chardin in his account "Of the Trees, Plants and Druggs", which includes assafoetida, bezoar stone, musk, "Ambergrease", poppy, tobacco, and sugar, names it "a Counter Poison... a thing that has the upper-hand of Poison" and adds:
The Bezoar is made use of with great Success in Sudorifics; they give it in
Purple Fevers; they more especially prescribe it in Cordials, Confections, and
Philtres. They say it warms and enlivens the Spirits, awakens Vigour, and
confirms the Temperature of the Body... The Manner of using it in Persia, is
to grate it with the Point of a Pen-knife, or to make it into Powder on a
Marble, and the usual Dose is two or three Grains, in a Spoonful of Rose
water. !
In spite of its wide popularity in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, in both Persia and England, Chardin is honest enough to state that, though it was praised by the quacks, it was losing its esteem, and "will, in a short time, be entirely cry'd down, as I think it is already in Europe". The first monograph in Persia devoted to it was by 'Imad al-Dln, and it remained in the English pharmacopaeias until around 1750. Towards the end of our period the unsettled conditions forced Persian physicians to seek asylum at the Mughal court in Delhi. Among them was Mlrza Muhammad Hashim 'Alavl Khan, who left Shlraz in 1699, was presented to Aurangzlb and served his court, then that of Muhammad Shah, and finally the tyrant Nadir Shah. Member of a medical family, he was the elder of two sons, both doctors, of Mlrza HadI Qalandarl. Other refugees from Shlraz were Muhammad Akbar Shah ArzanI and Nur al-Din Muhammad 'Abd-Allah b. Hakim 'Ain al-Mulk. The latter wrote two important works, Alfa%al-adviydh ("The Vocabulary of Drugs") for Shah Jahan in 1038/1628-29, and the Tibb-i Ddrd Sbukiihtfor Shah Jahan's son and heir, murdered by Aurangzlb, which was the last great medical system written in Persian and con

tained a long section on syphilis. There had always been some contact, however slight, with Indian medicine, especially through Herat - thus Yusuf b. Muhammad b. Yusuf, the son of a distinguished physician of that city, at anearlier date became secretary to Humayun (937-963/ 1530—1556) — and so subsequent adverse circumstances merely tended to foster the link. The age which produced Baha' al-Daula did not lack distinguished scholars. Poets and physicians thronged the court ofShah 'Abbas the Great as they did that of Akbar. Experimental science had not yet caused that expansion and fragmentation of knowledge which was the downfall of the medieval philosopher. The apriori approach of Muslim scientists, which can be explained bythe classification of the natural sciences under a common heading of philosophy, inclined men to a respectful acknowledgement of traditional practice, especially in the conservative profession of medicine. It was Avicenna forhis philosophy and system, Rhazes for diagnosis and treatment. As Rhazes had used apes in his pharmacological investigations, so other animals, such as dogs orfowls, might be used in certain experiments. Above all, it was the golden age of pharmacology, and many Persian compilersof Qarabddln {materia medico), though they possessed additional specialised information of native or Indian origin, still revered Ibn Jazla and Ibn al-Baitar astheir model. The Tub/at al-mu'minin, completed for Shah Sulaiman by Muhammad Mu'min-i Husaini in 1669, consisting chiefly of materia medica, persisted innumerous manuscript versions in both Arabic andTurkish (the court language of the Safavids). As for ophthalmology, a study of great importance in Islamic countries, little was achieved in Persia at this time and the main focus of effort was Cairo. The encyclopaedic mind, characteristic ofthe medieval world, prevailed. Baha' al-Dln 'Amill (Shaikh-i Baha'I), a theologian and philosopher whom we have mentioned earlier, studied mathematics under Mulla 'All Muzahhib and Mulla Afzal of Qa'in; furthermore, he proceeded tolearn medicine under 'Ala' al-Dln Mahmud. Like Shifal, he added prestige to the court of Shah 'Abbas the Great. Companion of the shah, court physician and "Plato of his time", Hakim Sharaf al-Dln Hasan Shifa'I was praised by Riza Qull Khan inthese words: "... his
medicine eclipsed his scholarship, as his poetry eclipsed his medicine".1 Physicians, druggists, and astrologers were members offamilies tradi

tionally associated with learning, the tajiks. The principal court physician, haktm-bdsbi, advised on all matters relating to state medicine and the deployment of the country's doctors, and was assisted by the chief druggist,' attar-basht. Employees in the buyutat received free drugs and attention, whilst in Tahmasp's reign a charitable dispensary was established. A good deal is known about the hospitals {btmaristan; lit. "a place for the sick") in respect of location and buildings, but not much about their organisation and administration. Oddly enough, John Fryer omits to mention them. Unlike Herbert, who was not a medical man, he looked upon Persian medicine with less favour. Fryer says that "they stick to the Arabian Method as devoutly as to the Sacred Tripod... on which score Chymistry is hardly embraced; nor to the Pathological part do they think the Anatomical Knife can bring much Profit"; and since "Their Law forbids them to inspect a dead Carkass" so then in anatomy "their Practice is lame, and their Theory no more than the prating of a Parrot"; hence "they are imperfect in the Chyrurgeons-Art...". They resort to phlebotomy. Unusual diets (e.g. camel's flesh) native to the country are recommended. Only certain specific remedies are tried, and these are of universal application "without respect had to difference of Temperament, or Constitution; nay, or
even to the Distempers themselves..."1 The bezoar-stone is highly regarded, especially in the treatment of Spotted Fever. Fryer, who reached Isfahan in August 1677 and was there at the same time as Pere Raphael du Mans, was particularly interested in the druggists, "all Jews", and the multiplicity of their wares. Sickness forced Fryer, who was a physician in the employ of the East India Company, to leave Persia, and after a period in Surat, he sailed for England, where in due course he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (1697). He was aware that chemistry, only recently a new science in England due largely to Boyle, had not yet emerged out of alchemy. Hiilegii had had an alchemical laboratory attached to the observatory at Maragha, and specific technical achievements in chemistry were not lacking, but it was the practice of an art rather than a science, and astrology and magic were close adherents. Even Baha' al-Daula, most eminent of clinical observers, believed that magic played some part in medical practice. The most significant reference to a technical process in chemistry seems to be that of Chardin when speaking of the production of rose

water by distillation; he refers to "its being Distill'd without Water, which is contrary to our Method... ' We return to the Catholic missions. It is appropriate to mention them here because of the close association ofmany oftheir members
with medicine. Raphael du Mans2 describes an instrument for the extraction of soft cataracts by suction. This was not new, but was in the illustrious tradition ofArab eye-surgery, being the hollow needle, a forerunner of the injection syringe, invented by 'Ammar b. 'AH al-Mausill, who practised in Cairo in the late 4th/ioth century. Though the Capuchin Fathers were given the title of physician, it is to the Carmelites, Pere Mattheus and Pere Ange de Saint Joseph, that we
must turn fora definite record of achievement.3 The former, first a physician inthe important medical centre ofShlraz, later travelled to India as a botanist and pharmacologist. Pere Ange de Saint Joseph (Joseph Labrosse), the first serious student of Persian medicine, was responsible for thetransmission of Persian medical terminology to Europe; on his return to Paris he published his Pharmacopoeia Persica in 1680, a work based upon the Tibb-i Shifd'i, written by the pharmacist Muzaffar b. Muhammad al-Husainl al-Shifa'I before 963/1556. One might append here for the sake of completeness the name of Giovanni Tommaso Minadoi (1540—1615), who was also instrumental in the transmission of Persian and Turkish medical knowledge to Europe. After taking his medical degree Minadoi travelled forseven yearsin the Ottoman dominions, finally returning to Italy to become physician to the duke ofMantua and professor ofmedicine atthe University of Padua. We come to the end of our story, and it is left but to summarise. In this troubled period of Persian history conditions were not often conducive to scientific research. Physicians and astrologers who fell foul of their royal masters frequently found themselves on a swift journey to Paradise. Decisions were invariably dictated by expediency. Rather must we regard it as aperiod of culmination, in which the observatory in Islam, like the hospital before it, became an institution for the first time in human affairs. The long geometrical tradition in Muslim astronomy had reached its limits of accuracy in the erection of giant instruments and could progress nofarther; sowith the astrolabe we

have perfection at the end of an era of advancing craftsmanship. In the words of C.H.Josten, "In the middle of the seventeenth century the art of the Persian engravers reached its highest point. The precision and calligraphy of that period are without comparison. In spite of the most elaborate ornamentation the mathematical accuracy of the engraving is
unimpaired".1 It is perhaps only in medicine, especially in the acute clinical observations of Baha' al-Daula, that we find the opening up of new vistas of enquiry, whilst Elgood still thinks that the study of the Persian pharmacology of the Safavid period is a profitable source of information. Science, circumscribed by native culture, was nurtured and confined in a few centres of learning: Isfahan, Shlraz, and — on the Persian trade route to Bukhara — Mashhad and Herat. Northern Khurasan, through which the Indian merchants passed, also on their way to Bukhara, was almost the only source of astronomers. Controlled experiment, in which concomitant variation could be examined, was lost after Ibn al-Haitham, and was only now being revived and appreciated in Europe; uncontrolled experiment had furnished, at Samarqand, the finest zlj of that time, though subsequently nothing like Kepler's Laws emerged from the data. But Persia stood upon the threshold. The door to the West was ajar, so that the light of a universal objectivity might one day come filtering through.

CHAPTER I 2
RELIGION IN THE TIMURID AND
SAFAVID PERIODS
I. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TIMURID ERA
At thetime of Tlmur's death and under his immediate successorsthe religious situation in Iran was characterised by two complementary processes, which were the primary determinant of —or, minimally, ultimately resulted in- that particular form ofreligious reality known as Safavid Shi'ism. The first factor is thegreat flexibility, bordering on prevarication, displayed by the religious world in fulfilling its cementing function between the political rulers andtheir subjects in the most disparate alliances between successive sovereigns and the local religious (and administrative) aristocracy, even when the diversity of madhhab professed bythe two protagonists would lead one toexpect anatleast dual missionary activity rather than a day-to-day cooperation. It istrue that there was a diversity ofmadhhab in a slightly broader andmore equivocal sense, rather than in that usual connotation of the word which restricts it simply to the canonical schools. Butit is indisputable that there was a rapprochement on the concrete plane which occurred at a time when, as all scholars admit, there wasa "return" to the myth of the ideal sovereign, a "true Caliph", andconsequently to a renewalof the hope in the advent of a leader in spiritual affairs andso too in religious affairs. This eagerly awaited leader wastheMahdl, a figure who was variously delineated andcharacterised in thedifferent areas and madhdhib proclaiming andanticipating hiscoming. The other decisive factor is a gradual trend towards Shi'ism among the "aberrant" currents oforthodoxy, including sufism, allied with the presence of strong "Twelver" elements in themovements consciously aiming at a centralist outlook, which transcended the traditional divisions ofMuslim religious society. This analysis isacceptable only up to the advent of Shah Isma'il, after which any discussion of the religious situation inIran must necessarily involve an examination ofthe religious policies followed by the various sovereigns in circumstances which, interesting though they may be, were less fluid and soeasier to classify.
610



GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TIMURID ERA
That these two processes were ofa complementary nature is plain once one recognises the presence of ideological elements which provide us also with a key to the analysis of all the 9th/15 th century religious movements. Muslim society explicitly embodied atthat time, particularly in Iran, the backlash of reaction tothe "paganism" ofthe
Mongol hegemony during the preceding centuries.1 The watchword was the restoration of Islam, conceived of as the restoration of the true Shorta, that is, the Shari'a asexpounded bythe Prophet - and even more by his first Companions - which envisaged in aprecise fashion a homogeneous society united under one leader. This led to an extension of the functions and prerogatives of the teachers ofthe Shari'a, andin consequence to an exaltation of the ideological, and not merelythe functional, values of the juridical madhhab to which the subjects had to conform. Inreligious terms, however, this istantamount to admitting the possibility of the existence of an orthodox Shari'a side by side with a faith open toinnovations — a coexistence which was advocated and defended by many heresiarchs of those days.
The transition from the concept ofan ideal sovereign acting as the leader ofsuch a restoration, to that ofa Mahdi representing the only hope of implementing the reform of Islam according to the dictates of the ancients, appears ever more natural. Typologically speaking, it is therefore more specific to recognise that religious trend of the Muslim world which, though representing the apotheosis of the waiting for the Mahdi in its most persistent form, isnevertheless always partial to an ever-delayed realisation of his coming as asovereign: that is, the tradition of the Twelver ShI'a.
According to the ideal line of evolution, thelawful sovereign is considered at one time as an intermediary who wields thepowers recognised as legitimately appertaining tothat religious entity we call the Mahdi; then as his deputy and Caliph; and ultimately as the incarna
tion ofthe Mahdi. Tlmur, the "refuge ofthe Caliphate",2 the cosmic vindicator of all Islam, who punished the Shl'Is for their crimes against the Companions and the Damascenes for the wrongs they had inflicted upon the A.M al-bait, represents the first and not altogether clear example of mediation between the Mongol heritage and the new complex of

political and religious requirements of Islam. A significant case in point is his relationship, according to legend, with the Safavid Khwaja 'All, which thanks to the new sources published by Horst can now be even more legitimately considered as one of a number of attempts made by the throne to take advantage of the suf I movements in order to acquire a wholly religious kind of legitimacy, which might be exhibited as one of the indispensable attributes of regality. For TImur this may have been merely an a posteriori justification of an attempt to break with the preceding era that was to be emphatically endorsed by his successors and in particular by Shah Rukh. The latter claimed to be the restorer par excellence of the Sharl'a and the Caliphate ("May God perpetuate his reign in the Caliphate of this world" are the words of the khutba which
the Indian Khizr Khan was required to utter in Hafiz-i Abrii)1 in the shadow of an increasing and deliberate philo-'Alidism which, although tempered by a prospective alliance with sufism, was destined to become gradually an Imamite form of 'Alidism. In this connection we must remember the aspirations of Husain Balqara ("ornament of the
throne of the Caliphate"2), who, by trying to persuade Mir Sayyid 'AH
Qa'inI to recite the khutba on behalf of the Twelve Imams,3 presented himself as the legitimate forerunner of a future authority which would automatically replace the principles of authority hitherto recognised. This amalgam of the Shl'a, of sufism and of the awareness of the necessity for a Mahdl had an 8th/14th-century precedent in the Sarbadar movement, in which are discernible those elements that are typical of and common to all the religious protest movements of the century under consideration. Strictly speaking, the history of the Sarbadars (Sabzavar 1337—1381) and its repercussions in the Caspian (Sayyids of Mazandaran, 1350-92; of Gllan, 1370) and Kirman (1373) areas do not concern us here, but a brief analysis of the nature of the movement will serve as an ante litteram case history of the subsequent relationship between the sovereign and the Musha'sha' or Qizilbash heretics. The Sarbadar opposition comprehended many kinds of heterogeneous elements: there were not only peasants and plebeians from the towns, but also members of the local landed gentry, who provided the first two military leaders of the movement - 'Abd al-Razzaq and Ma'sud - and other elements also. These non-plebeian and essentially Iranian elements, faithful to the Firdausian traditions, did what they could to

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TIMURID ERA
provide an opposition to the administrative aristocracy, many of whose members were also Shl'I, and to the Sunni 'ulama, both of them groups which were enmeshed in the Il-Khanid policy. On the religious plane these aristocrats represent an idealisation of the true Sharl'a, which lay beneath the expectation of the coming of the perfect prince, whereas the dispossessed, ready as they were to accept any leader provided one could be found, represent the longing for a brotherhood of all Muslims and thereby for one of the Mahdl's prerogatives, i.e. the establishment of social justice. Both components of the movement were at any rate Shl'i. Thus, with the Sarbadars, the Shl'a became an effective form of protest. We are dealing here with a Twelver Shi'a, despite the fact that some of its attitudes are reminiscent of the Zaidite revolts in the early years of the 'Abbasid era which, though in adifferent way, were likewise obsessed with the idea of a legitimate sovereign. The Mahdi whose coming they awaited was to be a warrior and a conqueror, and the armed struggle they waged against constituted authority was directed towards hastening his coming byremoving all possible obstacles. This explains the revival by the Sarbadars ofa custom witnessed by Yaqut in 7th/i3th century Kashan: every morning the city authorities would lead a saddled horse outside the walls, in the
always likely eventuality that the Mahdi should arrive.1
The sufl movements, even under the Saljuqs and more especially during the years of Mongol domination, were characterised by aprogressive socialisation, the first consequence of which was access to the "mystic path", open to those social classes who, because they were poor, were ready to accept any authority having the seal of religious legality, as opposed to the political reality which was proving more and more disappointing. The shaikhs to whom they had recourse appear to have represented a court of appeal for complaints, even when the only solution they could suggest was adisdainful liberation from worldly needs pending the arrival of better times. This form of shaikh cult filled most of the gap between the Shl'I outlook and sufism, thanks tothe ever greater ideological affinity between imam and shaikh. The Sarbadars were, in fact, Shl'Is, but they were organised on military lines as aconfraternity, and in this waya diarchy of power - religious and political - was created; this would seem to have posited the need for a kind of coexistence between an

amir, responsible for maintaining order in temporal affairs, and a shaikh-Mahdl who would act asa guarantor of the truthfulness of the professed madhhab. As aresult of this distribution of powers, the role of revolutionary elements and the task ofintroducing social reforms were entrusted tothe shaikh-Mahdl, while the amir acted as a moderator and hence asthe mouthpiece of the claims of the minor aristocracy, whose chief aim was tosupplant the Mongol rulers and their emissaries. Inthe 9th/15 th century, when movements emerged of very different dimensions and religious significance, such as the Musha'sha' and the Qizilbash, the diarchy was combined in the hands of one man. The most typical examples are the first two Musha'sha' leaders - Muhammad b. Falah and 'All—and Shah Isma'Il, whose careers display a certain similarity inevolving from a form ofpolitical and religious extremism. This led both Isma'Il and 'All to consider themselves aspartaking of a divine quality andthereby being in a position to grant favours of a mainly material nature — into a self-imposed limitation of their own prerogatives which they accepted in exchange for security of office (a development which was completed within Shah Isma'Il's own lifetime, while in'All Musha'sha'I's case it extended to the rule of his successors). Regardless of one's point of view, thereligious history of Iran can be seen as being wholly reflected in thecomplex relationship of the Qara Quyunlii and Aq Quyunlu with their subjects, in a complicated network of alliances and enmities which do not seem to have been dictated by any coherent religious policy; though it must be added that any such apparent policy would inevitably appear ambiguous owing to the individual sovereigns' wavering between orthodoxy and "heresy" in their own personal convictions. It was in this climate of ambiguity and an uncertain political situation that heretical movements like those of the Hurufls and the Musha'sha' were born, and that the Qizilbash movement assumedthe form of a military and religious organisation.
II. THE RELIGIOUS TOPOGRAPHY OF PRE-SAFAVID IRAN
Detailed information about the religious situation in the various provinces and cities of 15 th-century Iran is lacking. Hamd-Allah MustaufI, however, has left usinhis Nu^hat al-quliib (c. 740/1340) a fairly accurate religious topography ofPersia during the preceding century, thus providing uswith a starting-point forananalysis ofthe transformation of

PRE-SAFAVID RELIGIOUS TOPOGRAPHY
the Iranian mentality which, as we have seen, was characterised by an attempt to fuse sufism with the Shl'a and by an increasing trend towards 'Alidism. Itneeds to be said that this latter trend was extremely vague. The misfortunes of JamI, who in 877—8/1472 proclaimed himself a potential victim of both the Iraqi (Shl'I) and the Khurasan (SunnI)
ta'assub, are highly significant.1 For the same reason, when the philosopher Jalal al-Dln DavanI, who was a SunnI despite claims tothe con
trary,2 devoted all his energies between 1467 and 1477 to a typical vulgarisation of a classical Shl'I text such as the A.khlaq-iNdsin, this did not seem to the 15th-century mind to bedue to the eccentricity of a scholar, because inreality it formed part ofa complex — and to some extent unconscious - official SunnI attempt at annexing concepts or studies traditionally held to be part of the Shl'I rationalistic heritage. In Davanl's case this was an abstract ethico-political theory, polyvalent by its very nature, which explains why both currents regarded him as their master. A more specific instance is provided by afundamental work of Talibite genealogy, the 'Umdat al-talib, compiled at this time byIbn 'Inaba (d. 828/1424) and dedicated to a patron who is generally believed to have been the reigning monarch, Tlmur. While the historical validity of this dedication may be disputed, the work remains an indication of the popularity and the importance ofthe Ahl al-bait, which the religious mentality is inclined toregard as the common heritage of all Islam (at any rate such an attitude appears natural in this historical context, given the still more significant fact that aposteriori the work has been seen as written for Tlmur). At Balkh thetrue (Iranian) ma^ar of 'All was rediscovered and pilgrims flocked to Mashhad as a result of the growing importance of its shrine, whose influence was felt beyond the confines of the Imamite entourage and led the Timurids to embark on a whole range of imposing public works. This was, in fact, the golden age of Mashhad, for after succeedingto the throne Shah Rukh visited the city several times, paying homageto the tomb and making generous gifts tothe local sayyids. The Matla' al-shamsrecords visits during theMuharram in 809/1406, 810/1407, 815/1412, 821/1418, 822/1419, and 840/1436. Shah Rukh was also responsible forthe embellishment of both the great Khurasan shrines: the one we have just mentioned, atMashhad, and the newly "discov

ered" shrine at Mazar-i Sharif, where his minister Ghiyas al-Dln (d. 829/1425—6) was buried. The name of Mashhad, however, is connected above all with that of the sovereign's wife, Gauhar Shad, who was responsible for the erection of the mosque of the same name, built by a craftsman from Shiraz between 808/1405 and 821/1418. Shah Rukh's successors also venerated this shrine and the Matla' al-shams records visits by Ulugh Beg in 852/1448-9; by Abu'l-Qasim Babur in 856/1452—3 and on a second occasion before he died and was buried in the madrasa of Shah Rukh in 861/1457; by his son Mahmud, who was crowned at Mashhad in the latter year; by Husain BaTqara in 870/1465—6;
and by Abu Sa'Id in 872/1467-8.x An "officially" Shl'I dynasty could hardly have been more obsequious. In short, this was a period when the popular substratum played a leading role in official "sacred history" by introducing a kind of sentimentalism that might be described as group religiosity, and also had a share in formulating the language of sufism for example in the "theology" of Va'iz-i Kashifl, who died in 910/1504-5 (the Rau^at al-shuhadd is identical in terms of its contents with the classical Imamite texts, but its form is that of a narration, supplemented with a wealth of elements drawn from mythology and folklore), and in the mysticism of Shah Ni'mat-Allah Vail (d. 834/1431). As regards the other point, i.e. the intermingling of sufism and Shi'ism in the light of a reachieved Islamic unity, in accordance with the attempt to return to a kind of religious purism which, as we have seen, was a constant factor in Muslim society at that time, the man who was most effective and coherent in trying to bring about this synthesis was the Kubravl mystic, Sayyid Muhammad Nurbakhsh (d. 869/1464). Nurbakhsh derives his desire for unity from 'Ala al-Daula SimnanI, a SunnI whose centralist outlook was typically Ash'arl but who, at the same time, was appointed by Oljeitii to preside over the Sunnl-Shl'I council at Sultaniyya (1305) which ended with his "conversion" to the Shl'a. It should, however, be noted that this anti-rigorist attitude of both tendencies did not prevent SimnanI from replying to Shaikh Khalifa, the theoretical founder of the Sarbadar movement, by throwing an inkpot at his head to punish him for his impertinence in declaring that he wanted something more than his master was able to give
him.2 Shaikh Khalifa, in fact, had ventured to deny the validity of the

juridical concept ofthe orthodox madhhab, todeny which was a very different thing from a sentimental attachment to'Alidism. An equally centralist outlook, onthe other hand, was shared by the most direct teacher ofNurbakhsh, Ahmad b.Fahd al-Hilll (d. 841/1437-8). This Twelver Shl'I did not hesitate to pronounce asentence of takfir against his former pupil Muhammad b. Falah Musha'sha'I when he too, although in circumstances different from those of the Nurbakhsh case,
claimed the prerogatives of a MahdI.1 The position of Nurbakhsh, which concerns us here more closely,is defined in a passage in his 'Aqida, which is, incidentally, coherently Shl'I. In it helays stress ona process which might becalled oneof "transfert", whereby the heir to the prophetic mission, i.e. he who is in the position of privilege of the Ahl al-bait, is the sufl, whose own spiritual ancestor is 'All, while atthe other extremity of the chain is the MahdI. Within the history of the development of religious ideas in Iran this assertion is farmore important than the reasons which later induced Nurbakhsh to proclaim himself MahdI, these reasons being based forthe most part onastrological and cabalistic calculations as well as on anumber of coincidences. Nevertheless, the religious topography ofIran that can bededuced from MustaufI clearly reveals the possibility of the formation, in a promiscuous religious milieu, of a certain ambivalence and sothat belonging tothe Shl'I rather than to the SunnI confession would seem to be amatter of religious sensibility rather than one of ideological divergences or different juridical rites. According to MustaufI, inthe big urban centres the majority of the inhabitants were Sunnls, while the traditionally Shl'I - or, tobe more precise, Twelver - areas were, in addition toGllan and Mazandaran, the cities of Ray, Varamln, Qum and Kashan, the province of Khuzistan and the Khurasan region ofSabzavar. In those parts of Iran where it existed Shi'ism was widespread among the peasantry, but in the cities some of the aristocratic families were also Shl'I and occupied leading posts in the administration during the Timurid era, and especially under the SunnI Aq Quyiinlu. Some significant examples, in this connection, are cited and devel
oped by Aubin2 to show the privileges granted tocertain Shf! sayyids or whole families, inaccordance with a policy of bestowing privileges upon them which began with Tlmur and continued down to Uzun

Hasan. On the other hand, as late as 1720-1 the Ottoman DurrI Efendl
reported that a third of the population of Iran were Sunnls.1 Their numbers must have been more constant still outside the cities, a contributory factor being the ambivalent effects of taqiyya. It is pointless to ask what had happened during the period intervening between these two statements, unless one takes into account a fact of the greatest importance in the work of the earlier of the two writers. MustaufI maintains that Shafi'I elements existed in almost every place he mentions, both in those where he speaks of the presence of Sunnls and in the traditional centres of Shi'ism, and this provides evidence to support the supposition that the religious situation in Persia had a certain homogeneity, due not only to the factors mentioned above, but also to the influence of Shafi'ism, which from another point of view seems more capable than any other madhhab of absorbing methodologically different outlooks, thereby paving the way, in its turn, to a more
complete amalgamation.2 As a partial confirmation of these suppositions let us consider an
extreme case reported by Nur-Allah Shushtarl in the Majalis al-mu'mimn2 when speaking of Kashan, a city which, more than any other, provides frequent evidence of its adherence to the Shl'I faith (the saddled white
horse waiting for the Mahdi, the "death festival" of 'Umar,4 etc.). Despite this, it was in Kashan that, when Shah Isma'H ordered a public execration of the first three Caliphs, "the great and the worthy among the people of the Sunna in the land of Iraq took the path of exile", and it was in Kashan that "there remained no traces of Sunni qddiot mufti". For two years, whenever they wished "to ascertain the truth in their problems of Sharf a", the people of Kashan had to ask the maulana Shams al-Din Muhammad al-Khunfarl, "although he was not a specialist in the problems oi fiqh and had no adequate text among his Shl'I books". When formulating his fatwa, the maulana used his common sense (a method used, in particular, by the Shafi'I school), pending the arrival in Kashan of a Shl'I jurist who, after examining the fatwas given by the maulana, ratified them all because they were in accordance with
1 Relation de Dourry Efendy,ambassadeurde la Porte Ottomane aupres duRoi de Perse (Paris, i8io),p. 54.
2 On the Shi*! side there is usually a tendency to stress the fact that the Shafi'T method was based on the Ja'farl system in order to explain certain undeniable analogies. This is of less interest to us, however, than the problem of finding a plausible explanation for the smooth transition from one system to the other in the everyday practice of the istisbab, which is a characteristic of
both schools. 3 Nur-Allah Shushtarl, Majalisal-mu'minln(Tehran, 1268/1852), fol. iyor. * Ibid.,(o\. 18.

the principle of "rational beauty and ugliness", which was precisely the basic precept of the Imamite school. If we compare this valuable testimony with the fact that it was in Kashan that a bitter enemy of the Safavids, the SunnI (but Shafi'I) historian Fazl-Allah b. Ruzbihan KhunjI (who was also the author of a poetical hymn in praise of the
Twelve Imams1), found a temporary refuge, we have more than a clue to the complexity of the situation. This will perhaps provide us with a basis for further inferences, for the existence of such a situation in one of the main centres of Persian Shi'ism, where itwould seem that the jurists were SunnI by nature and that one was a Shl'I particularly in the writing of poetry, can serve to dispel much of the confusion surrounding the figure of Shaikh Safi al-Dln in connection with his proper place in the religious history of Ardabil and his now undisputed original adherence to Sunnism.
According to MustaufI, Ardabil was a centre of Shafi'ism.2 In particular, A. Kasravl has shown that Shaikh Safi al-Dln's Shafi'ism was an essential part of the religious mentality of the Shaikh and was certainly not due to any taqiyya, which would be unlikely at a time when Oljeitii was tending towards non-orthodox attitudes. Nevertheless, the example of Kashan would seem to demonstrate that we cannot take the type of madhhab as an adequate basis for determining the nature of the faith professed by any Persian city. This does not cast any doubts on the position of Shaikh Safi, but itdoes lead us to another question, the answer to which might help us to solve at least some of the outstanding problems concerning the religious evolution of the first Safavids. A certain simplification of terms, possible after the installation of Twelver Shi'ism in the whole of Iran, would seem to have been applied retrogressively tothis period, which, as we have seen, was full of ambiguities. In particular, the claim made by Safi al-Dln's descendants to be HusainI sayyids seemed for a long time to imply that they were Shl'I, despite the fact that the authentic sources do not mention this title when referring to the shaikhs of Ardabil. It would seem more likely that there was a gradual realisation of the importance of this claim — beginning with the vague remarks of Sadr al-Dln, becoming explicit in the assertion of Isma'Il, who described himself, though not always, as a HusainI, and arriving finally at the generalisation of the

title under Tahmasp. In the traditional terminology, in fact, extremism and Shi'ism seemed to be more easily reconcilable than extremism and Shafi'ism, and it was impossible to give a typological definition of the Safavid ghuluww if the ShI'I premisses were to be discarded. The transition from Shafi'ism to the ghuluww, on the contrary, does not necessarily have to pass through a stage of claiming the sajydda, this being no different from moderate Shi'ism, and there is another factor that might ultimately have proved disadvantageous to the sayyada, i.e. to the Twelver Shi'ism, of the first Safavids, which may help to throw light on the situation. This was the Kurdish origin of the family, unequivocably demonstrated by Togan. The inhabitants of Kurdistan were Shafi'i, and yet it was in Kurdistan that certain extremist heresies either had their origins or found fertile soil - for example, the Ahl-i haqq.Such heresies were not offshoots of Twelver Shi'ism, but as a result of long contacts they were subjected to its influence to such an extent that after the accession of the Safavids they borrowed some of its forms. Moreover, the Ahl-i haqq component seems obvious in the Qizilbash movement, in regard to which the Shaikhs of ArdabU set themselves up as unquestioned and traditional leaders, and even today there are groups of Kurdish Qizilbash in Anatolia. Protected also by sufl esotericism, the Shaikhs of Ardabll seem to have submitted outwardly to a certain moderation, until they eventually found an outlet in a twofold kind of extremism: political when Shaikh Junaid indulged in extra-religious activities along lines apparently going back to the Zaidism of GHan, and religious when it reflected their relationship to their extremist followers.
This may enable us to hazard a definition of the components of the madhhab under the first Safavids: an extremist type of sufism — which did not prevent the profession of juridical Shafi'ism — influenced by the Kurdish (Ahl-i haqq) and Turkish (BektashI) aspects of Qizilbash religious beliefs, but possibly also by Nuqtavi elements known to have been present (see below) in Gllan, the traditional refuge of the Shaikhs. Its approach was therefore of a heretical type which cannot be strictly characterised as ShI'I or non-Shl'I: such was Shafi'I sufism, which became the ideological banner of so composite a movement as that of the Qizilbash, engaged in difficult political manoeuvres with both the ShI'I Qara Quyiinlu and the orthodox Aq Quyunlu, which were rendered even more complicated by innumerable ties of blood-relationship in no way determined by religious sympathies. Another instance

of the coexistence of juridical Shafi'ism and heretical beliefs is provided by the case of the son of the Huruf I Fail-Allah, who, when commenting on his flight from ruthless persecutors, claimed tohave answered their question (to which madhhab he belonged) by professing a
Shafi'ism which he did not subsequently renounce.1 This swinging ofthe balance ofpower from Aq Quyunlu to Qara Quyunlu and vice versa was particularly noticeable in the first half of the 9th/15th century. Although, to a certain extent, it was a reflection of the sphere of political influence, there is no real parallel to this shifting of power in the far more subtle field of diplomatic and ideological relationships. Practically speaking, the latter were limited to the support given by princes to one another when they came into conflict with members of their own families. In such cases they exploited the idea of religious differences, which they seem tohave regarded as being so many more strings to their own bows, and had the aim of encouraging the greatest possible confusion in their relationship to their subjects.
As examples one can cite the alliance between the Qara Quyunlu and the SunnI Ottomans against the Aq Quyunlu, who considered themselves themost direct heirs of Timurid power on account of the Il-Khanid princes' authoritative investiture; or conversely, the support given by an Aq Quyunlu such as Uzun Hasan to the traditional enemy, embodied in this case by Hasan 'All, while theanti-Timurid Qara Quyunlu policy was being carried on by Iskandar. Such was the background in Iran to the fortunes of Mahdism, to the diffusion of the Huruf I and Musha'sha' heresies and to the formation of Ahl-i haqq (or rather their predecessors) and Qizilbash groups. All these things made it incumbent upon the sovereign tofollow an elastic religious policy, ranging from broad-minded comprehension ofequivocal orantithetical professions of faith on the part of his subjects to the inevitable exclusive adhesion to onegroup whenever the political situation became critical and the duties and ambitions of the sovereign were not limited to functioning merely as the guarantor of the status quo.
The two sovereigns who appear to have been themore or less involuntary mouthpieces of this complex religious world were Aspand and Jahan Shah, both of whom were representatives par excellence of Qara Quyunlu heterodoxy, though the type of Shi'ism professed by each had different characteristics.
1 Golpinarli, "Fadlallah-i Hurufi'nin ogluna", p. 45.
621



RELIGION
Aspand embraced Shi'ism after a grand council attended by both Sunnls and Shl'Is, at a moment when the inhabitants of Iraq, who had always been Shl'Is, seemed at last to have found the leader for whom not only Khuzistan and Iraq, but the whole Islamic world, had been waiting — a man who, at all events at this stage, combined political audacity with an original religious syncretism, the Musha'sha' Muhammad b. Falah. Aspand's explicit acceptance of Shi'ism seems to have been a clever move on the part of a sovereign who was trying to reach a compromise with his non-orthodox subjects, to place himself on their religious level and to obtain — paradoxically enough, from his subjects — a more official investiture than that obtained by Shah Muhammad. For Aspand, becoming a Shl'l meant minting coinage in the names of the Twelve Imams, professing the Twelver cult and thus becoming — in effect — the champion of the pure madhhab of the Ahl al-bait. By contrast, Jahan Shah's Imamite profession of faith seems to have been dictated by more personal reasons, as he was a Shl'l not merely by virtue of his minting coins with the names of the Twelve Imams but also because he was troubled by more sincerely religious spiritual doubts, at least if we can judge from the divan which the ruler, designated Shams al-'arifln, either composed himself or at any rate claimed
as his own.1 In other words, while Aspand represents the high-level and probably demagogic realisation of the ruler-subject relationship which had been much more spontaneously anticipated by the vicissitudes of the Sarbadar movement, Jahan Shah would appear to have been a forerunner of Shah Isma'Il. The appropriateness of this analogy is evident in the negative attitude of both rulers towards the ghuluww, which they did not in any way try to appeal to in the name of a common background, either in a religious or in a political sense. Although Jahan Shah was not the most outspoken denouncer of Hurufism, he could not accept it, not because his point of view coincided with that of such rulers as Tlmur or MIran Shah, who feared the danger - always latent in the Shl'a - of the discovery of the true sovereign, but because the chosen ruler had already been made manifest in his own person. Nor did his stubborn opposition to Hurufism create any real halo of ambiguity regarding the sincerity of his Shl'l
beliefs.2 On the contrary, it would seem to have been due to the enthusiasm of one who felt that he had been entrusted with a super

human task: as champion of the Twelfth Imam, he was the chosen leader and the repository (such was the esotericism of the Imamite agnostics) of a higher truth the need for which, directly or indirectly, had been repeatedly and insistently asserted in the course of the history of Twelver Shi'ism and had led to the 'drifs being considered its trustee, sharing - to use an expression dear to Corbin - in the Body of which the Imam is the head.
III. THE HURUFIS
The Hurufis made their first appearance at the end of the 8th/14th century. Their founder Fazl-Allah (possibly known earlier as 'Abd al-Rahman) was born at Astarabad in 740/1340. The details of his life reflect all the ferments of his time: he was a sayyid, a mystic from childhood, an interpreter of dreams, an ardent pilgrim and a strict observer of the Sharl 'a, as was only to be expected in the son of a qadl (hence his nickname, halal-khur). His actions were invariably determined by dreams; it was a dream that induced him to undertake the ^tydra to Mashhad immediately after the hajj; in another dream the names of the holiest mystics were revealed to him; and a dream of light foretold his mission by piercing his right eye ('aiti,which also means "essence" or "source") with the rays of the Star which rises in the East at intervals of centuries. His investiture immediately assumed the double form — indispensable in one who lays claim to being the repository of sirr in the Muslim world — of mediation in trans-human things (he acquired his first disciples by interpreting dreams and reading them in the mind) and of hujja in sub-human matters (the world of nature as represented by birds, whose language Fazl-Allah, like all the Imams, could understand). The community he gathered around him, however, had the same characteristics as the contemporary groups of dervishes: its members were of humble origin and were for the most part artisans; it practised frugality and rectitude. It was not until he had reached middle age, about 1396, that Fazl-Allah was led to theopathy — from the authentic revelation of the meaning of the Prophecy to the dignity of Sahib al-zaman and the glory of the divine manifestation. He wrote the Javtdan-ndma-yi kabir, and while his religious mission between Isfahan and Shlrvan naturally had a political significance, he went unarmed. He seems to have merely "besought" the potentates to join him, but Miran Shah, whom he trusted, betrayed him, cast him into

RELIGION
prison (during his imprisonment he wrote the Vasijyat-nama) and had him executed at Alinjaq in 790/1394. Equally unfortunate was his first caliph, 'All al-'ala, when he tried to approach the new Qara Quyunlu leadership, embodied in this instance by Qara Yusuf. Yet though he was executed in 822/1419, he was nevertheless responsible for first spreading the HurufI doctrines within the Bektashi-Anatolian environment. Subsequent external events and the various subdivisions and schisms are of only relative importance. In substance, Hurufism is still an expression of Isma'ilism, in the sense that the theological terms defining it on the religious plane are not derived solely from Isma'ilism, i.e. the doctrine that the Creation is necessarily determined, by the cosmic drama of which it is a pallid and imperfect reflection. Significantly, the definition of divinity was based on the absolute ta'til of the divine attributes and on a form of tashbih which proceeded in an opposite direction to the orthodox, in the sense that the term of comparison was Man and it was to Man that the divine likeness was referred. But although this concentration of interest on the human figure as representing completely the ultramundane mystery is its closest link with Isma'ilism, Hurufism differs from the latter in its recognition of the real location of the Haqiqa in the substance of the letters rather than in the person of the Imam. And hence a new type of Qur'anic ta'wil related to what might be called the material rather than the symbolic form in which the word as revealed was incorporated in the sacred text. The Muslim mind has always been faced with the problem of a form of Qur'anic expressions capable of different and even conflicting interpretations, the various tafsirs being merely approximate and incomplete catalogues of these that could be amplified. In this sense, for example, the letters kn symbolise the divine creative activity. The various heretical movements have always felt the need of clarifying the metaphysical content of such symbols by choosing - out of the various alternatives which were often suggested by orthodox as well as unorthodox thought - some that could represent Reality as a whole. By using among other things a cabalistic interpretation, Hurufism raises the letters' value to such a level that the dualism between Substance and Form is transformed into the equation: Reality of Substance = Determined Value of the Letter. This process of emphasis is, however, at the same time a process of simplification and, theologically speaking, instead of leading to an innovatory interpretation of the divine content, crystallises into a confessional creed of a

static type, the revolutionary message of which is, paradoxically enough, entrusted to those practical measures which Muslim society regards asthe inevitable consequences ofany new religious choice.In any case, in thecontext of Hurufism, thething that most plausibly transcends astrictly Shl'I mentality is the claim to possession of the key to the Haqlqa; this eliminates both the first intermediary (the Imam) and a leader like Jahan Shah, claiming to bethe second intermediary destined (as Twelver Caliph and Sovereign) to recognise the function of the Imam and to proclaim it tothe world.
IV. THE MUSHA'SHA*
Aspand, too, had to deal with heresy, viz. the Musha'sha' movement which, on the social plane, had perhaps an even greater significance. His reaction, however, was quite different, and it has already been said that the ultimate aim ofhis persecution ofthe Musha'sha' was not so much their extermination as the hope ofreducing their leaders totheir rightful rank ofvassals obedient tothe wishes oftheir legitimate Shl'I sovereign. The Musha'sha' movement originated in circles that, strictly speaking, were not Iranian and inareas where many ofthe inhabitants were Arabs, though it is true that Ibn Battiita located aPersian popula
tion in Havlza, which was later to become their capital.1 Typologically, however, this was an entirely Iranian heresy, so much so that the more modern BabI offshoot of the Twelver Shl'a seems to have modelled itself upon it inits various stages ofdevelopment and inits degrees of heretical intensity. Thus a description ofthe religious situation in Iran during the period in question would be incomplete without some reference tothis movement.
The political situation, which is dealt with more fully in an earlier chapter, was characterised by an alteration of military successes and reverses on the part of the Musha'sha', who were initially helped by Aspand's policy of trying to winover to his side, in oneway or another, the discontented and unreliable inhabitants of'Arabistan, and by a sort ofcompromise whereby the legitimate authority ofthe Qara Quyunlu was acknowledged in exchange fora measure of frequently disputed autonomy in religious affairs which survived until Isma'il, like Jahan Shah, compelled everyone to embrace orthodox Shi'ism. The

RELIGION
"conversion" of Aspand, in 840/1436—7, leaves open the question whether he took this step as a counter-offensive against the founder of the Musha'sha' heresy, who in that very year had launched his campaign among the local tribes, declaring that he was the Mahdl; or whether the public declaration by Muhammad that he himself was the long-awaited Mahdl was possibly an unconscious reaction to the authority of Aspand, who since his conversion had become the legitimate religious — as well as political — leader. What is certain is that the grave economic situation in 'Arabistan, where problems existed that could not be solved by means of a new siydsa Shar'iyya, gave the Musha'sha' movement plenty of scope for manoeuvre. It also gave them a kind of moral authority for their expansionist activities when they decided to set up an ideal structure, permeated by the wish to achieve consistency between the religious problems and the civil elements, in accordance with the principle of the perfect prince and a religious State that has remained an unrealised alternative throughout the history of Islam. In any case, having recognised the complex nature of the relationship between the Shl'I sovereign and the equally Shl'I group facing him as his revolutionary opponent in the political as well as in the religious field, it is to the latter that we must turn our attention if we wish to provide analysis of some of the most typical stages of an evolution through which, it would appear, every heresy that can be called Iranian must necessarily pass. The focal point of the Musha'sha' theory (known to us thanks to an
unpublished Kaldm al-Mahdt brought to light by A. Kasravl)1 is the person of the Mahdl, which signifies the immanence of the Imam, conceived as a transcendent entity mediating between the Creator and his creatures in the metaphysically existential act which, through the process of creation, distinguishes the one from the other. Proceeding along these lines, the Musha'sha' (or, to be more precise, the two most interesting protagonists from the religious point of view, the founder Muhammad b. Falah and his son 'All) reached a halfway point in the ideal development of Mahdism, which began with the Isma'IlI affirmation of the Imam's participation in the divine essence and ended with the BabI movement, which claimed that the divinity had been manifested in the Imam. Muhammad b. Falah would seem, however, to

THE MUSHA SHA
have progressed gradually in his religious evolution and in his career as leader of a community —unless of course this was merely tactical caution in the ever more explicit diffusion of his message. Two statements of his which were not necessarily intended as imposture can be quoted as cases in point: the declaration he made to the governor of Vasit, following the takflr of his teacher Ahmad b. Fahd, to the effect that he was a suf I and a follower of the Sunna; and his words when, on being confronted with an 'alim sent from Baghdad to refute his extremist position, he boasted that he had always applied the Shari'a. Now it is a fact that from the historical point of view the Musha'sha' (the etymology of the word is obscure, but it may be connected with the
idea of "light" or "ray", from the root)1 was one of those movements organised along the lines of a confraternity, the birth and development of which were realised in sufism — under whose authority they placed themselves — during the 7th/ 13 th and 8 th/14th centuries in particular.
The 9th/15th century organisations are different, principally by virtue of their platform of social and economic reform which frequently allowed them to set up a parallel military organisation among their disciples, as is clearly shown by the continually expressed desire of their leaders to observe scrupulously the law and the Sunna. Nevertheless, among the Musha'sha' the subsequent religious evolution was the result not of a group approach as in the case of the Qizilbash, but of their leaders' individual elaborations. Muhammad b. Falah began his career by proclaiming himself wall of the Mahdi (the Twelfth Imam), thus characterising himself as leader of the. jihad in a typically Shi'i sense, in order to bring about, in the name of the Mahdi, the indispensable moment of the Test, i.e. establishing who was for the Mahdi and who was against him.
This type of logic can be reconciled both with the most classical principles of Twelver ideology and with the most normal Shi'I interpretation of Qur'an x, 99— 100, if one bears in mind that for the Shl'is each verse is always a %ahir expression of a more obscure substance. Muhammad, however, denied that any such verification by the Mahdi himself was possible, since it was one of the Mahdi's prerogatives (and here we see the influence of contemporary social aspirations) that he was invincible and omnipotent, so that, vis-a-vis the Mahdi, both good and wicked men would be in an identical position, since they would be

RELIGION
bound to recognise him. In this there was already a heresy, even though it was camouflaged by a sophism. Soon, however, caution was thrown to the winds, for the Test was to be followed by a period of yihiir (manifestation) and Muhammad b. Falah declared that he was thehijdb (shield) of the Mahdl, while his son 'All went so far as to maintain that he himself was God, by a process based on one of those syllogisms so typical of extremist movements: the Mahdl is 'All; 'All is God; I, the Mahdl, am 'All; I am God. In any case, the fact remains that, although the respective positions of father and son may appear to have been different (in his correspondence with Pir Budaq, Muhammad b. Falah apologised for his son's conduct, comparing his position with that of 'All, who had allowed Abu Bakr to assume an office for which he was not destined, in the same way as God, in spite of his infinite foresight, had created Iblls), the religious premiss is the same. This conception of the Mahdl was based on a clear distinction between the historical figure and his metaphysical nature, expressed in a terminology whose lucidity confirms the originality of the Musha'sha' way of thinking. Thus the Twelfth Imam, being alive as a category, might also be dead, and not merely "hidden" in the evanescent person of Muhammad b. Hasan al-'Askari. And following this line of thought there was no real difference between him and the Prophet, or between him and the other Imams. All of them were the Twelfth Imam, and the actual death of any one of them was in its turn nothing but ghaiba on the conceptual plane from which their existence stems. It was therefore prophesied that each one of them would return, because the substance of the Imam was invariable, whereas the body in which he appeared was variable. In other words, in the actual prophetic cycle the divine function was expressed in the silsila leading up to the Eleventh Imam, whereas the function entrusted to the Twelfth (the Return ^wr excellence) was now to be realised in his hijab Muhammad b. Falah. The transition accomplished by 'All, in claiming to be the substance of the metaphysical principle of the Imam, seems to have been an esoteric stage of what his father had exoterically preached rather than an extremist extension of the concept from which it derived. And in the field of realisation it was 'All who plundered and defiled the tomb of 'All b. Abl Talib, while it fell to the father to punish severely the ghdli even when they were his own followers, in a manner sometimes reminiscent of Kharijite ideas. (And yet this punctilious guardian of the Sharfa was also the author of canonical formulae for the ziyara to himself, on the lines of the classical Imamite formulae.)
628



THE QIZILBASH
It is also worth noting bow the Qur'anic Christ, too, tends to be absorbed in this explanatory vision of the Imam. Strange tales were circulated concerning the dead Christ worshipped by Christians, almost as if he were a real, i.e. material, figure. The Qur'an, on the contrary, tells not so much the "true story" of Christ as the story of Christ as an immortal, ever-present spirit. This duality, and the fact that the legends derived from Christological mythology differ from the Muslim versions, whether Shl'I or orthodox, suggest Mandaean views were exerting their influence through a mechanism of borrowings whose starting-point cannot be established with any certainty. For example, the Christians' Jesus Christ is said to have had his head cut off and sent to a prostitute at Najaf, on the grounds that the cult practised there was idolatrous, since 'All was the living God, in Egypt {sic); in other words, Christ is John the Baptist, but the John of the Christians, whereas a quality attributed by the Mandaeans to the Baptist - that he could not be wounded with a sword — is also one of the miraculous attributes of the Musha'sha' Mahdi, just as the "death in the river" of 'All b. Muhammad reminds us of the death of John according to the Mandaeans. Nor is this all, for the attribution to the "Magi", by Muhammad b. Falah, of the veneration of Bukht al-nassar (Nebuchadnezzar), too hastily rejected as absurd by Kasravl, might also imply a Mandaean link with very ancient forms of Irano-Semitic syncretism.
On the other hand, much of our information on Musha'sha' beliefs (a striking example is the dhikr 'All Allah) can be compared with what more recent writers have attributed to the Ahl-i haqq. This and other analo
gies — the Safavid coin called Huvaiza (Havlza) used in initiations1 give us an idea of the continuity of the connective tissue in the religious life of the period in question, which leads on to broader and more composite issues, such as the complex problem of the Qizilbash.
V. THE QIZILBASH
The Qizilbash movement constitutes the meeting-point and the melting-pot of the various elements — or at any rate the most significant among them - of the religious life of the 9th/15 th century. It is not, however, a zone of light amidst the obscurity characteristic of the period, for the presence of diverse motives in the movement produced

RELIGION
composite, eclectic and contradictory results. The movement could be described as an ethnographical-religious complex localised, during the period we are discussing, in Asia Minor, principally in a geographical belt extending from the Lebanese — Syrian border to the Azarbafjan frontier. Its members were drawn from Turkish tribes, but that the term Qizilbash (literally "men with red caps") was, ethnographically speaking, vague is demonstrated by the number of different connotations that it acquired at different times and in different places. Subsequent to its
origination in Dzhungaria,1 it was used in eastern Turkestan to denote
the Shl'Is;2 in Asia Minor it was often used as an alternative for the term 'alavt; for the Ottomans it meant a member of a secret society, a heterodox person, or, in the 16th century, the Safavid enemy; in Russia it became a synonym for Persian, and later, by extension, Asian; and among the Volga Tartars it was used to denote a cunning man (a
merchant, often a Persian merchant).3 The different ways in which this word was used independently of ethnical entities shows that it had an ideological content that became fused with the concept "Persian", i.e. schismatic, in the same way as the Persians themselves were defined in antithesis to the Ottomans. This, however, did not occur until a victorious Qizilbash movement under Shah Isma'Il had first made its contribution to Iranian religious life and then suffered what was essentially a repulse, being reduced, by a humiliating process of absorption, to the more commonplace, yet still heretical, connotation of official Safavid Shi'ism. The internal dialectic of all 15 th-century extremist movements seems, in fact, to have led to a kind of self-camouflage, through which certain religious forms survive under different names or as original contributions to the great stream of Twelver Shi'ism. Despite this, the most striking innovatory feature, that particular religious attitude which could still be described as ghuluww and which acted as the catalyst of new social demands, was paradoxically eliminated at the very moment when a certain degree of political equilibrium might theoretically have enabled it to be utilised in a new type of society.
Whereas the Sarbadars can be described as the first link in the sufl chain leading to the Musha'sha', its most outstanding element is undoubtedly represented by the Qizilbash. It now becomes self-evident that the particular kind of religious feeling permeating, with its longing for renewal, the conscience of the Iranian Islamic world at that

THE QIZILBASH
time, had as its essential component a certain type of sufism. Or, to be more precise, we should speak, not of sufism, but of that particular evolution in the sufI world, and in the relations existing between the members of the confraternities, which, as we have seen, was based on the communion - drawn from the Twelver Shl'a - between the Shaikh as vicar of legitimate religious authority and his murids; these latter in accordance with the classical Shi'I procedure, were to be the "proofs" of his intentions, that is of his truthful madhhab. The gradual transition from the ascetic mission to identification with the task assigned by hagiography to the Mahdl, concludes with his declaring himself to be the Mahdl, and thereby the ma%har of God in this world.
The Shaikhs of Ardabll were precisely this in the eyes of those who turned to them, and the stages which they proposed are already comprehended in the evolution of the relationship between Shaikhs and their supporters. In other cases both the figure of the sayyid, though invested with an authority not solely due to his birth but recognised and demanded from below (the sayyids of Bam were examples of this during the first half of the 15 th century), and that of the Shaikh, whose position was very similar to that of the Caliph, though in less universalistic terms (we need only think of Shah Ni'mat-Allah Vail), remain so to speak experiences crystallised in time, without any of that evolution which facts and circumstances seemed logically to require.
The union between Qizilbash and the Shaikhs of Ardabll was a military relationship having, in its turn, no original features, which provided a practical solution for that reciprocity of duties and obligations which formed part of the relationship between the Shaikh and his followers. Seen in this light, the personal attitude of individual Shaikhs — that is to say, when they were "converted" to Shi'ism, the type of Shi'ism which they embraced and how much of the Qizilbash aberrations had entered into the religion of the man whom they recognised as their leader - becomes of secondary importance. The key element seems to be, above all, Junaid's awareness of the military potential latent in the order and the fact that in beginning preparations for his "reign" he developed it with the full consent of the Qizilbash, who then responded with fanatical enthusiasm to the appeals of the Shaikhs up to the time of Isma'H's victory. Hence the particular reaction of the sovereigns then ruling Azarbaljan who, whether they were Aq Quyunlu or Qara Quyunlu, displayed a mistrust which sometimes erupted into open hostility. This is understandable when we remember
631



RELIGION
the more or less conscious desire, on the part of authorities who were afraid of being bypassed, to surround themselves with a halo of religious legitimacy. It also explains the religious preparations for the reign of Isma'Il, and the burden that he had to bear as a result of his presumed infallibility, which found expression in a theopathic enthusiasm, counterbalanced by his consent to the compromise offered by the Twelver Shl'a. The religious folklore of the Qizilbash, in contrast to their spiritual ideas, which were typically Iranian, had been borrowed from Asia Minor, the religious outlook of which was by definition heretical, open to every kind of eclecticism and already endowed with a heritage of complex religious forms. On to the rites of an orgiastic nature with which the Qizilbash carry on extremely ancient Anatolian traditions, and on to the elements of a Christianity hostile to orthodoxy, Islam imposes a graft of plebeian social aspirations of a dissenting and vaguely communistic nature, such as those of the Qalandars and the Jalalls, combined, in this specific case, with the expectation of the imminent coming of the MahdI. From this point of view it is difficult to separate the religious forms of the Qizilbash from those of the Bektashls, who according to Gordlevskil were the "codifiers" of the fluid Qizilbash religiosity maintained by the various wandering dervishes of the 16th century. The orthodox party accused them of forming secret societies, at the meetings of which ritual orgies were celebrated, including incest and pederasty, but these accusations do not differ greatly from the sins attributed by orthodox Islam to any heretical movement.
On the other hand, heresy did not prevent a movement which seems to represent the codification of that trend of Anatolian Qizilbash religiosity, which prevailed in the Kurdish area, i.e. the Ahl-i haqq, from rinding the necessary links with Twelver tradition. Indeed, were it not for the fact that the texts dealing with Ahl-i haqq religious ideas are too modern to allow us to consider them here, it would seem more correct to regard the BektashI, Ahl-i haqq and Qizilbash movements as slightly different expressions of the same religious form. For the Qizilbash as well as for the BektashI, authority was vested in a centralist leader who chose to rule the various communities his representatives - dede or bdba - who in their turn made use of an intermediary in dealing with the tdlib. One of their distinctive signs was the ear-ring worn on the left ear, which in the case of a dede signified asceticism

THE QIZILBASH
and chastity. Among the Bektashls, even today, the chiefs wear sleeveless robes like those of the Armenian peasants, but the most characteristic feature of their costume is the peaked twelve-banded red cap, the taj-i haidan, variously explained as symbolising the Twelve Imams or else resulting from Christian influence (the twelve Apostles), transmitted through the Armenians, from whom they have also borrowed certain practices relating to fasts. Another external sign is beard-kissing as a form of greeting — a beard being regarded as indispensable, for anybody dying without one is considered as doomed to unhappiness. A counterpart to these visible signs is an esoteric sign, understood only by initiates, viz. the star symbolising the light of the intellect and the soul, which shone in a Qizilbash and distinguished him from others. Incidentally, the Qizilbash are sometimes called ot-dinli, or "worshippers of grass", owing to a belief (also current among the Bektashls), which might be characterised as of Dahrite origin, in the eternity of natural matter undergoing continual change. This belief led them to a pantheistic (or perhaps more precisely HurufI) attitude based on uninterrupted communication between God and his creatures; that is why, for instance, they swear by grass and by 'All while beating the ground with a stick. Another name for the Qizilbash is chirdgh-sondiiren ("extinguishers of the light"), reminiscent of one of the Ahl-i haqq sects which is similarly called KhamushI in Persian, just as the name Da'udi ("worshippers of David") applies both to some Ahl-i haqq and to certain Qizilbash from Sivas.
In addition to the normal veneration for 'All and the fraternal banquet — the Bektashi "communion"— another custom, recorded, for example, among the Kach-Kiri Kurdish tribe, is the funeral banquet which may throw some light on the charge of cannibalism that has
been brought against the Qizilbash,1 believed to be in the habit of setting fire to their dead and eating them instead of burying them. As a matter of fact the funeral repast is consumed on the spot, on the tomb of the deceased, after the rite of lamentation, and consists of the scattering of yoghurt and morsels of a specially prepared sacred loaf, all of which is offered to the friends present at the ceremony. Another characteristic custom is the confession of their sins which the Qizilbash make to their dede. The latter ties a tape round the neck of the

RELIGION
penitent, who has then to bring the dede an offering, marking the door with a cross as he enters. After this the tape is removed and the sins are written down and burned. The person of the dede is considered sacred and everything he touches is thereby sanctified, and so too is the earth covering his tomb and the dust on which his horse has trodden, the latter being carefully collected because of its miraculous properties. On certain occasions the young women would come to kiss the dede, who singing mysterious songs would choose one of them to be his companion for the night; on the morning after the dede is washed and the water distributed among the various households. All these hybrid and non-Islamic elements exist side by side with a deep reverence for Shi'ism, as is shown not only by the link with 'All, who, with his attributes of holder of temporal authority and repository of the divine secret, is the central figure in this type of religious belief, but also by a social organisation reminiscent of certain Zaidite politico-social experiments, as well as by sufl ideas, which, as we have seen, were impregnated with Twelver Shi'ism during the 15 th century. The sufl influence in its turn found its way into the Shl'a, at the popular level changing concepts into ritual practices and widening the devotional field, which previously had been limited to the Twelve Imams.
It was against a background of the kind that we have just described that there suddenly emerged the figure of Shah Isma'Il, who personifies success in the historical and religious situation we are studying. In his own person he comprehended the qualities of a spiritual leader, a military commander, and a legislative reformer aware of the economic needs of his followers, as is clearly shown by, among others, Sanudo in his Diarii. These qualities were exemplified in his public career, for he realised the basic aspirations of the Qizilbash movement and those of the other heretical and dissenting bodies active at that time. He was a sufl, but in such a way as to transcend a shaikh's ordinary role, acting as an intermediary with God along lines which placed him closer to God than to the creatures to whom he gave witness. In this sense he was the long-awaited leader and his military successes were regarded as proofs of the superhuman nature of his task. His aspirations were identical with those of all the other "Messiahs" of the time, namely the creation of a State in which religious ideology would be
634



identified with political necessity. Nevertheless, once he had risen to power, this did not prevent Isma'Il from accepting political compromises and fusing them with his religious beliefs - and this not only on a personal level. But in spite of his heretical acts — such as proclaiming himself 'All, or God, or disdaining to follow the dictates of the Sharl'a — Isma'Il combined in his own person two conflicting aspirations of Islam, which, however, have not always led to antithetical consequences: a need for individualistic religious expression, which was the mainspring of sufism in the more generic significance of the term, and an urge to socialise every kind of experience by translating it into terms of the common weal. Isma'Il was thus a typical Islamic condottiere - in other words, a "true Caliph", a new embodiment of what was symbolised by 'All throughout the history of Islam, whether orthodox or not.
Western sources describe Isma'Il as a new prophet and provide us with evidence of the Mahdist and reforming aspect of his mission as well as of the fanaticism of his followers, whose relationship to their leader was of the peculiar military-religious type mentioned above. Isma'Il is also depicted as a friend of the Christians, in contrast to the Ottomans who were considered the enemy par excellence. This is, in a way, a Venetian cliche, which, however, has some foundation as far as Isma'H's changing attitude to the jihad is concerned. Ever since Junaid's time the Shaikhs of Ardabll, by extending their power to the temporal field, were conditioned in their tactics for its consolidation by the jihad, which presented the only religiously admissible method in a community as fundamentally Islamic as that of the Qizilbash. Their most natural enemies were obviously the Christians, firmly established to the north of the Ardabll sphere of influence, but the wavering policy of the Qara Quyunlu produced what might be called a territorial landslide in the Shaikhs' interests when they became the heirs of this policy. The result was a new interpretation of the jihad, directed no longer against the Christians but against the SunnI Ottomans, as soon as the buffer represented by the Aq Quyunlu, who in their turn were also Sunnls, was eliminated. The religious element in the Safavid conception of the jihad was gradually trivialised into the normal allegations of impiety in accordance with the classical formulae of disputes between Sunnls and Shl'Is; but until the battle of Chaldiran the arguments used in this connection rank from the point of view of kalam, and even of Mu'tazilite kalam, among Isma'H's most outspoken affirmations of

RELIGION
heterodoxy. At least, this is the case if we are to believe Sanudo's Diarii, of which the following is a typical passage:
He took a Turk named Talisman and asked him where God was; and he replied that God was in Heaven, whereupon he caused the Turk to be cut in two. And then he took another man, a Christian priest from Armenia, and he asked him where God was; and he replied that God was in Heaven and upon earth and pointed to him who was listening.
And he said: "Let him go, for this man knows where God is."1
In the Western sources Isma'H is called the Soft, Sophi, Sufi or Soffi,a name which is also applied to his successors. That sufl and Safavl were confused, in the way exemplified by the passage where Pietro della Valle, speaking of the Ardabll tombs, confuses the "Sofi" (Isma'Il)
with SafI [al-dln],2 would explain why the "surname" of the Safavid dynasty is not given in any other form. For Europeans, in fact, the sufis are identical with the Safavid tariqa? This is the case even when a correct etymology and explanation of the word sufl are given in the
texts, e.g. in Rota4 or in Don Juan of Persia,5 who denies that it had any connection with the term "sophist", or again in the remark of an English traveller to the effect that the King of Persia would not be very
pleased if he knew that in the West he was called the "Great Beggar".6 In any case, since those Western texts which mention the word sufl do not do so in order to stress its mystical connotation, the European interpretation of this term does not coincide fully with the local meaning, even if any hypothetical confusion is taken into account. In Persia mystics are not normally called sufl, but the fact remains that contemporary Persian sources use the word to denote certain Safavid murids, and in particular, to cite one example, to denote the seven dervishes who accompanied Isma'Il when he left Gllan and the reinforcements he
subsequently received during the march from Lahljan to Tarum;7 later

on the term was also used to denote those members of the Safavid confraternity who were intimates of the shah, i.e. the Sbabisavant,
especially those from the Shamlu, Rumlu and Qajar tribes.1 This is most probably the reason why the term reached the West as nothing but a synonym for Qizilbash or Safavid. The Qizilbash sufls provided the group from among which were chosen the various
khalifasand the khalifat al-khulafd, i.e. the vicar-general of the murshid-i kdmil, the sovereign and only effective head of the brotherhood. The heaviest burden of the rules of honourable conduct towards the sovereign fell on the sufI, and as late as the reign of Isma'Il II a sufI who lied
to his sovereign would be put to death;2 'Abbas I used the term nd-sufi to denote misbehaviour (IOOI/I 592-3) and called a betrayal in the year 1023/1614-15 a nd-siifi-gari? Under 'Abbas II and Sulaiman the sufls met in a hall called the td'iis-khdna, but gradually the importance of the category declined and some of the suf is were engaged in the humblest occupations, e.g. as sweepers, porters or executioners. At the time of its greatest splendour the Safavid confraternity granted to the sufl the religious privileges that it conferred upon its leaders: a morsel of their food had the virtues of sbafd'a and the khalifat al-khulafa granted remission of sins in public meetings, beating the penitents with a stick in accordance with the customs and rites of the Anatolian Qizilbash and BektashI communities which we have already mentioned. In this connection the report of an ambassador, Michele Membre, who visited the court of Shah Tahmasp on behalf of the Venetian Republic, contains a detailed account of the ceremony of public confession as practised in 1540 and lays particular stress on details of a ritual character (the fact that the sinners prostrated themselves when begging for remission and that they were publicly called upon to do so in a certain order) and on those of a cabalistic HurufI nature (the stick representing
the letter alif etc.).4
In the religious career of Shah Isma'Il we can discern a veritable parabola. Between the time when he left Gllan with the seven sufls and his coronation at Tabriz he devoted himself with profound conviction to his mission as a new prophet-divinity; while the Qizilbash, against a background that was not only military and political but above all religious, represented the embryo of a new society that had still to be

RELIGION
built up, and acted as a social element which, while accepting the new message, could provide the guarantees — necessary according to the Muslim way of thinking - that the declarations and appeals of the leader were genuine. The official disavowal of this attempt came at Tabriz when Isma'Il
recited the khutba in the names of the Twelve Imams,1 thus declaring his support for the Twelver Shl'a in the traditional way of a sovereign, which even found a reflection (admittedly merely formal) in the
tenuous reform of the taj-i haidarl.2 This fact, however, does not appear to have had a decisive influence on the religious personality of Isma'Il, who continued to regard himself as the elected one and as a conqueror, that is to say as the Imam of his day according to Qizilbash ideas, which obviously went beyond any Twelver definition of the term Imam.
The peak of his religious crisis may be historically placed after the defeat at Chaldiran, which Isma'Il seems to have accepted as a test designed to confute his divine mission. After that a change became apparent in his policy, which perceptibly turned Iran toward the east, as contrasted with the 15th-century tradition which regarded it as an alternative to Ottoman domination. It was at this stage that the great betrayal became irreversible, in respect not only of the Qizilbash ideal, but more specifically of the members of the brotherhood conceived of as the supporting structure of that now vanished ideal. A vivid echo of the religious vicissitudes of Isma'Il and his followers can be found not so much in historical chronicles (e.g. the questionable events of 1512) as in the literary cycle revolving around certain Turkmen variants of the legend of KIr-oghlu, apparently a hero of thejaldli type belonging to the Takkalu tribe, one of the most extreme among those making up the Qizilbash movement and also, partly for geographical reasons, one
of the most susceptible to non-Islamic influences.3
To a fundamentally ShI'I programme, based on the expectation of the Mahdl and the acknowledgement of the spiritual powers of the sovereign, were added various extremist elements of the QarmatoIsma'Iliyya type, symbolised by communitarian ideas of the ideal State,

reflecting perhaps an experience of the Sarbadar type. Despite the modifications of this legend to meet the circumstances (among the Uzbeks we find the extreme case of the hero being an enemy of the Qizilbash), everything seems to point here to a definitely Qizilbash conception of history — the key to which is provided by a Bulgarian variant in which it is definitely stated that Kir-oghlu was a Qizilbash more especially as regards the hero-sovereign relationship. We have on the one hand BektashI historical disengagement, which characterises the hero as a member of the tarlqa of 'All, the Mahdi etc, and on the other a trend towards a more perceptive description of the hero as a victim of the shah, for whom, although no longer a Messiah, the hero continues to fight. The figure of the sovereign is deliberately left vague; he is not a symbol of oppression and betrayal, these tasks being normally left to an emissary, but an accomplice and supporter of the anti-ideal pursued to the disadvantage of Kir-oghlu, who by definition is the shah's hero.
Another indication of Isma'Il's religious compromise stands out in typically legalitarian aspect against the background of the more and more "orthodox" character of his virtual conversion to what was obviously Twelver Shi'ism, even though its first manifestation is not chronologically defined by our sources: namely the claim to the siydda which, explicit already in Isma'Il and even more precisely asserted by his successors, was retroactively attributed to his ancestors by the panegyrists and emendators of texts. On this point, too, the Western, and particularly the Venetian, sources are helpful. We need only re
member the first items of information recorded by Sanudo.1 Contemporary Eastern texts, when speaking of Isma'Il, still tend to call him shaikh-ogblu or even Ardabil-oghlu2 (cf. the term shaikh-dvand used to denote relatives of the sovereign), without normally referring to his title of sayyid husaini. And yet this claim, which had its period of incubation and partial realisation in the years before the battle of Chaldiran, acquired in serving as a strongly anti-Qizilbash move the value of a well-planned political decision at a moment when the sovereign had given up his Imamite aspirations: his power was now supported by a new form of authority which, being more traditional, was endowed with sufficient legality to place a bond of obligation on

the Shl'I Iranian aristocracy which had by now inherited the privileged
position formerly held by the Qizilbash.1
VII. TAHMASP AND ISMA'lL II
The history of this reciprocal granting of favours was repeated in a more decisive way under Tahmasp, though with an irregular rhythm reflecting the religious involution of Isma'Il's successor, and it culminated in the violent and systematic repression of the Qizilbash carried out by 'Abbas I. When the youthful Tahmasp ascended the throne, he was steeped in the spirit of his preceptors and advisers; thus, like his father, he inaugurated his reign along the lines of Qizilbash teaching and then renewed, in a minor key, the experiment of transition to the traditional forms of Twelver Shi'ism. Obviously Tahmasp was, so to speak, born a Twelver, and did not inherit from his father the pride in a mission to be accomplished by him as a prophet-Mahdl. But despite the conventional trappings with which he surrounded himself following his accession to the throne, his figure remained isolated amidst the orthodox Shi'I establishment, which only later succeeded in obtaining his complete surrender. This was due to a particular conception of sovereignty, still strictly bound up with Qizilbash religious demands which it would be wrong, because only very approximate, to describe as being autocratic - and determined by the ethico-political trend towards a unified conception of the State-religion hendiadys, which still demanded renewal, reforms, and the elimination of old structures. In this respect, Tahmasp at first continued the anti-Ottoman policy, and it was precisely during the least Twelver phase of his reign - and perhaps not altogether by chance - that the religious aspect of Iran seems to have undergone an effortless change, with the result that Shi'ism acquired a greater degree of homogeneity. It seems legitimate to see in this grandiose phenomenon of conversion, not so much the abandonment of old systems or a break with juridical traditions, but
1 The lack of unanimity in the documentary sources suggested to Kasravl that Isma'Il never proclaimed himself a sayyid (cf. Aubin, "fitudes Safavides I", pp . 44—5 and 44 n. 4), but to me it seems to denote uncertainty on Isma'H's part, which is confirmed by the oft-quoted passage from Sanudo's Diarii iv, cols. 191-2: "...and his father said that he was a relative of Mahomet; and then his father died; ... and he says that my father was not my father, but he was my slave; and he says that he himself is God..." In other words, Isma'Il may have regarded the siyada, at times, as a handicap in his mission. If this reasoning is correct, then Isma'Il was simply reaffirming, without conviction, a claim already made by his father Haidar.

TAHMASP AND ISMA'lL II
rather atransition towards anew conception of the State, which was accepted because it clarified — or at any rate set out to clarify — the relationship between the sovereign and his subjects, and consequently between political praxis and Islam. This did not imply a reaffirmation of those divine attributes which Isma'Il had specifically renounced, since he had preferred asimple temporal investiture; but it did mean that there was a supreme idealisation of the temporal leader as a guarantor of the preparations for the blissful era of the Mahdl and also of the continuity of the Islamic past, as represented by the claim, from now on loudly proclaimed everywhere, that the sovereign belonged to the Ahlal-bait. And, at the same time, this could be considered thefirst actual manifestation ofa nationalistic kind of claim, according to
which regality wasderived from the ancient rulers of Iran.1
An analysis ofthe situation inTabriz at three critical moments between 907/1501, the year of Isma'Il's coronation, and 942/1535, the date of the reconquest of the city by Tahmasp after it had been occupied by Siileyman, serves to validate our hypothesis of the conversion of Iran — or at least of the larger urban centres — to Twelver Shi'ism. In 907/1501 Tabriz was in a position similar to that ofKashan (see above), in the sense that there were neither Ja'fari texts nor, consequently, juridical experts — a circumstance which is normally attributed
to the predominance of Sunnism in the first Safavid capital.2 The sources do not record any drastic measures taken to remedy the situation, and this leads one to suppose that in Tabriz, as in Kashan, there was aslow evolution from atype of Shafi'ism towards astricter form of Ja'farism. In 920/1514, when Selim occupied Tabriz after the battle of Chaldiran, he did not deem it necessary totake any repressive measures, probably because to him the city appeared to be still SunnI (and this despite the fact that he had just ordered the massacre of 40,000 Anatolian Qizilbash). For the following twenty years, from this point of view, Tabriz has, as it were, no history. When Siileyman arrived in 942/1535, however, it would seem that the city had completely changed; in other words ithad become Shl'I. Venetian sources tell us that many janissaries went over to the other side and that the populace rose against the Ottoman foe and greeted the Shl'I Tahmasp

as a liberator.1 The description of so oddly compliant — and yet com
plete — a conversion is confirmed by a passage in Membre's report.2 There Tabriz is described as a typically Shi'I and almost "modern" city, where by "modern" we refer to the "form" which characterises any Shi'I Iranian city, distinguishing it from the towns of any other Islamic country, and which is not merely based on rituals such as the observance of Muharram or the public execration of the first Caliphs. It is also based on certain religious factors inspired both by sentiment and by folklore which, as we shall see, acquired a canonical form in the days of MajlisI and were based on a whole set of examples of "coexistence" with the Twelve Imams, including prophecies, miracles, apparitions and dreams — all this in a setting which was halfway between the everyday life and the realm of myths. The modern originality of Persian Shi'ism has its roots here, and in this sense Tahmasp can serve as a symbol: after a beginning marked by his Qizilbash background he soon fell under the influence of the Shi'I 'ulama, the first notable occasion being his contacts, during the 1530s, with the sayyids
of Uskuya near Tabriz.3 Although the influx of new contingents of immigrants from Anatolia continued throughout his reign (at Qazvln alone there were ten thousand new immigrants at the time of the sovereign's death, which would seem to indicate that Isma'Il's betrayal
had not taught them an effective lesson),4 the administrative framework shows signs of the arrival of this new component on the political scene, although its influence was obviously by no means undisputed. Tahmasp is thus the first modern Persian Shi'I about whom we have information drawn not only from oriental sources (including the significant and searching autobiography of the sovereign himself) but also from reports by Western observers among which that of Membre gives us a lucid account of the early period, while the better known work by d'Alessandri deals with the latter years of the monarch's reign. And as a conclusion to this theologico-sentimental edifice of which he was at once the champion and the victim, in his last years Tahmasp was seized with a veritable mania for conservation: it replaced his already languishing anti-Ottoman ardour and led him to cut himself off from the world and to waste his time in commonplace activities that served as palliatives to his suspicions and fears, rendered more acute by con

tinual dreams which were his only guide whenever he had to make a public decision. It seems that there could have been no logical reaction to Tahmasp's clerical and bigoted Shi'ism other than an attempt to reintroduce into Iran "the impure and wicked commands of the damned Abu Bakr,
'Uthman and others...", which is how Minadoi1 describes Isma'Il IPs efforts to restore Sunnism in his domains. In actual fact, Iran had been gradually tending towards definitely Shl'I forms, especially in the larger cities, where the need to safeguard old-established interests by adopting an attitude as close as possible to that of the sovereign was most urgently felt. As invariably happens, the rural areas had revealed a more conservative spirit, though the character of the whole country was determined by the common denominator of an expected restoration of the old and pure Sharl'a, as an antidote to economic difficulties that had never been solved. Isma'Il II's Sunnism was in its turn an invocation to the Sharl'a, with the intention of providing himself with a weapon which would enable him to undermine the power of the Shl'I 'ulama by establishing a new balance of power between the Iranian aristocracy and the Qizilbash tribes still active in the political field, since, owing to their mutual rivalry, both these elements were not unwilling to give him a sure degree of support. At any rate, although it is possible to describe, with a certain approximation to truth, the political motivation of such a decision as anticlericalism, an appeal to the rural peasantry, an obligation of the Sharl'a or diplomatic opportunism, yet the more specifically religious mechanism underlying it remains far from clear. Iran was rapidly becoming aware that it was the chosen land of the Imams and that its inhabitants were the repositories of their ta'wil, elements for which the presence of the sovereign, together with certain incipient national and religious ideas, had been a determining factor. To a certain extent the position of Isma'Il II would seem to posit a renunciation of these prerogatives and a greater sympathy for the more mundane needs of the country. Translated into religious terms, this meant a return to the situation that had brought Isma'Il I to the throne, by dint of combating the obscurantist tendencies of Tahmasp's last years, almost in an attitude of anti-family reaction which was later carried to extremes, though within a framework which was again fully and conventionally Shl'I, by Muhammad Khudabanda.

VIII. THE NUQTAVIS
For the reasons stated above it isonce again a heresy that will helpus to understand the spirit of the times more clearly than would a close examination of the official religious policy. The Nuqtavl heresy (the word is derived from nuqta, "point", naturally in the cabalistic sense) began in Gllan as an offshoot of Hurufism under theleadership of Mahmiid Paslkhanl (hence the name Paslkhaniyan sometimes applied to its adherents) and towards the end ofthe 8th/14th century probably represented a form ofopposition tothe stagnant local Shi'ism with its Zaidite tendencies. It acquired, toa certain extent, greater significance during the rule ofIsma'Il II, while itsend asanorganised movement came in the reign of 'Abbas I. Its kinship with Hurufism, which explains theobvious Isma'Ul influences present in Nuqtavl ideology (though we should also bear in mind geographical proximity to Rudbar), lies in the fact that it adopted a still more definite attitude, metaphysically speaking, towards the divine ta'tll, and thereby towards a "Renaissance" appreciation of the value of human actions. Itsrelationship to the accepted Hurufi theory that man is the starting-point for any form of superhuman knowledge is clear. For the Nuqtavl deity, man does not represent an object of activity, and it is man himself who, through self-knowledge, canraise himself up to thedivine sphere. Thus good and evil are measured against an extremely mundane yardstick and the realities of paradise and retribution occur on earth within a period of time which may exceed anybody's lifetime, through a process of metempsychosis corresponding to one's virtues and sins. This belief in metempsychosis, it should benoted, was stressed by a
later writer, Riza Qull Khan Hidayat,1 whose remarks should be interpreted in thelight of a possible subsequent Indian influence on the movement, since its followers, as a result of persecution, eventually fled to India. Instead of the resurrection of the body, however, Nuqtavl metempsychosis appears to envisage a continual process of metamorphosis of matter, considered, in the Dahrite sense, as being eternal. Tothis we must probably add various residual elements that had been present for some time in the very promiscuous substratum of Gllan, such as the belief in the visibility of the mid-day divinity (riding upon an ass like Dajjal, who inIran isnot unconnected with Zahhak)
1 Kiya, "Nuqtaviyan", pp. 43-4.
644



THE NUQTAVIS
and, still more cogently, the classification of the appearance, bodily movements and qualities of human beings as zuhur of the divine
attributes.1 The Nuqtavis, destined to be the alternative par excellence to official 16th-century Shi'ism, were persecuted by Isma'Il I after 1514 and, in a more reactionary manner, by the clerical Tahmasp, who in 973/1565 had one of their leaders blinded and in 981/1573-4 carried out a large-scale repression of the sect at Kashan. After the death of Tahmasp, however, the movement clearly became the mouthpiece of two elements which in my opinion are of decisive importance in determining the religious attitude of Isma'il II: on the one hand, an antiShl'I trend, the theoretical basis of which consisted of the denial of any need for an official intermediary when dealing with the deity, irrespective of whether the intermediary were a wall-imam or the whole body of the Twelver mujtahids acting on behalf of and as substitutes for the Imam; and, on the other hand, the discontented plebeian element which was always ready to try the experiment of an organised protest. During the reign of Tahmasp the most influential groups of Nuqtavis were to be found at Kashan, Isfahan, Shiraz and especially at Qazvln. The dervish Khusrau, a plebeian from Qazvln, became their symbol and guide. His public activities show how closely involved with one another were the movements of this era and how primitive the demands which had led to their formation. The dervish Khusrau "clothed himself as a qalandar" and travelled all over the country before probing deeper into the Nuqtavl doctrine. On his return to Qazvln he began preaching in the mosque at meetings attended by other dervishes and the populace, and this annoyed the 'ulama, who had him summoned to the court. In the presence of the shah - probably Isma'Il II - he questioned the dogmas of Islam and the "pure faith of the Imam", but "did not depart from the Sharl'a", to improve his knowledge of which he had been attending fiqh lessons given by the 'ulama themselves. He was pardoned in the name of Sharl'a orthodoxy, which in the social spirit of Islam ranked higher than the ambiguities of pure kalam. Further information on the complex structure of the sect is provided by subsequent events (especially the increasing number of plebeians among his followers), culminating in the takflr launched by 'Abbas I, who had been present at a discussion between a famous

Nuqtavl known as Yusuf the artisan andthe qalandar Kuchik in the course of which the heretical nature of Khusrau's doctrine is said to have become clear, andthe resulting "jest of the stars" (the title ofa well-known novella byAkhundov), in which this same Yusuf took the place of 'Abbas on the throne for three days before being killed
(1002/1593-4).l The presence of an element that may betermed sufl in the outward sense of its organic structure (compare, for instance, the tekke founded bythe dervish Khusrau) has no bearing on the fact that the brotherhood spirit, strengthened in religious terms, now appeared to beparadoxically anti-mystical in so far as it was anti-individualistic. This would seem to have created around the movements influenced by it a margin within which it was possible to achieve a political compromise by means of an increasingly skilful use of the taqiyya, camouflaged under the officially recognised esotericism ofthe various tariqas. On theother hand the Shl'I religious class soon perceived the ambiguity of such anattitude, and the reaction to this new type of sufism took the form of a more precise limitation of the boundaries of Twelver Iran.
IX. THE HEYDAY OF THE SAFAVID ERA
The official religious history of the Safavid era, beginning with 'Abbas I, is in fact concerned with three fundamental problems: the condemnation of sufism; thejuridical codification aimed at solving according to fiqh those contradictions and differences of opinion which would have been so much more dangerous if they had led to theological definitions (on the theological refinements reserved for privileged members and initiates ofthe so-called "school ofIsfahan", see Chapter 13); and, lastly, the promulgation of the new Majlisian theology, a counterpoint to that feeling based on folklore and ritual which, as has been said, is typical of modern Shi'ism. In its official form anti-sufl feeling in Safavid Iran after the reign of 'Abbas I wasnothing but a return to the original standpoint of the Twelver Shf a, traditionally averse to mystical experience. The importance of sufism in the evolution of religion during the 15 th century layin its functional and paradigmatic value. The typical religious forms tried out in the sufl movements had been transplanted into the body ofa dissenting and heretical

Shl'a, whence they were transmitted —emptied, however, of their revolutionary potential — tothe official Safavid clergy. It was mainly a question of the link, equivalent to a precisely established hierarchical relationship, between Shaikh - Mahdl - sovereign and murld - worshipper - subject; of the individualistic mechanism which, operatingin connection with even the most heterodox demands, was inthis casein symbiosis with asocial and collectivist feeling that allowed a retrogressive check onthe experiments carried out by the leader, who was the mouthpiece of aspirations which were indeed general buthadbeen modified by refraction through the prism ofhis personal elaboration. At a time when the Twelver religious class had been stabilised owing to a juridical organisation and a hierarchy stricter than in any other sector ofIslam, to have permitted the survival ofsuch elements outside the organisation would have implied the constant risk of decentralising for an authority already deeply engaged on both the religious andthe political plane, which exhibited a high degree of parallelism and gave each other mutual support. Despite the continual agitation of the qalandars and the aftermath of the elimination of Qizilbash support within the state, the reign of 'Abbas was therefore deeply marked by an anti-mystical spirit, so much so that themost advanced experiments in the religious sphere, viewed with suspicion by the authorities, were only externally tinged with sufism (e.g.the philosopher Mir Damad), and the problems which arose melted away into arefined consciousness and love for theology, this being typical of the period. In any case, the fact that theexternal appearance was sufl in all matters that did not form part of the official Twelver religion bringsus back toconsideration ofthe question as tohow far sufism was usedas a taqiyya during the last century ofSafavid rule, not on'y internally, i.e. to conceal extremist positions that had survived the process ofstandardisation, but also externally, in the sense that minority groups of Sunnls embraced sufism in order toescape victimisation, forthe most part fiscal but in some cases political. Itis known that there were SunnI groups atQazvln even inthe immediate entourage of'Abbas, and also at Hamadan, where in 1017/1608 repressive measures were taken by 'Abbas himself, who accused the SunnI ra'is of the city of ill-treating the Shl'Is and stirring up his own co-religionists. Surkha, tothe west of Simnan, was likewise the scene of persecution in 1599, but under Shah Safl it would seem to have been still SunnI, for in a farman dated

1039/1630 he excluded this village from certain measures of tax
reduction.1 The sole exception was Laristan, whose tenacious Sunnism had been spared even by Shah Isma'Il during the most political phase of his activity. As confirmation of the fact that the definition of suf 1, a vague term inevitably arousing suspicion, covered more than one form of heresy (extremism, Sunnism) involving people whose common bond was dissatisfaction with the way political or religious power was exercised after its centralisation at the end of the Safavid era, we may mention the celebrated defence which Muhammad Baqir al-MajlisI, the mujtahid prince of the late Safavid period (d. 1111/1699—1700), attempted to
make of his father's eclectic and ambivalent attitude to sufism.2 A natural result of the sufl question in the history of Twelver Shi'ism was the solemn takflr proclaimed by the Usull Muhammad 'AH
b. Muhammad Baqir BihbihanI (d. 1216/1801-2),3 which relegated it to that same sphere of obscurantism which according to official Islam whether Shi'I or Sunni - was the domain of all broadly speaking illegal movements bearing the same burden of a general and typical accusation of immorality, contempt for the Sharfa, the drinking of wine and so forth. As regards the progressive simplification of ritual and theology, in the sense of an increasingly frequent appeal to an established authority and a fixed procedure for the various manifestations of religious life, the most striking example was the growth of a particular juridical spirit embracing every kind of religious problem and preparing the way for the theoretical - and not merely de facto - absorption of Twelver Shi'ism by the Islamic umma, as subsequently codified by Nadir Shah. Progress towards the official recognition of the existence of another madhhab besides the four of the canon was marked by lively controversies with the Ottoman and Uzbek Sunnls, and the instances given in the sources represent so many stages in an ideal evolution towards a steadily decreasing differentiation of the religious substance of things.

change of letters between the 'ulama of Mashhad and certain Uzbek
'ulama dating from 997/15 88-9,1 and another dating from the first half of the 17th century between the Ottoman mufti Asad Efendl and his
Persian colleagues2 — we can establish a few of their fundamental theses. The views of the Shi'Is arestill characterised by the condemnation of the first three Caliphs, which, however, in the letter from the 'ulama of Mashhad is already considered as the affirmation, not ofa religious, but of a political principle anddefinitely distinguished from the canonical execration, which is described as an "act worthy of ignorant Shi'Is". Thedispute is restricted to the sphere of the public activity of the three Caliphs, to whom 'A'isha is naturally added, and the wrong done to 'All is notregarded asimplying a religious fault in a general sense; it is treated merely as a juridical offence of such a kind that theguilty parties can still beheld to bemembers of the umma.As regards the other side, in addition to the charge concerning the execration, which as we have seen drew a defensive reaction, only inthe Ottoman letter is there a detailed list of charges, which are directed, however, against the Persian Qizilbash rather than against Shi'Is in general; controversy thus hinges on the wearing of moustaches and beards, the improper use of green clothing, the drinking of wine, sexual promiscuity andthelike. Despite the possibility that such matters might be evidence of heretical tendencies, they are recalled in an argument more reminiscent of a legal dispute than a theological confutation and they are treated onthe same plane as, or rather as supporting evidence for,the political and religious claims to priority, in relation to 'All, of Abu Bakr as the first convert, 'Umar as champion of the faith and 'Uthman as editor of the Qur'an. The more definite accusations belong to thecategory of political controversies directly involving the Safavid sovereigns. Conversely, on the Sunni side stress was officially laid on the category of the "pure Imam" and,while in the letter to Tahmasp there may still be some doubt concerning their identity, the subsequent Uzbek controversy shows that the path followed by the Sunnis was that of the Salafs and theTwelve Imams, both the former and the latter being guarantors of the true Sunna and of the.jam?a. The Twelve Imams have always hada place in Sunni devotional attitudes, especially during the pre- and proto-Safavid periods (the case of KhunjI may be cited as an example), but after the turbulent interven

tion of the Qizilbash the Safavids must have seemed to the Sunnls to be "asses of the Imams", just as the Christians were called "asses of Christ", namely bearers overshadowed by a sacred burden. At this stage, once political fanaticism had begun to subside, a contact between the two branches of Islam seemed to become feasible, subject to the proviso that there was full acknowledgment of the existence of single points of acceptable difference, whereas the more mature and original fruits of Persian-Shl'I Safavid thought could be culled only within the narrow confines of the abstruse domain of abstract philosophical speculation, which on the one hand was ignored by official Sunnism and on the other was viewed with deep distrust by official Shi'ism. In the more strictly ecclesiastical Shl'i camp, the lack of any definitely religious substance in these controversies was counterbalanced by the great flowering of religious-juridical codification which, though not insensible in its turn to strictly political demands, is of greater interest from the ideological point of view. In its general outlines the ideological complexity of Twelver Shi'ism at this stage, when it was adapting itself to its function as state religion, can be clearly discerned in the antithesis between the Usulls and the Akhbaris, who during the Safavid era (after the compilation of the Faiva'id al-madaniyya by Mulla Amln AstarabadI, who died in 1026/1617) assumed the character of well-defined currents within the body of the "Imamite school". The ethico-political foundation on which these two movements were based seems to have been formulated in terms offering a simplistic view of 15th-century problems. In Iran the Usulls represented the aristocratic element, which since the reign of Isma'Il had reaffirmed its function as an indispensable link in the relationship between the sovereign and his subjects, as a result of the privileges granted on the basis of the well-known and uninterrupted tradition dating from the days of Tlmur, and of its specific administrative functions. This was now enhanced by the corporate outlook of a youthful clergy whose spokesmen were drawn from the aristocracy, within which — as the sovereign's faithful ally — they became characterised as the instrument best suited to prevent any effective change in the balance of forces. When considering this dichotomy — which should not be viewed as a clear-cut religious contrast — it would definitely be going too far to attribute to the Akhbaris the significance of symbolising a constant desire for reforms and progress; but within the Akhbari movement, providing a proof of its greater vitality (in the purely

religious sense) and ofa certain availability which was at least consistent with the principles ofa Shl'I society, there later arose the shaikhl school, which in Iran was the only adequate testing-ground fornew experiments that served toregenerate the normal Imamic conceptions when the Safavid era ended. The contrast is thus farmore important than the struggle, bd^ari even if it was notpure folklore, between factions such as the Haidariyya and the Ni'matiyya. The disappointing and too fragmentary realisation of the promises implicit in the Akhbarl principles is certainly outside the scope of this study. Nor can we speak of a genuine Usull religious feeling, though it ispermissible totalkof Usull and Akhbarl methods, which were divergent trends operatingin the sphere of Majlisian Shl'I society. Let us refrain from essaying a complete definition, but as one example of disagreement we can mention the interpretation of the ta'wil, which was obviously the mainspring of any Shl'I system. For the Usull the Surma, through its interpretation entrusted to thereasoning ('aq/) of the mujtahid, was themeans of making effective {^ahir)theteachings of the Qur'an. The ta'wil was therefore entrusted toa special body which, necessarily provided with particular instruments, had the power to render practically equal to the text {naqt)that which would otherwise have been only tafslr, or, in legal terminology, ijtihador %ann. And it isprecisely inits elaboration of the theory of zann that the originality and fascination ofthis school lie. The "cogency ofconjecture" was a regrettable practical necessity, generating what was nothing better than acredo quia incertum and, in the administrative economy ofthe Safavid confessional State, an emphatic proclamation of a kind of solve et repete principle having acosmic value, which required the acceptance in all cases of the decisions of the temporal authority, with the reservation that the real values — should they have been violated — would be re-established inthe life tocome. In this way the Usulls cutthemselves offfrom any prerogative of renewal, leaving the Imam with the sole function — which necessarily was never verifiable in space or time - of acting asthe basis of their activity. They abandoned the pursuit of the ideals of perfect justice, realisable only through the Law which it was the Imam's task to convey tothis world, and resigned themselves tothe only realistic way of making the law consistent with changing circumstances, in an almost existential manner. From the religious point ofview, reality was confined to direct and everyday experience of the Sharfa, whilethe Reality of Imamic dimensions was merely the logical instrument that
651



RELIGION
made it possible to define this pure actuality. That Reality belonged to the plane of myths and not to that of metaphysics. A logical consequence of this was that no further revelation could be expected: the Imam was no longer considered as having the revolutionary potential of a Mahdl and his place was taken by a clergy well aware of the change that had been made to their own advantage. The Imam was no longer expected to arrive, because he was already there, living in the psyche and the dreams of the faithful. And these dreams were no longer a prerogative of saints and seers, but, by a kind of inflationary process, were from now on extended to all believers.
Ideologically the Akhbarls were in a more classic situation, not because of any reversal of values vis-a-vis the Usiills, but merely because, unlike their opponents, they had retained certain options; recourse to the akhbdr in an individualistic form, and ignoring the authority of the ijtihad, on the one hand prevented the constitution of any element that might become a substitute for the Imam, who remained active and indispensable; and on the other hand it also prevented the formation of a new naql as a zahir of the Imamic Sunna, which was considered the only way of interpreting the prophetic message. The Sunna was thus the Qur'anic ta'wll, and the tafslr drawn from it did not exclude the possibility that the authentic interpretation of the Sunna in question should be the will of the Imam destined one day to change the Shari'a as hitherto applied.
In a religious social conscience this still left room for the expectation of the Mahdl and his teaching and presupposed the possibility of a transformation of society starting from the top. Such a position (which was by no means unusual in the ShI'I outlook, whose extreme manifestations extended in fact far beyond it in originality) now represented the only vital alternative to the rigorism introduced by the Safavids. All this is elucidated by the transformation which the theology of MajlisI brought about in Persian religious life, changing it into a cult and a spirit that were essentially nationalistic. MajlisI returned to the Sunna of the Imam and, without introducing any innovations in terms of its content, restored to the Safavid Shl'a the text of the various akhbar. The philological demand for new large "editions" of the material constituting the Sunna was one of the characteristics of this period, from which, in fact, date the new compilations of hadith, the most important of these being Majlisl's Bihar al-amvdr. The new element that made its official appearance with MajlisI and was divulged in innumer

THE HEYDAY OF THE SAFAVID ERA
able works of a popular type was the codification of what has been called the coexistence ofthe Imam and his followers. It isnot the new miracles performed by the Imam that make it possible toperceive the transition (which was infact reciprocal) between legend and theology, but the context within which these miracles, whether old ornew, take place. A striking example is the hagiography of the Imam 'All al-Rida,1 virtually identical with that of Ibn Babiiya (4th/ioth century). The miracles are foretold byluminous visions, bymiraculous dreams and magic voices; generally they occur during a pilgrimage to the Imam, who speaks to his disciples "as if in a dream" and reveals unknown readings of the Qur'an. Often thevows fulfilled by theImam have detrimental consequences for the typical enemies of Persia atthat time, the Uzbeks or thenotables who thwarted thepietistic activities of good Persians and were probably Sunnls. At the same time stress is laid on thesanctity of purely temporal requests from individuals and of demands for the granting of all kinds of privileges to the district of Mashhad, where the sanctuary of the Imam was situated and which was also a Shl'I bulwark against theUzbeks and Turkmens. The Imam, theoretically deprived ofhis function asa future effective head of the State, becomes the devout companion and the benevolent intercessor in everyday matters. This occurs as the result of a long series of visions, dreams and auspices which are not in any way mystical and represent the Iranian canonisation of everything that in Islam had remained outside orthodoxy (averse to anything that might detract from its pure monotheism), and confined within the barely tolerated sphere of religious sentimentalism manifesting itself in forms of ritual and a particular need of myths.
That is why the Shl'I religion now takes on a nationalist hue based on figures such as the Eighth Imam, who represented the most perfect expression of Persian Shi'ism, with his typical characteristics, i.e. a conscious victim ofhis own sacrifice and a prophet ofthe greatness of Iran, destined to accept his mashhad. As a counterpoint to the fundamental theme of the Insan al-kdmil, which in the theology of MajlisI was recognised in the Iranicised version of the 'All al-Rida "type", pilgrimages to thetombs of the Imam and of the innumerable Imam-^adas, which had always been regarded as meritorious acts of devotion,

acquired growing canonical status. Theoretically they were even placed
on the same level as the hajj,1 and to the popular mind they were perhaps more important than this, owing to a series of traditional and pietistic values which found expression in the accomplishment of the ziyara, especially to Mashhad, which in the meantime had become one of the recognised centres of Twelver Shi'ism. The Shl'a still continued to revolve around the Iraqi axis of Najaf and Karbala, but this infiltration of popular elements led to a veritable Iranicisation of the holy places, carried to such lengths that Imamism, at all events in its external manifestations, became a Persian religion, creating a homogeneous tradition destined to find its fulfilment in modern times. The compactness of the present Twelver world has sometimes led to misconceptions regarding the nature of the ShT'a in pre-Safavid times, because habits of thought and religious mechanisms have been attributed to it which as a matter of fact were present in the Shl'a only during the Safavid period of its development. The skill displayed by those who held the reins of power in creating national cohesion around the Shl'a, which the people of Persia embraced after a slow transition, prevented any anti-Shl'I reaction at the time of the Afghan occupation. Such a reaction might well have offered Iran a SunnI alternative founded on a system capable of solving the country's economic difficulties by doing away with the privileges of the ruling class; but the brutality of the Afghans, who were virtually isolated during their campaign and reduced to trying to solve problems with which they were incapable of dealing, merely served to strengthen the bonds between the Shl'a and Iran, thereby achieving the aim to which Isma'Il had sacrificed his religious ambitions. The Dasht-i Mughan farman of Nadir Shah in 17362 was a recognition of this state of affairs. Like all the sovereigns of Iran he appealed to the local aristocracy to consider his act as one more step towards the recognition of the place of Iran within the framework of the Islamic world. The mujtahid at that time, 'All Akbar Mulla-bashI, was officially the sovereign's adviser, and the execution of the edict was entrusted to an official who belonged to the great Safavid tradition, the wicc-sadr Muhammad 'All. The suggestion that there should be an ideal return to the period before the days of Isma'Il, who had been responsible for the introduction of certain deplorable innovations (meaning thereby the

execration of the first three Caliphs, subsequently abolished), was practically equivalent tothe acceptance ofTwelver Shi'ism with its juridical institutions, so that the mention ofthe mujtahid does not have the religious implications one would expect, just as to renounce the execration ofthe three Caliphs isnot, for a Shl'I, an indicator of theological aberration. The consequences of this edict are confined in practice to the final disappearance of the concept of jihad within the Muslim world, now divided no longer into firaq butinto juridical schools, the fifth of which — theso-called Ja'fari school — is represented by the Twelver Shl'a, inparticular by Twelver Usulism. This led in Iran to aneven greater isolation between actual religious life, entrusted to popular piety, and the task ofthe class destined toenforce the Shari'a, albeit according tothe Ja'fari system. Apositive result ofthis dualism - somewhat unusual from the Islamic point ofview - was the adoption of a purely technical conception of whatever is the object of speculation in the sacred texts. The true Shi'I ability to see problems through the prism ofa highly developed juridical system without any interference ofa religious-humanistic kind later contributed toa more ready acceptance — in comparison with other Muslim countries — of modernistic solutions tothe various political and social problems.

CHAPTER I 3
SPIRITUAL MOVEMENTS, PHILOSOPHY
AND THEOLOGY IN THE SAFAVID
PERIOD
THE BACKGROUND
The Safavid period is one of the outstanding epochs in the intellectual and spiritual history of Islamic Iran, although its artistic and political life is much better known to theoutside world than what it created in the domains of sufism, philosophy and theology. Particularly in Hikmat - that combination of philosophy andgnosis which should be translated astheosophy rather than philosophy ascurrently understood in the Occident - the Safavid period is the apogee of a long development which reaches back to the6th/12th century and the introduction of new intellectual perspectives into Islamic civilisation by Suhravardi and Ibn 'Arabl. Likewise, in sufism and the religious sciences the sudden flowering of activity in the ioth/i6th century is based on the important but little studied transformation that was taking place in Persia since theMongol invasion. Persia did not become Shf I through a sudden process. Ever since the 7th/1 }th century Shi'ism was spreading in Persia through certain of the sufl orders which were outwardly SunnI — that is,in their madhhab they followed one of the SunnI schools, usually the Shafi'I. But they were particularly devoted to 'All and some even accepted wilaya (or valayat, in its Persian pronunciation), that is, the power of spiritual direction and initiation which Shl'Is believe was bestowed upon 'All by the Prophet of Islam. It was particularly this belief that made the transformation of Persia from a predominantly SunnI land to a Shl'I one possible. The Shl'Is consider SafI al-Dln Ardablll, the founder of the Safavid order, asa Shl'I, whereas theresearch of modern historians has revealed him to be a SunnI. The same holds true of Shah Ni'mat-Allah Vail, thefounder of the Ni'matallahl order, which is the most widespread sufl order in contemporary Persia. In a sense both contentions are true depending on what we mean by Shi'ism. Ifwe mean the Shafi'I school or madhhab, then these sufl orders such as the
656



THE BACKGROUND
Safavl and Ni'matallahl were initially Sunni and later became Shl'I. If, however, by Shi'ism we mean the acceptance of the valayat of 'AH, then in this sense these orders were inwardly Shl'I during this period and became also outwardly so during the Safavid era. In any case the role of sufism in the spread of Shi'ism and the preparation of the ground for the establishment of a Shl'I Persia with the Safavids remains basic both in the direct and active political role played by the Safavl order and in the religious and spiritual role of other orders such as the Kubraviyya and especially the Niirbakhshiyya, which more than any other order sought to bridge the gap between
Sunnism and Shi'ism.1 Shaikh Muhammad Ibn 'Abd-Allah, entitled Nurbakhsh, who died in Ray in 869/1464—5, made indirect claims to being the Mahdl and sought to bring Shi'ism and Sunnism closer together through sufism. His successors Faizbakhsh and Shah Baha' al-Din continued the movement in the same direction and finally became fully Shl'I. A celebrated member of this order, Shaikh Shams al-Din Muhammad Lahljl, the author of the best-known commentary upon the Gulsban-i rd%, a work which is a bible of sufism in Persian, was thoroughly Shl'I while being an outstanding sufl. The story of his encounter with Shah Isma'Il and the question posed to him by the shah as to why he always wore black, to which he replied that he was always
mourning the tragic events of Karbala, is well known.2 And it indicates the complete transformation that had taken place within the Niirbakhshl order so that it became totally Shl'I in form. We observe the same process within the Ni'matallahi and Safavl orders. Both Shah Ni'mat-Allah, who came to Persia from Aleppo, and Shaikh SafI al-Din from Ardabll were at first suf Is of Sunni background such as the Shaziliyya and Qadiriyya brotherhoods. But the inner belief in the valayat of 'All gradually transformed the outer form of the orders as well into thoroughly Shl'I organisations, although the inward structure of these orders, being sufl, remained above the Shl'I — Sunni distinctions. The Ni'matallahi order became Shl'I during the Safavid period itself, while the Safavl order began to show Shl'I tendencies with Junaid, who was attracted to the Musha'sha' movement, and became fully Shl'I with 'All b. Junaid. In all these cases, however, a similar process was occurring. Sufl orders with Shl'I tendencies were

SPIRITUALITY, PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY
inwardly transforming Persia from a predominantly Sunni to a predominantly Shl'I land. Therefore, sufism is the most important spiritual force to be reckoned with in studying thebackground of the Safavid period. As for the intellectual background ofthe Safavid era, there also the theoretical and doctrinal aspect of sufism, known as gnosis ('irfan), plays a fundamental role along with schools ofphilosophy and theology. The very rich intellectual life of the ioth/i6th and nth/17th centuries did not come into being from a vacuum. There was a long period of preparation from the time of Suhravardi and Ibn 'ArabI to the advent ofthe Safavid renaissance, a period which, although spanning nearly four centuries, remains the most obscure in the intellectual history of Persia. Yet without a knowledge of this period an understanding ofSafavid intellectual life is impossible. There are four major intellectual perspectives and schools of thought, all clearly defined in traditional Islamic learning, which gradually approach each other during theperiod leading to the Safavid revival: Peripatetic {mashsha'i) philosophy, illuminationist (ishrdqT) theosophy, gnosis ('irfdn)and theology (kaldtri). It is due to the gradual intermingling and synthesis of these schools that during the Safavid period the major intellectual figures are not only philosophers but also theologians or gnostics. The very appearance of the vast syntheses such as those ofSadr al-Din ShIrazI attest to the long period preceding the Safavid renaissance which made these all-comprehending metaphysical expositions possible. The usual story of Islamic philosophy, according to which it was attacked byGhazali and after an Indian summer in Andalusia disappeared from Muslim lands, isdisproven by the presence of the Safavid philosophers and metaphysicians themselves. The fact that they were able to expound philosophical and metaphysical doctrines and ideas matching in rigour and depth anything written before or after in traditional philosophy is itself proof of the continuity of Islamic philosophy
after the attacks of Ghazali and Fakhr al-Din Razl.1 Actually, in the 7th/13th century the mathematician and theologian, Naslr al-Din TusI, who was also one of the foremost of Islamic philosophers, revived the Peripatetic philosophy of Ibn Slna, which had been attacked by both of the above-mentioned theologians, through his philosophical master

THE BACKGROUND
piece the Sharb al-ishdrdt, which is a reply to Razl's criticism of Ibn Slna's last philosophical testament, the Ishdrat wa'l-tanbibdt. Henceforth, Persia continued to produce philosophers who followed upon Tusl's footsteps. His own students, Qutb al-DIn ShlrazI, author of the monumental philosophical opus Durrat al-tdj in Persian, and Dablran KatibI, author of the Hikmat al-'ain, continued the tradition immediately after him. In the 8th/14th and 9th/15 th centuries Qutb al-Din RazI and a whole group of philosophers who hailed from Shlraz and the surrounding regions also wrote important philosophical works. Among them Sadr al-Din DashtakI and his son Ghiyas al-DIn Mansur DashtakI are particularly noteworthy. The latter, the author of Akhlaq-i Mansurtin ethics, a commentary upon the Haydkil al-nur of Suhravardi and glosses upon Tusl's commentary upon the Ishdrat, lived into the Safavid period and was very influential upon the major Safavid figures such as Sadr al-Din ShlrazI, for whom he has been mistaken by many traditional scholars as well as by some modern historians. Many of the cardinal themes of Safavid philosophy and metaphysics may be found in the writings of Ghiyas al-DIn Mansur and other figures of the period, not one of whom has by any means been studied sufficiently.
Even these philosophers, who were mostly Peripatetic, were influenced by the ishraql theosophy of Suhravardi, especially in such questions as God's knowledge of things. After the founding of this new intellectual perspective by Suhravardi in the 6th/12th century, its teachings spread particularly in Persia and became more and more integrated with Avicennan philosophy as seen in the case of Ghiyas al-Din Mansur and similar figures from the 7th/13th to the ioth/i6th century. And this ishraql interpretation of Avicennan philosophy is one of the characteristics of the intellectual life of the Safavid period, as seen to an eminent degree in the case of the founder of the school of Isfahan, Mir Damad.
There is also the basic question of gnosis to consider. The teachings of the founder of the doctrinal formulation of gnosis in Islam, Muhyl al-Din Ibn 'ArabI, spread throughout Persia rapidly, especially through the works and direct instruction of his pupil, Sadr al-Din Qunyavl. Henceforth nearly all the masters of sufism in Persia, such as 'Abd al-Razzaq KashanI, Ibn 'Arabi's eminent commentator, Sa'd al-Din Hamuya, 'Aziz al-Din NasafI and such famous poets as Fakhr al-Din 'AraqI, Auhad al-Din KirmanI and 'Abd al-Rahman JamI, were deeply influenced by the gnostic teachings of Ibn 'ArabI. JamI in fact wrote
659



SPIRITUALITY, PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY
several commentaries upon Ibn'Arabl's works as well as composing on the themes of gnosis independent treatises such asthe hava'ih and Ash^at al-lama'at.
Certain philosophers and theosophers began toincorporate this form of teaching into their schools. Ibn Turka of Isfahan, the 8th/14th century author of Tamhid al-qawSid, was perhaps the first person who sought to combine fa/safa and 'irfdn, philosophy and gnosis. In the following centuries this tendency was accelerated in the hands of a few Shl'I gnostics and sages such as Sayyid Haidar Amull, author of Jam? al-asrdr, which is so deeply influential in Safavid writings, Ibn Abl Jumhvir, the author oiKitab al-mujli, which is again a doctrinal work ofShfl gnosis, and Rajab BursI, known especially for his Mashariqal-anwar. The importance of the work of these figures for the Safavid period can hardly be over-emphasised, because itis they who integrated the sapiental doctrines of Ibn 'Arab!into Shi'ism and prepared the ground within Shl'I intellectual life for those Safavid figures who achieved the synthesis between philosophy, theology and gnosis within the cadre ofTwelver Shi'ism. As for theology or Kalam, in its Shl'I form it reached itspeak in a certain sense with the Tajrid of Naslr al-Dln Tusl. During the centuries preceding the Safavid period avery large number ofcommentaries and glosses were written upon it by Shl'I theologians while the SunnI theologians of Persia such as TaftazanI andDavanI - at least in his early period - continued to develop the Ash'arl Kalam, whichhad reached itspeak with Fakhr al-Dln Razl. In fact, this outspoken theological opponent ofthe philosophers was also influential in many ways among Shl'I theologians and thinkers. In this domain also gradually philosophy and theology began to approach each other. It is difficult to assert whether a particular work of Sayyid Sharif JurjanI or Jalal al-Dln DavanI is more Kalam or Falsafa. Moreover, certain glosses and commentaries upon the Tajrid such as those ofFakhrl and especially ofSammakI, who influenced Mir Damad, contain many ofthe themes that belong properly speaking to Hikmat andFalsafa andwere adopted by the Safavid philosophers. The long series of commentaries upon the Tajrid,which has not been studied at allfully, is the source of many ofthe important elementsof Safavid philosophy. From this vast intellectual background there gradually emergedthe tendency towards a synthesis of the different schools of Islamic thought within the background and matrix of Shi'ism, which because

THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING
of its inner structure was more conducive to the growth ofthe traditional philosophy and theosophy which reached its full development in the ioth/i6th and nth/ 17th centuries. The advent ofthe Safavids, which resulted in Persia's becoming predominantly Shl'I, along with temporal conditions such as peace and stability and the encouragement of the religious sciences, which in Shi'ism always include the intellectual sciences (al-'ulumal- aqliyya), aided inbringing nearly four centuries of intellectual development to fruition. And so with suchfiguresas Mir Damad and Sadr al-Dln ShlrazI, usually known as Mulla Sadra, an intellectual edifice which has its basis inthe teachings ofIbn Slna, SuhravardI and Ibn 'ArabI and also upon the specific tenets ofShi'ism as found in the Qur'an and the traditions of the Prophet and Imams reached its completion. Asynthesis is created which reflects amillennium of Islamic intellectual life.
THE REVIVAL OF RELIGIOUS LEARNING IN THE SAFAVID
PERIOD
For both religious and political reasons the Safavids sought from the very beginning of Shah Isma'Il's reign to foster the study of Shi'ism and toencourage the migration of Shl'I scholars from other lands to Persia. Of scholars of non-Persian origin most were Arabs either of the Jabal 'Amila region in today's Lebanon and Syria or of the Bahrain, which included in the terminology of that day not only the islandof Bahrain but the whole coastal region around it. There were somany Shl'I scholars from these two regions, which had been strongholds of Shl'I learning, that the two biographical works, Lu'lu' al-Bahrain by Yusuf b. Ahmad al-Bahranl and Amal al-'amilfi 'ulama Jabal 'Amil by Muhammad b. Hasan al-Hurr al-'Amill, are devoted tothe account of the scholars ofBahrain and Jabal 'Amila. Such men as Shaikh 'Allb. 'Abd al-'AlI KarkI, Shaikh Baha' al-Dln 'Amill, his father Shaikh Husain, a disciple of Shahld-i sanl, and Ni'mat-Allah Jaza'irl, all of Arab extraction, were some ofthe most famous ofa large number of Shl'I scholars and theologians who were responsible for the major renaissance ofShl'I religious learning during the Safavid period.
It has often been said, even by such authorities asBrowne and Qazvlnl, that the very emphasis upon religious and theological learning during the Safavid period stifled science and literature and even sufism. This isonly ahalf-truth which overlooks previous conditions
661



SPIRITUALITY, PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY
and what was actually happening in these fields. The emphasis upon the study of the Sharfa and theology, while helping to unify Shl'I Persia, did not stifle activity in other domains until the second half of the i ith/iyth century, when a reaction against sufism set in. As faras literature is concerned, it is true that this period didnot produce another Hafiz orSa'dl, but such poets as Sa'ib Tabriz!, Kalim Kashani and Shaikh-i Bahai (Baha' al-Dln 'Amill) cannot be brushed asideas insignificant. Moreover, there are two types ofpoetry which reach a new mode ofperfection at this time: the poetry dealing with the life, sufferings and virtues of the Shl'I Imams, which isparticularly associated with the name ofMuhtasham Kashani, and poems in which the doctrinal teachings of sufism or gnosis, as well as theosophy, are setto Persian verse. Inthis latter case the Safavid period witnesses the interesting fact that most ofits great philosophers and gnostics were also poets, some of commendable quality. As for science, adecline had already set in in Islamic science with the Saljuqs, after which the mathematical sciences were revived by Nasir al-Dln TusI and his school atMaragha. The early Safavid period continued this tradition ofmathematics and astronomy, whose centreof study inthe ioth/i6th century was Herat. Only inthe following century did the study ofmathematics begin todecline in the madfasas. As for medicine and pharmacology, this period, far from being one of decline, produced outstanding figures like Baha' al-Daula to the extent
that some have called itthe golden age of pharmacology.1 The case of sufism is somewhat different and more complex. During the early Safavid period sufism flourished spiritually and even politically, until, due to the danger of a Qizilbash uprising and a certain mundaneness which had penetrated into some sufl orders possessing worldly powers, a religious and theological reaction set in against sufism as seen in the figure of the second Majlisl. But many of the earlier religious scholars andtheologians like the first Majlisl and Shaikh-i Baha'I were either sufls orsympathetic toward sufism. Moreover, it was because and not in spite of the spread of Shl'I religious learning that the type of metaphysical and theosophical doctrine associated with Mir Damad and Mulla Sadra became current. Such forms of thought would have been inconceivable without the Shl'I climate established by the Safavids. Even if the Shl'I 'ulama opposed the

SUFISM
mutasawwifa in late Safavid times, 'irfan or gnosis continued to be taught and studied within the traditional Shi'I madrasa system itself, inwhich milieu it survives to this day in Persia. Those who know most in Persia even today about Islamic philosophy and even the "theology of Aristotle", orinother words Plotinus, wear the turban and belong to the class of religious scholars; they are not"free thinkers" whoare hakims in spite of being Shi'I divines. The establishment ofcentresof religious learning by the Safavids and the emphasis placed upon Sharl'I and theological learning undoubtedly diverted much ofthe energyof the intelligentsia to these fields and indirectly diminished activity in other fields. Not only did it not destroy the intellectual sciences, however, but itwas an essential factor in making possible the appearance of the vast metaphysical syntheses for which the Safavid period is known.
SUFISM IN THE SAFAVID PERIOD
The major sufl orders of the 9th/15 th century such as the NurbakhshI, Ni'matallahl and Qadirl, notto speak of the Safaviyya themselves, continued into theSafavid period and flourished into the nth/17th century. Naturally most ofthese orders acquired a purely Shi'I colour and centred most of all around the Eighth Shi'I Imam, 'AH al-Rida, who is the "Imam of initiation" in Shi'ism and to whom most sufl orders in the Shi'I and SunnI world are attached through Ma'ruf al-Karkhl. Many eminent sufl masters ofthe ioth/i6th century in fact lived at or near Mashhad, as we see in the case of Muhammad al-Juniishanl, 'Imad al-Dln Fazl-Allah MashhadI andKamal al-Dln Khwarazml, all spiritual descendants of 'AH Hamadanl. All these
masters expressed a special devotion to Imam Rida.1 Likewise the masters of the Ni'matallahl order, such assome ofthe actual descendants of Shah Ni'mat-Allah from whom most of the present-day orders in Persia derive, were thoroughly Shi'I, although here the order was attached most ofall to'AH himself. A sufl order which to this day considers itself as the purest Shi'I sufl order, the ZahabI, was also active during the early Safavid period. The Zahabis, like most other Shi'I sufl orders, believe that even before the advent of the Safavids the basic chains {silsila) of suf Is were Shi'I but hid their Shi'ism through the process of concealment {taqiyyd). The Zahabis

663



SPIRITUALITY, PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY
claim that only with the advent of the Safavids did the necessity for taqiyya subside so that the orders were able to declare themselves openly Shl'I in Persia. Among all the orders the Zahabls consider themselves as being the most intensely Shl'I; and being especially devoted to Imam Rida they add the title ra^aviyya tothe name oftheir silsila. An outstanding example of a sufl work belonging to the Safavid period and typical ofa Shl'I sufl order inits new setting is the Tuhfat al- abbdsiyya of the ZahabI master, Muhammad 'AH Sabzavarl, a contemporary ofShah 'Abbas II and, interestingly enough, the mu'adhdbin (he who calls the prayers) of the mausoleum of Imam Rida at Mashhad. The work consists of an introduction, five chapters, twelve sections and aconclusion. The titles of the chapters and sections are as follows: Chapter I - On the meaning oftasavvuf and stiff, why there are few sufls, why they are called so and thesigns and characteristics pertaining tothem. Chapter II- On the beliefs of sufls inunity (taubid). Chapter III —Onthebeliefs of sufls in prophecy (nubuvvat) and imamate (imamat).
Chapter IV — On the beliefs of sufls concerning eschatology (ma'ad). Chapter V— On the dependence ofthe sufls upon the Shl'I Imams. Section I — On the virtue ofknowledge. Section II — On continence and asceticism. Section III — On silence. Section IV — On hunger and wakefulness. Section V— On self-seclusion. Section VI — On invocation. Section VII — On reliance upon God. Section VIII — On contentment and surrender. Section IX - On worshipping for forty days. Section X - Onhearing pleasing music and on that all pleasant music isnot the singing that isscorned inthe Shari'a. Section XI — On ecstasy and swoon. Section XII — On the necessity ofhaving a spiritual master, and the regulations pertaining tothe master and the disciple. Conclusion — On the sayings ofthe sufls concerning different subjects. An examination ofthe contents ofthis work reveals that it deals very much with the same subjects asone finds in the classical treatisesof sufism such as the Kitab al-luma', Kisdla qushairiyya andIhya' 'uliim

SUFISM
al-din. The only difference that can be discerned is in its relating the chain of sufism to the Shl'I Imams and in its relying not only upon the Qur'an but also upon Prophetic Hadtth and traditions of the Imams drawn from Shl'I sources, whereas sufi works within the Sunni world are based upon the Qur'an and Prophetic Hadlth mostly of the sihdb literature. As for the role of the Imams, this is a major point that distinguishes sufism in its Shl'I and Sunni settings. In the chain of nearly all the orders that are widely spread in the Sunni world such as the Shaziliyya and Qadiriyya the Shl'I Imams up to Imam Rida appear as saints and spiritual poles (qutb), but not as Imams as this term is understood specifically in Shi'ism. In Shl'I sufi orders the presence of the same figures is seen as proof of the reliance of sufism upon the Imams, as the fifth chapter of the Tuhfat al- abbdsiyya demonstrates in a typical manner. Besides the type of Sufism represented by the ZahabI and other regular orders during the Safavid period, there are two other kinds of Islamic esotericism to consider: the first is the case of those like Mir Abu'l-Qasim FindiriskI and Baha' al-Dln 'Amill who were definitely sufls and are recognised as such by the sufi orders, but whose initiatic chain and spiritual master are not known; the second is the case of gnostics like Sadr al-Dln ShlrazI who definitely possessed esoteric knowledge usually in the form of Hikmat — which also implies means of attaining this knowledge — but who did not belong, at least outwardly, to any sufi orders, so that the means whereby they acquired this gnostic knowledge remains problematic. Mulla Sadra, while being a thorough gnostic like Ibn 'ArabI, wrote his Kasral-asndm al-jdhiliyya against those in his times who pretended to belong to sufism and whom he calls mutasavvif, using this term in the particular context of his time and not as it has been employed throughout the history of sufism. In fact, what we observe during the Safavid period is that as the sufi orders become more popular and acquire in certain cases a worldly character, a reaction sets in against them from the quarter of the religious scholars. Henceforth within the class of the 'ulama it is no longer socially acceptable to belong openly to one of the well known sufi orders so that esoteric instruction is imparted without any outwardly declared sufi organisation. Moreover, the term 'irfan, or
gnosis,1 is employed with respect in place of tasavvuf, which from the

That is why, while Baha' al-Dln 'Amill practised sufism openly, Qazi Sa'Id QumI, whom a contemporary authority has called the Ibn 'Arab! ofShi'ism, refers constantlyto 'irfan, butnever claims to bea sufl in theusual sense that is found within the turuq, although without doubt hewas a sufl. Tothis whole situation must beadded the initiatic role of the Twelfth Imam for the elite of Shi'ism in general, and the fact that the whole structure of Shi'ism possesses amore esoteric character than we find inthe exoteric side ofSunnism. This fact made it possible foresoteric ideas to appear even in certain exoteric aspects of Shi'ism. As aresult, the Safavid period presents uswith not only the regular sufl masters ofthe well known orders, but also with gnostics and sufls of the highest spiritual rank whose initiatic affiliation is difficult to discern. Moreover, thegnostic dimension of Islam penetrates at this time into philosophy and theosophy or Hikmat, andmost of the important figures ofthis eraare thinkers with thehighest powers of ratiocination andwith respect forlogic while at thesame time seers with spiritual visions and illuminations. Itishardly possible toseparate philosophy, theosophy and gnosis completely in this period.
OUTSTANDING INTELLECTUAL AND SPIRITUAL FIGURES OF THE SAFAVID PERIOD
ShaikhBaha' al-Din 'Amili
From thepoint ofview ofversatility, Baha' al-Dln 'Amill, known to the Persians asShaikh-i Baha'I (the name isquite unconnected with the heterodox Baha'I sect which finally broke away from Islam), is the most remarkable figure ofthe Safavid renaissance. Born in Ba'labakk in present-day Lebanon in953/1546, theson ofthe leader ofthe Shl'I community ofthat region, Shaikh Baha' al-Dln was brought toPersia by hisfather at theageof thirteen and soon mastered the Persian language tosuch an extent that he isusually considered the best Persian poet ofthe ioth/i6th century. Hestudied inQazvln, then a centreof Shi'I learning, and in Herat, where he mastered mathematics. His most famous teachers were his own father, 'Izzal-Dln Husain b. 'Abd al-Samad, and Maulana 'Abd-Allah Yazdl, the author of the celebrated glosses upon the Tahdhib in logic, which is studied to this day in

Persian madrasas under the title of Hdshiyya-jiMulld 'A.bd-A.lldh. He also studied medicine with Hakim 'Imad al-Dln Mahmiid. After a period of travelling in Persia and pilgrimages to Mecca, Shaikh-i Baha'I settled in Isfahan, where he gained the title ofShaikh al-Islam and where, during the reign of Shah 'Abbas, he became the most powerful Shi'I figure in Persia. He died in 1030/1621 and is buried in Mashhad near the tomb of Imam Rida. His beautiful mausoleum is visited by thousands of pilgrims to this day.
The many-sided genius of Shaikh-i Baha'I is best illustrated by the diversity of his works, nearly all of which have become authoritative in their own domain. These works include: in the field of Qur'an and Hadlth, A.rba'un badithan, a collection of forty prophetic traditions with commentary, glosses upon the Tafstr oi Baidawi, Hall al-huriifal-Qur'an on the opening letters of some of the chapters of the Qur'an, 'Urwat al-wuthqd, a commentary upon the Qur'an, and Wajt^a, also known as Dirdyatal-hadtth^ on the science of Hadlth; in the field of jurisprudence (fiqh), theology, and specifically Shi'I studies, ithnSashartyjatin five parts on the Muslim religious rites, Jdmi'-i 'abbdsi, the most famous Persian work on Shl'I fiqh, Hablal-matin on the injunctions (ahkatri) of religion, Hadd'iqal-sdlihin, acommentary on the Sahtfa sajjddiyja of the Fourth Shi'I Imam, Miftdh al-faldh on daily litanies and prayers, and a treatise on the necessity to perform the daily prayers (saldt);in the sciences of language, Asrdr al-baldgha on rhetoric, Tabdhib al-baydn on Arabic grammar and Fawd'id al-samadtyya, an advanced work on Arabic grammar still very much in use in Persia today; dozens of works on various branches of mathematics such as Tashrih al-afldk on astronomy, Khuldsat al-hisdb, the most famous Muslim mathematical treatise of the last
few centuries, and glosses onChaghmlnl's astronomical treatise;1 several treatises on the occult sciences now lost; and many works on sufism of which the most famous is the Kashkul ("The begging bowl"), which as the title indicates contains, like the begging bowl ofthe dervishes into which bits of food were thrown, selections from masterpieces of sufl literature. His poems also, such as the masnavis Tiiti-ndma,Nan va halvd and Shir va shikar, which are written in the style of Jalal al-DIn Ruml's Masnavi,all deal with sufism. Altogether nearly ninety works are known to have been written by him concern

ing nearly every domain ofthe Islamic sciences from mathematics to
gnosis, from astronomy to theology.1 But the works of Shaikh-i Baha'I include, besides these writings, buildings and gardens which have helped leave such avivid memory of this figure in the minds of the people of Isfahan and surrounding regions to this day. Shaikh-i Baha'I was an accomplished architect and helped in drawing the plans for the Shah mosque in Isfahan, which is among the masterpieces of Islamic art. He built abath house based on the oral and secret knowledge ofmasonry and architecture which he undoubtedly possessed, abath which according to many witnesses had hot water with only a candle burning underneath its water tank. The bath was destroyed about forty years ago. Hedesigned theplans for thebeautiful Fin Garden of Kashan, which served as a model for themore famous Shalimar Garden of Lahore. In yetanother field, he calculatedthe proportion of water of the Zayandarud to be distributed to each piece of land on the river's course to Isfahan, awork which is called the Tumar-i Shaikh-iBahd'T. This involves a very complicated mathematical problem, which he solved sowell that over three and a half centuries later his method is still used and only after the projected dam onthe river is finished will his division ofits waters be no longer applicable. Shaikh-i Baha'I is the last eminent representative of the Muslim hakim in the sense of being the master of all the traditional sciences. He was also one ofthe last eminent representatives ofthe class of 'ulama who were outstanding mathematicians and who did not feel it below their dignity to take an astrolabe and make actual observations or measurements. After him, with only a fewexceptions, the 'ulama ceased to be interested in the mathematical sciences, with the result that the teaching ofthese sciences deteriorated rapidly in the madrasas. Shaikh-i Baha'I was an authority in both the exoteric and esoteric aspects ofIslam. He hardly hid his sufism and frequented sufl gatherings openly. His Tutt-nama contains some of the most eloquent and frank expositions ofsufism inPersian verse. His sufism also possessed a popular aspect without itself being inany way devoid of intellectual content or the awareness that belongs only to the elite {khavdss) among the sufis. But in the sense that the highest is reflected in the lowest, his

sublime siifl message was propagated within thepopular strata of sufism and even in fact among the populace in general. To this day many storytellers (naqqals)in the traditional tea houses chant his poetry, while his theological and juridical works are read by advanced religious students in the madrasas. Also his prowess and competence as a mathematician of the Pythagorean kind and fame as an alchemist have left their mark on the popular conception held of him. He is an eminent representative ofthe sufl scientists ofwhich Islamic history has produced many examples. In traditional theosophy or Hikmat Shaikh-i BahaT does not reach the level ofMir Damad, his contemporary and close friend, orMulla Sadra, his student. But his contributions to Shl'I law and theology, mathematics and sufism are sufficient tomake him one ofthe leading lights of the Safavid period. He isone of the figures most responsible for the rapid spread of Shl'I learning in i oth/16th century Persia and a person who, more than any other figure ofhis day, sought todisplay the harmony between the law and the way, the Shari'a and the Tariqa, which comprise the exoteric and esoteric dimensions of Islam. Most of the well known scholars who came to Isfahan were students of Shaikh-i Baha'I: men such as Mulla Muhammad TaqI MajlisI, Sayyid Ahmad 'Alavl, Sadr al-Dln Shlrazi and Mulla Muhsin Faiz Kashani. Over thirty of his students, many of whom also studied with Mir Damad, became well known figures themselves, spreading in yet another way the influence of their teacher. Through allthese channels, that is, his writings, monuments andstudents, Shaikh-i Baha'I was able to exercise widespread influence throughout nearly all classes of Persian society. There is no other figure of the Safavid period who became so well known to theelite andthe common people alike, and who left such a deep mark as a national and almost mythological hero upon the people of Persia.

Most historians, such as Tunakabuni, Qisas, p. 333, agree that Mir Damad was a descendant of the Prophet through Imam Husain, whereas 'All Khan, Salafat al-'asr, p. 485, considers him as Hasanid.

the School of Isfahan. As the person who established and classified the traditional sciences in the new Shl'I setting of Safavid Persia, as Aristotle had done in Athens and Farabi in the newly born Islamic civilisation as awhole, Mir Damad has been honoured with the further title ofthe "Third Teacher" (mu'al/im-isdlis), following Aristotle and
Farabi, theFirst and the Second Teachers.1 Asfor histitle Damad ("son-in-law"), it refers to the fact that his father was the son-in-law of Shaikh 'All 'Abd al-'AlI KarkI, the celebrated Shl'I scholar ofthe early
Safavid period.2 Mir Damad also composed fine poetry under the pen name Ishraq, by which he is known in the annals of literary history. But this appellation also has a philosophical significance inthat it demonstrates openly his attachment toishraql theosophy. The date ofMir Damad's birth has not been determined with certainty: that given in the glosses upon the Nukbbat al-'iqdl of Sayyid Jamal al-Dln Husain BurujirdI is 969/1561—2, and appears as fairly likely considering the date of his death and the approximate span of his life, which are known. His education was carried out mostly inMashhad, and possibly Arak, and his best known teachers were Shaikh 'Izz al-Dln Husain b. 'Abd al-Samad, the father ofShaikh-i Baha'I, and Mir Fakhr al-Dln Sammaki, who taught himthe intellectual sciences {al-'ulum al-aqliyya)? Mir Damad travelled several times within Persia to Qazvln, Kashan and Mashhad and accompanied Shah SafI to Iraq, where he died in 1040/1630-1; he was buried in Najaf near the mausoleum of'All, and his tomb isvenerated tothis day. It was possible for Mir Damad to revive the intellectual sciences and especially Hikmat because of his special gift in these sciences, addedto the remarkable respect and authority inwhich he was held among the jurisprudents and theologians as well as with the king. He lived an extremely pious life and is said tohave read half ofthe Qur'an every night. Many of his poems are dedications to the Prophet and 'All, such as the following quatrain inpraise ofthe Prophet ofIslam:
O Seal of Prophecy! The two worlds belong to thee.
The heavens, one is thy pulpit and nine thy pedestal.
There would be no wonder ifthou didst not cast a shadow,
For thou art light and the sun is itself thy shadow.

MS inthe Majlis Library, Tehran. 2 Iskandar MunshI, trans. Savory, p. 234.
3 Anaccount of his life and teachings is found in nearly all the standard biographies and
histories such asLif/i/at al-Babrain, Mustadrakal-vasSil and Rau^dt al-janndt, as well as in more contemporary sources such as A'yan al-sbi'a and Kaibanat al-adab.

In his Persian work, the Ja^avat, he begins with a poem dedicated to 'All in which he sings:
O herald of the nation and soul of the Prophet, The ring of thy knowledge surrounds the ears of the intelligences.
O thou in whom the book of existence terminates, To whom the account of creation refers, The glorified treasure of the revelation, Thou art the holy interpreter of its secrets.
The intensity of religious fervour in Mir Damad was too great to permit his being criticised in any quarter for having revived Hikmat and the wisdom of Ibn Slna and Suhravardl. To this element must be added the abstruseness of his writings, which veiled their meaning from the eyes of the uninitiated and helped establish the banner of Hikmat firmly, without any opposition from the 'ulama. No Muslim philosopher or sage has ever written works in such adifficult style and complicated phraseology, which makes access tohis works well nigh impossibleforall, save for those with a sound training in the tradition of Islamic philosophy and the aid of the oral instructions which accompany the texts. The difficulty of Mir Damad's works is such that many stories have been told about him and it is even said that, during the first night in the grave, when the angels asked him concerning his beliefs he gave an answer that was so difficult that even they did not understand it and so went to God in search of help. The anecdote continues by mentioning the fact that even God did not comprehend Mir Damad's sayings but allowed him nevertheless to enter Paradise because he was a virtuous man. About fifty works ofMir Damad are known, ofwhich most arein
Arabic and a few, including his collection of poems, are in Persian.1 These include works ontheology and jurisprudence, Qur'anic commentary and other religious sciences, and especially Hikmat, which is the subject of most ofhis writings. The most celebrated ofthese are
al-Ufuqal-mubtn, al-Sirat al-mustaqtm, Qabasat, which is possibly his most important opus, Taqwim al-tmdn and Taqdisdt, all in Arabic, and ]a%avat and Sidrat al-muntaha in Persian. The lattermost work may have been completed or even written by his student Sayyid Ahmad 'Alavl, although in the Ja%avdt Mir Damad mentions it as one of his own
1 I.al-SJsi, in a recent Ph.D. thesis at the Faculty of Letters of Tehran University (1967), which involved the preparation of a critical edition of the Ja^avat, mentions 5 2 works by Mir Damad.

writings. He also wrote commentaries upon the works of Ibn Slna and Naslr al-Dln Tusi, and the collection of Persian and Arabic poems, Mashdriq al-anvdr.
Mir Damad revived Avicennan philosophy in ishraql dress. He may be considered as an ishraql interpreter of Avicennan metaphysics in the spiritual universe ofShi'ism. But his interpretation is very far from the rationalistic Avicennanism with which the Occident is acquainted
through the interpretation ofmedieval latin scholastics.1 In fact, in a conscious manner MirDamad distinguishes between YamanIand Yiinanl (Greek) philosophy, the first of which he associates with wisdom derived from revelation and illumination and the second with rationalistic knowledge. The "YamanI" here refers to the symbolism of the right side (jamiri) of the valley when Moses heard the revelation of God. The right side or the east is therefore symbolically the source of illumination and revelation, of light and spirituality, and the left side or the Occident, inaccordance with the well known symbolism of ishraql theosophy, the source of darkness or of purely discursive and
rationalistic knowledge.2 The school of Hikmat thus established by Mir Damad, very far from being a continuation ofMuslim Peripatetic philosophy as it came to be known in the West, was a school in which illumination was combined with ratiocination and where the Avicennan metaphysics was transformed from an abstract system of thought to a concrete spiritual reality which became theobject of spiritual vision and realisation. Nowhere is this better seen than in two works of Mir Damad which record two different spiritual visions he had, thefirst in Ramadan 1011/1603 and the second twelve years later inthe middle of Sha'ban 1023/1614. The first, which occurred ina mosque in the city of Qum after the afternoon prayers, involved a theophanic vision of the Prophet and his five Companions, Abu Dharr, Salman, Miqdad, Hudaifa and 'Ammar - who are so important for Shi'ism - the Twelve Imams and the host of angels. These figures oflight appeared toMir Damad with such intensity that he wrote that he would have anostalgia for the vision of this spiritual universe until the Day of Judgment.

The second vision, which took place twelve years later at Isfahan, came directly from thepractice of invocation {dhikr) in a spiritual retreat (khalwd). As Mir Damad himself accounts in hisKisdlat al-khafiyya al-qudsiyya al-malakuttyja, the vision came when he was invoking the two Divine Names, al-Ghani and al-Mughni. Suddenly he was taken on the wings of the spirit to the spiritual world where he was given a vision of the celestial hierarchies and the various superior states of being. Ina most dramatic fashion the vision involved an actualisation of the Avicennan metaphysics and cosmology from what appears as an abstract scheme inPeripatetic philosophy toa concrete reality in accordance with all true metaphysics, which deals not with theory in the modern sense but with theoria, or intellectual and spiritual vision in its original Greek sense. Moreover, the vision took place on the eve of the birthday of the Twelfth Imam, on anight which according to Shl'I sources is the second most sacred night in the Islamic calendar after lailat al-qadr orthe night ofpower. It isa night when spiritual influences descend upon man and when this very descent or deployment of grace (Jaid) makes possible the spiritual ascent described by Mir
Damad.1 The two experiences described by Mir Damad himself are the only witnesses we possess tothe spiritual side ofhis life, a life which was otherwise immersed in religious and philosophical activity. Butthe very fact that he was able toexperience such visions proves the constant presence of a spiritual life and a practice which is the same as sufism in its most universal manifestation. There isnothing closer to sufi spiritual practices than the dhikr and the khalwa. This may appear strange in a sage who wasespecially known for his powers of ratiocination and logic and who was such an authority inthe exoteric sciences. But one of the characteristics of later Persian theosophy is precisely thefact that philosophy and rational thought aretied to spiritual practices and illumination, and metaphysics becomes not the result ofrational thought alone but the fruit ofvision ofthe superior world. An element that characterises the works ofMir Damad is his concern with time and the relation between change and permanence, or the eternal and the created (qidam and buduth).This problem has occupied Muslim theologians and philosophers from the beginning and many

SPIRITUALITY, PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY
solutions have been presented for it, although it cannot be solved through rational thought but only through the coincidentia oppositorum made possible through metaphysics and gnosis. Mir Damad is known as theauthor of a novel view on this subject called hudus-i dahri. He distinguishes three realms of being which areas follows: Sarmad, or eternity, refers to that reality which does not change, or more exactly to the relation between the changing and the changeless. This concerns the Divine Essence and the Divine Names and Qualities, which are the self-determination of the Essence andthemselves immutable. Below this world, which alone is absolutely eternal, stands dahror the world which relates the immutable tothe changing. The world is created not directly by the Essence but through the immutable archetypes or
"lords ofthe species" {arbdb al-anvd1) and dahr represents precisely this relationship between these immutable archetypes andthe changing world. Below dahr stands time (^amdri), which represents the relation between changing things. The world was notcreated in time in the sense that there was first a time and then an event called creation which took place in it. This would be hudus-i %amdni which Mir Damad rejects. Rather, according to him this world was brought into being through the archetypes and with respect to dahr which stands above zaman. Creation is therefore hudus-i dahri;it is ibdS and ikhtirS, not takwin.
This theme isamply treated by Mir Damad in all its ramifications and he comes back toit again and again inhis books. His works infact are not divided into theclassical four sections of metaphysics {ildhiyyaf), natural philosophy {taWiyydi), mathematics (riyd^iyydi), and logic (mantiq) that we find in the well known works of Islamic philosophy such asthe Shifd' and Na/dt of Ibn Slna or the Persian Durrat al-tdj of Qutb al-Dln Shlrazl. Rather, they treat different themes of metaphysics and philosophy whose axis remains the problem of the relation between time and eternity. Altogether these works show a Suhravardian interpretation of Avicennan philosophy in the matrix of Shi'ism, in which the most rigorous Peripatetic logic is combined with aPythagorean interest in number and harmony and an ishraql attraction to the illuminative aspect of the angelic world. These are elements that were instrumental in establishing theSchool of Isfahan, which Mir Damad more than any other figure helped tobring into being and which found its culmination in his disciples and students. Of the intellectual progeny of Mir Damad the most important is

Mulla Sadra, whom Mir Damad held inthe greatest esteem and to whom we shall turn shortly. But there are a host ofothers suchas Sayyid Ahmad 'Alavl who became Mir Damad's son-in-law and is known for his commentary upon the Shifd' ofIbn Sina and works which elucidate the thought ofhis master. One must also mention Mulla Khalll QazvinI, a most respected scholar of his day, who has left one of the best known commentaries upon the Usiil al-kaft of KulainI, Zalall Khunsarl, one of the well known poets of the Safavid period, Qutb al-Din Ashkivarl, the author of the monumental history of philosophy in Persian called the Mahbub al-qulub, which remains unedited to this day, and lesser known figures such as Ahmad b. Zain al-'Abidln 'Alavl 'Amill Jill and Mlrza Muhammad Qasim b. Muhammad 'Abbas Jllanl. One must mention also particularly Mulla Shamsa GllanI
(d. 1098/1686-7), w n o continued the school of Mir Damad, writinga treatise on the problem of the creation of the world, about which he also corresponded with Mulla Sadra, and commenting upon the Qabasat ofMir Damad. The combination ofAvicennan and ishraql elements seen in Mir Damad is very much present in his works and he
is among the most faithful propagators of his master's teachings.1
Mir Abu'l-QasimFindiriski
A contemporary and close friend ofboth Mir Damad and Shaikh-i Baha'I, Mir FindiriskI is much less known and less studied and remains to this day the most mysterious intellectual figure of the Safavid period. In his lifetime he was considered, along with Mir Damad and Shaikh-i Baha'I, as one of the great masters of Isfahan and was highly revered in religious circles as well as at court. He lived a lifeof simplicity and asceticism and was apractising sufi whose personal life can be compared in every way with those of the well known classical
masters ofsufism.2 He travelled toIndia frequently and was highly revered by Hindu Yogis and Muslim sages alike. He issaid to have journeyed often, but he also lived in Isfahan for a considerable portion of his life and taught philosophy, mathematics and medicine inthat city. Because of his sufi practices and esoteric knowledge Mir FindiriskI came to be credited with miracles such as being in two places

at once and travelling great distances instantaneously. The very attribution of these accounts to him is of the greatest interest in understanding his personality. Even after his death his reputation would not leave him alone, for when he died in 1050/1640— 1 in Isfahan he was buried in the famous Takht-i Fulad cemetery, not in a regular grave, but in one which is surrounded within the earth by a metal case. Since he was celebrated as an alchemist, people were afraid that his grave would be dug up by those who sought the philosopher's stone and who would violate the sanctity of his grave inquest of physical gold. Mir FindiriskI wrote little. His extant works include the monumental commentary in Persian upon the Yoga Vasistha which had been rendered into Persian by Nizam al-Dln Panlpati and which is one of the major works in Persian on Hinduism, a treatise on motion (Risd/at al-haraka), another on sociology from thetraditional metaphysical
point of view (Kisala sana'iyya) and the Usiil al-fusiil on Hindu wisdom. Recently his treatise on alchemy, in Persian, has also been discovered in a manuscript acquired by theLibrary of the Faculty of Letters of
Tehran University.1 But his most famous work isaqastda which summarises the principles of Hikmat in verses of great beauty, showing Mir FindiriskI to be an accomplished poet like MirDamad and Shaikh-i Baha'I. The poem begins with the verses:
Heaven with these stars is clear, pleasing and beautiful; Whatever is there above has below itaform. The form below, ifby the ladder of gnosis
Is trodden upward, becomes the same as its principle,2
and continues to discuss the most essential aspects of Hikmat. It has been for this reason commented upon by several later hakims suchas Muhammad Salih Khalkhall and Hakim 'Abbas Darabl. It is also highly regarded bymost of the contemporary masters of Hikmat in Persia. Many later authorities believe that Mulla Sadra studied with Mir FindiriskI and learned the particular features of his doctrine such as trans-substantial motion and belief in the "imaginal world" from him. This is impossible to deny categorically, forthere may have beenan oral instruction imparted, but what remains of the written worksof

Mir FindiriskI reveals that inphilosophy he was a faithful follower of Ibn Slna and specifically denied trans-substantial motion {al-harakat al-jauhariyyd) and the archetypal world in his particularly philosophical works. Moreover, allof his students except Mulla Sadra — if wedo accept that Mulla Sadra studied with Mir FindiriskI - were more or less
Avicennan.1 Yet his qaslda affirms the reality of the archetypal world and reveals Mir FindiriskI as a siifl pure and simple. One must therefore say that Mir FindiriskI, while a master ofPeripatetic philosophy and the sciences such as medicine and mathematics, in all of which he taught the classical works such as the Shifd'zx\&Qdnun, was apractising siifl and gnostic who was also well versed in the occult sciences such as alchemy and, in addition, Hindu metaphysics. He is yet another of the remarkable intellectual figures of the Safavid period who were masters of several disciplines and expositors of different planes of knowledge. Mir FindiriskI trained many students, some of whom became well known figures. These include Mulla Rafl'a Gllanl (d. 1082/1671-2), the commentator upon the Usu/ al-kdfi, Mulla Muhammad Baqir Sabzavarl (d. 1098 or 1099/1686—7), author ofseveral important works on jurisprudence such as the Kifaya and glosses upon the Ishdrat wa'l-tanbihdt and Shifd' ofIbn Slna, and Aqa Husain Khunsari (d. 1080/1669—70), who was one of the greatest Shi'I scholars of his day and wrote Mashariq al-nufiis on jurisprudence and also glosses upon the Shifd'and Ishdrat. But besides Mulla Sadra, Mir Findiriskl's most famous student was Mulla Rajab 'AH Tabrlzl (d. 1080/1669-70), who was the outstanding teacher of philosophy in the second half of the nth/17th century. Mulla Rajab 'AH, the author of many works including the Kilid-i bihisht ("Key to Paradise") oneschatology, was opposed to Mulla Sadra and did not accept his views concerning trans-substantial motion and the union of the knower and the known. Also, opposed to the great majority of Muslim philosophers, hehad nominalistic tendencies and considered being (rvujud) to be shared only nominally by existing things without its corresponding to an objective reality. He taught the books of Ibn Slna and trained many well known students, including QazI Sa'Id QumI and Muhammad Rafl' Plrzada, who under the direction of his master composed al-Ma'drif al-ildhiyya, assembling therein the lessons given by

Sadr al-Din Shira^J (Mulld Sadra)
The philosophical and theosophical movement of the Safavid period reaches its climax with Sadr al-Din ShlrazI, known asMulla Sadra or Sadr al-muta'allihln ("the foremost among thetheosophers"), whom many Persians consider as the greatest Muslim thinker in the domain of metaphysics. His influence has been immense ever since his death and he has infact dominated the intellectual scene inPersia during the past centuries. The present day interest in traditional Islamic philosophy in Persia also revolves around his name and many works have been devoted to him in the past few years. Sadr al-Din ShlrazI was born into anaristocratic family of Shiraz in 979 or980/1571 or 1572 and received the best education possible inhis native city. Gifted from early childhood with a love for learning and being the only son of a wealthy and influential father, he was placed under the care of the best masters from anearly age and was able to learn Arabic, the Qur'an, Hadlth and other religious sciences early in life. This was made easier forhim because ofhis intense devotion and religious fervour which hecombined with keen intelligence from the age of childhood. At that time, although Shiraz was a major city, the great centre of learning was Isfahan, to which the young Sadr al-Din decided to travel in order to benefit fully from the presence of the masters at thecapital. In Isfahan he pursued hisstudies eagerly first with Shaikh Baha' al-Din 'Amill in the religious ortransmitted sciences {al-'ulum al-naqliyya)and then with Mir Damad in the intellectual sciences {al-'ulum al-aqliyja). It is said that he wrote a work on the order of Mir Damad and when Mir Damad saw it heexclaimed that henceforth no one would read his own works. Some sources have also mentioned that Sadr al-Din studied with Mir Findiriskl but, asalready pointed out, this has not been established with certainty. After completion of his formal studies, Mulla Sadra began a new phase ofhis life in quest ofthe other kind ofknowledge, which comes through intuition and illumination resulting from inner purification. He left the busy life ofthe capital and retired to a small village named Kahak, near Qum, where he spent according to some seven and to others eleven years inascetic and spiritual practices. He attained inthis way immediate knowledge ('///»-/ hu^iirt)as he had perfected earlier his grasp of acquired knowledge ('ilm-i husiilt). At this moment he was asked byShah 'Abbas IIto come to Shiraz to teach and train qualified

students. He accepted the call and returned to public life, spending the last thirty years ofhis life teaching inthe Khan school ofShlraz built for him by Allahvardl Khan, the governor of Fars. Due to the presence of Mulla Sadra, the Khan school became a great centre of learning attracting students from near and far. In fact, itbecame so famous that it attracted the attention of some of the European travellers of the period such as Thomas Herbert, who writes: "And, indeed, Shlraz has a college wherein is read philosophy; astrology, physic, chemistry, and
the mathematics; so as 'tis the more famoused through Persia".1 Itwas also during this period that Mulla Sadra wrote most ofhis works. On returning from his seventh pilgrimage onfoot to Mecca hedied in
Basra in 1050/1640 and was buried in that city.2 Nearly fifty works ofMulla Sadra are known, most ofwhich were lithographed during the Qajar period and are now being republished in modern editions. Some of these concern specifically religious themes such as his Qur'anic commentaries and the monumental commentary upon the Usiilal-kafi ofKulainI, which was left uncompleted. Others deal with Hikmat properly speaking, such as al-Shawdhid al-rububtyya, in many ways his personal testament and the summary ofhis teachings, al-Mashatir on being and Hikmat al-'arshiyya on the posthumous becoming of man. Yet another group of his writings are commentaries upon earlier philosophical works such as the glosses upon Ibn Sina's Shifa' and the commentary upon Kitab al-hidaya of Athlr al-Dln Abharl known as Shark al-Hiddya, which became the most famous work on Islamic philosophy in the Indian subcontinent and is referred to as Sadrain India and
Pakistan to this day.3 Mulla Sadra also wrote two works in his own defence, one the Sih as/, his only Persian work in prose, in whichhe defended gnosis ('irfan) against the attacks of superficial doctors of law and jurisprudents, andthe Kasr al-asnam al-jdhiliyja, in which he defended the Sharl'a and the exoteric dimension of religion against some of the extremists who existed within certain sufi orders and to whom he
refers as the mutasawwifin of his time.4 Mulla Sadra also wrote a Divan

It thus acquired the meaning of mustasvif, a term used by some of the earlier sufls to designate those who know nothing about Sufism but pretend to follow it.

of poetry, selections of which have been published. But these poems do not compare in quality with those of his teachers Mir Damad and Shaikh-i Baha'I or those of his students Faiz-i Kashani and LahljI. The outstanding masterpiece of Mulla Sadra is the al-Hikmat al-muta' dliyyafi'l-asfdr al-arba'at al-'aqliyya ("The Supernal Wisdom concerning the Four Journeys of the Intellect"), known in Persia asthe Asfdr. This most advanced text of Hikmat is a final summation of traditional wisdom, including, in addition to the most thorough exposition of Mulla Sadra's own vision, avast amount of material relatedto the views of earlier gnostics, philosophers and theologians. It is therefore a major source forour knowledge ofIslamic intellectual history and atthe same time a testament to the author's remarkable knowledge of earlier philosophical, religious and historical texts. The Asfdr, which is taught only to students who have already mastered Peripatetic philosophy, ishraql theosophy andKalam, is taught in traditional schools over a six year period and isthe crowning achievement in the traditional curriculum of the "intellectual sciences" in the madrasas. Numerous commentaries have been written on this work, of which some of the best known include the commentaries of Mulla 'All Zunuzl and Hajjl Mulla HadI Sabzavarl. The Asfdr and its commentaries are like a central river compared towhich all other streams are peripheral. In such fashion has this work dominated the intellectual life ofPersia; and the later philosophical and theosophical schools have been like so many tributaries that have only contributed to its expansion in its onward march. The work of Mulla Sadra, all of which except for the Persian Sib as/, a few letters and the poems are inArabic, are written ina remarkably lucid style which infact makes them appear as deceptively easy. There is, moreover, amixture of logical analysis, mystical gleaming and references to religious sources, especially the Qur'an and Hadlth, which characterises all ofSadr al-Dln's writings. He achieved in his own life, as well as in his works which are the fruit of that life, asynthesis of the three means open to man in his quest after truth: revelation {wahy or sbar'), illumination and intellectual intuition (dhauq) and ratiocination (istid/dlor 'aql in its limited meaning). His works reflect this synthesis. A most rigorous dialectical and logical discourse, in which type of expression Mulla Sadra was an unmatched master and for which heis especially known in the Indian subcontinent, is often followed by a gnostic utterance received through illumination to which heusually

refers as "truth received from the Divine Throne" (tahqiq 'arsht). In the same manner rational arguments are supported by citations from the Qur'an, and the commentaries upon the Qur'an and Hadlth are carried out through the process of hermeneutic interpretation (ta'wit) in sucha way as to reveal their gnostic meaning. There is but one inner, spiritual reality which manifests itself outwardly in the revealed scriptures,in the soul and mind ofman and in the cosmos, or"upon the horizons" to use the Qur'anic terminology. The synthesis achieved by Mulla Sadra aims at bringing man back tothis one spiritual reality from all the different modes of perception and knowledge that are open to him, whether it be the given text of revelation, or ratiocination and its analysis ofthe externally perceived world, orthe inward illumination which opens up the inner horizons of the two above modes ofknowledge and is atthe same time objectivised and regulated by them. The synthesis ofMulla Sadra and his intellectual progeny is based upon the integration of the four major schools of Islamic thought alluded to earlier: namely Kalam, Peripatetic philosophy, ishraql theosophy and 'irfan. In Mulla Sadra we find elements of Ghazall, Ibn Slna, SuhravardI and particularly Ibn 'Arabl. Moreover, there is Shi'ism, especially in its gnostic aspect, which serves as the background for this whole synthesis. The Nahj al-balagha of'All and the traditions of the other Shl'I Imams are aconstant source of inspiration for Mulla Sadra and amajor source of his doctrines. Of course, this synthesis could not have been achieved without the work of the sages and philosophers of the two preceding centuries. But their work in turn finds itsfinal meaning and elaboration in the doctrines of Sadr al-Dln. There are many principles which distinguish the metaphysical doctrines ofMulla Sadra, not all ofwhich can be enumerated here. Some of the most important of these principles include the unity, principiality and gradation ofbeing; trans-substantial motion; the unity ofthe knower and the known and the reality of "mental existence" {wujud al-dbihm) as a distinct state ofexistence which makes knowledge possible; and the catharsis (tajrid)and independence of the power of imagination {khayat) inthe soul from the body, and also the existence of a cosmic "world of imagination" which makes possible the theosophical
explanation of religious descriptions of eschatology.1

SPIRITUALITY, PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY
The doctrine of unity of being {wahdat al-wujud) is usually associated with sufism and in fact finds its highest expression in thegnostic teachings ofMuhyl al-Dln Ibn 'ArabI and his school. This doctrine is usually mistaken forpantheism orpanentheism by those who cannot distinguish between profane philosophy and a sacred metaphysical
doctrine.1 But in reality it is nothing but the inner meaning of the shahada of Islam, La ildha ill'Alldb, made manifest bythose who are given the vision of the inner meaning of things. There is nothing more Islamic than unity {al-tauhtd) and wahdat al-wujud is the essence of al-tauhld and therefore of Islam. But even this doctrine has levels of interpretation; that is why in Persia a distinction is usually made between the wahdat al-wujud of the 'urafaor gnostics, referring to Ibn 'ArabI and his school, and thewahdat al-wujud of the hukama or theosophers, referring to Mulla Sadra and hisschool. In order to understand this distinction itis necessary to analyse the gradual process by which man comes to understand unity. The first perception ofthe external world for the untrained mind orfor a child istosee multiplicity andonly multiplicity. The multiplicity is due to the quiddity {mahiyya)of each thing which distinguishes it from others, and to consider this multiplicity as ultimately real is to accept the view of isalat al-mahiyyaor "principiality of quiddity" for which Mir Damad and SuhravardI are known, if we do not consider that SuhravardI held to be true for light what Mulla Sadra held with regard tobeing. Of course these sages didnotnegate unity, which for them stands abovethe world ofmultiplicity, but intheir analysis of the world ofmultiplicity they stopped short atthe quiddity of things without considering their existence {wujud). The next stage is tohold that within each thing, which accordingto Avicennan philosophy is composed of existence and quiddity or essence, itis the existence which is ultimately real and not the quiddity, but nevertheless to believe that the existence ofeach object is totally different from that of another. This view isisalatal-wujud ("principiality of being"), but still falls short of fully grasping the sense of Unity. It isthe view of Ibn Slna and his followers. Above this view stands that ofMulla Sadra and his followers, who claim that not only is the existence of each object principial vis-a-vis its

quiddity (isalat al-wujud), but also that the existence of each object is a state and grade ofBeing itself, not a totally independent being. They thus believe that there is only one Being (wahdat al-wujud), which possesses grades and stages {tashkik)while itremains transcendent with respect to these states and stages (maratib), and it is this being and not the quiddity ofobjects which gives reality tothings. Mulla Sadra and his followers are therefore said to believe in the unity (wahdat), gradation (tashkik) and principiality (isalat) of Being (wujud). Above this concept ofthe "Unity of Being" stands the unity ofgnostics, usually called wahdat-i kbassa(special unity), according towhich Being corresponds toonly one objective Reality, God. Nothing else can evenbe said to exist. Everything else is the theophany (tajallt) of this One Being, not having any being of its own, not even that of being a stage and state of the One Being.
On the basis of the doctrine of the Unity of Being Mulla Sadra created the vast doctrine of the metaphysics of being, which is another version of the metaphysics of essence ofSuhravardl. The interrelation between all stages of existence and the incessant deployment from the Source and return to the Source characterise the whole doctrine of Mulla Sadra. There is adynamism in his view; but itmust not be in any way confused with the type of dynamism found in modern thought, which usually results from a forgetting of the immutable essencesof things and terminates ina horizontal and purely temporal and secular evolution that sometimes even appears ina theological garb, as inthe case of Teilhardism. The dynamism of Mulla Sadra is"spatial" rather than "temporal'. It is directed not towards the achievement ofa future state but towards the realisation ofa higher state ofbeing that exists here and now. The world ofbecoming is related to the world of being not by a temporal sequence but ina relation that can be best symbolised by the spatial circumscription of one sphere by another, as we see in the medieval cosmologies based upon the metaphysical symbolism ofthe Ptolemaic spheres. Interestingly enough, Mulla Sadrain fact described this metaphysical relationship without having recourse to Ptolemaic astronomy: his exposition, therefore, cannot be brushed aside so easily by those who, being unable todistinguish the symbol from the brute fact, discard the medieval metaphysical doctrine ofthe states of being because it is tied in its exposition to the homocentric Ptolemaic astronomy.
The relationship between being and becoming, which Aristotle him

self had also sought to explain, lies for Mulla Sadra inthe idea oftranssubstantial motion (al-harakat al-jauhariyya). Ibn Slna and the Peripatetics ingeneral limited motion inthe Aristotelian sense ofthe word to the four categories ofposition, space, quality and quantity; that is, all gradual change from potentiality to actuality or motion for them occurred not in the substance of things, but in one of the above four accidents. Ibn Slna in fact gave reasons in theShifd' as to why the substance of an object cannot change in the process of motion. Mulla Sadra, after answering the difficulties stated byIbn Slna, proceeds to prove thenecessity of trans-substantial motion while arguing at the same time for the "Platonic ideas" or archetypes of things whichthe Peripatetics had negated. It is hardly possible to analyse this difficult
doctrine here.1 Suffice it to saythat for Mulla Sadra motion is the means whereby gradually the substance of a thing changes until itis able toachieve a higher state of being and through man gain accessto the world ofimmutable forms {tajarrud) above and beyond all change. In the same way that the cosmos receives itsreality through the effusion of being from the Origin and Source of all being, the becoming and change inthe cosmos are with the aim of achieving higher states of being and finally states that lie above the world ofchange and becoming and that lead ultimately tothe Source once again. The Universe is a vast system aimed at making possible this catharsis anddisentanglement from matter and becoming which the very rich term tajrld implies (an angel being called mujarrad in the language of theosophy, that is one who possesses the state of tajrld). This possibility exists here and now, atleast for man who stands inan axial and central positionin this world. The role ofHikmat istomake him realise where he stands and toenable him to achieve the state oftajrld. The doctrine oftranssubstantial motion, therefore, in addition to enabling Mulla Sadra to construct a new form ofnatural philosophy, is a cornerstone of both his metaphysics and his spiritual psychology. The problem of how we know, or epistemology, which since Descartes's dissection ofreality has become both central and insoluble in Western philosophy, also occupies a central position in Mulla Sadra's writings. A good part of the first journey of the A.sfar is devoted to it. With a rigour which would satisfy a modern analyst Mulla Sadra seeks to analyse the problem of knowledge from a back

ground which is again essentially gnostic and is based on theunion between the knower (al-'aqil) and the known (al-ma'quT). In the actof perception {idrak) man becomes identified with the object of his knowledge; that is, the knower or 'aqil isatthe moment of perceiving the known identified with the form ofthe known or ma'qul, which is in fact its reality. Knowledge is only possible through this union. In order to demonstrate the possibility of this union taking place, Mulla Sadra must prove the existence of an independent plane of reality which he calls the mental plane {wujudal-dhihni). He is the first of the Muslim philosophers to have devoted attention to this question and tohave analysed all that the reality ofthis plane implies. It is true that the union of knower and known had been alluded to by Abu'lHasan al-'Amirl and some of the sufis, buthere as elsewhere it was Mulla Sadra who forthe first time provided demonstrations for it and incorporated it into a vast metaphysical synthesis. To have found traces of this and other ideas in earlier books does notat all detract from thegenius of Mulla Sadra, for theimportant question is how these ideas are incorporated into a new intellectual perspective. Otherwise inthe domain ofmetaphysics there is nothing new under the Sun, as Aristotle had already asserted. Itis enough to compare Mulla Sadra's treatment of this question with what is found inearlier Muslim sources to realise exactly what he achieved.
For Mulla Sadra the mind is not a tabularasanor only a tablet on which certain "ideas" are engrained. It has several faculties and powers, one of which is to create forms, andthis power is that of "imagination" asthe term is understood by the hukama. Mulla Sadra, like Ibn 'ArabI, believes in the creative power of imagination {mutakhayyila khalldqd), through which the mind isable to bring forms into being in the same way that the Divine Intellect has given objective existence to things through Its own creative power. Knowledge results, notfrom theexternal form "entering" themind, but in this external form acting as an occasion for the mind to create, in accordance with the immutable essence of the object concerned, its form. This act inturn changes the state ofbeing ofthe knower itself. Therefore knowledge is inseparable from being and leaves its effect upon the being ofthe knower.
The catharsis or tajrid of the imaginative faculty plays amajor rolein the eschatological doctrines expounded by Sadr al-Dln. Inthe last part {safar) of the Asfdr as well as inindividual treatises on resurrection and

the afterlife, especially the monumental commentary in the form of glosses upon the Hikmat al-ishrdq, Mulla Sadra has expounded in the most complete fashion the esoteric meaning of the Muslim doctrine of
resurrection and eschatology (ma'ad).1 His writings inthis domain are probably the most thorough and systematic of any Muslim work in this area, where Muslims, incontrast toHindus and Buddhists, have been generally laconic. It is only in the works of Ibn 'Arabl and Mulla Sadra and their schools that these questions are amply treated. The intermediate world of imagination or the "imaginal world", which he also calls "purgatory" (barn^akh) and the world of "hanging forms" {suwar al-mu'allaqd), is the locus of the eschatological events described in sacred scripture. It is where the events of the Last Judgment occur in a real way because this world is real and has an ontological status. This is a world possessing not only form but also matter which is, however, subtle andcelestial (latif and malakuti). Man, likewise, possesses a subtle body, or what in the parlance of Western Hermeticism would be called the astral body. In his glosses upon the Hikmat al-ishrdq, Mulla Sadra asserts that neither the Peripatetics like Ibn Sina nor the theologians like Ghazall could really solve this problem. The one could only prove spiritual resurrection {al-ma'ddal-ruhdni), and the other believed in corporeal resurrection (al-ma'ddal-jismdnt)without being able to provide any demonstration for it. Mulla Sadra broke this deadlock and was able toprove corporeal resurrection inaccordance with Qur'anic teachings by appealing to this intermediate world where man is resurrected after death not asa dismembered soul but asa complete being possessing also asubtle body. Mulla Sadra develops fully the theme ofthe posthumous becoming of the soul and itsresurrection beyond the imaginal world to higher states of being and finally to astation before the Divine Presence itself. He makes the science of the soul ('i/m al-nafs) a branch of metaphysics {ildhiyydf)rather than natural philosophy (tabfiyydf) as was the case with the Peripatetics, and he develops an elaborate science ofthe soul starting with the embryonic state of man and terminating in his ultimate beatitude far beyond the earthly life. Inthis domain no less than in metaphysics he gives an imprint ofa powerful genius toa teaching that isby nature timeless and perennial. Mulla Sadra trained many students, of whom two, Mulla Muhsin

Faiz Kashanl andMaulana 'Abd al-Razzaq Lahljl, are among the first-rate luminaries of the Safavid period and will betreated below. Others less known but nevertheless significant include Shaikh Husain TunakabunI, who continued Mulla Sadra's school after him, AqajanI MazandaranI, the author of a vast commentary upon the Qabasdt of Mir Damad, and Mirza Muhammad Sadiq Kashanl, who went to India to propagate Mulla Sadra's teachings. In Persia the teachings of Mulla Sadra were not continued immediately after him dueto difficult circumstances. But a century later men like Mirza Muhammad Sadiq ArdistanI revived his teachings, and early in the Qajar period Mulla 'All Nurl, followed by his student Hajjl Mulla Hadl Sabzavarl, established Mulla Sadra's school as the central school of Hikmat in Persia.
The akhbdri - usiili debate
Almost contemporary with Mulla Sadra there began a debate which had some influence upon the later course of philosophy and agreat deal of effect upon the further chapters of religious and theological history. This debate concerned the role ofreason inthe interpretation ofreligious matters. An 'dlim by the name of Mulla Muhammad Amln Astarabadl (d. 1033/1623-4) established the akhbdrischool, which opposed the use of 'aql in religious matters and relied completely on the Qur'an and the traditions of the Prophet and the Imams. In his al-Fawd'id al-madaniyya heattacked the idea of ijtihad or the giving of opinion based upon the four principles {usiil) of the Qur'an, Hadlth or sunna, the
consensus of the community (i/md1) and reasoning or 'aql, which in Sunnism iscalled qiyds,and branded mujtabids, orthose who practised ijtihad, as enemies of religion. The opposing school, which came to be known as usiili and which finally won the day, continued toemphasise the importance of'aql within the tenets of the Qur'an and Hadlth. Usually the followers of the akhbarl school were literalists and purely exoteric and outward interpreters of religion, and came to be identified as qishris(those who remain content with only the husk rather than seeking the kernel as well). They were usually opposed tosufism and Hikmat and even Kalam. But this was by no means, always the case. There were some akhbarls who became outstanding sufls and hakims, such as Mulla Muhsin Faiz Kashanl, the disciple of Mulla Sadra. Such men, while opposing the use of'aql on a certain plane, were able to reach the supra-rational domain of gnosis and illumination.

The akhbarl — usull debate continued into the Qajar period in the form of the Shaikh! - baldsart disputes. Strangely enough, Shaikh Ahmad Ahsa'I, the founder of the Shaikhl movement, was close to the akhbarl position and at the same time an enemy of the hakims and sufls. He was particularly opposed to Mulla Muhsin Faiz despite the fact that both may be classified as akhbaris. The situation, then, is more complex than classifying usulls as pro-Hikmat andakhbaris as opposed to Hikmat; although the refusal to consider the role of 'aql in the interpretation of religious matters naturally led the akhbaris away from Hikmat and gnosis, in which reason serves asthe first stage fora knowledge which issupra-sensible and where in any case reason isnever opposed on its own plane, but is ultimately transcended.
Mulla Muhsin Fai% Kashant
Of Mulla Sadra's students thebest known is Muhammad b. Shah Murtaza, known as Mulla Muhsin KashanI or KashI, and given the title of Faiz by Mulla Sadra himself, who besides being his teacher also became his father-in-law. Mulla Muhsin wasborn in Kashan in 1007/1598-9, studied for a few years in Qum and Isfahan, wherehe belonged to the circle of Mir Damad and Shaikh-i Baha'I, and then came to Shiraz to receive the last phase ofhis education from Mulla Sadra and to study the religious sciences with Sayyid Majid Bahranl. The last part of his life he spent in Kashan, where he died in 1091/1680-1 and where he is buried. His tomb is to this day acentre of
pilgrimage and iscredited with miracle-working powers.1 Nearly 120 works of Mulla Muhsin are known, of which most have
survived.2 They are in both Arabic and Persian and have become since his day a mainstay of the curriculum of Shri religious schools. Like FarabI and Naslr al-Dln TGsI, Mulla Muhsin was able to place himself in the different intellectual perspectives and schools of Islam and write outstanding works in each without mixing it with the teachings of another point of view. This, of course, does not mean that he was hypocritical or without a particular point of view himself; rather it means that he observed strictly the hierarchic structure of knowledge that is such an essential element ofIslam and Islamic civilisation, and

avoided the "mixing of the arguments of different sciences" {khalt-i
mabhath), which is so disdained in traditional Islamic learning.1 The works ofMulla Muhsin, ofwhich hehimself has left uswith three lists, include many commentaries upon the Qur'an such as the al-Safi and al-Asfd'; works on Hadlth including al-Wdfi, which isthe most outstanding ofits kind in recent centuries; treatises devoted to the principles of religion (usul al-dtri) such as 'Ilm al-yaqinand 'Ain al-yaqin; treatises on the Muslim rites such as the daily prayers and hajj
and their esoteric significance, in which this period is particularly rich;2 collections of litanies and invocations such as Jala' al-'uyiin; treatises on jurisprudence such asal-Tathir; and works devoted to the lives and sayings of the Imams such as his commentary upon the Sahtfa sajjddiyya of the Fourth Shl'I Imam. Besides these works in the religious sciences, he wrote many works onsufism and gnosis, ofwhich the al-Kalimdt
al-makniina with its summary, al-Kalimat al-makh%una, is perhapsthe outstanding example. This work, which is in Persian, is one of the outstanding expositions of gnosis inits Shl'I setting and treats a com
plete cycle ofmetaphysics.3 Mulla Muhsin also summarised and commented upon earlier sufl works such as the al-Futiihdtal-makkiyya of Ibn 'ArabI and the Masnavi of Jalal al-Dln Ruml. He also wrote many poems himself mostly on mystical themes and in the masnavi form. His divan is very well known and contains some fine verses, although all of his poems are not of first rate quality. As to Hikmat, he did write afew treatises on the subject, but they are not as well known as his works on religion and 'irfan. Perhaps themost important work of Mulla Muhsin outsidethe domain of Hadlth, where he is the undisputed Shl'I authority of the last
centuries, is his al-Mahajjat al-baidd' fiihyd" al-ihyd' ("The White Path in the Revival of the 'Revival'"), the second "Revival" {ihyd') referring to the Ihyd' 'uliimal-dinofGhazall. Inthe same way that the Ihyd' is the outstanding work of sufl ethics in the SunnI setting, theal-Mahajjat al-baidd' must be considered as the most important Shl'I work of ethics with a sufl orientation. Infact, what Mulla Muhsin did was to revive the work of Ghazall in Shl'I circles by "Shi'ifying" it. He achieved this task by substituting traditions drawn from Shl'I sources for the

Sunni ones which serve asa prop forGhazall's book. Otherwise the two works are nearly the same, and ofthe same monumental proportions. A close comparison of the twowould be a most fruitful undertaking to elucidate exactly how the Sunni and Shi'I religious and mystical climates are related. Mulla Muhsin was one of the foremost esoteric interpreters of Shi'ism. While an outstanding exoteric interpreter ofthe religion and an undisputed 'alim of theology andjurisprudence, he was also a gnostic and sufl of high standing and sought throughout his worksto harmonise theSharT'a and the Tarlqa. Ofthe three elements which Mulla Sadra unified in his vast synthesis, namely sbar', kashf and 'aql, or revealed religion, inner illumination and rational and intellectual demonstration, Mulla Muhsin followed mostly the first two. Yet he was of course ahakim well versed in Mulla Sadra's teachings, as works such as the al-Kalimatal-maknuna reveal. In fact, it is with him that the process of the integration of the school of Hikmat into Shi'ism is completed. It ishe who identified the "celestial guide" orilluminating intellect ofAvicennan and Suhravardian metaphysics specifically with the Twelve Imams, who as heavenly archetypes reflect the "light of Muhammad" [al-niiral-mubammadt) which is a sunthat illuminates these "spiritual constellations".

Most of the glosses andcommentaries upon the Tajrid, such asthose of Khafrl, belong more to the tradition of Hikmat than Kalam proper, and most of the debates that are truly theologicalare found within thepages of works on Hikmat, especially those of the school ofMulla Sadra. Lahljl in fact developed a form of Kalam which is hardly distinguishable from Hikmat, although atleast inhis better known works such as the Gauhar murad he does not follow the main doctrinal teachings of Mulla Sadra, asonthe unity of Being and the catharsis of the faculty ofimagination. Yet in other works he confirms these points in such a manner as to indicate that thecondition of his times did not allow an open espousal ofthe teachings of Mulla Sadra and that he had to adopt a more "theological" orKalamI dress tosuit the taste ofsome of the 'ulama who were bynow severely criticising the sufls andthe gnostics.
Lahljl, however, has also left us with works that belong more purely to thetradition of Hikmat such as Hudiith al-'dlam, the commentary upon the Hayakil al-niir of SuhravardI and al-Kalimdtal-tayyiba, which deals with the contending views of Mulla Sadra and Mir Damad on the principiality ofexistence oressence (isdlat-i mujud and isdlat-i mdhiyyat). All these works show Lahljl to be a master in Hikmat anda true disciple ofMulla Sadra. Like Mir Damad and Mulla Muhsin Faiz, Lahljl also wrote poetry which is of a high order containing many beautiful verses. His divan of about six thousand verses, of which the most complete manuscript isto be found in the Kitabkhana-yi astana-yi quds-i razavl in Mashhad, reveals a very different aspect of his personality from that revealedby his other works. Here one finds the gentle breeze of realised gnosis and mysticism in which pearls of wisdom are couched in verses of beauty and harmony rather than in rigorous rationalistic arguments. The poems contain many verses inthe praise ofthe Prophet and the Imams and also long qasldas dedicated to both Mulla Sadra and Mir Damad, with whom Lahljl also most likely had contacts. These are perhaps the most eloquent and telling poems ever written on these two giants of the Safavid period, and they could have been written only by a person of the stature of Lahljl, who stood close tothem both intime and from the vantage-point ofideas.
Lahljl had many students, of whom his ownson, Mlrza Hasan Lahljl, and Qazi Sa'Id Qumi areperhaps themost important. Mlrza

SPIRITUALITY, PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY
Hasan was avery respected religious scholar of his times, revered as an outstanding authority on thereligious sciences. But he was also a hakim ofmuch merit and, ata time when Hikmat was being attacked by some of the 'ulama, wrote awork in Persian entitled A'ina-yi hikmat to defend Hikmat by appealing to the traditions of the Prophet and the Imams.
Qd^i Sa'id Qumi
The other student of Lahljl, Muhammad b. Sa'id Qumi, usually known as QazI Sa'id or as the "Junior hakim" (hakim-i kiichak), is as well known as his master and belongs tothe rank of the most outstanding
figures of the Safavid period.1 Astudent ofLahljl, Mulla Muhsin and also of Mulla Rajab 'All Tabrlzl - who represents the more Peripatetic trend of philosophy in the Safavid period — QazI Sa'id was particularly attracted to sufism and gnosis, while atthe same time he was the judge or qddi of Qum from which position hehas gained his title. In fact, most ofQazI Sa'Id's life was spent in Qum. It was inthis holy city of Shi'ism and centre ofreligious studies that he was born in 1049/1639; here he passed most of his active years and also died and was buried in 1103/1691. Besides serving asthe judge of Qum, hewas also a well known physician in the city and was considered as areal hakim in both senses of the word, as physician and philosopher. The total attachment of QazI Sa'id to'irfan has made him the "Ibn 'ArabI ofShi'ism". This isa very apt title for him because he belongs more to the school ofpure 'irfan ofIbn 'ArabI than tothe schoolof Hikmat of Mulla Sadra, where gnostic themes areprovided with rational demonstration. The works of QazI Sa'id bear this out, for they usually deal with esoteric meaning of revealed and sacred texts and rites. They include al-Arba'iin hadithan, which is a commentary upon forty prophetic hadlths dealing with divine science; al-Arba'undt li-kashf anwdral-qudsiyydt, which isa collection of forty treatises, again mostly concerned with the esoteric meaning of religion; Asrdr al-'ibdddt,which deals with the esoteric significance of the Muslim rites; and commentary upon different traditions such as the famous Hadith-i ghamam. His largest work in this domain is themonumental three

volume commentary upon the Tauhid of Shaikh-i Sadduq, which remains unedited and is not well known except for the section dealing with rites which hasbecome known independently as theabovementioned Asrar al-'ibddat. But he also wrote several works on logic and philosophy such as the Asrar al-sanay? on logic; glosses upon the "Theology ofAristotle", which isamong his most important works; and also glosses upon the Sharhal-isharat of Nasir al-Dln Tusl. The most marked feature ofQazi Sa'Id's thought ishis masteryin revealing the esoteric sense of different aspects of the Islamic tradition in both its doctrinal and practical dimensions. The process ofta'wll, of spiritual and hermeneutic interpretation of things, which isso central toboth sufism and Shi'ism, found in QazI Sa'id one ofits greatest masters. In his writings the inner meaning of verses of the Qur'an, traditions of the Prophet and theImams, as well as Islamic ritual practices, gains the transparence and lucidity which result from the purely gnostic and metaphysical point of view held byhim. In his exposition of the symbolism of the Ka'ba, heeven develops a true philosophy of art, and explains the symbolic significance of forms and spatial configurations with such completeness and thoroughness that
it is difficult to find its like inthe annals ofIslamic thought.1 In this field also he reflects inmany ways the doctrines and teachings ofIbn 'Arabi.
The two Majlisis
It would hardly bepossible to treat philosophy and theology in the Safavid period without dealing with Mulla Muhammad Taql MajlisI and his more famous son, Mulla Muhammad Baqir MajlisI, although they, and especially the son, have been dealt with elsewhere in this volume. The first MajlisI, who died in 1070/1659-60, was one ofthe religious scholars of his time who was attracted to sufism and was
probably a practising sufl.2 The reaction against organised sufism in religious circles had not as yet set in so that Mulla Muhammad Taql could enjoy respect among Shl'I scholars and yet openly espouse the cause of sufism. He rendered agreat service to both in many ways. He was the first Shl'I scholar to spread and propagate widely the text of the

traditions ofthe Imams and to encourage their study, sothat hemust be considered ina way as the father ofthe science ofHadlth inits new development during the Safavid period. He also made the life of sufism in religious circles easier by lending to it the weight of his authority and support. His son, Mulla Muhammad Baqir (b. 1037/1627—8, d. mi/16991700), was in many ways a different type ofpersonality. He was politically more influential than hisfather and must be considered as the most powerful ShI'I scholar of the Safavid period. He was also much more austere and exoteric, and openly condemned and opposed organised sufism, to the extent of denying his own father's allegiance to sufism. Infact, he was the most formidable spokesman for the reaction which set in within ShI'I religious circles during the later Safavid period due inpart toexcesses within some ofthe sufl orders. With the same breath healso condemned the hukama, whose teachings hesaw as closely wedded to those ofthe sufis. The second MajlisI is the most prolific ofShI'I writers, and probably wrote his works with the aid of some of his own students. Otherwise these works, numbering over one hundred and including the monumental Biharal-anwar, could hardly have been written by one man. The Bihar al-anwar itself, which is over twenty-six lengthy volumes in its modern edition, is avast encyclopaedia ofShi'ism dealing with different aspects of Islam as a religion as well as the Islamic religious sciences and the history ofthe Prophets and the Imams. It remains a treasury of information for allthe phases of ShI'I learning to this day. His other works deal with different religious sciences. Some ofthe most famous, such asHaqq al-yaqin and Hilyat al-muttaqin, both in Persian, and Sirdt al-najatin Arabic, are concerned with principles ofreligion, traditions and theology in the general sense, not in itstechnical sense of Kalam. In his commentary upon the Usulal-kdfi of KulainI, however, MajlisI turns to the intellectual sciences and seems to have been influenced by the commentary ofMulla Sadra. Likewise, inhis Zad al-ma'dd there are allusions to Islamic esoteric teachings, which implies that MajlisI was not completely alien tothese subjects and perhaps spoke so vehemently against the hakims and sufis because ofthe particular conditions ofhis time, which necessitated such a position forthe defence ofthe Sharl'a and the official religious institutions. In any case MajlisI left anindelible mark upon alllater ShI'I thought while his opposition to Hikmat only delayed itsnew flowering in the Qajar period.

The later hakims of the Safavid period
Although the atmosphere was not favourable to the propagation of philosophy and theosophy from the second half of the nth/17th century to the Afghan invasion, which put an end to Safavid rule, several notable figures continued to propagate the tradition and make possible its renewal in the 13 th/19th century. Among these figures one may mention Mulla Hasan Lunbani (d. 1094/1682—3), a student of Mulla Rajab 'All Tabrlzl, who combined philosophy and sufism and even wrote acommentary upon the Masnavt. Due to his particular attraction to ishraq and 'irfan he was accused by some ofthe exoteric 'ulama of
being asufl and wrote a treatise in his own defence.1 Another figure of the same period, Mlrza Muhammad Sadiq ArdistanI (d. n 34/1721—2), was more orless a follower ofthe teachings of Mulla Sadra. Like Mulla Sadra, he believed in the catharsis (tajarrud) ofthe inner faculties ofthe soul, particularly the faculty of imagination, and offers the same arguments inproof of this view. But on the question of the origin of the human soul, which he considers as a ray of the universal soul (tiafs-i kullt), hepresents a view which is different from that of both Mulla Sadra and Ibn Slna. On the question
of the unity and principiality of being also he follows Sadr al-Dln.2 ArdistanI was the foremost teacher of Hikmat of his time in Isfahan. His Hikmat-i sadiqiyya, which consists ofhis lectures assembled by his students, isa major work on the school ofHikmat during the Safavid period. He was personally revered because of his extremely simple and ascetic life, butowing to theopposition of some of the religious authorities he finally fell out of favour with Shah Sultan Husain. Yet he was able to be of much influence and to train a number of students, of whom the best known is Mlrza Muhammad TaqI Almasi, a descendant of the first Majlisi. Almasi was the first person to begin to teach the texts of Mulla Sadra in official lessons of the madrasas and was instrumental inpropagating his work. It was his student, Aqa Muhammad Bldabadl, who taught Mulla 'All Nurl, the great reviver of Hikmat during the Qajar period, and so through him the chain of transmission of Hikmat is preserved between the Safavid and Qajar eras. Another of Ardistanl's students, Mulla Hamza GllanI, was also a well known

master ofHikmat and was among the many people who lost their lives in the Afghan invasion of Isfahan. During the last phase of the Safavid period, the school of Mulla Sadra was as yet farfrom being completely dominant. A contemporary of ArdistanI, Shaikh 'Inayat-Allah Gllani, who belonged tothe school of Mulla Rajab 'All Tabrlzl, continued thePeripatetic school of Ibn Slna and taught the Isharat, Shifd' and Najdt. Likewise, there were masters who taught pure gnosis and ishraq. One of them, Mir Sayyid Hasan TaliqanI, was theoutstanding gnostic of Isfahan at thebeginning of the I2th/i8th century andtaught the Fusiis al-bikam of Ibn 'ArabI, aswell asworks of Suhravardi such as the Hikmat al-ishraq and Hayakil al-niir along with their traditional commentaries. Yethe too was to some extent under thesway of the teachings of Mulla Sadra. Altogether, the general impression one has ofthe little known history of these last decades ofSafavid rule is the gradual spread ofthe teachings of Mulla Sadra, especially inIsfahan, while at the same time other schools such as thePeripatetic and thegnostic continue in a climate which became ever more hostile to both Hikmat and 'irfan.
The influence of the school of Isfahan in India
Although interest in Islamic philosophy on the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent goes back to the 7th/i3th and 8th/i4th centuries, the real establishment of a school of Islamic philosophy on the sub-continent dates from the Safavid period. During this epoch many Persian philosophers, scholars and scientists migrated or travelled to India, such as QazI Niir-Allah Shushtari, author of the well known Majalis al-mri'mininandIhqdq al-haqq, Muhammad Dihdar ShlrazI, author of several gnostic treatises such as Ishraq a/-nayjirain, Baha' al-Dln IsfahanI, known asFlzil-i Hindi, who summarised the metaphysics of the Shifd', andthealready mentioned MirFindiriskl. Moreover, the teachings of Mir Damad andespecially Mulla Sadra spread far and wide in India. The Sharh al-Hidaya of Mulla Sadra, to which we have already referred, became the most popular work in the sub-continent. The very large number of glosses and commentaries upon the works of Safavid masters aswell as manuscripts oftheir writings that are found today in the libraries ofthe sub-continent are a witness to the remarkable spread of the teachings ofthe school of Isfahan in that region. In fact, except for Iraq, which was then as now religiously associated with
696



INTELLECTUAL AND SPIRITUAL FIGURES
Persia, the Muslim part of the sub-continent represents the only other region of the Islamic world where this particular school of Islamic philosophy spread to an appreciable extent. The mystical and theological movements associated with such names as Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi and Shah Vall-Allah, as well as the Khairabadi school which is, properly speaking, philosophical and logical, cannot be fully understood without a study of the Safavid schools of thought. In Persia itself after the interim period ofconfusion following the downfall of the Safavids, the school ofHikmat was revived again in Isfahan. The central figures ofthis revival were Mulla 'All Nurl, who taught the works of Mulla Sadra forseventy years, and his student Hajjl Mulla HadI Sabzavarl, who made the teachings of Mulla Sadra so dominant and central as practically to exclude other schools of philosophy. Through him and other Qajar masters theteachings of the Safavid sages have been transmitted to the present day and continueto exercise anappreciable influence, particularly the doctrines of Mulla Sadra, which have received so much attention in recent years and which act asthe axis around which the revival of traditional philosophy inPersia is taking place. Furthermore, they have even attracted
the attention of certain thinkers outside the orbit of Persian culture,1 as the labour of a small group of scholars, foremost among them Corbin, has enabled the Western world to know Safavid philosophy forthe first time and to study itnot only for its historical interest but also asa living school of wisdom and thought, in which arecombined the rigour of logic and the ecstasies of inner illumination.

CHAPTER 14
CARPETS AND TEXTILES*
I. CARPETS
The finest Persian carpets are considered to be those of the Safavid period. There are twopossible reasons for this. Either this particular branch of the arts in Iran reached itszenith later than any other, or else the judgment maybe explained by the fact that none of the Timurid textiles have been preserved and that their evaluation is therefore based entirely on miniatures, whereas we still possess a wealth of Safavid carpets and fabrics which attest their advanced stage of technicaland aesthetic development. Theminiatures leave us in no doubt as to the existence of carpets in theTimurid era. Moreover, thefinest surviving knotted carpets date back to theearly years of the Safavid dynasty and could not have originated spontaneously. References to precious carpets are found asearly as theSasanian period. These, however, will not be dealt with in the present survey, since the evidence does notprovide
any clear impression of their design or technique.1
Timurid carpets
Two types of carpet can be seen in Timurid miniatures, those with geometrical and those with arabesque designs. For an excellent study of these rugs we areindebted to Amy Briggs. The geometrical type is the earlier and forms by far the larger group. Thegeometrical carpets were replaced towards the end of the 9th/15 th century by those with arabesque and floral patterns, thebest examples of which arefound in miniatures by Bihzad andhisschool. Bihzad, who lived approximately from 1455 to 1535- 6 , belonged to theHerat school and in 15 22 hewas appointed librarian to Shah Isma'Il I in Tabriz. Ontheminiature (pi.3) attributed to himanddating from thelast decade of the 15 th century, both types are illustrated. The small carpet in the foreground represents the geometrical group. The designs of these carpets consist of

CARPETS
small repeating patterns of squares, stars and crosses, hexagons, octagons or circles, thereby showing similarities to the patterns of contemporary paving tiles. The framing of these shapes by narrow light-coloured bands interwoven into stars or crosses and in between into knots is characteristic. Interlacing also occurs as a filling motif and is typical of the borders where the light drawing on a dark background is based on Kufic script. The corners are accurately worked out, using a reciprocating design divided at an angle of 45°. The ground of the inner panels is monochrome or shaded in contrasting colours like a chessboard. Arabesque motifs are rare in these geometrical carpets. Their similarity to the 16th-century "Holbein" carpets of Asia Minor is remarkable, and it is conceivable that these are a continuation of early Timurid rugs.
The later style of arabesque pattern is displayed by the other two carpets on Bihzad's miniature and by the awning in the background. (As a rule awning patterns are closely related to those of the carpets, even in the Safavid era. Unfortunately, as in the case of the carpets depicted on the miniatures, it is not clear how they were made or of what materials. Their function suggests that they were woven from silk or made of embroidered linen.) The differences between these and the geometrical carpet in the foreground are plain. The small repeating pattern has given way to a complicated and extensive quaternate symmetrical arrangement. Constructed lines cover the inner field, describing semicircles, circles, polyfoils, cartouches and ellipses. These shapes overlap to some extent and thus-segments are formed which through their colouring and the arabesques specially designed to fill them stand out independently. The formalised Kufic border was replaced by a repeating pattern of elegant undulating tendrils. In the case of the awning in the background one is struck by the medallion centre piece. Further innovations include rugs and awnings with an almost isolated medallion in the centre and corner pieces resembling the quarters of a central medallion, on a ground covered with arabesques and even incorporating animal figures; and carpets with a pattern entirely of scrolling tendrils on a monochrome ground. Both
these kinds too are to be seen on miniatures by Bihzad.1 The detailed reproduction of these textiles seems to have been of particular interest to him and it may be assumed that the development of the new style,

CARPETS AND TEXTILES
which has affinities with that of book illumination, was at least influenced by him. The three principles of composition - the division of the surface by intersecting lines into various symmetrically arranged panels, the medallion and panel design - together with individual motifs used in this context, such as tendrils, flowers andterminal arabesque leaves, form the basis of the carpet patterns of the Safavid period, at the beginning of which indeed Bihzad was still active. Carpets inthe geometrical style are no longer found inthis period.
Safavid carpets
As was mentioned at the outset, noteven a fragment of a Timurid carpet appears to have survived. This is curious not only because there are a great number of carpets and fabrics dating from the Safavid period butalso because two large carpets dating back to theyears 1522—3 and 1539—40 are still extant invery good condition (pis. 6,7). The question therefore arises whether some fragments held to be Safavid might not in fact date back tothe Timurid era (e.g. pi. 5). This can scarcely be proved, for despite theabundance of examples the criteria for dating individual Safavid pieces within the two centuriesin question are not very substantial andthe reader who expects the assigning ofprecise dates and places oforigin inrespect ofthis period will be disappointed.
Dating
Four carpets with the date woven into them, two ofwhich, alas, were produced almost contemporaneously, plus a few documents, do not provide very reliable evidence. Adegree of uncertainty as to the dating existed in the case ofthe medallion animal carpet inthe Museo Poldi Pezzoli in Milan (pi. 7),since here thedate one thought could be construed as either 929/1522 or 949/1542. After intensive examination of the original I prefer nowadays the earlier reading. Thus this carpet dating from 929/1522-3 is ourearliest dated example. The famous carpet produced for the tomb ofShaikh SafI in Ardabll and now inthe Victoria and Albert Museum in London (pi. 6) bears the date 946/1539—40. Together with a companion piece now in the County Museum of Los Angeles, it was sold in 1886 through the agency of Ziegler and Company to the London firm of Vincent Robinson,

because money was needed for the restoration of the mosque. The carpet was restored with the help of its counterpart. Its purchase by the Victoria and Albert Museum for £2,500 — an astonishingly high price in those days — was a sensation, as is even today the carpet itself, which measures 11.52 x 5.43 metres and displays a refined drawing, a close weave of some 5,200 knots per square decimetre and subtle nuances of colour. It is one of the most important carpets of the 16th century and there can be little doubt that it was Shah Tahmasp himself who commissioned such a costly pair of carpets, particularly since they were destined for the mausoleum of the founder of the Safavid dynasty.
An interval of more than a hundred years separates these two pieces
from a "vase" carpet in the Sarajevo Museum dated 1067/165 6.1 The latest dating - 1082/1671 - occurs on a silk carpet from the mausoleum
of Shah 'Abbas II in Qum.2 Other inscriptions are of a purely literary nature. The style predominant round about 1600 and in the first quarter of the 17th century is represented by the so-called "Polonaise" carpets, silk knotted carpets brocaded with gold and silver. Their production in Kashan and particularly in Isfahan at this time is attested by a commission tendered in Kashan in 1601 by King Sigismund III Vasa of Poland, by five not very typical examples in the Treasury of San Marco which were brought to Venice as ambassadorial gifts from Shah 'Abbas I, and by the contemporary reports of European travellers. European paintings, which are useful in the dating of Anatolian rugs, cannot on the basis of research to date help us to classify Persian carpets. The pictures in which Persian carpets are depicted, for example 17th century Dutch paintings, are relatively late and merely provide examples of the "Herat" group of carpets. The Safavid miniatures show that the whole wealth of forms that recurs in textile design was already fully developed by the beginning of the 16th century. The carpets depicted represent both types, the medallion and the scrolling tendril carpets, but are not painted with sufficient discrimination to allow us to allocate them to individual sub-groups and thus employ them for the purpose of determining dates and origins.
We must therefore fall back on the two masterpieces dating from 1522—3 and 1542, the style developed under Shah 'Abbas in the first
1 SPA, pi. 1238. 2 SPA, pi. 1259.

CARPETS AND TEXTILES
quarter of the 17thcentury which is represented by the early "Polonaise" carpets and isclearly distinct from that ofthe rugs ofthe time of Shah Tahmasp, andtwo comparatively late examples from about 1660—70. Within this framework one must date pieces according to stylistic criteria, examining ineach case the precision ofthe design and the craftsmanship, and the configuration and stage of evolution of individual forms. The subjectivity of such judgments explains why individual pieces have been differently evaluated by different experts.
Origin
No less difficult isthe problem of origin, that is, the task of attributing to individual weaving centres the various groups which can be distinguished among Safavid carpets on the basis of their design and technical characteristics. The fewinscriptions we have are of little help. Admittedly the Ardabll carpet bears the words "produced by... Maqsiid ofKashan" and the silk carpet from the Qum mausoleum the words "the work ofMaster Ni'mat-Allah of Jaushaqan", but this does not mean that the origin of the craftsmen is the same as that of the rugs, any more than that the destination was necessarily identical with the place oforigin. Since the Safavid carpets must be the productsof large establishments patronised by the Court, it may be supposed that carpets were manufactured inthe workshops ofsuccessive capitals.In 1501 Shah Isma'H (1501-24) conquered Tabriz and was crowned there. In 1548 under Shah Tahmasp (1524-76) the court was transferred to Qazvin, andin 1598 under Shah 'Abbas (15 87-1629) it moved to Isfahan. It is likely that carpets were produced in Tabriz under Bihzad's influence. As late as 1700 Frantz Caspar Schillinger refers to
the close-woven carpets sold in that town.1 Itis surprising that hitherto scarcely any attempt has been made to trace carpets to Qazvin,although the Court was established there for fifty years. Early in the 17th century Florencio del Nino Jesus emphasised that Qazvin was an important trading centre where there was an abundance ofsilk and bro
cade carpets.2 In thecase of Isfahan there is reliable evidence from various sources ofthe manufacture ofcarpets brocaded with gold and silver threads. Indeed Jean-Baptiste Tavernier describes the exact loca
tion of the workshops in theMaidan quarter.3 But woollen carpets

CARPETS
were also woven in Isfahan, for Tavernier writes on another occasion: "The Karkrone is the house of the royal manufactories where fine carpets of gold, silver, silk and wool, together with gold and silver
brocade, velvet, taffeta and other such fabrics are made."1 The pro-European policy of Shah 'Abbas drew many Europeans to Persia as envoys, traders and missionaries, and their reports are of great help in determining the origin of silk textiles brocaded with gold and silver. By comparison with these representative showpieces the woollen carpets seem to have been far less impressive and unworthy of detailed description. Thus we learn nothing about the designs peculiar perhaps to certain localities. A highly interesting exception is the description by Engelbert Kaempfer of the banqueting hall, probably in Isfahan, during an audience on 30 July 1684. He writes: "The most striking adornment of the banqueting hall was to my mind the carpets laid out over all three rostra in a most extravagant fashion, mostly woollen rugs from Kirman with animal patterns and woven of the
finest wool".2 Other sources with which I am familiar are content with brief allusions which at best merely indicate the quality. Kashan is mentioned most frequently, always as outstanding for the manufacture of silk, and it was still named as the centre of this industry
by Chardin as late as 1670.3 A report for the years 1607-8 notes that here carpets of gold and silk, fine brocades and velvets, satin and
fabrics of many kinds were worked.4 D. Garcia de Silva y Figueroa, who visited the town in 1618, considers the carpets made there to be
the most beautiful in all Persia and on a par with those of Isfahan.5 Unfortunately, it is not clear from the account whether silk or woollen rugs are meant. Subsequently Kashan appears to have been superseded by Isfahan in the manufacture of carpets. Pedro Teixeira, who left Goa in 1604 and journeyed to Europe via Persia, judges the carpets of Yazd to be the best, followed by those from the province of Kirman and
then those of Khurasan.6 Chardin also speaks of carpet factories in
Kirman and particularly in Slstan.7 On the other hand, in 1636—7
Adam Olearius avers that the best carpets come from Herat.8 Tadeusz Krusihski, looking back in about 1720 over the reign of Shah 'Abbas, enumerates as the places where the latter established royal workshops the provinces of Shlrvan, Qarabagh, Gllan, Kashan, Kirman, Mashhad,

Astarabad and the capital Isfahan.1 Thus the following weaving centres emerge: Kashan for brocaded silk carpets, Isfahan for brocaded silk carpets and woollen carpets, forthe latter inaddition Yazd, the provinces of Kirman and Khurasan with Herat. That Tabriz is mentioned only once, about 1700, may perhaps beexplained bythe fact that the evidence is noearlier than the 17th century, while Tabriz ranked as a place ofimportance during the first half ofthe 16th century. Over against these centres we have clearly defined groups of Safavid carpets that have subsequently been distinguished. The categories are based onvarious criteria, sothat some are named after peculiaritiesof design, such as the vase and garden carpets, while others are named after the provenance once attributed tothem, for instance the "Polonaise" carpets, the Herats, Isfahans and Kashans. Only in the caseof these so-called "Polonaise" carpets is it possible to correlate themon the basis of the materials used, silk, gold and silver. In the case of every category it seems to me supremely difficult to assign them to one or other of the weaving centres mentioned. The assumptions asto their origin which have gained credence over the years are purely hypothetical and such designations as north-west Persia or Tabriz, southern Persia or Kirman, eastern Persia orHerat should be regarded asparaphrases serving to identify thevarious types rather than as accurate descriptions of their provenance. Hitherto the only expert to declineto make definite assertions about their origin because of the lack ofevidence has been A. C. Edwards. Perhaps one day town chronicles, workshop reports or copies of designs will come to light and clarify the situation, but this isprobably wishful thinking.
Principles of composition
Quite apart from the special characteristics which distinguish different types andprovenances, Safavid carpets andwith them all Oriental carpets, are designed according to definite principles. The most obvious ofthese is the division into an almost invariably rectangular inner field, and anenclosing border which consists of a main central stripe and two or more guard-stripes. In the design ofthe field onefindsin general a continuous, usually multi-layered arrangement of small or large repeating patterns, from which a section is chosen and sur

rounded by the border. The attention paid to symmetry is characteristic. Most common of all is the quaternate symmetrical layout, in which the pattern is arranged like mirror images on the longitudinal and the transverse axes of the carpet and which determines the composition of the late Timurid rug and of the awning on the Bihzad miniature illustrated. This design is also apparent, though less clearly, in the small-sectioned panel design (see pi. 4) and in patterns composed of scrolling tendrils (see pi. 9). It is most easily recognised on medallion carpets. Here, in the centre of the carpet, and on a second level, as it were, a medallion is superimposed on the quaternate symmetrical section from the panel design. The composition of the ground may be formed by a small repeating pattern constantly reciprocated (see pi. 8), or alternatively the unit of design may be so large that it constitutes a whole quarter of the carpet (see pi. 6). The design consists as a rule of two layers, for instance a more broadly drawn primary tendril system with a secondary filling tendril motif (see pi. 6), or a system of tendrils on which is superimposed a design of figures and animals (see pi. 7). Sometimes the ground is filled like that of a miniature with trees, flowering shrubs, animals and hunting scenes (see pi. 13). If only one medallion is superimposed, it serves merely to emphasise the central point of the carpet. Usually, however, the central medallion is complemented by the repetition of a quarter of this medallion in each of the four corners of the field, thereby showing that it is part of a second repeating pattern and of a more extensive arrangement of offset medallions. The medallions of the early Safavid carpets have an unbroken linear contour and vary from starshaped and round to ogival. They are found on other textiles as early as the 15 th century. The internal design of the early Safavid medallions is isolated from the pattern of the ground and does not extend beyond the edges of the medallion. Ancillary forms are frequently added to these medallions, generally an obliquely-set cartouche and a shield-like appendage on the longitudinal axis on either side; these are treated just as independently. In the case of 17th-century carpets, on the other hand, particularly the so-called "Polonaise" carpets, the independence of medallion and ground gives way to an interrelationship in that the tendrils of the background invade the medallion and vice versa. The medallions with a linear outline are replaced by formations of symmetrically arranged forked leaves which are integrated with the tendrils of the ground (see pi. 15 b) and which go back partly to the filling motifs of the earlier

medallions. Thus the medallion of this "Polonaise" carpet corresponds to the internal design ofthe medallion ofthe silk carpet illustrated on plate 15 a. In addition to the carpets with a quaternate symmetrical design, there are others ofwhich the patterns form mirror images only along the longitudinal axis (see pi. 10). Examples without any axial symmetry are more rare. They are always adorned with figures andhave a picture-like character. Interesting intermediate stages are seen in the carpets on plates 12 and 13. Another type ofdesign isthe division ofthe surface into compartments that can be arranged both inthe quaternate symmetrical fashion and in anascending manner. These "compartment rugs" are directly connected with late Timurid book illumination and with Bihzad and the Herat school. The earliest example is probably a carpet in the Metropolitan Museum, NewYork (pi. 4). Here light-coloured, concavely and convexly undulating bands intersect and circumscribe shield-like panels arranged concentrically around octafoils. Rows of star motifs are produced between which other rather smaller octafoil rosettes are inserted as connecting links, so that the pattern covers the whole surface like a web. The incomplete stars on thelonger sides indicate that here once again we have asection of an endless pattern.A tent ina miniature ofthe Herat school dating from i486 is decorated
on the same principle.1 The larger medallions ofthe carpet illustrated on plate 4 depict the battle ofthe dragon and the phoenix; the smaller ones each contain four beasts drawn from Chinese mythology, the lions or dogs of Fo, and the shields alternately contain symmetrical spiral tendrils with terminal arabesque leaves and birds. Theremaining portions of the ground are filled with scrolling tendrils and cloudbands. The whole is framed by a border of cartouches linked by rosettes or small circular intermediate shapes. There are several examples of this among Safavid carpets. Because of the subtle design one can without hesitation ascribe this compartment rug and itscounterpart in the Musee des Tissus, Lyons, to the first half of the 16th century. What is clearly a later pair of carpets has the same panel design as that upon which the medallion ofthe carpet on plate 8is superim
posed in thecentre.2 Another pair of carpets shows a variation in

which shields and quatrefoils are arranged in alternating rows.1 Sections from similar patterns were also used as borders (see pi. 9). The penetration of the compartments which is familiar from the carpets in Bihzad's miniatures was repeated in the case of another carpet in the Metropolitan Museum, which has intersecting cartouches, and in the
case of a pair of "Polonaise" carpets in the same collection. 2 The former carpet is so close to the vase carpets in its colouring that it could not have originated at the same period as our initial example but rather belongs - like the pair of "Polonaise" carpets - to the beginning of the 17th century. An essential difference is the fact that in these later examples the filling motif of spiral tendrils is not tailored to fit the individual fields but they overlap each other. The division of the surface into rhomb-shaped compartments formed by tendrils or lanceolate leaves is a common feature of the vase carpets.
Apart from carpets with closely corresponding patterns which may well, however, have been produced at different periods, there are many matching pairs where sometimes the one carpet is a reciprocating image of the other. At least some of these must have been intended for use in pairs. Such a pair of carpets is depicted on a miniature painted about 15 40 by Mir
'All Tabrlzl.3 The so-called "Polonaise" carpets in particular often exist in pairs. The carpets featured on plates 4 and 6 also have exactly matching companion pieces and one could list a whole series of other examples. The representation of figures shows the influence of miniature painting. The symbolic motifs of dragon and phoenix, crane, Ch'i-lin, cloud-bands and -whisps are of Chinese origin. They were already common elements in Timurid book illumination and found their way into carpet and textile patterns through Timurid and Safavid miniatures. Figured carpets reached the zenith of their development during the reign of Shah Tahmasp in the 16th century. The finest example is a silk hunting carpet with an amazingly close weave of some 12,000 knots per square decimetre; formerly in the possession of the Habsburg dynasty, it is now in the Osterreichisches Museum fur angewandte Kunst in Vienna (pi. 13). Just as the formal medallion design characteristic of the 16th century disappears almost completely in the 17th century, so too in this same period carpets modelled on miniatures decline in importance, and the few pieces which, owing to

the decadence of the design, cannot be assigned to the 16th century are simply offshoots ofthe carpets of the early Safavid era. Prayer rugs occupy a special position, since their design is governed by their function. A characteristic feature of the field design is the niche form, the point of which is directed towards Mecca during prayer. This form is in imitation of the mihrab, which in a mosque points in the direction ofMecca, the qibla.There are some prayer rugs with a single niche and others with several. Scarcely any Persian examples survive from the 16th and 17th centuries. The earliest is the fragment of a prayer rug with a pattern arranged inrows inthe Museum furIslamische Kunst inBerlin (pi. 5). It does not allow us todraw any conclusion as to the number of niches arranged side by side and one above the other. Stripes with light-coloured tendrils ona red ground delineate the individual fields. Narrower bands separate the niches and the surviving spandrels. The niches and spandrels are executed alternately in light and dark colours. The design ofthe spandrels consists ineach case ofscrolling tendrils with terminal arabesque leaves which intheir elegance and refinement are remarkably reminiscent of a fabric serving
as a coverlet on a miniature dated 1514.1 The formation ofthe niches differs from one row to another. The accuracy and richness of the design indicate that it originated in the early Safavid period, but it is
also possible that it dates from the Timurid era, as F. Sarre suggested.2 There is nothing toindicate its place oforigin. Inthe case ofanother type ofprayer rug with only one niche, the spandrels and the borders
of the upper half are adorned with verses.3 There are thirty-seven rugs of this kind in the Topkapi Sarayi in Istanbul, clearly Turkish in origin and dating from the 19th century. Itis not known whether these are copies of 16th century Persian originals or whether the examples hitherto thought to be Persian themselves belong to this Turkish
group.4 The same problem occurs with the stylistically closely related medallion carpets of the so-called "Salting" group named after a carpet
from the Salting Collection inthe Victoria and Albert Museum.5
"North-west Persian" medallion carpets
These fall into different categories which may be broadly divided into two groups ofcontrasting styles. Inthe one group, represented by the

Ardabll carpet (pi. 6) which is dated 1539-40, the drawing is sinuous; in the other, best exemplified by the Milan hunting carpet of 1522-3 (pi. 7), the drawing is rigid and angular. Over against scrolling tendrils with flowing convolutions we have a lattice of straight lengths of tendril and almost rectangular offshoots. Since the inscriptions vouch for a not too long difference of time in production of both carpets, the differences cannot be ascribed to a progression or degeneration from one type to another. The reason for assigning a common origin to them was presumably the fact that both must have been produced in a court manufactory and that at the time they were woven the seat of government was still in Tabriz.
The same disparity between figured and angular forms occurs in the case of medallion carpets with a purely representational pattern, said to have originated in north-west Persia. Examples of the former kind are an animal carpet in Milan and the so-called "Chelsea" carpet in the Victoria and Albert Museum, which is also interesting for the unusually large pattern section of offset medallions connected diagonally by pointed ovals and which, judging by its design, falls between the
Ardabll carpet and the compartment rug (pi. 4) described above.1 The second kind is represented by a medallion carpet with a white ground, formerly in the Clarence H. Mackay Collection, and its companion piece in the Islamisches Museum, East Berlin - a rug which was largely
destroyed during the last war.2
In a less complex type the medallions are superimposed upon a continuous, somewhat clumsily drawn design with a small repeating pattern. Figured motifs do not occur in these cases. One of the best pieces of this kind which, unfortunately, has not survived in its original size of some 10 X 3.95 metres will serve as an example (pi. 8). The plate is a photographic montage. The central portion of the carpet as far as a point just beyond the partial shield of the medallion has long since belonged to the Victoria and Albert Museum. A quarter of the missing piece with the corner was acquired a few years ago by the New York collector Joseph V. McMullan and it enabled experts to reconstruct the carpet. The pattern of the background, as is predominant in carpets of this kind, consists of a repeating pattern of very slender symmetrical scrolling tendrils terminating in arabesque leaves. At the

point where the spirals touch, palmettes are superimposed. The medallion formed by interlocking multi-coloured fields is reminiscent of the cartouche carpets. The border characteristic of this type is composed of a repeating pattern of short reciprocating interlacing arabesques.
"Herat" or "Isfahan" carpets
The most outstanding features of this group are large palmettes superimposed in many variations upon a quaternate symmetrical arrangement of very slender scrolling tendrils. Medallions are rare.The ground is generally crimson, the borders dark blue or dark green. Within this group again two types can be distinguished. Inthe earlier kind belonging to the 16th century (pi. 9)the design isvery compact and interwoven with many cloud-bands. The ends ofthe tendrils are not emphasised. A fewpieces have details picked out with metal thread. Animals - partly creatures from Far Eastern mythology such as the stag Ch'i-lin and dragons - and beasts preying on one another are often incorporated inthe pattern. The best animal carpet ofthis kind, together with a similar fragment, is in the Osterreichisches Museum
fur angewandte Kunst in Vienna.1 The Far Eastern motifs were doubtless responsible for these carpets being attributed to eastern Persia. This provenance has yetto be proved to be correct, although itis known that carpets of high quality were indeed produced inKhurasan and its capital Herat. The carpets decorated with scrolling tendrils which are depicted on the miniatures of the Herat school lack the large palmettes and cannot be classified as "Herat" carpets. In the later type the floral designs are simplified, cloud-bands are less frequent, and there are no animals. Along with thepalmettes large lanceolate leaves attached tothe ends of the tendrils and often divided into different coloured halves dominate the pattern. The borders consist mostly of repeating patterns of sinuous S-shaped tendrils terminating in lanceolate leaves, and of large palmettes superimposed at the tangential points of the single units of design. The same borders are found on the "Polonaise" carpets, and it is surely right to assume that they were produced in the same period, namely the 17th century. Whether this type of "Herat" carpet is synonymous with the woollen carpets of Isfahan

and thus represents a style characteristic of Isfahan, or whether the "Polonaise" carpets are merely influenced by this group, remains an open question. It was recently suggested that some of them might stem from India, and so we find the term "Indo-Isfahan". We know that such carpets were exported to India and were also imitated there. In the palace of Jaipur even today there is a whole series of examples. Precise distinctions between Indian and Persian pieces of this kind have never to my knowledge been traced: at least no findings have been published. These later "Herat" carpets must have been a commodity highly prized by Europeans, for apart from the fact that a large number are still extant they were reproduced relatively often in paintings, particularly in the pictures of 17th-century Dutch genre painters; they occurred above all in Holland and Portugal. Through the East India companies both these countries cultivated close trading links with Persia and India. Thus Joan Cunaeus, an envoy of the Dutch East India Company, reports that in 1651—2 he purchased forty-nine carpets in Isfahan and had them brought overland to Hurmuz, where they
were shipped to the company base at Batavia and thence to Holland.1 At the beginning of the 17th century Pedro Teixeira writes of the trade with the Portuguese in Hurmuz: "There usually come from all the provinces of Persia to Harmuz large caravans or cafilas, to trade with the Portuguese and other Christians, and the heathen and Moors that reside there, and to barter what they bring, namely gold, silver, raw and manufactured silk, brocades, carpets, horses, madder, alum,
tuthiath, rhubarb, rose-water, and divers other commodities".2
The "Sangus^ko" group
In the case of woollen carpets the influence of miniature painting is most clearly seen in the twelve or so carpets of the so-called "Sanguszko" group. The designation derives from the carpet which at the London Exhibition of Persian Art in 1931 provided the stimulus for the classifying of this group and which belonged to Prince Roman
Sanguszko.3 Although almost all of the carpets belonging to the group have a medallion design, I have chosen as my example the fragment from the

Maciet Collection now exhibited in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris (pi. 12), because here, independently of each other, quite definite themes from miniature painting were taken up, and the connections and influences therefore emerge particularly clearly. Thus we see — in each case twice repeated like mirror images along thelongitudinal axis - inthe upper zone Shlrln discovered in the pool by Khusrau, and underneath a hunting scene, then Laila with the dying Majnun inthe desert. On the longitudinal axis the symmetry is broken by the introduction of supplementary figures. There results a cross between a textile pattern, which through reflection and sequence is potentially capable of infinite extension, anda picture. A fine example of this is the silk hunting carpet in Vienna (pi. 13) towhich the whole group is closely related formally. Since the rugs of the Sanguszko type reveal the same degree of stylistic development as the figured silk tapestrywoven carpets which we know from documentary evidence to have been manufactured in Kashan - astage illustrated among other things by the preference for ogival medallions and an increasing amount of stippling on animals and garments - K. Erdmann believes that they too originated inKashan. A.U. Pope, on the other hand, proposes
Yazd or Kirman.1 In texture and inits individual scatter motifs the carpet illustrated corresponds to the "vase" carpets. The rugs ofthe Sanguszko group date back to the second half of the 16thcentury.
"Vase" carpets
The name derives from flower-filled vessels inthe form of Chinese porcelain vases which occur on many ofthese carpets. On the rug illustrated (pi. 10) the vase isinthe centre. Vase carpets are distinguished by awealth of colour and vegetable forms. In addition to the most fantastically executed rosettes and facetted palmettes the characteristics include stylised lilies, naturalistic flowering shrubs and snailshell-like motifs that represent perhaps the remnants of shrunken cloud knots. With few exceptions the patterns unfold in an ascending direction, and form mirror images along the longitudinal axis. Usually they go back to a rhomboid design. For the most part the lozenge shapes are formed as in ourexample by several tangential andintersecting tendrils

which, on a monochrome ground, are far less marked than the flowers. However, they may also be clearly framed by tendrils or wide lanceo
late leaves and filled in different colours.1 The symmetry of the design is quite often relieved by an asymmetrical colour pattern. There are also vase carpets without any marked rhomboid design but with inter
laced rows of offset flower vases or shrubs.2 In the case of two examples with an unusual composition in the McMullan Collection a medallion and corner pieces are superimposed on an ascending pattern
of this kind, against the rules of the medallion design.3 Pieces with an
arabesque pattern and medallions are also found.4 In the main, two borders were used. One of them, which has a repeating pattern of two interlaced arabesque tendrils, can be seen in the illustration. The other is very narrow and enclosed not by secondary stripes but merely by bands. The pattern consists of rosettes or palmettes alternating with squares of tiny flowers and a diagonal stem. The narrow borders and the elongated format have led some scholars to suppose that these vase carpets were intended for the floors of mosques. One or two examples
whose irregular outlines are adapted to the ground-plan of a building,5 the strong construction produced by a layered, so to speak double, arrangement of the warp, and the relatively large number of fragments appear to confirm this. Regarding the chronological sequence of individual patterns and the question of which "vase" carpets to assign to the 16th century and which to the 17th, opinions vary. I cannot believe that the variations in design succeeded one another in time, but consider rather that they existed side by side and that their dating must be based on the quality of the detail. A few fragments with a luxuriant and animated design and particularly well executed detail correspond stylistically to the best "Polonaise" carpets and are doubtless contemporary with them — that
is, they were woven at the beginning of the 17th century.6 The problem is whether the more distinctly drawn, formalised pieces in the main group represent the antecedents or a subsequent development of these fragments. In some an unambiguous degeneration is seen in the impoverishment of the design; in the case of others which are still very rich

despite anapparently more simple pattern, it is exceptionally difficult to reach a conclusion. Judgments will remain subjective. The vase carpet dated 1656 in the Sarajevo Museum is not atypical example and does not help us very much. Its design is to my mind remarkably good and suggests that the majority of vase carpets were produced in the 17th century.
Garden carpets
Garden carpets (pi. 33) are representations of Persian gardens with their strict geometrical and rectangular composition, with canals and ponds where ducks and fish swim and which are bordered bymultifarious trees and shrubs. Between them play birds and mammals. The Persian rulers were passionately fond ofsplendid gardens, and so the Safavid period saw the establishment of the gardens of Hazar Jarlb near Isfahan, extolled by 17th-century European travellers, and the garden laid out in 1612 by Shah 'Abbas in Ashraf, in the provinceof Mazandaran. The carpet illustrated corresponds tothe vase carpetsin technique, colouring and the detail of the pattern, such as the two vases on a level with the middle watercourse and the interspersed snailshelllike forms. The quality of design is akin to that of a garden carpet measuring 28'8" by i2'3^-" in the Jaipur Museum which is probably the
earliest piece in this group.1 On thereverse there is an inscription which records that this "foreign carpet" arrived atthe Palace of Jaipur on 29 August 1632. The carpet hadprobably been woven shortly before and brought from Persia toIndia as a gift oras a commission. The rigid formalisation and geometrical nature ofevery shape dis
tinguishes what is definitely a later type from its Safavid predecessors.2 It certainly did not develop until the 18th century and is held to be north-west Persian orCaucasian inorigin.
"Portuguese" carpets
Since the same kind of design iscommon tothem all, these constitute the most uniform group (pi. 11). Erdmann lists nine examples surviv
ing intheir entirety and three fragments.3 They were given their name

because of the scenes depicted in the spandrels which have been construed as the arrival of a Portuguese embassy in the Persian Gulf, and also because it was assumed that these carpets were intended for the Portuguese in Goa. They show a mixture of European and Oriental motifs in a highly unusual arrangement. A rhomboid central panel with four small ogival medallions and a serrated and pinnate outline is surrounded by concentric interlocking stripes of different colours. In the early examples they are animated and have irregular protrusions. In the later ones they are straight, run exactly parallel and are evenly stepped. The stripes fill the surface except for the spandrels in each of which there can be seen two sailing ships with people on board dressed in European fashion, and next to these a man emerging from the water and waving to the ships, the head of a sea monster and a few fish. This scene must be derived from a European model, possibly from a map.
The border is related to the panel design of some arabesque carpets.1 As in the case of the "Herat" carpets, the origin of the Portuguese rugs has been traced both to Persia and to India. E. Kiihnel believes them to be indubitably Persian. K. Erdmann and he propound southern Persia as their provenance. C. E. C. Tattersall suggests Kashan. A.U. Pope, on the other hand, opts for Goa (Portuguese India). The latter opinion rests more on the unusual character of the "Portuguese" carpets compared with other Persian rugs than on any inherent resemblance to Indian carpets, which is itself no more convincing. The whole group would seem to belong to the 17th century. How the same theme could subsequently be repeated in the Cauca
sian region is likewise a mystery.2 Furthermore, two small silk carpets which fall between the "Polonaise" rugs and the "Portuguese" carpets are designed on the same principle, though without the scenes in the
spandrels.3
Silk carpets of the 16th centuryand tapestry-woven carpets
The changes which took place between the 16th and the 17th centuries can be traced particularly clearly in the case of the silk carpets. The earliest and most impressive example is the Vienna hunting carpet (pi. 13). It represents the climax of the rugs modelled on minia

tures that were produced in the reign of Shah Tahmasp. A large part of the detail is picked out in gold and silver thread. Its size - 6.93 X 3.23 metres - corresponds to that of the great woollen knotted carpets. There was a somewhat smaller silk carpet of almost identical quality in the collection ofBaron Maurice de Rothschild and now belonging to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The provenance is believed to be Tabriz or Kashan, which was famous for its silk industry. With these two carpets is associated a group of some thirteen small silk carpets (see
pi. 15a) which K. Erdmann calls "the small silk carpets of Kashan".1 The majority likewise have amedallion design into which, inthe case of an example in the Gulbenkian Collection, animal figures and beasts preying on one another are introduced. Apart from this example such figures rarely occur in this group, in fact on only four rugs with an ascending, asymmetrical pattern which are picture carpets pure and simple. The representation ofhuman beings and peris isnot found on these rugs. On the other hand, these motifs dooccur together with scenesof animals fighting on some woven silk carpets which with two exceptions are similarly of small format. Therepresentational tapestrywoven carpets are closely related to the carpets of the "Sanguszko" group and reveal the same stage of stylistic development. A decisive innovation vis-a-visthe knotted silk carpets is the use of brocade not only to pick out detail but over whole panels. The Munich hunting
carpet,2 which unfortunately does not survive in itsentirety, is outstanding among tapestry-woven carpets by virtue of its size, the excellence of the design and the hunting scenes which link it directly with the Vienna hunting carpet. In addition to the example illustrated (pi. 14) two small tapestry-woven rugs similar toour example are also associated with it,asare the remnants ofa once large piece and three carpets in Berlin, Washington and Copenhagen with a dragon and a phoenix inthe central medallion and slender flowering tendrils on the ground; these last three are known as "Padishah" carpets becauseof
the inscription on the Berlin example.3 The designs of all these tapestrywoven rugs contain ogival medallions with transverse cartouches and partial shields, typical secondary motifs of the early Safavid period. They are framed by borders of alternating cartouches and polyfoils. Besides the figured tapestry-woven carpets, there is a second con

trasting group with a purely floral design. These include a complete
carpet in Munich1 and half a carpet in Washington incorporating the arms of King Sigismund III Vasa of Poland. It is certain that these are two of the carpets which Sigismund commissioned through Sefer Muratowicz in Kashan in 1601. An invoice dated 12 September 1602 lists pairs of carpets and a sum of five crowns for the execution of the
royal coat of arms.2 On the occasion of the marriage of the Polish princess Anna Catherina Constanza, the daughter of Sigismund III, to the Elector Palatine Philipp Wilhelm, an unknown quantity of carpets came into the possession of the Wittelsbachs in 1642 as a dowry. Among them was doubtless the tapestry-woven carpet adorned with the coat of arms, and probably the other tapestry rugs and "Polonaise" carpets now in Munich. The heraldic carpets provide evidence of the stage of stylistic development attained by tapestry-woven carpets round about 1600. In their case we perceive a simplification and a coarsening of the drawing, compared with the figured tapestry carpets and particularly with the Padishah carpets, in respect of the tendrils of the background, the large flowers and the lanceolate leaves. This would suggest that the figured pieces - with the exception of a tapestry-woven rug in the Louvre showing Bahram Giir vanquishing the dragon, and the one in the Thyssen Collection in Rohoncz castle, near Lugano, with a repeating pattern of cartouches, polyfoils and shields - date from the latter half of the 16th century. When comparing them with the knotted silk hunting carpets it must be remembered that for technical reasons a tapestry-woven rug cannot match a knotted carpet of the greatest density for delicacy of design. Correspondingly a chronological sequence can be established in the case of the floral examples by drawing stylistic comparisons with the heraldic carpets and a pair of embroidered silk carpets in the Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, which together with other textiles were brought to Europe in 1639 by a Persian embassy to Duke Friedrich of HolsteinGottorp and which reveal in the centre a star-shaped medallion with two opposite phoenixes. This sequence begins with a few tapestry
woven carpets in the latter half of the 16th century3 and continues to the end of the 17th century. It is characteristic of these pieces that the close link with the early Safavid carpets remains unimpaired by the stylistic development that occurred in silk carpets about 1600.

"Polonaise" carpets
The production of silk knotted carpets was markedly increased under Shah 'Abbas I and these carpets form the only group in which a completely new style developed at the beginning of the 17th century, quite distinct from 16th-century rules ofcomposition (see pi. ijb). The misnomer has been the subject ofcriticism ever since the appearance of the catalogue of the Exhibition of Oriental Carpets in Vienna in1891, in which A. Riegl disputed the alleged Polish provenance of these carpets. There has been no lack of alternative suggestions, but none have been sufficiently apposite to replace the original name which by now hasbecome a terminus technicus. The total of some two hundred and thirty extant examples shows in what numbers these rugs were produced, for they were not — as was once assumed — destined exclusively for export or as gifts for European rulers, butequally, as showpieces, formed part of the furnishing of Safavid palaces. Onthis point 17th-century travellers' reports leave usinno doubt. As with the tapestry-woven carpets, large panels and often the whole ground ofthe "Polonaise" carpets are brocaded. Nowadays the distribution ofgold and silver can be discerned only from the yellowor white silk cores ofthe interwoven threads, since the metal covering has largely dropped off or been oxidised. Thecolours of the silk pile, particularly the salmon pink, the bright tomato red, and the shadesof green and yellow are as a rule badly faded. In the case of the example illustrated the original colours are still visible on the reverse. The costliness of the materials ledto economies which are evident in the predominantly small size ofthe silk carpets and also, in the case of the "Polonaise" rugs, in the use ofcotton forthe foundation. Awarp and weft wholly of silk is found only in those fewantecedents and early examples where the style ofthe main group isnot yet fully defined and
which are very delicately and linearly drawn.1 It ischaracteristic of the typical "Polonaise" carpets, on theother hand, that they transfer the emphasis from the linear to the planar, achange which finds expression above all inthe abandonment ofthe monochrome ground. The scrolling tendrils arereduced to thefunction of demarcating theirregular panels which they describe andwhich are filled in different colours, thereby standing outindependently. With this tendency to juxtapose

grounds of different shades instead of contrasting them with one another as on the early medallion carpets, it is not surprising that compartment patterns are revived. Through the abandonment of the unified background and the clear delineation of the medallions, the latter are incorporated into the panel design and lose their overriding function. Where they appear to be preserved the medallions are almost always dependent upon a cartouche pattern ranged beneath them and merely serve as overlapping rosettes at the tangential points of the units of design or as filling motifs. In the detail, the abjuring of clear contours and lines is seen in a baroque luxuriance of forms and an accumulation of short encircling tendrils and fan-shaped miniature leaves. The most important individual device is the arabesque leaf which to a large extent determines the composition and acts as a terminal motif in the primary tendril system. The broad lanceolate leaves in the secondary tendril motif and the palmettes are reminiscent of the late type of "Herat" carpet. The large number of surviving "Polonaise" carpets provides us with an insight into the technique of sketching the designs. The patterns are derived - with only one or two exceptions - from thirteen designs constantly varied by the choice of different sections, medallions or colours, so that, for instance, there is almost always a series of smaller carpets dependent upon the few large pieces. Over and above these connections we can discern fifty-two matching pairs where the companion pieces correspond even in their borders and colour schemes. The Europeans who visited Persia in the 17th century were so impressed by the splendour of the silk carpets brocaded with gold and silver that in their reports, as I related in my introduction, they supply us with a considerable amount of evidence which enables us to assign these rugs to Kashan and Isfahan and to fix their dates. The brocaded silk carpets of Kashan were already known abroad in 1601. The transfer of the Court doubtless brought about the establishment in Isfahan around 1600 of the manufactories described by Tavernier in the Maidan quarter. It is probable that the uniform style revealed by the majority of "Polonaise" carpets developed as a result of the connection with the Court in Isfahan at the beginning of the 17th century and that the finest examples, of which the carpet illustrated is one, go back to the first quarter of the century. As far as the early examples are concerned, it may be assumed that they originated towards the end of the 16th century. In 1599 Sir Anthony Sherley was presented by Shah

'Abbas I with eighteen carpets brocaded with gold.1 Those "Polonaise" carpets, where thequality of the design markedly deteriorates and the degeneration becomes obvious in the decline and rigid formalisation of individual motifs, were probably woven in the second half of the 17th century, and some unimportant examples as late as 1700. Krusinski reports that in 1722 the destruction of the Safavid empire by the Afghans put an end to the manufacture of brocaded
textiles.2 On a par with the best "Polonaise" carpets is the cope knotted entirely on silk (pi. 16), which by virtue of its form, composition and themes is marked out as a commission and is the only example of figured motifs being introduced into a "Polonaise" design. The extraordinarily refined drawing, the linear tendrils on a monochrome ground andthe brocaded detail stamp it as oneof the earliest examples, whereas the individual devices with the numerous fan-shaped miniature leaves, the palmettes, the arabesque and lanceolate leaves and the brocaded border already reflect the style typical of "Polonaise" carpets. The tendrils incorporate on thelongitudinal axis the figure of Christ on the Cross flanked by Mary and John. On the upper edge Mary onthe left hand and the Angel on the right together form a tableau of the Annunciation. Thereproduction of Biblical events is not an innovation in Persian art since some of them are also attested by the Qur'an. The Annunciation is described in terms similar to the Christian tradition, but the Crucifixion of Christ's person does not occur in the Qur'an. Moreover, the manner in which the figures on the cope are depicted is by no means Persian, unlike for instance the velvet shown on plate 34; on the contrary, the scenes correspond to a late Gothic type. It is certain therefore that this ceremonial garment was commissioned bya Christian patron who himself supplied the models for the Crucifixion and Annunciation scenes.
II. TEXTILES
Miniatures convey an impression of the wide use of the most varied fabrics. Apart from being made up into garments and turbans, fabrics were used for cushions, rugs, curtains and for tents and awnings that are apparently embroidered and often sumptuous. The garments vary

TEXTILES
from the most simple to luxurious ceremonial robes which were frequently donated by guests wishing to curry favour at court or which alternatively were bestowed as a form of decoration. Velvets and brocades were also used as light rugs and as coverlets for sarcophagi. In one source, unfortunately no earlier than the end of the 17th century, the royal workshop in Isfahan heads the list of the most important textile factories and is described as follows: "The royal weaving mill consists of various weaving shops in which silks as well as gold and silver brocades are manufactured. The director of the establishment is the Superintendent of the traders who controls and supervises the selection of patterns, the preparation of the raw materials and the storage of the completed articles. In addition he is head of all the workshops that supply the clothing needs of the royal household". The superintendent of the traders who supervised the royal weavers, dyers, tailors and silk embroiderers was at the same time
merchant and trading adviser to the King.1
Timurid fabrics
Again we are dependent upon miniatures for our knowledge of the appearance of Timurid fabrics since, as in the case of the carpets, no examples have survived which can with certainty be ascribed to this period. The garments have a very small pattern and are dotted with golden decorative motifs arranged in even rows. These devices include groups of dots, small rosettes, stars, peony blossoms, cloud-bands and ducks. Sometimes the shoulder area is adorned as though with a medallion. There is an ornamentation of this kind executed in gold embroidery on silk and set into the original garment in the Museum of
Oriental Cultures in Moscow.2 Ackerman attributes it to the 16th century, but equally it resembles the Timurid illustrations. Sometimes the embellishment of the robes consists of a border introduced at knee level and figured ornamentation on the chest and back. In addition there are robes and cushions covered in narrow stripes and pillows with a tendril pattern. Since pre-Timurid examples of silk-twill, satin, silkcloth and double cloth enriched with gilt thread have been preserved, and furthermore an amazing number of velvets and embroidered and printed fabrics dating back to the Safavid era, it can be

assumed that in the Timurid period the same techniques were in use. We donot possess any clues as to the location of the centres where Timurid fabrics were produced. There is not the slightest difference, for instance, between the fabrics depicted on the miniatures of the two most famous schools of painters, Herat and Shlraz. By comparison with the Safavid miniatures tents are less frequently reproduced. Here, as with thesaddle blankets - wedo not know whether these were knotted or tapestry-woven - the patterns of the Safavid medallion carpets are already emerging. Similarly the tent patterns onSafavid miniatures correspond toa considerable degreeto the patterns of contemporary carpets, and the same report that supplied the evidence cited above indicates that the tents were in the charge not ofthe director ofthe royal weaving mill but ofthe curator
of the royal carpets.1
Safavid fabrics
In artistic terms Persian fabrics reach their peak in the figured satins and silk velvets brocaded with precious metal of the Safavid period; in addition, however, a considerable number of outstanding silks with repeating floral patterns were manufactured atthat same period. Afew
complete garments with patterns of this kind have survived.2 From the travel journals it emerges that the towns ofKashan, Yazd, Isfahan and Tabriz were centres ofthe silk industry. The sources are in part the same as those upon which I drew in discussing the origin of the "Polonaise" carpets. In 1599 Don Juan of Persia lists in addition to Isfahan, Kashan and Yazd the towns ofQum and Sava ascentresfor
the manufacture of silks.3 Kashan is the place most frequently mentioned and Nino Jesus speaks ofsilk carpets brocaded with gilt and of "beautiful brocades andvelvets, satin andfabrics of many kinds"
which were made here.4 Olearius reports that in Kashan and Yazd fabrics adorned with figures and inscriptions were produced, while Tavernier records that the silk workers of Kashan weave themost
beautiful "gold and silver pieces" inthe whole ofPersia.5 Pietro della xValle distinguishes three sorts of silk products in Kashan: long wide sashes formen which are wound several times around the body and

into which, sometimes with and sometimes without gold, stripes and delicate leaf and flower patterns are woven; silks without brocade but embellished with inscriptions and figures such as men, women and beasts; and silks which differ from the latter solely by virtue of gold and silver brocade and which were destined entirely for women's
garments, cushions, bed curtains and similar domestic uses.1 Similarly the production of figured silks in Isfahan is attested by Raphael du
Mans,2 and I have already cited the fact that the royal weaving mill at Isfahan was responsible among other things for the clothing requirements of the royal household. Tabriz is seldom mentioned, although Chardin claims that it ranked second in importance, size, wealth, volume of trade and population and writes that it was full of artisans specialising in the manufacture of cotton, silk and gold. Here the finest turbans and six thousand bales of silk a year were produced. These statements are largely confirmed by Schillinger round about 1700; in connection with Tabriz he also singles out figured linen fine beyond all
measure.3 The difficulty of correlating the extant fabrics with these centres is, however, just as great as in the case of the carpets, and the lack of reliable criteria prevents me from drawing detailed conclusions about their provenance.
Fabrics bearing dates of manufacture are rare. Because of their predominantly epigraphic decoration two "silk compound clothes" dated 1545 and 1669 do not permit us to draw any inferences regarding floral and figured fabrics. Eight fabrics signed "Ghiyas"(e.g. pi. 18) offer a certain amount of help. Ph. Ackerman has supplied interesting biogra
phical details about Ghiyas.4 Regrettably, however, we do not know his dates. He is described as a naqshband, painter and embroiderer, he was born in Yazd, where he owned a luxurious house, and he belonged to the circle which frequented the court of Shah 'Abbas I. His name was known beyond the Persian frontiers and his fabrics were highly prized. No biographical details relevant to the problem of dating are available for other extant signatures. In the case of the figured fabrics, a stylistic comparison with miniature painting reveals a few clues which justify our assigning, for instance, various pieces influenced by the style of Riza-yi 'AbbasI (see pi. 35) to the early 17th century. We know the dates of presentation of the Madonna fabric illustrated on plate 34 which was brought to the Signoria of Venice by a Persian

embassy in 1603, and ofsome fabrics which Shah SafI I sent withan embassy toDuke Friedrich of Holstein-Gottorp in 1637 and which are
now in the Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen.1 They merely confirm the dating suggested by a comparison with contemporary miniatures. The variety of Safavid fabrics makes it impossible to examine or illustrate each kind in the present review. I shall confine my choice accordingly to a fewexamples which canjustly be described as a supreme achievement. One ofthe finest fabrics ofthe 16th century is the brocaded velvet with a red ground (pi. 17). Two staggered rows of various peris alternate on a pattern of paired scrolling tendrils with birds and whisps of cloud. The peris with two wings in the first row sit on a carpet-like platform in front ofwhich stands a flagon. The fourwinged peris inthe next row sit on thrones. The peculiar headdress of pennate leaves is already worn by peris on miniatures ascribed to the
latter half of the 15 th century and the Herat school,2 and itis also worn by the Madonna on the fabric illustrated on plate 34. Peris are celestial beings from Paradise who are depicted, for instance, accompanying Muhammad's ascension or as the retinue ofSolomon and the Queen of
Sheba.3 In a sitting position and, as on thevelvet shown here, in conjunction with scrolling tendrils, birds and whisps of cloud, they occur in the border of the Vienna hunting carpet (pi. 13); an enthroned peri forms the centre ofthe medallion ofthe woven Munich hunting
carpet,4 and furthermore they are familiar from the tapestry-woven rug on plate 14 and the border ofthe woollen knotted carpet on plate 12. To aconsiderable degree the border of the fabric corresponds in design to the outer guard-strip ofthe Vienna hunting carpet; and the pairs of fish forming a palmette occur in precisely this manner on 16th century knotted carpets. Ona miniature in a manuscript dated 1556a fabric adorned with peris serves as an awning behind Majnun's kneeling
father, and they are also seen on a camel saddle painted in 1557-5 These parallels justify the attribution of our example to the middle of the 16th century. The eight fabrics signed "Ghiyas" are among the most important silks of the middle Safavid period. With the exception of a sarcophagus

This scene appears on the brocade with a black ground illustrated on plate 18, of which several portions have been preserved. Among other things the naturalistic portrayal of the camel on which Laila is riding in a howdah attests the great skill of Ghiyas. The depictions of the camel with howdah and driver and of the poet speaking to the animals have prototypes in
miniature painting.2 The question has been raised whether Ghiyas was the designer, the weaver or the director of the workshop. In fact, there is no reason to distinguish so sharply between these functions, and it is quite possible that to a certain extent he combined all three roles. At all events he was certainly responsible for the designs of the fabric signed in his name in different styles of script. It may be assumed, however, that he did not weave them all himself but supervised their execution. With the great demand for his work it is probable that he employed assistants. We know that he lived in Yazd and it is likely that he worked there too. Nevertheless, one should not exclude the possibility of his designs having been executed in Isfahan, since after all he attended court there and could have occupied a leading position in the royal workshops. The introduction of his signature in a prominent place and its recurrence in the repeating pattern makes a rather obtrusive impression. This habit, rare in the east, of emphasising his personal identity is shared by his contemporaries at the court of Shah 'Abbas I in Isfahan, the calligrapher 'All Riza-yi 'Abbasi and the painter Riza. The latter's style influenced a series of figured fabrics such as the velvet with a metal ground in the Badisches Landesmuseum in Karlsruhe (pi. 35), fabrics which usually depict a genre scene in the repeating
pattern.3 The scene on the Karlsruhe fabric shows a youth standing in a garden with his legs lazily crossed, leaning on a stick, and, as he smells a flower,listening engrossed to an older man on his knees before him. The latter has placed his shoes on one side and in front of him there is a shallow bowl and another, unidentifiable object. This figure has been unconvincingly interpreted as a beggar. E. Kiihnel describes him as a dervish. The influence of Riza-yi 'Abbasi is seen in the attitude of the figures, the delicate pleating of their garments and the large, loosely sketched turban.

The brocaded silk velvet onplate 34 is closely related to the Karlsruhe fabric. In addition to itshistory, it is interesting forthe unusual theme ofthe scenes it incorporates, forhere, in contrast tothe copeon plate 16 where the groups of figures are copied from a foreign model, the Biblical event of Christ's Nativity is depicted according to the Oriental tradition and in a purely Safavid style. E. Kiihnel has produced a study of Christian motifs in Persian miniatures, in which he discusses these problems of iconography. The Nativity is also described in the Qur'an, but it differs from the Biblical account inasmuch as Mary gives birth toJesus insolitude under a date palm and the Lord causesa rivulet to flow ather feet inorder that she might be refreshed (sura xix. 24-7). In connection with this theme, which he notes is very rarely treated, Kiihnel reproduces two 16th-century miniatures, and
Stchoukine another dating from thebeginning of the 17th century.1 On the fabric the palm tree isreplaced by a flowering shrub which with the bird perched upon it is very similar tothe bushes onthe Karlsruhe velvet, where indeed the spring with the fish also recurs. Mary is nursing the baby Jesus and both are adorned with the flaming haloof holiness. The figure facing this group and holding a cloth in readiness does notbelong to the Nativity scene as described in theQur'an and cannot therefore be explained by reference to the account we find there. The fabrics influenced by Riza-yi 'AbbasI, paintings andthe "Polonaise" carpets represent in equal measure the courtly styleencouraged by Shah 'Abbas I at the beginning ofthe 17th century.
Public collections oforiental carpets and fabrics
In Europe the most important collection is that ofthe Osterreichisches Museum fur angewandte Kunst in Vienna. Then comes the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The once exemplary collection inBerlin was badly hit by extensive wartime losses. The remaining piecesare now housed in the Islamisches Museum (East Berlin) and the Museum fur Islamische Kunst, Stiftung Preuss. Kulturbesitz (West Berlin).

CHAPTER I 5{a)
TIMURID ARCHITECTURE
INTRODUCTION
The architectural achievements surveyed in this chapter range over four hundred years ofPersian history. The first half ofour periodwas one of constant shifts in political power accompanied by changing frontiers. Only in thesecond half did Persia obtain some measure of security under a single political authority. The story opens with the architectural style associated with the Tl-Khans and its development in western andsouthern Persia under thesuccessor dynasties. It was this style which wastransferred to Transoxiana in the last quarter of the 8th/14th century. Thepart played by Tlmur and hishouse is crucial to thestory inasmuch astheirs wasthe principal building effort, first in Transoxiana and then in eastern Persia — centres of Timurid power. With thepolitical decline of the Timurids in themiddle of the 9th/15 th century, the initiative in architecture returned to western Persia under the patronage of the Turkmen dynasties. Thanks to Shah Isma'Il andhis successors, the strands were drawn together and a homogeneous style wascreated anddisseminated throughout the Safavid kingdom. Initiative inpublic works was with members ofthe royal houseand the high officers of state: many civic undertakings were dueto the enterprise oflocal dignitaries. Thereligious was themost powerful of motives: for atleast inthe first half ofour period it isonly thereligious foundations which survive. Apart from the public and private mosque, the madrasa and kbangah, the principal effort wasconcentrated on the embellishment ofthe great shrines — above all, those ofthe Imam Ridaat Mashhad and ofShaikh SafI at Ardabll. There is, too, asin the previous period, a preoccupation with funerary architecture. Of the builders themselves, we have an imperfect knowledge. It would seem that western and southern Persia were the source ofthe greatest architectural talent; andthe only architect whose surviving work is sufficient to establish him asa potent creative artist with adistinctive style is Qivam al-Dln, a native of Shiraz. The surviving monuments arebuta partial index of the taste and aspirations ofthe period. With the exception ofthe most famous, many

INTRODUCTION
important monuments still await detailed and scientific study. The only secular buildings ofany significance earlier than the Safavid period to have survived are a few caravansarais. There is scarcely a trace of palace architecture. There were monuments standing until a century ago which have since disappeared through wanton destruction or neglect. Natural causes, too, have taken their toll; and it is ironical that earlier buildings have survived earthquakes which reduced those of the Timurid period and later toruins. These later buildings, conceivedon a larger and more ambitious scale, lacked the structural solidity ofan earlier age. Thus anysurvey at thepresent time is provisionaland subject to alteration as further study leads to deeper understanding. This would apply particularly to thesocial and functional aspects of Persian architecture. The most striking feature is the continuity of development. There was no sudden change ofdirection such asoccurred in the West, where a revived interpretation ofthe classical tradition produced a wholly new approach to architectural forms. Building materials continued to be bricks, whether baked or unbaked, and timber. Stone was used sparingly. The characteristic arch is pointed, struck generally from four or three centres; from two centres only rarely. The round or segmental arch is scarcely used at all. Dome profiles are elliptical or struck from three or four centres: thebulbous dome is developed in our period. The articulation ofthe facade isachieved by introducing blind arcades, recessed panels and pilasters. Experiment and innovation were directed to the handling offormal relationships within the accepted canons. The principal preoccupations were, on the onehand, spaceand formal relationships and, on the other hand, decoration. Increased internal space was made possible by developing new vaulting systems. Much thought was concentrated on relating thedome to the other components, more particularly, the aivan with orwithout its attendant screen and minarets. It isinthe nature ofthe great religious buildings that the architectural aspect is developed within theconfining walls: thus the monumental portal (ptshtdq)became the preponderant feature of the exterior fac,ade. On the whole it was the smaller and more compact buildings, such as themausoleum and palace kiosk, which were conceived as free standing monuments demanding a logical relationship between exterior and interior. Butthemost significant developments were in decoration. In our period there is an increasing tendency to conceal structural features beneath an overlay which super

ficially appears to have structural function but, in fact, more often than notis purely ornamental. Such are the muqarnas (superposed rows of prism-shaped elements inbrick, plaster or wood, either covering the curved surface ofa vault oracting as a cornice, andsometimes called stalactite decoration) and the complex network of ribs used to convert the square to thecircle. But it is polychrome surface decoration which gives to Persian architecture of the period itsunique character. Glazed ceramic tiles, applied tothe wall surface inavariety oftechniques, were the principal medium of decoration; gilding and painting were also used, but, vulnerable as they were to time and weather, surviving examples are rare. The three-dimensional effects of the earlier period were less andless sought after. Deeply carved and painted stucco was gradually abandoned. The interior of the mausoleum of the Imamzada Khwaja 'Imad al-Din at Qum, built in 1390, is entirely covered in polychrome plaster. Itis a tourde force on thepart of the carver but its
style isalready archaic.1 Aquite different technique of plaster decoration was introduced in the 15 th century. The current style of decoration was rendered invery low relief in plaster which was then painted and gilded.
I. THE MUZAFFARID STYLE
The death ofSultan Abu Sa'Id in 7 3 6/13 3 5spelt the virtual dissolution of Il-Khanid power. From then until thecoming of TTmur, Persiawas dominated by theJalayirids in Iraq and Azarbaijan, theMuzaffarids in Fars, Kirman and Isfahan and the Kart dynasty in Khurasan. The Il-Khanid style had been created inthe first three decades ofthe century; and is represented by two remarkable monuments, themausoleum of Oljeitii Khudabanda at Sultaniyya and theGreat Mosque ofVaramln. The major monuments in the period ofthe Mongol succession states are remarkably few. The outstanding ones are to be found in western and southern Persia and are associated with the Muzaffarid rulers. That there are no examples of thebuildings raised byi members of the Jalayirid house is surprising andcanin part be explained bythe devastations ^wrought by Tlmur. The contribution of this dynasty to the development of painting was crucial, but no trace remains ofthe splendid palace built
outside Tabriz by Shaikh Uvais and described indetail by Clavijo.2

THE MUZAFFARID STYLE
The development of the Muzaffarid style can be traced in the history of two notable religious buildings, the Great Mosque of Yazd and that of Kirman. The Great Mosque atVaramln, built between 1322 and 1326, had established the general plan from which subsequent public
mosques in Persia rarely deviated.1 Its exterior facade is dominated by a great arched entrance portal (pishtaq). In the middle of each of the four arched faces ofthe interior court, anaivan (an arched and vaulted niche) is introduced. Behind the aivan on the qibla side (i.e. that facing Mecca) is thesquare sanctuary chamber surmounted by a dome. Because in the ground plan these aivans can be seen as the arms of a cross, this type of mosque has been termed cruciform. The mosque at Varamln was the first in which these features were adopted at its inception. At Yazd they had to be introduced into an already existing
mosque structure.2 In 1324 Rukn al-Dln Muhammad, alocal dignitary and familiar of Sultan Abu Sa'Id, built a great square dome chamber to the north-east of this ancient mosque (pi. 19^). The double dome was supported on squinches concealed by stalactite pendentives converting the octagon to the circle. The outer dome springs from a relatively low drum; the inner is shallow and elliptical. In 13 31 an aivan was built in front of the dome chamber. The facade of the aivan consists of a lofty arched opening set inthe square-headed screen. The aivan itself extends a considerable length indepth tomeet the sanctuary chamber; and the profile of its vault reproduced that of the arch. The aivans on the other three sides of the court were never built, though it isclear enough that acruciform plan was originally intended. Some ten years after the completion of the sanctuary aivan, the great portal was built to the east of the latter (pi. 19a). This isan arched opening set in a square-headed screen crowned by paired minarets. The rear wall of the shallow opening is divided into two registers. In the lower, asquareheaded door is surmounted by an arched tympanum: in the upper is a hemispherical vault decorated with muqarnas above the two corner squinch arches. The same composition of portal and crowning minarets had already been used in the portal of the mosque at Ashtarjan near
Isfahan, which bears a dating inscription of 715/1315-16.3 The Yazd portal makes an uneasy impression by its excessive verticality. In 1362 Shah Yahya was governing Yazd in the name of his uncle,

Shah-i Shuja', second sovereign of the Muzaffarid house. It may have been at hisinstigation that hisminister, the amir Rukn al-Din Shah Hasan, built in 1367 the oratory flanking the eastern side of the sanctuary dome chamber and aivan. This hall wasprobably intended to provide additional space within the sanctuary area. Inorder to roof its great width — 8.1 metres — anovel system ofvaulting was used. Broad transverse arches were thrown at intervals from one longitudinal wall to the other and the space between each pair filled in to form a barrel vault. There is a similar oratory onthe western side of the sanctuary chamber andaivan but, while thelength is the same as that of the eastern oratory, thewidth is greater (9.37 m.). Transverse arches are again employed but are farnarrower. Atthe apex ofthe barrel-shaped infillings are small domical heads. This western oratory may have been built at theorder of the amir Rukn al-Din Shah Hasan or, as seems more likely, in 819/1414 during the reign of Shah Rukh. This system ofvaulting made it possible toroof far wider areas than hitherto. Clerestory lighting could be obtained by piercing window openings in the infilled spaces between the transverse arches.The system had already made its appearance in eastern Persia, where it was adopted in theMasjid-i Kirmanl flanking theentrance portal of the shrine complex at Turbat-i Shaikh Jam (pi. 20). This masjid has been dated by Golombek to 763/1362. Unlike theoratories in the Great Mosque at Yazd where themihrab (prayer niche) was placed on the short side, themihrab was located in themiddle of the longitudinal side which formed the qibla wall. The architect was anative ofKirman and it is likely that the transverse vault was developed in western and southern Persia, for its next occurrence wasin Isfahan when the Muzaffarid Qutb al-Din Shah Mahmud ordered the building of the
madrasa in the Masjid-i Jami' in 1366.1 This was built behind the eastern aivan ofthe mosque and consisted ofa court, long and narrow, with two storeyed arcades on its east and west sides and an aivan on the north and on the south side. Behind the south aivan is the masjid ofthe madrasa, its longitudinal axis running east-west (pi. 2 id). Itis roofed by four transverse arches running north-south, the inner pair being spaced wider apart in order to accommodate the great mihrab which is crowned byan arch at right angles to the two transverse arches. The bays on the south side flanking the mihrab show how it was possibleto

introduce clerestory lighting. Above the mihrab are two small cartouches containing the names of the architects; Shams b. Taj and Fakhr b. al-Vahhab ofShlraz the mason [al-banna)} Kirman fell to the Muzaffarids in 1340. Nine years later Mubariz
al-Dln Muhammad built there the Masjid-i Jami'.2 The plan is cruciform; the aivans are linked bysingle-storeyed arcades except on the south where they are two-storeyed. The entrance portal, square-headed with crowning minarets, leads into adome vestibule which gives onto the shallow north aivan. The sanctuary aivan on the south side is wider and deeper than the others. Coloured faience was now the accepted mode of surface decoration. Two techniques were employed often side byside; tile inlay and tile mosaic. In tile inlay, glazed polygonal elements were inlaid in the brick or terracotta surface to form patterns, the unglazed contrasting with the glazed areas. In tile mosaic, the entire surface is ofglazed faience, each separate area ofcolour being carved and fitted to its neighbour. Tile inlay was already being practised in Saljuq times. Tile mosaic appears first in Oljeitii Khudabanda's mausoleum at Sultaniyya; and was perfected in the portal facade of the mausoleum of Baba Qasim
completed in 1340.3 The tilework on the portal facade of the Great Mosque at Kirman is dated 750/1349 and has suffered much damage, although what remains is sufficient to give an impression of the original intention. The composition of the facade, logical and harmonious, was to become a standard one forsucceeding generations. The arch screen is framed onallthree sides bya broad band enclosing a naskhi inscription in white on aground of tightly involuted scrolling in light blue, all on a dark blue background. Each ofthe imposts raised on alow socle is divided into three tiers of blind arcades. The voussoir of the portal arch iscomposed ofa spirally twisted moulding which is untwisted at the two bases. The entrance door is set back within the arch, and the rectangular compartment thus formed is given a hemispherical vaulting of stalactite penditives. The tile mosaic decoration is partially preserved inthe blind arcades ofthe imposts and their framing bands. These are decorated in white, yellow and two shades of blue with elaborate interlacings developed from a central rosette orstar. The decoration of the mihrab in the Masjid-i Jami' at Yazd was

executed by Hajj Baha' al-Din Muhammad al-Husain in 1375. The tilework is far better preserved than that of the mosque portal in Kirman. The composition ofthe screen isamong the finest inPersia: an outer framing band with inscription, a narrow inner band of floral scrolling, bevelled voussoir band with a series of half-palmettes forming pendants, paired colonnettes supporting the arch. The treatment of the spandrel is of particular interest: a geometric roundel in eachof the corner angles and a circular raised boss at the apex of the arch. The naturalistically rendered floral sprays which decorate the ground of the spandrels anticipate the style of manuscript illumination executed in Shlraz in the first decade of the 9th/15 th century. The interior of the mihrab consists offivevertical faces surmounted by hemispherical stalactite vaulting. The tile mosaic panels are decorated with half palmettes arranged inthe "tree of life" design orwith star patterns radiating from acentral rosette. Intwo of the faces these panels are set in a ground executed in inlaid tilework: polygonal terracotta tiles with delicate relief designs are inlaid ininterlaced bands of turquoise tiles, a technique used in the mausoleum at Sultaniyya. It is our misfortune that so little architecture ofthe second half of the 14th century has survived inPersia. The outstanding monuments are associated with the Muzaffarid dynasty and do seem to constitute a style both in structural form as well as decoration. Itwas the architects of Shlraz and Isfahan who were to play the leading role in the development ofTimurid architecture in Transoxiana and Khurasan; and it is the migration of talent to Timur's court which may in part explain this paucity of buildings in Persia in the closing decades of the century.
II. ARCHITECTURAL FORMS UNDER TIMUR
Timur's conquest of Transoxiana was sealed in 1369 by the capture of Samarqand, which was declared the capital of the empire. Itwas Tlmur and his family who gave the impulse to the new architectural movement. The enormous scale in public works was alone made possible by the resources of the empire in artistic talent, engineering skill and material. The major monuments belong to the last ten years of Timur's reign. His earliest efforts were directed to commemorating the deceased members of his family by the building of mausolea in the complex known as the Shah-i Zinda. Today, this consists of some sixteen

buildings grouped oneither side of a narrow path which clearsthe
crest ofa hill in the north-eastern quarter of Samarqand.1 It owesits name "the Living King" to the Prophet's cousin Qutham b. 'Abbas whose shrine had long been the principal sanctuary of the city. Here as elsewhere in Islam itwas the custom to bury the dead in the vicinity of the shrine ofa saint ormartyr. The existing mausoleum ofthe Shah-i Zinda atthe northern end ofthe complex was built in735/1334-5. The Timurid mausolea are of two kinds; the domed cubical structure with a single dominating facade and a polygonal structure with dome set on ahigh drum and having an entrance on two or more of its faces. The earliest mausoleum tobe built inthe Shah-i Zinda complex during Tlmur's reign belongs tothe first type. This isthe mausoleum of Shad-i Mulk, completed in 773/1371—2 by Tlmur's sister, Terken
Aqa, for her daughter Shad-i Mulk.2 The principal emphasis ison the portal which, with its screen, forms the fagade of the mausoleum which springs from a low octagon. The dome is barely visible behind this facade. It is decorated with vertical ribs joined tangentially — a novel feature which was to be widely used in Transoxiana and Persia. Its origins have not been satisfactorily explained; and a possible connection with the stone ribbed dome current in Egypt in the 8 th/14th century has yet tobe investigated. The basic scheme of the Timurid portal facade is that already developed in Persia: the screen set ona plinth, the lofty pointed arch and the vaulted entrance embrasure. The ingenuity of architect and tile worker was applied to the organisation of architectonic detailand decoration. Inthe facade of the mausoleum ofShad-i Mulk the decoration of the surfaces of the screen andof the flanking walls of the entrance embrasure isarranged inrectangular orsquare panels. Much of the decoration consists of faience carved in relief, a technique apparently unknown in Persia (pi. zib). The designs were carved in the "biscuit" which was then glazed in turquoise or turquoise and white and fired. The technique was possibly developed from carved and painted stucco and had already been developed in Samarqand and Bukhara in the earlier 14th century. In the Shad-i Mulk facade, this technique is used not only in the impost panels but also in the engaged columns

which define the outer ends of the facade, the columns supporting the arch and the stalactite vaulting elements. Some ofthe framing bands are composed of turquoise glazed bricks laid edge above edge and the spandrel of the arch screen is decorated with sinuous leaf scrolls rendered in light relief under a turquoise glaze on adark blue ground. There is also a framing band consisting of tiny square elements of white, turquoise and light blue faience arranged to form aseries of star figures. This is the "inset" technique rather than mosaic inlay which requires that the elements should interlock. True mosaic tilework first appears inSamarqand inthe mausoleum of Shlrln Bika Aqa, another sister of Tlmur. This was built in 787/
1385—6.1 It, too, is a fac,ade mausoleum butits exterior treatment differs from that of the mausoleum ofShad-i Mulk in that the domeis slightly bulbous and rests on a sixteen-sided drum. The polygonal drum occurs intwo other mausolea in the Shah-i Zinda complex built in the 1380s. The most significant feature of the mausoleum is its portal decoration which isexecuted entirely intile mosaic. The decoration is developed above the plinth and consists of vertical panels. The arch of the entrance embrasure is supported on engaged columns, and within the embrasure there are framing bands around the arched entrance door and stalactite vaulting within the portal arch (pi. 22a). The motifs are floral: symmetrically disposed arabesques in the vertical panels and framing bands. Within the tympanum above the arched entrance door are floral arabesques developed about a large rosette in each of the spandrels. The external niches onthe sixteen faces of the drum still have traces of tile mosaic decoration. The drum itself was decorated with a network of lozenge-shaped compartments in inlays of coloured bricks. The interior of the mausoleum is painted in red, blue and black except for panels ofsquare green tiles and light blue hexagonal tiles, the latter painted in gold with phoenixes — a rare example of "Chinoiserie" atthis date. The tile mosaic decoration on the facade of this mausoleum is related to that on the mihrab of the Masjid-i Jami' at Yazd and it seems probable that the technique was introduced toSamarqand by migrant tileworkers from Persia. The facade of the mausoleum of Tuman Aqa, wife ofTTmur, who completed it inher lifetime in 1405, is decorated with tile mosaic designs closely resembling that ofthe mausoleum of

Shlrin Blka: and it is noteworthy that they arethework of Shaikh
Muhammad b. Khwaja Beg ofTabriz.1 The mausolea so far described belong to the first type of mausoleum in which the dominant external feature is the portal facade. Its form was no doubt determined by its siting in relation to other adjacent buildings. The laying out of buildings along athoroughfare demanded a series of imposing facades since these would be theonly visible features from-the road. The second type ofmausoleum — a polygonal structure, either square oroctagonal with an entrance on two ormore of its faces and a dome springing from a high cylindrical drum — was evidently intended as afree standing monument visible on two or more sides. There are examples of this type inthe Shah-i Zinda but the most famous in Samarqand is the Gvir-i Mir which contains the tombs of Tlmur andother members of his dynasty. It was built by Tlmur between 1403 and 1404to commemorate his grandson, Mirza
Muhammad Sultan b. Muhammad Jahanglr who died in 805/1403.2It was an addition toan already existing complex of buildings erected by Muhammad Sultan at theclose of the 14th century. These were a madrasa and khangah which stood tothe north-east and north-west of the Gur-i Mir, separated by a square court. The mausoleum is octagonal in plan. The dominating feature is the bulbous dome setonthe tall cylindrical drum (pi. zzb). With its great ribs each joined toits neighbour tangentially and appearing to rise from the stalactite corbelling of the cornice, itis astriking and bold conception. Ribs, stalactite cornice and the upper band around the drum are decorated with tile inlays of black and yellow lozenge figures on a turquoise ground. The drum is decorated with glazed and unglazed bricks arranged in zones of geometric patterns above a broad band of Kufic. The interior is square with a projecting bayon each side. The transition from the square to the circle is achieved by the imposition of eight ribbed arches between the squinch arches and those ofthe four projecting bays. The resulting sixteen-sided cornice forms the base for the inner dome. The decoration of the interior is unexpectedly austere. There is a dado ofhexagonal alabaster plaques framed by a guilloche moulding and above this an inscribed band of greenish grey jasper. The upper register of the walls andthesurface of the dome were

originally decorated with patterns in gilded paper raised in relief. The cenotaphs, including the great jade slab commemorating Timur, are surrounded by alow marble balustrade consisting of exquisitely carved flower sprays and formal arabesques with low spirally twisted columns securing the balustrade to the floor. The actual interments are inthe crypt. The double dome was anestablished system in Persia in the 14th century. Ifa single dome is raised to an inordinate height, the proportions ofthe interior space are impaired. The shallow inner dome was the solution of this problem. In the Gur-i Mir the height of the ceiling dome is 22.5 m.and ofthe exterior dome 34.09 m. The system also made possible the development ofthe bulbous dome since the inner gave some measure ofsupport tothe outer. The transition from the square to the circle by the means of a sixteen-sided figure had the great advantage of reducing the transitional zone to a single register. The mausolea ofthe Shah-i Zinda are relatively modest structures. The Gur-i Mir must have been the crowning feature of the madrasa and khangah of which it was anadjunct. An example of a far more ambitious treatment ofthe funerary monument is the ma^ar (pilgrim
shrine) of Ahmad Yasavi in Turkistan city built in 799/1396-7.1 This is a highly complex building designed to provide for the manifold needs of those responsible for the saint's shrine, and incorporating a masjid, library and cells ofa khangah and a kitchen. Its plan iscruciform and centres on a great dome chamber (fig. 1). On the longitudinal axis are the deep portal aivan tothe north and domed tomb chamber to the south. The remaining rooms are disposed onthe east-west axis and within the four arms of the cross. The north elevation is dominated by the great portal aivan and the two flanking towers with polygonal bases. On either side ofthis portal are upper storeys. The principal feature of the south elevation is theportal of the mausoleum surmounted by a ribbed dome raised on a high cylindrical drum (pi. 23). Its form together with its stalactite cornice and glazed brick decoration resembles that of the Gur-i Mir. The roofing of certain of the rooms is by means of transverse arches - the same system employed in the oratories of the Great Mosque at Yazd and in the masjid of the madrasa in the Masjid-i Jami', Isfahan. This is the first occurrence of the system in Transoxiana and was almost certainly introduced from Persia, since

we know that the architect of the mausoleum of Ahmad Yasavl was Khwaja Hasan of Shiraz, who may have been brought to Samarqand soon after Tlmur's conquest of that city in 795/i393. One aspect of the mazar of Ahmad Yasavl is indicative of the aspirations of the new style. In the exterior, the principal emphasis is on the main portal facade which dominates the great mass by its sheer weight and size. The arch screen seems to overlap the apex of the great dome itself; and the flanking minarets bonded with the outer edges of the screen suggest fortification. The manner in which the arched vault rises above the screen is adisturbing feature and ithas to be assumed that this facade was never completed. It is unfortunate that there is no trace of polychrome revetment — if it ever existed. The formula of the deep aivan with flanking towers could be applied equally well to secular architecture. It was evidently a feature of the great palace known as the Aq Saral which Timur began tobuildin
about 1384 at Kish, the city of his birth.1 Renamed Shahr-i Sabz in the 14th century, Kish is situated about fifty miles south of Samarqand on the road leading to Tirmiz on the Oxus. The palace was still being built

when Clavijo visited the city in 1404. His description gives afairly clear
idea of the layout.1 A high portal aivan flanked byrooms led into a great court with its longitudinal axis running atright angles to that of the entrance portal. Opposite the latter was a vast aivan flanked by towers with polygonal bases. According to Babur, this wasflankedby
two smaller aivans.2 There was probably an aivan in the centre of each of the other three sides of the court; and these were joined by twostoreyed arcades. Behind the principal aivan lay the great audience hall, probably square and surmounted by a dome. Surrounding this audience hall were lesser rooms to a height of six storeys. All that remains of the Aq Saral today isa part ofthe great aivan portal. The aivan is flanked by towers with polygonal bases. The interior of the aivan is 22 m. wide and 12.6 m. deep; the side walls survive only as far asthe springing of the aivan arch of which the height has been calculated as about 40 m. From the apex of the archto the top of the screen would have been about one-third of the height of the arch. The flanking towers would have projected one-third ofthe height of the arch above the top of the screen. These dimensions give some idea of the scale of the palace. The decoration of the flanking towers is executed in glazed bricks of two shades of blue and white: geometric patterns onthe polygonal facets and Kufic seal characters arranged in diagonal patterns on the cylindrical surface. Panels ofgeometric ornament between inscribed bands frame thearch imposts. The interior walls of the aivanare decorated with hexagonal painted tiles; while the vaulting is ornamented with glazed brick inlays similar to the towers. One of the inscription bands bears the date 798/1395—6. In the middle of the back wall of the aivan interior is an opening into a smaller room flanked by engaged columns which certainly supported an arch. The columns consist of four spirally twisted mouldings which rise from a decorated base. These columns are also revetted with glazed tiles. The walls of the inner room are decorated with mosaic tilework which inconception and perfection oftechnique exceeds any ofthe tile mosaic inthe mausolea of the Shah-i Zinda. The ruined portal of the Aq Sara! at Shahr-i Sabz gives a tantalising glimpse ofthe new style which must have received the initial impulse from Tlmur himself. Unquestionably hisgreatest monument is the

Great Mosque which he began to build in Samarqand in 801/1399.1 It was intended as the Masjid-i Jaml' of Samarqand and the current name "Mosque of Bibl Khanum" seems to have been applied to it from a confusion with the madrasa erected in the name of Tlmur's wife. Of this madrasa no trace remains but we know that both the mosque and the madrasa stood within the walls of the city near the Iron Gate and that Tlmur built a great bazaar street leading from the open space in front of the two buildings to what was later to become the Rlgistan. At each outside corner of the mosque was a minaret (fig. 2). The entrance portal on the north facade was a vaulted aivan with cylindrical flanking minarets. This led into the rectangular court. In the centre of each side was an aivan. Parallel to the north, west and east sides were four galleries behind the arcades of the court. These galleries consisted of rows of columns of which every four supported a shallow dome. On the south side, there were nine galleries. Behind the aivans on the west and east sides were dome chambers. The sanctuary aivan was nearly twice as wide as the others and was flanked by minarets hexagonal in section. The height of the aivan arch was 30.66 m. and of the aivan screen, 40.88 m.; the crowns of the minarets probably projected more than 10 m. above the aivan screen.
There are two dating inscriptions: 801/1398 in the sanctuary dome chamber and 808/1405 on the entrance portal. Thus we may suppose that the work was completed with the building of the main facade. The scale of the mosque is without parallel in either Iran or Transoxiana. Certain salient features require mention. The vertical effect was achieved by the eight minarets and by the great height of the sanctuary aivan screen behind which the sanctuary dome was invisible from the court. The height of the screen was further accentuated by the singlestorey arcades around the court. The domes in the centre of the east and west sides are set on high cylindrical drums and projected far above their respective aivan screens which were considerably lower than that of the sanctuary. The polygonal flanking minarets of the sanctuary portal, which resemble those of the portal of the Aq Saral at Shahr-i Sabz, were to find their way into the mosque architecture of Iran as, too, were the dome chambers of the lesser aivans and the corner minarets. While the aivan screens and domed structures were of brick, the vaulting as well as the columns were constructed of stone.

ARCHITECTURAL FORMS UNDER TIMUR
The employment of stone in Timurid Samarqand is noteworthy, for even in Iran during the Safavid period stone and marble were used sparingly, principally for flooring and lower revetments, apart of course from foundation courses which were invariably of stone. The feature was sufficiently unusual to elicit thenotice of Babur, who recalls a passage from the Zafar-nama of Sharaf al-Dln 'All Yazdl according to which, when Tlmur was building the Sangln ("stone") mosque, there were stone-cutters ofAzarbaljan, Fars, Hindustan and other countries
to the number of two hundred.1 No madrasa has survived that can be associated with Tlmur; but the madrasa of Ulugh Beg in Samarqand, built between 1417 and 1420, can
indicate how the new style was adapted tothis type of building.2 Since the principal function ofthe madrasa was teaching, the fixed requirements were living quarters, lecture rooms andprayer hall. In the madrasa of Ulugh Beg thecourt is laid out on a four-aivan plan. The living quarters were arranged intwo storeys between the aivans, although the upper storey has since been destroyed. There isa domed lecture hall ineach ofthe four corners ofthe madrasa and on the side opposite the entrance portal and behind the aivan along prayer gallery with its main axis parallel tothe wall. There isa minaret ateach ofthe four outside corners ofthe madrasa, but the wide portal screen has no flanking minarets. This portal dominates the north-eastern face ofthe madrasa: the width ofthe opening isone-third ofthe whole lengthof the latter. The entire archivolt of the aivan arch is provided with a cable moulding asin the inner entrance door of the portal of the Aq Sarai; and each cable is faced with "cuerda seca" tiles. The minarets are decorated in glazed brick inlays with diaper patterns of Kufic seal inscriptions, and geometric glazed brick inlays form the principal decoration of the aivan screen except for thespandrels of the arch where there are still traces ofmosaic inlay. The rear wall ofthe portal aivan consists of an arched entrance leading through a vestibule into the court and is flanked by two tiers of arched niches. It is in the entrance vestibule that the decorator concentrated his main effort. Here are panels of mosaic inlay as well as terracotta relief tiles inset with tile mosaic, astyle of revetment already noted in the mihrab of the Masjid-i Jami' at Yazd.

TIMURID ARCHITECTURE
What conclusions may we draw from these examples of architectural practice by the first generation ofTimurid architects? Most striking, of course, isthe scale of the great monuments, which is unknown in Persia at this period. The principal forms and structural detail, however, are those of Persia. In theexterior facade, the portal entrance was the principal concern. For those of lesser buildings atall and narrow arched embrasure wasused and wasoften given a hemispherical vault of stalactite corbels. Inthe great buildings, the portal was asalient formed by a great rectangular screen inwhich the arched embrasure was wider and the arch sharper in relation to the height than in the portals of lesser buildings. Wall surfaces continued to bearticulated byarched niches, open or blind. Arch profiles are pointed although there is some variation in form. In decoration, tile mosaic and inset tilework seem closely related tothe style which was already developed in Persia. There arecertain innovations. The ribbed dome with a cornice of stalactite corbelling just below its springing seems to have been invented by thearchitects of Transoxiana. The high drum, too, was developed probably as afeature ofthe "free standing" monument. We have noticed, too, the combination of aivan screen and flanking minarets, the latter in certain cases being given polygonal bases. The squinch arch continued to bethe system of effecting the transition of the square to the circle, but greater refinement was achieved by introducing ribbed arches between the shoulders ofthe eight arches of the octagon. Carved faience was apparently atechnique developed inTransoxiana but had gone out offashion by the end ofthe 14th century. It looks on present evidence as if the technique ofpainted tiles was an invention of Transoxiana; and it anticipates by two centuries its use on a large scale in Persia. Scholars of the USSR have analysed in great detail many of the monuments of Uzbekistan andTurkmenistan and, as a result, have been able to establish that the buildings discussed above were planned in accordance with a system of proportions. Designs were laid out on a grid based on a predetermined module. This practical application of mathematical knowledge isnot surprising inan age in which the exact sciences were so highly esteemed; and itis revealing that the mathematical treatise Miftdh al-hisab, which Ghiyas al-Dln Jamshld of Kashan dedicated toUlugh Beg in 830/1427, included a chapter on the theoretical construction ofarches.

THE ERA OF SHAH RUKH
III. THE ERA OF SHAH RUKH
Shah Rukh, who succeeded tothe empire on his father's death in1405, had been governor of Khurasan since 799/1396—7. Herat remained the seat of government until his death in 850/1447. Khurasan wasthus drawn into the cultural renaissance that was taking place in Transoxiana. Thanks tothe patronage of Shah Rukh and his consort Gauhar Shad the newarchitectural style was introduced into eastern Persia, where it was reinterpreted and developed by a younger generation of architects. Theimpact on Khurasan is particularly striking. It is a curious fact that although thecruciform plan, that is, a court with a central aivan ineach ofits four sides, was adopted indomestic architecture and as a form ofcaravansarai and possibly of madrasa, it was only in western Iran that the cruciform plan was incorporated inthe mosque and combined with the sanctuary dome chamber. The earliest example is the Masjid-i Jami' at Zavara dated 5 30/113 5-6. The known mosques of Khurasan, however, are generally based on the two-aivan plan,the sanctuary aivan being opposed by an aivan on the north side. Such was the plan ofthe mosque at Furumad (probably 1 3 th century) and ofthe
mosque at Zauzan (616/1219).1
It was due to the initiative of Gauhar Shad that the first cruciform mosque was introduced into Khurasan. The mosque of Gauhar Shad in theshrine of the Imam Rida at Mashhad bears theimpress of the
style of Transoxiana.2 According to the framing inscription of the sanctuary aivan which Balsunqur himself designed, thebuilding was completed in 821/1418-19 by themunificence of his mother Gauhar Shad. Another inscription atthe end ofBalsunqur's inscription records that the architect was Qivam al-DIn Zain al-Dln ofShlraz (pi. 24b).The
word used here for architect is tayjan ("mason").3 Qivam al-Dln of Shlraz is known to have been the leading architect at the court of Shah
Rukh.4 Daulatshah describes him as one of the four luminaries of the court and asone learned in mathematics, drawing and building. From another source, we know that he was versed in astrology. He must have joined thecourt before 1410, for in that year he built for Shah Rukh amadrasa and khangah in Herat, of which neither has survived.
Gauhar Shad's mosque is built on the south side of the central core

of the shrine and has,therefore, no entrance portal. The court, 55m. long and45 m. wide, ispierced on each side by an aivan. The sanctuary aivan on the south side is perceptibly wider than the others (pi. 24a). Between theaivans aretwo-storeyed arcades with galleries in therear three on the east and west sides and seven on the sanctuary side. The dominant feature is the great south aivan arch flanked by cylindrical minarets with polygonal facets of marble around thebases. There is no screen between the domed sanctuary chamber and the aivan as inthe Blbl Khanum mosque; the transition iseffected by an inner nested arch. Within the chamber, the inner dome is set on four massive piers by means of stalactite net pendentives which provide a sixteen-sided seating for the circle of the dome. The mihrab is in arectangular area set back from the dome chamber; and this additional chamber has a hemispherical vaulting of stalactites. The outer dome, revetted in turquoise tiles with aband of Kufic in black at its bulge, has a steep curvature and stands ona lowdrum. Thetransitional zone is concealed by arather obtrusive four-sided structure, its three visible faces being divided into two-storeyed blind arcades. From the court the dome is barely visible behind the aivan screen.
European travellers have been unanimous in praising the sumptuous polychrome tile decoration ofthe court. Much of the tilework has undergone extensive restoration and a thoroughgoing analysis is
required in order to realise Qivam al-Dln's intention.1 Mosaic tilework was used for spandrel decoration and framing inscriptions: larger surfaces were ornamented with geometric designs executed in glazed and unglazed bricks. Anewtechnique, however, wasemployed inthe intrados of the arches ofthe sanctuary andnorth-east aivans: polygonal tiles were arranged to form star patterns with raised and interlaced framing bands of marble (pi.2 <,a). This useof tile decoration will occur again in Herat.
From 1417 to 1438, Qivam al-Dln wascollaborating in the building
of the Musalla of Gauhar Shad to thenorth of the city of Herat.2 Both this and the madrasa ofSultan Husain Balqara Mirza were almost entirely destroyed in 1885 by order of the amir 'Abd al-Rahman, who
1 Godard, in AI vm, 11, mentions extensive repairs carried out in the mosque in 1087/1676-7. These included the rilling inof many ofthe arcades flanking the sanctuary aivan as well as the addition of the parapet in order to counteract the outward thrust of the aivan arch. Perhaps, too, some of the tilework dates from this period.

thought that the buildings might provide cover for an invading Russian army. Fortunately we have detailed descriptions ofthe Musalla. It comprised a mosque and madrasa. The term musalla was applied to a mosque located outside the walls of a city where the citizens and inhabitants of the outlying districts congregatedforthe great religious festivals. Gauhar Shad's mosque in theMusalla was unusually large inasmuch as it was designed to accommodate such a congregation on the Feast ofSacrifices (Qurban bairam) and the Feastat the breaking of the fast in Ramadan ('Idal-fitr). It was alarge rectangular enclosure 106 m. by 64 m., with a minaret on an octagonal baseat each corner. The inner court, 5 2 m. by 49 m., consisted of two-storeyed arcades and anaivan in the centre ofeach side. The sanctuary aivan, however, was flanked bytwo smaller aivans, a composition recalling that of the great aivan of the AqSaral at Shahr-i Sabz. Anunusual feature was the addition ofa smaller dome chamber behind the sanctuary dome chamber. The entrance portal on the north-eastern side was as high as the sanctuary aivan.
All that remains of the mosque today is a single minaret. These minarets must have been of great beauty. The angle of taper results from the diameter of the crown being half that of the base: the heightis eight times the diameter of the base. The polygonal faces of the base were articulated by square and rectangular panels. Incorporated in these were stone panels carved in relief with intricately interlaced Kufic lettering on a ground of sinuous scrolling. The cylindrical surface above the polygonal base was entirely covered with bands of tilework and varying widths divided into three-fold divisions by three stalactite cornices. The principal bands are decorated with a network ofmosaic tiles in theform of eight-pointed stars framed by a narrow marble moulding asinthe court ofGauhar Shad's mosque at Mashhad. This elaborate surface embellishment of the minaret is an innovation, for the characteristic treatment in southern Persia aswell as in Transoxiana was the insetting of glazed brick in the unglazed brick surface in the form ofgeometric designs often arranged in aspiral movement.
We do not know what part, ifany, Qivam al-Dln took inthe building of this mosque; but that he was responsible for the construction of the madrasa which lies to the north of the mosque, and which was
completed in 1432, we know from 'Abd al-Razzaq Samarqandl.1 This

was constructed on the cruciform aivan plan, the principal facade with its vaulted entrance hall being flanked by corner minarets. The sanctuary aivan was extended in depth to the qibla wall and the mihrab itself was contained ina further rectangular chamber which projected from the wall. In each of the corners flanking the sanctuary aivan was a dome chamber, an arrangement already encountered in the madrasas of Transoxiana where similarly placed dome chambers performed the function of darskhana (lecture room). All that remains of this madrasa is the east minaret and the right hand, that is, the western, dome chamber (pi. 25^). The latter is known as the mausoleum of Balsunqur, who was
the first of his house to be buried there, in 836/1433.J Its external aspect resembles in certain respects that of the Gur-i Mir: the ribbed bulbous dome issupported on ahigh drum which rises from the cubical structure with no visible transitional zone. The ribs, however, are not joined tangentially as inthe Gur-i Mir but are separated by bands of turquoise tiling. The ribs are revetted with square orrectangular tiles of black, white, red and two shades of blue arranged in diaper.Of particular interest isthe extensive use of painted tiles: in the fine band of Kufic which appears to bind the base of the ribs to the dome, as well as in the stalactite corbelling and the vertical panels immediately below. The drum is lower than that ofthe Gur-i Mir, which probably required this additional emphasis.
The most striking feature, however, is the vaulting system of the interior, which must rank as amasterpiece of Muslim engineering skill (pi. 26). Inthe centre of each side ofthe square interior is an arched recess with a width of 4.5 m. The diameter of the dome is the same as the width of the recess. This is because the dome is supported on four great arches which spring from the forward edge of the recess arches, each^adjacent pair intersecting to form the square. Secondary ribs spring from the haunches of the arches and effect the transition to the octagon by a series of "kite"-shaped pendentives which are so characteristic of Timurid and subsequent architecture. Above the octagon, sixteen fan-shaped pendentives complete the transition to the ceiling dome (pi. 27). The apex of each pendentive is decorated with stalactites either in relief or painted inblue, red and brown. This techniqueof intersecting vaulting arches was first employed in Samarqand. It had

THE ERA OF SHAH RUKH
the practical advantage of providing the structure with added strength to withstand earthquake; and quite asimportantly, it had a powerful effect in theorganising of the interior space. Instead of the clearly defined transitional zones of the squinch system, it produced asense of upward motion bymeans of the tense rhythm of arch, rib and kite pendentive. The attribution ofthe mausoleum to Qivam al-Dln is founded not only on the statement of 'Abd al-Razzaq but also on its stylistic similarities with theonly other remaining work that can be assigned with certainty to themaster. This is theMadrasa Ghiyasiyya at Khargird
near Khwaf in Khurasan.1 The building was still unfinished when Qivam al-Dln died in 1438 and according to theinscription it was completed by his associate Ghiyas al-Dln ofShiraz in 1444. According to the portal inscription it was erected under the patronage of Shah Rukh's minister Ahmad b. Ishaq and of Fakhr al-Dln of Khwaf in 848/1444-5.
The Madrasa Ghiyasiyya is among the earliest madrasas in Persia. The Muzaffarid madrasa in the Masjid-i Jami', Isfahan, was incorporated ina larger building. The Madrasa-yi ImamI in Isfahan was built probably in 1325 and is designed on acruciform plan; but is a relatively modest structure. The madrasa atKhargird, on the contrary, although small by the standards of the madrasas of Transoxiana, was designed to fulfil all the requirements of the madrasa as it had developed in Samarqand and Bukhara: living rooms, lecture room (darskhana) and masjid. The madrasa forms arectangle 92 x 56 m. with an inner court 28 m. square (fig. 3). An aivan on each side results ina cruciform plan. Each aivan is flanked by two arcades in two storeys: andeach corner is "champfered" and provided with a two-storeyed arcade. At each corner of the rectangle is adome chamber and on the north side behind the main facade is anarthex consisting of a domed vestibuleflankedby two large dome chambers. The principal facade is dominated by the slightly projecting aivan portal (plshtaq) which is flanked by triple arcades of which the central ones give access to the respective dome chambers. The facade is completed at each end by atower, octagonalat the base. The spatial organisation of the narthex is a wonderful unity of

design. The three dome chambers are joined by barrel-vaulted corridors of varying width. Of special interest are the two larger dome chambers each with a distinctive form of vaulting. That on the right, i.e., the northern dome chamber, is square with projecting niches on each side. The transition to the octagon is by means of squinches, the crowns being level with those of the niche arches. Above the octagon, stalactites effect the transition to a sixteen-side polygon. On this are set an inner and an outer row of eight piers which provide the seating for the inner and outer domes respectively. The system of vaulting adopted in the left hand dome chamber is that of the mausoleum of Balsunqur in Herat (pi. 28, fig. 4). By means of intersecting arches which spring from the sides of the terminal niches, the diameter of the dome is reduced to the width of the latter. Subsidiary ribs form the characteristic "kite" pendentives just as in the mausoleum of Balsunqur. The work thus bears the unmistakable stamp of Qivam al-Din. The Madrasa Ghiyasiyya served the Shafi'I rite and with its twenty

cells is modest by the standards of Transoxiana. Diez, who published a detailed description of the madrasa, has drawn attention to the determining effect of seasonal climate on function. As in domestic buildings, so in this madrasa distinct parts of the complex were appropriated for winter and for summer use. Those on the northern side were for summer, those on the southern for winter. This factor would account, too, for the difference in the vaulting systems of the two dome chambers in the vestibule, the smaller dimensions of the dome of

the left hand one providing some measure of protection from the rigours of the cold. Much of the building effort in the reign of Shah Rukh was directed to the architectural development of the shrine complex. Gauhar Shad's mosque at Mashhad was introduced into apre-existing group of buildings centred on the domed mausoleum where were interred the remains of the Eighth Imam. Other shrine complexes in Khurasan developed around the grave of the saint which remained, however,in the open and without architectural covering. Perhaps this practice was determined by a literal adherence to the Islamic proscription of elaborate funerary monuments. Nevertheless, no scruples seem to have prevented the embellishment of such shrines by the construction of pious foundations and adjuncts in proximity to the saint's grave. The most important of such shrine complexes is that of the eleventh century saint, Khwaja 'Abd-Allah Ansari in the village ofGazur Gah on the northern outskirts of Herat. This shrine has been the subject of a penetrating study byL. Golombek, who has contributed not only a masterly analysis of the structure but also an illuminating commentary on the religious function. She suggests that the shrine at Gazur Gah is a ha^tra.This term ("fenced enclosure") would properly refer to the tomb enclosure of the saint set ona raised platform and surrounded by a balustrade of wood or stone, but in the Timurid period was extended to cover all the subsidiary buildings necessary for the functioning of a great shrine complex of which the central feature was the hazira proper. The great rectangular building which forms the shrine ofthe saint was built by Shah Rukh in 1425. The western and principal facade, with its vaulted entrance aivan flanked by blind arcades and terminal towers octagonal in section, anticipates that of the madrasa atKhargird. The plshtaq leads into a vaulted vestibule flanked by two rooms roofed by transverse vaults, the one a masjid, the other anassembly hall. The inner court is organised on the cruciform aivan plan with lofty arcades flanking the aivans onthe north, south and west sides. The saint's grave stands in front of the great western aivan which is both taller and wider than the other aivans. Above the apex of the arch, the screenis pierced with a gallery of five arcades and surmounted ateach end bya lantern turret. One curious feature is that while to the west of the aivans on the north and south sides there are vaulted rooms behind the arcaded facade, tothe east ofthe aivans the latter is merely a curtain wall. Golombek has suggested that this, together with the great aivan,
752



THE ERA OF SHAH RUKH
was designed to give definition to the whole east end ofthe court as the hazlra. Some ofthese features are tobe found at Turbat-i Shaikh Jam half
way between Mashhad andHerat, another great shrine complex.1 But while Gazur Gah was a single creation, Turbat-i ShaikhJam developed from the 13 th to 15 th centuries. Successive buildings were constructed about a rectangular enclosure in the southern quarter of which lay the saint's tomb open tothe sky. Asquare dome chamberto the south of the tomb is the earliest of these buildings. In the course of the 14th century, a mosque was built on the east side of this dome chamber, a khangah and madrasa on the west, and a great aivan portal on the north. In 1362, thetwo halls flanking the portal were built. These afford a striking parallel to the two halls flanking the entrance portal at Gazur Gah: these, too, are roofed by transverse vaulting. The one is anassembly hall and the other a masjid inwhich the mihrab is placed in the centre of the southern and long side. The latter, known as the Masjid-I KirmanI after its architect Khwaja ZakI b. Muhammad b. Mas'ud, has already been mentioned (pi. 20). Tlmur himself erected akhangah on the north side of the enclosure but no trace ofthis remains. The most important additions inthe Timurid period were those of Shah Rukh's chief amir Jalal al-Dln Flruz Shah. These were amadrasa on the west side of the court and a"new" mosque immediately to the south of the square dome chamber. Apparently onlya part ofthe eastern side of the madrasa was completed: a small domed vestibule and adome chamber to the south known as the Gunbad-i Sabz, which according to an inscription was the work of Ustad Hajjl Mahmud, here described asattached to the Jami' of Shlraz, in 844/1440-1. The dome ofthe Gunbad-i Sabz is supported onthe system of intersecting arches which we have already met in the Madrasa-yi Ghiyasiyya at Khargird and the Gauhar Shad mausoleum atHerat. All that remains of Firiiz Shah's new mosque, completed in 846/1442-3, is the domed sanctuary chamber, theremainder having been rebuilt in recent times. Its vaulting system isthat of the Gunbad-i Sabz. Shah Rukh's minister, Ahmad b. Ishaq b. Majd al-Dln Muhammad of Khwaf, who was co-founder ofthe Madrasa-yi Ghiyasiyya at Khargird, was responsible for the so-called Masjid-i Maulana at Tayyabad,
south of the village of Yusufabad near the present Afghan frontier.2

TIMURID ARCHITECTURE
Completed in 848/1444-5, the same year as the madrasa at Khargird, it is described inits dedicatory inscription as a bucfa,a term apparently indicating afunerary function and assembly hall for asufl community. The tomb of the local saint, Zain al-Dln, stands in the middle of a rectangular enclosure. The Masjid-i Maulana occupies the south side of the latter and consists of a great aivan with two small flanking aivans leading into vaulted rooms. A doorway in the near wall of the principal aivan gives access tothe square dome chamber, the dome being supported onintersecting ribs. The name ofthe architect is unrecorded but Godard, drawing attention to the similarity in the treatment of the faience decoration to that of Gauhar Shad's mosque at Mashhad and of the Khargird madrasa, has suggested that the Tayyabad masjid was the work of Ghiyas al-Dln of Shlraz, who collaborated with Qivam al-Dln at Khargird.
These Khurasanian monuments retain much of their original surface decoration. Painted designs were reserved for interiors, such as in Gauhar Shad's mausoleum at Herat and Qivam al-Dln's dome chamber at Khargird. Large external surfaces were decorated with glazed brick inlaid in the unglazed brick surface inthe form ofbold chevron and lozenge patterns. Mosaic faience was reserved for smaller areas such as arch spandrels and inscription bands. The patterns were generally floral. Perhaps the most felicitous use oftilework istobe seen inthe interior of the great eastern aivan at Gazur Gah, where alower dadois decorated with square panels of inlaid bricks arranged in Kufic "seal" forms and a upper register iscomposed ofpolygonal panels — rhomboids, hexagons and triangles — with floral, geometric and "seal" patterns rendered in mosaic faience (pi. 29).
Shlrazi architects seem to have predominated in Khurasan during the reign ofShah Rukh and were probably the principal inspiration in the development of the new style. No doubt it was they who adopted the transverse vaulting system with such effect at Gazur Gah and Turbat-i Shaikh Jam. This, together with the use of intersecting arches as a dome support, created anew concept of interior space. The architectural forms of Transoxiana were refined: thus the ribbed dome of Gauhar Shad's mausoleum is more acceptable than that ofthe Gur-i Mir as, too, isthe relation between dome and drum. The facade of the court ofGauhar Shad's mosque at Mashhad with its harmonious and rhythmic alternation of voids and solids set astandard for later generations of Persian architects. The faience decoration of the buildings we
754



THE TURKMEN DYNASTIES
have been considering was ofa quality and variety rarely equalled and never surpassed insubsequent periods.
IV. ARCHITECTURAL ACTIVITY UNDER THE TURKMEN
DYNASTIES
In western andsouthern Persia during the reign of Shah Rukh there was no building activity comparable to that in Khurasan. Timurid power was contested first bytheJalayirids andthen by the Turkmen Qara Quyunlu; but the political disruptions of the period are only a partial explanation of the paucity of surviving monuments. Wehave seen the contribution ofthe architects ofShlraz inKhurasan; yettheir native city haslittle or nothing to offer. This is allthe stranger inasmuch as Shlraz under thepatronage ofits Timurid governors, Iskandar b. 'Umar Shaikh and Shah Rukh's son Ibrahim, was an active centre ofmanuscript illumination and painting. In 840/1436-7 the amir Chaqmaq built a four-aivan mosque in Yazd. The sanctuary aivan leads to a vaulted chamber containing the mihrab. Its most interesting feature is the oratory adjacent to the sanctuary which, with itstransverse vaulting andclerestory lighting,
resembles the Muzaffarid oratories intheMasjid-i Jami' atYazd.1 The only surviving evidence of Timurid building in Isfahan is the winter
oratory behind the north-west aivan in the Masjid-i Jami'.2 This was erected in 851/1444 at the order of Balsunqur's son, Sultan Muhammad, who governed Isfahan from 850/1446 to 855/1451. With its groined vaulting, supported by eighteen squat piers square in section, it is an impressive building. Daylight filters through panels inserted inthemiddle ofeach vault; andthelow height ofthe hall is designed toprovide a refuge from thewinter's cold. The architectof this building was a certain Shaikh Hasan b. Sharaf al-Dln, a nativeof Ravidasht near Kiihpaya, tothe east of Isfahan. The renewal ofbuilding activity was due to Turkmen initiative. In 1435 Tabriz became thecapital ofthe Qara Quyunlu andin 856/1452 Jahan Shah occupied Isfahan. In thesame year theDarb-i Imamwas built tocontain thetombs ofthe Imamzadas Ibrahim Batha andZain al-'Abidln. Much restored and altered in theSafavid period, it was

TIMURID ARCHITECTURE
originally a dome chamber preceded by a vestibule and portal.1 The last haslong been recognised as a masterpiece of tile decoration (pi. 30a). Itis also of considerable significance inasmuch as its composition adumbrates that of the Safavid portal. The voussoir of the archis defined by afacetted moulding which rests on low engaged columns of stone. The portal niche is treated as the halved section of a square dome chamber in which the transition to the hemispherical vault is obtained by two squinch arches each with a flanking arch. Subsidiary ribs spring from the haunches and apex of each arch and meet to form a starlike support for the hemispherical vault. The function of the ribs, however, isprobably asimulated one, for the actual springing ofthe vault occurs at the springing ofthe arches which themselves incline forwards. The tile revetment is of the highest quality. The arch is framed by aband of mosaic tilework with alternate cross and cartouche figures containing single floral sprays and split-leaf arabesques. A dado of monochrome pentagonal tiles runs around the screen and the niche interior. Flanking the door, now replaced by a wood screen carved in openwork, are panels of symmetrically disposed flowers issuing from a vase (pl.3o£). The two side walls of the interior are decorated with polygonal mosaic tiles applied to astar-tessellated ground of polygonal tiles. A broad inscription band intervenes between these panels and the squinch zone.
The most ambitious monument ofthe period ofJahan Shah Qara Quyunlu is the so-called Blue Mosque in Tabriz, built by Jahan Shah's
daughter Saliha Khanum in 1465.2 TheBlue Mosque has been regarded as a rare example of a covered mosque in Persia. One interpretation of the ground plan suggests acruciform aivan court covered by a great dome, surrounded onthree sides byvaulted and domed galleries (fig. 5). A sanctuary dome chamber projects from the south side, connected with the great inner dome court by the south aivan. The

Muhammad al-Bawab with the date 4Rabf I 870. It is not clear whether the latter was the architect or the official who supervised the building of the mosque.

galleries were roofed by transverse vaults which onthe east and west sides supported a dome behind the respective aivans. The north gallery, which served as the vestibule, contained three domed vaults equal in diameter tothose ofthe side galleries. Inthe north-west and northeast corners ofthe galleries were two larger domed vaults. The main facade ofthis mosque contained a lofty arched portal approached bya flight of three steps and at either end a tall tapering minaret round in section. The most interesting structural feature of the mosque is the
vaulting system of the domed court. The great dome, 16.75 m - m diameter, issupported on eight arches of equal span which spring from eight massive pillars (pi. 31a). Inactual fact, four ofthese are squinch arches which spring at an oblique angle from the piers. The spaces between thearches were filled in with bricks, each successiverow slightly corbelled inorder tosecure the circular seating for the dome. In the rear wall of each aivan was an arched opening leading to the

TIMURID ARCHITECTURE
galleries and sanctuary chamber; and there were similar arched openings in theadjacent walls beneath thesquinch arches. Since these arched openings occupied about one-half of the height of the great dome-supporting arches, it was possible to create window openings in the upper half, since the central mass rises above the galleries. The great dome and much of the vaulting has been destroyed as aresult of earthquake, but enough remains to judge with what success the architect had realised a solution to the problem of space and light. There has been some speculation regarding the source and origin of this design. There seems no need to look to Byzantine church architecture; and it would be worth investigating the contemporary Ottoman mosque as a source of inspiration. If the plan ofthe mosque was the result of an imported idea, the polychrome tilework iswholly Persian, with the exception, perhaps, of the gallery dado consisting of white
geometric interlaced bands on a black ground (pis. 31^, 32a).1 Muchis distinctive in style and technique and may well have been the work of local masters. Inthis category would be the embellishment ofmosaic tile patterns with an overlay of knots, arabesques and naskhl lettering in raised stucco. There are panels, too, ofmosaic tiles set ina ground of terracotta tiles in achevron arrangement (pi. 32^). Tilework of this style was introduced in the sanctuary aivan of the Masjid-i Jami', Isfahan, when the Aq Quyunlu ruler Uzun Hasan carried out restorations there in 1475-6. Two years after the completion of the Blue Mosque, Jahan Shah died in battle against Uzun Hasan, leader of the rival Turkmen dynasty, the Aq Quyunlu. Apart from Uzun Hasan's restorations in the Masjid-i Jami' at Isfahan, there is nosurviving evidence of the buildings with which he embellished Tabriz. A Venetian merchant who visited the city about 1510 has described the park and palace of the
Hasht Bihisht as well as the other monuments of the city,2 but these are
the work, as Woods has demonstrated, of Uzun Hasan's son Ya'qiib.3 Hinz, however, has located Uzun Hasan's mosque and madrasa near
the Sahib al-'Amr mosque.4

CHAPTER I5
SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE*
Safavid buildings arepreserved in greater abundance than those of any other period in Iran. Yet Safavid architecture is far more imperfectly known than that of the Saljuqs, Il-Khanids or Timurids. Several factors help to explain this paradox. One is quite simply prejudice. The finest Safavid buildings lend themselves to uncritical panegyric and readily enter the unlovely category of tourist attractions, and perhaps for that very reason many of them have not been subjected to detailed scholarly analysis. Alternatively, one might cite the inadequate documentation of Safavid architecture: the relative dearth of monographs, technical drawings and theses in this field makes any general survey premature. A third contributory factor is the over-exposure of a few significant buildings in Isfahan, whose very accessibility is a snareand throws into unjust obscurity comparatively inaccessible work at Ardabll, Mahan, Kirman and Mashhad. This paradoxical neglect of a richly productive period hasmeant that the term "Safavid" is not yet precise enough to be used safely inthe context of architecture. It does not yet connote special kinds of ground plan, spatial organisation, fa£ade composition, muqarnas, arch profiles or vaulting, though it is awidely used concept inthe field oftilework. One of the objects of this chapter is to demonstrate that at least three Safavid styles coexisted and that only the function of the building — religious, palatial or otherwise secular — determined which of them should beused. It is in the domain of religious architecture that the definition ofa Safavid style poses the most problems, particularly in view of the eagerness of Safavid patrons to repair and extend earlier monuments. These changes are rarely recorded in detail in the inscriptions which mention them, and tile mosaic - at first sight the obvious dating control — is a potentially treacherous guide because of the innateconservatism of the medium in such matters as technique and palette. A close examination of the designs employed might lead, in Safavid as in early Islamic ornament, to the recognition of small but significant

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
changes inapparently standard design elements and these might then
be fitted into a chronological framework.1 In the absence of inscriptions, certain types of brick and stucco ornament, fresco painting and, above all,square underglaze-painted tiles andtheir varied subject matter allfurnish useful clues fordating. But the close resemblance between the decorated domes of the Masjid-i Shah and the Madar-i Shah madrasa is sufficient reminder of the pitfalls of using ornament as a dating control. It is not surprising that, in cultic architecture, "Safavid" has become something ofa collective adjective to describe work which could date from almost any time between the 15 th and the 20th century. The definition of "Safavid" in the case of palatial architecture presents rather fewer problems; fewer than ten palaces survive, most of them inIsfahan, and they are usually datable either by inscriptionsor by literary evidence. Their ostentatiously frail architecture, their garden setting and their decoration, with its echoes ofthe minor arts, together lend these palaces a recognisable individuality. Finally, the term "Safavid" iswidely and often inaccurately usedto describe a great range of non-palatial secular structures. In someof these buildings — dams, pigeon towers, cisterns, ice houses — the scope for innovation was slight. Itis in the study of bridges and caravansarais that the search for a distinctive Safavid secular style may most profitably be pursued. But such buildings are especially hard to date. Devoid alike of ornament and epigraphy, they have an almost puritanical austerity. They obey themaxim that form follows function. They inhabit a different world from that of the imperial monuments in Isfahan, and their influence extended right into the present century. Numerous differences in plan, size, layout or facilities may benoted between the various caravansarais in particular, but these may reflect specific local needs or the amount of money available and are not necessarily helpful in dating these buildings or in identifying a developing style. So much for the obstacles which currently impede a proper understanding of Safavid architecture. In such a situation the most profitable approach may well be to base a general survey on detailed discussion ofa few key monuments, and thus prevent the discussion

degenerating into a jejune list ofbuildings, dates and craftsmen. Only by drastic selection will the wood emerge from the trees. But - to adapt the familiar metaphor — the nature of the wood depends on the type and quantity of trees. Brief lists of buildings will therefore be included asbackground material at certain stages of the discussion. Buildings usually omitted from general surveys will be analysed inan attempt to bring into clearer focus the architectural activity of the 16th and the later 17th centuries, two substantial epochs in the historyof Safavid architecture which have hitherto been very imperfectly known. The accession of Shah Isma'Il (907/1501) has commonly been regarded asa turning point in the history of Iran. It would beidle, however, to regard his reign as acomparable landmark in architectural history. Indeed, itwould be hard to find any quarter-century in Iranian architecture since the rise of the Saljuqs (the aftermath of the Mongol conquests excepted) of which less material evidence survives. Architecture was of far less account to the shah than were poetry, painting,
calligraphy and music.1 Perhaps the political turmoil of Isma'U's reign ensured that unusually little was produced. At all events, no breath of innovation disturbed the architecture of the time, which placidly continued in thelate Timurid idiom. Small-scale decorative set-pieces closely rivalled the best work ofthe previous age, but there seemsto have been no attempt to imitate the ambitious ensembles (e.g. at Mashhad and Samarqand) popular in the previous century. Enthusiastic accounts of the palaces of Isma'Il have been left by Western travellers, but apparently none of these structures was built tolast. The random scatter ofsurviving early 16th-century buildings offers no clue to the magnificence of later Safavid architecture. Undoubtedly the masterpiece of the period is the portal of the tomb of Harun-i Vilayat at Isfahan, dated Rabl' I 918/May — June 1513. The patron, the Grand Vizier Durmlsh Khan, is mentioned in a Persian distich over the door; such poetical quotations, hitherto infrequent, quickly became a characteristic of Safavid buildings. Architecturally the complex is curious rather than distinguished, with an exterior which in totofalls far short of the portal, though the original layout has been overlaid by numerous later restorations. The exterior elevation of the dome chamber illustrates inminiature the piecemeal nature ofthe

whole complex. Its octagonal base gives way to asquare middle storey, a reversal of the usual practice. The dome above, whose tilework is entirely of recent date, rests on a high cylindrical drum setover a modest octagon and has a slight bulge at the collar, aprofile very close to that of the Masjid-i Shah, Mashhad (85 5/1451). In its choice of basic elements such as dome, courtyard and facade the building is in no sense novel. But a distinct change of emphasis can be detected here. Attention focuses onthe exterior facade rather than onthe internal layout,an emphasis frequently repeated in later Safavid buildings. Itis of a piece with this approach that areas which are generally seen (such as the lower part ofthe drum and the octagon beneath it) should be left in plain brick. The building is conceived more as a frame for lavish decoration than as an entity in which each element has its part to play; hence itsdefective design. Itsfacade, to besure, subtly exploits the plastic potential ofthe arched niche, which, repeated atvarious scales and depths, is the leitmotif of the whole composition. But stepping through the grandiose gateway the visitor can scarcely escape a feeling of anticlimax atthe restricted inner courtyard and atthe imbalance of the dominant dome chamber inthis cramped composition. Internally this dome chamber is unremarkable as architecture; itis notable principally for its dadoes of tile mosaic and its numerous inscription bands. The identity of the saintly Harun in whose honour the tomb {mashhad) was built remains amystery which the romantic confections of Chardin do little to dispel. He is referred to only indirectly by means of a hadith quoted in afoundation inscription whose allusiveness can be paralleled in other contemporary epigraphy. Far from being a simple factual record of the date of the building and the titles of the ruler, itis an elaborate act of homage to Shah Isma'Il. His descent from 'All (jaddhu) is brought inunder cover ofthe hadith mentioning Harun. His war against the Ottomans isexalted into ajihad by the use ofthe time-honoured titles al-gha^t, al-mujdhidft sabilAllah. His rule is twice termed a caliphate, surely intended as a counter to the Ottoman usurpation ofthe title. Apunning reference tothe name ofthe tomb may be detected in the use of the title wallal-wilayat for the shah, andit is surely no coincidence that this inscription, placed in a portal, mentions the ever-open doors of the shah's bounty. Itis even possible that this apparently conventional eulogy is intended to bear atheological interpretation. In some of his more ecstatic verse Isma'Il compared

himself to 'All, and the concept of 'All as the gate to paradise was standard among Shl'is. Indeed, the inscription over the eastern door of the mausoleum - again the location is important - quotes Muhammad's saying, "Iam the city of knowledge and 'All is its gate". Appropriately enough the name of 'All joins those of Muhammad and Allah in acartouche of square Kufic placed atthe apex of the entrance arch. Below this, and in the tympanum of the door itself, is a panel depicting "birds ofparadise" set within a radiant nimbus of Chinese clouds. The central axis of this figural panel coincides exactly with the name Isma'Il in the main portal inscription immediately beneath it. The name and titles of the shah are executed in dusky golden letters which stand out from the white used for the rest of the inscription. It is hard to avoid theconclusion that inscription and decoration alike have theological as well as political undertones and that they exalt the more
than human status of Isma'Il.1 Yet it isnot on these grounds that the building has attracted attention, for its crucial position inthe history ofglazed tilework has preempted detailed discussion ofits other features. Apart from the high quality ofthe tilework, its dependence on earlier techniques demands emphasis. Its hints on the future development ofSafavid tilework are noted below, but atthe same time it exemplifies the major techniques developed previously. Thus, with the nearby Masjid-i 'All, itserves as a coda to agreat tradition. In addition to tile mosaic, the best established of these tilework techniques, it illustrates chequerboard work derived ultimately from Saljuq brick decoration, glazed geometric window grilles, strips of monochrome tilework outlining architectural features and the use of glazed insets against apredominantly brick background. A wide range of scripts is employed. The tall compressed cursive usually termed thulth predominates, but the verses over the door area very early monumental example of nasta'ltq, while naskh and square
Kufic are also found.2 The use of a different colour for the name and titles ofthe sovereign had long been standard practice, nor was it a novelty to employ living creatures in the decorative scheme. Floral compositions closely linked to carpet designs were equally familiar. Only the emphasis onthin billowing sprays, effortlessly confined to their panels and pruned of most of their leaves, is perhaps hard to

parallel in earlier work, though of course the arabesque is asold as Islamic art itself. But what the facade lacks in novelty itredeems by the diverse range of styles which it fits into a limited space, and by its daring chromatic harmonies. The thin glazed strips, like much ofthe tile mosaic, are in line with Timurid work in Khurasan, while the motif of glazed insets against plain brick — the single recurrent theme of the facade - finds, like the tawny marble dado, a ready parallel in the Blue Mosque at Tabriz. Thus this early Safavid building in central Iran draws together (as does contemporary painting) the divergent threads of eastern and western Persian traditions ina harmonious synthesis an apt symbol of this nascent pan-Iranian kingdom. The sister building to the mashhad of Harun-i Vilayat, the neighbouring and almost exactly contemporary Masjid-i 'All, shares many ofits characteristics. It too is renowned for the tilework ofits facade, though here plain brick and geometric patterns play a much larger role than atHarun-i Vilayat. Some of the untiled designs would not look out of place on a Saljuq building, apart from the yellow brick in which they are executed. Square Kufic is used on both a small and a large scale to spell outsacred names. Architecturally this mosque, apparently anew foundation, is of a much higher order than the nearby mausoleum, though their street facades have much in common. Internally the Masjid-i 'AH - the name is apparently apopular one, like its former title of the Sanjari mosque, and is not attested by inscription — is of four-aipdn plan, with a substantial domed sanctuary. This chamber, dated 929/1522, provides an instructive link between the Blue Mosque of Tabriz and the Masjid-i Shaikh Lutf-Allah. Withits numerous arched bays opening at ground and gallery level it at once recalls the earlier building. But the square ground plan, and the use of four massive pendentives tocarry the dome, looks ahead tothe later mosque. These pendentives are identical in size and contour to the arches along the main axes; net vaulting fills the intervening spaces, and a thick circular inscription band (Qur'an xvii. 1-14) completes the transition tothe dome. This interior is of almost unrelieved plainness; its white plaster surfaces are heightened only by the red outlining of the arch profiles. Within the bays the upper area is filled bymodest decorative minor vaults. Nothing could refute more decisively the popular image of Safavid architecture dominated by applied ornament. The handsome, spacious proportions of this mosque, and its bold reworking ofthe traditional domed square formula, make it formally

the outstanding building of this period, even though it would be rash to conclude that it exerted direct influence on later architects. The portal inscription contains theological allusions of the same esoteric nature as those discussed earlier. Shah Isma'U is described as the one "on whom descends the grace of having his name repeatedin the Qur'an as many times as there are Imams". On the face of it, this simply celebrates the pious antecedents of his name. But since the name of Isma'il occurs in the Qur'an twelve times, and since it wasthe Twelver Shl'I faith that Isma'il had instituted as the national creed, this phrasing may be seen notonly as intensely topical butalso as an attempt to elevate Isma'il tothe rank of Imam atleast by implication. There may be ahint too that this accords with the Divine will : hence the numerical concordance between the number of references to Isma'il in the Qur'an and the number of Imams. In this context of esoteric allusions the choice of words forthe chronogram at the end of the (portal) inscription is surely also significant: "He has come, the opener of gates". For while this term usually refers to Allah Himself,the equation of 'AH with a bab ("gate") is found in other buildings of Isfahan, always with a double meaning: 'AH as a gate to spiritual enlightenment, and a punning reference to the location of these inscriptions over the entrances to religious buildings. In this mosquea third level of meaning may be intended, for the inscription has an extra appropriateness on a mosque which isitself named after 'All and may
therefore indicate that the popular name is the correct one.1 Two buildings atSava offer further insights into the architecture of this period. The transfer of the capital from Tabriz to Qazvin gave the city a new importance, forimportant roads from the south-east and south-west met there. It would thus benatural for Shah Isma'il to embellish it. But the extent of early Safavid work in the Masjid-i Jami' has been somewhat exaggerated. The interior revetment ofthe dome chamber includes the name ofSa'd b. Muhammad Kaduk (also found in the Yazd Jami', c. 1375), and this makes it premature todate even the upper structure ofthe dome chamber to the early 16th century. Indeed, the major new construction inthe mosque atthis period was apparently limited toa kind ofinflated cbahdr-su in the south-western corner, while the vaults of the two aivans received a garnishing of

clumps of stalactites. The decoration ofthe sanctuary area includes a probably pre-Safavid dado of hexagonal turquoise tiles anda tile mosaic inscription in the qibla aivan with the date 927/1520. Its piece de resistance, however, is the carved stucco mihrab.The early Safavid parts of the Sava Jami' use plaster decoration, whose vogue had passed one and a half centuries earlier, to aremarkable extent. This mihrab, for all the virtuosity of its riqa' inscriptions, illustrates that the attempt to revive this obsolete technique was ill-advised. Saljuq and Il-Khanid plaster mihrabs, ofwhich examples have been found in this mosque, are conceived sculpturally and exploit several levels of carving. This mihrab, by contrast, reproduces in stucco the kind of two-dimensional design originally created for tile mosaic or book-covers. In the Masjid-i Maidan nearby, whose inscriptions dated 916/1510 and 924/1518 refer to Safavid restoration work, a very similar mihrab, perhaps the work
of the same artist, may be found.1 Amidst the sparse output ofShah Ismail's reign one other building deserves analysis: the tomb of Shaikh Jibra'il (father of Shaikh SafI)at Kalkhuran near Ardabll (fig. 1). Although it bears no date, it is generally agreed tobe of the early 16th century, for its style and decoration are post-Timurid while a terminus post quern isprovided by the restoration work ofShah 'Abbas I there, dated 1030-1/1620-2. The building could most naturally beinterpreted as one of the first-fruits of the virtually uninterrupted interest in Ardabll shown by the Safavid shahs, who clearly saw the mausoleum ofSafI and its dependencies as a kind of dynastic shrine. Both the form and the function ofthe mausoleum are significant. Its form owes ageneral debt to the great domed squares of Timurid Transoxiana, notably the mosque-mausoleum of Khwaja Ahmad Yasavl at Turkistan and the Gur-i Mir. Itis much smaller than these, however, and its form is still transitional, not least in the lack of integration between its internal and external layout. Amuch restored dome on a high drum is set abruptly, without intermediary, on a square, flat-roofed lower storey whose box-like appearance is
redeemed only by deep axial arched portals.2 Such mausolea replaced the tomb tower, offering afar more spacious layout which encouraged large-scale pilgrimages. This decisive shift away from ostentatiously secular memorials is already evident in the burial arrangements for

Shah Isma'U in the Ardabll shrine (fig. 2). While the shah apparently continued the medieval tradition sufficiently to erect a cylindrical domed tomb tower for himself, the building was not only small but surrendered all claim to outward display by its avoidance of a freestanding site. Hemmed in amidst larger buildings, it is clearly an anachronism - a traditional architectural type transformed by a novel setting. Most subsequent Safavid shahs were buried in sacred shrines of long standing, their graves marked by sarcophagi rather than buildings. Numerous inscriptions in buildings throughout the country testify to building activity in the reign of Shah Isma'il. New construction or repairs were carried out on structures as diverse as the shrines of Ardabil, Mashhad (920/1514) and Qum (facade of the Sahn-i Kuhna, 925/1519); the Friday mosques of Damavand (927/1520), Gaz and

Isfahan; tombs like that of Khatun Qiyamat at Shlraz, Husain at Qum or Chihil Akhtaran at Qum; and the bridge of Qaflan Kuh (923/1517). Decrees dating from this period are found, among other places, in the Masjid-i Maidan, Kashan (922/1516), and in the Friday mosque of Simnan (926/1519), while among the many examples of carved woodwork may be cited those at the shrine of 'Abd al-'AzIm at Ray (918/1512), the Imamzada Ibrahim at Amul (924/1519), the tomb of Baba Afzal at Maraq (912/1506) and the tomb of Sultan Mir Ahmad at Kashan (915/1509). Tombstones include examples at Natanz (921/1515) and the Imamzada Zaid, Tehran (Rajab 920/August September 1514). Finally, it seems appropriate in view of Shah Isma'Il's love of hunting to note, as a curiosity, that against all expectations a minaret decorated with the horns and skulls of game survives on the outskirts of Khuy. Contemporary accounts record the erection of such a tower here. If, then, the reign of Shah Isma'Il is not so void of architectural activity as is often thought, nevertheless it represents a startling decline in productivity compared with the high level of preceding centuries. This decline characterises the lengthy reign of Shah Tahmasp too. Yet this reign was incomparably more peaceful than that of Shah Isma'Il, and the country prospered accordingly. The continued lull in building activity must be laid at the door of the shah himself, whose apathy as a patron came to affect all the arts. Only a very few ambitious buildings or parts of buildings may be distinguished amidst the well over forty published so far and datable to his reign on grounds of epigraphy alone. Like his father, Shah Tahmasp cannot be credited with a single surviving mosque for which he was wholly responsible. Not sur

prisingly, Iranian architecture of this period had nomarkedly individual style; hence the difficulty of fashioning dating controls to apply to undated buildings. In defence ofShah Tahmasp it must be said that his best work was probably concentrated in his capital city of Qazvln, which has suffered cruelly from earthquakes. Thus virtually nothing remains of his Masjid-i Shah and his royal palace (though a kiosk which was part of
the royal palace and has recently been refurbished gives some clues);1 while his baths (and probably his bazaar) have entirely gone. Among surviving buildings of his reign the Jannat-sara at Ardabll deserves special mention, though his work on the shrine as a whole isfar less
than was formerly thought.2 Important mausolea survive at Nishapur and Sultaniyya, while the best tilework ofthe time can be seen inthe Friday mosques ofIsfahan, Kirman and Shlraz as well as inthe fragments ofsmaller Isfahan mosques now re-erected inthe garden ofthe Chihil Sutun palace. With these various exceptions, then, the majority of the work carried out under Shah Tahmasp, and identifiable as such on epigraphic grounds, comprises repairs or additions to existing shrines (e.g., Mashhad andArdabll); mausolea (including five in Kashan, six in the Yazd area and eight in Qum and its surroundings); mosques (Barsiyan, Qum, Yazd, Shushtar, Saravar and the Masjid-i Jami', Isfahan, along with six others in the city); tombstones, orstone slabs inscribed with decrees (e.g., at Kashan, Masjid-i Maidan); woodwork (e.g., Tajrlsh, Imamzada Qasim; Tabas, Imamzada Husain; Natanz shrine; Kashan, Sultan Mir Ahmad; Ray, Bibl Shahrbanu; Qazvln, Shahzada Husain; and Plshva, Imamzada Ja'far); and a few modest tombs (Imamzadas Abazar, near Qazvln, Hamza at Bavanat, and Abu'l-Futuh at Vanshan, the last two with quantities of carved woodwork). Although, strictly speaking, slabs with decrees, tombstones, carved doors and sarcophagi are extrinsic to the basic structure of the building in which they occur and are thus ofno value in dating the structure itself, their presence is at least an indication that atthe date in question the building didattract theinterest of a patron. While otherwise undatable repairs cannot be dated on such evidence alone in any given case, there must bea strong presumption that in many cases these

inscribed dates are contemporary with unrecorded restorations and repairs in such buildings. It will be apparent that this output has much in common with thehaphazard collection of small-scale andlimited work, innocent of any overall direction or momentum, which constitutes the architectural achievement of Shah Isma'Il. The architectural achievements of the reign may conveniently be discussed under two headings: mosques and shrines. APersian inscription framing the qibla aivan of the Isfahan Jami' and dated to the "caliphate" of Shah Tahmasp mentions the beautifying and repair (ta\in va ta'mir) of the mosque. Contemporary with this is the inscription framing the arch of the same aivan, and further nasta'llq inscriptions are found within the aivan. Presumably the refurbishing didnot extend beyond the aivan. In the framing arch an unusual layout is adopted. Cartouches ofbasically tabula ansata form, but with rounded ends, alternate with smaller quatrefoils. The latter carry brief prayers and pious sayings, such as invocations to 'All, while each ofthe former contains anextended litany onone of the Fourteen Pure Ones. A third inscription on the soffit of this entrance arch gives the date 938/15 31-2. Significantly enough this work, executed in a mosque which forcenturies had attracted the highest patronage inthe land, was paid forby acertain Muhammad al-Isfahanl working under the aegis of the lady Aqa Sultan; no credit isaccorded tothe shah himself. As inthe
previous IsfahanI monuments, nasta'llq is given some prominence.1At Barsiyan the Saljuq mosque, consisting presumably ofan isolated dome chamber and minaret, was enlarged by the addition ofa courtyard with aivans. In the Kirman Jami' the tile mosaic mihrab probably dates from the rebuilding of967/1559-60 mentioned onthe southern portal of the mosque; itsarabesques recall coiled springs rather than plant life and represent a hardening of the motif in comparison with early Safavid work at Isfahan. For all its high technical quality, this is a very mechanical production. Finally, the Jami' of Shlraz deserves noticefor the tile mosaic dated 973/1565-6 inthe qibla aivan. Its generous use of plain brick to actas a foil for tiled insets of almostfleur-de-lyspattern, like its emphasis on bold strapwork and lozenges spelling out sacred names in square Kufic, finds equally convincing parallels in Timurid Khurasan and in 15th-century Azarbaljan.

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
More can be learned ofthe architecture of this period from a study of its mausolea. Anunusually grand example, though its funerary purpose is not absolutely certain and though it has lost itsdome, is provided by the octagonal Jannat-sara at Ardabll, datable c. 1540 (fig.2). This was the largest single building on the site and, perhaps on account ofthe sanctity ofthe Ardabll shrine in Safavid times andits place of honour among the monuments of the land, the building represents an unusually munificent effort on the part ofthe shah. Withits great dome, which originally had a span ofover 16 m., and its commanding position at one end of the great inner courtyard of the shrine, this spacious octagon may well have been intended byTahmasp to serve as his own tomb. Internally the plan retains its octagonal shape on both of its storeys; each side is occupied by a great blind arch enclosing narrow superposed arched niches. Subsequent alterations have disfigured the original plan, inwhich great arched recesses, each corresponding toone side ofthe octagon and reaching almost to the springing of the dome, were scooped out ofthe exterior facade. Only on the south-west side, which was preceded by an entrance aivan, and directly opposite on the north-east side, where the recess was internal, is the arrangement different. Whether these huge external bays held doors or windows originally can only bedetermined by excavation, but either way it isthe open plan ofthe structure that deserves attention. Rather than discouraging access by aforbidding high blank wall, the architect has chosen, by this device of deep bays, toinvite entry into the building. Psychologically the effect is quite different from that of previous tombs. Hints of this change are found in earlier buildings, though the new approach had not hitherto been expressed soboldly
and on such a large scale.1 Subsequent Safavid mausolea continued to favour this open plan, though perhaps none pares down the octagon so inexorably to its eight constituent piers. In the tomb of Mulla Hasan ShlrazI at Sultaniyya, for example, now shorn of its garden setting, the lightness and airiness of the octagon, in which broad, deep aivans alternate with narrower and shallower arched bays (an interesting variation on the theme of the Jannat-sara), gives way toa heavy complex interior with many walls containing staircases. The incompatible emphases of an open octagon and aclosed square chamber remain unresolved. Even the multi-tiered

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
stalactite ceiling contrives to suggest weight rather than lightness, possibly because its many miniature spandrels have recently been picked outin red, butmore likely because the inner dome is too shallow for such treatment. Quite apart from its plan, this mausoleum deserves attention for its tilework, in which may be detected a conscious antiquarianism. Thus the small glazed joint plugs with simple geometric or floral designs in two or three colours used on the exterior wall occur as early as the tomb of Oljeitii nearby and are also found in the Blue Mosque at Tabriz. The finest work, however, isreserved for the drum of the dome, which isencircled by a band oftwelve panels containing an ingenious interlocking series of inscriptions executed in square Kufic and invoking divine blessings on theFourteen Pure Ones. The band isbordered above and below by geometrical patterns in glazed brick. The dome itself is blue while tile mosaic adorns the spandrels of the aivans. All inall this varied decoration isan entirely
appropriate reminder that Mulla Hasan bore the title "Kashl".1 Larger tombs of the period include the Imamzada Sultan Muhammad 'Abid (said to be the brother of the Imam Rida) at Kakh, near Gunabad, dated 960/1552, whose dominant feature is a massive dome on a high drum. A broad and low projecting facade with a central portal aivan provides amodest approach to the tomb chamber. Basically similar in layout is the shrine of Muhammad Mahruq near NIshapur. According to legend the saint was burned (hence his name) for converting an 'Abbasid princess to theShl'I creed. Two doors within the shrine, ofwhich one isdated 978/1570 and both are signed by Imam Qull Najjar, give a terminus for the building itself. As with the tomb of Mulla Hasan, the main chamber is square, but the flanking structures are more complex and are dominated bya huge stepped portal aivan flanked by superposed arcuated niches. Moreover, despite lavish later tilework, dated 1041/1631, in the domed rooms flanking the main tomb chamber, parts of the shrine exhibit a notable simplicity. Plain brick suffices for the lower parts of the shrine's exterior, while the interior of the dome chamber, following Timurid precedent, is
plain white apart from the tiled dado.2 An entirely unexpected find in recent years has been the richly decorated remains of a once extensive palace inNa'in (pi. 41). Archi

tecturally its layout is unusual, with asunken courtyard whose fagades are broken by four uneven aivans, two per long side. Living quarters are disposed intwo storeys ofwhich the upper one had a room with niches specially carved in pottery shapes, as at the 'All Qapu. The largest aivan has an ambitious net vault executed in several planes with greatly thickened ribs to indicate the contours of the vault. Blank niches, alternately broad and narrow, form the basis from which the vault's ribs spring toform varied stellar patterns. Above a plain dado with recessed panels the entire field is decorated. Niches and stellar patterns alike contain figural ornament. The technique inthese plaster panels is so fine and detailed that they seem to be paintings, but in fact the white stucco skin is cut away toreveal the dark background and thus form the design; the technique is of extreme rarity in Safavid, though not in later, times. Traces of colour survive but itis not certain whether these are original, especially as other similar decoration in Na'In has suffered subsequent repainting. The themes of the decoration are the common coin of miniature painting, with scenes from Nizaml (Farhad and Shirin) and Jam! (Yusuf and Zulaikha), as well as games of polo, enthroned royal couples, banquets and hunts. Inscriptions of Persian poetry (Hafiz) in densely decorated cartouches like 'unvdns, and above all the style of these figures, drive home the parallel. The stellar forms created by the vault have predominantly chinoiserie themes: dragons, phoenixes, flying ducks, ch'i-lins and so on. The form and content irresistibly evoke Il-Khanid glazed star tiles. At the apex ofthe ceiling and ofthe iconographic programme is the largest such star which depicts a group of eight angels. Some reference to Paradise seems to be intended here, and the widespread ancient equation of an actual vault with the dome of heaven isemphasised by the many stars ofthe rib vault. Apair ofmuch smaller rooms (some 5 m. and 3^ m. high respectively) bear broadly similar decoration to that of the aivan. The ensemble has convincingly been dated toc. 1560 but
its presence inaprovincial town like Na'In has yet to be explained.1 In the dozen years between the death of Tahmasp and the accession of 'Abbas I architecture continued in the doldrums. Literary sources preserve the memory ofvanished buildings erected inthis period but little more survives than an occasional mosque (Isfahan, Masjid-i Fath),

tombstone (Isfahan, Baba Qasim; Vanshan, Imamzada Abu'l-Futuh; Isfahan, Imamzada Isma'Il), decree (Kashan, Masjid-i Maidan) or sarcophagus (Pishva, Imamzada Ja'far; Turbat-i Haidariyya, Mazar Qutb al-Din). Repairs were carried out on the Masjid-i Nau atShlraz in 995/1586. The accession of Shah 'Abbas completely transformed the sorry state of affairs which had prevailed in Iranian architecture for nearly a century. His achievements inthis field placed Persian work belatedly but firmly on an equal footing with the output ofthe Ottomans and Mughals. Around 1600 these super-powers between them controlled the Muslim world from Bengal to theAtlantic; the scale of their architectural achievements reflected this political dominance and was unsurpassed in the contemporary world. The lesson ofscale was not lost on Louis XIV when his ambassadors regaled him with marvellous tales of Asian palaces. In Iran the new spirit was symbolised by Isfahan. The dynamism of the new shah as a patron ofbuilding stimulated architects to recover the inspiration that had trickled away inthe long stagnation ofprevious reigns. Appropriately enough, Timurid — and not earlier Safavid architecture provided the springboard for fresh developments, though 'Abbas had a sense of vision beside which Tlmur's enthusiasm for building stands exposed as merely frenetic and aimless. Such was the impetus generated by this monarch that architecture continued to thrive in spite ofthe progressive political and economic decline over which hissuccessors presided. The buildings selected for extended discussion here can only hint atthe wealth, variety and sheer quantity of contemporary architecture. Inevitably themonuments of Isfahan claim pride of place, but important works atArdabll, Kirman, Mahan, Mashhad, and Shlraz can beused to create a more balanced picture, while palaces and gardens at Ashraf, Bairamabad, Kashan and Saflabad help to reconstitute the lost splendours of the Chahar Bagh. A local school of Perso-Armenian architecture at Julfa illustrates the pervasive influence of the Safavid aesthetic on an otherwise sturdily independent and alien tradition. Lastly, the output of public works is on such a massive scale that it reveals an entirely new dimension to Safavid architecture. Impressive as the various provincial foundations are individually, however, they are isolated. Some ofthem are necessarily restricted in concept since they were conceived as additions to pre-existing

ensembles; others were the work ofroyal governors. To assess Shah 'Abbas himself as apatron one must turn to Isfahan; indeed, itis in the masterpieces erected there between 1598 and 1628 that Safavid architecture found its authentic expression. Several introductory remarks may be inorder. 'Abbas had been on the throne for almost adecade when he moved the capital from Qazvin to Isfahan inspring 1598. Inthat time he had achieved very little asa patron of architecture. It was apparently themove ,to Isfahan that roused his dormant ambitions in this field and triggered a vast programme of construction. Itseems justified to conclude that Isfahan had his heart. Atthe same time the previous urban development and the natural setting of the city favoured these plans for expansion. Most of the population was concentrated in the older quarters to the north, where the natural focus was the Saljuq Maidan-i Kuhna. To the south, all the way to the river and beyond, the shah had more of a free hand. The very presence ofa large river and ofgreat tracts of unoccupied land so close tothe city favoured a scheme ofurban planning on the grand scale (fig. 3). Indeed, one of the most notable features of Safavid architecture inIsfahan after 1598 isthe change of pace. Instead ofthe spasmodic and uncoordinated activity ofearlier years a new senseof purpose makes itself felt. Much more is undertaken and some of the projects are completed with remarkable speed. As more new buildings rise, and as the outline of the royal scheme becomes increasingly clear, architecture becomes afashionable concern. But there is little evidence that the buildings themselves were distinguished by any great originality. The concept ofa city plan dominated by a great square was not new in Iran. At Shlraz the square had, like Isfahan, abazaar fronted by a naqqdra-khdna at one end, with the royal palace opposite. In Isfahan itself the Maidan-i Kuhna was a familiar sight. Fifteenth-century Tabriz had several great squares linked by arterial thoroughfares. The maidan of Shah 'Abbas itself extended an earlier maidan on the same site. Perhaps a maidan built afresh on an unencumbered site and designedly bordered bymosques would have been oriented towards the qibla, thereby rendering otiose the ingenious shifts employed by the royal architects to accommodate divergent axes in theMasjid-i Shah and the Lutf-Allah mosque. Yet if the novelty of the Isfahan of1630 has been overestimated, one must concede that itoffered aunique combination of qualities. Quantities of brand new buildings, some of spectacular scale and beauty, met

the eye at every turn and were often a key element in extensive and entirely man-made prospects. The reconstructed city itself was remarkably large and the maidan aptly symbolised this. Seldom was anew city so embowered in gardens; indeed, the Chahar Bagh in its heyday was a Persian garden carpet conjured into three dimensions. It was this opulent ambience of flowers, streams, trees and fountains that surprised and delighted European visitors, and contrived todisarm even the curmudgeonly chauvinist Tavernier. Their verdict isunanimous : no contemporary city in the world could rival Isfahan; and these were
men familiar with the greatest cities of Europe.1 The series of masterpieces begins with the Chahar Bagh, where work was under way directly after Shah 'Abbas had made Isfahan his capital (fig. 4). The name derives from four vineyards which he had to rent in order to carry out his plan. In form the Chahar Bagh is a huge avenue some 4 km. long which ran on adirect north-south axis from the royal gardens bordering the centre of the maidan to the Hazar Jarlb, a royal estate some two km. south of the Zayandarud. Stately plane trees planted in rows divided it into three alleys, ofwhich the central one contained acanal. Fountains and cascades punctuated its flow. Gardens spread far and wide on either side of the Chahar Bagh and trellised rather than solid walls allowed passers-by to enjoy glimpses of them from the public thoroughfare. At intervals palaces with names like Satara, 'Abbasabad, Jahan-nama and Nastaran emerged from gardens named after thrones, nightingales, dervishes, mulberries and paradise itself. Never intended for commercial traffic, the Safavid Chahar Bagh, as its name indicates, was essentially agarden, whose shaded walks made it a pergola on the grand scale. But itis as much an expression of architectural values as it is landscape gardening. Its use of a long vistaflankedby palaces and closed at either end by amonumental building, and the use of apparently endless arcades to define the enclosed space, both find analogies inthe maidan. There too nature ismade part ofthe overall scheme, and there too the designer has blocked out his plan on the basis of adjoining rectangles. Yet there is no hint of coercion, no unnatural rigidity, inthis layout; contemporary accounts stress how ideally the Chahar Bagh was suited for the tranquil civilised pleasures of convers
ing, strolling — or, more often, riding — and watching the world go by.2

Forming a natural pendant tothe shah's work on the Chahar Bagh and to his development of Julfa, the purpose-built Armenian suburb, is the bridge that links these two projects and continues the axis ofthe promenade. Erected in 1011/1602 by the shah's favourite and generalissimo, AllahvardI Khan, and named after him, itis aremarkable 300 m. in length. As if aware ofthe danger ofmonotony, the architect garnished the bridge with pavilions atintervals, but these were not large enough tobreak its overall lines. Open orcovered footpaths at three levels areingeniously incorporated into the stately double arcade which is theessence of the design. Asin theChahar Bagh itself,
practical and aesthetic aims harmonise.1 If the Chahar Bagh, for all its deliberate informality and its function as a promenade, imposed order onone part of the new Isfahan,the maidan did the same for the area to the east (fig. 5). Curiously enough, the two projects are not directly linked, although it would have been an obvious move to make the Chahar Bagh the main pedestrian approach tothe maidan. Perhaps the shah was circumscribed in both projects byland rights and the current function of the area. At all events, the avenue and the maidan were the key features ofthe new Isfahan, providing a framework within which subsequent buildings could be fitted. Much of their importance depended on their sheer size. The maidan measures 512 m. X 159 m. and thus covers over eight hectares, far outstripping comparable European urban plazas. Its apparent size is much increased by the buildings fronted with a low two-storeyed arcade which define its limits and make it apiazza rather than a sprawling field (fig. 6). These date from 1020—1/1611 — 12, and are primarily functional; shops took up the ground floor openings, with dwellings above. But their lowness has a further aesthetic impact in that it exalts the stature ofthe four buildings that break through the arcade. Though the maidan was lined with cbandr trees and a waterchannel, no buildings intruded on the cleared space and itwas precisely this emptiness that allowed the maidan toplay so varied a role in the life of the city. In turn market place, training and parade ground, execution dock, polo pitch, open-air stage, running track and arena for animal combats, itwas amagnificently illuminated funfair by night and the inevitable setting for all kinds of royal entertainments. At the same time as he fixed the limits ofthe maidan Shah 'Abbas completedhis

plans for the facade by adding a monumental portal in the centre of each short side. These portals gave access to the Masjid-i Shah and the Qaisariyya bazaar respectively. With a concentrated corps debatiment on each of its four sides, the maidan could be interpreted as a gigantic version of the courtyard with four aivans which, found in mosques, madrasas, houses and caravansarais, maintained so tenacious a hold on

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
the imagination of Iranian architects. Only the 3: 1 ratio of long to short sides vitiates the comparison, and even this may have an explanation. It will be seen, looking northwards, that the portal of the Lutf-Allah mosque, with the 'All Qapu directly opposite, begins at one-third of the way along the facade, rather than just under halfway as the symmetry observed on the short sides would dictate. The presence of earlier structures may have prevented the shah from undertaking an entire transformation of the maidan and thus securing axial symmetry, and it perhaps encouraged the adoption of a more subtle systemof proportion. Indeed the length finally chosen for the maidan may have been determined by the desire tohave the mosque and palace placed one-third of the way down the long sides of the maidan, markedly and aristocratically removed from the world of commerce entered through
the Qaisariyya portal.1 That portal bears in its tiled spandrels the emblem ofSagittarius, under whose astrological influence Isfahan was founded. The same entrance complex contains faded frescoes depicting the wars of Shah 'Abbas with the Uzbeks. Its high galleries housed the naqqara-khana, where a consort of royal musicians played a daily cacophony whenever the shah was in residence. The vaulted bazaar which opens upwithin the portal is the finest example of the genre from the Safavid period and was erected from 1029/1619—20 onwards though no doubt planned two decades earlier; its climax is a great domed chahar-su, a feature which recurs in numerous later bazaars (e.g. Kashan and Qum). On the west side of the maidan stands the'All Qapu ("Sublime Porte") which formerly gave on to the royal gardens (fig. 7). In form it is a rectangle some 33 m. high, too low to be a cube, preceded by a broad portico crowned by a columned verandah ortdlar. Critics have found the junction of porch and palace proper maladroit and even absurd. Yet this istoignore aprime component of the design; for the building faced the maidan. It was necessarily facade architecture. It backed on walled private gardens and was not intended tobe viewed from behind. Moreover, its function largely determined its form. Like any modern office block it held scores of small rooms. The need to have them well lit and ventilated accounts for the lavish fenestration of the side facades, though the windows which overlooked the royal

harem were blocked from the outset. Each ofthe four upper floors is pierced by at least one deep bay. Faience spandrels and geometric window grilles variegate the busy articulation of multiple arched windows and niches. But while the main building with its six storeys looks weighty and monumental when seen from the back, the principal facade is made airy and insubstantial bythe columned talar, which takes up two entire storeys. There is even something lighthearted in combining forms as alien as the plshtaq and the talar in a single building, and in transporting the talar - traditionally a low, earth-bound architectural form - toapoint forty feet above ground. Despite these incongruities the 'All Qapu fulfils its role of royal grandstand to perfection. The shah could see and be seen and thus partake publicly ofthe life of his capital. The ancient traditions of the royal tribune and window ofappearances are thus given a new dress. Royal power and royal accessibility are alike stressed. Internally theground plan varies markedly from floor to floor. Certain areas are easily identified: the area for judicial and administrative functions below the talar; the reception hall, complete with water tank and fountain, attalar level; and the music room in the top storey with its fragile stucco surround for precious porcelain. Other rooms, however, areof uncertain function. Most of them arevery small,

though an illusion ofspace is granted by vaulting. Frescoes inseveral styles spread over the walls: some depict the languid youths and maidens popularised by Riza-yi 'AbbasI, while others develop a wonderfully unfettered idiom whose various elements - birds, clouds, trees, flowers — are originally ofChinese origin though long acclimatised in Persian miniature painting. Other designs reminiscent of carpet motifs are cut into the thin plaster skin of the walls in a sgraffiato technique found at Na'In. In decoration even more than in architecture the 'All Qapii must stand as an exemplar of the palatial building of its time. Such sanctity attached to the 'All Qapii in Safavid times that its threshold and doorway, which even the shah himself approachedon foot, was a sanctuary {bast) for fugitives. This sanctity was also expressed symbolically in the n o Portuguese cannon from Hurmuz ranged . 10 paces from either side ofthe portal: using abjadreckoning
this numbei yielded the name 'All.1 But it is above all the two mosques on the maidan that can justly claim to rank as the finest work of the time. Typically Safavid though their decoration is, in plan and elevation they are surprisingly original. Begun in ion/1602-3 and finished in 1028/1618-19, the Masjid-i Shaikh Lutf-Allah, or Masjid-i Sadr/Masjid-i Fath-Allah as it was earlier called, isthe earlier of the two and also the more unorthodox. The domed one-room sanctuary shorn ofa courtyard was by now a highly unusual form as a mosque, but it fits quite naturally into the long-established Timurid and Safavid tradition of large domed mausolea. Only the central sarcophagus ofsuch buildings is missing. This affiliation with mausolea is not the only curiosity. Much has been made of the bent entrance, and the oblique orientation of the dome chamber in relation to the maidan. One may also note the skewed relationship between aivan and dome. It is widely assumed that the two former irregularities were dictated by the need to orientate the mosque to the qibla. This is not entirely true. The aivan, for example, could lead without theleast deviation t o the west wall of the chamber, thereby rendering a bent entrance superfluous. Such lateral entrances to asanctuary chamber would have been nothing new in Persian architecture, though admittedly it is standard practice to site themain entrance opposite the mihrab. Since a dome chamber is virtually

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
devoid of a directional emphasis internally, and entirely so externally, this oblique orientation is a problem more apparent than real. Once inside the dome chamber one would nolonger beconscious of the maidan and therefore of any orientation problem, while the exterior cannot be said to be orientated ormisorientated vis-a-vis the square.It is only when one analyses the relationship between the aivan and the dome that a discord is apparent, and it ishighly significant that this discord is unnecessary. Had the dome chamber been shifted twenty metres to the north, aivan and dome would have been on a single axis and no significant alteration of the plan would have followed. Instead of this the architect did all he could to draw attention to the conflicting axes of the ensemble. Internally, the long passageway skirting the chamber, and its right-angled turn, underline the point. Externally it is the lack of correspondence between the aivan and the dome that reminds the viewer of the convergent axes at work. In the Masjid-i Shah the presence of a courtyard with the dome chamber necessarily on its qibla side automatically emphasised the shift of direction from the portal. Thus the architect there was absolved from straining topublicise thefact that maidan and mosque faced in different directions. Clearly the architects ofboth buildings were atpains toreveal, not to conceal, that the dues of Caesar conflicted with those of God. The layout itself may in fact be intended as a serious call to devotion. Shah 'Abbas built the Masjid-i Shaikh Lutf-Allah inhonour ofthe shaikh, who was his father-in-law, as aplace for private prayer, though it is extremely large and ostentatious for such a purpose (pi. 43a).A low portal with a central arch leads to the arched entrance. The tilework here is modern. Above it broods a low single-shell dome.Its external decoration incorporates a striking feature found elsewherein the mosque :the use of plain brick as aground for tilework. The effect is to create the optical illusion of buff-coloured tiles. In a designof arabesques superimposed on each other as in Safavid carpets the ubiquitous blue ofother Safavid domes is subordinate to buff, black and white. Once inside the building, the aesthetic purpose of the long, low, gloomy passage leading to the dome chamber becomes evident, for it is with a sense of heightened anticipation that one enters the sanctuary. Lowness gives way to soaring height and gloom is dispelled by the steady illumination of nearly a score of windows. In all Persian architecture no more perfectly balanced interior comes to mind (pi. 43^). Much ofthis harmony is due tothe dovetailing of
785



SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
architectural and decorative accents. This concern isalready apparent in the horizontal carpet designs of the tiled dado. Above this eight huge arches carry the circular drum onwhich the dome rests. Each arch is outlined in a turquoise cable moulding ofelectric brightness, and further outlined by a broad double-decker inscription band executed in dazzling white on an indigo ground. Two more such bands mark the upper and lower limits of the collar, which isfilledby thirty-two arched panels. These are alternately blind and fitted with arabesque grilles to filter the sunlight. The entire surface of the dome is covered with anetwork of curvilinear lozenges executed in plain brick and diminishing in size as they approach the apex of the dome, a deliberate distortion of perspective which makes it seem higher still. Each lozenge contains atiled floral design. This novel pattern may be seen asa deliberate reduction into two dimensions of the sculptural complexity ofa muqarnas vault. Yet the light and dark accents of its tilework are sosituated that they create a series of concentric circles which act as a counterpoint to the main theme, the net of lozenges - a subtlety impossible inamuqarnas vault. Apredominantly white sunburst design with a filigree ofblue arabesques reigns supreme at the apex of the dome, like the sun in the firmament. Asovereign harmony controls the individual patterns of this interior, many of which are designed to beread indifferent ways depending on the viewer's distance from them. Details sharpen into precise focus orblur into some larger pattern. A similar harmony rules the elevation. Gone is the hectic piling-up of tiny vaults which characterised Timurid zones of transition and many Timurid domes. A principle of successive subdivision gives place toone ofassimilation and simplification, so that the elevation resolves itself into large serene surfaces — arches, drum, dome — whose function the mind can readily grasp. The time scale of this decoration is suggested by two inscriptions: one, at the base of the dome, is dated 1025/1616 and the other, in the mihrab, is the signature of the builder (bannd')Muhammad Riza b. Husain, dated 1028/1619. The portal originally bore two inscriptions, one of 1011/1602—3 and
the other of 1012/1603-4; the latter is signed by 'All Riza al-'Abbasi.1 The quality of serenity, the confident marshalling of large spaces, manifested in the Lutf-Allah mosque, dominates the Masjid-i Shah

too. Its construction, the work ofUstad 'All Akbar al-Isfahanl, under the direction of the master of works, Muhibb 'All Kika Lala, spans about twenty years. Work began with the portal, which was started in 1021/1612—13 and completed in 1025/1616, according to an inscription signed by 'AH Riza al-'AbbasI. Only in 1026/1617-18 did building on the mosque proper begin, and the date of 1040/1630 on the west aivan probably marks the end ofmajor construction work onthe mosque, though the marble dadoes (mentioned in an inscription written by Muhammad Riza al-Imami) were not installed before c. 1048/1638. This is a remarkably long period for an age in which the monarch was accustomed to seeing buildings completed within a year or two of being started. Popular tradition explains the delay by telling of the architect who, realising that the shah's impatience to be finished was imperilling the safety of the mosque, since the foundations needed time to settle, disappeared for five years after taking measurements and reappeared todemonstrate that the foundations had indeed sunk. It is of course entirely naive to suppose that building would have ceased in the interim, and, besides, even twenty years is remarkably long for a project so central to the royal plans for Isfahan. Moreover, the mosque was indeed shoddily built inplaces, especially inits foundations, and has required extensive repair over theyears (though it should be mentioned that subsidence has never been noted as a problem in the rocky and sandy terrain ofthe Isfahan area, and that foundations that have not been loaded have by that token not been tested). The reason
for this1 long building campaign seems to lierather in the unprecedented size ofthe mosque and inthe unusually imposing form ofits subordinate parts, though not all of these date from the reign ofShah 'Abbas. Essentially it is afour-aivan mosque and thus accords with the classical tradition of Persian Islamic architecture. But at every turn variations inthe familiar schema meet the eye. East and west aivans lead into domed chambers, a layout customarily reserved for the qibla side alone. The sanctuary complex includes long eight-domed winter prayer halls on either side of the main dome. Minarets crown not only the portal but also the qibla aivan. Afurther arcaded courtyard used for latrines opens offto the south-east of the vestibule via a domed quincunx. Perhaps the most unexpected addition, however, isthe pair of custom-built madrasas flanking the sanctuary complex. Identicalin form, each comprises along narrow courtyard enlivened by pools and trees and bordered by arcades which are deeper on the sides adjoining
787



SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
the sanctuary complex. Diminutive aivans at the centre of each short side reinforce the axial emphasis ofthe courtyard itself. They exhibit the same urge for symmetry that marks the rest ofthe mosque, giving it anexterior almost asstreamlined asthe interior layout. All these extra refinements were prodigal ofspace, which accounts for the huge plan area of the mosque and itsdependencies — the whole measures some 140 m. x 130 m. at its greatest extent, while shorn of its entrance complex itstill attains some 100 m. X 130 m. This royal mosque, with its multiple functions, in many ways harks back to the huge mosques of early Islam which served as an emblem of the Islamic community and its life. Primarily, ofcourse, this impression ofsize depends on the actual dimensions. No other Persian mosque has adouble dome c. 52 m. high (some 14 m. above the inner dome), and the broad court, nearly 70 m. across, was a device enthusiastically copied by Qajar architects, especially those of Fath 'All Shah. The sanctuary aivan is made to seem larger still because its flanking arcades are ofone storey instead oftwo like the arcades on the other sides of the court. Similarly, the dimensions of the portal aivan (27.5 m. high) aremagnified bythe wings which project from each side. This device ensures that whoever enters the mosque does so not precipitately but with a proper sense of anticipation. The mosque projects its sanctity well beyond the portal, welcoming the worshipper inside, and thus there is ample time for the aivan to assert its presence gradually. The same concern with selected viewpoints ensures that subsidiary areas of the elevation are neglected, such as the rear of the entrance portal and the lateral facades ofthe west aivan. Many such surfaces are left inplain brick and their haphazard elevation isclear proof that in constructing vistas some Iranian architects, at least, did not have multiple viewpoints in mind. Nevertheless, it is hard to think of another building in the Islamic world with a polychrome splendour so rich and uniform asthis, the reflections of the facades gleaming with redoubled effect inthe extensive ablutions pool. Apart from the entrance portal, constructed when time and money were plentiful, the ceramic decoration which predominates (marbleis used for dadoes and stone for pillars inthe winter prayer halls) is of overglaze painted tiles (haft-rangt), an understandable and practical economy given the huge surfaces to be covered. Dazzling though it is in strong sunlight, this tilework shows to poorer effect in the sanctuary

chamber and worst of all when seen at close quarters in the vaulting of the winter prayer halls. Subsequent architects took to heart the evident lesson that large painted tiles are an unsuitable medium for decorating
these domical and pseudo-ribbed vaults.1 These two great mosques mark the apogee of Safavid architecture. Although neither introduces any striking new feature intothe repertory of forms and techniques, both reshuffle familiar elements into unexpected patterns. They show a concern for outward splendour that was still unusual in Persian mosque architecture, and which no doubt springs from their presence on the maidan. It says much for the architecture of this period that two such ambitious mosques so fundamentally different from each other could have been raised side by side and almost simultaneously. Their location in full view of all at the heart of one of the most prestigious capitals ofthe contemporary world made it inevitable that they should exert a dominant influence on subsequent Safavid architecture. Even when this influence cannot be traced in extenso, the basic emphasis on a lofty dome and on the sheathing of surfaces in haft-rangl tiles remained. The best oflater Safavid buildings are, nevertheless, far more orthodox than these mosques, while in the many lesser mosques and madrasas erected in 17th-century Isfahan no very marked individual style can be detected. It could well be said that Safavid architecture had shot its bolt with the mosques on the maidan, for almost without exception the best later work is in the secular field. The devotion of Shah 'Abbas to Isfahan has tended to obscure his major contributions to the major shrines of the country, notably Mashhad, Turbat-i Jam, Ardabil, Mahan and Qum. His work at Mashhad was on amore lavish scale than elsewhere, and extended to buildings other than the shrine, notably the mausoleum of Khwaja Rabl' (1030/1620). It isrecorded that he made the pilgrimage from Isfahan to Mashhad on foot, and that after he had delivered the city (permanently) from the Uzbek threat in 1006/1597 he entered the shrine unshod to give thanks. Subsequently he encouraged his people to visit this shrine rather than Mecca, possibly for commercial reasons. A complex tangle ofpersonal, devotional, political and economic motives may therefore have actuated his work on the shrine. Unlike

Isfahan, Mashhad did not allow him a free hand and thus his contributions to the shrine must be assessed piecemeal rather than as a unity (fig. 8). His order of 1010/1601 that the shrine be restored would lead one to expect traces of his handiwork sporadically throughout the complex, and indeed his name is associated with or found on the north aivan of the Masjid-i Gauhar Shad, the Balasar madrasa (repaired by his general Allah Qull Khan), the east andwest aivans in the Sahn-i Kuhna, the chambers of AUahvardl Khan (1021/1612) and Hatim Khan

(1010/1601), the Khiyaban and the redecorated dome chamber ofthe Imam himself. Of these the crucial elements are the Khiyaban and the chamber of AllahvardI Khan. The Khiyaban, divided by the Old Court (which nevertheless continues the same axis) into an"upper" and "lower" section, traverses the entire length of the shrine at its northern extremity, and totals about 200 m.in length. A watercourse, a section of the great qanat provided forthe city byMir 'All Shir, runs through itscentre. The scale of the undertaking (made even more remarkable by the fact that the area was densely built-up), its bold simplicity, and the use of water as an integral part of the design, all have affinities with the much larger project ofthe Chahar Bagh. Flanked on either side by shops, the two halves of the Khiyaban mediate between theshrine and theouter world. They also impose order on and knit together the otherwise illassorted northern fagade ofthe shrine and thus provide afittingand dignified approach to the Sahn-i Kuhna, the finest courtyard of the shrine proper. The east and west aivans of this courtyard, along the axis of the watercourse, are also due to Shah 'Abbas, and here again the themes later taken up at Isfahan make their first appearance. In sheer scale both aivans challenge the portal aivans of the Masjid-i Shah at Isfahan and, unlike that aivan, fulfil a double function :not only do they serve asthe formal entrances to the shrine, but they also act askey components of the Sahn-i Kuhna, marking the centre of each short side. The sequence of large and small bays, of solids and voids, adopted in this inner facade is unique. The approach tothe dome chamber of AllahvardI Khan is rather unpromising, for Qajar additions have cast into permanent gloom an entrance aivan designed for sunlight. Yet the modest size ofthis portal, and the exterior ofthe dome itself, with its shallow profile and plain surface formerly crowned bya diminutive domed belvedere, show clearly enough that the building was intended primarily as an interior. Like the mausoleum ofOljeitii at Sultaniyya, from which it may derive, it is an octagon throughout until the springing of the dome, an unusual feature for large domed buildings in Iran. Both structures also share a marked emphasis on lighting and a preference for articulating the interior walls by deep arched recesses. The Safavid chamber, however, owes its intensity not to architecture so much as to decoration, for almost every available surface is covered in tilework. The head of each recess iscrowned with cascading stalactites and they also encrust part of the dome. These broken surfaces and

deep bays reflect light at every turn, while thetilework itself is spangled with tiny bright flowers, each one apinpoint of light against the dark ground. Within each bay subdivisions are multiplied into a complex array of rectangular and arched panels, each different from its neighbour in outline and in the design or colour of its field. Net vaults of Timurid type constitute the transition zone, and the choice ofthis device accords with thefragmented nature of the individual parts within the grand design. Amidst a singularly rich repertoire ofliving
creatures "birds of paradise" dominate.1 Rectangular inscription bands frame the lower arches and provide much-needed continuity. It would be hard to discover in Safavid architecture amore concentrated display of tilework so enhanced by an original elevation. In 1021/1612 Shah 'Abbas visited the Ardabll shrine, to whichhe donated the royal porcelain collection, and various alterations tothe shrine itself were made in his name from this time on, though a door dated 1011/1602-3 shows that work was already being carried out earlier inhis reign. His principal contribution was the redecoration in
1037/1627-8 of the Dar al-Huffaz, a 14th-century foundation.2 The treatment is unusual for a shrine, for it uses exclusively the techniques of gilding, plaster ornament and painting commonly associated with Safavid palaces. The Chinlkhana, long regarded as entirely constructed under Shah 'Abbas, has a structure as early as the 14th century though the interior decoration, including the dado of haft-rangl tiles andof course the entire architectural surround for the porcelain (again derived from palatial models such as the 'All Qapu?), is of the early 17th century. The inner dome is unusual in that itcontinues the net vaulting of the "pendentives" as a decorative motif, so that the entire surfaceis criss-crossed with lozenge and stellar forms. Fresco paintings and carved and relief stucco in an idiom reminiscent of rocaille fill most of these panels. Again this ornament is painted and gilded. At Mahan too the work of Shah 'Abbas is intermingled with that of earlier and later generations. To the west of the 15th-century dome chamber of Shah Ni'mat-Allah, which was the nucleus of the shrine and which he restored in 1010/1601, he added a covered gallery (dar al-huffaz) and an adjoining courtyard. The long corridors thus created carry transverse vaults of the type encountered inthe oratories of the

Yazd Jami', which provide a structural skeleton embellished by a matchless assembly of cupolas and oculi of stellar design (pi. 42). When viewed as a continuous series, their different patterns mingle like those of a kaleidoscope in the fluid transition from one bay to the next. The dazzling white plaster finish perfectly complements these precise abstract designs; colour would be superfluous. The lower part of the gallery is, despite subsequent repairs, readily datable by inscriptions to 998/1589-90, and the vaults are probably contemporary with this, even though they are closely paralleled in the Qajar sections of the shrine, such as the Vakil mosque, which were built at a time when spectacular vaulting, as demonstrated in the bazaars of Qum, Kashan and Kirman itself, was especially fashionable. Simpler forms ofthese probably Safavid vaults had long been established in southern Iran, while the use of pure white vaulting in cultic buildings had an equally long history. Moreover, the vaulted bays in the lower parts of the western gallery exploit the contrast between plain white stalactite vaults, lightly sprinkled with tiled insets, and the intense polychromy of tiled dadoes. Such tiled insets are adistinctively Timurid feature which might well have continued into Safavid times but would be surprising at amuch later date. The evidence therefore favours a Safavid date, though more detailed discussion of the Mahan vaults must await a full monographic account of the shrine. Other decorative features include floral frescoes in the lower vaults and — inglaze - window grilles and inscribed
cartouches.1 Apart from the great shrine complexes the outstanding Safavid ensemble in the provinces isthe mosque, madrasa and caravansarai of
Ganj 'All Khan, the governor of Kirman under Shah 'Abbas (fig.cj).z The inscriptions date the work to 1007/1598, though it was probably begun as early as 996/15 87, and are the work of the celebrated calligrapher 'All Riza-yi 'Abbasl. The ensemble comprises arectangular plaza (100 m. x 50 m.) with atwo-storey building, probably a caravansarai (dimensions 55 m. x 53 m.), on its east side, a small mosque adjoining it and two bazaars facing each other across the square: a Maidan-i Shah in miniature? The bazaars comprise a series of adjacent shops each consisting of a deep domed bay, and are linked by a similar line of shops on the west side of the maidan. An impressive 12-sided chahar-su with deep radiating niches takes up the south-west corner of the com

plex. An octagonal cistern or reservoir (J>au%) with radiating dome chambers on each of its eight sides was also added to an earlier hamrnam already comprising numerous octagonal structures and adjoining the southern bazaar. Opposite the bath on the other side of the maidan is a square darabkhana to which a large vestibule gives access. Numerous portals led to these various structures. The whole was made vaqf in 1008/1599 and again in Rajab 1024/July 1615. Apart from the bath, a very complex affair of half a dozen major elements whose chronology has yet to be established, the most remarkable element in this complex is the caravansarai, which conforms so little to the norm for this genre that it has tentatively been identified as a madrasa. It would, however, be an equally exceptional specimen of that genre too. No two sides are symmetrical or even of equal depth, and the presence of numerous rooms of uneven size and layout is hard to parallel in any public

building of the period. Especially puzzling is the densely planned multi-chambered area between the courtyard and the maidan. More functions could be suggested for these various chambers, however, in the context of an urban caravansarai (with itsrequirement forwarehouses and secure chambers for valuable goods) than of a madrasa.In the portal spandrels of this building isa series of chinoiserie themesin niched oval medallions (themselves a Chinese feature) or amidst arabesque scrolls. Dragons and phoenixes fight while cranesand Chinese clouds act as spacefillers. Other motifs include jackals, mountain sheep and felines bringing down gazelles, a repertory borrowed directly from contemporary carpets. Strangest of all, however, is the winged angel carrying a baby with a lion looking upwards from below, presumably a reference to 'All (who was commonly termed haidar, "lion"). Among Safavid madrasas theMadrasa-yi Khan in Shiraz, built between 1024/1615 and 1036/1627 by a certain Husain Samma'I, is on several counts perhaps themost interesting. It is theonly Safavid madrasa which has been subjected" to a detailed historical and functional scrutiny (through its published vaqf-nama) as well as to a thorough architectural analysis. Itdemonstrates that the best work in the provinces yielded nothing to that of the capital. Indeed, some of its details, like the fine stereotomy of its dadoes, itsdragon carving in stone, above all the tilework of its vestibule, show avital and original local style. Lastly, it provides ample evidence that the emphasis on sheer size (the madrasa measures c. 82 m. X c. 69 m.) which so often recurs in the buildings of Isfahan was by no means confined to that city or to royal foundations, though it is no doubt significant thatthe patrons here were AllahvardI Khan and his son Imam Quli, successively governors of Fars and both high in the royal favour. The layout displays numerous asyet unexplained variations onearlier madrasas. While the standard four-aivan plan is employed, the general lack of symmetry within this framework is marked. Only the north and south sides agree, with their two storeys of student cells. The communal areas of the plan, including the vaulted apsidal aivan which is the cynosure of the whole building, are to the east rather than on the qibla side or within the entrance complex as atKhargird. Moreover, there is no separate mosque; the south-western aivan, located atright anglesto the entrance, fulfils this function. Within the entrance complexare groups of rooms opening off central corridors, many ofthem difficult

of access. In all its essential features theupper storey echoes the
arrangement of the lower.1 The works of Shah 'Abbas constitute a kind ofterminus. No later shah erected atithe of the buildings which may justifiably be laid to his credit. Instead, the pattern of later building which emerges consistently is ofrepairs and embellishments to existing monuments. Chardin was right: when Shah 'Abbas the Great ceased to breathe, Persia ceasedto
prosper.2 The dramatic fall in the quantity, scale and - to some extent — quality of architecture after his reign justifies a somewhat summary treatment of later work. This approach is most thoroughly vindicated in dealing with the output of the immediate successor of'Abbas, Shah Safl. In his thirteenyear reign his principal achievement in the field ofarchitecture seems to have been the modest mosques built at Shahristan and Turbat-i Haidariyya; he seems also to have contributed to the gardens of Saflabad and Fin. In Isfahan he repaired the Imamzada Isma'Il and the tomb of Baba Qasim, and completed the mausoleum ofBaba Rukn al-DIn. He also put some ofthe finishing touches tothe Masjid-i Shah. New buildings inthe city included the Masjid-i Aqa Nur (1039/1629) and the Madrasa-yi Mulla 'Abd-Allah. Shah 'Abbas II was a much more zealous builder and at least two undisputed masterpieces inIsfahan - the Chihil Sutun palace and the Khaju bridge - can be attributed to him. Among other buildingsof high quality for which he was responsible one may cite theTalar Ashraf and Masjid-i Hakim in Isfahan and, in part, the Qadamgah near NIshapur. Restoration work or new building was carried out onthe shrines of Ardabll, Qum and Mashhad and on the Friday mosquesof Kirman, Gurgan and Qazvln as well as on numerous smaller mosques and shrines. He also added the marble dadoes and great door ofthe Masjid-i Shah. Finally, inIsfahan itself some fine smaller cultic buildings were put up during his reign: the Armenian church ofthe Holy Sisters (actually in Julfa), the Masjid-i MisrI, the Masjid-i Saru TaqI, the Madrasa-yi Jadda Buzurg and the Madrasa-yi Jadda Kuchak. The Chihil Sutun is deservedly the most famous of Persian palaces, perhaps because it isone ofthe few to have kept its original garden ambknte (figs ioa,b). Thus some flavour ofthe festive, hedonistic lifestyle celebrated there still lingers. The prospect over the ornamental

lake, closed by an axial pavilion, is integral to the architecture. Formerly the royal gardens were strewn with palaces of this kind, each drawing much of its individual quality from its surroundings. Such a tradition is at least as old as Hadrian's Tivoli palace and is found throughout the Muslim world, in Samarqand, Edirne and Granada. Kaempfer's map ofthe royal garden precinct at Isfahan gives a vivid impression of such landscape architecture (figs i la, £).' But ifthe general tradition from which these garden palaces sprang is clear,the specific antecedents of the Chihil Sutun type are difficult to determine. Parallels are commonly drawn with the hypostyle palaces of Persepolis and with the talar of the typical Caspian house, but neither is very convincing. Paradoxically, despite itstrabeate form it owes more to Sasanian palaces than to any other traceable source, for the deep recessed central bay leading to the throne room operates just like a Sasanian aivan. Like many other Safavid palaces, the Chihil Sutun has a deliberately unstable and impermanent air. Its eighteen pillars, seemingly as thin as matchsticks, seem preposterously inadequate to bear the burden of the apparently massive flat roof. There is anelement of hyperbole here which finds expression indifferent terms inother Islamic palaces such as Saljuq Qubazabad orIl-Khanid Soghurluq/Saturiq, and is evoked by thevery title of Chihil Sutun - "many" rather than "forty" columns; the theory that the name refers to the reflections of these columns inthe water is surely apicturesque fantasy. Like the 'All Qapu, however, this palace offers an aspect of foursquare solidity from its sides and rear which isvery different from its frail and insubstantial facade. Long bays some 5 m.deep open along the lateral fagades and each is punctuated by four columns. Niches with frescoes of courtly scenes break the recessed wall behind. In contrast to the main facade the rear wall presents asolid mass of masonry in which the principal break is the rear entrance. This, like allthe other entrances, is stepped, for the palace is placed on aplatform. The internal layout is readily grasped and has none of the bewildering complexities of the 'All Qapu. Three major spatial units are set side by side: the talar leads into a throne room which in turn gives onto themain hall. Subsidiary chambers on the pattern ofthe 'All Qapu flank the throne room on its short and the main hall on its long side. Thus spacious and

intimate units alternate and interact in a design of admirable compactness. They have a rich fresco decoration which recycles the threadbare repertoire of courtly scenes in the painting of Riza-yi 'Abbas! - vapid youths and maidens halfheartedly dallying and drinking in a landscape of eternal spring.

Most of this decoration is given an architectural quality by the division of the ceiling into a grid of recessed panels, a technique earlier used in medieval vaults. Multitiered stalactite capitals, again a familiar medieval form, mediate between the columns and the roof. If the talar seems somewhat bare and echoing now, in its heyday bright curtains were hung between the

columns and the floor was strewn with carpets on which courtiers reclined to watch the dancing girls frolic. The other great masterpiece of this reign is the Khaju bridge, erected on the foundations of a Timurid bridge at the royal command, probably by the shah's general Hasan Beg, in 1060/1650 and named after a nearby quarter ofthe city (pi. 44^). Though less than half the length of the bridge of AllahvardI Khan (132 m. as against c. 300 m.)it is lent a more imposing air by the massive octagonal pavilion which straddles it in mid-stream, and juts out on both sides like a prow. Moreover, unlike its predecessor the Khaju bridge rests on a high stone platform which to the east shelves down to the river in aseries of shallow steps broken by sluices, while to the west spear-shaped contreforts break the river's flow. This podium on which the superposed arcades of the bridge rest transforms the structure into amassive three

side. The lowest section serves as aweir which atits widest reaches 26 m.; when the sluices are closed the level of the river rises by some two metres. The central pavilion is simply a typical Safavid pleasure palace incorporated into a utilitarian structure. From this peerless vantage point the shah could watch aquatic sports, mock naval battles, water polo and regattas, while the inner rooms gave him the opportunity to retire in private when he wished. Nondescript modern tilework and stencilled carpet designs have replaced the gilded paintwork and moral saws which formerly graced these rooms. In itslocation the bridge testifies to the same careful planning as does its design. Itis athwart the old road toShlraz, it provided conveniently quick access tothe Zoroastrian quarter and thus effectively kept the Zoroastrians off the Chahar Bagh, and finally itcontinues the axis of the east side of the maidan.A
now vanished covered bazaar linked maidan and bridge.1 Among the many mosques erected by high officials ofthe Safavid court in the 17th century the Masjid-i Hakim is outstanding alike for its size and for the splendour and extent of its ornament. It was erected in 1067/1656 with funds sent from India by the court physician of Shah 'Abbas II,Muhammad Da'ud Hakim, who had fled to the Mughal court after incurring his master's wrath bycertain intrigues. Several later dates occurring inthe unusually rich epigraphy —1069/165 8—9, 1071/1660—1 and 1073/1662—3 —suggest that the 1067/1656-7 date refers only to the completion of construction work onthe mosque. These inscriptions were written by the finest calligrapher ofthe day, Muhammad Riza al-Imaml. The classical formula of courtyard with axial aivans linked by two-tier arcades and with a domed sanctuary is realised on agenerous scale. While lengthy Qur'anic inscriptions from suras ii, xvii, xlvand lxii are used within the aivans and dome chamber, thecourtyard facade consists largely of sacred names in square Kufic forming ingenious patterns. The virtual absence of floral motifs is marked. This decorative scheme is notable for its avoidance of overall revetment, for it is conceived as an assembly of separate panels framed against aplain brick ground. The general effect is not of a continuously tiled surface, as in the Masjid-i Shah, but of a predominantly brick building enlivened by touches of colour. Architectural values are begin

ning to reassert themselves. Structurally the most interesting feature of the mosque is its qibla side. In the aivan preceding the dome chamber, for example, a shallow stalactite vault is suddenly resolved into an ornamental and two-dimensional squinch netetched onto the plain smooth surface ofthe vault. The plastic configurations ofa full-scale stalactite vault are decisively rejected in favour of a smooth and indeed comparatively plain surface. Similar concerns govern the layout of the dome chamber. This owes much to the Lutf -Allah mosque in its virtual removal of the transition zone in favour of a ring of eight arches occupying the lower elevation, but the arches on the diagonals are much smaller than those on theprincipal axes and kite-shaped forms (not pendentives as they are sometimes called) are needed to fill the huge spandrels thus created. Three mihrabs and a minbar suffic
iently emphasise the importance of this mosque.1 In the field of religious architecture about half ofthe work associated with Shah 'Abbas II is found in Isfahan, and while a few new foundations arerecorded elsewhere (Vazir mosque, Kashan, 1055/ 1645; Friday Mosque, Sarm, 1062/165 0 most of the dated work in the provinces consists of repairs and additions to existing structures - e.g. the Mashhad shrine (1057/1647) or the Qadamgah near Nlshapur (founded 1020/1611 and refurbished 1053/1643), adorned octagon of the same general type as some of the 16th-century mausolea discussed above; whereas the activity in Isfahan includes many new buildings, of which three madrasas and at least eight mosques survive. This situation persisted throughout thereign of his successors, the last two Safavid monarchs. Neither secular nor cultic architecture saw any significant advances in the last half-century ofSafavid rule. Instead the trend was towards the retrospective. The major monuments erected by Shah Sulaiman are again secular, not religious — perhaps because the commanding location and scale of the mosques onthe maidan, and the presence of a hoary jami', discouraged major cultic buildings. Among the palaces the Hasht Bihisht ("Eight Paradises") of 1080/1669 is paramount (fig.
13a).2 The very name, a common one for gardens in Iran, isevocative, though perhaps a more worldly paradise is intended, forthe palace houses eight intimate pavilions. Its layout is a triumph of compactness,

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
although paradoxically the first impression is one of untrammelled space. On the principal axes huge talars open, extending up to roof level, so that from every part of the building views of the surrounding gardens impinge (fig. i$b). These talars are set off by sturdy polygonal corner turrents, each of which holds acomplex of rooms and stairways on two storeys. Thus the private chambers of the palace and the access to them are managed within the corner blocks which carry the whole edifice. Intensively exploited areas thereby alternate with markedly open ones, while an octagonal pool with afountain symbolically brings nature right into the building, a conceit repeated atthe 'All Qapu and the Chihil Sutun. The rather unsightly pitched roof gives no hint that it covers a huge and spectacular muqarnas vault pierced at its apex in Timurid fashion by a high drum with an inner dome. This oculusis brilliantly lit by eight windows. Like theChihil Sutun, theHasht Bihisht rests on a stone-faced platform as high as a man and ascended by axial stairways, each different from the next. It is hard not to see here, as atthe Chihil Sutun, a faint echo of an ancient Iranian tradition whereby palaces were raised on platforms and thus symbolically removed beyond the ken of the common man. The impact of the original decoration is now lost beyond recall, for over the years the building fell victim to neglect and to the misguided attentions of Qajar craftsmen whose mirrorwork and frescoes completely transformed it. But surviving parts of the original scheme (e.g. in some ofthe reception rooms on the second floor) go far to justify Chardin's panegyrics. Following an Iranian tradition for which early Islamic as well as Safavid parallels may be cited, thevarious little rooms are vaulted and ornamented insubtly different ways but beara strong family likeness. Quite small rooms are given an illusion of size by the use of several adjoining vaulted areas. These are broken up into multiple facets which effortlessly blend into each other, and are, as Herbert would say, "pargetted with azure and gold". The decorative repertoire has a chinoiserie flavour already encountered in the 'All Qapu. Externally the accent was on tilework, some ofwhich survives in the spandrels of the blind arches. Hunting scenes prevail. These are treated ina style akin tocontemporary book painting, with the antinaturalistic colour schemes of that medium. Thus green stags flee across ayellow ground punctuated by blue trees. Much simpler inplan is the other important late Safavid palace to survive in Isfahan, the Talar Ashraf, which may date from c. 1690. It

comprises a central pavilion, roofed with a groined vault, and a smaller room on each side, a disposition already found in the rear part of the Chihil Sutun. Three aivans knit together the facade. Inside, the stalactite vaulting is of the same type as that of the Hasht Bihisht, but the minutely worked stucco is something of a novelty.

Several important madrasas were built or repaired in the reignof Shah Sulaiman. In the Mashhad shrine, forexample, which also received other embellishments at this time, inscriptions record repairs in the Dii Dar (1088/1677), Parizad (1091/1680) and Balasar (1091/1680) madrasas (fig. 8). In Isfahan the Madrasa-yi Mulla 'Abd-Allah, which was probably built in the early 17th century, was in its time, according to Chardin, "le plus grand etle plus riche college [sic] d'Ispahan" which says little forthe standard of the forty-eight others, since it is somewhat humdrum. Itbears a vaqf text of 1088/1677-8 recording the endowment of shops for the building. It iscustomary toconfine any discussion of the last quarter-century of Safavid architecture toa single group ofmonuments — the bazaar, caravansarai and madrasa on the Chahar Bagh. Summary though this approach is, itis broadly speaking justifiable. The reign of Shah Sultan Husain saw dated work, whether of construction or repair, carried out on something over thirty buildings, slightly less than inthe previous reign and roughly comparable to the amount of work carried out under Shah 'Abbas II. But very little of this total represents new work. A mihrab inthe Gurgan Jami' (1108/1696), an aivan inthat of Dizful (1110/1698), multiple repairs - e.g. to the Imamzada Isma'Il at Isfahan between 1100/1688-9 and 1115/1703, to the Chihil Sutun, and tothe tomb of Khwaja Rabf (1119/1707) - these do not add up to a volume of work large enough to permit a final judgment. With the odd exception (e.g. the Friday Mosque of Chashum, 1105/1694, the nearby Faslhiyya madrasa in Sabzavar, 1124/1712, or the tomb of Sahl b. 'AH at Arak, 1110/1698) such new buildings as were erected were restrictedto Isfahan. They include the mosque and bath of'AH Qull Agha, both of 1122/1710, the Madrasa-yi Sadr, the Madrasa-yi Shamsabad, founded by the merchant Muhammad Mahdl in 1125/1713, the Madrasa-yi Kasahgaran (1105/1694) and the Madrasa-yi NImavard. The latter, built by one Zainab Begum in 1117/1705—6, isan ambitious building with a monumental tiled portal and a courtyard with bevelled corners like the Khargird madrasa. But the scale of these foundations is too modest, and their decoration too banal, to offer any insight into the quality of the best work produced under royal patronage at this time. For such an insight one can study only the complex of buildings on the Chahar Bagh: the Madar-i
Shah madrasa, caravansarai and bazaar (pi. 44^,fig.14).l

They arean entirely unexpected return to thegrandiose planning of Shah 'Abbas I, andtogether these three buildings may claim torepresent the principal achievement ofSafavid architecture after the 1630s. A less likely patron than thefeeble and dilatory Shah Sultan Husain can scarcely be imagined. But if the scale and ambition ofthe project are noteworthy, no less significant is its dependence on earlier Safavid models. Shortly before the dynasty was extinguished the familiar elements ofits architecture are reshuffled on a large scale for the last time. But the result, though fine, cannot claim to be an unusually original creation. Its merits liein theserene andrational disposition of the three constituent units. The madrasa and caravansarai are orientated along the same dueeastward axis, marked by the entrance portal of the madrasa and continued in the pools of both buildings, pools which extend even to the stables closing offthe complex at the east end. It will beseen that the elaborate shifts to ensure anaccurate qibla in the maidan arenotpursued here andthemihrab wall of the dome chamber points, inaccurately, due south. Presumably Shah Sultan Husain, for all his piety, lacked theresolution to break with the long-established axes of the Chahar Bagh and the maidan, while tradition made it virtually impossible toplace the sanctuary chamber inthe south-west diagonal of the building. In fact, the madrasa bears all the marks of a blueprint

conceived on a drawing board and executed without special reference to its setting. Its plan is so similar to that of the adjoining caravansarai that it is tempting to regard them as the work of one man. Seldom has the flexibility ofthe four-aivan plan been more clearly demonstrated. Nevertheless, within this broad schema both buildings possess somewhat unusual features. The madrasa lacks a large lecture hall and instead has polygonal, usually niched, chambers opening onthe axes and diagonals (pi. 45a). It ishard tosuggest a specific function for so many such chambers. Those on the bevelled diagonals are repeated at first floor level. The intervening areas onboth floors are filled with narrow double cells. A pathway and a pool divide the courtyard into four miniature gardens, perhaps intended as a graceful echo of the wider Chahar Bagh outside (pi. 45^). Aesthetically the madrasa's arcades are a happy compromise between the plainness ofthe maidan arcades and the somewhat oppressive overall tilework of those in the Masjid-i Shah. Their interiors are whitewashed, with vaulting lines picked out in blue, while their court facades are tiled. The dome chamber, on the other hand, is in elevation soclose a copy of the great dome of the Masjid-i Shah that they are readily confused. But while the later architect might strive to emulate the earlier achievement, he could add nothing to it — anapt commentary onthe relationship betweenthe earlier and the later period. Only the tilework shows amarked decline from the standards ofthe 1620s, which themselves were not unduly high. Floral tile mosaic is almost entirely absent and muqarnas compositions, where large tiles are impracticable, are replaced by chequerwork. Coarse, indeed rather primitive, geometrical designs are frequent and are not improved by an unpleasant custard yellow which invades the colour scheme. Nevertheless, the madrasa may fairly claim to bethe finest building of its kind in the country apart from the Madrasa-yi Ghiyasiyya atKhargird (pi. 28). To the north the bazaar knits together the two larger buildings. It comprises a single broad corridor some 220 m.in length bordered symmetrically onboth sides by multiple arcades. For the first eighty metres these open into deep recesses for shops and thereafter into shallow booths. The division between the two types of recess coincides with the eastern perimeter of the madrasa. The deeper recesses on the madrasa side serve to conceal the fact that the madrasa and the caravansarai are notharmoniously aligned to their northern end; and they ensure that the arterial passage inthe bazaar runs asstraight as a die.

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
The back walls ofthe southern recesses are contiguous with those of the madrasa and the caravansarai, thus permitting the back wall in each case to serve two buildings. Oddly enough no such continuity exists between the two larger buildings on the east-west axis, so that they are separated for their length by a narrow passage. Its function may have been toinsulate the madrasa from noise within the caravansarai. The income from the bazaar and caravansarai was intended for the upkeep of the madrasa, and thesize of the latter goes far to explain the spacious scale of the other two projects. Particularly noteworthy are the huge rectangular stables, now vanished, which ranalmost the entire length of the caravansarai on the east side. Equally unusual is the placing ofaivans on the entrance axis alone, while the east and west sides are marked only by an enlarged bay which does not even embrace both floors. But, as with the madrasa and bazaar, the scale is impressive and the planning is meticulous and rational to thelast detail. The confident marshalling of such large forms was aheritage bequeathedto Zand and Qajar architects and is arguably the great strength of Persian architecture in post-Safavid times. The Safavid period has left a legacy ofwall painting incomparably richer than the sum total which survives from previous periods. Most of it decorates palaces, though an important undated cycle of battle and hunting scenes adorns the upper part of the Bazaar Gate in Isfahan. Its relatively public subject matter is entirely appropriate to itslocation. The twomajor bridges in Isfahan also carry painted decorative schemes, but these are of minor interest only, while the paintings in the Hasht Bihisht, in contradistinction toits tilework, avoidfiguralsubjects. However, in the Chihil Sutun and 'All Qapu palaces recent cleaning and conservation by Italian teams has revealed ambitious figural schemes in as much of their original splendour as their only partial preservation permits. They show analmost total dependence onthe repertoire of contemporary book painting, with its emphasis on intimate courtly scenes and its occasional frankly erotic flavour. The artists decline to exploit the varied wall surfaces available tothem and prefer to reproduce on alarger scale the rectangular and oblong frames of book illustration. In consequence the palace becomes in effect a picture gallery, an impression strengthened by the eye-level height of these artificial panels and by the deliberately muted floral or other nonfigural motifs which fill the intervening spaces. This interstitial decoration operates as a kind of wallpaper. The tendency to reduce a

dauntingly large wall space to a series of manageable units isfound in Safavid tilework too, but there it cannot be regarded asthe standard solution to the problem of dovetailing decoration with architecture. Three major themes can beisolated in these figural schemes. The first category comprises one or more persons reclining alfresco, drinking or picnicking. The second group consists of single standing figures of courtiers or foreigners, the latter sufficiently identified by costume or attribute (thus an Englishman holds aturnip, presumably an exotic vegetable at theSafavid court). In these panels, which areusually vertical and over life-size, anattempt atrealistic rather than idealised representation is made. Finally, a third group depicts busy crowded scenes of court receptions orbattles. Here again an attempt atportraiture — Shah 'Abbas isinstantly recognisable — and perhaps even satire (as in the cameo of a drunken youth, turban awry, reeling away from a feast supported by pages) breaks through the hackneyed conventions which govern these themes. Influences from European painting, which are themselves apparently filtered through Mughal traditions, have been detected in these large-scale paintings. Sofar it has notbeen possible to assign adate to these various figural wall-paintings, but the evidence suggests that they were produced in the reign of 'Abbas II
(1052/1642-1077/1666).
It remains to consider one typically Safavid genre ofbuilding: the caravansarai (pi. 46;fig.1 )a,b). The dearth of datable examples makes it desirable to treat these structures as agroup rather than singly. Discussion of their variety, their utilitarian quality, the patrons who financed them, the planning devices and ideals used intheir construction, and the dating problems which they present should place in better perspective the Safavid contribution to this field. By creating the abstraction of a "typical" Safavid caravansarai and describing its features, useful conclusions may be drawn from the scores ofSafavid caravansaraisto
survive.1 The typical caravansarai, then, is set inopen countryside and has a rectangular exterior marked by rounded towers at the corners and sometimes atintervals along the perimeter walls. The three side walls bear no decoration. At the centre ofthe main facade opens the single portal, sometimes flush but more often projecting boldly with its wings sometimes bevelled at the inner corners. When deep niches

articulate this facade, booths or shops may occupy them. Rings may be let into this wall for tethering animals. The provision of only one entrance has obvious advantages: traffic can be the more easily controlled and the security of the building is improved. A broad vaulted vestibule, sometimes of two storeys, mediates between the portal and the inner courtyard. If provision is made for an upper storey here, the space is often occupied by a balakhana, a well-ventilated private chamber which in some caravansarais is reserved for important guests. The inner courtyard, aspacious rectangle, is articulated by four aivans in a cruciform disposition. Individual chambers, consisting of a broad public porch leading into a narrow private cell for sleeping, and arranged in rows at right angles to the courtyard, link these aivans. These rooms facing the court rest on a raised platform so that the animals in the courtyard cannot intrude on the quarters reserved for travellers. Sometimes tethering rings are attached to this platform. Between the chambers for travellers and the perimeter wall run long uninterrupted galleries used for stabling. Access to these is by passages in the diagonals of the courtyard. Staircases in the thickness of the walls lead to the roof, which is also used for sleeping. Ample storage space is provided, often in the diagonals of the plan. Many caravansarais had a resident custodian, who had his private quarters adjoining or above the portal. Certain deficiencies are apparent in this imagined blueprint. Privacy, for example, was a privilege enjoyed by the few. Generally, no facilities for cooking were available, though the individual chambers had fireplaces. Ventilation was poor. Apparently there were sometimes no latrines. Safavid caravansarais, unlike those of earlier periods, generally had no mosque. Water was frequently unavailable within the building, though if there were no cistern inside water could be obtained from a nearby well, stream, cistern orqanat. No special provision was made for female travellers. A few well-appointed caravansarais do, however, show that designers were aware of these imperfections and could overcome themat need. They have such extra features as shops, bakeries, baths, specially segregated quarters for women or for honoured guests, kitchens and even signal towers in which lights burned to guide desert traffic. Some of the larger examples even have two tiers of rooms; their interior
facades approximate to those of mosques and madrasas.1 Frequently

these improvements are grafted on to earlier Safavid or pre-Safavid caravansarais; examples are even known of Safavid caravansarais refurbished in this period. Variety is a major characteristic of this genre of building. No two caravansarais are identical, despite their close family resemblance. A host of small, significant refinements from one caravansarai to the next can be detected even in groups of such buildings which were clearly

commissioned and built together, and were usually, one presumes, the work ofa single architect. This variety is particularly striking if it is recalled that these buildings, especially when they line the long, monotonous, semi-desert routes skirting the Dasht-i Kavlr, cater for a given size ofcaravan and so are identical in function tothe othersin the chain. Thus little purpose would beserved bymajor changes in layout. Cultic structures, by contrast, were inherently open toa much wider range of functions which could be served by various elements grafted on to a nuclear plan. In addition, many external reasons account for the variety ofIranian architecture as a whole atany given period. Styles, for example, are often essentially local. Sites maybe

irregular. A patron may lavish interest and money on asingle building. Functions ina given genre of building vary from one structure tothe next. Fashions inornament change over the generations. Yet Safavid caravansarais achieve variety without such external spurs. With some exceptions, shortly tobe noted, the functional constraints are remarkably constant. If, then, the buildings maintain their variety, the reason must be sought less in external factors than in the mind of the architect. Seen as awhole, Safavid caravansarais offer silent testimony to the way that their architects grappled with the perennial problem ofmatching form with function. They allow us to admire the intellectual rigour and inventiveness of these masters who so often drew unexpected felicities from the deployment of a fewstandard elements, andwho were capable, as some octagonal and circular caravansarais show, ofbreak
ing the set conventions of the genre with dramatic effect.1 Produced as they were in large numbers under official patronage, these caravansarais would bethe obvious place to look forthe use of blueprints in Safavid architecture; but such blueprints, if used, must have been systematically reworked on almost every occasion. Nevertheless there are certain external factors towhich some caravansarais had to adjust. If they were sited in mountainous areas, for example, where the weather was liable to besevere, they were commonly roofed throughout and might even bebuilt into the hillside. Routes which incorporated extremes of climate, or were otherwise uncomfortable to travel, naturally carried less traffic and called for smaller caravansarais than the more popular arterial routes. Some routes were positively dangerous, for they travelled through areas infested by brigands. Hence, probably, the trio ofoctagonal fortified caravansarais on the Shlraz road. Proximity toa village might explain the reduced size of a caravansarai vis-a-vis others in the same chain. Conversely, if it was located close to a major town the caravansarai would probably have to deal with more than mercantile traffic, for it was an ancient custom to accompany adeparting caravan to the end of the first day's stage. In the case of the Madar-i Shah caravansarai, some 45 km. from Isfahan, the needs of ambassadors ontheir way to the court were borne in mind; hence the unusually lavish provision of elaborate guest rooms and a hammam. Yet other caravansarais per

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
formed subsidiary functions as links in the postal service, as refuges for nearby villages in time ofdanger or asmilitary outposts. Exceptions apart, however, the multiple solutions that were devised within the basically simple framework of the celebrated four-aivan plan command admiration. A second hallmark of the genre is its plainness. For elaborate decoration no Safavid caravansarai approaches such medieval examples as Ribat-i Malik, Ziya' Khatun, Ribat-i Sharaf or a whole series of Mongol caravansarais. It seems to have been apolicy decision to stress the utilitarian function of these buildings. Timurid examples had probably initiated this trend, ifthe extensive but plain Qush Ribat, a foundation of Amir Shuja' al-DIn in north-western Afghanistan dated 912/1506—7, is any guide. Internal and external facades in most Safavid caravansarais are plain, and the same austerity governs the vaulting in the covered areas. Only inthe portal and inthe vestibule behind it is this rule frequently broken, and then somewhat grudgingly. Portals, whether flush or salient, are decked out in ornamental brickwork or glazed tiles andoften bore inscriptions, while thevestibule often boasts a stellar vault. These exceptions serve only to highlight the dominant severity of the building. So alien isthis characteristic tothe great public buildings of Iran that it demands an explanation. Perhaps the setting of the typical caravansarai inremote countryside, never to be seen by a large admiring public, is partly responsible, though itmust be conceded that earlier patrons were not inhibited by this factor. Cultic buildings could be decorated tothe greater glory ofGod, and palace decoration naturally reflected the luxurious life-style of the court; but the caravansarai called for display neither on cultic nor on secular grounds. Yet these reasons are insufficient to explain the plainness of these buildings. A comparison with earlier caravansarais is instructive, for the richness of many of the surviving examples and the fact that evidence for a chain of such buildings is mostly lacking suggest that they were the product of ad hoc patronage: hence, no doubt, thevery marked differences between them. Moreover, they enabled awealthy patron to advertise this munificence without incurring the much greater cost involved in a chain of caravansarais. The Safavid period, if not already late Timurid times, saw atotal reversal of this practice. Chains of caravansarais were now built, often as part of a single building campaign. Thus the buildings were numerous and time was short. Moreover, the extensive scale ofmany ofthese structures

would have made their decoration too costly. Limited funds would also have discouraged innovation. A complex of factors therefore determined themarked lack of applied ornament in this genre and its rather conservative bias. At the same time these very factors helped to perfect the "house style" marked by economy, a sense of proportion and aninfallibly good taste, and founded onwide experience. In much the same way even jobbing builders in Georgian Britain achieved consistently pleasing results. In both cases the very limitations of the architectural vocabulary were turned to advantage. It is easy to understand how the caravansarai became suigeneris in this periodand why there was little interaction with contemporary religious and palatial architecture. The Safavid caravansarai also sheds much light on theprinciples of
design employed by architects ofthis period.1 These principles are simple and practical, as befits a building intended for the daily unloading, provisioning, stabling and loading ofhundreds ofbeasts, forthe accommodation oftheir masters and (in the case ofurban caravansarais) forthe sale ofgoods. The building isconceived less as awhole than as a quarter, and the four quarters are planned inidentical fashion. This makes iteasier for the architect to block out his design. Sometimes a smaller unit is employed: thus the size ofan individual bay inthe stabling area, orofan individual chamber in theaccommodation for travellers, is repeated in modular form for all similar elements throughout thebuilding. In this way caravansarais of very large surface area could be laid out with rigorous exactitude. Regular subdivisions are built into the plan to keep men and animals apart, and to separate adjoining stables; this is a prime function ofthe aivans. The variety ofsolutions devised forthe treatment of the diagonal areas in the courtyards highlights the comparative sameness of the rest of the courtyard facades and suggests that architects devoted special attention to these intersections. Perhaps, indeed, the solution adopted for these passageways dictated the rest of the plan. The construction of scores of such large and expensive buildings along the arterial roads ofIran clearly implies royal patronage. Tothis day most caravansarais throughout the country are confidently attri
buted bythe local people to Shah 'Abbas I.2While these identifications

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
are individually open to doubt, in toto they do deserve acertain measure of credence, the more so as no other type ofbuilding is sounhesitatingly identified. In some cases, even though no inscriptions survive, the existence ofseveral very similar caravansarais at intervals along a given route is ample testimony - on the ground of expense alone - of exalted patronage, while the provision of caravansarais along comparatively unfrequented routes only makes sense as part of an overall policy of encouraging trade, communications and pilgrimage. Shah 'Abbas I is known tohave pursued such a policy with vigour. Some groups of caravansarais are associated with particular officials, such as those on the Isfahan — Kashan road built by the Grand Eunuch Agha Karmal. Other single caravansarais were also built by courtiers, such as that of Gabrabad, which is associated with the royal general Mir Sablr. It seems likely that wealthy merchants too might have been active in this field, though there is apparently no epigraphical evidence for this. The dating of these buildings is problematic. Until this century ample evidence was available in the form of dating inscriptions, usually in glazed tilework, set in the entrance portals of many caravansarais. Subsequently, these panels, the only decorative element of obvious value, have all too frequently been removed. Most Iranian caravansarais that bear a date are of the Safavid period, and most of those were built in the 17th century. In a chain of similar caravansarais, one dated building may allow the others to be dated by association. But these dated points of reference are rare. In a building genre where the functional element isuppermost, the detailed decoration and elaborate vaulting which serve to date anepigraphic cultic buildings are absent. Yet the presence of certain types of vault (e.g. the kite or the sunburst variety, and muqarnas semi-domes with two or three broad tiers of cells), of geometric glazed tilework in colour schemes known from other Safavid buildings, and of flush patterned monochrome brickwork, all point to a Safavid date for anepigraphic caravansarais with these features. The absence of the distinctive arch profiles of earlier centuries offers further corroborative evidence. Above all, however, the huge quantity of caravansarais forwhich nopre-Safavid date can be canvassed must be the crucial factor in any dating controversy. For it is plain that between 15 00 and 1900 the wealth, the organisation, the internal security and the expansion of trade which this mass of buildings implies only characterised Iranian society in the Safavid centuries. The detailed analysis ofindividual buildings in the previous pages must now be supplemented by a more general discussion of the wider

themes expressed bythis architecture. Three broad headings suggest themselves: the political context ofSafavid architecture, including questions ofpatronage; itsquantity, distribution, type and time-scale; andits characteristic styles. Adiscussion ofthe role ofthe craftsman and of foreign influence on Safavid architecture will round off this section.
THE POLITICAL CONTEXT OF SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
At first sight the political context of these times could beregarded as well suited for great architectural projects. A good many shahs reigned for aquarter ofa century ormore — Isma'Il I, 'Abbas II, Sulaiman, Sultan Husain - while 'Abbas I and Tahmasp I reigned for 41 and 52 years respectively. These long reigns provided the continuity necessary for sustained architectural campaigns. But such campaigns in fact occurred only sporadically, forseveral of these monarchs — e.g.,Isma'Il I and Tahmasp I — failed to provide the necessary impetus from the top. As a result theperiod of 15 00—90 is remarkably void of great architecture more so than any century inIran since the arrival ofthe Buyids. With the accession of Shah 'Abbas this situation changed dramatically; and the reason wasprecisely that not only the monarch but his courtiers too began to build. Apparently the menaces of the shah encouraged the laggards among them, andindeed thearray of functionaries is suspiciously representative: physicians, generals, amirs, chamberlains, majordomos and governors were allinvolved. But their joint activity sufficed to transform Isfahan beyond recognition. The European travellers comment on how these courtiers vied with each other in lavish building projects, but there isno proof that this emulation had any political edge. Thus it seems unlikely that thetribal and factional rivalries which simmered in theSafavid court found expression in competing architectural programmes. The women ofthe court seem tohave had little hand in building, and such architectural patronage as was exercised by women in this period seems to have been directed particularly towards madrasas: there was no Safavid successor to Gauhar Shad. Beyond the orbit ofthe court there probably existed a class ofmerchant patrons whose financial support may help to explain the quantity of lavish bazaars (in Qazvin, Kirman, Kashan and Qum apart from Isfahan itself)
which were erected inthis period.1
1 Stevens, pp. 430—40.
820



POLITICAL CONTEXT
In the later Safavid period, therefore, patronage was exercised on a broader basis than hitherto. But the shah himself still played the preeminent role, and his foundations often had a political motive. The establishment of Shi'ism asthe national creed goes fartoexplain the emphasis on shrines. Ardabll enjoyed particular prominence because of its unique status as adynastic shrine (fig. 2), while the Mashhad shrine was lavishly embellished, evidently as part of an attempt to encourage pilgrimages there rather than to Mecca (fig. 8). Both politicaland economic considerations seem to underlie this scheme: Mecca was after all in Ottoman hands at this time. More surprising, perhaps, is the same shah's patronage of work on Sunni monuments, such as Bistam, Turbat-i Jam and Turbat-i Haidariyya. Given the solidly Sunni population of much of Khurasan, this support might be seen as an attempt by Shah 'Abbas towin over these potential opponents. Economic rather than political or sectarian motives account for the extensive network of trade communications which he built up throughout Iran. In providing major roads criss-crossing the country and serviced by regularly spaced caravansarais he was realising the dream of many of his predecessors. Urban caravansarais provided a support system for the rural ones and a major port was developed atBandar 'Abbas. This scale of investment in trading facilities is an expression of that same capacityto think big, that same awareness ofa wider world, which produced the Maidan-i Shah. Indeed, the imperial aspirations of 'Abbas and his eagerness to establish contacts with Europe are the key to his architecture. He sought to make Isfahan rival Istanbul and Delhi, which at that very time were undergoing what might be termed an ostentatious face-lift that clearly proclaimed imperial aspirations. For once in Iranian history the greatest buildings which survive of a dynasty are those erected by its greatest ruler atthe height ofhis power. It isof a piece with the grandiose vision of Shah 'Abbas that the new Isfahan, essentially his personal creation, should attract the lion's share of resources. By the later Safavid period the capital was becoming a central feature of government and society. The ruler was apt to spend most ofhis time there instead ofon campaign, and it was natural that the capital should be increasingly embellished. Even under Isma'Il I and Tahmasp I most important new buildings were concentrated in Tabriz andQazvln respectively. In earlier periods, distinctions between metropolitan and provincial styles inarchitecture may be somewhat unreal, with monu

ments ofthe first quality being built outside theorbit ofthe court in villages and towns all over the country. In Safavid times, however, these distinctions do begin to apply, for little fine architecture was produced inthe provinces unless the monarch himself or the court was responsible for it; a similar process may be traced in book painting. Only secular architecture may provide substantial exceptions to this rule.
QUANTITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF SAFAVID BUILDINGS
So much, then, for thepolitical context of Safavid architecture. One may now attempt to formulate generalisations about its quantity, distribution, type and time-scale. The quantity of buildings is perhaps the crucial factor, for all theother generalisations depend on it. The nearest approach to achecklist ofIranian architecture, the very incomplete gazetteer of MishkatI, records many more monuments of the Safavid than ofany other period. Its incompleteness, too, is correspondingly more marked in its coverage ofSafavid buildings, as thepublished accounts of monuments in Isfahan and Yazd show. It seems likely that the 111 Safavid orpartially Safavid buildings herecordsare
less than half of those actually extant.1 This massive production may justify some tentative observations. Quantity alone, forexample, may be deceptive. Many entries inalist of Safavid "monuments" turn out to refer to sarcophagi, tombstones, woodwork oreven graffiti inbuildings ofuncertain date and indifferent aesthetic value. Orthey may benothing more than minor repairs. Even so, it is clear that for this - as for no other - period inIslamic Iran there exists atruly representative selection ofbuildings, warts and all. The contrast with earlier architecture is instructive. Almost by definition, buildings which have survived from medieval times inIran have been ofhigh quality. Indifferent work hasgone. Butin Safavid architecture a good deal of it still remains. Generalisations can thus be tested against a wide range of buildings, and panegyrics of Safavid architecture must be specifically tied tothebuildings produced under royal or court patronage. Stylistic developments can be pinpointed, and it is even possible to assemble a respectable oeuvre forindividual artists, notably calligraphers. Where major blanks in the chronology

QUANTITY AND DISTRIBUTION
occur (e.g. between 1520 and 1590) they can beidentified asgaps in production and not confused with the vagaries of survival. Areasof active and ofsluggish production emerge, as does the order ofpopularity ofthe various building types. Sufficient material isavailable for the large-scale collation ofdocumentary records with the evidenceof standing structures. This is atask for Iranian scholars par excellence, just as native Turkish scholars have brought to light and interpreted the Ottoman archival material which bears onarchitecture and tilework. The quantity of surviving buildings is also areminder that — no matter what prominence isgiven tothe finest creations ofcourt patronage this architecture has itsroots in everyday life. A great many Safavid buildings are situated unpretentiously invillages or small towns, and even when they are found inthe major cities of the land they are most often located in quarters which are essentially village or small town units transported intheir entirety into an urban setting. One conclusion, however, that cannot lightly be drawn from the large quantity of surviving Safavid buildings is that the output of this period was substantially greater than that of the preceding centuries in Islamic Iran. Contemporary records are unreliable yardsticks of building activity, but the fact that the city chronicles ofYazd and Shiraz alone list scores ofmedieval monuments which have now disappeared without trace should sound awarning note. Moreover, among the great epochs of Iranian architecture the Safavid period is the most recent and one would therefore expect more to have survived than from earlier periods. Finally, the stability which Shah 'Abbas brought to Iran may well have released into building activities — among other areas of the economy and national life — energies previously wasted in war. In such an interpretation, these hundreds of buildings spread throughout the country would reflect a land at peace. But the argument cannot be pushed very far, since the examples of Yazd and Shiraz cited above suggest that the spate of new buildings could continue in politically self-contained towns despite political instability in the country atlarge. The areas where Safavid buildings cluster most densely differ significantly from the centres favoured earlier. Azarbaljan, socrucial for an understanding of Il-Khanid architecture, is neglected, and so too is Khurasan, the region which produced so many fine Saljuq structures. Herat has little to show fornearly two centuries of Safavid rule. As noted above, the earlier Safavid capitals of Tabriz and Qazvln saw little major construction. Amidst the sea of frankly provincial work

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
which floods the country there rise islands of more ambitious architecture, such as the great religious shrines, the buildings ofKirman, and of course Isfahan itself, which offer the chance to study fine Safavid work in depth. For the rest ofthe country "Safavid" is more a convenient dynastic label than a precise descriptive term connoting adistinctive style. In this chapter the role of the areas bordering modern Iran has deliberately been minimised because of the wealth of monuments in Iran itself. Noserious distortion of emphasis seems likely to result from this neglect. But these outlying areas do show that Safavid architecture had acertain cachet and that itimposed itself even in lands with a rather different building tradition. While theSafavids held Iraq, much work was done on the four great Shl'l shrines there (Baghdad, Samarra, Karbala and Najaf), and indeed Iraqi architecture after c. 1500 isinthe shadow of Persian modes. This isespecially clear inthe minarets ofthe country, with their tiled geometrical and epigraphical
ornament.1 In the Caucasian provinces the Safavid style using brick and tilework and Persian forms (e.g. at Erivan) existed side byside with a local Caucasian tradition which had done much toinspire the stone architecture of medieval Anatolia. The Safavids sporadically held substantial sections of eastern Anatolia, but the architectural style there remained obstinately Ottoman. To the east Safavid influence penetrated at least to Qandahar, though it seems likely that the tiled buildings ofLahore and Multan reflect contemporary Iranian inspiration indirectly. But the major school of architecture in the Safavid style outside Iran is undoubtedly that of Shaibanid Bukhara. It may seem ironic that the capital of the Uzbeks, the inveterate enemies of the Safavids, should be a treasury ofapparently Safavid architecture. On reflection, however, it is clear that this Uzbek style was a natural outgrowth from Timurid architecture, which of course also generated — orrather, imperceptibly became — Safavid work. The Uzbek buildings conveniently fill the years 15 00— 15 90 which are so barren in Iran, and share with their Safavid counterparts, through their joint ancestry in the Timurid style, a common vocabulary ofform and decoration, though they place more emphasis ondecorative brick vaulting, with
flush painted joints, than was fashionable in Iran.2

TYPES
TYPES
Although the Safavid period did not generate brand new types of building, its priorities did not coincide with those of previous centuries. New emphases of architectural patronage may be detected as much in what is not found in Safavid architecture as in the great achievements of the period. Perhaps the most striking feature is the virtual absence of large new mosques. A functional explanation for this - that there was by now little need for such structures - is inadequate, for the later Timurids erected numerous large and bare mosques throughout Khurasan, many of them simply too big for the communities they were apparently intended to serve. The Timurid princes who built these mosques understood, as did Shah 'Abbas at Isfahan, the psychological dimension of lavish public architecture. It is only in the last century and a half, when old buildings have suffered destruction at an accelerating pace, that the need for new and large mosques has made itself felt once more. The characteristic Safavid activity in mosque architecture, as will be shown in detail below, is repair work: even in the erstwhile capital cities of Tabriz and Qazvin it was apparently considered sufficient to refurbish the existing jami', and this was at first done in Isfahan too. While Safavid architects did not especially avoid the challenge of sheer size, in religious architecture they were not often given the chance to meet that challenge. Large mosques were simply not fashionable. The great exception is of course Isfahan; once again it is clear that for all its importance that city is no satisfactory gauge for Safavid architecture as a whole. The choice of a new site on the outskirts of the city made large new mosques a necessity. In the contemporary Ottoman and Mughal empires such large mosques were, by contrast, frequently built. If such large mosques were the exception in Safavid architecture small mosques at least were a standard feature, and in Isfahan, where the majority of them are to be found, were built mostly at the behest of courtiers. No particular type of mosque was preferred above others; hypostyle, domed square and aivan mosques are all common. Although madrasas were an established genre of buildings from the n t h century onwards in Iran, remarkably few medieval examples survive there, and of these few the majority are Timurid. It seems likely that purpose-built madrasas — as distinct from composite foundations, now not always recognisable as such, or mosques which served at least in part as madrasas - achieved a new popularity in the 15 th century which continued throughout the Safavid period. These

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
Timurid madrasas are conceived on a large scale, and Uzbek madrasas perpetuated this tradition. Safavid architects, however, supplemented this type of madrasa (which remained popular) with asmaller and more intimate type of building, something perhaps more akin to the original concept ofthe madrasa. The courtyard remained, but was so reduced
in size that the building reverted to an essentially domestic scale.1 But it isthe shrine above all that dominates Safavid religious architecture. This is true of large, complexes and even more of isolated imamzadas; both types of building were frequently centres of pilgrimage. Many ofthe most celebrated shrines of Iran (such as Ardabll and Mashhad, figs 2, 8) and of Iraq acquired their present aspect during this period. Secular mausolea gave way almost entirely to those of saints,a process traceable atleast as early as the Mongol period but one which had been gathering momentum ever since then. The tomb tower form which had been such alandmark inmedieval architecture had by now been decisively rejected in favour of buildings which emphasised breadth as much as height and had domes rather than conical roofs. In harmony with this revised emphasis, the square or octagonal plan had become general, replacing the variety of earlier plans. The interiors of these mausolea were comparatively spacious rather than cramped. They usually had mihrabs and sometimes even adjoining courtyards and a garden setting. This radical change oflayout was a response to the growing habit of conducting devotions in shrines and this practice helps toexplain why shrines rather than mosques were the characteristic expressions ofSafavid patronage in cultic architecture. The adoption of Shi'ism, with its ancient tradition of the veneration of saints, as the national creed could only accentuate this change of emphasis. Side by side with this accent on shrines isthe unexpected burst of activity in secular architecture in the 17th century. It is this which singles out the Safavid period from the rest ofIslamic architecturein Iran. Bridges which have wider functions than carrying traffic are built, reviving Sasanian custom. Caravansarais in both town and country proliferate, and there are large urban bazaars. Pigeon towers were built in their thousands, mainly in theIsfahan oasis butalso around Gulpaigan and Kirman. Town planning develops ona scale hitherto unequalled inIran. Earlier, when new cities were built (like Sultaniyya) or old ones extended (like Tabriz), it seems that no overall

plan was imposed and thus these foundations expanded in a somewhat random way. Lastly, several princely residences have fortunately survived and make it possible, for the first time in Iranian Islamic architecture, to weigh the hyperbolic literary accounts against actual palaces. In sum, then, it seems generally true that in Safavid times secular and shrine architecture absorbed the energies of architects to a degree not found in earlier periods, and that this was to the detriment of other religious architecture which hitherto had attracted most patronage.
CHRONOLOGY
It will be seen that neither the major building types nor the areas of architectural activity were evenly spread in Safavid times, and the same patchiness marks the chronology of production under this dynasty. Periods of intense activity alternate with protracted lulls. Indeed, although Safavid rule lasted for two and a quarter centuries very few decades in this period were truly productive so far as architecture was concerned. The lack of vigorous local schools has already been noted, and it means that the Safavid, unlike the Saljuq, Il-Khanid, and Timurid periods, lacks the continuous rhythm of local traditions on which imperial foundations are occasionally superimposed. In the 14th and 15 th centuries especially, the enthusiastic patronage of the later Tl-Khans and of the Timurid princes was supplemented by that of the numerous smaller dynasties of the period: Chobanids, Muzaffarids, Aq Quyunlii, and so on. Continuity was assured. Safavid rule brought increasing centralisation and tended to confine architecture within the orbit of the court. Such architecture thus came to depend to a dangerous degree on royal patronage. When that failed, architecture itself languished, for the continuity of provincial architecture had already been broken. This lack of continuity may help to explain why for most of the Safavid period Iran, though so rich in ordinary buildings, is comparatively barren of great ones. Interestingly enough, the obvious exception — the years from 1590 to 1630 — is also the period when there was a permanent concentration - indeed, a constellation - of talent in one place. It could very well be argued that for the rest of the century Isfahan lived off the resources accumulated in that creative period. Earlier, the architecture of Shah Isma'Il could be seen as a hangover from the Aq Quyunlu period; but in eastern Iran the Timurid style died of inanition. In view of the doldrums of the 16th century any discussion of a developing style in this period is misplaced.
827



SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
The lesson ofmost medieval Iranian architecture isthat the necessary craftsmanship and expertise were latent and needed only the right stimulus inorder tobe exploited. In Safavid times it was only in the reign of Shah 'Abbas that this stimulus was forthcoming ona requisitely lavish scale. Ambitious patronage generated ambitious architecture. The grand style was lost insubsequent reigns, and while the reasons for this leave room fordiscussion, it seems preferable to attribute the apparent failure of nerve tothe patron rather than tothe architect. No matter how blame is apportioned, however, the consequences are self-evident: despite the fact that the Safavids ruled for well over two centuries, they achieved qualitatively less in that period — so far asarchitecture is concerned — than did the Saljuqs between 1080 and 1160 or thell-Khans between 1300 and 1350. It may be, ofcourse, that the very scale ofthe larger Safavid building projects caused later architects a certain disquiet and made them chary offraming similar plans. Projects like the Ganj 'All Khan complex at Kirman (fig. 9) and the redevelopment of the shrines at Ardabil, Mahan and Mashhad — to say nothing of the great ensembles at Isfahan — must have brought in their train multiple problems oflogistics and administration, many of them unfamiliar. Buildings on this scale were a serious drain onresources and could not lightly be undertaken. Nor was money the only problem. The time-scale adopted for some of these buildings was probably inadequate for them tobe completed successfully; hence thepossibly apocryphal tale about the architect of the
Masjid-i Shah noted above.1 The change from tile mosaic to haft-rangl tilework in the same building offers independent corroboration of this story. Things were very different inthe more highly organised building industry ofthe Ottoman empire. But Safavid architecture hadno one with thegenius, status or staying power of Sinan. The great achievements of Ottoman and Mughal architecture were made possible as much by efficient organisation as by great architects. In Safavid Iran, which attained imperial status appreciably later than its rivals, this fortunate conjunction was regrettably intermittent. Clearly, therefore, the sheer size ofthe Safavid auvrecan be deceptive; and not only for the reasons just cited. An unprecedentedly high proportion of Safavid architecture all over Iran comprises repair work, not new foundations. The buildings chosen for repair and extra embel

lishment were, following traditional practice, almost exclusively religious, and the great shrines especially benefited from such work. Not so secular buildings: rather than repair old caravansarais, architects preferred to build new caravansarais beside them. Various explanations could be adduced for this emphasis on repair work. Rather than build yet more mosques and shrines Safavid patrons may have preferred the compromise solution of repairing existing structures. For a small outlay — for example, on a new portal, a fagade screening earlier work, or just new decoration - they would receive disproportionate credit, especially if, as often happened, the repair was not acknowledged as such and the patron greedily claimed, implicitly or explicitly, to have erected the entire building. This seems a more likely motive than does exceptional religious piety. Alternatively, these repairs could be seen as the result of purely local initiatives prompted by the decay of some valued local building. It is of course precisely at the level of restoration and embellishment that local patronage can
most fruitfully be exercised.1 In such repair work Safavid craftsmen acquired a close familiarity with earlier styles and this in turn may have affected their response to the task in hand. Thus at Mahan, for example, the galleries added by Shah 'Abbas to the Timurid nucleus of the shrine ape the Timurid device of a single-colour tiled dado with plain white vaulting above (pi. 42). This could be either extreme conservatism or conscious antiquarianism, as pastiches of earlier Islamic styles can be found in Safavid lustre tilework, in the Safavid inscriptions on pre-Islamic monuments (e.g. Persepolis and Blsitun) which perhaps presage that wholesale adoption of and identification with the Iran of legend that was to characterise the Qajars, or in some of the manuscripts painted for Shah 'Abbas in the early 17th
century.2 Much of this repair work, however, was carried out on earlier Safavid buildings, which says little for their quality. The tomb of Khwaja Rabi', for example, was repaired twice within a century of its original foundation. But whatever the date of the building to be repaired, redecorated, extended or subjected to some change of function, the new work was rarely identified in detail and is thus difficult to date precisely.
1 An unpublished list of Iranian architects and craftsmen in the field of architectural decoration, drawn up by Dr G.D. Pickett and kindly made available to me, shows that most craftsmen operated in the immediate orbit of their native village or city.

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
The lack ofa comprehensive checklist ofSafavid buildings makes it hard to pinpoint thetrends underlying these repairs. It does seem, however, that repairs were proportionately more frequent in the reigns of certain rulers than of others. The evidence suggests that itwas precisely the shahs who avoided large building projects — Isma'Il I, Tahmasp I and Saf11 — whose reigns also witnessed a disproportionate amount of repair work. It seems, too, that the proportion of repairs vis-a-vis new foundations rose steeply in the reigns of Shah Sulaiman and Shah Sultan Husain, thus suggesting that the gradual enfeeblement of the dynasty increasingly forced architectural patronage to confine itself to relatively trivial projects. But these generalisations doubtless require further refinement in the light of more evidence. Similarly, itis too early to say whether (with the obvious exception ofIsfahan) the ratio between repair work and new foundations was constant throughout Iran, or whether some areas benefited more than others from new building within given periods.
STYLE
The foregoing remarks must suffice to establish the wider context of this architecture. Given the quantity and variety ofSafavid buildings, it has seemed best to examine their style by focussing on three main areas: the buildings of 17th-century Isfahan; the great shrines; and secular architecture of the 17th century. The generalisations which follow have been formulated with all three groups in mind, though of course they do not apply equally to each group. A sure sense of spatial values informs the best architecture of the period. This sense is seen at its most spectacular in the great ensembles where each building is enhanced by its neighbours. It expresses itself on the grand scale of landscape architecture in the Chahar Bagh, where nature - even if it is nature methodised - envelopes the buildings, which function as beauty spots only and are deliberately subordinated to the landscaping of the avenue (fig. 4). The various royal gardensin Isfahan and elsewhere - especially the great gardens atFarahabad and Ashraf in Mazandaran - are also laid out with an eye for scale and for the interaction of the constituent parts. Massed plots offlowersand shrubs combine with pools, fountains and canals; trees demarcate the major divisions; uncluttered expanses rest the eye (fig. \ia). A ground plan tends to overemphasise the regularity of the overall design of such gardens. Within the geometrical layout so reminiscent ofgarden car

pets there is room for surprises. Suddenly a wide prospect opens, or conversely the scale shrinks to an enclosed arbour with a central pool. Sometimes terraces bring an abrupt change of plane. A secluded pavilion, subtly at one with its surroundings, readily evokes an atmosphere of intimacy, but its plan may be open and airy with windows giving on to a series of different views, some circumscribed, others distant. Such a garden employs concepts of open and closed space, and of their interaction, which are essentially architectural; the same is true of the emphasis on vistas, directed viewpoints, and changes of plane as well
as devices of anticipation and surprise.1 Even when the architects did not have a free hand, notably in the case of additions to extant structures, the same spatial awareness makes itself felt. Work on the great shrines illustrates this. At Mashhad the great esplanade of Shah 'Abbas imposed ideals of order and scale on the heterogeneous jumble of earlier buildings (fig. 8). The same ruler provided airy galleries to flank the domed square mausoleum of Shah Ni'mat-Allah at Mahan, and thus to open up the whole shrine. A huge courtyard and perimeter walls were added at Ardabll (fig. 2). The dominant impulse in such work seems to have been to introduce a new and grander sense of scale into these foundations. This trend is of course most obvious when the architect disposed of a virgin site (Isfahan maidan; Masjid-i Nau, Shlraz). Wherever possible, the essentially additive nature of the extant buildings was masked by large elements (avenues, galleries, courtyards, perimeter walls) whose scale was sufficiently bold to absorb the earlier piecemeal work. Thus an overall plan is created which takes account of standing structures but by suitable additions gives the entire shrine a more coherent and organised appearance. Individual buildings illustrate much the same concerns. The typical free-standing mausoleum of Safavid times has a new complexity of plan and elevation. The factor of increased size alone allows far more scope to an architect interested in spatial problems. Large octagonal mausolea are in fact the ideal genre of buildings to study some typical Safavid approaches to these problems (fig. 1). A standard feature is the drastic reduction of wall surfaces, both internally and externally; deep niches are scooped out of the wall and indeed arches sometimes break through the wall altogether. Frequently the mausoleum comprises two storeys; the common arrangement in such cases is to have the ring of

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
niches or arches on the ground floor repeated at first floor level, rather than toextend their height. Inner and outer galleries add depth tothe elevation, while netor stalactite vaults and blind arches or panels articulate the individual bays. The plethora of windows ensures that the architect can exploit many contrasts of light and shade. In all these various features different levels — of light, surface, texture — are juxtaposed and the same motif is repeated along the horizontal orvertical axis. A delight in spatial diversity underlies the whole approach. A comparison with earlier mausolea reveals that the third dimension was never before sosystematically exploited inthis type ofIranian build
ing. The emphasis isin some respects sculptural.1 Yet while Safavid architects well understood the spatial grouping of entire units and of elements within a single unit, their buildings could not fairly be described as complex. Safavid architecture is safe. Itdeals in large masses and prefers smooth surfaces to intricately articulated ones. With afew honourable exceptions like Mahan (pi. 42), vaulting the essence ofany curvilinear architecture — is dull and repetitive,in contrast to the pyrotechnic display of the previous period. When in doubt, the Safavid architect manufactures another few tiers of "stalactite" cells. Domes follow models known from Timurid and Il-Khanid times, if not earlier, buthave a more restricted range: the melon dome, forexample, disappears. Structure is reliable but not original. Estimable though this competence may be for public secular buildings such as caravansarais, especially when they are built in large quantities, it is not enough in the case of the major religious structures. Structural complexities in particular are toned down. This simplifying trend is most apparent when one compares Safavid with earlier Islamic architecture in Iran. Gone is the massive strength and vigorous ornament of Saljuq brick buildings, or the nervous tension ofIl-Khanid architecture, often so close to overreaching itself. Arch forms lose the fantasy and playfulness of those produced in the previous two centuries - even Saljuq arches were much more varied. Surprises are too few in matters of structure. The vocabulary is limited; it is as ifthe architect voluntarily restricted himself to afew standard shapes which could be reproduced on various scales and reshuffled as required. It is not entirely unfair, then, todescribe Safavid architecture as modular. The various factors which produced this situation will be analysed in more detail below.

STYLE
Neither the spatial organisation nor the simplifying trend in Safavid architecture is, however, its most striking feature. Any casual visitor to Isfahan will confirm that the glory of this style is its decoration. No doubt this was the deliberate intention of those responsible for the buildings. This splendour aims to disarm criticism by its very profusion. But it will not bear minute examination. The common and just complaint against much Safavid tilework is that its quality is poor. In place of the many-faceted reflections of tile mosaic is the virtually unbroken sheen of large overglaze painted tiles. The deep, vibrant tones achieved in tile mosaic give way to paler, even muddy, colours. The reason for this is technical; whereas in tile mosaic each element is cut from a tile fired at the optimum temperature for that colour, overglaze painted tiles bear many colours (hence the term haft-rangl —"seven colours" applied to these tiles, though the colours may number more or less than seven) all fired together at a "compromise" temperature. Inevitably, therefore, the quality of such a tile cannot approach that of tile mosaic. Nevertheless it is not simply because of its technical quality that Safavid tilework is open to criticism. It is habitually used on a larger scale than ever before, several times completely enveloping an interior (Lutf-Allah mosque, pi. 43^; dome chamber of AllahvardI Khan in the Mashhad shrine). Entire facades, too, were sheathed in tilework. Many Il-Khanid and Timurid buildings use lavish tilework, but the total exclusion of brickwork, the actual material of construction, from such large areas of the elevation is virtually without precedent. As late as the reign of Shah Isma'Il, in the Masjid-i 'All, brick still plays a major part in the decorative scheme. Although tile dominates brick in many Timurid facades, brick is allowed to play several important roles in them: it acts as a reminder of the underlying structure, provides a contrasting texture and acts as a chromatic foil to the tilework. Safavid architects surrendered these advantages and frequently relegated brick to the sides of the building. Here tilework is conspicuously absent. This is an obvious slight, and an implicit invitation to look at the building only from those viewpoints where its tilework dominates. As a result the building loses something of its three-dimensional quality and is in danger of becoming facade architecture. Courtyard fagades and other subsidiary areas are either coated with plaster or left as bare
brick; in either case their function is to serve as a foil (pi. 45a).1
1 Hillenbrand, "The Use of Glazed Tilework". The Masjid-i Hakim is an honourable exception to some of these strictures.
833



SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
New figural themes, taken from the repertory of painting, are largely confined to palaces. Nevertheless, living creatures figure with some frequency in the tilework of religious buildings, and include, besides images that are sacred (angels) or ambivalent (peacocks), others that are quite secular (dragons). With this exception the range of tilework designs themselves is nobroader than in the previous period. The themes are simply worked harder. Thulth inscriptions, for example, assume a greater prominence than hitherto. As a whole, architectural decoration is impoverished by the comparative dearth of worked stucco, carved terracotta and ornamental brickwork. All these techniques had an important role in Timurid architecture. Only plain white stucco, used tocover vaults, retained a certain hold. It follows that tilework now had to serve many of the functions formerly discharged by these techniques. New colours and new combinations appear, and there are even attempts to put tilework to new uses (e.g. the tiled floor of the Lutf-Allah mosque). Perhaps the most distinctive new departure is the use of tiled designs, not plain tilework as hitherto, on domes. Floral arabesques were preferred here, though geometrical patterns also occur. In other, less obvious ways, too, tilework came to dominate a building, usurping functions previously reserved for brick or other media. For example, colour was now necessarily the means for distinguishing between different parts of the design or between several superimposed inscriptions. It accentuates structural features, like the turquoise cable mouldings in the Lutf-Allah mosque interior. Sometimes entirely glazed compositions reproduce in many colours the monochrome patterned brickwork of Saljuq times. But forall this readiness to devise different uses for tilework, the plain fact is that the medium was already past its maturity
by the end of the 15 th century.1 In its genesis and formative period glazed tilework coexisted with a booming pottery industry and it reached its zenith when that industry had already begun to decline. Late Saljuq and Il-Khanid wall tiles, especially in lustre andlajvardma, benefited from developments in ceramic but there was to be no further fruitful relationship between the two sister arts. The tilework specialists of pre-Safavid times had in all probability restricted the range and combinations ofglazed toneson

purpose. Certainly the technology for a much wider gamut of colours
than they actually used was available to them.1 Safavid inventions in this field, such as apple green and a hectic custard yellow, were rarely happy ones. Safavid decoration, then, for all its surface splendour, is in some respects the fatal flaw of this architecture. An entirely unprecedented boom in secular buildings marks Safavid architecture in its prime as in its decline, and this fact had a direct impact on Safavid architectural styles. The buildings concerned are broadly speaking of two kinds: utility structures and palaces. The former genre has already been discussed. The palaces, however, illustrate a distinctive style which may conveniently be analysed here. The paucity of earlier examples makes it difficult to assess their originality. They are sufficiently distinct from each other, however, to allow the assumption either that they represent an original style which achieved an early flowering or that - more likely - the tradition from which they sprang was itself varied. Nearly all of them date from the period 1600-70. Numerous typological subdivisions suggest themselves, from the conception of a palace as a full-scale garden garnished with buildings, as at Farahabad, to the transposition of a palace on to a bridge, as in the Khaju bridge at Isfahan (pi. 44a). But in all of them a deliberate insubstantiality is the aim, a lack of emphasis on obviously solid bearing walls, a love for piercing the surface by large windows, niches or loggias and for encrusting interior walls with yet more niches as well as false low-hung ceilings and "stalactite" vaults (fig. 16). In virtually all of them the natural surroundings are brought into play. Royal Safavid miniatures conjure up in exquisite detail the courtly lifestyle to which such palaces ministered, and as a bonus they document numerous lost types of fastidiously elegant pavilions whose rickety structure sufficiently explains their disappearance. Wood here plays an important structural role which it is accorded nowhere else in Iranian Islamic architecture: not only are these buildings frequently of trabeate type, but wooden gratings and balconies figure largely in them. Ground plans and elevations hark back with surprising fidelity to preIslamic models. Seldom has the innate conservatism of Persian builders been so clearly demonstrated.

So much, then, for Safavid architectural style. What of the craftsmen who created it? While public works like caravansarais may imply the existence of teams of craftsmen travelling from one site to the next and in the process developing a "house style" which allowed little scope for individual initiative, the evidence of Safavid religious structures on the contrary suggests the primacy of local initiatives executed by local craftsmen. The evidence also suggests that the individual craftsman improved his status during this period. Two factors especially support this hypothesis. First, far more craftsmen's names survive from this period than from earlier centuries. Of course this is partly due to the large quantity of Safavid buildings extant. But buildings which would earlier have been anonymous or would have borne only a single inscription now have several. This suggests that craftsmen felt a greater self-confidence than hitherto, which itself implies an improved status. Second, the inscriptions bear witness to a new tendency to compartmentalise the labour of erecting a building. One craftsman designs, another builds, a third cuts the tiles (and draws their patterns? - hence the use of the term al-naqqdsh) and a fourth writes the inscriptions. Each signs himself separately and identifies the nature of his work. He may also give his nisba and his father's name, but very rarely anything else. Such multiple signatures appearing on a single building suggest that the master mason has been to some extent demoted and that his fellow craftsmen have benefited correspondingly. Among the specialists whose prestige increased at this time may be noted particularly the tile-cutter (now called increasingly often kdshi-tardsh) and the calligrapher. Many more practitioners of the latter art are recorded than ever before; they apparently specialised in architectural inscriptions. Several of them have left their signatures on a whole series of buildings throughout Iran. Thus a chronology of their work is available and an attempt can be made to define the development of their style. Moreover, these cases provide precious evidence that the best craftsmen were in demand throughout the country. The obvious example is Muhammad Riza ImamI, whose work on key monuments at Isfahan, Qum and Mashhad argues a very
exalted status;1 and, before him, 'All Riza al-'Abbasi was active on royal

foundations atIsfahan, Mashhad and Qazvln aswell asthe madrasaof Ganj 'All Khan at Kirman. Unfortunately, the surviving inscriptions indicate that thecalligraphers were exceptional. Few other craftsmen are attested bymore than one inscription. Even the builders of masterpieces acknowledged as such intheir own time, such as the mosques onthe Isfahan maidan, are known by no other buildings. This suggests that - unlike thecaseof most Iranian book painting —there wasno royal atelier of choice craftsmen incontinuous employment. But when seen in the contextof the large number of names to survive, these single inscriptions bear witness to the great reservoir oftalent onwhich Safavid patrons could draw. The signatures also pose many unresolved problems. Thus detailed study of contemporary sources might reveal whether the craftsmen were subject to any overall organisation. Achecklist of the nisbas of these craftsmen would ofcourse emphasise the unchallenged pre-eminence ofIsfahan; but, much more interestingly, it would also permit aclassification ofthe more important provincial centres during this period. It might even reveal that certain specialities were particularly associated with certain towns. Nisbas areof course notoriously misleading attimes but the sheer quantity ofexamples would offset this disadvantage. Such a checklist would also indicate whether anynew titles or honorifics were applied to craftsmen at this time. Until the proportion ofcraftsmen's names to extant buildings is established, it would behazardous todraw further conclusions about the role of the craftsman atthis time, and similar information is needed for preceding periods and for other contemporary Islamic lands before the full context of the craftsman's activity can be established. But, asshown above, the quantity of names available seems sufficient to isolate certain trends.
RESISTANCE TO EXTERNAL INFLUENCES
It is now time to grapple with anissue often hinted at in the foregoing pages: thereasons forthe lack of development which may bedetected in Safavid architecture. This has other causes than those that have been canvassed above, namely the royal neglect of the 16thcentury,the decay of provincial schools or theemphasis ondecoration at the expense of structure. It results also from an inward-looking quality which prevented Safavid architects from looking to and learning from foreign architectural styles. The foundations of Islamic architecturein
838



RESISTANCE TO EXTERNAL INFLUENCES
Iran seem to have been laid in the Saljuq period atthe latest. Il-Khanid architects refined, rather than expanded, the vocabulary of forms which they inherited, as did Timurid architects intheir turn. Some of the excesses of 15th-century work showed that the process could not be continued indefinitely. Yet this was precisely what Safavid (and Uzbek) architects tried to do, even though their current idiom was bankrupt after centuries ofintensive exploitation. It is not surprising that they were unable to introduce significant innovations and that the structural aspects of architecture stagnated. Builders had to content themselves with allotting a new and dominant role to decoration. A more fruitful approach might have been to look beyond the borders of Iran to some of the other flourishing traditions of the contemporary world. It may be instructive to consider why this was not done. The lack of influences from Western Europe is entirely understandable, despite the fascination with all things Western evinced by Shah 'Abbas. Although embassies trekked back and forth between Europe and Persia, the dominant classical flavour of most contemporary European architecture would have struck no chord in Persian builders. They would not of course have seen such buildings themselves and the reports of ambassadors or the odd engraving would probably not have been a sufficient stimulus. Even in painting, where the exposure to European modes was much more sustained, it is the manner rather than the essence of the European model that is copied, as the auvre of Muhammad Zaman or the Chihil Sutiin panels depicting Europeans indicate. Other factors, however, must explain the reluctance of Safavid architects to learn from their Ottoman and Mughal counterparts. Ithas been a recurrent theme of this chapter that Safavid architecture took a long time to find itself because for many decades the conditions were wrong for an original, fully integrated style to develop. Ottoman Turkey and Mughal India were favoured with one ruler after another who patronised architecture on a grand scale. Both Mughal and Ottoman architecture had a fundamentally different bias from thatof the Safavids, and one that would have made imitation difficult. The use of stone rather than brick demanded different techniques, such as centering, and favoured precise calculation, whereas much of Iranian architecture depended onthe eye. Ottoman architects preferred plain exteriors, which looked impressive in stone, while Iran was traditionally wedded to surface ornament. This latter bias was, however, shared by Mughal architecture, which makes the neglect of that school as a

SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
source of inspiration even harder to explain, especially as Mughal culture owed so much to Persia. Certainly Persian architects and artists went to the Mughal empire. But if they returned they apparently brought little inspiration with them, though conceivably Mughal gardens or the parkland setting of so much Mughal architecture might have exercised some influence onSafavid Persia. Both Mughal India and Ottoman Turkey were, of course, political rivals of the Safavid state, and this must have inhibited the easy dissemination of artistic styles associated with them, inarchitecture as inpainting. Presumably this is why even those influences which would have been easy to absorb, and which had roots orparallels inthe Persian tradition, such as Iznik tilework, Ottoman minarets, Mughal chhatris and onion domes, are absent. Chinese art, on the other hand, carried no such political liability and it is therefore not surprising that in much Safavid art, notably in pottery and in certain types of painting, a pervasive chinoiserie should be evident. TheChinese repertory of dragons, phoenixes, cloud scrolls, peonies andlotuses also makes frequent appearances in Safavid tilework, but these various elements had of course long been domiciled in Iran. It is not necessary, therefore, to postulate a fresh wave of influence from China. The negative complexion ofall this evidence makes it all the more surprising to find a major enclave of alien architecture in Isfahan itself. Nevertheless the Armenian buildings in Julfa document only the impact of Iranian modes on a sturdily independent native tradition; no influence in the reverse direction can bedetected. Architecturally Julfa wasas much aforeign body as itwas from the standpoint of politics, religion, language and society. Armenian forms such as belfries, developed in the context of a stone architecture, look incongruous and even slightly absurd in the alien garb of Safavid brick and tile. But apart from the purely cosmetic change brought about by these local materials, the form of the churches remains entirely Armenian. They represent a curiosity rather than a true merging of the Persian and Armenian traditions.
CONCLUSION
It is now time to draw together the various threads of this chapter. The marked fluctuation in the quantity of surviving buildings from one reign to the next in the Safavid period well illustrates yet again that the finest architecture in Iran is the direct result of royal patronage. When

CONCLUSION
that flagged, so did the production of major buildings. This helps in turn to explain the uneven time-scale of so much Safavid architecture, in which periods of intense activity alternate with long lulls. In fact, most of the Safavid shahs showed little interest in erecting splendid buildings, and even when some of them did engage in serious patronage their increasingly centralised state ensured that most important new construction was in the capital. It is therefore not surprising that central Iran should see the most concentrated spate of building activity, while other provinces which had earlier been of prime importance, such as Azarbaljan, Khurasan and Fars, now became something of a backwater. That the quantity of structures surviving throughout much of Iran during this period is nevertheless so great reflects among other factors the replacement of royal by local patronage. Shrines of various types, rather than mosques, were a particularly popular Safavid form and reflected a widespread veneration of saints, while in secular architecture quantities of palaces and above all of caravansarais survive. In such buildings the manipulation of scale and certain spatial devices brought new emphases to Iranian architecture. In spite of such new constructions, however, repairs and embellishments were a keynote of the period. Foreign influences are of negligible significance, for this is essentially an inward-looking style. It was too firmly rooted in the past to encourage innovation and no clear line of development can be traced throughout the buildings of the period. This conservatism in matters of structure coexisted with, and was probably linked to, a predilection for overall decoration in glazed tilework. This emphasis on applied decoration brought a new status to the craftsman which is reflected in the proliferation of signed work and of named specialists in calligraphy and in the various techniques of tilework. But the primacy accorded to ornament implied a waning interest in architecture per se. It can therefore be argued that, of all the styles of Islamic architecture practised in Iran before the 18th century, the Safavid seems to be the least original, notably lacking in that steady progression which characterised contemporary Ottoman and Mughal architecture. Finally, the fact that this relative decline coexisted with a higher level of material prosperity than Iran had enjoyed for centuries demands some discussion. Perhaps it is an expression of that general artistic and cultural decline, that lack of new inspiration, which was widespread in much of Islamic culture, not least in architecture, by the early 16th century. Ottoman Turkey and Mughal India of course stand out as the exceptions.
841



SAFAVID ARCHITECTURE
Even so, itmust be conceded that in certain areas, such as book painting, textiles and carpet manufacture, the Safavid achievement rivals that of any previous Muslim dynasty in Iran. The argument that architecture expresses a more general decline is therefore of only limited value. Another approach would be to emphasise the destructive impact on architecture of the widespread fashion for tilework. Timurid polychrome ornament had popularised the idea that architecture was a framework, askeleton to be fleshed out with decoration. The accumulated expertise of centuries in seeing a building as a whole was gradually lost and it could not quickly be regained. Buildings were now articulated by colour rather than structural devices. Gradually the focus of attention moved to the facade, and then to the entrance itself, atrend already well developed inTimurid architecture. The side and rear walls became of diminishing consequence and even the interior was apt to be neglected. The building as a whole was thus bound to suffer. But perhaps the crucial factor was the conservatism which afflicted, indeed paralysed, so many Safavid architects. Earlier medieval architecture owed some ofits vitality tothe need todevise new architectural forms for new purposes: khangah, madrasa, tomb shrine and others. No such new functions make their appearance in the Safavid period. Long experience had established the optimum form ofthe basic secular and cultic structures. In matters of structure and decoration a similar fatigue, if not stagnation, had set in. No new structural devices appear and there is no technical breakthrough. The various emphases of earlier styles tilework, brick patterning, stucco carving, transition zones, vaulting, large domes — had all been exhausted. The vigorous local schools of previous centuries had died, so that there was little prospect of fresh ideas from such asource. Much of provincial architecture in this period was produced at artisan level in a style which grew naturally out of provincial Timurid work. Flagging inspiration isparticularly plainin cultic buildings and much of the best Safavid work is secular architecture, ahitherto less intensively exploited field. This may help to explain why inreligious architecture Safavid builders so often relied on sheer scale fortheir most dramatic effects. The lesson was not lost onthe architects of the next two centuries, who also habitually used this dimension of size and thereby partially disguised the humdrum and derivative nature of their buildings. In the context of what was to come it is thus entirely fitting that Safavid architecture should find its epilogue in the gigantic complex of Shah Sultan Husain on the Chahar Bagh.

CHAPTER l6(tf)
THE PICTORIAL ARTS IN THE TIMURID
PERIOD*
In his chapter in volume V of this series, Professor Grabar wrote of the present difficulty of coordinating the monuments of the visual arts with the events of the time. To some extent this is less true ofthe Timurid and Safavid periods, for two reasons; the existence of near contemporary literary sources for the art of the period, especially the arts of the book; and secondly the clearer relation of political events, changes of capital, the patronage of princes, the greater extent of surviving material. Still, even for this period, there arestriking gaps in our knowledge: the small amount of architecture of the 9th/15 th century in western Iran; the complete disappearance of 15 th century carpets; the lack of any wall-paintings or ofportrait drawings which can beattributed with any security to the 15 th century; andof any paintings from Samarqand or Bukhara of the same period. Again, there has been far too little systematic publication, in spite of the marked progress during thepast forty years; we still await definitive publication of the Balsunqur and the Tahmasp Shah-nama manuscripts, for instance; even the work of Bihzad, the most famous painter of Persia, is not yet satisfactorily defined nor his life-history properly established. However, the history of miniature painting is well enough known during these two and a half centuries for an account to be given of the stylistic course and for its assessment in the scale of world art. For,with architecture, this is now the major artistic expression of Iran during this period which witnessed therise anddecline of its classic style. When theperiod opens,1 theleading centre for thearts of the book was in the west, in Tabriz and Baghdad, alternate capitals of the

Jalayirid dynasty; it then shifted briefly to Shiraz for the opening years of the 9th/15 th century, and was then fixed in Herat for the period until 853/1449, and again from about 1480 to912/1506. Inthe interval the capital of the Qara Quyunlii under Jahan Shah and of the Aq Quyunlu under Uzun Hasan and his son Ya'qiib, Tabriz again became a leading centre forthe arts ofthe book and for architecture. With the rise to power ofthe Safavid house, Tabriz became the leading centre for the third time, until the capital was transferred to Qazvln and later to Isfahan, when this city became the capital of Shah 'Abbas the Great. After its brief glory under the governorship of Iskandar (812—817/ 1409—14), son of'Umar Shaikh, Shiraz never again assumed the leadership in Persian painting; but itremained for ahundred and fifty yearsa fruitful workshop, from which indeed the largest number of illuminated manuscripts emanated. This phenomenon has not sofar been explained: why should the merchant class ofthis city have supported the art more than that ofany other city ofIran? It may, however,be historically significant, because it was from this Shiraz school that the painting styles of the Indian sultanates were mainly derived. Both the earliest written sources which have come down tous and modern scholarship have treated ofthe history ofminiature painting throughout the period of this volume as fundamentally a single development in time, shifting as wehave indicated from one centre to another to follow the course of patronage. Anything outside this single line has been regarded as "provincial", which in effect has been taken to mean retarded, unoriginal or crude. It is a question, however, whether this scheme does not tend to overemphasise the importance of royal patronage, although nodoubt economic necessity would have made some support necessary during the long period of production required for an illuminated manuscript, with the use of costly materials and the need for thecollaboration of several different specialist craftsmen and artists - calligrapher, illuminator, miniaturist and binder at least. Moreover, only in princely libraries would the artists have had access to models and former masterpieces. We shall be able to show that itwas not always the political leaders who provided this patronage but, on the contrary, often the less effective members of the ruling families who gave their time and money to artistic commissions. In particular, the situation in the lifetime ofTlmur isat first sight unexpected. Although we know that he carried off from the captured cities of Iran tohis new capital ofSamarqand leading artists and craftsmen,

THE TIMURID PICTORIAL ARTS
including the famous calligrapher of Tabriz, Mu'In al-Dln and the
painter 'Abd al-Haiy,1 we do not know of a single fine manuscript produced in Samarqand during the lifetime of Tlmur. The calligraphers and illuminators must have been fully occupied with the designing ofthe decoration forthe many splendid buildings, permanent and temporary, which Tlmur was putting up with feverish haste; nearly every famous scribe of these times also designed theinscriptions for public buildings, and we hear ofwall-paintings inthe garden pavilions and figured embroideries in thetents which still were the favourite dwellings ofthe conqueror. Thus it is that the Timurid style ofminiature painting was not developed in Samarqand nor even in one of the seats of Timurid rule but in theprecarious capitals of the last of the Jalayirids, Sultan Ahmad. It was only after the death ofTTmur that this style was adopted by his descendants, but with some modification, especially towards greater energy. While technically the change from Mongol to Timurid painting is smoothly achieved and without radical change in visual structure, the psychological adjustment is notable. It is symbolised bythe fact that romantic and lyrical poetry was not within the range ofthe Il-Khanid
school, which, as Professor Grabar has pointed out,2 was concerned with the Shdh-nama as a mirror of the destiny of dynasties and the tragic involvement with fate. Otherwise the school wasoccupied by the illustration ofhistory and ofbooks of instruction. The change issymbolised by the fact that the Khamsa ofNizami was not included in the Mongol repertory; but at the end of the 8th/i4th century this situation changed decisively. We now have a copy of the
Khamsa dated 788-90/1386—8,3 in nasta'liq by Mahmud b. Muhammad at Baghdad when it was a capital of Sultan Ahmad Jalayir. It contains twenty-three miniatures. Then follows a very fine Khusrau u Shtrin in
the Freer Gallery,4 copied by'AH b. Hasan al-Sultanl "in the capitalof the kingdom Tabriz" and undated, but attributable to the end of the Jalayirid period between 1405 and 1410. The new tradition isimmediately taken up again in the library of Iskandar at Shlraz, where in 813—14/141 o—11 illustrations to the Khamsa are among the miniatures

of the two famous anthologies prepared for this Timurid princely patron. It may therefore be inferred that the change ofsubject at this time signified achange of direction in the cultural spirit of the Jalayirid court. They were of Mongol stock and claimed the main direct succession from theIl-Khanid tradition, butthey lived in a completely Iranicised milieu, to which they personally contributed as writers and artists. Sultan Shaikh Uvais (757—76/1356—74) was a notable builder: his patronage of the painter Shams al-Dln was recorded by Dust
Muhammad.1 With Sultan Ahmad Jalayir we enter on aperiod where the literary sources can be directly connected with surviving illustrated manuscripts. Ahmad secured the control of the kingdoms of Iraq and Azarbaijan by 784/1382, and Baghdad and Tabriz remained his alternate capitals so long as he was master of those cities. Coins were minted in Tabriz in his name in 1383, but the city was seized by Tokhtam'ish of the Golden Horde in 787/1385, and it was occupied by Tlmur in 788/1386, when Mlran Shah was installed asgovernor. It remained inTimurid hands until the death ofTlmur in 807/1405, when it fell to the Shlrvan-Shah for a year. Sultan Ahmad was welcomed back bythe inhabitants in 1406 but he survived only till 813/1410, when hewas defeated and killed by Qara Yusuf of the Qara Quyunlu. Baghdad was held by Ahmad until 795/1393, when itwas taken and sacked by Tlmur, and he fled to Syria and Egypt. However, hewas soon able to return and remained incontrol until 803/1401, when it again fell to Tlmur, while Sultan Ahmad took refuge with the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid. The surviving manuscripts produced for Sultan Ahmad fall in the years 1386 to 1388, 1392, 1396 and 1399, in all of which he was in control of Baghdad. The leading master at the court ofSultan Ahmad was 'Abd al-Haiy, pupil ofShams al-Dln, until he was removed by Tlmur in 795/1393to his new capital inSamarqand. Junaid, pupil of'Abd al-Haiy, remained in Baghdad, and the most famous surviving manuscript from Sultan Ahmad's library, thecelebrated Khamsa dated 1396 of Khwaju of Kirman in theBritish Library, bears his signature on one of the
miniatures.2 The nine illustrations ofthis manuscript3 are worthy of a

master on account ofthe originality of the compositions and the brilliance ofthe colouring in which they are executed (pi. 47). Stchoukine considers that they are all by asingle hand, but itmay be that two (nos. 1 and 7)are by another painter. Two other manuscripts assignedby their colophons to the court of Sultan Ahmad are an 'Aja'ib al-makhluqat,copied in 1388 and now in the Bibliotheque Nationale
(Supp. pers. 332)1, and the Khamsa ofNizamI, already referred toand dated 1386-8 from Baghdad. The twenty-three miniatures of this latter manuscript are much simpler than those of the Khwaju manuscript, but show similar, rather stiff figures of men and horses; similar conventions forthe rendering offoliage and rocky ground; and in some cases similar extension ofthe miniature into the margins ofthe page. Rich colour is common toboth manuscripts, with the use ofgold for the sky asan alternative toa cobalt blue, but oflapis in some of the costumes and other textiles. At least one ofthe carpet designs iscommon to both, and these are among the earliest designs known tous; and the best miniatures show something of the same movement, especially apparept in the "prostration of Shlrln (fol. 88a) before Khusrau" (pi. 48). But although all the elements ofthe new style are there, they are not yet developed into the spacious and romantic miniature style ofthe Khwaju. The 'AJd'ib al-makhluqat with its numerous miniatures shows less of this new spirit, but this istobe expected of a work of this character, with its traditional subject matter, largely astronomical. The few figure subjects are, however, quite comparable with the NizamI miniatures, and there seems no need to assign, with Stchoukine, these illustrations to alater period. Another manuscript in the same library, clearly dated 1392 and apparently produced for Shah
Valad, son ofSultan Ahmad, isa Kalilava Dimna2 (Pers. 913) ofsmall format but illustrated byseventy-four miniatures contemporary with the text and therefore of the Jalayirid school of Baghdad. Some of them aremore forward-looking than anything in Supp. pers. 332, especially in the importance given to landscape. There is one other manuscript dated 1399, which has been plausibly attributed to the same

school. Entitled theKitdb al-bulhdn (Bodleian, Or. 133),1 this is an account of the Seven Climes of the Ptolemaic cosmology and is enriched by seventy-eight miniatures, including eleven of the Seasons. These have been attributed by D.S. Rice to an Italian prototype which might have been available in the cosmopolitan capital of the Jalayir at Baghdad, where itwas produced. The flat schematic architecture might be thought primitive, but itis enlivened by shading of the tiled surfaces and rather prefigures the scenic convention that was to prevail into the early Timurid period. The tree and plant conventions are those common inthe Jalayirid school, and Chinese influence is clear in the water and cloud patterns, and is shown in the dragon-headed snake (fol. 33V). These two pseudo-scientific manuscripts of 1388 and 1399 accentuate the exceptional quality of the Khwaju: they serve also to bridge the gap between the Jalayirid school of Tabriz and Baghdad and the school ofShlraz under the Muzaffarids. A precursor of the Kitdbal-bulbdn is a dispersed scientific dictionary
entitled Mu'nis al-ahrdr, dated 1341 from Shlraz,2 when itwas still ruled by the Tnjii dynasty. For landscape elements in the Jalayirid manuscripts we might compare the Muzaffarid Shdh-ndma of 1370 in
Istanbul.3 Here we see elegant little plant clumps, and above all a better relation of figures to the scale ofthe page than is found ineither the Tabriz or the Shlraz manuscripts of the first half of the century. There are some fine detached Shdh-ndma illustrations mounted in an album in the Topkapi library (Hazine 215 3),** which clearly develop out of the Tabriz style of the Il-Khanid period and retain the great size of the page used in the Rashldiyya scriptorium ofRashld al-Dln, but areso advanced that they can hardly be put before 1370; yet they retain the epic character of the time of Abu Sa'Id, only modified by the reduction in scale of the figures in relation to the landscape. Ifthis date is correct, then this solution of the proper relation of figures andpage was reached independently at about the same date in Shlraz and Tabriz.

THE TIMURID PICTORIAL ARTS
Thanks to closer familiarity with Chinese painting and to more discriminating patronage, the Tabriz landscapes are more developed. Yet the later Jalayirid miniatures seem toowe as much tothe Shlraz tradition as to that of Tabriz. At the same time in Shlraz, the economy of visual terms both in figures and in landscape was inherited in the early Timurid period, but refined by greater skill in draughtsmanship and enriched by freer use ofgold, silver and lapis lazuli, now within the command of the rulers of an empire. Shlraz inthe 13 90s thus saw the birth ofa new style, which developed naturally out of the Muzaffarid, when it was brought into touch with the achievements of the Jalayirid masters in Tabriz and Baghdad. Twin volumes of epic poetry dated 1397 and now in the British
Library1 and the Chester Beatty Library, Dublin,2 show the vigour and sense of striking design ofShlraz under the Muzaffarids refined by the sensitive draughtsmanship and fine colour sense of the Jalayirid school. At Shlraz the prince who represented the ruling house was Iskandar, son of'Umar Shaikh. He was twice governor ofFars, from
1394 to 1399, w n e n i n his early teens, and again from 812/1409 to 817/1414. These two volumes ofepics might well have appealed to a precocious boy of thirteen, with their strongly romantic feeling and direct drama. They still keep the simplicity ofcomposition which has all along been acharacteristic of the Shlraz school. This indeed continues in the much more sophisticated work in the miniatures illustrating the well known anthologies, orrather compendia, prepared for Iskandar by his scriptorium in 813 -14/141o-11. In them the range of decoration was increased by two means: the employment, for the first time, of double-page compositions extending the full width ofthe open book,
and the introduction of marginal decoration.3 This practice, as distinct from the extension of the miniature into the margin, was apparently first employed inthe Divan of Sultan Ahmad Jalayir, produced in the first years of the 9th/15 th century. The last six pages of this manu
script, which isnow inthe Freer Gallery, Washington,4 are decorated with figures in landscape, inink with touches ofblue and gold, in a closely Chinese style and medium. A similar range of colouring is to be

seen inthe margin decorations ofsome pages inthe smaller Iskandar anthology of 1410. Inthe larger, there are whole pages ofdecorative
work of this same character, veritable climaxes of illumination.1 There are also some marginal miniatures, a feature shared with the Nizaml
Iskandar-nama of small format, now in the British Library,2 which is later than 1410, but also ofShlraz (pi. 49*2). These are a witty novelty, for the artist has used the area, of the text of the poem within the margins as ifit were a curtain from behind which part of the actionis allowed toappear inthe margin: a fallen battle standard, signifying a defeated enemy; two camel-heads and agroom, acaravan; the head ofa sleeping man between two candles; a harp and tambourine, to signify an orchestra. They are really thumb-nail sketches, two inches by one. It was a time ofexperiment and it istherefore not so surprising to find another manuscript, dated 1398 from Bihbihan inFars, inwhich an anthology of seven poets is illustrated by eleven pure landscapesand
only one figure subject (Turk veIslam Miizesi, Istanbul, T. 1950).3 Here the forms oftrees and plants, asthey are found represented in landscapes in other manuscripts of the early Timurid period, have been extracted and arranged as if they were specimens, each depicted in perfection and in fullest visibility, formed into patterns against abackground ofstylised hills in exotic colours. The date of these miniatures has been questioned by Stchoukine, who compares them with those of a Khamsa of Nizaml in theTopkapi Library (Hazine 1510), dated 906/15 o1 but with miniatures which hebelieves to have been added
about 15 70.4 It appears, however, that not only has the date in the colophon of this manuscript been altered but the miniatures have been subsequently greatly overpainted and that their original date may have
been about 1400.5 The full beauty of the early Timurid style of miniature is first seen in the two anthologies made for Iskandar Sultan in 813/1410-1. It comprehends greater freedom of handling, the figures moving in space,

experiment in rendering architectural form; the circular "Hall of Seven
Images", each in adifferent pose;1 the aerial view of the Ka'ba with the gay tents of the pilgrims pitched in the desert outside the walls of Mecca; Iskandar guided by a candle as he walks under the night sky over the rocky path tothe hermit's cave (pi. 49^); orFarhad carrying
Shlrln on her horse at Blsitun by therock-carvings.2 In theother moonlit scene from the Alexander legend, inwhich he watches, con
cealed, the Sirens in their lake home, inthe two versions,3 one in each of these books, this style has reached its height. Imaginative conception and lyrical expression have found a perfect medium, perfect in scale, infeeling and incolour. This isa unique moment inthe history of the Persian school: it passed all too quickly from the youth to the prime of the Timurid school. Iskandar came to an untimely end in 817/1414, and after a brief period when his cousin Ibrahim b. Shah Rukh carried on the Shiraz tradition athis capital Isfahan, the leadership of the school passed to his brother Balsunqur in his father's seat of government, Herat, in the year 823/1420. Of Iskandar the fullest account has been given in his article "Le mecenat timouride" by Jean Aubin, who points tohis great building activity both at Isfahan and at Shiraz; inboth cities he built fortified palaces, perhaps because of the hatred he inspired inthe people by his oppressive rule. As with most ofthe Timurid princes his background was essentially Turki, his mother being a Chaghatai princess; andhe composed poetry in Turki. Nevertheless his taste was formed by Persian culture, which is fully reflected in the two anthologies; but these also contain astronomical calculations, and in one is included a Shl'I treatise on law. Aubin considers that his interest in mysticism was only superficial, but that would not prevent genuine feeling having been entertained by some of the artists who worked for him. The Gulbenkian manuscript includes a double-page composition showing Christians of Najran recognise the Prophet (fols. 265—6). Both pages are resplendent ingold, light and dark clouds ofglory on the right; and
eleven figures writhing in flames onthe left leaf.4 This is probably a unique document for its subject: in style too itis unusual; itmay be one of several miniatures in this manuscript which show Western influence,

perhaps Byzantine, transmitted therefore through Tabriz. For the head of Iskandar's library in Shlraz was Ma'ruf BaghdadI, certainly not the only leading artist attracted to him from the falling power of the Jalayirid Sultan Ahmad. Later Ma'ruf removed to Herat to serve Shah Rukh, but was involved in 830/1427 in an attempted assassination of his patron by a Huruf I fanatic, of which heretical movement he was an
adherent.1 It has been suggested that Iskandar may also have been affected by this heresy, which seems to have gone under the cloak of Shi'ism. One of its tenets was the mystical or divine value of certain or all of the letters of the Arabic alphabet, a doctrine likely to appeal to an aesthete and to a calligrapher. It should be stressed, however, that there isno historical evidence tosupport this suggestion, which remains apure surmise. The two anthologies produced forIskandar Sultan are also of crucial importance for their illumination. The Gulbenkian book has perhaps the finest sar-lauh (frontispieces) (pi. 50) of the early Timurid school. The second double opening is laid out very like the tile mosaic decoration on the buildings of the period, and it is in fact possible to find a close parallel for these pages in the entrance gateway to the madrasa of Ulugh Beg, cousin of Iskandar, in the Rlgistan at Samarqand, which was built between 1417 and 1420. The central rosace, so like aGothic rose window both in its layout and in the splendour of its floral arabesque decoration, resembles a similar feature in the architectural decoration of
this gate;2 while the stylised Kufic circles and diamonds in the framework on the page are echoed elsewhere in the decor of the madrasa. We know that other artists of the book, the calligraphers, were quite often employed to design the monumental inscriptions on buildings; and it is likely that the miniaturists also contributed to the decoration of Tlmur's palaces and tented camps at Samarqand as they are described by the
Castilian envoy Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo.3 The special position of these two anthologies has already been stressed; it remains to point to two other features which distinguish them, the first of which had no continuing future, the second onlyto be taken up and developed ina much later period. Each manuscript contains double-page compositions which are thus not so much larger than the normal size, as different in shape and organisation. As has

The practice does, however, destroy the unity of the book, of text and illustration, which had just been perfectly achieved: consequently it is not surprising that the doublepage composition is in future generally reserved for the frontispiece, the most striking exceptions being the illustrations toa manuscript of Sharaf al-Dln 'All Yazdl's Zafar-ndma,copied in 1467 and now in the
Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore.1 The second innovation in the two anthologies isthe introduction ofmarginal decoration, inthe form of ornamental or figural thumb-pieces. In some of the miniatures of the two Iskandar anthologies the older Shiraz tradition still predominates, though their forthrightness is
modified by the polish and sophistication of the Jalayirid school.2 The strength of this old tradition was, however, sufficient for it to become once more dominant after the death of Iskandar and the succession to the governorship of Fars of his cousin Ibrahim b. Shah Rukh, who ruled fortwenty years. This is immediately apparent in the principal surviving manuscripts from Shiraz and Isfahan of this period, the
anthology of the Berlin Museum of1420,3 which was apresent sent by Ibrahim tohis brother Balsunqur; and a manuscript ofthe Shdh-ndma with forty-seven miniatures in the Bodleian Library (Ouseley Add. 176) dedicated tothe prince himself and probably datable to1432—4,
the last years of his life.4 The tradition is continued in two ShlrazI manuscripts of 839/1435-6, a Khamsa of Nizami in the British
Museum,5 which still retains some of the romantic quality of the Jalayirid tradition; and aZafar-ndma ofSharaf al-Dln, whose miniatures are
now widely scattered.6 In both these manuscripts invention is still shown inthe compositions, atleast equal to that in the Tbrahlm manu

scripts, the calligraphy and illumination also still as fine ascould be found in Herat. Ibrahim himself designed inscriptions for the monuments of Shlraz and Isfahan (but no longer extant) and hegathered about him a "numerous concourse ofscholars and men oftalent". It seems tohave been the political decline ofthe Timurids which rather soon after this date made Shlraz a provincial centre, though evenas late as 1444 aShdh-ndma manuscript shows alargeness of design as well as a vigour of drawing, especially in thedouble-page frontispiece
feasting scene,1 which is refreshing. The finer, more sophisticated tradition had long since passed to Herat, where Balsunqur, Ibrahim's younger brother, had established himself as the leading patron of his generation, not later than 1425. Indeed in calligraphy it was clearly pre-eminent by 1420, when he returned from a punitive expedition to Tabriz, bringing with him Maulana Ja'far Tabrlzl, master ofthe nasta'llq script, Sayyid Ahmad the painter (naqqash), Khwaja 'All the designer (musavvir), and Qivam
al-Din the binder.2 By 1421 Ja'far was using the style al-Balsunqurl, but the earliest of the manuscripts with minatures attested as made for him are two elegant little volumes dated 830/1426-7, aGulistdn of Sa'di copied byJa'far himself and ananthology copied by Muhammad b. Husam called Shams al-Din al-Sultanl, and a third manuscript of the following year of the Humdiu Humdyiin of Khwaju KirmanI also copied by the latter scribe. The Gulistdn,now inthe Chester Beatty libraryin
Dublin,3 isone ofthe most exquisite ofPersian manuscripts; its eight deceptively simple miniatures conceal a fresh and daring treatment of the picture space. Three of them show different experiments in the use of the bent wall and the open door in it, to make aclosed stage for the action, while suggesting an inner world communicating with the outside through thehalf-open doorway. Each figure is related to the others by gestures which are quietly expressive. The stiff figures of the Jalayirid school have come alive. Asimilar advance has been madein the treatment of the landscape; by cutting off the line of the sky not far above the ridge of the hill. This practice had been tried out somewhat timidly in the Jalayirid Khamsa of Nizaml of1386-8, but the effect was much reduced by bringing the figures too near the front of the compo

sition; whereas now Baisunqur's painters had learnt how to push back the hori2on. The text of the poem floats in front ofthe composition and serves asa curtain concealing the fardistance. The colouring is cool, and has been compared by Robinson to diamonds and pearls. Actually turquoise, blue and green are predominant. Like the Junaid miniatures, these are also full-page and again, like them, introduce beautiful decorative inscriptions on the buildings depicted. The Herat court style has been born. How much credit for this should be given to Balsunqur personallyis difficult to determine. Herat was now the principal seat of Timurid power under Shah Rukh, and sowould naturally have attractedthe more ambitious artists. At the same time it was twenty years after the death of Timur and the emergence ofShah Rukh as his successor that this school showed its first fruits, and they were seen then only in Baisunqur's manuscripts. Though overshadowed by his son Balsunqur, Shah Rukh was still an important patron of the arts of the book. While Balsunqur was editing a new recension ofthe Shah-nama, his father was assuming the mantle of the great Il-Khanid minister, vizier and historian Rashld al-Dln. He tried to re-establish the original text by collating the manuscripts which hecould find, and heentrusted Hafiz-i Abru withthe task of bringing the history up to date in his Majma' al-tavarikh. He was equally careful in having the original illustrations of theJami' al-tavarikh copied and in continuing this tradition of illustrated history.
Ettinghausen1 has aptly given the name of the "historical style" to this Timurid extension of the Il-Khanid style. Examples of it are to be seen in Hazine 1653 and 1654 inthe Topkapi Sarayi library; inthe famous Jami' al-tavarikh of the Bibliotheque Nationale, originally published by Blochet ascontemporary with the author; and in a widely dispersed manuscript of the Majma' al-tavarikh of about 1423. However, the greatest surviving monument tothe taste ofShah Rukh as apatron of the arts ofthe book lies inthe Mir'aj-nama orvisionary journey ofthe Prophet Muhammad, copied at Herat in 1436 by Malik Bakhshi in
Uighur script.2 This mystical work is lavishly illustrated in gold and

blue. Apart from their iconographical interest, these miniatures show the continuation inHerat of the style of the Gulbenkian anthology of Iskandar of 1410, with rather large stiff figures and simple architecture and landscape. So far as the subjects allow, the colour scheme is attractive and expertly handled. So universal is its conception in illustrating the circles of heaven and hell that its miniatures have been found
useful toillustrate Dante.1 The epithet "BakhshI" used with the name of the scribe here designates only aman who can use the Uighur script and does not imply that he was a religious devotee. This manuscript does, however, suggest that Shah Rukh was himself inclined towards this kind of mystical gnosis. Itis therefore acontrast with the epic and romantic poetry copied and illustrated for Balsunqur. After the three exquisite small manuscripts of830/1426-7, the next secure date that we have forthe products of Balsunqur's library is 833/1429-30, inwhich year two famous manuscripts were completed: a Kaltla va Dimna copied by Muhammad b. Husam, and the Shah-ndma
copied by Ja'far al-Balsunqurl,2 recognised since 1931, when it was first shown to the world inthe great Persian exhibition at the Royal Academy in London, asthe masterpiece of its age. If reflection and study now suggest some criticism of it, this does not deprive it of this title. The two outstanding features of the thirty-five miniatures which illustrate it are the skilful and varied compositions and the brilliant colouring. The drawing is not sensitive or fluent but superbly controlled. There is an expert formal relationship between thefigures,but they aresomewhat stiff and lack sensibility. There is a conceptual rather than a visual perspective, but it is consistently applied. The two divanscenes and the "Bedroom of Rudaba" are rigidly frontal, with the carpets and tiled floors seen directly from above and thus in continuous line with the back wall. No attempt is made toaccommodate the thrones inthe layout: one isfrontally seen; the other in bias, but with no adjustment of the front elevation. In the "Gulnar at the Window seeing Ardashlr" some relief is given by the irregular shape of the courtyard and the bias wall ofthe tower, but there is anunresolved difficulty where this should meet the top of the page. The artist has shirked this and simply continued the tiling to the margin. In the "funeral of Faramurz" the two coffins of Rustam and Zavara in the

domed tomb chamber are shown in a kind of aerial perspective, whereas the tiled floor onwhich they should stand is rigidly frontal, but apparently intended to be stepped up at each of the arcade pillars of the frontal screen. The walls of the courtyard in the foreground are impossible to reconcile with any system. On the other hand, the elaborate architecture of the Brazen Hold inwhich Isfandiyar isslaying the tyrant Arjasp (pi. 51) is avery interesting attempt ataerial perspective. The throne room, which is the centre of the drama, is again seen in front view, with no allowance for the different planes of floor and wall; but all the rest of the composition is arranged so as to radiate outwards from this point. Circular composing had already been seen in the Iskandar anthology, but there the interior view permitted ofa simple solution by cutting off the circle at the bottom of the page, which thus forms a hemicircle. The two encircling walls of the castle are depicted as diverging from the gateways; there-entrant of the inner wall is depicted toshow the inside, leaving an extremely awkward truncation at the corner, where the artist has covered his confusion byfillingin the whole background with tilework on a straight plane. For all this difficulty, this is an able and cunning picture of a castle seen from above. It also conveys a good conceptual view of tile-mosaic clad buildings ofthe period, with monumental inscriptions running round the cornices. The other Balsunqur manuscripts deal with these architectural problems inthe same way; yet with greater trouble. For instance, in the
Berenson anthology,1 the tower ina similar love story isrevealed asa cardboard piece ofscenery where it meets the tiled floor ofthe courtyard in such a way as to make egress impossible. In the landscape scenes, thetransition from low ground towards a high horizon is already an established convention, here used in an interesting way when the action requires the actors in a scene toenter into the rocky background, as in the "Combat of Gudarz andPlran", "Zahhak pinned to mount Damavand" or "Rustam killing the White Dlv"; in all of which themountain build-up is effectively suggested. In the
Jalayirid landscapes ("Humai and Humayun fighting", for instance),2 the mountains enclose the action; in the Iskandar anthology, figures and mountains have not come to terms: the figures have to move along

smooth paths leading past the rocky peaks. In each case this entry into the mountain zone isemphasised by the presence ofhorses orhorsemen outside it, in the plain below. This more realistic approach is emphasised by the greater naturalism of the trees, though they are still partly conceptual. The free extension of many of these miniatures into the margins has allowed the miniaturists to achieve more spacious settings without losing coherence or pictorial unity. Indeed the close-knit compositions of this great manuscript are its most striking virtue. The second manuscript of the year 833/1429—30, the Kaltla va Dimna
(Topkapi Sarayi library, Revan 1022),1 has many features in common with the Shah-ndma: for instance, the smooth but knotted trunks of the trees, the stiff figures and the rich colouring. The usual manner of depicting the rocky scenery, which again forms the landscape setting, is a spongy scalloped edge shading off into a neutral ground covered with small conventional plants. There is often a repoussoir ofdarker shaded ground in the foreground. Once more the miniatures frequently overlap the marginated area into the margin; crisply drawn and brightly coloured separate large plants are a special feature. The skies are a deep blue. Animals and birds arevery precisely, even harshly, drawn. Recently, another manuscript ofthe same work, copied a year later in 834/1431 by Ja'far al-Balsunquri, has been discovered in the Topkapi Sarayi library (Hazine 362) byRobinson, who has putforward an interesting theory to account for the production of two copies
of the same book for Prince Balsunqur within two years.2 According to this theory, the Herat library, of which Ja'far was head, would have produced two classes of manuscript, one for "public" use, excelling in the academic qualities of formal accomplishment and finish, the other for the prince's private enjoyment, in which sensibility was allowed more play. Inthe second group, inaddition tothe Hazine 362 manuscript, he places the Chester Beatty Gulistan of 1427. It will be noticed that both these manuscripts were copies by Ja'far himself; but he also copied the Shah-nama, which isthe very archetype of the accomplished academic. For this reason, as well as on the more general ground that it

is hard to see in what sense theacademic books were "public" in a society where there was no public access to fine manuscripts of any kind, outside works of religious instruction kept in mosques or madrasas, the distinction is hard to accept inthese terms. Moreover, the essential difference between these two manuscripts lies not in the quality of the calligraphy or illumination, but in the miniatures. Either, therefore, Balsunqur with his connoisseur's discrimination was dissatisfied with the 1430 manuscript of Kalila va Dimna and commissioned another immediately, or he may have given the first away to some other bibliophile andwished to replace it. In either case the art historian's task is to seek to identify thehands of the miniaturists responsible for each of these series. Unfortunately, there is a complete absence of signed work from the Balsunqur kitdbkhdna;and we can only fall back upon the names recorded inliterary sources, which are not contemporary. Apart from Sayyid Ahmad and Khwaja 'All mentioned already as foundation members of this library in 1420, we hear of Ghiyas al-Din as attached by Balsunqur toShah Rukh's embassy to China in 1419-22 and of the leading master of Herat in this period, Khalil, who may have been in charge ofthe production ofthe great Sbdh-ndma of 1430, if this can bethe manuscript referred to byDust Muhammad asordered by Balsunqur in rivalry with anepic volume produced for Ahmad Jalayir. If this is right, then Amir Khalil is the pre-eminent master of the "academic" style, still drawing the stiff figures ofthe Jalayirid tradition; mentioned by Daulatshah as oneof the "four talented artists atthe court ofShah Rukh, who in their time
had no peer".1 Robinson, on the other hand, thinks that Amir Khalil was the master responsible for the miniatures of the "second" Kalila va Dimna of 834/1431 (Hazine 362) and also of the Gulistdn of 1426, because of his known intimacy with Balsunqur. The alternative for the role of the "sensitive" artist is Ghiyas al-DIn or possibly Sayyid Ahmad: we do not know. Certainly the miniatures inHazine 362 are more forward-looking, naturalistic and sensitive, but their designer is less good atdepicting animals, less dramatic, perhaps also not so good a colourist. The death of Balsunqur of drink and dissipation in 837/ 1433 brought to an end this unique combination of artists; but the Herat school held its pre-eminence for another fifteen years. Its mastery is illustrated not only bythe Mir'dj-ndmaof 1436 but

also, more typically, by theRoyal Asiatic Society Shdh-ndma with "dedication" to Muhammad Juki, younger son of Shah Rukh. This
identification was made in 1931 by J.V.S. Wilkinson1 on the basis of an inscribed battle standard inone of its miniatures, which illustrates the shooting ofIsfandiyar by Rustam: al-Sultdn al-a\am Muhammad Juki. His cautious attribution hasbeen amply sustained by subsequent scholarship, and it may be accepted as a work ofthe Herat schoolof about 1440. Muhammad Juki is reported to have suffered from a lingering disease before hisdeath in Sarakhs in 848/1445, perhaps hastened by the hostility ofGauhar Shad, the masterful wife ofShah
Rukh. A comparison of the miniatures inthis manuscript2 with those of the Balsunqur Shdh-ndma of only about ten years earlier indicates the change of direction which was taking place in Timurid painting atthis time. The marked reduction in scale of the Muhammad Juki book is an aspect of the increased importance given to landscape. This in turn indicates a new emphasis which issummed up by Laurence Binyonin the judgment that "the whole work is saturated in romantic atmosphere". This effect is achieved by theuse of the same elements as before, deployed with greater freedom: the coral-like rocks have proliferated; foliage ofthe trees ismore variegated; cloud forms are endlessly complicated with curdled and highly coloured shapes; above all architecture is now romantically related to mountains whose peaks it crowns or rivals (pi. 5 2). There is considerable range of quality as between the miniatures, and it is worth looking at some ofthe more significant pages. Robinson pointed to some clear ShirazI elements which appear especially in the battle scenes and has suggested that some artists from the library of Ibrahim Sultan after hisdeath in 838/1435 may have migrated to Herat. This might explain the return of certain earlier features of the Shiraz school, such as the use of coulisses in landscapes and the foreshortening of horses. It could also have contributed to the greater drama, even though the figures arestill rather stiff. The relationship to Shiraz has been illustrated by Robinson from the only double-page composition in the manuscript, a battle scene of which the left half is a confused milee, while the right shows an ordered array. This isessentially backward-looking; whereas another battle on asingle page (fol. 430V) shows an open composition in which

there is balance and harmony, prefiguring in its complexity the mature art of the period of Bihzad towards theclose of the century. The "Tahmina coming to Rustam's chamber" has been exhaustively discussed by Eric Schroeder in connection with another version of this
scene in the Fogg Museum, Harvard,1 which he attributes to the period of Sultan Iskandar and to the hand of Pir Ahmad Bagh-Shimall, an artist mentioned by Dust Muhammad as the zenith of his time, which appears tobe the early 9th/15 th century. Leaving aside the justness of this attribution, we may admit the priority of the Fogg miniature and the debt of Muhammad Juki's artists to the painters trained in the Jalayirid tradition. Schroeder also associated the Fogg miniature with the miniatures ina Kalila va Dimna manuscript inthe Gulistan library, Tehran, then generally attributed to the period 1410 to 1420. The
situation of this important and beautiful manuscript2 must now be considered in conjunction with some others. The political confusion which followed upon the deaths of Shah Rukh in 850/1447 and of Ulugh Beg in 853/1449 and the diminished resources ofthe Timurid house would already account for a break in artistic production at this point: moreover Herat which had been the centre of the school for thirty years had a particularly unstable history during the next twenty. Sultan Abu Sa'Id b.Mlran Shah made it his capital for the decade 863/1458 to 872/1468 (after the city had submitted toJahan Shah of the Qara Quyunlu Turkmen for six months). No manuscript with miniatures from this time is known: for the dedication of an anthology inthe Chester Beatty Library tohim istobe rejected on account of the date of 1475 in itscolophon, eight years after his death. While this date isprobably approximately correct, the evidence of the colophons issuspect and to be rejected. In this third quarter of the 9th/15 th century the leading political power inIran and far tothe west ofit was that ofthe Turkmen, first under theQara Quyunlu (Black Sheep) ruler Jahan Shah (838—72/ 1435—67) and then under the Aq Quyunlu (White Sheep) ruler Uzun Hasan (872-82/1467-78). Their capital was generally established at Tabriz in Turki-speaking Azarbaljan; but they had very wide dominions both in Anatolia and in Iran. It is only recently that important illuminated manuscripts have been identified as products atthe courts

of these two rulers. The earliest is a manuscript of the Kbamsa of
Jamali1 (India Office Library, Ethe 1284), copied in Baghdad in 869/1465, atatime when this city was in the hands of Jahan Shah. The miniatures are in the Timurid Herat tradition with stiff but elegant figures in simple landscapes. Although they lack the compositional felicities of the Herat school of the second quarter of the century, they excel in the beauty ofthe colouring, mainly in a range of blues and greens, andstill show a capacity for skilful arrangement of many figures. The four illuminated headings are ofgreat beauty, fully equal to the famous tilework inthe celebrated "Blue mosque" at Tabriz of the same year. Even richer is the illumination lavished on acopy of the history of Hafiz-i Abru now in the Topkapi Sarayi Library (Bagdat 282), which must date from this period. It must therefore be assumed that one ortwo ofthe artists trained inthe Herat library must by this date have migrated to the court of Jahan Shah; but some of them also seem to have moved to the court of the Shlrvan-Shah Farrukh-Yasar at Shamakhi in northern Azarbaljan. An anthology in the British Library (Add. 16, 561) copied in 1468 inShamakhi contains eight miniatures in a simplified style of figure drawing, but the landscapes are still completely in the Herat tradition with emphasis on beautiful flowering trees. The most remarkable of them depicts the city of Baghdad under
flood,2 a complex bird's-eye view with shifting viewpoint so that each building is seen directly inperspective. For comparison, one can turn to the "Siege ofGang-Bihist" orthe "Isfandiyar slaying Arjasp in the Iron Fortress" ofthe Juki Sbah-nama of 1440, asstriking examples of the same application of the principle of frontality.
Next in date comes a Kbamsa of NizamI in the Topkapi Library
(Hazine 761),3 dated 866/1461 and 881/1476 andcopied by Fakhr al-Dln Ahmad, with sixteen miniatures and again exquisite illumination. This was produced for Pir Budaq atBaghdad and completed for Uzun Hasan in 1476; while amanuscript of the Divanof Hidayat in the
Chester Beatty Library (Turk. 401)4 was copied in 1476—8 for the library of his sonSultan Khalll (d. 1478). These also show a close connection with the Herat school; but with a certain naivety. Uzun Hasan had died 882/1478 and was succeeded by his son Ya'qiib (883—96/

1479-90). Fortunately again we have a manuscript whose colophon records that the text of the Khamsa of Nizami was copied by 'Abd al-Rahim b. 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sultani al-Ya'qubl at Tabriz the capital
of the kingdom in 886/1481 (Hazine 762 inthe Topkapi Library).1 Of the nineteen miniatures in this manuscript, ten appear to be contemporary with the copying and in an enriched version of the Herat Timurid style, while the remainder have been added later, asis clear from the Safavid kulahwhich is introduced into the costumes. The style of these is even richer and the artist has taken advantage ofthe margins tomake delightful landscape settings. Three miniatures have been separated at
some time from this manuscript and are now in a private collection.2 One of these miniatures bears the date 910/ 1504—5 (pi. 36). By that date Tabriz had fallen to the victorious Isma'Il, who was still only seventeen years old. The date seems acceptable also for the early Safavid miniatures which remain inthe manuscript. They can therefore be taken toshow the continuance ofthis Tabriz Turkmen style into the early ioth/i6th century and the Safavid period. They make a great contrast with the Bihzad style which was by then dominant in Khurasan. Now that aclear view of a court style under the Turkmen dynasties
is possible and indeed necessary,3 on thebasis of the manuscripts mentioned it is possible also to attribute some others to this same school. The most important of these are three manuscripts of different dates. The Tabarl Ta'rikh al-rusul wa!l-muluk, ("Annals of the Prophets
and Kings"), copied in 874/1470 (Chester Beatty P. 144),4 the four miniatures ofwhich are ina very conventional extension ofthe Herat style, can now be seen to be characteristic work of Uzun Hasan's library. The "Bahram Gur attacking a lion" (pi. 5 3) shows a composi
tion5 parallel with those ofthe Balsunqur 1430 Shah-nama (fol. 154b), while they also resemble the miniatures in aKulliyyat-i tdrikhiyya copied

The composition was used once more in the Nizami MS inthe Metropolitan Museum, 1913-228-13, a Haft paikar long controversial for its date.

In spite of this weighty support, the present writer believes that these miniatures are 16th century copies after originals in early Timurid style.

for Shah Rukh and now in the Topkapi Library. At the same time the lion and reedy stream in the foreground of this miniature recall several of the subjects of the Kalf/a va Dimna in the Gulistan Library. As mentioned above this manuscript has been for the past forty years attributed to the early Timurid period, until recently when Robinson suggested that it might be as late as 1460— 5.' This would bring it near the period of Bihzad, while the figure drawing is still stiff and oldfashioned. The solution may well be toattribute this, one ofthe most beautiful of Persian manuscripts, to the years 1450—60 under Jahan Shah, when some masters trained in the Timurid school in Herat in the time ofBalsunqur might still have been alive and working, and have had access to the original designs forthe Balsunqur copies, now in Istanbul, containing miniatures with nearly identical compositions,in two cases inreverse. This strongly suggests the use of pounces, which may by this time have been part ofthe miniaturist's workshop equipment. Itappears that they were in common use in the 9th/15 th century. They were certainly then used for the gold decoration of margins, as in some poetical manuscripts, for instance ananthology in the Chester
Beatty Library copied by Ja'far al-Tabriz! in 1432.2 At the same time there are many new compositions and the landscapes and animal drawing are more sympathetic (pi. 5 4) than those in either of the Balsunqur manuscripts. Of the thirty miniatures, seven are repeated from the 1432 book, allbut two ofthem scenes with human figures. Atlatest they must have been executed before 1468, when the frontispiece composi
tion was borrowed3 foruse in the Shamakhl anthology of that year mentioned above, inaclumsy copy, for the production ofwhich the Gulistan Kalilava Dimnamanuscript must have been accessible. Thus we must accept the idea that the court of the Turkmen rulers in Azarbaljan provided the enlightened patronage forthe arts of the book during the period when this failed in Herat owing to the disturbed political conditions in theTimurid dominions further east. Ya'qub Beg remained a friend of Persian culture to the end of his life in 896/1490, and was exchanging manuscripts with Mir 'All Shir Nava'T during the heyday of the Herat atelier, from which he received the gift of a complete set of the works of the poet and mystic Jami. Sultan Husain Balqara was able toestablish his capital in Herat in 873/1469

and he was in undisputed possession from 875/1470, until the rebellion of his sons towards the end of the century. Mir 'All Shir Nava'I joined him there inhis first year and became his closest associate inadministration, though he endeavoured as far as possible to rely upon personal collaboration rather than upon formal office. The great calligrapher Sultan 'All MashhadI had been summoned toHerat by Sultan Husain not later than 1477, and heprobably remained there in the sultan's library until 1502. He copied many of the most famous manuscripts of this period, including both a Gulistdnof i486 and a Biistan of 1488, as well as several manuscripts which remained without miniatures until they were supplied many years later at the Shaibanid court in Bukhara. By 1480 Herat had become that centre of culture and art which is singled out by Babur in his memoirs for such signal praise: "Herat had no equal in the world under Sultan Husain." Some indication of the esteem of letters there may be formed from the reputation of'All Shir Nava'I, who was through and through a literary figure, whose own brother Darvlsh 'All was known asthe Kitdbdarand whose favourite Hajjl Muhammad, whom he himself described as "an angel inhuman shape", was a painter and experimenter in the imitation of Chinese porcelain. He remained in the amir's library until shortly before his death in 906/1501, when he followed the rising star of Badl'
al-Zaman,1 the son and for a short time successor ofSultan Husain. Herat then, though ruled and administered by men of Turkish blood, was a great centre of Persian culture. It was the centre ofan extensive empire still including almost the whole ofmodern Afghanistan, eastern Iran and part ofSoviet Central Asia. Mir 'All Shir Nava'I was agreat builder as well as apatron of letters, and he and his master shared the patronage of Bihzad and of his pupil Qasim 'All. The sultan himself is said to have discovered the talent of the Sayyid MIrak, who had practised calligraphy and illumination before joining the library of
the court, where hebecame head of the painting staff.2 Both Bihzad and Qasim 'All were trained in this library and both continued to work there until the end of the reign. Both MIrak and Hajjl Muhammad died at the time ofthe Uzbek conquest ofthe city in 913/1507. This event then marks the effective end tothe brilliant circle which had gathered at Herat round the sultan and his minister, Mir 'All Shir Nava'I.

The contemporary sources and those of the next two generations do not help usto distinguish between the contributions ofthese several artists to the art of the period, although they record the high esteem in which themasters were held, and the growth of the reputation of Bihzad in thenext century, until he came to overshadow all other Persian painters in retrospect. Nor has it so far proved possible to arrive ata clear and accepted view ofhis style as distinct from that of his contemporaries in Herat from a study of the surviving material
which has up to the present been available forappraisal.1 This still continues to grow, and itwould be rash at the present time to establish stylistic criteria for attribution. Forthese reasons it seems best to attempt here rather to give an account of the school as awhole and its main achievements during the last twenty ortwenty-five years of the 15 th century. By1470 the older Herat tradition had become stereotyped, with the re-use of old motives, astiffening offiguredrawing and a lack of invention and vitality; even though in the best work there was still a good sense of colour and skilled draughtsmanship. Withthe return of patronage to Herat, a fresh breath was infused into the school. At the same time, it is right toemphasise the continuity with the old tradition, the terms ofwhich were still accepted as viable for landscape and architecture, for perspective andthe framework of vision. This acceptance made possible the quick advance which is to be seen in the work of the new masters. Indeed, the first of these seems to have been Shah Muzaffar, the son of the master Mansur, who had been court artist to the Timurid prince Abu Sa'Id. Since Shah Muzaffar is reported to have died at the age of twenty-four, hemust have been active by the 1480s: his name is twice coupled by Babur with thatof Bihzad as outstandingly skilful, and he issaid tohave been a client of 'All Shir Nava'I. He has been thought to represent the more conservative influence at this time, but we lack proof. The earliest work of the school now identifiable can be grouped around the year 1485. This is the date of the copying of the five parts of the Khamsa of'All Shir Nava'I for prince Badl' al-Zaman; of the copying of the Khamsa of Amir Khusrau Dihlavl in the Chester Beatty Library; probably of the doublepage composition of Sultan Husain in hisgarden enclosure, in the
Gulistan Library, Tehran:2 while to the following year can be assigned

the Gulistanfrom the Maurice de Rothschild collection; and probably the thirteen miniatures added to a Khamsaof NizamI copied in 1442
and now in the British Library (Add 25,90c).1 This gives a totalof forty-six miniatures which provide asufficient base for a consideration of the new style. Most are comparatively traditional, but in each gr^up there aresome new experiments, especially a more rhythmical and significant placing of the human figures. The "Khwaja 'Abd-Allah Ansarl with four disciples" and the "Mystics discoursing in a garden" in the Nava'i; the "Khusrau arriving at the palace of Shlrln" in the Amir Khusrau; the right half ofthe garden scene; the "Sa'dl and the youth of Kashghar" in the Gulistan; and the "Camel Fight of the Tribes
of Laila and Majnun" inthe NizamI (pi. 5 j),2 may be singled out for this quality in each of these compositions. Although the next group follows ononly two or three years later and can be thought of as centred onthe year 1490, there is a notable advance in most of the miniatures toa freer, less enclosed movement, usually with more than one centre oraxis. This group consists of the four near-contemporary miniatures of the Mantiq al-tair of 'Attar, copied in 1483, but with a
date of 1487-8 on the fifth miniature;3 ofthe Biistdn dated 1488, but with a miniature dated 1489; and the Khamsa of NizamI copied for Amir 'All FarsI Barlas, itself undated, but one of the twenty-one miniatures bears adate of1494—5. The two earlier manuscripts in this group were prepared in the library of Sultan Husain himself, the third for one of the Turki begs ofthe very powerful Barlas clan in Herat. Yet the three are knit together by frequent repetition of single figures or small groups, sometimes in reverse. They may therefore beconsidered the work of a single atelier or group of artists. There is aless close relation with the earlier group, although there is one clear case of the derivation
of a figure in one of the Nava'I miniatures4 from one in the Mantiq al-tair. It follows that the production of the Khamsaof Nava'I must have continued over several years, just as no doubt did the work on the miniatures of the other manuscripts. It ischaracteristic of the work of
1 The only evidence for the close dating of these miniatures is supplied by adate included in an inscription painted on the frieze on abuilding on fol. 77: the first twofiguresare clear 89; but the third digit, which has been read as both 8 and 1, appears to the present writer to be more probably 5. Ifso, the date would be 895/1490 rather than 1493 or i486.

this whole period that the execution maintains avery high standard of technical skill in every detail. This is notthe place for a detailed discussion of these miniatures and of their possible attribution: this has been done frequently, most thoroughly by Stchoukine and most
recently byRobinson.1 One further manuscript must be mentioned, standing rather apart from any ofthose in either group and with no internal evidence for the date, except that itwas copied as early as 1467 by Shir 'All, though probably not in Herat since itbears the ex librisof Sultan Husain, who was not yet established inthe Timurid capital at that date. This is the Zafar-nama in Baltimore University collection, but for many years inthe Mughal imperial library, during which time the miniatures suffered some lamentable retouching. These are six doublepage openings, which come as near to being history paintings as any of the post-Mongol period. For they are not conventional battle scenes nor romantic illustrations of heroic events, like those in the Shiraz manuscript of 1436 ofthe same text; but serious attempts to reconstruct some ofthe outstanding events inthe career ofthe founder of the empire ofwhich Sultan Husain was the last effective head. It was no doubt because of the wish to depict adequately complex military operations that the double-page format was employed. Scholars of the subject have been unanimous inpraising the original conception and brilliant execution of these miniatures, so far as this is still discernible;
and have with more or less conviction followed Sir Thomas Arnold2 in accepting the attribution of them to Bihzad. He observed that the manuscript had been remarginated before the addition of the miniatures and suggested that a reasonable date forthem might beabout 1490, twenty-three years after the completion of the text. At least, they must be earlier than the death ofSultan Husain in911/1506, since his likeness is used in the representation of Tlmur in the first and last paintings. These are the most complete of all the miniature paintings of the school of Herat under Sultan Husain, while they follow the second group of manuscripts in being built on more than one axis. In the battle scenes effective use is made of straight lines or rectangles to give some stability in what might otherwise have been too diffuse acomposition. In the "Building of the Great Mosque at Samarqand" the

massive elephant moving in on the lower left gives the required sense of movement and direction in what might otherwise have been too rigid and confused a geometric scene. This painting too demonstrates the links between this manuscript and the other products of the school; for several groups of the workers depicted init appear also in the
"Building of the Castle of Khavarnaq"1 in the NizamI of 1495. Others in the first painting are found in the Mantiq al-tair of 1483. The four contemporary miniatures of this manuscript are worthy to be ranged with the Cairo Bustan miniatures, especially the double frontispiece of the "Court of Sultan Husain" and the "King Dara and the Keeper of
the royal horses",2 in their felicities of composition and the loving treatment of animals and of the minor human figures. The sufl mystical and didactic poem by Farld al-Dln 'Attar, the Mantiq al-tair, was indeed well suited to express the spirit of the ruling circle in Herat at this period. Whoever illustrated the manuscript showed that he was familiar with the substance and the intention of this mystical poem, so that theallegation of Michael Rogers that theminiatures have nothing to
do with the text is to be rejected.3 The third of these miniatures (now the
seventh) illustrates two stories:4 inthe foreground Sultan Mahmud aiding the woodcutter whose donkey had fallen and injured him;andin the background a passer-by saying to a drowning man, "You must get rid of your beard or you will surely drown." These stories are widely separated in the poem; one in Discourse XVII and the other in Dis
course XXXIV;5 the first pointing to the value of contact with the wise and noble ruler; the second the need for detachment from earthly ties, such aspride in a fine beard. Thesecond miniature is equally remarkable, though it seems to have only a single reference: a funeral procession is approaching a ha^tra (fenced enclosure for burial) near the tomb of a
holy man,6 where a grave is being dug (pi. 56);presumably illustrating
the question asked of the grave-digger in Discourse XXI:7 "Have you seen a marvel?" To which the answer was: "Thedog of my [carnal] soul has seen me digging graves here for seventy years, but has neither died

nor learnt toobey me." That this miniature was believed tobe by the hand of Bihzad in the ioth/i6th century is shown by a Bukhara simplified version of it in the Walters Art Gallery, which bears that attribution. Both these miniatures show the easy mastery of complex compositions with expressive stance and gesture, and loving treatment of animal life: acat by the saint's tomb and appropriately many birds in a bare tree above it; and the patient donkey in the first scene. Matching the brilliant and sensitive handling of the horses and foals in the "Dara
with the Groom";1 is the treatment of a yoke of ploughing oxen in the
last miniature of the Mantiq al-tair,2 which is once more a double composition set ina country landscape, the most forward-looking of the four. The crouched figure of a Chinese mendicant monk holding a
greyhound inleash, may illustrate the story inDiscourse XLI,3 of the dervish whose love for the daughter of a dog-keeper forced him to take a dog every day tothe bazaar, thus showing that he preferred ridicule to insincerity. The foreground scene directly illustrates the story of Shaikh of Malinah questioning the pious old villager as he follows his ox-drawn plough. If we seek to sum up the characteristics ofthe miniature art ofthe school of Herat at the end of the Timurid period, certain qualities stand out: thesmall scale and low tone of the colouring; theinvention, intimacy and harmony of the compositions; the preference for lyrical, romantic and mystical poetry, rather than epic or history; and consequently the care devoted to the detail of carpet design and architectural decoration. Harmony of man and nature is the outstanding modeof the Persian miniaturist, but at no other time didtheart reachthe sureness oftouch orthe sensitive vision seen inalmost every workof this school. This isthe moment of fruition following the building of a tradition during the early Timurid period, and preceding the richer, more decorative, externalised art of the Safavid achievement. Many of the Herat painters seem to have left the city after its sack by Muhammad ShaibanI Khan in 913/1507, but at this time it does not appear that there was an exodus to Uzbekistan. Itis only after 1520 and long after the death of ShaibanI in 916/1510, that miniatures in the

Herat style appear in Bukhara. One of the first manuscripts produced there is the Khamsa of Nava'I in the Leningrad Public Library (Dorn no. 559), in which most ofthe miniatures have anold-fashioned mid-15th
century look;1 but in one, of "Majnun with the wild animals in the desert", there can be seen the influence of the late Herat school. The four miniatures in a manuscript of the Mihr uMushtarl of 'Assar dated 1523,and now
in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington,2 are farmore accomplished. They already show the tendency to asimplified, unstructural style which was to remain a characteristic of this school. The light-toned colour scheme ofHerat isretained, but brightly coloured blossoming trees are often conspicuous. Not much later come four miniatures in a Baharistan of
JamI in the Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon,3 bearing attributions to Bihzad and very close in style to the 1494—5 Khamsa of Nizaml. A further exodus ofartists from Herat followed the second Uzbek sack of1528, but the school of Bukhara does not seem to have reached its height until the reign of'Abd al-'Aziz Bahadur (946-57/1539-50), who was evidently agreat patron of the arts of the book, with aspecial admiration for the manuscripts of Sultan Husain Balqara. He commissioned miniatures tobe added tomanuscripts written by leading calli
graphers of Herat between 1492 and 1514,4 as well as entirely new books of fine quality and lavishly decorated with gold stencilled margins, such asthe Bustan of Sa'dl copied for him byMir 'AH Haravi
in 1542 andnow in the Gulbenkian Foundation.5 Several of the miniatures inthis manuscript are signed by'Abd-Allah and Mahmud mu%ahhib, who were the leading painters atthe court of'Abd al-'Aziz. One of them derives directly from the Cairo Bustan of 1488, while a double-page frontispiece, signed Mahmud, in a Baharistanof JamI dated 1547, derives directly from the Gulbenkian manuscript of the same work, and ultimately from the Baltimore Zafar-ndma. The Bukhara court painters thus kept alive for two generations the tradition of the Herat school under Sultan Husain. They did also originate; and one of the finest works of Mahmud is the double-page miniature in a Mukhyan al-asrar of Nizaml in the Bibliotheque Nationale (Supp. pers. 985),
signed by Mahmud and dated 1545—6.6 Itshows Sultan Sanjar with his

Similar easy skill of composition isshownin the two miniatures illustrating a manuscript of the Shah u darvish of Hatifl dated 1540 now in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York (MS no. 531). The first is aschool scene (pi. 57) reminiscent again of the Herat school, buta good deal more lively. It bears a date corresponding to 154Z inan inscription over adoorway. How quickly the school declined after 1550 can be seen by comparing this miniature with one ofa similar subject in amanuscript ofthe Gulistan ofSa'dl, dated 1566-7 inLenin
grad, where the figures ofthe pupils are arranged anyhow.1 Itwouldbe easy to find many parallels for this decline into jejune repetition of compositions which have lost allvitality.
METALWORK AND CERAMICS IN THE TIMURID PERIOD
Though there had been some falling away during the Il-Khanid period from the splendid traditions ofmetalwork and ceramic achievement of the Saljiiq age, inboth fields the standards were still high and production on a large scale. By the end of the 8th/14th century, however, there was evidently a reduction both in production andin varietyof technique. Butit is not true that silver andgold inlay on metalwas then unknown. Superb monumental bronzes made by craftsmen from Isfahan and Tabriz for Tlmur himself are now in the Hermitage Museum. They were brought there, from the mosque of the city of Turkistan to which they were dedicated, in 1935 at the time of the Third International Congress of Iranian Artandpublished in the
Memoirs ofthe Congress by A.G. Yakubovsky.2 The most imposing,a
huge water tank forablutions (2.45 m.indiameter)3 dated 801/1399,is signed by 'Abd al-'Aziz b. Sharaf al-Dln TabrizI, while the equally fine candlesticks are signed by 'Izzal-Dln b. Tajal-Dln IsfahanI with the date 1397. The ablution vessel is decorated only with engraved inscriptions in thulth and kiifi and with arabesque ornament; while three ofthe five candlesticks retain agood deal ofthe original gold and silver inlay. A similar butsmaller uninscribed candlestick isin themuseum ofthe Georgian State in Tiflis, andanother example is divided between the

Hermitage and the Louvre.1 The restrained character of the decoration of this group which leaves considerable areas of metal plain has
been attributed to the HanafI milieu forwhich they were made;2 but in fact it seems characteristic of the taste of the period. Already in 1374—5 a bronze ablution basin decorated only with inscriptions and arabesques was dedicated at the Friday mosque at Herat (1.74 cm. in diameter). It was signed bythe maker Hasan b. 'All b. Hasan b. 'All IsfahanI made tothe order ofa qalandar in honour ofhis Kartid ruler,
and is said to have been a model for the Turkistan basin of1399.3 Gold and silver inlay is also found freely applied to a numerous group of wine tankards originally supplied with covers, which were a speciality of Khurasan in the Timurid period. The signed examples of1457, 1461 and 1466 appear all to have been made byKhurasanI craftsmen from Baharjan or Birjand, both within greater Khurasan. Onein the Hermitage is signed byJavan Bakht b. Husain, while another in the British Museum bears under the base a dedication to Sultan Husain
Baiqara, with the date 1497 (pi. 58a).4 Many ofthese vessels includein their decoration verses by Hafiz, and in one case by Qasim al-Anvar (d. 837/1433-4), a mystical poet, who also freely used the symbol of the wine-cup. How early this tankard shape goes back in the9th/15 th century is not at present clear, but it is probably significant that it is found reproduced in a jade cup inscribed with the name and titlesof
Ulugh Beg Kurgan,5 and therefore datable between 1417 and 1440. The tourde force by which this cup is supplied with a jade handle only underlines that it must have originated ina metal shape. Engraving alone was still used in elaborate all-over decoration in the later 9th/15 th century, asona dish with repousse and engraved geometric interlace ornament surrounded by Persian verses inpanels and
stylised butterflies. This is dated 1496-7.6 The precious metals were also frequently employed for the smaller vessels indomestic use, as we know from their representation in manuscripts, where they generally appear to be ofgold. It is more likely that silver gilt was used, as in a

of 1399; and they probably date from the same period or rather earlier.1 The same date is assigned toa heavy signet ring inthe Metropolitan
Museum with dragon-head terminals tothe hoop.2 This illustrates the taste in Chinese design which is so conspicuous at this period in many of the arts, and above allin ceramics. Chinese porcelain had for centuries enjoyed an unrivalled reputation in Iran, and had provided achallenge to the potters which they found hard to meet. In the late fifteenth century at Herat the painter Hajji Muhammad, whom we have noted as afavourite of 'All Shir Nava'I, succeeded after long experiments in producing vessels very similar to the Chinesein
body, but less pure in colour.3 Herat pottery of this period has not been identified, but there is little doubt that the reference here must be to blue
and white,4 since this appears as rival in esteem with the silver plate in the miniatures of the Timurid period. Naturally it is not possible to distinguish in them the Chinese imports from the local imitations. Much of the collection dedicated by Shah 'Abbas Ito the Ardabll shrine in 1607 is of late 8th/14th and 9th/15 th centuries, so that we have a good sample of the Chinese porcelain to be seen then in court circles. The copies or derivatives from them have nearly all come down to us in damaged state as fruits of excavation, and there are nomore than stylistic criteria available for dating them. Itcan be said, however, that the majority are of later 9th/15 th or ioth/i6th century date and that they are less close to
the Chinese prototypes than the copies made in Syria orTurkey.5 It is probably due to the chance of more excavation of Timurid sites in

Although this can date only from the third quarter ofthe 17th century, it may perhaps preserve an echo of a 15 th century product by this master, for itis executed in green and black, an unusual colour scheme for this period; and the design of floral scrolls in the cavetto could reproduce in underglaze painting an original design incised on a black ground. If it could be shown that Hajji Muhammad worked in this style, he could be associated with the dated "Kubachi" dishes of 1465 and 1495, which could then be assigned to Khurasan. 5 See now Grube, "Notes".

Mavara al-nahr than south of the Oxus that most of the blue and white so far published comes from sites now in Soviet Central Asia. In the Panjkent Museum is about half of a large dish which copies fairly closely
a Chinese porcelain of the early 9th/ijth century.1 Otherwise the relationship is less direct and the dating consequently less exact. There is a good collection inthe Hermitage Museum, mainly there attributed to the 9th/15 th century. Inone dish the Chinese motif of two fish head to
tail has been added to a Chinese cloud pattern;2 a pair of birds on another dish stand on little mounds instead of a branch, and are surrounded by a floral scroll. The most characteristic, however, show a symmetrical flower design as the centre of a formal pattern: inone case this is inthe
shape ofa star filled with the Chinese wave pattern:3 in others with a conventional floral design which resembles those found on the only other type of ceramics which can be attributed tothe 9th/15 th century. This has the design incised through a black slip ground under a turquoise on green glaze. This type also has been found inthe Samarqand area, but the best known examples, bearing dates equivalent to 1468 and 1480, have been associated with the hill-town of Kubachi in Daghistan in
the Caucasus area.4 Itis improbable that this can be maintained as their place oforigin; and the alternative ofTabriz was proposed by Arthur Lane, largely onthe basis of the signature of a potter called GhaibI
al-TaurlzI, who was working in Egypt in the 9th/15 th century.5 His name appears onblue and white pieces in Chinese taste, and his son signed a lamp decorated in exactly the same technique as was employed
on the "Kubachi" dishes.6 These symmetrical designs (in which calligraphy plays a significant part) are farremoved from any Chinese prototype: so that it can be argued that the blue and white "Kubachi" typeis earlier than the incised type with their secure dating in the second half of the 9th/15 th century. Itmust be assumed that blue and white pottery was made in anumber of different centres in the 15 th century as itwas also in the 16th. There is no evidence that polychrome wares in this style were
made before the Safavid period.7 Indeed, the only other type of ceramics

THE TIMURID PICTORIAL ARTS
to be attributed to the Timurid period are some residuary lustre wares of poor quality and, of course, the extremely important, varied and beautiful tiles, which must however be regarded as architectural decoration. The surviving examples of carved woodwork are also in a monumental, architectural style even when they are small objects like a Qur'an stand in
the Metropolitan Museum, dated 1360 and signed by an Isfahan! artist.1 From the same mosque of Khwaja Ahmad Yasavl in Turkistan city as the monumental bronzes already described, and contemporary with them, are two sets of doors dated 1394 and 1397,2 in amonumental style but with freer and richer floral decoration that wood permits. Amore elaborate technique with inlay in ebony, ivory and silver wire (now largely missing) was employed inthe carved wood doors ofthe Gur-i
Mir in Samarqand.3 The special character of this school of architectural wood carving is achieved by counterpoint between two layers of relief arabesque.

CHAPTER I 6
THE ARTS IN THE SAFAVID PERIOD
Shah Isma'Il was of Turkmen blood on his mother's side andhe deliberately made theAqQuyunlu capital of Tabriz his first capital: he took over the machinery of government centred in that city, andit seems that he also took over the artists of the book from the school established there by Uzun Hasan and his son Ya'qub (883-96/ 1479-90), which we have seen to have continued the Timurid tradition of Herat painting through the second half of the 9th/15 th century. A key manuscript to illustrate the transition to the early Safavid style is the Khamsa of Nizami copied for Ya'qub at Tabriz in 1481 (Topkapi Sarayi, Hazine 762),' to which a dozen miniatures were added later, apparently in 910/1504-5, according to a date on one of them; and evidently still at Tabriz (pi. 36), for they show theQizilbash projecting kuldh,the Haidari tdj adopted byHaidar, father of Isma'Il, asthe signof his adherents in the Safaviyya. These miniatures preserve the elegance and decorative quality of the royal Turkmen school with no interest in spatial organisation. There is another well-known manuscript whose miniatures also show an early type of Safavid kulah, one of them bearing thesame date 910/1504-5 (pi.59). This is a copy of the Dastdn i JamdluJaldl o£the.poet AsafI in theUppsala University Library. These miniatures show the same disregard for spatial organisation, but a much greater interest in landscape, rendered in a particularly rich
palette for theluxurious vegetation2. Forall that, these miniatures are very old-fashioned compared with thecontemporary school of Bihzad in Herat. These characteristics they share with a richly coloured miniature depicting the"Sleeping Rustam saved by his horse Rakhsh from a
marauding Lion"3 which has long been detached from an apparently unfinished manuscript of the Shdh-ndma. Here thelandscape settinghas become the main interest, though the animal drawing is sensitiveand sympathetic. If we are correct in attributing this miniature to the opening years of Isma'Il's reign in Tabriz, which had become his

capital in 907/1501, it can be seen what asplendid painting tradition he inherited. In 916/1510 he captured Herat from Muhammad Shaibani Khan, whom hekilled, and so became heir also tothe great Timurid school patronised by Sultan Husain Baiqara and adorned by the master Bihzad. It was the union ofthese two traditions which made possible the achievements of the Safavid school at Tabriz during the next thirty-five years. After 1510 we have no dated manuscript of importance from this scriptorium until theaccession of Shah Tahmasp in 930/1524. Although he was then only twelve years old, he showed an immediate interest in painting, forhehad already received lessons in
miniature painting from the leading master Sultan Muhammad1 and was ready to give his patronage to painters and illuminators. The latter part ofthe reign ofIsma'Il, after his defeat by the Ottoman Turks in 920/1514 at the battle of Chaldiran, was not a period when we would expect initiative orinnovation, yet it isto this period that is attributed the diploma appointing Bihzad as head ofthe court library staff in the year 928/1522.2 It seems that this date isnot to be relied upon, for the document has been preserved only as a specimen ofofficial style from the pen ofthe famous historian Khwand Amir (b. c. 880/1475, d.942/ 1535). He was a protege of 'All Shir Nava'I, the famous minister of Sultan Husain at Herat until his death in906/1501; and his first work
was completed in 905/1499—15 oo,3 from which period the farman appointing Bihzad might well beexpected to date, and not from the
Safavid period.4 Bihzad is remembered asof Herat, where hedied in 942/15 35-6 in the early part ofthe reign of Shah Tahmasp, for whom
he is said to have adorned a Khamsa of NizamI with miniatures.5 Moreover, there is sufficient evidence to show that aschool of painting continued inHerat inamore conservative style than inTabriz. It was probably not before 1528 that the remaining artists were carried off from there to the Shaibanid court at Bukhara, where they maintained the Bihzadian tradition well into the second half of the ioth/i6th century. From the period before that date there have survived manuscripts written by Herat scribes and with miniatures inthe Herat style,

such as aBiistdn ofSa'dl copied by 'All al-Husainl in 1519 atHerat and
now in the Museum of Turkish and Islamic Art in Istanbul (no.1019),1 while from a manuscript of the Khamsa of Amir Khusrau Dihlavl copied by the Herat scribe 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad in Balkh in 1504,
some detached miniatures now in the Metropolitan Museum2 and the
Louvre3 must be assigned to Herat about the year 1520. Soon after that date, in 1523, comes thefirst known illuminated manuscript of the Bukhara school, the Mihr u Mushtari of 'Assar in the Freer Gallery at
Washington.4 The transition from the first group ofminiatures to the four in the 'Assar is direct; butthe latter are superior in quality of design and in draughtsmanship. In both groups the simple landscapeis no more than a setting forthe figures, ofwhom even the minor ones reveal ahumanity or apathos unknown in the Safavid court style, with its interest in the rhythmical, the decorative and the gorgeous. The Herat tradition ofthe school ofBihzad isthe purer, and, solong as it preserved the interior feeling, the most perfect expression of the miniature art inIran, orindeed anywhere else. When it lost that integrity of vision, asit did later in Bukhara, it became only a mirror of the old style, lacking inwarmth, invention and personality. As has been said, Shah Isma'il himself spent the earlier part of his reign incampaigns, but, after his disastrous defeat by the Ottomansin 920/1514, he withdrew increasingly from the personal direction ofall affairs of state both civil and military. Ashas been pointed out in Chapter 5, the tradition ofcivil administration by the Persian bureaucracy was continued as ameasure of policy and, although the language of the court continued to be Turki, the tradition of Persian culture was fully maintained bythe Safavids. It seems that some part of the royal library was carried away asloot bythe Ottomans in 1514,for there are several outstanding examples of the Turkmen royal style in the libraries of Istanbul, forinstance in the Topkapi Sarayi Library a Khamsa of NizamI dated 886/1481 (Hazine 762) and another dated 881/1476 (Hazine 761), and an Amir Khusrau Dihlavl dated 883/1478 (Hazine 795); but it was probably only inthe latter part of the reign of Tahmasp that there wasan exodus of artists of the book to the

Ottoman court.1 On the contrary, under Shah Isma'Il it seems that the royal library staff was strengthened bythe adhesion of masters from Khurasan. Although there is no work which can be attributed securely to the greatest ofthese, Bihzad, during the quarter ofa century ofhis life asa subject of the Safavids before his death in 1535 at the ageof about eighty, his influence is clearly to beseen directly in Herat and indirectly at the Safavid court. The director ofthe early Safavid kitdbkhdnaseems on the other hand to have been Sultan Muhammad, anative ofTabriz and not a pupil of Bihzad or of MIrak. The best attested fact about him is that he instructed the future Shah Tahmasp in the artof painting, and was so
engaged when Bihzad first arrived in Tabriz from Herat,2 which was not likely to have been before 1523, since Tahmasp was born only in 1515. Sultan Muhammad must therefore have been in charge of the court library under Shah Isma'Il and during the first half of the reign of Tahmasp. There is good reason to think that the extraordinary achievement of the preparation of the Houghton (formerly Rothschild) Shdh-ndma with its two hundred and fifty six miniatures was carried out
under his direction.3 These miniatures richly illustrate thetransition from the Turkmen to the Safavid court style, as well as the impact on the Tabriz atelier ofthe arrival ofTimurid-trained artists bringing the style ofHerat toenrichit. That Sultan Muhammad himself was at work on this from an early period is strongly suggested by the miniature representing the "Court of Gayumars" (fol. 2ov), in correspondence with the account preserved by Dust Muhammad of this artist having painted in a royal Shdh-ndma "people clothed in leopard skins such that the hearts ofthe boldest of painters were grieved" by the marvellous skill shown by the miniatur
ist (pi. 37).4 This miniature is indeed a work of extraordinary finesse, and it is to be attributed to thevery early 1520s. Such an immense undertaking can hardly have taken less than ten years to accomplish: the only date in the manuscript is introduced into the architecture of the miniature on fol. 5 i6r, and is in figures "934 H.", equivalent to
1527-8. It seems fair to assume with Welch,5 that this folio isso far on

in the manuscript that the work on it must have been in progress for a number ofyears already. He proposed a date inthe early 1520s for its start and inthe mid 1530s for its conclusion. I would prefer to assume dates from about 15 20 to about 1530 for its production: for it seemsto me that, quite apart from the numerous miniatures which echothe Turkmen court style, the majority are more closely related to two wellknown manuscripts of the 1520s, the Paris Mir 'All Shir of15 26 and the Tehran Zafar-ndma of 15 29, rather than to the royal Khamsa ofNizamI of 1539-43 inthe British Library. A few do indeed recall the Hafiz of Sam Mirza ofabout 1530— 3,* but that would not invalidate the dates suggested for the temporal limits ofits production. Few ofthe miniatures appear nearly as advanced as those in the NizamI of1539—43, which nonetheless contains two miniatures attributed by "signatures" to Sultan Muhammad. One ofthese depicting Bahram Gur hunting is quite comparable with fol. 568 of the Shdh-ndma, which happens to treat also an exploit of Bahram (pi. 72). The rock masses are more clearly defined, but otherwise there is no great difference between these two hunting scenes inconception offigures inlandscape. Sultan Muhammad was joined by his son Mirza 'All in illustrating theroyal NizamI, and he is likely to have given up the directorship of the library staff to Mir Musavvir about 15 40. He too isrecorded tohave worked on a royal Shdh-ndma manuscript which may be that inthe Houghton collection. This would have allowed this latter artist a term of about ten years before hismigration to theMughal court soon after the arrival inKabul ofthe emperor Humayun in 956/1549. Typical ofa number ofthe earlier miniatures inthis manuscript are
folios 2iv, 22V and 23V,2 which could only be thework of artists trained at the court of the Aq Quyunlu, with their fecundity of vegetation, rather large figures inrelation tothe horses and with heads large in relation to the bodies. Trees, clouds and rocks are highly stylised, but both in colour andmovement a certain gaiety pervades these scenes. Gold is freely used for the skies. This style isfound only inthe first half ofthe manuscript. Herat influence appears unmistakably in a few pages, which show smaller figures, more important architecture and tinted rocks in theearlier Timurid tradition (pi. 38; fol. 89V). These two kinds ofminiature, both rich and exuberant, dominate the

manuscript; but there are some more forward-looking, with more open composition and fewer figures. There isan immense variety ofinvention and wealth of detail, sothat the cumulative effect is quite overwhelming. The frame round the text area isstrongly accented, evenin most cases where it is exceeded by extending the miniature, generally into one ofthe side margins. These extensions are usually themselves rectangular and thus serve to throw the weight of the composition onto that side ofthe page. Afew are extended rectangularly atthe top as well; and the importance tothe artist ofthe strong framing linesis demonstrated bytheir occasional use as architectural verticals in the compositions. Only seldom is the Timurid habit ofshowing the turret on a pavilion or a tree-top free against the blank paper of the upper margin still used, while a very few instances occur ofa free extension on more than one side (pi. 71), a practice that was to grow towards the middle of the century. Indeed, the weakness ofthis new style was its diffusion, loss of concentration on the subject and consequent failure of dramatic oremotional interest. Technically they were unequalled, and in colour harmony unmatched in the art ofthe world. The great achievement of this masterpiece of Persian manuscript production has been so enormously damaged byitswanton and disgraceful dismemberment that the overriding unity ofthe book, a sign of a mature and well-organised workshop, is greatly reduced bythe extraction of the miniatures and their separation from the text. The weight and density of these near whole-page miniatures were calculated asbalanced by the facing page oftext. Only three out ofall the miniatures occur as facing pages in asingle opening. By far the greater number of pages with miniatures allow of the inclusion of some text as well: and the layout provides many alternative methods of their combination, varying from complete separation through partial continuation of miniature between the text columns to the insertion of formal arabesque illumination in these areas; in each case with theaim of preserving the integrity of both picture and text to amaximum degree.
In two instances (fols. 385b and 638b)1 the ground of four text areas has been gilded to avoid compromising the stability of the architecture depicted. Similarly the unity oftext and paintings is matched byanoverall

THE ARTS IN THE SAFAVID PERIOD
unity of style and palette no doubt imposed by the director of the court atelier, Sultan Muhammad. The house style may be defined as diffused and decorative; spacious and outward looking; in contrast to the Timurid style ofHerat under Sultan Husain, dominated by the introvert sufl interest centred round the poet JamI and evident in the work of Bihzad and his school, with their tightly knit and cool harmonies and enclosed compositions. The miniature onfol. 516b1 is signed byMir Musavvir and illustrates the romance of Ardashlr and Gulnar, who are here seen together in bed in a brilliantly tiled pavilion at Ray. Itis ascene of complete rest, with sickle moon and knotted clouds in thenight sky. Passion is conveyed only bythe warm colouring of the bedchamber, while the rope by which Gulnar had scaled the wall hangs slackly and the handmaids sleep. The artist's signature isinthe tiled inscriptional frieze.
The other signed painting, by Dust Muhammad (fol. 512b),2 whose importance as a literary source isdiscussed below, illustrates the story of Haftad and theWorm. This is a diffused landscape, thecentral feature being atown set in avalley with much coming and going at the gate. Inthe lower left corner the story isenacted ofthe finding of the magic worm by a party of girls spinning outside the gate. This is one of the most advanced compositions inthe book and probably one ofthe latest, prefiguring the extended landscapes of the mid-century. Itis also notable because it was later copied by aMughal artist working for the
young prince Sallm, afterwards the Emperor Jahanglr, about 1600.3 More central in style to the Houghton manuscript and no doubt rather earlier, isthe scene on fol. 42b, where Farldun tests the courage
of his sons byconfronting them with a dragon.4 It is interesting to compare this miniature with a hunting scene in the 'AH Shir Nava'I manuscript of15 26. Here Bahram Gur is shown performing his feats of
skill before the two Greek slave-girl musicians.5 Cary Welch has attributed these miniatures to Sultan Muhammad himself, and no doubt both are of royal quality; the Bahram Gur composition is the more complex with its use ofechelon for the file of bowmen on one side of

the foreground and ofserving men on the other side, and ofheads of beaters appearing over the horizon behind; features also seen in the richly illustrated Zafar-nama of 1529. But theFarldun excels in its splendid involvement of the huge dragon's body in the rocky landscape contrasted with the open plain, where the horsemen move with greater sense ofspace than inthe tapestry-like Paris miniature. A second miniature in this Nava'I manuscript, thespirited battle
scene, "Iskandar routing the army of Dara",1 illustrates the re-useof
successful compositions and groupings.2 In this case a central group of a horseman fighting off the attack of two foot soldiers was derived ultimately from a Khamsa of Nizami datable 1490 in the British Library (Add. 25,900) and signed by Bihzad, and generally believed to behis work. This small but vigorous composition was re-used first in the Nizami of 152 5 in the Metropolitan Museum, forwhich three other groups ofcombatants were also taken, inaddition tothat inthe Paris Nava'I. That this work of 1525 was in fact thetransmitter of the Bihzadian composition is proved by the presence in the Nava'I miniature of a statuesque figure of a horseman holding an arrow on the right side, found in identical pose and position, though here bearded, in the Metropolitan page. This is asomewhat stiff work, unlike the Nava'I Battle scene which is as vigorous as the Bihzad miniature, but fully in the open manner ofthe early Tahmasp period. A new more structural treatment ofarchitecture was advanced in a painting signed by Sultan Muhammad in the Hafiz of Sam Mlrzaof
about 1534.3 In this miniature, as in the advanced paintings of the Houghton Shah-nama, large numbers of figures are introduced, each with acharacteristic gesture or stance, but all related to one another, as in this depiction ofthe "Feast of'Id" (pi. 60). No doubt it was on the basis of this signed work that Welch attributed to Sultan Muhammad the
"Zahhak told his fate" in the Houghton manuscript (fol. 29b).4 The "Feast" is a farsimpler composition, but the figures ofcourtiers and attendants show the same kind of chain relationship and the framing of the main action bya brilliantly decorated aivanwith roof pavilion, is equally effective inboth. No doubt, inspite of its early position inthe manuscript, this miniature must be one of the latest in date, about 15 30. Even more forward-looking is the "Barbad hiding in a tree" on fol.73 ib

with its extraordinary night sky with wind-blown cloud streaming into the left margin. This miniature has been attributed by Welch toMIrza
'All, the son of Sultan Muhammad,1 aclaim which can be supported by the two signed by this artist in the British Library NizamI of 1539-43, one of which even happens to depict Barbad, but here as court musician. This second royal manuscript, a Khamsa ofNizam! copied between
1539 a n d 1543 by Shah Mahmud Nlshapuri, has survived with thirteen
contemporary miniatures (British Library, Or.2,265).2 Two royal manuscripts are mentioned by the near contemporary Dust Muhammad as "so beautiful that the pen is inadequate to describe their merits": he adds that the two Sayyids, Aqa Mlrak and Mir Musavvir, painted the illustrations
to them.3 Evidently not all the miniatures can be by these two hands alone, but the NizamI opens with an illustration tothe fables of King Nushlrvan and his vizier and the owls on the ruined village, which bears a convincing signature ofMir Musavvir (pi. 61), introduced into the field of the painting, as they seldom are at this period. As in most of the illustrations to theKhamsa, thelandscape is themost striking part, notable here forthe touches of realism in the fallen tilework and the introduction of a stork's nest and snakes as well as the owls perched on the ruins. The gorgeous sunset sets afashion which continues through the rest of the century. The other miniatures of this book bear only librarians' attributions, but several of these are acceptable, including one to Aqa Mlrak of"Khusrau enthroned": and one to Sultan Muhammad of "Khusrau's first sight of Shlrin bathing". The latter is themost beautiful illustration of this famous andfavourite subject with the miniaturist that has come down to us; for in itlandscape and figures alike sustain thelyrical feeling of the romantic scene. In theformer the courtiers of Khusrau are depicted in the sumptuous dress of the court of Tahmasp, while the great throne arch has become a mere screen through which the garden background can be better shown. Mir Sayyid 'All, son of Mir Musavvir, is represented by a pastoral scene of a nomad encampment in which are set the three superior tents of Laila and her attendants, where she receives the feigned mad Majnun led inchains by a beggar woman. This green scene is themost advanced composition of the series, built on a double axis from the corners and combining realistic detail of herdsmen and embroiderers with the romantic theme of the

story illustrated, in a balanced tension. In India, where he went to found a school, the realism increased, but the romance quickly faded. There are two primary sources for the history of the arts of the book dating from the ioth/i6th century, both ofthem reliable when writing of events and persons within their own experience but less sowhen dealing with earlier periods. Nonetheless, they are thebest sources which have come down to usfor the traditional history of miniature painting as preserved in the Safavid studios of the art. Even where they cannot be accepted literally they throw light on the manner in which the profession and its patrons looked upon that tradition. Maulana Dust Muhammad was anative ofHerat, ahighly esteemed calligrapher and also skilled in music and painting according to the
authority of Sam MIrza.1 He was employed by Bahram MIrza (b. 923/1517, d. 956/1549), brother ofShah Tahmasp and anotable patron of the arts ofthe book. His account of"Past and Present Painters"is preserved as a preface to the muraqqa' bearing the name of Bahram MIrza
in the Topkapi library in Istanbul and is dated 1544.2 It is naturally biased towards Khurasan and Herat in particular, but for that reasonis authoritative on the history of Herat painting under Sultan Husain. On the early Safavid period he is also naturally well-informed. For he worked in the kitabkhana of Shah Tahmasp and instructed his sister Mihin-banu, called "Princess Sultanim", in calligraphy. However, in general Dust Muhammad writes as an heir to themain stream of Timurid tradition fixed in Herat from the time ofBalsunqur onwards. The second source, QazI Ahmad, who praises Dust Muhammad as a calligrapher but does not mention his preface as a source for his own account, produced the first version ofhis treatise on calligraphers and painters fifty years later, in 1596. He was born about 1550 into a family of Sayyids of Qum; spent his early life in Mashhad, where his father Sharaf al-Din Husain was Mir MunshI in the service of Ibrahim MIrza, son of the above Bahram MIrza and thus nephew and son-in-law of Shah Tahmasp and a man of learning and culture. The son therefore had

personal knowledge of the patronage of Ibrahim until his political murder in 15 77. The Mirza had been the principal patron of the arts of the book during the previous sixteen years following the fall of his cousin Sam Mirza in 1561. Apart from his personal experience in Mashhad during these years of his youth, QazI Ahmad stayed in the capital Qazvln as a minor official through the reigns of Isma'Il II (984-5/1576-7) and Muhammad Khudabanda (985-95/1578-87). In addition topersonal knowledge QazI Ahmad drew upon .two written sources, a verse epistle by the famous calligrapher Sultan 'All MashhadI, concerning the craft ofwriting and the rules ofteaching it
and possessed of little historical value,1 and the compilation bySam Mirza, son ofIsma'Il I. The treatise was first completed in 1015/1596 and was extensively revised and enlarged by 1606, when a second version was completed. It ispertinent tonote how frequently leading calligraphers (including royal ones like Ibrahim and Balsunqur, the sons of Shah Rukh, and Shah Tahmasp) are recorded ashaving designed monumental inscriptions on buildings, for execution in tilework or glazed brick. To exemplify how closely connected the decoration of manuscripts and buildings was felt to be, it is said that Ibrahim AstarabadI wrote adistich in nasta'llq "as an unvdn on the tiled gateway
of the mausoleum of Fatima at Qum".2 QazI Ahmad also constantly illustrates the mobility ofthe artists ofthe book, inresponse to offers of patronage, and their intimacy with ruling princes. Professor Minorsky, who produced a valuable edition ofQazI Ahmad's treatise, remarks in his introduction that the plan of this book was far from original, and that it closely resembled that of a Turkish account by the poet and historian Mustafa 'All, theMandqib-ihiinerverdn, composed about ten years earlier. Since this was clearly no more than a compilation, it presupposes the existence ofearlier sources, ofwhich the only
one mentioned by QazI Ahmad was written by Slml Nlshapurl,3 a calligrapher ofMashhad ofabout the middle ofthe 9th/15 th century, who wrote on the epistolary art and on the arts ingeneral. In addition to monographs, information about the history of the arts of the book is to be found in the pages of general historians; and Sir Thomas Arnold published extracts from two authors, Khwand Amir and Iskandar
Munshl.4 The latter carried hisaccount down to thedeath of Shah 'Abbas I, whereas theformer ends hisaccount with the fatal year

913/1507 when Muhammad Shaibani Khan captured Herat. Arnold also translated therelevant passage form Mirza Muhammad Haidar
Dughlat (b. 905/1499, d. 958/15 51).1 Apart from what can be deduced from these biographical accounts we know almost nothing about the organisation ofthe kitabkhana until the last part ofthe period treated here, for which the la^kirat al-muluk of about 1725 supplies some comparative statistics for the staff of all the royal workshops, including the library. At that time we learn that the salaried staff could undertake private commissions whenever there was not enough official work to
occupy all their time.2 This may well be apractice which grew up only in this period of decadence; but, on the other hand, it might have been true of earlier periods, and thus account for duplicates of compositions by thesame hand. For the later Safavid period there is also some evidence from Western travellers about the conditions ofpainters and other artists ofthe book and the way that their work was organised. Chardin gives some idea ofthe scale ofemployment in the thirty-two royal workshops, mentioning for instance that inhis time there were seventy-two painters on the strength ofthe establishment, all enjoying an annual salary, partly paid in free messing; as compared with one hundred and eighty tailors. He also describes the manner of recruitment to these establishments by scrutiny of specimens of the work submitted by candidates first tothe head ofeach specialist workshop,
and then for confirmation by the na%ir in charge.3 Appointments were normally made for life, and the children ofthose on the royal employ had the chance of being accepted into the establishment at twelve to fifteen years of age. This general set-up probably dates from the administrative reforms of Shah 'Abbas I and is probably more systematic than previously, but essentially throughout the Safavid period most artists of the book must have been supported out of the personal revenues of the shah orofone ofthe princes.
However, inChardin's time there evidently was some private enterprise in manuscript production; for he mentions the rates chargedby copyists of manuscripts, ofwhich the highest was of four 'abbasis for a
thousand couplets.4 There was also a good market for second-hand books inwhich high prices were paid for fine calligraphy, illumination and miniatures. Elsewhere, he writes of the supreme quality of the

masters, made of gum sandarac, a tree resin, and linseed oil.1 He does not omit to mention the use of lapis lazuli, and pays tribute to the virtuosity of the line and the excellence of the arabesque work. A third source forthe history ofminiature painting in the Safavid period is now available in the writings of one of the leading masters of the later ioth/i6th century who was also a poet and composed in Persian verse a treatise on painting techniques, Sadiql Beg (b.940/
1533-4, d. 1018/1609-1o).2 He belonged to one of the Turkish tribal groups which had made possible the Safavid rise to power andhis native language was Chaghatai; inthat language he wrote a biographical account ofleading poets, painters and connoisseurs ofthe Safavid period. Although byfamily tradition a soldier, hewas fired with the ambition to practise theart of Bihzad and persuaded Muzaffar 'All (d.1576), his nephew and pupil, to teach him atQazvin in 1568, where he was moving in court circles. He was afterwards in the employof Isma'Il II during his brief reign (984-5/1576-7), but athis death withdrew toHamadan and later toLahljan inGllan and toYazd. He had, however, so much impressed the young Shah 'Abbas when in Herat that on hisaccession in 995/1587 Sadiql was made head of the library (kitdbddr) to theshah, a post he held for thenext ten years.His position and his travels gave Sadiql a close knowledge ofthe leading personalities in thecultural world of Iran in thelast third of the sixteenth century. His writings do not of course give us biographies of the leading artists of the book, but they do give vivid sketches of their personalities, reputations and accomplishments; and they are outspoken and anecodotic. His work therefore does not have the historical importance of Dust Muhammad orQazI Ahmad. One of the crucial artistic documents for the understanding of Safavid book-painting in the mid-sixteenth century is the manuscript
of the Haft aurang ofJamI in the Freer Gallery, Washington.3 The 303 folios took nine years to complete between 963/15 56 and 972/1565, and according to the colophons were divided between three centres, Mashhad, Qazvin and Herat. It is a princely manuscript prepared for

Ibrahim Mlrza, son of Bahram Mlrza, a favourite nephew of Shah Tahmasp, who appointed him governor of Mashhad in 963/15 56, when he was thirteen years old, and gave him his daughter Gauhar Sultanin marriage. Ibrahim took with himto Mashhad Maulana Malik, a
renowned master of calligraphy, to be the first head of his kitabkhana;1 but he was recalled by the shah to Qazvln in 966/1559. He had meanwhile copied the first two parts of the Freer Haft aurang, while the rest was shared among four other leading calligraphers. That the miniatures are contemporary with the text is shown bythe dedications to Ibrahim to be seen onthree of these (fols. 38b, 132a and 162a), all of which occur in sections copied at Mashhad. We know from the account of QazI Ahmad that the leading painters working in the princely governor's service at this time were Shaikh Muhammad, 'All
Asghar and 'Abd-Allah.2 The lastnamed is recorded as a master of ornamental gilding andillumination. Forthis reason his title was mu^ahhib (ornamentalist or gilder), with which speciality he is also mentioned byIskandar MunshI. The Freer manuscript is one of the first of which we can confidently say that the gold-decorated margins
must becontemporary with the book.3 Indeed, this practice of floral embellishment may probably have started only about this date, justat the time of the foundation of the Mughal school, in which also it became a special fashion. It istobe noticed that the marginal decoration ofthe royal NizamI of 1539-43 was supplied atadate subsequent to thecompletion of the miniatures, which have been cutoutand remounted. 'All Asghar, a native of Kashan, was QazI Ahmad's own instructor in miniature painting and, according to Iskandar MunshI, specialised or excelled in landscape (streets and trees). Shaikh Muhammad was a calligrapher as well as a painter. He issaid tohave followed (or, perhaps, imitated) the Chinese; but that may probably be intended merely asa compliment tohis skill rather than as an indication of any actual interest in Chinese painting. Indeed, on the contrary, Iskandar MunshI mentions that he introduced the fashion ofimitating European painting. In any case he seems to have been especially a figure painter. There is in fact noidentifiable European influence in Persian painting before the nth/17th century. Since we may take the

miniatures inthe Freer Haft aurang as certain evidence for the work of this group of artists in Mlrza Ibrahim's library, itis right to scrutiniseit for evidence ofstyle. Stchoukine divided the twenty-eight miniatures into two groups, a first of sixteen which he regards asold-fashioned, not much different from the illustrations of the royal NizamI of 1539—43; the other of twelve representing a further development, more dynamic and with some bold experiments in composition and striking realism in some of the figures (nos. 8,11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27). Nos. 23 and 24 belong to the Laildu Majniin, copied at Herat in 972/1565; no. 19 to the SalmanuAbsdl, copied in 968/1561; while the Yiisuf u Zulaikha (nos. 7—12) was copied at Mashhad in 964/1557. For comparison with the later group we have the eight miniatures ofthe Garshdsp-ndma (British
Library, Or. 12,985) dated 981/1573 from Qazvln,1 three of them signed by the painters Muzaffar 'All, Sadiql Beg and Zain al-'Abidln, masters of the royal library ofShah Tahmasp and later ofShah 'Abbas. These are, however, much more crisp in drawing and more coherent in organisation. If we can follow the distinction into two groups proposed by Stchoukine, the latter are more simplified with greater attention to figure painting (pi. 62), acharacteristic which istobe taken up by MuhammadI in his incomparably delicate drawing of 1578. Com

of MuhammadI and the ploughing oxen.3 The earlier group continue the rich counterplay of numerous figures in a spacious setting which had been characteristic of the NizamI of 1539—43, with some clear indebtedness toit indetail. The later group isalso not far removed in
style from the miniatures ofa dispersed manuscript ofthe Sbdb-ndma,4 which bears contemporary attributions to Naqdl, Siyavush, Sadiql and Zain al-'Abidln, who are all known as court painters. All except Naqdl
are mentioned byQazI Ahmad5 asmen of an earlier generation than his; while Iskandar MunshI records Zain al-'Abidln, Naqdl and Sadiql

Beg as working in thelibrary of Isma'U II. Siyavush indeed was a household servant ofShah Tahmasp, aGeorgian royal ghuldm and, like Sadiql, a pupil ofMuzaffar 'All, whom we have seen tohave been still in Qazvln in 1573, and therefore senior to the group. Since this group of artists was probably only first brought together byIsma'U II,the illustration of this Shdh-ndma is plausibly attributed to his reign (984-5/1576-7). The range of colouring in these miniatures is stronger and brighter than those in the Haft aurang, suggesting that atQazvln a more academic, less sensitive style was appreciated. The position of MuhammadI in this situation remains somewhat enigmatic: hewas a man of Herat and probably trained in the court style ofShah Tahmasp, but, to judge from his generally accepted auvre, nearer in sensibility and inpreference for simple country scenes tothe work ofthe Mash
had group of painters working forSultan Ibrahim.1 No doubt these too were recruited into the royal library after the death oftheir patron in 1577. It is therefore to besupposed that there were two or three different schools working together inQazvln inthe last quarter of the 16th century. The Garsbdsp-ndma and the dispersed Shdh-ndtna represent the more brilliant and assured style of the group of painters round Siyavush, Sadiql and Zain al-'Abidln; while MuhammadI may have been the leader ofthe quieter, more sensitive artists, whose work is to be seen ina number of country scenes and drawings of dervishes, and also inthree detached miniatures from a manuscript ofthe Gulistan of Sa'dl in the Mahboubian collection and in a manuscript of the Sifat
al-'dshiqin ofHilall dated 1582 inthe Edwin Binney collection.2 These sensitive miniatures represent the end ofthe early Safavid court style; in which landscape and figures are united in harmonious compositions, which admirably express the Persian love of natural and human beauty, and the sufl tendency to see the two asequally reflecting the divine immanence. Apart from manuscripts, there is fortunately one surviving monument to illustrate the art of wall-painting in the mid-ioth/i6th century, a Safavid palace pavilion at Na'In, which has recently been discovered and published by DrIngeborg Luschey-Schmeisser. A considerable part of the decoration of the upper part of the walls and the vaulting of this building has survived, and the quality is such that one can only feel

a strong regret that so much good work of the early Safavid period must have been done on walls of which no trace remains. Shah Tahmasp himself is recorded tohave painted one or two scenes onthe
walls of the Chihil Sutiin pavilion at Qazvln;1 while the leading court painters Mir Musavvir and Aqa MIrak decorated for Bahram MIrza an arched mirror-house (jdmkhana) "making it as beautiful as para
dise peopled with fair youths and hurls".2 This description fits remarkably the decoration ofthe domed chamber in the Na'in palace; but this must bea building of a generation later. It is dated about 155 0—60 by Luschey, who distinguishes two different hands inthe work inthe two rooms. On the evidence ofthe costume ofthe figures represented, and also onstylistic grounds, these paintings must be put well before 15 8o, and it is at present not possible to give a more definite date than that suggested by Luschey. The technique is to be noted by which these designs were carried out in relief stucco work known as kundal? modelled and then cut to shape. Technically, therefore, these Safavid wall-paintings resemble the contemporary manner of decorating the inner surfaces of bindings with designs in applique, while the outer covers often show similar subjects in relief formed by pressing the leather into moulds. Fortheaivan arch of the pavilion is decorated with arcaded niches whose apexes form part of the interlace vaulting. Within this in star-shaped panels are depicted phoenix, ch'i-lin, wild geese in flight and parts whose wings fit into the star shapes. On the walls are designs ofanimals, birds and vegetation inpanels. No human figures are included in the decoration of this part of the building; but the inner domed chamber is decorated with symmetrical designs of pairs of young men drinking from a single cup, and of winged parls, separated by floral designs — sprays growing from vases. This complex, as Luschey has pointed out, resembles some ofthe fine Safavid painted lacquer book-bindings inshowing the sky filled with birds inflightand small stylised clouds above scenes offeasting and hunting. Thus it can be seen how closely connected this decorative wall-painting is to the contemporary arts of the book, which are primary in this period. The small scale of the designs bears this out and as final proof it can be mentioned that the Na'in pavilion includes in itsdecoration versesby

Hafiz in nasta'llq script in panels against a floral ground. There are two well-known drawings now in the Freer Gallery, Washington, representing abattue in mountain country and Solomon carried through the
air by jinn andattended by parl,1 which include all the principal elements inthese wall-paintings, and ofmid-16th century date, which might even bedesigns for similar architectural decoration. In quality there is no great difference, butthe wall-paintings show faces more sharply characterised, no doubt in order to compensate for the distance from the eye of the spectator. Although the last two decades ofthe 16th century saw a declinein the production offine illustrated manuscripts, there were still some of excellent quality whose miniatures mark the transition from the late Qazvln style to that of the new capital, Isfahan, which thereafter became the principal seat ofthe book arts. Among these, two lavishly illustrated manuscripts of the Shdh-ndma can be taken toexemplify the character of the period. One of these is at present known only by a
fragment in the Chester Beatty Library,2 with twelve large-scale miniatures and an illuminated frontispiece, which bears the signature of Zain al-'Abidin, thus marking it as acourt product. Ithas been attributed to the last decade ofthe century, but should perhaps be assigned to the 15 80s. The figures remain sharply focused and the detail ofthe architecture and landscape is fine and precise, but touches ofrealism failto compensate forthe loss of structural sense or of feeling. The second manuscript in theMahboubian collection (University of Texasno. 922), also unfortunately undated, isprobably slightly later. Among the twenty-three miniatures, the double frontispiece and three ofthe miniatures show the beginning of a new style, while the remainder are in a simplified Qazvln style in which figures decisively dominate the landscape. This is true also ofthe new style, but here the figures are on a larger scale and can thus carry a more personal expression. This is emphasised bythe introduction of several bare-headed men, hitherto practically unknown in this art. Gestures are expressive rather than realistic, while the setting isnow entirely conventional. Recently another illustrated manuscript, this time fortunately dated

to 1593, has come tolight, the Anvdr-i Suhailiin the collection ofthe
Marquess ofBute.1 This bears a note beside the colophon that it was prepared for"Sadiql Beg, the rarity ofthe age, the second Manl, the Bihzad of the time". Robinson, who has published this manuscript, believes that this means that all 107 miniatures which illustrate it were painted bySadiql forhis own satisfaction. I find this hard to accept, partly because they do not all appear to be by a single hand, but also because such a dedication would be more likely to represent a tribute from the artist's pupils to their master. In his recent study of the life and work of the artist Sadiql, Welch has proposed that he was given by Shah 'Abbas the appointment as head of the library (kitabdar) immediately on his accession in 1587 and not as hitherto assumed in 1596, so that such atribute might have been timely. In any case the illumination of this manuscript underlines the academic brilliance of the work in the last decade of the 16th century atthe capital, Qazvln. At the same time the miniatures, though unequal in quality, illustrate all the tendencies to be seen in the school at this time; the archaism of direct copies of the late Timurid style ofHerat, the realism which is somehow connected with the contemporary Mughal style at the court of Akbar and the new style coming about at the court ofShah 'Abbas, highly mannered and with strong colouring. Other features of these miniatures include streaming, coloured clouds, strongly shaded trees and wind-blown foliage. Most of the miniatures project into the side margin of the page, as do also the miniatures inthe Chester Beatty Shdb-ndma. Occasionally also, even in the last years of the century, thereare some manuscript illustrations ofsensibility and invention, such asthe four miniatures added atthis time to the 1483 Mantiqal-tair now inthe
Metropolitan Museum,2 before it was dedicated by Shah 'Abbas I in 1607 to the shrine of Shaikh SafT at Ardabll. At the time of this addition the manuscript was also provided with an illuminated 'unvan signed byZain al-'Abidln, aswas the Shdh-ndma fragment mentioned above. There is, moreover, another connection between thesetwo groups ofminiatures. The most remarkable ofthe later series of illustrations to the Mantiq al-tair depicts the"Conference of the birds",

watched by a hunter carrying a matchlock in a rocky hillside. This bears the signature of Hablb-Allah, a painter recorded to have been recruited from Qurn tothe court workshop in Isfahan between 15 96 and 1606; and it includes asitsmost conspicuous element a peacock displaying, seen frontally. This bird isexactly repeated as a decorative feature in the centre ofthe aivan in the best of the Shdh-ndma minia
tures.1 The other miniatures added to the Mantiq al-tairare less original in composition, but incertain, as in the "Execution of a sick man bya GhazI", there are vivid touches of movement within traditional settings. Yet even the architecture is abreast of the times with the coffered false vaulting (muqarnas) of an aivan like that of the 'All Qapu
reception hall. Hablb-Allah was an accomplished figure draughtsman2 and quite capable of the swooning Christian girl in the story of the Shaikh of San'an. Heshows afinde stick elegance, unlike the more relaxed stance of the 17th century. Behind the garden pavilion is the last ofthe 16th century garden vistas, with apensive gardener leaning on his long-handled spade. There seems no reason why all four miniatures might not be by Hablb-Allah. The most significant development during the last quarter of the 16th century is the rise to favour of the independent figure subject. Although a number of separate figure subjects have been attributed to the time of Sultan Husain in Herat, and some even to the hand of Bihzad himself, there is little that can be accepted asbefore 1500. The well
known portrait of Mir 'All Shir Nava'I,3 must beposthumous, for it bears the probably genuine signature ofMahmud muqahhib, a Bukhara painter ofthe 1530s and 40s, whereas the Mir died in906/1501. Inthe time of Shah Tahmasp Mir Musavvir, Muhammad Qadlml, Kamal al-Tabriz! and 'Abd al-'Aziz of Kashan are all recorded as "portraitists", though little survives of their work. The best are the figure subjects by Mir Musavvir ofyoung princes and pages inthe British Museum (pi.
63a)4 and the Museum ofFine Arts, Boston.5 His son Mir Sayyid 'All also made some drawings ofsimilar fashionable youths before leaving for India with Humayun. The dates of these drawings must be between 1535 and 1540. Muzaffar 'All also is said tohave been an incomparable figure painter and to have decorated the walls of the Chihil Sutun at

Qazvln.1 He is now known only by his manuscript illustrations already mentioned. His pupil, Sadiql Beg, the first specialist in figure drawing, who "painted thousands of marvellous portraits," became in 1569 kitabdar to the shah. He was of the Afshar tribe, one of the leading Turkmen tribes, and agood warrior, but overbearing and rude, so that
he finally lost his position, though not his title and salary.2 Attributed to him are several attractive but rather mannered coloured figure drawings
in the Bibliotheque Nationale (Supp. pers. 1171)3 and elsewhere, of young beauties of both sexes. Several areincluded in theso-called "album ofthe amir ofBukhara" inthe Pierpont Morgan Library (M.
386):4 amongst them sketches of young men wearing loosely wound coloured turbans of the period about 1590 (pi. 63Z?), andin more sophisticated poses than became fashionable inthe 17th century. The beginning of the reign of Shah 'Abbas I thus heralds the period of the primacy of the independent miniature or drawing over the manuscript illustration. In the first part of the reign it is true that some notable manuscripts were still being produced, such as the Duval Rani-yi Khi^r Khan ofAmir Khusrau Dihlavl of 1596 (British Library
Add 7,776),5 where the flat silhouetted figures continue the tradition of elegance introduced byMuhammadl. This may well bea provincial manuscript, since one of the two scribes was aman from Lahljan, chief town of Gllan; and it has aslightly Turkish look, probably appropriate to the disputed areas ofnorth-western Iran atthis time. Later on, after the move ofthe capital to Isfahan and the establishment ofthe shah as a great national leader, his personal taste becomes apparent in the miniature style of the second half of the reign; as for instance in a poetical manuscript dated 1613 in the Walters Gallery,
Baltimore6 and a Khamsa of NizamI of 1605-26 in the Bibliotheque
Nationale (Supp. pers. 1980).7 The figures are still of considerable elegance, but their attitudes are more natural, less stylised, and could well have been taken from life; landscape and architectural setting, on the contrary, are simplified and conventional; even the famous Blsitun

rock-carving, for instance, in the Khusrau uShirin,1 shown as a wallpainting of the lovers in a landscape found in a niche; and the clouds in the Baltimore manuscript drawn in the margins in pale blue and gold, as in the backgrounds of some of the figure drawings. The same indifference to landscape and architectural form is shown in a remarkable manuscript of the Shdh-ndma dated 1023/1614, which illustrates another aspect of the shah's taste, apastiche of the great Balsunqur manuscript of 1430, which must have remained inthe royal library. This copy contains thirty-nine miniatures, the composition of more than half of
which are borrowed from the 1430 book, with simplifications.2 The colouring and superficial resemblance are skilfully achieved, and the elements of the landscape are the same; but some figures in contemporary dress are introduced, as in the "Blzhan drawn from the well by Rustam" (pi. 64). Here the prisoner wears the Mongol yoke (palahang), but his costume is of the early 17th century, and so is the water jug beside him. The background isa phantasmagoria of rocks, formed from the Timurid coral convention, but filling nearly all the sky. Rustam is aconventional Herat figure and the foreground is studded with early Timurid plants. In some of the miniatures there is no intrusive element and the landscape is a passable imitation, as in the "Rustam lassoing the Khaqan of Chin". In others again, part of the composition is borrowed and part supplied by fresh invention, remarkably in keeping. The figure of Prince Balsunqur himself, on horseback, with his attendants, is adapted to apolo scene, from the double-page hunting scene which formed the frontispiece of the 1430 book. The ground is covered with an all-over floral arabesque pattern instead of vegetation, a convention which had developed in Shlraz in the later ioth/i6th century. Shah 'Abbas was determined to rival the Timurid princely patrons; and he had equal resources in materials and library staff. But the spirit of the age was no longer in tune with the romanceepic. Iran did not produce aschool of history painting like India, nor of portraiture like that of the Mughals. Instead, the painters rivalled one another in virtuosity of penmanship and richness of design. For the first time in the history of the art, amajority of the drawings are signed, though not of course always inthe autograph of the artist. Repetitions abound, often probably contemporary work by pupils or

assistants. The question now is not so much when orwhere a drawing was made, as whether it isan orginal, and, if so, by whose hand. This debate continues and has proceeded farthest towards the identification of the work ofAqa Riza. We know from the literary sources1 that Aqa Riza was a son of'All Asghar and therefore, like Sadiql Beg, of Turkmen stock, but unlike him born into the profession and almost certainly apprenticed in the royal library at an early age. He had anestablished reputation bythe time that QazI Ahmad completed his first version in 1596, and his birth is reasonably placed by Stchoukine about 1565, when his father was among the leading artists inthe atelier ofIbrahim Mlrza at Mashhad. Aqa ispart of his name by which he isreferred to inthe sources. QazI Ahmad writes: "in the flower ofthe youth he brought the elegance of his brushwork, figure painting and likeness to such a degree that if ManI and Bihzad were living today they would praise his hand and brush a hundred times a day". The work ofthis early period which is generally accepted is not extensive. Atits head are two fine coloured drawings ofstanding figures, one ofa girl holding a fan (pi. 65a), the
other of an elegant page ina cloak holding a fruit.2 Both bear "signatures" of Aqa Riza and both also the royal seal of Shah 'Abbas with the date of his accession incorporated in the legend. The style is more elegant than that of Sadiql Beg, with less sense of volume (there are no highlights on the features, as in his) but greater vitality: and we may remark a certain humour in the expressions. Then there are some pen
drawings, also ofyoung people, a girl standing and holding a rosary3
and a seated youth with a flowering spray inhis hand,4 which excel in the bravura ofthe line which moves from thick tothin, following the curves of the body and ends in a splutter of controlled ink. The first of these also bears the shah's seal, while the second comes from an album put together before the end of the 16th century, but shows a cloud formation inthe background like that ofthe early 17th-century manuscript illustrations. Also belonging tothe period about the turn ofthe century isanother drawing in the Louvre of a young cup-bearer wearing thevoluminous turban of the early 'Abbas I period but more
voluptuous in his stance than anything hitherto.5 All these bear "signa

tures" of Aqa Riza, though not all in the same hands; and evidently attributions, inspite of the humble formulae conventionally employed. We now approach the problem of Riza-yi 'AbbasI, whose name is not mentioned in any of the sources, but is found, generally with adate added, on a great many 17th-century figure drawings. Some of the earliest ofthese according tothe inscriptions, are stylistically close to the Aqa Riza drawings last mentioned, especially the two earliest dated 1603 and 1610. There is, moreover, supporting evidence to be found in inscriptions on three other drawings, not by Riza himself. Twoare different versions of a portrait of a painter by the most productive artist of the second half of the century, Mu'in. Both are inscribed by the artist and both give the name of the subject as Riza-yi 'AbbasI, the
earlier dated 1673, &v'mS t n e further name of Ash'ar (probably intended for Asghar), thefamily name of Aqa Riza. In both, Riza is described asMu'In's master, and both portraits are said to be copied after anoriginal of 1044/1635, which, the 1673 inscription adds, was the year ofhis death, only one month later. The second copy, made in 1676, lacks this important additional information. The third drawing purports to be acopy made by Riza-yi 'AbbasI in 1618 after an illustration to the Gulistan of Sa'dl, which he believed to beby Bihzad. A second inscription by Riza's son, ShafT 'AbbasI and dated 1064/1653, refers to him as Aqa Riza. If we accept thegenuineness of these inscriptions, we have double proof that Aqa Riza and Riza-yi 'AbbasI were the same man. How then do we account for the change of name? If we turn to the second edition of QazI Ahmad's treatise of1606—8,
we find an additional paragraph1 inwhich his character issaid tohave completely changed by his consorting with libertines and taking up the vulgar sport of wrestling. He was, however, still inthe shah's employ.
Ten years later in 1616 Iskandar MunshI writes2 that he was then always poor and in need and gave little time to his art, which surely implies that hewas no longer in court service. His fall from grace is here attributed to the influence of Sadiql Beg, whom we have seen to have had an unusually disagreeable character. Might it not be that Riza took to using the epithet '"AbbasI" only when heceased to be the shah's servant, butwhen hewished to enhance his market valueby reference to the royal patronage he hadenjoyed? If his dismissal occurred about 1610, there is only one earlier dated example of the

signature to account for that of1603.JI would suggest that this inscription may have been added subsequently, although the date may well be correct for the making of the drawing. Ifthis interpretation iscorrect, the Riza-yi 'AbbasI drawings are those made for sale in the market. This is not, however, to imply that there need have been any marked change of style at this moment, forit must beremembered thatthe taste of the shah was likely tobe "popular": he was a good mixer and enjoyed the company of shopkeepers and such people, as we learn from
the graphic pages of Pietro della Valle,2 who visited Isfahan in 1617. Some index of his taste isprovided by the decoration ofthe 'All Qapu pavilion. Alongside of the niches intended forChinese porcelain,for
which he had a real passion,3 are tobe seen the remains ofa system of arabesque decoration with birds in flight in the public rooms and of figures in the smaller rooms on amuch smaller scale. That these are of the time of Shah 'Abbas I we know once more from the pages of Pietro
della Valle,4 who considered them lascivious. They are in fact similar in style, though coarser in execution, than those of Riza-yi 'AbbasI but are, from the point of view of the 20th century, gently sentimental rather than provocative. Embracing lovers are one of the themes of Riza's work after 1610, but he was equally fond ofdepicting old men, especially dervishes, andof what we might call "costume pieces", young women and men wearing theelaborate modish dress of the period, including some young pages in European hats and breeches. The Persian male dress had always included trousers and by the time of Shah 'Abbas I,as Anthony Sherley noted, breeches were anormal male dress and even worn by the shah himself. As plumes were frequently worn in turbans without any indication of rank, andas the shah favoured rich costume, such dressing up was normal and not to be attributed, as it sometimes has been, to any special Portuguese influence. A mannerism, apparently introduced by Riza, was to inclinethe

3 Mario Ferrante argues, however, that these niches are decorative only, being formed as a plaster screen to mask the windows: "Desseins et observations preliminaires pour la restauration du palais de Ali Qapu", in Zander, Travaux, p. 168,fig.73. Infact these niches closely resemble those in the Chlnlkhana at the shrine of Shaikh SafI at Ardabll, which we know to have been prepared to receive the gift from 'Abbas I of his large collection of Chinese porcelain in 1611 :see Pope, Chinese Porcelains, pp. 8—11, pi. 4.

standing figures forwards as ifthey were suddenly arrested in a forward movement. This trait is most obvious in the more complex manuscript illustrations byhim such asa double-page country picnic ofa young
lord, dated 1612, in theHermitage,1 particularly rich with gold sky and gold margin decoration into which theminiatures extend. It isalso to be seen in some ofthe miniatures inan undated manuscript ofthe Qisas al-anbiyd("History of the Prophets") in theBibliotheque Nationale
(Supp. pers. 1313) of about 1600, which arealso by Riza.2 This mannerism continued through the middle of the century andis but one sign of the strength of Riza's influence on his followers, led by his pupil Mu'in and hissonShaf f. His personality dominates the first half ofthe century, no doubt partly because itcorresponds so clearly to thespirit of the age, democratic, confident, delighting in display and bright coloursbut conservative inits respect for age and its salute tobeauty. Shah 'Abbas I died before Aqa Riza, whose death cannot be placed prior to 163 5, inthe reign of SafI I (1038-5 2/1629-42), atroubled time, from which little book artsurvives, though both his son Shafi' and Mu'in must have been active. By the former is a coloured bird and
flower drawing in the Hermitage dated 163 4— 53 and two pen-drawings in analbum of designs dated 1640 and 1641and signed Muhammad Shafi' IsfahanI and Shafi' 'AbbasI, the name which he received as a
court artist.4 Both are flower drawings and both seem toderive from European originals. The Hermitage drawing of a parakeet on the blossoming cherry bough, also shows Western influence in the shading. Western influence is entirely absent from his father's work, but from now on it is frequently seen for the rest of the Safavid period. Shafi' probably designed for the textile business; the silk brocades having as favourite repeat motives flowering plants andbirds, such as Shafi' designed. There was an active foreign trade interest in these things: asis demonstrated bycopies made byShafi' from two English pattern books etched about 1661 in London, by John Dunstall (d. 1693), as well as bythe instructions from Charles I to Nicholas
Wilford inhis mission to Persia in 1637.5 This was evidently a period

of mutual influence between East and West, when oriental products textiles, lacquer, ceramics — appealed to European taste, without much regard for country oforigin, solong asit was east of Suez; whilein India and Persia, and afew decades later in China, there was a reciprocal interest in Western painting with its perspective and chiaroscuro. The work of Shafl' 'AbbasI of this kind extends down to 1674,which is said to have been the year of his death. At the same time he was making copies after his father's works, to some of which he probably added his father's signature. He was evidently highly skilled but without great originality. A striking contrast to him was Mu'In Musavvir, immensely prolific, dynamic and extremely personal inthe virtuosity ofhis line. In manuscripts heexcels in the vigour and originality of composition, rather than in colouring, where heshowed a liking forgarish contrasts,of strong primary colours. It is inhis more personal, rapid sketches that he shows his genius for characterisation. Themanuscripts mainly
belong tothe earlier part of his career under Shah 'Abbas II;1 the style of the sketches owes nothing tothe West, but is the interpretation in calligraphic line of a particularly keen observation from life. Sometimes this is combined with a traditional phantasy, as in the "Man
attacked by Dragons", dated 1676, in the British Museum:2 or under
Indian influence as inthe "Milking of a Cow" inthe Berlin Museum,3 of 1681. Only in the coloured drawings does the influence of his master Aqa Riza continue until the end of his career (1689and 1694), when he had been active for over fifty years. He kept alive the tradition of vital brushwork with a tendency to abstract calligraphic line long after it had been abandoned by most ofthe leading artists ofthe last third of the century. The reign of Shah 'Abbas II (io52-77/i642-66)was favourable to the arts and new hands brought a revival, led byMuhammad Yusuf, Muhammad Qasim and Afzal al-Husainl. The lastnamed signed sixtytwo of the miniatures in aShah-nama manuscript in the Leningrad State
Library (no. 3 3 3).4 Many of these bear dates between 1642 and 1645, while others, unsigned, excel in their dramatic effects, the figures being

arranged as if on a stage-set with elaborate backcloth.1 The same dramatic effect is sought by similar means in some miniatures in a
second Shdh-ndma dated 1648 in the Royal Library, Windsor Castle,2 and almost certainly by the same hand. Afzal al-Husaini is a very
competent follower of Aqa Riza, whereas Muhammad Yusuf 3 emerges more clearly as adistinct personality, of a more baroque tendency. The landscape backgrounds seem to be tormented, as if a great storm has lately passed over them, tearing the leaves from the trees and leaving the clouds in tatters (pi. 65^). His figures seem to carry further the inclination forwards found inAqa Riza's later work and to be poised for fresh movement. Muhammad Qasim, on the other hand, was more interested indecorative effects; his figures are static and his landscapes
mere staffage, but over all attractive.4 It seems likely that he may have been responsible forsome of the best decorative and colourful wallpaintings which formed part of the improvements carried out at the Chihil Sutun palace at Isfahan by Shah 'Abbas II, according to an
inscription of 1647 discovered by Professor Hunarfar.5 The most attractive of these are in one of the smaller rooms adjoining the central hall, named by the Italian restoration team who have recently cleaned and consolidated them with great skill, "P4". They fill ogival and lunette niches and show groups ofpicnickers inthe country or single figures. The style and subject are very like those ofthe contemporary miniatures, and were no doubt painted by the same hands. It maybe thought that such compositions gain from being carried out on a larger scale than the miniature. It perhaps becomes more obvious that the landscape elements are no more than artificial background, but the figures gain in grace and in the detailed depiction ofelegant costume with patterns aslovingly reproduced asin Elizabethan portraits (pis. 39, 40). This room preserves the only complete interior of a palace decoration ofSafavid times.
As the restoration of the Chihil Sutun wall-paintings proceeds some large historical scenes in the central hall of the palace have been

uncovered. These are in a style different from that of the smaller paintings in room P4 and in both composition and chiaroscuro betray Western influence. They show successive shahs receiving foreign guests identified asHumayun at the court ofTahmasp I; the khan of Turkestan, Nadr Muhammad, received by'Abbas I; and Shah 'Abbas II with
the Uzbek ambassador.1 No attempt hasbeen made to depict these scenes in the dress of the time, but allwear contemporary costume of the period around 1670, at the beginning of the reign of Sulaiman. It was only at this time that we begin to find evidence of Western influence in Safavid painting. The wall-paintings in the large hall are thus some twenty-five years later than those inthe smaller rooms P4 and P5. Nearer instyle tothe wall-paintings inthe side rooms are some large panels of wall-tiles which once adorned some of the pavilions which were erected in the gardens behind the Chahar Bagh. Several of these figural compositions are now preserved in Western museums (pi. 69), all showing similar scenes of young men and women enjoying themselves in flowery gardens. They arein the cuerda seca technique in which the colours are separated by greasy lines. Of the work of one or two stray European painters known to have been patronised byShah 'Abbas I no trace now remains; but after the middle of the century there is thedefinite evidence in the Armenian churches andhouses in Julfa, the foreign suburb of Isfahan, which followed not, as might have been expected, a Near Eastern tradition but a Northern European, Dutch one. It is in fact the Italianising Flemings and Dutch whose style is reflected in the semi-Western style paintings which have survived from the last quarter of the century. The two leading exponents of this style seem to have been 'All Qull Jabbadar and Muhammad Zaman. The best collection of the work of
both artists is in theOriental Institute, Leningrad.2 This Muhammad Zaman isnot to be confused with the calligrapher Muhammad Zaman
KirmanI, mentioned by QazI Ahmad,3 a Tabrlzl active there atthe end of the 16th century. Furthermore, it cannot unfortunately beassumed that he was the same as the "Muhamedzama" whom the Italian
traveller N. Manucci met in Delhi about 1660,4 who had been sent by Shah 'Abbas II early in his reign as a student of theology to Rome

where he had been converted to Christianity and had taken Paolo as his baptismal name. He had therefore not cared toreturn toIran but had sought the Mughal court, where Shah Jahan had given him a pension and installed him with other Persian expatriates in Kashmir. There are chronological difficulties about this identification, for the visit to Rome seems actually to have been in the early 1630s under Shah SafI, whereas the dated work of our painter in Iran falls between the years 1672 and 1697. These works are signed Muhammad Zaman b. Hajjl Yusuf, with no indication of a Christian connection. Of his forty-seven known
works, four are of Christian subjects,1 but all these appear to be copies directly from engravings (the same kind of material copied by the Mughal artists atthe court of Jahanglr and Shah Jahan from the work
of Northern artists who were trained in Rome).2 Thecolouring certainly implies that Muhammad Zaman was familiar with paintings of this school, but heused a mixed style which retains the original composition, but with the spirit and conception of a Persian miniature transposed into a Western idiom with cast shadows and plastic modelling. The trees are directly borrowed with their gnarled trunks and bunched foliage from the school of Martin van Heemskerck; while clouds are barred with shafts of sunlight. Muhammad Zaman is best known for his three illustrations added to the royal NizamI of15 39—43
in the British Library,3 and two tothe now fragmentary Sbah-ndma in
the Chester Beatty Library.4 All five are dated 1086/1675; and this and the two following years are the period of sixteen miniatures supplied to a manuscript of the Kbamsa of NizamI in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. These are smaller and in a lower tone, but they illustrate the same thoroughly mixed Westernised Persian style, as in the "Shirln discovers the murder of her Husband Khusrau" (pi. 66). Each element may be borrowed, but the whole remains eastern. It is hard tobelieve that this artist could have pursued asystematic course in the studio of a European painter in Rome. An extreme example ofthe mixed styleis one of the miniatures added to the British Library NizamI, showing
Bahram entertaining a princess,5 a night scene with mixed candle and moonlight which the painter has used as anexcuse for exaggerated chiaroscuro. The princess and one of the serving maids wear European

dress, while Bahrain isdressed inthe contemporary shah's costume. Since this must have been a royal commission, we are entitled to assume that this hybrid style appealed to the personal taste of Shah Sulaiman (1077—1105/1666—94). A court scene in which a shah enthroned gives audience to a Mughal
ambassador, now in the collection of Prince Sadr al-Dln Agha Khan,1 is attributed to Muhammad Zaman and dated about 1663 by comparison with a drawing signed byShaikh 'Abbasi, showing a shah in similar dress and also receiving a Mughal embassy and apparently
dated 1074/1663—4.2 The Shah in this drawing is older and with a fuller beard and moustache than that in the first drawing, so that the latter would need to be earlier; yet 1663 is already very early for awork by Muhammad Zaman. Moreover, the costume of the shah in both is that of the reign of Shah Sulaiman, who succeeded in 1077/1667 at the age of twenty; and both show notable European influence. The solution proposed is that both these court scenes date from the early 1670s, the date on the drawing by Shaikh 'Abbasi being 1084/1673. Both Shaikh 'Abbasi and his son 'All NaqI show in their work Mughal as well as European influence and this became from then onwards an element in
the late Safavid painting style.3 The second leading figure in miniature painting in this period was 'All Qull Jabbadar, who was also evidently fascinated by such Western
portraits as he could see.4 He too painted the shah surrounded by his courtiers, including apage boy in Dutch costume and, since he wears
his hair over his shoulders, perhaps actually a European.5 This artist has a less sure grasp of perspective than Muhammad Zaman, as is betrayed by the insecurity of this group which seems to float rather than tobe based on the ground; but he achieves an equally realistic finish. 'All Qull may have been ofGeorgian origin since two ofhis drawings carry notes in Georgian and one, in the British Museum, signed Ghulamzada Qadlml 'All, has been reasonably attributed to his
hand.6 It represents a couple in Georgian dress but in the Persian court style. The secular art of Georgia at this time was thoroughly Persian

ised;1 butif 'All Qull was actually Ghulamzada he was presumably born inIsfahan or Julfa. This synthetic style was still invogue up to the end ofthe century and indeed beyond through the reign of Shah Sultan Husain (1105 —35/1694—1722). There isa large manuscript ofthe Shdh-ndma in the Metropolitan Museum dated 1663-9 butwith miniatures added between 1693 and 1698 and signed by the painters Aqa Nuyan, Ghulam Parmak and 'All NaqI, whom we have already noted as son of
Shaikh 'AbbasI, and by Muhammad Zaman.2 It also contains some of the last work ofMu'In, who naturally maintained tothe end the style of his youth under 'Abbas II and was little affected by the new vogue. This style was continued after the turn of the century bythe sonof Muhammad Zaman, Muhammad 'All, who was working as late as 1721, when he signed a careful and no doubt official drawing of the last
Nauruz present-giving ofSultan Husain, now inthe British Museum.3 The rigidity of the architectural perspective and chiaroscuro and the conventional modelling of the faces of the depressed courtiers show the signs of artistic decadence parallel with the political decline. A drawing in the Leningrad album signed by Muhammad SultanI and dated
1694—54 is in the same style and may well be bythe same hand. It shows the shah at the time of his accession. That this shah too favoured Western painting is proved byhis commission to the Dutch painter
Cornelis de Bruyn, who visited Isfahan in 1701 topaint his portrait.5 Muhammad 'All is known also as apainter in lacquer, amedium which was to beincreasingly important during the 18th and 19th centuries. His signed work in this medium includes two qalamdans signed 1701
and 1708,6 both painted with figures inlandscape in the same style as his miniatures on paper. A famous album of Mughal andPersian painting and calligraphy in the Academy of Sciences at Leningrad is enclosed in a painted lacquer binding which bears the twodates 1147/1734 and 1151/1738, during the very last years of the Safavid dynasty. The front cover has afineover-all design of flowers symmetrically arranged around acentral cartouche rather like a carpet design;

the back cover shows birds and flowers confined toa central cartouche and the border. It was dedicated toa certain Muhammad Mahdl Khan
but isunsigned.1 This isthe kind ofdecorative lacquer painting which was to be favoured during the next hundred and fifty years. In thesixteenth century the art of binding had kept abreast of the other arts of the book in quality of design and execution, and in rich variety of technique. Leather is always thebasis, even of the lacquer painted covers, which were introduced atHerat under Husain Baiqara. No doubt the painting was carried out by miniaturists of top rank. These bindings can never have been common and they are unfortunately easily damaged; and consequently few survive ingood condition. The bigger libraries generally have examples, and in the British Library is a binding signed by SayyidI 'All on amanuscript of the Divan of Nava'I (Or. 1,374)
of about 1550;2 and two detached covers ofvery fine quality and large size from about 15 40, formerly in the Diisseldorf Museum and bequeathed tothe British Museum by Sir Bernard Eckstein in 1948 (pi.
67), but these have some damage in areas of the outer faces.3 This damage reveals that a deep blue ground was used as an undercoat, asit was also inlacquer-painting on wood. Another landscape lacquer binding on a manuscript of the Divan of Shahl in thelibrary of Trinity College, Dublin, shows the poet, who had lived at the court of Shah Rukh, reciting toa prince in a garden.

Instead of human figures it includes combats of mythical Chinese beasts and is comparable with abinding dated 15 69 in

binding.1 The use of metal stamps isolder, and the austere bindings of the first half of the 15 th century aregenerally regarded as superb examples of reticent design. In them Chinese motifs, especially the dragon and phoenix, are employed in a quite un-Chinese way in arabesque panels and combined with arabesque floral scrollwork; thus conforming to the concept of Chinoiserie, the use of Chinese elements, valued for their exotic character, in accordance with a different mode of
vision and design.2 This stylistic feature persisted in thelater 15 th century, when the whole face ofthe cover was embossed with richly gilt pattern. When this technique was first used the moulds were supplemented and finished with agood deal of hand tooling, but in the ioth/i6th century this was reduced to nomore than retouching and finishing off. In this field Chinoiserie design persisted much longer than in the arts of illumination, metalwork or textiles. It is only in ceramics that there is a continuous tradition of Chinese design in Persian blue and white. They aredatable only by reference to the periods of the Chinese prototypes, among which the Chia-ching (1522-66) dishes and bowls decorated with cranes in flight among clouds are conspicuous. The quality ofbody and glaze was superior in this type to anything achieved earlier and is confidently attributed to
Mashhad,3 which remained through the nth/17th century a leading centre forthe blue and white pottery industry. In the earlier Safavid period Kirman has been suggested as the place oforigin ofsome blue and white vessels onwhich the Chinese designs have been rethought
and redesigned, as on some bearing dates of15 23 and 15 25.4 Soon after this date the influence of Iznik design and colouring becomes apparent in some handsome dishes and jars and vases also attributed to the Kirman kilns. Examples are inthe Tehran archaeological museum and the Victoria and Albert. The "Kubachi" ware also shows Iznik influ
ence at this time, though more in thecolouring than the design.5 Tabriz has already been suggested asthe centre forthis ware, and it might be urged that it was more open to Anatolian influence than Kirman. On the other hand, Tabriz and the whole province of Iranian

Azarbaijan had a troubled history throughout the Safavid period,at least until the reign of Shah 'AbbasI. The exact date of the introduction of this polychrome ware is uncertain: the typical products of tiles or dishes with bust portraits of smart youths and girls show the fashions current at Qazvln in the 15 90s, while some dishes also copy Chinese border patterns from Wan-li porcelain (1573-1619). The attractive colouring, which includes a substitute for the brilliant Iznik red, supersedes the earlier .16th-century black painting under a green or turquoise glaze. The quality and durability of the ware at the same time decline and the products are correspondingly scarce. The 17th century ware, which is more reliably connected with
Kirman, has a more provincial appearance1 and maynot be earlier than the middle of the century. By this time blue and white wares were being made in Iran in large quantity and especially for export through
the Dutch East India Company,2 who found that they could sell them in Europe as Chinese, especially during the years between about 1653 and 1695 when export from China was interrupted. It may be that production for the export trade encouraged the inclusion in the designs of figures in Western dress as well as Chinese and Persian; but Western figures and dress were also to the taste of Isfahan in the 17th century. The more freely these designs are derived from the Chinese, the more vital and amusing they are. Celadon ware was also imitated at this time in Kirman, but the decoration, painted in white slip, sometimes with the addition of touches of blue and red,is in a purely Islamic style, with
arabesque patterns or sprays of flowers.3 No earlier a date can be given to the revival of lustre-painted decoration after a clear break during the early Safavid period; and again the designs are entirely native to Iran. The rather crowded floral patterns, often with some landscape elements, are related to the margin painting in manuscripts both in style and in the use of different tones of gold. In the earlier period a pure
white ground was preferred,4 while later blue or occasionally yellow ground was adopted. The body is finer than that of the Kirman wares and the polychrome wares identified with that centre combine formal

and geometric motifs borrowed from architectural decoration,1 with similar floral designs as an alternative to Chinoiserie. This ware also is from the later 17th century. In contrast to the abundance of pottery production in many different centres in the 17th century, the only significant development in metalwork isin the use and decoration of steel, whether for armour and sword-blades, or cut through as decoration, in which calligraphy
usually supplies the main element.2 Thus calligraphy, which had become more and more dominant in the decoration of brass or copper vessels, finally achieved virtual independence in the cut steel applique to wood or leather. On helmets (pi. 70) and body-armour chasing and intarsia were the usual methods, and some royal pieces are carved all over in low relief. Even more care was taken with the sword, the blade being of an elegant curve and the handle of jade, agate or shagreen. So the period ends with the applied arts at ahigh level of technical skill; closer awareness of foreign styles and markets, but with diminished originality and a loss both in ceramics and miniature painting of the inspired wealth of invention of earlier centuries.

CHAPTER I 7 (a)
PERSIAN LITERATURE IN THE
TIMURID AND TURKMEN PERIODS
(782—907/1380—1501)
This long period of 120 years wasa troubled one. Tlmur's attack on Iran, which began in 782/1380—1 with the invasion of Khurasan and Slstan, terminated thepre-Timurid interregnum in a period characterised bysudden alarms. Even after the conqueror Tlmur's death, except for the comparatively peaceful reign of Shah Rukh (807—850/1405 1447), conditions throughout the land remained unsettled; his successors could not be at peace one with another; government was the plaything of turbulent rivals. Besides numerous princes of the Timurid dynasty, there were other leaders on the scene, such as those of two Turkmen dynasties, the Qara Quyunlu and Aq Quyunlu, who had established themselves in theregions of Azarbaljan and western Persia, with occasional inroads into the eastern regions of the country. Eventually this state of affairs was ended in theeast by the Shaibanids and in thewest by the Safavids. Disturbances that can be dated back to the Mongol invasions,and which finally developed into the disruption anddisorder of the period after Shah Rukh's death, occasioned a serious decline in civilisation and deterioration in thought. At the beginning of this period a few of the scholars, poets and writers ofthe interval between the Mongol Tl-Khans and theTimurids were still alive and affording contributions to science and literature. But apart from these few, and with the possible exception of those who had gathered atthe court ofSultan Husain Balqara at Herat and who were didactic rather than original, we hardly hear of any important or justly celebrated men of learning or science until the latter part of the 9th/15 th century. During this period the Persian language was continuing the complex evolution which had begun in the 7th/12th century. In addition to those changes in vocabulary, syntax and inflection which necessarily accompany the historical development of a language, other factors accelerated changes of a more radical nature. On the one hand, the influence of eastern Persian dialects wasday by daylessened, eastern

TIMURID AND TURKMEN PERIOD LITERATURE
Persian elements being supplanted by those of western Persian. On the other hand, some Arabic words and compounds which had gradually come into use in the common tongue as well as in the works of former writers became so firmly ensconced in the language that they replaced their Persian counterparts and attained permanence. At the same time the admixture of Mongol and Turkish in Persian increased; some of the many single words and compounds in use since the time of the Mongols became established features of the language. The use of the Turkish language was so prevalent during this period that, as it had been introduced into poetical works and was patronised by literatureloving but Turki-speaking rulers and notables, a Turkish prose and poetic literature eventually emerged, and this in Khurasan, the very cradle of Persian's development as a literary language. Some exponents of literature having elected to write in this new literary medium, an argument about preferences resulted, to be expressed in a work like the Muhakamatal-lughatain ("The Arbitration between the Two Tongues") of Mir 'AH Shir Nava'I, the famous minister and patron of letters under Husain Balqara. The character of Persian literature at this time was decided not only by changes of this nature in the language, but also by certain factors which were leading it into new phases and simultaneously towards decline. Among these influences was the fact that before the Mongol invasion poetry and prose writing had been subject to strict rules and conventions and had been closely connected with courts, in a thoroughly "classical" situation; whereas in this later period creative writing was in the hands of the common people as well as under court influence, and ceased to be subject to former exacting literary standards. The explanation of this is that, before the Mongol invasion, a poet or writer had to learn a number of rules and examples in both Arabic and Persian. This schooling naturally resulted in a broadening of his literary horizon and an increase in his knowledge of the best
models of literary techniques.1 In the period under review, and also in later times, this concern for the great classical models either completely disappeared or at best could only rarely be discerned among the more refined and better educated. The shedding of traditional literary conventions resulted in a decline in the generally shared knowledge of the

POETRY
styles, devices and disciplines of exemplary writers and poets; a consequent weakening of style was inevitable. This lapse of style and ignorance of forms are, with the outstanding exception of a writer like JamI, observable in most of the works of this period. The closing down of important Persian literary centres in Khurasan and Iraq, the break-up of courts which had supported and encouraged poets and writers, and the disappearance of great men or families who before, and even for a while after, the Mongol invasion of Persia patronised such activities, combined to cause the gradual disappearance of great masters like those of classical times without producing any worthy successors. Poetry and prose fell into the hands of men for the most part of mediocre talent.
POETRY
Persian poetry, therefore, like the language itself and, indeed, other branches of learning, was not as resplendent in this period as it might have been. In addition to the reasons already propounded, there was constant political instability and also, though admittedly to this there were exceptions, an absence of leaders and sovereigns of literary taste who enjoyed a plenitude of power and breadth or continuity of dominion that would have made for a wide and consistent cultivation of a ripely developed literature. In other words, it was a time of transition, which left the marks of unsettlement and flux on its literary products. Among the exceptions to rulers not capable of literary patronage were such Timurid princes as Shah Rukh, Balsunqur Mlrza (d. 837/ 1433), Ulugh Beg (850-853/1447-1449), Abu Sa'ld (855-873/14521469) and especially Husain Baiqara (873—911/1469—1506) and his minister Mir 'AH Shir Nava'I. These men, with a few others, were essayists themselves in the literary arts (or at least had works attributed to them) and admirers of men of literary talent, their courts providing centres of artistic and scientific achievement. But their fitful and regional patronage of letters in the disturbed conditions of the times seems often to have been susceptible to errors of judgment, to have lacked information on what was best; while the general dearth of notables willing to invest the weight of their influence on the side of literature made it difficult for a few, even had their taste and awareness of what was sound and what was not been of a higher order than they were, to stem the tide of decadence.



TIMURID AND TURKMEN PERIOD LITERATURE
Undoubtedly themost important Timurid centre of culture was Husain Balqara's court at Herat, which in retrospect seems to have shone out like a beacon in lands only recently devastated by Tlmur's own career of conquest, and which in eastern Iran afforded arefuge for the arts after Husain had succeeded incarving out a realm for himself in Khurasan, following the strife that had ensued on Tlmur's death and his failure to consolidate an empire in Iran. Numbers of poets, writers, historians, musicians and painters were attracted to Herat, there to introduce styles and techniques that were to continue in fashion, and in their development, until Safavid times. Hence it iscorrect to say that Husain Balqara's literary, scientific and artistic circle left a great impress on Iran's intellectual and artistic life. But the high place occupied by painters at Herat evinced a new departure, and that towards the visual arts, and a new manifestation ofartistic vitality, of significance in discussing the decline of literature and the absence of originality, not only inliterary invention but in thought. It was as ifa new channel of expression for the genius of Iran had been opened. At theoutset of the Timurid period a number of talented poets followed the methods of their predecessors of the 8th/14th century. Those who wrote poetry inthe next generation adopted a style which was quite new. They even criticised the imitators of the old masters. As Katibi has said:
He is no poet who, when he writes verses, brings together thoughts from the poems of the old masters. No house which isbuilt with old bricks stands on so firm a foundation as a new house.
The poetic language of the Timurid era came closer than had poetic diction hitherto tothe colloquial tongue. The reason for this development was that in this epoch poetry was less, as wehave seen,the speciality of the court, and, at the same time, had become more current among the common people. Since the poet had to write to suit popular taste, adherence to former poetical traditions seemed of less importance. It is possible that tothis attitude may be attributed the relatively large number of poets and of poetasters of this period; reference to the biographies of this and of the early Safavid period shows the increase in their numbers after the post-Mongol, Il-Khanid times. Ifone examines the biographies ofthe poets ofthe Timurid era, such as Daulatshah's

916



POETRY
and its Persian translation, entitled the Latd'if-nama, and the Tuhfa-ji Sami by the Safavid Sam Mirza, one encounters a concourse of poets who in fact represent only a part of the total. As will be also seen in connection with the Safavid period, this development cannot be divorced from the popular nature of poetry, now current among a variety of classes of people. The prevalence of Turkish ultimately ensured its total use as a medium for poetry, or its adoption, for variety's sake, even by those who usually stuck to Persian. One of the greatest of those who usually wrote in Turkish but sometimes in Persian was Mir 'AH Shir Nava'i (d. 906/1501), Husain Balqara's minister. His works in Turkish include four collections (divans) of gha^als (odes) and five masnavls (rhyming distichs) in the manner of Nizaml's Khamsa,while another work, the Lisdn al-tair, ("The language of the Birds"), was in imitation of Farld al-Din 'Attar's Mantiq al-tair. In his Persian poetry, which has not been praised by critics, he wrote under the pen-name (takhallus) of Fani. In the poetry of the Timurid period, as for example in that of Katibi of Turshlz, one comes across specimens of rhetorical nourishes and poetical artifices. Although some men of letters tended to adopt such conceits, it must be admitted that this was not very common, the more celebrated writers and poets of the age preferring simplicity. Mysticism was still a favourite topic for poetry. In particular, suf1 expressions were in common use in ghazals. Now and again such poets as Shah Ni'mat-Allah Vail, Qasim al-Anvar and JamI wrote long poems of a suf I character. Love romances and poems consisting of anecdotes and tales on ethical and philosophical subjects were relatively numerous. They were mostly written in imitation of Nizaml, whose themes were sometimes versified anew with slight changes. Furthermore, among the various poetical forms practised in the Timurid period, the ghazal received special attention. Towards the end of the Timurid era increasingly ingenious thoughts and artifices are noticeable in the ghazal. A possible reason for this development may be that the Persians, in consequence of the Mongol invasions and the massacres and plundering of the yth-cjth/ 13 th- 15 th centuries, were forced to turn to spiritual matters and neglect the material world. They therefore tended to adopt far-fetched and non-corporeal, artificial themes, which they endeavoured to express as succinctly and strikingly as possible. When this style, whose origins - chiefly in the circle of Husain



TIMURID AND TURKMEN PERIOD LITERATURE
BaTqara and Mir 'AH Shir Naval atHerat - are being considered here, is more fully discussed under the Safavid period, it will be seen that a balance between words and purport was not always maintained. The latter tended increasingly towards the fanciful. It was far-fetched in proportion as it departed from any basis in reality: it went beyond that realm of poetry in which the imagination's function is to transmute the world of actuality into theexpression of universal ideas. Hence it became a weak and overplayed genre. Following these general observations brief references will now be made to some of the principal Timurid exponents of the poetic art and their works, roughly in chronological order; though inthe instance of the first to be singled out, he has priority of place for the merits of his achievement as well. This was Kamal al-Dln b. Mas'ud (d. 808/1405—6), who had lived in the interval between the Mongol Tl-Khans and the Timurids and was known by his pen-name ofKamal, Kamal-i Khujandl, a master inthe ghazal form. While to students of Persian literature he is always remembered as one of the outstanding contemporaries of Hafiz,his own sense ofhis superiority toHafiz can hardly win support. Nevertheless, he did play an important part inperfecting the ghazal form. Contemporary with Kamal was Mulla Muhammad Shlrln MaghribI of Tabriz (d. 809/1406-7). Mulla Muhammad's ghazals and tarji'-bands'^ contain numerous references to the ideas and aspirations of the Muslim mystic: Mulla Muhammad was himself celebrated as a siifl, andhis notions tend markedly towards pantheism. As a poet, however, he must be regarded as mediocre, in aclass similar to that of 'Ismat-Allah Bukhara'I or 'Ismat-i Bukharl (d. 829/1425—6). 'Ismat left some celebrated amatory ghazals and qasidas in addition to tarji'-band poems. In the words ofProfessor Browne,2 a poet "who offers the greatest possible contrast to MaghribI, themystic and pantheist", was Abu Ishaq ofShiraz (d. 827 or 830/1424 or 1427), known as Bushaq At'ima
because he was "the poet of foods".3 Appropriately enough his divan, the collection ofhis ghazals, qasidas, quatrains and masnavis, is entitled the Kan^-i ishtiha ("Treasure ofthe Appetite"). This collection is
1 Atarjf-band ("return-tie") is a poem comprising strophes of five to eleven verses in length, each verse within each strophe rhyming with the rest; the final verse of each strophe remaining the same throughout the poem as a refrain; the verse in the last strophe preceding this refrain contains anallusion to the poet in indicating his pen-name (takhallus).

POETRY
of importance because of the details and names it gives of various foods, and of the festive occasions and eating habits associated with them. His poems and several small treatises, "The Tale of the Saffroned Rice", "The Book of Bushaq's Dream" and "The Glossary", are full of the old culinary terms of Iran up to his time. He was not without his imitators, for example Nizam al-Din Mahmud Qari of Yazd, who in the 9th/15 th century also wrote verses on such subjects as dishes and dress. His poems have come down to us in his Divdn-ialbisa ("The Divan of Clothes"), which is now printed and is important because of the details to be derived from it of the dress of that century. Also belonging to the 9th/15 th century was Sayyid Ni'mat-Allah Vail of Kirman (d. 22 Rajab 834/4 April 1431). He was a great mystic and the founder of the Ni'matallahl order of dervishes. His mystical poetry, which is of mediocre quality, consists of ghazals, qasldas and masnavis. Another mystic was Sayyid 'All b. Nasir b. Harun, better known as Qasim al-Anvar (d. 837/1433-4), whose divan contains a number of poems in the dialect of the province of Gllan as well as some verses in Turkish. The qasldas and masnavis of Maulana Muhammad b. 'Abd-Allah Katibl of Turshlz or Nishapur (d. 839/1435—6) are well known for their poetical artifices. He was the author of punning masnavis in which he used double metres and double rhyme; these poems were entitled Husnu'ishq ("Beauty and Love"), Nd%ir u man%ur ("The Viewer and the Viewed") and Bahrdm u Gul-Anddm. It is said that towards the end of his life he began a poetical rejoinder to the Khamsa of Nizaml. A poet who has been praised for the beauty, effectiveness and clarity of his verse is Mir Shahl Sabzavari (d. 857/1453). In particular, his ghazals are worthy of attention as they are full of meaning and beauty. Similarly, the love poems of Shaikh Azarl of Isfara'in (d. 866/1461—2) are lively, graceful and full of fine ideas. A well-known poetical work which is attributed to him is the Bahman-ndma, about the Bahmanid rulers of the Deccan. Maulana Muhammad b. Husam al-Din, better known as Ibn Husam (d. 875/1470—1), wrote poems of various kinds as well as a religious epic entitled the Khdvardn-ndma describing the travels and wars of 'All b. Abl Talib. The divan of his qasldas has been published in modern times in a printed edition.
919



TIMURID AND TURKMEN PERIOD LITERATURE
Among the poets of the second rank of this epoch are Shihab of Turshlz, Slml of Nlshapiir, Ghiyas of Shlraz, Khiyall of Bukhara, Baba Sauda'I, Talib of Jajarm and several others. At theclose of the period there were other poets ofthis class, such asHilall Chaghata'I, Hatif I of Kharjird, Qasimi anda few more. As, however, most of those in the latter group gained fame in theearly part of the Safavid era, they will be mentioned in thelater section. By far the most outstanding literary figure of the last years of the Timurid epoch, a man who as a poet ranks as thegreatest after Hafiz, was Nur al-Dln 'Abd al-Rahman Jaml (b. 817/1414, d. 898/1492). This poet and mystic, besides being one ofthe greatest writers ofhis age and a prolific one, a scholar in both Arabic andPersian, a critic as well as poet and one of Islam's most celebrated biographers of great figures in the path of Sufism, was also one ofthe leaders of the Naqshbandi order of dervishes, a fact which must attest the saintliness and studiousness of his life. In his masnavis Jaml followed Sa'dl and Hafiz, and in his ghazals the qaslda-writers of Iraq. However, one must notconsider Jaml's poetry as being empty of original ideas, power of expression and beauty of meaning. Although he cannot be said to equal his eminent predecessors, he,as thelast great Persian poet, may be said to have a place and importance of his own.His poetical works include, first, the Haft aurang or Sab'a ("Septet"), which consists of seven masnavis, the Silsilat al-%abab ("TheChain of Gold"), Salman u Absdl, Tuhfat al-ahrdr, Subhat al-abrdr, Yiisuf uZulaikha, L,aild uMajnun andthe Kbirad-ndma-ji Iskandari. Thecollection of Jaml's ghazals, qasldas andtarji'-bands is filled with mystical ideas, stories andlyrical themes; but more will be said of Jaml in discussing Timurid prose-writers.
PROSE
Persian prose in theTimurid era had a relatively promising beginning. Since the prose works ofthis period were written for the most part in a simple and familiar style, they are comparatively free of the technical and rhetorical exaggerations of the 6th/i2th and 7th/i3th centuries: one meets with only occasional examples of ornate writing in which a highly artificial style is employed. The Timurid prose writers paid less attention to archaic Persian wording; they often used the words and compounds in common use in their own time, hence the simplicity and
920



PROSE
fluency of their style. However, the influence of the Turkish language cannot be overlooked. Also writers in this period paid little attention to the fundamental rules and conventions of the Persian language; a fact to be associated with their lack of any desire to be precise, to keep facts in view and ensure the soundness of their subject matter. Although, generally speaking, traces of an artificial style are rare, for prefaces, the beginning of chapters and dedications to leaders and other dignitaries an ornate style was adopted. Frequently the abundance of ingenious but superficial titles and compliments obscures the real meaning of a passage. In some works one meets with dry rhyming prose and inadmissible formalities; but in others there is a refreshing directness. By and large the prose of this era lacks the firmness and succinctness of ancient writers, and appreciation of their style and adherence to their canons of taste are not, as a rule, in the least conspicuous. There was no lack of variety in the subjects treated: they include scientific problems, history, tales, biography, commentaries on the Qur'an, theological questions, mysticism, ethics and so on. The tendency to write on scientific subjects in Persian had been strengthened in the Mongol period and was still present. The reason was that, as the fall of Baghdad receded further into the past and the influence of the Arabic language and literature diminished, the need to employ the Persian language in the composition of scientific works became increasingly pressing. A matter in the closing years of the Timurid period which has already been alluded to and is worthy of consideration is the use of Turkish as a literary language. The writing and compilation of books in that tongue was encouraged in the literary circles at Herat. This was in effect the strengthening of a movement which had been introduced earlier by Husain Balqara and Mir 'All Shir Nava'i. Among other works, the Majalis al-nafd'is, the Muhakamat al-lughatain, the Mahbub al-qulub, the Munsha'dt and others by Mir 'All Shir Nava'i and the Babur-nama by Zahlr al-Dln Babur were written in Turkish. Parallel to this development was the appearance of those bilingual poets to whom reference has already been made. / One of the highly regarded writers of the^period was Nizam al-Dln Shanb-i GhazanI, known as Nizam-i ShamI, a contemporary of Timur. In obedience to Tlmur's orders he wrote the Zafar-nama. Its style is simple, in contrast with that of Sharaf al-Dln 'All Yazdl, another

learned historian and writer, who made use of this biography in his own Zafar-ndma-ji Timiiri.His is a longer work, written in afloridand verbose manner, and was completed in 828/1424—5. Tlmur's very last years, together with the early years of the reign of Shah Rukh, had meanwhile been covered inthe Shamsal-husn, composed by Taj al-Din Salman! in 813/1411. A slightly later historian was Shihab al-Din 'Abd-Allah b. Lutf -Allah al-Khwafl, known as Hafiz-i Abru (d. 833/1430), whose Majmd al-tavdrlkh is a vast general history from the Creation down to 830/1426-7 in four volumes. Of these the last, known independently as the Zubdat al-tavdnkh-i BdTsunquri, isconcerned with the period following the death of the Tl-Khan Abu Sa'id in 7 3 6/13 3 5. In addition, Hafiz-i Abru produced other historical works which are much briefer but of scarcely less importance: ahistory of the Kartid rulers of Herat from c. 732/1331—2; a history ofthe Sarbadars; and surveys of the reigns of minor potentates in Khurasan such as the Tl-Khan Togha Temur, Amir

Hafiz-i Abru's anonymous geographical treatise, finally, is a major historical source in its own right, containing original data especially on his native Khurasan and on Transoxiana. Ahmad b. Jalal al-Din Muhammad, known as Faslh-i Khwafi, was the author of the Mujmal-i Fasihi, which he completed in theyear 845/1441—2 and submitted toShah Rukh.

traditional learning and achieved considerable fame during the reign of Shah Rukh. Among his better known works are his translation of the Milal wa'l-nihal by Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Karlm ShahristanI, and the Asrdr al-salavat and the Tuhfat-i 'ald'iyya on the principles of the Islamic religion according to the four SunnI schools. He also wrote a number of books in Arabic, in which he adopted a florid style. Among the distinguished prose writers of this period was the poet Nur al-Din 'Abd al-Rahman JamI, one of whose greatest works is the Nafahdt al-uns ("Breaths of Fellowship"), a biography of 614 sufi saints. This book, written in 883/1478-9, is for the most part a translation of a collection of sufi biographies by Khwaja 'Abd-Allah Ansarl of Herat, a work written in the Herat dialect and itself for the most part a translation of the Arabic work, the Tabaqdt al-Sufiyja, of Muhammad b. Husain SulamI of Nlshapur, though each of the two translators added something of his own. The Nafahat al-uns, which is written in a simple and clear style, is one of the most authoritative works on the subject of the sufis and has a long introduction respecting their doctrine. Another of Jaml's prose works, the Kitdb al-bahdristdn, was written in imitation of Sa'dl's Gulistdn and intended to teach his young son, for whose benefit he included at the end a memoir of some of the most famous Persian poets. Also deserving mention in a catalogue of Jaml's prose works is the Lavd'ih ("Flashes"), consisting of 30 articles (Jd'iha), each of which briefly describes a principle of mysticism. As a commentary on difficult points in the LMma'dt of Fakhr al-Din Ibrahim
'Iraqi,1 a famous poet and mystic of the Mongol era, JamI wrote, in simple and direct language, his Asbi"at al-lama'dt ("Rays of the Flashes"), a highly important Persian work on mysticism. In addition to this commentary, JamI also wrote Persian treatises on other theological and literary works, including the Ndi-ndma (MasnavT) of Jalal al-Din RumI, and commentaries on the poems of Amir Khusrau of Delhi. Another writer of this period was Ghiyas al-Din 'All b. 'All HusainI IsfahanI, a contemporary of Sultan Abu Sa'Id the Timurid, whose book, the Ddnish-ndma-yi jahdn, is an important work on divine and natural philosophy, written in simple Persian prose. It will not be out of place here to mention one of the most remarkable translations into Persian prose, the translation of the Rasd'i/ of the Ikhvan al-safa, from a summarised Arabic version entitled Majma'

TIMURID AND TURKMEN PERIOD LITERATURE
al-hikmat. This book, in clear and spirited Persian, dates from the reign of Tlmur; several manuscripts of it are extant. One of the greatest chronicles of this period, awork which has been used as a source by most subsequent historians, isthe Mat/a' al-sa'dain ("The Dawn of the Two Auspicious Planets"), written by Maulana Kamal al-Dln 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Samarqandl (d. 887/1482). This history covers aperiod of some 170 years, from the reign of the last Il-Khanid
ruler of Iran, Abu Sa'Id (716-736/1316-1335), t o t n e end of that of Timur's great-grandson, his namesake, who reigned from 855/1451—2 to 873/1469. Though the author had the nisba "Samarqandl", hewas himself born at Herat; Samarqand was the birthplace of his father, Maulana Jalal al-Dln Ishaq, who had been a jurist and divine under Shah Rukh. The love of historical narratives and desire for annals of their own times evinced by the Mongol Il-Khanid rulers continued down tothe days of Tlmur and his successors. The great work of Daulatshah b. 'Ala' al-Daula Bakhtishah of Samarqand, the Ta^kirat al-shu'ara ("Memoirs ofthe Poets"), takes us out of the realm of history into that of a species of literary history, anthologising and even, itmay be said, literary criticism. For in addition• to brief biographies of the poets, written in a straightforward, bombastfree style, and to numerous extracts from their works, whencethe anthologising aspect of the book is derived, Daulatshah permits himself to make judgments on the powers of his chosen poets. Admittedly, these judgments range in degrees ofpraise rather than ofderogation. This feature gives the work the impress ofbeing deliberately revivalist or recollective in purpose, as if a later age was considered in need of prompting to recall the literary splendours oftimes past. Daulatshah, whatever his private motives, received publicly acknowledged encouragement in the preparation ofthis volume from Mir 'AH Shir Nava'i, that Maecenas to whom allusion has already been made. Next to the Lubab al-albdb of Muhammad 'Aufi, Daulatshah's work is the most important collection of biographies of poets in Persian; though there is a considerable time gap between the two compositions, for 'Aufl's work goes down only as far as 625/1228. The date of Daulatshah's death is uncertain: it was at some time between 896/1490—1 and 900/1494—5. While we are on the subject of this particular uncertainty indating it is appropriate toissue the now standard warning about Daulatshah's unreliability asa historian. His observations on the dating and his accounts of the lives of poets are so

frequently inaccurate that his statements cannot, generally speaking, be accepted without caution. Legend and fact are inextricably intermingled. Nonetheless, his treatment of the lives of 105 poets comprises a volume of surpassing interest and great readability. Returning to purely historical narrative, the Rau^dt al-janndtft ausaf madinat Hardt was completed in 875/1470 by Mu'In al-DIn Muhammad Isfizarl, whothus provided posterity with a book of considerable value as containing the chronicle of the Kartid rulers of Herat, and events of the Timurid period up to the reign of Husain Balqara, with many useful details about the notables of that time. As a stylist, Isfizarl deserves special mention for the clarity and sureness of his use of language. He was similarly a master in the epistolatory style, and was for a time in charge of the court correspondence. There are, however, decorative attempts in his "History of the City of Herat", comprised of quotations from some of the older poets, and also in the occasional adoption of a florid and prolix method of exposition, in particular in some decriptive flights and in introductory passages. A local history such as Isfizarl's is of great importance to later historians, butmuch better known is thegeneral history of Muhammad b. Khavand Shah b. Mahmud, known as Mir Khwand (b. 838/1434-5, d. 903/1498). This work is called the Rau^at al-safd fi sirat al-anbiyd va'l-muliik va'l-khulafd, andis in seven volumes. Thelast part wasadded by his daughter's son, Ghiyas al-Din b. Humam al-DIn Muhammad, surnamed Khwand Amir. Like his grandfather, Khwand Amir enjoyed the patronage of the Timurid rulers, to whose courts, especially that of Husain Balqara, Mir Khwand had been closely attached and by whom he hadbeen highly respected. This last volume deals with events in the reigns ofHusain Balqara and of his son, Badl' al-Zaman Mlrza. But the total work had for its objective a detailed record of pre-Islamic history and of the Muslim era; while, thanks to another and later hand being engaged in completing the Raut^at al-safd, the last section deals with episodes that followed MirKhwand's death. It is written in simple, informal language and maybe said to bring to culmination the stylistic
tendencies in the prose of the Timurid age.1 Besides completing his grandfather's Rau^at al-safd, Ghiyas al-DIn
Khwand Amir (d. 941/15 34— 5)2 wrote a collection of biographies of

Muslim viziers, including those ofIran, called Dastiiral-vu^ard, and a general history, the Habibal-siyar, which comes down tothe reign of the Safavid Shah Isma'Il I (907—930/1502—15 24) and beyond. The latter work will be discussed below. Abu'l-GhazI Sultan Husain b. Mansur b.BaTqara b. 'Umar Shaikh b. Tlmur, the last notable Timurid prince to rule in Iran, has been mentioned sofarforhis patronage ofliterature in the capital, Herat, where he had been born and which he captured on Abu Sa'Id's death in 873/1469, torule Khurasan thence for thirty-eight years until his own demise in 911 /1506. Adivan of his poetry in Turki is, according to
Storey, to be found in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris.1 But in prose at least he must be mentioned here as possibly aPersian author in his own right. For he is the ostensible compiler ofthe Majdlis al-'usbshdq ("Conferences of the Lovers"). This work comprises an introduction treating of earthly and divine love, and seventy-six "conferences" in which, inornate prose interspersed with verse, an equal number (or thereabouts) of mystics, famous lovers andkings arethe subjectmatter. The work was begun in 908/1502—3 and completed in the next year, the last person to be dealt with in it being Sultan Husain himself. As reference to Storey's bibliography and to Browne's A. Literary
History ofPersia will show,2 the book was severely criticised by the Mughal emperor Babur (932-937/1526-1530) inhis Babur-ndma. Here it is attributed notto Sultan Husain butto Kamal al-Din Husain Gazurgahl, and described as awretched book, full of"insipid" lies, in which carnal and spiritual loves are confused the one with the other, and from which the odour ofheresy isnot entirely absent. Babur was equally incensed over the attribution made by Kamal al-Din to Sultan Husain ofa work inwhich the verses are undoubtedly by himself and not by the sultan. The book, for allits weaknesses and despitethe difficulty over its correct attribution, nonetheless deserves tobe mentioned here because it serves to illustrate the taste and interests of some of the literati of the time, however lapsed the former may appear to have been, and however exotic the latter.
Although for ornateness of style, and as affording yet a further
example ofa decline in rhetoric,3 he cannot be put ina superior class, Kamal al-Din Husain Va'iz-i KashifI of Sabzavar (d. 910/1504-5) was a

much more genuine and serious writer than the compiler of the Majalis discussed above. As his title of Va'iz implies, he was a preacher and resided in Herat, where he was a member of the sufi order of the Naqshbandls. His late work, the Akhldq-i Muhsim,dedicated to Husain Balqara and composed in 900/1494—5, entitles him to rank among the writers on ethics in Persian, followers of the example set by Nasir al-Dln Tusi (d. 672/1274) in his Akhlaq-i Ndsin (633/1235-6). But this was by no means the sole, nor the most important, production of this typical Muslim savant, a jurisprudent, a litterateur, a Qur'anic exegetist, a man versed in astrology and the scholasticism of his time and religious environment. One of his more famous works, though more famous in India than Iran and written in a florid and turgid style, is his Anvdr-i Suhaili ("The Lights of Canopus"), which is, in fact, a translation in a
revised form of the Kalilava Dimna.1 He also wrote a Makh^an al-inshd ("Treasury of the Art of Composition"). Another of Va'iz-i Kashifi's works achieved considerable celebrity in the fervently Shl'I Safavid epoch, when it was recited at the assemblies which collected to mourn the deaths of the Shl'I martyrs. From this use of it the work became known as the Majdlis-i rau^a-khwdm, ("The Assemblies of the Recitations of the Martyrs' Deaths"), but its correct title is the Rau^at al-shuhadd ("The Garden of Martyrs"). It deals particularly with the martyrdom of the Prophet's grandson Husain, the Third Imam, and with persecutions undergone by other prophets and imams, and is once again a work composed in a highly rhetorical style. While its historicity is not of much validity, its nature is indicative of 9th/15 th century religious and stylistic impulses, of a kind which increased in prominence during the succeeding era. In the field of Qur'anic exegesis, Va'iz-i Kashifl produced, for Mir 'All Shir Nava'I, a Persian commentary on the Qur'an entitled the Mavdhib-i 'Aliyja, completed in 899/1493-4, and representing a concise work in contrast to his other essay in the compilation of a commentary on the Qur'an, the Javdhir al-asrdr, also called the Javdhiral-tafsir ("Gems of Exegesis"). This undertaking was planned on a more ambitious scale than theMavdhib. In yet another sphere, though one which might also be adduced as a
1 Browne's comment is interesting, lot. cit., where he states that Husain Va'iz "set himself to 'write up' and improve upon the work of his predecessors", this being a reference to the Persian version of Ni?am al-Dln Abu'l-Ma'all Nasr-Allah in the 12th century, based on 'Abd-Allah b. al-Muqaffa"s Arabic version made in the 8th century.

reason for including this author under the heading, ifnot of authors of ethical works, at least of those on social categories and institutions,is Va'iz-i Kashifl's ¥utuvvat-ndma-yi Sultdni, a work ofgreat interestfor the study of Iranian social history, since it deals with the mannerof training, the beliefs and the conventions ofvarious groups of Fitydn (Jdvdnmarddn), "youths".
Concerning astrology he wrote the Ikhtiydrdt and the Sab'a Kdshifa ("The Seven Kashifian Discourses"). His Lubb-i lubdb-imasnavi is an abridgement ofJalal al-Dln Ruml's Masnavi, itself abridged inhis further work, the Lubb-i lubb. Besides the works mentioned, this versatile preacher's name has been appended tonumerous other prose dissertations andopera. His son, Fakhr al-Din Va'iz (d. 939/15 32—3), was also awriter of the late Timurid and early Safavid periods. His most famous composition is the Rashahdt-i 'ain al-haydt ("Sprinklings from the Spring of Life"), a work devoted to the grace, teachings and examples of Khwaja 'Abd-Allah, a great leader of the Naqshbandl order of sufis of the Timurid era, and ofhis associates. Inaddition, Fakhr al-Dln wrote an interesting and informative collection of anecdotes about various classes ofsociety: rulers, ministers, divines, sufis and others. There remains Jalal al-Dln Muhammad As'ad Siddlql Davani (b. 830/1426—7, d. 908/1502—3), the author of the Akhldq-i Jaldli,a work on ethics whose more correct title is theLavdmi' al-isbrdq fi makdrim al-akhldq("The Beams ofthe Suns inthe Graces ofEthics"). This work, like Va'iz-i Kashifl's Akhldq-i Muhsini,stemmed from the tradition of works on ethics established by theAkhldq-i Ndsiri of Khwaja Naslr al-Din Tiisl. The prose works which were afeature of the Timurid period cannot be left without some reference tothose connected with the sect ofthe Hurufis, which was founded in the reign of Timur by a certain Fazl-Allah of Astarabad. The most important work of this sect, whose scribes adopted a special literary style with symbols and idioms peculiar to their persuasion, is the founder's own Jdviddn-ndma. Other Hurufi texts are the Adam-ndma, the 'Arsh-ndma, the Hidayat-ndma, the Ustuvdr-ndma, the Kursi-ndma and the Muhabbat-ndma, while there is a key to the secrets of the Jdviddn-ndma entitled the Miftdh al-haydt ("Key of Life").

CHAPTER I 7 {b)
HAFIZ AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
One ofthe great experiences inIran isa visit toShlraz and the delightful garden that is laid out around the tomb of Hafiz; to enter under the white marble baldachin that covers the tombstone onwhich some ofthe poet's verses areengraved in elegant nasta'ltq, and to open the Divdn-i
iidfiz t o l°°k for zfa'l, an augury, according to well established rules that have been followed forcenturies. During such a moment the visitor may perhaps recall the beautiful lines written bythe"last classical poet" of Turkey, Yahya Kemal Beyatli (1881-1958), who uses one of Hafiz's central concepts, that of rind("vagrant"), in his poem Rindkrin oliimii:
In the garden at Hafiz's tomb there is arose
Which opens every day with blood-like colour;
At night, the nightingale weeps until dawn turns grey,
With a tune that reminds usof ancient Shlraz.
Death is a calm country of spring for avagrant; His heart fumes everywhere like a censer — for years ... And over his tomb that lies under cool cypresses A rose opens every morn, every night anightingale sings.
During the long history of Islam Shlraz was always an important centre of learning, mysticism, andpoetry. In spite of frequent changes in government, numerous wars and internecine feuds of its rulers the city can boast of a long-standing cultural tradition. To be sure, the 8th/14th century, when Hafiz lived, was no longer the time of the asceticism of Ibn-i Khafif (d. 371/982) norof the high-soaring mystical experiences of Ruzbihan Baqli (d. 606/1209), and the days of Sa'dl, whose works made the name of Shlraz known in theWest before those of most other places in Iran, had long passed. But the religious tradition was embodied in one of the leading Ash'arl theologians ofthe later Middle Ages, 'Azud al-Dln Tjl (d. 756/135 5), whoheld the office of chief qadi under AbuIshaq Tnju, although he later withdrew from Shlraz. His Mawaqif, a kind of Summa Theologica, was to become a standard work in scholastic theology, and it is said that Hafiz, too, studied it. TheMawaqif wasoften commented upon by later theologians; among them was —still during Hafiz's lifetime — al-Sayyid

al-Sharlf al-Jurjanl (d. 1413) who, after long wanderings inEgypt and Turkey, was called tothe Muzaffarid capital in 13 77 asa professor in the Dar al-shifa madrasa, and returned once more to Shlraz after a prolonged stay in Samarqand whither Timur had carried him. Jurjanl's Ta'rifdt are still ahelpful instrument for the understanding of theological definitions. Poets were not lacking either in Shlraz or in other Persian cities around 1350. E.G. Browne goes so far as tocall the 8th/i4th century the richest period ofPersian literature, a fact which he ascribes tothe existence ofnumerous small courts that competed with each other in attracting literati. Salman Savajl (d. 778/1376), the panegyrist of the Jalayirids in Baghdad and Tabriz, is noted for his "fluency of language" and his skilful use ofiham ("amphibology") which he displayed in "artistic qasldas" (qasida-yi masnif). His contemporary Kamal al-Dln Khwaju KirmanI settled finally inShlraz, where he died in 1352 or 1361; he left a divan with enjoyable ghazals. Certain similarities between his verses and those of Hafiz have been pointed out by the critics. Besides lyrical poetry he composed a Khamsa, out of whose five — mostly mystically tinged — epics the story ofHumal and Humayun has attracted the interest of scholars because of the exquisite miniatures
that adorn one ofthe early 9th/15 th century manuscripts.1 Somewhat later we find Kamal Khujandl (d. probably in 803/1400) in Tabriz; he and Hafiz seem to have been acquainted, although Kamal, an interpreter ofthe theory of vahdat al-vujiid, iscensured as "abstruse" by the sober commentator SudI in the ioth/i6th century. InShlraz itself the poetry of 'Imad al-Dln Faqlh KirmanI (d. 773/1371—2) was widely acclaimed. Hewas the chief panegyrist of the Muzaffarids, a fertile lyrical author, and also produced five mystical masnavls. 'Imad al-Dln and Hafiz were allegedly not on very friendly terms, assome biographers assume, who spin out a story from Hafiz's verse:
Don't be duped when the devotee cat performs the ritual prayer,2
which isinterpreted as referring to'Imad's well-trained cat. However, as Browne pointed out, Hafiz's expression can bemore safely traced back to a verse in Mush u gurba ("Cat and mouse"), a little epic still widely read inIran which has often been lithographed or printed with

simple illustrations. Its author, 'Ubaid-i ZakanI (d. 772/1371), a citizen of Shiraz, which hedearly loved, is mainly noted for his satires; his prose satire Akhldq al-ashrdfoffers an interesting picture of the vices of Persian society in the 8th/14th century. However, to speak of Shiraz in the 8th/14th century - in fact, even to mention the city's name atall among educated Westerners - meansto recall immediately the one name that has become the epitome of the Persian lyric for both Oriental and Western readers, that of Muhammad Shams al-Dln Hafiz. Surpassed in popularity, particularly in the English-speaking world, only by 'Umar Khayyam, the name of Hafiz stands in the West for everything Persian: for the apogee of uninhibited sensual delight; enjoyment ofthe prohibited wine; and the predominance of love in all its shades, while most of the Oriental interpreters see in him "the tongue of the Unseen World", singing of Divine Love and spiritual intoxication. In the German-speaking world, Hafiz's name has become almost a household word since the days of Goethe. But famous as he is in both East and West, and much as he has been interpreted as the embodiment of sensuality and free thinking on the one hand, and of the highest mystical enthusiasm onthe other, yet it is difficult to give a satisfactory account of his life; and the orientalist views with envy his colleagues in the field of German or English philology who can follow the development of their great writers step by step, almost day by day. In the case of Oriental poets it is next to impossible to transgress the narrow framework offered by the biographers and to infuse real life into the numerous anecdotes which arerepeated time and again by the writers. Afew remarks incontemporary historical sources, perhaps a tombstone, or some scattered hints in thepoetry itself, may prove helpful for the chronology of a Persian lyrical poet's life. On the whole, our knowledge ofHafiz's life iswoefully inadequate. The preface of one of the oldest manuscripts — used intensively for the first time by Qasim Ghani and Muhammad Qazvlnl - contains atleast some biographical material. But even the date of Hafiz's birth is not yet established. Some authors, like Ghani, put it in 717/1317—8, while others such as M. Mu'in plead for 725/1325 - 6 , adate which would agree fairly well with the statement in 'Abd al-Nabl's Maikhdna (written in 1626) that Hafiz died at the age of sixty-five lunar years. Most European scholars seem to have accepted a date oic. 719/1319—20. Hafiz's father, a merchant who had migrated from Isfahan to Shiraz, died early, leaving the family in straitened circumstances. Yet young



HAFIZ AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
Hafiz apparently enjoyed the traditional education in amadrasa. Some sources speak of his poverty, and say that heapprenticed himself to a doughmaker to earn his livelihood. It seems that heworked as a copyist for quite some time; forthe library inTashkent owns a copyof
Amir Khusrau's Khamsain his hand, dated 9 February 1355.1 That means that even inhis thirties he had still todo some menial work. However, he must have been very well versed inthe Qur'anic sciences; hence hisnom-de-plume Hafiz. His Arabic was excellent and inlater years he taught exegesis and other theological courses in Shiraz. According to the preface hestudied Zamakhsharl's Kashshaf(to which he incidentally alludes in oneof his ghazals), Sakkakl's Miftdhand several other Arabic works; according to A. Krymsky, some of his
Arabic works are extant in autographs.2 A charming story tells how he received hisinitiation intheart of poetry atBaba Kuhl's tomb on the hillside near Shiraz, where 'AHb. Abl Talib appeared to him and offered him some heavenly food.The beautiful ghazal,
Dush vaqt-i sahar as^ ghussa najdtam dddand
(Yesterday atdawn Iwas given relief from my grief),3
is taken asan allusion tothis event, although thestory was almost certainly invented tofitthe poet into the Shi'I tradition. But inspite of Krymsky's opinion, he was not an avowed Shi'I, for no authentic Shl'I verse appears inthe Divan. Several invitations from rulers outside Fars show that his poetry attracted some interest quite early. Ahmad Jalayir, himself a skilful poet and talented calligrapher inter alia, invited him probably after Shah-i Shuja"s death (786/1384). Butbefore that the ruler ofthe Bahmanid kingdom inSouth India sent for him, as one century earlier the ruler of Multan, Prince Muhammad b. Balaban, the Maecenas ofAmir Khusrau, had invited Sa'dl toleave Shiraz for India. Hafiz did not accept any ofthe invitations; but in one ofhis ghazalshe speaks of far-away Bengal where his poetry was appreciated - poetry, which, like a perfected sufl, can perform themiracle of taiy al-makdn ("ubiquity") and, though only achild one night old, can immediately make one year's journey.

the traditional combination of the sweet-speaking parrot with sugar:
All the parrots of India become "sweet-spoken"
From that Persian candy that goes towards Bengal,1
a line in which we find a subtle allusion to his superiority even over Amir Khusrau, who was commonly called the tiitt-ji Hind and whose work Hafiz himself had copied. Very little isknown about Hafiz's personal life. He must have been married, and one ofhis ghazals isinterpreted asan elegy for his son, who died, probably, in 764/1362-3. According to Firishta, who is followed by an 18th-century Indian writer, the polyhistor Azad BilgramI, one of Hafiz's sons bythe name of Shah Nu'man came to India and isburied in Burhanpur. We do not know whether Hafiz belonged to one of the numerous sufI orders which were then quite active inthe Middle East. The area of Shiraz was the first part ofIran where a more closely knit community of dervishes had been formed by Abu Ishaq-i Kazaruni (d. 426/1035) and his followers, who were not only active in helping the needy inFars but soon extended their activities as far as India and China. Hafiz's colleague Khwaju was a member of the Kazaruniyya. No name of any of the leading sufi masters — be it 'Abd al-Qadir al-Gllanl, the Suhravardls, orMaulana Ruml — occurs inhis verse,at least not overtly. Maybe the frequent use of musical terms and allusions tothe samS point toHafiz's knowledge ofRumi's poetry,in which such imagery abounds. But this is only avague supposition. Ifit is correct that one Plr Muhammad 'Attar was his shaikh, he wouldbe
connected with the silsila ofRuzbihan Baqll, as Ritter points out.2 The poet apparently used toattend the sessions ofMaulana Qivam al-Din 'Abd-Allah. That is stated not only in the old preface but also in an account according towhich the Kubravl mystic Sayyid Ashraf al-Din Jahanglr Simnanl (d. 808/1405), thepatron saint of Kichhaucha in
eastern Avadh, met Hafiz around 782/1380.3 The only way tofindout more details about Hafiz's life is to look, asRitter has done recently, for the explicit andcovert allusions to political figures whom he praised orblamed with subtle allusions.

When the poet was still very young, the Tl-Khan Abu Sa'Id died, in 756/1335. Abu Sa'Id's successor executed Sharaf al-Dln Mahmud Shah, whohad been semi-independent in Shlraz since 725/1325; after a struggle of seven years, Mahmud Shah's sonAbuIshaq Tnju took over. Some of Hafiz's poems praise the tolerant and artistically-minded prince and his vizier Qivam al-Dln Hasan. But soon, in 754/1353, Shiraz fell to the Muzaffarids, whose first ruler, Mubariz al-Dln, was orthodox, harsh, and not inclined tospare human life. He inturn was deposed and blinded by his own son Shah-i Shuja' after five years of reign. One usually understands those poems inwhich Hafiz deridesor attacks the detested muhtasib, the superintendent of market police,as applying toMubariz al-Dln's reign. The most famous ofthese poems,
agar chi bada farahbakhsh u badgulbt^ ast...
(Even though thewine is pleasure-granting andthewind scattering rose-petals,
Don't drink wine at the sound of the harp, for the muhtasib is
impetuous)1,
alludes inits last line ("for now itis time for Baghdad and Tabriz") to the two Jalayirid capitals (both of which were later conquered by Shah-i Shuja') asmore congenial places for the poet tosing. It seems, however, difficult to place all muhtasib poems in Mubariz al-Dln's time, for example, the following verse:
Don't tell themuhtasib myfaults, For he,too, is continually, like me, in search of wine
[or: of good life].2
The solution of these problems is left to the interpreters' understanding.
When Shah-i Shuja' ascended the throne times changed for the better, and Hafiz sings cheerfully:
At dawn, glad tidings reached myear from the voice of the Unseen World:
It's the time of Shah-i Shuja' - drink boldly wine!3
Shah-i Shuja' himself, though an educated man, was a mediocre poet;his

court poet proper was 'Imad al-Dln Faqlh, but Hafiz too wasone ofhis eulogists and it seems that Shdh-suvar, who repeatedly represents "the beloved", is a subtle allusion to this ruler's surname Abu'l-Favaris. When theprince left Shiraz between 765/1363 and 767/1366 Hafiz wrote some poems that complain of separation from the "Friend". During those years Shah-i Shuja' had to fight his ownbrother Mahmiid, who in 1365 even laid siege to Shiraz, along with theJalayirid Shaikh Uvais.For some time the relations between the ruler andthepoet apparently cooled down; atleast the view of the biographers regarding Hafiz's verse,
Gar musulmdma% an ast ki Hafiz darad Vdi agar a\ pai-ji imru^ buvad farda'i
(If the state of a Muslim is such as Hafiz possesses
Woe, ifthere were a tomorrow after today!1),
is that it estranged him from the ruler because ofits apparently nonIslamic character. Fardd has of course to be interpreted as Day of Judgment, which in the Qur'an is often called "tomorrow", just as diish ("yesterday") inPersian poetry usually points tothe time before creation, the Day ofthe Covenant (ru^-i alasf), when "the angels kneaded
Adam's clay".2 Hafiz may have travelled to Isfahan and Yazd during the "estrangement" around 1373; but the relevant traditions are weak. Shah-i Shuja' was succeeded in 786/1384 by Zain al-'Abidin; he after a brief reign by Shah Yahya. During that time the internecine feuds in the Muzaffarid family continued. More importantly, Timur, in the course of his incessant conquests, reached Shiraz in 1387, the same year when hemassacred 70,000 people in Isfahan. He stayed in Shirazfor two months and may well have met Hafiz, interested as he was in gathering learned menand artists from all over the Muslim world. The anecdote about thedialogue between theworld-conqueror and the poet has been told and retold — probably spun out of the famous matla' about the Turk-i Sbird^i. The story is found in a rather early source, Shuja'-i Shlrazl's A.nis al-ndsof 830/1426—7, so it may contain some truth; it was then popularised by Daulatshah, from whom Eastern and
Western writers alike took it.3 Hafiz died in 791/1389, to which thechronogram khdk-i musalld

would fit, or in 792/1390 (thus the chronogram b s 5; in the old preface). It is said that the orthodox refused to have him buried in a Muslim cemetery because of his anti-orthodox, sensual poetry; but by means of an oracle taken from his poetry they finally agreed toa correct burial. The story may ormay not be true; the custom of asking the Divan for good advice inevery situation has been maintained. Since Hafiz had been too busy with teaching and scholarly workhe had no time, according tothe early sources, tocollect his Divan himself; this work was left tolater scholars. And here the major problem for every interpreter ofHafiz's poetry begins: the lack of an authentic text. We do not even know the identity of the "Friend" (usually called Muhammad Gulandam) who speaks inthe preface about his acquaintance with the poet. After Boelke had made some researches into the oldest available manuscripts, Robert M. Rehder discussed once more in 1974 the textual tradition of Hafiz's poems, in a brief, welldocumented article, giving an account of fourteen dated manuscripts prior to the year 827/1423-4, which is the date of the GhanI - Qazvlnl text. Was the"Friend" the only collector of Hafiz's verse? Ordid independent collections exist soon after the poet's death? The latter possibility seems more likely. Single ghazals ofHafiz can be found in manuscripts written during his lifetime, for example in a collection made in 781/1379—80 in Baghdad. A safina, collected a year later in Shlraz, contains four of Hafiz's ghazals. In 1937 Rempis drew the attention of the scholars to amanuscript dated 820/1417 that belonged
to one Muzaffar Husain in Hyderabad, Deccan;1 but, asRehder states with regret, the whereabouts of the manuscript, which was taken to Pakistan by its owner in 1948,are at present unknown, since itis not to be found inthe Library of Khairpur Mlrs, which acquired the bulk of Muzaffar Husain's library. The National Museum in Delhi has a manuscript dated 818/1415, with 358 ghazals, on loan from Hyderabad. Another manuscript, mentioned byRehder asno. 13, consists ofan anthology and was formerly in Gavanpur; since it contains the preface it seems to be thesame manuscript which was carefully edited by Ahmad and Na'Inl in 1971.It contains 435 ghazals. Ritter had studied two very valuable manuscripts in the Ayasofya Library in Istanbul (AS 3945 and 3857), dated 1410 and 1413 respectively; one of them was written for the library of the Timurid prince Iskandar b. 'Umar Shaikh,

from whose library another copy is preserved in the British Library with 152 ghazals which was edited by Khanlarl. The Revan Kojkii in the Topkapi Sarayi, too, owns a pre-827 manuscript of Hafiz's poems, and an important manuscript ispreserved inthe library ofthe Tajik Academy ofSciences (no. 555) and described by Galimova. That the text of Hafiz's Divan was rather garbled as early as about a century after his death is understood from the statement of the versatile Timurid author Sharaf al-Dln Marvarld, who writes that "through the transcribing of the text by various scribes ofdefective understanding many of the pearls and precious stones of that 'pattern of the praiseworthy and eminent' [Hafiz] became the prey of the plundering ringers
of a handful of fools",1 and bythe fact that one of Husain Balqara's sons, Prince Farldun Khan, decided in907/1501-2 toproduce a better
edition, which found its way later into the British Library (Or. 3,247).2 Almost every Persian Divan has a tendency tobecome inflated; but in the case of Hafiz's poems this process is even more natural. After all, it was the only book besides the Qur'an out ofwhich prognostication was taken. Therefore many poets, scholars, and eager copyists have inserted their own verses or appropriate poems in Hafizian style for the sake of gaining fame under his name or of participating in the baraka of the book; others may have tried toimprove verses according to their own taste. Nor can we exclude the possibility, suggested byRehder, that a certain number of variant readings exist because Hafiz wrote more than one version of a poem or revised his words. Sudl's commentary comprises, in one edition, 575 poems, in Brockhaus, 692 poems; the editio princeps (Calcutta, 1791) has noless than 725 poems. The inflation ofthe text is most conspicuous inareas where Persian was a living language, as inIran and India. People's admiration for Hafiz is reflected in the care the calligraphers took to transcribe his verse on beautiful coloured paper, surrounded with margins full of delicate golden drawings. His poems were copied not only by the masters of nasta'llq but also by the specialists in shikasta.Did the artists perhaps think of the poet's clever use of letter-images and of his complaint that the Friend did "not send him a
letter to catch the bird ofhis heart with chainlike script"?3

Several copies of the Divan have been decorated with miniatures, one of the finest being that in theFogg Art Museum (Cambridge, Mass.), datable to c. 1527: it originally contained two miniatures by Shaikhzada and five by Sultan Muhammad. The most attractive andat the same time intriguing picture is theone by Sultan Muhammad which shows the various stages of heavenly and mundane intoxication, where "Hafiz himself, popeyed with drink orreligious inspiration, sits
in a window with the huge wine jar",1 under a roof on which angels are dancing and drinking, while in the lower level wild-looking dervishes produce strange music. It is indeed apicture "which demolishes theconventional split between theeffects of wine and divine ecstasy. Inthis extraordinary transcendental painting, low comedy and
high religion meet.. .".2 And thus the problem that has puzzled generations of scholars and admirers of Hafiz, whether to interpret his poetry as sensual or mystical, seems to be solved by the brush of one of the greatest Persian painters. About the time when Hafiz passed away, the Ottoman Sultan Murad I in 791/1389 vanquished the Serbs at Kossovo and thus subjugated the Balkans. Subsequently, the representatives of the growing Turkish literature began totake a more intense interest in the works of Persian poets, who became their literary masters and whose style deeply influenced the so-called Divan edebiyafi. Shaikhl (d. c. 1451) and even more Ahmed Pasha (d. 1496) are obviously influenced by Hafiz's lyrical style. Ottoman interpreters and commentators carefully preserved theHafizian heritage without interfering too much withthe actual text. Yet Hafiz's poetry was apparently viewed with some suspicion in orthodox Turkish circles; otherwise it would not have been necessary to askthefamous mufti Abu Su'ud (d. 1578) for ajatvd concerning the poet's religious attitude. Thewise mufti gave an elegant ambiguous answer, explaining that Hafiz's poetry on the whole was not really objectionable but that some expressions were prone to wrong interpretation, and it was left tothe reader's discrimination to select the correct interpretation. Abu Su'ud's judgment is important, because during and shortly after his time three most widely used commentaries were written to elucidate Hafiz's verse. Sham'i and Sururl took to the mystical interpretation, while the Bosnian SudI gives sober,

grammatical explanations. His dry but useful commentary was toform later the basis for most European interpreters ofthe Shlrazi poet. The mystical understanding ofhis Divan was prevalent inSafavid Iran and the countries to the east. There his admirers allegorised his verseby applying the standard equations aslaid down by authors like Muhsin
Faiz-i KashanI:1 every curl ofthe beloved means the dark manifestations of contingent beings which veil andyet enhance the radiant Absolute Beauty of the Divine Face, or may pertain totheja/ai-side of God, His Majesty and Wrath; while every wine was only the wine of love, every tavern the non-qualified unity. This kind ofmystical interpretation is the reason for some Indian sufl leaders' keeping with them only three books, i.e. the Qur'an, Maulana Jalal al-Din Ruml's Masnavl, and the Divan of Hafiz. Tradition has it that thepoet's own contemporaries, headed by Shah-i Shuja', criticised a certain incoherence in his verse, and European critics of the 18th and 19th centuries followed them in complaining ofthe lack of a higher logical order. As Hindley wrotein 1800: "Hafiz ... takes the liberty ofglancing with the frenzied eye of inspiration from earth to heaven, from heaven to earth, in searchof objects adapted to the subject of his composition ..." Gertrude Bell, who tried inthe foreword toher translation toevaluate Hafiz's greatness from a Western viewpoint, wondered why there is "almost no echo" ofthe political and martial events that occurred during his lifetime. She touches here a point which was toarouse major discussions fifty years later. But she concluded, "It is as ifhis mental eye, endowed with wonderful acuteness of vision, had penetrated into those provinces of thought which we of a later age were destined to inhabit". Friedrich Veit, who wrote his thesis Des Grafen von Platen Nachbildungen aus dem Diwan des Hafis in 1908, found a "unity of thought" in the poems; but his interpretation is mainly concerned with the homosexual aspects of Hafiz's and Platen's verse. Schaeder, in his masterly book Goethes Erlebnis des Ostens (1938), expressed the opinion that in a Hafizian poem several themes are connected asa kind of leitmotifs. He is thus not too farfrom Arberry, who saw in Hafiz's poetry a progress toward a kind of polyphony: beginning as a poet who is almost "a perfect Sa'dl" inhis ghazals, he then develops the art ofinserting two or more themes and elaborates them in an intricate pattern whose

HAFIZ AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
various "melodies", so to speak, stand in a contrapuntal relationship; this artwould have become more and more refined in the poet's later years. Schaeder remained faithful to the "classical" interpretation of Hafiz's lyrics and harshly contradicted Karl Stolz, who had claimed in an article in 1941 that one could understand Hafiz's spiritual development to a certain extent by observing the changes in emphasis, allusions to persons, etc., referring to Mahmud Human's study iidfi^ chimiguyad? which points tothe same direction ofresearch. Stolz found strong support - though unwittingly - in thework of the French scholar Lescot, who, basing his research mainly on GhanI and Qazvlnl, found that unfilconducteur, a chain ofassociations, connects each verse with theprevious and the following one, andascribed much of the apparent incoherence tonegligent copyists. Like Stolz, Lescot discovered in Hafiz's poetry certain cycles that can be ascribed to different phases of his life, and detected a relative chronology bydisclosing the identity ofpeople alluded to inthe ghazals. Now forthe first time the idea was put forth that Hafiz was in reality apanegyrist who had cleverly used the more orless lyrical introductory part of the usual qasida for his panegyrics, so that the invoked ma'shuq, "beloved", stands for the mamdiih, the object of the poet's praise, e.g. the prince or vizier. Roemer in 1951 came close toLescot's theories, defending the possibility that at least parts of the poems are datable. The problem is, however, that the application ofLescot's and Arberry's methods sometimes puts thesame ghazal in two completely different categories of time, so that neither ofthe approaches can offer aperfect elucidation of the chronology. One year after Roemer's useful survey of "Hafizology" there appeared two articles by Wickens, who first stressed convincinglythe lack ofsignificant or "dramatic" development inPersian poetry, a fact which he explains in thecontext of the Islamic way of thinking in general; his example ofinterpretation reads asif he were over-extending one principle of Persian rhetoric, i.e. that of murSat-i nayjr, from one verse toa whole ghazal. Wickens went on, however, totry to find in each and every word of the oft mistreated Turk-i Shtra^t every conceivable and inconceivable connotation of the written word in order toestablish the underlying "Turkish" feeling ofthe ghazal. In a very outspoken rebuttal of this interpretation, Mary Boyce rightly stresses the fact that inthe East poetry isusually recited orsung, rather

than read, so that the sound is more important than the script; and indeed, how many semi-illiterate people in Indo-Pakistan or among the older generation in Turkey used to know their Hafiz by heart and could insert quotations from his Divan in every conversation! She states correctly that many words, which at first reading may convey only one meaning, prove to carry secondary and associated ideas; but these ideas are either implicit in the meaning of the word itself or conveyed by delicate punning — an observation that brings her close to Schaeder's position. As a working hypothesis, Wickens' "focal theory" can prove helpful; but it should not be taken as absolute norm. Schaeder's viewpoint was taken over, though with slight modifications, by Bausani, who stresses the elemento non emo^ionale,finamente rationale which distinguishes Hafiz's verses from lyrics in the Western, romanticising tradition. Bausani, however, lays special stress on the two small masnavis which are ascribed to Hafiz, i.e. the Saqi-nama and the Ahii-ji vahshi, which he translates and counts among the most personal and inimitable compositions of Hafiz; although both masnavis are missing in some of the oldest manuscripts. Schaeder had branded the sweet and delicate "Wild Gazelle", which is indeed much more "personal" than the ghazals, as greatly inferior to Hafiz's lyrical poems. The Saqi-ndma, again, contains the praise of the wine of ecstasy, and stands in a tradition going back to the famous Khamriyja, "Wine Ode", of Ibn al-Farid (d. 632/1235). What is it that makes Hafiz so incomparable? He has relied upon the poetical tradition as it had been perfected by his compatriot Sa'dl, and a comparison between the motifs and metaphors used by him and his contemporaries - poets like Salman, Khwajii, and others - proves a great similarity in their use of words and images. However, it was Hafiz who was able to weave the best threads of the tradition into a perfect, colourful fabric. But we have to beware of interpreting Hafiz too much according to our own, Western understanding of poetry. Schaeder, followed by Bausani, has put his finger upon the main problem when he says, "For the German the understanding of Persian poetry begins by attempting to forget all his ideas about poetry as an expression of personality or of
experience [Erkbnis]",1 and he advises the reader to go back to Baroque poetry (incidentally Mas'iid Farzad, too, drew a comparison

between Hafiz and John Donne,1 oreven to the mediaeval minnesingers who followed prescribed patterns and images to express their feelings in a stylised form. Hafiz isafter all a master of rhetoric, a poeta doctus, and one of the great difficulties for the Western reader is to disentangle the complicated web of allusions and rhetorical figures that make a line of Persian poetry "true poetry". Rypka hasgiven us numerous examples ofthis important art ofinterpretation, and inhis review ofNicholson's edition and translation of Ruml's Masnavi Ritter too warned against excessive allegorising inour dealings with Persian
poets.2 For only when the rhetorical figures have been understood can a verse be interpreted correctly according toits various levels. Verses of a supreme master of this art, like Hafiz, are like diamonds, hard and well polished so that they send out rays of different colour at every moment. We should not expect our poet to pour out his feelings in sheer lyricism, as is usually done in post-Enlightenment poetry in Europe; rather, the highest art is to condense apersonal experienceso perfectly that it always remains valid, just as one drop of rose-oil represents the "spirit" ofhundreds of roses. The reader can use it at every moment, whether he needs a line for a drinking party ora verse that consoles him by speaking of the beloved's wisdom, of God's inscrutable will. To quote Christensen, "As the love-verses ofa poet can be applied by every lover to anew individual (who differs from the person of whom the poet was thinking), sothese verses can express moods which offer analogies to a love relationship, and, vice versa,
mystical verses can be filled with individual contents."3 Christensen compares thepoetry of Hafiz with thedreamlike play with rapidly changing images and thoughts; they are, thus, similar in character to the faience ornaments onPersian mosques where letters, arabesques, geometrical and floral decorations grow out of each other, and, as we may add, change colour at every moment according to the light ofthe sun. This comparison, incidentally, brings the Danish scholar closeto Wickens' views onthe "non-dramatic" character ofPersian poetry, a distinctive feature which one also may call "carpet-like" - as Goethe addresses Hafiz inthe West-Ostlicher Divan:
Dass du nicht enden kannst, das macht dich gross, Und dass du nie beginnst, das ist dein Los ...,

thus pointing to the "circular" movement of the Persian poem. Goethe was aware that the very character ofPersian poetry is determinedby the form of the ghazal; forthe given rhyme scheme makes the poem assume "atinge ofquodlibet" because the poet's mind isnot focussed on one point but rather turns in a number of directions in order to comply with the exigencies of the rhyme; and, continues Goethe, "We forgive him the most daring metaphor forthe sake ofan unexpected rhyme and enjoy the presence ofmind which the poet can maintainin such a complicated position." Goethe recognised the "guiding spirit"
(das Vorwalten desoberen Leitenden) ascharacteristic ofthis poetry, and he admired the readiness to establish human contacts(Bereitschaft %umGeselligen) in Hafiz's poetry. Such poetry canlift up problems which fill thesoul with extreme tension, transporting them into a realm where tension and calmness are no longer valid, namely that of pure spirit. Sensing this deeply spiritual character that underlies great Persian poetry, heknew that Hafiz's verse should not be interpreted exclusively at face value; for the word — as he expresses it— is afan that hides a beautiful eye and yet makes the observer feel that it exists and may suddenly smile athim. One may claim that Hafiz is perhaps the first poet in the Persianspeaking world who perfectly realised the unity of the mundane and the spiritual sphere. To be sure, Jalal al-Dln RumI had taken his images and symbols from every walk of life, changing even pebbles into poetical rubies, but his poetry was so deeply tinged by his experience of mystical love that it became regarded astrie veritable "Qur'an in the Persian tongue". Mystical poetry had developed particularly in Iran. Literature had been deeply affected by the introduction into sufl thought ofthe shahid, the human "witness" ofDivine beauty (i.e. the charming human object oflove); and we must not forget the maxim that al-majd^ qantarat al-haqiqa, that metaphors, and thus metaphorical, i.e. human, love, form the bridge to the Divine Reality. Already the
early sufls in the time ofKharraz (d. 286/899) an<^ ^1S disciple Junaid of Baghdad (d. 298/910) had developed the artof speaking in subtle hints, ishdrdt. Hafiz lived in the city where Ruzbihan Baqll had composed one of the most important works on chaste love, the 'Abhar al-'dshiqin, and had contributed to our understanding of the theopathic utterances ofearly sufis, particularly Hallaj, in his Sharh-ishathiydt. It would be surprising, therefore, if Hafiz, living in Shlraz and perhaps even related to Baqll's silsila, had not been familiar with the finest art of

HAFIZ AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
mystical isharat. He would certainly agree with RumI, who states in the beginning of the Masnavi that "the secrets of the loved ones [sirr-i dilbardri] can better beexpressed in thestories of others", e.g., by veiling the truth under poetical symbols. It was this artwhich Hafiz has brought to perfection. In almost each of his verses, a constant oscillation between the worldly and the spiritual level can be discovered. That is why his poetry can be interpreted — and, what is more, enjoyed — on two, if not three levels (and there may beeven more hidden meanings). The object can be the beautiful beloved, preferably a fourteen-year-old boy who is ascruel asheis charming and hence called by the traditional term, a Turk; orthe object can be the Divine Beloved Who acts asHe wills, and Who isloved by the poet because He combines jamdl and jalal, Beauty and Majesty, and in spite of the fact that He is "the best of rusers" (sura iii. 47); or the object can be the prince, whose whims are endured bythe subject and who has to be flattered in terms of utter subjection (ashas the beloved) and high praise. In every case the poet remains the 'abd, the loving, admiring, and obedient servant. This intended double-entendre does not preclude, however, the possibility ofdiscovering historical data inthe lyrics. If we approach a poem like theever-present Turk-i Shird^t by a simple analysis ofthe rhetorical devices inthe first verse, we certainly do not find the "charming maid ofShlraz", although the basic idea is as simple as can be: the lover would give away even the most precious thing imaginable for a moment ofkindness from his beloved, orfor a moment ofDivine grace, or for a sign ofroyal favour. The charmof this line resides not inthe rather commonplace idea but inthe expression: Hafiz produces a complete murd'at-i na%ir of five geographical concepts: Turk, Hindu, Shlraz, Samarqand, and Bukhara, and another one from three parts of the body, i.e. heart, hand, and mole. Furthermore, thejuxtaposition of Turk and Hindu is used, which is quite common in Persian poetry, particularly since Nizaml. The Turk supplied, from Ghaznavid times onward, the model for the beloved with his round, light-coloured moon face, amouth like amim or a dot, and slightly slanting eyes — anideal that appears more and moreon Persian miniatures. The Hindu again was the black, lowly and often cunning slave; so much so that mystics like Majd al-Dln BaghdadI (d. 1209) could compare angels and devils to Turks and Hindus respectively. Given this extremely lowly position of the Hindu in Persian
944

imagery, Hafiz's claim to give away two major cities forthe "Hindu" mole of his friend gains even more momentum. Besides, the reader may think ofthe Turk-i falak (the planet Mars) and the Hindu-yi falak (Saturn), stars connected in astrology with minor and major misfortune, and with bloodshed and melancholia respectively. The clever combination of this verse has often been imitated, but never surpassed. But a translation that leaves out the meaningful puns can never capture its real charm. Another line that has been quoted byOriental poets time and again, and in which mystical and profane meaning aremost skilfully intertwined, comes from the ghazal that starts with the daring outcry:
fash mi-guyam u a% gufta-yi khud dilsbadam ...
(I declare it openly and am happy about my saying:
I am the slave oflove, and free from both worlds),1
a mafia' that makes the reader immediately think ofthe imminent danger of ifsha' al-sirr, the divulgence of the secret of loving union which, according to the sufl tradition, was Hallaj's sinand causedhis death onthe gallows. The line in question reads:
On the tablet ofmy heart there isnothing but the alif of the friend's stature
What can Ido? My master did not teach me any other letter.
To play with letters iscommon inPersian and related poetry, and Hafiz is noexception to this custom. The importance of the letter alif has always been stressed: as the first letter of the alphabet with the numerical value i, and consisting of a slim vertical line, itwas interpreted as the symbol ofAllah's unity and uniqueness, but is atthe same time the cypher for theelegant slender stature of the beloved. Why should one go farther than this letter? The alif represents everything that isneeded —asthe Turkish mystic Yunus Emre (d. c. 13 21) says:
The meaning ofthe four holy books
is contained inone alif.2
Verses like this form the basis for the claim of quite afew mystics in Iran, Turkey, and Muslim India to be illiterate and to know onlythe alif which the great master of'Urn laduni, immediate wisdom from God (Qur'an xviii. 65), hastaught them. Forthe mystic it isenough to

HAFIZ AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
remember God's unity as expressed in the alif; as forthe lover,the slender body ofhis beloved completely fills his heart and mind. One more example is taken from a poem inwhich Hafiz complains
of the separation from the Friend.1 The last line mentions his pen, this instrument which he so often praises with grand hyperboles because of its miraculous powers: the pen, with severed tongue, reveals the Friend's secret only after its head is cut. Just as the reed-pen has to be cut for proper writing - which means: telling the mind's secret - so the lover will rather give his head than reveal the secret entrusted to him. "I give the head, sar, but not the secret, sirr", isa common saying. It does not matter whether the poet thinks ofthe secret of loving union with ahuman being whom he does not want to expose to blame, or of revealing, as Hallaj did, the secret of divine love and the experience of ecstatic extinction of the self; or whether he is one of the confidants of his prince who has entrusted him with information that should be kept secret - beit a political consideration, beit,asin the story of King Midas with the donkey's ears, apersonal problem of the ruler (the pen, made of reed, is cut offfrom the reed-bed like the reed-flute which
revealed, according to the legend, Midas' pitiable state tothe world).2 On whichever level we interpret the seemingly pleasant and easy verse, it makes perfect sense. There is no doubt that Hafiz, to quote Wickens, "composed some of
the world's most sublime and technically exquisite poetry".3 Itis asign of truly great poetry that every reader tries toexplain it according to his own understanding, andtherefore the manifold interpretations have a certain legitimacy. But it would be an injustice to Hafiz to interpret his verse exclusively as an expression of a hedonisticand happy-go-lucky attitude — as wrong as itwould be to see him exclusively as lisdnal-ghaib, the "Tongue of the Unseen World," by applying to his verse an overall allegorical interpretation. The greatness ofhis poetry lies inthe unsurpassable balance between the world ofsenses with its wine and beauty, but also itspolitics, and the world of unchanging Perfect Beauty, which is reflected in the changeful manifold. His "deep optimism" (Ritter) has probably to do with histalent to offer the perfect Glasperlenspiel, and we can see him, as did Ritter and others who followed him, as thetrue rind, a man who represents a lifestyle in

HAFIZ AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
which fib al-qalbi, cheerfulness and goodness ofthe heart, is preferred to everything else; an attitude that is certainly contrary to every kind of fanaticism. Perhaps only a poet can fully understand the secret ofHafiz's verse — as Goethe certainly did. Therefore we owe the best explanation of Hafiz's poetry to Riickert, theOrientalist-poet, who sings in truly Hafizian style of the double-sided fabric of Hafiz's colourful lyricsin which sensual and supra-sensual experience areinextricably woven together:
Hafis, wo er scheinet Ubersinnliches
nur zu reden, redet iiber Sinnliches;
oder redet er, wo iiber Sinnliches
er zu reden scheint, nur Ubersinnliches?
Sein Geheimnis ist uniibersinnlich,
denn sein Sinnliches ist iibersinnlich.1
1 "Where Hafiz's mere words seem supra-sensory, he speaks ofthe sensual; or does he speak, where he seems tospeak ofthe sensual, only ofthe supra-sensory? His secret is »»-supersensory [i.e. not beyond sense-perception], because his sensual[ity] is supra-sensory." Naturally no plain prose paraphrase can convey anything more than the vaguest hint of the word-play and verbal music of the German poet's lines.

CHAPTER I 7 (c)
PERSIAN LITERATURE IN THE
SAFAVID PERIOD
For the purposes of this chapter the period to be covered runs from 907/1501 to 1148/1736, one of the most remarkable ages in Iran's history. The Safavid era witnessed a political, religious and military reorganisation andunification of which Iran as it stands today is in no small degree thelegacy. Socially the Safavids gave theIranian people a sense of integration, andof recognition as an entity of consequence in the affairs of the world, which served signally to distinguish this period from thedistractions anddiscord that hadpreceded it. Forthis period terminated the disunity and sufferings which the Mongol invasions had brought about, and which neither the Il-Khanid attempt at resettlement nor Tlmur's subsequent reign of conquest haddone anything to ameliorate; while the events of the interregnum after Tlmur's death had only exacerbated them. A factor which perhaps more clearly than anyother marks out the Safavid period as a watershed was the establishment, during this dynasty's sway of nearly two and a half centuries, of Shi'ism as the official religion of the state. Thus a sect hitherto of secondary importance was raised to supremacy, affording a vigorous expression of Iran's identity — it might even be said, of Iranian nationalism — in face of the challenge presented by the SunnI Ottoman empire, the SunnI Central Asian Turkish states andthe Mughal empire of India. A result of this development which must concern the literary historian was that official recognition of Shi'ism, with its active propagation by the Safavid shahs, prompted the popularisation of Shi'I theology and hence the composition of voluminous works in the Persian, as well as to some extent in the Arabic, language. At the same time centralisation of government gave rise to a political and economic cohesion that not only served to strengthen Iran, butmade possible a large-scale patronage of craftsmanship and the arts, by which the fame of Persia was spread throughout thecivilised world. In spite, however, ofthe form, in place of formlessness, and senseof high purpose with which it would appear that the Safavids endowed their realm, the history of Persian literature in their time, while not
948



SAFAVID LITERATURE
confined to the land of Iran itself, is by no means golden. Two reasons may be adduced toaccount for the way in which this period's literary products present only a qualified lustre, and both must be seen in relation to a decline in thought and learning that spells a falling-off of the essential grounds of a great literature. The first reason is historical; the second is bound up with the religious policy of the age. The events of the preceding centuries, notably theMongol invasions and their calamitous aftermath, had caused many scholars to leave Iran forother regions. Libraries, the repositories of the scholarship of severs! centuries, had been destroyed at theadvent of the Mongols, andmany learned men must have perished, only arelatively small proportion of the scribal and scholarly class surviving and an even lesser proportion remaining inIran. The patrons and the security to befound in the Indian subcontinent in particular exercised anobvious attraction, to the detriment of those traditions of scholarly activity in Iran which, in any case, had been associated with urban centres - Bukhara, Samarqand, Herat, Nlshapur, for instance - destroyed by the troops ofChinglz Khan. Thus despite the encouragement of learning displayed by the Tl-Khan Ghazan (694—703/1295—1304) and later bysome of the Timurid princes, the ranks of the learned remained depleted and scholars of the ensuing eras were chiefly commentators and annotators, rather than originatorsof new ideas. Under the Safavids the attention paid to religious questions,the patronage accorded to theologians, and the fanaticism of the 'ulama and exponents ofa deliberately exploited new doctrinal position, all operated against freedom ofthought. Reference to the life and worksof Mulla Sadra ofShiraz (said tohave died at Basra in 1050/1640— 1), of
whom, in the words of E.G.Browne,1 "itis clear ... that he suffered a good deal at the hands of the orthodox divines", provides an example of the difficulties encountered inone recorded instance ofan influential mind which deviated from the contemporary doctrinaire lines of thought. InSafavid times intellectual activity was cramped, to say the least, and there was a corresponding decline in language and literature. A major factor sofaras literature was concerned was the court's failure adequately to flatter the hopes of poets and authors in Persian;a
1 LHP iv, 429.

SAFAVID LITERATURE
failure to be contrasted with the encouragement offered Persian literature at the court of the Mughal emperors and at the hands of other notables inIndia. Inday-to-day affairs, the language chiefly used atthe Safavid court and by the great military and political officers, as well as the religious dignitaries, was Turkish, not Persian; and the last class of persons wrote their religious works mainly in Arabic. Those who wrote in Persian were either lacking in proper tuition in this tongue, or wrote outside Iran and hence ata distance from centres where Persian was the accepted vernacular, endued with that vitality and susceptibility toskill inits use which alanguage can have only in places where it truly belongs. Inshort, these authors' works can be given only qualified acceptance as examples of a living and genuinely representative Persian. The poetry and prose ofthe Safavid era arewithout the vitality characteristic of earlier ages. But, having reached this general conclusion, the opportunity will be taken here to discuss in greater detail the linguistic situation under the Safavids, with reference to what was then occurring toaffect the composition ofworks inPersian, and also towhat had happened in the preceding period.
THE PERSIAN LANGUAGE IN THE SAFAVID ERA
Of the difficulties experienced by Arabic-speaking Shi'Is who were imported into Iran because of Safavid religious policy, and who arrived not knowing Persian, the well-known anecdote told by Professor Browne about Sayyid Ni'mat-Allah al-Jaza'irl and his brother on their
arrival at Shlraz is sufficiently illustrative.1 But apart from the aspect of the situation tobe inferred from the arrival of Arab divines who were expected to write and speak in Persian in order to spread Shl'I doctrine, there was also the question of Turkish. This aspect may be illustrated, to take one notable instanceof development, by the fate of the Azarl dialect, an old dialect of Persian, in Azarbaljan, where atthe beginning ofthe Safavid period, with the exception ofa few areas, itdied out. This can be related to what had happened in preceding eras: itis attributable to the sojourn of Turks in the region and the domination ofTurkish and Mongol tribes, dating from the 6th/13th century. By the end of the 9th/16th century Turkish was commonly spoken in Azarbaljan's chief centres; though thereis

PERSIAN LANGUAGE IN THE SAFAVID ERA
evidence, albeit scanty, to show that atthe beginning of the Safavid era Turkish had not yet gained complete sway; and even the Turkish now spoken inAzarbaljan isa dialect composed ofAzari, Arabic and some Turkish words, but following the rules ofthe Turkish language. So much for one notable regional development. On a larger scale what demands attention is the marked interest the Safavid monarchs
themselves took in theTurkish language, in addition1 to the factor already touched upon, that most of the expressions used in the government, court and army were in that language. Shah Isma'Il (907—930/ 1502-1524), the dynasty's founder, essayed the art ofpoetry under the pseudonym ofKhata'I; but he composed his Divan in Turkish. The situation is rendered the more strange when it is recalled that in the same period Ottoman rulers wrote ghazals and short poems in Persian. Persian at this time was widely taught in Asia Minor, where its literature was eagerly studied, Turkish literature and polite forms of address being powerfully influenced by, and deeply impregnated with,
Persian images and idioms.1 Not that this influence and currency of Persian inAsia Minor were a new departure restricted tothe Ottoman era. Here once more a legacy from the past was involved. Attention to and production of Persian literature had begun in Asia Minor in the time of the Saljuq rulers of that region, i.e. from the middle of the 5 th/1 ith century. Persian was even more prevalent, during the Safavid period and later, in the Indian subcontinent, where again the beginnings of this, as it were, diaspora-like development must be traced much further back, to the days when Persian had accompanied the spread of Islam inIndia under the dynasts and military conquerors who had reached the subcontinent from eastern Iran: the Ghaznavids, Ghurids and Ghurid mamluks, allof whom established centres in India where poets and writers inPersian received ample encouragement. After the Mongol invasion ofnorth-eastern and northern Iran, the use of Persian in India received a new and greater impetus. As has already been indicated, a large number of Persian poets, writers and scholars (udaba)fledto India from Transoxiana and Khurasan, swelling the crowd of exponents of Persian already at Indian centres.The knowledge of Persian culture and civilisation and the numbers of poets and authors using Persian, producing ghazals, qasldas and masnavlsin

SAFAVID LITERATURE
India were such that to the superficially informed onlooker India might well have appeared the original source and real home ofPersian. Certainly one istempted tolinger over discussion of this development beyond the borders ofIran, and it isafeature of the literary history of Persian to which further reference cannot be avoided in treating literature in the Safavid period. Here, however, comment on itmustbe concluded with noting that, although the uses to which Persianwas put inIndia after theend ofBabur's Mughal dynasty continued to be both elegant and widespread, its scope and popularity inevitably diminished in face of the rivalry of English and Urdu; andnotleast because of the lack of interest shown by Persians themselves in rescuing from oblivion this remarkable "Indian" branch of their language's power, creative susceptibility and cultural influence. Our chief concern inthis section has been to show the nature of the competition, particularly from Turkish dialects, to which Persian under the Safavids was exposed. Therefore, todigress aswe have done into the realms of Persian's influence in Asia Minor and Indiamay seem to beto neglect one objective, while irrelevantly concentrating on analtogether different topic. Indeed it says much forthe strengthof the Persian language that a discussion of it in decline should, in the event, conclude with references toits effects inregions well to the west and well to the south and east ofits original home. But that this interim conclusion inthe study ofthe vicissitudes ofthe Persian language and literature, and itsachievements, during the Safavid epoch is not in fact irrelevant will emerge more clearly later. A passing reference has already been made tothe effect ofthe transplanting of the languageto other regions, and more will have tobesaid on, for example, how far even a high degree ofeminence elsewhere had itsconverse indeleterious consequences upon Persian literary developments inIran itself.
PERSIAN POETRY IN THE SAFAVID PERIOD
It must beconfessed at once that, both in wording andin style,the poetry of this period lacks interest: except for a fewof the more celebrated poets little ofintrinsic value is to befound. There is what might be termed a "classical" reason for this in that, as with their predecessors in the Timurid era,the Safavid poets did not have the training, the thorough schooling in their art, which had been provided under the auspices of the Samanid, Ghaznavid, Saljuq and other,
952



SAFAVID PERSIAN POETRY
earlier, courts. Most of the Safavid writers were not sufficiently wellversed in either thePersian or Arabic languages and, since we are dealing with a classical literature which imposed high and rigorous standards upon itsexponents, it will beappreciated that a profound knowledge ofthese two languages and their literary models and techniques was aprerequisite for any genuinely formative exposition of the tradition ofclassical Persian literature. It will be noticed that specific reference was made above to the patronage extended by earlier courts, and in this we touch upon amatter of the utmost significance inboth the development ofa great classical literary tradition and its subsequent decline. For yet another cause of the decline characteristic of Safavid times was the court's failure to patronise the poet, and the latter's consequent recourse to the common people. A situation that had arisen under the Timurids became more commonplace. One aspect of this development was that itintroduced variety and innovation inpoetry. This might be considered as having been to the good; but, inthe case ofa classical tradition, its corollary ofdeclinein standards of taste and precision cannot be ignored, and to this evil must be added the admission of abuse of grammatical rules of the language. There was novelty in subject-matter; new ideas were introduced during the Safavid period; but ill-chosen expressions and verbal infelicities have also tobe encountered inthis poetry. This is a point at which we can return tothe issue ofthe extent to which Persian was current outside Iran. Although fresh subjects and ideas were introduced because ofthe external areas ofPersian literary endeavour, an alien environment was notwithout its effects on the language's customary firmness and strength. Use of Persian as a purely artistic, literary medium, and that inno small measure for the sake of novelty, away from those cities and villages where it was the medium of living speech and practical intercourse, inevitably led to artificiality and fustian. For the purposes of this chapter sufficient information will emerge about subject-matter when authors and their works are summarised at the end. Here, in ageneral purview of the state of Safavid poetry, itcan be noted that one effect of Safavid religious policy onpoetry was to make elegies acommon mode, and praise of the Imams — that is, of the chief figures of Shl'I hagiology - a common theme. While so much royal encouragement went into the most intense possible propagation of Shl'I doctrine, theology and, in particular, Shi'I jurisprudence and
953



SAFAVID LITERATURE
the traditions accompanying it did not fail to have their numerous exponents. Clearly, poetry could not remain uninfluenced: encouragement likewise went to composers of elegies and panegyrics on the descendants of 'AH, resulting in an upsurge of poetry ofthis order. The situation is vividly brought to light by Iskandar Beg MunshI, the author of the 'A.lam-drd-ji "Abbast, where, on the subject of the position of poets during the reign of Shah Tahmasp I (930-984/
1524-1576), he speaks to this effect:1
Although His Heaven-dwelling Majesty patronised poets during his earlier life,
he was, in his later years, too much occupied to give honour or withhold it; he
regarded this respected class ofmen as latitudinarians, not as righteous and
pious, and he forbade them to recite their poetry before him. Therefore, when
Princess Par! Khan Khanum2 presented him with two qasidas by Maulana
Muhtasham of Kashan, one of which was in his praise and the other in praiseof
the princess, he said: "I am not pleased that poets should praise me. If they write
poems in praise of the Protector of the State [the Caliph AH] and the immaculate
Imams, on Whom be Peace, then they may expect tobe rewarded by those
saintly souls and, in the second place, by us. When a poet writes in praise of a
king, heeloquently strings together subtle thoughts, exalted notions and
hyperbolical similes which, after the saying what are his best are hislies, seldom
genuinely pertain to the matter in hand. If, however, they are applied to the
Sainted Ones, then they are just, because their holy virtues are even more
exalted". In short, the Maulana received no reward.
Here is conclusive evidence of the attitude of Safavid monarchs towards poets and their offerings in the form of ghazals or panegyrics, an attitude not confined to Shah Tahmasp alone. Hence the development ofelegies and panegyrics on the Imams, notably atthe hands of Muhtasham of Kashan (d. 996/1587-8), the recipient of Tahmasp's disapprobation for temporal poems. He became an adept in this type of poetry, employing an ingenuity which made his elegies {mardst) some of the foremost poetical compositions devoted tothe service ofreligion. The specimens of his verse given in the 19th-century work, Majma' al-fusahd ("Compendium of the Eloquent") of Riza Qull Khan Hidayat, bear witness to the fact that in this genre Muhtasham's verses continued, long after his death, to be regarded as models; intimes not far removed from our own, poets have followed them. One consequence ofShah Tahmasp's and his successors' treatment

SAFAVID PERSIAN POETRY
of poets was themigration of many talented composers of ghazals, masnavls and romances, who withdrew from court circles and inmany instances sought refuge at the Ottoman orMughal courts. Hence the establishment ofcentres ofPersian poetry outside Iran, particularly in India. At the court of the Mughal emperor Akbar (963—1014/15 5 61605) alone there were fifty-one poets in exile from Iran. The style known as theIndian style, which had been first noticeable in late Timurid times, attained its full development inthe Safavid age, when its highest exponents appeared and it enjoyed a great deal of popularity. It remained a model until the end of the Safavid period and was influential in both the Zand and the early part of the Qajar periods. Then itlost its hold and attempts were made to return to older models; though the "Indian" style still survives inIndia and Afghanistan. For the poet using this style the primary objective is the expression, in language as simple as possible, of fine-spun thoughts, unusual, wonder-evoking themes, and a general conjunction ofideas the most conducive to delighted surprise in auditors or readers. The style's history dates to agradual development in the interval between the time of the Mongol Il-Khans and the Timurids during the latter part ofthe 8th/i4th century. It became the fashion during the Timurid period, notably inthe literary circle centred on Herat. Its development canbe attributed to the social conditions ofthe times, which were such that people sought to turn away from thecorporeal world, desiring in preference to it a poetical diet of subtle and fanciful ideas. A second consideration isone to which allusion has already been made, namely the gradual departure of the literary language from old conventions and standards infavour of elements based on the popular idiom. Thus a fusion, at first sight ofa somewhat unexpected nature, was brought about. Poetry became invested toan increasing extent with far-fetched ideas in which great striving was made after the most subtle refinements, and objects, of expression; and yet, at the same time, poetry became almost colloquial in tone. That it was also not infrequently projected into the borderlands of the absurd and worthless must in some measure be attributed to the fact that so extraordinary afusion of stylistic aim and content could not invariably besuccessfully accomplished; especially in circumstances that were in numerous external ways generally adverse to the production of sound literature. Certainly poets in the"Indian" style strove hard to display bright and novel conjunctions, often enough with very considerable ingenuity. But
955



SAFAVID LITERATURE
imaginations almost as often proved to have been over-teased, and fancifulness for its own sake allowed totake precedence over strength of style, the soundness ofsense and a vital grounding to exercisesof the imagination, that lie atthe roots of great poetry. Thus it was that, in sheer exuberance ofartifice, beauty of meaning, where it existed, was sometimes inthe Indian style lost tosight. The name "Indian" was appropriated for this style because those of its partisans who lived in thetime of the Safavid shahs and were adversely affected by their treatment of poets tended principally to settle in India. India and Afghanistan became its home, and the ghazal, the short lyrical piece, its most popular form, because this type of poem lent itself best tothe expression of delicate and novel ideas. More must be said about the attempt made by poets ofthis era to eschew ornamented language and keep close to the language of ordinary people. One result of this was that, certainly if judged by strictly classical criteria, though their verses were often fluent, they often contained colloquialisms even, as has been hinted, to the point of being grammatically incorrect. Perhaps this is not surprising when it is recalled that the aim was ever to introduce novelty; juxtapositions and forms of expression which every effort ofingenuity was stretched to make aswonder-exciting ascould be. This was the process that was carried to the uttermost lengths atthe Ottoman and Mughal courts, to which the divans ofpoets such as Sa'ib ofTabriz were sent as eagerly
sought-after gifts.1 And yet, if only because of this almost filigree content, and overlooking the occasional fallings-off or ineptitudesof diction, contrary to the beliefs of some of our contemporaries itmay be averred that Safavid poetry does not deserve entirely to be dismissed as of no value. Its value lies chiefly inthe very feature that lays it most open to the imputation of decadence: in its bold use of novel forms and original subject-matter. Leaving aside thearea of poetry that may be placed under the heading of the Indian style, the question of subject-matter brings us back to those elegies and panegyrics of the Imams and the Immaculate Ones (i.e. their descendants), which have already been mentioned, and to.consideration of such other subjects asthe poetry ofour period is found to have treated. For example, there were lyrical themes which

were sometimes tinged with mysticism, expressing theaspirations of hermits and dervishes, and this not without anelement ofthe didactic. Also not absent from the period's corpus of poetry were tales and romances, especially in imitation of Nizaml. Throughout the period historical and religious poetry was produced in the epic form, sufficient to make a sizeable contribution to this genre. At thesame time, however, forreasons which the anecdote given above about Shah Tahmasp might make clear, poems in praise ofearthly potentates were few, were inferior in quality to the ghazals or longer pieces dealing with holy personages or spiritual topics, and were generally dedicated to the Timurid sovereigns of India. Before going on to discuss prose works during the Safavid era, it will beuseful here to list the names of some ofthe principal poets and briefly to mention their more outstanding contributions. Many of the poets of the earlier part of the Safavid era hadbeen educated inthe late Timurid period, particularly inthe literary circle of Husain Balqara. One ofthem was Jaml's nephew, 'Abd-Allah Hatifl of Kharjird (d. 927/15 20-1). Oneof his most important works is the Shdh-ndma-jiHa^rat-i Shah Ismfiil, an historical epic. Others of his poetical tales inimitation ofNizaml are Shirinu Khusrau, L.aild u Majnun, Haft man%ar and the Timiir-ndma. The last-mentioned work describes Tlmur's victories and wars asananswer to, or parallel with, Nizaml's hkandar-ndma; thus it too may beclassified asanhistorical epic. Another poet of the beginning of the Safavid era who had been educated during that of the Timurids and in the first years ofSafavid rule was MIrza Qasim of Gunabad, one ofthe sayjidsof that town. He also was an imitator of Nizaml, andhis most important works comprise Laild u Majnun, the Kdr-ndma orChaugdn-ndma, Khusrauu Shirin, Shdhrukhndma, Shdh-ndma-ji mdjj (on the subject of Shah Isma'il), and the Shdh-ndma-yi navvdb 'All (& description ofthe reign of Shah Tahmasp). Another ofthe well-known poets ofthe close ofthe Timurid and the beginning of the Safavid age was Baba FighanI, who died in 925/1519—20 and was celebrated forhis graceful ghazals. He was one of the greatest poetic innovators of the ensuing age. A contemporary of his was Umldl TihranI (d. 925/1519—20), who wrote excellent ghazals and qasldas. This group of poets also included Ahll of Turshlz (d. 934/ 1527-8) and hisnamesake of Shlraz (d. 942/1535—6). The latter wrote fine qasldas andan artificial masnavl entitled the Sihr-i Haldl. Hilali Chaghata'I, who was put to death in 935/1528-9, wrote melodious and
957



SAFAVID LITERATURE
tasteful ghazals at the beginning ofthe ioth/i6th century. Besides his passionate ghazals he was the author of three masnavis entitled L,aild u
Majniin, Shah u darvish1 and Sifat al-'ashiqin ("The Attributes of Lovers"). Another ofthe great poets ofthe early part ofthe Safavid era was VahshI (d. 991/1583-4) of Bafq, a dependency of Kirman: hewas a contemporary of Shah Tahmasp, in whose honour he composed qasldas. His ghazals were celebrated for the beauty of their style and their fine
sentiments. Furthermore, his short tarktb-bands,2 besides being newin Persian literature, are noteworthy for beauty and freshness and strong feeling. His unfinished masnavl entitled Farhdd u Shirin, particularly its introduction, was much admired by later poets. Itwas completed in the Qajar period by Visal of Shlraz in1265/1848—9. A contemporary of VahshI was thepoet Muhtasham of Kashan (d. 996/1587-8), whose importance asa writer ofelegies has already been mentioned. He also composed qasldas and ghazals, but one of the greatest of all thewriters of ghazals of this age was Jamil al-Dln Muhammad b. Badr al-Dln ShlrazI (b. 964/1556-7, d. 999/1590-1), whose pen-name was 'Urfl. His fame spread in Safavid times through India and Turkey. Inaddition tobeautiful ghazals inthe Indian style, he composed some qasldas and masnavis in imitation of Nizaml. Another outstanding writer of Persian poetry in the Safavid era, though not a Persian, was Faizl-yi FayyizI (b. 954/1547—8, d. 1004/1595—6), thebrother of Akbar's minister Abu'1-Fazl. Like 'Urfl, he achieved considerable fame during hislifetime and was a master of the qaslda, ghazal and masnavl. Among his well-known masnavis, which were written in imitation of those of Nizaml, must be mentioned the Marka^-i advar, Sulaimdnu Bilqis, Nd/ u Daman, Haft kishvar and the Akbar-nama.
Other poets of this time were: SahabI of Astarabad (d. 1010/1601—2), Nazlrl of Nlshapur (d. 1021/1612—3), the author of qasldas, ghazals and tarjTdt, Zuhtirl ofTurshlz (d. 1024/1615—6), Zalall of Khwansar (d. inthe same year as Zuhurl) and Talib Amull (d. 1036/1626-7). The lastnamed was poet laureate to theMughal emperor Jahangir and author of several celebrated ghazals and qasldas. Also tobe included among the poets was Shaikh Baha' al-Dln Muhammad 'Amill, otherwise celebrated asa man of learning; he died in 1031/1622. His cele

brated masnavls, the Savdnih-i Hi/d%, better known as Nanu halvd ("Bread and Sweetmeats"), and the Shir ushakar ("Milk andSugar"), are both mystical and didactic in character. Mention must also be made of Hakim Sharaf al-Dln Hasan (d. 1038/1628—9). A court physician and boon companion to Shah 'Abbas I, he was theauthor of ghazals and also of a masnavl entitled Namakddn-ihaqtqat ("The Salt-cellar ofTruth"), written inimitationof SanaTs Hadiqatal-haqiqat. Abu'l-Qasim FindiriskI, one of the philosophers of the Safavid period, was the author of some philosophical poems; hedied about 1050/1640-1. Later there appeared Abu Talibof Kashan, poet laureate to Shah Jahan, and animitator of 'Urfl, greatly skilled in theIndian style. In addition to hiswell-known collection of ghazals, hewas the author of the Zafar-ndma-yi Shah Jabdni. He died in Kashmir in1061/1650—1. A poet who brought the Indian style to perfection was Muhammad 'All Sa'ib-i Tabrlzl (b. 1010/1601—2, d. 1088/1677-8). Even during his lifetime hisfame spread through India, Persia andTurkey. Hewas a prolific poet: thenumber of verses in hisDivan amounts to 120,000. His ghazals are noteworthy forthe sureness of touch that they evince, the subtlety ofideas and, interestingly, the popular proverbs which are worked into them. As Sa'ib had made athorough study ofthe worksof his predecessors, his wording resembles theirs more than do the poems of any of his contemporaries. Another poet to be mentioned here is Shaikh 'All Hazln (d. 1180/ 1766—7). In addition to his verses he wasthe author of two prose works, the Ta^kirat al-ahvdl and the Tavjzirat al-mu'dsirln.
Among the writers of epics in the 11 th/17th century was Qadrl with his two historical epics, the Jariin-ndma and the Jang-ndma-yi Kishm; these were completed in, respectively, 1031/1621—2 and the following year, the Jang-ndma-yi Kishm being the history of the year 1032/1622, when the Persian forces, with the assistance of the shipping of the East India Company, drove the Portuguese out of the islands of Kishm and Hurmuz. In 985/1577—8 Bihishtl Maskiikl, another poet of this period, completed his Shdh-ndma-yi Bihishtton thesubject of the wars between the Turkish Sultan Murad III andMuhammad Khudabanda, the Safavid sovereign. With verse annals of this type may becompared the Futiih al-'Ajam of Jamall b. Hasan Shushtarl, an account of the capture of Tabriz by 'Osman Pasha in 996/1587—8. Mulla Kami of Shlraz com

of the closing years of Nur al-Dln Muhammad Jahanglr and hiswars with his enemies, in1030/1620-1. Similarly, inthis species ofpoetry celebrating contemporary military events, another poet named Bihishtl composed the Ashub-ndma-yi Hindustan onthe wars between the sons of Jahanglr, that is, the events of the years 1067 to 1069/1656—7 to 1658—9. Of a different kind was the poetry of Mlrza Muhammad Raf I' Khan Bazil ofMashhad, acontemporary of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. He died in 1123 or 1124/1710-1 or 1712-3, and composed a religious poem called the Hamk-yi Haidart, completed by Mlrza Abu Talib FindiriskI after his death. These are the outstanding poets of the Safavid epoch. In addition there were many others, in Persia, India and at the Ottoman court. Each ofthem endeavoured tocomplete adivan orcollection ofpoems, but byand large their works lack merit.
PERSIAN PROSE IN THE SAFAVID PERIOD
In the Safavid period Persian prose did notattain a high position as literature, despite its widespread use and popularity inPersia, India and Turkey. Although a large number of works were written during this period onmany topics, itwas not anoutstanding one, because mostof the writers cared little for style orfor linguistic and rhetorical points. On thewhole, theprose works of this period, inparticular those of a literary character, have little tocommend them. Ifthe authors endeavoured tobe simple, they tended toemploy vulgar expressions; and if, on the other hand, they tried to beartificial and ornate, they employed tasteless artifices. The works which represent a compromise between these twoextremes, such as the 'Alam-drd-yi 'Abbdsi, are few and of little value. Onthe whole, Safavid prose is even more loose and superficial than that ofthe Timurid era; Safavid works areso full of empty titles, compliments and rhyming words that the original subject becomes lost orunintelligible. This state ofaffairs was even worsein the case of writers in the Indian style. Because of their tendency to pedantry more attention was paid toelaborations and superfluities than to subject-matter. In some historical books andtales an intermediate style was adopted, but even insuch cases of plain writing the corrupt language ofthe period sometimes left its mark. A feature ofthe age deserving attention was the writing ofromances
960



SAFAVID PERSIAN PROSE
in prose. Wehave knowledge of prose romances in Persian dating from an earlier age than that of the Safavids, such as the Ddstdn-i hkandar (this work is to be distinguished from the Iskandar-ndma, written in a beautiful style in the jth/i ith century), the Bakbtiydr-ndma,
the Nuh man^ar, theAbu Muslim-ndma, the Ddrdb-ndma, the Ddstdn-i Samak-i 'Ayjdr, the Husn udil, and a number of others.
In the Safavid period the writing ofromance became more common, and some important works were written such as the above-mentioned
Ddstdn-i hkandar, the Tiiti-ndma, the Ra%m-ndma, the translations of the famous Indian epics the Rdmaydfia and the Mahdbhardta, the tales of the Ha^ar Gisii, the Tdlib-i pddishdh-^dda u Mat/ub, the Qissa-ji Arshad u Rashid,Ashraf u Firii^ va%ir-%dda, the Shtrtn-ndma, the Qissa-yi chahdr darvtsh,the Niish Afarin-ndma, the Qissa-yi Maryam dukhtar-i Shdb-i Purtugdl, the Qissa-yi haft sair-i Hdtim-i Td'i, and others. Some of these romances arewritten in a simple andagreeable style, particularly the translation of the Rdmaydna by Naqib Khan and 'Abd al-Qadir Bada'unI, carried out with skill and care ina fluent and attractive form. From the letter-writers of this period, whether working at the Safavid court or for the Mughal emperors of India and Indian nobles, highly ornate examples of epistolatory style have come down to us. One of the greatest of these practitioners of the secretary's art was MIrza Tahir Vahid of Qazvln (d. 1120/1708—9). Hewas secretaryand historiographer to Shah 'Abbas II and the vizier of Shah Sulaiman.He wrote a number of letters, in some of which hepainstakingly endeavoured to exclude Arabic words and to use Persian ones instead. MIrza Vahid was also a poet in the Indian style. Other prose works of the period were the Habtb al-siyar by Ghiyas al-Dln Khwand Amir, who died in 941/15 34-5 and wasoneof the historians of the close of the Timurid period and the beginning of the succeeding one; his book comes down to the closing years of the reign of Shah Isma'Il. The Ta%kirat-i Shah Tahmasp-i Safaviis the autobiography of Shah Tahmasp, the son of Shah Isma'Il and ruler of Iran from 930/15 24 to 984/15 76. His reign isalso covered byHasan Beg Rumlu's Ahsan al-tavdrikh. The Alam-drd-yi Abbdsi, by Iskandar Beg MunshI, the secretary of Shah 'Abbas the Great, relates events up tothe close of that shah's life, that is, from 958/1577 to 1038/1629, and, among the prose works ofthe Safavid era, isnoted forthe beauty ofits style. The Bahdr-i ddnish, which isa revised version ofthe Kalilava Dimna, was writtenby Akbar's minister, Abu'1-Fazl, who was murdered in 1011/1602. He was
961



SAFAVID LITERATURE
also the author ofother books such asthe Akbar-ndma covering the reign ofthat sovereign, and the A'in-i Akbari.
The Hasht bihisht and the Tdrikh-i Al-i 'Usmdn were written by Maulana Idrls of BitUs, acontemporary of Sultan Bayezld II (886/1481918/1512), and his son Abu'1-Fazl Muhammad al-Daftarl. The Tdrikh-i Al-i'Usmdn includes some of the events of the reign of Sultan Selim II. The Majdlis al-mtfminin by QazI Nur-Allah of Shushtar (d. 1019/ 1610—1) contains the biographies of many Shl'I poets and scholars. Among the products worthy of interest in the literary history of this period are the biographies of poets. One of these is the Tuhfa-yi Sdmiol Sam MIrza, the son ofShah Isma'Il, a work containing the lives of a number of poets from the close of the 9th/15 th to theend of the ioth/i6th centuries. Another is the L.atd'if-ndma, a translation by Fakhri b. Amlrl of Mir 'All Shir Nava'I's Majdlis al-nafd'iswhich he completed in 9 2 7/15 20-1; another famous work by him is the Ta%kirat al-nisd which is also known asthe Javdhir al-'ajd'ib. There is also the Mu^akkir al-ahbdb byNisari of Bukhara, which contains the biographies of the poets of the era of Mir 'All Shir Nava'I up to the year 974/1566—7. Similarly, the Nafd'is al-ma'dsir is abiographical survey of the Persian poets who lived in India during the time of Akbar. Furthermore, there is the Khuldsat al-ash'dr va %ubdat al-afkdr, which TaqI al-Dln KashanI completed in986/1577—8. Among the important collections of biographies ofpoets is the Ta^kirat-i Haft iqlim of Amin Ahmad RazI, which was completed towards thebeginning of the nth/17th century. We may conclude this list with the Riyd% al-shu'ard by 'All Quli Khan Valih-i Daghistanl, written in the 12th/18th century. Another feature ofthe literature of the Safavid period was lexicography. Besides the general need in India forsuch works, there was the specialised interest taken by Abu'1-Fazl, Akbar's minister, in the eloquent writing of Persian and in fostering a return to the use of the Indian style of the old writers. Such an interest necessitated a good knowledge of the use and shades of meaning of Persian words. The compilation of dictionaries was encouraged. It is clear that before Abu'l-FazPs time compilation of dictionaries had received occasional attention, though few were produced. Among the important dictionaries which appeared in India after the time of Abu'1-Fazl, and which certainly deserve notice are, in the first place, the Farhang-iJahdngiriby Jamal al-Dln Husain Tnju, who lived at the court of Akbar and his son Jahanglr, and finished this dictionary in 1014/1605—6, dedicating it to Jahanglr, whence its title.
962



SAFAVID PERSIAN PROSE
Prior to the compilation of the Farhang-i Jdhdngtri, Muhammad Qasim Sururi had completed his Persian dictionary in Iran in 1008/1599-1600 and had dedicated it to Shah 'Abbas. Among other dictionaries compiled in India there is the Farhang-i Rashidi by 'Abd al-Rashld al-Husainl, who was a contemporary of Aurangzlb. This work is one of the most valuable Persian dictionaries and was completed in 1064/165 3-4. Yet another of these works is the Ghiyds al-lughat by Muhammad Ghiyas al-Din, completed in the year 1242/1826—7. Besides these, other dictionaries were compiled inIndia, such as the Mu'ayjid al-fu^ald by Muhammad Lad ofDelhi, the Bahdr-i 'Ajam, and the Chirdgb-i hiddyat. Although it is not necessary to describe them all here, one, the Burhdn-i qdti', must briefly be mentioned. Muhammad Husain b. Khalaf of Tabriz, who took the penname "Burhan", compiled this work inIndia in 1062/1651—2. Sinceit contains many words and is fuller than other Persian dictionaries, ithas been reprinted a number of times. A serious fault inthese dictionaries isthat the words have not asa rule been arranged in a careful manner, so that they often lack value as works ofscholarship; and inmany cases it has happened that through the misreading ofArabic, Turkish or Persian words, new words have been evolved. Another development which was a grave misfortune for the language and history of Persia was the appearance of some spurious books inAkbar's time such as the Dasdtir, the Sbdristdn and the A'in-i Hushang, all ofwhich claimed tohave a number ofpure Persian words as well as material on the ancient history of the country. Such forgeries brought into existence a number of words of bogus origin and root such as parkhida, aparkhtda, farniidsdr, samrdd, etc. Nevertheless, these coined words were inserted in Persian dictionaries asgenuine Persian words and naively employed bythe writers of "pure Persian" in the Qajar and modern periods. It was unfortunate that the information contained inthese books was used inworks of the Qajar period on the ancient history ofPersia and regarded as credible. During the Safavid eramany scientific andreligious books were written of which some must bementioned, beginning with commentaries on theQur'an. 'All b. Husain of Zavara, a well-known Shl'I theologian and a contemporary of Shah Tahmasp, completed in 946/1539—40 his Tarjumat al-Khavds,which was also known as the Tafsfr-i Zavdrt. Hefurther produced many translations into Persian,
963



SAFAVID LITERATURE
notably that ofthe Sbarh Nahj al-balagha under the title ofthe Kau^at al-anvdr; Tabarsl's Makdrim al-akhldq, entitled Makarim al-kard'im; the Ytiqdddt of Shaikh Saduq, entitled the Vasilat al-najdt; Ibn Taus's Tard'if, entitled the Jardvat al-lata'if;and the Majma' al-hudd, which was known as the Qisas al-anbiyd, as well as anumber of others. There is also the Khuldsat al-minhaj which is a Persian commentary on the Qur'an by Mulla Fath-Allah of Kashan, apupil of'All b. Husain of Zavara. Healso wrote in Persian a number of other books on
religion, such as the Minhajal-sddiqin fi il^dm al-mukbdlifin, which is a commentary onthe Qur'an in five volumes and ofwhich the abovementioned Khuldsatal-minhaj is anabridgement. He was likewise the author of the TanbTh al-ghdfilin and theTa^kirat al-'drifin, the latter work being a commentary in Persian on the Nahj al-baldgha. Shaikh Baha' al-Dln Muhammad b. Husain 'Amili, who was a contemporary of Shah 'Abbas and who is better known as Shaikh Baha'I, was the author ofthe Jdmi'-yi 'Abbdsi. This is one ofthe most important ofthe Shl'I theological works ofmodern times inPersia; it has been annotated and explained a number oftimes. Since this book was left unfinished because of the author's death, Shah 'Abbas ordered Maulana Nizam al-Dln Muhammad Husain Quraishi of Sava (died some time after 1038/1628—9) tocompleteit. Mulla Muhammad Baqir MajlisI (d. mi/1699—1700) was one of the most influential ofthe theologians of the latter part of the Safavid era. He was Shaikh al-Islam ofPersia during the reigns ofShah Sulaiman (1077-1105/1666-1694) and Shah Sultan Husain (1105-1135/16941722). He wrote many works inPersian and Arabic on Shl'I theology
and ethics such as the Bihar al-anvdr, the Mishkdt al-anvdr, the Mi'rdj al-mu'minin, the Jala'al-'uyiin, the Zddal-ma'dd, the 'Ain al-haydt, and so on. One of the most important works ondialectics in Persian of this period is theKalimdt-i maknuna by Mulla Muhsin-i Faiz of Kashan (d. 1000/1591-2), the pupil and son-in-law of Mulla Sadra. He wrote a number of other books in Persian and Arabic on religious matters. He was also a poet, and Hidayat has estimated the number of the couplets in his Divan atbetween 6,000 and 7,000. Another pupil of Mulla Sadra was 'Abd al-Razzaq b. 'All b. Husain Lahlji, who took the pen-name of Fayyaz and who also wrote on philosophy and dialectics. His most important work is the Gaubar-i murdd, which isa compendium inPersian of religious theories.

CHAPTER I 8
PERSIAN POETRY IN THE TIMURID
AND SAFAVID PERIODS
Politically, this period extended from the death of the last great Tl-Khan (736/1335) to the accession of Nadir Shah (1148—60/173647). It encompassed the rise and fall of two powerful dynasties, the Timurids (771—911/1370—1506) and the Safavids (907—1135/1501 1722), as well as of a number of lesser houses. From a purely literary standpoint the era falls into twophases.The first, comprising roughly a century, was a turbulent period of wars, struggle for power, and widespread destruction, culminating in the sweeping conquests of Timur and ending with his death in 807/1405. Its literature is best considered a continuation of that of the previous period, which witnessed theascendancy of lyrico-mystical poetry (the 'Iraqi school). Beginning in the 12th century, this style reached its zenith with Hafiz in the 14th. The second phase, stretching from the 15 th to about the middle of the 18 th century, maybe said to have begun with the succession of Tlmur's sonShah Rukh in 807/1405 andhislong andrelatively peaceful reign, andcontinued to thefall of the Safavids and therise of Nadir Shah. What marks the division between the two phases is the emergence of a new school, whose style is called the Indian style. This school, which hadits origins in the Timurid period, produced a great deal of Persian poetry, notonly in Persia, butalso in adjacent countries — Ottoman Turkey, Iraq, Central Asia, Afghanistan, and especially India. The appeal of this style continued for Persian poets in these lands long after it hadlost impetus in Persia. It might appear at first sight that this second phase, which occupies a span of two and a half centuries, lacks unity, and therefore cannot be considered as a distinct literary era. This would be an erroneous assumption, based perhaps ondissociating Timurid poetry from that of the Safavids andMughals. In fact thephase represents one of the more coherent andwell-defined periods of Persian literature. Within its span the Indian style developed organically, followed a normal curve within certain limits andconstraints, and finally exhausted itself into a lifeless and forced poetry.
965



PERSIAN POETRY! TIMURID AND SAFAVID PERIODS
The period ended in Persia with the appearance of a group of poets and critics in Isfahan about the middle of the 18th century, whose efforts led tothe Ba^gasht-i adabi ("Literary Revival movement"). The movement sought a return to the simpler and more robust poetryof the oldmasters as against the effete and artificial verse into which Safavid poetry had degenerated. It should beemphasised, however, that whereas the Indian style had aclear end in Persia, ithad no distinct beginning. The transition was gradual and imperceptible, and vestiges of the former style persisted for more than a century. In the following discussion we shall focus our attention chiefly on poetry, since in Persia and the countries which came under its literary influence itwas poetry that until recently was the vehicle par excellence of literary expression. In medieval Persia, literary effort in prose was directed chiefly at the embellishment of informative writing — histories and prefatory materials in particular — by the use of rhetorical devices. Inevitably, this led to florid or bombastic styles of writing, admired by the literati of the time but disdained today. As Persian prose grew more strident and bargained its directness and simplicity for artifice, awriter's literary fame came often to depend on his ability to engage in anexcessive useof metaphors and tropes and to adorn his style with avariety of devices. Of these, the use of rhythm and rhyme (saf), homonymy or alliterative play on words (Jinas),congruence or harmony of images {tanasub ormurd'dt-i na%ir), amphibology or double entendre {ihdm), allusion (talmib), allusive statement (kindyd), antithesis (ta^add), poetic exaggeration (mubalagha) and hyperbole (igbrdq), as well as an inordinate use of unfamiliar Arabic words and pedantic citations, were most frequently in evidence. As aresult, an idea which could be expressed simply and clearly in two lines would be belaboured, in the worst cases, in long and tortuous pages, replete witha plethora oflinguistic jugglings, semantic acrobatics, allusions, tenuous turns of phrase, forced metaphors, and complex tropes. The taste for stylistic exertion of this kind in prose presents aliterary outlook quite different from the one prevalent in the West orcontemporary Persia, and although we may not enjoy the labyrynthine intricacies it often produces, it would be neither objective nor helpful to dismiss the style on the ground that it does not coincide with our own literary taste. We must allow that it is a game which is now seldom played; but aslong as it was in vogue it excited wonder and literary admiration. As we shall see, the kind of taste that produced this turgid prose was not inactive in poetry either.
966



PERSIAN POETRY: TIMURID AND SAFAVID PERIODS
Imaginative prose literature, in the sense commonly understood in the West, was scarce in medieval Persia, novels, short stories, and plays being alien to Persian literary tradition. Where imaginative prose did exist, however, such asin satire and folk epics, sensible, unburdened prose was often used. Imaginative verse, onthe other hand, had a wide scope, and comprised not only amorous and mystical poetry, but also panegyric, epic, and didactic genres. Fiction normally employed verse, but themasnavi (couplet) form which was used for narrative poetry was the vehicle of other genres as well. During the period under discussion a large number ofmasnavis were written, principally in imitation of the 12thcentury master NizamI, or the 13th-century Persian poet of India, Khusrau Dihlavl, or occasionally after Sa'di's Biistdn.They comprise narrative, mystical and ethical works. The qaslda, a monorhyme normally between some twenty-five and seventy lines, but occasionally extended to more than twice that length, continued to be written during the whole period, although with diminishing importance. It is used chiefly for panegyrics. A good deal of qasldas were written by court poets in praise of the Timurid, Turkmen, and Shaibanid princes, and of the Mughal emperors and their grandees. From the 14th century we find also a considerable amount of poetry written in praise of the Shi'I Imams. Among the chief Shi'I poets of the Timurid period were Khwaju KirmanI (d. 753/135 2), Salman Savajl (d. 778/1376), Lutf-Allah Nlshapurl (d. 812/1409), Tsmat Bukhara'I (d. 829/1425-6), Ni'mat-Allah Vail (d. 834/1431), Amir Shahl (d. 857/1453), Ibn Husam (d. 875/1470), FighanI (d. 925/1519), and Ahli ShlrazI (d. 942/1535). The pride of place, however, belongs to the gha%al, which was written in abundance, overshadowing all other forms of poetry. A short monorhyme of some six to fourteen lines, the ghazal was the basic form and major vehicle oflyric poetry. It was ghazals which served asthe main field where poets exhibited their true talent; it isby their ghazals that they are chiefly known. It is in the context of this form that the
Indian style isdiscussed, and on it that this chapter is focused.1
1 Prose literature ofthe period has been dealt with inthe previous chapters, where a chronological survey ofits writers and poets is given. Hafiz is likewise treated separately in anearlier chapter.
967



PERSIAN POETRY: TIMURID AND SAFAVID PERIODS
POETRY OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
This period must be considered a brilliant one inPersian letters, if for no other reason than having Hafiz (d. 791/1389), the most celebrated lyric poet of Persia, as its pre-eminent figure. The interest of the period is not, however, confined to the figure of Hafiz. To this century belongs also the most delightful satirist ofPersia, 'Ubaid-Allah ZakanI (d. c. 772/1371), whose witty satires and facetiae in prose and verse have delighted generations of readers. The period also boasts a poet, Ibn Yamln FaryumadI (d. 769/1368), who is generally considered the most skilful writer of occasional poems (qita'as, "fragments"). The other luminaries ofthe period are the versatile Khwaju ofKirman; the lyricist 'Imad al-Dln of Kirman (d. 773/1372); thesturdy panegyrist and able lyric-writer Salman Savajl; the writer of tender ghazals, Kamal of Khujand (d. 793 or 803/1391 or 1400); themystical poet MaghribI (d. 809/1407); and Lutf-Allah Nlshapurl, a panegyrist of fluent verse who survived Tlmur by some three years. The diversity and rivalry oflocal dynasties which sprang up following theweakening and eventual demise of the Tl-Khans, namelythe Jalayirids in the north and west, the Muzaffarids inthe centre and the south, and the Karts and Sarbadars in Khurasan, provided for court poets a patronage which explains the relative abundance of court poetry during this time. But this isalso the period which witnessed the further spread and increasing popularity of the ghazal. Some of the poets, despite their attachment to one court or another, have written mainly ghazals (Hafiz and 'Imad), and the divanof MaghribI consists only ofghazals. Khwaju is, however, amore representative poet of his period. He wrote engaging lyrico-mystical ghazals, panegyrics in praise of his patrons, and a khamsa (quintet) in masnavl form, aswell as qasldas ina mystical vein and panegyrics ofShl'I Imams. In the ghazal these poets follow the. norms set bySa'dl, RumI, and 'Iraqi in the previous century. In narrative poetry, however, NizamI remains the main model. Inqaslda, again, they follow the 13th-century trend, with Zahlr FaryabI, Anvarl, and KhaqanI serving as frequent models. Apart from the towering figure ofHafiz, the poets ofthe 14th century never reached theheights attained by thetwo 13th-century masters, Sa'dl and RumI. The poetry of the period is generally competent, smooth, melodious, and well-phrased.
968



POETRY OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
The Golden age of satire
Several aspects of this literature call for comment. The first is that this is the golden period of Persian satire. Neither before nor since has Persia produced any satirist comparable to'Ubaid or Hafiz. 'Ubaid isa forthright satirist using notonly mockery, irony, and sarcasm, butalso ribaldry - without shunning obscenity - in order to expose and ridicule the corruption, injustice, bigotry, and hypocrisy ofhis times. Human foibles, vanity and stupidity are other targets of his satires and parodies. He often uses the device ofwriting scandalous parallels tothe serious works of old masters. His best known work, the A.khlaqal-ashraf ("The Virtues of the Nobles"), consists of short essays on various virtues, such as justice, chastity, and generosity. In the preamble of each essayhe explains the meanings accorded these virtues informer times and then the interpretation offered by contemporary men of standing - all travesties of the original meanings. He illustrates these travesties with satirical and humorous anecdotes written in amost engaging mock-serious style. His prose is exemplary inits succinctness and elegance. Hafiz is in a sense themost accomplished satirist that Persiahas produced. His isnot the bitter satire of an aggressive or vengeful critic, but rather the subtle yet penetrating satire of a broadminded poet. Ifthis aspect of his work is less frequently discussed, itis only because itis often overshadowed by hislyrical and philosophical thought. Nonetheless, satire is a major element of Hafiz's poetry and has promoted his popularity more than is generally acknowledged. His satires come in small vignettes, in a hemistich ora line ortwo, inthe body ofhis ghazals. He does not belabour his point, but delivers it succinctly with apt words and fitting images. His humour is dry compared to that of'Ubaid. Whereas 'Ubaid aims at laughter, Hafiz provokes asmile. Both mean to alert, subvert, and educate. The scope ofHafiz's satire is, however, limited; it is generally directed only against the falsehood and hypocrisy ofthe establishment, both clerical and sufistic. Characters like the qadi(judge), mufti, shaikh, faqih (doctor of religious law), muhtasib (inspector of public morality) and sufl are frequent targets ofhis mockery and sarcasm.
Mystical poetry
Another aspect of the poetry of the period is its increasing involvement with mystical ideas and images. 'Attar, Ruml, 'Iraqi, Shabistarl, and
969



PERSIAN POETRY: TIMURID AND SAFAVID PERIODS
AuhadI, all ofthe 13 th century, popularised mystical ideas in poetry, while Nizami's Makh^an al-asrarand Sa'dl's Bustanset anexampleof ethical poems coloured by sufl attitudes and precepts. In Timurid times the spread of sufism continued and sufl ptrs (spiritual leaders) and their khanaqahs (sufl hospices), often supported by the wealthy or the powerful, could be seen everywhere. Among the poets ofthis period many were avowed sufls. The mystical poetry of the 14th and 15 th centuries ranges from poems devoted entirely to expounding sufl ideas, through those in which a mystical thought appears here and there, to those which may only by an effort be made to bear amystical interpretation. Expressly sufl poetry is found mostly inthe divans ofMaghribI, Kamal Khujandl and, in the 15 th century, Ni'mat-Allah Valland Qasim al-Anvar (d. 837/1433), all of whom had attained a leading position in mystical orders. Their ghazals of this kind are generally abstract, dry, and sprinkled with technical sufl terms. The chief— almost the sole — theme of these poems is the mystical pantheism and related ideas which were invogue. They speak of the emanation of the One in the plurality of our world, the priority of existence {wujiid) over the quiddities {mdhiyjdt), and the basic unity of all creation despite appearances, particularly in transcendence of opposites such as lover and beloved, worshipper and worshipped, the hidden and the apparent, the praising and the praised, the drunk and the sober, Moses and Pharaoh, the mote and the sun, etc. Some ghazals of this kind assume an ecstatic tone and bring to mind the rapturous utterances (shathiyyaty of the mystics. They are attractive and enjoyable, if not through a clear appreciation oftheir meanings, at least through their lively rhythms. The commoner "mystical" ghazals wrap sufl thought in erotic language, or else are love poems in which the poet includes lines
of either direct oroblique mystical sentiments.2 It is from this period that mystical interpretation of lyric poems began to become an obsession and made people look for a hidden
meaning behind every image.3 Even up to our own day dictionaries are compiled which provide esoteric sufistic meanings for the most innocent words and images.
1 Utterances made in a state of ecstasy, sometimes seemingly blasphemous, such as identifying oneself with the divinity.
2 See Yarshater, Sbfr-i Farsi, pp. 162 ff., for examples of the varieties of mystical poems.
3 Mulla Muhsin Faiz, a firm akbbdri scholar, has written a treatise, Gul^ar-iQuds, inwhich he explains the mystical meaning ofthe images in his ghazals; see his Divan (Tehran, n.d. [i960]), pp. 11, 18ff.

POETRY OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
Norms and conventions of lyric poetry
Here we may pause a moment toexamine the norms and conventions of the large body oflyric poetry written inthe 14th century. They are also applicable tothe second phase ofthe period under discussion. Whereas in narrative poetry the poet writes about others, in amorous ghazals heinvariably writes about himself and sings of his own love (generally in the first person singular or plural). The main motifs of love lyrics are two: the paramount beauty of the beloved and the cherished sufferings ofthe lover. The pleasure of union is hardly ever the lover's share. Friend and foe blame him, mock him, or pity him for having embarked on ahopeless course that brings him nothing but pain and sorrow; the guard(s) of the beloved turned rival(s)(raqib) chase him asa presumptuous nuisance, and "wise" philistines waste their advice on him. He is disconsolate. Hesees visions of his own consuming passion in themoth which throws itself into the candle flame, and inthe enraptured nightingale that pours out its heart tothe inconstant rose. The black spot in the heart of the tulip reminds him of the brand oflove on his own bleeding heart, the stars share his sleepless nights of separation. The sunseems never to rise and end his interminable vigils. His sorrows are legion and his tears fall in torrents. Proud, arrogant, and fully aware of her (or, rather, his - see below) beauty, the beloved isimpervious to the lover's supplications and his protestations of love and devotion. If she notices him at all, it is to humble him and inflict new wounds on him. The lover accepts all this humiliation, and more, as a token of his true, unfailing love. In his distracted passion, he is almost unaware of his wounds, hovering around her house or street, suffering the insults of his rivals, and continuing to sing her praise. To him her beauty is the marvel of the whole universe. Nonoble cypress tree (sarv-i d^ad) was ever more graceful than her figure, nogazelle walked more gracefully than she. Her lips put the reddest ofrubies toshame, and her languishing {mast, literally "intoxicated"), melting (bimar, literally "ailing") eyes, framed by the darts of her eyelashes, wreak havoc with the hearts of her lovers. With cheeks like rose-petals, night-like hair surrounding the sun of her face, and a waist as narrow as a hair's breadth, she goes about piercing lovers' hearts with the arrow ofher glance. In the chains ofher curls are fettered athousand captive hearts. Ifonly she would deign to casta favourable glance at her lover, he would not only give up all

possessions, but also his faith {din) and his life (Jan). Perhaps in no other literature isso masochistic a picture of the lover and so haughty and cruel a portrait of the beloved presented.
Love enthroned
Resigned to the exigencies of love and to his destiny, the poet has ended up by worshipping notonly thebeloved, butalso thesorrow and suffering of love. Heboasts of them andis jealous of them. His complete and selfless devotion has led, one might say, to love's apotheosis. Love reigns supreme inPersian lyrics. It is celebrated in a halflyrical, half-mystical manner, not only as the almighty sovereign of all
existence but also asits cause and purpose.1 The great emphasis that the mystics placed on love as the sole means of attaining the Truth and the only path to the knowledge of the divine no doubt played apart in raising the station oflove tosuch heights. Reason ('aqf), on the other hand, isconstantly denigrated and declared impotent. The opposition between the two supplies the lyrics with one of their fertile themes.
Abstractness of the beloved
Descriptions of the beloved are neither detailed nor generally aimedat portraiture. She isdescribed in general terms and idealised as a matchless paragon of beauty. Furthermore, her description is selective. Whereas the nose, the hands, and the feet are hardly ever mentioned, the dimple on the chin andthe beauty spot {khat) are frequently described. In addition to these, description of the beloved is usually confined to the hair, also the lock and curls, the face, the cheeks, the eyebrows, the eyes, the eyelashes, the bundgiisb (part of the neck and face just below the ear), the lips, the mouth, the budding moustache and beard (see below), the waist, the figure, the gait, the look,the glance, the smile, and less frequently, the forehead, the teeth, the arms and the legs {sdq).These are described as a rule individually, without any attempt at giving an impression of the actual person of the beloved. Almost all such descriptions are variations on basic conventional metaphors. As aresult, the reader, rather than getting a concrete
1 The sufls regarded the following tradition of the Prophet as the fountainhead of their beliefs: "I was a hidden treasure; then I wished to beknown; I created the creation so asto become known." Recognition of the divine, they maintained, was possible only through love.

POETRY OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
picture of the beloved, receives anabstract image of her — animage that can fit any fancy. In Persian lyrics the beloved is a personalised concept, not a person. As an individual she remains unknown. This is true also ofthe other characters who populate the lyrics — the Rival, the Blamer, the Muhtasib, the Zdhid (sanctimonious ascetic), the Ndsih (complacent counsellor), the Rind (ruffian), etc. Here it may be mentioned also that inPersian lyrics many concepts such as sorrow (gham), patience (sabr),separation (firdq),and of course, love {'ishq) and reason, as well as the heart {dit) and the eye (dtda),are personified and treated assuch, to the point that with a twist a poet, Jalal Aslr, can curse his heart for having gone after the beloved with
out his knowledge and having become his rival!1
The beloved is not a woman
Thus far I have referred tothe beloved as a woman inorder to avoid confusion. It should be explained, however, that, as a rule, the beloved
is not a woman, but a young man.2 In the early centuries ofIslam, the raids into Central Asia produced many young slaves. Slaves were also bought orreceived as gifts. They were often made toserve as pagesat court or in the households of the affluent, or as soldiers and bodyguards. Young men, slaves or not, also served wine at banquets and receptions, and the more gifted among them could play music and maintain a cultivated conversation. It was love towards young pages, soldiers, or novices intrades and professions which was the subject of lyrical introductions to panegyrics from the beginning of Persian poetry, and of the ghazal. A common theme in alltraditional lyrical poetry is the description ofthe khatt-i nau, hair growing on the lipor face of the adolescent beloved, likened commonly to new shoots of grass. Many of the metaphors used in the description of the beloved reflected theattitude of a reluctant young man importuned by the
amorous advances of his own sex.3 His carrying ofarms - particularly
sword ifigh, shamshtr), dagger (khanjar), bow (kamdri) and arrow {fir, khadang) - and his engaging inbouts ofdrinking are also indicative of
1 "O heart, what were you doing in the street of my beloved?/May you bleed, have you too become my rival?": JahanbanI, p. 15;.
2 Expressions of heterosexual love are not entirely absent from classical Persian poetry, as shown byoccasional descriptions of the breast. The most common conventional metaphorical images for it are the pomegranate, the lemon, and the polo ball (guy)

his sex. The following famous lines of Hafiz give an idea of the kind of epithets that can be used for him:
Hair dishevelled, sweating, laughter on his lips, and drunk, His shirt open in front, singing ghazals, and a jug of wine in hand, His narcissus-like eyes eagerfora brawl, and mockery on his lips,
He came to me in the middle of the night and sat by my side.1
Shah Muhammad Qazvlnl, in his translation (completed in 929/15 23) of Mir 'All Shir's Majdlisal-nafd'is, adds to the notice on Katibi of Turshlz (d. 839/1435—6) that "Katibi was enamoured of a youth [pisar], as is the
wont ofthose cities."2 This Katibi, a prolific and accomplished poet, when speaking ofan example ofperfect love in his masnavl Tajnisdt, does notdelay in describing the "charming khatt on the lipof the beloved". Majdlis al-'ushshdq (written in 908/1502 and attributed to Husain Balqara, the famous Timurid patron ofthe arts and literature,
but in fact composed by a sufl inhis entourage, Husain Gazurgahl)3 consists ofthe stories ofthe love affairs ofpoets, mystics, and saints, beginning with the Sixth Shl'I Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq. Even though not much credence can be attached tothem, these stories' only subject is a homosexual love which somehow led in the end to the love of the divine. In one ofthe better known verse romances ofthe century, the Guy u chaugdn of 'Arifl of Herat (d. 853/1449), the subject ofthe narrative is again the love of a poor man (darvish) towards a young, handsome
prince. Lutf-Allah Nlshapurl has a ghazal, the radif4 ofwhich is the word pisar, and Katibi in a ghazal has the following line:
My sweetheart, you ought not to be less than a woman in faithfulness Potiphar's wife gave up her life but not Joseph's care.
It is only by bearing this circumstance in mind that some ofthe conventions and images of Persian lyrics can be understood. How else can one appreciate the following lines of Amir Humayun of Isfara'in (1 jth century)?
He was approaching, drunk, with his hat awry and his skirt rolled-up... Showing modesty to everyone else, but as soon as seeing me
Furrowing his brow and reaching for his dagger.5

POETRY OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
What has been said about the ghazal is equally true of the romance, the quatrain, and lyric introductions toqasldas. The impression should be avoided, however, that Persian lyrics are mere maudlin poems populated by dipsomaniac lovers bent on selfmortification and byirritable, obstreperous youths threatening their wretched lovers with daggers and swords. Our intention istoexplain, for the sake of a better appreciation, some less usual aspects of this otherwise sensitive, humane, melodious, and aesthetically superb poetry.
Wine and intoxication
In his sad plight, the lover finds solace inthe liberating intoxication of wine (mai, bdda, shardb).For hisloneliness, the excruciating pain of love, and the afflictions of a fickle world, wine is a panacaea. It frees him from the cares oflife, from himself, from the cant of hypocrites and the "wisdom" of philistines. Wine and intoxication (mast?) are only second to love as major themes of the ghazal. The two themesare brought together inthe person of the saki (sdqt,"wine server") who is often the subject of the poet's longings and isgenerally identified with the beloved. Poets of the Timurid andSafavid periods wrote, in addition to ghazals, poems incouplet form called sdqi-ndma, in which the charms of the saki, the miraculous qualities of wine, and intoxication as the antidote to the transience of life and the perfidy of destiny, are extolled. 'Abd al-Nabl of Qazvln, a poet and anthologist of the 12th/18th century, hascompiled a whole tasjzira, or collection of notices on poets, devoted tothe writers ofsaql-namas. The great majority ofthe seventy-one poets and their saqi-namas mentioned belong to the Timurid and the first half of the Safavid periods. The best known is that ofHafiz.
Cult ofthe tavern as a symbol of social protest
Taverns {maikada, maikhand) were run by Magians, since Muslims were not permitted such anoccupation. In their esteem forthis honoured calling, the ghazal writers dubbed the tavern-keeper ptr-i mughan ("Magian mentor"), with broad allusions to sufl pirs. In a spirit of defiance andchallenge, the poets treat the Pir-i Mughan with the
975



PERSIAN POETRY: TIMURID AND SAFAVID PERIODS
veneration accorded to sages and saints, and pay thetavern all the homage reseved for holy places. It is often called the Ka'ba or the khanaqah ofthe lovers. Not tothe mosque but tothe tavern would a lover go for worship; not the hands of a shaikh, but the rim of the cup would he kiss; and not to a wooden ascetic but to the saintly tavernkeeper would he listen. This cult of the tavern which pervades the lyric poetry of the period is in essence a symbol of protest ofliberal minds against the heartless restrictions and crippling constraints of the socio-religious order. It hurls defiance at bigotry and cant. The poets go still a step further in their nonconformist attitude andassociate themselves also with kharabat ("ruins"), that is to say ramshackle and disreputable places where wine and drugs could be had by the dregs ofsociety. Kharabat are now exalted as theMecca of the lovers, andthe company of
bohemians, blackguards, and ruffians (theqalandarsand rinds)1is cherished. In a nihilistic mood, the poet professes to care not a whit about his good name, regrets the times hehas ever been sober, and admires the sincerity of the open-hearted drunkards and the free spirit of the kharabat population. He delights in the flouting of socioreligious conventions. His deeply felt antagonism towards the representatives ofthe establishment isseen not only inhis forcefully advocating an anticulture, but also in statements which smack of sacrilege or blasphemy. He pawns his turban and his sufl cloak (khirqd) to buy wine; he taints his prayer-rug with wine as an act of piety, and advises the people ofthe madrasa to wash off their books in wine; he chooses the arch of the beloved's eyebrows ashis mihrab(the holy niche in a mosque that the believers face atprayer); he would take wine any time rather than the water of Kauthar in paradise, promised to believers; he would circumambulate the kharabat rather than the Ka'ba in Mecca; he asks tobe washed inwine, which is ritually impure, when he dies. The pleasures of paradise carry little weight with him. To him the threat of doom belies God's avowed mercy. Thus the ghazal became the repository of all sceptical, nonconformist thought. A more liberal atmosphere in Persian writing is hard tofind.

The period is oneof the longest in Persian letters. No conspicuous literary event marks its beginning, butthe forty-two years of the relatively peaceful reign of Shah Rukh islong enough toallow ustonotice the budding of the characteristics of the Indian style. Numerous Timurid princes, like their Turkmen rivals, combined their preocupation with sexandviolence with thecultivation of arts and letters. Prominent among them were Shah Rukh's son Ulugh Beg (d. 853/1449), a remarkable savant himself, who held court in Samarqand during his father's lifetime; Balsunqur, another son ofShah Rukh and anoutstanding calligrapher, who ran his father's realm until his death from excessive drinking in 837/1433; andabove all, Husain b. Mansur b. Baiqara (d. 911/1506), whose court, thanks to the influence ofhis learned vizier, Mir 'All Shir (d. 906/1501), iswell-known for its generous patronage of art and literature. Itsfame is associated with JamI (d. 898/1492), the leading poet, writer, and mystic of the period. The courts of the Qara Quyunlii andAq Quyunlii Turkmens in the west, too, furnished literary patronage in the course of the 15 th century, asdidthose of the Ottoman sultans of Turkey.
Extensive terrain ofPersian letters
When the Safavids established their sweeping power in 907/1501, their militant and fanatical Shi'ism caused a schism inthe body ofthe Islamic world. Among other outcomes, political and cultural relations with the Uzbek Shaibanids in Central Asia (905-1007/1500-98) and the Ottomans suffered. Contrary to expectations, however, this did not affect the continued support forand production of Persian literature in their realms. It isa remarkable fact that, in spite ofthe religious schism and the Safavids, Persian culture and Persian literature had their widest territorial expansion during the 16th-18th centuries. Central Asia had been a homeland of Persian literature from Samanid times, and although itsimportance declined somewhat during the reign of the Chaghatayids in the 13 th century, it rose to prominence again under Tlmur, who made Samarqand hiscapital. The city experienced considerable literary and scientific prosperity under his grandson, Ulugh Beg. Under the SunnI Shaibanids, Persian letters continued to thrive, even though now Chaghatai (Uzbek) works were

PERSIAN POETRY: TIMURID AND SAFAVID PERIODS
also written, following the example setby Mir 'AH Shir, the father of Chaghatai poetry. TheTa%kira-ji Mu%akkir-i ahbdbof Baha' al-Din Hasan Nisarl, written in 974/1566—7, contains the notices of 275 Persian poets who were active during the first three decades of the ioth/i6th century outside Iran and more particularly in Central Asia. Among these are a large number ofShaibanid princes. These, though sworn enemies ofthe Safavids, still wrote Persian poetry and patronised Persian poets, as did some Ottoman sultans, notably Selim I
(d. 926/1520).1
Persian as the literary and administrative language was introduced in Anatolia chiefly by a branch of the Saljuqs (the Saljuqs of Rum, 470—707/1077—1307), many of whose princes actively patronised Persian culture. Their literary legacy was taken upbythe Ottomans (680—1342/1281—1924), whofor the greater part of their reign followed Persian literary models (see below). Iraq, which hadbeen the seat of the 'Abbasid caliphs, was drawn into the orbit ofPersian cultural influence after the Mongols captured Baghdad in 1258 and Iraq became a part ofthe Il-Khanid dominions. After the collapse ofthe Il-Khans in 736/1335 Persian literary culture continued to besupported inIraq by the Jalayirids, asuccessor state of the Mongols in Iraq andAzarbaljan (736-835/1335-1432), and after them bythe Turkmen dynasties and finally bythe Ottomans. The Indian subcontinent wasopened to Persian influence with Islamic missionary activities in the early centuries of Islam, and later by the conquests of the Ghaznavid Mahmud in the 5th/nth century. The Ghaznavids of India were among the first patrons of Persian poetry in the subcontinent. Already inthe 7th/13th century, Khusrau ofDelhi set the tone for alarge number of poets who followed in his wake. The founding of the Mughal empire by Babur in 932/1526 raised to unprecedented heights the level of patronage of Persian letters in the subcontinent. A host of poets flocked tothe courts of Babur's successors. The generosity of the Mughal emperors toPersian poets, and the vying of their literary-minded and art-loving dignitaries with one another inattracting and recruiting poets and artists, have become legendary. Many biographers and tazkira
writers2 have lingered on the subject (see further below).

SECOND PHASE, 14.OO-I75O: THE INDIAN SCHOOL
The unity of thepoetry in different languages
Poetry was written also in Turkish in Turkey, in Chaghatai among the Uzbeks, and in several Indian languages in Muslim India, notably Sindhi and Urdu. An important point to bear in mind is that irrespective of the language that the poets used, the poetry was the same. In the vast territory stretching from Asia Minor to Turkestan and to Bengal, poetry employed the same outlook, literary conventions, forms, metres, rhyming patterns, and above all the same imagery. The choice of language was an accident of birth, habitat, patronage, or predilection, but the models for it were and continued to be Persian. "The first Ottoman poets — and their successors through many generations —", wrote E.J.W. Gibb in his classic Historyof Ottoman Poetry, "strove with all their strength to write what is little else than Persian poetry in Turkish words ... Of national feeling in poetry they dreamed not.
Poetry to them was one and indivisible."1. This applies, except in folk poetry, equally well to the literature of the Turkic peoples of Central Asia and the Muslims of India; in sum, to the non-Arab Muslims that Gibb calls West Asian. "The question as to what language a writer in this West Asian literature should use," he points out, "whether this should be Persian, Ottoman, Turki, Urdu, or Pushtu, was generally, but not always, determined by the locality in which he happened to find himself... To the Ottoman people poetry was a single entity, no more affected by question of race or language than was theology or
science".2 The languages mentioned above were all, more by cultural penetration than political dominance, pervaded by Persian, and borrowed much of their poetic vocabulary from it.
Abundance of poetry
Persian poetry was produced during this period in abundance. In his Majalisal-nafa'is, Mir 'All Shir names some 132 poets who experienced
the reign of Shah Rukh.3 A ioth/16th-century Persian translator of the Majalis,Fakhrl HaratI, brings the number of the poets who lived in the
15th century up to 570.4 Daulatshah, writing c. 892/1487, refers in his tazkira to the overabundance of poets and to the decline of poetry's

value as a result. "Wherever youlisten", he writes, "there is the murmur ofa poet and wherever you look there is a tender-heart or a
wit ... and it is [well] said that the abundance reduces the worth."1 Among the vast number of practitioners of the art were not only professional poets forwhom the Timurid and Turkmen courts vied, but also poets of humble birth and lowly profession. Mir 'All Shir mentions poets who were potters, drum-players, spinners, tent-makers, bag-sweepers, binders, and simple soldiers. He even characterises two
poets as 'ami or illiterate.2 As forthe Safavid period, Sam Mirza records in his Tuhja-yi Sami (written in 958/1551) more than 700 contemporary poets who lived under hisfather Shah Isma'U I and his brother Shah Tahmasp; and Muhammad Tahir NasrabadI, the nth/17th-century anthologist and biographer of poets, writing under the Safavid Shah Sulaiman (1077-1105/1666-94), records nearly 1,000 contemporary poets. This is a considerable number, even when we allow that in tazkiras ofthis kind, many poets who are recorded are nomore than occasional or obscure poets who wrote only mediocre verse. The number ofpoets who wrote inPersia and Central Asia was far exceeded by those who wrote in the subcontinent. Although no clear statistics are available, there isno doubt that more Persian poetry and prose was written inIndia under the Mughal emperors than in Persia during the same period. It will be recalled that Persian was the literary and administrative language of Mughal India. It is an indication of the extent of the popularity and productivity of Persian poetry in the subcontinent that Muhammad Aslah's tazkira of the Persian poetsof Kashmir, written during the reign of the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah (1131—61/1719—48), alone lists 303 poets. 'All Shir Tatavl's Maqdldt a/shu'ard' (completed in 1173/1760) contains notices of 719 Persian poets ofSind alone. Of the 3,148 poets who are the subject of
Ahmad 'All Hashimi Sandllavl's Ta%kira-yi Makbs^an al-ghard'ib (written in 1218/1804), although this isa general tazkira, the majority are poets who either were born in India, lived in India, or were supported by an Indian patron.

SECOND PHASE, I 4 O O - I 7 5 O : THE INDIAN SCHOOL
Contemporary estimation of thepoetry
If in quantity the poetry of the period surpasses that of comparable periods in the past, in quality it falls behind and is associated with the decline of Persian letters. This characterisation, which reflects the standards of modern Persia and of the West, is not shared by the critics of the period. The majority of the period's tazkiras have introductory
sections on the high status of poetry and poets.1 Sam Mlrza, whose tazkira has been mentioned, typically declares his contemporaries to be equal to Khusrau Dihlavl, Sa'dl, and Anvarl, and even superior to FirdausI and Sana'I. As to his view of the status of poets in general, he considers them "chosen by God and recipients of endless [divine] light". The very fact that men of exalted rank like Mir 'All Shir and Sam Mlrza cared to anthologise the poems of their contemporaries and write tazkiras on them, and the eagerness with which the Mughal princes and their courtiers sought poets, read their poems, and commented on them, attest to the high station that they accorded to the poetry of their time. The poets themselves wrote with great confidence and thought highly of the poetry of their period. They considered it a poetry of superior ingenuity and imagination. Although not much weight may be attached to the poets' conceit, the very exaggerated views of these
poets about their work2 demonstrate at least that they saw no decline in the poetic art of their time. On the contrary, they boasted of the "new way", the "new style" peculiar to them. Several expressions are used by the poets and literary historians to refer to this new way. Among
these are tars^-i ta%a (or tar% for short)3 and td^a-gii'i. The latter is used by Mulla 'Abd al-Baql Nahavandl in his notices on 'Urfl (d. 999/1590) and FaizI (d. 1004/1595), suggesting that their new style was encouraged by their poetry-loving patron, Abu'1-Fath GllanI, a high-ranking
courtier of Akbar.4

By the mid 16th century, the new style was in full swing and the fame of its major representative, Sa'ib (d. 1081/1675), had spread far and wide, with alarge following in Persia, India, Turkey, and the other
regions where Persian poetry was written.1
The emergence of the Indian style
In essence the Indian style is anelaboration of the 'Iraqi style into a poetry ofsubtle thoughts and ingenious poetic ideas, frequently atthe expense of felicity of phrase and warmth of feeling. Faint signs of the Indian style begin to appear from the beginning of the Timurid period andeven in Hafiz. In his case, however, the subtlety of imagination is matched bya perfect mastery of language and a rare power ofexpression. It isclear that with him the ghazalin the 'Iraqi style had actualised its whole potential. A fallow literary period ensued before anew approach made itself felt. From about the middle ofthe 14th century attempts at expressing poetic ideas which would impress the reader by their subtlety, daintiness, oringenuity become noticeable. The tendency continues during the 15 th century, but itis overshadowed by efforts atformal dexterity. During the 16th century, while some poets like VahshI (d. 991/1583) wrote warm, passionate poems, and others like 'Urfl composed robust qasldas, the majority of the poets tended towards semantic mannerism and intricate formulation of thought. Bythe 17th century this had given rise inPersia and India toa style which was now distinguished from the 'Iraqi style and had adopted different aesthetic criteria. Sana'I, (d. 956/1549), 'Urfl, FaizI, Zuhurl (d. 1025/1616), Nazlrl (d.1021/ 1612), Sa'ib, Kallm (d. 1061/1650), Talib Amull (d. 1035/1626) and Bldil (Bedil, d. 1133/1721), are among its masters. Before discussing the Indian style in more detail, we must considera phase in which theelaboration of the rhetorical aspects of poetry reached an unprecedented high point.
Poetry of the ijth century
The generation of poets who lived during the first half of the 15 th century show no advance on their immediate predecessors. The better

known poets of this period, 'Ismat Bukhara'I, whowrote tender lyricomystical ghazals; Ni'mat-Allah Vail, the sufl leader who like Qasim al-Anvar wrote mystical lyrics; the humourist Bushaq (Abu Ishaq, d. 827 or 830/1424 or 1427), who has left behind a "gastronomical" divan; Katibl Turshlzl (d. 839/1435—6), the prolific writer in all major forms of Persian poetry who excelled in the use of rhetorical devices; Amir Shahl, the writer of felicitous ghazals; and Ibn Husam, who is distinguished by his well-composed qasldas, are alf good poets of limited interest who wrote in the style of the 14th century or earlier, but without any conspicuous originality. As in the sciences, where the scholarly endeavour tended more and more toward exegesis and annotation of earlier works rather than original writing, so also in poetry, albeit to a lesser extent, it became a current practice to write parallels to the works of older masters, emulating the metre, rhyme-pattern, and sometimes the type of content of an earlier ghazal, qasida, or masnavl. This trend continued through the Safavid and Mughal period, when poets often found themselves challenged to "respond" to a poem of a past or present master. The aspect of the poetry of the 15 th century that attracts our notice is the tendency of some poets to engage in impressive rhetorical elaboration and formal artifice. The currency of this tendency in prose has already been pointed out. One of its instances in poetry is the choice of difficult radlfs. Lutf -Allah Nlshapurl, who saw the early years of this period, wrote, among others, a qasida with the words aftab u mah("sunand moon") as its radlf; another one with the four elements as its radlf; and a ghazal with double rhyme plus partial homonymy (jinds-i ^a'id) worked out in every rhyme. These efforts, however, pale before some of the tours de force performed by Katibl. In a qasida of fifty-eight lines he has managed to implant in each line the improbable pair "camel" and "chamber" (shuturand hujrd). He also wrote three poems in couplet form of which one has a double rhyme throughout,
the other employs two simultaneous metres in each line [dhii bahrairi),1 and the third combines a rhyme and a jinas twice in each line, at the end of each hemistich. Amir Islam Ghazall wrote a parallel to one of Anvarl's qasldas, from each hemistich of which a chronogram for the
date of the composition of the poem can be extracted.2 Another poet,
1 This is achieved by playing with syllables like the -/'of the i^afaand the conjunction «, which metrically can be short or long.

Sahib, wrote an elegy of Mir 'All Shir, all the first hemistichs ofwhich
were a chronogram for his birthdate and all the second for his death.1 Ibn Husam, aneager practitioner of rhetorical figures, has written a long qaslda in every line of which some sixor seven artifices are employed. Some ofthe rhetorical feats appear indeed beyond human capability. Ahll ShlrazI, who felt challenged by the masnavls ofKatibi, produced an amazing masnavi, Sihr-i Ha/a/ ("White Magic"), which combined all thethree feats of Katibi in each line, namely double metre, double rhyme, plus a jinas! As ifthis were not dazzling enough, he also wrote three very long qasidas, in each of which alarge number of subsidiary lines can be extracted and which include illustrationsof practically all rhetorical figures and rhyme patterns. InIndia at a later date even a poet like FaizI, who deplored exaggerated artifices in the poetry ofsome of his contemporaries, wrote an exegesis of the Qur'an using only the fourteen undotted letters (out of a total of 3 2) of the Persian alphabet. These few examples, chosen from many, are sufficient to show that the difficult artifices and intricate figures which were common to "literate" prose find ample expression in poetry, too. Such exertions, which indeed require great skill and practice, were admired, and many poets felt called upon to prove their dexterity inthis field. Lutf-Allah Nlshapurl composed a quatrain in which hetook it upon himself to mention four flowers, four gems, four weapons, four colours, four days, and the four elements, without appearing toforce the meaning. Daulatshah writes that Slml Nlshapurl, a contemporary of his, was
challenged todo likewise; he spent a year trying, but failed.2 While a good number of poets continued to write in the fairly unencumbered style of the early Timurid period, the tendency of those who aspired to "originality" and eminence was to engage in an escalating use ofrhetorical devices. An aspect ofthis tendency can be seen in the increasing popularity of writing chronograms and poetic riddles. Both require great straining ofimagination. Inchronograms the poet normally has to find a word or phrase within a poetic context that would produce the desired date when the numerical value ofeachof the letters isadded together. Inriddles, a name orconcept ishinted at in a variety ofways, and the reader must solve them by following the often intricate clues. Nasrabadi (d. c. 1100/1688) has asection at the end

of his tazkira devoted solely to an anthology of chronograms and riddles, and many divans of the period end with compositions in these genres.
The court ofHusain Baiqard
The poets ofthe next hundred years or .so, from the middle ofthe 15 th century to about the middle of the 16th century, followed the same trend. The court of the Timurid Husain b. Mansur b. Balqara is the focal point of this period, not only on account of its generous patronage of literature and the arts, but also because it boasted among its cluster of poets 'Abd al-Rahman Jarnl (d. 898/1492), an encyclopaedist, poet, andmystic of considerable verve and accomplishment. A most respected figure ofhis time, he was appreciated also atthe courts ofthe Qara Quyunlu, the Aq Quyunlu and the Ottomans. Among hisbetter-known contemporaries were MaktabI ShlrazI, (d. 900 or 916/1495 or 1510), writer of several masnavls; Sana'I, who wrote both lyrics and panegyrics; FighanI, composer of passionate love-ghazals; Hilall Chaghata'I (d. 935/15 29), who has a number of well-composed lyrics to his name; and Ahll ShlrazI, a master of all genres and, as we have seen, an unsurpassed practitioner of contrived rhetorical figures. Responding to theghazals and the qasldas of former masters and imitating them continued to be vigorously pursued by the poets ofthis period. A large number of lyrical, mystical and ethical masnavls, including Jaml's Haftaurang ("Seven thrones"), were written in imitation of NizamI and Khusrau Dihlavl. The writing of riddles and chronograms also continued to bewidely practised. The contemporary historian Khwand Amir mentions among Jami's diverse works a treatise
on writing riddles.1 With Ahli's wizardry at formal elaborations such feats reached a point beyond which it was hardly possible to pass. The way to the elaboration of meaning, however, which had started earlier, was open and was now taken upwith relish.
Elaboration ofmeaning:development ofthe Indian style
Elaboration of the meaning, like that ofthe formal elements, becomes a concern ofthe poet when direct expression ofsimple poetic thoughts

PERSTAN POETRY: TIMURID AND SAFAVID PERIODS
no longer satisfies him. Ingenuity and novelty of poetic thought inthe poetry of the period manifest themselves in several ways. One common instance is to give anexisting simile or metaphor a new twist or to build on its implications. Hazin, for example, takes the hackneyed metaphor of calling the beloved's face a candle (light) and after reversing it (i.e. candlelight resembles her face inradiance — still a common variation ofthe basic metaphor) presents us with the following line:
Sweat of shame ran down from the candle's brow
When it was outshone by your radiant face.1
Another is to hitupon a new simile or metaphor asin the following line, attributed toSa'ib:
Like areed-riding child, in the field of choice
We see ourselves mounted on asteed; in fact we are on foot;2
or the following on the fertile theme of the candle:
Anyone who like the candle exalts his head with acrown of gold,
Will ofttime sit [immersed] to his neck in tears;3
and,
The weeping of the candle is not in mourning for the moth,
Dawn is athand: itis thinking of its own dark night.4
In another line5 Sa'ib compares the joy ofthe weary fasters when they see the new moon which ends the month ofRamadan and announces the feast of Fitr, to that of those poets who seize upon a new poetic idea after having constantly searched for it:
For us joy means to seize upon asubtle thought;
For us image makers,6 this is the new moon of the Feast.
A third instance is to read a clever, never previously thought-of interpretation into a natural phenomenon, a fact of life, a common experience, oran observation, as inthe following lines by Kalim:
1 Hazin, Kuiltyyat, p. 531: the three ghazals with sham' ("candle") as radif offer many elaborations and variations on the old candle metaphors.

4 Sa'ib, Divan, p. 349.

SECOND PHASE, 14OO—1750: THE INDIAN SCHOOL
If abandoning comfort does not bring pleasure,
Why is it that the tender-bodied rose makes its bed in thorns?1
and.
The spark knows not of the outcome of things in this world
Look at its ashen body after being draped in satin,2
and again:
Those with an enlightened heart are not attached to their offspring:
Separation from spark is easy for the flame.3
In such verses often the observation or common experience is expressed in one hemistich, the interpretation or illustration {irsdl al-masal) in the next, so that the line is complete and self-contained, as in the following by Sa'ib:
When a man grows old, his greed grows young;
Slumber becomes heavy at the time of dawn.4
The technique often consists of illustrating a dictum or a point claimed by the poet by an undeniable parallel, as in the line by Kallm:
The mean do not acquire nobility by proximity to the great The thread does not become precious by its connection with
the pearls;5
and,
If you are satisfied with your portion, the more or less of the world is the same; When the thirsty man requires but one draught, the pitcher and the
river are the same.6
A variation of this device is to offer a poetic justification (husn-i ta'lit) for a statement made by the poet, a device frequently and most inventively used in the poetry of the period — for instance:
His apparent cruelty covers a hidden kindness:
He kills the prey so it will not become lean.7
In another variation, the poet implies validity for a poetic statement as if it were an acknowledged truth, as in the following line by Sa'ib:
1 Kallm, Divan, p. 231. 2 Ibid., p. 520: satin refers to the spark's fiery colour. 3 Ibid., p. 307. 4 Sa'ib, selections ed. Mu'tamin, p. 77. 5 Kallm, Divan, p. 117 (no. 77). 6 Ibid., p. 192 (no. 259): the word translated "river" is darya(also "sea", "ocean"). 7 Ibid.
987



PERSIAN POETRY: TIMURID AND SAFAVID PERIODS
To write letters to the beloved is an alien custom
The moth's letter to the candle is its wings.1
Yet another instance is to reach anew level of poetic exaggeration as in the line from FighanI:
You appeared in his dream and your feet took on the hue of henna,
So much did he rub them against his eyes!2
A further technique is that of invoking aparadox as inSa'ib's line:
By bitter words he makes himself [seem] sweet; It is adisaster to life when acoquette happens to be
sweetly foul-mouthed.3
Still another method is to play on the associative meanings or implications of words andimages so that, apart from the more obvious purport of the line, accessory relationships and correspondencesare invoked inthe mind of the reader, for instance:
Oh my Joseph, how long will you place ablue beauty spot
under your lip,
This dove is not worthy of the hollow of your chin.4
The only raison d'etre of this non-poetic and altogether vapid line is the correspondences and congruities between its elements: congruence between Joseph and pit; "blue" {nit) and "the Nile" (an unexpressed homonymy), the second meaning related to Joseph; chah ("pit") has invoked the image of dove on account of the expression kabutar-i chdhi, "wild pigeon". When such correspondences are notforced they add new dimensions to the line. In fact the intellectual and poetic impact of the ghazals in the Indian style is very often deepened by such implied correspondences; they invite the reader to discover and appreciate them. As long as they are not too tenuous, they afford the reader the pleasure of both wonder and discovery; but only too often the power of expression is inadequate, and the poet fails to dojustice to allthe relationships which crowd his mind. An element which contributes tothe intricacy ofmany a line is the
1 Sa'ib, Divan, p. 242.
2 FighanI, Divan, p. 126. There isdeliberate ambiguity here: henna hue either on accountof tenderness of the feet's skin, or from the lover's eyes, which conventionally shed tears of blood.
3 Sa'ib, selections ed. Mu'tamin, p. 192; see also the line from Kallm, above.
4 Sa'ib, selections ed. Mu'tamin, p. 119: the word translated "hollow" is chah, literally "pit".
988



SECOND PHASE, I 4 O O - I 7 5 O : THE INDIAN SCHOOL
excessive use of constructs based on a metaphor. Conventional metaphors in Persian poetry are generally based on correspondence between two simple ideas, such as "glance" and "dart", "wrath" and "fire". Persian poets often combine the two elements of a metaphor in a single phrase where the second word determines the metaphorical nature of the first, such as tir-i nigdh ("dart of a glance"). Such sets are often based on a simile (that is, i^dfa-ji tashbiht), but the correspondence may be otherwise and sometimes be grounded on the implications of two ideas, such as chashm-i tama' ("the eye of greed") or dast-i ghaib ("the hand of the Hidden"). The poets of the Indian School sometimes have too many of these sets in a line, as in the following from Nazlri's elegy on his child:
Without the breath of morn the orchard of theflower-budgrewdry. Without the lip of the moist rose-petal, the milk of the clouds
driedup,1
or the following line quoted by the author of Ma'dsir-i Kahlmi from Shaida (16thcentury):
When the eyeof the sunfindsits eyebrow in the horn of Aries,
Night becomes thepupil and daythe white, so to speak.2
The reader will have a hard time keeping up with such accumulated metaphors, particularly if they are unfamiliar and the links on which they are built arethin or whimsical, as in many poems of the later poets of this school, like Shaukat Bukhara'I (d. 1107/1696), Nasir 'All Sahrandi (d. 1108/1697) and above all, the highly imaginative, passionate, but often convoluted and occasionally undecipherable Bldil, whose flights of fancy and his extraordinary ability to capture far-fetched correspondences often leave the reader aghast. Despite their variety, these devices3 can be reduced, however, toone of two basic techniques: finding new, unexpected links between unrelated notions, and orchestrating the associative meanings of words, ideas, and images. In the final analysis both come down to a single faculty: perceiving uncommon relationships. Themore subtle or tenuous these are, the more ingenious and inventive they will sound, but also less easy to grasp. It is this cerebral aspect of this "imagist school" of Persian poetry which is both its great merit and its bane.

PERSIAN POETRY: TIMURID AND SAFAVID PERIODS
Modern evaluation
The poetry of this period is generally considered one of decline, and the
term "the Indian style" has assumed a mildly derogatoryflavour.1The first to hold this view were the members of the Isfahanl group who began the Literary Revival movement. Lutf 'All Azar's comments in his tazkira on Sa'ib, the best-known Safavid poet, are indicative of the opinions of the group. He states that "from the beginning the way to the firm imagery of the eloquent poets of the past was blocked" to Sa'ib, the "founder of the distasteful new style". He considers his renown unfounded, and intimates that only with great effort had he managed to
choose some poems ofSa'ib.2 The harshest indictment ofthe Safavid style ispenned perhaps by Riza Qull Khan Hidayat (d. 1288/1871), the well-known Qajar scholar, historian, and anthologist. In his Majma' al-fusaha', the best-known Persian tazkira, which reflects the orientation of the qaslda-writers of the Qajar period, he writes:
After the Saljuq poets no progress was obtained in poetry; on the contrary,it
declined daily from the highest level until it reached amiddle state with the
poetry of Salman Savajl and his like. Anumber ofpoets belonging tothis
stage attempted lyric poetry, but exceptforKhwaja Shams al-DIn Muhammad
Hafiz, whose ghazals have been well appreciated by the admirers of form and
substance, there is hardly a divan inherited from them which could be worthy
of hearing. Gradually the poetry declined further from the middle stage and
reached a low level. Under the Tiirkmens and the Safavids, reprehensible
styles appeared .. .and since there were no binding rules for lyrics, the poets,
following their sick natures and distorted tastes, began to write confused, vain
and nonsensical poems. They placed in their poetry insipid meanings instead
of inspired truths, ugly contents ... instead of fine rhetorical devices and
attractive innovations ...but, since every defect isfollowed by a perfection,
and each separation by a reunion, .. .towards the end of the rule of the Lurs
[the Zand dynasty] several individuals directed their tastes toward reviving
the style of the old masters and demonstrated awareness of the tastelessness of
the style of the later poets and their banal ways .. .and endeavoured .. .to divert
people from their blame-worthy style.3
This view ofSafavid poetry, which was echoed by Muhammad Taql Bahar (d. 1330/1951), a respected contemporary poet and literary
1 For the views of some Western literary historians, see ibid., pp. 217, 227.

manuscripts: both are derogatory. 3 Hidayat I, 9—10.

historian,1 has generally been followed by modern critics.2 The distaste for this style has received further support from some contemporary literary scholars who regard the Safavid period as a barren one and hold the dynasty responsible for the decline of culture and learning in
Persia.3 This view of the Indian school of poetry, however, has by no means been shared by all. The Literary Revival movement did not have much impact outside Persia, and the Indian, Ottoman, Afghan, and Central Asian critics continued to admire the works of 'Urfl, Sa'ib, Nazlri, Kallm and their like. The lively criticism we often find in works written in India of some poets of the Indian school is directed not
against the school itself but against individual failings.4 Shibll Nu'manl, in the third volume of his major history of Persian literature in Urdu, Shi'r al-'Ajam, although not unaware of some of the excesses and weaknesses of the poets of this school, still shows great appreciation of them and treats them almost in the same vein as he has earlier treated Sa'dl and Hafiz. It may be that in countries outside Persia some of the formal aspects of poetry are appreciated somewhat differently than in Persia itself. Of late some Persian critics, too, have attempted a vindication of the
Indian style.5 The divans of many of the poets of this school have recently been published, and excerpted lines from them have found their way into many anthologies, a well known example being that of Jahanbanl. These poets are now receiving kinder treatment than before, but the scepticism of the established literary critics, although moderated, has not been radically altered.
General impression of the poems
The poetry of the Indian school is too often judged - particularly by its admirers — on the basis of single lines, excerpted from the divans.

PERSIAN POETRY: TIMURID AND SAFAVID PERIODS
These lines, frequently met in anthologies, are generally clever, dainty, and imaginative; they are also sometimes polished and eloquent. A more comprehensive impression isgained, however, when we look at the divans as awhole. Here we see the infirmity of the language, forced attempts at cleverness and novelty, crowding of lines with images, disparateness of ideas expressed in a single ghazal without any clear philosophical or even ethical focus, and a certain absence of warmth and emotional authenticity. By its preoccupation with novelty the spontaneity of this poetry suffers. Some poets like FighanI and VahshI, who were more interested in conveying their heart's feelings, still followed the models of the 'Iraqi school and their ghazals are unmistakably love poems. But more often the poets appear to be so concerned with discovering novel ideas andunexpected turns and making clever allusions that the ghazal loses some of its emotive effect and forfeits its naturalness. In the works of the later poets of the period the ghazal is often no longer an expression of the poet's feelings, but an arena for the play of poetic wit andinvention. Images andideas become almost free and assume alife of their own. The music ofthe ghazals also call for some comment. Whereas the qasldas generally retain their vivid musical quality, in the ghazal the lively rhythms and well-phrased modulations of the former poets are often replaced bylanguid, monotonous ones. This is partly because frequently longer metres, such as ha^ajoctameters (four times mafSilun to each hemistich), were chosen by the poets, possibly to enable them to express complex thought in a single line, but this cannot explain the dragging and monotonous arrangements of short and long syllables within a chosen metre. Only infrequently do we find in the ghazals of the
17th century those exciting, dance-inspiring orvirile rhythms1 we encounter in the poetry of the old masters. The music ofthe ghazals and the masnavls seems tobe well intune with a spirit ofmeekness advocated bythe mystics and the devout humility that the poet assumed vis-a-vis the beloved. The musical aspect of Persian poetry, however,is an area which has not been studied adequately and requires further research. Not only in music, but also in language the ghazal lost ground. The 'Iraqi ghazal is characterised by elegance and adequacy of expression.It uses a polished, well-crafted language, the elements of which fit

together in a grammatically sound and musically pleasing manner. With the poets of the Indian school the language becomes somewhat loose; the syntax, which is the linguistic expression of logical thought, weakens and the exclusive diction of the ghazal breaks down; common
words of everyday life enter the lyrics.1 The admission of common words is not detrimental by itself; it could even be beneficial, as in the case of Traj (d. 1343/1924) and Parvln (d. 1320/1941) in a later period. It is their uneasy grafting onto a select language combined with syntactic and expressive weakness that marks the poor quality of diction and is considered a negative aspect of this poetry. On the other hand, these poems allow a variety of content which we do not find in the 'Iraqi ghazals. They contain many universal statements, points of practical wisdom, mystical sentiments and moral advice, generally enlivened by a poetic, unexpected illustration. It must be pointed out, however, that such statements do not emanate from any system of thought. They are scattered remarks occasioned by the poet's having seized upon some congruity or elusive relationship. Thus these poems on the one hand become less intimate, but on the other more observant. The latter quality was not lost on the critics of the period. They refer to it as vuqii'-gii'i, which means observing and expressing real or natural situations occurring in the course of the lover's experience. The following line from Nazlrl is a case in point:
His kindness cannot be trusted.
I am a new lover and his mind does not suspect me;2
or the following lines from Sharaf-i Jahan:
He will answer me aloud so as to make my rival aware
If I should ask him a question in confidence;3
and
Stealthily my eyes wandered over his face
He turned his glance toward me, and I was ashamed.4
But while we find many fine lines and, here and there, splendid ghazals, these hardly diminish the general impression. In view of its

emphasis onwitty content, the Indian style poetry reads better than
'Iraqi or KhurasanI poetry in translation,1 once its conventionsare understood. Itslanguage and formal qualities, lost to translation, do not match, however, theinventiveness of its thought and remain somewhat jarring.
The cause of decline
The development ofPersian lyric poetry from its inception is entirely coherent and understandable. From a sturdy and joyous beginning with a rather gratified lover as its protagonist — it develops into a passionate poetry ofsuperb diction, and eventually leads to the intricate ghazals ofthe later phase ofthe Indian style, gradually losingits emotional force and linguistic splendour. In the enditreads more likea riddle, lost in the web of recondite thought and crowded imagery. Such acourse is not uncommon in the development of many an art and literature. All manner of theories, mostly of a political nature, have been offered to account forthe decline of classical Persian literature. Actually, the development ofPersian poetry in the 14th to 18th centuries does not seem to have been much affected by political, social, or religious events. Neither the destructive invasion of Tlmur, nor the religious militarism of the Safavids, nor the enlightened encouragement of the Great Mughals seems to have substantially altered its course. This course does not require much explanation, any more than do the rise, decline, and fall ofpolitical systems orsocial institutions. The decline simply comes with oldage andtheexhaustion of creative energy. Rather than having been caused by external events, it is,like some of the events themselves, a manifestation of diminishing spiritual strength. In the period we have surveyed we are dealing with the last organic phase of "classical" Persian poetry. This phase did not come to anend without a final show of vigour. Itgave us avast body of poetry that, its flaws notwithstanding, has enriched Persian literature with gems of ingenious poetry intens of thousands of sparkling lines.

CHAPTER 6
For an annotated general bibliography of the Safavid period, see Savory, "Bibliography on theHistory of Iran under theSafavids," in Bibliographical Guide to Iran, ed. L.P.Elwell-Sutton (London, 1983).
Valuable information on the Safavid administrative system may be gleaned from the immensely rich and important European travel literature relating to Iran during the Safavid period. Auseful summary of the available editionsof the European travellers to Safavid Iran iscontained in:
John Emerson, Ex Occidente Lux. Some European sources on theeconomic structure of Persia between about 1630 and 1690. Unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Cambridge, 1969. *Minorsky, Tadhkirat al-Muluk, pp. 6—9, hasbrief assessments of the value of the main travel accounts.
Few Iranian scholars have devoted much attention to Safavid administrative institutions. An exceptionis: *Falsaff, Zindagani.
Works which contain a substantial amount ofmaterial onSafavid administrative institutions:
Bellan L.-L. Chah'AbbasI. Paris, 1932. *Busse. Untersuchungen.

CHAPTER 14
For a general survey one should refer to the following large volumes of illustrations. In connection with the first Exhibition ofOriental Carpets in Vienna in 1891 the three-volume Orientalische Teppiche (Vienna, London, Paris) appeared in 1892. The first proposed classification was published byF. R.
Martin in A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800 (Vienna, 1908, 2 vols.). Two years after the Exhibition of Mohammedan Art in Munich in 1910 there

appeared F. Sarre and F. R. Martin, Die Ausstellung von Meisterwerken Muhammedanischer Kunst in Miinchen ipio (Munich, 1912, 3 vols. and a supplement), a work equally important for both carpets and fabrics. The best colour plates are to be found in F. Sarre and H. Trenkwald, Alt-orientalische Teppiche (2 vols. Vienna, 1926-8): Volume 1 by Trenkwald is devoted entirely to the exhibits of the Osterreichisches Museum fur angewandte Kunst in Vienna, while in Volume 11 Sarre deals with important carpets in various public and private collections. The comprehensive Exhibition of Persian Art in London in 1931 led to the publication of *SPA, which contains the largest compendium of Safavid carpets and fabrics.
Fundamental information is also supplied by W.v. Bode and E. Kiihnel,
Vorderasiatische Kniipfteppicbe, (4th edition Braunschweig, 1955); t r a n s . C. G. Ellis, Antique Rugsfrom the Near East (Braunschweig, 1958); by A. U. Dilley, Oriental Rugs and Carpets (New York, Philadelphia, 1954, revised by M. S. Dimand); and by K. Erdmann in Derorientalische Kniipfteppich (Tubingen, 1955), trans. C. G. Ellis, Oriental Carpets, New York, 1962. K. Erdmann here compiles an extensive bibliography of Oriental carpets which is a splendid source of information, not least because it is a classified list. On the subject of carpet techniques a useful handbook is C. E. C. Tattersall, NotesonCarpet-Knotting and Weaving (London, 1961, Victoria and Albert Museum). Specifically on the fabrics see also O. v. Falke, Kunstgeschichte der Seidenweberei (Berlin, 1913,2 vols.), F. R. Martin, Diepersischen PrachtstoffeimSchlosse Rosenborg
in Kopenhagen (Stockholm, 1901) and — particularly for their bibliography — H. J. Schmidt, Alte Seidenstoffe (Braunschweig, 1958) and A. C. Weibel, Two Thousand Yearsof Textiles (New York, 1952). Information about the technique of Persian fabrics is supplied by N. A. Reath and E. B. Sachs, PersianTextiles and their Technique from the Sixth to the Eighteenth Centuries (New Haven, Conn., 1937). The most comprehensive bibliography of Islamic art is K. A. C. Cresswell,
A Bibliography of the Architecture, Arts and Crafts of Islam to 1st January i960, The American University at Cairo Press (London, 1961).
