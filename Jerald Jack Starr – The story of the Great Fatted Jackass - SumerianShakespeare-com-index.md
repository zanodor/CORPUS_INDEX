Translation of cuneiform Tablet SEM 114, the story of The Great Fatted
Jackass

Tablet SEM 114 obverse (front). Much of the tablet is heavily damaged.
Fortunately, the reverse side of the tablet is in better shape, as shown
below.
SEM stands for Sumerian Epics and Myths.
Tablet SEM 114 was first discovered a hundred years ago. Edward Chiera
first attempted to translate this tablet in the early part of the twentieth
century, but he could not read the tablet. Chiera was a world renowned
Sumerologist, an expert in the field. He has almost 500 translations listed
on the CDLI. I've studied so many of his transliterations, I can recognize
one of his line-drawings from a mile away. Chiera could translate anything
written in the Sumerian language, including massive, complex literary
tablets, and yet he could not read
this one simple tablet.
Most of the tablet is damaged or destroyed, but it's clearly a version of The
Great Fatted Bull
and The Princess Wife, the latter story in particular. All three are basically
the same story;
and many of the sentences match word for word. All three tablets satirize
lords and kings.
Since this was a risky thing to do (powerful kings didn't like someone
making fun of them)
many of the same tricks are used to disguise the meaning of the text. The
encoded writing
is why Chiera could not translate this tablet; not even another Sumerian
scribe could
translate it without first knowing the secret context (subject) of the story.
But I already knew the secret context of the story (from The Great Fatted
Bull and BE 31,28, The Princess Wife). I'm also wise to the scribes' tricks,
so this translation wasn't too difficult for me.
I wanted to give Tablet BE 28 the title of "The Great Fatted Jackass" to
match Tablet #36,
The Great Fatted Bull. The tale told on BE 28 is about Mulu, the Great
Fatted Donkey,
but I was going to call it The Great Fatted Jackass because I thought it
better expresses

his true nature. However, the main character in the story is Mulu's wife,
the princess.
It's really her story more than his, so instead I entitled it The Princess
Wife. I did so
reluctantly; it seemed a shame to waste a good title like "The Great Fatted
Jackass".
Fortunately, this tablet is a variation of the story of The Great Fatted
Donkey. It has many of the same sentences, but in a different order. It also
has the brother Zuzu. So as it turns out, there is no need to waste a good
title:
Tablet SEM 114 obverse.
Note: This tablet is an abbreviated copy of BE 31 28, so after reading this
"pocket edition",
you may want to read The Princess Wife to get the full meaning of the
story.
For those of you who are interested in this sort of thing, the
Transliteration is given on a
separate page. Select the Transliteration tab on the left.
This is a "composite translation". Some of the details are supplied from
the undamaged portions of Tablet #36 and BE 31,28. This is standard
procedure for "filling in the blanks"
on damaged tablets.

After the damaged area on the tablet, the story begins when Mulu's wife
has taken away his
henbur grain. She's gives him with just one single twig of his grain.

Obverse:
o1 [...] mahX lugud2
great tight/reduced
MahX (AL/mah2) is the trick sign on Tablet #36, the story of The Great
Fatted Bull. It is used to obscure the “king” context of the story, as
explained in line o3 of the Transliteration. It is also used repeatedly on BE
31 28, The Princess Wife.
This line occurs on both Tablet #36 and BE 31,28 (BE 28 for short). It
happens after the wives
have given away all of the grain that belongs to Lu-mah and Mulu, and
they both know
“a great hunger”, i.e., their stomachs know a great tightness/reduction.
On Tablet #36, the corresponding line is r14: ta (ES, a-na, interrogative)
dili šag4 zu
maḫX-lugud2, “’What? Only one?’ His stomach knows a great hunger.”
On BE 28, the corresponding line is o13: ta-a-aš šag4 ba/zu? maḫX
lugud2, “’Why? For what reason?’
His stomach knows a great hunger.”
o2 [...] še pisan#? sa-sa gar gemeX #? tah tah [...]

GemeX is a "trick sign" for geme2, meaning a "female servant or slave".
Geme2 is usually written with three reverse cunei, but gemeX is written
with only two, so that it looks like gu, "cord". This was meant to help

disguise the meaning of the text, as explained in Sumerian Trick Signs.
In this sentence, the wife has given Mulu's grain and his jewelry to the
slave women.
o3 [...] ma mu du lum ma mu ukur3# x
go he walk manure country he pauper x
On BE 28 line o15, the sentence reads, mu-lu lu2 du a ak i bar mu du lum
ma mu ukur3 dim2, “Mulu person go to act defeat outside he walk manure
he pauper made”, which translates as “Mulu goes away acting like a man
defeated. Outside, he walks in the manure of the country. He has become a
pauper.”
Ukur3, "pauper", is composed of the signs lal2 and du. Here, du is
crowded under the overhang of lal2 (see below right) as if the scribe forgot
to write it and then had to add it later after the sentence had been written.
Or perhaps he was concerned about running out of space on this crowded
line. I never would have been able to figure out the sign if I hadn't already
read ukur3 on BE 28. For comparison purposes, du is also written in this
sentence (third sign from the left). The sign ukur3 is also written this way
on another tablet, probably to save space (see a Sumerian proverb; ukur3
is the first sign).
o4 [...] nu-zid na
no-virtue man
On BE 28 line o16, the sentence reads, nu-nus-a lu nu-kal-la nu-nus nu
zid na, “woman-in abundance not-powerful no-woman no-virtue man”. In
English it is, “While the women live in abundance, he is a man without
power, without women, and without virtue.”

o5 [...] ab# ba an-še šu dal/dirig?
On BE 28 line o17, this portion of the line reads ab-ba ba-an-tu (with two
ba(s)). Ab-ba means “father”, so Mulu’s father is named ba-an-tu (Bantu).
Here, it is written with just one ba, so the ba could apply either to ab-ba
(father), or to the father’s name, ba-an-še (Banše, or perhaps Banšešu)
because ab by itself also means “father”. Either way, notice that the
father’s name contains a pun for donkey (an-še = anše).
r1 [...,x] ne za pisan [...]
this, bead(s) basket
Here and in the next two lines is where Mulu’s father shows him the beads

that he can exchange for baskets of food.
r2 ... sa10-aĝ2-(ES, niĝ2)-ne pisan # ...
purchase thing-this basket
r3 [...] pisan pisan [x x ...]
basket basket
r4 [...] zu umuš ? uĝ3 egir? za e aĝ2 [x ...]
This line on BE 28 (r1) is where the princess tells Mulu that she’s wise to
his plan to [x,x]. Unfortunately, that line, like this one, is also damaged, so
it is difficult to discern its meaning.
r5 x ba zu! za!-an (am3) ta lal
? ? know that character lack
On BE 28 (line r2) the servant girl has informed the wife of Mulu’s lack of
character. There am3 is written correctly. Here am3 (a-an) is miswritten
as za-an.
r6 še 1{diš} sila3 am3 pisan#? [pad3 ne] en na ba
grain 1 unit that basket [purchase price reveals] lord stone gave
On r3 of BE 28, the beginning of this line is written correctly as 1{diš}-ta
še-am3, “one-each sale-price”. Here the signs are written out of order and

ta is miswritten or incorrectly transcribed in the line-drawing. The [pad3
ne] is from BE 28 r3. These two lines together clearly translate as, “The
selling price for each bead also reveals that the lord gave you these stones
{beads}.”
r7 bi aĝ2-(ES, niĝ2) sa10- aĝ2-(ES, niĝ2) # # šah2?-ne
these things purchase # # pig?-this
This is where the wife makes a counter offer to Mulu. The damaged sign
(second from the right) is probably a compressed version of šah2 (pig).
This leads me to believe that on BE 28 the princess wife is offering Mulu a
half basket of pig slop in exchange for the beads.
r8 [na]-la-ba-ni-ur la2-la2-{e} en
[man]-not-his-servant throttle lord
Versions of this line occur on Tablet #36 (r8) and BE 28 (o8).
In the stories of The Great Fatted Bull and The Princess Wife, the attack
happens under the cover of darkness, so the identity of the assailant
remains a mystery. In the story here, the attack happens in broad daylight,
after the negotiations have been concluded.
r9 munus-ĝal2 za-e ki#?-aĝ2 lu2 kalag [...]
unmarried-woman you love man strong
Munus-ĝal2, woman-available occurs in line r15 of Tablet #36. I translated
it as “unmarried woman" because she seems to offer Lu-mah many fields
of grain as a kind of marriage dowry.

r10 lu2 zuh! [ir#] ra munus munus-kin [du3 ...]
man-rob-plunder-for woman prostitute all
Zuh!/saĝ and munus-kin(prostitute) are both explained in line r6 of the
transliteration for BE 28.
r11 e-ne-eĝ3 (ES, inim) pisan#? gu7 gu7 sag [du ...]
decree basket food person go
This sentence also occurs on BE 28, line r7.
r12 [...] zu2-zu2 [...]

There’s Zuzu, the brother of Mulu.
