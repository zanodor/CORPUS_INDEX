Testimonials of the First Edition
The Independent Review - 1/98 - Armidale, Australia ...[Gadalla's] grasp of Egyptian cosmology is awesome, he explains how the Neteru were not Gods or Goddesses but principles... From this basis he is able to reconstruct the real religion of Egypt, both as esotericism and as general practices. Far from being a primitive, polytheistic form, we have the highest expression of monotheistic mysticism...
Amazon.com Online Bookstore_(http://www.amazon.com) Occult and Metaphysics Editor's Recommended Book, 01/15/98: Moustafa Gadalla's controversial Egyptian Cosmology: The Absolute Harmony shatters the centuries-old view of Egyptian deities (Neteru) as mythical figures, and instead proposes that the Neteru are not gods, but representations of different aspects of one supreme being. Gadalla seeks to rectify these and other errors that have been perpetuated by scholars since the time of the ancient Greeks. Egyptian Cosmology highlights the intelligence of this ancient civilization whose beliefs are reflected in 20 th -century concepts such as the big bang theory....
Internet Bookwatch - Oct 1997 - Wisconsin, USA Moustafa Gadalla's Egyptian Cosmology: The Absolute Harmony describes, showcases in reader-friendly fashion, the remarkably advanced concepts embodied within ancient Egyptian metaphysics. Egyptian concepts which served as the source of Western and Eastern metaphysics. Readers will discover that Egyptian cosmology is coherent, comprehensive, consistent, logical, analytical, and rational. From the casual reader to the serious student of metaphysics, Egyptian Cosmology is nothing short of fascinating as it surveys the applicability of Egyptian concepts to our modern understandings of the nature of the universe, creation, science, and philosophy. Egyptian Cosmology is an outstanding contrihution to metaphysical studies.

'Preface
Almost all Egyptologists interpreted, and continue to
interpret, the Ancient Egyptian writings and other modes
of expression (art, architecture, ...etc.) without trying to un
derstand the thoughts and beliefs expressed in them. Their
explanations continue to be shallow, which reflects their pre-conceived notions of the Ancient Egyptians as being
primitive and inferior to the modern Western world.
About a half-century ago, Alexandre Piankoff summed up the deteriorated status of Egyptology in the following statements from his book, The Tomb of Ramses VI, 1954:
For the early Egyptologists this religion was highly mysterious and mystical. They saw it with eyes of a Father Kircher
Then came a sudden reaction: scholars lost all interest in
the religion as such and viewed the religious texts merely
as source material for their philological-historical research. Under the sway of Higher Criticism, the texts were decomposed and their genesis eagerly studied. . . The intrinsic value of religious composition and thought was systematically ignored and consequently temporarily lost. Egyptian scholars since Champollion saw in the oldest religious lore of humanity mainly a collection of distorted historical data out of which he endeavored all his life to reconstruct the history of ancient Egypt.
I share with Piankoff his assessment of the present and
future state of Egyptology.
We are now at the beginning of a new era, one in which the necessity of fusion, of a synthesis of the mystical and the historical approach, is being felt. Moreover, with the appearance of psychoanalytic studies, the Egyptian religious symbols have suddenly acquired a new, an intimate mean
ing.
At the present stage, an attempt to render the pregnant



12 Egyptian Cosmology - Tfie cAmmated 'Universe
religious writings of Egypt in a modern language still remains a bold undertaking; yet it is worth while to try.
Many conflicting sides, who use Ancient Egypt to pro
mote each's own agenda, insist that the ancient religion and
traditions have died. The truth is that they never died, and
they continue to survive within the silent majority — the
Baladi people of Egypt. Even though the loud minority
the Afrangi (meaning foreign-like) Egyptians — dominate
the spotlight, the Baladi Egyptians continue to maintain their
ancestor traditions.
I sincerely hope that this book will prompt many people
(not just archeologists and academicians) to listen and learn from the treasure of knowledge imbedded in the Baladi Egyp
tian traditions. We then must re-read and re-examine the Ancient Egyptian writings with an open mind. This is an investment in our own future, for Egypt is the ancient fu
ture, where as per Hermetic Texts — Asleptus III (25),
"...the whole cosmos dwells in Egypt as in its sanctuary..."

Standards and Terminology
1 - You may find a variety in writing the same Ancient Egyptian term such as Amen/Amon/Amun. The reason
is, that the vowels you see in translated Egyptian texts are an approximation of sound that are used by Egyptologists to help them pronounce the Ancient Egyptian terms/words.
2
- The Ancient Egyptian word, neter, and its feminine form netert, have been wrongly, and possibly inten
tionally, translated to go d and goddess, by almost all aca
demicians.
Neteru (plural of neter/netert) are the divine principles and functions of the One Supreme God.
3
- When referring to the names of cities, Pharaohs, neteru, etc., if the commonly used Greek name is different than the true Egyptian name, we will show the correct Egyptian name (in this font) followed by the common, but
arbitrary Greek rendering between parentheses.
4
- The term Baladi will be used throughout this book to denote the present silent majority of Egyptians that
adhere to the Ancient Egyptian traditions, with a thin
exterior layer of islam. The christian population of
Egypt is an ethnic minority that came as refugees, from Judaea and Syria to the Ptolemaic/ Roman-ruled Alex
andria. Now, 2,000 years later, they are easily distin

of native Egyptians. [See Exiled Egyptians: The Heart of

5
- There were/are no Ancient Egyptian writings/texts that were categorized by the Egyptians themselves as "reli
gious", "funerary", "sacred", ...etc. Western academia gave the Ancient Egyptian texts arbitrary names, such
as the "Book of This", and the "Book of That", "divi
sions", "utterances", "spells", ...etc. Western academia even decided that a certain "Book" had a "Theban ver
sion" or "this or that time period version". After believing their own dogmatic creation, academia accused the Ancient Egyptians of making mistakes and miss
ing portions of their writing?!
!
For ease of reference, we will mention the common but arbitrary Western academic categorization of Ancient Egyptian texts, even though the Ancient Egyptians themselves never did.

- Throughout this book, the fonting of quotations varies
depending on the source of quotation. There are gen
erally two types of fonting:

Chapter 1
lUe "Most 1(^digimt&
Cosmic Consciousness
The Greek historian Herodotus (500 BCE) stated:
Of all the nations of the world, the Egyptians are the happi
est, healthiest and most religious.
The excellent condition of the Egyptians was attributed
to their application of metaphysical realities in their daily
life — in other words — total cosmic consciousness.
The scenes of daily activities, found inside Egyptian
tombs, show a strong perpetual correlation between the earth
and heavens. The scenes provide graphical representation
of all manner of activities: hunting, fishing, agriculture, law
courts, and all kinds of arts and crafts. Portraying these
daily activities, in the presence of the neteru (gods) or with
their assistance, signifies their cosmic correspondence.
This perpetual correlation — cosmic consciousness
was echoed in Aslcptus III (25] of the Hermetic Texts:
"...in Egypt all the operations of the powers which rule and work in heaven have been transferred to earth below... it should rather be said that the whole cosmos dwells in
[Egypt] as in its sanctuary...''



20 'Egyptian Cosmology. - Tfia cAnmmted Unwer&e
Every action, no matter how mundane, was in some sense a cosmic correspondence act: plowing, sowing, reap
ing, brewing, the size of a beer mug, the shape of a pyramid,
building ships, waging wars, playing games — all were
viewed as earthly symbols for divine activities.
In Egypt, what we now call religion, was so widely acknowledged that it did not even need a name. For them, there was no perceived difference between sacred and mundane. All their knowledge that was based on cosmic consciousness was embedded into their daily practices, which
became traditions.
Foreign visitors to Egypt, who are unfamiliar with the
cosmic depth of the natives' traditions, are unwise to hast
ily label the Ancient and Baladi Egyptians as "superstitious".
We do many things in life, such as operating the computer, without most of us knowing how it works. This does
not invalidate our computer use as being unscientific. Likewise, the Ancient and Baladi Egyptians' practices should not be dismissed because not everyone knows the scientific
basis for that perpetual cosmic action.
In any society, only a relatively few specialized people
know the scientific basis for how/why things work in cer
tain ways.



/ - Ti'ic fMa6i l\clujiou>\ 21
True Monotheism
The Ancient Egyptians believed in One God who was
self-produced, self-existent, immortal, invisible, eternal, om
niscient, almighty, etc. This One God was never represented.
It is the functions and attributes of his domain that were
represented. These attributes were called the neteru (pro
nounced net-er-u, singular: neterin the masculine form and
netertin the feminine form). The term, gods, is a misrepre
sentation of the Egyptian term, neteru. One can only define "God" through the multitude of
"his" attributes/qualities/powers/actions. This is the only
logical way, because if we refer to, say, a person as Mr. X, it means nothing to us. However, once we describe his at
tributes and qualities, we then begin to know him. A per
son who is an engineer, a father, a husband, ... etc. does not have poly-personalities, but rather a mono-personality with
multiple functions/attributes. For the Ancient and Baladi
Egyptians, the concept of God is similar.
The part-Egyptian Akhenaton failed to understand/respect the Egyptian rationale, and butchered the multiple at
tributes of God in choosing one attribute — Aton. [More
about him in Historical Deception: The Untold Story of Ancient
Egypt, by same author.]
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam assume that there is a personal God, who rules the universe and who communicates his will to man only through "chosen" prophets. These
three religions insist that they are the only monotheists.
Careful examination of their doctrines proves the exact op
posite — they acknowledge the existence and powers of two
opposing forces in the universe. They believe that their
"good god" is not in control of their "bad god". He could,
but he doesn't!?!!? If they believe that there are two inde
pendent/separate forces (Good and Bad) in the universe,
then they believe in two gods, i.e. polytheism.



22 Egyptian Cosmology - Tfye (Animated 'Universe
Egyptian Mystery Plays (Encyclopedia in Action)
Egyptian cosmology is based on coherent scientific and philosophical principles. The cosmological knowledge of Ancient Egypt was expressed in a story form, which is a
superior means for expressing both physical and metaphysi
cal concepts. Any good writer or lecturer knows that sto
ries are better than exposition for explaining the behavior
of things, because the relationships of parts to each other,
and to the whole, are better maintained by the mind. Information alone is useless, unless it is transformed into under
standing.
The Egyptian sagas transformed common factual nouns
and adjectives (indicators of qualities) into proper but con
ceptual nouns. These were, in addition, personified so that
they could be woven into narratives. Storytellers were es
pecially qualified people who bore an awesome responsibil
ity of always being — Maa Kheru (True of Voice).
Here are three different subjects that are explained in
story forms, using four personified concepts: Ausar (Osiris),
Auset (Isis), Heru (Horus), and Set (Seth):
1 - The four elements of the world (water, fire, earth, and
air), as quoted from Plutarch's Moralia, Vol V:
The Egyptians simply give the name of Ausar [Osiris] to the whole source and faculty creative of moisture, believing this to be the cause of generation and the substance of life-producing seed; and the name of Set
[Typhon in Greek] they give to all that is dry, fiery and arid, in general, and antagonistic to moisture. As the Egyptians regard the Nile as the effusion of Ausar, so they hold and believe the earth to be the body of Auset [Isis], not all of it, but so much of it as
the Nile covers, fertilizing it and uniting with it. From this union they make Heru [Horus] to be born. The all

conserving and fostering Hora, that is the seasonable tempering of the surrounding air. is Heru [I lot u /. The insidious scheming and usurpation of Set jTyphon], then, is the power of drought, which gains control and dissipates the moisture which is the source of the Nile and of its rising.
2
- The model societal framework is expressed in the legendary tale of Ausar and Auset, their son Heru, and his
uncle, Set [see story text in chapter 2].
3 - The trinity/ triad/ triangle cosmic role is expressed in
the relationship between the father (Ausar), mother
(Auset), and son (Heru), to be analogous to the right
angle triangle 3:4:5. [See story text in chapter 3.)
The Egyptian well-crafted mystery plays are an intentionally chosen means for communicating knowledge. Meaning and the mystical experience are not tied to a lit
eral interpretation of events. Once the inner meanings of the narratives have been revealed, they become marvels of simultaneous scientific and philosophical completeness and
conciseness. The more they are studied, the richer they be
come. And, rooted in the narrative as it is, the part can never be mistaken for the whole, nor can its functional sig
nificance be forgotten or distorted.



Chapter 2
TfieyUggpticm "Model
All Ancient Egyptian cosmic stories are embedded with
the society's social framework. In other words, the society must conduct its practices in accordance with the same cos
mic principles embedded in these stories. The most common story to all Egyptians was that of
Ausar (Osiris) and his family. There is not a single com
plete Egyptian record of it, in all the recovered archeological findings. Our knowledge of this legend comes from several versions that were written by the early Greek and Roman writers. The most common was the one told by
Plutarch.
A shortened version of the story of the Egyptian role
model goes as follows:
The self-created Atum spat out the twins Shu and Tef
nut, who in turn gave birth to Nut (the sky) and Geb (the
earth/matter). The union of Nut and Geb produced four children, Ausar (Osiris), Auset (Isis), Set (Seth), and Nebt-Het (Nepthys).
The story goes that Ausar married Auset, and Set married Nebt-het. Ausar became King of the land (Egypt) after marrying Auset. I • The story sets the basis for the matrilineal/matriarchal
society. Auset is the legal heiress. [Details of matriarchal
I society in chapter 22.]



2 - The, Lcjyp/nin Model 25
• The story of* Ausar (Osiris) and Auset ( IsisJ is the Love Story. With Ausar and Auset, there is a harmonious polarity: brother and sister, twin souls, husband and
wife. This is a reflection of the ancient and Baladi be
liefs of the Two Lands [see chapter 5].
• The Ancient Egyptian word for brother and husband
is the same word, sn, as well as the word for sister and
wife, sn.t. Therefore, we must be cautious when encountering sn and sn.t in certain texts, and not to draw too many conclusions about incest and the like.
Both Ausar (Osiris) and Auset were adored by the Egyptians. But their brother Set (Seth) hated Ausar and was
jealous of his popularity. Set managed to pick a fight with
Ausar, murdered him, and cut his body into 14 pieces (one
for each night of the waning moon), which he scattered all
over Egypt. Ausar is associated with the waxing and waning of
the moon and the cyclical nature of the universe. [More
about this is shown throughout this book.]
Auset went searching for the scattered parts of her be
loved Ausar. One re-members and re-collects in order to heal, and
in order never to forget. Auset wanted to put Ausar
together, so as to put herself together, i.e. to bring about
union within herself.
After Ausar's death, Set, as the husband of Nebt-het,
became the King of Egypt, and ruled as a tyrant.
Ausar's faithful wife Auset found every part of her husband's body, except the phallus, which had been swallowed by a fish. She assembled his body, making the first Egyptian mummy.



26 Tgyptum Cosmology. - THS cAmrilated Zfnumr&e
At the time of his death, Ausar and Auset had no children, but by mystical means, the re-membered mummy of
Ausar was resurrected for one night and slept with Auset (This is equivalent to being impregnated by the Holy Ghost).
As a result, Auset conceived a son. He was called Heru
(Horus) and was raised secretly in the marshes of the Nile
Delta.
• This action symbolizes reincarnation and spiritual re
birth — a key to understanding the Egyptian belief in
life after death.
• The supernatural conception and the virgin birth of Heru
found their way into Christianity.
When Set heard about the new child (Heru), Set went to kill the newborn. Hearing that Set was coming, Auset
hid her son in Buto.
I
This is the source of the story in which Herod, upon
hearing about the birth of the biblical Jesus, set out to
destroy all the newborn males.
As soon as Heru (Horus) had grown to manhood, he
challenged Set for the right to the throne. Heru and Set had
several battles and challenges. Finally, both Heru (the resurrected Ausar) and his uncle Set went to the council of neteru to determine who should rule. Both presented their
cases.
The council of neteru decided that Ausar/Heru should
regain the throne of Egypt, and Set should rule over the
deserts/wastelands. • Physical force did not decide the outcome of the "Great Quarrel" (the struggle between Heru and Set), rather a
jury of their peers (council of neteru) settled the mat
ter.



I fie "Egyptian Model 27
• Compromise and the principle of co-existence ended
the conflict.
During the battle, Set snatched away the eye of Heru,
and threw it into the celestial ocean. Tehuti (Thoth) recov
ered the eye which was later identified with the moon and became a very popular symbol of protection. It was this
Eye that Heru used to revive his sleeping father. Ausar was
resurrected as a soul to rule the Netherworld, Ausar be
came for the Egyptians the spirit of the past, the neter (god)
of the Dead and a hope for resurrection and afterlife.
Another version of the story indicates that as soon as
she heard of this tragedy, Auset(Isis) set out to search for the fragments of her husband's body, embalmed them with the help of the neter, Anbu(Anubis), and buried them wherever they were found and built shrines at these locations. According to this version of the story, the head of Ausar (Osiris) was buried at Abtu(Abydos). The heart was buried on the island of Philae, near Aswan. The phallus was thrown into the Nile and was swallowed by a fish. For
this reason the eating of fish was forbidden to the priests.
The similarities between the Egyptian Ausar/Auset/
Heru (Osiris/Isis/Horus) mystery play and the Gospel story
are striking. Both accounts are practically the same, e.g. the
supernatural conception, the divine birth, the struggles against the enemy in the wilderness, and the resurrection
from the dead to eternal life.
The main difference between the two accounts is that
those faithful to the bible consider the Gospel tale to be a historical fact, while the Ancient Egyptians considered the
Ausar/Auset/Heru story to be — a story (parable).



Chapter 3
All Id "Number
The Ancient Egyptians had a scientific and organic system of observing reality. Modern-day science is based on observing everything as dead (inanimate). Modern physi
cal formulas in our science studies almost always exclude
the vital phenomena throughout statistical analyses. For
the Ancient and Baladi Egyptians, the universe — in whole
and in part — is animated.
In the animated world of Ancient Egypt, numbers did not simply designate quantities but instead were considered
to be concrete definitions of energetic formative principles
of nature. The Egyptians called these energetic principles
neteru (gods).
For Egyptians, numbers were not just odd and even they were male and female. Every part of the universe was/
is a male or a female. There is no neutral (a thing). Unlike
in English, where something is he, she, or it, in Egypt there was only he or she.
Egyptians manifested their knowledge of number mys
ticism in all aspects of their lives. The evidence that Egypt possessed this knowledge is commanding. As examples:
1 - The concept of animated numbers in Ancient Egypt were eloquently referred to by Plutarch, in Moralia Vol.
V, describing the 3:4:5 triangle:



3 , 411 7d 'Nuuihi i
The upright, therefore, may be likened to the male,
the base to the female, and the hypotenuse to the child of both, and so Ausar [Osiris) may be regarded as the origin, Auset [Isis] as the recipient, and Heru [Horns]
as perfected result. Three is the first perfect odd number: four is a square whose side is the even number
two; but five is in some ways like to its father, and in
some ways like to its mother, being made up of three
and two. And panta [all] is a derivative of pente [five], and they speak of counting as "numbering by fives". Five makes a square of itself.
3 Ausar
4
Auset
Ausar Auset Heru
3 odd male upright
4 (square of 2) even female base
5
offspring hypotenuse
The vitality and the interactions between these num
bers show how they are male and female, positive and nega
tive, vertical and horizontal, ...etc.



30 Lgyptian Cosmology - Tt\e%Animhted 'Universe
2 - Plutarch noted that One is not an (odd) number when
he wrote, three is the first perfect odd number. For the
Egyptians, one was not a number, but the essence of the underlying principle of number, all other numbers
being made of it. One represents Unity: the Absolute as unpolarized energy. One is neither odd nor even but both, because if added to an odd number it makes it
even, and vice-versa. So it combines the opposites of
odd and even, and all the other opposites in the uni
verse. Unity is a perfect, eternal, undifferentiated con
sciousness.
3
- The Ancient Egyptian method of writing the numbers reflects their total understanding of the cosmic functions of each number. Their numbers were not abstracts like our "modern" numbers. [A few examples will ex
plain this point, in the next chapters.]
4
- The heading of the Ancient Egyptian papyrus known as the Rhind (so-called "Mathematical") Papyrus (1848
1801 BCE) reads,
"Rules for enquiring into nature and for knowing all
that exists, every mystery, every secret".
The intent is very clear — that Ancient Egyptians be
lieved and set the rules for numbers and their interac
tions (so-called mathematics) as the basis for "all that
exists".
Egyptological academia misses the forest AND the trees

splitting hair over what they perceive as merely math
ematical exercises in these papyri. What is even worse, is that these academicians have no knowledge of the
practical application of "mathematics" in real life.



3 - i 'III Id 'Nuiulu i 1
5 - The Ancient Egyptian mode of calculation had a dired relationship with natural processes, as well as meta
physical ones. Even the language employed in the Egyp
tian papyri serves to promote this sense of vitality, of
living interaction. We see this understanding as an
example in Item no. 38 of the Egyptian papyrus known as the Rhind (so-called "Mathematical") Papyrus, which
reads,
"I go three times into the hekat (a bushel, unit of vol
ume), a seventh ofme is added to me and I return fully
satisfied.

- The famous Ancient Egyptian hymn of Leiden Papyrus J350 confirms that number symbolism had been practiced in Egypt, at least since the Old Kingdom (25752150 BCE). The Leiden Papyrus consists of an extended
composition, describing the principle aspects of the an
cient creation narratives. The system of enumeration,
in the Papyrus, identifies the principle/aspect of creation and matches each one with its symbolic number.
This Egyptian Papyrus consists of 27 stanzas, numbered from 1 to 9, then from 10 to 90 in tens, then from 100 to 900 in hundreds; only 21 have been preserved. The first word of each is a sort of pun on the number con
cerned.
The numbering system of this Egyptian Papyrus by it
self is significant. The numbers 1 to 9, and then the
powers 10, 20, 30, etc., now come to constitute the en
ergetic foundations of physical forms.
The different parts of the Leiden Papyrus will be discussed in conjunction with number mysticism/evalua
tion in the next chapters.

- The Ancient Egyptian name for the largest temple in Egypt, namely the Karnak Temple complex, is Apetsut, which means Enumerator of the Places. The temple's name speaks for itself. This temple started in the Middle Kingdom in ca. 1971 BCE, and was added to continuously for the next 1,500 years. The design
and enumeration, in this temple, are consistent with
the creation numerical codes.
The Egyptian concept of number symbolism was subsequently popularized in the West by and through the Greek Pythagoras (ca. 580-500 BCE). It is a known fact that
Pythagoras studied for about 20 years in Egypt, soon after Egypt was open to Greek exploration and immigration (in the 7th century BCE).
Pythagoras and his immediate followers left nothing of
their own writing. Yet, Western Academia attributed to
Pythagoras and the so-called Pythagoreans, an open-ended
list of major achievements. They were issued a blank check by Western academia.
Pythagoras and his followers are said to see numbers as
divine concepts, ideas of the God who created a universe of
infinite variety, and satisfying order, to a numerical pattern.
The same principles were stated more than 13 centuries before Pythagoras' birth, in the heading of the Egyptian's Rhind Papyrus, which promises,
"Rules for enquiring into nature and for knowing all that
exists, every mystery, every secret"

Chapter A
Nun, The Subjective Being
Every Egyptian creation text begins with the same ba
sic belief that before the beginning of things, there was a
liqnidy primeval abyss — everywhere, endless, and without
boundaries or directions. Egyptians called this cosmic ocean/
watery chaos, Nu/Ny/Nun — the unpolarized state of matter.
Scientists agree with the Ancient Egyptian description
of the origin of the universe as being an abyss. Scientists
refer to this abyss as neutron soup, where there are neither electrons nor protons, and only neutrons forming one huge
extremely dense nucleus. Such chaos, in the pre-creation state, was caused by the compression of matter, i.e. atoms did not exist in their normal states, but were squeezed so
closely together, that many atomic nuclei were crowded into
a space previously occupied by a single normal atom. Under such conditions, the electrons of these atoms were squeezed out of their orbits and move about freely (a degen
erate state).
Nu/Ny/Nun is the "Subjective Being", the symbol of the
unformed, undefined, undifferentiated energy/matter, inert or
inactive, the uncreated state before the creation; it cannot
be the cause of its transformation.

Ma-at, The Cosmic Order
For the deeply religious people of Egypt, the creation of
the universe was not a physical event (Big Bang) that just happened. It was an orderly event that was pre-planned and executed according to an orderly Divine Law that gov
erns the physical and metaphysical worlds. So, we read in the Book of Knowing the Creations of Ra and Overcoming Apep (Apophis), known as the Bremner-Rhind Papyrus:
7 had not yet found a place upon which I could stand. I
conceived the Divine Plan of Law or Order (Maa) to make
all forme. I was alone, I had not yet emitted Shu, nor had I
yet emitted Tefnut, nor existed any other who could act
together with me.
"
Wia-aX, is the netert (goddess) that personifies the prin
ciple of cosmic order. The concept by which not only men, but also the neteru (gods) themselves were governed and
without which the neteru (gods) are functionless.
Amen, The Occult Force
Egyptians reasoned that one could explain creation not
from within creation, but only from outside it. The Creator
is not the created universe. In the Egyptian papyrus known
as the Leiden Papyrus, the neter (god), Amen/Amon/Amun
(which means hidden), represents the hidden or occult force
underlying creation. He is the Breath of Life. Even though
he is indefinable himself, he is the reason why the universe
can be defined.
The closest Egyptian term to God is Amen-Renef (He Whose Real Essence is Unknown).

The Becoming One
Creation is the sorting out (giving definition to / bring
ing order to) all the chaos (the undifferentiated energy/matter and consciousness) of the primeval state. All of the An
cient Egyptian accounts of creation exhibited this with well
defined, clearly demarcated stages.
The first stage was the self-creation of
the Supreme Being as creator and Being, i.e. the passage from Subjective Being (Nu/Ny/
Nun) to Objective Being (Atum). In simple
human terms, this is equivalent to the mo
ment that one passes from sleeping (uncon
scious state, subjective being) to being aware
of oneself (gaining consciousness, objective
being). It is like standing on solid ground. Ra-Atum
This stage of creation was represented by the Egyptian sages as Atum rising out of Nu/Ny/Nun. In
the Unas (so-called Pyramid) Texts, there is the following
invocation:
Salutation to thee, Atum,
Salutation to thee, he who comee into being by himself!
Thou art high in this thy name High Mound,
Thou comeet into being in this thy name Khepri (Becom
ing One). [§1537]

The sequence of creation is found in many Ancient Egyptian texts. The most detailed and clearly described sequence is found in the above-mentioned Bremner-Rhind Papyrus, dating from the 4 th century BCE (and believed to be a reproduction from an Old Kingdom text, based on its writ

ing style). A portion of this papyrus, known as the Book of Knowing the Creations of Ra and Overcoming Apep (Apophis),
reads in part:
- / conceived in my own heart; there came into being a vast
number of forms of divine beings as the forms of children
and the forms of their children
/ it was who aroused desire with my hand; I masturbated
with my hand, I poured out of my mouth. I spat out Shu, I spat out Tefnut
- After having become one neter (god), there were (now)
three neteru (gods) in me
- / created all snakes, and all that came into being with them."
The text above refers to the Ancient Egyptians con
cepts (among other things) of:
1 - Creation as a Big Bang, with the separation of parts
(children) and smaller Parts (their children):
there came into being a vast number of forms of di
vine beings as the forms of children and the forms of
their children. .
.
2
- The duality of creation symbolized by Shu and Tefnut:
/ spat out Shu, I spat out Tefnut.
3
- The concept of trinity: After having become one neter (god), there were
[now] three neteru (gods) in me.
4
- Creation of space/volume, wherein the universe must
be manifested:

them. Snakes are the symbol of delineation of space.

The world, as we know it, is held together by a law that
is based on the balanced dual nature of all things (wholes,
units). Among noticable balanced pairs are: male and fe
male, odd and even, negative and positive, active and pas
sive, light and darkness, yes and no, true and false — each
pair represents a different aspect of the same fundamental
principle of polarity. And each aspect partakes of the na
ture of unity and of the nature of duality. Sample Egyptian
applications of the universal dual nature include:
1 - The pre-creation state consisted of four pairs of prime
val dual-gendered twins. [See chapter 11.]
2
- The Egyptians perceived the
universe in terms of a dual
ism between Ma-at — Truth
and Order — and disorder. Amen-Renef summoned the cosmos out of undifferenti
ated chaos, by distinguishing
the two, by giving voice to
the ultimate ideal of Truth.
Ma-at, as shown here, is usually portrayed in the double
form — Maati.

- The dual principle in the creation state was ex
pressed in the pair of Shu
and Tefnut. The pair of husband and wife is the characteristic Egyptian way of expressing duality
and polarity. This dual nature was manifested in Ancient Egyptian texts and
traditions, since its recov- Tefnut Shu
ered archeological findings. The most ancient texts of the Old Kingdom, namely the Pyramid Texts §1652, ex
press the dual nature:
. . .and though didst spit out as Shu, and didst spit
out as Tefnut.
This is a very powerful analogy, because we use the
term "spitting image" to mean exactly like the origin.
Another way of expressing the intent of the dual na
ture is present in the Ancient Egyptian text, known as the Bremner-Rkind Papyrus:
I was anterior to the Two Anteriors that I made, for I
had priority over the Two Anteriors that I made, for
my name was anterior to theirs, for I made them an
terior to the Two Anteriors ...

- The Egyptian Pharaoh was always referred to as the Lord of the Two Lands. Western aeademia cavalierly stated that the Two Lands are Upper and Lower Egypt.
There is not a single Ancient Egyptian reference to con
firm their notion, or even to define such a frontier between Upper and Lower Egypt.
Throughout Ancient Egyptian temples, you will find numerous symbolic represen
tations relating to the ceremony of Uniting the Two Lands, where two neteru are shown tying the papyrus and
lotus plants. Neither plant is
native to any specific area in
Egypt. The most common representation shows the twin neteru, Hapi (a mirrorimage of each other), each as unisex with one breast.
The term, Two Lands, is very familiar to the Baladi
Egyptians, who refer to it in their daily life. It is their
strong belief that there are Two Lands — the one we live on, and another one where our identical twins (of
the opposite sex) live. The two are subject to the same
experiences from date of birth to date of death. [More
about this concept throughout this book, and particularly
chapter 21.]
You and your "Siamese" twin, who "apparently" sepa
rate at birth, will re-unite again at the moment of death.
The Baladi Egyptian Enumerators describe, in their lamentations after the death of a person, how the deceased is being prepared to join his/her counterpart (of
the opposite sex), AS IF it is a marriage ceremony. This
is reminiscent of the many symbolic illustrations in An
cient Egypt of the tying the knot of the Two Lands. To
be married is to tie the knot.

As far back as the Unas (so-called "Pyramid") Texts, one finds that the Pharaoh Unas (2356-2323 BCE) unites/joins with Auset (Isis) immediately after departing the earthly realm. This is based on the premise
that since every man is Ausar in his "dead" form, each joins his/her counterpart (Auset in the case of a man),
at the moment of the earthly departure.
6
- The perpetual cycle of existence — the cycle of life and
death — is symbolized by Ra (Re) and Ausar (Osiris).
Ra is the living neter who descends into death to be
come Ausar — the neter of the dead. Ausar ascends and comes to life again as Ra. The creation is continu
ous: it is a flow of life progressing towards death. But out of death, a new Ra is to be born, sprouting new life. Ra is the cosmic principle of energy that moves toward death, and Ausar represents the process of rebirth. Thus, the terms of life and death become interchangeable: life means slow dying, death means resurrection to new life. The dead person in death is identified with
Ausar, but he will come to life again, and be identified with Ra.
The perpetual cycle of Ausar and Ra dominates the Ancient Egyptian texts, such as:
• In The Book of the Coming Forth By Light, both Ausar and Ra live, die, and are born again. In the Netherworld, the souls of Ausar and Ra meet [see il
lustration from the Papyrus of Ani, on the next page], and
are united to form an entity, described so eloquently:
lam His Two Souls in his Twins.
In Chapter 17 of The Book of the Coming Forth By
Light, the deceased, identified with Ausar, says:
I am yesterday, I know the morrow.



5 - T/ic 'Dualistu \(i/it/< / ;

And the Egyptian commentary to this passage explains:
What is this?—Ausar is yesterday, Ra is tomorrow?
• In the tomb of Queen
Nefertari (wife of Ramses II), is a well known representa
tion of the dead solar neter (god), as a mummiform body with the head of a ram, accom
panied by an inscription, right
and left:
This is Ra who comes to rest in Ausar This is Ausar who comes to rest in Ra.
• The Litany of Ra is basically a detailed amplifica
tion of a short passage of Chapter 17 of The Book of
the Corning Forth by Light, describing the merging of
Ausar and Ra into a Twin Soul.

- The eternal opposites, Set
(Seth) and Heru (Horus), are
assigned equal roles in representations of symbolic
rites, relating to the cer
emony of Uniting the Two Lands, which is portrayed
on the limestone reliefs in Lisht, near Men-Nefer (Memphis) . The symbolism is powerful, for the two op- Heru Set
posites are the One in a po
larized state, whereby Set
personifies the unevolved desire, and Heru represents the
evolving desire.
8
- Both Heru and Tehuti are shown in numerous illustrations in the Ancient Egyptian temples, performing the symbolic Uniting of the Two Lands. Heru personifies con
science, mind, intellect,
and is identified with the
heart. Tehuti personifies
manifestation and deliverance, and is identified
with the tongue.
Heru Tehuti
One thinks with the heart, and acts with the tongue. These two complimentary requirements were described
on the Shabaka Stele (716-701 BCE):
The Heart thinks all that it wishes, and the Tongue
delivers all that it wishes.

- One of the Egyptian King's title was Lord of the Diadem of the
Vulture and of the Serpent. The
diadem is the earthly symbol of the divine man, the King. The
diadem consists of the serpent
(symbol of the divine intellec
tual function), and the vulture (symbol of the recon
ciliation function). The serpent represents intellect, the faculty by which man can break down the whole
into its constituent parts, just like a serpent that swal
lows its prey in whole, and then digests it by breaking
it down into digestible parts.
The divine man must be able both to distinguish and
to reconcile. Since these dual powers reside in man's
brain, the form of the serpent's body (in the diadem)
follows the actual physiological sutures of the brain, in
which these particularly human faculties are seated.
This dual function of the brain is vivid in its two sides.
The part of the diadem located in the middle of the
forehead represents the third eye, with all its intellec
tual faculties.

The physical and metaphysical role of Three was recognized in Ancient Egypt; for each unity is a triple power
and a double nature. This was eloquently illustrated in the
Ancient Egyptian texts and traditions, whereby the self-cre
ated neter (god), Atum, spat out Shu and Tefnut, then placed his arms around them, and his ka entered into them, to be
come One again. It is the Three that are Two that are One.
This action generated the First Trinity, the first building block. This is made clear in the Ancient Egyptian papyrus known as the Bremner-Rhind Papyrus,
After having become one neter (god), there were [now]
three neteru (gods) in me [i.e. Atum, Shu, and Tefnut/.
In the Ancient Egyptian texts, Shu and Tefnut are de
scribed as the ancestors of all the neteru (gods/goddesses)
who begat all beings in the universe. This triangulation of Atum-Shu-Tefnut ensured a continuous relationship between
the Creator and all subsequent created.
The concept of trinity in Ancient Egypt is also found
in the following examples:



6 - Ti'w Triangulatian d i reatUm 47
1 - Stanza 300 of the Ancient Egyptians1 Leiden Papyrus declares the unity in one Being of the three principles, Amen, Ra, and Ptah. Stanza 300 reads in part:
"Three are all the neteru: Amen, Pa, Ptah... hie hidden
name is Amen. Ra belongs to him as hie face, Ptah is
his body". A stunning example of a Holy Trinity.
2
- Other examples of familiar Ancient Egyptian triads are:
Amen - Mut - Khonsu
Ausar (Osiris) -Auset (Isis) - Heru (Horns) Ptah - Sekhmet - Nefertum Ptah - 5okar - Ausar (Osiris)
3
- The triple shrine is the main feature in most Egyptian
temples, to enshrine the triple power (three neteru) of
each temple.
4
- Each small locality in Ancient Egypt had its own triad
of neteru, i.e. identifiable building block. These local
triads were not in conflict with each other — they were the metaphysical building blocks of each locality.
5 - For the Ancient Egyptians, Three/Triads/Trinities/Tri
angles are one and the same. There was no functional
difference between geometric triangles, musical triads, or any of the many trinities of Ancient Egypt. The clearest example was explained by Plutarch regarding
the 3:4:5 triangle, in Moralia Vol V:
The Egyptians hold in high honor the most beautiful of the triangles, since they liken the nature of the Universe most
closely to it... [see more of text on pgs 28,29.]
In other words, triangles in their different forms repre
sent different natures in the universe.

Four is the number signifying solidity and stability. The
significance of the number 4 is shown in the following examples from Ancient Egypt:
1 - Egyptian texts state that the pre-creation chaos pos
sessed characteristics that were identified with four
pairs of primordial powers/forces. Each pair represents
the primeval dual-gendered twins — the masculine/
feminine aspect. The four pairs are equivalent to the
four forces of the universe (the weak force, the strong
force, gravity, and electromagnetism).
2
- Ancient Egyptians had four main cosmological teach
ing centers at: Onnu {Heliopolis), Men-Nefer (Memphis) , Ta-Apet (Thebes), and Khmunu [Hermopoils) . Each cen
ter revealed one of the principle phases or aspects of
genesis.
The four pairs of the pre-creation state are a constant
theme at all four centers.
Egypt now has 4 Sufi Teaching Ways, which were created in the 11 th century CE, to maintain the Ancient
Egyptian traditions under the islamic rule.

- Egyptians used the four simple phenomena (fire, ;nr.
earth and water) to describe the f unctional roles of the
four elements necessary to matter. Water is the sum
the composite principle of fire, earth and air. Water is also a substance over and above them. These concepts were expressed in the Ancient Egyp
tian texts as Nu/Nun, the primeval (liquid) water that
contains all elements of the universe. Plutarch con
firmed that about Ancient Egyptians, in his Moralia,
Vol V:
For the nature of water, being the source and origin of
all things, created out of itself three primal material
substances: Earth, Air, and Fire.

Tlie Tiftfi Star
The significance and function of number
five, in Ancient Egypt, is indicated by the manner in which it was written. The number 5 in Ancient Egypt was written as 2 (II) above 3 (III),
or as a five-pointed star. In other words, num
ber 5 is the result of the relationship between
number 2 and number 3.
Two symbolizes the power of multiplicity, the female, mutable receptacle, while Three symbolizes the male. This
was the 'music of the spheres', the universal harmonies played out between these two primal male and female universal symbols of Ausar (Osiris) and Auset (Isis), whose heavenly marriage produced the child, Heru (Horus). Plutarch confirmed this Egyptian wisdom in Moralia Vol V:
Three [Osiris] is the first perfect odd number: four is a square whose side is the even number two [Isis]; but five [Horus] is
in some ways like to its father, and in some ways like to its
mother, being made up of three and two. And panta (all) is a derivative of pente (five), and they speak of counting as "numbering by fives".
Five incorporates the principles of polarity (II) and reconciliation (III). All phenomena, without exception, are po
lar in nature, treble in principle. Therefore, five is the key

And panta (all) is a derivative of pente (five).

In Ancient Egypt, the symbol for a star was drawn w ith

tiny and the number five.
The five-pointed stars are the homes of the successfully departed souls, as stated in the Unas Funerary Texts (known
as Pyramid Texts), Line 904:
be a soul as a living star ...
Heru (Horus) is the personification of the goal of all
initiated teachings, and therefore is associated with the num
ber five, for he is the fifth, after Ausar, Auset, Set and Nebt
het. Heru is also the number 5 in the right angle triangle of
3:4:5, as confirmed by Plutarch.

Tfie Cubical Sixtfi
Stanza 6 of the Ancient Egyptian Leiden Pa
pyrus is the first that remains intact of the unit
series of numbers 1-9. Because of the six direc
tions, 6 is the number par excellence of space, vol
ume and time, and thus this stanza deals with all the regions which are under the dominion of Amen-Ra.
Six is the cosmic number of the material world and therefore is the number chosen by the Egyptians to symbol
ize both time and space. Time and space are two sides of
the same coin, which is perfectly represented in the science
of astronomy and its application — astrology. Scientists now
agree that there is a very close connection between space
and time — so close that you can't have one without the
other.

cient Egyptians, was and is based on the number six, or its multiples. The whole day was/is 24 (6 x 4) hours, consisting of 12 (6x2) hours of daytime, and 12 (6 x 2) hours of nighttime. The hour was/is 60 (6 x 10)

2- Space (Volume) - requires 6 directions of extension to define it: up and down, backwards and forwards,
left and right. The cube, the perfect 6-sided figure, was
used in Egypt as the symbol for space (volume).
The Egyptian was highly conscious of
the box-like structure, which is the model of the earth or the material
world. The form of statuary called the
"cube statue" are prevalent since the Middle Kingdom (2040-1783 BCE). The subject was integrated into the cu
bic form of the stone. In these cube stat
ues, there is a powerful sense of the subject emerging from the prison of the
cube. Its symbolic significance is that the spiritual prin
ciple is emerging from the material world. The earthly
person is placed unmistakably in material existence.
The Divine person is shown sitting squarely on a cube i.e. mind over
matter.
Other traditions, such as the Pla
tonic and Pythagorean, adopted the same concept of the Egyptian cu
bic representation of the material
world.
So, the symbolism of "thinking outside the box'\ and
to "try to get out of the box" (in the theatrical mime
performance), are originally Egyptian practices.



Chapter 10
Tfie Cyclical Seven
The significance and function of the number 7 in Ancient Egypt is indicated by how they
wrote it. Since 7 signified the union of spirit (Three III) and matter (Four INI), it was accordingly written in such format (shown here) . One
of the forms that traditionally expresses the meaning of 7 is the pyramid, which combines the square base symbolizing the four elements, and the triangular sides
symbolizing the three modes of spirit.
Ausar is the 7th in the process of creation: Nun, Atum,
Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut and Ausar. It is Ausar who is the first
born of the union of heaven (Nut) and earth (Geb), i.e. the
union of spirit (Nut) and matter (Geb).
It is therefore that Ausar (Osiris) is associated with the
number 7 and its multiples. Seven is the number of pro
cess, growth, and the underlying cyclical aspects of the uni
verse.
Seven of something frequently makes a complete set
the 7 days of the week, 7 colors of the spectrum, 7 notes of
the musical scale, etc. The cells of the human body are to
tally renewed every 7 years.
The intimate relationship between Ausar and 7 is reflected in these few examples, from the Temple of Ausar at
Abtu (Abydos):

The Tet (Djed) pillar, as the sacred
symbol of Ausar, has 7 steps. This is reminiscent of the doctrine of chakras in the Indian kundalini system of yoga, that is much younger than the Ancient Egyptian traditions. The chakras are
centers in the psychophysical structure
of man that accord with the 7 constitu
ents of man, along with the link that draws them together, namely the human backbone.
The 7 centers of Tet (Djed) represent the 7 metaphorical rungs of the ladder, leading from matter to spirit. Since man is a microcosm of the cosmic
pattern, Tet represents a microcosm of the universal cosmology.
It is hard to separate the number 7 from Ausar. [More
relationships will be detailed in later chapters, especially chapter
17.1

Seven is the end of a cycle. Eight is the
beginning of a new cycle — an octave.
As will be detailed in the next chapter,
Ancient and Baladi Egyptians believe that the universe consists of 9 realms (7 heavens and 2
lands/earths). Our earthly existence is the 8 th
realm (first land/earth).
At number 8, we find the human being created in the
image of God, the First Principle. Our earthly existence at
the 8 th realm is a replication and not a duplication — an
octave. Octave is the future state of the past. The continu
ance of creation is a series of replications — octaves.
In Egypt, the well-known text, Coffin ofPetamon [Cairo
Museum item no. 1160], states:
lam One who becomes Two, who becomes Four, who becomes Eight, and then I am One again.
This new unity (One again) is not identical, but analo
gous, to the first unity (I am One). The old unity is no longer,
a new unity has taken its place: The King is Dead, Long Live
the King. It is a renewal or self-replication. And to account
for the principle of self-replication, 8 terms are necessary.



/ / - Lhjlit, THe Octave 57
Musically, the renewal theme of 8 terms corresponds to the octave because it reaches
through all 8 intervals of the
scale (the 8 white keys of the keyboard).
For example, an octave can
be 2 successive C's {Do's) on a
musical scale, as illustrated herein on the keyboard.
octave
Eight is the number of Tehuti, and at
Khmunu (Hermopolis), Tehuti {Hermes to the Greeks, Mercury to the Romans) is
called the Master of the City of Eight. Te
huti gives man access to the mysteries of the manifested world, which were sym
bolized by the number 8. As we will find
out [in chapter 15], the manifestation of creation came through the word (soundwaves) delivered from Ra by Te

Stanza 80 of the Ancient Egyptian Leiden Papyrus retraces the Creation as told in Khmunu (Hermopolis), which
deals with the Ogdoad — the Primordial Eight — which comprised the first metamorphosis of Amen-Ra, the mysterious, hidden one who is recognized as Ta-Tenen at Men-Nefer (Memphis), then Ka-Mut-f at Ta-Apet (Thebes), yet all the while remaining One. Therefore, the manifestation of creation in 8 terms are present in all four Ancient Egyptian cosmological centers:
• At Men-Nefer (Memphis), Ptah, in his 8 forms, created
the universe.

At Onnu(Heliopolis), Atum created the 8 divine beings.
At Khmunu(Hermopolis), 8 primeval neteru — the

At Ta-Apet (Thebes), Amun/Aman/Amen after creating
himself in secret, created the Ogdoad.
The manifestation of creation through 8 terms is also

Let Creation Begin
As stated earlier, the laws and nature of the created universe were pre-planned before the actual creation. About
15 billion years ago, when it was time for action, the con
densed energy in Nun — the neutron soup — began building up, until it finally exploded and expanded outward. The explosion was loud enough to be called the Big Bang.
The Ancient Egyptian texts likewise repeatedly stressed
that sound was the cause of creation. [More about sound and
creation in chapter 15.]
The divine sound (Big Bang) transformed the poten
tial inert energy/matter in Nun into the parts of the uni
verse as differentiated, orderly, structured — kinetic ener
gies — in the form of objects, thoughts, forces, physical phenomena, etc.
Transforming one type of energy (potential) into an
other type (kinetic) made the universe come to life, in whole
and in its constituent parts.
It is all a matter of energies.



62 'Egyptian CcMnwlagg - Tfie Animated 'Unwer&e
A Matter of Energies
The Ancient and Baladi Egyptians made/make no distinction between a metaphysical state of being and one with
a material body. Such a distinction is a mental illusion. We
exist on a number of different levels at once, from the most
physical to the most metaphysical. Einstein agreed with
the same principles.
Since Einstein's relativity theory, it has been known
and accepted that matter is a form of energy — a coagulation or condensation of energy. Energy is made up of mol
ecules rotating or vibrating at various rates of speed. In the
"physical" world, molecules rotate at a very slow and con
stant rate of speed. That is why things appear to be solid,
for our earthly senses. The slower the speed, the more dense
or solid the thing. In the metaphysical (spirit) world, the
molecules vibrate at a much faster, or ethereal dimension
— where things are freer and less dense.
In this light, the universe is basically a hierarchy of
energies, at different orders of density. Our senses have
some access to the densest form of energy, which is matter.
The hierarchy of energies is interrelated, and each level is
sustained by the level below it. This hierarchy of energies
is set neatly into a vast matrix of deeply interfaced natural
laws. It is both physical and metaphysical.
This matrix of energies came as a result of the initial act of creation and the subsequent effects of the Big Bang that created the universe. This matrix of energies was identified with the neteru (gods/goddesses) in Ancient Egypt.
The presence of energy in everything was long recognized by the Ancient and Baladi Egyptians. That there are
cosmic energies (neteru) in every stone, mineral, wood, etc.,
is stated clearly in the Shabaka Stele (8 th Century BCE):



12 - (AnimUm, The Energized UniBerte 6 I
And so the neteru (aods) entered into their bodies, in the
form of every sort of wood, of every sort of mineral, as
every sort of clay, as everything which grows upon him
(meaning earth ).
The universal energy matrix (known in its pre-creation state as Nun/Ny/Nu), encompasses the world as a product of a complex system of relationships among people (living and
dead), animals, plants, and natural and supernatural phe
nomena. This rationale is often called Animism because
of its central premise that all things are animated (energized)
by life forces. Each minute particle of everything is in con
stant motion, i.e. energized, as acknowledged in the kinetic
theory. In other words, everything is animated (energized)

animals, trees, rocks, birds, even the air, sun, and moon.
The faster form of energies — these invisible energies
in the universe — are called spirits by many. Spirits/ener
gies are organized at different orders of densities, which
relates to the different speeds of molecules. These faster (in
visible) energies inhabit certain areas, or are associated with
particular natural phenomena. Spirits (energies) exist in fam
ily-type groups (i.e. related to each other).
Energies may occupy, at will, a more condensed energy
(matter), such as human, animal, plant, or any form. The
spirit animates the human body at birth, and leaves it at death. Sometimes, more than one energy spirit enters a body. We often hear a person 'not feeling himself/herself, or is
'temporarily insane', 'possessed', 'beside oneself, or a per
son has multiple personalities. The energies (spirits) have an effect on all of us, to one degree or another.
Since the created universe is orderly, its energy matrix
is likewise a well-oiled machine with nine interpenetrating
and interacting realms.



64 Egyptian Cosmology. - Tfie Animated rUnwer&e
The Nine Realms
Ancient and Baladi Egyptians believe that the universal energy matrix consists of nine realms, which are com
monly classified as seven heavens (metaphysical realms) and
two earths (physical realms). God lives in the most distant heaven. Angels (neteru) inhabit heavens two through six.
Ancestor spirits inhabit the heaven nearest the two earths.
The two earthly realms are commonly known as The Two Lands. In the previous chapter, we followed the sig
nificance of the number 8, as our physical (earthly) realm.
The last realm — number 9 — is where our complimentary opposite exists. The Siamese twins who live in realms 8
and 9 are in perfect harmony. In musical terms, the ratio/
relationship 8:9 represents the Perfect Tone.
Beings who are more spiritually aware reside on a higher
level, and less evolved souls are on a lower level. We can
never go to a higher level until we earn it. However, those
beings on a higher level can go to a lower sphere; and in
many cases, they do just that in order to aid and assist those
souls who are not as aware.
The Ancient Egyptian texts clearly allude to climbing/
passing through levels/steps; an example can be found in
the Unas Funerary (Pyramid) Texts at Saqqara — Utterance 215 §149, from the Sarcophagus Chamber:
thy arms are Hapy and Dua-mutef,
which thou needest to ascend to heaven,
and thou ascendest; thy lege are Imeety and Kebeh-senuf, which thou needeet to descend to the lower sky, and thou descendest.



12 - cAnimi&m, The Energized Zlniif£T6£ 6 >
The text Gust one example out of ninny) clearly states:
"...ascend to heaven. ..descend to the lower sky".
The eoneept of 9 realms are consistent with the con
cept of the Grand Ennead — the unity of 9 — the generator
of the manifested creation. [See more information about the
Grand Ennead in Chapter 14.]
The energies in the 9 realms form an orderly interac
tive hierarchy. [Interacting between energies is shown in chap
ters 24, 25, 28, 29, and 30.]
The neteru who are in high heavens/realms will be dis
cussed in the following chapters.

'Neterw,
Neteru and Angels
The neteru (gods)
are the personification of the energies/powers/forces that,
through their actions
and interactions, created, maintained, and continue to maintain
the universe.
The neteru, and
their functions, were later acknowledged by others as angels. The Song of Moses in Deuteronomy (32:43), as found in a cave at Qumran near the Dead Sea, mentions the word
gods in the plural: "Rejoice, O heavens, with him; and do obei
sance to him, ge gods ". When the passage is quoted in the New Testament (Hebrews, 1:6), the word gods is substi
tuted with 'angels of God\
The spheres of neteru (known also as angels and arch
angels in Christianity) are hierarchical among the levels/
realms of the universe [as described in the previous chapter].

Pictorial Symbolism of the Neteru
In order to simplify and convey the scientific and philo
sophical meanings of the neteru (gods), some fixed repre
sentations were utilized. As a result, the figures of Ptah.
Ausar (Osiris), Amen, Heru (Horus), Mut, etc., became the
signs of such attrihutes/functions/forces/energies. These pictorial symbols were intended merely to fix
the attention or represent abstract ideas, and were not in
tended to be looked upon as real personages.
A symbol, by definition, is not what it represents, but
what it stands for, what it suggests. A symbol reveals to the
mind a reality other than itself. Words convey information; symbols evoke understanding.
A chosen symbol represents that function or principle,
on all levels simultaneously — from the simplest, most obvious physical manifestation of that function to the most abstract and metaphysical. Without recognizing the simple fact about the intent of symbolism, we will continue to be ignorant of the wealth of Egyptian knowledge and wisdom.

Animals' Power
Egyptians' careful observation and profound knowledge
of the natural world enabled them to identify certain ani
mals with specific qualities that could symbolize certain di
vine functions and principles, in a particularly pure and
striking fashion. As such, certain animals were chosen as
symbols for that particular aspect of divinity.
This effective mode of expression is consistent with all
cultures, for in the West (for example) they would say quiet

The One Joined Together
In Ancient Egyptian traditions, Ra personifies the pri

Ancient Egyptian definition of Ra is the perfect representa
tion of the Unity that comprises the putting together of the
many diverse entities, i.e. The One Who is the All
The Litany of Ra describes the aspects of the
creative principle: being recognized as the neteru
(gods) whose actions and interactions in turn
created the universe. As such, all the Egyptian
neteru who took part in the creation process
are aspects of Ra. There are 75 forms or aspects
of Ra. As such, Ra is often incorporated into
the names of other neteru (gods) such as in Amen-Ra of Ta-Apet (Thebes) , Ra-Atum of Onnu/ Ra-Harakhte Annu (Heliopolis), Ra-Harakhte (shown herein), ...etc.
The solar energy of the sun is only one of numerous
manifestations of Ra. That Ra is not just the sun (only a singular form), was also confirmed in the following verse from the Story of Ra and Auset (Isis), in which Ra states, 7 have multitude of names, and multitude of forms.

The Grand Ennead, The Nine Circles
Appropriately enough, the ninth Stanza of the Ancient
Egyptian Leiden Papyrus recalls the Grand P2nnead — the
first nine entities that came forth from Nun.
The first of the Grand Ennead was Atum, who came
into being out of Nun — the cosmic ocean. Atum then spat out the twins Shu and Tefnut, who in turn gave birth to Nut and Geb, whose union produced Ausar (Osiris), Auset (IsisJ. Set (Seth) and Nebt-Het(Nephthys).

The nine aspects of the Grand Ennead emanate from, and are circumscribed about, The Absolute. They are not a sequence,
but a unity — interpenetrating, interacting,
and interlocked. They are the generator of all creation, as symbolized by Heru (Horns), who according to the Leiden Papyrus, Stanza
No. 50, is:
...the offspring of the nine-times-unity of neteru.
Since the human being is a universal replica, a human
child is normally conceived, formed, and born in nine months. Number 9 marks the end of gestation and the end
of each series of numbers.



72 Egyptian Cosmology - Tfi& cAntinated'
rUnwer&&
Heru (Horus) is also associated with the number 5 [as
explained in chapter 8]. Five is the number of the cosmic
solids (polyhedrons) : tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. These 5 solids are formed from within 9 concentric circles, with each solid touching the
sphere that circumscribes the next solid within it. These 9
circles represent the nine — unity of the Grand Ennead,
the generator of all creation that is represented by these cos
mic solids.
•••
In the Litany of Ra, Ra is described as The
One of the Cat, and as The Great Cat. The nine realms of the universe are manifested in the cat, for both the cat and the Grand Ennead (meaning nine-times-unity) have the same ancient Egyptian term b.st. This relationship has found its way to the Western culture, where one
says that the cat has nine lives (realms). Ancient and Baladi Egyptians love The Cat and what it embodies. Herodotus wrote about the b.st temple of Bubastis, right outside
Zagazig, in the Nile Delta.
"Although other Egyptian cities were carried to a great height, in my opinion the greatest mounds were thrown up about the city of Bubastis, in which is a temple of Bast well worthy of mention; for though other temples may be larger and more costly, none is more pleasing to look at than this."
The annual festivities of this ancient city attracted more
than 700,000 people, singing, dancing, and having a great
time. Herodotus described the joy of the people, celebrating ftast, the symbol ofJoy. The cruelty of the foreign invaders
reduced this marvelous place into a pile of rubble.



14 - l\a, Co<\niu ( rcatwc h>i<< 71
Scarab Symbolism
Ra is frequently represented as a large black scarab
beetle, sitting in the solar boat and rolling the sun disc, or as
a man whose human head is replaced by a scarab beetle. As
such, Ra must be the original divine Scarab. The Egyptian
name for the scarab beetle was Khepri, a multiple word mean
ing he who brings into being.
Horapollo Niliaeus explains the symbolism of the scarab
in this way:
To signify the only begotten, or birth, or a father, or the world, or man, they [Egyptians] draw a scarab. The only begotten, because this animal is self-begotten, unborn of the female. For its birth takes place only in the following way. When the male
wishes to have offspring, it
takes some cow-dung and makes a round ball of it, very much in the shape of
the world. Rolling it with its hind legs from east to west,
it faces the east, so as to give it the shape of the world, for the world is borne from the east to the west.
In the elaborate symbolism of the transformational (funerary) texts, the dead King, identified with Ausar (Osiris), passed through analogous stages in the night of the underworld and was reborn as a new Ra, in his form of
Khepri (the scarab beetle) in the morning. The analogy to
the sun — disappearing at night and appearing in glory in
the morning — is clear. The scarab was the symbol of the
transforming quality of the sun, the light that becomes out
of darkness.



Chapter 15
The Sound and the form
Egyptian creation texts repeatedly stress
the belief of creation by the Word. When
nothing existed except the One, he created the universe with his commanding voice. The Egyptian Book of the Coming Forth by Light (wrongly and commonly translated as the
Book of the Dead), the oldest written text in the world, states:
/ am the Eternal ...I am that which created the
Word... lam the Word... Tehuti
In Ancient Egypt, the words of Ra, revealed through Tehuti (equivalent to Hermes or Mercury), became the things
and creatures of this world, i.e. the words (meaning sound
waves) created the forms in the universe.
The word (any word) is scientifically a vibrational com
plex element, which is a wave phenomenon, characterized by movement of variable frequency and intensity. In other
words, sound is caused by compressing air particles — by rearranging the spacing and movement of air particles, i.e. creating forms. Each soundwave frequency has its own geometrical corresponding form.



15 - Tciuiti. Tfh> Divine TonffUi 75
Tehuti and Ra (Perfect Tone)
The word (sound) energies of Tehuti transformed the creation concept/impulse of Ra (symbolized in a circle) into a physical and metaphysical reality. Such transformation is
reflected in the Ancient Egyptian process of "squaring the
circle", as evident in all their numerological (so-called "math
ematical") papyri. In all these papyri, the area of a circle
was obtained by finding the equivalent square. The diam
eter was always represented as 9 cubits. The Ancient Egyptian papyri equate the 9 cubit diameter circle to a square
with the sides of 8 cubits.
The number 9, as the diameter, represents the Grand
Ennead — the group of 9 neteru (gods). The 9 are all as
pects of Ra, the primeval cosmic creative force, whose sym
bol is/was the circle.
As stated earlier, 8 represents the manifested creation,
as represented by the Master of Eighty namely Tehuti.
Musically, the ratio of 8:9 is called (appropriately enough) The Perfect Tone. Temple sanctuaries, such as the top sanctuary at the Luxor Temple, are an 8:9 rectangular
shape.



/6 'Egyptian Cosmology - Tfie cAniniated 'Universe
Name Calling
As stated earlier, Egyptian creation texts repeatedly
stress the belief of creation by the Word. We find that in the
Book of the Divine Cow (found in the shrines of Tut-AnkhAmen), Ra creates the heavens and its hosts merely by pronouncing some words whose sound alone evokes the names
of things — and these things then appear at his bidding. As
its name is pronounced, so the thing comes into being. For
the name is a reality, the thing itself. In other words, each
particular sound has/is its corresponding form, as stated ear
lier in this chapter.
The role of the name in Ancient and Baladi Egypt was not, as per our modern-day thinking, a mere label. The name
of a neter, person, animal, or principle, represents a resume
or synopsis of the qualities of that person or object. To know and pronounce the real name of a neter (god), man,
or animal is to exercise power over it. It is therefore that Ancient and Baladi Egyptians have real "secret" names for everybody and everything, in order to protect the person
and the thing.
The traditional story of the Mystery of the Divine Name is found on an Ancient Egyptian papyrus, now in the Turin Museum. In the story, Ra refused to tell even the most be
loved Being, Auset (Isis), his real (secret) name. The events
of the story end with Ra "divulging" his "secret" name as Amen. It should be noted that Amen means secret/hidden. In other words, under all difficult circumstances, Ra (as a model
for all) did not divulge his real name, but only stated that
his secret name was [Amen] secret.
The learned and most trusted people in an Egyptian community knew/know the great real (or secret) names of
the neteru (gods) and other cosmic forces, and used this knowledge to maintain order in the world.



15 - Tctiuii. THe THmne Tongue
Most Ancient and Baladi Egyptians have at least two
names — one common (official) name, and the other secret name. The person's secret name is the real name that resonates with the cosmos. The name symbolizes and embodies the individuality of the person (everything that distinguishes somebody from someone else). Naming a person in Ancient and Baladi Egypt was/is not an arbitrary choice,
but was/is done in consultation with an astrologist. People
also get hints of the "real" name for the new baby from an
cestors: in dreams, signs, candle flickerings, etc.
The real name was/is imbued with magical powers and properties; to destroy someone's name was/is to deprive
them of all individuality and all power. To perpetuate the
name of the father was the son's earnest duty. According to the Egyptian traditions, one could do nothing better for any
one than to cause his name to live with inscriptions and representations, and nothing worse than to allow his name to
perish.
Calling a person's name was/is important in performing Egyptian chants and spells. Incantation and chanting
are scientifically controlled sound waves, which generate sonar fields, establishing an immediate vibratory identity
with the essential principle that underlies any object or form. By pronouncing certain words or names of powers, in the proper manner and in the proper tone of voice, a priest/
doctor could heal the sick, and cast out the evil spirits (in
other words the contrary/incompatible energies) that caused
the pain and suffering.
Ancient and Baladi Egyptians did/do not have the socalled last (sur or family) "name". Each family lineage was/
is defined by its profession/trade. It was/is one's profession/trade name that determines the "family name". [More
about this in chapter 23.]



78 Egyptian Cosmology - Tfie cAmmate4 'Universe
Harmony of the Spheres
As per common knowledge, everything — from the
smallest to the largest unit — is in constant motion. Since
motion is the cause of sound (compressing air particles), it should follow that the motions of the planets must produce
sound. And since the relative pitch of any musical sound is
a function of the velocity of the moving object, the pitches
emitted by the motions of the planets vary in accordance
with their individual speeds. With this line of reasoning, harmonics and astronomy
are intimately related.
The Egyptian understanding of universal harmony, in an astronomical-musical sense, was confirmed by early Greek and Roman travelers. According to Diodorus: Tehuti (whom he calls by the Greek name of Hermes) was the first to observe the orderly arrangement of the stars and the harmony of the musical sounds and their na
ture.
In Ancient Egypt, temples were commonly provided with a complement of musicians and dancers, whose task it
was to participate in the various daily and seasonal cycles of
worship, so as to attune to the universal harmony.
The neteru (gods) themselves are depicted on the temple walls, playing musical
instruments. There are also
many representations of musicians, on the walls of
temples, playing directly to a
neter (god), such as to Ptah, Heru (Horus), Sekhmet, Khans and Wazet.

The netert (goddess), Het-Heru
(Hathor), was known as the mistress of dance and the mistress of music Het-Heru was the great provider of spiritual nourishment and healing. She provided joy, lovemaking, music and cheerfulness.
In a hymn to Het-Heru, at her temple
in Dendera, there is indication of the intimate relationship between music and the cosmos:
Het-Heru
The sky and its stars make music to you.
The sun and the moon praise you.

IPtaM, Tfie 'Divine Smitfi
In Ancient Egypt, Ptah was the cosmic shaping force,
the giver of form (smith). He was the coagulating, creative fire, simultaneously the cause (of the created world) and
effect (of the scission).
The role of Ptah, as the coagulating fire,
is described in the Egyptian Coffin Texts,
Spell 1130:
I am the Lord of Fire who lives on truth.
The truth mentioned in the above text
is Ma-at — the cosmic law, harmony, equilibrium. Ptah sits enthroned or stands upon
a pedestal in the form of the glyph for Maat, to emphasize the importance of balanc
ing energies in the transformation process, Ptah from a raw to finished form.
The transformation process to finished form requires a
delicate balance in the handling of energies. It is therefore that Ptah is depicted as imprisoned, bound in swaddling clothes, with only head, hands and feet free. This symbolizes Ptah as the coagulating fire, bound by the neter (god)
Set, (principle of contraction) in the matter. Nature cannot exist without such dual opposing forces.



16 - Vtafi* The / titune SmM
Ptah's main cosmological center w;is al Men-Nefer (Memphis), which was one of the four main cosmological centers in Ancient Egypt.
Ptah is/was patron of crafts, trades, and the arts. Ptah's
counterparts on earth are the smiths, who were/are highly revered and sometimes feared, because of their supernatural powers in handling, controlling, and manipulating the four elements of creation. These four elements are always present at the smith's forge:
fire, the air of the bellows to tease fire, water to tame
fire, and earth, as
the provider of raw
materials.
The Pharaoh himself, as well as other spiritual leaders
and intermediaries were/are identified with the mysterious
craft of the smith.
Because of their special powers, Ptah's counterparts on
earth (the smiths) perform the work aimed at shaping the environment and the individuals around them. The soci
ety relied on these artisans to be their intermediaries, to
guide their religious upbringing, such as boys' circumcision
and training [see page 147 for more information]. They also
helped the rest of society to solve their problems, from the
physical (e.g. fixing tools) to the metaphysical (e.g. influ
encing events).
The Greeks identified Ptah with Hephaestus, the divine
smith. Their names may be linked etymologically. Ptah is
also identified with the Romans' Vulcan.



Chapter 17
The Grand Ancestor
According to the Ancient Egyptian traditions, Ausar
(Osiris) came to earth for the benefit of mankind, bearing the title of Manifester of Good and Truth.
As per the Egyptian Model Story [chapter 2], despite his mythical death and dismemberment, Ausar carried the liv
ing seed of eternity — Heru (Horus) — within him. As such, Ausar represents the mortal man carrying within himself
the capacity and power of spiritual salvation. All dead persons were/are equated to Ausar, because Ausar is a cosmic
principle, and not a historical person.
Every Egyptian's hope was/is resurrection in a transformed body and of immortality, which could only be real
ized through the death and resurrection of Ausar.
Ausar is usually represented as a mummified, bearded human body wearing the white crown. He is usually shown
carrying: 1 - the shepherd's crook (being the shepherd of man
kind). 2
- the flail symbolizing the ability to separate wheat
from chaff. 3
- the scepter of supremacy.

The concept of Ausar as the Grand Ancestor extended
to the Ancient and Baladi Egyptian's entire sociology and
existence. From beginning to end, a long chain of ancestral precedents became a custom and a law. Every Egyptian's duty was/is to honor their ancestors with responsible ac
tions and good deeds.
Every Egyptian learned/learns to honor his/her ances

(SV Lc)\/plhm CotmoloLjy - The cAi^uiiated Zlnwer&e
The Renewal Power {Easter)
The principle that makes life come from apparent death was/is called Ausar, who symbolizes the power of renewal.
Ausar represents the process, growth, and the underlying cy
clical aspects of the
universe. Therefore,
he was also identified
with the spirits (ener
gies) of grain, trees,
animals, reptiles,
birds, etc. The most
impressive representa
tion of the concept of
regeneration, namely
Ausar, is the illustration depicting Ausar with 28 stalks of
wheat growing out of his coffin. It is also interesting to
note that Ausar's life (or his reign), according to the sym
bolic Egyptian Model Story, lasted 28 (7x4) years. The Pharaohs, just like the Grand Ancestor Ausar, were identified with the crops, and were addressed by titles such as: Our Crop and Our Harvest.
("The Resurrection of the Wheat")
Ausar's cyclical nature made him relate to the number
7 and its multiples. Very often we find that seven or mul
tiples of seven are needed to account for the principle and sequence of growth. Throughout the entire world, menstruation appears to be connected with the moon, the courses of the moon being likened to the courses of a woman. The
moon is thus the appropriate symbol of fertility. As he waxes and wanes, he is regarded as a dying and resurrecting cycle

the symbol of the death and rebirth of the crops. Menstruation in women, on which all human life depends, oc
curs in a cycle of 28 (7 x 4) days.



17 - c4/Mtf/\ tlic l\c>uini'i lion
Egyptian Kings, like their role model Ausar, were re
garded as personifications (emanations) of the moon, in
addition to the sun. In the cycle of Ausar-Ra, Ausar is iden
tified with the moon, the light of the night regions of the
dead. Ausar's Light is a reflection of Ra, in one of his mani
festations as the sun.
Ausar died (analogous to the moon's departure) and was
resurrected, the third day after that. The third day is the
beginning of a new moon, i.e. a renewed Ausar. This is
reminiscent of the Easter celebration, where, like Ausar, the
biblical Jesus died on Friday and was resurrected the third
day — Sunday — as a new life.

The Virgin Mother
Auset's (Isis) role in the Egyptian Model
Story and the story of the Virgin Mary are
strikingly similar, for both were able to conceive without male impregnation. Heru (Horus) was conceived and born after the
death of Auset's husband, and, as such, Aueet
was revered as the Virgin Mother.
Auset is the power responsible for the
creation of all living creatures. Ancient Egyptians called her " Aueet with the \0,000 names/ attributes". Plutarch took
note of that and wrote in his Morcilia Vol V,
Auset (Isis) is, in fact, the female principle of Nature, and is
receptive of every form of generation, in accord with which she is called by Plato the gentle nurse and the all-receptive, and by most people has been called by countless names, since, because of the force of Reason, she turns
herself to this thing or that and is receptive of all manner of shapes and forms.
Auset, in Egyptian, means throne. [More about the sig
nificance of her name in chapter 22.]

Sabt (Sirius), Aueet Star
Egypt worked according to an extremely accurate triple calendar. Each calendar had/has its own purpose:
1 - A lunar calendar of alternating 29- and 30-day months.
2
- A civil calendar of 360 days plus five additional days
(on which the neteru were said to be born).
3
- A calendar of 365 lA days based upon the heliacal re
turn of the star Sabt (Sirius).
The Egyptians' advanced knowledge in astronomy, as
reflected in their calendar, was acknowledged by the great Strabo (64 BCE - 25 CE), who wrote:
"The Egyptian priests are supreme in the science of the sky. Mysterious and reluctant to communicate, they eventually let themselves be persuaded, after much soliciting, to impart some of their precepts; although they conceal the greater part. They revealed to the Greeks the secrets of the full year, whom the latter ignored as with many other
things..."
Egypt's ingenious and very accurate calendar was based on the observation and the study of Sabt's (Sirius) movements in the sky. The Egyptians regarded Sabt as the great
central fire, about which our solar system orbits.
During the very remote periods of the Ancient Egyp
tian history, Aueet was associated with the star 5a bt (Sirius),
the brightest star in heaven, which was called, like her, the Great Provider and whose annual rising ushered in the Nile's inundation and the beginning of the Egyptian Year. It occurred when Sabt rose on the horizon together with the sun, and remained visible for a few moments until it faded
with the advance of dawn. We refer to this as the heliacal



88 Li]\ipdan Cosmology - Tfie Animated Unwer&e,
(from Greek helios, "the sun") rising of Sabt (Sirius). This
fact is clearly acknowledged in the Webster's dictionary, w hich defines the Sothic (Sabt in Egyptian) year as:
of having to do with Sirius (Sabt), the Dog Star
Designating or of an Ancient Egyptian cycle or period of
time based on fixed year of 365 1/4 days (Sothic Year) and
equal to 1,460 such years.

Nubkaura Temple at 1 el-Lahun (during the time of Senwosret II, 1897-1878 BCE), notifying him that Sabt (Sirius) would rise on the 16th day of the 4th month, so
as to take note of its exact location and time, and to enter it
into the temple records.
The length of the Sothic year was computed from one
rising of the Dog Star, Sabt (Sirius), to another. But the
annual rising of Sabt was not the beginning of the year, because Sabt appears to move in a spiral orbit, from one
year to the next.
For ordinary purposes, such as the dates of their kings and other events, Ancient Egyptians used the civil calendar of the year of 365 days. The civil or moving year gradually
shifted in relation to the fixed or Sothic year. Every calcula
tion could thus be corrected, by comparing the time of the
list, with that of the Sothic year. The civil year, losing a bit
over a day every four years, took 1,461 years to coincide with the Sothic year. The date of this coincidence marked
what Egypt called the New Year.



18 - cAuset, The Zlniiterdol rMotfl& 89
Surviving Egyptian records show that the Sothic year
was fixed in the year 4240 BCE. There are repeated references in the Funerary (commonly known as Pyramid] Texts
of the 5 th Dynasty Kings (ca. 2500 BCE), referring to a prior inauguration of the New Year. Astronomical calculations show that the referenced prior New Year occurred in 4240
BCE. We don't know if this was the first time that Egyp
tians calculated the time of the New Year, or if other prior
New Years occurred in previous Sothic periods. If 4240 BCE
was the first recorded New Year, the observation and calcu
lation of the differences between the solar and sothic cycles
must have started at a much earlier time.
As stated earlier, the beginning of the year was not set
at the annual rising of 5a bt (Sirius), because its path through the heavens has a wavy curve. This is caused by 5a bt's faint massive companion. 5abt and its companion are revolving around their common center of gravity or, in other words, revolving about each other.
5abt's diameter is less than twice the diameter of our sun. Its companion, however, has a diameter only about three times the diameter of earth, yet it weighs about 250,000
times as much as the earth. Its material is packed together
so tightly, that it is about 5,000 times as dense as lead. Such a compression of matter means that 5abt's companion's atoms do not exist in their normal states, but are squeezed so
closely together, that many atomic nuclei are crowded into
a space previously occupied by a single normal atom, i.e. the
electrons of these atoms are squeezed out of their orbits and move about freely (a degenerate state). This is the Egyp
tian Nun, the neutron soup — the origin of all matter and
energy in the universe.
The movement of 5abt's companion on its own axis, and around 5abt, upholds all creation in space, and as such
is considered the starting point of creation.



Chapter 19
Set,
Ifie Tomer afOpposition
The pre-creation state [as described
on page 35] was caused by the effect of gravitational/contractional forces that pulled and crushed atoms out of their
orbits. The act of creation was/is to bring
order to the atoms, by countering/opposing the crushing forces.
Therefore, to the Ancient Egyptians,
opposition forces were a necessity of cre
ation and its continuance.
The neter (energy/power/force), Set (Seth), represents the universal role
of opposition.
Set
The world, as we know it — from the smallest particle
to the largest planet — is kept in balance by a law that is
based on the balanced dual nature of all things. Without the balance between the two opposing forces, there would
be no creation, i.e. no universe. For example, the galaxies
are mainly subjected to two opposing forces: 1) the expul
sion forces — resulting from the effect of the Big Bang all
galaxies moving away from us — and 2) the gravity forces,
which pull the galaxies together.



19 - ScL TIw Vowei <>/ Opposition 91
Another example (however mundane) is the role of Set
(opposition) in our ability to walk. The friction of a surface
makes it possible to walk, and a lack of friction (like an icy
surface) makes it impossible to walk. So, without the op
posing resistance of friction, we are unable to walk. Yet,
too much friction — the other extreme, such as a thorny
surface — also makes it impossible to walk. In other words,
resistance, at the proper magnitude, is a necessity in the uni
verse.
It is therefore that Set is not evil in the narrow sense.
He represents the concept of opposition in all aspects of life
(physically and metaphysically). Too much or too little of
Set's powers — or anything else — is not workable. The
proper quantity of Set — or anything else — is a necessity
indeed.
To express the necessity of Set, we find the following
references in the Ancient Egyptian traditions:
1 - Set is one of the Grand Ennead, responsible for the
creation of everything. [See chapter 14.]
2
- Set symbolizes one of the four elements of solidity/
stability of the universe, namely fire/heat, as mentioned
earlier in Plutarch's Moralia Vol V,
The Egyptians simply give the name of... Set/Typhon
in Greek] ...to all that is dry fiery and arid, in general,
and antagonistic to moisture.
3
- Set also represents the metaphysical fire/dryness, such
as the emotions of love, hate, jealousy, aloofness, an
ger, temperment, passion, etc, as shown in the Egyp
tian Model Story [chapter 2]. Without fire/heat, the universe cannot exist. Also,
being "antagonistic to moisture" is essential in the water
cycle of evaporation, condensation, ...etc.



92 Egyptian Cosmology - Tfie Mmmdted Vnher&e
At the end of The Egyptian Model Story, both Heru and Set were assigned equal and different roles in the universe
[see chapter 2]. Set became the ruler of the desert/waste/
wilderness areas and their associated animals, such as the
immense coiled serpent, the black pig, and the ass. Each
animal symbolizes a different aspect of Set.
To learn about Set is to
learn about aspects of our
selves and our universe. The
objective is to know how to control and manage these
types of Set energies.
In the Ancient Egyptian
relief shown to the right, Set
is depicted, guiding the Pha
raoh to kill the wicked serpent at the four corners of
the world.
Unlike christian theologians, the question of the nature and existence of Set gave the Egyptians no trouble at
all.

The One Joined Together
For Ancient Egyptians, man, as a miniature universe,
represents the created images of all creation. Since Ra
the cosmic creative impulse — is called, The One Join together, Who Comes Out of His Own Members, so the human being (the
image of creation) is likewise, A One Joined Together. The
human body is a unity that consist of different parts, joined
together. In the Litany of Ra, the body parts of the divine
man are each identified with a neter/netert.
If man is the universe in miniature, then all factors in
man are duplicated on a greater scale in the universe. All
drives and forces, which are powerful in man, are also pow
erful in the universe at large. In accordance with the Egyp
tians' cosmic consciousness, every action performed by man
is believed to be linked to a greater pattern in the universe,
including sneezing, blinking, spitting, shouting, weeping,
dancing, playing, eating, drinking, and sexual intercourse.
Man, to the Ancient Egyptians, was the embodiment of the laws of creation. As such, the physiological func
tions and processes of the various parts of the body were seen as manifestations of cosmic functions. The limbs and organs had a metaphysical function, in addition to their
physical purpose. The parts of the body were consecrated



c>6 Ijgyptian Cosmology - Tlie Animated Wiwer&e
to one of the neteru (divine principles), which appeared in the Egyptian records throughout its recovered history. In
addition to the Litany of Ra, here ar£ other examples:
• Utterance 215 § 148-149, from the Sarcophagus Chamber of Unas' Tomb (rubble pyramid) at Saqqara, iden
tifies the parts of the body (head, nose, teeth, arms,
legs, etc), each with the divine neteru.
Thy head is that of Heru (Horus]
thy nose is a Anbu (Anubis) thy teeth are Sopdu
thy arms are Happy and Dua-mutef,
thy legs are Imesty and Kebeh-senuf,
All thy members are the twins ofAtum.
• From the Papyrus ofAni, [pi. 32, item 42]:
My hair is Nun; my face is Ra; my eyes are Het-Heru (Hathor); my ears are Wepwawet; my nose is She who presides over her lotus-leaf; my lips are Anbu (A nubis); my molars are Selket; my incisors are Auset (Isis); my arms are the Ram, the Lord of Mendes; my breast is Net (Nri th); my back is Set (Seth); myphallus is A usar (Osiris); . . . my belly and my spine are Sekhmet; my buttocks are the Eye of Heru (Horus); my thighs and my calves are Nut; my feet are Ptah; . . . there is no member of mine devoid of a neter (god), and Tehuti
(

The above text leaves no doubt about the divinity of each member: there is no member of mine devoid of a neter (god).

The Big Bang — The Divine Parte
The Big Bang theory, which sees the creation of the
universe as a physical event, was presented thousands of
years ago in the Egyptian texts, wherehy the Absolute cre
ated the universe out of Nun, the cosmic ocean. All parts of
the universe originated from one source. Since the Origin
is Divine, it follows that the parts are also divinized.
The physical event of the Big Bang was transformed
into the typical Egyptian story form. This well-crafted Egyp
tian mystery play was based on the fact that man, as the
image of God, represented the created image of all creation.
The divinity of the human parts assumed their functions in
the storytelling of creation. Here is the sequence of the Big
Bang as described in Ancient Egyptian texts.
1 - The first step to start creation, was for the Objective Divine Being (Atum) to conceive in his own heart
(which is, in cosmic terms, the seat of intellect, mind,
conscience) the concept of the multiple (divine beings)
out of the One, i.e. the Big Bang. The Ancient Egyptian text, known as the BremncrRhind Papyrus, The 3ook of Knowing the Creations of Ra and Overcoming Apep (Apophis), states:
/ conceived in my own heart; there came into being a
vast number of forme of divine beings as the forms of
children and the forms of their children.
Creation as a Big Bang resulted in the separation of
parts (children) and smaller parts (their children).
2
- The generation of new beings can only be enacted by the work of two complimentary opposites. The femi

nine principle of the self-created Atum is his hand. [More
details later in this chapter.] This was stated in the
Bremner-Rhind Papyrus: f
I it was who aroused desire with my hand.
3
- The build up of the physical forces that caused the Big
Bang was equated, in human terms, to an erect phallus, and the act of masturbation. Masturbation is the
same as the building up of physical forces that led to the Big Bang. It's another explanation of the same thing. The Egyptian text in the Bremner-Rhind Papy
rus states:
/ masturbated with my hand.
4
- The created universe was manifested ^
through Tehuti, who gave names to the ^ ^ divine beings that resulted from the Big Bang. The Egyptian texts state that the created universe came out of the mouth, and the mouth was
the symbol of Unity, the One, in hieroglyphs. The Bremner-Rhind Papyrus describes the fiery explo
sion (Big Bang) from the mouth, just like the lava com
ing out of the volcano's mouth:
/ it was who aroused desire with my hand; I masturbated
with my hand, I poured out of my mouth. I spat out Shu, I
spat out Tefnut.

Astrological Personal Maps
The unique individuality of each person was recognized
in all aspects of the Ancient Egyptian civilization, such as
in medicine. Several Ancient Egyptian medical (mostly cat
egorized as "magical" by academia) papyri were recovered.
They belong to different periods and to different localities.
These papyri identify the different parts of the patient's body
as being under the influence of different neteru, and in this
way divinized.
In all these Ancient Egyptian medical papyri, the rela
tionships between the divinized parts to particular neteru
(gods) were different from one person to another. Trans
formational (funerary) texts were individualized as well. No
two "funerary" texts are alike. Therefore, these papyri were personalized astrological maps/charts.
Ancient and Baladi Egyptians' cosmic consciousness
led/leads them to the adoption of astrologically-based prac
tices in every aspect of their lives. It is clear that Egyptian
medicine had a strong astrological element, as per the following examples:
1 - Egyptians divided the sky into 36 sectors of ten degrees
each, called decans. Ausar, The Grand Ancestor, like
wise has 36 forms. Like the sky, the human body, in Ancient Egyptian medicine, was also divided into 36
sectors, and each came under the influence of a certain
neteru/ netert (god/goddess), each controlled by one of the 36 parts of the Egyptian Zodiac. The Egyptian Zodiac consists of 12 months; each month is divided into
3 intervals of 10 days (like decan).
Baladi Egyptians refer to the peculiarities of each of
the three intervals of the 30-day month, in all their af
fairs. It is interesting to note that the "modern" astro
logical month is also divided into 3 intervals — each
with its own peculiar characteristics.

- The day, in Egypt, was divided into 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night. The length of the hour was not
fixed, but varied with the seasons. T Long days in the
summer meant longer hours of the day, and the opposite in the winter months. Each hour had its own influence. The Egyptian medical papyri advised specific
times at which to administer specific recipes or treat
specific ailments.
3
- The Egyptian physiological system is based on the presence of 12 centers of power. Once, every two hours of
night and day, one or the other of these centers reaches
peak activity, by the passage of Ra, the sun of the blood,
and it then returns to sleep. The alterations of the red and white solar energy to the areas where the twelve
powers lie sleeping within the organs of the body, is the result of cosmic rhythms. This activity happens twelve times a day. Twelve is also the number of months in a year and the number of zodiac signs in the
Great Year.
Acupuncture, which we are told is Chinese, is actually
Egyptian. The Chinese refer to these 12 centers of power,
as the twelve meridians of the body.
This Ancient Egyptian belief in the 12 centers was
passed down to the West, in the familiar figure of the medieval astrological man, with his organs and limbs assigned to
the domination of the twelve astrological signs.

Metaphysical/Physical Functions of the Parte
It is a human instinct worldwide to use a human organ/part to describe a metaphysical aspect. The Ancient Egyptian texts and symbols are permeated with this complete understanding that the man (whole and parts) is the image of the universe (whole and parts). This understanding was shown earlier, where the Big Bang theory was described in human (mini-universe) terms.
Here are a few more examples in Ancient Egypt of the metaphysical/physical functions of some human parts:
• The Hand
The hand symbolized/symbolizes several concepts, one
of which is action, and therefore of creation and of la
tent creative power. As stated earlier, Atum created the
first beings by copulating with his own hand. Atum's hand personified the female principle inherent within him, and from this union, the divine pair, Shu and Tefnut, arose. The metaphysical role of the hand is present in texts throughout the known history of Ancient Egypt. Such a concept is found in the Unas (so-called
"Pyramid") Texts [Spell 1248]. Later, we find it in rep
resentational expressions on decorated coffins of the
First Intermediate Period (2150-2040 BCE), which de
picted the image of the divine couple tk Atum and his hand." The exact nature of the hand symbolism is seen in the fact that in the New Kingdom (1550-1070 BCE), the title "neters hand" was applied to the wife of Amen/
Amon — the legal heiress to the throne. [More about the
legal heiress and the matrilineal/matriarchal society in chap
ter 22.]
The role of the loving hand found its way into most
cultures, for when a man wants to marry, he asks the
girl's father for her hand.

• The Heart
The heart was/is considered to be a symbol of intellectual perceptions, consciousness, and moral courage. The heart is symbolized by Heru (Horus).
• The Tongue
The tongue is the strongest muscle in the human body. A man of his word means whatever he commands with Jus tongue will he manifested. The tongue is symbolized by Tehuti (Thoth).
• Both the heart and tongue complement each other, as
stated clearly in the Shabaka Stele (716-701 BCE), which is a reproduction from the 3 rd Dynasty.
the Heart thinks all that it wishes, and the Tongue
delivers all that it wishes.

• The Spine and Belly In our modern societies, the guts and spine are symbols of physical courage. This concept has Ancient Egyptian roots.
In the Papyrus of Ani [pi. 32 item 42], we
read,
my belly and my spine are Sekhmet
Sekhmet is a lioness-headed netert (god
dess). The lioness is the most fearless ani
mal.

Human Measurement Units
The whole metrological system in Egypt was based on
the human figure — its units derived from an ideal length
of limb. Here are a few examples:
1 - The main standard linear measure
was the mh(cuhit) : the length of
the forearm from elbow to tip of ^-s^^ /
|
middle finger — further divided into 7 handbreadths/palms of four digits each or 28. One Egyptian cubit is 1.72' or 0.5236m.
2
- In Egypt, the sections of the eye are the glyphs for the
fractions V2 to Ve4, as shown below. Note that the sum
of successive division is 63/e4, which will always fall short
of unity except at infinity, which is perfectly consistent with Egyptian thought: only the Absolute is One.
3
- To Egypt, a fraction — any fraction — could only be a
fraction of unity. Esoterically, because all numbers are
to be regarded as divisions of unity, the mathematical
relationship a number bears to unity is a key to its na
ture.



104 rEcf\fptian Cocsnw/a^jx/ - Ttie cAnimated Knmer&e
The Ancient Egyptians represented
fractions, i.e. having a numerator of 1, by drawing the mouth of Ra (shown herein) as the numerator and unit marks underneath for the denominator.
To write 7 7
th

bol. A seventh is called Ra-Sefhet = mouth
of seven. The glyph might be translated as 'One emits seven'.
In Ancient Egypt, the words of Ra, revealed through
Tehuti (equivalent to Hermes or Mercury), became the parts
(fractions) of the world.

The Twin Soul
As stated earlier, Ancient and Baladi Egyptians believe
that our earthly existence at the 8 th realm (or the first earth)
is closely associated with our Siamese twin of the opposite
sex, who exists at the 9 th realm (also called the 2 nd earth/
land). Most people, worldwide, usually call this twin the
astral, etheric, or spirit body, a kind of vital image of the body itself. This body is an exact mirror-image replica of our physical body. The astral body at realm 9 has molecules
that vibrate at a much faster and higher rate than its physi
cal counterpart. Most people can't see the astral body, al
though Baladi Egyptians, and some people from other cul
tures, are able to see it psychi
cally.
Several Ancient Egyp
tian illustrations depict the
ram-headed Khnum molding two identical twins at the
potter's wheel, in affirmation of the concept of the Two Lands/Earths, where the twin
souls are subject to the same
experiences from date of birth
to date of death.

The scene shown below (from a bas-relief in the Temple
of Luxor) depicts the twin neteru, Hapi, representing the Two Lands/Earths, and bringing forth thertwin baby Amenhotep

The physical and the astral bodies have points of contact. These junctions are known as plexuses. There may be
as many as 80,000 in the human body. At the present time, we may only be able to name about 30, and only six or seven are described in any detail.
Plexuses were known to the Ancient Egyptians. From Egypt, the theory spread, by way of the Hellenic world and Byzantium, to the Hesychasts (an order of monks in modern Greece), who distinguish six such plexuses: the fore
head, throat, heart, solar plexuses, sex organs and tail. Near
the human tail is situated one of the most powerful plexuses known to occultism. This important plexus was known to Ancient Egyptians, who portrayed neteru with tails.

The Metaphysical Components
According to Ancient and Baladi Egyptian traditions, when the body was born, there came into existence with it
an abstract individuality or a spiritual being, which was
wholly independent and distinct from the physical body, whose actions it was supposed to direct, and guide, and keep
watch over. It lived in the body until the body died.
According to the Egyptians' logic, since the physical
body is comprised of various components (chemical, bio
logical, etc), the metaphysical being likewise consists of sev
eral metaphysical components — ba, ka, ...etc. The Egyptians dealt with these components in the same manner as our modern chemistry deals with the chemical elements and compounds of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, ...etc.
The major metaphysical components are:
The ba is immortal. When
the ba departs, the body dies. The ba is represented as a human-headed bird,
which is the opposite of the
normal depiction of neteru (gods) as human bodies
with animal heads — in other words, as the divine as
pect of the terrestrial. The ba may be shown as a stork,
or as a falcon. The stork is known for its migrating and homing instinct. The stork is known worldwide
as the bird who carries newborn babies to their new
families. The stork returns to its own nest with con
sistent precision, hence a migratory bird, par excellence,
is the bird chosen for the soul, 3a is usually translated
as soul.



/OS Ljx/ptidii Cosmology - Tfie Animated 'Unwer&e
The ka is the combination of several intertwined subcomponents. It is equated to
what we describe as personality. The kaTdoes
not die with the mortal body, although it may break into its many subcomponents. The ka is portrayed as a pair of arms outstretched towards heaven.
• The khaibit seems to correspond with our notion of the
ghost.
• The khu is a higher spiritual element. It is a shining and luminous component. Khu-s are also heavenly be
ings, living with the neteru (gods). Each khu may then
be equivalent to the guardian angel.
• The akh is the beneficient spirit gained through piety and good deeds.
• The ab is the heart, which corresponds to conscience.
• The eekhem is the personification of the inner strength
of a man.

All planets/comets follow the egg-shaped (elliptical) orbit,

Likewise, on earth, the female is the source of energy

the sun. It is her power that keeps the children (plan

matrilineal/matriarchal system follows the planetary laws.
The matriarchal system, as the social manifestation of
planetary laws, was the basis of the social organization in Ancient Egypt, where the queen sister and queen mother
had positions of great respect and potentially much author

Through marriage, she transmitted the crown to her hus
band, he only acted as her ex
ecutive agent. This social/po
litieal law was reflected in the Egyptian folklore of Ausar,
who became the first Pharaoh of Egypt, as a result of his
marrying Auset. Auset means seat, i.e. authority. Aueet is
the principle of legitimacy — the actual physical throne.
As a rule, in the Egyptian tombs as far back as the Old Kingdom, the mother of the deceased is represented with
the wife, while the father rarely appears. On the funerary
stelae of later times also, it is the usual custom to trace the descent of the deceased on the mother's side, and not on
that of the father. The person's mother is specified, but not
the father, or he is only mentioned incidentally.
Surviving records from the Middle Kingdom (2040-1783 BCE) show that the nomes (provinces) of Egypt passed from one family to another through heiresses; thus he who mar
ried the heiress would govern the province.
Western academicians are uncomfortable with writing about the matrilineal and matriarchal societies. Some even
went so far as to state that the reason they traced the moth
ers only, was because fathers were unknown or in doubt.
They are in pain, trying to deny, ignore, downplay, and explain it through their own dark sides. Their underlying,
pathetic, resentful and contemptuous thinking is, what Europe did not have, cannot be!

Polity/Nome
fT
A polity is like a small stellar system that revolves
around a common purpose. A polity usually consists of a
number of extended families living in compounds clustered
within a narrow area, or scattered about in groups. Each
family has a specialty in which it excels, and between the
neighboring family lineages, the different tasks are harmo
niously divided.
Each family lineage (called Ginne, and meaning ances
tor) consists of a number of family units who share the same female line. A common Egyptian Baladi proverb goes, a
maternal uncle is [like] a father, emphasizing the genetic fe
male lineage.
Each family has a leader, or family head, who is re
sponsible for the material and spiritual welfare of every mem
ber of the family lineage. He also maintains law, order, jus
tice, and harmony. The elders settle internal disputes among
their family members. Members of the same family lineage cannot marry, ex
cept in special well-defined cases that avoid genetic weak
ening of the family lineage. Incest for them is much more
than marriage between siblings or first cousins.
The polity's political structure is truly a grassroot de
mocracy, with the proper representation. A council of re
spected elders, from the established lineages of the commu
nity, elects and assists the leader in the governance of the community. The council serves as a court, helps the leader
allocate access to resources, carries out rituals, and orga
nizes public works.
Other polity's offices include that of village spiritual
intermediary, which may be different from the leader. The
spiritual intermediary links the community ritually to the
authority of the local spirits of the land and the spirits of
past leaders whose aid and retributions he interprets.

Commonwealth Alliance of Polities
The needs of a civilized society cannot be fully satis
fied by the produce of its village polity. In order to protect
the individuality of the polity and its socio-political effec
tiveness, a co-op system between several polities is needed.
In other words, a large society should be like a galaxy com
posed of several planetary groups. No planetary group domi
nates another. They are all independent groups that harmonize about common interests. On earth, this would be the commonwealth-type alliance.
Unlike the autocratic centralized-type government, the form of a commonwealth-type government recognizes the
importance of the grassroots — local communities. Coali
tions are formed to share specific duties and responsibilities
that can benefit all of them.
The cooperative polities are represented by each's leader,
to form a council of elders/leaders. There are several ways
to run such an alliance:
1 - The council elects a local leader to be recognized as a
leader of a group of polities. 2
- The council elects a rotating leader. 3
- Commonwealth (s) may find and choose a spiritual leader, like a Pharaoh whose main duty was to suppli
cate spirits of the land to renew its fertility, and to en
gage the help of chiefly ancestors to foster the welfare
of the land and people.
[More about the role of the Pharaoh in chapter 24.]
Alliances can be resolved, changed or restructured, and they did so throughout the Ancient Egyptian history. We should not misunderstand this to mean upheaval, but the true application of Live and Let Live. This is a true grassroots democracy.

Central-Type Government Failings
A central-type government, notwithstanding their self
proclaimed superiority, is not of the people, by the people, for
the people. Their emphasis on "individuality" — as far as
one man, one vote — is a misrepresentation of the society.
Breaking up the society into individuals produces a socially
(as well as economically and politically) chaotic society. It
is a system based on patronizing the individual and convincing him/her that s/he is truly represented by a politi
cian who will say anything to be elected. The reality is that
enacting laws in these broken societies is based on the power
of the special interest groups, and individual voters have no power.
In the grassroot democratic commonwealth system, the
elders of family groups are the true and honest representa
tives. In other words, these elders represent a true "interest
group" — their families, trades, and community.
The central-type government is the cause and effect of
the social upheaval. The government became a substitute
family, providing social benefits. In the process, they im
pose (legalized or otherwise) taxes, collect them, and re-dis
tribute them again (kind of)! This is an autocratic and not a democratic system, where many layers of bureaucracy are formed, whose main interest is the self-preservation of their
jobs. In the process, they complicate people's lives. The
central government's response is to use force (tax collec
tors, police, military, etc), more bureaucracy and more au
tocracy in the name of "enforcing the laws".
The only equitable, harmonic, and efficient system is the commonwealth-type government.

Work Ethics
The Ancient Egyptian tombs portray daily life activi
ties in the presence of the neteru or with their assistance,
signifying the importance of active work as a prerequisite to be admitted into higher heavenly realms. The whole 42
Negative Confessions that one must adhere to are about work performance and work ethics, such as:
I have not laid waste the ploughed land.
Ancient and Baladi Egyptians are identified by their
work. The person's family name was/is the family's profes
sion/trade (Carpenter, Smith, Farmer, Taylor, ...etc.). Work
is honorable, as per an instruction from an Ancient Egyptian papyrus:
3e industrious, an idle man is not honorable.
Most references in Ancient Egypt were to farming, which is/was the main, but not the only, occupation. Farm
ing, however, provides the best metaphors for our earthly
purpose — to nourish the seed within — such as the powerful symbolism of: One reaps what one sows.



118 Egyptian Cosmology - The Animated Zfnher&e
Inborn Destiny (Genetic History)
The Ancient and Baladi Egyptian societies are divided
into various labor groups. To some extent, an individual's labor group is determined by birth. Ancient Egypt, did not
have castes, in the strictest sense of the word, but the vari
ous groups recognized the inborn genetic qualities in a fam
ily lineage.
Heredity is important in determining most people's des
tinies. A common expression, "nature vs. nurture", raises
the eternal question — how much is inborn, and how much is a result of our upbringing/environment.
It would take several generations to acquire the knack
or the special skills peculiar to a given type of job. Relying
on habit, the sense of custom and tradition, Egyptians gen
erally preferred to stay within the confines of the profes
sion in which they had been raised — the ancestral profes
sion — for their own personal good and for that of society
as a whole.
Though a son usually followed the profession of his
father, owing to habit, thoughts, education, or patronage
and connection, which have existed at all times and in all
countries, he could still enter a different profession/trade,
but could only perform the less complicated tasks.
The Egyptian system allows the building up of work
experience at an early age. The inborn skills, together with
such acquisition of experience, are much more efficient and
productive than our present-day broken societies.
In our post-Industrial Revolution societies, we waste time and energy in state-mandated schooling. Most people don't become effective in their trade/profession until they are about 30 years old. To be born into a trade/profession,
one would be able to contribute at a much earlier age.

The Various Divisions
There was a genera] division of labor into five main
groups:
1 - Intermediaries, consisting of the clergy at the temples
and shrines, judges, and doctors.
2
- The farming community, consisting of nobles, farm
ers, stock breeders, gardeners, supervisors of waterway
activities and duties (such as irrigation, water and fish
ing rights, etc.), huntsmen, boatmen, traders, and shop
keepers.
3
- Specialized professionals (artisans), consisting of the
energy handlers, such as: the smiths, leatherworkers, woodworkers, weavers and bards (wordsmiths), as well as masons, and probably potters.
4
- Servile bondsmen, usually serving a long-term contract.
These are not slaves at all.
5 - This last group mainly consists of people without a permanent home address, such as the herdsmen groups, pastors, oxherds, shepherds, goatherds, swineherds,
poulterers, and fowlers.
[More details about these groups can be found in Exiled Egyp
tians: The Heart ofAfrica, by same author.]
Intermarriage between the various work groups does not normally take place (but is/was not forbidden or dis
couraged), not because of a lack of respect between the vari
ous divisions — this is not a racist or cultural superiority complex. It is meant to maximize the knowledge, by main
taining the talent of each ancestral lineage, and not to scat
ter or dilute it.



Chapter ?4 r
The Eternal Power
As per the Ancient Egyptian commonwealth system, the Pharaohs
and chiefs had no political power
their main function was to act as in
termediaries between the natural and supernatural worlds, by conducting
rites and sacrifices. They were not
expected to be leaders of victorious
armies, but were expected to secure a
regular succession of rich harvests. They were identified
with the crops, and were addressed as: Our Crop and Our Harvest.
Based on his extensive training with the powers of the
supernatural, the Pharaoh's body was believed to be charged
with a divine dynamism that communicated itself to every
thing he touched. Diodorus reported that the Pharaoh typi
cally led a restricted life. Not even the most intimate of his
courtiers might see him eat or drink. When the King ate, he
did so in private. The food was offered to him with the
same ritual as was used by priests in offering sacrifice to the
neteru (gods).
The authority of a leader/King, and his legitimacy to



24 - 7 lie ( oditut Link ///
rule over his people, were derived from his acceptance bv
his subjects as the descendant of the- founding ancestor of the people. He was, in essence, the cosmie link between the
present and the past.
According to the Ancient Egyptian Model [chapter 2],
the present is Heru (Horus), who came out of the past
Ausar (Osiris). This is eloquently illustrated in the Ausar Temple at Abtu (Abydos), as shown below, whereby Heru is
being born out of Ausar, after his death.
Accordingly, all the Pharaohs identified themselves with Heru (Horus) as a living King, and with the soul of Ausar (Osiris) as a dead King. The right to rule was considered to be a continuous chain of legitimacy, which was based on
the matriarchal principles [as explained in chapter 22].
The eternal power of the leader/King never dies. The power is merely transferred from one human body to another human body (medium). Even the British of today follow, unconsciously, the
same belief that the eternal power transfers from one hu
man body to another, when they say, "The king is dead. Long
live the king. " As if to say Ausar is dead, hong live Heru.



122 Egyptian Cosmology. - Tfie Animated Unmer&e
The Master Servant,
The Ancient Egyptian King, with the help of the priests
associated with him, via the ancestral spirits, established a
proper relationship between the people and the supernatural forces. The leader was regarded as having a personal influence over the works of nature, to whom divine honors were paid and to whom divine powers were attributed.
The Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh was an earthly image of the sum of divine energies of the
universe (neteru). As such, he con
tinually performed the necessary
rituals for proper relationship and
communication with the neteru
(the powers of the universe), in or
der to maintain the welfare of the
state, and to insure the fertility of
the earth, that it may bring forth sustenance. Each year, the King hoed the first plot of farming land
an d sowed the first seeds. If the Pha
raoh did not perform the daily lit
urgy to the neteru, the crops would perish. He spent his time performing his duties to his people, by performing the necessary rituals, from one temple to another throughout
the whole country.
Despite the repeated charges of vanity against the Pharaohs, it is worth remembering that their abodes while on earth were never made of stone, but of mud-brick, the same material used by the humblest peasants. These humble mortal monarchs believed that the impermanent body, formed of clay by Khnum, the ram-headed neter, called for an equally impermanent abode on this earth. The earthly houses of the Kings have long since returned to the earth from which
they were raised.

Keeping The Flame Alive
The fertility of the soil, the abundant harvests, the
health of people and cattle, the normal flow of events and
all phenomena of life, were/are intimately linked to the po
tential of the ruler's vital force.
The Egyptian King was not supposed (or even able) to reign unless he was in good health and spirit. Accordingly,
he was obliged to rejuvenate his vital force, by regularly at
tending physical and metaphysical practices, which are
known as the Heb-Sed rituals.
One of the Heb-Sed rituals was to induce a near death
experience, so that the King could travel in the higher realms, to rejuvenate his cosmic powers. When he returned back, he would be a "new" King. More meaning to the phrase:
The King is dead — Long Live the King.

The Ancient and Baladi Egyptians made/make no distinction between a metaphysical state of being and one with
a material body. Such a distinction is a mental illusion, as
accepted now in scientific circles, since Einstein's relativity
theory — that matter is a form of energy.
The universal energy matrix — according to the Egyp
tian traditions — consists of the unity of nine (7 heavens
and 2 lands) inter-penetrating and interactive realms. As such, Ancient and Baladi Egyptians maintained/maintain communications between their earthly realm and their an
cestral spirits and neteru (gods), in the other realms.
The most common communications were/are between earthly beings and their ancestor spirits, who inhabit the first higher/heavenly realm (the one nearest Earth). The
spirits (energies) of the departed are supposed to mingle
freely with the living, in their earthly journeys. The de
parted spirits convey warnings, encouragement, direction, and admonitions to human beings through various means, such as in dreams, or through subtle communications via
birds, animals, a candle flicker, ...etc. The interactions with the other non-earthly realms
were/are achieved via specialized intermediaries.

The Intermediaries
In order to have pence, stiihility, good health, and pros
perity, it is necessary to stay in harmony with nature. An
tisocial acts or had luck signal that this harmony has been
upset, thereby requiring efforts to restore it through ritual
acts, such as sacrifices, libations, communions, dances, and
symbolic struggles. It is therefore important to determine
who or what is responsible for any disorder. Trained inter
mediaries are employed to rectify these disorders and im
balances, by interpreting spiritual forces, and providing the
means to influence them.
1 - On the cosmic level — The priesthood at the large
temples were/are the officially delegated subordinates of the King.
They perform the necessary rituals to ensure the well-being of the land and people. These large temples were built as shrines for the neteru
(the divine aspects/forces of the uni
verse) . Any equilibrium between the mass of humanity and the divine aspects are thus maintained by the Pharaoh/leader and the priesthood.
[More about the role of the Pharaoh/
leader in chapter 24.]
2
- On a societal level — The chief of every large village,
town, or district, usually attaches/attached a man to
his service, who was believed to be able to hold com
munication with the ancestor spirits and to have influence with them. This person was also believed to possess powers of an occult character with which, when
necessary, he could control, limit, or abrogate the ac
tion of evil spirits.



126 Egyptian Qosmolagy - Tfie cAnimated 'Univer&e
Two common terms, "magic" and "sorcery", both rep
resent the ability to influence life forces. From society's
standpoint, "magic" is positive or neutral. On the one
hand, "magicians" try to influence life forces to alter
the physical world, perhaps to bring good fortune or a
return to health. "Sorcerers", on the other hand, are
antisocial, using sorcery to control or consume the vi
tal force of others. Unlike "magicians", whose identity
is generally known, sorcerers hide their supernatural
powers, practicing their rites in secret.
When misfortune occurs, people often suspect that sor
cery is at the root of their troubles. They seek counsel
from "diviners" or "magicians" to identify the source
of the problem, and to help to rectify the situation. If
the disruption is deemed to threaten everyone, leaders may act on behalf of the community at large to coun
terbalance the negative forces. In the process, no individuals are prosecuted, condemned, or punished. This
is unlike the common christian and moslem witch hunts,
whose real goal is to prosecute the non-believers of their
dogmas.

- On an individual level — Special practitioners in Ancient and Baladi Egypt dealt/deal with everyday life
disorders such as: misfortune, sickness, infertility,

disputes, marital or career choices, etc.
If it is thought that an "evil spirit" has possessed a per
son, the "diviner" or "magician" may take care of it, or an exorcist with a greater degree of specialization may
be called in.
These special practitioners {medicine men) are the ones who dispense and activate the inner powers of charms, bags full of fetishes, and medicinal products, prior to
their use. [More about such items at end of this chapter.]

The Cosmic Shrines (Temples)
The Egyptian temples were not built for public wor
ship, but as shrines for the neteru (gods, goddesses), who
represent the different powers of the One God. The temple
is the link, the proportional mean, between the Macrocosmos (world) and Microcosmos (man). It was a stage on which meetings were enacted between the neter/netert (god/god
dess) and the King, as a representative of the people.
The Egyptian temple was a machine for maintaining and developing divine energy. It was the place in which the
cosmic energy, neter/netert (god/goddess), came to dwell
and radiate its energy to the land and people.
Only after the neteru (gods) had examined the temple
destined for them, did they come and dwell there, as clearly
stated in this Ancient Egyptian text:
When the great winged scarab rises from the primordial
ocean and sails through the heavens in the guise of Her
u
[Horus] . . .he stops in the heaven before this temple and
his heart is filled with joy as he looks at it. Then he be
comes one with his image, in his favorite place . ... he is
satisfied with the shrine that the king . . . has erected for
him:
The walls of the Egyptian temple were covered with
animated images — including hieroglyphs — to facilitate the communication between the Above and the Below. Understanding this function helps us to regard Egyptian art as something vital and alive. Therefore, we must forego viewing the temple as an interplay of forms against a
vague historical, archeological presentation. Instead, we
must try to see it as the relationship between form and func
tion.



128 Lggptian Cosmology - Tfie Animated 'Univei'&e
The harmonious power of the temple plans, the images
engraved on the walls, and the forms of worship — all led to
the same goal; a goal that was both* spiritual, as it involved
setting superhuman forces in motion, and practical, in that
the final awaited result was the maintenance of the country's
prosperity.
The temple's rituals were based upon and coordinated with the movements of the heavens, which were in turn manifestations of divine cosmic law. The temple's rituals
included, among other things, presenting material offerings:
bread, beer, rolls of linen, meat, fowl, and other goods.
Offerings are the fruit of the Egyptians' labor, literally
and figuratively — the transformed products of raw mate
rial. The neteru did likewise — transforming Nun into orderly creation. The Egyptian view was that all mundane activities were resonant with the cosmic process of trans
forming raw matters into perfected creations.
The natures of material objects were transmuted into spirit entities when they were laid upon consecrated altars.
The character of the Egyptian offering is shown by the com
mon word for offering, hetep, which means a gift of peace,
or propitiation. The stone or wooden tablet on which the
offerings were laid is also called hetep. The altar was be
lieved to possess the power of transmuting the offerings that
were laid upon it, and of turning them into spiritual entities
of such a nature that they became suitable "food" for the
neteru/spirits. In other words, the neteru consume only the
spirits, or "doubles", of the bread, beer, vegetables, meat,
oil, etc. [More about offerings on pg 131.]

Shrines of Wali-s (Shepherds/Saints)
As stated on page 64, beings from higher realms de
scend to the earthly realm as human beings, to aid and as
sist others. These people are considered to be gifts from
God, and are called Wali-s (caretakers, shepherds). When
they are in their earthly realm, they show signs of super
natural powers. They are the intermediaries between the
earthly living beings and the supernatural, heavenly realms.
After these Wali-s leave earth, people continue to com
municate with them. Each Wali conveys to the earthly liv
ing beings a location for a meeting place — a shrine. As a
result, a shrine is set apart for him/her, which is tended and
kept clean by his/her descendants, free of charge for visi
tors. Such shrines, in most cases, are not their tombs. These
shrines dot the Egyptian landscape since its earliest known
history.
Ancient and Baladi Egyptians stayed/stay in touch with
the Wali-s. People regularly visit the Wali-s — at their shrines
— from surrounding communities. It is a social obligation
to visit them, especially on his/her mou-led (birthday). An
cient and Baladi Egyptians attend such mouleds of Walis, all
over Egypt. The official annual number of mouleds is esti
mated at more than 3,000 (1998).
In addition to visitations, people may also ask these Wali-s
for personal favors. Vows are made by individuals that if
the Wali resolves a personal concern, the vower will donate
certain items for charity.
Unlike the christian saints, W;ali-s are chosen by ordinary people based on performance. Once the people can
see that this person does indeed have the ability to influ
ence supernatural forces, in order to assist those on earth, and as a result fulfills their wishes, then s/he is recognized
as a Wali.

Visiting Family's Ancestors
In concurrence with the universal energy matrix, departed ancestors inhabit in the first heaven/realm, nearest
to the earthly realm. They connect these two worlds spe
cifically by linking earthly lineage members with their ear
liest forebears. Because of their proximity, and because they
once walked the earth, ancestors are prone to intervene in
daily affairs. This intervention is particularly likely in the
case of individuals who did not make it to the next realm and are "stuck" in limbo between the earthly and heavenly
realms. In such a case, special rituals are made to encour
age these spirits to take their leave with serenity.
As there is no distinction between the physical (earthly)
and metaphysical society, departed family members are regu
larly visited (once a week), as a social obligation by their earthly relatives. Ancient and Baladi Egyptians had/have no problem communicating with their departed relatives.
Trees, as part of the animated universe, act as a convenient medium between the earthly and departed souls. The
Egyptian term for sacred grove,
is Ginne-na / Guinea-na, meaning
the place of ancestor spirits. If a
gin (ancestor) tree — a tree with
a spirit living in it — is nearby,
people often write notes and attach them to the branches of the
tree.
Wise men and women consult departed spirits constantly,
and periodically spend several
days with them at the spirited
grove.

The Physical/Metaphysical Offerings
The energy matrix of* the physi
cal body will disintegrate — weaken
and ultimately die — if it is not pro
vided with food and drink. Likewise,
a departed spirit (energy matrix) requires sustenance; otherwise it will disintegrate, decompose, or convert into other forms of energies. In simple
terms, departed souls are always hun
gry and thirsty, and so must be sup
plied with food and drink.
As stated on page 128, the spirits/energies of the higher
realms only consume the spirit of the offerings.
The Ancient and Baladi Egyptians made offerings to
the spirits of their ancestors, with the intention of keeping
their help and protection by maintaining their existence. Their existence was finite, and appears to have terminated whenever funerary offerings failed to be made to them on a
regular basis. Neglect would cause them to lose their force
that helped those still living on earth.
Animal sacrifice was/is the main method to communicate with the metaphysical energies/spirits. Ancient and
Baladi Egyptians ate/eat the meat of the sacrificed animals,
so as to be blessed by the supernatural forces who consume
the spirit of these animals. Eating meat was/is not consid
ered to be a part of their standard diet.
Bad spirits are also offered sacrifices to appease them,
when some evil has befallen the family. The powers of evil/ mischievous spirits were believed to be greater than while on earth, for their freedom from the body gave them greater ability to do harm to people. This action is in concurrence
with the common saying, "Give the devil its due!"

Dwellings for the Wandering Spirits
As stated earlier, the spirit/energy matrix that animated
the human flesh/matter at birth, and left the body (matter)
at death, can likewise reside in any other matter, for as long as it wants to. In order to communicate with a departed
(free) spirit, a dwelling place — a condensed form of en
ergy, possibly matter — is needed, in order for the free spirit to manifest and communicate its will and influence to the
living beings on earth. Neteru and ancestral spirits possessed
places in which to dwell, and they were believed to enter
and leave their statues at will. Therefore, the Ancient and
Baladi Egyptians provide dwelling places for spirits of all
kinds, in the form of statues and amulets.
• Statues — Statues and effigies in temples served as
dwelling places for the neteru/cosmic energies. These statues were carefully designed to match each neters
exact replica.
A passage from the stele of King Neferhotep (5,000
years ago) at Abtu (Abydos), describes his plan to seek original information from the archives, about the exact
traditional form of the statue of Ausar (Osiris):
I will fashion [him, his limbs-his face, his fingers] ac
cording to that which my person has seen in the rolls
of his [forms].
The [Egyptians also prepared a fig
ure or statue of the deceased per
son, taking great pains to give it
all the characteristics of the de
ceased, so that the ka might recognize it as an image of its body and
be pleased to enter into the figure and take up its abode there. These
figures or statues were placed in
the tomb with the body.

Amulets — Amulets are/were used to provide their us
erswith certain powers, mostly for protection f rom evil spirits. The Egyptians wore amulets of all kinds when
living, and placed amulets on bodies of the dead he
cause it was thought that the benevolent, in-dwelling
spirits would protect them from the evil spirits. The tombs of Egypt have yielded untold thousands of beads
of all kinds, shells, teeth of animals and men, pendants, etc., which could be worn as necklaces. The same prac
tice continues with Baladi Egyptians.
For those who could not afford a properly made stone or metal amulet, it was sufficient if a man were pro
tected by a drawing of the amulet and a written copy of
the words that were associated with it. Thus, in the
Book of the Coming Forth By Light, we have pictures of several amulets, each accompanied by its formula.
Neither the Ancient Egyptian nor their Baladi descen
dants believed in the divinity of their amulets or fetishes, and they never considered them to represent
deities. These objects are simply local residences. A
spirit (energy matrix) can live anywhere, and in any
thing. The thing itself, the material itself, is nothing more than a medium. The user makes a clear distinc
tion between a certain material object and the spirit,
for the time inhabiting it. For this reason, nothing is
too small, or too ridiculous, to be considered fit for a
spirit's local residence. For when the spirit is supposed
to have gone out of that thing, i.e. vacate it, and defi
nitely abandons it, the object itself is discarded/thrown
away as useless.

Astronomical Consciousness
Egypt, recognizing the influence of the heavens on
earth, observed the skies with the utmost attention. The data of astronomy was studied for its meaning: that is to say, the study of correspondences between events in the
heavens and events on earth. Astronomy and astrology were,
for them, two sides of the same coin.
A systematic kind of astronomical observation began in very early times. The most ancient astronomical texts,
presently known, are found on the lids of wooden coffins dating from the 9 th Dynasty (c. 2150 BCE). These texts are
called 'diagonal calendars' or 'diagonal star clocks'. They give
the names of the decans (stars which rose at ten-day inter
vals at the same time as the sun), of which there were 36.
More elaborate star charts were found in the New Kingdom ( 1 550-1070 BCE) on the ceiling of the tomb of Senenmut,
Queen Hatshepsut's architect, and on the ceiling at the
temple of Abtu (Abydos). In the tombs of Ramses IV, VII,
and IX, inscriptions that relate to the first and the 16 th day
of each month, give the position occupied by a star at each
of the 12 hours of the night in relation to a seated figure:
over the left ear', 'over the right ear', etc.

"The Egyptian priests are supreme in the science of the
sky... [the Egyptians]. ..impart some of their precepts; al
though they conceal the greater part. [The Egyptians] revealed to the Greeks the secrets of the full year, whom the latter ignored as with many other things. .
.
"
"Modern" astronomy is accredited to the works of Johannes Kepler (1571-1630 CE), and that he "discovered" the three planetary laws:
Law 1. The orbit of a planet/comet about the sun is an
ellipse with the sun's center of mass at one focus.
Law 2. A line joining a planet/comet and the sun sweeps
out equal areas in equal intervals of time.
Law 3. The squares of the periods of the planets are proportional to the cubes of their semi-major axes.
Yet none of these Western academicians tell us how
Kepler arrived (out of thin air) at these conclusions. In truth,
Kepler boasted in print, at the end of Book V of his series,
Harmony of the World, that he rediscovered the lost laws of Egypt, as stated below:
"Now, eighteen months after the first light, three months after the true day but a very few days after the pure Sun of that most wonderful study began to shine, nothing restrains me; it is my pleasure to yield to the inspired frenzy, it is my pleasure to taunt mortal men with the candid acknowledgment that I am stealing the golden vessels of the Egyptians to build a tabernacle to my God from them, far, far away from the boundaries of Egypt. "
The jubilant Kepler did not state that he himself discovered anything. Rather it was all Ancient Egyptian.

The Earth's Wobble and the Zodiac Ages
Let us review the cause of the zodiac ages. The moon
and the sun both tug, gravitationally, on the equatorial bulge
of our earth. The moon tries to get the bulge into the plane
of its orbit around the earth, and the sun tries to get this
bulge into the plane of the earth's orbit around the sun. As
a result, the earth does not spin true upon its axis: but more
like a slightly off-center spinning top. The combined result
of these two tendencies causes the axis of the Earth to make
a double cone in space, centered on the center of Earth. This
motion is called precession.
If the sky is regarded as a constellated backdrop, then
because of the wobble of the earth upon its axis, the vernal
equinox each year rises against a gradually shifting back
ground of constellations. Astronomers call this the preces
sion of the equinoxes.
The precession of the equinoxes, through the constel
lations, gives names to the various twelve zodiac ages. It
takes roughly 2,160 years for the equinox to precess through
a zodiac sign. Thus it takes some 25,920 years for the spring
equinox to traverse the full circuit of the constellations of
the twelve zodiac signs. This complete cycle is called the
Great Year.
Western academia disregarded the overwhelming physi
cal evidence, as well as the affirmation of ancient sources,
that the precession of the equinoxes was known in Egypt,
since its recovered archeological findings (5,000 years ago). Academia handed the credit to the Greek Hipparchus of the 2nd century BCE. They never tell us how he arrived at such
phenomena out of thin air. Kepler told us, honestly, "with
the candid acknowledgment that I am stealing the golden ves
sels of the Egyptians to build a tabernacle to mv God from them,
far, far away from the boundaries of Egypt. "

The Zodiac Constellation of Ancient Egypt
The zodiac constellation of Ancient Egypt is shown al
the Het-Heru (Hathor) Temple at Dendera. It is clearly
Ancient Egyptian, with its figures, symbols, etc.
The Zodiac Constellation in Ancient Egypt
Even though this temple, like a few other Ancient Egyp
tian temples, was restored during the Greco-Roman period, they were all rebuilt according to Ancient Egyptian plans and symbols.



138 Hjgyptian Cosmology - Tfie Animated Universe
The texts inscribed irr the crypts of the temple of Het
Heru at Dendera clearly state that the temple that was restored during the Ptolemaic Era was base d on drawings dating back to King Pepi of the 6 th Dynasty (2400 BCE). The
drawings themselves are copies of pre-dynastic documents.
The text reads:
"The venerable foundation in Dendera was found in
eariy writings, written on a leather roll in the time of
the Servants ofHeru ( = the kings preceding Mena/
Menes), at Men-Nefer [Memphis], in a casket, at the
time of the lord of the Two Lands... Pepi.
"
Affirmation of the Egyptian knowledge of the zodiac
ages came from Herodotus. He reported that Egyptian priests informed him that the sun had twice set where it now rose, and twice risen where it now set. The statement refers to
the progressional cycles of the equinox. The progression
results in the rising against a different sign of the Zodiac approximately every two thousand years.
In Rhythm with the Zodiac Ages
There is strong evidence throughout Egypt that the zodiac was known, and was implemented in their works, at least as far back as the Age of Leo (the Lion). A single
historical piece of evidence — the Sphinx (a lion with hu
man head) may be that physical evidence.
Egypt responded to the different zodiac ages by apply
ing different means and modes of expression for each zodiac age, which were based upon the inherent specific na
ture of each age. The applications included items, such as
the character of buildings, artwork, names, ...etc.

The Age of Taurus (The Bull)
About 4000 BCE, the
symbolism of Mentu, the bull, became the most predominant
feature of Egyptian art.
Many of the Kings of the Old Kingdom incorporated Mentu in their names. The Age of Taurus (Mentu the Bull) ended with the Pharaohs Mentuhoteps I to V. In the Temple of Mentu dedicated to Mentuhotep II, the King is shown as an old man.
This is contrary to the Egyp- Mentu, the Bull
tian practice of depicting the Pharaohs in the prime of their
life. The depiction of Mentuhotep II as an old man, signi
fied the end of the Age of Taurus, the Bull.
The Age of Aries (The Ram)
When the Age of Aries (the Ram) arrived (about 2000 BCE), the Egyptian records revealed the new Age. Mentu the bull disappeared, and was succeeded by the ram of Amen/Amon/ Amun. Amen rose to eminence with his ram-headed symbol.



140 Egyptian Cosmology. - Tfie Animated 'Universe
Ram-headed figures dominated the Egyptian buildings. Ramheaded sphinxes were aligned at the entrance of the Karnak Temple, dedicated to Amen. The Pharaohs* incorporate Amen in the names they assumed: Amenhotep, Tutankhamen, etc.
Additional confirmation of the ram-headed Amen and
its symbolism during the Age of Aries, is found in the Triple Shrine of Amen/Mut/Khonsu, at the Karnak Temple. On
the left wall, Amen/Amon/ Amun is pictured as a ram,
traveling across the heavens
on his barge. This represen
tation, together with the references in many texts to Amen as a ram in the sky,
support the astronomical/as
trological significance.
Some people invented, without any evidence whatsoever, a priestly power struggle at around 2000 BCE, and the
result was the victory of Amen's priests. There is absolutely no evidence of priestly warfare during the history of An
cient Egypt, except with the 'apparent' case of Akhenaton.

Our Turpme mi "EortA
Sound Reunification
The essence of the Egyptian metaphysical beliefs is that
man is created to accomplish a specific role, within the grand cosmic scheme. According to Egyptian traditions, one cannot succeed in earthly life merely by default. One must use his metaphysical faculty (mind symbolized by the heart) and
his physical faculty (action symbolized by the tongue) . These actions will be in agreement or at variance with natural har
mony. If during his/her earthly life, the actions are not harmonious with nature, s/he will reincarnate again to the
earthly realm, to try another time.
The ultimate objective of the earthly man is to develop
his/her consciousness to the utmost perfection; it means that he/she becomes harmoniously tuned with nature. This was symbolized in some Egyptian tombs by the deceased soul reciting the 42 Negative Confessions, on the Judgment Day,
before the 42 jurors/neteru. [More later in chapter 29.] The
successful person was declared to be Sound, by the Grand
Jury as Maa Kheru — True of Voice.
Since all creation, including human, came as a result of
the word (sound), the reunification with our Divine Origin
must follow the same route back, i.e. with (true) sound
resonating with NaTuRe (NeTeRu).

Go Your Own Way (Ma-at)
The Ancient Egyptian religion is not a matter of creed and dogma, but rather of a personal charter. Each one of us
is an individual. As it is shown throughout this book, the Ancient Egyptians implemented their beliefs in individual
ity in all their texts. As shown earlier, there were never two
identical transformational (funerary) or medical (so-called
kt magical") texts for any two individuals.
One must live his/her own life, and each one of us must go his/her own way, guided by Ma-at. The concept of Maat has permeated all Egyptian writings, from the earliest times and throughout Egyptian history. The concept by which not only men, but also the neteru
(gods) themselves were governed. Ma
at is not easily translated or defined by
one word. Basically, we might say that
it means that which, of right, should he;
that which is according to the proper order and harmony of the cosmos and of neteru and men, who are part of it.
Ma-at could be favorably compared with the Eastern concept of karma and the Western concept of com
mon sense.
Ma-at, The Way, encompasses the virtues, goals, and
duties that define the acceptable, if not ideal, social interac
tion and personal behavior. Ma-at is maintained in the world by the correct actions and personal piety of its adherents.
The Egyptians felt that they did not need codifications
of Ma-at or its related humanistic ethics. Man had a vivid



Ow Vurpo&e On I cuiA
awareness of his/her inner sense of human justice, Addi
tionally, codifications of moral behavior is impractical. I 01
example, to state a commandment, such as "Thou shalt not
kill", is not applicable in a case of self-defense. Therefore,
the most and only effective way to describe correct actions
is with the use of proverbs. An example proverb, such as
One reaps what one sows, can never be translated into a com
plete list of commandments. Yet the symbolism of the prov
erb is easily understood by everyone. It is neither too spe
cific nor too vague.
The Ancient Egyptian wisdom has always laid great
emphasis on the cultivation of ethical behavior and service to society. The constant theme of the Egyptian wisdom lit
erature was the 'acting out' of Truth — Maa-Kheru — on
earth. The expected conduct and the ideas of responsibil
ity and retribution were expressed in several literary com
positions that are usually termed as wisdom texts. Among
them are the 30 chapters of The Teaching of Amenemope, which contain collections of poetic phrases of moral content and
advice.
The 30 chapters of The Teaching of Amenemope were later echoed in the Old Testament's Book of Proverbs. Numerous verbal parallels, occur between this Egyptian text and the
Bible, such as the opening lines of the first chapter:
Give your ears, listen to the words which are spoken, give
your mind to interpreting them. It is profitable to put
them in your heart.
There were additional practical wisdom texts of sys
tematic instructions, composed of maxims and precepts.
Some of the wisdom proverbs, as collected from sur
vived Egyptian papyri include:
- Don't be proud of earthly goods or riches, for they come



146 Lijx/plidn Cl\si]io/ol)\/ - Tfie Animated 'Univei'&e
to you from God without your help.
- Don't repeat slanders.
- Deliver messages accurately. f 1
- 3e content.
- 3e industrious, an idle man is not honorable.
- Do not enter uninvited into the house of another.
- Do not look around in the house ofanother. Ifyou see any
thing, be silent about it, and don't relate it to others.
- Speak not too much, for men are deaf to the man of many
words.
- Guard your speech, for "a man's ruin lies in his tongue".
- Do not overeat.
- Don't eat bread while another person is present unless you share the bread with him.
- He who is rich this year, may become a pauper next year.
- 3e respectful, and do not sit down while another stands
who is older than you, or who holds a higher office than
yours.
As one charters his/her way through the earthly realm,
it is beneficial to get tips from your spiritual guide — the
khu. Each person has a khu — a luminous guardian angel
[see page 108]. These luminous spirits are eager to help you see the way, but no one can do it for you. You must do it on your own.
We are not born sinners; we are born with the power of choice. The earthly being must use his cerebral instrument
to choose his actions. Each one of us has a heart (consciousness/mind) and a tongue (action/deliverance). Each one of
us must know how to manage the energies — all the forces,
desires, emotions, etc, in and around us.
How the Egyptians dealt with, for example, sexual de
sires and egotism, will be described next.



27 Ow n\urpQ6A On I iti Iti If,
Tame That Bull
The universe cannot exist without the ability to repli
cate, i.e. reproduce. The wild hull, which is a nearly univer
sal symbol for sexual power, symbolizes boundless strength
and fertility. Bulls are esteemed for their sexuality, for a
single animal can impregnate an entire herd. As such, the
wild bull is a symbol for untamed sexual energy.
Egyptian traditions believe in taming (not denying) the
sexual energy. The lassoing and taming of the wild bull symbolizes the control of such energy, as depicted on many
Egyptian wall reliefs. Shown below is a wall relief in the
temple of Abtu, depicting Ramses II and a prince control
ling a bull. The symbolic bull is not bullied, injured, or
killed. It is not a frivolous game.
In Ancient and Baladi Egypt, boys are circumcised shortly after reaching puberty, mostly during the mouleds
(saints' birthday celebrations). After the operation, they
live in isolation, where the boys will be actively transformed
into adulthood by learning what adults must know to as
sume societal responsibilities. This will be the metaphysi
cal and physical boot camp. Boys are taught how to manage their inner energies.
Teaching the male members of the society self-control is an
essential aspect of any society.

Don't Be An Ass
Controlling the ego was/is one of tL most important ethical requirements in Ancient and Baladi Egypt. One of the Egyptian King's title was, The Most Humble. His abode while on earth was made of mud-brick, the same
material used by the humblest peasants.
The ego is symbolized by the ass. One must know how
to control it, by riding the ass — the ego. Egyptian scenes (such as the one shown below) and texts provide the ass
analogy that was resonated later in the following biblical verses, which describe the same concept of being humble
and controlling the ego.
"Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted
on an ass, and on a colt, the foal of an ass." [Matthew,
21:5]
The Ancient Egyptian transformational (funerary) texts
show that one must overcome many obstacles on one's way
to the ultimate reunification. One of these obstacles is the ego. To reunite with the Divine we must be ego-free.



The Symbolic Ancient Egyptian scene below shows Heru ( I lot us) and his four sons, each armed with a knife-, demon
strating to Ausar (Osiris) their success in controlling the ego.
Their success is symbolized by the ass-headed man (symbol of the ego in man), with knives stuck in his body and bound
by his arms to the forked stick.
Be humble. Don't be an ass. In an Instruction given in
2380 BCE to a soon-to-be high official, the words begin as
follows:
Do not be arrogant because you are learned; do not be over-confident because you are well informed. Consult the ignorant man as well as the wise one.

The Tenants9 Rights & Obligations
The Ancient and Baladi Egyptian beliefs in Animism
were also reflected in their traditional relationships between
people and earth. The Egyptians believed/believe that land
had no value apart from people, and, conversely, that people
could not exist without land. They recognize and respect
the supernatural residents of the land — any land. The spirits
of a place (trees, rock outcroppings, rivers, snakes, and other
animals and objects) were identified and placated by the
original founders, who arrived and inhabited the land at an
earlier time. The spirits of the land might vary with each
place, or be so closely identified with a group's welfare that
they were carried to a new place, as part of the continuity of a group with its former home.
The rights of a group, defined by common genealogical
descent, were linked to a particular place and the settlements
within it, not through "ownership", but because of their
pact with the primordial spirits of the land/site. The spir
its, both of family and place, demanded loyalty to commu
nal virtues and to the authority of the elders in maintaining
ancient beliefs and practices.
Newcomers (spiritual migrants) join the local spirit population in a new covenant between themselves and the



28 Veace WM Earth 151
local spirits. This covenanl Legitimized their arrival. In re
turn for regular homage to these spirits, the founders could
claim perpetual access to local resources. In so doing, they
became the lineage in charge of the hereditary local priest
hood and village headship, and were/arc recognized as "ten
ants of the place" by later human arrivals.
The Ancient Egyptian transformational (funerary) texts
maintain the same theme regarding the tenants' rights and
obligations. As such, a new spirit must gain the acceptance and support of previous spirits, in each of the realms of the
"other world". [More details in chapter 29.]
This spirit of Animism makes people environmental
ists, for they treat everything with care and respect. Such
coexistence with nature — in all its forms — was a mandatory requirement of each person. Here are a few of the 42 Negative Confessions that emphasize that one must be true environmentalist in order to succeed in reuniting with the
Source.
7- I have not plundered the neteru.
16- I have not laid waste the ploughed land.
22- I have not polluted myself.
34- I have not fouled the water.
36- I have never cursed the neteru.
Neteru means the divine essence (spirits) impuded in
everything — plants, air, water, minerals, ...etc.
Such respect for the spirits of the land is indicative of a
peaceful (non-invasive) people who will not violate anybody
or any land. Egyptians, as such, are very peaceful people.
For the Ancient and Baladi Egyptians, stepping on a for
eign land in peace or in war, was done with careful consid
eration to the land and its inhabitants.

Rules of Engagement
i•f T
Egypt was not interested in an empire, and certainly
not in military occupation. Egypt was only interested in
neutralizing the hostile elements that threatened to disrupt her own security. There were never Egyptian colonies, and only a handful of foreign wars throughout its long history. After a war ended, they left the foreign land and its people, and returned home.
War, for the Ancient Egyptians, followed rules as strict
as a chess game, and had specific rituals. They were truly the civilized people. The wars of the 20 th century of bombing and burning would have been considered unthinkable
barbaric actions.
The common scene
on the outer walls of the
temples, and the walls of
the outer courtyards, sym
bolizes the battle of the
forces of light, represented
by the King (the spiritual

purely symbolic, and not a representation of actual histori

The Soul Transmigration
The Egyptians' preoccupation — almost obsession
with the ideas of birth and rebirth was a fundamental ele
ment of their funerary beliefs: rebirth was one of the stages
of existence in the afterlife. Egyptian texts state clearly that
the "soul is in heaven, the body in the earth" [Pepi I Tomb], i.e.
they never expected the physical body to rise again.
The first known reference to a "second birth" occurs in the CLXXXIInd Chapter of the Book of Coming Forth bij Light, wherein Ausar (Osiris) is addressed as,
" ..he [Ausar] who giveth birth to men and women a sec
ond time".
"The Egyptians", according to Herodotus, "were the first
to maintain that the soul of man is immortal". The doctrine of
transmigration is also mentioned by Plutarch, Plato, and other ancient writers as the general belief among the Egyptians, and it was adopted by Pythagoras and his preceptor
Pherecydes, as well as other philosophers of Greece.
At the end of one's earthly existence, a performance evaluation will determine which heavenly realm [2-6] a de
parted soul will reach.

Performance Evaluation
f*
In a book of instructions, an Egyptian King advised his son, the prince, to attain the highest qualities, because upon
his death, he would see his whole lifetime in a single instant, and his performance on earth would be reviewed and
evaluated by the judges. Even as far back as the period of
the 6 th Dynasty, we find the idea that heaven was reserved for those who had performed their duty to man and to the Divine Powers while on earth. No exceptions were made to a King or anyone else.
For example, the Pharaoh Unas (2323 BCE), before he was ready to fly from earth into heaven, was not allowed to start unless the neteru (who were about to help him) were
satisfied as to the reality of his moral worth. They demanded
that no man should have uttered a word against him on earth, and that no complaint should have been made against him
in heaven before the neteru (gods). Accordingly, in the text
of Unas we read:
"Una5 hath not been spoken against on earth before men, he hath not been accused ofsin in heaven before the neteru
(gods)."
As stated earlier, Ancient Egyptians expressed their
metaphysical beliefs in a story form, like a sacred drama or
a mystery play. The following are the Egyptians' symbolic
representations of the process of the Judgment Day Mys
tery Play.
1 - The soul of the deceased is led to the Hall of Judgment of the Double-Ma-at. She is double because the scale
balances only when there is an equality of opposing
forces. Ma-at's symbol is the ostrich feather, representing judgment or truth. Her feather is customarily
mounted on the scales.

development on earth. This cycle of life/death/
renewal continues until the soul is perfected, by
fulfilling the 42 Negative Confessions, during his

Transformational Texts
rI
The object of one and all Ancient Egyptian transformational (funerary) texts was the same, namely, to procure
the resurrection and immortality of the persons on whose behalf they were written and recited. Accompanying texts
to the deceased varied in content and style. No transformational ("funerary") texts of any two persons were ever the
same. These texts were tailored to match each individual's
path. We find the same individuality of texts in the so-called
"magical" papyri. [See chapter 20.] The Egyptian texts de
scribed in detail the stages of the transformation process
from man's earthly existence to the different metaphysical
realms.
All these themes are treated with a profusion of details
in The Book of Corn ing Forth By Light (Per-em-hru), wrongly translated and commonly known as The Egyptian Book of the Dead. It consists of over one hundred chapters of vary
ing lengths, which are closely related to the Unas Transfor
mational (Funerary) Texts at Saqqara. This book is to be found, in its complete form, only on papyrus scrolls that were wrapped in the mummy swathings of the deceased and buried with him.
Other transformational (so-called funerary and religious)
writings are also closely related to the above-mentioned Unas
Transformational Funerary (Pyramid) Texts. Each text/ writing explores the same basic theme, of life/death/rebirth,
i.e. transformation of the soul in the region of the Duat af
ter death, from a different angle. Since no two persons are
alike, no two transformational texts are alike. These compositions are known as: The Book of What Is In theDuat (or Underworld), The Book of the Gates, The Book of Caverns, The Litany of Ra, The Book of Aker, The Book of Day, and The
Book of Night.

Admission To the New Realm
As a result of the performance evaluation, the departed
spirits go to various realms — depending on each's achieve
ment level during their earthly existence.
The transformational texts set in motion the process
by which the new soul progresses from one realm to another. S/he must meet other requirements and be accepted before proceeding further. To be admitted to a new realm,
the dwellers of each realm must find the newcomer qualified and worthy of joining or passing through that realm.
The tenants' rights in the spirited world are the same as in
the earthly realm. [See chapter 25.]
The newcomer needs both acceptance and assistance of each realm-dweller as s/he ascends higher and higher.
So, in the Unas tomb (rubble pyramid) at Saqqara, we find
that the inhabitants of the higher realms — The People of
Light — found Unas ( ~ 2323 BCE) to be worthy, and thus are accepting and helping him to ascend and to live among them:
Utterance 336 The People of light bore witness for him; the hall showers of the sky took hold of him. They let Unas ascend to Ra.
Utterance 377 Your smell comes to Unas, ye neteru [gods), the smell of Unas comes to you, ye neteru. May Unas be with you, ye neteru, may you be together with Unas, ye neteru. May Unas live with you, ye neteru, may you live together with Unas, ye neteru.

Chapter 30

Scientists tell us that the galaxies are subjected now to
mainly two opposing forces: 1) the expulsion forces, which
cause all galaxies to move away from us, resulting from the
effect of the Big Bang; and 2) the gravitational/contraction al
forces, which pull the galaxies together.
Scientists tell us, that at a certain point in time in the
future, the universe will stop expanding and start getting
smaller. The microwave radiation from the Big Bang fireball (which is still rushing around) will start squashing down, heat up and change color again, until it becomes visible once more. The sky will become red, and will then
turn orange, yellow, white, ... and will end in the Big Crunch,
i.e. all the matter and all the radiation in the universe will
come crashing together, into one unit.
The Big Crunch is not the end by itself, for the reunited,
crunched universe — neutron soup — will have the poten
tial for a new creation, which is called the Big Bounce. The universe, as such, has no beginning and will have no end.
Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, the Ancient Egyptian
texts, which described the Big Bang, have also described, in the usual Egyptian symbolic terms, both the Big Crunch and



166 tayptian Coiunolocjy - Vie Animated 'Universe
the Big Bounce. In the Egyptian Coffin Texts, Spell 1130, we
read:
I have placed millions ofyears
between me and the son ofGeb [who is Ausar/Osiris];
then I shall dwell with him [Ausar/Osiris] in one place.
Mounds will be towns. Towns will be mounds.
As for any man who knows this spell,
he descends into the entourage of fire,
without there being a flame against him, for all time and
eternity.
• The first passage indicates that all the matter and
all the energy in the universe will return to one place Nun. This is the Big Crunch.
The first passage also indicates that only Ausar (Osiris),
as the cyclical aspect of nature, will remain at the end of the
world, signifying the potential for renewal — The Big Bounce,
then I shall dwell with him [Ausar/Osiris] in one place.
• The second passage indicates that the pure in soul,
will rejoin their divine origin, as he/she:
descends into the entourage of fire without there being a
flame being against him for all time and eternity.

The SOURCE



Amen/Amun/Amon - means Hidden, for he is everywhere, hut you can't see him. He provides the spirit that animates
the universe — in whole and in parts. As the creative
aspect, he is identified with Ra, as Amen-Ra. As the
creative urge that manifests itself as universal sexuality, he is Min-Amun.
amulet - a charm or ornament containing special powers or
symbolic representation.
Animism - The concept that all things in the universe are
animated (energized) by life forces. This concurs, sci
entifically, with the kinetic theory, where each minute
particle of any matter is in constant motion, i.e. ener
gized with life forces.
Baladi - the present silent majority of Egyptians that adhere
to the Ancient Egyptian traditions, with a thin exte
rior layer of islam. The christian population of Egypt is an ethnic minority who came as refugees, from Judaea and Syria to the Ptolemaic/Roman-ruled Alexandria.
2,000 years later, they are easily distinguishable in looks
and mannerisms from the majority of native Egyptians.
BCE Before Common Era. Also noted in other references as BC.
Book of Coming Forth By Light (Per-em-hru) consists of
over one hundred chapters of varying lengths, which are closely related to the Unas Transformational/ Funerary fso-called Pyramid) Texts at Saqqara. This book is to be found, in its complete form, only on papy

rus scrolls that were wrapped in the mummy swathings of the deceased and buried with him.
Book of the Dead - see Book of Corning Forth By Light.
CE - Common Era. Also noted in other references as AD.
cosmology - The study of the origin, creation, structure, and orderly operation of the universe, as a whole and
of its related parts.
Duat/Tuat - The Underworld, where the soul goes through transformation leading to resurrection.
Heb-Sed - Ancient Egyptian festival associated with the re
juvenation of the spiritual and physical powers of the Pharaoh.
Heru - He is the son of Ausar(Osiris) and Auset(Isis). He is
identified with the king during his lifetime. His cen
ters are located in many places, e.g. Behdet in the Delta, and Edfu in Upper Egypt.
Khepri - A symbol for the transformational
power of the sun. It is often repre
sented as a beetle within the sun-disk.
Khepri is Ra, in his form of the scarab
beetle.
matriarchy - A society/state/organization, whose descent,
inheritance, and governance are traced through the fe
males. It is the woman who transmits political rights, and the husband she chooses then acts as her executive
agent.
matrilineal - A society whose descent, inheritance, and gov
ernance are based on descent through the maternal line.



mouied The annual "birthday" celebration of a Wali (folk
saint] in Ancient and Baladi Egypt.
neter/netert - A divine principle/function/attribute of the
One Great God. (Incorrectly translated asgod/goddess),
papyrus - could mean either: 1) A plant that is used to make
a writing surface. 2) Paper, as a writing medium. 3)
The text written on it, such as "Leiden Papyrus".
Pyramid Texts - A collection of transformational (funerary)
literature that was found in the tombs of the 5 th and 6 th Dynasties (2465-2150 BCE).
scarab - amulet in the form of a black beetle, sym
bol of transformation. Also see Khepri.
stele - (plural: stelae) - stone or wooden slab or column decorated with commemorative inscriptions.
Jet - a symbolic pillar, representing the backbone of Ausar
(Osiris), the support of creation. It represents the channel through which the divine spirit might rise through
matter to rejoin its source.
ushabti - a small figurine, usually of clay, buried with the mummy and charged with performing duties in the af
terlife, on behalf of the deceased.
Wali - A saint-type person who the Baladi and Ancient Egyp
tians respect, visit, and ask favors. Unlike the christian
saints, Wali-s are chosen by ordinary people, based on performance. Once the people can see that this person does indeed have the ability to influence supernatural
forces, in order to assist those on earth, and as a result
fulfills their wishes, then he or she is considered to be
a Wali.

Sources ami "Nbte^
I believe that a scholar should not be content with re
ferring to just a single/few references to support a point. A
single reference may (and often does) intentionally/unin
tentionally omit something, or color it. Therefore, several sources must be considered and evaluated, and pieces of evi
dence must be put together like pieces of a puzzle, in the
right location and time.
Listed references in the previous section, Selected Bib
liography are only referred to for the facts, events, and dates;
not for their interpretations of such information.
The absence of several references in the Selected Bibliography does not mean that the author is unfamiliar with
them. It only means that in spite of their popularity, they
were not found to be credible sources.
Please note: 1) Sources listed are the primary sources.
Other references in the Selected Bibliography are secondary
sources; 2) If a reference to a particular Ancient Egyptian
text is used in more than one chapter, I will mention it in
the first instance only.
It should be noted that Alexandre Piankoff died sud
denly, while all his listed books were in progress. As a result, the books are a mix of Piankoff s writing and many others who hold the typical dogmatic academic conteptuous
attitude. The statements quoted in the preface of this book
are PiankofPs, who had a great respect for the spiritual depth of the Ancient Egyptian text. Unfortunately, most of the text in his books was written by others. One must notice
the marked difference in the writing.

"... Cadalla's grasp of Egyptian cosmology is awesome. ..he is able
to reconstruct the real religion of Egypt, both as esotericism and as
general practices. Far from being a primitive, polytheistic form, we have
the highest expression of monotheistic mysticism..."
