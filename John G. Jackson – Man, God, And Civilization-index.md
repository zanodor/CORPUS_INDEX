MAN, GOD, and CIVILIZATION






CHAPTER ONE
The Early Ages of the World
MAN is a child of this earth, and if we would understand his origin and
evolution, we must learn something about the history of the planet
upon which he dwells. Any theory as to how the world began must, of
necessity, contain a large element of speculation, since none of us was
present to witness that important event. As we all know, the earth is
one of a number of planets spiraling around the sun as it floats through
space.
Now, the sun is a star, and it is similar to many other stars which
twinkle like jewels set in the dome of the night sky. The other stars are
also blazing balls of fire, but they are so far away that they appear only
to be little points of light. With the unaided eye, only a few thousand
stars are visible, but the telescope and camera reveal them in such vast
numbers that attempting to count them would be a sheer waste of time.
The stars of the cosmos are as numerous as all the grains of sand on all
the seashores of the world. As these stars wander through space, many
of them travel in groups, but the majority of them just journey along as
solitary vagabonds.
The cosmos is so vast that a star is like a ship on an empty sea. Imag
ine stars as ships on a great ocean, so far apart that one ship will rarely
come within a million miles of another. With millions of stars wan
dering blindly through space for millions of years, it seems probable
that occasionally two stars might come close to each other, or even ac
tually meet in a head-on collision.
Cosmologists have promulgated theories of the origin of the world.
The late Sir James Jeans thought that billions of years ago, as our sun
roamed aimlessly through space, it was approached by a larger wan
dering star; and that the gravitational pull of the passing star was so
powerful as to raise gigantic tides on the sun. This gravitational stress



4 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
was so great that fragments of the sun were ejected into space; and
after the roving star passed on, the detached fragments continued to
circulate around the sun. In time they cooled off and became planets,
and among them was this old world of ours.
This theory, though plausible, has in recent years been superseded
by another, promulgated by Professor Raymond Lyttleton. Astrono
mers have found huge stars scattered throughout space that sometimes
become unstable and explode like huge hydrogen bombs. These stars
are called supernovae, and Lyttleton opines that one of these celestial
giants was a binary partner of the sun about five billion years ago. This
star was destroyed by a supernova explosion, and some of the debris of
the great blowup was captured by the sun. Eventually this matter
differentiated into the several planets of the solar system, of which our
own world is one. (For details of this hypothesis, the reader is referred
to 148,* pp. 170-74.)
For thousands of years after separating from the sun, the earth was a
flaming sphere of gas, but the extreme cold of interstellar space
( — 273° centigrade) gradually reduced it to a state of liquidity. Then
came the birth of the moon. While the earth was still in the fluid condi
tion and rotating more rapidly than at present, a large blob developed,
somewhat like the knob on a lemon, and this protuberance became de
tached and rounded itself into our neighbor satellite, the moon.
After more thousands of years of cooling, the earth began to wear a
solid crust. The heavier elements sank into the interior, while the
lighter ones floated to the surface. In those days, the earth was a white
hot sphere surrounded by a thick mantle of red-hot gases: hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. As the cooling process pro
ceeded, oxygen and hydrogen combined, forming water, which hov
ered over the hot crust of the earth as a blanket of steam. With the pas
sage of much time, the steam condensed into water, and settled down
over the world as a boiling ocean. There was not, at that time, much
land in the world—just a few ridges poking up through the primeval
sea—and the water was fresh, for all the salt in the sea was later washed
out of the land.
But let's not travel too fast; from whence did the land come? The
original solid crust of the earth was probably as smooth as the surface of
a billiard ball. Had it remained that way, the primordial ocean would
have covered the entire surface of the globe. In other words, there

THE EARLY ACES OE THE WORLD 5
would have been no dry land. Bur as the heavier elements of the inte
rior of the earth lost heat through volcanic activity, they contracted;
and this caused the outer crust to fall in toward the interior, and to
crumple up like the skin of a baked apple; and the ridges and depres
sions thus formed were the first mountains and valleys. The battle beT
tween land and sea began as soon as the world cooled enough to hold
an ocean. The struggle has been a long one, but the land steadily
gained on the water. Life arose in the sea, but the greatest episodes in
the drama of life took place on the land.
The problem of the origin of life is one of great interest. The world
was in existence hundreds of millions of years before it became a suita
ble abode for living things, for life can occur only within a very re
stricted zone of temperatures. There can be no life in the stars, since
they are too hot. In outer space, the intense cold likewise makes life im
possible. Thus life must have originated when the earth developed a
temperature that was neither too hot nor too cold, for life cannot sur
vive where it is either roasted or frozen. Of the one hundred-odd ele
ments of which the stuff of the universe is composed, only a very few
show any affinity for life. Living matter consists mainly of atoms which
possess the property of forming large molecules. Atoms of hydrogen
(H), for instance, may combine to form molecules of hydrogen (H2
and H 3 ); or atoms of oxygen may form molecules of oxygen (0 2 ) or ozone (0 3 ); and atoms of hydrogen and oxygen may combine to form
molecules of water (H 20) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 ). But none of
these compounds has more than four atoms per molecule, and the nitro
gen compounds behave in a similar way. But, if to the atoms of hydro
gen, oxygen, and nitrogen we add carbon, a most extraordinary thing
happens. The atoms of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon com
bine to form molecules consisting of hundreds, even thousands, of
atoms. Carbon is of prime importance in the chemistry of life.
So life first arose in the warm primeval ocean, beginning with the
evolution of chemicals capable of assimilating carbon. Of the early his
tory of life we have no record, since the earliest living things had nei
ther bones nor shells, and hence left no traces in the rocks. At the end
of the Precambrian era, animal life had not yet reached the level of the
insect or the fish. The next geological age, the Paleozoic era, is divided
into six periods.
The earliest subdivision of the Paleozoic era is known as the Cam
brian period. The five other periods, in order of succession, were the



MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian. The
dominant animal type of the Cambrian period was the trilobite—a flat
animal with a broad head shaped like a shovel, and with a three-lobed
shell on its back. It possessed numerous legs, with which it crawled and
swam, and had large compound eyes. A forerunner of the shrimp and
the crab, the trilobite reached its climax in the Ordovician period and
then gradually declined. The teeming life of the Cambrian seas (be
sides the trilobites, there were shellfish, sponges, jellyfish, and corals)
continued to develop in the Ordovician period. It was a time of great
volcanic activity, and the Ordovician seas brought forth the earliest
vertebrates. These primitive vertebrates were strange- looking crea
tures, half fish and half arthropod, and are known as ostracoderms.
They looked like primitive armor-plated fish, though they lacked artic
ulated jaws.
In the Silurian period, great revolutions occurred. There was an ad
vance of the sea on the land. The first land plants and land inverte
brates (scorpions) appeared, Echinoderms or sea lilies were the charac
teristic marine fauna. But the great event of the Silurian period was the
emergence of the true fish, and the first animal of this type was proba
bly a species of shark. The ancestor of the fish is believed to have
evolved from the cartilage notochord of some Cambrian or Silurian an
nelid (a primitive worm). Later, this cartilaginous rod divided into sec
tions (vertebrae) and hardened into bone. This backbone not only
stiffened the body of the fish, but ako provided protection for the spinal
cord; and the upper part of the backbone expanded into a boxlike struc
ture to enclose the brain. As these early fish wriggled through the
water, folds of skin sprouted out at the sides and on the back and
evolved into fins. The fish was also improved by the appearance of gill
slits in the throat, and the formation of jaws contributed to the develop
ment of the mouth. In the Devonian period, the fish were the highest
type of life in the world. There was a rise of land, and many lakes dried
up. The land was covered with plants, and insects were numerous. The waters became overcrowded, and some species of fish evolved into land
animals. A group of Devonian fishes, who lived about four hundred
million years ago, known as the Crossopterygii (lobe-finned fish), pos
sessed lungs as well as gills, so when overcrowding occurred in the
water, some of these fish, using their fins as rudimentary feet, took to
the land and changed over from gill breathing to lung breathing. In
switching from sea to land, some of the fins of these primitive fish were
evolved into feet, the rays of the fins developing into the toes of the



THR EARLY AGKS OF THE WORLD 7
feer. The evolution from worm to fish was a great ehapter in the story
of life. It may seem hard to believe that ancient wormlike animals
evolved into mollusks, echinoderms, crustaceans, and insects, and that
from the echinoderms (starfish, sea urchins, sea lilies, etc.) were devel
oped the chordates, the ancestors of all the vertebrates, including fish and man.
In the worm, eyes are pits in the skin, lined with pigment cells; in
the fish they have become crystalline lenses, able to concentrate light
and convey it to the optic nerve. In the worm, the ears begin as sensi
tive pits on the skin, in each of which lies a little stone, which give the
worm a sense of direction. In the fish, there are closed vesicles in the
skull, which have developed a sensitivity to sound waves. In the evolu
tion from worm to fish, we see the nose changing from two pits in the
skin of the head into nostrils opening into the mouth, and with an ol
factory nerve lining the passages.
The brain grows from a clump of nerve cells to an intricate structure
with a primitive cerebrum. The heart, only a swollen part of a blood
vessel in a worm, becomes in the fish a two-chambered organ for the
pumping of blood. And just as certainly as the paleontologist can trace
the fish back to the worm, the biologist can trace man's ancestors back
to the fish.
The Carboniferous period was a time of shallow seas, vast swamps,
and low-lying lands; and there was a moist and warm climate all over
the earth. The Carboniferous was the age of coal forests. The world
was blanketed by a humid atmosphere containing a high concentration
of carbon dioxide. The forests consisted of gigantic club mosses, ferns,
and horsetails. Some club mosses reached heights of over a hundred
feet, and tree ferns reared themselves twenty to sixty feet into the air.
In these dismal forests, the amphibians enjoyed a golden age. The am
phibians were evolved from the crossopterygians (lobe-finned fishes).
The double pair of fins of the lobe-fins were developed into the legs
and feet of the amphibians. The five rays of the piscine fin became the
five toes of the amphibian foot. Giant insects, spiders, and myriapods
swarmed over the land, so the sluggish amphibians had an ample diet.
The insects (over a thousand species) were of a primitive type: Orthop
tera (crickets, locusts, cockroaches, etc.) and Neuwptera (dragonflies,
mayflies, etc.). The more advanced insects, such as the Coleoptera (bee
tles) and Hymenoptera (ants, bees, etc.), had not yet evolved.
After millions of years of perpetual summer, the world began to grow colder. There was a rise in the land, which was instrumental in



8 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
bringing on an ice age. Thar ended the Carboniferous and ushered in
the Permian period. This was the Third Ice Age. (The two earlier ice
ages occurred before there was any land life, so we need not consider
them.) The rise in the land was not the sole cause of the increasing
cold. The vast coal forests had absorbed an enormous amount of carbon
dioxide from the humid Carboniferous atmosphere, and the combina
tion of a purer, thinner atmosphere and the elevation of great land
masses brought on the great Permian revolution. The colder climate
destroyed the great forests of the Carboniferous swamps, which we
now find buried underground in the form of coal.
Some of the amphibians, meanwhile, were changing with the cli
mate. They evolved from amphibians into reptiles. The appearance of
the reptile heralds the dawn of a new era; for from the reptiles were to
be developed the birds and mammals, the future rulers of the air and
the land, respectively.
With the close of the Permian period, the Paleozoic era reached its
end. This era began about 550 million years ago, and lasted for over
350 million years.
The next great division of geological time is known as the Mesozoic
era, the geological middle ages. This era began about 200 million years
ago, and lasted for more than 150 million years. It is subdivided into
three periods: Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. The Paleozoic era is
known as the Age of Fishes, because the fish was the dominant type of
animal life in that time. Similarly the Mesozoic era is called the Age of
Reptiles. How did the reptile branch off from the Paleozoic amphibian
and become the new monarch of the animal world? An explanation,
both accurate and clear, has been advanced by an outstanding author
ity:
It seems to be a well-established fact that profound changes in the natural environment have produced fundamental changes in the plant and animal
realms. Thus the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic was a time of one of the
most profound and far-reaching physical disturbances in the known history of the earth. Great mountains were being made in many parts of the world,
particularly in eastern North America and in Europe; the lands were in
creased in size and height; one of the two greatest known Ice Ages was a
feature of the Permian; and the ocean waters were affected in various ways.
These physical changes in turn caused climatic changes, altered habitats of
plants and animals, and modified sources of food for the animals. Accom
panying these changes the giant lycopods, seed ferns and cordaites became
extinct, while higher plants such as cycads and conifers began to clothe the



THE EARLY AGES OF THE WORLD 9
earth. Large groups of animals, such as tetracoralla, Mastoids, orthoceras,
trilobites and eurypterids disappeared from the waters; amphibians culmi
nated; and hexacoralla, insects, reptiles and mammals made their appear
ance. (171, p. 222)
The reptiles became the ruling race of the Mesozoic era because
they were the best fitted for survival under the prevailing natural con
ditions. Both birds and mammals branched off from the reptilian stem
in this era, but conditions were not then favorable for their rise and de
velopment; so they remained in the background while the reptiles con
quered the land, the sea, and the air. The dominant animals of land and
air during the Mesozoic were known as the Ruling Reptiles. In their
early days, many of them were small, rapid-running bipeds, standing
half-erect on their hind legs.
From such b ginnings we got the dinosaurs. Some dinosaurs were
huge beasts whose skeletons may be seen in museums, and others were
no larger than our contemporary lizards. The first carnivorous dino
saurs appeared early in the Triassic period, and they were followed by
herbivorous dinosaurs, who did not show up until near the end of the
same period. Fossil remains of dinosaurs were first uncovered in Lower
Triassic rocks in Germany, but they were widely distributed in both
the Old and New Worlds, spreading from Europe to central Asia, over
southern and eastern Africa, to India and Australia; to Patagonia in
South America; and in North America, from the Atlantic coast to the
Rocky Mountains and British Columbia. At first they lived in the drier
areas, such as the Connecticut Valley in New England. Here the geol
ogists have found their huge footprints in the rocks. In the Jurassic pe
riod, the dinosaurs seem to have dwelt mainly in low-lying coastal
lands, where the climate was hot and moist, and in swamps, lagoons,
and sluggish streams. The largest of the Jurassic dinosaurs was Bronto
saurus Excelsus, a monster who was about seventy feet long, with a
weight of about thirty-seven tons, supported by four stout pillarlike
legs, attached to a short compact body, fitted with a long neck and tail
and a relatively small head, with spoon-shaped teeth in the front of its
jaws. Brontosaurus was too heavy to walk on dry land, so he spent his
days wading in shallow waters and devouring large quantities of water
plants. A contemporary of Brontosaurus was Allosaurus, a thirty-four
foot carnivorous brute, armed with daggerlike teeth and huge talons.
The meat-eater and the vegetarian were most certainly not close
friends. As a neighbor, these beasts had Stegosaurus, who was bigger



10 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
than the largest elephant, walked on all fours, was heavily armor
plated, with two rows of bony plates sticking up on its back, and a
spiked tail. Accompanying all this bulk was a small head topped by a
horny beak; bur the poor animal had practically no mental equipment;
for its diminutive skull housed a brain that weighed only about two and
a half ounces. Another Jurassic dinosaur was an unarmored bipedal
vegetarian known as Camptosaurus, only ten feet in length, who lived
in North America. By the end of the Jurassic era, the Brontosaurus and
his friends (and enemies) had passed off the stage of evolving life. In
the Cretaceous period we meet with a new collection of monsters; for
in those days the ruling reptiles were the Trachodon, Iguanadon, Tri
ceratops Elatus, and Tyrannosaurus Rex. The Trachodon had webbed fore and hind limbs and a laterally
compressed tail which permitted it to swim, as well as wade, through
the waters. Its skin was covered with small scales, arranged in a definite
pattern, and it had a broad toothless beak shaped like that of a duck,
covered with a leathery or horny skin. The rear half of each jaw bore numerous rows of vertical teeth. (There were twenty-seven to thirty
rows, each row containing ten to fourteen teeth.) This strange-looking
animal was entirely harmless, spending his days in wading along shal
low streams and munching horsetail rushes. Iguanadon bore a close re
semblance to Trachodon, but was larger in size, and not so specialized,
except for large spikelike thumbs. Triceratops Elatus was one of the
Ceratopsia, or horned dinosaurs, and had a body of about twenty-five
feet in length and a skull over eight feet long. An enormous head was
connected with a bulky body, which had bowed legs and a short tail.
Triceratops was an ugly monster, for on top of his head was a big bony
crest, and in front of the crest was a long face and a deep muzzle,
armed with a beak. On the nose and above the eyes were two long
sharp horns, pointed straight forward. But the greatest of the dinosaurs
of the Cretaceous period was Tyrannosaurus Rex, for he was the mon
arch of all he surveyed.
There were other great reptiles, some of which took to the high seas,
and others to the air. The typical marine reptile of Mesozoic times was
the ichthyosaurus. This ancient lizard was shaped like the modern por
poise, with a long mouth full of prehensile teeth, a potent propelling
sharklike tail, with a vertical fin, a dorsal fin, and reduced hind limbs.
The fore limbs, once adapted to locomotion on land, had evolved into
paddles. It roamed the seas and subsisted on a diet of fish and cephalo
pods.



THE EARLY ACES OK THE WORLD
The great flying reptile was the pterodactyl, which developed a bat
like method of flight by means of a membrane stretched from its arms.
The fourth finger became greatly elongated and gave support to the
membranous wing. Some of these flying reptiles were as small as rob
ins, others as large as eagles. By the end of the Cretaceous period, after
millions of years of dominance, the ruling reptiles passed from the
scene.
Today the only surviving branches of the dynasty of dinosaurs are
the crocodiles and the alligators. While the ruling reptiles held the cen
ter of the stage during the Mesozoic era, there were other animals in
the wings: the birds and mammals, the dominant types of future ages.
Birds were developed from egg-laying reptiles; and this fact answers
the question, "Which came first, the hen or the egg?" Since a hen is a
bird, and the first birds evolved from egg-laying reptiles, then the egg
must have come first. Two skeletons of the oldest fossil bird (archaeop
teryx) have been uncovered in the Jurassic strata of Germany. The ar
chaeopteryx was decidedly reptilian in certain characteristics; for it had
a long dinosaurian tail with feathers growing on the sides; and it had
teeth in its jaws. Its wings possessed feathers, but resembled reptilian
arms, and ended in clawed fingers. Modern birds differ from reptiles in
having warm blood, feathers, wings instead of arms, and a horny beak
without teeth; but teeth are present in the modern bird embryo. Feath
ers were evolved from the scales of reptiles, and the avian foot still re
sembled that of the dinosaur. The mammals evolved from a group of reptiles known as the cyno
donts (the word cynodont meaning dog-toothed). In most reptiles, the
teeth vary in size in different parts of the jaw, but in the cynodonts the
teeth were differentiated into incisors, canines, and cheek teeth. The
mammals of the Mesozoic era were small animals, ratlike in both size
and appearance. While the dinosaurs roamed over the land and waded
in the waters, the primitive mammals, the ancestors of man, took to the
trees. At the end of the Cretaceous period, the ruling reptiles became
extinct, and the Age of Reptiles was over. The era following, known as the Cenozoic, was the Age of Mam
mals. But the question naturally presents itself: What killed off the
mighty dinosaurs? The answer seems to point to a change in climate.
Reptiles are coldblooded animals, and during the millions of years of
the Mesozoic, when climate was generally mild, they laid their eggs on
the surface of the earth, and let the heat of the sun hatch them out.
When the climate became cooler and culminated in a great chill, the

eggs did nor receive enough hear ro bring abour rhe harching process,
so rhe rerrible lizards passed from rhe srage of life because rhey could
nor adapr rhemselves ro a changing environmenr. In orher words, rhey
were vicrims of overspecializarion.
The Cenozoic era is divided inro rhe following periods: Paleocene,
Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, Pliocene, Pleisrocene, and Holocene. Ir

rhe Cenozoic era is rhe Age of Mammals, we propose ro concenrrare in

Grear Ice Age, and of rhe rise of modern man. The lasr-named geolog
ical period will be discussed in a larer chapter, dealing wirh rhe evolu
tion of man.
Mammals are a class of animals rhar suckle rheir young wirh milk
produced by rhe female of rhe species; in facr, rhe word mammal is de
rived from rhe Larin mammae, which means breasrs. The class Mam
malia is divided by raxonomisrs inro rhree subclasses: Prototheria (prim
irive mammals), Metatheria (modified mammals), and Eutheria (perfecr
mammals). The Prototheria form a bridge berween rhe repriles and
mammals, and of rhis subclass we have rwo living fossils: ornirhoryn
chus and echidna. The Ornithorynchus paradoxus, or duck-billed plary
pus, is a narive of Ausrralia and Tasmania, and ir is indubirably a
srrange-looking crearure. The plarypus is slightly larger rhan a mole,
and is covered wirh a dense coar of dark brown fur. Irs legs are shorr,
ending in webbed five-roed feet, and it has a broad fiat ducklike beak,
bur rhe aforesaid beak is covered with skin insread of horn. The plary

like milk reeth. This duck-mole is aquatic in its habits; it burrows in rhe
banks of srreams, and lives on worms, grubs, snails, and especially
fresh-water mussels. Like repriles and birds, ir lays large-yolked eggs,
covered with a tough membrane, which are harched our by the mother
in a nesr wirhin rhe burrow. The female plarypus has no rears, but milk
oozes through pores in rhe milk glands, from whence it is licked by the
offspring. The echidna, or spiny anrearer, inhabiring only Ausrralia,
Tasmania, and New Guinea, is a primitive mammal similar in srructure
and funcrion to the duck-mole, except that the anteater develops her
eggs in a pouch. Both of these monotremes have four-chambered mam
malian hearts; rhey are therefore warm-blooded, bur rheir remperarure
is much lower rhan rhar of rhe other mammals. The evolurionary sig



THE EARLY AGES OF THE WORLD 13
nificance of this fact is pointed out by Admiral C M. Beadnell:
The blood of the higher mammal is relatively hot, and its temperature is
more or less constant—that is, it is not unduly influenced by the surround
ing temperature. The blood of a reptile is relatively cold, with however, a
wide range of temperature variation that is directly related to the changing temperature of the environment. If the monotrematous mammals, Echidna
and Platypus, are really connecting links between the lower reptiles and the
higher mammals, we should expect their blood to be neither hot nor cold,
but lukewarm, and we should further expect it to have a fairly wide range
of temperature variation. Now the temperature of these animals is actually
intermediate between that of reptiles and the higher mammals, while the
range of temperature-variation is very liberal, as much as 1 3 degrees Cen
tigrade in the case of Echidna. (10, p. 117)
The most familiar living example of the Metathem is the Opossum,
for the eggs of the opossum are hatched within the body of the mother. The young opossums are born small and immature, and spend their
nursing period in a pouch on the belly of the mother, where they cling
fast to the nipples. Other living forms of the marsupials (pouched
mammals) are the kangaroo and rock wallaby of Australia.
The Eutheria are those mammals which nourish their young in the
uterine stage via a structure known as the placenta, and the higher
mammals, including the human family, are members of this subclass. The earlier members of the higher-mammalian stock were small ani
mals with long slender rails, five-toed limbs, forty-four teeth, and a
small head and brain. Our modern Imecttiora can be traced back to certain shrewlike creatures of the Eocene, and the insectivores are in the main line of mammalian evolution. According to Shipley and
McBride:
The most interesting circumstance about the Insectivores is the fact that when, by means of fossils, we trace back the higher groups of mammals,
they all seem to merge imperceptibly into Insectivores—i.e. the primitive
insect-eaters. There is really good ground for supposing that the living In
sectivores, though modified in special details, nevertheless represent, so far
as their general organization is concerned, the earliest type of Eutheria which appeared on the globe. From these original Insectivores advance
seems to have taken place along five lines: I. Some Insectivores took to attacking larger prey, including their own
less fortunate relations, and gradually developed into the Carnivore, or
flesh-eating mammals. These are tigers, cats, dogs, wolves, etc. II. Some became vegetable feeders, and gave rise to the great group of



J4 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
hoofed animals, relying either on their swiftness or size or strength for de
fense. These are horses, cows, elephants, etc.
III. Some took to burrowing, and developed into gnawers or rodents,
relying chiefly on their holes for safety. These are rabbits, rats, mice, squir
rels, etc.
IV. Some took to the air, the fore-limb becoming changed into a wing.
These are the bats.
V. The remainder took to escaping into trees when hard pressed, and
eventually gave rise to the great group of the primates, which includes
monkeys and man. (Cited in 10, p. 124)
The order Primates is composed of the lemurs, monkeys, apes, and
man, and these animals have the following common characteristics:
prehensile hands and feet; a clavicle (collarbone); flat nails on the
fingers and toes, instead of claws; one pair of breasts, as a rule; and a
brain, which may attain a relatively large size and great intricacy of de
velopment. There are three suborders of Primates: Lemuroidea, Tar
soidea, and Anthropoidea. In the Lemuroidea the eyes are directed out
ward, and are set in a bony ring. In the other suborders, the eyes have
the surrounding bony ring and, in addition, a bony back wall shaped
like a bowl; and the eyes are directed forward in such a way as to cause
the fields of vision to overlap, thereby creating a stereoscopic image.
The Anthropoidea have other characteristics in common: namely, the
occipital lobes of the cerebrum hang over the cerebellum; the brain is
relatively large and complex; and there is only one pair of breasts, lo
cated on the chest. In the suborder Anthropoidea, there are five fami
lies: two families of New World monkeys—the Hapalidae and the Ce
bidae; and three families of Old World apes—the Cercopithecidae,
Simiidae, and Hominadae. The New World monkeys are platyrrhine (broad-nosed), and the Old World apes catarrhine (down-nosed). Of
special interest to us are the Simiidae, or anthropoid apes, of which
there are four genera: the gibbon, orang-utan, chimpanzee, and gorilla.
These first anthropoids have been traced back to the Oligocene period,
having evolved from small tarsiods of the Eocene. The anthropoid an
cestors of the gibbon, orang, chimpanzee, gorilla, and man branched
from the common ape stock about twenty-five million years ago, in the
Miocene period. In other words, man is descended from a Miocene ape
who lived twenty-five million years ago. We find the first traces of
human fossils in the Pliocene period, after which came the Pleistocene,
better known as the Great Ice Age.
Our remote ancestors were tree-dwelling mammals; but, as they in



THE EARLY AGES OF THE WORLD 15
creased in size and weight, they became roo bulky and heavy to live in
trees, and finally had to give up arboreal life. The ancestors of the great
apes and man, in the words of Professor McCurdy,
. . . had gained from the arboreal habit erect posture, with all that it
implies, and safety from enemies. There remained little else to gain and much to lose; so by degrees arboreal life was abandoned. This step might have been taken by man's ancestors as early as the Miocene Epoch. It was a momentous step, the first step toward man's conquest of his environment
and hence of the earth. . . . Man's arboreal ancestor had been a brachiating
animal, since the erect posture, when sitting, requires this means of locomo
tion for its development. His arms were not excessively long, and his legs
were longer and stronger than those of his anthropoid contemporaries.
With erect biped gait, there came certain bodily changes, especially in the
pelvic girdle, the muscles of the legs, and above all, in the foot. The acquir
ing of the ground-dwelling habit necessitated the transformation of the foot
from a prehensile to a supporting organ. Relatively little change took place in the arms and hands. The complete freedom of the hand brought about the further opposability of the thumb, which became long enough to be op
posed to any of the other digits, and increasingly useful on that account.
The freedom of the hand led to tool-using and to tool-producing habits, and
opened the door to cultural evolution. (159, p. 17)
Up to this point, we have been dealing for the most part with the
story of organic evolution. A discussion of the childhood of man brings
us to the realm of social evolution; but, before proceeding with the
study of the early history of mankind, it is advisable to devote a chapter
to the factors and evidences of the evolutionary process.



CHAPT E R TWO
The Factors and Evidences of Evolution
NO properly educated person denies the reality of the evolutionary
process, although there is considerable disagreement among the author
ities as to the precise causation of evolution. On the fact of evolution
there is no dissent. The disagreement is on the relative values of the
causal factors of the process'.
There are several theories of evolution which attempt to explain how
the various factors have worked together to produce the actual process
of change. The principal theories are: (1) natural selection, (2) use and
disuse, (3) mutation, (4) orthogenesis, (5) isolation, and (6) hybridiza
tion.
We shall discuss natural selection, or Darwinism, first. It is a matter
of common observation that like produces like—that the offspring of
most living things resemble their parents. We recognize that cats beget
cats and not dogs; but if we examine a litter of kittens, we find that no
two of them are exactly alike. In other words, they vary. looking at
the world around us, we notice that more plants and animals come into
existence than can possibly survive; and that from this prodigality of
nature there results a struggle for existence. In this struggle, the living
forms best suited to the various environments in which they dwell will
survive; all others will perish; that is to say, only the fittest will survive.
A good example of natural selection at work may be seen in the ex
periments of Dr. Frank E. Lutz on a species of crickets near Oyster
Bay, Long Island. Dr. Lutz collected specimens of the cricket Gryllus
from four different locations: (1) on the mainland, where there was a
good grade of soil; (2) at the base of a sandbar, where the soil was poor
and sandy; (3) in the middle of the sandbar, which jutted out into the
water about 2,100 feet; and (4) at the tip of the sandbar, where there
was no soil, but only sand. The experimenter measured the ovipositors
16

(egg-laying rubes) of the female crickets found in rhese four sires. The
oviposiror prorrudes from rhe end of the body of rhe cricker and is easy
to measure. On a mainland cricker, the average length of the ovipositor
was 18 mm. (about eight-tenths of an inch); the average lengrh of rhe
organ ar the base of the sandbar was 19 mm.; in the middle of the bar,
19/2 mm.; at the tip, 20 mm. The crickers deposit their eggs in the
ground in autumn and, if they are not buried deeply enough, they are
destroyed by frost in the winter. In rhis case, soil and temperarure seem
to be the selective agents. Crickets with 18-mm. ovipositors flourish in
good soil on the mainland; but, in order for the cricket to live in pure
sand at the tip of the bar, the ovipositor must have an average length of
20 mm. These differences cannot be due to chance; so here we see a se
lective force at work, and a very discriminaring one, for it utilizes dif
ferences of only one-fifrieth of an inch. (The original report of the ex
perimenrs on crickers outlined above was entitled "The Variations and
Correlations of Certain Taxonomic Qualities of Gryllus" by Frank E.
Lutz, Carnegie Publication #101.)
Many evolutionists argue that natural selecrion by itself cannot ac
count for the entire process of evolution, but few would deny that it is
an important element in that process.
It is by no means clear [says Haldane] that natural selection will explain
all the facts. But the other suggested causes are unverified hypotheses, while
selection can be observed by those who take sufficient trouble. . . . Finally,
no facts definitely irreconcilable with Darwinism have been discovered in
the 60 years and more that have elapsed since the formulation of Darwin's views. Such a fact would be, for example, a convergence in the course of
geological time of members of two or more groups to form a single species. Actually, we observe the convergence of forms as we go down and not up a geological series. And there have been quite enough anti-Darwinian
paleontologists to have seized on such a case had it existed. (105, pp. 18-19)
Next to Darwinism, rhe mosr famous explanation of evolution is La
marck's theory of rhe inheritance of acquired characteristics, also
known as rhe theory of use and disuse. Most Darwinians have little re
spect for Lamarck, but Charles Darwin did not categorically reject the
Lamarckian principle. "It is of rhe greatest interest to recognize the
fact," as Professor Dendy points out, "that Darwin himself saw noth
ing incompatible between the so-called Lamarckian factor of use and
disuse and the direct action of the environment, and the principle of
natural selecrion, but on the other hand, that the one set of factors
might supplement the other." (62, p. 393)



18 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
In 1809, the year Darwin was born, J. B. Lamarck, a distinguished
French scientist who was both a biologist and paleontologist, published
a book with the title Zoological Philosophy, in which he formulated the
first modern scientific theory of evolution. In the first edition of his fa
mous work, Lamarck expressed his theory in the form of two laws; and
in the 1815 edition, the two laws were expanded into four. These laws are given below in Lamarck's own words:
1st Law: Life, through its own forces, continually tends to increase
the volume of every body which possesses it, and to increase the size of
its parts, up to a certain limit determined by life itself.
2nd Law: The production of a new organ in an animal body results from a new need supervening and continuing to make itself felt and
from a new activity which this need arouses and maintains.
3rd Law: The development of organs and their functional capacities
is constantly in ratio of the use which they receive.
4th Law: Everything which has been acquired, impressed upon, or
changed in the organization of individuals during the course of their
life, is preserved by generation, and transmitted to the offspring of
those which have undergone the changes.
There has arisen much controversy concerning this theory, most of it stemming from Lamarck's fourth law. The principle of use and dis
use is regarded as valid by some evolutionists, but they do not accept
the idea as originally formulated by Lamarck. The theory was revised
by Herbert Spencer, and this improved version, known as neo-La
marckism, has been accepted by some eminent evolutionists, among them being Ludwig Buchner, Ernst Haeckel, Lester F. Ward, G. Elliot Smith, E. W. MacBride, C. Tate Regan, Arthur Dendy, Alfred Giard, and William McDougall. Professor J. B. S. Haldane was a Dar
winist and, although he thought that most experiments on the inherit
ance of the effects of use and disuse had led to negative results, he still
believed that Lamarckism should not be dogmatically rejected, 'it must be remembered," said he, "that however many experiments fail, it is al
ways possible that the effects of use and disuse may be impressed on a
species at a rate not susceptible of experimental verification, yet rapid
enough to be of importance in geological time." (105, pp. 5-6)
Some of the evidence cited against the inheritance of acquired char
acteristics is not very impressive. In speaking of Lamarck, Professor Dorsey noted:
Biologists have driven a hundred daggers into his theory of evolution
through the inheritance of acquired characters; the theory is alive as ever!



THE FACTORS AND EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION 19
To find our if acquired characters could be inherited, rhousands of ani
mals were murilared; Weismann himself cur off mice's rails for rwenry-rwo
generarions! They gave ir up, realizing, as Conklin purs ir, rhar wooden legs

Novelries do ger inro life. Spinal column, prehensile rail, blue eyes, were
once novelries. There was a time when rhere was no such rhing as spine,
tail or eye, in any living being. . . . Man's arm, bar's wing, horse's leg,
whale's flipper, bird's wing, and rurrle's paddle, all evolved from rhe fin of a
fish. These are rypical adaprarions; rhey are characters which have been ac
quired; wherher inherired or not, they are rransmirred.
Bur rhey cannor be rransmirred, said Weismann, because rhe germ-plasm
is sacred, immorral and conrinuous; norhing can ger ar ir, norhing can rouch ir. Tennyson's immorral brook had norhing on Weismann's germ-plasm.
Bur rhar brook does become a river; and somehow, someway, a piece of rhe
original life-germ or germs, has come ro be a human being. . . .
Weismann's docrrine of rhe conrinuiry of rhe germ-plasm held sway for
three decades, and srill furnishes rexrs for well-meaning enrhusiasrs who
have a case ro prove. The old formulae do nor suffice ro explain rhe facrs of
evolurion. The facts have outgrown rhe old rheories. Evolurion is up and
down, back and forrh; a circularing pulsaring inexrricably woven web.

condirions in which we find rhem? Narural selecrion seems ro have been rhe
limiring facror. How have rheir organs become adapted ro rhe funcrions
they perform? The inherirance of acquired characters seems ro have been
rhe decisive factor. (72, pp. 102^4)
True scientific perspective concerning the Lamarckian factor has
also been displayed by Theodore H. Savory, an outstanding authority
on the Arachmda (spiders) and an able student of evolution. He tells us:
Biologisrs are agreed in accepring rhe rheory of evolurion as rhe only hy
porhesis able ro give a reasonable inrerprerarion of all rhe facrs of adaprarion
and disrribution of plants and animals. The problem rhar remains is the
problem of merhod—how has rhe evolurion come abour; whar has made the
organism change? A number of answers ro rhese quesrions have been pro
posed in rhe pasr, and are associated wirh rhe names of Darwin, Lamarck, Weismann, and deVries. The discussions which srill conrinue should be



20 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
concerned nor so much to decide whether these answers are right or
wrong, as to determine the extent to which each is to be considered respon
sible, or to appraise the contribution made by each method to the sum total
of evolutionary progress. Each hypothesis renders some of the facts intelli
gible, but none explains them all; only to this limited extent can there be
any rivalry between them.
There is a clear degree of dichotomy between the different theories, in so
far that some theories maintain that evolution is a transformation of one
structure into another, cliange in function and habit thereupon following,
while the others maintain that evolution is a change in habit and function
followed by and producing changes in structure. The latter view, associated with the name of J. B. Lamarck, and now usually known as neo- Lamarck
ism, is the one to which the study of the Arachnida seems to lead. (221, pp. 1 39-40)
Professor Hugo dcVries is generally recognized as the father of the
mutation theory of evolution, although the same principle was formu
lated independently by Professor Lester Ward. The mutationists claim
that evolution proceeds by sudden large changes rather than by gradual
small ones. Thus, according to deVries and his school, the small varia
tions postulated by the Darwinians would be of no value in producing
new species; for one species to evolve into another it is necessary to
have much larger variations. This theory had quite a vogue for many
years, but it is not now regarded as a serious rival to natural selection.
Mutants, or sports, as a rule have slight survival value in a state of na
ture, and they would therefore be weeded out by natural selection in
most cases.
The theory of orthogenesis, ably advocated by Professor Henry
Osborn and Dr. Robert Broom, attributes purpose to the evolutionary
process. According to this school of thought, variations do not crop up
aimlessly among life forms. The orthogeneticists believe that a mysteri
ous life force permeates all living things, and causes them to evolve in
certain predetermined directions. This elan vital, or life force, is teleo
logical in its effects, and operates independently of the environment.
Although orthogenesis seems to have a greater appeal to philoso
phers than to scientists, several outstanding scientists have adopted the
theory.
Dr. Robert Broom, the paleontologist who has done some fine work
in digging up fossils in Africa, for example, is a convinced teleologist.
"In the evolution of the horse from the little four-toed Eohippus that
lived 40,000,000 years ago to the large one-toed horse of today," he



THE FACTORS AND EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION 21
opines, "we seem to have a nearly steady succession of forms, gradually becoming larger and larger, and with more and more complicated
grinding teeth. In the opinion of many paleontologists, this steady evo
lution cannot be explained by natural selection, nor by Lamarckism,
and certainly not by sexual selection. And it looks as if some agency
has been driving the evolution along to a definite end." (25, pp. 94-95)
Dr. Broom refers to an unnamed eminent English anatomist who
differed with Professor Le Gros Clark and himself on the affinities of
the South African ape men. "From the point of view of the phyloge
netic significance that is attached to the material both by Dr. Broom
and Prof. Le Gros Clark," the anatomist asserted, "one is again in dif
ficulty because it would seem, in particular from Broom's monograph,
that the evolutionary ideas that are implied differ from views estab
lished in relation to modern studies of genetics and selection." (Cited
by Dr. Broom in 25, p. 95) To this criticism, Broom replied: "I do not know what are the opin
ions of Le Gros Clark, but 1 have long ago stated that I do not think
that Darwin's theory of natural selection gives us a satisfactory expla
nation of how evolution has come about, and I may here state as defi
nitely that 1 am equally convinced that Hunt Morgan and the other
geneticists have also completely failed to find an explanation." (25, p.
96) The theory of isolation is based on the idea that, if a group of animals
or plants of the same species are allowed to intermingle freely, there
will be little or no variation away from the type; but if the larger
groups are broken up into several smaller groups, and these are pre
vented from interbreeding, each group will vary in different directions.
The importance of isolation as a factor of evolution has been explained
by Wells, Huxley, and Wells, in their popular work on biology, as fol
lows:
When there is no geographical break, one sub-species fades gradually
into another across an intermediate zone. This is beautifully illustrated by the wrens of South America. There is an almost continuous wren popula
tion over the continent; the wrens of different regions differ markedly in
size, in color, in pattern, in proportions, but the various types grade into each other. Here and there, however, an isolated patch of wrens is separated from their congeners by some barrier, such as a high mountain range, a
stretch of sea, or a desert, and then we find no transitional forms linking them with other races. . . . This effect of isolation in helping to bring new
types into being, is one of the everyday facts of systematic biology. (267, pp. 617-18)



22 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
In 1916, the Dutch biologist J. P. Eotsy wrote a book with the title
What Is a Species? in which he argued that evolutionary progress had
been brought about largely by the crossing of species, and the resultant
development of fertile hybrids. This theory of hybridization has been
adopted by several other biologists in a modified form. We are all per
haps familiar with the amazing results of experiments in plant hybridi
zation by the plant wizard, Luther Burbank; through the genius of
whom many new plant species were created. Hybridization is not as
common among animals as in the plant kingdom, but it is not so rare as
is generally supposed. For instance, in the cattle country of western
North America, breeders have developed crosses between domestic
cattle and long-haired yaks from Tibet, between Alaskan caribou and
Siberian reindeer, and between fat-tailed Persian sheep and English do
mestic sheep.
The role of the factor of sex in evolution is of great importance, and
something must be said about it. Though the higher forms of plant and
animal life are sexually propagated, the primary role of sex in evolution
was not reproduction.
Since the male sex has been in a position of dominance in modern
cultures, it has been erroneously assumed that this male dominance has
always existed from a remote beginning in the animal kingdom many
ages ago; but all the evidence we have is adverse to the theory of male
superiority; for in nearly all animal species, the female is the superior
and dominant type. Even in the human race, before the rise of civiliza
tion, female rule was practically universal. Should we trace the stream
of life back toward its source, we find the female growing in size and
importance, whereas the male decreases in size and power until it van
ishes altogether. Below the vertebrate level, the male sex is relatively
unimportant. Among the bees, the female is the queen, whereas the
male is just a drone; and the mosquito that bites us in the summer is the
female of the species, since the male mosquito dies in early spring as
soon as the mating season is over. Among the Nephila chrysogasier, a
species of spider, the female is thirteen hundred times the size of the
male; and after the marriage ceremony is over, Mrs. Spider devours her
diminutive husband. Among the barnacles, the male is only a parasite
residing in the valves of the female shell; and Mrs. Barnacle carries
around from two to seven of these miniature mates for the purpose of
reproduction. In primitive human society, the women formed the rul
ing class; and even the male dominance of a later age was probably
brought about through sexual selection on the part of the females.



THE FACTORS AND EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION 23
The evidences of evolution may be treated under the following
headings: (1) the evidence from fossils, (2) the evidence from embryol
ogy, (3) the evidence from comparative anatomy, and (4) the evidence
from blood. A fine example of what the fossil record teaches us may be
learned by examining the family tree of the horse. The earliest fossil
horse so far discovered is Eohippus, found in lower Eocene strata of the
western United States. Eohippus had four toes each on the front limbs
and three each on the hind feet. The vestige of another toe (the first
digit or thumb) is visible as a splint on the forefoot, but is completely
missing on the hind foot. The remnant of the fifth digit, however, is
present in the form of a splint on the hind feet of Eohippus. This an
cient relative of the modern horse was only twelve inches high, or
about the size of a modern terrier. It is believed that the hypothetical
five-toed horse, the ancestor of Eohippus and the entire horse family,
first saw the light of day in the Cretaceous period; and that he indubita
bly nad five toes on both fore and hind limbs, and was no larger than
the average rat. Professor Richard Swann Lull, a paleontologist of Yale
University, has traced this evolutionary history through ten distinct
stages in a fine little book entitled Fossils. This work is long out of
print, but for the enlightenment of the reader, a summary of Lull's
findings is given below.
We start with Eohippus, the four-toed horse of the Lower Eocene,
which grew in size and eventually evolved into Orohippus, a mountain
horse of the Middle Eocene, and finally into Kpihippus, of the Upper
Eocene strata. Epihippus stood about fourteen inches high and showed
marked development of the middle digit on both front and back feet. Mesohippus branched off from Epihippus in the Lower Oligocene to
become the first three-toed horse, and reached a height of eighteen
inches. Miohippus, of the Upper Oligocene, grew to a height of
twenty-four inches. In the main line of the evolution of the horse were
three Miocene types. The first was Parahippus, a browsing horse with
short crowned teeth; the second, Merychippus, was forty inches tall, with short crowned milk teeth and long crowned permanent grinders,
the latter being an adaptation to a rough herbage; and the third was
Protohippus, who possessed long crowned milk teeth, and likewise
with the permanent set of teeth. In Pliohippus of the Pliocene, we meet
the first one-toed horse; and in Upper Pliocene strata are fossils of Ple
sippus, an advanced type of the one-toed horse, almost equal in stature
to Equus (the modern horse). The genus Equus emerged in the Pleistocene period, and flourished



24 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
in both the Old and New Worlds. The American horses became ex
rincr during the Great Ice Age, but the Asiatic and African horses con
tinued to develop. The horse is a remarkable animal: He walked on his
toes for ages, the middle toe expanded and the other toes vanished, and
then the nail of the middle toe became the hoof.
The embryological evidence for evolution has been formulated con
cisely in Haeckel's Biogenetic Law, which states: "Ontogeny is a brief
and condensed recapitulation of phytogeny." The gist of said law is
that the individual organism in its embryological development passes
through stages in which it duplicates, in an abbreviated form, the his
tory of the species. The human embryo, for instance, commences as a
single cell, and then passes through fish, amphibian, and reptilian
stages. In the fish stage, the embryo has gills; and then the two-cham
bered heart of the fish phase develops into the three-chambered heart of
the amphibians and reptiles; and finally into the four-chambered heart
of the birds and mammals. We all have tails shortly before birth—a fact
which reminds us of our tree-dwelling ancestors of the distant past.
Occasionally, due to atavism, certain individuals are born with tails,
which later have to amputated. Surgeon-General Ornstein of the
Greek army has reported several cases of tailed men in Greece; and
Dr. Granville Harrison amputated a five-inch tail from a six-month-old
child in the United States. Dr. Harrison reported that the aforesaid tail
contained muscles and rudimentary vertebrae, and was capable of brisk
motion when the child was excited.
The evidence from comparative anatomy may be illustrated by a
comparison of the physical structure of man and the frog. Many people
object to being reminded of their relationship to the great apes, but
their more remote kinship to the frog is not generally discussed. Both
men and frogs have internal skeletons composed of bone. They each
have a spinal cord enclosed in a tube formed by the vertebrae of the
backbone; a brain, and a skull enclosing the same; a mouth, teeth, eyes,
ears, and a nose arranged according to the same general structural pat
tern; and two pairs of limbs, with a skeleton corresponding almost bone
for bone.
It has been said that man's superior brain brought him to a position
of dominance in the animal kingdom; but the difference between the
brain of man and his nearest kin, the anthropoid apes, is one of degree,
and not of kind. In the words of Sir G. Elliot Smith: "No structure
found in the brain of an ape is lacking in the human brain; and, on the



THE FACTORS AND EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION 25
other hand, the human brain reveals no formation of any sort that is not
present in the brain of the gorilla or chimpanzee."
Man corresponds closely with his ape cousins—not only in brain
structure but also in respect to bones, muscles, nerves, blood vessels,
and most other organs. Sir Arthur Keith in his researches in compara
tive anatomy discovered that man has in common with the chimpanzee
98 characters, 87 with the gorilla, 56 with the orang-utan, 84 with the
gibbons, 60 with the New World monkeys, and 53 with the Old World monkeys.
At the base of the human brain is a little organ known as the pineal
body which exercises control over the functioning of the glands of in
ternal secretion. In the words of a distinguished neuro-surgeon: "The
main function of the pineal organ is to retard the action of the hor
mones, or endocrines of the other organs, e.g. pituitrin, thyroxin, insu
lin, oestrin, and the testicular hormone, of the pituitary, thyroid, pan
creas, ovary and testis, respectively. The pineal organ is thus a
super-endocrine organ that checks overactivity on the part of any
member of the endocrine system." (10, p. 107n)
The pineal body is described in Starlings Physiology as "a vestigial
remnant of a primitive dorsal eye." McCabe in discussing the pineal
organ states, "It is clearly the relic of a third eye that once functioned
on the top of the head in a primitive animal. One can often see this
third eye, though now covered with skin, standing out like a large mar
ble on the top of the head of a crocodile. In a very primitive New Zea
land lizard, the tuatara, it plainly shows the structure of an eye, with
retina and optic nerve in a state of decay. From the reptile level we
trace it through the higher animals, sinking deeper and deeper in the
head until it becomes the pineal body." (154, p. 244)
Admiral Beadnell made a study of the tuatara, and in explaining the
evolutionary significance of the pineal body, gave his objections to call
ing it a third eye in the following words: "Remains of this third eye (as
it is wrongly called) are present in lampreys, frogs and lizards, and can
sometimes be seen in the frog on the top of the head between the nor
mal lateral eyes as the so-called Stieda's organ. In the extinct amphibia
and reptiles of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods, this median eye, or
rather pair of eyes, was much better developed. Recent embryological
research has demonstrated that the remaining pineal eye in Sphenodon
[tuatara] is the left eye of the ancestral pair, while that in the lamprey is
the right one. Birds and mammals also possess vestiges of this extra me
dian pair of eyes " (10, pp. 106-7)



26 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Finally we consider the evidence from blood, and the wonderful
story that it tells. If blood cells from one animal are introduced into the bloodstream of another animal, they are destroyed by certain chemicals
known as cytolysins (cell dissolvers). If the two animals concerned are
of the same, or closely related, species, the rate of cell destruction is
slow; but if the mutual kinship is remote, the destruction is rapid. If
human blood cells are injected into the veins of a horse, they are
quickly destroyed. The same human blood cells injected into the blood of a monkey are destroyed at a much slower rare. And when the human blood cells are mingled with those of an anthropoid ape, the reaction is almost the same as mixing the blood cells of two human
beings. There are four principal types of human blood, and the great
apes have the same four types of blood characteristic of the human spe
cies. Drs. C, P. Miller, Jr., and K. Landsteiner of The Rockefeller In
stitute carried out a series of blood tests on men and animals, using two
different experimental methods. The results were published in the
magazine Science, May 8, 1925, and we quote from the two scientists as
follows:
This finding is in agreement with the view of zoologists that the anthropoids are not placed on a line leading from the lower monkeys to man, but
that at a certain stage of evolution there separated one line in the catarrhinae and another leading to the anthropoids and man. The differences between the races of man were imperceptible by our technique in experiments made up to the present by the comparison of white and American Negro bloods. . . . Both methods gave reactions with anthropoid blood in every way identical with those of human blood, while the blood of the other animals behaved differently. These reactions give additional proof of the
close relationship between man and the anthropoids. . . . Very probably
the group specific factors characteristic for human blood, appeared in the phylogeny of the primates prior to the genesis of man.
Scientific experiments have shown that the proportions of calcium, potassium, and sodium ions in blood serum and sea water are almost
identical; but the saline concentration of the sea water is higher, since
the oceans have become saltier since its circulation many ages ago in
the bodies of our sea-dwelling ancestors. Admiral Charles M. Beadnell, an eminent surgeon, has written instructively on the evolution of
blood. The charm and lucidity of his style are exemplified in his sum
mary of the researches of Dr. R. Quinton, a noted physiologist, on the origin of blood and other body fluids:
Independently with Professor Macallum, he conceived the idea that the blood of living animals furnishes a valuable clue to the temperature and



THE FACTORS AND EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION 27
composition of the early pre-Cambrian seas. Our naked ancestors dwelt im
mersed in a saline fluid; each of their cells was, consequently, saturated with
salt water. When, with the advent of a protective and enclosing membrane
or skin, the cells got shut off from direct contact with the sea water, they
retained some of it as their vital fluid; which, circulating, became the blood
and lymph streams. . . . When these aquatic skin-enclosed animals left the
seas and became terrestrial, they carried with them, so to speak, this
modified saline fluid sealed up in their bodies. Hence it is that our body
fluids generally — the blood in the vessels, the lymph in the lymph-spaces,
the tears cleansing the surface of the eye, the lubricating oil of our joints,
the fluid bathing each cell, the amniotic liquids in which the foetus is im
mersed —are, in essence, a dilute sea water. The pre-Cambrian seas are
known to have been less saline than modern seas, and so our body fluids
contain a smaller percentage of total salts than do the seas of today, but are
more or less identical in salinity with those of pre-Cambrian times. With
out the regular and constant presence of this miniature salt sea, not one of
our cells could live a moment. An amoeba or a human blood corpuscle,
placed in pure water, dies immediately. (10, pp. 282-83)



CHAPTER THREE
Ice Ages and Men
IT seems that the earliest forms of life appeared on our planet about
one and a half billion years ago. Apes and men have been traced back
to a common ancestry, the first apes showing up about forty million
years ago. Then around twenty-five million years ago, man became
differentiated from the common ape stem. The first true men made
their presence known in the world only about two million years ago
very brief period of time, speaking geologically.
The popular opinion that Charles Darwin was the inventor of the
doctrine of evolution is false. There were numerous evolutionists be
fore Darwin; but with the publication of The Origin of Species in 1859,
Darwin made the theory of evolution intellectually respectable. After
that date, evolutionism became a part of the lore of modern science,
and hence had to be reckoned with by all thinking men and women.
The bearing of the theory of evolution on human origins was scarcely
mentioned by Darwin in the concluding passage of The Origin of Spe
cies. "Much light," said he, "will be thrown on the origin of man and
his history." (55, p. 373)
In 1871 Darwin's Descent of Man was published, and in this book
impressive evidence was adduced, tending to show that man and the
anthropoid apes could be traced back to a common ancestor. Most of
Darwin's contemporaries judged the continent of Asia to be most likely
the birthplace of humanity, but Darwin held that Africa had a better
claim to the title of the Cradle of Mankind. "We are naturally led to
enquire," he asserted, "where was the birthplace of man. ... In each
great region of the world the living mammals are closely related to the
extinct species of the same region. It is therefore probable that Africa
was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and
28



ICE AGES AND MEN 29
chimpanzee, and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it is
somewhat more probable that our progenitors lived on the African con
tinent than elsewhere. " (55, p. 520)
Even in the early years of the present century, scientists investigat
ing prehistoric eras were inclined to look chiefly to Asia as the original
home of man; but in the year 1921 this position was strikingly chal
lenged by the publication of The Origin and Evolution of the Human
Race by Dr. Albert Churchward. This distinguished medical man held
membership in both the Royal Council of Physicians and the Royal
Council of Surgeons; and besides this he was an anthropologist and ar
chaeologist. The earliest members of the human race appeared in the
interior of the African continent about two million years ago, Church
ward claimed; then from the region of the Great Lakes they spread
over the entire continent. Groups of these early men wandered down
the Nile Valley, settled in Egypt, and then later dispersed themselves
to all parts of the world. The first migration was of the primitive little
men known as pygmies. After them came waves of Nilotic Negroes
who also spread out widely over the face of the globe. As these early
Africans wandered over the world, they differentiated into the various
human subspecies that now inhabit our planet. The men who remained
in the tropical and equatorial regions retained their dark complexions,
whereas those that settled in the temperate zones lost a portion of their
dusky pigmentation and developed a fairer skin. One of Dr. Church
ward's friends, the English scholar, Gerald Massey, had earlier
broached this same theory in a two-volume work, A Book of the Begin
nings (164); but this book was largely ignored by the world of science and scholarship. Even Churchward's arguments were not at first favor
ably considered by his contemporaries, but the tide eventually turned and Dr. Churchward's stand was proven to be fundamentally sound.
Joseph McCabe was a sound popularizer of science and history, and in
1931 he issued The New Science and the Story of Evolution ( 1 54). This
informative book was certainly not directly influenced by the re
searches of Dr. Churchward, yet McCabe's opinions on the early mi
grations of mankind blend harmoniously with those of Churchward.
To cite McCabe directly:
First there was the distribution of the dusky pygmies or Negritoes, who
survive, or did until the nineteenth century, little modified in the Tasmani
ans, pure Veddahs of Ceylon, Andamanese, several jungle tribes of Malaya, and the Bushmen. Next was the distribution which gave the earliest Ne



30 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
groes (or dusky men who would become Negroes) to Africa, the aborigi
nals of Australia, and the Melanesians. From the more temperate part of
that region the ancestors of the Turk and Mongol peoples seem to have
streamed north and northeast, the ancestors of the Malays eastward along
the coast, the ancestors of the Aryans moved northwestward, and their
cousins, the Polynesians, crossed the already crowded eastern region to the
Pacific. (154, pp. 270-71)
Late in 1924, in the town of Taung, Bechuanaland (now called the
Republic of Botswana), a limestone quarry was being operated by the
Northern Lime Company. During blasting operations, the skull of an
ape flew out of the debris and landed at the feet of a visiting geologist,
Professor R. B. Young. The manager of the quarrying operations, a
man named A. E. Spiers, knew that Dr. Raymond Dart, an anatomist
of Johannesburg, would be interested in examining this fossil skull, so
he requested that Young deliver the same to Dart; which was done.
Professor Dart, in studying this fossil, noticed that, though the skull
was that of an ape, the teeth approached the human type closer than
those of any other ape, extant or extinct. Almost immediately he wrote
a paper entitled "The First South African Manlike Ape," which was
published February 7, 1925. The great value of this discovery, Dart de
clared, was that "it exhibits an extinct race of apes intermediate be
tween living anthropoids and man"; and he named the newly found
fossil Australopithecus africanus (southern ape of Africa).
Professor Dart's claims were examined by a committee of four an
thropologists tn London: Sir Arthur Keith, Sir G. Elliot Smith, Sir Ar
thur Smith-Woodward, and Dr. W. L. H. Duckworth. Their verdict
was not favorable to Dart. Keith regarded the Australopithecus as an
ape with some manlike characters. Elliot Smith opined that the fossil
skull was that of an anthropoid ape, but admitted that the Taung ape
had possessed certain human brain features. Smith- Woodward re
garded the fossil as a type of chimpanzee, and held that it had little
bearing on the question of the origin of man. Dr. Duckworth, of Cam
bridge University, was cautious, but seemed to be more favorable to
Dart's claims than the other members of the committee.
But Raymond Dart was not without friends in this scientific camp.
There was a medical doctor from Paisley, Scotland, practicing his pro
fession in Maquassi, a little town on the edge of the Karoo Desert. His
name was Robert Broom, and he had been professor of geology and
zoology at the Victoria College in Stellenbosch. Besides practicing



CE ACES AND MEN 31
medicine, Dr. Broom carried on researches on the evolution of ancienr
mammals and, when he read Dart's paper in 1925, he journeyed to
Johannesburg to take a look at the Australopithecine skull. An examina
tion of the fossil convinced Broom that Dart was right, and he regarded
it as practically the missing link, and one of the most important fossil
discoveries ever made. "As a paleontologist," Broom stated, "1 did not
greatly worry about the size and shape of the brain or the convolutions,
but 1 was convinced that the Taung child was not allied to either the
chimpanzee or the gorilla, and that it was closely allied to man.' 1
(25, p. 25) The Taung ape-man was judged to be about two million years old,
which made him four times as old as the man of Heidelberg and five
times the age of the Java ape-man. But Broom and Dart failed to con
vince the other experts that their claims were valid, so they went out
and sought more evidence. Dr. Broom gave up his medical practice and
took the post of curator of vertebrate paleontology and physical anthro
pology at the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria; and when time permit
ted, he and Dart visited the Karoo Desert to look for fossils. Early in
August, 1936, two of Dart's students (G. W. H. Schepers and H. le
Riche) called Broom and told him that they had found some small ba
boon skulls in caves at Sterkfontein. Dr. Broom visited the caves, lo
cated in a limestone quarry managed by G. W. Barlow. The manager
was requested to look out for fossils, which Broom agreed to purchase.
A few days afterward Barlow found part of a fossil skull, and Broom,
after hours of digging, located most of the rest of it. The doctor found
that he had discovered another ape-man, which he appropriately named
Plesnwthropus transvaalensis (a being from the Transvaal closely allied
to man).
On a visit to the quarry in the forenoon of Wednesday, June 8,
1938, Dr. Broom was greeted by Barlow, who said, "I've something
nice for you this morning," as he handed the doctor the palate of a
large fossil ape-man, containing one molar.
Broom replied, "Yes, it is quite nice. I'll give you a couple of pounds
for it."
"He was delighted," the doctor observed, "so I wrote a check and
put the specimen in my pocket. He did not seem quite willing to say
where or how he had obtained it; and 1 did not press the matter."
On the following Saturday, Broom visited the quarry and, Barlow
being absent, he learned from the workmen on the job that the fossil had not come from their quarry. "On Tuesday forenoon, 1 was again



32 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
at Sterkfontein," to cite Broom further, "when I insisted on Barlow
telling me how he had got the specimen. I pointed out that two teeth
had been freshly broken off, and that they might be lying where the
specimen had been obtained. He apologized for having misled me, and
told me it was a schoolboy, Gert Terblanche, who acted as a guide in
the caves on Sundays, who had picked it up and given it to him." (25,
p. 49) Learning that the schoolboy, aged fifteen, lived at Kromdraai
Farm, about two miles distant, Broom immediately headed for the
farm. Finding that Gert was at school, he then took off for the school
house. tl
It thus happened," as related by Herbert Wendt, "that a fa
mous museum curator suddenly burst into a Boer village school and an
nounced that he must speak to one of the pupils at once. The teacher,
tremendously impressed and yet clever enough to take advantage of the
occasion, said he would gladly release the boy if South Africa's great
fossil hunter would be good enough to say a few words about his re
searches on prehistoric man." (268, p. 478)
After Broom's lecture was over, and school let out, the doctor was
able to ask the student a few questions. Broom whipped the fossil bone
out of his coat pocket and pointed it at young Terblanche, and then ex
citedly asked, "Where did you get this from? Come on, tell me! Take
me immediately to the place where you found it."
Then Gert, in the words of Broom, "drew from his trouser pocket
four of the most beautiful teeth ever found in the world's history. Two
of the four fitted on the palate Barlow had given to me. The other two
had been weathered off." Broom, of course, gladly purchased the teeth from the young man. Less than an hour later, Broom was shown the site at Kromdraii, where the fossil palate had been found. Gert Ter
blanche pointed to a wall of rock and said to Dr. Broom, "That's the
place. The best thing to do would be to pour gunpowder into the hole and blow the whole show up. We always do that when we need stones
for building."
This last remark shocked the doctor, who retorted, "For heaven's
sake! You'd better help me instead to chisel the bones out. Sure you
haven't got anything more in your pockets?"
Then the boy confessed, "Yes, I've got one more tooth. Can I keep
just that one?"
When Broom saw the tooth, he groaned and said, "Well, it would be a premolar!" Then he turned to his youthful companion and said,
"Look here, I'll give you five slabs of chocolate for it." The doctor got
his fossil tooth; for what schoolboy could turn down an offer of five



ICE AGES AND MEN 33
slabs of chocolate? Dr. Broom found his meering with Gcrr Terblanche
highly rewarding, since the pupil had hidden another fossil find which
he turned over to the doctor. This one was a jaw containing some
teeth, and in a fine state of preservation; and after a search for the rest
of the fossil, Broom finally assembled most of the left side of the skull
and the right lower jaw, with many teeth in good condition. This dis
covery turned out to be a new genus of the Australopithecines, with a
bigger brain and jaw than any hitherto found, and with teeth more
hominid. The new genus was labeled Paranthwpus robustus (robust
near-man) and, since the fossil was unearthed at Kromdraai Farm, it is sometimes called the Kromdraai Man.
The field work of Dr. Broom was halted during the second world
war, and was not resumed until 1947. In April, 1948, another fossil was
unearthed—the skull of an adult female Plesianthropus, which was nick
named "Mrs. Pies"; and then another species of ape-man was dug up in
October at Swartkrans. This was an outsized lower jawbone of an Aus
tralopithecine with large teeth, so Broom called it Paranthwpus crassidens
(coarse-toothed near-man). A fifth species, Australopithecus prome
theus, was discovered by Dart in 1949, at Makapansgat. Broom passed
away at the age of eighty-four in 1951, but his work was continued by
his assistant, Dr. John T. Robinson. Over a period of years, Robinson
found fossils of another species, Telanthwpus capencis, a more advanced
type than any of the Australopithecines and hence more hominid. The
five Australopithecines so far mentioned are all members of one genus,
consisting of two species. The four earlier types belong to the species
Africanus, and the later to the species robustus. A French paleontolo
gist, Yves Coppen, uncovered a fossil in June, 1961, in the Republic of
Chad, which turned out to be a sixth Australopithecine, and is believed
to be older than its South African relatives. This ape-man has been
named Tchadanthropus JJxoris. These South African ape-men were
closer to man than the anthropoid apes, but they are not considered di
rect ancestors of Homo sapiens. The search for the earliest members of
the human race leads us to the Olduvai Gorge, in the Republic of Tan
zania, Hast Africa.
In 1911, a German entomologist named Kattwinkel was traveling
through German East Africa in search of rare insect specimens. By chance he wandered into the Olduvai Gorge and observed some fossil bones embedded in the wall of a steep cliff. The bones were excavated
and taken to Berlin, where interested paleontologists recognized them
as remains of Hipparion, an ancient three-toed horse. This intelligence



34 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
arrested rhe arrenrion of Hans Reck, a geologist of the University of Berlin, and convinced him that Olduvai ought to be a good place to
prospect for fossils. So, organizing an expedition, Dr. Reck in 1913
journeyed to the gorge, and his subsequent discoveries were downright
spectacular. Fossils of extinct species of animals were found numbering
in the hundreds, and several of them were unknown to science. One of
Reek's finds was a skeleton of Homo sapiens which he believed to be
one million years old, but later investigations showed this to be an
error, and the correct age was established as twenty thousand years. At
the outbreak of the first world war in 1914, Reek's party had to sus
pend operations, and explorations were not resumed for seventeen
years.
In the organization of a new expedition to search for Stone Age arti
facts at the Olduvai site in 193 1, the moving spirit was a paleontologist
born in Africa—a young man named Louis Leakey. His parents were
English missionaries, working among the Kikiyu of Kenya, and there
Louis was born in a thatched hut. He grew up among the Kikiyu,
played with their children, and spoke their language. At age sixteen he
left for England to study anthropology and archaeology. Five years
later, in 1924, he returned to Kenya, and engaged in the exploration of
Stone Age sites until 1929. In that year, he visited Berlin and asked
Professor Reck to join him for further work at Olduvai. Since Leakey
occupied the post of curator of the Coryndon Museum in Nairobi,
Kenya, he had been compelled to limit his work at the gorge to a
seven-week period each year, and prospecting in a chasm three hun
dred feet in depth and twenty-five miles in length has kept him busy
over the years. It has been his good fortune that Mrs. Mary Leakey, his
wife, is also a paleontologist, and that she has ably assisted him in his
work, besides making some important discoveries of her own.
In the Olduvai Gorge there are five strata of rocks; and in the lowest
layer many stone tools of a pre-Chellean (Abbevillian) design have
been found. The stratum immediately above contains fossils and arti
facts of a Chellean type; and here Leakey and his associates found
twelve distinct stages of a hand-axe culture. In the search for fossil
men, Olduvai for many years was not encouraging. Leakey had better
luck at Kanam and Kanjera, where in 1932 he found fossil skulls of
Homo sapiens of uncertain age. In 1948, Mrs. Leakey unearthed a fossil
ape, on Rusinga Island, in Lake Victoria. This extinct primate lived
about twenty-five million years ago in the Miocene epoch. He was
given the name Proconsul Africanus and seems to have been a close rela



ICE AGES AND MEN 35
rive to a remote ancestor of Homo sapiens. "He cannot be considered a
direct ancestor of man," asserts Mr. Simak, "but he probably was not
far from man's line of descent. Somewhere during this time must have
lived another animal, a cousin of Proconsul, which was man's remote
ancestor." (232, pp. 278-79)
The first big discovery at Olduvai did not occur until July 17, 1959; and this was another triumph of Mrs. Leakey. While Professor Leakey
was inactivated by a spell of illness, his wife located a skull embedded
in rocks eighty-three feet from the bottom of the gorge. The fossil was
fragmented, and after nineteen days of labor was excavated and recon
structed. The skull was hominid in type, somewhat flat on top, and
crowned with a bony crest, very much like that of a gorilla, and with a
cranial capacity of about 650 cubic centimeters. This ancient man was
named Zinjanthropus boisei by Leakey. The Zinj part of the name is
from the Arabic name for east Africa, and the boisei refers to the last
name of Charles Boise, one of the financial sponsors of the Olduvai ex
plorations. Professor Ashley Montagu regards this Olduvai man as the
most primitive, though not the oldest, known form of man.
The next great discovery at Olduvai, in 1960, was again made by
Mrs. Leakey who, after noticing a tooth embedded in the side of the
gorge, dug into the earth and uncovered several parts of a skeleton.
Over the following three years six additional specimens were exhumed.
The new find was labeled Homo habilis (man with ability). This an
cient man possessed an erect carriage, his height was about four and a
half feet, he had a cranial capacity of about 700 cc, and his dentition was of a primitive human type. His hands were equipped with opposable thumbs, which endowed him with a toolmaking capability; and his
feet were definitely modern in structure. He flourished between one
and two million years ago. Professor Leakey regards him as a direct an
cestor of Homo sapiens. In an orange grove owned by Fred Wicker at Fort Ternan, Kenya, Leakey found the fossil of an ape which he named Kenyapithecus wickeri (Wicker's Kenya ape). This primate lived about twelve million
years ago, and he certainly had few friends among his neighbors. An
Associated Press release, dated Washington, DC, May 15, 1968, was
published in the New York Times, May 16, 1968, with the caption: SCIENTIST KINDS HAMMER I 2 MILLION YEARS OLD, from which We quote
the following:
A National Geographic Society scientist has unearthed evidence that a
bone smashing African ancestor of man used a crude stone hammer 12 mil



36 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
lion years ago. This would be 10 million years earlier than previous esti
mates of the beginning of toolmaking on earth. The society said today that
the evidence was found by Dr. Louis S. B. Leakey, British anthropologist,
who has made a number of notable findings concerning prehistoric man. The announcement said that Dr. Leakey, working at Fort Ternan in
Kenya, had found evidence that the prehuman Kenyapithecus zuickeri appar
ently hammered open animal skulls and bones with a crude stone hammer.
The above intelligence must certainly have arrested the attention of
the anthropological fraternity, for it was regarded as axiomatic until
quite recently that a toolmaking ape must be considered to be a man.
According to the English anthropologist, F. A. Brooke: "The differen
tiation between what constitutes man and ape must be considered as
having taken place at that point when an ape was able with his own
hands to shape wood and stone in a very crude way, so that he could
make them serve for a special purpose. Thus it may be said that the first
man was the first ape that made a tool." (24, p. 1 1)
The above viewpoint, as expressed by Brooke, is not considered en
tirely correct by the most recent authorities. The best modern state
ment of the matter has been expressed by Clifford I). Simak as follows:
"Man is not the only tool-using animal, nor the only tool-making ani
mal. Chimpanzees in captivity, have fashioned tools—fastening two
sticks together to knock down a bunch of fruit placed out of their
reach. But man was the first and only animal to make and carry a tool
against a future need. Here we see that the distinction is not so much in
the ability to make or use a tool as it is in the intelligence which can see
the future need of one." (232, p. 282)
The African genesis of the human race is now generally accepted in
the realm of modern science as a fact beyond all dispute. "It is quite
probable," declares Professor Montagu, "that man's immediate ances
tors as a group had already lost a considerable part of the hairy coat
which is characteristic of all anthropoids, indeed, of all primates. What
the skin color was we cannot be sure, but since the ancestors of man
were almost certainly tropical animals of African origin, they were al
most equally certainly black-skinned." (173, p. 42)
Or. Eric Higgs of Cambridge University has made a study of the
migrations of ancient men, and he claims that the first men of Europe
came to that continent from central and eastern Africa about 250,000
years ago. Professor Chester Chard, of the University of Wisconsin,
has studied the routes of early men who left Africa to colonize the rest



ICE AGES AND MEN 37
of the world; and he has concluded that there were four prehistoric mi
gration routes from Africa to Europe. Professor Leakey was asked if he
thought that any of the early African migrants reached the New
World, and he answered thusly: "It is inconceivable that man, the most
curious and mobile of all animals, would not have come to America,
when the elephants, the tapirs and deer came from Asia. . . . Man
spread out from Africa to Asia to Europe. It is inconceivable that he
would stay out of America. ... At least people should go look for re
mains of man before they say he wasn't in America." (204)
Up to this point we have been discussing mainly the ape-men and
prehistoric men of Africa, but to get a balanced picture of the story of
evolution we must say something about some of the ape-men and pro
tomen of Asia and Europe. Remains of ancient types of ape-men were
discovered by Professor G. H. R. von Koenigswald, in Lower Pleisto
cene strata of the Sangiran district in central Java in 1941. The fossil
fragments unearthed consisted of parts of two lower jaws. This ancient
Javanese ape-man has been called Meganthropus paleojavanicus. In 1952
a more complete jaw of this early manlike type was found at Sangiran
by Dr. Pieter Marks. These jaws have been described as unusually
massive, of about the same proportions as the jaws of adult male goril
las. Weidenrich and Von Koenigswald held that Meganthropus was
seven feet six inches in height; and they concluded that early man
passed through a stage of gigantism, which gradually subsided into men
of normal stature. The opinion has been expressed by Von Koenigs
wald that Meganthropus was an ancestor of Pithecanthropus erectus, the
famous Java ape-man. In 1886 the young Dr. Eugene Dubois was lecturer in anatomy at
the University of Amsterdam, but this position brought .him no joy, for
he was interested in the study of the origin of man. The young physi
cian had already concluded that the earliest men dwelt either in Africa,
the habitat of the gorilla and chimpanzee, or Asia, which is the home of
the orang-utan. Since Java and Sumatra had not been covered by gla
ciers during the Great Ice Age, Dubois thought these areas would
prove rewarding in a search for the remains of early ancestors of mod
ern man. He secured an appointment as a surgeon in the Royal Dutch
Army, sailing for Padang, Sumatra, in November, 1887, with high
hopes of finding fossils of the earliest types of men. Exploration of caves
in Sumatra was disappointing, and Dubois persuaded the government
to transfer him to Java so he could search for fossil vertebrate fauna.



38 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
During the years 1890 through 1897, the young scientist found the
missing link which he had so long sought, for at Trinil, Java, he found
the top of a skull, a fragment of a lower jaw, three teeth, and a thigh
bone. The skull-cap was apelike, whereas the thigh bone was decidedly
manlike. This combination suggested an ape-man who had walked
erectly; hence this missing link was called Pithecanthropus erectus (the
ape-man who walked erect). A more recent classification gives this old
ape-man the name Homo erectus erectus. (For details on the ancestry of
man, and the classification of early types of man and his forerunners,
the interested reader is referred to Man: His First Two Million Years
by Professor Ashley Montagu [173, 174].) The brain capacity of the
Java ape-man (Homo erectus erectus) ranged from 775 to 940 cc, a vol
ume which approaches that of Homo sapiens (modern man).
In 1937, in mid-Pleistocene strata, at Sangiran, Java, Von Koenigs
wald excavated several other specimens of Homo erectus erectus; and
later on, in 1939, the same scientist discovered a more robust type of
the same ape-man, which was appropriately labeled Homo erectus ro
bustus. This fossil find consisted of the base of the skull and the upper
jaw with teeth in their sockets. The evolutionary significance of Homo
erectus robustus is admirably explained by Professor Montagu:
The teeth are essentially human in form, except that the canines project
beyond the level of the other teeth, and there is a bony space between the
canine and the lateral incisor for the reception of the tip of the lower ca
nine, just as in the apes. In Homo erectus erectus, this space has disap
peared. The evidence, therefore, points to this evolutionary order of
changes in the jaw region, namely that the first canine tooth underwent re
duction, as we can see in Homo erectus robustus, and this was followed
after a time by disappearance of the premaxillary diastema, as the space be
tween the canine tooth and the lateral incisor is called. In this way the pro
jection of the upper jaw was reduced to the more or less straight form
characteristic of modern man. (174, p. 56)
Professor von Koenigswald prospecting for fossils in the vicinity of
Ngandong, Java, near the Solo River, in 193 1, came across eleven fossil
skulls. A study of the fossils showed resemblances to the famous Java
ape-man and the Neanderthal man of later times. The average brain
capacity was 1 100 cc. At Wadjak, also in Java, two human skulls were
found in 1889 and 1890 by Van Rietschoten, and then sold to Dr. Eu
gene Dubois. Dubois claimed that the skulls were relics of the Pleisto
cene age, and the cranial volume of one was 1550 cc. and of the other



ICE AGES AND MEN 39
was 1650 cc, and the skulls are undoubtedly of sapiens type. Some stu
dents of prehistory have suggested that there seems to be a straight line
of evolution, leading from Java man through Solo man to Wadjak man,
and thence to the Australian aborigines.
Professor Davidson Black, a Canadian anatomist, on the faculty of
Peiping Union Medical College, found a fossil tooth at Choukoutien,
near Peiping, in 1927. By 1939 remains of more than forty individuals
had been exhumed. New excavations, beginning in 1943, have pro
duced additional relics. These remains found in Middle Pleistocene
strata are now known as the Pekin Man. The scientific name is Sinan
thropus pekinensis (Chinese Man from Peking). This ape-man is also
known as Homo erectus pekinensis and is believed to be a more advanced
type of Homo erectus erectus, better known as the ape-man of Java.
"The resemblances between Java and Peking man are striking," Pro
fessor Montagu notes, "and all in all it seems justifiable to conclude that
the latter represents a slightly more advanced geographic variety of the
former, and is to be included among the Pithecanthropines." (174, p.
60)
In China, fossil bones, when found, are customarily sold to pharma
cists, and these so-called dragon bones are concocted in medicines that
are supposed to cure all kinds of diseases. The Dutch geologist, Von
Koenigswald, paid a visit to a Chinese apothecary and discovered three
giant manlike molars. Two were lower third-year molars, both right
and left, derived from different individuals. There was also an upper
molar, probably from another individual. The volume of the crown of
the lower third molar was found to be six times the size of the same
tooth in man, and almost twice the size of the equivalent tooth of the
gorilla. Von Koenigswald assumed that he had discovered an ancient
giant of a man, and called the new species Gigantopithecus blacki. (The
blacki part of this name refers to Dr. Davidson Black, who was thus
honored by having an ancient fossil named after him.)
Later discoveries discredited Von Koenigswald's theory that he had
discovered an ancient man of gigantic stature. In a Middle Pleistocene
site in Kwangsi province in China, in 1957, a Gigantopithecus mandible
was excavated, with teeth intact. Examinations by experts have shown
that Gigantopithecus was an advanced type of ape, but not an ape-man,
and was not in the ancestry of man. These ancient apes were certainly
robust, but they were not giants, and there is not reason to think, as
some experts suggested, that they were related to the Australopithe



40 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
cines. But Von Koenigswald still believes that Gigantopithecus blacki has
a closer kinship to man than any other known ape, extant or extinct.
In the year 1907, in a quarry at Mauer, near Heidelberg, Germany,
a workman uncovered a large lower jaw of a primitive species of man
with all the teeth in situ. The fossil was found in lower Middle Pleisto
cene strata, and is thought to be about 500,000 years old. This Mauer
or Heidelberg man may have been a precursor of the Neanderthals and
a relative of Solo man. Much is known about the Neanderthal man, since we now have the
relics of more than one hundred individuals. The Neanderthaloids
flourished from 1 50,000 to 40,000 years ago, and they evidently had
more brains than modern men: The average brain capacity of the Ne
anderthals was 1,550 cc, while the average for modern man is only
1,350 cc. Neanderthal man possessed well-developed brow ridges, a
heavy jaw, minus a chin, a sloping forehead, and a projecting occiput
(the back of the head). Some reconstructions show Mr. Neanderthal
with a bull neck, stoop-shoulders, knock-knees, and features of a gro
tesque nature. It has been said that he was of low intelligence because
of his low forehead. But we have it from a high authority that:
All these statements are quite indefensible. Neanderthal man walked as
erect as any modern man, he did not have a bull neck, and he was not knock-kneed, and it has long ago been proven by many independent scien
tific investigators that neither the form of the brow nor the shape of the head have anything whatever to do with intelligence. . . . There is, in fact,
every reasofi to believe that Neanderthal man was every bit as intelligent as contemporary man. . . . For a long time it was believed that Neanderthal man was exterminated by men of our own type. There was absolutely no
evidence for this belief except the kind of theorizing that characterized
nineteenth-century thinkers of The Survival of the Fittest school, who be
lieved that warfare was old as man, and was the means by which one race conquered and exterminated another. Since Neanderthal remains are known for almost every part of the earth where human fossils have been found, it is inconceivable that Neanderthal man should everywhere have been exterminated. It is doubtful whether he was exterminated anywhere. The truth seems to be that he mixed with whatever populations he encountered and in the course of time was absorbed by such populations. Certainly
this was the case in the Middle East and in Europe, where many persons
may still be seen who bear the traces of their remote Neanderthal ancestry.
These traces may be observed in the rather heavy brow ridges, deepsunken eye sockets, receding foreheads, and weakly-developed chin re
gions. (174, pp. 67-69)

A prehistoric type of fossil man was discovered at Les Eyzies,
France, in the Cro-Magnon rock shelter; and hence was named the Cro-Magnon man. This find was made in 1898. Then from 1872 to
1902 remains of thirteen individuals of the same species were located in
the caves of Cote d'Azur, near Mentone, Italy. These Cro-Magnons
have been called the Apollos of the prehistoric world. They averaged
five feet eleven in height, had a cranial capacity of 1,660 cc, a straight
face, a well-developed nose, a high forehead, and strong jaws. The
Cro-Magnon was definitely a modern type of man, but of his early his
tory nothing certain is known.
We have discussed the remains of ape-men and prehistoric men who
lived in Africa, Asia, and Europe in times remote from the present.
Though African types are now regarded as the most ancient, there is
no consensus of opinion as to how the ancient forms blended together
to produce modern man. For instance, at Garusi, on the shores of Lake
Eyassi in East Africa, Kohl-Larsen in 1939 found fragments of a max
illa (upper vertebrate jaw) in an upper Paleolithic deposit. This fossil
was given the name Meganthropus Africamts, and it was announced in
1943 by its discoverers to be an Australopithecine; but two other ex
perts, A. Remane and H. Weinert, in 1950-5 1, examined the fossil and
concluded that it was a pithecanthropine and probably related to the
Meganthropus of Java. John T. Robinson, in 1953, stated his dissent
from that hypothesis by declaring Meganthropus Africanus to be closely
related to Plesianthropus transvaalensis, an African Australopithecine
originally discovered by Robert Broom at Sterkfontein in 1936.
In June, 1954, at Ternifine, Algeria, Professor C. Arambourg, of
Paris, found two lower human jaws in Middle Pleistocene strata. He
estimated their age to be about 500,000 years. This fossil type has been
named Atlanthropus Mauritanicus, and is thought to be closely related
to the pithecanthropines. A fragment of a hominid lower jaw was also
found in 1954 in a Middle Pleistocene site at Sidi Abderrahman, near
Casablanca, Morocco; and seemingly of the same type as Mauritanicus
of Algeria. These discoveries establish the presence of pithecanthropine
types in Africa.
A laborer, digging for mineral ores at Broken Hill, Northern Rho
desia (now Zambia), in 1921, discovered a Neanderthaloid type of
skull. Further discoveries were made at Broken Hill by A. S.
Armstrong (in 1921), and A. Hrdlicka (in 1925). This Rhodesian man
was given the official name of Homo rhodesiensis. This ancient man was



42 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
dolichocephalic (long-headed), with a cranial capacity of about 1,400
cc. Another skull of this type of man was found at Saldanha Bay, South
Africa, 1,500 miles from Broken Hill, and shows that Rhodesian man
ranged widely over the African terrain. Besides Neanderthaloid traits,
this early hominid displayed resemblances to Solo man and modern
Homo sapiens, 'in Rhodesian man, then," to cite Professor Montagu,
"we have perhaps a link between Solo man of Java, Neanderthal man
of many parts of the world, and the modern, or neanthropic, type of
man, as he is sometimes called." (174, p. 65)
The paleontologists and physical anthropologists have broadly clas
sified mankind into two groups: (1) paleanthropic, or ancient men; and
(2) neanthropic, or modern men. We have discussed briefly the an
cient human types, and now something must be said about neanthropic or modern man.
The principal representatives of modern fossil men are Swanscombe
man of England, Fontechevade man of France, and the men of Kanam
and Kanjera, in Kenya, East Africa. (There are many other examples
of neanthropic fossil men, which cannot be discussed here, due to limi
tations of space; but the interested reader might profitably read the
chapter on Homo sapiens in Man and His Ancestry by Alan Houghton
Brodrick [22].) In a quarry at Swanscombe, England, in 1935 and
1936, two bones of a single skull, the left parietal and complete occipi
tal bone, were dug out of a Middle Pleistocene deposit. (The parietal
bones are the pair of bones forming the top and sides of the skull. The
occipital bone is the bone at the back of the skull.) In 1955 the right pa
rietal bone of the same skull was found; and Swanscombe man was esti
mated to have had a cranial capacity of 1,325 cc. These bones are
thicker than those of more recent men, the parietals being flatter and
the occipital broader. Swanscombe man may be considered a link be
tween paleanthropic and neanthropic man, and is believed to have lived
about 200,000 years ago.
In 1947 in a cave not far from Montbrun, in western France, Miss
Germaine Henri-Martin discovered parts of two skulls. These fossils
were the remains of a pre-Neanderthal type of man. Having been found in Fontechevade cave, it was called the Fontechevade man. The
face was distinctly of a modern hominid type, and this early man could
boast of a cranial capacity of about 1,470 cc, and he lived over 100,000
years B.P. (before the present). It is believed that the Fontechevade
people later intermixed with the Neanderthals.

Reference has already been made ro the discoveries of Leakey of the Kanam and Kanjera men. The first discovery was made ar West Kanam, on the south shore of Kavironda Gulf, in Kenya. It was a parr
of a hominid mandible (lower jawbone), for which the discoverer
claimed a Lower Pleistocene date. 1 he general appearance of Kanam
man was distinctly that of the species sapiens. The next find was at
Kanjers, only a few miles from West Kanam. From the fragments of
four skulls found by Leakey, Brodrick gives us an idea of what the
Kanjera man looked like:
The bones are thick (for a Homo sapiens), the supra-orbital ridge is
slightly developed, the skull was very markedly dolichocephalic. In fact,
from the remains as they exist, it is fairly clear that Kanjera man was Homo
sapiens. A fragment of femur indicates that Kanjera man walked as we do
and was probably a pretty muscular fellow. The fauna and the artifacts at
the Kanjera hominid level are such as to suggest a later dating than that of
the Kanam deposit. . . . We may hope to discover other evidence sup
porting the theory that Homo sapiens existed in Africa long, long ago when
on that continent (as well as elsewhere) other types of hominid (e.g., nean
derthaloid and pithecanthropoid) were still surviving. (22, p. 207)
We have tried to keep the story of the evolution of man as simple as
possible. This is not easy, for even the experts seriously disagree among
themselves as to the how, why, and wherefore of the origin and devel
opment of the human race. "At one time," a leading authority points
out, "things used to be quite simple when anthropologists discussed the
origin and evolution of man. Modern man was the last and highest type
of man to be evolved. The most primitive type of man was held to be
Homo erectus (Pithecanthropus) erectus or possibly Homo erectus (Pithe
canthropus) rohustus. All the types of men in between the pithecanthro
pines and modern man were held to be simply intermediate stages in
the evolution of man from the most primitive to the most advanced
type. However, certain recent finds of fossil men render this earlier
and apparently perfectly logical interpretation of the evolution of man
seriously open to question." (174, p. 76) It is one of the merits of Pro
fessor Montagu that he has clearly grasped the network pattern of evo
lution, especially i.n relation to the early development of neanthropic
man. "If Swanscombe, Fontechevade, Kanam and Kanjera man are representatives of the modern like type of man," Montagu observes,
"the conclusion is unavoidable that a type of man resembling modern man is much more ancient than was previously supposed. It is quite



44 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
possible that Neanderthal man, for example, represents the product of
admixture between such types as Solo with neanthropic man, rather
than being a descendant of Homo erectus or Solo man in the direct
line. . . . Evolution is best likened not to a straight line, but rather to a
reticulum or network, in which all sorts of crisscrossing lines (groups)
pass in every direction, with interconnections established between the
different cords of the network." (174, pp. 84-86)
Should the reader be told that ancient Egyptian kings of the Middle
Empire made a signal contribution to modern prehistoric science, he
would probably find the statement hard to believe. Yet it is, neverthe
less, a fact. Andre Senet, a French scientific writer, has produced a val
uable and instructive work, Alan in Search of His Ancestors. The best
part of this book is Chapter IV: ''From African Apes to Modern Na
tions." At the very beginning of this chapter we are informed that:
The pharaohs of the Xllth Dynasty (Middle Empire), especially Sesos
tris II, were zealous reformers and very wise rulers, and were anxious to as
sure their lands a healthy economic prosperity. So they conceived the idea
of methodically exploiting an old prehistoric habitat watered by an arm of
the Nile. In the process, aided by a skilful system of canals and locks, they
created an artificial oasis southeast of Cairo, which became one of the most
fertile regions of Egypt and has remained so for 4,000 years. Simultane
ously they made it possible for the paleontologists of the Twentieth century
to discover the first apes to inhabit our planet. (223, p. 98)
The artificial oasis referred to by Senet is today called Lake Karoun,
but the ancient Egyptians knew it as Lake Moeris. Again to cite Senet:
The farmers who settled at the artificial oasis of Fayum soon became nu
merous. Sesostris II himself lived there in an immense palace in the town of
Shedet, consecrated to the crocodile-god Sebek, whence the name Croco
dilopolis given it by the Greek historian Herodotus. The oasis has been
continuously inhabited ever since, and has not failed to attract the attention
of paleontologists, prehistorians and archaeologists, who have made there
some very interesting discoveries. ... It is enough for the moment to note
that in this part of Africa 3 5 to 45 million years ago, there lived the first of
all the known apes, discovered by an Austrian, Max Schlosser, in 1910.
(223, p. 98)
This primitive ape, parapithecus, is represented only by a fossilized
lower jaw, but from the size of the jaw and the tooth structure much of
value has been learned; for parapithecus possessed a hominid dental pat
tern: two incisors, one canine, two pre-molars, and three molars. By



ICE AGES AND MEN 45
studying a jaw that can be held in the palm of the hand, paleontologists have learned about an anthropoid species from which the human family
branched off millions of years ago. The same jMax Schlosser discovered at Fayum the fossil jaw of a larger and more advanced type of ape, pro
pliopithecus, believed to be a descendant of parapithecus. In recent
years Leakey and Hopwood have collected fossils of nearly three hun
dred apes that lived in Kenya around twenty-five million years ago,
ranging in size from that of a small gibbon to that of a large gorilla. Of
these ancient Kenya apes, Limnopithecus shows the closest relation to
mankind, since his molars were quite similar to human molars.
As a result of these discoveries [Sener argues] the genealogical tree of the
earliest apes takes a fairly clear shape. It was in Egypt first of all in the Fayum region, that parapithecus and propliopithecus appeared. From the latter descended in more or less direct line the Kenya Limnopithecus, the European Pliopithecus (France, Switzerland, Bavaria, Slovakia, etc.) and the East African proconsul. All these apes are remarkable for the shape of
their teeth, which are not specialized, and especially for their canines which are always of medium size as in men, and never form fangs overlapping the other teeth as in the large apes of today. Furthermore judging by the shape of their thigh and ankle-bones, these apes seem to have walked on their hind feet and to have used their arms little as a means of locomotion. . . .
So it was at this stage of evolution, let us say about 25 million years ago, that two branches seem to have definitely diverged from the stem of African apes, one leading in the direction of man and the other of modern apes, known as anthropoids, represented by the gibbons, chimpanzees, gorillas
and orang-utans. (223, p. 101)
Among modern experts who have studied the origin and evolution of
the human race are Hrdlicka, Boule, Vallois, Arambourg, Teilhard de Chardin, and Le Gros Clark. The views of these prehistorians may be grouped into four hypotheses, which are outlined by Senet as follows:
The first hypothesis, which is only mentioned here as a reminder, is Hrdlicka's; he makes the four principal stages in the evolution of humanity
descend directly from one another. . . . The second hypothesis makes the Mauer (Heidelberg) man descend almost directly from the Australopithecus, and from him modern man descends through the Swanscombe-Fontechevade line. . . . In the third hypothesis the Mauer man is still at the origin of modern, but this time by way of the progressive Neanderthal men (the oldest). On their side, and still more or less deriving from Australopithecus, came first of all the pre-men, who gave rise to the typical Neanderthalians. The Swanscombe-Fontechevade line evolved independently, though no one knows its
origin or end.



46 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
The fourth hypothesis admits purely and simply that at least four at
tempts have been made in the human direction: Australopithecus, pre-man,
the Neanderthal man, and finally modern man, the last having alone suc
ceeded. In this hypothesis it could equally well have been in the Swanscombe-Fontechevade line that modern man had his origin. (223, pp. 121
23)
Ice ages have played an important role in the history of evolution,
and something must be said about them. Geological time is divided into
six eras; these are listed below, with estimates of time duration for each
era in years B.P. (before present):
1. Eozoic 1,750 million years B.P.
2. Archeozoic 500 million years B.P.
3. Proterozoic 500 million years B.P.
4. Paleozoic 550 million years B.P.
5. Mesozoic 200 million years B.P.
6. Cenozoic 60 million years B.P.
There is a close connection between ice ages and geological eras.
There have been five ice ages in the history of the world, and each of
these ice ages came at the close of a geological era. The first ice age
ended the Archeozoic, the second great chill was at the end of Protero
zoic, the third at the termination of the Paleozoic, the fourth at the con
clusion of the Mesozoic, and the fifth or Great Ice Age brought the
Cenozoic era to its close. The first and second ice ages occurred before
the development of land life, so we can only speculate concerning their
effects on the marine life of those remote days. The third ice age, at the
end of the Paleozoic, brought on the downfall of the amphibian and the
dominance of the reptile. The fourth ice age, at the end of the Meso
zoic, initiated the decline of the reptile and the rise of the mammal.
And the fifth, or Great Ice Age, raised man to a position of dominance
in the animal kingdom. The late Joseph McCabe, who was a keen stu
dent of the history of ice ages, called the Pleistocene glaciation "the ice age that made man."
Everything we know [McCabe tells us] tends to show that social life
began round the fires which man learned to make when the cold set in, and
under the rock shelters where some protection was afforded from the biting winds. That was the real making of man. There is no reason whatever to
suppose that the pace of human progress would have increased as it did if
there had been no Ice Age. (151, pp. 120-21)

millions of years in rhe furure, and man will long ere that time have
gone the way of the dinosaur and the mammoth.
Consider the mammoth—his rise and his fall! When the Great Ice
Age set in, certain elephants, rather than freeze, grew shaggy coats of
hair and evolved into mammoths. The cave man was a neighbor of the
mammoth, and he did not grow a shaggy coat; but he learned to build
fires, to make coats out of the skins of animals, and to dwell in caves.
Both mammoth and man survived the last ice age; but soon after the re
treat of the ice the mammoth went the way of all flesh; whereas man
continued to increase and multiply. The poor old mammoth perished
from overspecialization; since in a temperate clime he had no need of
his shaggy coat, but he nevertheless was stuck with it. In times past he
had roamed over icy tundras and dined on dwarf willows and mosses,
and now his habitat was covered by forests. With hooves and trunks
developed for rooting in the snow, and a digestive system adapted to
the Arctic scrub, the mammoth found himself in surroundings to which
he was entirely unsuited; so he just hauled off and died. Man was far
more flexible; for when the climare gor warmer, he rook off his coar
and pur our his fire. The cave man invenred weapons, slew mammorhs, and dined on mammorh sreaks; and when rhere were no longer any mammorhs the cave man would find ir no hardship ro swirch over ro

cal prowess of rhe riger.
In rhe comparatively short evolutionary history documented by fossil remains [we are told by Professor Childe] man has nor improved his inherited



48 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
equipment by bodily changes detected in his skeleton yet he has been able
to adjust himself to a greater range of environments than almost any other
creature, to multiply infinitely faster than any near relative among the
higher mammals, and to beat the polar bear, the hare, the hawk, and the
tiger at their special tricks. Through his control of fire and the skill to make
clothes and houses, man can, and does, live and thrive from the arctic circle
to the equator. In the trains and cars he builds man can outstrip the fleetest
hare and ostrich. In airplanes he can mount higher than the eagle, and with
telescopes see farther than the hawk. With firearms he can lay low animals
that a tiger dare not tackle. . . . Man's compensation for his relatively poor
bodily endowment has been the possession of a large and complex brain,
forming the center of an extensive and delicate nervous system. These per
mit a great variety of accurately controlled movements, being adjusted ex
actly to the impulses received by keen organs of sense. It is only so that
man has been enabled to make himself protections against climate and
weather, arms and weapons of attack and defense that, because they can be
adapted and adjusted, are really superior to furs, or teeth, or claws. (46, pp. 27-28)
If man survived because he had a better brain than any of his com
petitors, how did he get this superior mental equipment? This brings
up the question of the evolution of the mind; and we use the word mind
here in the strictly scientific sense. "The mind," says Professor J. P.
Guilford, "if it has any scientific meaning at all, is the functioning of
the brain. But since the brain cannot function alone, but only in con
junction with nerves, receptors and effectors, mind is better described
as the functioning of the entire nervous system. " (102, p. 24)
There are three main sections of the brain, namely: (1) fore, (2)
mid, and (3) hind brains. The fore brain is divided into two parts,
bound together by a band of fibers, and these two sections of the fore
brain are called the cerebral hemispheres. It is here that consciousness
has its seat, and the place where the thinking process takes place; and
were it not for the cerebral hemispheres men could never learn to per
form the numerous tasks requiring skill and ingenuity. The mid and
hind brains in man are much smaller than the fore brain, and they con
trol only the automatic and unconscious activities of the nervous sys
tem. Messages are brought from the outside world to the cerebral
hemispheres of the brain by the afferent or sensory nerves; then the
messages are relayed from the central hemispheres to all parts of the
body by the efferent or motor nerves, and movements in the various
muscles are thereby produced. Each part of the body is connected to a



ICE AGES AND MEN 49
special area of the brain; there are areas controlling sight, speech, hear
ing, and smell; and motor centers governing the movements of the var
ious parts of the body. Then there are large tracts of the cerebral hemi
spheres, that are known as association areas; for here mental pictures
are formed and memories stored. By far the most complex part of the
brain is the prefrontal area; for it is the master control center of the
brain, and the seat of the higher mental faculties. In the words of an
able student of evolutionary history: "As we study men of old times, it
will be seen that this (the prefrontal area) is the last part of the brain to
develop, and that since the days of the first ape-men it has increased
very much in size and complexity. This marvelous brain, with its well
organized association areas, and dominating prefrontal area, has been
the chief factor in man's evolution." (58, p. 12)
The lowest animals are devoid of brains. They have instead a nerve
running from head to tail, with smaller branch nerves radiating from it.
The head part of this nerve increased in size and evolved into three
nodules, and this was the earliest type of brain. The nerves of smell ran
into the fore-brain, the optic nerves were connected with the mid
brain, and the taste nerves hooked up with the hind brain. In the rep
tile, the pallium or smell-brain is predominant. In the apes and man the
pallium has shrunken down almost to insignificance. In the primates
the smell-brain has been overshadowed by the neopallium, a structure
dominated by vision. The earliest mammals had snouts and smelled
their way through the world; but when the more intelligent mammals
took to the trees, they had to rely more on sight and touch than on
smell; so they lost their snouts, and their brains expanded. As their
heads bulged to accommodate the growing brains, the eyes crept from
the sides of the head and began to fall frontward. The fields of vision of
the two eyes then overlapped, thus producing stereoscopic vision. Life
in the trees, besides stimulating the growth of the brain and improving
vision, also brought about the differentiation of the forepaws into
hands. It was this combination of brain, eye, and hand that brought the
forerunners of man to the top of the heap. "Man's intellectual preemi
nence," in the words of Elliot Smith, "is based primarily on the evolu
tion of macular vision in a primate with adaptable hands, which at
tained the erect attitude when the cerebral cortex under the conscious
influence of vision came to control and regulate posture." (Cited by Jo
seph McCabe, in 155, p. 32) The fifth or Great Ice Age is estimated to have begun about a mil



50 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
lion and a half years ago and to have lasted until about 25,000 years
ago. The ice advanced and retreated four times in all, so that there
were, in those distant days, four cold glacial periods and three temper
ate interglacial ones. In North America the ice cap covered an area of
four million square miles and in Europe about two million square miles.
In the Miocene period, from twenty-eight million to twelve million
years ago, the human species differentiated into two main types: (1)
Paleoanthropic (ancient men) and (2) Neanthropic (modern men).
These two types lived through the Pliocene period (twelve million to
two million years before present), and struggled for survival in the ice
fields of the Pleistocene period (beginning about two million years
ago). Before the Great Ice Age terminated, Paleoanthropic man had
become extinct, leaving the future to Homo sapiens, the culmination of
the Neanthropic line. Pleistocene men are appropriately known as the
men of the Old Stone Age, for in the words of Professor G. G. Mac
Curdy, "the paleolithic is practically coextensive with the pleistocene
epoch and the Ice Age." The Old Stone Age is divided into seven cul
ture stages; the first four being called the Lower Paleolithic, and the
last three, the Upper Paleolithic. The seven stages of the Paleolithic
age are designated by the archaeologists as follows:
1. Abbevillian (also called Mesvinian or pre-Chellean). The imple
ments of this stage, in Europe, date back to about 125,000 B.C.,
and the workmanship is crude, with distinctive types being con
spicuous by their absence. The earliest tool of European man
belongs to this epoch, being a stone implement shaped to fit the
fist, crudely flaked and pointed, known as the coup-de-poing, or
fist-hatchet. [The earliest Stone Age artifacts in Europe were
found near Abbeville, France, by Boucher de Perthes, in 1844,
and hence this culture stage was called Abbevillian. Later similar
stone relics were unearthed at Mesvin, Belgium, and some au
thorities have named this stage the Mesvinian. Since this culture
stage preceded the Chellean, it is also widely known as pre-Chel
lean. In recent years stone artifacts of an Abbevillian type have
been found in East Africa, and are believed to be about 300,000
years old.]
2. Chellean. The relics of the Chellean culture stage were first found
at Chelles, France, hence the name. They date back to about 100,000 B.C. The pre-Chellean coup-de-poing was improved at
this time by roughly flaking it on both sides and giving it an a 1



ICE AGES AND MEN 51
mond-shaped point and better fitting to the grasping hand. The
men of Chelles also manufactured stone scrapers and spokeshaves
of stone, but these were chipped on one face only.
Acheulean. The name is derived from St. Acheuel, near Amiens,
France. This culture was widespread around 80,000 years ago.
Acheulean stone relics have been found not only in Europe, but
also in Greenland, Canada, our own U.S.A., Mexico, Africa,
Western Asia, India and China. This culture was a refinement of
the Chellean stage; the coup-de-poings, or hand-axes were more
expertly made; and among the abundant Acheulian relics are ar
rowheads, spear-heads, knives, hammers, scrapers, and anvils.
Among the makers of these artifacts are believed to have been the
ancient men of Mauer (Heidelberg) and Peking.
Mousterian. This culture stage is named after the cave of I,e
Moustier, on the Vezere River, in France. The fist-hatchet or
hand-axe continued in use among the Neanderthals of the Mous
terian culture level, but it was no longer the dominant imple
ment, for the scraper and point largely superseded it. This cul
ture stage is found on all continents, especially in association with
the remains of Neanderthals of about 50,000 years ago. These an
cient men also produced artifacts of bone.
Aurignacian. The name is from Aurignac, France, where these
remains were first found. In this phase of culture we enter the
Upper Paleolithic, a culture epoch, in which a type of Homo sapiens, known as Cro-Magnon Man, seems to have been the domi
nant type. These men continued to use the older type tools, but
also invented new ones, such as the dart-thrower, the needle
(made of bone or ivory) and a harpoon made from reindeer horn. These cave men were also artists; as they engraved and drew pic
tures in relief and in the round on the walls of their caves. These
figures were often skillfully colored with crayons of ocher or
manganese. These men lived in Europe about 30,000 years ago.
Solutrean. Named after artifacts discovered at Solutre, France.
The Solutrean epoch has been divided into upper and lower
phases. The Lower Solutrean was characterized by implements
with laurel-leaf blades, chipped on both sides and reduced to
great thinness. The Upper Solutrean, on the other hand, was
characterized by the production of small pointed willow-leaf
shaped implements, with a single lateral notch at the base. In this
phase of the Solutrean culture, around 22,000 years ago, in Spain,

7. Magdalenian. This culture stage is named from La Madeleine, on
the Vezere River, in France. The laurel and willow-leaf tools of
the Solutrean epoch did not survive among the Magdalenians.
The graver still persisted, and a new type of parrot-beak imple
ment was invented. At the close of the Magdalenian, the harpoon
made of reindeer horn survived in a much-improved form. The
Magdalenian cave artists produced some of the best artwork of
the Old Stone Age—especially the polychrome frescoes of the
Altimira Cave in Spain.
The Great Ice Age was now over, but man, on the road to civiliza
tion, had yet to pass through the Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age and
the Neolithic or New Stone Age; but, before we proceed, there is a
question relating to the Old Stone Age that should be noted. Since the
Paleolithic chronology is based mainly on finds of European origin, the
question arises: What is the relevance of these European relics to the
rest of the world? The conclusion that Paleolithic cultures were of Eu
ropean origin would certainly be unwarranted. At the present time it
seems reasonable to believe that the Paleolithic period commenced in
Africa, and in later days spread to Europe. Future discoveries will indu
bitably bring to light new evidence, but the gist of the African discov
eries was foreseen some years ago by Sir Arthur Keith, and has been
summarized in one sentence by a distinguished historian of civilization:
The skull and cave-painting found in Rhodesia in 1921, the flints discov
ered in Egypt by De Morgan in 1896, the paleolithic finds of Seton-Karr in
Somaliland, the Old Stone Age deposits in the basin of the Fayum, and the
Still Bay culture of South Africa, indicate that the Dark Continent went
through approximately the same prehistoric periods of development in the
art of flaking stone as those which we have outlined in Europe; perhaps, in
deed, the quasi-Aurignacian remains in Tunis and Algiers strengthen the
hypothesis of an African origin or stopping point for the Cro-Magnon race,
and therefore for European man. (76, p. 94)
The study of the prehistoric archaeology of Africa is a project still in
its infancy, but there is a good brief discussion of it in Men of the Dawn
by Dorothy Davison. (58)
The Epi-Paleolithic or Mesolithic period may be properly desig



ICE AGES AND MEN 53
nared as the Dark Ages of prehistoric times. "It was," says Dorothy
Davison, "a time of degeneration for Europe, when old ideas passed
away, and new ones had not yet travelled from the earliest civilizations
of the Eastern Mediterranean to take their place." (58, p. 151) The
Mesolithic period has been divided into six culture phases, bearing the
following names: (1) Azilian, (2) Tardenoisian, (3) Maglemosean, (4)
Asturian, (5) Shell-Heap, and (6) Campignian.
The Azilian phase was widespread in western Europe; and in the
fossil deposits are a plenitude of the bones of stags, but reindeer bones
are absent. The lithic remains show small flint blades and disk-shaped
scrapers, and pebbles used as paring knives and chisels. The Azilians
manufactured a flat staghorn harpoon with a perforated base. Among
the Azilian artifacts were found pebbles painted with geometrical de
signs in red; for what reason we do not know.
The next culture stage in western Europe was the Tardenoisian.
Painted pebbles were absent, but small stone implements, called micro
liths, were abundant; and these were frequently of geometric design,
being shaped into the forms of crescents, triangles, and trapeziums; and
scratchers and small blades were likewise plentiful. The Azilian and
Tardenoisian cultures seem to have overlapped; for in the Cave of
Valle, in northern Spain, both Azilian and Tardenoisian tools are found
in the same layer.
The Maglemosean culture seems to have been restricted to Scandi
navia, the best remains having been found in sites in Denmark. It per
haps was an offshoot of the Tardenoisian, since both cultures had much
in common—especially a composite implement, made of bone, with an
armature of microliths.
The Asturian culture, named after the province of Asturias, in
Spain, is probably a local and late phase of the Mesolithic. The typical
tool of the Asturian phase was a pick, chipped to a crude point, from an oval pebble. Bone tools were few in number, and these were crudely
made.
The Shell-Heap culture, located on or near present shorelines, was
named after the great heaps of shells left on the shorelines by the pre
historic inhabitants of those regions. Among the stone implements of
this culture were picks, and a type of tool, triangular in shape, with
transverse edge, ranging in size from arrowhead to hatchet. These peo
ple had no polished stone artifacts, and their pottery was crude, bur
they used awls and chisels made from antlers of stags, and possessed
some objects made of bone.



54 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
The Campignian phase seems to have been restricted to France. The
ancient site of the village of Campigny consisted of land habitations
marked by hut pits; and the Campignians had flint tools similar to those
used by the people of the Shell-Heap culture. They were unfamiliar
with the art of polishing stone, but they did have pottery and milling
stones. From that circumstance we gather that they no longer relied
exclusively on the chase as a means of subsistence. Among the animal
population of the Campignians were horses, stags, and oxen; and from
fossil remains we learn of the presence of the oak tree and the ash
among the flora.
Up to now, man had been a gatherer of food, but at the beginning of
the Neolithic period (New Stone Age), he became a food producer.
This was a great step forward in cultural evolution. Man continued to
hunt and fish but he no longer had to rely entirely on these pursuits for
his supply of food and clothing. By the domestication of animals and
plants, and the invention of the ceramic and textile arts, human society
was put on a foundation of greater stability and security. Neolithic men
reduced flint chipping to a fine art, and established flint mining on a
commercial scale. They also shaped and finished stone tools by a proc
ess of fine polishing. Pile villages were built on lakeshores and over
streams and swamplands, and men traveled on water in dugout canoes.
There were two epochs of the New Stone Age. The first was charac
terized by two types of flint axes: an early model with a pointed head,
and a later one with head flat and quadrangular in section. The second
epoch was represented by a new type of flint axe, with the head square
in section. The second epoch has been divided into four phases, charac
terized by the monumental remains predominant in each phase. They
were successively: (1) simple dolmens; (2) many-chambered dolmens;
(3) stone cists; and (4) individual graves. A familiar feature of the Neo
lithic period was the huge stone monuments, known as megaliths.
Megalithic monuments are widely distributed in the Old World. In
Africa they have been found in Egypt, Ethiopia, the Sudan, Algeria,
Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, and Madagascar. In Asia we find them in
India, Indonesia, China, Japan, Persia, Syria, Palestine, Russia, and
Turkey. And in Europe megalithic monuments are found in Denmark,
the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy,
France, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Bulgaria, and
Russia.
A Swedish archaeologist, Oscar Montelius, traces Neolithic remains
on the site of the ancient Elamite city of Susa back to an antiquity of



ICE AGES AND MEN 55
20,000 years; and Sir Arthur Evans, the English expert on prehistory,
has traced the culture of Knossus, in Crete, 14,000 years into the past.
The New Stone Age began much later than this in western Europe.
After the New Stone Age, there came the ages of Metals; but since
the discovery of metal-working is closely connected with the rise of
civilization, we shall postpone discussion of it to a later chapter.



CHAPTER FOUR
Totemism and Exogamy
THE human race in its long history has developed two fundamentally
different systems of government. The first plan, the foundation of an
cient society, was a social organization based on the kinship group
that is to say, the clan or tribe. The second scheme, the foundation of
modern society, was a political organization based upon territory and
property. In this chapter, we propose to discuss briefly the primitive so
cial organization. There is an extensive literature on this phase of social
anthropology, examples of which will be noted as we proceed; but a
concise survey of the field is here attempted, with optimum clarity and
with the necessary technical terminology defined and explained.
A typical tribe is composed of several kinship groups, known as
clans; and these clans are generally organized into two intermediate
groups known as phratries, with half of the clans in each phratry. A
good example of a typical tribal organization is the Seneca Iroquois, a
famous Amerindian tribe, which consisted of eight clans, grouped into
two phratries as follows:
Phratry A: Clan 1, Bear; Clan 2, Wolf; Clan 3, Beaver; Clan 4,
Turtle
Phratry B: Clan 5, Deer; Clan 6, Snipe; Clan 7, Heron; Clan 8,
Hawk
It will be noticed that all the clans of the Seneca-Iroquois tribe are
named after animals. The animal from which a clan derives its name is
supposedly the ancestor of the clan. A member of the Bear Clan will
tell you that his remote ancestors were bears; a member of the Wolf
Clan will argue the original progenitor of his clan was a wolf, and so
on. This clan ancestor is called the totem. Totemism is one of the most
important institutions of primitive society and it is closely connected
56



TOTEMISM AND EXOGAMY 57
with another primitive institution known as exogamy. The word exog
amy literally means marrying out; and it is that rule in primitive so
cieties which forbids a clan member to marry one of his own group. In
other words, the aforesaid clan member must marry outside the group.
Totemism has been falsely defined by certain writers as a species of
animal worship; but a totem is not a god and, hence, is not an object of
worship. There is considerable literature on totemism, but the classic
work on the subject is Totemism and Exogamy by Sir James George
Frazer (90). The best definition of totemism was given by Professor A. C. Haddon of Cambridge University in an address before the anthro
pological section of the British Association for the Advancement of
Science.
Totemism as Dr. Frazer and I understand it in its fully developed condi
tion [Haddon informs us] implies the division of a people into several totem
kins (or, as they are usually termed, totem clans), each of which has one or
sometimes more than one totem. The totem is usually a species of animal,
sometimes a species of plant, occasionally a natural object or phenomenon,
very rarely a manufactured object. Totemism also involves the rules of ex
ogamy, forbidding marriage between the kins. It is essentially connected
with the matriarchal stage of culture (mother-right), though it passes over
into the patriarchal stage (father-right). The totems are regarded as kins
folk and protectors of the kinsmen, who respect them and abstain from kill
ing and eating them. There is thus a recognition of mutual rights and obli
gations between the members of the kin and their totem. The totem is the
crest or symbol of the kin.
The ideological basis of totemism is a primitive theory of evolution;
for the totemites believe themselves to be descended from the totem
species. "To be descended from a crocodile or blood-brother to the
crow," Professor Read reminds us, "or the same as a kangaroo, must
be, we think, the grotesque notion of a lunatic. We never meet people
who believe such a thing; it has no stronghold in our own breasts. . . .
But every student of early institutions finds it necessary to give himself
some intelligible account of its nature and sources." (202, p. 223)
The totemic complex has a widespread geographic range, being
found in Asia, Australia, Africa, Polynesia, and the Americas. "If we
exclude hypotheses and confine ourselves to facts," Sir J. G. Frazer as
serts, "we may say broadly that totemism is practiced by many savage
and barbarous peoples, . . . who occupy the continents and islands of
the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere, together with a large part of



58 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
North America, and whose complexion shades off from coal black
through dark brown to red. With the doubtful exception of a few
Mongoloid tribes in Assam, no yellow and no white race is totemic."
(90, Vol. IV, p. 14)
The question of the origin of totemism has been discussed exhaus
tively by Frazer in the voluminous work cited above and in some of his
other scholarly studies. The complexity of devising a plausible theory
capable of explaining totemism proved so great that Frazer finally suc
ceeded in framing three different theories of totemic origins, and these
three attempts to explain the phenomena of totemism bear the fol
lowing names: (1) the External Soul Theory, (2) the Industrial
Theory, and (3) the Conceptional Theory. We shall discuss this triplet
of explanations in turn, and try to assess their theoretical value.
To the primitive savage the soul was not some mysterious immaterial
entity; quite the contrary, for in the words of Frazer, "the savage
thinks of it (the soul) as a concrete material thing of a definite bulk, ca
pable of being seen and handled, kept in a box or jar, and liable to be
bruised, fractured or smashed in pieces." This line of thought leads us
logically to the doctrine of the external soul; for, as Frazer contends:
It is not needful that the life, so conceived should be in the man; it may
be absent from his body and still continue to animate him by virtue of a sort
of sympathy or action at a distance. So long as this object which he calls his
life or soul remains unharmed, the man is well; if it is injured, he suffers; if
it is destroyed, he dies. . . . But there may be circumstances in which, if
the life or soul remains in the man, it stands a greater chance of sustaining
injury than if it were stowed away in some safe and secret place. Ac
cordingly, in such circumstances, primitive man takes his soul out of his
body and deposits it for security in some snug spot, intending to replace it
in his body when the danger is past. Or, if he should discover some place of
absolute security, he may be content to leave his soul there permanently.
The advantage of this is that so long as the soul remains unharmed in the
place where he has deposited it, the man himself is immortal; nothing can
kill his body since his life is not in it." (87, p. 668)
In many savage tribes possessing the totemic organization, there ex
isted a ritual of death and resurrection; and in these rites, the young
men of the tribe, at the period of puberty, were subjected to a cere
mony of mock-death. While pretending death, the souls of the young
men were transferred to the tribal totems and, in turn, the souls of the
totems were supposed to enter into the bodies of the young men. The



TOTEMISM AND EXOGAMY 59
ceremonies ended with a rite which purported to restore life to the ini
tiates. The meaning of this ritual death and resurrection is explained by
Frazer: "The lad dies as a man and comes to life again as an animal; the
animal's soul is now in him, and his human soul is in the animal. With
good right, therefore, does he call himself a bear or a wolf or what not,
according to his totem; and with good right does he treat the bears or
wolves or what not as his brethren, since in these animals are lodged
the souls of himself and his kindred." (88, p. 363)
(The foregoing passage is a good short statement of Frazer's Exter
nal Soul Theory; for, according to this theory, the totem is nothing
more than the receptacle in which a man keeps his soul.)
Frazer's Industrial Theory of Totemism is based on the magical Inti
chiuma Ceremonies of the Arunta tribe of Central Australia; and the
purpose of these rites is to multiply the tribal totems, which are usually
edible plants or animals. Each clan strives to multiply its own totem for
the benefit of the other clans, which other groups are permitted to
freely dine on the particular plant or animal of which the aforesaid
totem is representative; but, except on special occasions, no clan is per
mitted to adopt its own totem as an article of diet. A fine example of
this primitive totemic ritual has been transmitted to us by Professor Haddon:
The Wichetty Grub Intichiuma Ceremony is performed in a special cave, where lies a large block of quartzite surrounded by small round
stones. The former represents the perfect insect, and the latter its eggs.
The headman and his associates tap the large stone and chant songs, the
burden of which is an invitation to the insect to lay eggs; the headman
strikes each man with one of the small stones, saying, "you have eaten
much food." Later they go to a large rock which they tap, and invite the animal to come from all directions and lay eggs. After various symbolic
ceremonies, they enter a long narrow booth made of bushes, which represents the chrysalis case from which the perfect insect emerges, and there
they sing of the animal in its various stages and of the sacred stones. There are many similar ceremonies which the men of a totem group make in order to increase or produce their particular totem; thus taking the tribe as a
whole, the object of these ceremonies is that of increasing the total food supply. . . . After the ceremony, when, as a consequence, the animal or
plant has become abundant, the men of all classes and totems go out and bring supplies into the main camp. No one as yet may eat it. The headman of the totem, in the presence of all in the camp, solemnly ears a little and hands the remainder over to the men of the other totems, telling them to eat
freely. If the headman did not eat a little, he would lose the power of per
forming Intichiuma successfully." (104, pp. 42-^}4)



60 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
According to Frazer's Industrial Theory, totemism grew out of the
attempts of primitive man to maintain a plentiful supply of the necessi
ties of subsistence.
The general explanation of totemism to which the magical ceremonies
called lntichiuma seem to point [as explained by Frazer] is that it is pri
marily an organized and cooperative system of magic designed to secure for
the members of the community on the one hand, a plentiful supply of all
the commodities of which they stand in need, and, on the other hand, im
munity from all the perils and dangers to which man is exposed in his struggle with nature. Each totem group on this theory was charged with the superintendence and control of some department of nature from which it took
its name, and with which it sought, as far as possible, to identify itself (90,
Vol. I, p. 116)
Finding both the External Soul and Industrial Theories of totemism,
in turn, inadequate as satisfactory explanations of the origin of the to
temic complex, Frazer framed his Conceptional Theory of Totemism.
Among truly primitive peoples, the true nature of childbirth is not
known, and hence among such groups, the family was matrilineal; that
is, descent was traced through the mother, since the true nature of pa
ternity was unknown. And, indeed, even today, such beliefs are cur
rent among certain tribes of Australia and the Trobriand Islanders of
Melanesia. In central Australia, childbirth is attributed to the agency of
spirits; and these spirits or ghosts are supposed to dwell in trees, rocks,
rivers, etc.; and they leave these habitations to enter women at the mo
ment of conception. When a child is born, it is thought to be a spirit in
human form. If a woman happened to be near a tree haunted by spirits
of kangaroo people at the moment of conception, her child would be
come a member of a clan whose totem was the kangaroo. Or, if a woman became aware of the fact that she was to become a mother
while near rocks inhabited by the spirits of emu people, her child
would be assigned to a clan recognizing the emu as a totem. In such
primitive cultures, human beings are regarded as essentially spirits of
various animals and plants masquerading in human form.
Here at last we seem to find a complete and adequate explanation of the
origin of totemism [Frazer asserts]. The conceptional theory, as I have
called my third, and so far as I can see, my final theory of totemism, ac
counts for all the facts in a simple and natural manner. It explains why people commonly abstain from killing and eating their totemic animals and
plants or otherwise injuring their totems. The reason is that, identifying



TOTEMISM AND EXOGAMY 61
themselves with their totems, they are naturally careful not to hurt or de
stroy them. . . . Lastly, it explains why totemic peoples often confuse their ancestors with their totems. The reason is that, regarding their ancestors as animal or plant in essence, though human in form, they find it hard to distinguish even in thought between their outward human appearance and their bestial or vegetable nature; they think of them vaguely both as men and as animals or plants; the contradiction between the two things does not
perplex them, though they cannot picture it clearly to their minds. . . .
Thus in the conceptional theory we seem to find a sufficient explanation of all the facts and fancies of totemism. (88, pp. 83-85.)
Frazer's three theories of the origin of totemism may be considered
as complementary to each other, rather than contradictory. This, at any rate, was the opinion of Frazer himself.
Perhaps after all [he finally concluded] my first theory is not wholly irreconcilable with my two later theories. Thus, for example, a man whose totem was an emu because the spirit of an emu was supposed to have entered his mother at conception (on the Conceptional Theory) would natu
rally be thought peculiarly qualified to multiply emus for the good of the
tribe (on the Industrial Theory), and it might be deemed advisable that at puberty he should deposit his soul in an emu (on the External Soul Theory) either for safety or in order to strengthen his connection with the birds and increase his power of magically multiplying them. On this view, my three successive theories of totemism would turn out to be, not inconsistent with, but complementary to, each other. (88, p. 363 n)
There are numerous other theories concerning the origin of totem
ism, but here we shall consider only one more. The Right Honorable
John M. Robertson in his scholarly study Pagan Christs, in a discussion
of the relations between totemism and sacraments, attempted to arrive
at a plausible theory of totemic origins; and, finding the current
theories unconvincing, Robertson formulated his own solution of the
problem. In his opinion, totemism arose out of the efforts of primitive
groups to name themselves.
On the difficult subject of totemism [Robertson declares] the suggestion
may here be incidentally offered that, the totem was, in origin, merely the group's way of naming itself. Such group-names were as necessary as individual names; and while a person could readily be labeled from the place of
his birth or any family incident at that period, or by a physical or moral pe
culiarity, clans of the same stock could with difficulty be distinguished in the nomadic state save by arbitrary names, which could best be drawn from the list of natural objects. Indeed, it is hard to conceive how otherwise no
madic clans could first name themselves. (210, p. 100)



°2 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Readers interested in the various ramifications of totemism are re
ferred to Man and His Superstitions by Professor Carveth Read (202).
Exogamy is an institution with its roots in a remote past, but it is
probably not as old as totemism. Its antiquity, however, is so great that
there is no record of its beginnings; for exogamy, like totemism, is of
prehistoric origin. The first scientific study of exogamy was made by
the Scottish anthropologist John F. McLennan, who promulgated a
theory which he thought adequately explained its origin. According to
McLennan, certain savage tribes adopted a custom of killing all female
children at birth, and such tribes would, of necessity, have to seek
wives in other tribes, and hence a practice of marrying outside the
group would naturally develop. This hypothesis is no longer seriously
entertained by anthropologists, since there is no evidence that female
infanticide was ever so prevalent as to have been able to bring about the
practice of exogamy. A far more plausible explanation was offered by the American anthropologist, Lewis Henry Morgan, who held that
groups which resorted to outbreeding would, through the operation of
natural selection, have a great advantage over those subjected to the de
generative effects of inbreeding. If inbreeding were invariably harmful
to a species, Morgan's view would be tenable, and we could believe
that exogamy arose because primitive peoples found by chance that
such a practice was advantageous in the struggle for existence and, as a
result, incorporated it into the tribal mores. "Unfortunately for this
view," an English scholar cogently noted, "there is little or no scientific
evidence that the interbreeding of near relations, provided both are
healthy, has"any biologically injurious consequences." (207, p. 14) (On
the question of the effects of inbreeding on both animals and men, we
recommend to the reader a little book by the late Lord Raglan entitled
Jocasta's Crime [195].) Another famous theory of exogamous origins was advanced by J. J. Atkinson and Andrew Lang, who thought the primitive family was a
patriarchy, consisting of one grown man, his wife or wives, and their
children. The man, being a jealous and greedy brute, invariably drove
away his growing sons and annexed the women to his own harem; and,
of course, the dispossessed sons would, of necessity, have to find them
selves wives in some other group. Exogamy, according to this theory,
was the result of paternal jealousy; and Sigmund Freud later adopted
the jealous brute of Atkinson and Lang to buttress his Oedipus-com
plex idea. Freud expanded the original scheme by speculating that "one



TOTEMISM AND EXOGAMY 63
day the expelled brothers joined forces, slew and are the father, and
thus put an end to the father horde." After this act of cannibalism, in
stead of seizing the women for themselves, the young men, regrerring
whar rhey had done, soughr rheir wives ourside rheir own kinship
group, and thus established exogamy as an accepted practice. We may
dismiss this hypothesis as being a ground for the origin of exogamy,
since there is no evidence that the jealous primitive patriarch and his
harem ever existed. The earliest human group was made up, not of a
father, a mother, and their children, but of a mother and her descend
ants in the female line; since in those early days no other line of descent j
was known. This fact is brilliantly demonstrated by Dr. Robert
BrifTault in his anthropological classic The Mothers. Exogamy, it seems,
was the natural outcome of the matriarchal basis of primitive society.
"The men lived with the clan into which they married," we learn from
Professor Thomson, "and were obliged to surrender their products to
the members of that clan. Thus, the practice of getting husbands from
other clans enables each to extend its diet by obtaining access to foods
which it did not produce itself. The initial function of exogamy was to
circulate the food supply." (248, p. 14)
A most important feature of tribal society is a complex organization
of matrimonial classes which is called by anthropologists the classifica
tory system; and this societal complex is, in fact, a natural outgrowth of
the institution of exogamy. The basic principle of the classificatory sys
tem is that kinship is reckoned between groups rather than between in
dividuals. Under this system, a man calls father, not only his actual fa
ther, but all the men who, according to the tribal mores, might have
been his father; and he names as his mother, not only his real mother, but an entire group of women, any one of whom might have been his
mother, according to the tribal customs. He designates as his wife, not
only his real wife, but also all of the women he might have married, in
agreement with the marriage laws of the tribe. He, likewise, gives the
names of sons and daughters, not only to his own children, but to the children of all the women of the tribe whom he might have married.
This strange system of social kinship must have grown out of a wide
spread primitive practice of group marriage. In the sagacious words of
Sir J. G. Frazer:
Such a system of group marriage would explain simply why every man gives the name of wife to a whole group of women, and every woman gives the name of husband to a whole group of men, . . . why every man and



64 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
every woman apply the names of father and mother to whole groups of men and women of whom it is physically impossible that more than two in
dividuals can be their parents; why every man and every woman apply the name of brother and sister to whole groups of men and women with whom they need not have a drop of blood in common; and why, finally, every man and every woman claim as their sons and daughters whole groups of men and women whom they neither begat nor bare. In short, group mar
riage explains group relationship, and it is hard to see what else can do so.
(88, pp. 156-57)
The classificatory system is based on the division of the tribe into
two intermarrying groups; and, besides the two-class system, some
tribes have a four-class or an eight-class system. The two-class system
is fundamental, whereas the four- and eight-class systems are derived from it. It was the opinion of Frazer that "the two-class system of ex
ogamy, or dual organization, as it is often called, suffices of itself to
create the classificatory system of relationship, which appears not to
have been materially affected by the subsequent adoption of the four
class and eight-class systems in certain tribes. This observation is im
portant because, while the classificatory system of relationship is found
to be diffused over a great part of the world, the four-class and eight
class systems have hitherto been detected in Australia alone." (88, p.
1 59) This system of matrimonial classes is of a most ingenious character; the purpose of such a scheme seems to have been to restrict mar
riage between certain groups. The two-class system prevents the mar
riage of brothers with sisters; the four-class system bars the marriage of
parents with children; and the eight-class system prohibits the marriage
of certain first cousins, the children of a brother and of a sister, re
spectively. The marriage of all other first cousins, the offspring of two
brothers, or of two sisters had already been forbidden by the two-class
system.
(The two kinds of first cousins listed above are known as cross-cous
ins and ortho-cousins. The children of a brother and of a sister, respec
tively, are called cross-cousins. The other types of cousins, the children
of two brothers, or of two sisters, had no special name in English until
Frazer called them ortho-cousins.)
The working of the classificatory system in practice is best illus
trated by studying the social organization of a tribe in which the sys
tem is operative; and we select for illustrative purposes the Kamilaroi
tribe of southeast Australia. The tribe is divided into six clans, and the
clans are evenly distributed into two divisions known as phratries or
moieties, as follows:



TOTKMISM AND KXOCAMY 65
Moiery A: Clan I, Dinoun (Emu); Clan 2, Bilba (Bandicoot); Clan 3, Nurai (Blacksnake)
Moiery B: Clan 4, Duli (Iguana); Clan 5, Murriira (Kangaroo); Clan 6, Mure (Opossum) The marrimonial groups are eighr in number, four of which are
composed exclusively of males and four of which are composed exclu
sively of females. Since each group of males is linked with a corresponding group of females, and vice versa, for mating purposes, the
eight groups are actually reduced to four marriage classes, and this type
of exogamy is known as the four-class system. The Kamilaroi classes
are grouped according to sex as follows:
MALE
Ippai
Kumbo
Murri Kubbi
FEMALE
1. Ippata 2. Buta 3. Mata 4. Kapota
All Ippais, of whatever totem, are brothers to each other, since they
are theorerically descended from a common female ancestor. The same
thing is true of all the Kumbos, Murris, and Kubbis respectively. Simi
larly, all Ippatas of whatever clan are sisters to each other; and the same
is true of all the Butas, Matas, and Kapotas, respectively. Furthermore,
the Ippais and Ippatas are brothers and sisters to each other; and the same thing goes for Kumbos and Butas, Murris and Matas, and Kubbis
and Kapotas.
The upshot of all this was clearly explained by Morgan, to wit: 'if
an Ippai and Ippata meet, who have never seen each other before, they
address each other as brother and sister. The Kamilaroi, therefore, are
organized into four great primary groups of brothers and sisters, each group being composed of a male and a female branch; but intermingled
over their area of occupation." (177, p. 51) The rules or laws regulating marriages among the Kamilaroi, as re
corded by Mr. Morgan, are as follows:
"Ippai can marry Kapota and no other. Kumbo can marry Mata and no other. Murri can marry Buta and no other. Kubbi can marry Ippata and no other." (177, p. 51)
In an instructive anthropological srudy, The Science of Social Development, F. A. Brooke, Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Society,



66 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
has adopted the happy expedient of using familiar English names in
place of the native Australian names in order to simplify the explana
tion of the classificatory system; and this practice is illustrated in the
following table:
MOIETY A MOIETY B
Division I
Paul (Ippai)
Pauline (Ippata)
Division II
— Alfreda (Kapota)
= Alfred (Kubbi)
Oliver (Kumbo) = Cecilia (Mata)
Olive (Buta) = Cecil (Murri)
From the above table we see that each moiety is made up of two
divisions as listed; and that a man in Moiety A, Division I, picks his
wife from Division I of Moiety B. In other words, a Paul marries an
Alfreda. A woman in Division 1 of Moiety A will marry a man from
Division I of Moiety B. That is to say, Pauline marries Alfred and so
on, as shown by the table. Since descent is traced through the female
line, the children are always members of the same clans as their moth
ers, but the children become members of a class different from that of
either parent, which fact is shown in the following tabulation:
PARENTS CHILDREN
Paul marries Alfreda = children = Cecil and Cecilia Oliver marries Cecilia = children = Alfred and Alfreda Alfred marries Pauline = children = Oliver and Olive Cecil marries Olive = children = Paul and Pauline
The relationships between the totemic clans and the exogamous
classes are shown in the table below:

TOTEMISM AND EXOGAMY 67
It will be noticed that one set of classes possesses totems in common
with Moiety A and the other set of classes has totems in common with
Moiety B, and that the two divisions of the moieties are equally distrib
uted under the totems. Since the totems are symbolic crests of the
clans, we see that the three clans of each moiety are nothing more than
subdivisions of an original clan; and this circumstance would seem to
confirm Sir J. G. Frazer's opinion that the classiflcatory system is
merely the logical outgrowth of the dual organization.
The Kamilaroi tribe exemplifies the four-class system of exogamy in
its simplest form. However, there is another tribe, the Urubunna,
which enjoins the marriage of second cousins, and this necessitates an
arrangement of the moieties into near and distant sections of the two
divisions of each moiety. Under such a scheme, a man is permitted to
marry a maternal cousin and a woman is allowed to marry a paternal
cousin. The actual working of the system is somewhat complicated, but
the English anthropologist, F. A. Brooke, has a neat explanation of it, which we cite:
A man marries his father's distant sister's daughter, or what is the same
thing, his mother's near brother's daughter, but not his father's near sister's
daughter. A woman marries her father's near sister's son, or what is the
same thing, her mother's distant brother's son, but not her mother's near
brother's son. Distant in this connection is used to denote all those members
of the division who are neither natural brother nor sister nor cousin to a
given individual. For this relationship anthropologists have used elder, which
is incorrect and confusing. 1 have substituted distant as expressing best ex
actly what this relationship is, as they really are distant cousins, or second
cousins. The effect of this was to divide each division into two sections, as it
were, one consisting of those who were regarded as distant in the sense just
defined, or second cousins, and the other of those regarded as near, being
natural brothers and sisters or just cousins, and thus the kin (clan) fell into
four sections. This form of marriage brought about marriage between the
distant and near sections of the two intermarrying divisions of two kins. A
man, then, always marries into what is to him the distant section of the in
termarrying division of his father's kin, i.e., among his maternal cousins,
and the women into the near section, among the paternal cousins. (24, pp. 41-43)
The kinship relations of the Urubunna tribe, which Brooke dis
cussed above, are arranged in a diagram, shown on page 68.
In discussing the marriage systems of Australian tribes, Frazer calls
our attention to certain facts of great importance, for instance: "The

marriage of orrho-cousins (the children of two brothers or of two sis
ters) is prevented by both the two-class system and the four-class sys
tem: the marriage of cross-cousins is prevented by the eight-class sys
tem alone. Hence, Australian tribes which have adopted the eight-class
system ban the marriage of all first cousins whatsoever." (88, p. 1 72n)
The eight-class system of exogamy is operative in the Arunta tribe
of Central Australia; and this tribe practices patrilineal descent. An
other tribe, the Dieri, also possesses the eight-class system, but with
matrilineal descent. In either case, the system operates in the same
way; for, regardless as to whether descent is through mothers or fa
thers, the children always belong to the same moiety as their parent,
but to a different section of it. If the parent is a member of the near sec
tion of Division I, the children will be in the near section of Division II.
This has been neatly tabulated by F. A. Brooke, who appends the fol
lowing remark: "I have used ordinary common names to indicate the
men and women belonging to each section, for the sake of simplicity,
instead of native names, which are apt to make the scheme appear very
complicated, though in reality, it is not." (24, p. 44)

CHAPTER FIVE
The Origin of Magic and Religion
RELIGION has been defined by that master hierologist, Sir James
George Frazer, as "a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to
man which are believed to direct and control the course of nature and
of human life." (86, Part I, "The Magic Art and the Evolution of
Kings," Vol. I, p. 222) If this definition be accepted, and we know not
of a better or more accurate one, we are compelled to conclude that re
ligion is a late development in the realm of human thought. "When
theologians contend that primitive man is everywhere possessed of a
belief in religion," declared the American sociologist, Calverton, "what
they really mean is that he everywhere possessed a belief in magic."
(40, pp. 31-32) Frazer has brilliantly demonstrated in his classic thirteen-volume i
work, The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion, that human
thought in its evolution has passed through three stages, or, as he has
called them, three ages: the Age of Magic, the Age of Religion, and the
Age of Science. For countless thousands of years before religion was
known, man believed in the principles of magic and strove to put them
into practice in his daily life. One feature of magic is universality.
"Magic is world-wide," Professor William Howells truly stated, "by
which I mean that it is the property not only of all primitive people,
but also of ourselves and all our ancestors, and it is the same thing pre
cisely wherever it is found." (121, p. 48) The statement above from
the pen of Dr. Howells is a vindication of the theoretical position taken by Sir J. G. Frazer in Volume I, Part I, of The Golden Bough.
The ancient doctrine of sympathetic magic is based on two princi
ples of thought; the first principle being that like produces like, or that
an effect resembles its cause; and this tenet is known as the Law of
Similarity; and the second principle of thought, basic to magic, is that
71



72 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
things which have at one time been in contact with each other continue
to act upon each other at a distance, after the physical contact has
ceased to exist; and this principle is known as the Law of Contact or
Contagion. The system of sympathetic magic comprises both positive
and negative precepts: The positive precepts are charms; the negative
ones are tabus. Charms founded on the Law of Similarity are known as
Homeopathic Magic; while charms based on the Law of Contact are
designated as Contagious Magic. The two branches of sympathetic
magic are related as shown in the following diagram:
SYMPATHETIC MAGIC
(Based on the Law of Sympathy)
Homeopathic Magic Contagious Magic
(Based on the Law of Similarity) (Based on the Law of Contact)
Magic, in theory, may properly be considered as a pseudo-science,
and in practice as a pseudo-art. Practical magic is also of two types:
positive magic or sorcery, and negative magic or tabu.
This is best shown by illustration—as follows:
MAGIC
Theoretical Practical
(Magic as a pseudo-science) (Magic as a pseudo-art)
Positive Magic Negative Magic
(Sorcery) (Tabu)
There is an ancient magic practice known as envoutement.
This word, which is often used in French books on Magic [we learn from Sir Wallis Budge] means the act of making a figure of wax of a certain
person as exact as possible as regards the face (the Latin in + voltus) and
form and special characteristics, with the intention, after having performed
upon it certain baleful acts and ceremonies, of making the person repre



THE ORIGIN OK MAGIC AND RKLIGION 73
sented by the wax figure to suffer all the pains and indignities which the
magician inflicts on the wax figure. Whilst the magician is attacking the
wax figure, he repeats spells and incantations which effect the transmission
of aches and pains and sufferings to the human being wheresoever he may
be. Thus, if a needle was thrust through the knee joints of the wax figure,
the human being which it represented would suffer agonies in his knees; if a
needle was thrust through the heart of the wax figure, the human being
would die. But evoutement could be practiced with a good as well as a bad
object. For there is on record the case of a seaman who, during a fight at
sea, was shot in the eye with an arrow and as a result he suffered indescrib
able agony. But his friends made a figure of him with the arrow in his eye
and took it to a famous shrine of the Virgin Mary in Syria. The figure of the Virgin drew the arrow out of the eye of the figure, and at the same moment, the arrow which was in the eye of the seaman who was still on the
sea, fell out from it, and the pain ceased from that moment. (29, p. 481)
Contagious magic is based on the belief that things which once had
been in contact with each other would retain a sympathetic connection
even after such contact had been severed. This type of magical attrac
tion is particularly supposed to exist between an individual and his bod
ily relics, such as hair, nails, and navel-string; and clothing and bodily
impressions are also often utilized in the practice of contagious magic.
"This belief explains why a magician," in the words of A. C. Haddon,
"wishing to influence or act upon some particular individual, desires to
obtain some portion of his body or something actually connected with
him. A few hairs from the beard, -a lock of hair, some nail-parings, a
drop of blood from the nose which has fallen to the ground, and which
has not been rendered impalpable by effacing it with the foot, are used by Basuto sorcerers, and indeed by workers of magic everywhere."
(104, p. 3) (In England, even in our own time, a girl deserted by her lover has
been advised to resort to the practice of magic. The girl is supposed to
get a lock of the hair of the faithless suitor; the hair is then to be thrown
in a pot of boiling water and, while the hair simmers in the pot, the
original owner of the same enjoys no rest.)
The essential difference between magic and religion is that magic is
a form of primitive science, whereas religion is a primitive type of met
aphysics. Although the theoretical foundations of magic are definitely
unscientific, both science and magic have similar objective aims. The
position taken by Frazer that magic was an earlier stage of belief than
religion has been denied by many anthropologists in recent years, but,



74 MAN, COD, AND CIVILIZATION
in our opinion, these critics have not proven their case against the eru
dite Scot.
As a case in point, we refer to Jocasta's Crime: An Anthropological
Study (195) by Lord Raglan. Originally published in 1933, this book
appeared in a new edition in 1940. In the preface to the 1940 version,
the noble author makes a confession: "At the time when I wrote this
book, I accepted Sir James Frazer's view of the relation of magic to re
ligion—namely, that magic arises from a simple association of ideas and
is a necessary stage on the upward path to religion. For reasons which I
have given elsewhere, I have since' come to the conclusion that this
view is untenable." A perusal of Lord Raglan's arguments against
Frazer has convinced us that his Lordship failed to prove his case. In
fact, he seems to have had some doubt as to the soundness of his own
position, for he concludes the preface of Jocasta's Crime with the fol
lowing admission: "Finally, the solution of the problem which I have
put forward seems to me even less satisfactory than it did seven years
ago, but I cannot now, any more than I could then, suggest a better."
Among the aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, religion is conspicu
ous by its absence, but magic abounds on all sides. Our most reliable
guides to the indigenous culture of the Australians are Sir Baldwin
Spencer and F. J. Gillen, and these anthropologists have given the fol
lowing description of the role of magic among these primitive peoples
of the Antipodes:
Almost every action in the life of a Central Australian savage from the
day of his birth to the day of his death is associated in some way or another
with magic. No sooner is the Arunta child born than a black line is painted
over his eyebrow in order to ward off sickness. How or why it should do so
does not in the least trouble the parents. They have been told by the old
men that it will and that is enough for them. The idea of putting any of
their beliefs to the test of experiment never enters their heads. If the young
child avoids sickness, then, of course, it is a result of the black line—if the
desired result does not follow, then it means that some other person has
worked evil by counter magic, and the savage goes on his way perfectly
content with this simple explanation." (238, p. 342)
The central Australians are not the only peoples devoid of religion.
An Englishman traveling through Africa asked certain individuals whether or not they offered up prayers to God, and was answered
thusly: "We never pray to God because we do not know him, but we
pray to leaves, fetishes, and to the dead." (49, p. 151) The same out



THE ORIGIN OF MAGIC AND RELIGION 75
look prevails in Zululand. A Zulu was asked if he knew of a god who
controlled the universe, and caused the crops to grow and the sun to
shine. "No, we know of none," he replied. "We know that we cannot
do these things, and suppose that they come of themselves." In the
shadow of Cape Horn, on the wild shores of Tierra Fuego, there is a
group of people known as the Yahgans, and they were studied for two
years (1882-83) by Hyades and Deniker, who reported that they
"never detected the least allusion to any kind of cult or religious idea."
T. Bridges, a missionary, spent twenty years among the Yahgans and,
concerning their religious beliefs, he recorded that: "They have neither
hope nor fear beyond the grave. For them, there is neither God, nor
good, nor evil. . . . Death is the end of existence, and they have no
idea of a spiritual life, or of the composition of man from a body and a
soul." (Cited by Joseph McCabe in 1 58, p. 3 1) Before man reached the
hunting stage, he showed no trace of religion, since the struggle for ex
istence took up all of his time, and hence he could not afford to sit
around and speculate on the whys and wherefores of existence.
The earliest element of religion seems to have been the idea of the
soul; and this conception was based on certain speculations concerning
the meaning of shadows and dreams. "Anthropologists are agreed," de
clared Mr. Clodd, "that the impulse to man's conception of his person
ality, and to that of a general doctrine of spirits comes from dreams, the
inference from these having support in the phenomenon of shadows,
reflections, and echoes, and in the abnormal mental states of hysteria,
swooning, epilepsy and allied disorders." (50, p. 27) In languages rang
ing from Ainu to English, the words for breath and spirit are the same,
and among western Australians the word wang means both breath and
spirit. A similar view prevails among the Melanesians, who hold that,
"the soul goes out of the body in some dreams, and if for some reason it
does not come back, the man is found dead in the morning."
This soul or spirit is imagined to be a sort of vapor, composed of
breath and shadow and reflection. It is a well-known fact that in the
Latin language the word animus (the mind) is cognate with anima (air
or breath), and in the Irish language (a member of the same lingual
family as Latin), anal (breath) is closely related to anam (life or soul).
To primitive man the shadow was a mysterious double of the body; he
could see his shadow on the ground, and in the quiet lake or stream it
was an exact duplicate of the living man. The way the shadow followed
the body about appearing and vanishing silently, and increasing and



76 MAN, COD, AND CIVILIZATION
decreasing in size was most puzzling so that our savage forebear con
cluded that he was a dual being; a combination of body and soul. He
explained death by assuming that it occurred when the shadow or soul
permanently left the body; and dream phenomena reinforced this be
lief. This idea was vividly expressed in u I)e Perum Nature" [Concern
ing the Nature of Things] by the Roman poet, Lucretius:
"When sleep has chained down our limbs in sweet slumber and the
whole body is sunk in profound repose, yet then we seem to ourselves
to be awake and to be moving our limbs, and amid the thick darkness
of night, we think we see the sun and the daylight; and though in a
confined room, we seem to be passing to new climates, seas, rivers,
mountains, and to be crossing plains on foot, and to hear voices, though
the austere silence of night prevails all round, and to be uttering speech,
though quite silent."
The primitive belief that all forms of force and motion are products
of spiritual agency is known as the doctrine of Animism. Among the
legions of spirits, some in time were glorified and magnified and turned
into gods; and this brings us to a consideration of how spirits evolved
into gods. To the ancient animist, there was a soul or spirit in all things.
Every tree, for instance, had a spirit in it. Finally primitive thinkers
began to doubt that each tree had an individual spirit of its own and, in
stead, they conceived of a great spirit of the forests in general. The
multitude of individual souls of trees were spirits in the proper meaning
of the word. The numerous souls, combined into a generalized spirit of
trees as a class, became a god. The gods have proper names, as a rule,
whereas spirits are usually nameless. In ancient Rome, Sylvanus was
the god of forests, but ordinary tree spirits had no names. Originally
each wind had a spirit of its own. Then the various wind spirits were
consolidated into one, and personified as Aeolus, god of the wind. So,
we see that gods are the natural result of spiritual evolution. Animism
(the belief in spirits) gives birth in time to polytheism (the belief in
gods). The earliest gods seem to have been deified chiefs or ancestors.
On the evolution of religious ideas, there has been much speculation,
but the main stages of the process have been exhumed by the experts.
Slowly nature-gods rose above the deified ancestors in importance.
The ancient magicians were the first men to form a leisure class in
primitive society and, when human society reached the agricultural
stage, some of the magicians had evolved into priests and kings. In fact,
the priestly and kingly offices were frequently combined in the person
of one man. In the pyramid texts of ancient Egypt, it was recorded that



THE ORIGIN OF MAGIC AM) RELIGION 77
kings were more ancient than the gods, and the same belief was held by
the Brahmans of India. The doctrine of the divine right of kings stems
from the belief that kings in olden times were actually gods. We can
easily imagine how, in the process of social evolution, priests in certain communities might rise to positions of dominance and, hence, become
kings. A good way for such a king to make his position secure would be
by declaring himself a god. We may reasonably believe that this is just
what did happen. "It does not need much research to show," in the
words of Professor W. J. Perry, "that the claim to divine descent is
based on the fact that certain men actually called themselves gods."
How the early priest-kings formed a ruling class and reduced the
masses to slavery is not known in detail, but we have a good general
idea of how it came about. The subject is discussed at length with both
skill and insight by V. F. Calverton in The Passing of the Gods (40),
and by Robert BrifTault in Rational Evolution (20).
This priestly rule, powerful as it was, did not go unchallenged; for
even in the ancient empires the voice of the skeptic was heard. Around
4,000 years ago, there was a period of chaos in ancient Egypt which
lasted about 200 years. The country was invaded by Asiatic nomads,
and plague and famine swept the land. The rulers and priests could do
nothing for the people, and the disillusioned masses flared up into open
rebellion. This uprising has been called by Hector Hawton, "the first
revolution in history."
"Confronted by the spectacle of tottering thrones, the hungry
plague-smitten masses, whose miseries no words of power could re
lieve, lost faith in kings, priests and gods. They ceased even to search
for the empty boon of a paradise after death." (115, p. 74) An un
known Egyptian skeptic of those far-off days wrote: "Ah! If I knew
where God was I should certainly make an offering to him!" About 2000 B.C., a poem, "The Song of the Harper," was very popular
among the Egyptian people. Professor James Henry Breasted has given
us an English translation of the same, from which the following extract
is quoted:
Let not thy heart be weary,
Follow thy desire and thy pleasure,
And mould thine affairs on earth
After the mandates of the heart Till that day of lamentation cometh to thee,
When the stilled heart hears not the mourning.
For lamentation recalls no man from the dead.



78 MAN, COD, AND CIVILIZATION
We have been informed by Professor W. Max Muller that the
priests repeatedly attempted to repress "The Song of the Harper" be
cause of its "atheistic joy in life," but they had no success, for the song
was popular for centuries. Even the best-organized system of tyranny
must eventually collapse; and, as civilization spread around the world, a
middle class of merchants and traders developed. As these men traveled
about and made contact with new and strange ideas, they began to
doubt the old myths and legends of the gods. Some became mono
theists and agnostics, and others even became atheists, denying the
very existence of the gods. The course of the evolution of religion in
ancient Egypt was accurately charted by Joseph McCabe in 158, p.
1 59, from which we transcribe the following scheme:
(1) Belief in Shadow or Soul
(2a) Animism and Fetishism (2b) Ancestor worship
(3a) Deification of Sun, Moon, etc. (3b) Deified ancestors
(4) Polytheism (5) Monotheism (6) Atheism
This process of religious evolution was not confined to Egypt, for
we find that it eventually reached the New World. An Aztec poet and
philosopher, who died twenty years before Columbus first visited
America, expressed his doubts about the current religion, as follows:
The caverns of earth are filled with pestilential dust which once was the
bones, the flesh, the bodies of great ones who sat upon thrones, deciding
causes, ruling assemblies, governing armies, conquering provinces, possess
ing treasures, tearing down temples, flattering themselves with the pride,
majesty, fortune, praise and dominion. The glories have passed like the dark
smoke thrown by the fires of Popocatepetl, leaving no monument but the
rude skins on which they are written. (240, p. 240)
Sir J. G. Frazer's theory of the evolution of human thought through
successive ages of magic, religion, and science is not taken seriously by
most contemporary anthropologists. But we think it only fair that his
case should be heard. The reader is referred to the first volume of the
complete The Golden Bough (86, pp. 220-22). If human thought in its growth and development has successively
passed through magical, religious, and scientific phases, what is the
meaning of it all? Is science the final stage of human thought, or will
the human mind discover a more advanced stage of thought? Frazer's



THE ORIGIN OF MAGIC AND RELIC; ION 79
answer to the foregoing question was, as usual, comprehensive and is
properly transmitted to the reader in the flawless prose of the author:
In magic, man depends on his own strength to meet the difficulties and
dangers that beset him on every side. He believes in a certain established order of nature on which he can surely count, and which he can manipulate
for his own ends. When he discovers his mistake, when he recognizes sadly
that both the order of nature which he had assumed and the control which
he had believed himself to exercise over it were purely imaginary, he ceases
to rely on his own intelligence and his own unaided efforts, and throws
himself humbly on the mercy of certain great invisible beings behind the
veil of nature, to whom he now ascribes all those far-reaching powers
which he once arrogated to himself.
But, as time goes on, this explanation in its turn proves to be unsatisfac
tory. For it assumes that the succession of natural events is not determined
by immutable laws, but is to some extent variable and irregular, and this as
sumption is not borne out by closer observation. . . . Thus the keener
minds, still pressing forward to a deeper solution of the mysteries of the
universe, come to reject the religious theory of nature as inadequate, and to
revert in a measure to the older standpoint of magic by postulating explic
itly, what in magic had only been implicitly assumed, to wit, an inflexible
regularity in the order of natural events, which, if carefully observed, en
ables us to foresee their course with certainty and to act accordingly. In
short, religion, regarded as an explanation of nature, is displaced by science.
. . . Here at last, after groping about in the dark for countless ages, man
has hit upon a clue to the labyrinth, a golden key that opens many locks in
the treasury of nature.
Yet the history of thought should warn us against concluding that be
cause the scientific theory of the world is the best that has yet been formu
lated, it is necessarily complete and final. We must remember that at bot
tom the generalizations of science or, in common parlance, the laws of
nature are merely hypotheses devised to explain that ever-shifting phantas
magoria of thought which we dignify with the high-sounding names of the
world and the universe. In the last analysis, magic, religion and science are
nothing but theories of thought; and as science has supplanted its predeces
sors, so it may hereafter be itself superseded by some more perfect hypothe
sis, perhaps by some totally different way of looking at the phenomena—of
registering the shadows on the screen—of which we in this generation can form no idea. The advance of knowledge is an infinite progression towards
a goal that forever recedes. (88, pp. 3 39^42)
The student, or the general reader, who has a special interest in the
subject matter of this chapter should become acquainted with the writ



80 MAN, COD, AND CIVILIZATION
ings of Sir James George Frazer, especially The Golden Bough. This
unusual book was first published in two volumes in 1 890; a second edi
tion, in three volumes, was issued in 1900; then from 1911 to 1915 a
third edition in twelve volumes made its appearance; and finally, in
1937, a thirteenth volume was added to the series, with the title After
math: A Supplement to the Golden Bough. This scholarly work is now
out of print, but this need not cause concern, for abridged editions of
the book have been published.
The Golden Bough may be conveniently subdivided into eight parts, which we briefly summarize:
Part 1: In ancient times, in the Alban Hills of Italy, near the town
of Aricia, on the shores of Lake Nemi, there was a sacred grove in
which the goddess Diana was worshiped. The priest who officiated at
this shrine bore the title of King of the Wood, and was originally an in
carnate spirit of forests. This priest-king was charged with the regula
tion of vegetation and fertility by means of the practice of the magical
art. As King of the Wood, he was consort of the nymph Egeria, with
whom he annually contracted a sacred marriage. This custodian of the
sacred grove, with drawn sword, perambulated about a certain oak,
which among its branches harbored boughs of mistletoe. The King of
the Wood had obtained his post by slaying his predecessor and pluck
ing a sprig of the golden bough (mistletoe) from the sacred oak. His
tenure of office was only safe when he remained alert and in good
health. Finally, when too feeble to protect his perilous post any longer,
he fell by the sword of a younger and more vigorous contender who
severed the golden bough from the sacred tree and became the new King of the Wood.
Part 2: The ancient priest-kings were believed to be gods in human
form; and, to protect their souls from injury, their persons were sub
jected to numerous restrictions, known as tabus. A tabu was a thing
forbidden, and all sorts of things were tabu, such as certain foods, the
uttering of certain words, sharp weapons, association with strangers, or
sometimes even with near kin, etc.
Part 3: A sacred kingship was no sinecure, for the occupant of that
high office, on displaying loss of health or virility, was slain and re
placed by a healthy and vigorous successor. Among some primitive
peoples, the kings were killed at the end of fixed periods so as not to
risk peril to the people from any infirmity that might afflict the mon
arch.
Part 4: Some of the ancient gods, such as Adonis, Attis, and Osiris



THE ORIGIN OF MAGIC AND RELIGION 81
were regarded as personifications of various aspects of nature, espe
cially vegetation. These dying and resurrecting gods were connected
with the changing seasons and with the corresponding growth and decay of vegetable life.
Part 5: Among the ancients, the spirit of fertility was sometimes
represented as a genius of the corn crop. The figures of the corn
mother and the corn-maiden in ancient folklore were symbolic respec
tively of the harvested corn and the new crop; and their mythological
duplicates may be found in the Demeter and Persephone of the classi
cal Greeks. Sometimes the corn spirit was personified in animal form,
such as a pig, goat, bull, cat, dog, wolf, etc. This brings to mind Dion
ysus, a genius of fertility, pictured in the form of bull or goat. Such sa
cred animals, representing certain gods, were often slain in the rituals
of ancient cults.
Part 6: Primitive peoples believed that evil spirits could be trans
ferred from afflicted bodies to other objects, both animate and inani
mate. The evil influences were transferred to a scapegoat (human or an
imal), which was then expelled from the community. Such scapegoats
were driven out periodically and also on special occasions in times of
crises.
Part 7: In the period intervening between the deposing of an old
king and the enthronement of a successor, normal life was in a state of
chaos in ancient societies. Certain gala periods of license were permit
ted to commoners and even slaves. Relics of this custom were con
tinued in the Babylonian Sacaea, the Roman Saturnalia and the medie
val European Feast of Fools.
Part 8: Each candidate for the office of King of the Wood at Lake
Nemi had to pluck a sprig of the golden bough from the higher
branches of the sacred oak and then engage the incumbent monarch in
mortal combat. The King of the Wood was a human incarnation of the
sky-god Jupiter, who came down from the sky to dwell in the mistletoe
on the sacred oak in the forest of the sky-queen, Diana, the wife of Ju
piter. (The curious reader may by now wonder why the mistletoe was
called the golden bough. That is a fair question, and something will be
said about it in the next chapter.)



CHAPTER SIX
The Worship of Nature
THE worship of nature is based on the personification of natural phe
nomena; for the men and women of olden times personified the various
objects and forces of nature and worshiped them as gods, 'in these na
ture-worships," that great humanist, the late Edward Carpenter, ob
served:
There may be discerned three fairly independent streams of religious or
quasi-religious enthusiasms: (1) that connected with the phenomena of the heavens; the movements of the sun, planets, and stars, and the awe and wonderment they excited; (2) that connected with the seasons and the very
important matter of the growth of vegetation and food on the earth; and (3)
that connected with the mysteries of sex and reproduction. It is obvious that these three streams would mingle and interfuse with each other a good deal;
but as far as they were separable, the first would tend to create solar heroes
and sun-myths; the second, vegetation- gods and personifications of nature
and the earth-life; while the third would throw its glamour over the other
two, and contribute to the projection of deities or demons worshipped with
all sorts of sexual and phallic rites. (41, pp. 19-20)
The terrestrial gods seem to be older than the celestial deities, so the
earthly divinities will be our first objects of study. The earth itself,
worshiped under the name of the Great Mother, was the oldest of the
gods of nature. This earth-worship was basic in the religions of the
early Amerindians. "The earth was universally believed," wrote E. J.
Payne, "to be the most ancient object in nature; the sun, moon and
stars were considered to be comparatively recent. All living creatures
proceed from the earth; all are sustained by the earth; all are finally re
duced to dust, and return to the earth. Her motherhood was in aborigi
nal America no mere figure of speech, but an article of positive belief."
(183, Vol. I, p. 464)
82



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 83
The Winnebago Indians worshiped the earth as a goddess under the name of Mama (Earth), and Kunika (Grandmother). The Lenni Lenape of Pennsylvania regarded the earth as the universal mother, and
claimed that their ancestors were created in the interior of the earth, and dwelt there before coming out upon the surface. According to
some Amerindian myth makers, their early forebears lived in the bow
els of the earth in human form, while others held that their progenitors
existed underground in the shape of tortoises, rabbits, and ground hogs.
The Caribs of the Antilles considered the earth to be a benevolent
mother who gave forth all the necessities of life. Among these people,
an earthquake was interpreted as a sign given by Mother Earth for all
and sundry to dance for the health and welfare of the tribe; so fol
lowing an earthquake, they danced for four days and four nights by the light of the moon. The dancers were bedecked in gaudy costumes; they wore multicolored marks and loaded themselves down with belts, gar
ters, bracelets, and necklaces, all covered with little shells which
clashed and banged together as they jumped around and about, while a group of old women shook rattles and crooned a doleful song as an accompaniment. The Indians of Peru worshiped the earth as a divinity under the name of Mama Pacha (Mother Earth); and the priests, after making sacrifices to the sun, the thunder, and the moon, and after praying for
the health, prosperity, and victory of the reigning monarch, also sac
rificed to Mother Earth and prayed to her as follows: "Oh, Mother
Earth! Preserve the Lord Inca, thy son, who stands upon thee in peace and safety." The village of Mama (Mother), located on the banks of a tributary of the Rimac River, was the seat of a famous sanctuary of the Earth Mother, who was there worshiped as the consort of Pachacamac (the Creator). Near the village, two streams met below the site of the
sanctuary, and they were called the breasts of Mother Earth. The an
cient Mexicans also worshiped the earth with elaborate rites and cere
monies, but the story is too involved to be discussed in these pages. A
detailed account of these exotic practices may be found in "The Scape
goat," which comprises Part VI, Vol. IX, of Frazer's The Golden
Bough (86). Among the ancient Egyptians, the earth was personified as a male deity by the name of Seb, Keb, or Geb, and his consort was the skygoddess Nut. In Egyptian art, Seb is shown in human form and with
his head adorned with either a crown or a goose. A species of geese
called seb geese was sacred to the god, because of the belief that, once
upon a time, Seb had changed himself into a goose and had traveled



84 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
through the air in that shape; and in the hieroglyphic inscriptions, he is
symbolized as both a goose or an egg. Seb was a personification of both
the earth as a whole and of the surface of the earth and its green mantle
of vegetation. The earth was said to be the body of Seb as well as his
house; for the earth was called the House of Seb, just as the underworld
was called the House of Osiris, and the air, the House of Shu. Strange
to say, on one occasion, Seb laid an egg; and this egg, in due time, burst
asunder and gave birth to the sun-god, in the form of a mysterious bird
known as the Phoenix; and on account of this notorious egg-laying
feat, the earth god earned the title of the Great Cackler. Seb was quite
properly called the Father of the Gods, for the following divinities
were his children: Osiris, Set, Horus the Elder, Isis, and Nephthys.
The Greek mythologists identified Seb with their own Cronus; for,
as Osiris was said to have mutilated his father Seb, likewise Cronus is
said to have mutilated his father Uranus. The analogy does not stop
here, for Osiris, in turn, was mutilated by his brother Set and Cronus
was similarly treated by his son Zeus. This close similarity of Egyptian
and Greek mythic beliefs should not surprise us, for, as Gerald Massey
observed: "When Herodotus visited Egypt and recognized the African
originals of the Greek deities, he makes the sage remark that his coun
trymen, in their ignorance of the beginnings, counted the birth of their
gods from the time when they first acquired a knowledge of them."
(167, p. 2) In ancient Sumer, the earth god was named Enlil, and was a member
of a trinity; his partners were the sky god Anu and the water god Ea. The name Enlil in the Sumerian language meant Lord of the Wind, or
Lord of the Storm; so we see that he was originally a god of the air
rather than of the earth; and we may note that he was the local god of
Nippur, the holy city of the Sumerians. The later Semitic Babylonians
adopted Enlil and changed his name to Bel, or Baal, which title meant
Lord or Master. In the center of the ancient city of Nippur, the sanctu
ary of Enlil was built on an artificial mound; and the outstanding fea
ture of the sacred precincts was the great ziggurat (temple tower). The
structure was pyramidal in shape, and built of brick, with a winding
ramp or stairway encircling it from bottom to top. Such temple towers
were quite common in Babylonia and they, no doubt, gave rise to the
Biblical legend of the Tower of Babel. The great ziggurat of Nippur
was built by Ur-Engar, first king of Ur of the Chaldees, who reigned
about 2,400 B.C. Clay figures of Enlil, unearthed by the Assyriologists,



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 85
show him as a man with long hair and a beard. As a symbol of divinity
he was fitted out with a horned headdress. Enlil was called the Great Mountain and his temple at Nippur was named E-Kur (House of the Mountain); and he was also titled Lord of the Lands, King of Heaven
and Earth, and Father of the Gods. It was Enlil who, at the very begin
ning of things, fought and subdued the powerful dragon, Tiamat, sepa
rated the earth and sky and created the world. Though properly the
God of Earth, Enlil held that title as ruler of the surface of the earth,
for he was not a personification of the material earth as a whole.
Closely related to earth worship is the worship of vegetation. Tree
worship, especially, is of great antiquity and importance in the religious
history of mankind; for from trees ancient peoples derived food, cloth
ing, and shelter; and the primitive animist regarded trees as the abode
of spirits or gods. To appreciate this viewpoint we must attempt to look
at a tree through the eyes of our untutored savage ancestors of the far
distant past. This was done by Edward Clodd, as follows:
Although the tree is rooted to one spot, it responds to every influence
without. Swayed by the breeze, or smitten by the storm, it is never at rest. Murmurs are heard in its leaves, or its branches creak or writhe as in agony; sounds are emitted from the gaunt stem or hollow trunk; voices, the savage doubts not, of the indwelling spirit whose life seems permanently associated
with the fixed tree. While whatever was mysterious about it added to his
fears, he would honor as the gift of the good power the fruit-yielding tree. Where the fermented juices, as of the same plant, brought on frenzy; or
where the fragrant tobacco was sacrificed to the well-pleased spirits; there
and by other means, close relations between god and man and plant were
set up. (50, pp. 72-73)
The Dravidians of India have for ages paid homage to trees, and from them the tree cults of Buddhism and modern Hinduism have un
doubtedly been derived. The sacred Bo tree has been adored by the
Buddhists of Ceylon for over 2,000 years; and it is said that this sacred
plant was propagated from a slip of the famous tree under which Prince
Gautama reclined after his temptation in the wilderness; and it is fur
ther alleged that this slip was sent to Ceylon by the great Indian ruler,
King Asoka, 250 years B.C. The Yakuts of the Siberian Steppes hung
presents on the branches of larches and other trees to propitiate the
spirits thought to reside therein. Even today, the Irish hate to cut down
the white thorn tree, for it is held by them that the Biblical Crown of Thorns, placed on the brow of Christ, was made from the wood of that



86 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
species of tree. The Dyaks of Borneo have a dread of felling certain trees which are supposedly haunted by the souls of the dead; and cer
tain natives of the West Indies will on no account cut down a silk-cot
ton tree; fearing the revenge of the indwelling duppy, or ghost. A trav
eler in the south of Nigeria was shown a sacred tree by a citizen of the
district. "Yes, we say this is our life—the big tree," the visitor was told.
"When any of us dies," his informant added, "his spirit does not go to
another country,' but into the big tree; and this is why we will not have
it cut." Closely connected with tree worship is the reverence paid to the
mistletoe—the parasitic plant so popular as a decoration during the
Christmas holidays. Known among certain ancient peoples as The Golden Bough, this humble plant has been immortalized by Sir James George Frazer in his celebrated and voluminous study of magic and re
ligion. In Book VI of Virgil's epic poem The Aeneid, Aeneas is informed that, before he can visit the underworld, he must take with him an offering to the Queen of the Underworld. This offering was a golden bough, which had to be plucked from a certain tree in a shady
grove sacred to Diana, and located on the shore of Lake Nemi, in the
Alban hills near Rome. The priest who officiated at the sylvan shrine
reigned as the King of the Wood until a fugitive slave should somehow
snatch a branch of mistletoe from the sacred oak, strike the priest with
the plucked twig, and then slay him in a duel. The fugitive slave then became the new King of the Wood, and his reign would terminate
when another fugitive slave challenged his rule and disposed of him in mortal combat. This woodland shrine was sometimes called the grove of Aricia after a nearby town of that name. The strange ritual which
anciently occurred in the Arician grove was expressed in poetic form
by Macaulay in the following lines:
The still glassy lake that sleeps
Beneath Aricia's trees Those trees in whose dim shadow The ghastly priest doth reign,
The priest who slew the slayer,
And shall himself be slain.
Frazer has pictured the ghastly priest as prowling round the sacred
tree day and night with drawn sword, ever on the alert to the challenge
of a rival claimant to the kingship of the wood:
To gentle and pious pilgrims at the shrine, the sight of him might well seem to darken the fair landscape as when a cloud suddenly blots the sun on



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 87
a bright day. The dreamy blue ofltalian skies, the dappled shade of summer
woods and the sparkle of waves in the sun can have accorded but ill with
that stern and sinister figure. Rather, we picture to ourselves the scene as it
may have been witnessed by a belated wayfarer on one of those wild au
tumn nights when the dead leaves are falling thick, and the winds seem to
be singing the dirge of the dying year. It is a sombre picture set to melan
choly music—the background of forest showing black and jagged against a
lowering and stormy sky, the sighing of the wind in the branches, the rustle
of the withered leaves underfoot, the lapping of the cold water upon the
shore, and in the foreground, pacing to and fro, now in twilight and now in
gloom, a dark figure with a glitter of steel at the shoulder whenever the pale
moon, riding clear of the cloud-rack, peers down at him through the matted
Doughs. (87, pp. 1-2)
But why, should not we inquire, was the mistletoe called the golden
bough? That parasitic plant, with its pale green leaves and whitish-yel
low berries, is possessed of no golden luster; but a plausible explanation
was offered by Frazer, who surmised: "Perhaps the name may be de
rived from the rich golden yellow which a bough of mistletoe assumes
when it has been cut and kept for some months; the bright tint is not
confined to the leaves, but spreads to the stalks as well, so that the
whole branch appears to be indeed a Golden Bough. Breton peasants
hang up great branches of mistletoe in front of their cottages and in the
month of June, these bunches are conspicuous for the bright golden
tinge of their foliage." (87, p. 704)
Critics have pointed out the poet Virgil in the Aeneid does not say
the Golden Bough is the mistletoe, but only makes a comparison. In
the poem, we are told how two doves guided Aeneas through a gloomy forest, in whose depth grew the Golden Bough. The poet tells of how
the doves alighted on the branches of a certain tree, "whence shone a
flickering gleam of gold. As in the woods in winter cold, the mistletoe

a plant not native to its tree—is green with fresh leaves and twines
its yellow berries about the boles; such seemed upon the shady holm
oak the leafy gold, so rustled in the gentle breeze the golden leaf." The Golden Bough is here described as growing on a holm oak, and is com
pared with the mistletoe; but we think it reasonable to conclude with
Frazer that: "The inference is almost inevitable, that the Golden
Bough was nothing but the mistletoe seen through the haze of poetry
or of popular superstition." (87, p. 703) The priest of the Arician grove seems to have been a personification of the sacred tree, on whose limbs grew the Golden Bough: hence, as



88 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
the tree was an oak, the King of the Wood was an incarnation of the
oak spirit; and as an oak spirit, his life was in the mistletoe on the oak.
There is an analogy in the myth of the Scandinavian god, Balder, who
could only be killed by having a bough of mistletoe hurled at him, and
by being struck by it. As oaks were sacred to Jupiter, the ancient
Roman sky-god, the King of the Wood may have been a personifica
tion of Jupiter himself, who had come down from heaven in a flash of
lightning to dwell among mortals in the Golden Bough, growing on
the sacred oak on the shore of the Lake of Nemi.
If that were so [again to quote Frazer], we need not wonder that the
priest guarded with drawn sword the mystic bough which contained the
god's life and his own. The goddess whom he served and married was her
self, if I am right, no other than the Queen of Heaven, the true wife of the
sky god. For she, too, loved the solitude of the woods and the lonely hills,
and sailing overhead on clear nights in the likeness of the silver moon she
looked down with pleasure on her own fair image reflected on the calm,
burnished surface of the lake, Diana's Mirror. (89, p. 695)
Sky gods were quite popular in ancient times, and Father Sky was
generally regarded as the husband of Mother Earth. Here the ancient
Egyptians chose to be different; for among them the earth was the hus
band and the sky was the wife. This arrangement may have been due
to the grammatical structure of the Egyptian language; for in that lan
guage the word for sky (pet) is feminine, whereas the word for earth
(to) is masculine. In ancient Egyptian art, the earth god Seb is shown
in human form, lying on the ground, with one arm raised skyward; and
the sky goddess Nut is pictured as a woman with her body arched over
that of her husband; her feet resting on the ground at one of his ex
tremities and her hands touching the earth at the other; and in some
cases, to emphasize her identity with the sky, her body is covered with
stars. According to Egyptian tradition, the earth and sky once touched
each other; the sky goddess Nut was depicted as lying flat on her hus
band, the earth god Seb. Then Shu, god of the air, and father of the sky
goddess, raised up the sky to its present elevation above the earth. In
scenes from the art of ancient Egypt, Shu is shown lifting up Nut with
his upraised hands; and in a text from a royal tomb at Thebes, we read
that Shu "has divided the heaven from the earth; he has uplifted the
heaven in eternity above the earth." The sky goddess is spoken of in
the inscription as "Nut, who gave birth to the gods, the lady of heaven,
the mistress of the two lands." The Egyptian mythologists sometimes



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 89
represented the sky as a huge cow instead of a woman, and the legs of
the heavenly cow were held in place by various gods, while the air god,
Shu, supported the body of the cow. In one inscription, a row of stars
decorates the stomach of the celestial cow, and the sun is shown travel
ing in a boat between her forelegs. (This heavenly cow was sometimes
identified with the goddess Hathor instead of Nut.)
The Babylonians worshiped a trinity, which consisted of the sky god
Anu, the earth god Bel, and the water god Ea. The Semitic Babyloni
ans inherited these gods from the Sumerians, the first civilized inhabit
ants of Mesopotamia. The original Sumerian names of these gods were
Anna (the sky god), Enlil (the earth god), and Enki (the water god);
but since the Semitic equivalents Anu, Bel, and Ea are preferred by
most Assyriologists, we shall follow that usage here. Anu was especially
worshiped at Uruk or Erech, named in the Bible (Genesis X, 10), as
one of the oldest cities of Babylonia. The name, Anu, means "the one
on high," and may be traced back to the Sumerian "An," which meant
"the sky." Anu, as a personification of the sky, corresponds with the
Greek Zeus and the Roman Jupiter. Also like these two sky gods, he
was ruler over all the other gods. Anu was known as both king
(sharru), and Father of the Gods (Abu Hani); and his high rank is
shown by the allotment to him of the number sixty. This number (60)
was the unit of the sexagesimal system of enumeration; it was held to
be a particularly sacred number and was henceforth appropriately as
signed to the King of the Gods. The gods Bel and Ea, as lesser divini
ties, were given the numbers fifty and forty respectively. Anu, as a sky
god, was a dweller in the celestial realms, where he occupied a throne
in the northern sky; and since the King of the Gods must have a
queenly consort, he was provided with a wife, the goddess Antum. In
an inscription written by King Agumkakrime of Babylon (about 1650
B.C.), the monarch made the following prayer: "May Anu and
Antum, who live in heaven, send a blessing on A gum, the good king,
who built the sanctuaries of Marduk and freed from obligation the workmen." Several eminent scholars have contended that sun worship was prob
ably the earliest form of astral theology. "The pre-eminence of the sun,
as the fountain-head of life and man's well being," we have been told,
"must have rendered it at a date almost contemporaneous with the
birth of the race, the chief object of man's worship." (180, p. 141) The
fact is that the sky god was the oldest of the celestial deities, whereas



90 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
stellar, lunar, and solar divinities were a later development. Sun cults
were of great import in the religious history of early man, but solar
worship was nevertheless a late stage in the evolution of natural theol
ogy. "Solar worship was not universal, nor was it essentially basic,"
was the considered judgment of Dr. Wile. "The Chinese did not wor
ship the sun; no actual solar cult existed in Oceania, although Rivers
connects the megaliths of Oceania with the sun cult. . . . The belief of
the stellar cults was taken over by the sun cult." (274, pp. 302-3)
The researches of Sir Norman Lockyer and Sir Wallis Budge have
shown the priority of star worship in the valley of the Nile. The pyra
mids of northern Egypt were oriented east and west (that is, to the
sun) while in southern Egypt the more ancient step pyramids face
southeast. "With such an amplitude, that it could not have been a ques
tion of the sunlight entering the shrine, we are driven, therefore, to star
worship." (34) Some important temples of the south of Egypt and of
Ethiopia were oriented to Alpha Centauri. One of the brilliantly shin
ing stars of the southern skies is Canopus, which figures prominently in
the stellar worship of ancient Egypt. The findings of Lockyer, relating
to ancient star worship in the Nile Valley, have been briefly summa
rized by a noted student of ancient astronomy as follows:
Lxxkyer tells us of a series of temples at Edfu, Philae, Amada and Sem
neh, so oriented at their erection, 6400 B.C. as to show Canopus heralding
the sunrise at the autumnal equinox, when it was known as the symbol of
Khons, or Khonsu, the first southern star god; and of other similar temples
later. At least two of the great structures at Karnak, of 2100 B.C. and 1700
B.C., respectively, pointed to its setting; as did another at Naga, and the
temple of Khons at Thebes, built by Rameses 111 about 1300 B.C., after
wards restored and enlarged under the Ptolemies. It thus probably was the
prominent object in the religion of southern Egypt, where it represented
the god of the waters. ( 1 , pp. 70-7 1
That the worship of the moon is of greater antiquity than that of the
sun is a fact that calls for some sort of explanation.
In fact, as has been repeatedly noted [we learn from the meticulous studies
of Dr. BrifFault], the cults of lunar deities occupy in early phases of religion
a far more important place than those of any other deities. If the fact has
long been overlooked, ... it is owing to the assumption that religious ideas
have arisen as philosophical interpretations of the universe. Were this the
case, the sun would naturally occupy the first place among natural objects
as the most conspicuous image of the powers ruling human destiny. Since



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 91
religion did not, however, originate as a philosophical system, but as the
practice of magic, those considerations are irrelevant and misleading. In
point of fact, the interpretations giving rise to solar cults and mythologies
do not make their appearance until relatively advanced stages of culture
when agriculture on a large scale had developed and primitive notions have
lost much of their significance and the functions and attributes of sun gods,
which are then theoretically and artificially evolved, are found to be bor
rowed from earlier lunar deities. It may indeed be said without exaggera
tion that the great majority of supreme gods possessing cosmic and univer
sal attributes have originally arisen as moon gods, who were primarily
regarded as controlling the powers of generation. (21, pp. 117-18)
The anthropological works of Dr. Robert Briffault are brilliantly po
lemical, especially his three-volume masterpiece, The Mothers, the clas
sic statement of the matriarchal theory of social origins. Most anthro
pologists refuse to admit the theoretical soundness of Briffault's
opinions, but even these critics have been compelled to admit that his
conclusions are backed up by impressive documentation. But we do not
doubt the accuracy of Briffault's contention that moon worship was an
earlier phase of religion than sun worship. An independent study of
this question was made by an American scholar, Ernest Busenbark, in
Symbols, Sex and the Stars in Popular Beliefs (38), which work is rec
ommended to any reader who is interested in the study of ancient sym
bolism. This book, written in a popular style, treats of the origins of
moon and sun worship, astrology, sex symbolism, the mystic meaning
of numbers, the Cabala, and many popular customs, myths, supersti
tions, and religious beliefs.
In the great civilizations of antiquity, the solar cults finally attained a
dominant position in the religious realm; but the other nature gods did
not lose out altogether. The Egyptian moon god, Thoth, for instance,
managed to retain a position of great power in the Nilotic pantheon,
even after the pharaohs began to call themselves Sons of the Sun. On the monuments, Thoth is depicted as an ibis, with mingled black and
white feathers, representing the dark and bright sides of the moon. The
name Thoth literally means the measurer, an appropriate epithet for the
moon god; so he was shown wearing the lunar crescent and disk, and
holding a stylus and a notched palm branch; and was identified with
Hermes Trismegistus, author of the sacred books and the father of
magic. Egyptian sun worship was a most complex system, for the sun was
known by several names, and its various attributes were differentiated



92 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
and made the objects of divine worship. "The Egyptians in the deifica
tion of the sun," as noted by Olcott, "considered the luminary in its
different aspects separating the light from the heat of the sun, and the
orb from the rays. Egyptian sun worship was therefore polytheistic,
and several distinct deities were worshiped as sun gods. Thus, there
were sun gods representing the physical orb, the intellectual sun, the
sun considered as the source of heat, and the source of light, the power
of the sun, the sun in the firmament, and the sun in his resting place."
(180, pp. 150-51) It seems that the greatest of the Nilotic sun gods was Ra or Re, who
was a personification of the physical sun; for, indeed, Ra was the ordi
nary everyday Egyptian name for the sun. Ra was part of a solar trin
ity, the other members being Osiris and Horus. As a solar divinity, Ra
was usually pictured as a hawk-headed man, holding the regal scepter
in one hand and the crux ansata in the other. On his head was a globe
or disk, around which a uraeus or asp was coiled, the serpent being em
blematic of the power over life and death. The image of Ra and the
disk on his head was generally painted red, since the deity was particu
larly associated with the heat of the midday sun. Osiris, on the other
hand, was symbolic of the setting sun. Osiris, as a dweller among men,
assumed the form of the bull, Apis. As a judge of the dead, he was de
picted as a mummy of sacred blue color, armed with the rod of author
ity and the cross of life and adorned with the crown of upper and lower
Egypt. His eldest son, Horus, was the rising sun, who slew the Dragon
of Darkness with a spear (ray). Another among the Egyptian solar
divinities was Amen (or Ammon), and he was a personification of the
sun after it had descended below the western horizon, and was thus hidden from sight. Amen was imaged as a man with the head and horns
of a ram, and his pictures and statues were painted blue, the sacred
color of the source of life. In the Egyptian language, the word ram
means concealment, and the solar god Amen was called the concealed one

an appropriate title for the sun after it had disappeared in the western
sky and descended into the underworld. In Thebes, the cults of Ammon and Ra were consolidated, and the sun was there worshiped
under the name Amen-Ra. Solarism reached its zenith in Egypt during
the reign of Ikhnaton (Amenhotep IV), for this sovereign forbade the
worship of all gods except the great living disk of the sun. He ordered
the names of the other gods erased from the monuments and decreed
that their images should be destroyed. This worship of the solar disk
under the name of A ton came to an end on the death of the heretic



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 93
king, and the old gods again returned to their temples. Among the minor Egyptian sun gods were Ptah, an embodiment of the life-giving
power of the sun, and Mandu, who personified the power of the mid
day sun of summer; and even the rays of the solar orb were deified, under the names of Gom, Kons, and Moni, who were known as Sons of
the Sun.
The Sumerians adored a sun god named Utu, or Babbar, whom the later Semitic Babylonians adopted and worshiped under the name of
Shamash. On ancient cylinder seals, this sun god is shown traveling
across the sky on foot; but, later on, he was considerately provided with
a chariot, drawn by two fiery horses. Shamash was pictured as an old man with a long beard, and with sunbeams radiating from his shoul
ders. His emblem was a four-pointed star within a round disk, with
flickering flames between the points of the star. In the Babylonian
firmament were two doors—one in the east, the other in the west. In the morning, Shamash came from behind the dome of heaven and
passed through the eastern door. Then, after pausing on the summit of
the Mountain of the Sunrise, at the edge of the world, he began his
daily journey across the sky. In the evening, he arrived at the Moun
tain of the Sunset, and then disappeared through the western door into
the underworld. A Babylonian solar demigod of considerable importance was Gilgamesh, whose exploits, known as "The Epic of Gilgam
esh," were inscribed on twelve tablets.
"Noteworthy," as was observed by F. J. Gould, "is the heroic legend of Gilgamesh, whose twelve adventures mark him out as a solar
demi-god, passing through the zodiacal episodes, slaying the lion,
wooed by the virgin Ishtar, sickening and wasting at the close of his
journey, and renewing his glory in the new year. From Chaldea the
myth migrated to Phoenicia, where the hero took the form of Mel
karth; thence another step brings us to Herakles of Greece." (100, p.
118) Herakles is best known to the modern world as Hercules, the Latin form of the Greek name. Most students of mythology should be fa
miliar with the story of the twelve labors of Hercules; for Hercules
is a personification of the sun, and his twelve labors are an allegory
of the passage of the sun through the twelve constellations of the zo
diac. Before proceeding further, we must say something about the signs and constellations of the zodiac. To prevent any confusion concerning
this matter, we direct the attention of the reader to an authoritative ex



94 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
planation of the same, as given by an eminent mathematician and as
tronomer:
It is necessary to make a distinction between the signs of the zodiac and
the constellations of the zodiac. Each sign is exactly thirty degrees long—one
twelfth of the complete zone—and the first sign (Aries) begins with the
vernal equinox. That is, the sun always enters the sign of Aries as it passes
through the vernal equinox. It then traverses Taurus and Gemini and en
ters Cancer at the summer solstice, after which it traverses Leo and Virgo
and enters Libra as it passes through the autumnal equinox. The sun then
traverses the six signs south of Aries again when it arrives at the vernal
equinox.
Hie twelve groups of stars (constellations) within the boundaries of the
twelve signs originally had the same names as the signs, and each constella
tion would remain forever within the corresponding sign if the vernal equinox did not move among the stars. However, Hipparchus discovered (125
B.C.) that the vernal equinox is not a fixed point in the sky, but that it
slowly slips westward along the ecliptic. What a close observer he must
have been to make this discovery seventeen centuries before the invention
of the telescope! This movement of the equinoxes, which is called preces
sion, carries the signs of the zodiac westward around the ecliptic with a con
stant speed that causes them to make a complete circuit of the sky in 26,000
years. Thus the constellations of the zodiac remain fixed but the signs slip steadily westward.
The sign of Aries is now in the constellation Pisces, each sign having
backed into the constellation west of it in the last 2000 years. The signs and
constellations, of the zodiac coincided about 300 B.C., and also about 26,000
B.C. We know they were in use before 300 B.C. They must, therefore, have been invented not later than 26,000 B.C. This gives us some informa
tion as to how long man has been studying the stars. . . . The Greek
writer, Hesiod, says that A returns rises at sunset fifty days after the winter
solstice. In our calendar, this date would be February 19th. This bright star
now rises at sunset in Greece on March 30th. From the known rate of the
shift of the constellations of the zodiac, we can determine that Hesiod lived
about 2800 years ago. (113, pp. 251-52)
The solar zodiac can be traced back to Egypt, where it was known
at a remote period of time, but the solar zodiac was preceded by a lunar
zodiac, which was divided into twenty-seven or twenty-eight lunar
mansions instead of twelve signs. "Although the zodiac is now deter
mined by the course in the heaven apparently pursued by the sun in his
annual journey through the sky," we are told by Professor Arthur
Harding, "it is very probable that it was originally determined by the



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 95
path of the moon, which follows very closely the path of the sun, and
which can be observed at the same time as the stars. The moon moves
eastward among the stars at such a rate that it accomplishes a complete
circuit of the sky in about 28 days." (113, p. 250) Since the lunar
month is between twenty-seven and twenty-eight days, the lunar man
sions were sometimes listed as twenty-seven, although twenty-eight
was the usual figure. The Hindus had a lunar zodiac of twenty-seven
mansions, whereas the Chinese and Arabs counted twenty-eight.
The symbolism of the zodiac is elegantly displayed in the myth of
Hercules. u Of all the ancient divinities," to cite Edward Carpenter,
"perhaps Hercules is the one whose role as a sun god is most generally
admitted. The helper of gods and men, a mighty traveller and invoked
everywhere as the savior, his labors for the good of the world became
ultimately defined and systematized as 12, and corresponding in num
ber to the signs of the zodiac." (41, p. 48) The myth of Hercules was known to the Sumerians, Phoenicians, and Greeks. Herodotus specu
lated on its origin and traced it back to the Egyptians. (See 118, pp.
96-97.) There is no god named Hercules in the official pantheon of
Egypt, but an ancient Greek tradition identified Hercules with the an
cient Nilotic deity, Khonsu. George St. Clair in a scholarly study of
Egyptian mythology, after discussing the better-known gods of ancient
Egypt, directs our attention to a small group of deities standing apart:
These are Amen, Mut and Khonsu, often spoken of as the Triad of
Thebes, or the Trinity of Ethiopia. . . . Budge tells us that the Theban triad had nothing whatever to do with the Book of the Dead, and from this we may suspect that they were either gods newly come up or gods of foreign derivation. For some good reason, the orthodox Egyptian of the old
school kept them out of his sacred books. They were the divinities of Thebes, and that city was hundreds of miles south of Heliopolis; they were
the Trinity of Ethiopia and not of Egypt. (219, p. 404)
In the myth of Hercules, the sun (of which Hercules is the personi
fication) begins his zodiacal journey in the constellation Leo, the Lion;
so the first labor of Hercules was the slaying of the Nemean lion. After
killing the lion, the hero flayed the beast and used its skin thereafter as
a shield. The leonine skin has been compared to the tawny clouds
which the sun trails behind him as he fights his way through vapors,
which he eventually overcomes.
When the sun enters Virgo, the constellation of the Hydra sets; and
thus the second labor of Hercules was the destruction of the Lernean



96 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
hydra. The monster had several heads, one of which was immortal; and
as the hydra raised his heads, one after another, to attack Hercules, the
demigod in turn burned off the heads, and he disposed of the immortal head by burying it beneath a stone.
As the beast was possessed of many heads [writes Olcott] so the storm wind must continually supply new clouds to vanquish the sun; but the
lighter vapor and mist, the immortal head, is only conquered for a time. The sun easily burns up the heavy clouds, the mortal heads, but only hides temporarily the immortal head which raises again and again to daunt him.
In the fight Hercules was attended by his friend Iolus, this name recalls
Iole, signifying the violet tinted clouds, the attendants of the sun in its serene moments. (180, pp. 72-73)
With the commencement of autumn, the sun enters Libra. At this
time of year, the constellation of the Centaur rose above the horizon;
and Hercules, in his third labor, was entertained by a centaur. Still later
on, he slew a group of centaurs fighting over a cask of wine. When the
sun was in Libra, the constellation of the Boar rose in the evening sky;
so, after killing the centaurs, Hercules met the Erymanthian boar and
disposed of him in mortal combat.
When the sun enters Scorpio, the constellation Cassiopeia, anciently
known as the Stag, rises into view, and the fourth labor of Hercules
was the capture of a stag with golden horns and brazen feet.
As the sun passes into Sagittarius, three constellations named after
birds rise, and these three star groups are called the Vulture, the Swan,
and the Eagle:Tn his fifth labor, Hercules kills three birds with arrows.
The constellation Capricorn was also known as the Stable of Augeas,
and the sixth labor of Hercules was the cleansing of the Augean stable.
When the sun is in Aquarius, the Lyre, or celestial Vulture, sets.
Prometheus also sets, while the Bull of Europa is on the meridian. In
the seventh labor, Hercules slew the vulture which had preyed on the
liver of Prometheus, and also captured the wild bull which had laid
waste the island of Crete.
While the sun is in Pisces, Pegasus, the celestial horse, rises; and in
his eighth labor, Hercules carried off the horses of Diomede.
As the sun enters Aries, the Ram of the Golden Fleece, the Ship Argo rises in the evening sky, and Andromeda sets. One of the stars of
Andromeda is called her girdle. Hercules, in the ninth labor, sailed in
the Ship Argo to search for the Golden Fleece; he fought the Amazons,
and captured the girdle of Hippolyte, their queen, and rescued Hesione
from a sea monster, the same as Perseus did Andromeda.



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 97
The sun passes into the Bull or Ox, as the Pleiades rise and Orion
sets; and the tenth labor of Hercules was to restore the seven kid
napped Pleiades to their father, after killing their abductor, King Busi
ris (Orion). Then he went to Spain and stole the oxen of Geryon.
When the sun moves into Gemini, Sirius, the Dog Star, rises; and in
the eleventh labor, Hercules conquered Cerberus, the guardian dog of Hades.
The sun enters Cancer as the constellations of the River and the
Centaur set in the western sky. The constellation Hercules descends to
ward the west, followed by Draco, the Dragon of the pole, guardian of the Golden Apples of the Hesperides. Hercules is represented in star
atlases as crushing the head of the dragon with his foot. In his twelfth and last labor, Hercules journeyed to the Hesperides to seek the Golden Apples. Then he put on a robe dipped in the blood of a cen
taur, slain by him at the crossing of a river. The robe mysteriously
caught fire, and Hercules perished in the flames.
In this death scene of the solar hero [asserts Olcott] and in the glories of his funeral pyre, we have the most famous sunset scene that has ever been presented for our contemplation. All the wondrous coloring that adorns the western sky at set of sun illuminates the canvas, and the reflection of the scene streams afar, lighting the waves of the Aegean and its clustering isles, and painting in enduring hues a scene that all nations proclaim the sub
limest that nature offers to man's vision. (180, p. 74)
The great sun god of the Roman world was Mithra; but it seems that
Mithra originally was not a personification of the light of the sun: He
represented the luminous sky in general. Mithraism was the resultant
of Persian dualism and Chaldean star worship. Just how, where, and when Mithra was transformed from a god of light in general into a sun god in particular we have no certain knowledge. "The change perhaps
took place in Babylonia," Frazer surmised, "where, under the powerful
influence of Chaldean theology and astrology, the Iranian deities were
assimilated to their nearest Semitic counterparts, the supreme god Ahura Mazda being identified with the sky god Bel, while the goddess Anahita was confused with Ishtar, the goddess of the planet Venus, and Mithra was equated with the sun god Shamash." (91, p. 503) The role of Mithra in the Zoroastrian cult of ancient Iran has been so well ex
plained by the Greek Scholar, Plutarch, that we are pleased to repro
duce it here:
Many suppose there to be two gods of opposite inclinations, one delight
ing in good, the other in evil; the first of these is called particularly by the



98 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
name of God, the second by that of Genius or Demon. Zoroaster has denominated them Ormuzd and Ahriman, and has said that of whatever falls
under the cognizance of our senses, light is the best representation of the
one, and darkness and ignorance of the other. He adds that Mithra is an in
termediate being, and it is for this reason the Persians call Mithra the medi
ator or intermediator. . . . The Persians also say, that Ormuzd was born or
formed out of the purest light; Ahriman, on the contrary, out of the thickest
darkness; that Ormuzd made six gods as good as himself, and Ahriman op
posed to them six wicked ones; that Ormuzd afterwards multiplied himself
three fold (Hermes Trismegistus), and removed to a distance as remote
from the sun as the sun is remote from the earth; that he there formed stars,
and among others, Sirius, which he placed in the heavens as a guard or sen
tinel. He made also twenty-four other gods which he enclosed in an egg;
but Ahriman created an equal number on his own part, who broke the egg, and from that moment good and evil were mixed (in the universe). But Ahriman is one day to be conquered and the earth to be made equal and smooth, that all men may live happy. Theopompus adds, from the books of
the Magi, that one of these gods reigns in turn every three thousand years,
during which the other is kept in subjection; that they afterwards contend
with equal portion of time, but that in the end, the evil Genius will fall
(never to rise again). Then men will become happy and their bodies cast no
shade. The god who mediates all these things reclines at present in repose,
waiting till he shall be pleased to execute them, (Isis and Osiris by Plutarch,
as cited by Count Volney in 258, pp. 138-39)
In a commentary on the above citation from Plutarch, Count Vol
ney explained its meaning:
There is an apparent allegory through the whole of this passage. The egg
is the fixed sphere, the world; the six gods of Ormuzd are the six signs of
summer, those of Ahriman, the six signs of winter. The forty-eight other
gods are the forty-eight constellations of the ancient sphere, divided equally between Ahriman and Ormuzd. The office of Sirius, as guard and sentinel,
tells us that the origin of these ideas was Egyptian; finally, the expression
that the earth is to become equal and smooth, and that the bodies of happy
beings are to cast no shade, proves that the equator was considered as their
true paradise. (258, p. 139)
Mithra was not content to be one of the minor gods of the Persians,
so he migrated to Chaldea; and from there, his worship spread to Ar
menia and Anatolia. The worship of Mithra soon established itself
among the ruling classes of Pontus, Cappadocia, and Lydia. In the first
century B.C., Mithridates Eupator, King of Pontus, an ardent devotee



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 99
of the sun god Mithra, waged war with the legions of Rome. In this
struggle, Mithridates was aided by Cilician pirates, and it is believed
that these pirates were converted to Mithraism by their royal patron.
At any rate, we know that the pirates, when they were afterward sub
dued by the Romans, proceeded to convert their captors to the worship
of the Unconquered Sun. This solar cult became popular among the sol
diers of the Roman armies. Then it spread among the civilian population, and eventually became the dominant religion of the Roman Em
pire. It may seem paradoxical that a bunch of pirates from the wilds of
Cilicia could introduce a new religion into the august Roman Empire;
but these sea rovers were no ordinary ruffians. The pomp and cere
mony in which they habitually indulged is vividly conveyed to us by
Sir J. G. Frazer in his characteristically charming style:
Outside the Anatolian tableland, the first to observe the rites of Mithra
are said to have been the Cilician pirates. During the civil wars which dis
tracted the attention and absorbed the energies of the Romans in the first
century of our era, the daring rovers seized the opportunity to issue from
the secret creeks and winding rivers of Cilicia and scour the seas, landing
from time to time, harrying islands, holding cities to ransom, and carrying
off from some of the most famous sanctuaries the wealth which had been accumulated there by the piety of the ages. Gorged with plunder and elated
by the impunity which they long enjoyed, the corsairs rose to an extraordi
nary pitch of audacity and effrontery, marching up the highroads of Italy,
plundering villas, and abducting Roman magistrates in their robes of office;
while at sea they displayed a pomp and pageantry proportioned to the
riches which they had amassed by their successful forays. Their galleys
flaunted gilded sails and purple awnings, and glided along to the measured
plash of silvered oars, while the sounds of music and revelry wafted across
the water, told to the trembling inhabitants of the neighboring coasts the
riot and debauchery of the buccaneers. (91, pp. 505-6)
At the end of the first century of the Christian Era, Mithraism had
so far progressed in the conquest of the Roman Empire that the poet
Statius seriously suggested that the old sun god Apollo might desire to
have his worshipers address him as "Mithra, who under the rocks of the
Persian cave twists the bull's struggling horns." The poet was referring
to a sculptured scene that is carved on many Mithraic monuments
throughout the length and breadth of the Roman Empire. The carving
depicts Mithra in a cave, kneeling on the back of a bull. With one hand
he is twisting the head of the bull, while with the other hand he is driv
ing a knife into the flank of the animal.



100 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
In commenting on the sentiment expressed by Statius, the scholiast
Lactantius Placidus tells us that Mithra was the sun, worshiped in caves
by the Persians; and the horned bull was symbolic of the horned moon.
The scene was imaged in a cave as suggestive of an eclipse of the sun, which was caused by the moon coming between the sun and the earth.
The same scholiast also noted that the Mithra was sometimes pictured
with the head of a lion—a circumstance which he connected with the
entrance of the sun into the constellation Leo (the Lion), as it travels
through the zodiac; or as an emblem of the superiority of the sun over
all other gods, which may be justly likened to the primacy of the lion
over all the other beasts. The last speculation is both ingenious and er
roneous; for the lion-headed god could hardly have been Mithra. We
have learned from the researches of Cumont and Frazer that the image
of a lion-headed deity, with a serpent twined around his body, and
grasping one or two keys in his hands, was the Persian god Zervan Ak
arana (Infinite Time), a personification of time. A sect of the Magi re
garded this divinity as the progenitor of all things, and the creator of both Ormuzd and Ahriman. In the numerous monuments showing the
sacrifice of the bull in Mithraic art, besides the god Mithra, there are
two other male figures, dressed like the god and, like him, wearing
peaked Phrygian caps. These two associates flank the bull-slaying
deity, and one of them named Cautes holds a burning torch upright
while the other, Cautopates, holds a burning torch upside down. It has
been suggested by the French scholar Montfaucon that the three
figures represent a solar trinity; with Cautes as the rising sun, Mithra as
the midday sun, and Cautopates as the setting sun. The two torch
bearers may also be interpreted as symbols of the sun at the vernal and
autumnal equinoxes, respectively. On some of the monuments, Cautes
is displayed as holding in his hands the head of a bull, or a bull is seen
browsing or resting by his side. Cautopates is, on the other hand,
shown either with a scorpion in his hands, or one is crawling at his feet.
In ancient Babylonia, five thousand years ago, the sun entered the zodi
acal sign of Taurus (the Bull) at the vernal equinox, and the passage of
the sun into Scorpio (the Scorpion) took place at the autumnal equi
nox. About three thousand years later in classical Rome, due to the pre
cession of the equinoxes, the sun was in the sign Aries (the Ram) at the
beginning of spring, and in the sign Libra (the Balance) at the begin
ning of autumn. "It is tempting to conjecture," as Frazer noted, uthat
the traditional emblems of the constellations which once marked the
beginning of spring and the beginning of autumn were transmitted



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 101
from Chaldea to the west and preserved in the symbolism of the myste
ries long after they had ceased to correspond with the facts of astron
omy." (91, p. 516)
Sun worship was by no means peculiar to the ancient peoples of the
Old World, for it also flourished in the great empires of ancient Amer
ica. The sun was the reputed founder of the Incan dynasty of Peru,
and the Incas called themselves children of the sun. The Great Temple
of the Sun at Cuzco was an edifice of great splendor consisting of a vast central auditorium which was surrounded by a group of smaller build
ings. The roof of the temple was fabricated from timber plated with
gold, and so much of the precious metal was used in the interior deco
rations that this building was called the Golden Palace. The exterior
walls were encircled by a gold frieze six inches wide, and all apart
ments of the interior were similarly embellished. The entrance of the
temple faced east, and above the altar was a golden disk with a human
face. This disk was studded with precious stones and, at certain seasons
of the year, the rays of the rising sun were reflected from it with great
brilliance. Around the sacred solar disk was arranged a semicircle of the
mummies of past Incas situated on thrones of gold. The smaller ad
juncts to the main temple were sacred to other gods. Chief among
these lesser shrines was the Temple of the Moon, who was the consort
of the Sun; and over the altar of the moon goddess was a silver disk,
flanked by the mummies of departed queens. The lesser fanes were
dedicated to the stars, to lightning, and to the rainbow. Outside the
temple was an extensive garden stocked with beautiful and exotic
plants, and scattered throughout the garden were numerous images of
trees, flowers, and animals made of solid gold.
Interesting relics of ancient sun worship may be observed in the
ceremonies, symbols, and ritual of modern Freemasonry. According to Masonic tradition, the word Freemason can be traced back to ancient Egypt. It was derived from two Egyptian words, Phre (the sun), and
Mas (a child), meaning children of the sun, or sons of light; and from
this combination we derive the word Freemason. A Mason is advised to
travel to the east in search of light, for the sun rises in the east. The
Masonic initiation rites, like those of the ancient mysteries of Egypt,
are a drama based on the astronomical allegory of the death and resur
rection of the sun, and are intended to teach the candidate the doctrines
of the unity of God and the immortality of man; and these tenets are
taught in the ritual of the Third Degree. We learn from Dr. Oliver's
Dictionary of Symbolic Masonry that a lodge has three lights, situated in



102 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
the east, the south, and the west respectively. They are so placed in
allusion to the sun, which rises in the east, crosses the meridian by way
of the south, and sets in the west. There is no light in the north part of
a lodge, since the sun directs no rays from that area. Every Masonic
lodge should be oriented due east and west because the sun, the glory
of the Lord, rises in the east and sets in the west, and in the lodge, the
Master stands in the east, the Junior Warden in the south, and the Sen
ior Warden in the west, which positions are representative of sunrise,
noon, and sunset, respectively.
The three steps depicted on the master's carpet refer to the three de
grees by which the candidate becomes a Master Mason. The three
steps are also emblematic of the zodiacal constellations Taurus, Gem
ini, and Cancer, by which the sun ascends to the summit of the Royal
Arch, which is the starry vault of the sky, or zodiacal arch, reaching
from the vernal to the autumnal equinox.
In Masonic lodges, two pillars are erected, surmounted by globes,
and these are called the Pillars of the Porch. They are said to have been
derived from the pillars of the porch of King Solomon's temple. In
even more ancient Egyptian temples, there were two pillars, one called
Boaz on the north side, representing the sun, and the other named Ja
chiny on the south, pertaining to the moon. It may be of interest to note
that the cornerstone of a Masonic Lodge should be oriented to the
northeast, because the sun rises in the northeast on June 21st, the long
est day in the year. (The above data on the relations between ancient
sun lore and modern Freemasonry were obtained from Stellar Theology and Masonic Astronomy by Robert H. Brown, 32nd Degree Mason
[27].) Thomas Paine, the great hero of the American Revolution, wrote an
essay, u The Origin of Freemasonry," in which he traced that fraternal
order back to the Celtic Druids. u When the Christian religion overran
the religion of the Druids, in Italy, ancient Gaul, Britain and Ireland,"
Paine asserted, "the Druids became the subjects of persecution. This
would naturally and necessarily oblige such of them as remained at
tached to their original religion to meet in secret and under the strong
est injunctions of secrecy. Their safety depended upon it. A false
brother might expose the lives of many of them to destruction; and
from the remains of the religion of the Druids, thus preserved, arose the
institution which, to avoid the name of Druid, took that of Mason, and practiced under this new name, the rites and ceremonies of the
Druids." (181, p. 335)



THF, WORSHIP OF NATURE 103
Paine's explanation of the origin of Freemasonry is somewhat specu
lative, but it was indubitably a step in the right direction. It is well
known that in pre-Roman days western Europe was inhabited by the
Celts—a people whose priests were called Druids. The name Druid
means a wise man, and the Druidic religion was based on the worship
of the sun. Their chief god was Esus or Hesus, and his symbol was the
solar fire. The Druids also paid homage to the solar gods of alien cults,
especially the Greco-Roman divinity Apollo. The historian Diodorus
Siculus noted: "Apollo is worshipped with solemn rites by the inhabit
ants of a large island, which lies off the coast of Gaul in the Northern
Ocean. This island is inhabited by the Hyperboreans, so named be
cause they lived beyond the region of the north wind. The god has
there a remarkable temple, circular in form, and a magnificent forest is
consecrated to him." The large island off the coast of Gaul (France),
we may reasonably conclude was Great Britain, and the circular tem
ple, Stonehenge, which was an important seat of Druidic sun worship.
There is an ancient system of natural religion known as phallic wor
ship, or sex worship, which merits some discussion. The worship of sex
is referred to by scholars as phallism or phallicism; these names being
derived from the Latin form of the Greek word Phallus, which means
the male organ of generation. In a philological sense, phallus is related to
the Sanskrit Phal, which means to produce or to be fruitful; and modern
survivals are found in the German Pfahl and the English Pole. In the
extensive literature on the sex cults and the curious symbolism con
nected therewith, the Sanskrit words Lingam (denoting the male
organ) and Yoni (the female organ) are frequently used.
Certain writers have judged the rites and ceremonies of the phallic
cults to be of an indecent or obscene nature; but such a conclusion is
not supported by a study of the relevant evidence.
In discussing totemism, we noted that certain writers who referred
to this ancient institution as animal worship were not stating the truth.
However, there is a branch of natural religion known as zoolatry (the
worship of animals). The best short statement on this topic was made
by the late F. J. Gould, whom we are pleased to quote:
The animal world, with its changing colors, its variety of forms, its many
languages, its jewelled beauty alternated with creeping ugliness, its amazing
skill and agility, its sweetness in some shapes, its terror in others, has cast a
natural fascination over the uncultured mind. The savage has not the pride
of the civilized man, and does not differentiate himself too broadly from the



104 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
brute. Why, indeed, should he when, as is frequently the case, he believes
the creature has a human, or human-like spirit? Some Redskins forbear
from hurting rattlesnakes fearing the vengeance of the reptile's spirit.
Kaffirs tell the slain elephant that they did not kill him intentionally. When
the Ainus have despatched a bear, they salute the carcase. Other Asiatics
will beg the beast's pardon. In various Pacific islands, the gods are supposed
to find embodiment in birds, who, when they descend upon the food
offered by the worshippers, utter cries which are taken as oracular answers.
The Tongans presented scented oil to the passing whales, thinking the di
vinity would be gratified. The Maoris reverence the spider and see in its
filmy gossamer the ladder by which spirits climb to heaven. In the Philip
pines, the alligator is worshipped; in Ceylon, the goose; in Guinea, the
crocodile. To the ancient Mexicans the owl was an evil spirit. Ducks which
fly abroad at night were regarded by the Abipones as souls of the dead. The
Apaches believe rattlesnakes to be incarnations of wicked souls. When a
Samoan was drowned or slain, his friends would sit near the body with a
sheet spread out on the earth; and the ant or butterfly, or whatever lit upon
the sheet first was looked upon as the spirit, caught and carefully wrapped
up, and buried with ceremony.
In ancient days, Egypt was a singular devotee of the animal. Its deities were honored with statues, which compounded the human trunk with the head of a hawk, cat, cow, etc., and it symbolized man's soul by the emblem of a humanheaded hawk. Sacred animals were housed in the temples and
embalmed after death. The ibis especially was consecrated perhaps because
of its welcome appearance with the overflowing Nile, it being regarded as a
divine messenger of that happy event. India is, in modern times, a great
venerator of animals, such as the cow. Siva the god is incarnate in the mon
key, Durga in the jackal, Vishnu in the eagle; and the image of Ganesa is
adorned with an elephant's head. Curious survivals of zoolatry are seen in the worship which Christianity even now pays to the Holy Dove and the Lamb of God. (100, pp. 37-38)
So far, we have discussed gods connected with the earth, sky, stars,
moon, sun, trees, animals, and the like; but some gods were composite
in nature; that is, they absorbed the traits and attributes of many other
deities. A good example of this type of god is Osiris, the most popular
divinity of ancient Egypt.
Osiris was the son of the sky goddess Nut, who was the wife of the
sun god Ra. The father of Osiris, however, was not Ra, but the earth
god Seb. When Ra discovered the infidelity of his wife, he pronounced
a curse upon her, predicting that the expected child would be born in
no month and no year. In the meantime, Nut had acquired another



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 105
lover, the god Thoth, and this divinity had previously played a game of
draughts with the moon, and had won from the lunar orb one seventy
second part of each day of the year. The fractional parts were com
pounded into five whole days and were added by Thoth to the Egyp
tian year of 360 days. This was a mythological way of accounting for
the five supplementary days which were added to the Egyptian year in
order to bring the lunar and solar calendars into agreement. And, since
these five extra days were regarded as entirely outside the year of
twelve months, the curse of the sun god Ra did not apply to them. Osi
ris was born on the first of the supplementary days. At his nativity, a
mysterious voice rang out, announcing the earthly advent of the Lord
of All. Osiris was not an only child: On the second supplementary day,
Nut gave birth to the elder Horus; she became the mother of Set on the
third day, of the goddess Isis on the fourth day, and of the goddess
Nephthys on the fifth. In due time, Set married his sister Nephthys,
and Osiris married his sister Isis. Osiris, it is said, withdrew from the
realm of the gods and became an earthly king. He found the Egyptians
savages and conferred upon them the blessings of civilization; since the
inhabitants of the Nile land had been cannibals before the earthly pil
grimage of Osiris. Queen Isis found barley and wheat growing wild on
the banks of the great river, and King Osiris introduced the cultivation
of these grains among the people, who then eschewed cannibalism and
accommodated themselves to a diet of corn. Osiris was the original
gatherer of fruit from trees; he trained the creeping vines to twine
themselves around poles and was the first to tread the grapes. The good
king then turned over the government of Egypt to his queenly wife,
Isis, while he traveled over the world distributing the blessings of agri
culture and civilization to all mankind. In lands where the soil and cli
mate did not permit the culture of the vine, Osiris taught the people to
brew beer from barley. On returning to Egypt, the benevolent mon
arch, on account of the blessings he had diffused among men, was rec
ognized as a god and thus was worshiped by a grateful populace. But,
unfortunately, Osiris had a wicked and jealous brother named Set; and
the evil Set, with seventy-two accomplices, plotted the death of Osiris.
Craftily, Set obtained the measurements of his brother's body and con
structed a coffer of attractive design and of exactly the same dimen
sions. Then at a banquet, when drinking and revelry were at their
height, the wily Set brought in his coffer and offered to make a present
of it to anyone whose body would fit into it exactly. All present, with



106 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
the exception of Osiris, tried out che coffer and none of them fitted into
it; then Osiris lay in it, and it fitted him exactly. Immediately the con
spirators slammed down the lid of the chest, fastened it with nails,
sealed it with molten lead, and then hurled it into the Nile. According
to Plutarch, all this happened on the 1 7th day of the month Athyr,
when the sun entered the zodiacal sign of Scorpio (the Scorpion), and
in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of Osiris.
The widowed Isis soon thereafter went into exile in the papyrus
swamps of the Delta, and there she gave birth to a son, the younger
Horus. Meanwhile, the floating coffin of Osiris had drifted into the Mediterranean Sea and was finally washed up on the coast of Phoeni
cia. Here a mysterious tree sprang up and enclosed the chest in its
trunk. The local king saw the tree and so admired it that he had it cut
down and fashioned into a pillar for his palace at Byblos. Isis wandered
over the face of the earth seeking the body of her dead husband, and
eventually arrived at Byblos. After splitting the tree pillar and retriev
ing the coffer, Isis swathed the pillar in linen, poured ointment over it,
and presented it to the King of Byblos. Then the sacred pillar was in
stalled in a Temple of Isis, where it was thereafter worshiped by the
natives of Byblos. The body of Osiris was taken back to Egypt by Isis,
and there hidden in a secret place. But one ill-fated evening while Set
was hunting for boars by the light of the full moon, he chanced to dis
cover the hidden chest. Proceeding to open it, he took the body of Osi
ris and chopped it into fourteen pieces, which he scattered all over the
land of Egypt, Isis later made a search and found all the parts of Osiris,
except one. Each fragment was buried by Isis where she found it, and
that is why so many cities of Egypt claimed possession of the grave of
Osiris. The missing part of Osiris was the phallus, so Isis made an
image of it for use in the religious festivals of the Egyptians. Such is the
myth of Osiris as told by Plutarch in his treatise On Isis and Osiris,
with some fragmentary data from the literature of ancient Egypt.
The story of Osiris has a happier ending in some of the native Egyp
tian versions which supplement the account written by Plutarch. We
are told that, after Isis had discovered the body of Osiris and collected
the fragments thereof, she and her sister Nephthys sat down and wept. This lament was heard by the sun god Ra, who, moved by compassion,
dispatched from heaven the jackal-headed god Anubis. This divinity,
with the help of Horus, Isis, Nephthys, and the ibis-headed Thoth, re
assembled the body of Osiris from the numerous fragments; then the
gods made a mummy of the corpse. Isis, who by good fortune was



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 107
fitted out with wings, fanned the mummy with them. The breath of
life returned to Osiris and, in consequence, his resurrection from the
dead occurred. He then betook himself to the other world to reign in
perpetuity as King of the Dead. His son Horus, having grown to man
hood, became a king and ruled on earth. Later on, he became the third
person of the great Egyptian trinity of Osiris, lsis, and Horus. The res
urrection of Osiris is pictured in a series of bas-reliefs on the walls of
his temple at Denderah. First we see the dead god as a mummy lying
on his bier. Then he rises up gradually. Finally, we see him standing
erect between the guardian wings of lsis, who stands behind him. In
front of the risen god is a male figure who holds up to his sight a crux
ansata, the symbol of life eternal. Another representation of the great
mystery is depicted in the Temple of lsis at Philae. In this sculpture,
we see the body of Osiris with stalks of corn growing out of it; and
nearby stands a priest pouring water on the cornstalks from a pitcher.
Accompanying this scene is an inscription reading: "This is the form
of him whom one may not name, Osiris of the Mysteries, who springs
from the returning waters." From the above, we gather that Osiris was
a personification of the corn, which sprouts up out of the fields after
they have been fertilized by the annual inundation of the Nile. In fact,
Osiris was sometimes called the crop or the harvest; so we may reasona
bly conclude that in one of his aspects this god was a personification of
the corn, which annually died and came to life again.
Besides being a corn spirit, Osiris was, among other things, a tree
god. His tree aspect was probably the older of the two, since tree wor
ship is thought to be an earlier form of religion than the worship of ce
reals. The church father Firmicus Maternus wrote a book, The Errors
of the Profane Religions, where a pagan religious ceremony is described,
in which Osiris was featured as a tree spirit. The worshipers of the god
first chopped down a pine tree, then hollowed out the center of the
tree. From the excavated wood an image of Osiris was fashioned; and
the image was then buried like a corpse in the hollow of the pine. The
enclosed image was kept for a year and then burned. In the Hall of
Osiris at Denderah, there is a picture of a coffin within which is shown
the hawk-headed mummy of the god, and the coffin is portrayed as en
closed within the trunk of a tree. This scene tends to confirm the accu
racy of the account of the ceremony given us by Firmicus Maternus.
Osiris was also a god of fertility, for phallic images of him were dis
played in the temples and carried in processions. "As a god of vegeta
tion," Frazer pointed out, "Osiris was naturally conceived as a god of



108 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
creative energy in general, since men at a certain stage of evolution fail
to distinguish between the reproductive powers of animals and plants.
Hence, a striking feature of his worship was the coarse but expressive
symbolism by which this aspect of his nature was presented to the eye
not merely of the initiated but of the multitude. At his festival, women
used to go about the village singing songs in his praise and carrying ob
scene images of him which they set in motion by means of strings. The
custom was probably a charm to ensure the growth of crops. " (87, p.
381)
A familiar role of Osiris was that of a god of the dead; among his ti
tles were Ruler of the Dead, Lord of the Underworld, and Lord of
Eternity. On the monuments, he is shown occupying the judgment
seat, armed with the staff of authority and holding the crux ansata.
Carved on his breast is a Saint Andrew's cross; and the throne on
which he is seated is adorned with a pattern of squares in two colors,
like a checkerboard, representing the good and evil which he was called
upon to judge.
Osiris likewise shone as a moon god. That this deity was sometimes
identified with the moon we know from the fact that he was on occa
sion depicted as a mummy, wearing on his head a crescent moon in
place of the usual crown. Plutarch, in his Isis and Osiris, discusses the
theory that Osiris was the moon, and that Set, or Typhon, was the sun,
"because the Moon," says he, "with her humid and generative light, is
favorable to the propagation of animals and the growth of plants; while
the sun, with his fierce fire scorches and burns up all growing things,
renders the greater part of the earth uninhabitable by reason of his
blaze, and often overpowers the moon herself.
1'
Osiris is said to have reigned twenty-eight years as ruler of Egypt.
This may be taken as an allusion to the twenty -eight days of the lunar
month. The rending of the body of Osiris into fourteen parts by Set
and his fellow conspirators refers to the waning of the moon, which
was imagined to lose a portion of itself on each of the fourteen days of
the second half of the lunar month. In the myth, Set finds the body of
Osiris at the time of the full moon; the dismemberment of the latter
consequently began with the waning moon.
The spring season in ancient Egypt began at the new moon of the month Phamenoth. At this time in the temples, a ceremony was cele
brated, called the entry of Osiris into the moon. At the ceremony of
the burial of Osiris, his worshipers constructed a crescent-shaped chest;



THE WORSHIP OF NATURE 109
because the moon, as it approaches the sun, assumes the shape of a cres
cent, and then vanishes altogether.
The bull Apis was representative of the soul of Osiris, and was said
to have been born of a cow impregnated by means of the divine in
fluence emanating from the moon. Once a year, at the full moon, pigs
were sacrificed simultaneously to the moon and to Osiris. And last, but
not least, in ancient Egyptian art, Osiris is sometimes depicted as a hu
man-headed mummy, grasping in his hands the characteristic emblems
of power, and wearing on his head, in place of the customary crown, a
full moon within a crescent.
That Osiris was a sun god, in addition to his other attributes, few, if
any, students of comparative religion would deny. An outstanding
scholar rendered the following verdict: "Mythologically, Osiris was the
sun after its disappearance in the west, where he was slain by the envi
ous Night, and yet, destined to rise again the next morning." (100, p.
108) Sir J. G. Frazer, on the contrary, thought of Osiris as a vegetation
god, and considered theories identifying that god with the sun as ill
founded. Frazer stated his position as follows:
The ground upon which some modern writers seem chiefly to rely for
the identification of Osiris with the sun is that the story of his death fits bet
ter with the solar phenomena than with any other in nature. It may readily
be admitted that the daily appearance and disappearance of the sun might
very naturally be expressed by a myth of his death and resurrection; and
writers who regard Osiris as the sun are careful to indicate that it is the di
urnal, and not the annual course of the sun to which they understand the
myth to apply. Thus, Renouf, who identifies Osiris with the sun, admitted
the Egyptian sun could not, with any show of reason, be described as dead
in winter. But if his daily death was the theme of the legend, why was it
celebrated by an annual ceremony? This fact alone seems fatal to the inter
pretation of the myth as descriptive of sunset and sunrise. Again, though
the sun may be said to die daily, in what sense can he be said to be torn in
pieces? (87, p. 384)
The objections to identifying Osiris with the sun, which were urged
by Frazer, have been ably criticized by the Right Honorable John M.
Robertson, whom we cite:
Rightly intent on establishing a hitherto ill developed principle of mytho
logical interpretation, the cult of the vegetation spirit, Dr. Frazer has
unduly ignored the conjunction seen deductively to be inevitable and inductively to be normal between the concept of the vegetation god and that



no MAN, COD, AND CIVILIZATION
of others, in particular, the sun god. He becomes for once vigorously po
lemical in his attack on the thesis that Osiris was a sun god, as if that were
excluded once for all by proving him a vegetation god. The answer is that
he was both; and that such a synthesis was inevitable. Mithra, who, so far as
the records go, was primordially associated with the sun, and was thereby
named to the last, is mythically born on December 25th, clearly because of
the winter solstice and the rising of the constellation of the Virgin above
the horizon. Dionysus and Adonis, Dr. Frazer shows, are vegetation gods. Yet they too are both born on December 25th as was the Babe Sun God Horus, who, however, was exhibited as rising from a lotus plant. Now, why
should the vegetation god be born at the winter solstice save as having been
identified with the sun god? (208, p. 3 3)
In studying the mythology and religion of ancient Egypt, it becomes
apparent to any reader that he or she is contemplating a system of be
liefs and rites based on the science of astronomy. The priests of ancient
Egypt possessed a profound knowledge of astronomy, and this fact has
been recognized by eminent modern students of the subject. To illus
trate this point, we cite Gerald Massey:
Osiris as light giver in the moon was torn in fourteen pieces during the
latter half of the lunation by the evil Sut (Set), the opposing power of dark
ness. He was put together again and reconstituted by his son, beloved
Horus, the young solar god. This representation could not have been made
until it was known that the lunar light was replenished monthly from the
solar source. Then Horus, as the sun god and the vanquisher of Sut, the
power of darkness, could be called the reconstituter of Osiris in the moon.
(163, p. 187)
One of Massey 's friends, the late George St. Clair, noted: "The
myths of Egypt are all related to one another, and are neither separate
fables nor idle fancies. They reveal an astro-religious system, and tell a
true story of astronomical progress, calendar correction, and theological
changes before the time of our written histories." (219, p. vii)



CHAPTER SEVEN
Myths and Mysteries: Pagan and Christian
SINCE this chapter will discuss myths and mysteries, a few words of
explanation are called for. First, what is a myth? We may say that a
myth is a form of tradition from a Latin word meaning that which is
handed down. Myth is often confused with folklore and legend, which
are also types of tradition. The following definitions of these branches
of traditional lore are those of Lewis Spence, Fellow of the Royal An
thropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland:
(1) Myth. A myth is an account of the deeds of a god or supernatural
being, usually expressed in terms of primitive thought. It is an attempt to
explain the relations of man to the universe and it has for those who recount
it a predominantly religious value; or it may have risen to explain the exist
ence of some social organization, a custom, or the peculiarities of an envi
ronment.
(2) Folklore. Folklore means the study of survival of early custom, belief,
narrative, and art.
(3) Legend. A story, generally of r?al places, often (though not necessar
ily) of real persons, handed down by tradition. (236, pp. 1 1-12)
Myths are closely connected with the ancient ceremonial rites which
are sometimes called the ancient mysteries. These mysteries were mag
ico-religious dramatic performances, and are sometimes called Mys
tery-Dramas or Passion Plays. In the words of Lord Raglan: "Myth
and ritual are complementary; ritual is a magic drama to which myth is
the book of the words which often survives after the drama has ceased
to be performed." (195, p. 106) These ancient mysteries conveyed
their message by three forms of teaching: (1) things said, (2) things
shown, and (3) things performed or acted. The things said were the
myths. The things shown were symbols. The things performed or
111



112 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
acted were rites. So we see that these ancient mystery-plays were based
on mythology, symbolism, and ritualism.
The mythology of the Osirian cult was discussed in our previous
chapter. Now it is necessary to say a few words about the ritual and
symbolism of the worship of Osiris and Isis. As we have hitherto stated,
there is a voluminous literature on the magic and religion of ancient
Egypt, but the best short account of the Osirian rites, so far as we
know, was written by the late Robert Brown, whom we quote:
The Egyptian Mysteries of Osiris and Isis were in the form of a mystic
drama, representing the death by violence of Osiris (the sun god), the
search for his body by Isis, the moon, and its finding and being raised to life
and power again. In the celebration of these mysteries the neophyte was made to perform all the mysterious wanderings of the goddess amid the
most frightful scenes. He was guided by one of the initiated, who wore a
mask representing a dog's head, in allusion to the bright star Sothis (Sirius
or the dog star), so called because the rising of that star each year above the
horizon just before day gave warning of the approaching inundation of the
Nile. The word Sothis means the barker or monitor.
The candidate was by this guide conducted through a dark and mysteri
ous labyrinth. With much pain he struggled through involved paths, over
horrid chasms, in darkness and terror. At length he arrived at a stream of water which he was directed to pass. Suddenly, however, he was assaulted
and arrested by three men, disguised in grotesque forms, who, taking a cup
of water from the stream, forced the terrified candidate to first drink of it.
This was the water of forgetfulness, by drinking which all his former
crimes were to be forgotten, and his mind prepared to receive new instruc
tions of virtue and truth.
The attack of Typhon, or the spirit of darkness, typical of the evil powers
of nature, upon Osiris, who is slain, was also enacted as the initiation pro
gressed, and amid the most terrible scenes, during which the judgment of
the dead was also represented, and the punishments of the wicked exhibited
as realities to the candidate. The search for the body of Osiris, which was
concealed in the mysterious chest or ark, followed. The mutilated remains
were at last found, and deposited amid loud cries of sorrow and despair.
The initiation closed with the return of Osiris to life and power. The can
didate now beheld, amid effulgent beams of light, the joyful mansions of the
blessed and the resplendent plains of paradise. . . .
At this stage of the initiation, all was life, light, and joy. The candidate
was himself figuratively considered to have risen to a new and more perfect
life. The past was dead, with all its crimes and unhappiness. Henceforth,
the candidate was under the special protection of Isis, to whose service he dedicated his new life.



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 113
The sublime mysteries of religion and the profoundest teaching of
science were now revealed to him, and satisfied his thirst for knowledge,
while the possession of power as one of the hierarchy gratified his ambition.
The mysteries of all the other nations of antiquity were quite similar to
those of Egypt, and were no doubt derived from them. (27, pp. 10-11)
The Osirian mysteries were celebrated in various seasonal ceremo
nies. There was a harvest festival that began on the first day of the
ninth month (Pachons), when Ernutet (the goddess of the granary)
gave birth to the god Nepri (the corn god), and when the king
marched in solemn procession to the temple; and, after libations and in
cense were offered to the god, his image was carried in procession im
mediately behind the sovereign, who was preceded by a white bull,
supposedly an incarnation of Min (the god of sexual reproduction),
who was regarded as another form of Amen. The climax of this harvest
festival was the ritual reaping of a sheaf of corn by the pharaoh, who is
said to have performed this service for his father. The king was in this
instance acting in the place of Horus, as the son of Osiris. Min in the
ritual (The Book of the Dead) is identified with Horus, as the champion
of his father, and also with Amen, a cosmic god of Thebes, who, in
turn, was identified with Ra of Heliopolis. This ancient ceremony was
enacted annually at Koptos, where the pharaoh impersonated Horus
and walked in the procession between the sacred bull and the image of
Min.
There was another great festival of Osiris, held at Sais in the month
of Athyr. According to Plutarch, Osiris was slain on the 17th day of
the month Athyr, and the Egyptians then mourned his passing for four
days following the event. Since Plutarch used the Alexandrian calendar
for dating, the four days of mourning for Osiris took place on the 1 3th,
14th, 1 5th, and 16th of November. At this time of year, the level of the
Nile was falling, and the north winds were subsiding. The nights were
growing longer, and leaves were falling from the trees. During the
four-day ritual an image of Isis in the form of a cow wrapped in a black
pall was exhibited. On the 19th day of Athyr, the people went to the
shore of the sea, with priests carrying a shrine containing a golden cas
ket. After the priests poured fresh water into the casket, a multitude of
spectators shouted that Osiris had been found. These ceremonies rep
resented dramatically, first, the search for the dead body of Osiris; sec
ond, its joyful discovery, followed by the resurrection of Osiris from
the dead.



114 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Another cycle of Osirian mysteries was celebrated all over Egypt in
the month of Khoiak, which immediately followed Athyr. These rites
lasted eighteen days from the 12th to the 30th of Khoiak. Images were
made of Osiris, and then these were cast in pure gold, which repre
sented the god as a mummy wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt.
The festival opened on the 12th of Khoiak with a ceremony of plowing
and sowing. The plow, pulled by two black cows, was made of the
wood of a tamarisk, and the share was of black copper. Seed was scat
tered by a boy, who sowed one end of the field with barley, the other
end with spelt, and the middle with flax. During this operation the chief
celebrant recited the ritual chapter of the sowing of the fields. These rites
were enacted in the presence of the cow goddess Shenty, represented
by the image of a cow made of gilt sycamore wood.
On the twenty-second of Khoiak, at the eighth hour [we learn from
Frazer], the images of Osiris, attended by thirty-four images of deities, per
formed a mysterious voyage in thirty-four tiny boats made of papyrus,
which were illuminated by three hundred and sixty-five lights. On the
twenty-fourth of Khoiak, after sunset, the effigy of Osiris in a coffin of
mulberry wood was laid in the grave, and at the ninth hour of the night, the
effigy which had been made and deposited the year before, was removed
and placed upon boughs of sycamore. Lastly, on the thirtieth day of Khoiak,
they repaired to the holy sepulchre, a subterranean chamber over which ap
pears to have grown a clump of Persea trees. Entering the vault by the
western door they laid the coffined effigy of the dead god reverently on a
bed of sand in the chamber. So they left him to his rest, and departed from
the sepulchre by the eastern door.
In the foregoing account of the festival, drawn from the great inscription
of Denderah, the burial of Osiris figures prominently, while his resurrection
is implied rather than expressed. This defect of the document, however, is
amply compensated by a remarkable series of bas reliefs which accompany
and illustrate the inscription. (89, pp. 403^)
The final rites, on the 30th of Khoiak, we are informed by Dr. A. H.
Gardiner, represented l incontestably the day of the resurrection of
Osiris," when "the dead king was recalled in the tomb to a semblance
of his former life." (Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. II, p. 123,
1915) Professor E. O. James regards Dr. Gardiner's opinion as quite sound and makes the following commentary:
This contention is supported by the bas reliefs on the walls of the temple
where Osiris is represented as a mummy, ithyphallic and bearded, lying on



MYTHS AND MYSTKR1ES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 115
a bier at which stand various deities, Anubis, Isis and Nephthys; Hathor the cow goddess and manifestation of the Mother goddess and her brother Heger, together with the frog goddess who probably was a symbol of resurrection. In the twentieth scene, two hawks hover over the body and feet of Osiris and in the twenty-second scene, he is shown wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt with plumes, holding in his hand the sceptre and
flail, in process of raising himself up on his knees. Finally, in the last relief,
he appears as rising up out of his chest with Isis behind him stretching out her wings, while a male bearded god holds before him the crux ansata, or symbol of life. (124, pp. 108-9)
Among the Greek mysteries, the most famous were those celebrated
at Eleusis at five-year intervals. These rites, known as the Eleusinian
Mysteries, were later established among the Romans by the Emperor
Hadrian. A magnificent temple of vast proportions was erected at El
eusis, and the celebration of the mysteries was an impressive and spec
tacular affair. The most important officers who conducted the ceremo
nies were (1) the Hierophant, (2) the Torch Bearer, (3) the Priest, (4) the Archon or king, and (5) the Mystagogue. The Hierophant sat on a splendid throne embellished with gold. He
was attired in royal robes. Over his head was a multicolored picture of
the rainbow, and nearby were images of the moon and seven stars. Around his neck was a chain attached to a golden globe. The Hiero
phant represented the sun. Before him stood twenty-four attendants
clad in white robes and wearing crowns of gold, and these represented
the twenty-four ancient constellations of the upper hemisphere. Around him burned seven bright lights denoting the seven planets of
the ancients. The Torch Bearer, who led the procession representing the wanderings of Rhea in search of the lost god, Bacchus, was em
blematic of the light of the moon. The Priest officiated at the altar, and
wore on his costume a symbol of the moon, since, like the Egyptian
priests of Isis, he was dedicated to the service of the lunar deity. The
Archon preserved order and offered prayers and sacrifices. The poten
tial initiate was qualified by a probationary period, in which he prac
ticed fasting, prayer, chastity, and penitence. Then, after being clad in
sacred garments, crowned with myrtle, and blindfolded, he was turned
over to the Mystagogue, who started the initiation with the following
proclamation: "Depart hence, all ye profane!" The aspirant then started on his arduous pilgrimage, w hich was very
much like the ritual we have already discussed in connection with the
ceremonial of the Osirian cult. To relate them here would be redun
dant; hence they are omitted.



116 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
The purpose of this chapter is to make a comparative study of pagan
and Christian creeds, and the associated mythology and ritualism of
those systems. A few good books have been written along these lines,
but they are not known to the general public. Professor E. O. James
has written a scholarly work entitled Christian Myth and Ritual: A His
torical Study (123). This book is based on lectures delivered at the Uni
versities of London and Oxford, and hence appeals mainly to an audi
ence of scholars. Another work of similar nature is Myth and Ritual in
Christianity by Professor Alan W. Watts (261). Professor Watts states
in the prologue:
A book on Christian Mythology has not, I believe, been written before.
There are some sound reasons for this omission, for the subject is one of ex
treme delicacy and complexity, not because of the actual material, but be
cause the whole problem is, in a very special way, touchy. There are ex
treme differences of violently held opinion about Christianity itself—both
as to what it is, and as to whether or not it is a good thing. Similarly, there
are rather wide differences as to the nature and value of mythology, which
has only recently become a subject of serious study. But when one takes the
two together, one is doing something best expressed by the colloquialism
sticking one's neck out—and sticking it out very far. (261, p. 5)
The above work by Professor Watts also will appeal mainly to
scholars and students. We believe that the lay reader also has an inter
est in these subjects and that a popular presentation is in order. So, to
start off, we propose to say a few words about the cardinal doctrines of
the Christian religion, and then to compare them with similar ideas of
the ancient pagans.
The cardinal doctrines of the Christian religion are (1) the Fall of
Man and (2) the Atonement. The liberal Christian apologists no
longer subscribe to a literal belief in the Fall of Man, for they relegated
Adam and Eve to the realm of mythology. These liberals are opposed
by the orthodox apologists, who maintain the position that belief in the
Atonement implies belief in the Fall of Man. Logic, to us, seems to be
on the orthodox side, as has been so clearly expressed by T. W. Doane:
These two dogmas cannot be separated from each other. If there was no fall, there is no need of an atonement, and no redeemer is required. Those,
then, who consent in recognizing in Christ Jesus a god and redeemer and
who, notwithstanding, cannot resolve upon admitting the story of the Fall
of Man to be historical, should exculpate themselves from the reproach of
inconsistency. (69, p. 17)



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN \\7
Anyone familiar with the historical criticism of the Bible knows that
there are two stories concerning the creation and fall of man in the
book of Genesis. The first or priestly account was written in the fifth
century B.C. and extends from the beginning of Genesis through verse
3 of Chapter II. The second or Jehovistk account begins with verse 4
of Chapter II and extends through Chapter 111, and this version of the
story was written in the eighth century B.C. (It is of interest to note
that the second narrative antedates the first by three hundred years.)
Assyrian terra cotta tablets discovered in the ruins of Nineveh were
examined by George Smith, an Orientalist of the British Museum.
These tablets date from 1 500 to 2000 B.C. and contain stories of the
Creation of Man, the Deluge, and the Tower of Babel. In reference to
an engraving on an Assyrian cylinder, Smith noted: "One striking and
important specimen of early type in the British Museum collection has
two figures sitting one on each side of a tree, holding out their hands to
the fruit, while at the back of one (the woman) is scratched a serpent.
. . . Thus it is evident that a form of the story of the Fall, similar to
that of Genesis, was known in early times in Babylonia." (233, p. 91)
In the original Babylonian Eden myth, as translated by Professor
Edward Chiera, there is the story of a great conflict among the gods,
who cannot decide whether man should be created or not. The opposi
tion to the creation of man was led by a female reptile, the dragon Ti
amat, and this brought against her the hostility of the great god Bel,
who favored the creation of the human race; so the dragon and the god
engaged in hostilities. Finally, Bel overcame Tiamat by blasting her
with thunderbolts; and, the opposition having been crushed, man was
created.
This conflict between Bel and the Dragon bears a close analogy to
the story of the revolution in heaven as recorded in the Apocalypse:
"And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against
the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not;
neither was their place found anymore in heaven. And the great
Dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan,
which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and
his angels were cast out with him." (Revelations, XII, 7-9)
We have a variant of this myth in the story of Saint George and the
Dragon. This fable has been traced back to ancient Egypt. Saint
George, patron saint of England, was originally an Egyptian god,
Horus, and the dragon was the Egyptian devil Set. The struggle be



118 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
tween Horus and Set was an important feature of Egyptian mythology.
Set represented the destructive forces of nature. He was the setting of
the sun, the waning of the moon, and the decrease of the waters of the
river Nile. He was depicted as the left or black eye of the waning sun,
ruling over the year from the summer to the winter solstice, while his
diametrical opposite was the right or bright eye of Horus, the waxing
sun, symbolic of the growth of life and the increase of light from the
winter to the summer solstice.
The hypothetical first man of the Bible is rightly named Adam.
Now the word Adam means man, and we learn from the sacred anthol
ogy that Adam (man) was made out of adamah (ground or earth). Sim
ilarly, in ancient Rome, the first man was called Homo, because he was
reputedly made from humus (the earth). According to an ancient
Egyptian myth, Khnumu, the Father of the Gods, molded the earliest
men out of clay on a potter's wheel. A similar tale is told among the
modern Shilluks of the White Nile. The creator, Juok, wanders over
the world creating men out of earths of different colors. In the land of
the Shilluks, in East Africa, he found black earth and shaped black men
from it; while in Egypt he shaped dark brown men out of the mud of
the Nile; where he found yellow earth he fashioned yellow men, and
wherever he found white earth, he made white men. The Chaldean
historian, Berosus, recorded that the great god Bel decapitated himself
and that the other gods mixed his blood with clay and out of it molded
the first man. In Greek mythology, Prometheus is pictured as manu
facturing the first men from clay at Panopeus.
The myths of the Fall are based on the attempts of primitive man to
explain the origin of death. Due to the habit of certain species of snakes
of periodically shedding their skins, our savage forerunners got the idea
that serpents were immortal; so the natural vanity of man persuaded
our distant ancestors that the gods had intended the gift of eternal life
for humanity alone, and that the crafty reptile had stolen this precious
prize from the human race. The Biblical version of the Fall of Man is
incomplete. The role of the serpent is not explained, and the Tree of
Life is not given due prominence in the story. The original narrative,
which we are able to piece together from the mythology of many
lands, reads somewhat as follows: God placed the first man and woman
in a delightful garden, and in this garden were two trees: the Tree of Life and the Tree of Death (the Biblical Tree of Knowledge). The
first human couple had the choice of eating of the fruit of the Tree of
Life and of becoming immortal, or of partaking of the fruit of the Tree



MYTHS AND MYSTKR1KS: PAGAN AND CHRIS! IAN 119
of Dearh and, hence, becoming mortal. The serpent was sent by God
to tell Adam and Eve to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life so that they
might live forever; and to warn them against tasting the fruit of the
Tree of Death for, should they dine on this forbidden fruit they would
surely die, and the curse of mortality would descend to their children
from generation to generation. The wily reptile, however, reversed the
message and told the first human pair that they would obtain immortal
ity by eating of the fruit of the Tree of Death. Unfortunately, Adam
and Eve believed the message of the diabolical snake, and ate the for
bidden fruit. As a consequence, they were expelled from Eden and, at
the same time, became mortal. The old serpent, on the other hand,
helped himself to the fruit of the Tree of Life and, hence, gained im
mortality for himself and for his kind. Myths told by savages to explain
the origin of death are of three types: (1) the story of the Perverted
Message; (2) the story of the Cast Skin; (3) the composite story of the
Perverted Message and the Cast Skin.
In the southern part of Africa, the Hottentots connect the phases of
the moon with the idea of immortality. They consider the rising of the
moon as its birth and the setting of the lunar orb as its death. After each
death, there is a new birth, the waxing moon manifesting growth, and
its waning, decay. In days of old, say the Hottentot mythologists, the
moon desired to confer the boon of immortality on the race of man,
and the hare volunteered to bring the glad tidings to earth. So the
moon god instructed the hare to deliver the following message to man
kind: "As I die and rise to life again, so shall you die and rise to life
again.
The hare made the journey, but on account of a bad memory, or just
plain cussedness, he reversed the message, saying: "As I die and do not
rise to life again, so you also shall die and not rise to life again." When
the moon learned of the hare's error, he became angry and threw a
stick at him. The stick struck the hare and split his lip and that is why,
to this day, the hare is afflicted with a cloven lip. By garbling the
moon's message, the hare robbed man of the gift of immortality, and
the Hottentots are still angry with him for that reason. As a result,
when a youth of the tribe comes of age and assumes his station among
men, he is forbidden to partake of the flesh of the hare.
Among the Nandi of East Africa, a popular myth relates the origin
of death to the mean disposition of a certain dog. In the time of the first
men, a dog trotted up one day and delivered the following message:
"All people will die like the moon but, unlike the moon, you will not



120 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
return to life again unless you give me some milk to drink out of your
gourd, and beer to drink through your straw. If you do this, I will ar
range for you to go to the river when you die, and to come to life again
on the third day." The first men laughed at the dog and gave him some
milk and beer to drink off a stool. The dog, angered at not being served
the drink in the same vessels as his human contemporaries, then an
nounced: "All people will die, and the moon alone will return to life."
So the ill-tempered dog, presumably the messenger of the moon,
doomed the human race to mortality.
In some of the myths of the origin of death, two messengers are in
volved. Such a tale is told among the Masarwas, who dwell in Bot
swana, the Kalahari Desert, and parts of Southern Rhodesia. In the
olden days, the moon wished to send a message to men. The moon
called the tortoise and said to him: "Go over to those men there, and
give them this message from me. Tell them that, as 1 dying live, so they
dying will live again." But the tortoise, besides being a slow traveler,
had a bad memory, so the moon lost patience with him and summoned
the hare. To the hare, the moon said: "You are a swift runner. Take
this message to the men over yonder: \As 1 dying live again, so you
dying will live again/ " But the hare was also afflicted with a defective
memory. She tore off with great celerity and promptly forgot the mes
sage. On reaching the vicinity of the men, the hare delivered the
moon's message thusly: "As 1 dying live again, so you dying will die
forever." Eventually, the tortoise arrived, and, despite his bad memory,
delivered the right message; but alas, he was too late.
Stories of the perverted message are quite common in the simpler
cultures of Africa, and are based on a widespread belief that the gods
intended to make man immortal, but the benevolent plan came to
naught due to error or malice on the part of the messenger chosen to
deliver the good news. Many savage tribesmen, in both the eastern and
western hemispheres, regard lizards, serpents, and beetles as immortal.
They observe that these animals periodically cast their skins and natu
rally infer that the same animals renew their youth perpetually, and
hence never die. So myths were framed to explain how certain animals
attained immortality, and why men lost, or failed to gain, life everlast
ing.
The Wafipa or Wabende of East Africa tell of how God visited the
earth and asked the following questions of all living creatures: "Who
wishes not to die?" Man and all the other animals, except the serpent,
were asleep. The serpent promptly answered, "I do"; so that is why



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 121
man and the other animals die and the snake does not. The belief is that
the serpent expires only when he is killed; for every year he changes
his skin and, hence, renews his youth endlessly. We have been told by
the Arawaks of British Guiana that the creator once came down to the
world to see how mankind was getting along, but men were so evil that
they tried to kill the creator. Hence they were denied the gift of eter
nal life, which was, instead, conferred on those animals which renew
their skins, such as snakes, lizards, and beetles.
The belief among primitive men is widespread that, in the early days
of the world, men were immortal because they possessed the ability to
periodically cast their skins. Among other aborigines, the belief in im
mortality has been traced to the doctrine of lunar sympathy; for it was
thought that men passed through states of growth and decay, and of life
and death, corresponding in a sense to the phases of the moon. Men
died but were thought after three days to arise from the grave to a new
life, this belief being based on the three-day interval between disap
pearance of the old moon and the appearance of the new one. In a
myth current among the Caroline Islanders, we learn that men in the
good old days did not die; or, more precisely, although they did die, on
the last day of the waning moon, they again came to life on the appear
ance of the waxing moon; but an evil spirit intervened and so arranged
things that, when men died, they remained dead. A similar story is
popularly related among the Upotos of the Congo, who believe that one day Libanza (God) summoned the people of the moon and the
earth to a conference. The moon people showed up on time, whereas
the earth dwellers arrived very late. So Libanza, addressing the inhabit
ants of the moon, said: "Because thou came to me at once, when I
called thee, thou shalt never die. Thou shalt be dead for but two days
each month and that only to rest thee; and thou shalt return with
greater splendor." When the tardy earthlings finally arrived, Libanza
became angry and said to them: "Because you came not at once to me
when I called you, therefore, you will die one day and not revive ex
cept to come to me." In some primitive myths concerning the origin of death, there is a
blend of the stories of the perverted message and the cast skin. Such a tale is told in Annam, where a legendary god named Ngoc sent a cour
ier from heaven to tell men that when they became old they should
change their skins and live forever, but that serpents on growing old
would die. When the heaven-sent messenger arrived on earth, he an
nounced: "When man is old, he shall cast his skin; but when serpents



") 7 MAN, COD, AND CIVILIZATION
arc old they shall die and be laid in coffins. " A nearby brood of snakes
first heard the announcement and threatened the messenger with vio
lence. "You must say it over again, " the reptiles insisted, "and just the
contrary or we will bite you." The frightened courier restated his mes
sage as follows: "When the serpent is old, he shall cast his skin; but
when man is old, he shall die and be laid in the coffin." And that is why
all animals die except the serpent, who, when old, casts his skin and
lives forever.
Among the Gallas of East Africa, there dwells a bird called the Hala
waka (the Sheep of God). This bird is recognized by its dark blue or
black color, with a white patch on each wing and a crest on its head. It
perches in treetops and emits wailing sounds somewhat like the bleat
ing of sheep. In days of old, we are told, God sent this bird to tell men
that they should not die; but that on growing old they would slip off
their old skins and renew their youth. And God even gave the bird a
crest to serve as a badge identifying him as a heavenly ambassador. The
bird started on his journey, but on the way observed a snake dining on
carrion. Stopping, the avian addressed the reptile: "Give me some of
the meat and blood and 1 will tell you God's message.' 1
The snake replied, "I don't want to hear it." But the bird was insist
ent, and the serpent reluctantly agreed to his proposition.
"The message is this," the reptile was told. "When men grow old
they will die, but when you grow old, you will cast your skin and
renew your youth." And that is why men and women grow old and
die, and serpents crawl out of their old skins and enjov a renewal of
life.
The myths of the origin of death have their greatest concentration in
the continent of Africa, and it is the opinion of Sir J. G. Frazer that the
Hebrew version of the myth was probably of African origin.
Even if the story should hereafter be found in a Sumerian version [Frazer
held], this would not absolutely exclude the hypothesis of its African origin,
since the original home of the Sumerians is unknown. . . . In favor of an
African origin of the myth, it may be observed that the explanation of the
supposed immortality of serpents, which probably formed the kernel of the
story in its original form, has been preserved in several African versions,
while it has been wholly lost in the Hebrew version; from which it is natu
ral to infer that the African versions are older and nearer to the original
than the corresponding but incomplete narrative in Genesis. (91, pp. 223
24)



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 123
The New Testament of the Christian Bible contains the alleged bi
ography of a virgin-born savior of the human race. The Christians, in
this case, as in many others, were anticipated by the pagans; for virgin
born gods who sacrificed themselves for the good of the race were quite
common in the myths and legends of the heathen nations of antiquity.
The Reverend Charles H. Vail, in a scholarly study, The World's Sav
iors, records the stories of miraculous births of fifteen other saviors, who
lived before the Christian era. The names of these world's saviors are
Krishna of India, Gautama of India, Horus of Egypt, Tammuz of
Babylonia, Mithra of Persia, Zoroaster of Persia, Quetzalcoatl of Mex
ico, Bacab of Yucatan, Huetzilopochtli of Mexico, Freyr of Scandina
via, Attis of Phrygia, Bacchus of Greece, Adonis of Syria, Yu of
China, Jesus.
"The belief in miraculous births was common to antiquity," the
Reverend Vail noted. "Nearly every nation had a festival at or near the
25th of December in honor of the birth of a Divine Being. These incar
nations were generally referred to as immaculate conceptions and the
persons thus born were called saviors. The advent of the saviors here
mentioned preceded the Christian Era, some of them by thousands of
years." (255, p. 33)
Gods and heroes, born of virgins, were quite common in olden
times, and the source of most, if not all of these divinities, seems to have
been Egypt. Rhys has an instructive discourse on this fact:
Horus was said to be the parthenogenetic child of the Virgin Mother,
Isis. In the catacombs of Rome, black statues of this Egyptian divine
Mother and Infant still survive from the early Christian worship of the Vir
gin and Child to which they were converted. In these the Virgin Mary is
represented as a black Negress and often, with the face veiled in the true
Isis fashion. . . . Statues of the goddess Isis with the child Horus in her
arms were common in Egypt, and were exported to all neighboring and to
many remote countries, where they are still to be found with new names
attached to them —Christian in Europe, Buddhist in Turkestan, Taoist in
China and Japan. Figures of the Virgin Isis do duty as representations of Mary, of Hariti, of Kuan-Yin, of Kwannon, and of other Virgin Mothers
of Gods. (206, pp. 115-16)
The birth of the sun was personified in ancient Egypt as Horus, the
son of Osiris and Isis, the god of light and the savior of the world. On
the inner walls of the holy of holies in the temple of Luxor, inscribed
about two thousand years B.C. by King Amenhotep III, the birth of



124 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Horus is pictured in four scenes, strikingly like the Christian represen
tations of the Annunciation and the Immaculate Conception of the
Virgin Mary and the Birth and Adoration of the Christ Child. These
four consecutive scenes as engraved on the walls of the temple of Luxor
are reproduced in Gerald Massey's Ancient Egypt (163, Vol. II, p.
757), and may be described as follows:
1. The Annunciation: The god Thoth is shown announcing to the
virgin the fact that she is about to give birth to a son.
2. The Immaculate Conception: The god Kneph (the Holy Spirit)
and the goddess Hathor are shown mystically impregnating the virgin
by holding crosses (the symbol of life) to the head and nostrils of the
mother-to-be.
3. The Birth of the Child God: The mother is seated on the mid
wife's stool and the newborn infant is held by attendants.
4. The Adoration: The infant Horus is displayed as receiving hom
age from gods and men, including the three kings or magi who are ten
dering him gifts. In this scene, the symbol of the cross again appears.
"In this picture," the Egyptologist, Samuel Sharpe, noticed, "we
have the Annunciation, the Conception, the Birth and the Adoration as
described in the first and second chapters of Luke's Gospel; and as we
have historical assurance that the chapters in Matthew's Gospel which
contain the miraculous birth of Christ are after additions not in the ear
liest manuscripts, it seems probable that these two poetical chapters in
Luke may also be unhistorical and borrowed from the Egyptian ac
counts of the miraculous births of their kings." (225, p. 19)
Herodotus has transmitted to us an account of a festival that was cel
ebrated annually in ancient Egypt to commemorate the descent into
Hades of King Rhampsinitus and his return from the underworld back
to earth. A feature of this ritual, which was apparently connected with
the Osirian cult, was the enveloping of a priest in a shroud by two
other priests, disguised as wolves. The two wolflike characters con
ducted the shrouded one to a temple of Isis outside the city and there
left him. The two priests in wolves' clothing, who represented the two
divine guides of the dead, later returned and led the priest in the
shroud, who enacted the role of King Rhampsinitus, back to the city.
On his return, the mantled priest brought with him a napkin, suppos
edly given to him by the goddess Isis in Hades. It seems that incidents
from this Egyptian ceremony were incorporated into the Gospel of
Saint John, for we read there of visitors to the tomb of Jesus beholding
a napkin and a shroud. They also saw two celestial beings (angels).



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 125
A learned scholar from Scotland, Arthur Findlay, published in 1939
an unusual book with the title The Psychic Stream: The Source and
Growth of the Christian Faith. It is a large book, 1,200 pages in all, but
the reading of it is easy, despite the length. Findlay devotes considera
ble space to what he calls the Savior-God Religions, and he asserts: "At
least thirty savior-gods are known to history who were believed by
their followers to have suffered death as a sacrifice for sin and who
were elevated by them to be god-men on earth and saviors and media
tors in heaven." (79, p. 305) Out of the thirty savior-gods, Arthur
Findlay selected the five which he considered to be the most important
of the lot for extensive discussion. The names of these ancient gods are
Bel of Babylonia, Osiris of Egypt, Prometheus of Greece, Mithra of
Persia, Krishna of India.
The story of the savior-god Bel of Babylonia is of great value to stu
dents of comparative religion, for here we have a documentary source
of unquestioned authenticity in the form of an ancient cuneiform tab
let, now in the British Museum. Findlay secured an English translation
of this ancient record, which we will shortly reproduce.
The beliefs surrounding Bel [Findlay declares] were similar to those
which came, at a later date, to surround Jesus. This we know because there has been discovered engraved on baked clay the program of the drama of
the arrest, trial, death and resurrection of Bel which was in use at the time when Bel was worshipped in Babylon. This clay tablet is accepted by Bab
ylonian scholars as the program used by the priests at the drama depicting
the death scenes of the life of Bel. Its discovery was made by Professor
Zimmern and this is of comparatively recent date. When I called to discuss
it with the curator of the Babylonian Section of the British Museum, I
found that the translation I shall give is accepted as a list of parallel instances
found both in the story of Bel and of the Christ. Zimmern deduced the inci
dents of the story of Bel from ritual texts which seem to describe a primi
tive kind of religious play. . . . The tablet is believed to have been pro
duced about two thousand years before the Christian era, and it was
evidently used by the priest who acted as the announcer at the drama. He would have the tablet before him and before each scene would announce
what was about to take place. (79, pp. 220-21)
The English translation of the cuneiform record referred to above is
reproduced here: (1) Bel is taken prisoner; (2) Bel is tried in the Hall
of Justice; (3) Bel is smitten; (4) Bel is led away to the mount; (5) with
Bel are taken two malefactors, one of whom is released; (6) after Bel
has gone to the mount the city breaks out into tumult; (7) Bel's clothes



126 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
arc carried away; (8) Bel goes down into the mount and disappears
from life; (9) a weeping woman seeks him at the gate of burial; (10)
Bel is brought back to life.
We can look backward four thousand years and picture what hap
pened among the Bel worshipers of Babylon. In Findlay's words: "We
can imagine them sitting in a great amphitheater, such a one as was so
common in those days. The stage was before them and its roof was the
dome of heaven. Thousands of people could thus be accommodated
and, from the program, it is evident that it was situated on the side of a
small hill. It was in all probability built at the foot of one of the slopes
of this hill, which curved inwards. On the top of the hill may have been
a grove." (79, p. 223)
Before the multitude assembled at the theater, the actors took their
places on the stage. The service would be started by the singing of a
psalm similar to the Psalms of David in the Old Testament. Following
one or more psalms, a priest would recite the appropriate prayer for the
occasion. Then the announcer, holding a copy of the program, would
arise and read out in a loud clear voice: "Scene 1 —Bel is taken pris
oner."
An actor representing Bel, the Babylonian Christ, was seen on the
stage. Other actors dressed as soldiers would arrest the savior-god. As
the prisoner was led away by the squad of soldiers, the announcer again
rose up and called out: "Scene II — Bel is tried in the Hall of Justice."
At this point the scene of a trial was enacted. A judge was present,
and witnesses .testified for and against the prisoner, who was found in
nocent but sentenced to death anyway as in the similar case of Jesus in
the Gospels. After the sentencing of the victim, the next scene was
called out: "Scene III — Bel is smitten."
This scene showed the jeering at and the baiting of the prisoner after
the sentence of death had been passed. The next announcement would
be: "Scene IV —Bel is led away to the mount."
The actor impersonating the victim was led away by guards to the
sacred grove atop the hill. Then the announcing priest read: "Scene
V —With Bel are taken two malefactors, one of whom is released."
Actors representing the two criminals were seen on the stage and,
after a trial, one was found guilty, the other innocent. The guilty vic
tim was condemned to death and the innocent one released.
Although the death scene of savior Bel was a part of the Babylonian
Mysteries, this was not shown in the amphitheater. This fact is ex
plained by Arthur Findlay as follows:



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 127
The program does not contain a scene of the god's death. This may be because it took place on a hill where he was hung on one of the trees in the
sacred grove, or crucified, or slain on an altar, and so could not be enacted
on the stage. By now, the theater is empty and everyone has climbed to the
top of the hill to witness the death scene. As the actor, taking the place of
Bel, and the one representing the malefactor, are not actually killed, it may
be that the death the savior-god actually suffered was not enacted. This is
unlikely and it is more probable that the tablet which has been found referred only to the performance in the amphitheater, which accounts for the death scene not being included thereon. They were heavy to carry and would not be brought away from the theater. After the scene, when the
two malefactors appeared and one was sent after Bel to be sacrificed, the
people would know that, for the time being, the performance in the theater was over. For that reason, and because the death scene was not taking place
in the theater, it is not engraved on the tablet. (79, p. 227)
After the death scene, the audience would return to the theater and
the announcer would declare: "Scene VI —After Bel has gone to the
mount, the city breaks into tumult."
In this scene the disorderly mob was shown rioting and screaming to
exemplify the tumult that took place in the city.
The next scene was then announced: "Scene VII —Bel's clothes are
carried away."
In this scene Bel's body had been returned from the mount and was
seen on the stage by the multitude. His clothes were removed and his
corpse was prepared for burial. The priest then announced the next
act: "Scene VIII—Bel goes down into the mount and disappears from
life."
The stage being near the side of a hill, a tomb was dug and the body
of Bel was placed therein. The priest officiating at the funeral would
deliver the appropriate eulogy of the dead god. The announcement of
the subsequent scene would be: "Scene IX—A weeping woman seeks
him at the gate of burial." The weeping woman, perhaps the mother, wife, or lover of the dead
savior, added a dramatic touch to this ancient mystery play. Then fol
lowed the climax, when the announcer read: "Scene X — Bel is brought
back to life."
The moving story of what happened in the last act of the Babylonian
Passion Play and its effect on later religions has been vividly recon
structed by Arthur Findlay:
We can imagine the enthusiasm and excitement this announcement would cause. The people rise and there is thunderous noise and shouting.



128 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Then comes a hush and they reseat themselves awaiting in eager expect
ancy the denouement of this great drama. During the silence, the stone
which has been pushed up against the tomb is seen to move and slowly it is
pushed aside. Out of it comes Bel in his burial clothes. As he emerges from
the tomb, the audience rises and shouts in its frenzy till all are hoarse. The
great drama has reached its climax. Their god has re-appeared to them,
death has been conquered, and he has secured for all life in the hereafter. As
the actor could not re-appear as a spirit as did Bel after his sacrifice, the re
appearance had to be a physical one, just as the Christian drama depicts
Jesus having left the tomb as a human being. . . . This great religious serv
ice has never been forgotten. It was copied by the Greeks and is still per
formed in memory of Christ. It has been preserved for us throughout the
Christian era in the Four Gospels. The Christian dramatist made such
changes in the details as were required so that people should believe that it
was an historical event which happened in Jerusalem and that the actors
were those who were believed to have been the disciples of Jesus. (79, pp. 230-31)
We have already discussed the myths and rites of Osiris, but Findlay
has brought to our attention certain facts not discussed at length by the
standard authorities on the history and religion of ancient Egypt.
The Pharaoh Seti I (1450-1395 B.C.), first ruler of the 19th Dy
nasty, caused to be erected at Abydos a fine temple dedicated to the
worship of Osiris. This impressive structure, still standing, contains
chapels, halls, and seven principal sanctuaries. The walls are embel
lished with reliefs in color and are fine examples of the Egyptian sculp
tor's art. Directly behind this temple is situated the Osireon, a large sub
terranean hall, reachable by an underground passage. This under
ground structure was carved out of sandstone, and the roof is supported
by large granite piers. This hall contained an artificial island in the
midst of a body of water. On the island was a hill upon which the sun
god was imagined to stand and who, at sunrise, touched the land with
his life-giving beams. This hill symbolized the resurrection with the
rising sun overcoming the devil of darkness and hence symbolizing the
victory of life over death. Beyond this hall may be seen a sarcophagus,
known as the false tomb. This tomb was originally supposed to be the
burial site of Osiris, but the initiates of Egyptian Mysteries knew that
the body had been interred elsewhere. In the ancient passion play were
scenes of the arrest, trial, death, burial, and resurrection of Osiris. In
one scene the onlookers would observe the body, supposedly that of
Osiris, being buried in the tomb. The next act showed the opening of



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 129
the tomb, which was seen to be empty. The next, and final, scene
showed Osiris again alive, following his resurrection from the dead. In
ancient Egypt, there were two bodies of religious doctrines: the exo
teric, known to the common people, and the esoteric, which was known
only to the sacerdotal caste. The meaning of {he false tomb has been so
well explained by Findlay that we give it in his own words:
So that the people could realize that Osiris had conquered the grave, it
was necessary for the tomb to be empty. It was the only way to impress
them with the fact that the Lord had risen. It was impossible for the audi
ence to see, lying in the tomb, the dead body of Osiris and his spirit-body
standing beside it. So the only way this event could be dramatized was by showing the tomb as empty. This symbolism conveyed to the people the
idea of resurrection from the dead, and it was perpetuated, when this tem
ple was erected, by the empty rock tomb in which it was assumed that the
body of Osiris had been laid. It was there no longer because he had con
quered the grave. We can now understand the mystery of the empty tomb related in the Gospel narratives. The writers made use of the Egyptian symbolism taken
from their passion play and told the story just as it happened on the stage, of
the corpse being put into a rock tomb and not being there when the disci
ples visited the grave. . . . Now that we know that the Gospel record of the empty tomb was probably taken from the Egyptian passion drama, all
our difficulties disappear and what appears to be absurd and impossible be
comes understandable. (79, p. 248)
Another great Pagan Christ was Krishna of India; for it is recorded
in the sacred books of India that Krishna was born of the virgin Devaki;
that his nativity was heralded by a star; and that, though of royal line
age, he was born in a cave.
According to the Apocryphal Gospel, "Protevangelion," a work at
tributed to James, the brother of Jesus, the Christian savior was also
born in a cave.
At the time of Krishna's birth, the cave was mysteriously illumi
nated. Likewise, at the birth of Jesus, there was such a great light in the
cave that the eyes of Joseph and the midwife could not bear it. ("Prote
vangelion," Chapter XIV, Verse 11. See 3, p. 35.)
The infant Krishna spoke to his mother immediately after his birth.
"Jesus spake even when he was in the cradle, and said to his mother:
'Mary, 1 am Jesus, the Son of God, that Word which thou didst bring
forth according to the declaration of the Angel Gabriel to thee, and my
Father hath sent me for the salvation of the world.' " ("The First Gos

pel of the Infancy," Chapter I, Verses 2 and 3. This Gospel is also in The Apocryphal New Testament [3].)
Krishna was born while his foster father, Nanda, was in the city to
pay his tax to the king.
Jesus was born while his foster father, Joseph, was in the city to pay
his tax to the governor.
King Kansa sought the life of the Indian Christ by ordering the mas
sacre of all male children born during the same night as was Krishna.
This is a parallel to the story of the slaughter of the innocents or
dered by King Herod as recounted in the Gospel according to Mat
thew, II, 16.
Nanda was warned by a heavenly voice to flee with the infant
Krishna across the Jumna River in order to escape from King Kansa.
Joseph was warned by a voice in a dream to flee into Egypt with the
Christ-child so as to escape from King Herod. In the city Mathura, which was his birthplace, Krishna performed
many miracles.
Jesus, while in Egypt, lived in Matarea, a town near Hermopolis,
and while residing there wrought numerous miracles.
Krishna was the second person of the Hindu Trinity, which consisted of (1) Brahma, (2) Vishnu, and (3) Siva. Krishna was the human
incarnation of Vishnu.
Jesus Christ is considered to be the second person of the Christian
Trinity, according to the Bible.
Krishna is said to have been a crucified Christ. He is pictured in In
dian art as hanging on a cross with arms extended. Dr. Thomas Inman
states: ''Krishna, whose history so closely resembles our Lord's, was
also like him in his being crucified." (Ancient Faiths, Vol. I, p. 41 1, by Thomas Inman, M.D., cited by T. W. Doane in 69, p. 186) Krishna, while hanging on the cross, was pierced by an arrow.
During his crucifixion, Jesus was pierced by a spear.
The light of the sun was blotted out at noon on the day of Krishna's
death.
The sun is said to have been darkened from the sixth to the ninth
hour on the day of the crucifixion of Christ. This darkness of the Pas
sion of Christ called forth a commentary from the historian Edward Gibbon that has become famous, and we append it below for the
thoughtful consideration of the reader:
But how shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and philo
sophic world to those evidences which were presented by the hand of Om

nipotence, not ro their reason, but to their senses? During the age of Christ,
of his apostles, and of their first disciples, the doctrine which they preached
was confirmed by innumerable prodigies. The lame walked, the blind saw,
the sick were healed, the dead were raised, demons were expelled, and the
laws of Nature were frequently suspended for the benefit of the church.
But the sages of Greece and Rome turned aside from the awful spectacle
and, pursuing the ordinary occupations of life and study, appeared uncon
scious of any alteration in the moral or physical government of the world.
Under the reign of Tiberius, the whole earth, or at least a celebrated prov
ince of the Roman Empire, was involved in a preternatural darkness of
three hours. Even this miraculous event, which ought to have excited the
wonder, the curiosity, and the devotion of mankind, passed without notice
in an age of science and history. It happened during the life time of Seneca
and the elder Pliny, who must have experienced the immediate effects or
received the earliest intelligence of the prodigy. Each of these philosophers
in a laborious work, has recorded all of the great phenomena of nature,
earthquakes, meteors, comets and eclipses, which his indefatigable curiosity
could collect. Both the one and the other have omitted to mention the
greatest phenomenon to which the mortal eye has been witness since the
creation of the globe. A distinct chapter of Pliny is designed for eclipses of
an extraordinary nature and duration; but he contents himself with describ
ing the singular defect of light which followed the murder of Caesar, when,
during the greatest part of a year, the orb of the sun appeared pale and
without splendor. This season of obscurity, which cannot surely be com
pared with the preternatural darkness of the Passion, had been already cele
brated by most of the poets and historians of that memorable age. (97, pp. 200-2)
Krishna descended into hell to raise the dead before returning to the
abode of the gods; and on his return from the infernal regions he
brought with him two boys, whom he restored to their parents on
earth.
In the New Testament Apocrypha, we read of Jesus Christ descend
ing into hell and leading back to earth a parry of saints, among them
two sons of the High Priest whom the Christ restored to life on earth.
For derails of the story of the Descent into Hell of Jesus Christ, the in
terested reader is referred to the apocryphal "Gospel of Nicodemus."
It is related of Krishna that he rose from the grave and ascended
bodily to the celestial realms in the presence of a multitude of specta
tors.
A similar story is told concerning Jesus Christ in the New Testa
ment.

In Indian art, Krishna is depicted as a man of black complexion, and
the name Krishna literally means the black.
In early Christian art, Jesus is almost invariably represented as black
skinned. "In the pictures and portraits of Christ by the early Chris
tians," Kersey Graves asserted, "he is uniformly represented as being
black. And to make this the more certain, the red tinge is given to the
lips; and the only text in the Christian Bible, quoted by orthodox
Christians as describing his complexion, represents it as being black.
Solomon's declaration i am black, but comely, Oh ye daughters of Je
rusalem' (Solomon, I, 5), is often cited as referring to Christ. Ac
cording to the Bible itself, then, Jesus Christ was a black man." (101, p.
56) In discussing the black complexion of Krishna, John M. Robertson
noticed, "He thus in the first place comes into line with the black
deities of other faiths, notably the Osiris of Egypt, to say nothing of the
black manifestations of Greek deities and of the Christian Jesus." (208,
p. 146) Robertson then posed the question: "Why, then, is Krishna, in
particular, black?" and gave the following answer:
A reasonable presumption is that he was a demon for the Aryan invaders, as
being a god of the aborigines, who figure generally on the side of the Krish
nas or black demons. Again, if Dr. Frazer be right as to the priority of the
idea of a vegetation god in cults commonly associated with the sun, Krishna
may have been primarily such a god, and as thus associated with the earth,
may have been black—the explanation of Dr. Frazer for the blackness of Demeter and Osiris. Or, he may have been black merely as a god of the
black skinned natives. (208, p. 148)
Among the Christian nations of Europe, even unto our own times,
we notice the prevalence of statues and pictures of the black Christ.
Mithra, a Persian sun god, was virgin-born on December 25th. His
earliest worshipers were shepherds, and he was accompanied in his
travels by twelve companions. The Mithraists recognized a weekly
sabbath day and celebrated the Eucharist by eating wafers embellished
with a cross. The great Mithraic festivals were the Birth (Christmas)
and the Resurrection (Easter). During the Mithraic Easter rites, the
presiding priest announced: "Be of good cheer, sacred band of Initiates,
your god has risen from the dead." (Origine de Tous les Cultes by
Charles F. Dupuis, cited by W. Williamson in 276, p. 57)
When the cult of Mithra was in its prime, a magnificent festival was
celebrated annually atop Mount Orontes. This pomp and pageantry



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 133
were elegantly described by Lydia M. Child in a three-volume work,
The Progress of Religious Ideas Through Successive Ages:
Perhaps no religious festival was ever more splendid than the annual Sal
utation of Mithra, during which forty days were set apart for thanksgiving
and sacrifice. The procession to salute the god formed long before the rising
of the sun. The High Priest was followed by a long train of the Magi, in
spotless white robes, chanting hymns and carrying the sacred fire on silver
censers. Then came three hundred and sixty five youths in scarlet, to repre
sent the days of the year, and the color of fire. These were followed by the
Chariot of the Sun—empty, decorated with garlands, and drawn by superb white horses harnessed with pure gold. Then came a white horse of mag
nificent size, his forehead blazing with gems in honor of Mithra. Close be
hind him rode the king in a chariot of ivory inlaid with gold, followed by his royal kindred in embroidered garments and a long train of nobles, riding
on camels richly caparisoned. This gorgeous retinue, facing the east, slowly ascended Mount Orontes. Arrived at the summit, the High Priest assumed
his tiara, wreathed with myrtle, and hailed the first rays of the rising sun
with incense and prayer. The other Magi gradually joined him in singing
hymns to Ormuzd, the source of all blessing, by whom the radiant Mithra
had been sent to gladden the earth, and preserve the principle of life. Fi
nally, they all joined in one universal chorus of praise, while the king, prin
ces and nobles prostrated themselves before the orb of day. (45, Vol. I, pp. 272-73)
There are two principal types of savior gods recognized by hierolo
gists: vegetation gods and sun gods. The vegetation theory was bril
liantly presented by Sir James G. Frazer in The Golden Bough, and by
Grant Allen in The Evolution of the Idea of God. This viewpoint has been summarized by Dr. David Forsyth:
Many gods besides Christ have been supposed to die, be resurrected and
ascend to heaven. This idea has now been traced back to its origin among
primitive people in the annual death and resurrection of crops and plant life generally. This explains the world-wide prevalence of the notion. Among still more primitive tribes, as Grant Allen showed, it is not yet understood
that sown corn sprouts because of the spring sunshine and they attribute the
result to divine agency. To this end, they are accustomed at seed time to
kill their tribal god—either in human or animal form—and scatter the flesh
and the blood over the sown fields. They believe that the seeds will not
grow unless the god is sacrificed and added to them in this manner. When,
therefore, the crop appears, they never doubt that it is their god coming to
life again. It is from this erroneous belief of primitive tribes that Christian
ity today derives its belief in Christ's death and resurrection. (83, p. 97)



134 MAN, GOD, AM) CIVILIZATION
According ro rhe advocates of the solar myth theory, the ancient
crucified saviors were personifications of the sun; and their life stories
were allegories of the sun's passage through the twelve constellations of
the zodiac. The Roman scholar, Macrobius (fourth century), has been
called the father of rhe solar myth theory. In his famous work, Saturna
lia, he discussed the practice in pagan temples of representing the gods
at different ages; and he stated: "These differences of age refer to the
sun which seems to a babe at the Winter Solstice, as the Egyptians rep
resent him in their temples on a certain day; that being the shortest
day, he is then supposed to be small and an infant.
This theory was not original with Macrobius, who probably obtained it from the Egyptian priests who were accustomed to explain
their myths by means of the principles of astronomy. The solar theory
has been neglected in recent years, so we shall give it some attention.
In Egypt, three thousand years ago, the birthday of the sun god was
celebrated on the 25th of December, since it was the first day to no
ticeably lengthen after December 21st (the day of the Winter Sol
stice). At the midnight hour, on the very first minute of the 25th of
December, the birthday of the sun was commemorated. At that time,
the sun was in the zodiacal sign Capricorn, which was then known as
the Stable of Augeas; so the infant sun god was said to have been born
in a stable. Shining bnghrlv on rhe meridian was Sinus (the Star from
the East); while rising in the east was Virgo (the virgin), the line of the
horizon passing through her center. To the right of Sirius was Orion
(the great hunter), with three stars in his belt. These stars lie in a
straight line, and point at Sirius. In ancient times they were known as
the Three Kings. We meet them in the Gospels as the Three Wise Men,
or Magi. In rhe zodiac on the interior of rhe dome of the Temple of
Denderah, the constellation Virgo was pictured as a woman wirh a
spike of corn in one hand; and on the adjacent margin, the virgin is an
notated by a figure of his wirh Horns in her arms.

MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 135
of the birth of the Virgin is dated the 8th of September. At the present day,
the zodiacal signs (owing to precession) have shifted some distance from
the constellations of the same name. But at the time when the zodiac was
constituted and these names were given, the first date obviously would sig
nalize the actual disappearance of the cluster Virgo in the sun's rays—i.e.,
the Assumption of the Virgin into the glory of the God—while the second
date would signalize the re-appearance of the constellation, or the Birth of the Virgin. The Church of Notre Dame at Paris is supposed to be on the
original site of a Temple of Isis; and it is said (but I have not been able to
verify this myself), that one of the side entrance^—that, namely, on the left
in entering from the north (cloister) side—is figured with the signs of the
Zodiac, except that the sign Virgo is replaced by the figure of the Madonna
and Child. (41, pp. 32-3 3)
At the winter solstice (Christmas), the sun is at its southernmost
point in the celestial sphere. After that time, it begins to travel north
ward along the ecliptic; and then at the vernal equinox (Easter), it
passes over the celestial equator. This passing over of the sun from the
south to the north of the equator was the origin of the festival of the
Passover; for, when the sun reached the equinoctial point and crossed
or passed over the equator three thousand years ago, it was situated in
Aries, the Ram, or Lamb; so the lamb became the symbol of the god.
Here we have a clue to the origin of the Passover Lamb, which has
been widely regarded as a representation of the crucified Christ.
Should the reader consult such books as The World's Sixteen Crucified
Saviors by Kersey Graves (101), and Bible Myths and Their Parallels in
Other Religions by T. W. Doane (69), he will find the stories of sev
eral crucified pagan sun gods. The meaning of this solar crucifixion has
been explained in a scholarly fashion by L. G. Ry lands:
For in an astronomical chart, the sun is apparently crucified upon the in
tersecting lines of the Equator and the Ecliptic at the moment of his descent into the lower hemisphere, the hemisphere of darkness and death; and is so
again at the moment of his resurrection into the hemisphere of light and
life; while the period of transit is three days. At the time when the myth of
the death of the sun god originated, the sun, being in the constellation Aries
at the Spring Equinox, was identified with the Ram. That is the Lamb
which had been slain from the foundation of the world. The custom of dress
ing the paschal lamb in the shape of a cross is referrable to the same myth.
(218, p. 217)
In The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors, Kersey Graves gave a list of
these ancient savior gods with the dates of their reputed deaths. The list



136 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
is as follows: Krishna of India (1200 B.C.), Sakia of India (600 B.C.),
Tammuz of Syria (1160 B.C.), Wirroba of the Telingonese (522
B.C.), lao of Nepal (622 B.C.), Hesus of the Celtic Druids (834
B.C.), Quetzalcoatl of Mexico (587 B.C.), Quirinius of Rome (506
B.C.), Prometheus of Greece (547 B.C.), Thulis of Egypt (1700
B.C.), Indra of Tibet (725 B.C.), Alcestos of Greece (600 B.C.), Attis
of Phrygia (1 170 B.C.), Crite of Chaldea (1200 B.C.), Bali of Orissa
(725 B.C.), Mithra of Persia (600 B.C.).
Another book dealing with the careers of the ancient savior gods is
The World's Saviors by the Reverend Charles H. Vail (255). The Rev
erend Vail gives a list of twenty-three savior gods who died and arose
from the tomb. The names of these ancient gods, as given by the Rev
erend Vail, are Krishna, Wittoba, Indra, Bacab, Quetzalcoatl, Pro
metheus, Mithra, Bacchus or Dionysus, Baldur, Samheim or Bal-Sab,
Tien, Aesculapius, Marsyas, Artemes, Melkarth, Sandan, Hyacinth,
Marduk, Osiris, Tammuz or Adonis, Attis, Bel Merodach, Jesus.
For details concerning the list of ancient saviors named above, the
reader should consult 255, pp. 81-135.
Vegetation cults, it seems from the evidence at hand, are older than
the stellar, lunar, and solar cults, but were later merged with them. In
the primitive sacrifice rites of vegetation gods, the victim, it is believed,
was originally the king or chief of the tribe or clan; and it was thought
by ancient men that the prosperity of the group depended on the well
being of the ruler. If the king became old and feeble, his subjects con
cluded that the nation or tribe would suffer a similar decline; so the
king, who was regarded as a god in human form, was sacrificed and re
placed by a younger and more vigorous man. After much passage of
time, the son of the king was substituted in the sacrificial rite and,
being the offspring of divinity, he was called the son of the god. At a
still later period, a condemned criminal was chosen in the place of the
royal victim. This culprit was given regal honors for a time, then put to
death. He was generally slain, while bound to a sacred tree, with arms
outstretched in the form of a cross. After being entombed, he was be
lieved to rise from the dead within three days—the three-day period
representing the return of vegetation. The question naturally comes to
mind: Why three days? The answer is that the three-day period is
based on the three-day interval between the old and new moons. (See
85, p. 29.) The belief is still widespread among the superstitious that an
intimate connection exists between the phases of the moon and the
growth of crops.



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 137
The ancient Chaldean historian, Berosus, has recorded the details of
a religious festival celebrated annually by the Babylonians and known
as the Sacaea. The duration of the fete was five days. For that length of
time, servants and masters exchanged places in society, the servants
giving orders and the masters obeying them. The king temporarily ab
dicated the throne and a mock king, called Zoganes, reigned in his
stead. But after five days, the mock king was dethroned and scourged
and then either hanged or crucified. "The victims of the human sacri
fices," Weigall noted, "were generally crucified or else killed and then
hung on a tree until the evening. In this regard, it is interesting to notice
that in the Acts, the writer mistakenly speaks of Jesus as having been
slain and then hanged on a tree as though this were a common phrase
coming readily to his mind; and the word hanged is frequently used in
Greek to denote crucifixion." (263, pp. 77-78)
Stellar and solar symbolism have profoundly affected the Christian
religion. In the Apocalypse we read of the four beasts and the four
horsemen. Taken literally, the narrative is devoid of meaning, but
when we recognize the beasts as zodiacal constellations and the horse
men as planets, we get a much clearer conception of the matter. In
Revelation, Chapter IV, Verse 7, we read, "The first beast was like a
lion and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a
man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle." These symbolic ani
mals were the constellations situated at the four cardinal points of the
zodiac five thousand years ago. They were Taurus the Bull (Vernal
Equinox), Leo the Lion (Summer Solstice), Scorpio the Scorpion (Au
tumnal Equinox), and Aquarius the Waterman (Winter Solstice). The
reader will notice that, in the Bible, the Eagle has been substituted for
the Scorpion.
According to Godfrey Higgins, "The signs of the zodiac, with ex
ception of the Scorpion which was exchanged by Dan for the Eagle,
were carried by the different tribes of the Israelites on their standards
and Taurus, Leo, Aquarius and Scorpio, or the Eagle, the four signs of
Reuben, Judah, Ephraim and Dan, were placed at the four corners
the four cardinal points—of their encampment, evidently in allusion to
the cardinal points of the sphere, the equinoxes and solstices, when the
equinox was in Taurus." (119, Vol. II, p. 105) As to the four horsemen and their steeds, we note the following:
1. The first horseman is a conqueror armed with a bow and wearing
a crown, and riding a white horse. This is the planet Venus.



138 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
2. The second horse is of the color red, and astride it is a warrior
with a sword. This is the planet Mars.
3. The third horse is black and his rider holds aloft a pair of bal
ances. This is the planet Saturn.
4. The fourth horse is of a pale complexion, pale green or blue
green, and on his back rides Death. This is the planet Mercury.
The ancient Babylonians built their temples in seven stages, each of
a different color, representing the sun, the moon, and the five planets
visible to the naked eye. The lowest stage was black and was dedicated
to Saturn. Next was an orange stage for Jupiter, then a red stage for
Mars, a gold-plated stage for the sun, a white or yellow stage for
Venus, a blue-green stage for Mercury; and a silver-plated stage for the
moon. The colors of the four apocalyptic horses point to their origin in
the astrological lore of Babylonia. Many incidents of the Gospel stories
can be explained as astronomical myths. We read in the Bible of Satan
leading Jesus to the mountaintop. The Devil has been represented in
Jewish and Christian art and folklore in the form of a goat, and we see
Satan in medieval paintings with the hooves, horns, and tail of a goat.
The Greek god Pan was part goat, and is pictured as leading Zeus to
the mountaintop. In ancient Babylonia, the Goat was the emblem of the
zodiacal constellation Capricorn. The sun reached its lowest point in the
celestial sphere in that constellation, after which it began to climb to
ward its highest point. So the goat god was imagined to lead the sun
god toward the highest point in the sky, figuratively called the moun
taintop. In Greek mythology we read of the savior Dionysus riding
upon two asses, which later were changed into celestial constellations.
In the New Testament, Jesus is described as riding into Jerusalem
upon two asses; i.e., upon an ass and colt, the foal of an ass. (Matthew,
XXI, 5-7) In ancient Babylonia, the symbol of the zodiacal constella
tion Cancer, in which the sun reached the highest point of its apparent
path, was the Ass and Foal.
In the Biblical book of Genesis, Chapter XLIX, we find that the
twelve zodiacal constellations were assigned to Jacob. "Among the
early Jews," Professor Harding shows, "each of the constellations of
the zodiac seems to have been identified with one of the children of
Jacob." (113, p. 276) Jacob referred to Reuben as "boiling over as water." This identifies him with Aquarius. Simeon and Levi are called
"the brethren," the twin stars Castor and Pollux, in Gemini. Judah,
"the lion's whelp," is obviously Leo. Dan, described as "a serpent in



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 139
the way," is Scorpio. Napthali, "a hind let loose," is Capricorn. Gad is
Aries, leader of the flock, for, according to Jacob, "a troup shall press
upon him; but he shall press upon their heel." Asher was a weigher of
bread, and he became Libra, symbolized by a scale beam. Issachar, "a
strong ass crouching down between the sheep folds," has been equated
with Taurus. Zebulon, who "shall dwell at the beach of the sea," is
none other than Pisces. Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob, was as
signed to Virgo. Joseph, because "his bow abodes in strength," is the
archer, Sagittarius. Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob, became Can
cer. The sons of Jacob, as identified with the zodiacal constellation in
their proper order, were Gad (Aries), Issachar (Taurus), Simeon and
Levi (Gemini), Benjamin (Cancer), Judah (Leo), Dinah (Virgo),
Asher (Libra), Dan (Scorpio), Joseph (Sagittarius), Napthali (Capri
corn), Reuben (Aquarius), Zebulon (Pisces).
The signs and constellations of the zodiac were an integral part of an
ancient system of symbology of worldwide scope. They were not just
idle tales, conjured up by primitive storytellers.
We err in my opinion [states Sir D'Arcy W. Thompson] if we fail to
recognize in this antiquated symbolism a deeper intention. Cancer was domus Lunae, and the Crab is associated with the Moon of Consentia, Te
rina, etc., with the lunar Diana of the Ephesians, and with various other im
ages of the lunar goddess. Cancer was exaltatio Jovis, and the Crab was pe
culiarly associated with the Bird of Jove in the coinage of Agrigentum,
while the Aselli individual stars of the same constellation are mythologically
associated with the same god. . . . Cancer rose with Sirius and there are dog-headed representatives of both Mercury- A nubis and Luna-Hecate. Cancer is in the neighborhood of Corvus and Crater, and on coins of Mende the Ass is figured with the Raven and the Cup. Cancer rose opposite to Aguila and Delphinus which set soon afterwards, and moreover, set
precisely as the Dolphin rose; the Crab or the Ass is associated with the Eagle on the coins of Agrigentum and Motya, and with the Dolphin on the coins of Motya and Argolis. Cancer rose as Pegasus set, and the Crab is figured with the Horse on coins of Agrigentum. Cancer rose as the Southern Fish set, and the Crab and Ass are figured with the Fish on coins
of Agrigentum and Cyzicus. (Transactions of the Royal Society of Edin
burgh, Volume XXXIX)
Since the zodiacal symbolism looms so largely in the ancient myths and mysteries, we are emboldened to make a few remarks on the origin
and meaning of the world's oldest picture book. The zodiac is an imagi
nary band encircling the celestial sphere, and it stretches eight degrees



140 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
on each side of the ecliptic, whi^h is the apparent path of the sun. This
zodiac is divided into twelve equal sections, each corresponding to one
month. The zodiacal signs and constellations were originally the same,
but due to the precession of the equinoxes, each sign moves westward
into the next constellation in about 2,155 years. A sign, therefore,
makes a complete circuit of the heavens in about 26,000 years. The
constellations of the zodiac have the following names: Aries, the Ram
or Lamb; Taurus, the Bull; Gemini, the Twins; Cancer, the Crab; Leo,
the Lion; Virgo, the Virgin; Libra, the Balance; Scorpio, the Scorpion;
Sagittarius, the Archer; Capricorn, the Goat; Aquarius, the Water
Carrier; Pisces, the Fishes.
The following speculations on the origin of the celestial menagerie
are as accurate as available evidence affords. The constellations of the
Lamb, the Bull, and the Twins were star groups through which the sun
passed in the spring, in which time of the year occurred the seasons of
sheep raising, ploughing, and goat breeding. The Twins were origi
nally the two kids, since the young of goats are frequently born two at
a time. The Crab was so called because the sun reached its northern
most point in that constellation and then returned toward the south,
figuratively moving backward like a crab. The Lion was the star group through which the sun moved in midsummer, when its heat was most
potent, and hence was compared with the most powerful of the beasts.
The Virgin symbolized the harvest season when the young girls were
sent out to glean in the fields. The Balance was the constellation in
which the sun moved when day and night were equal, as if they were
weighed in a balance. The stars of the Scorpion were hidden by the
sun during the season of unhealthy weather and of plagues, which were
imagined to strike like a scorpion. Stars called the Archer reigned over
the hunting season, when the hunter shot game with bow and arrow.
In the constellation of the Goat, the sun reached the lowest point in its
course, after which it began to climb to the north again, as the wild
goat climbs to the summit of the hill. The Water Carrier marked the
position of the solar orb during the rainy season. The stars of the Fishes
constituted that star group through which the sun passed when the
fishing season was at its height.
The zodiacal constellations and signs discussed above were standard
ized by the ancient Greeks, but the Greek zodiac was not the most an
cient type of this stellar symbolism. There were older zodiacs known
to the Ethiopians, Egyptians, Babylonians, Hindus, Persians, Chinese,



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 141
etc., and the symbolic figures were different, as will be shown as we
proceed.
The Egyptian Sphinx, a colossal statue sacred to the sun god Horus,
was erected about six thousand years ago. It has the body of a lion
emblematic, no doubt, of the entrance of the sun into the zodiacal sign
of the Lion around 4000 B.C. The temple of the Sphinx was con
structed in the form of a cross and symbolizes North, South, East, and
West, the cardinal points of the celestial sphere: that is, the two sol
stices and the two equinoxes. It seems that originally there were only
four signs of the zodiac: the quarter signs at the cardinal points of the
sphere. George St. Clair, a talented student of astral mythologic lore
has made some illuminating comments on the original four signs of the
zodiac, from which we quote the following:
About 6000 years ago, the Spring Sun would be entering Taurus and the
four quarter signs would be the Bull, the Lion, the Scorpion and the Wat
erman, though some of these signs might be otherwise named. In memory
of that early arrangement—which in many ways left its mark—devices on
rings were, for example, a scorpion, a lion, a hawk, and a cynocephalus ape.
From the four quarters, we pass to the twelve signs. Between each two
quarter signs two other signs were inserted. The planisphere of the temple
of Denderah shows four gods supporting the heavens at the four quarter
points, corresponding to the Bull, the Lion, the Scorpion and the Water
man; and shows eight other divinities in pairs, one on either side of each pil
lar, making up the 12. (219, pp. 136-37)
The four gods holding up the heavens at the cardinal points of the
celestial sphere were the four sons of the sun god Horus, and their names were Amset, Hapi, Tuamutef, and Gebhsennuf These com
pass-point deities were easily recognized by their characteristic fea
tures: Amset had the head of a man, Hapi possessed the head of an ape,
Tuamutef was fitted out with the head of a jackal, Gebhsennuf bore on
his shoulders the head of a hawk.
The four gods holding up the skies are called Cherubim in the Bible.
"As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man and
the face of a lion, on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox
on the left side; they four had the face of an eagle." (Ezekiel, I, 10)
These celestial creatures were said to have been seen by Ezekiel in a vi
sion while in Babylon, and they were obviously the four corner con
stellations of the Chaldean zodiac. The Man was Aquarius, the Lion
was Leo, the Ox was Taurus, and the Eagle corresponded to Scorpio.



142 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
The Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Greeks believed in certain star gods,
called decans. These decans were actually belts of stars extending
across the sky, the risings of which followed each other by ten days.
Dr. Wilhelm Gundel of Geissen, a noted authority on ancient astron
omy, in 1937 wrote a monumental work treating of the decans and
their stars, with the title Dekane und Dekansternbilder, which was pub
lished by J. J. Augustin at Gluckstadt and Hamburg. The book was
not translated into English, but it was reviewed in the English scientific
journal Nature by an eminent naturalist. We are pleased to cite a pas
sage from that most informative review:
When the year (of 360 days) had been divided into its twelve months
and put under the zodiacal signs, each of the twelve was again divided into
three parts often days each; and these thirty-six decans had their thirty-six
gods or rulers or dynasts, watchers of the hours (horoscopes), servants or
messengers of the greater gods or of Horus himself in his holy name,
spelled with thirty-six letters; each had his own face, which might chance to
be (in Egypt), the face of a bull or of an ibis, or of an eagle, or of a man. These were the angels, and archangels, the demons and arch-demons of
Hellenistic writers. Each had his own name; in mummy cases and papyri,
in obscure and fragmentary works like Hermes Trismegistus, or the Testi
monium Salomonis, in Celsus and Firmicus, the traditionary learning of
men like Kircher, Salmasius or Scaliger, we find the names of Chont-har,
Chont-chre, Siket and the thirty-three others, and all kinds of variants and
corruptions. Egyptian they were in the beginning, but the true form and
meaning of many are long lost. (245)
The British Orientalist, Robert Brown, Jr., in his Researches into the
Origin of the Primitive Constellations of the Greeks, Phoenicians, and
Babylonians, argued for an Euphratean origin of the zodiac, but we be
lieve the Nile Valley has a better claim for that honor. In one of his
major works, Sir Wallis Budge made the incredible statement that,
"The Egyptians borrowed their knowledge of the signs of the zodiac
together with much else, from the Greeks, who had derived a great
deal of their astronomical lore from the Babylonians." (32, Vol. II, p.
312) This opinion, to put it mildly, was quite preposterous. A fitting
rejoinder was made by Dr. Albert Churchward:
Why the knowledge of all this was old in Egypt before the Babylonians
even existed or knew anything about it. The Egyptians had worked out all
the architecture of the heavens and their priests had carried the same with
them to all parts of the world—not only the Northern heavens but the



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 143
Southern, as well. Probably rhey worked out the South before the North,
and the Druids and the Mayas and the Incas knew it all from the priests of
Egypt, the earliest probably thousands of years before the Babylonian na
tion existed. The Babylonians copied and obtained all their knowledge from
the Egyptians, and we are surprised that Dr. Budge should write that they
borrowed from the Greeks; they were old and degenerating in decay be
fore the Greek nation was born! Well may he say that "it is a subject of
conjecture at what period the Babylonians first divided the heavens into
sections, etc.," because they never did; what they knew they borrowed ei
ther direct from the Egyptians or Sumerians—the latter obtained it from
Egypt. It was the ancient Egyptians who mapped out the heavens into 12
divisions in the North, 12 divisions in the South, and 12 in the center, mak
ing 36 in all, and the 12 signs of the zodiac. ... It is very well to say that
"whether the Babylonians were themselves the inventors of such origins
i.e. (the zodiac), or whether they are to be attributed to the earlier non-Se
mitic Sumerian inhabitants of that country, cannot be said,"—and when he
states that "the Greeks borrowed the zodiac from the Babylonians, and
then the Greeks introduced it into Egypt, probably during the Ptolemaic
period," it appears to us that Dr. Budge must have left that part of "The
Gods of the Egyptians" to be written by one of his assistants, who knew
nothing about the history of the past. (48, pp. 212-13)
In the Open Court magazine for August, 1906, there was a scholarly
article by the editor of that journal, Dr. Paul Cams, with the title "Zo
diacs of Different Nations." One illustration accompanying this article
displays Egyptian and Greek zodiacs side by side in the photograph of
a late Roman Egyptian plaque. The dual symbols are listed below:

An example of an earlier Egyptian type of zodiac was given by Ger
ald Massey in his famous book Ancient Egypt, from which we cite the
following passage:
Taking the same order in which the signs on the ecliptic are read today
when Aries has become Princeps Zodiaci, we can identify at least a dozen
of the deities of Egypt with the twelve signs.
1. The ram-headed AMEN with the Constellation ARIES 2. OSIRIS, the Bull of Eternity with TAURUS 3. The SUT-HORUS twins with the GEMINI 4. The beetle-headed KHEPER-PTAH with the sign of the BEETLE, later, CRAB
5. The lion-faced ATUM with LEO 6. The Virgin NEITH with the constellation VIRGO
7. HAR-MAKHU of the Scales with the sign of LIBRA
8. ISIS-SERKH, the scorpion goddess with the sign of SCORPIO
9. SHU and TEFNUT, figured as the Archer with the sign of SAG
ITTARIUS
10. NUM, the goat-headed, who presided over the abyss, with the sign
ofCAPRICORNUS
11. MEN AT, the divine wetnurse, with the sign of AQUARIUS
12. HORUS, of the two crocodiles, with the sign of PISCES. (163,
Vol. I, p. 302)
Many learned Christian scholars do not believe that Jesus had any
idea of starting a new religion or of establishing a church; they believe
that the real founder of Christianity was Saint Paul. And yet, we read
of Jesus referring to Peter as the rock on which the church was to be
built. Saint Peter was also popularly represented as the gatekeeper of
heaven. The name Peter comes from the Greek word Petra, which
means Rock. This may be a pseudonym, since he was also referred to as
Simon called Peter; that is to say, he may have been named Simon, and
was called the Rock because of some trait of character, just as General
Stonewall Jackson was so called because he stood up against the enemy
like a stone wall. It is interesting to note that there was a popular Se
mitic god named Simon and that the Egyptian god Petra was repre
sented as being the doorkeeper of heaven, the earth, and the under
world. In any case, as the stories of slain and resurrecting gods are
traced backward into the dim and distant past, we finally come to Af



MYTHS AND MYSTERIES: PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN 145
rica. One of the oldest religious celebrations of the ancient Egyptians
was the Sed Festival. Sir Flinders Petrie explained it as follows:
A special festival of the identity of the king with Osiris seems to have
been celebrated every thirty years, and a greater festival of the same nature every one hundred and twenty years. These periods are the lapse of a week
and a month in the shifting calendar. The festival was called the Sed or tail
feast, as marking the end of a period. From the various representations, it
has been gathered that at stated times, the king was killed to prevent his old
age impairing the fertility of the country, an African belief. (188, p. 41;
Vol. 1 1 of Herbert Spencer's Descriptive Sociology, published by Williams
and Norgate, London, 1925)
The earliest religion of Egypt has been traced back to central Africa:
The oldest structure of the people [again citing Petrie] was that which
resembled the African in beliefs and practices. There is a large body of cus
toms, especially those concerning the dead, which are closely alike in an
cient Egypt and modern Central Africa. In this stratum, probably preced
ing 10,000 B.C., animal worship was usual; so strong was the primitive
influence that this remained in practice down to the Roman age. The
source of this was a sense of kinship of men and animals. ("The Gods of Ancient Egypt," in 1 1 1, p. 667)
The same high authority, Sir Flinders Petrie, further asserted that
"the religion, like the population of Egypt, was always being mixed by
successive migrations of invaders. The old African ideas which under
lay it all still survive in Central Africa." (Ibid., p. 678)
In closing this chapter, we propose to discuss very briefly the my
thology connected with numbers. In a fascinating study, Amulets and
Talismans, Sir Wallis Budge has a chapter entitled "Theories About
Numbers and Their Mystic and Sacred Character." In gathering data
on the ancient myths and rites discussed in this chapter, we found that
the number forty seemed to be of considerable importance. However,
Budge did not find forty to be an important number. "Forty seems to
be nothing more than a round or general number," opined Dr. Budge,
and then he gave a few examples: "The Israelites ate manna 40 years
and wandered in the desert 40 years; Solomon, Jehoash and Joash each
reigned 40 years; Moses was on the mount 40 days, Jonah preached in Nineveh 40 days; our Lord fasted for 40 days and remained in the
tomb 40 hours, etc." (29, p. 440) The true significance of the number forty had been grasped by an



146 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
American scholar, Ernest Busenbark, we found. According ro this
careful investigator of ancient customs and myths:
At an extremely early date, a connection had doubtless been observed between the 28-day cycle of the moon and the menstrual cycle of women, and between changes of the moon and ocean tides. To people of the East, marriage and childbirth have always been the supreme duty and goal of
women, and the moon, who they believed controlled or regulated fecundity
and the generation of life, became known as the Great Regulator. Some
significances may also have been seen in the fact that the human foetus is
fully developed in 7 months, or the gestation of both women and cows takes
place in 280 days, or ten 28-day months. This period also represents 40 weeks, which may explain why, among ancient people, the number 40 is
habitually associated with periods of temptation, trial, hardship, and pain for
40 days, weeks, months, or years. For example, we have the 40 days and
nights of the Deluge, 40 years of wandering in the wilderness by the Israel
ites, 40 days and nights of fasting by Moses on Mt. Sinai; 40 days and
nights of Christ in the wilderness; 40 days between the resurrection of
Christ and his final disappearance from the earth; 40 days of mourning for the death of Jacob; 40 days of fasting by Elijah on Mount Horeb; 40 days in
which Ezekiel bore the iniquity of the House of Judah; 40 days of sacrifice
in the old Persian Salutation of Mithra; 40 nights of mourning in the Mysteries of Persephone; 40 days of mourning by the Babylonians before the
celebration of the festival of the Descent of Ishtar, which corresponds to the
Christian Lenten period of 40 days from Ash Wednesday to Easter. (38, pp. 18-19)
Many of the themes touched upon in this chapter call for further dis
cussion, and that will be undertaken in the chapters on the origin and
evolution of civilization.



CHAPTER EIGHT
The Twilight of the Gods
IT was mentioned in our chapter on the origin of magic and religion
that Sir James George Frazer has presented impressive evidence in his major work, The Golden Bough, that human thought in its long and ar
duous evolution has passed through three phases: the Age of Magic, the
Age of Religion, the Age of Science.
During the Age of Magic, men tried to bend the recalcitrant forces
of nature to their wills. In other words, they tried to coerce the natural
forces of the world. After much exercise of trial and error, over vast
stretches of time, the keener intellects became convinced that magic
was not adequate in practice or valid in theory. Then they imagined
supernatural beings behind the veil of nature who could be persuaded
to serve mankind if properly conciliated; and this outlook on the world
ushered in the Age of Religion. In time, the acutest thinkers among
humankind, by means of observation, experimentation and reason, ar
rived at the idea of natural law. The transition from the Age of Reli
gion to the Age of Science has been vividly portrayed by Frazer in ma
jestic prose tinged with poetry:
From one department of nature after another, the gods are reluctantly or
contemptuously dismissed, and their provinces committed to certain ab
stract ideas of ethers, atoms, molecules and so forth, which, though just as
imperceptible to human senses as their divine predecessors, are judged by
prevailing opinion to discharge their duties with greater regularity and dis
patch, and are, accordingly, firmly installed on the vacant thrones amid the
general applause of the more enlightened portion of mankind. Thus, instead
of being peopled with a noisy bustling crowd of full-blooded and pictur
esque deities, clothed in the graceful form and animated with the warm pas
sions of humanity, the universe outside the narrow circle of our conscious
ness is now conceived as absolutely silent, colorless and deserted. The
147



148 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
cheerful sounds which we hear, the bright hues which we see have no exist
ence, we are told, in the external world: the voices of friends, the harmonies
of music, the chime of falling waters, the solemn roll of ocean, the silver
splendor of the moon, the golden glories of sunset, the verdure of summer
woods, and the hectic tints of autumn—all these subsist only in our own
minds, and if we imagine them to have any reality elsewhere, we deceive
our selves. In fact, the whole external world as perceived by us is one great
illusion: if we gave the reins to fancy we might call it a mirage, a piece of
witchery, conjured up by the spells of some unknown magician to bewilder
poor ignorant humanity. Outside of ourselves, there stretches away on
every side an infinitude of space without sound, without light, without
color, a solitude traversed in every direction by an inconceivably complex
web of silent and impersonal forces. That, if I understand it aright, is the
general conception of the world which modern science has substituted for
polytheism.
When philosophy and science by their combined efforts have ejected
gods and goddesses from all the subordinate posts of nature, it might per
haps be expected that they would have no further occasion for the services
of a deity and that having relieved him of all his particular functions, they
would have arranged for the creation and general maintenance of the uni
verse without him by handing over these important offices to an efficient
staff of those ethers, atoms, corpuscles, and so forth, which had already
proved themselves so punctual in the discharge of the minor duties en
trusted to them. Nor, indeed, is this expectation altogether disappointed. A
number of atheistical philosophers have courageously come forward and as
sured us that the hypothesis of a deity as the creator and preserver of the
universe is quite superfluous and that all things came into being or have ex
isted from eternity without the help of any divine spirit, and that they will
continue to exist without it to the end, if end, indeed, there is to be. (88, pp.
213-14)
There has been considerable controversy in recent years as to
whether there is an inherent conflict between religion and science; and
there is a sizable literature on the subject. Perhaps the outstanding
work on the struggle between superstition and science is A History of
the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (270) by Professor
Andrew Dickson White, the first president of Cornell University. Re
ligion has held the allegiance of many members of the human race for
ages, because it promised mankind power over the outside world; but
this promise religion could not realize. However, science has achieved
that control over the hostile forces of nature which religion sought but
was not able to bring about.



THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS 149
Quincy Howe, editor of Living Age, asked: "Is it not more likely
that the lowbrows will follow the highbrows away from religion than
that the reverse process will occur?" (Cited by V. F. Calverton, in 40,
p. 265.) The institutions of orthodox Christianity seemingly no longer
attract men and women of superior intelligence. Ellsworth Huntington
and Leon F. Whitney made a survey of the religious affiliations of men
and women listed in Who's Who in A?nerica, and they found that, of
every 100,000 Unitarians in the nation, 1,185 were sufficiently emi
nent to be listed in Who's Who, whereas there were only eight Luther
ans and seven Catholics listed therein. The decay of religion is particu
larly evident in the decline in the quality of men entering the Christian
ministry as a profession. As lately as three hundred years ago, many of
the best minds could be found among the clergy; and even in the eight
eenth and nineteenth centuries some first-rate intellects were attracted
to the ministry; but that is not so today.
About a hundred years ago in the United States, the outstanding col
leges and universities were affiliated with various denominations of the
Christian churches. A trend toward secularization was started by Ezra
Cornell, a philanthropist who desired to promote a system of higher ed
ucation free from clerical control. So Cornell established Cornell Uni
versity at Ithaca, New York. The trend toward secularization became
popular, and many other institutions followed suit. John D. Rockefel
ler, Sr., was a devout Christian of the Baptist persuasion; and he do
nated a large amount of money to the founding of the University of
Chicago for the specific purpose of training ministers for the Baptist
church. Today that university is almost completely secularized; and,
though it does have a theological school, the training of clergymen is
not an important part of its educational program. It is a well-known
fact that religion is no longer front-page news. In a modern daily news
paper, the most important news is displayed on the front page; slightly
less important news goes on page two. The relatively unimportant
news appears way back near the want ad section; and that is where you
find the sermon page in the Monday morning editions of the great
metropolitan dailies. Even the uneducated masses are largely indifferent
to religion. In the elegant eighties and the gay nineties of the nine
teenth century, Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll, the benevolent agnostic,
gave stirring antireligious lectures to large and enthusiastic audiences.
Outstanding Christian clergymen were outraged, and they preached
sermons against Ingersoll. In those days, both the lectures of the Colo



150 MAN, COD, AND CIVILIZATION
nel and his ministerial opponents were prominently featured by the
outstanding newspapers. Today, the public interest tends toward prob
lems of immediate concern, and hence religious controversy is no
longer big news.
Though the apologists for religion are willing to concede that their
beliefs are based primarily on faith, they do not reject entirely the em
ployment of reason; for they claim to prove by the use of the unaided
reason the validity of the God idea and the doctrine of immortality.
Near the end of the eighteenth century, a Christian theologian, Arch
deacon William Paley, published a book entitled The Evidences of
Christianity. His alleged proof of the existence of God became a Chris
tian classic. Paley, in this work, tells of how a European traveler lost his
watch on the beach of a lonely island in the South Seas. A savage came
along in due time and, finding the watch, picked it up. While gazing
thoughtfully at the timepiece, he engaged in metaphysical meditations
of great profundity. This savage noticed the skillfully arranged and in
tricate mechanism of wheels, levers, springs, and hands, and concluded
that they could not have assembled themselves fortuitously. It was ob
vious, he reasoned, that some man made the watch, as it certainly could
not have manufactured itself. Since complex machines like watches
must, of necessity, have been made by men, then the man must there
fore be more wonderful than the watch. If the watch could not produce
itself, then it was a certainty that man could not create himself. So
there must be someone greater than man who was responsible for his
existence. In other words, there must be a God. This argument when
presented to intelligent children frequently brings forth the question:
Who made God? Adults as a rule do not ask this question, since they
have been taught that such questions are not considered good form.
The stock orthodox argument in favor of belief in immortality is that
everybody has an instinctive desire to live forever and that the very ex
istence of this hope is valid evidence that immortality is a fact. It might
be argued on the other hand that, since most people fear death, this
very dread proves that death ends all.
The greatest asset of the sacerdotalists is the ignorance and credulity
of their clients. This was clearly shown by the crude religious propa
ganda circulated in the United States during World War II. There
was a popular slogan abroad stating: "There are no atheists in the fox
holes." We were told that the Good Lord allowed a large number of
Christian American soldiers to be trapped in foxholes where the heathen Japanese raked them with machine-gun fire and dropped bombs



THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS 151
on them. Why God exposed His followers to dire peril in that way and
kept the atheists in places of safety was not explained. Bergen Evans, in
his entertaining book, The Natural History of Nonsense (77), called at
tention to the unconscious irreverence of other war propaganda of the
same period. For instance, a book was written by an officer of the Air
Force with the title God Is My Co-Pi lot. God could not be dispensed with, but he was given the subordinate position of co-pilot.
A few years back, numerous orthodox apologists attempted to re
store the waning prestige of Christian theology by citing the testimony
of certain eminent scientists and scholars in favor of religion. The men
most frequently mentioned were Sir James Jeans, Sir Arthur Edding
ton, Professor Albert Einstein, Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn, and
Professor Robert A. Millikan. Not one among them accepted the doc
trines of traditional religion. Most of these men, it is true, were avow
edly religious, but they professed a very liberal type of religion which
was in no way connected with the traditional creeds of the various
churches. The late H. G. Wells gently poked fun at Sir James Jeans
for declaring that, since the universe seems to be based on mathematical principles, then God must be a Great Mathematician. Sir James
further stated that the appropriate symbol of his mathematical God should be the mathematical unit of the system of Imaginary Numbers.
This unit is the number \Zzl (the square root of minus one). Wells
seems to have thought that Jeans was joking, for it seemed to him that any God symbolized by the imaginary unit would be equally imaginary. But imaginary numbers, as any student of mathematics or engi
neering will testify, are by no means actually imaginary; so Sir James
Jeans may not have been joking.
Professor Isaac Asimov, in one of his popular science books, tells an
amusing story of how, when a student in college, he got into an argu
ment with a professor on the question as to whether imaginary num
bers existed or not. We shall let the professor tell his own tale, for his
style is inimitable:
When I was a mere slip of a lad and attended college, 1 had a friend with whom I ate lunch every day. His 11 A.M. class was in sociology, which I
absolutely refused to take, and my 11 A.M. class was calculus, which he as
steadfastly refused to take—so we had to separate at eleven and meet at
twelve. As it happened, the sociology professor was a scholar who did things in the grand manner, holding court after class was over. Consequently, when my calculus lecture was over, I had to enter the sociology room and wait
patiently for court to conclude.



152 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Once, I walked in when the professor was listing on the board his classi
fication of mankind into the two groups of mystics and realists, and under
mystics he had included mathematicians along with the poets and theologians. One student wanted to know why.
"Mathematicians," said the professor, "are mystics because they believe
in numbers that have no reality."
Now, ordinarily as a non-member of the class, I sat in the corner and
suffered in silent boredom, but now, 1 rose convulsively and said, "What numbers?"
The professor looked in my direction and said, "The square root of
minus one. It has no existence. Mathematicians call it imaginary, but they
believe it has some sort of an existence in a mystical way."
"There's nothing mystical about it," 1 said, angrily, "the square root of minus one is just as real as any other number."
The professor smiled. "Come, young man, hand me the square root of
minus one piece of chalk."
But I raised my voice, "I'll do it, I'll do it. I'll hand you the square root of
minus one piece of chalk, if you hand me a one 'half piece of chalk.' "
The professor smiled again, and said, "Very well," broke a fresh piece of
chalk in half and handed me one of the halves. "Now for your end of the
bargain."
"Ah, but wait," I said, "you haven't fulfilled your end. This is one piece
of chalk you've handed me, not a one half piece." 1 held it up for the others
to see. "Wouldn't you all say this was one piece of chalk? It certainly isn't
two or three."
But, by now the professor had lost his equanimity altogether and his final
argument was unanswerable. He said, "Get the hell out of here." I left
(laughing) and thereafter waited for my friend in the corridor. (4, pp. 73
74)
Giordano Bruno, in the sixteenth century, declared: "Man is no
more than an ant in the presence of the infinite." This did not please
the ruling Church-State setup, so Bruno was silenced by being burned
at the stake. But the progress of science was not halted. A century
later, the Age of Newton arrived and, although Newton was a devout
Christian, his discoveries were destructive of religious beliefs.
This viewpoint has been well expressed in a popular work on the
role of mathematics in Western culture, from which we cite the fol
lowing excerpt:
The Newtonian era created celestial mechanics but destroyed heaven,
the seat of God and the eventual dwelling of privileged human souls. God lost not only his home but his importance. To Descartes, it was already



THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS 153
clear rhar God, the omnipotent, could not abolish extension or the laws of
motion. Newton, along with Descartes, credited God with the act of crea
tion but restricted his daily functions. Huygens and Leibniz curtailed God's
role even more. They, too, credited Him with the initial act of creation, at
which time He established the mathematical order of the universe. There
after, however, His active relations with it ceased. The universe was stable;
there was no room for whim or chance. By this masterly mathematical
achievement, even the corrective measures formerly required of God were made unnecessary and God was deprived of one more duty. It was not long
before God, Himself, was completely dispensed with, for Hume attacked
causality, and, consequently, the need for a creator, or Prime Mover, of
the universe. The world became an eternal, infinite, self-moving machine
which existed before and would exist after insignificant man, serving no ap
parent purpose except perhaps to delight the mathematician who was
slowly, but surely uncovering the controlling principles. Events took place
not because God ordered them, individually, and after due consideration,
but rather because they were predetermined by fixed, already existing
mathematical laws. (135, pp. 258-59)
Archdeacon Paley's watch argument does not carry much weight
today. An American literary man, the late Colonel Rupert Hughes,
adopted a variant of Paley's contention and then showed that his exam
ination of the same problem led to a conclusion definitely anti-theistic.
In a brilliant essay, Colonel Hughes compared the creation of the uni
verse by God with the invention of the Ford motorcar by Henry Ford.
The reader was asked to ponder the question as to how the first Ford
car originated. We know that such a complex machine could not have
just happened. A reasonable view would be that the Ford auto was a
product of the inventive genius of Henry Ford. But could Mr. Ford
single-handedly have produced his famous Model T? Let us examine
this question carefully. A Ford, or any other automobile, requires
pneumatic tires made of rubber. This calls for rubber plantations and tire factories manned by many hands. The engine can be manufactured
and assembled only by a multitude of workers in iron, steel, and other
metals, and the same goes for the chassis and body of the car. The glass
for headlights and windshields also necessitates a considerable labor
force. A motorcar must have fuel, which is a product of an extensive
oil-producing industry, which also employ large numbers of men as la
borers, technicians, engineers, and so on. So we see that the Ford car was created by the combined efforts of myriads of people. Colonel
Hughes contended that, if one man could not create an automobile,



154 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
was it logical to assume that only one God could create a world or a
universe? Let us assume that one omnipotent God did make the world.
Harking back to Paley, a watch is a wonderful mechanism, and we
know that something more wonderful made the watch—in other
words, a man. Man could not create himself, so there must have been a
more wonderful being, namely a god. But how can we stop here?
Where did God come from? Was he created by a super-god or by a
syndicate of higher gods, and so on, and so on.
Colonel Ingersoll argued cogently that the god-idea explained noth
ing. We may ask: How did the universe or the world come about? The
answer is that we do not know; it is a mystery. We have one mystery
on hand already. Then we invoke another mystery called God to ac
count for a mysterious universe. Now, we have two mysteries to deal
with. This is clearly a violation of the law of parsimony. When one is
asked whether or not he believes in God, the question may be regarded
as so ambiguous as to have no meaning at all. For there are at least two
types of gods recognized in, the modern world. There is the personal
God of the theologians and the nonpersonal God or gods of the philos
ophers. When Professor Albert Einstein was asked if he believed in
God, he replied that he believed in the God of Spinoza. It is well
known that Spinoza believed that God was just another name for Na
ture. Disbelievers in supernaturalism are called agnostics or atheists; but
what, precisely, do these epithets mean? Here the opinions of Professor
J. B. Bury are worthy of thoughtful consideration:
The agnostic holds that there are limits to human reason, and that theol
ogy lies outside those limits. Within those limits lies the world with which
science (including psychology) deals. Science deals entirely with phe
nomena and has nothing to say to the nature of the ultimate reality which
may lie behind phenomena. There are four possible attitudes to this ulti
mate reality. There is the attitude of the metaphysician and theologian, who
are convinced not only that it exists, but that it can be at least partly
known. There is the attitude of the man who denies that it exists; but he
must be also a metaphysician for its existence can only be disproved by
metaphysical arguments. Then there are those who assert that it exists but
deny that we can know anything about it. And finally, there are those who
say that we cannot know whether it exists or not. These last are agnostics in
the strict sense of the term, men who profess not to know. The difference
between an agnostic and an atheist is that the atheist positively denies the ex
istence of a personal God; the agnostic does not believe in it. (36, pp. 213-14)



THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS 155
The classic statement of the agnostic position was given by Leslie
Stephen in an essay, "An Agnostic's Apology," published in 1876 in
the Fortnightly Review, from which the following is an excerpt:
Why, when no honest man will deny in private that every ultimate
problem is wrapped in the profoundest mystery, do honest men proclaim in
pulpits that unhesitating certainty is the duty of the most foolish and igno
rant? We are a company of ignorant beings, dimly discerning light enough
for our daily needs, but hopelessly differing whenever we attempt to de
scribe the ultimate origin or end of our paths; and yet, when one of us ven
tures to declare that we don't know the map of the universe as well as the
map of our infinitesimal parish, he is hooted, reviled and perhaps told that
he will be damned to all eternity for his faithlessness. (36, pp. 215-16)
Thomas Paine, in his famous book The Age of Reason, repeatedly
declared his belief in the existence of God, and yet Paine was charged
by the orthodox with being an atheist. Paine did not believe in the per
sonal god of the religions; he was therefore, not a theist but an atheist
He did believe in the God of the philosophers, which was not con
ceived as personal; so that Paine was actually a deist; his God was natu
ral rather than supernatural.
When organized Christianity was in its prime, it crushed heresy by
killing the heretics. Nowadays, it lacks this power, so it resorts to ostra
cism and other forms of harassment. This has posed a problem for anti
clerical skeptics. Since a frontal attack on organized superstition has
small chance of success, many critics of orthodoxy have adopted various
subterfuges. Voltaire, in his lifelong battle against the tyranny of
church and state, used the weapon of ridicule with telling effect. When
in the next century the English historian, Winwood Reade, openly at
tacked the foundations of Christianity, his enemies retaliated by mak
ing life miserable for him. Reade, in 1872, published his most famous book The Martyrdom of Man. He held a rather low opinion of the pop
ular religion of his time, and he did not hesitate to criticize it adversely.
In discussing the popular theism of his day, he wrote the following:
This brings us to the character of the Creator. We must beg to observe
again that we describe not the actual Creator, but the popular idea of the
Creator. It is said that the Creator is omnipotent and also that he is benevo
lent. But one proposition contradicts the other. Again, either sin entered
the world against the will of the Creator, in which case he is not omnipo
tent, or, it entered with his permission, in which case it is his agent, in
which case, he selects sin, in which case he has a preference for sin, in



156 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
which case he is fond of sin, in which case he is sinful. It is certain that the
feelings of the created have in no way been considered. If, indeed, there
were a judgment day, it would be for man to appear at the bar not as a
criminal, but as accuser. What has he done that he should be subjected to a
life of torture and temptation? God might have made us all happy and he
has made us all miserable. Is that benevolence? God might have made us all
pure and he has made us all sinful. Is that the perfection of morality? If I be
lieved in the existence of this man-created God, of this divine Nebuchad
nezzar, I would say, "You can make me live in your world, O Creator, but you cannot make me admire it; you can load me with chains, but you can
not make me flatter you; you can send me to hell-fire, but you cannot ob
tain my esteem. And if you condemn me, you condemn yourself. If I have committed sins, you invented them, which is worse. If the watch you have
made does not go well, whose fault is that? Is it rational to damn the wheels
and springs?" (203, pp. 416-17)
Mark Twain, the great American writer, read The Martyrdom of
Man, and liked it. The passage cited above particularly appealed to
Twain, and he wove a famous story around it. Here we allude to The
Mysterious Stranger, one of Mark Twain's greatest stories. Like many
other adventure stories, the plot calls for a hero and a villain. In The
Mysterious Stranger, Satan is the hero and God is the villain. The au
thor, thinking that the publication of the story would do him no good
in his lifetime, stipulated that his publisher should not issue the tale
until after his death. Mark Twain's publisher was the well-known firm
of Harper and Brothers. So, after the death of the author, The Mysteri
ous Stranger was published by Harper's as a juvenile classic. The book
was printed in large type with attractive color plates and became
widely popular.
The setting of this story was a sleepy little Austrian village, and the
time was the winter season of the year 1 590. The name of the village
was Eseldorf (English translation: Jackassville). The adventures began
when three village boys were playing in some neighboring woods and
along came a handsome young man, the Mysterious Stranger. The
three boys were named Theodor, Nikolaus, and Seppi; and the narra
tive is put into the mouth of Theodor, who is imagined to have written
down in later years the memories of his boyhood escapades. The Stranger was a handsome young man attired in new clothing of good
quality. He told the boys that his name was Philip Traum, and that he
was a magician. The kids naturally asked him to do some tricks, and he
gladly complied with their requests. Philip, of course, was the old



THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS 157
Devil, and his tricks were impressive. In the words of Theodor: "He
made a tiny toy squirrel our of clay, and it ran up a tree and sat on a limb overhead and barked down at us. Then he made a dog that was
not much larger than a mouse and it treed the squirrel and danced
about the tree, excited and barking and was as alive as any dog could
be. It frightened the squirrel from tree to tree and followed it up until
both were out of sight in the forest. He made birds out of clay and set them free and they flew away singing."
The Stranger, after gaining the confidence of the boys, told them
that he was an angel, and that his real name was Satan, but that, while
he was in Eseldorf, he would use the alias Philip Traum. Theodor re
called: uWe had seen wonders this day; and my thoughts began to run
on the pleasure it would be to tell them when I got home, but he no
ticed those thoughts and said: 'No, all these matters are a secret among
us four. I do not mind you trying to tell them if you like, but I will pro
tect your tongues and nothing of the secret will escape from them.'
After taking a short vacation, Satan rejoined his three youthful friends and announced that he would make them all invisible and show
them some interesting sights. There was a local dungeon with a torture
chamber, and to that place they were whisked in a state of invisibility.
The scene is described by Theodor:
We were in the torture chamber, Satan said. The rack was there and the
other instruments, and there was a smoky lantern or two hanging on the walls and helping to make the place look dim and dreadful. There were
people there—and executioners—but as they took no notice of us, it meant that we were invisible. A young man lay bound, and Satan said he was sus
pected of being a heretic, and the executioners were about to inquire into it.
They asked the man to confess to the charge, and he said he could not, for
it was not true. Then, they drove splinter after splinter under his nails and
he shrieked with pain. Satan was not disturbed, but I could not endure it
and had to be whisked out of there. I was faint and sick, but the fresh air revived me and we walked toward my home. I said it was a brutal thing.
Satan replied sharply:
No, it was a human thing. You should not insult the brutes by such a
misuse of that word; they have not deserved it. It is like your paltry race
always lying, always claiming virtues it hasn't got, always denying them to the higher animals, which alone possess them. No brute ever does a cruel
thing. When a brute inflicts pain, he does it innocently; he does not inflict
pain for the pleasure of inflicting it—only man does that. . . . Are you feeling better? Let me show you something.



158 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Then the Devil sailed through the air with his young companions to
a village in France. Theodor relates what they saw: "We walked through a great factory of some sort, where men and women and little
children were toiling in heat and dirt and a fog of dust; and they were
clothed in rags and drooped at their work, for they^were worn and half starved, and weak and drowsy."
The boys wondered at the spectacle, and Satan explained: The proprietors are rich and very holy; but the wage they pay to these poor brothers and sisters of theirs is only enough to keep them from dropping dead with hunger. The work hours are fourteen per day, winter and
summer—from six in the morning till eight at night—little children and all.
And they walk to and from the pigsties which they inhabit—four miles
each way, through mud and slush, rain, snow, sleet, and storm, daily, year in and year out. They get four hours of sleep. They kennel together, three
families in a room, in unimaginable filth and stench; and disease comes and
they die off like flies. Have they committed a crime, these mangy things? No. What have they done that they are punished so? Nothing at all, except getting themselves born into your foolish race. You have seen how they treat misdoers there in jail; now you see how they treat the innocent and
the worthy. Is your race logical? Are these ill-smelling innocents better off than that heretic? Indeed, no; his punishment is trivial compared with theirs. They broke him on the wheel and smashed him to rags and pulp after we left, and he is dead now, and free of your precious race; but these
poor slaves here—why they have been dying for years and some of them will not escape from life for years to come.
A
little girl named Lisa from one of the poor families of Eseldorf died, and the following tragedy was enacted at the cemetery:
At the graveyard, the body of little Lisa was seized for debt by a carpenter to whom the mother owed fifty groschen for work done the year before. She had never been able to pay this and was not able now. The carpenter took the corpse home and kept it four days in his cellar, the mother weeping and imploring about his house all the time; then he buried it in his brother's cattle yard without religious ceremonies. It drove the mother wild with grief and shame, and she forsook her work and went daily about the town, cursing the carpenter and blaspheming the laws of the emperor and the church, and it was pitiful to see. Seppi asked Satan to interfere, but he said the carpenter and the rest were members of the human race and were
acting quite neatly for that species of animal. He would interfere if he found a horse acting in such a way, and we must inform him when we came across that kind of horse doing that kind of a human thing so that he could stop it. We believed this was sarcasm, for, of course, there wasn't any
such horse.



THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS 159
Theodor and his companions had an enjoyable time hobnobbing
with the Mysterious Stranger. In the words of Theodor: "It was won
derful, the mastery Satan had over time and distance. For him, they did
not exist. He called them human inventions and said they were arti
ficialities. We often went to the most distant parts of the globe with
him and stayed weeks and months and yet, were gone only a fraction
of a second, as a rule. You could prove it by the clock."
After returning from one of these incursions into space and time,
Philip and the boys returned to the village just in time to see a nice old
lady, suspected of being a witch, hanged and stoned to death by a mob
of her fellow citizens. The sad story was told by an eyewitness, the boy
Theodor:
She came flying down, with the howling and cursing mob after her and
tried to take refuge in houses, but the doors were shut in her face. They
chased her more than half an hour, we following to see it, and at last, she
was exhausted and fell and they caught her. They dragged her to a tree and
threw a rope over the limb and began to make a noose of it, some holding
her, meantime, and she crying and begging, and her young daughter look
ing on and weeping, but afraid to say or do anything. They hanged the
lady, and I threw a stone at her, although in my heart I was sorry for her;
but all were throwing stones and each was watching his neighbor, and if I
had not done as the others did it would have been noticed and spoken of.
Satan burst out laughing.
A
little later on, after the mob had dispersed, Theodor looked at the
Devil with a hurt expression on his face and Satan, reading his
thoughts, said: "Yes, I was laughing at you, because in fear of what
others might report about you, you stoned the woman when your heart
revolted at the act—but I was laughing at the others, too."
"Why?" the lad inquired.
"Because their case was yours," the Stranger replied.
"How is that?" Theodor asked.
"Well, there were sixty-eight people there, and sixty-two of them
had no more desire to throw a stone than you had."
"Satan!" the boy indignantly shouted in reply.
Then the Prince of Darkness really sounded off:
Oh it's true. I know your race. It is made up of sheep. It is governed by
minorities, seldom or ever by majorities. It suppresses its feelings and its be
liefs and follows the handful that makes the most noise. The vast majority



160 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
of the race, whether savage or civilized, are secretly kindhearted and shrink
from inflicting pain, but in the presence of the aggressive and pitiless mi
nority, they don't dare to assert themselves. Think of it! One kindhearted
creature spies upon another and sees to it that he loyally helps in iniquities
which revolt both of them. Speaking as an expert, 1 know that ninety-nine
out of a hundred of your race were strongly against the killing of witches
when that foolishness was first agitated by a handful of pious lunatics in the
long ago. . . . And yet, apparently everybody hates witches and wants
them killed. Some day a handful will rise up on the other side and make the
most noise—perhaps even a single daring man with a determined front will
do it—and in a week all the sheep will wheel and follow him, and witch
hunting will come to a sudden end.
Monarchies, aristocracies and religions are all based on that large defect
in your race—the individual's distrust of his neighbor, and his desire for
safety's or comfort's sake to stand well in his neighbor's eye. These institu
tions will always remain, and always flourish and always oppress you,
affront you, and degrade you, because you will always be and remain slaves
of minorities. There was never a country where the majority of the people
were in their secret hearts loyal to any of these institutions.
Look at you in war—what muttons you are, and how ridiculous! There
has never been a just one, never an honorable one—on the part of the insti
gator of the war. The loud little handful as usual will shout for the war. The
pulpit will, warily and cautiously, object at first; the great, big, dull bulk of
the nation will rub its sleepy eyes and try to make out why there should be
a war, and will say earnestly and indignantly, l it is unjust and dishonor
able, and there is no necessity for it." Then the handful will shout louder.
And now the whole nation—pulpit and all—will take up the war cry and
shout itself hoarse and mob any honest man who ventures to open his
mouth; and presently, such mouths will cease to open. Next, the statesmen
will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked,
and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will
diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and
thus, he will by and by convince himself that the war is just and will thank
God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-decep
tion.
Finally, one day, the Mysterious Stranger appeared to Theodor
when alone and announced that this was his final visit to Jackassville.
Before departing, Satan made a farewell speech in which he marveled
at the strange God worshiped by Christendom:
A God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet preferred to make bad ones; who could have made every one of them happy, yet never



THE TWILIGHT OF THE CODS 161
made a single happy one; who made rhem prize rheir birrer life, yet stingily
cut it short; who gave his angels eternal happiness unearned, yet required
his other children to earn it; who gave his angels painless lives, yet cursed
his other children with biting miseries and maladies of mind and body; who
mouths justice and invented hell, mouths mercy and invented hell, mouths
Golden Rules and forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and in
vented hell; who mouths morals to other people and has none himself; who
frowns upon crimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invi
tation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, in
stead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally,
with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor abused slave to worship him!
After delivering this last tirade, Old Nick vanished into the atmos
phere, and thus made his final departure from the little village of Jack
assville.
When one is discussing the existence of God, the word "God"
should be defined; for the God of the theologians is anthropomorphic,
whereas the God of the philosophers is nonpersonal; and that makes all
the difference in the world. The atheist rarely gets a fair hearing in re
ligious controversy. He is generally denounced as being antireligious;
but this is not necessarily so. The Buddhist religion is devoid of the
God idea, so Buddhists are atheists; but no one can show that Bud
dhism, with its millions of believers, is not a religion. The late I). M.
Bennett was an avowed atheist, yet he considered himself a religious
man; for he was both a Spiritualist and a Theosophist.
There is a story of how the French scientist and mathematician,
Pierre Simon Laplace, presented Napoleon with a five-volume set of
his Mecanique Celeste [Celestial Mechanics]. Napoleon asked him how
it was that he could write a work on the system of the universe and not
once mention the name of God. Laplace replied: "Sir, 1 have no need
of that hypothesis." Napoleon was only joking, because he was a skep
tic himself. Like many highly placed unbelievers, Napoleon found no
need of religion for himself, but thought it was a good thing for the common people. "What is it," Napoleon asked, "that makes the poor
man think it quite natural that there are fires in my palace while he is
dying of the cold? That I have ten coats in my wardrobe while he goes
naked? That at each of my meals enough is served to feed his family for
a week? It is simply religion, which tells him that in another life, I shall
be only his equal and that he actually has more chance of being happy
there than I. Yes, we must see to it that the floors of the churches are



162 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
open to all, and that it does not cost the poor man much to have prayers said on his tomb." (Cited by Professor George A. Dorsey in 71, pp. 940-41) Professor Dorsey commented on the above remarks of Napo
leon as follows: "Are press, big business, and politics in the same boat
as that notorious skeptic, Napoleon, who left religion alone because it
paid?"
In the early part of the present century, Andrew Carnegie, a well
known philanthropist, was endowing public libraries, and making pres
ents of pipe organs to various churches. One of Carnegie's friends, knowing that he was an atheist, asked him why he was giving away or
gans to churches; and the philanthropist replied that the sermons in
most churches were so dull that he hoped the sounds of the pipe organs would drown them out. Many men of wealth and high social position
have no use for religion, but consider it bad taste to openly admit it.
Andrew Carnegie was an exception; he was a freethinker and never denied it. Among Carnegie's close friends were Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll and Dr. Moncure Daniel Conway.
There is an interesting story relating to the friendship between Con
way and Carnegie. In the year 1904, a man called on the steel magnate
and requested financial aid for "God's work." Much to his dismay,
Carnegie replied: "I don't believe in God." As a result of this incident,
a prominent educator told a representative of the Philadelphia North American on May 2, 1904: "Andrew Carnegie is an infidel." We learn from George E. Macdonald, for many years editor of The Truth Seeker,
that:
The ironmaster's disbelief, like Mark Twain's, took the form of irreverence. He perpetrated in that year 1904 a practical joke on Dickinson Col
lege, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, a Methodist institution. The college had lately
lost one of its buildings by fire and the mind of its president, Dr. George E. Reed, turned to Carnegie as the possible source of a contribution to erect a
new one. Dickinson chanced to be the institution that, in 1852, had bestowed the prefix reverend on Carnegie's admired friend, Moncure D. Conway; and so, notwithstanding Dr. Conway had dropped the ministerial
title, turned infidel and was, at the time, in Rome as a delegate to the International Freethought Congress, Mr. Carnegie told the man who solicited his money in behalf of the Methodist seat of learning that he would subscribe fifty thousand dollars toward a new building if they would call it
Conway Hall. The trustees consenting, the hall was built and named accordingly. The Truth Seeker chortled with unholy glee to see an institution founded in Calvinism in 1783 by John Dickinson and taken over by the Methodists one hundred and twenty years later, pay this distinguished
honor to a living Freethinker. (160, Vol. II, p. 246)



THE TWILIGHT OK THK CODS 163
The orthodox religionists managed to hold their own as long as they
could prevent scientists and scholars from getting a fair hearing; but
when the colleges and universities became secularized, they began to
lose ground rapidly. Only a few years ago, liberal clergymen lost their
pulpits for saying openly what they believed. The Reverend Dr. Harry
Emerson Fosdick was ousted by the Presbyterian Church, but that
caused him no hardship: Through the good offices of John D. Rocke
feller, Jr., he was called to the pulpit of the Riverside Church in New
York City. Bishop William Montgomery Brown of the Protestant Episcopal Church was unfrocked after announcing that he had become
a Darwinian Evolutionist and a Marxian Socialist. A short time later,
the Reverend Mr. Brown was installed as a Bishop in the Old Catholic
Church, an institution that did not regard his views as heretical. The
Christian churches have become so liberalized in recent years that a few of them even welcome atheists as members. This new movement is
known as Christian Atheism. This may sound outlandish to many, but
nevertheless it is a fact. A timely commentary on this situation has been
made by David Tribe, President of the National Secular Society of
l>ondon:
The novel situation has arisen that, while many freethinkers still describe
themselves as agnostics, some theologians are opting for atheism—Christian
atheism. The adjective makes it respectable. In The New Reformation
(1965), the Bishop of Woolwich took the logical next step from his Honest
to God (1963) to ask: "Can a truly contemporary person not be an atheist?"
In the United States, under the influence of freethinking, Friedrich
Nietzsche's "God is Dead," ... a number of modernist theologians, notably, Thomas J. J. Altizer of Emory University, William Hamilton of Col
gate Rochester Divinity School and Paul Van Buren of Temple University
have formed the Death of God school of Christian Atheists. The lack of
anxiety, indeed the relief, of these liberal churchmen comes from realization
of what freethinking atheists have always believed: in the Bishop of Wool
wich's words, "God is intellectually superfluous, emotionally dispensable
and morally intolerable." (252, p. 64)
William Robert Miller is a liberal Christian layman, who has written
a thoughtful book, with the title Goodbye, Jehovah, and we believe that
what he has to say is important:
When Edison invented the electric light, there were more people with
degrees in theology than in the sciences. Today the reverse is true. Factual
knowledge looms larger than in earlier centuries. Modern man believes in



164 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
electricity because it works, not because he sees in it anything supernatural

it would not occur to him to look to God for an explanation. Hence, whatever we may wish to believe about God, much of our outlook on life is functionally atheistic. Despite nineteen centuries of a Gospel of the brotherhood of man, white Christians, until recently entertained notions of racial superiority which have been exploded only under the impact of genetics, scientific anthropology and other kinds of fact finding. In a generation or two, the jaunty slogan of free, white and twenty-one has been overtaken by freedom now and black power. . . . The man of today is constantly assailed with images of a
better life; unlike his ancestors, he has little reason to be content with his lot
or grateful to God just to survive. (172, pp. 7-8)
Time-Life Books publishes many works dealing with issues and problems of contemporary interest. Notable among such publications is
Can Christianity Survive? by the staff of Time, edited by Joe David Brown. One chapter of this book is entitled 'is God Dead?" There we
read: "The young theologians who are leaders in today's death of God
group—principally, Thomas J. J. Altizer, 40, of Emory University;
William Hamilton, 43, of New College, Sarasota, Florida, and Paul
Van Buren, 43, of Temple University—also believe that God is indeed
absolutely dead, but propose to carry on without God." (26, p. 19)
Dr. Thomas Altizer, for several years Associate Professor of Bible
and Religion at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, has written a
book with the challenging title, The Gospel of Christian Atheism. The
book is scholarly and not easy to read, but Dr. Altizer honestly states
what he believes: "True, every man today who is open to experience
knows that God is absent, but only the Christian knows that God is
dead, that the death of God is a final and irrevocable event, and that
God's death has actualized in our history a new and liberated human
ity." (2, p. Ill)
Dr. Paul M. Van Buren, Associate Professor of Religion at Temple
University, has enjoyed a fine educational background. After gradua
tion from Harvard University, he studied at the Episcopal Theological
school, also in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and he then worked for his
doctorate at the University of Basel, Switzerland, where he studied
under Karl Barth. He was ordained to the priesthood of the Episcopal
Church in 195 1. When asked how his ideas fit in with the other Death
of-God theologians, Van Buren answered: "The death of God for me
is that he never existed. I think all of us are atheists in the traditional
sense. But Hamilton and I believe that the image of Christ is central for
Christianity." (26, pp. 26-27)



THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS 165
We have mentioned the opinions of Altizer and Van Buren, and now we must present the position of Dr. Hamilton. According to Mil
ler:
William Hamilton of New College in Sarasota, Florida, has forcefully insisted on the historical death of God, asserting not simply that God does not exist but that the God who was once alive is now dead. Dietrich Bonhoeffer stated that the philosopher's metaphysical God had ceased, in our
time, to be tenable. Hamilton . . . presses the point further to include the transcendant God of the Bible, but neither he nor most of the other death of God theologians has attempted a systematic explanation of how or when God died. (172, p. 143)
The question of how and when God died is discussed in a recent book Excerpts from the Diaries of the Late God, selected and edited by
Anthony Towne (250). Towne, a talented poet and journalist, states in his preface:
After the unfortunate death of the late God in the autumn of 1965, it was generally accepted that the process of divine revelation had also come to its end. Dead gods, some declared, tell no tales. This hasty conclusion has proved to be without foundation. The deeply lamented Supreme Being, it
turns out, characteristically foresighted, had scrupulously kept throughout his protracted reign, meticulous diaries of the events attendant upon it. It would be the height of presumption on my part to speculate as to why I, of all miserable sinners, should have been chosen as the vehicle for these, the very last of ultimate revelations. . . . Certainly, no one ought, on account of this unique burden, impute to me any merit beyond the ordinary,
if that. More pertinent, surely, is the sad happenstance that it fell to me to compose, for The New York Times and Motive magazine, the obituary of God, a document included at the end of this book for the benefit of readers
who superstitiously skip that fascinating page of the estimable Times and which contains a full report of the circumstances surrounding that most grievous of deaths and the reaction of the world to it. 1 can only suppose that my obituary, inadequate though it humanly had to be, somewhat
pleased the powers that be—or should I say: the powers that remain? I sug
gest, in other words, that the incumbent authorities hoped from me in edit
ing and selecting from God's diaries the same objectivity and good taste I strove to impart to the obituary. To that modest standard I have, in any
event, pledged myself. (250, pp. 1-2)
The document referred to by Towne in the passage cited above is
headlined as follows:
coo is dead in Georgia—Eminent Deity succumbs during Surgery Succession in Doubt as all Creation Groans. LBJ Orders Flags at Half
Staff.



166 MAN, .GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Special to the New York Times, Atlanta, Ga., Nov. 9—God, creator of
the universe, principal deity of the world's Jews, ultimate reality of Christi
ans, and most eminent of all divinities, died late yesterday during major sur
gery undertaken to correct a massive diminishing influence.
The cause of death could not be immediately determined, pending an au
topsy, but the deity's surgeon, Thomas J. J. Altizer, 38, of Emory Univer
sity in Atlanta, indicated possible cardiac insufficiency. Assisting Dr. Al
tizer in the unsuccessful surgery were Dr. Paul Van Buren of Temple
University, Philadelphia; Dr. William Hamilton of Colgate-Rochester,
Rochester, N.Y., and Dr. Gabriel Vahanian of Syracuse University, Syra
cuse, N.Y. ... At the bedside, when the end came, were, in addition to
the attending surgeons and several nurses, the Papal Nuncio to the United
States, representing his Holiness, Pope Paul VI, Vicar of Christ on Earth and Supreme Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church; Iakovos, Archbishop of North and South America, representing the orthodox churches; Dr. Eu
gene Carson Blake, Stated Clerk of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.,
representing the World Council of Churches, predominantly a Protestant
institution; Rabbi Mark Tannenbaum of New York City, representing the
tribes of Israel, chosen people, according to their faith, of the deceased; the
Rev. William Movers, Baptist minister, representing President Johnson;
the 3rd Secretary of the Soviet embassy in Trinidad, representing the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; and a number of unidentified curious
bystanders. (250, p. 105)
According to Towne's book, both houses of Congress met in Wash
ington and promptly adjourned on November 9, 1965, after passing a
joint resolutionexpressing "grief and great respect for the departed spirit
ual leader. " Senator Wayne Morse, Democrat of Oregon, objected,
holding that the resolution violated the principle of separation of church
and state, but was overruled by Vice President Hubert Humphrey,
who said that "this is not a time for partisan politics."
From Independence, Missouri, ex-President Harry S Truman was
quoted as saying: "I'm always sorry to hear somebody is dead. It's a
damn shame." In Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, former President Dwight
D. Eisenhower authorized the release of the following statement: "Mrs.
Eisenhower joins me in heartfelt sympathy to the family and many
friends of the late God. He was, I always felt, a force for moral good in
the universe. Those of us who were privileged to know him admired
the probity of his character, the breadth of his compassion, the depth of
his intellect. Generous almost to a fault, his many acts of kindness to
America will never be forgotten. It is a very great loss indeed. He will
be missed."



THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS 167
Near the end of the obituary is the following note: "(Next Sunday's
New York Times will include, without extra charge, a 24-page full
color supplement with many photographs, reviewing the major events
of God's long reign, the circumstances of his sudden and untimely
death, and prospects for a godless future. The editors will be grateful
for pertinent letters, photographs, visions and the like.)"
Towne concludes the obituary with the following announcement:
"There has been as yet no statement from Jesus, but a close associate,
the Holy Ghost, has urged prayer and good works. He also said that it
is the wish of the family that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made
to the Building Fund for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New
York City so that the edifice may be finished." (250, p. 108)
An interesting question to consider is: How did religious doctrines
which had survived for ages finally reach their nadir in the middle of
the twentieth century? It seems to us that the man who had the clearest
insight on this question was the late Dr. Paul Carus. He was a distin
guished philosopher, the author of many worthwhile books, and the ed
itor of two scholarly magazines, The Open Court and The Monist. His
finest book was The History of the Devil and the Idea of Evil from the
Earliest Times to the Present Day (42). The author of that work seemed
to think that religion was losing ground among intelligent people, be
cause after such people began to disbelieve the existence of the Devil,
the next step was to doubt the existence of God. After all, if you be
lieve in both a God and a Devil, you can thank God for all the good
things in the world and then blame the Devil for all that is bad. But
once the Devil is dismissed as a myth, then God becomes responsible
for the evil as well as the good. "While the idea of God has received
much attention from philosophers and progressive theologians," Dr.
Carus observed, "its counterpart, the dark figure of the Evil One, has
been much neglected. And yet, the Devil is, after all, a very interesting
personality, grotesque, romantic, humorous, pathetic, nay, even grand
and tragic. And if we have to declare that the idea of God is a symbol
signifying an actual presence in the world of facts, should we not ex
pect that the idea of the Devil also represents a reality?" (42, p. 5)
Good is good only because there is evil, and God is God because there is
a Devil. As evil is not mere negation, so the figure of Satan in religion is not
an idle fancy. . . . According to the account in the second chapter of Gen
esis, Satan is the father of science, for he induced Eve to make Adam taste
of the fruit of knowledge, and the Ophites, a Gnostic sect, worshiped the



168 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
serpent for that reason. Satan produces the unrest in society, which, in spite
of many inconveniences, makes the world move onward and forward; he is
the patron of progress, investigation, and invention. Milton's Satan is a
grand character, a noble souled rebel, who would rather undergo an eter
nity of torture than suffer humiliation. Consider but the fact that, taking the
statements of his adversaries alone, the Devil is the most trustworthy person
in existence. He has been cheated by innumerable sinners, saints, angels,
and (according to various old church legends) even by the good Lord him
self; and yet he has never been found wanting in the literal and punctilious
fulfillment of all his promises; and all the bad experiences he has had in the
course of millenniums have not in the least lowered his character. His mere
word is honored as the holiest oath, or as the best signature verified with
seals and legal witnesses. The instances are rare in which it is known that
persons with whom he has had business transactions have requested him to
sign a contract, to give a pledge, or to show any proof that he would honestly abide by his word; his honesty was never doubted by anybody. And,
mind you, it is not the Devil who boasts of his integrity, but this is the con
clusion at which we arrive from the evidences adduced by his enemies. The
Devil is the father of all misunderstood geniuses. It is he who induces us to
try new paths; he begets originality of thought and deed. He tempts us to
venture into unknown seas for the discovery of new ways to the wealth of
distant Indias. He makes us dream of and hope for more prosperity and
greater happiness. He is the spirit of discontent that embitters our hearts,
but in the end, often leads to a better arrangement of affairs. In truth, he is a
very useful servant of the Almighty, and all the heinous features of his char
acter disappear when we consider the fact that he is necessary in the econ
omy of nature as a wholesome stimulant to action and as the power of re
sistance that evokes the noblest efforts of living beings.
God, being the All in All, regarded as the ultimate authority for conduct,
is neither evil itself nor goodness itself, but, nevertheless, he is in the good,
and he is in the evil. He who has eyes to see, ears to hear and a mind to per
ceive, will read a lesson out of the very existence of evil, a lesson which, in
spite of the terrors it inspires, is certainly not less impressive, nor less di
vine, than the sublimity of a holy life; and thus it becomes apparent that the
existence of Satan is part and parcel of the divine dispensation. Indeed we
must grant that the Devil is the most indispensable and faithful helpmate of
God. To speak mystically, even the existence of the Devil is filled with the
presence of God. (42, pp. 484-88)
Colonel Robert Ingersoll was once asked what he would do to improve the world, were he endowed with supernormal power, and he
answered, "The first thing 1 would do, would be to make health catch
ing instead of disease." A laudable sentiment, we think, but such a



THE TWILIGHT OF THE GODS 169
project does not seem possible. This brings to mind the story of the
meeting of an American Christian missionary with a pagan African
chief. "Chief," the missionary said, "you should embrace my religion
because my God can do anything." The chief answered: "That I can
not believe. I would like to have your God place two mountains next to
each other without having a valley between them."
The future of religion does not seem very bright at present. In the
early ages of the world, men and women worshiped many gods; then
the gods began to die out, until only one was left; and now we are told,
not by infidel scientists, but by Christian theologians, that the one sur
viving deity has died. But let us not despair. We might well take heed
of some advice left to us by Colonel Ingersoll, who said: "Let us put
another O in GOD, and make it GOOD, and let us take the D out of DEVIL and make it EVIL."



CHAPTER NINE
The Nature of Civilization
THE shelves of libraries contain numerous ponderous tomes treating
of the history of civilization. The writers of these works are presuma
bly learned men, possessed of profound knowledge. However, they
have not been notably successful in transmitting their lore to the unini
tiated. One large defect of these so-called authorities is that they rarely,
if ever, get around to telling us what civilization is. Some sort of answer
to the question, What is civilization?, we think, would be of considera
ble value to the reader. On page one, Volume I, of his voluminous The
Story of Civilization, Dr. Will Durant tells us: ''Civilization is social
order promoting cultural creation," which is all very well as far as it
goes, but it does not go far enough. Dictionaries are as a rule not very
helpful when a question of this sort arises; for it does not help us much
to be informed that: "Civilization is a state of being civilized." So we
shall have to attempt to formulate a scientifically accurate definition of
civilization.
To begin, let us say that civilization is a form of culture; so first we
must define culture. Culture, to speak precisely, is patterned behavior,
and may be described as the organized behavior which the individual
person learns either through training or by imitation from other mem
bers of his or her social group. Culture consists of all forms of human
behavior except those which apes and mankind share in common.
Among behavior patterns common to apes and men are impulses to
ward mating and parenthood; the tendencies to show off, to attack oth
ers when angry, and to take flight when frightened; and the desire for
companionship. These are noncultural activities. The forms of behavior
restricted to humanity are truly cultural activities and may be denoted
as the growing of crops, the domestication of animals and plants, the art
170



THE NATURE OF CIVILIZATION 171
of cooking, the weaving of clothes, and the use of language (which may
be defined as the expression of definite ideas by means of the larynx,
lips, and tongue) for the purpose of mutual communication.
Now we should be able to give a satisfactory definition of civiliza
tion, for civilization is nothing more or less than literate culture. A bare
definition would be of little value, but the following brief but lucid ex
planation from the pen of an outstanding anthropologist is illuminating:
A society is civilized only if it contains scholars and scientists. The
scholar consolidates and clarifies the knowledge which has already been ac
quired and hands it on to the scientist, who, thus provided, proceeds to experiment and thus to the increase of knowledge. Without the torch of
learning, the scientist is reduced to groping in the dark, and without the
scientist to use and test the results of his learning, the scholar sinks into a
barren pedantry. Thus scholarship and science, in the widest sense of these
terms, are the warp and woof of civilization. And the scientist, no less than
the scholar, is dependent upon the written word; not only must he be able
to use the learning of the scholars, but he must be able to record the results
of his own investigations. Since, then, civilization depends upon scholarship
and science, and these depend upon writing, civilization can only arise
where the art of writing is known. (104, pp. 3-4)
Any discussion of the nature of civilization involves the idea of prog
ress; so we must have some conception of what constitutes progress. In
the absence of progress, we experience its negative counterpart, retro
gression; so this fact must also be taken into account. Progress means
the increase of knowledge, whereas retrogression is another name for
the loss of knowledge. Since knowledge is just another name for
science, we may say that a civilization is progressive when science
flourishes within its framework. On the other hand, in a culture where
science is on the decline, we have retrogression or regress. The out
standing feature of culture is its dynamism. So civilization, being a
form of culture, cannot remain static; it must change by either going
forward or slipping backward, for it cannot just stand still. In the jun
gles of Asia, Africa, and Central America, explorers have discovered
ruins of great palaces and temples in places as far apart as Angkor,
Pagan, Borobudur, Zimbabwe, Palenque, and Uxmal. These lost cities
were once centers of civilizations which declined and finally expired.
This fact suggests the question: Why do civilizations wane and disappear? A popular theory advanced by Oswald Spengler in his The De
cline of the West is that nations, like individuals, are born; then pass



172 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
through stages of infancy, youth, maturity, and senility; and eventually
die. As the old civilizations pass off the stage of history, they are suc
ceeded by younger and more vigorous cultures. These, rekindling the
torch of progress, pass it on to the future. Henry Thomas Buckle, in his
History of Civilization, argued that civilization began in southern lands
but improved in quality as it traveled northward. Greek and Roman
cultures were greater than that of Egypt because Greece and Rome
were situated further north than Egypt; and the English people who
lived even further north than the Greco-Romans produced the greatest
of all cultures. Buckle, being a patriotic Englishman of the mid-nine
teenth century, did not follow his hypothesis to its logical conclusion.
For this line of reasoning would lead us to expect that the Eskimos of
the Arctic regions should have reached the very apex of civilization,
dwelling as they do so close to the North Pole. We are told, by those
who regard progress as an innate feature of human societies, that civili
zation is here to stay; for whenever an old civilization gives up the
ghost there is always a new one ready to carry on. This speculation,
plausible though it may seem to its advocates, has nothing to recom
mend it from a pragmatic angle. For, as Lord Raglan observed: "The builders of Babylon and Borobudur, of Uxmal and Zimbabwe and
many another great city of the past, were succeeded not by people who
could revive and carry forward their civilization, but by the savage, the
jungle or the desert." (194, p. 26) Sir Edward Tylor in his classic
Primitive Culture suggested that a study of the decline and fall of various cultures of the past would produce knowledge which would be of
great value to students of the history of civilization. No such compre
hensive study of past cultures, such as that recommended by Tylor, has
as yet been undertaken; but Lord Raglan has made a short survey of
the subject in Chapter IV of How Came Civilization? and we shall at
tempt a brief discussion of this and other evidence. The ancestors of the
present-day inhabitants of Polynesia owned seagoing canoes and
ranged over the vast reaches of the Pacific Ocean establishing them
selves in places so far apart as New Zealand, Hawaii, and Easter Island.
Some modern Polynesians still possess seaworthy canoes, but they
rarely venture out of sight of land and no longer engage in long sea
voyages. Easter Island became famous on account of its ancient giant
stone statues. It is believed that these statues were constructed by the
ancestors of the modern inhabitants of the island, but the modern
Easter islanders have lost the art of carving stone. And there have been
other cultural losses; for when Captain Cook visited the island in 1774,



THE NATURE OF CIVILIZATION 173
the natives built canoes which they used in fishing. They now fish by
swimming, canoe-building having among them become a lost art. An
cient wooden plaques on Easter Island contain picture writing similar
to ancient Asiatic scripts, whereas the present dwellers can neither
create nor understand such inscriptions. The Maoris of New Zealand
were, in times past, proficient carvers in jade, but this is now a long lost
art among them. Professor Dixon notes that "the Polynesians in their
eastward drift into the Pacific, lost textiles, pottery, metal-working and
gave up the use of the bow." (68, p. 280)
Similar examples of retrogression have been observed among the
Melanesians. Among the people of the New Hebrides, as late as the
seventeenth century, the craft of the weaver was in a flourishing condi
tion; whereas today the art of weaving has been entirely lost. Likewise,
pottery manufacture has expired in many parts of the same region.
Certain arts and crafts were the monopolies of particular families in
Melanesia. When these families died out, the skills were lost to the
tribes. It was in this way that the art of boat-building became extinct in
the Torres Islands. Similarly, pottery-making became a lost art in
Santo, and the same fate befell weaving in Ureparapara. The Papuans
are still acquainted with the knowledge of weaving fabrics with the hand loom, but this art is declining among them, even where European
influence was absent.
In Africa, it has been noticed by W. D. Hambly that "in time past,
the Cape Bushmen, also some Hottentots, made pottery, but this is
now a lost art." (109, p. 332) In Rhodesia are the remains of ancient gold mines, some of them 1 50 feet deep. These mines were worked by
Africans in the past, but their present-day successors know nothing of
mining, lacking even the candles and lamps without which these mines
could never have been worked. The ancient people of Zimbabwe, in
Mashonaland, were miners of iron on an extensive scale, since relics of
smelting furnaces have been found in the ruins, but this skill is now
only a memory of a distant past. "How far back this civilization dates it
is difficult to say," asserted Professor DuBois, "a great deal depending
on the dating of the Iron Age in South Africa. If it was the same as in
the Mediterranean regions, the earliest limit was 1000 B.C.; it might,
however, have been earlier, especially if, as seems probable, the use of
iron originated in Africa. On the other hand, the culmination of this
culture has been placed by some as late as the Middle Ages." (73, p.
74) In Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania are extensive remains of a system
of graded roads, and terraces which were used for cultivation; but few



174 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
of the present inhabitants of this area make any use of the terraces. In
West Africa, remains of megalithic structures have been found among
peoples with a primitive type of culture, which shows that the ancestors
of these peoples possessed a higher type of culture in the past than is
extant in these areas at the present day.
In the Americas and in the northern part of Asia may be observed
instances of cultural regression. The Eskimo culture is not as well de
veloped now as it was in the past; for harpoon heads, discovered on the
sites of ancient villages in northern Alaska are considerably more elabo
rate and complex than the modern ones of the same area. Formerly,
these people built houses of stone and earth. Though the practice is not
yet extinct, it is in a state of decline. New houses of this type are rarely
built, and the old houses have largely ceased to be repaired. The Pueblo
Indians of the United States are now restricted to the northern parts of
Arizona and New Mexico; whereas about a thousand years ago, the
Pueblo culture covered all the territory now embraced by Arizona,
New Mexico, Utah, and a part of Texas. For a time, this region en
joyed prosperity and a fairly high level of culture; but, even before con
tact with Europeans, this culture disintegrated and the original inhabit
ants were replaced by tribes with a lower culture level, such as the
Apache. In the arts of building construction and pottery-making, the
Pueblo Indians have displayed a continuing record of regression. The
Incan culture of Peru and that of the Mayans of Yucatan were in an
advanced state of decay long before Columbus visited America. The
culture of the Mound Builders of the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys be
came completely extinct in pre-Columbian times. The Ostiak, who
now dwell along the Arctic shores of western Siberia, are believed to
have lived in times past much further to the south, in the region of the
Altai, and to have possessed a knowledge of metal working which was
lost in their northern migration.
Scientists and scholars who accept the theory of progress hold that
any human society, if left alone, tends to improve itself in a cultural
sense; but all objective evidence is against this position. "What the facts
suggest," Lord Raglan observed, "is that the natural state of man is a
state of low savagery, and that towards that state he always tends to re
vert whenever he is not checked, or forced in the opposite direction, by
that unexplained, but highly artificial, localized and spasmodic process
which we know as the progress of civilization." (194, p. 38) The prog
ress of Western civilization, during the last three or four hundred
years, has blinded many students of culture to the fact that only an un



THI. NATURK OK CIVILIZATION 175
rclcnring struggle can maintain a civilization. To advance the same re
quires an even greater effort. On purely theoretical grounds, progress
is not essential to the maintenance of civilization. We can imagine a so
ciety which neither lost old knowledge nor acquired new intelligence
in the various arts and sciences, and we can think of this dead-level of
culture surviving for ages. But, in practice, this could not happen. For
the scholars of this hypothetical society would, in time, specialize in
certain branches of knowledge, and the decline of neglected fields of
science would eventually lead to the retrogression of the entire culture.
Inevitably, there would be famines, plagues, wars, invasions, fires,
floods, earthquakes, and other disasters, which would lead to the loss of
libraries, records, scientists, and scholars. In its essential nature, civiliza
tion is dynamic, which is to say that it is always in a state of flux. A civ
ilization may slip backward; but to go forward, it has to be pushed.
In the study of the origin and evolution of culture, there are two
main schools of thought: the Evolutionary School and the Diffusionisr
School. The evolutionists believe that all the various civilizations origi
nated independently and then went through certain stages of cultural
change. The diffusionists, to the contrary, believe that from one origi
nal culture all the other civilizations evolved. Modern anthropologists
who were considered adherents of the evolutionary school were Lewis
H. iMorgan, Sir E. B. Tylor, Sir J. G. Frazer, and Professor Clark
Wissler. The outstanding advocates of diffusionism were Sir Grafton
Elliot Smith, Professor W. J. Perry, and Ford Raglan. Since the next
chapter treats of the origin of civilization, some of the ideas mentioned
in this chapter will be more fully elaborated and elucidated.



CHAPTER TEN
The Origin of Civilization
THE essential characteristic of civilized people is that they live in
cities; but before men could construct cities, they had to have possessed
hard metal tools. For countless millennia, before the dawn of the Age
of Metals, the only tools were those made of wood and stone. The ear
liest tool users were anthropoid apes, and the cleverest among these
tool-using apes evolved into the earliest type of humanity. Man
branched off from the apes about twenty-five million years ago, and he
has been civilized, we believe, for fewer than twenty-five thousand
years. Human culture may be divided into three periods: savagery, bar
barism, and civilization. The American anthropologist, Lewis Henry
Morgan, has traced this evolution of culture from savagery to civiliza
tion in the third chapter of Part I of his famous book, Ancient Society.
This scheme has been adversely criticized by some anthropologists, but
is still largely accepted by other students of human culture. According
to Morgan, the stages of savagery and barbarism were broken down
into three sub-periods each. These, with the period of civilization, give
us seven ethnical stages:
1 Lower Status of Savagery. This stage of human culture began
with the origin of humanity and ended with the acquisition of a fish
subsistence and of a knowledge of the use of fire. Men and women of
these early days were food-gatherers, subsisting on fruits and nuts. The
origin of articulate speech belongs to this period.
2. Middle Status of Savagery. This phase of human development
commenced with the acquirement of a fish subsistence and the art of making and using fire, and ended with the invention of the bow and
arrow. In this period, the human race left its original habitat and spread
out over the earth.
3. Upper Status of Savagery. This culture stage began with the in
176



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 177
vcnrion of the bow and arrow and terminared with rhe invention of the
art of pottery. This closes the period of savagery.
4. Lower Status of Barbarism. This sub-period began with the manu
facture of pottery and ended in the Old World with the domestication
of animals, and in the New World with the cultivation of maize and
other plants by irrigation, and the use of adobe, brick, and stone in the
building of houses.
5. Middle Status of Barbarism. This stage extended from the domes
tication of animals, irrigation, and brick and stone architecture to the
invention of the process of smelting iron ore.
6. Upper Status of Barbarism. It began with the manufacture of iron
implements and ended with the invention of a phonetic alphabet and
the use of writing in literary composition.
7. Status of Civilization. This period began with the use of a pho
netic alphabet and the art of producing literary records, and continues
to the present time.
Some modern anthropologists would prefer a different alignment of
the stages of the evolution of early human culture. A good example of this scheme has been outlined by Professor George Thomson:
The surviving tribes of modern times have been assigned to the fol
lowing categories in virtue of their predominant mode of food-production: Lower Hunters (food-gathering and hunting); Higher Hunters (hunting
and fishing); Pastoral (two grades); Agricultural (three grades). The Higher Hunter hunting grade is distinguished from the lower by the use of
the bow in addition to the spear. In the second pastoral grade, stock-raising
is supplemented by agriculture. Of the three agricultural grades, the first is
characterized by garden tillage, the second by field tillage, and in the third
field tillage is supplemented by stock-raising. This classification is, of
course, an abstraction. The categories are nor mutually exclusive. Thus, food gathering is maintained among the higher hunters and hunting
throughout the pastoral and agricultural grades, but in each case with di
minishing importance. Nor do they constitute a strict chronological se
quence. Stock-raising and tillage have been universally preceded by hunt
ing and that, in turn, by food gathering, but the relation between stock
raising and tillage is variable, being largely determined by geographical fac
tors. Some parts of the world are rich in domestic animals, others in cultivable plants. Others, again, are rich in both, and in these, the two modes of production may have been combined from the beginning in the form of
mixed farming. (248, p. 9)
The career of man up to the end of the New Stone Age was dis
cussed in a previous chapter. Following the stone ages, we learn from



178 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
the discoveries of the archaeologists that there were three metal ages in
the following sequence: Copper, Bronze, and Iron. According to Pro
fessor Robert Lowie, the Copper Age may be traced back to 4000
B.C., the Bronze Age started about 3000 B.C., and the Iron Age had
its beginning about 2000 B.C. Let us say frankly that this scheme is of
dubious validity; for central Africa, Polynesia, Finland, northern
Russia, southern India, Australia, North America, and Japan bypassed
the Copper and Bronze Ages and made the transit directly from stone
to iron. Bronze, even in cultures where iron was unknown, seems to
have been a luxury metal, restricted to aristocrats, kings, and priests.
The commoners, therefore, had to get along with implements of wood
and stone. The Iron Age was the key factor leading to the genesis of
civilization. The bearing of the discovery of iron smelting on the origin
of civilization was brilliantly stated by Morgan, as follows:
When the barbarian, advancing step by step, had discovered the native
metals, and learned to melt them in the crucible and to cast them in moulds;
when he had alloyed native copper with tin and produced bronze; and
finally, when by a still greater effort of thought, he had invented the fur
nace, and produced iron from the ore, nine-tenths of the battle for civiliza
tion was gained. Furnished with iron tools, capable of holding both an edge
and a point, mankind was certain of attaining to civilization. The produc
tion of iron was the event of events in human experience, without a parallel,
and without an equal, beside which all other inventions and discoveries
were inconsiderable, or at least, subordinate. Out of it came the metallic
hammer and anvil, the axe and the chisel, the plow with an iron point, the
iron sword; in fine, the basis of civilization which may be said to rest upon
this metal. The want of iron tools arrested the progress of mankind in bar
barism. There, they would have remained to the present hour had they
failed to bridge the chasm. It seems probable that the conception and the
process of smelting iron ore came but once to man. It would be a singular
satisfaction could it be known to what tribe and family we are indebted for
this knowledge, and with it for civilization. (177, pp. 42^-3)
Evidence garnered since Morgan's day seems to point to Central Af
rica as the place of origin of the Iron Age. The American anthropolo
gist, Professor A. F. Chamberlain, expressed himself on this question in
the following words:
The question of the origin of the art of iron smelting is now being
treated in detail by ethnologists and, while general agreement has not been
reached, the mass of evidence so far disclosed has convinced eminent men



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 179
of science like Boas and Von Luschan rhar the smelting of iron was first discovered by the African Negroes, from whom, by way of Egypt and Asia Minor, this art made its way into Europe and the rest of the Old World
(44).
In his capacity of visiting Professor of Anthropology to Atlanta Uni
versity, Franz Boas made the following declaration:
It seems likely that at a time when the European was still satisfied with rude stone tools, the African had invented or adopted the art of smelting
iron. Consider for a moment what this invention has meant for the advance
of the human race. As long as the hammer, knife, saw, drill, the spade, and the hoe had to be chipped out of stone, or had to be made of shell or hard
wood, effective industrial work was not impossible, but difficult. A great progress was made when copper found in large nuggets was hammered out into tools and later on shaped by melting, and when bronze was introduced;
but the true advancement of industrial life did not begin until the hard iron
was discovered. It seems not unlikely that the people who made the marvelous discovery of reducing iron ores by smelting were the African Negroes. Neither ancient Europe nor ancient Western Asia, nor ancient China knew the iron, and everything points to its introduction from Africa. At the
time of the great African discoveries toward the end of the past century, the
trade of the blacksmith was found all over Africa, from north to south, and from east to west. With his simple bellows and a charcoal fire, he reduced the ore that is found in many parts of the continent and forged implements
of great usefulness and beauty. (Atlanta University Leaflet No. 19, cited by W. E. B. DuBois in 74, pp. 114-15)
The Belgian anthropologist, Professor Emil Torday, traveled widely
in Africa, and he made the following statement in regard to the antiq
uity of iron culture in that continent:
That iron could be discovered by accident in Africa seems beyond doubt,
if this is so in any other parts of the world, 1 am not competent to say. 1 will only remind you that Schweinfurth and Petherick record the fact that in the northern part of East Africa smelting furnaces are worked without artificial air current and on the other hand, Stuhlmann and Kollmann found near Victoria Nyanza that the natives simply mixed powdered ore with
charcoal and by introduction of air currents obtained the metal. These simple processes make it simple that iron should have been discovered in East or Central Africa. No bronze implements have ever been found in black
Africa; had the Africans received iron from the Egyptians, bronze would
have preceded this metal and all traces of it would not have disappeared.
Black Africa was, for a long time, an exporter of iron, and even in the
twelfth century, exports to India and Java are recorded by Idrisi.



180 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
It is difficult to imagine that Egypt should have obtained it from Europe
where the oldest find (in Hallstadt) cannot be of an earlier period than 800
B.C., or from Asia, where iron is not known before 1000 B.C., . . . while
iron beads have been only recently discovered by Messrs. G. A. Wain
wright and Bushe Fox in a predynastic grave, and where a piece of this
metal, possibly a tool, was found in the masonry of the great pyramid.
(Professor Emil Torday, in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Insti
tute, Volume XLIII, pp. 414-15)
That iron tools were employed in the building of the Great Pyramid
was stated as a fact by Herodotus; and on statements of fact we may
safely rely on the judgment of the Father of History (who also might
properly be called "the Father of Anthropology"). In the opinion of
Professor Haddon, "The writings of Herodotus [C. 480-425 B.C.] are
a veritable storehouse of information from the highest civilizations
down to the veriest savagery, and his work has lost none of its freshness
or value through lapse of time. As a matter of fact, modern investiga
tions, carried out in the areas treated of by him, more frequently
confirm and amplify rather than refute his statements." (103, pp. 100
1) August Mencken, a civil engineer of many years' experience, wrote
a fine little book on the construction of the Great Pyramid, and in this
work he expressed the opinion that "little is known about the tools
used, but the cutting points of stone picks and the edges of chisels were
probably made of steel." (170, p. 56) Certain modern writers state
dogmatically that implements of iron and steel were unknown in an
cient Egypt, but this position is certainly erroneous, and the evidence is
nor lacking to show that the contrary opinion is the true one. More
than a century ago, an Egyptologist of high repute made the following
statement:
Iron and copper mines are found in the Egyptian desert, which were worked in old times; and the monuments of Thebes, and even the tombs about Memphis, dating more than 4000 years ago, represent butchers
sharpening their knives on a round bar of metal attached to their apron,
which from its blue color, can only be steel; and the distinction between the bronze and iron weapons in the tomb of Rameses III, one painted red, the
other blue, leaves no doubt of both having been used (as in Rome) at the same periods. In Ethiopia, iron was much more abundant than in Egypt, and Herodotus states that copper was a rare metal there; though we may
doubt his assertion of prisoners in that country having been bound with fet
ters of gold." (275, Vol. II, p. 155)



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 181
We shall have more to say about this subject in the next chapter.
Among the prerequisites of civilization is an adequate food supply.
It, in turn, depends upon the domestication of certain plants and ani
mals. A stable civilization demands a cultivated plant with a high yield
of storable food, and a draft animal for carrying heavy loads and pulling
carts and plows. Besides this, av dependable animal or plant source of
fibcii ii> needed. 1 he chief available plants are the cereals, potatoes, and
soya beans; and these vary considerably in nutritional value. Maize, in
contrast to wheat or oats, is very deficient in Vitamin B5. A people de
pending largely on a maize diet would be subject to attacks of pellagra,
a skin disorder brought on by a deficiency of Vitamin B5 in the food
supply. "This is probably one reason," declared Professor Haldane,
"why the maize civilizations of Central America never reached the
level of the wheat, barley and rice civilizations of the Old World."
(107, p. 54)
Professor Vavilov and a party of Russian scientists have followed the
modern varieties of wheat back to two primitive groups of wheat, each
of which has been traced to a center of origin. One center was located
in Abyssinia, and the other in or near southeastern Afghanistan. The
Ethiopian center is thought to have been the original source of the agri
culture upon which the civilization of Egypt was based. The Afghan
center is regarded as the primitive source of the Mesopotamian and In
dian wheats, and of the principal varieties now grown in Europe and
North America. Other important food plants have been traced back to
these African and Asiatic centers. Hard wheat, barley, and coffee are of
Abyssinian origin. Soft wheat, turnips, rye, perhaps carrots and some
types of beans, lentils, cotton, and flax have been traced back to the Af
ghan center. Rice may have originated in northeastern India and vari
ous fruit trees in Persia. Evidence uncovered in Neolithic tombs in
Egypt show that barley, rye, millet, flax, and wheat were cultivated in
the Nile Valley before the dawn of civilization. Animal husbandry also
flourished in the same region, for short-horned cattle, sheep, and goats
were bred and the donkey was domesticated and employed as a beast of
burden. Attempts were likewise made to tame the antelope, deer, ga
zelle, and ibex. The establishment of agriculture on a large scale and
the extensive development of animal husbandry, together with the ac
quisition of metal tools, enabled ancient peoples to settle permanently
in villages; and these innovations induced a marked division of labor be
tween the sexes. The women specialized in the rearing of children,



182 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
cooking, spinning, weaving, and truck gardening; while the men went
in for hunting, fighting, tending of livestock, and the sowing and plow
ing of the fields. In these early days of agriculture, the land was the
common property of the clan or tribe; likewise, the first herds of
domesticated animals were owned collectively. But with the increase of
productivity, it was found expedient on grounds of efficiency periodi
cally to allot plots of land to individual cultivators, and this led in time
to the institution of private property. In a similar fashion, cattle, too,
became recognized as private property; although the pastures, as a rule,
continued to be held in common ownership by the group. Private
property did not turn out to be an unmixed blessing; for intertribal
conflicts over land and cattle led to warfare. This, in turn, brought
about slavery. Large-scale farming and the tending of herds and flocks
involved a lot of hard labor; so, when a powerful tribe subdued a
weaker foe, it became customary for the victors to reduce their van
quished foes to the status of servitude. It was not only more humane
but also more economical to exploit the labor of the conquered enemy
rather than to take his life! Although in its origin slavery may have
been an improvement over murder or cannibalism, in the long run, as
the annals of history show, it became a great curse to the human race.
The birth of civilization brought about profound changes in human so
ciety, such as the passage from primitive communism to private prop
erty and slavery, from magic to religion, from food gathering to agri
culture, from mother right to father right, and from relative peace to
chronic warfare. An interesting feature of the transition from barba
rism to civilization was the decline of the matriarchal family and the
rise of the patriarchal family.
When tribes of various localities formed the habit of assembling pe
riodically at a common meeting place for purposes of trade, worship,
and deliberation on problems of mutual interest, the city resulted. The
tribal chief of greatest power and influence became the ruler of the
city-state; and these early rulers were generally priest kings, and estab
lished their headquarters in temples, which were not only places of
worship but also warehouses. In later times, as trade and commerce de
veloped, and metal currency was invented, the temple became the first
bank. The necessity of keeping records in the process of operating the
early temple and city administrations was a powerful factor in the ori
gin and development of the art of writing, one of the key foundations
of civilization. As to just where and when civilization commenced,
there is no agreement among the recognized authorities. "All we can



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 183
say," Lord Raglan suggested, "is that its founders must have possessed
all that there then was of knowledge, but at the same time, must have
succeeded in preserving or freeing themselves from that subservience
to the past which presents all savages and indeed, the great majority of
the human race, from originating anything." (194, p. 182) In the con
siderable literature on the history of civilization, there is much discus
sion concerning the bearing of environment and race on cultural ori
gins. A well-known example of this type of literature is a multivolumed
work entitled A Study of History, by Professor Arnold J. Toynbee.
We are told in this study of history that "the Minoan civilization was a
response to the challenge of the sea, the Egyptian civilization, a re
sponse to the challenge of the Nile." (251, p. 438)
This is a fair statement of the environmental theory of the origin of
civilization. This hypothesis may still have some advocates among his
torians, but it has no defenders of any consequence among anthropolo
gists. It is a truism to say that good harbors make a maritime civilization
possible, but we have no evidence that they produce such a culture.
Professor Roland B. Dixon, of Harvard University, has carefully stud
ied the role of environment in the building of cultures, and he reached
conclusions diametrically opposite to those of Toynbee:
A well indented coastline with many harbors and inlets, tends, it is said,
to develop seafaring life, and numerous striking instances of people with
maritime cultures living on such coasts are pointed out. Bur many equally
striking exceptions exist, as, for example in Tasmania, where with just such
a coastline, the people were virtually destitute of any form of craft. Again,
islands are said often to develop as centers of maritime culture, with far
reaching trade and commerce. The instances of Crete, the British Isles and
Japan are cited in confirmation of this. It is true that Crete was 2 striking example of such development; it is not so today. The two other cases must
be also accepted with reserve, for England did not become a maritime
country until Elizabethan times, when economic influences external to it
self and unrelated to its insular character, were instrumental in bringing about the change. Japan's development as a maritime and commercial state
is really only a matter of the last fifty years, and has depended more on her
far reaching adoption of European culture than on the insular character of
her environment. (68, pp. 16-17)
The importance of the environment is not being denied. We merely
point out that it acts as a limiting agent rather than a determining one.
The late J. M. Robertson directed our attention to the fact that pri
mary civilizations arise in territories favorable to the regular production



184 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
of an abundant food supply, and lying inland, so as nor to be exposed to
piratical incursions. Robertson observed that a fertile coast land could
be defended only by a strong community. (See 209, Chapter IV.) On
the other hand, the protection of the environment must not be so ex
treme as to produce complete cultural isolation. What is demanded is
adequate protection, but not paralyzing isolation. The true role of the
environment as a factor in the origin of cultures was illustrated by An
drew Reid Cowan in an examination of the civilization of Egypt:
The population had perhaps almost nothing to fear from the nomad; less
probably in the Nile Valley than in the Tigris-Euphrates system; causing Egypt perhaps to be won earlier than Mesopotamia. There is almost no nourishment for man in the unmitigated desert surrounding Egypt. The sea
in ancient times was a sufficient barrier and it was only in Greek times that
it was effectively penetrated. (53, pp. 46-47)
The idea that certain varieties of the human race have a highly de
veloped capacity for building civilization, while others possess this tal
ent in a lesser degree, or lack it altogether, is a complete fallacy, having
no foundation in fact. Professor Toynbee has adopted this fallacy in
toto. He argues that, up to our own time, twenty-one civilizations have
flourished in various parts of the world; and we are told that: "The
Black Race has not helped to create any civilization, while the Polyne
sian White Race has helped to create one civilization, the Brown Race two, the Yellow Race three, the Red Race and the Nordic White Race,
four apiece, the Alpine White Race, nine, and the Mediterranean
White Race, ten." (251, p. 234) This sort of propaganda may be rel
ished by historians as a class, but anthropologists and archaeologists will
reject it; for they know better. We do not propose to dwell on all of
the numerous errors in Toynbee's statement—that would be a waste of
time and space—but we should like to note the absolutely false asser
tion that the black race has made no creative contribution to civiliza
tion.
Herr Eugen Georg, an able German historical scholar, disagreed
with the professor absolutely on this point. He declared:
A splendid era of black seems to have preceded all the later races! There must once have been a tremendous Negro expansion, since the original masters of all the lands between Iberia and the Cape of Good Hope and
East India were primitive and probably dwarfed black men. We have long
had proof that a primitive Negroid race of pigmies once lived around the Mediterranean. Blacks were the first to plow the mud of the Nile, they



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 185
were the dark skinned, curly haired Kushires. Blacks were masters of Su
meria and Babylon before it became the country of the four tongues. And in India, the kingdom of the Dravidian Monarchs, the black and godless
enemies existed until the period of written history. Many thousands of
years before Christ, great cultures bloomed in the rank, rich valleys of the
Yang-tse-kiang, the Ho, Indus, Euphrates, Nile and Congo rivers, while
Oceania, Central America, the highlands of the Andes were centers of
human settlement. As monumental as if planted on earth by the gods them
selves, the Egyptian culture gleamed in iridescent holiness, sustained by the
despotic will of omnipotent Pharaohs. (96, pp. 44-45)
A similar opinion was advanced by Professor Ernest Albert Hooton,
anthropologist of Harvard University:
Archaeology has brought to light, on the banks of the Niger in West Af
rica, in the upper part of the Nile Valley and in Rhodesia, extensive monu
mental remains of great and extinct civilizations which seem to have been Negro or Negroid. The Negroes have been for an indeterminate period of time very skilled iron workers and may have developed for themselves the
knowledge of smelting iron ores. A large share of the responsibility for the
great civilization of India must be assigned to Negroes, since there is un
questionably a very strong Negroid strain in the Indian population. (120, pp. 591-92)
Herodotus, who spent two years traveling in Egypt in the fifth cen
tury B.C., had no hesitation in assigning the ancient Egyptians to the
black race. H. G. Wells noted: ''Herodotus remarked upon a series of
resemblances between the Colchians and the Egyptians." (266, p. 184)
But Wells could not find the space to actually cite the remarks of the
Father of History. In commenting on the Colchians, Herodotus com
pared them with the Egyptians:
There can be no doubt that the Colchians are an Egyptian race. Before I heard any mention of the fact from others, I had remarked it myself. My own conjectures were founded first on the fact that they are black skinned
and have woolly hair, which certainly amounts to but little, since several
other nations are so too; but further, and more especially, on the circum
stance that the Colchians, the Egyptians, and the Ethiopians are the only
nations who have practiced circumcision from the earliest times. I will add a further proof to the identity of the Egyptians and the Colchians. These two
nations weave their linen in exactly the same way, and this is a way entirely
unknown to the rest of the world; they also in their whole mode of life, and
in their language, resemble one another. (117, Book II, p. 1 14-15)



186 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
The descendants of these ancient Colchians still survive in the Ab
khazian Autonomous Republic, which is in the southern part of the So
viet Union, and their land is often referred to as the Black Soviet. (An
interesting account of these exotic people and their land may be found
in 212, p. 291.)
Some authorities have held that the civilization of Egypt is the oldest
of the river valley cultures of the Old World; whereas others awarded
that priority to Western Asia, or India. It has also been suggested by
certain students that, since all these cultures possess certain similar
traits, they may have all evolved from an older common civilization.
There has also been considerable disagreement concerning the proper
racial classification of the original founders of civilization; some authori
ties assigning them to the caucasoid or white race and others to the ne
groid or black race, or to an intermediate mixed brown race. So we
shall have to discuss briefly the controversial question of the classifica
tion of the so-called races of man.
The early modern classifications of the varieties of the human species
were geographical in nature. The famous naturalist, Linnaeus ( 1 707
1778), listed four races according to continent: European (white), Af
rican (black), Asiatic (yellow), and American (red). Blumenbach, in
1775, added a fifth type, the Oceanic (brown) race. In geography texts
of fifty years ago the races of mankind were classified as Ethiopian
(black), Caucasian (white), American (red), Mongolian (yellow), and
Malayan (brown). The French naturalist, Baron Cuvier, in 1800
traced all varieties of men back to Ham, Shern, and Japheth, the three
sons of Noah. After that day, race classification developed into a con
test. By 1873, Haeckel had discovered, or invented, no fewer than
twelve distinct races of mankind, and this was only a starter. A few
years later, he had uncovered twenty-two more races, bringing the
grand total of human types up to thirty-four. Deniker, in 1900, hit the
jackpot by postulating the human species as existing in the form of six
grand divisions, seventeen divisions, and twenty-nine races. Despite all
this industry among anthropological taxonomists, there is as yet no
agreement on the proper classification of racial types. Professor Franz
Boas of Columbia University decided that the human race consisted of only two sub-types; and this scheme has been admirably outlined by
Professor George A. Dorsey:
Open your atlas to a map of the world. Look at the Indian Ocean—on
the west, Africa; on the north, the three great southern peninsulas of Asia;



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 187
on the east, a chain of great islands terminating in Australia. Wherever that
Indian Ocean touches land, it finds dark-skinned people with strongly de
veloped jaws, relatively long arms and kinky or frizzly hair. Call that the
Indian Ocean or Negroid division of the human race.
Now look at the Pacific Ocean—on one side, the two Americas; on the
other, Asia. (Geographically, Europe is a rail to the Asiatic kite.) The abo
riginal population of the Americas and of Asia, north of its southern penin
sula, was a light skinned people with straight hair, relatively short arms and a face without prominent jaws. Call that the Pacific Ocean or Mongoloid
division. (72, pp. 44-45)
Professor Alfred L Kroeber decided that the peoples of Europe have
bleached out enough to merit classification as a distinct racial group. This would add a European or Caucasoid division to the Negroid and
Mongoloid types recognized by Professor Boas. This tri-racial classi
fication has found widespread acceptance. The best statement of this
system was given by Professor Barnes: lw The yellow race is not only
yellow in color, but also has a very round brachyccphalic head and very
straight hair, round in cross section. The black race stands at the oppo
site extreme, with a very long dolichocephalic head and curly hair, flat
in cross section. Between these two extremes falls the white race with
an intermediate head form and wavy hair, elliptical in cross section."
(8, pp. 21-22) Orientalists have formed two schools of thought concerning the
location of the world's earliest civilization. The Panegyptians claim pri
ority for the Nile Valley; whereas the Panbab) lonians make a similar
claim for Mesopotamia. But some experts have held that an earlier
common culture would be a more reasonable hypothesis. The fol
lowing opinion was expressed by a distinguished Orientalist: "It would be wrong to say that the Egyptians borrowed from the Sumerians or the Sumerians from the Egyptians, but it may be submitted that the lit
erati of both peoples borrowed their theological systems from some
common but exceedingly ancient source. The similarity between the
two companies of gods is too close to be accidental/ 1
(31, p. 155) A pioneer American Egyptologist advanced the following view:
In both Babylonia and Egypt, the convenient and basic number (360), of fundamental importance in the division of the circle, and therefore, in geography, astronomy and time measurement, had its origin in the number of days in the year in the earliest known form of the calendar. While its use seems to be older in Egypt than in Babylonia, there is no way to determine
with certainty that we owe it exclusively to either of these two countries. A
common origin older than cither is possible. ( 1 7, pp. 69-70)



188 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
"It may be," to circ an English scholar, "as some indeed suspect, that
the science which we see ar the dawn of recorded history was not
science at its dawn, but the remnants of the science of some great and
as yet untraced civilization. Where, however, is the seat of the civiliza
tion to be located? 1
' (224, p. 15)
A number of scientists and scholars in ancient and modern times
have concluded that the world's first civilization was the creation of a
people known as the Ethiopians. The name Ethiopian we owe to the
ancient Greeks; for when these Hellenes first came in contact with the
dusky inhabitants of Africa and Asia, they called them the burnt faces.
In Greek, the word for burnt was Ethios, and the word for face was
ops; so ethios plus ops became Ethiopian. The Greeks thought that these
peoples developed their dark complexions because they lived closer to
the sun than the fairer inhabitants of Europe. We have been told by a
well-informed modern authority:
The fame of the Ethiopians was widespread in ancient history. Herod
otus describes them as "the tallest, most beautiful and long-lived of the
human races," and before Herodotus, Homer, in even more flattering lan
guage described them as "the most just of men; the favorites of the gods."
The annals of all the great early nations of Asia Minor are full of them. The
Mosaic records allude to them frequently; but while they are described as
the most powerful, the most just, and the most beautiful of the human race,
they are constantly spoken of as black, and there seems to be no other con
clusion to be drawn than that at that remote period of history, the leading
race of the Western World was a black race. (146, p. 221)
We learn from the works of Homer and Herodotus that all the peo
ples of the following territories were considered to be Ethiopians: The
Sudan, Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, Western Asia, India.
Today, we think of the Ethiopians as being exclusively an African
people, but in ancient times the case was quite different. An illuminat
ing discourse concerning this matter has been presented by a recog
nized modern authority on Ethiopian history, which we are pleased to
quote:
It seems certain that classical historians and geographers called the whole
region from India to Egypt, both countries inclusive, by the name of Ethiopia, and in consequence they regarded all the dark skinned and black peoples who inhabited it as Ethiopians. Mention is made of Eastern and West
ern Ethiopians, and it is probable that the Easterners were Asiatics and the Westerners Africans. In the present work which 1 have called A History of



THE ORIGIN OK CIVILIZATION 189
Ethiopia, I have made no attempt ro describe the history of that large por
tion of the earth's surface which the Greeks called Kthiopia, bur only rhar
comparatively small section of it which is today named, both by large num
bers of Orientals and by Europeans generally, Abvssinia, and also the coun
try of Kush, which is now known as Nubia. . . . The idcntificarion of
Kush with Abyssinia under the name of Kthiopia made bv the rranslarors of
the Erhiopic version of the Bible in the 5th (or 6rh) century has, for many
centuries been accepted by the Abyssinians. And to this day, the Abyssin
ian, in reciting Psalm KXVIII (V. 3 1 ), says "Kthiopia shall make her hands reach unto God."
During the preparation of this work I have been driven to the conclusion
that the Kthiopians whose manners and customs have been so fully de
scribed by Herodotus, Diodorus, Strabo, Pliny and others, were not Abvs
sinians at all, but the natives of Upper Nubia, and the Island of Meroe, and
the Negroes and Negroid peoples who inhabited the hot, moist lands which
extend from Southern Abyssinia to the Kquator. The hieroglyphic inscrip
rions of rhe VI, XII and XVIII Dynasties prove rhar caravans Travelled
from Egypr ro rhe counrries round abour rhe Blue Nile, and ro regions
much furrher ro rhe sourh, bur rhere is no menrion in rhem of any counrry

abour Abyssinia, rhough borh rhe Assyrians and rhe Hebrews knew of rhe
existence of Kush, and that it lay to the south of Egypt. (33, Vol. I, pp. vii
and viii)
The ancient Greek bard, Homer, spoke of the Ethiopians as divided
into two groups and dwelling "at the ends of the earth, towards the set
ting and the rising sun." This passage has been variously interpreted.
Some students have held that it merely referred to the Ethiopians south
of Egypt, as being divided by the Nile River, some living along the
west bank and others on the east bank. Other students explained the
Homeric reference as relating to the east and west coasts of Africa with
the Ethiopians dwelling on both coasts, and divided only by the vast
extent of the African continent. Another opinion was offered by Epho
rus, and has been transmitted to posterity by Strabo, that all the south
coasts of both Africa and Asia were inhabired bv Ethiopians, and that
the African Ethiopians and their Asiatic brothers were separated by the
Arabian Gulf, which separated the two continents. The traditions con
cerning King Memnon lead us to suspect a close cultural connection



190 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
between the Ethiopians of Africa and those of western Asia, for ac
cording to Hesiod, Pindar, and Aeschylus, Memnon, king of Ethiopia,
was the son of a Cissian woman, and the Cissians were an Asiatic peo
ple; and we learn from The History of Herodotus that Memnon was the
founder of the city of Susa, the ancient capital of Elam. We have been
told that he led a combined army of Susianians (FJamitcs) and Ethiopi
ans to the assistance of King Priam (his father's brother) during the
Trojan War, and that after distinguished military conduct, he perished
in one of the battles before Troy. This same Memnon was claimed as a
king by the Nilotic Ethiopians, and was identified with the Pharaoh
Amenhotep 111 by the Egyptians. There is a tradition that his expedi
tion started from the African Ethiopia and proceeded by way of Egypt
to its destination. Palaces said to have been erected by King Memnon
have been reported from both Egypt and Elam, and it has been said
that a tribe called Memnones dwelt in the vicinity of Meroe. Memnon
hence unites both the eastern and western Ethiopians, and we think he
is best regarded, not as an historical personage, but as a culture hero,
personifying the ethnic identity of the two groups of Ethiopians. Fur
ther proof could be adduced of the Greek belief in an Asiatic Ethiopia,
stretching from Arabia to India, along the shores of the Indian Ocean,
were it necessary. On two occasions, Herodotus mentioned the Ethio
pians of Asia, whom he carefully distinguished from those of Africa;
and Ephorus, as we have already noted, extended the Ethiopians along
the entire coasts of the lands bordering on the Indian Ocean.
The traditions of the ancient Armenians are in harmony with those of the Greeks.- According to the Armenians, the name of Kush, or
Ethiopia, applied to Persia, Media, Elam, and Aria, or the whole region
between the Indus and the Tigris rivers. Moses of Khorene, an Arme
nian historian, identified King Belus of Babylon with Nimrod, and he
held that Nimrod was a grandson of Kush (Ethiopia), and a son of
Mizraim (Egypt). In this way, a close kinship was shown between the
Ethiopians of Africa and Asia.
We should not overlook the ancient Hebrew tradition as preserved
in Genesis, where we are informed that the sons of Eiam were Kush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan; and the Kush begat Nimrod, and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech and Akkad and Kalneh
in the land of Shinar. Here an ancient Babylonian kingdom is traced to
a Kushite or Ethiopian origin, and is culturally connected with
Mizraim (Egypt), Phut (Central Africa), and Canaan (Palestine). The
plain meaning of these traditions, as we see it, is that these various



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 191
groups of peoples were all regarded as children of Ham, and rhar the
earliest people of Babylonia were a branch of the Kushites, or Ethiopi
ans, connected in some degree with the Egyptians, Canaanites, and
Libyans, but still more closely akin to the people who anciently dwelt
along the banks of the Upper Nile. When the early inhabitants of
Chaldea are said to have belonged to the same racial group as the dwell
ers upon the Upper Nile, the question suggests itself as to which were
the indigenous inhabitants and which were the colonists? Were the
shores of the Persian Gulf the original home of the Kushites, from
whence they spread eastward and westward, in one direction to Elam,
Persia, and on to India; and in the other, to Arabia and the East African
coast? Or shall we surmise that the migration proceeded in only one di
rection; and that the Kushites, starting from the country south of
Egypt, sent out colonies to the south coast of Arabia, and from there
into the lands bordering on the Persian Gulf, occupying Surner and
Elam, and thence spreading through Kerman and Mekran to the re
gions bordering on the Indus River? Something may be said in behalf
of either hypothesis.
The Biblical genealogy of the sons of Ham derives Nimrod from
Kush, not Kush from Nimrod. This tradition, as given in the tenth
chapter of Genesis, shows the Hamites as starting from Africa (the
home of the children of Ham), in two different migrations: one
through southern Arabia to Mesopotamia and the other from Egypt
through the land of Canaan into Syria. The antiquity of civilization in
the Nile Valley, which preceded by ages that of the plain of Shinar, is a
persuasive argument in favor of these early migrations having been
from west to east; and the monuments and traditions of the Euphratean
peoples themselves present indications of an East African origin of their
culture. It seems most probable that the people represented in Genesis by the legendary hero, Nimrod, and among the Greeks by the eponym
of Belus, migrated from East Africa by way of Arabia to the Tigris-Eu
phrates Valley, in times prior to recorded history. In 1854, a well
known German scholar, Baron Bunsen, in the third volume of his Phi
losophy of Universal History, declared that Nimrod, the legendary fa
ther of the Babylonians, was in no way related to Kush (Ethiopia). It is
true, said the Baron, that they had come into Mesopotamia from Af
rica, and so, having come from the land of Kush, they were called
Kushites. But the expression was purely geographical. From a racial
standpoint they were akin neither to the Egyptians nor the Ethiopians.
This conclusion was vigorously contested by the English Orientalist,



192 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
General Sir Henry Rawlinson, on both archaeological and philological
grounds. His findings were well presented by his celebrated brother,
Canon George Rawlinson of Canterbury, as follows:
A laborious study of the primitive language of Chaldea, led him (Sir
Henry Rawlinson) to the conviction that the dominant race in Babylonia at
the earliest time to which the monuments reached back was Kushite. He
found the vocabulary of the primitive race to be decidedly Kushite or Ethi
opian, and he was able to interpret the inscriptions chiefly by the aid which
was furnished to him from published works on the Galla (Abyssinian) and Mahra (South Arabian) dialects. He noted moreover, a considerable resemblance in the system of writing which the primitive race employed, and that
which was established from a very remote date in Egypt. Both were picto
rial; both to a certain extent symbolic; both in some instances used identi
cally the same symbols. Again, he found words in use among the primitive Babylonians and their neighbors and kinsmen, the Susianians, which
seemed to be identical with ancient Egyptian or Ethiopic roots. The root
hyk or hak, which Manetho interprets as king, and which is found in the well known Hyksos or Shepherd Kings, appeared in Babylonian and Susianian royal names under the form of Khak, and as the terminal element
which is its position also in royal Ethiopic names. The name Tirkak is com
mon to the royal lists of Susiana and Ethiopia, as that of Nimrod is to the
royal names of Babylon and Egypt. The sun god is called Ra in Egyptian, and Ra was the Kushite name of the supreme god of the Babylonians. . . .
The author of Genesis unites together as members of the same ethnic fam
ily the Egyptians, the Ethiopians, the Southern Arabians and the primitive
inhabitants of Babylon. Modern ethnology finds, in the localities indicated,
a number of languages, partly ancient, partly modern, which have common
characteristics, and which evidently constitute one group. Egyptian, an
cient and modern, Ethiopic, as represented by the Galla, Agau, etc.,
Southern Arabian (Himyaric and Mahra), and ancient Babylonian, are dis
covered to be cognate tongues, varieties of one original form of speech.
(201, pp. 212-14)
The people that Canon Rawlinson and his brother called primitive
or Proto-Chaldeans are by modern authorities named Sumerians. In
another work, Canon Rawlinson describes them in the following terms: "This element . . . was predominantly Kushite. ... In Su
siana (Elam), where the Kushite blood was maintained in tolerable pu
rity, there was, if we may trust the Assyrian remains, a very decided
prevalency of a Negro type of countenance. The head was covered
with short crisp curls; the eye was large, the nose and mouth nearly in
the same line, the lips thick." (200, Vol. II, p. 500)



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 193
So much propaganda of a racist nature has enrcred into the writings
of some of the best modern scholars that the reader, or student, must
constantly be on the watch for it. For instance, Professor Charles Sei
gnobos of the University of Paris wrote a scholarly book entitled His
tory of Ancient Civilization. In the second chapter of that work, we are
told: "Almost all civilized peoples belong to the white race. The people of
other races have remained savage or barbarian, like the men of prehistoric
times. "And immediately following the above announcement we learn:
"It is within the limits of Asia and Africa that the first civilized peoples
had their development-the Egyptians in the Nile Valley, the Chaldeans in
the plains of the Euphrates. They were people of sedentary and peaceful
pursuits. Their skin was dark, the hair short and thick, the lips strong. No
body knows their origin with exactness and scholars are not agreed on the
name to give them {some terming them Cushites, others Hamites). Later,
between the 20th and 25th centuries B.C. came bands of martial shep
herds who had spread over all Europe and the west of Asia—the Ary
ans and the Semites." (222, p. 17)
We shall meet with more of this combination of double-think and
double-talk as we proceed in considering the origin of civilization. A
sounder appreciation of the ancient Ethiopian contribution to early civ
ilization was given by an English anthropologist who spent most of his
life in the Orient. We refer to Major General J. G. R. Forlong, and
the following extract is from his major work, Rivers of Life:
It was undoubtedly Kushites who rendered possible the Aryan advance,
and who played the part of a civilizing Rome thousands of years before
Roma's birth. It was their vast mythology and strange legends that passed as
Lord Bacon wrote "like light air into the flutes of Grecians, there to be
modulated as best suited Grecian fancies." Indeed, it is manifest from many
old writings, that it was their tales, myths, traditions and histories that lay at
the base of the Western World's thought and legendary lore. These so impressed all subsequent races and entered so deeply and minutely into all Aryan mythologies that many writers now think Aryans can only claim to have added to the superstructure and complexion of Ethiopian myths and
mythical history; and let us remember that active Aryan life and mythologies began at least 3000 years B.C. when high Asia . . . , becoming too
cramped for this race, they were pressing southward to India and Ariana and to the west generally. Then and there must Aryans have met with
Ethiopian civilization, as did Semites, when these began to group them
selves into nations about a thousand years later, or say, 2000 B.C. They
were all builders on old Kushite foundations. (82, Vol. II, pp. 403-4)



194 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
The ancient culture which we have discussed in this chapter has in
spired a considerable literature; but we believe the most comprehensive
study of this old civilization was that pursued by Professor W. J. Perry
of the University of Manchester. His most important works are The
Megalithic Culture of Indonesia, Manchester, 1918; 77?^ Children of the
Sun: A Study in the Early History of Civilization, London and New
York, 1923, 2nd edition, 1926; The Growth of Civilization, London,
1924, 2nd edition, 1926; and 77?^ Pr'nnordial Ocean, London, 1935.
Perry has called this ancient cultural complex the Archaic Civilization,
and its most important elements, we are convinced, are the following
features: (1) the practice of agriculture by means of irrigation; (2) the
carving of stone images, and the employment of stone in constructing
pyramids, dolmens, rock-cut tombs, and stone circles; (3) metal work
ing; (4) rne manufacture of pottery; (5) the practice of making
mummies; (6) the worship of the Great Mother Goddess; (7) rites in
volving human sacrifice, connected with agriculture and the cult of the
Great Mother; (8) the worship of the heavenly bodies, such as stars,
planets, the moon, and the' sun; (9) a ruling class split into two divi
sions; (a) one branch of the ruling class connected with the sky-world
and claiming kinship with the gods and engaging in incestuous unions;
(b) the other branch of the ruling class associated with the underworld;
(10) the survival of the Totemic complex; (11) the dual organization;
operative in the social structure and in political affairs; (12) the preva
lence of the institution of Mother-Right, in which descent in the fe
male line is connected with the succession of kings in the female line;
(13) the presence of the institution of Divine Kingship, especially in
Africa.
The archaic civilization has been traced back to ancient Egypt by
Elliot Smith and Perry; and they have contended that this culture in
ancient times spread from the Nile to Crete and western Asia. Then,
after traveling through South Asia to Indonesia and the islands of the
Pacific, it finally appeared in South and Central America, culminating
in the civilizations of the lncas, the Mayas, the Aztecs. Other anthro
pologists of the difTusionist school, such as Lord Raglan and Professor
W. H. R. Rivers, seem to favor an Asiatic origin of the archaic civiliza
tion. That all the later cultures of the world can be traced back to an
older common civilization we are firmly convinced. We have also been
convinced by abundant and impressive evidence that this original early culture was far more ancient than those of Egypt and Mesopotamia.



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 195
The ancient Egyptians, as we have already noted, were considered by
the scholars of Greece and Rome to be Ethiopians. The Ethiopian
theory of the origin of civilization has been given favorable considera
tion by such outstanding scholars as Count Yolnev, Sir 1 lenry Rawlin
son, Professor A. H. L Heeren, General J. G. R. Forlong, Gerald
Massey, Dr. Albert Churchward, and fast, but not least, Eadv Lugard. The monumental works of Gerald Massey have not received the
careful study they so eminently deserve. Massey was distinguished in
his day as a social reformer, poet, philologist, and Egyptologist. His
outstanding publications are A Book of the Beginnings, two volumes,
1881; The Natural Genesis, two volumes, 1883; and Ancient Egypt, two
volumes, 1907. In his later years of research, Massey was joined by Dr.
Albert Churchward, whose principal works are The Signs and Symbols
of Primordial Man, 2nd edition, London, 1913, and The Origin and Ev
olution of the Human Race, London, 192 1
Most academic authorities dismiss the scholars named above as
visionaries, but there are a few independent thinkers who argue that
the minority party has a good case, and that it deserves a hearing. We
should like to recommend to the attention of the reader a remarkable
book, Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings: Evidence of Advanced Civilization
in the Ice Age, by Professor Charles H. Hapgood, F.R.G.S. This book
is scholarly and well documented, and among the conclusions ex
pressed in that work are the following examples: kC The idea of a simple
linear development of society from the culture of Paleolithic (Old
Stone Age), through the successive stages of the Neolithic (New Stone
Age), Bronze and Iron Ages must be given up. . . . We shall now as
sume that some 20,000 or more years ago, while paleolithic peoples
held out in Europe, more advanced cultures existed elsew here on the
earth and that we have inherited a part of what they once possessed,
passed down from people to people. " (1 12, pp. 193-94)
In studying the history of ancient nations, such as Egypt in the Nile
Valley, and of Sumer in western Asia, the student finds certain ques
tions arising which cannot readily be put aside. For these old nations
seem to have no beginning. They are fully developed when they first
appear on the stage of history; and after that the pattern seems to be
that of a decline and fall. This point will be dealt with in some detail in
our next chapter, which will treat of the evolution of civilization. The
orthodox scholars in the fields of anthropology and history, when faced
with embarrassing questions, either ignore them or refer to the ques



196 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
tioners as visionaries or crackpots. But the critics of scientific orthodoxy
refuse to be shouted down; and they cannot all be dismissed as idle
dreamers.
Scholars such as Massey and Churchward have adduced impressive
evidence that both man and civilization were cradled in Africa; but
their labors have been mainly disregarded for obvious reasons. We live
in a culture today where even the educated classes have been taught
that Africa is the Dark Continent, that the peoples of Africa were and
are savages and that they have not made any worthwhile contribution
to human advancement. This outlook, of course, is a vicious and un
warranted caricature of reality, but it enjoys the sanction of powerful
vested interests. The African origin of the human race has been so well
established by the discoveries of Broom, Dart, Leakey, and others that
their critics have more or less been silenced. The African origin of civi
lization is still challenged. Although Egypt is an African country, there
are still scholars who claim that the Egyptians were not an indigenous
African people. Yet, the facts are not in dispute. This accurate state
ment was made by Gerald Massey as far back as 1881: "Egypt is often
called Kam, the black land, and Kam does signify black; the name
probably applied to the earlier inhabitants whose type is the Kam or
Ham of the Hebrew writers." (164, Vol. I, p. 4)
"It will be maintained in this book that the oldest mythology, reli
gion, symbols, language, had their birthplace in Africa, that the primi
tive race of Kam came thence, and the civilization attained in Egypt
emanated from that country and spread over the world. The most rea
sonable view on the evolutionary theory ... is that the black race is
the most ancient, and that Africa is the primordial home." (164, Vol. I,
p. 18) "The Hebrew scriptures, among their other fragments of ancient
lore, are very emphatic in deriving the line of Mizraim from Ham or
Kam, the black type coupled with Kush, another form of the black.
They give no countenance to the theory of Asiatic origin for the Egyp
tians. In the Biblical account of the generations of Noah, Mizraim is
the son of Ham, i.e., of Kam, the black race." (164, Vol. I, p. 33)
The peoples designated as Kushites or Kamites by Massey were
called Nilotic Negroes by Dr. Churchward, in his pioneer work The
Origin and Evolution of the Human Race. In tracing the ancient inhab
itants of Egypt back to the Great Lakes region of Africa, he was able to
obtain the endorsement of recognized authorities, such as Professor C.
G. Seligman and Sir E. A. Wallis Budge. "The prehistoric native of



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 197
Egypt, both in the old and new Stone Ages, was an African," according to Budge, and "there are many things in the manners and cus
toms and religions of the historic Egyptians, . . . that suggest that the
original home of their prehistoric ancestors was a country in the neigh
borhood of Uganda and Punt." (30, pp. 21-22) In this same little book
we are also told that the most ancient symbolism of Egypt was of un
doubted African origin: "These symbols are found painted on pots at
Nakadah and are supported on standards fixed in the prehistoric boats;
many of them reappear in the names of gods in the historic period, and
they form the oldest Egyptian hieroglyphs known. They are very im
portant as showing that the earliest attempts to write in Egypt were
made by native African Egyptians." (30, p. 42)
The diffusionists, in tracing civilization back to an African origin,
have a good case, but there is one important link which is missing in
their chain of reasoning. In the works of Smith, Perry, Lord Raglan,
and Dr. Churchward, we are given a convincing picture of how the ar
chaic civilization spread across Asia to the islands of the South Pacific and eventually to the New World. Churchward is most emphatic in
tracing the beginning of civilization to the Nilotic Negroes of East and
Central Africa, and of its diffusion from that part of the world to Asia
and America by way of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The peoples of West Africa Churchward called True Negroes, and he dogmatically
declared that none of these peoples ever left the African continent. If
the East African Nilotics could convey civilization to the Americas by
way of southern Asia and the Pacific Islands, why could not the West
Africans take the much shorter route across the Atlantic Ocean?
An attempt was made to answer this question by Professor Leo Wiener of Harvard University, in his three-volume work Africa and
the Discovery of America. A further contribution was made in this di
rection by Wiener in the publication of his Mayan and Mexican Ori
gins. In these well-documented studies, Professor Wiener claimed that
West African mariners and merchants made more than fifty voyages
across the Atlantic to the New World in pre-Columbian times. On
this topic we shall have more to say in the next chapter.
Where facts are in short supply, speculation runs rife. This is exem
plified by the hypotheses of the lost continents of Lemuria, Mu, and
Atlantis. Lemuria is thought to have been an ancient continent in the
middle of what is now the Indian Ocean; Mu was a similar continent in
the Pacific Ocean; and Atlantis was, of course, in the Atlantic Ocean midway between Africa and South America. All these continents be



198 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
came lost by sinking bencarh the waters of the various oceans. The
Atlantean hypothesis has spawned a vast literature, whereas the other
lost continents have never captivated the public fancy. It is true that
Colonel James Churchward wrote a series of books on the lost conti
nent of Mu, but, since these works were more akin to science fiction
than sober science, we may dismiss them as literary curiosities. But
Atlantis caught on. We have been informed by a contemporary writer:
"Atlantis was a fable invented by Plato for the edification of his stu
dents. His Greek contemporaries quite properlv regarded it as such
and wasted no time trying to find out where it was and why it sank to
the bottom of the sea, and what happened to the Atlantians. ,,
(51, p.
252) We are inclined to think that Cohen's relegation of Atlantis to
the realm of fable is correct, but the Atlantis story has captivated so
many scientists and scholars of distinction and has given rise to such an
extensive literature that we must take some notice of it.
Colonel Alexandre Braghine, the French explorer, was convinced
that the ancient Ethiopians of Africa were in some way connected with
the lost continent of Atlantis. The Greek historian, Proclus, told of the
visit of Krantor to the temple of the goddess Neith, in the ancient
Egyptian city of Sais. The priests of the establishment showed Krantor
columns of hieroglyphs relating to the history of Atlantis. Proclus cited
as another source of his know ledge of Atlantis The Ethiopian History of
Marcellus. Skylax of Karyanda, a Carian navigator, who explored the
Indus River region of India for the king of Persia in the sixth century
B.C., also recorded that Phoenician mariners carried on a lively trade
with Ethiopians of the island of Cernc, beyond the Pillars of Hercules,
in the Atlantic Ocean. At a later time, Diodorus Siculus specifically
stated that the western region of Ethiopia was inhabited by Atlanteans.
According to Georg, the Atlanteans were Ethiopians, for he has de
clared:
The new age that began after the disappearance of Atlantis was marked
at first by the world wide dominance of Ethiopian representatives of the black race. They were supreme in Africa and Asia, . . . and they even
infiltrated through Southern Europe. But they were expelled from this lat
ter place after a thousand years of bitter warfare between the races and on
slaughts by the invaders from the north. The memory of the great advance
of the blacks has been almost completely lost; only in the dread of dragons

for the dragon painted on the insignia of the kings was carried in the van
of the black armies— was a final vestige of the inter-racial wars preserved.
(96, p. 121)



THE ORIGIN OK CIVILIZATION 199
Professor Leo Frobenius made a careful studv of rhe Atlantis ques
tion. He concluded that there never was an island named Atlantis in
the ocean between Africa and the Americas; but his studies convinced
him that there was an ancient Atlantean culture located on the coast of
West Africa. For in Yorubaland he unearthed ruins of palaces and
beautiful statuary; and he heard among the Yorubans legends of an an
cient royal city and its palace with golden walks which in the distant
past sank beneath the waves. Frobenius found Poseidon's castle not in
the mid-Atlantic, but in Yorubaland, on the West African coast: "Yo
ruba, with its channeled network of lakes on the coast and the reaches
of the Niger; Yoruba, whose peculiarities are not inadequately depicted
in the Platonic account—this Yoruba, I assert, is Atlantis, the home of
Poseidon's posterity, the Sea God by them named Olokun; the land of
peoples of whom Solon declared: 'They had even extended their lord
ship over Egypt and Tyrrhene.' " (93, Vol. I, p. 345)
This great Africanist also detected cultural links between the Yoru
bas of West Africa and the Mayas of Central America. "I cannot
finish," he wrote, "without devoting a word or two to a certain symp
tomatic conformity of the Western Atlantic civilization with its higher
manifestations in America. Its cognate features are so striking that they
cannot be overlooked and as the region of Atlantic African culture is
Yoruba, ... it seems to be a present question, whether it might not be
possible to bring the marvelous Maya monuments, whose dates have
been deciphered by our eminent American archaeologists, into some
prehistoric connection with those of Yoruba." (93, Vol. I, p. 348) (It
may be of interest to the reader to consult 139, pp. 32-33. See espe
cially the map of the world according to Herodotus, on page 33, where
Atlanteans are shown as dwelling on the West African coast, and
hence on the shore of the Atlantic sea.)
The literature on Atlantis runs into thousands of titles, in numerous
languages, so only a few of the most scholarly works on the subject can
be mentioned here. The late Lewis Spence, of Scotland, an outstanding
anthropologist, wrote a series of books on the Atlantis question. Proba
bly the best of the lot was his History of Atlantis. Atlantis: The Antedi
luvian World by Ignatius Donnelly, an American, was published in
1882. A revised edition, edited by Egerton Sykes, F.R.G.S., was pub
lished as recently as 1949. The Shadow of Atlantis by the Frenchman,
Colonel Alexandre Braghine, is, in our opinion, one of the best of the
books on the subject. Professor Leo Frobenius wrote a series of books



200 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
with the title Atlantis in German, but the work has not to date been
translated into English. The speculations of Raquena and LePlongeon
are noted here, for whatever they are worth. Professor Rafael Raquena,
a Venezuelan archaeologist, believed that Atlantis was colonized from
ancient Egypt and that these Egyptians established other colonies in
the New World before the submergence of Atlantis. Professor Au
gustus LePlongeon, a French archaeologist who finally settled in
Brooklyn, New York, carried on extensive explorations in Yucatan. In
1874, LePlongeon uncovered the ruins of a palace in Chichen Irza,
which he named Prince Con's Palace. In these ruins the professor
found pictographs and inscriptions which he claims to have deciphered.
The result of these finds was a book, Queen Moo and the Egyptian
Sphinx, in which LePlongeon gave his interpretations of the inscrip
tions along with reproductions of the pictographs. Mrs. LePlongeon,
who assisted her husband in his labors, wrote a little book entitled
Queen Moo's Talisman. The story as given in these works runs briefly
as follows: About eleven thousand years ago, two brothers, princes of
Yucatan, sought the hand of the ruling monarch of the realm, Queen
Moo, in marriage. The brothers were named Coh and Aac, re
spectively, and Prince Coh was the successful suitor. This enraged
Prince Aac, who thereupon stabbed his brother fatally with a stone
knife. Then Aac attempted to force Queen Moo to marry him. The
queen, rather than submit, decided to flee to Atlantis. On reaching the
coast, she learned that Atlantis, overwhelmed by earthquakes, had
sunken below the waves of the ocean. So the queen embarked for Af
rica and ended her journey in Egypt. In that country she was hailed as
queen and elevated to the throne. Then she caused the Sphinx to be
erected as a memorial to her dead husband. Is it possible, or even proba
ble, that the great Sphinx with its Ethiopian physiognomy was set up as
a memorial to an ancient Mayan prince? The story so charmed Mrs.
LePlongeon that she set it to poetry as follows:
Where flows the river Nile, The queen found rest; There once again her days
With peace were blessed. Upon that soil where Welcome frank was found, Did Moo a giant Sphinx from Out of the ground
Cause to arise, and



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 201
Thus Coh's fame renew?
Did she immortalize
Her consort true? (143, p. 65)
A young man in New England published an article in 1879 with the
title "Atlantis Not a Myth." The purpose of this essay was to show
that the Mayas were a surviving branch of the ancient inhabitants of Atlantis. In 1885, this young man, Edward Herbert Thompson, went
to Central America and then spent forty years carrying on explorations
in that area. Up to the time of his death in 1935, he still held that the
Mayas were direct descendants of the ancient Atlanteans. Another
American archaeologist who succumbed to the lure of Atlantis was Dr.
J. A. Mason of the Field Museum of Chicago. In 1922, Dr. Mason was
engaged in excavating a site near Santa Mataa in the province of
Magdalena, United States of Colombia. There the ruins of an ancient
city were unearthed. The site is about forty miles from the Caribbean
coast. Mason's report to the Field Museum declared: "There must have
been a tremendous population here at one time, as the whole country is
covered with house sites." No official estimate as to the age of the ruins
was published, but the museum authorities announced that the discov
ery of this old Colombian city "heightens the probability that the con
tinent of Atlantis, said to have been swallowed by the ocean, and lying
midway between South America and Africa, actually existed/' (Cited
by Maynard Shipley in 226, p. 16)
A few more words must be said on the contentious question of the
races of man before closing this chapter. Speaking scientifically, there is
only one race, the human race, which the biologists classify as genus
homo, and species sapiens. The several varieties of the human species
are subspecies of one original group. In the literature of history and the
social sciences we read of all sorts of races that have been invented by
well-meaning enthusiasts with a case to prove. We read of the Hamit
ic, Semitic, and Aryan races, which is all nonsense, for these names
refer to groups of languages and have no connection with race. Even
worse, we read of the exploits of the German, French, and English
races. In works relating to the role of Africa in world history, we see
this process carried to such an extreme pitch that it reduces itself to
utter absurdity. A few examples will demonstrate this opinion. In the
latter part of the last century, a brilliant young lady in England, Miss
Flora Louisa Shaw, decided to become a journalist. She became a colo
nial correspondent for the London Times and traveled extensively in



202 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Africa. She also became rhe wife of Lord Lugard, who was Governor General of Nigeria, ar rhe rurn of rhe century, and is hence widely known in rhe world of lerrers as Lady Lugard. From her pen came a
very able hisrorical work, A Tropical Dependency: An Outline of the
Ancient History of the Western Sudan with an Account of the Modern Set
tlement of Northern Nigeria. In discussing rhe early history of rhe
Sudan, Lady Lugard refers ro rhar extensive area as Negroland, as is
shown in rhe following passage:
When rhe hisrory of Negroland comes ro be wrirren in derail, ir may be found rhar rhe kingdoms lying towards rhe easrern end of rhe Sudan were
rhe home of races who inspired, rarhcr rhan of races who received rhe tradi
tions of civilization associated for us with the name of ancient Fgypr. For
rhey cover on eirher side of rhe Upper Nile, berween the latitudes of 10 de
grees and 1 7 degrees, territories in which are found monuments more ancient than the oldest Rgyprian monuments. If this should prove to be the
case, and the civilized world be forced to recognize in a black people the fount of its original enlightenment, it may happen that we shall have to re
vise entirely our view of the black races and regard those who now exist as
the decadent representatives of an almost forgotten era, rather than as the
embryonic possibility of an era yet to come. (146, pp. 17-18)
Lady Lugard writes learnedly of rhe grear ancicnr and medieval
kingdoms and empires of rhe Sudan, or rhe land of rhe blacks, also
called Negroland; bur a careful reading of her text shows that the great
Sudanic peoples of the past were, in her opinion, not Negroes. In a dis
cussion of rhe Fulah (or Fulani) we are rold rhar rhey seem ro have
originally dwelled in rhe neighborhood of rhe sources of rhe Senegal
River and rhar rhey are "a parrly whire race." 1 hen we are informed:
The movement of this remarkable people in Africa within historic times
has unquestionably been from west to east, but this doesn't preclude the theory of some more remote eastern origin which may have preceded their
African immigration. Whether Phoenician, Egyptian, Indian, or simply
Arab, they are evidently a race distinct from the Negroid and other black types by which they have been surrounded and notwithstanding the marked effects produced on some porrions of rheir people by inrermarriage
with Negro women, rhey have kepr rhe disrincrive qualificarions of rheir race rhrough a known period of rwo rhousand years. The Fulah of roday is as disrincr from rhe pure Negro as was rhe firsr Fulah of whom we have record. How long rhey may have exisred in Africa before any record of rhem was made ir is wirh our presenr knowledge impossible ro say. The Hausa and rhe Songhay are orher races which, rhough black, are absolurely
disrincr from rhe pure Negro rype. (146, p. 22)



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 203
The passage cited above brings ro mind a remark by the German an
thropologist Ratzel: "Trie hideous Negro type, which the fancy of ob
servers one saw all over Africa, is really to be seen onlv as a sign in
front of tobacco shops." (199, Vol. 11, p. 313)
An interesting article, "The Negro Enigma," by Professor M. I).
W. Jeffreys, was published in the West African Rercieu\ September,
1951. The following extracts are from that article:
The Black Belt, anthropologically speaking, is that area on the earth's
surface that comprises the dark skinned races. . . . The black belt extends
from Africa via India, to Melanesia and Australia. In this great arc the posi
tion of the Negro is the great enigma. At the two ends, or horns, are people
who are Negroes, but in the center there are none. The center is occupied
by a dark skinned race, the Hindu, but he offers no difficulty. He belongs
to the same race as the European, namely, the Caucasian. . . . The Cauca
sian comes from an old human stock —a stock that is today called modern
man. . . . The Swanscombe skull found in Great Britain is dated 250,000
years, and is our stock, not Negro. The skeletal remains dug up by the Leakeys in East Africa are us, not Negro. Boskop man, found in the Cape,
is dated 50,000 years, and falls into our group, not that of the Negro. There
are no Negro skulls of any antiquity. . . . The two Grimaldi skulls, one of
a woman, the other of a boy, are not Negro skulls. ... So the enigma
deepens: all the evidence points to the Negro being a comparatively recent
race and here is the old Caucasian race in a continuous stretch from Britain
to India. . . . Now in Africa, there is a continuous evidence, unlike any
where else on the globe, of man's uninterrupted occupation of the earth for
close on a million years. Africa is thus today accepted by many scientists as
the cradle of the human species. Thus, in Africa, from the Old Stone Age to modern times, Modern Man is the tool maker. Nowhere is the Negro,
unlike the Bushman, associated with these stone age cultures.
According to Professor Jeffreys, the so-called Negro type is an
enigma even in Africa. In a recent valuable study, // Began in Babel, a
German Scholar, Herbert Wendt, devotes several pages to a discussion
of the question: Where did the Negro come from? We are told by the
author that: "Even in the wisest and most detailed anthropological and
ethnological works, no answer will be found to this question, though
there are all kinds of hypotheses, suppositions and questionable indica
tions." (269, p. 368) Wendt directs our attention to southern Asia and Oceania, and con
cludes that they were not the original home of the Negroes. Then,
turning to a consideration of Africa, he tells us:



204 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
The African Negroes are of even more "Negroid" type than the dark
races of Asia and the South Seas. Their skin color is generally darker, their
hair woolier, their lips more prominent—in short, their whole appearance is
more "Negro like" than that of a Tamil or a Papuan. Accordingly they
must be the pure, original Negroes, and the black race must have had its
birth in Africa. But apart from one or two exceptions, there is no proof of
this. All primitive Africans, ignoring Neanderthal or even older human
types, belong broadly speaking to European humanity. . . . Then if there
are no primeval Negroes in the dark continent, how did the Negroes come
to Africa? (269, pp. 368-69)
Herbert Wendt finally decided that the word race has lost its mean
ing in Africa, and that we should speak instead of cultural group. "It is
enough to say here," he concludes, "that there is after all no real Negro
civilization, but that Africa is a mirror reflecting the most varied human
cultures— just like Eurasia and America." (269, p. 377)
In contrast to the opinions cited above, it is only fair to consider the
views of Sir Harry Johnston, who has been widely recognized as an au
thority on Africa and its peoples:
Whether the African Negro was the first human colonizer of Africa or
was preceded by a more brutish or more generalized type, such as the Gal
ley-Hill man, is not yet known to us. But from the little we possess in the
way of fossil human remains and other evidence, it seems probable that
every region of Africa, even Algeria and Egypt, once possessed a Negro
population. . . . In Egypt a dwarfish type of Negro seems to have inhabited
the Nile Delta.some 10,000 years ago; and big black Negroes formed the population of Upper Nubia and Dongola as late as about 4,000 years ago.
(129, p. 5)
Though contending that Negroid types lived in Africa in very early
times, Johnston was convinced that some part of southern Asia, possi
bly India, was the original home of this particular branch of the human
species. On this topic, he wrote as follows:
There is a strong underlying Negroid element in the mass of the Indian
population and in the southernmost part of the great peninsula there are
forest tribes of dark skin and strikingly Negro physiognomy, with frizzled
or wooly hair. ... In the more eastern among the Malay Islands—espe
cially in Buru, Jilolo and Timor—the interior tribes are of obvious Negro
stock. Still more marked is this in the case of New Guinea, and most of all
in the Bismarck Archipelago and northern Solomon Islands. In these last
the resemblance of the natives to the average Negro of Africa is most strik



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 205
ing, although the distance is something like 8,000 miles. Negro affinities ex
tend east of the Solomon Archipelago to Fiji and Hawaii, and south to New
Caledonia, Tasmania, and even New Zealand. On the other hand, Africa
for many thousand years has been obviously the chief domain of the Negro.
(129, p. 3)
It should be apparent to the reader at this point that, if Johnston
knew whereof he spoke, then the opinions expressed by Jeffreys and
Wendt must lack all validity, and vice versa. It is of no profit to ask
where the Negro came from, or to pontificate on the Negro Enigma, if
we do not beforehand define the term Negro; and this, as far as we are
aware, has never been done. In Greco-Roman times the various peo
ples of Africa were known as Ethiopians. Europeans of the Middle
Ages called all Africans Moors. In modern times certain African peo
ples were designated as Negroes. If you ask what is the difference be
tween a Kushite, a Hamite, and a Negro, you can expect no concord
ant conclusion, for the so-called authorities on the races of mankind
have never told us just what branch of the human species should be
classified as Negroes. As an example of this sort of confusion, we refer
to a study by Sir Grafton Elliot Smith. In this work, he discussed at
length the question of the racial origins of the ancient Egyptians; and
started off as follows: "Not a few writers, like the traveler Volney in
the eighteenth century, have expressed the belief that the ancient
Egyptians were Negroes, or at any rate strongly Negroid. In recent
times, even a writer so discriminating as Ripley usually is, has given his
adhesion to this view, which I consider to be the most serious blot on
his most valuable and interesting memoir 'The People of Europe.'
(234, p. 37)
The writers referred to above by Professor Smith were the French
Orientalist Count Constantine Francis Volney and the American an
thropologist, Professor William Z. Ripley. Count Volney, in his fa
mous book 77?^ Ruins of Empires, in a reference to the African Ethio
pia, wrote: "There a people, now forgotten, discovered, while others
were yet barbarians, the elements of the arts and sciences. A race of
men now rejected from society for their sable skin and frizzled hair,
founded on the study of the laws of nature, those civil and religious sys
tems which still govern the universe." (258, pp. 16-17) In a footnote, Count Volney cites the Greek writer Lucian as
saying: "The Ethiopians were the first who invented the science of the
stars, and gave names to the planets. Not at random, and without



206 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
meaning, bur descriptive of rhe qualities which they conceived them to
possess; and it was from them that this art passed, still in an imperfect
state, to the Egyptians." Volney, commenting on the opinion of Lu
cian, asserted: "It would be easy to multiply citations upon this subject;
from all which it follows, that we have the strongest reasons to believe
that the country neighboring to the tropic was the cradle of the scien
ces, and of consequence that the first learned nation was a nation of
blacks; for it is incontrovertible, that, by the term Ethiopians, the an
cients meant to represent a people of black complexion, thick lips and
woolly hair." (258, p. 17)
We now turn back to the opinions of Elliot Smith, who stated:
"Within recent years, many scholars have advocated the view that
there is a large element of the Negro in the composition of the Proto
Egyptian population, and Ripley, apparently as the result of a misun
derstanding of Sergi r
s views, boldly states that the Egyptians and the
whole Mediterranean race are descendants of Negroes." (234, p. 79)
Smith freely admitted that the ancient Egyptians were not members of
the white race, and he felt equally certain that they were not classifia
ble in the black race; so he listed them under the label of the brown
race. "There can be no doubt that in respect to many features," ac
cording to Sir Elliot, "the brown and black races present many points
of similarity. . . . That there is no close affinity between the two races
is shown by an analysis and comparison of the intimate structure of the
bodies of representative individuals. In the texture of bone, the archi
tecture of the skull, the nature of the asymmetry of the body and the
character of the variations—in these and many other respects there is
evidence of the profound gap that separates the Negro from the rest of
mankind, including the Egyptian." (234, pp. 79-80) Assuming that
there actually is a profound gap between the so-called Negro and the
rest of the human race, one would expect Professor Smith to present
some sort of proof to validate his hypothesis; but this objective evidence
he entirely failed to produce.
The fact is that the stereotype of the so-called Negro race corre
sponds to no reality in the world of objective phenomena. At the pres
ent time, in our own United States of America, anyone reputed to have
an African ancestry, however remote, is supposed to be a Negro. Now,
let us carry this thesis to its logical conclusion. Since there is over
whelming evidence that the human race originated in Africa, then all mankind has an African ancestry. Hence, all men must be Negroes.



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 207
To carry the argument a srep further, according to the theory of evolu
tion, the human species possesses a common ancestry with the anthro
poid apes; therefore, we are all apes. If the reader thinks this is far
fetched, we beg leave to illustrate our position by relating the true
story of an incident of the recent past. Soon after the United States be
came involved in World War II, an open-air political meeting was held
in the Harlem section of New York City. In the crowd attending the
affair was a gentleman visiting the city, and next to him stood a mem
ber of the staff of the local Y.M.C.A. The two men became engaged in
conversation, and the visitor asked the Y.M.C.A. clerk to point out to
him the celebrities seated on the platform from which the meeting was
being conducted. The Y.M.C.A. man addressed the out-of-towner as
he pointed to politicians on the platform:
"Sir! Observing from left to right, you will notice a short, stout,
dark-complected man; that is Mayor LaGuardia. Seated next to him, you will see another man of swarthy complexion; and he is Commis
sioner Newbold Morris. They may look like colored men from here,
but they are, in fact, both white men. Now, on the other side of the
platform you will observe the presence of two men of very fair com
plexion. The one at which I point is Congressman A. C. Powell, Jr., and the gentleman seated next to him is Mr. Walter White, the Sec
retary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. Though these two gents look like white men, they are actually
Negroes."
Any word that can be used so ambiguously as Negro should be dis
carded, since, for descriptive purposes, it is totally devoid of meaning.
But getting rid of this word is not going to be easy; for false ideas are
not cast off readily, even after being conclusively discredited. As an
example of how absurdities are perpetuated, we cite an amusing anec
dote from the pen of the late Lord Russell:
Give me an adequate army, with power to provide it with more pay and
better food than falls to the lot of the average man, and I will undertake,
within 30 years, to make the majority of the population believe that two
and two are three, that water freezes when it gets hot and boils when it gets
cold, or any other nonsense that might seem to serve the interest of the
state. Of course, even when these beliefs had been generated, people would
not put the kettle in the refrigerator when they wanted it to boil. That cold
makes water boil would be a Sunday truth, sacred and mystical, to be pro
fessed in awed tones, but not to be acted on in daily life. What would hap



208 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
pen would be that any verbal denial of the mystic doctrine would be made illegal, and obstinate heretics would be frozen at the stake. No person who
did not enthusiastically accept the official doctrine would be allowed to
teach or to have any position of power. Only the very highest officials, in
their cups, would whisper to each other what rubbish it all is; then they
would laugh and drink again. This is hardly a caricature of what happens
under some modern governments. (217, p. 95)
That branch of the human race which may be described as black or
dark brown is customarily labeled Negroid, meaning Negro-like. If
Negro is disallowed, then Negroid will also have to go, for, if the Negro
is a mythical concept, then how can anything be likened to a nonexist
ent entity? But if we get rid of the term Negro, what will we put in its
place? This is a fair question, and we come forth with a suggestion. In
ancient times, black men were called Ethiopians; and why cannot we
today, following the usage of modern anthropology, refer to members
of the black race as Ethiopoids, rather than Negroids.
Let us repeat that, in antiquity, all black men were regarded as Ethi
opians. Today we are told by certain scientists and scholars, who
should know better, that down through the ages, there have been two
groups of black people; one, known as Kushites or Ethiopians, highly
civilized and progressive; and another called Negroes, uncivilized, and
who never rose above savagery and barbarism to the level of civiliza
tion. In the middle of the last century, an American scholar, Professor
John William Draper, wrote a two-volume History of the Intellectual
Development of Europe. In the first edition of this work, the author di
gressed from his main theme, and presented a melancholy picture of
the sad plight of certain natives of what was then called the dark conti
nent. He mused on how the benighted denizens of the West African
coast gazed for ages on the mighty Atlantic Ocean, vaguely wondering
what lay on the other side of it, but were not clever enough to build
boats and embark on voyages of exploration. To the credit of Draper,
this nonsense was eliminated in the revised edition of his book. Evi
dently he learned that discoveries had been made which showed that
Africans had somehow made their way to the New World in pre-Co
lumbian times.
These so-called Negroes, sometimes called pure Negroes or true Ne
groes, never actually existed, of course. For no group of people, who
over periods of thousands of years just stood still in a state of suspended
animation while the rest of mankind advanced, could possibly have sur



THE ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION 209
vived. Evolution does nor operate thar way. So we musr conclude that whar has been called the Negro is a myrh. This type of mythology has
led to great tragedy in the past, and even in the present its baleful in
fluence is still in our midst. For example, consider the following senti
ments of a contemporary scientist as transmitted by Lord Raglan:
''Professor R. B. Cattell . . . concludes that savages, including the
whole Negro race, should on account of their low mentality and un
pleasant nature, be painlessly exterminated." (196, p. 4) Lord Raglan,
to his credit, dissents from such an outlook. "Nobody with any knowl
edge of savages would agree with these views," he noted. "Real savages
show many differences, both racially and individually, but in general
they are pleasant and kindly people with plenty of common sense
which they apply whenever they are not inhibited by their traditional
beliefs. There is no evidence that savages in general are inferior to Eu
ropeans in innate mental capacity, though, as among Europeans, there
are marked individual differences." (196, p. 4)
Fortunately, Africans for the most part have rejected this Negro
mythology. The late Professor William L. Hansberry was for many
years chairman of the History Department of Howard University.
After retirement, the professor was appointed to the directorship of a
school for historical research connected with an African university.
Professor Hansberry on one occasion, in pursuit of his studies, visited
an African scholar in the Congo. On introducing the professor to some
friends, the African gentleman mentioned that Professor Hansberry
hailed from the United States of America and was known in that land
as a Negro. This little group of Africans told Dr. Hansberry that they
took a special interest in making his acquaintance, since he was the first
Negro that they had ever seen.
We must now move on to our next topic, the evolution of civiliza
tion, which will be surveyed in the next chapters.



CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Evolution of Civilization:
Ethiopia and Egypt
PROBABLY the most ambitious attempt to subject the rise and fall of
civilizations to scientific scrutiny was made by the Egyptologist, Sir
Flinders Petrie, in a little book entitled 77?^ Revolutions of Civilization.
Petrie studied the history of Egypt over a period of seven thousand
years, in which he claimed to have detected the rise and fall of civiliza
tion several times over. Then he compared European civilization from
the days of ancient Crete to the present time with the culture cycles of
ancient Egypt. This study tended to show a definite cultural pattern, in
which can be traced the rise, progress, and decline of civilizations.
"Every civilization of a settled population," Petrie observed, "tends
to incessant decay from its maximum condition; and this decay con
tinues until it is too weak to initiate anything, when a fresh race comes
in and utilizes the old stock to graft on, both in blood and culture. As
soon as the mixture is well started, it rapidly grows on the old soil and
produces a new wave of civilization. There is no new generation with
out a mixture of blood, parthenogenesis is unknown in the birth of na
tions." (189, p. 114)
After an old civilization has declined to its minimum condition, a
fresh cultural wave ensues, and then the process makes a new start, and
the revitalized culture begins to rise to a new maximum state. Every
invasion of an old civilization by a new people results in from four hun
dred to six hundred years of autocratic rule; and during this period,
there is a gradual improvement in the arts of life. For another four hun
dred to six hundred years in which oligarchy prevails, the arts flourish.
Then there is a final phase of about four hundred years of democracy,
and during this time, the arts decay. "When democracy has attained
210



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 211
full power," we are told, "the majority without capital necessarily eat
up the capital of the minority and the civilization steadily decays until
the inferior population is swept away to make room for a fitter people."
(189, p. 124) Petrie contended that the arts have always followed each
other in a definite succession, sculpture being the first to rise and
decay, followed successively by painting, literature, and mechanics.
This scheme of Petrie's undoubtedly has value, but his generalizations
appear to be too sweeping.
Professor Charles H. Hapgood, of the University of New Hamp
shire, has made a special study of ancient maps and has published his
findings in Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings. In Chapter VIII of that
work, entitled U A Civilization That Vanished," he made the following
statement of opinion:
The evidence presented by the ancient maps appears to suggest the exist
ence in remote times, before the rise of any of the known cultures, of a true
civilization, of a comparatively advanced sort, which either was localized in
one area but had worldwide commerce, or was, in a real sense, a worldwide
culture. This culture, at least in some respects, may well have been more
advanced than the civilizations of Egypt, Babylonia, Greece and Rome. In
astronomy, nautical science, map making and possibly ship-building, it was
perhaps more advanced than any state of culture before the 18th century of
the Christian Era. (1 12, p. 193)
Professor Hapgood does not draw any conclusions as to what people
or to what part of the world this ancient culture could plausibly be
traced. A German historian of a century ago, Professor A. H. L.
Heeren, also speculated on the place of origin of the world's earliest
civilization, and he had no hesitation in locating it among the African
Ethiopians:
In Nubia and Ethiopia, stupendous, numerous and primeval monuments
proclaim so loudly a civilization contemporary to, aye, earlier than that of
Egypt, that it may be conjectured with the greatest confidence that the arts,
sciences and religion descended from Nubia to the lower country of
Mizraim; that civilization descended the Nile, built Memphis and finally
sometime later, wrested by colonization the Delta from the Sea. (Historical
Researches: African Nations by Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren, cited by Lady Lugard in 146, pp. 220-21)
In commenting on the above passage from Heeren, Lady Lugard ob
served: "The people of Ethiopia colonized to the north and west.



212 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Amongst their colonies to the north, one of the most important was Thebes. Thebes and Meroe together founded the colony Ammonium in the western desert, and through Thebes the religion of Meroe was
carried into Lower Egypt. It was at a much later period, about 1500 B.C., that Egypt returned upon Meroe and conquered it." (146, p.
221) As to the influence of the ancient Ethiopians in the Sudan, Lady Lu
gard offered the following evidence:
In corroboration of the view that the trade and influence of Meroe may have extended farther west than has as yet been ascertained by modern explorations, I may mention a fact told me by Zebehr Pasha, when, during his confinement at Gibraltar in 1886, he related to me the history of the foundation of his ephemeral empire in the Bahr-el-Ghazal. It was that, having
occasion to act as the military ally of a certain native king Tekkima, whose territory lay somewhere south and west of the spot marked upon modern
maps as Dem Suleiman or Dem Zebehr—that is, presumably about 8 degrees north and 25 degrees east, he was informed that he had to fight against magicians, who habitually came out of the earth, fought, and then
disappeared. A careful system of scouting disclosed to him the fact that they came from underground and when, after cutting off their retreat and conquering them, he insisted on being shown their place of habitation, he found it to be deeply buried in the sand, a wonderful system of temples, "far finer" to use the words in which he described it, "than modern eyes have seen in the mosques of Cairo and Constantinople." It was, he said, such work of massive stone as was done by the great races of old. Through this underground city of stone there ran a stream, and by the stream his na
tive antagonists lived in common straw native huts. "Were your people, then," he asked them, "a nation of stone cutters?" And they said "Oh, no! This is not the work of our forefathers but our forefathers found it here and we have lived for many generations in these huts." Whether this accidental discovery of unknown monuments may yet be repeated further west and links be established in a continuous chain of ancient civilization reaching from the Red Sea to the country west of Chad,
or whether the civilizations of the western and the eastern ends of the fer
tile belt of the Sudan were in fact separated from one another by a sea of which the waters of Chad are but the disappearing trace is, however, a
question which, interesting as it is, becomes ... a question rather of detail
than of principle.
If there was no connection by the south, there certainly was connection by the north, by means of which the early inhabitants of the Hausa States may have been brought under the same influences of civilization which spread from Ethiopia to ancient Egypt and thence to Europe and North Af
rica. (146, pp. 225-26)



ETHIOPIA ANi) EGYPT 213
Several Egyptologists have defended the idea that the ancestors of
the ancient Egyptians originally came from Asia; but there never was
any evidence to substantiate this position; and the only reason it was
adopted was that it was the fashion to believe that no African peoples
were capable of developing a great civilization. An American scholar,
GeofFry Parsons, in a well-documented historical study, referred to the
culture of Egypt as "genuinely African in its origin and development."
(182, p. 154)
The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, who lived in the first century
B.C., wrote a world history in forty books. He utilized good sources
and recorded them accurately. In Book III is a valuable account of the
Ethiopian origin of Egyptian culture, from which we cite the following
extracts:
Now the Ethiopians, as historians relate, were the first of all men and the
proofs of this statement, they say, are manifest. For that they did not come
into their land as immigrants from abroad but were the natives of it and so
justly bear the name of autochthones (sprung from the soil itself), is, they
maintain, conceded by practically all men. . . .
They say also that the Egyptians are colonists sent out by the Ethiopians,
Osiris having been the leader of the colony. For, speaking generally, what
is now Egypt, they maintain, was not land but sea, when in the beginning the universe was being formed; afterwards, however, as the Nile during the
times of its inundation carried down the mud from Ethiopia, land was grad
ually built up from the deposit. . . . A*id the larger parts of the customs of
the Egyptians are, they hold, Ethiopian, the colonists still preserving their
ancient manners. For instance, the belief that their kings are gods, the very
special attention which they pay to their burials, and many other matters of
a similar nature, are Ethiopian practices, while the shapes of their statues
and the forms of their letters are Ethiopian; for of the two kinds of writing
which the Egyptians have, that which is known as popular (demotic) is
learned by everyone, while that which is called sacred (hieratic), is under
stood only by the priests of the Egyptians, who learn it from their fathers as
one of the things which are not divulged, but among the Ethiopians every
one uses these forms of letters. Furthermore, the orders of the priests, they
maintain, have much the same position among both peoples; for all are clean
who are engaged in the service of the gods, keeping themselves shaven, like
the Ethiopian priests, and having the same dress and form of staff, which is
shaped like a plough and is carried by their kings who wear high felt hats
which end in a knob at the top and are circled by the serpents which they
call asps; and this symbol appears to carry the thought that it will be the lot
who shall dare to attack the king to encounter death-carrying stings. Many



214 MAN, COD, AND CIVILIZATION
other things are told by them concerning their own antiquity and the col
ony which they sent out that became the Egyptians, but about this there is
no special need of our writing anything.
We must now speak about the Ethiopian writing which is called hiero
glyphic among the Egyptians, in order that we may omit nothing in our
discussion of their antiquities. Now it is found that the forms of their letters
take the shape of animals of every kind, and of the members of the human
body, and of implements and especially carpenter's tools; for their writing
does not express the intended concept by means of syllables joined one to
another, but by means of the significance of the objects which have been
copied and by its figurative meaning which has been impressed upon the
memory by practice. For instance, they draw the picture of a hawk, a croc
odile, a snake, and all of the merrtLers of the human body—an eye, a hand, a
face, and the like. Now the hawk signifies to them everything which hap
pens swiftly, since this animal is practically the swiftest of winged crea
tures. . . . And the crocodile is a symbol of all that is evil, and the eye is the
warder of justice and the guardian of the entire body. And as for the mem
bers of the body, the right hand with fingers extended signifies a procuring
of livelihood, and the left with the fingers closed, a keeping and guarding of
property. The same way of reasoning applies also to the remaining charac
ters, which represent parts of the body and implements and all other things;
for by paying close attention to the significance which is inherent in each
object and by training their minds through drill and exercise of the memory
over a long period, they read from habit everything which has been writ
ten. (67, pp. 89-97)
It has truly been observed that Egypt is the gift of the Nile, for this
seat of an ancient culture is six hundred miles long, and is hemmed in
by two ranges of barren limestone hills, which alternately approach and
retreat from each other, maintaining between them an average breadth
of seven miles. In the north they spread our and finally disappear, giv
ing way to a marshlike plain which extends to the Mediterranean Sea.
As we go southward up the Nile, the limestone hills are replaced by
those of granite; and these hills finally approach each other until they
almost touch. Through this gorge the river, during the season of inun
dation, rushes into the valley and runs northward to the sea. In the
winter and spring, the river rolls along sluggishly through a dry and
dusty plain; but in the summer all this changes; for then the waters
begin to move swiftly. The river first turns red in color, then later it
takes on a green hue, and eventually the Nile overflows its banks and
floods the valley to the bases of the hills. The whole valley becomes a
huge lake from which the villages rise like islands, being in fact built on



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 215
artificial mounds. The sources of the Nile are two great lakes located
deep in the heart of Africa: Lakes Victoria and Albert. As the clouds
laden with moisture pass over equatorial Africa, they release their wa
ters. This results in a rainy season often months' duration. The deluge
finds its way into the great lakes, and they discharge their excess wa
ters, which flow northward as the river Nile. As this stream flows
through a thirsty land, the parched soil drinks it up, but the waters con
tinue to come forth, and so push the river across a great desert stretch
ing from the latitude of Lake Chad to the Mediterranean Sea. The
river Nile owes its existence to the Great Lakes, but the inundation is
produced by a separate cause, in which the lakes do not participate. In
between the Nile and the mouth of the Arabian Gulf are the highlands
of Ethiopia, which rise toward the heavens thousands of feet above sea
level. Clouds floating in from above the Indian Ocean are intercepted
by these mountains as they travel northward. The clouds release their
burden of moisture, and during the rainy season two rivers rush
through their arid beds and roar into the Nile. The great river moves
northward between rocky walls as it traverses the Nubian Desert, and
when the lowlands of Egypt are reached, it overflows its banks. The
two Ethiopian tributaries make respectively important and unique con
tributions. The waters of the White Nile are crystal clear; but the At
bara and Blue Nile system brings along a rich black silt from the Abys
sinian highlands. This sediment finally settles over the land of Egypt as
a rich topsoil. When the waters recede, the farmers scatter their seed
over the fertile land and then wait for the solar energy to bring forth
their crops. But for the White Nile, the rivers of Ethiopia would be ab
sorbed by the thirsty desert; and without the Ethiopian waters, the
White Nile would be a barren water course. The river is generated by
the equatorial rains; the land, on the other hand, is produced by the
precipitation of the tropical rains on the slopes of the Ethiopian moun
tain pile. u ln that fair Egyptian valley," Winwood Reade noted, "fat
tened by a foreign soil, brightened by eternal sunshine, watered by ter
restrial rain, the natives were able to obtain a year's food in return for a
few days' toil, so were provided with a wealth of time which is essential
for a nation's growth." (203, p. 3)
The Edfu Text is of prime importance as a documentary source on
the early history of the Nile Valley. This famous inscription, found in
the 'Temple of Horus at Edfu, gives a valuable account of the origin of
the Egyptian civilization. According to this venerable record, civiliza



216 MAN, COD, A"ND CIVILIZATION
rion was brought from the south by a band of invaders led by King
Horus; and the followers of Horus were called the Blacksmiths on ac
count of their possession of implements made of iron. Sir Wallis Budge
argued that Horus and his blacksmiths came originally from western
Asia, bringing with them a religion based on the worship of the sun.
But this cannot have happened, since, as Dr. Robert Brirfault cogently
observed, there was no solar cult in western Asia in those early days.
This ancient culture has been traced back to Somaliland, though it
quite possibly had its origin on the shores of the Great Lakes of Central
Africa. In Somaliland, ruins of buildings have been found constructed
with dressed stone, and displaying an architectural style similar to that
of earliest Egypt. Professor Arthur G. Brodeur in The Pageant of Civi
lization asserted that the ancestors of the South Egyptians came origi
nally from this region, that they entered the Nile Valley by way of
Nubia and brought with them a well-developed civilization, and that
this migration took place long before 5000 B.C. The fact that these an
cient Africans possessed tools and weapons of iron should call forth no
surprise, for in the magazine Natural History, September-October,
1932, there appeared an article by the Italian explorer, Nino del
Grande, entitled "Prehistoric Iron Smelting in Africa," in which the
author described his discovery of an iron-smelting furnace in Northern
Rhodesia, of an antiquity of from five thousand to six thousand years.
We are told by some anthropologists that the earliest tribes of Egypt
were Hamites of Kushite origin; that is to say, they were of Ethiopian
ancestry and spoke an Hamitic type of language. According to Sir
Harry Johnston:
The Dynastic Egyptians were not far distant in physical type from the
Galla of today, but they had perhaps some element of the proto-Semite; and
their language, which is still rather a puzzle to classifiers, though mainly
Kushite in its features, exhibited early in its history the influence of Semitic
speech and no doubt absorbed into itself elements of the Libyan sister,
which it perhaps found already extending to the valley of the Nile. The Dynastic Egyptians evidently concentrated themselves in the narrow strip
of fertility along the banks of the Nile, not colonizing very markedly the
Red Sea coast lands. By about 8000 years ago, they had become the conquerors and rulers of Lower and Upper Egypt. The inhabitants of Egypt were thenceforth a people in which Hamitic (Libyan-Kushite), Semitic, Nilotic and even Sudanese-Negro elements were fused. (Cited by Dr. W.
E. B. DuBois in 73, p. 24)



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 217
Johnston referred to the Hamites as: "That Negroid race which was
the main stock of the ancient Egyptian, and is represented at the pres
ent day by the Somali, the Galla, and some of the blood of Abyssinia
and of Nubia, and perhaps by the peoples of the Sahara Desert." (132,
Vol. II, p. 473)
The Greek historian, Herodotus, observed that Egyptian women
went into the market place and engaged in trade, while their husbands
stayed at home and sat at the loom; and that sons were not compelled to
support their parents, but that daughters were obliged to do so,
whether they chose to or not. Diodorus Siculus, in referring to the ma
triarchal character of the Egyptian royal family, noted a similar state of
affairs among the commoners. "Among private citizens," he stated,
"the husband, by the terms of the marriage agreement, appertains to
the wife and it is stipulated between them that the man shall obey the
woman in all things." (Cited by Dr. Robert Briffault in 19, p. 279)
These customs seemed strange to the Greeks, but they were normal
features of African societies. Dr. Briffault has discussed this point with
characteristic lucidity:
The social features of prepatriarchal society have sometimes survived
under conditions of advanced civilization. This happened notably in Egypt.
Down to the time when a dynasty of Greek rulers sought to introduce for
eign usages, the conservative society of the great African kingdom, which
has contributed so largely to the material and intellectual culture of the
Western World, never lost the lineaments of a matriarchal social order.
. . . The functions of royalty in ancient Egypt were regarded as being
transmitted in the female line. While every Egyptian princess of the Royal
House was born a queen and bore the title and dignities of the office from
the day of her birth, a man only acquired them at his coronation, and could
do so only by becoming the consort of the royal princess. . . . Those fea
tures of the constitution of Egyptian royalty are not singular. They are sub
stantially identical with those obtaining in all other African kingdoms. (19, pp. 274-75)
Sir Gaston Maspero estimated that the ancient Egyptians first en
tered upon the stage of history around eight thousand to ten thousand
years B.C. (See Maspero's The Dawn of Civilization, 162, p. 44.) This
estimate we do not regard as excessive, for the Great Pyramid was
erected about six thousand years ago, and the Sphinx is believed to be much older. Massey noted: "There is a stone in the museum at Boulak
consecrated to the memory of a noteworthy transaction. We learn



218 MAN, COD, AND CIVILIZATION
from it rhar in the time of Khufu of the fourth dynasty, and founder of
the Great Pyramid, that the Sphinx and its recently discovered temple
not only existed, but were then in a state of dilapidation, and it is re
corded in the inscription that he restored them." (164, Vol. I, pp. 9
10) The basis of Egyptian chronology is the lost History of Egypt by the
historian Manetho of Sebennytus. The Pharaoh Ptolemy Philadelphus,
in the third century B.C., commissioned Manetho to write an authori
tative history of Egypt from the earliest times up to his own day. The
greater part of his history was lost in the destruction of the Alexan
drian Library, but among the few surviving fragments are Manetho's
lists of the kings of Egypt. This compilation divides the rulers of Egypt
into thirty dynasties. Modern Egyptologists have grouped the dynasties
into the following periods: The Old Kingdom (Dynasties I—VI), The Middle Kingdom (Dynasties XI-X1V), The Empire (Dynasties XVII1-XX), The Saite Age (Dynasty XXVI).
In the XXVllth Dynasty, the country was overrun by the Persians.
Since that time, Egypt has rarely been free from foreign rule. It should
be noticed that there were interludes of chaos between the Old and Middle Kingdoms, between the Middle Kingdom and the Empire, and
between the Empire and the Saitic Age. In the study of the history of
Egypt we have a choice of two chronological schemes. There is a short
chronology compiled by Professor James Henry Breasted and a long
one constructed by Sir Elinders Petrie. Both lists are given below for
comparison: - DATES B.C.

Duncan Macnaughron of Edinburgh, Scotland, has made an exhaustive study of Egyptian chronology and has embodied the results of his
researches in his valuable book A Scheme of Egyptian Chronology
(161). He shows in that work that the long chronology based on Man
etho passes all critical examination wherever it can be tested. We are
convinced that this is so, and hence, in treating of the history of Egypt,
we are dating events according to the long chronology. We have the
highest respect for the scholarship of Professor Breasted, but his short
chronology in our opinion is now quite obsolete. Macnaughton com
piled a list giving estimates of the dates of the 1st, Vlth, XI 1th, and

We have been advised by Macnaughton that "none of these esti
mates ever gained universal acceptance/' Sir Wallis Budge made the
following statement in 1914: "At the present time the dates proposed
by Egyptologists for the reign of Menes are 5869, 5702, 5613, 5004,
4400 and 3315 B.C. ... the earliest date that has been proposed by
any Egyptologist is, in my opinion, far more likely to be correct than
such a date as 3315 B.C." (161, p. 6)



220 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
The first king of Dynasty I was Aha Mena, or Menes. This Pharaoh
ascended the throne in 5776 B.C., according to Manetho, and reigned
for sixty-two years. Before the time of Menes, there were many petty
kings ruling over small territories in Upper and Lower Egypt. One
tribe in Lower Egypt had sixty kings prior to the reign of Menes. The
tribal totem of this kingdom was the hornet, and the royal crown was a
low red cap with a high peak at the back. Further south was the realm
of the reed kingdom, whose regal headdress was a tall white crown. Still
more distant in regions to the south were two hawk kingdoms; and
these domains were in time united by marriage and conquest. The fa
ther of Menes ruled over the united kingdom of the reeds and hawks of
Upper Egypt and, by conquest, he annexed the hornet kingdom of
Lower Egypt. When Menes took over the kingship he combined the
red and white crowns into the famous double crown of United Egypt.
Even in predynastic times the Egyptians had reached a high level of
civilization; for they imported gold, silver, tin, lead, iron, hematite,
emery, galena, turquoise, obsidian, serpentine, lapis lazuli, coral, and
tortoise shell; and with these materials produced beautiful and useful
works of art which were to call forth the wonder and admiration of
later ages. Egypt's first Golden Age was inaugurated by an invasion
from Ethiopia. According to Petrie: "A conqueror of Sudani features,
founded the Third Dynasty and many entirely new ideas entered the
country. This new movement culminated in the vast schemes of
Khufu, one of history's most dominating personalities. With him the
lines of Egyptian growth were established; and the course of events be
came the subject of the written record. ("Modern Discovery of the
Unknown Past" by Sir W. M. Flinders Petrie in 1 10, p. 112)
The great achievement of the reign of Khufu was the building of the
Great Pyramid—a structure celebrated in the annals of history as one
of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The classic account of
the building of the Great Pyramid was related by Herodotus. From
that narrative, as translated by Canon George Rawlinson, we quote the
following extracts:
The Pyramid itself was twenty years in the building. It is a square 800
feet each way, . . . built entirely of polished stone, fitted together with the
utmost care. The stones of which it is composed are none of them less than
30 feet in length. . . . After laying the stones for the base, they raised the remaining stones to their places by means of machines formed of short
wooden planks. . . . There is an inscription in Egyptian characters on the



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 221
pyramid which records the quantity of radishes, onions and garlic con
sumed by the laborers who constructed it; and 1 perfectly well remember
that the interpreter who read the writing to me said that the money ex
pended in this way was about 1,600 talents of silver. If this, then, is a true
record, what a vast sum must have been spent on the iron tools used in the
work, and on the feeding and clothing of the laborers, considering the
length of time the work lasted, which has already been stated, and the addi
tional time—no small space I imagine—which must have been occupied by the quarrying of the stones, their conveyance, and the formation of the un
derground apartments. (118, p. 125)
The reader will have noticed that the Father of History specifically
referred to the iron tools used by the pyramid builders. Some modern
authorities deny that the Egyptians of the Pyramid Age possessed iron
implements. Professors King and Hall, of the Department of Egyptian
and Assyrian Antiquities, British Museum, have discussed this question
in their Egypt and Western Asia, to which the reader is referred.
The Abbe Thomas Moreux, eminent French astronomer, Director
of the Observatory of Bourges, produced a remarkable book The Mys
terious Science of the Pharaohs. In that work, he argued that the Great
Pyramid was used as a vault for the preservation of scientific instru
ments, and of standard weights and measures, rather than as a tomb. In
place of a sarcophagus, there was a granite slab, which served as stand
ard of measurement. The length of this slab was said to have been one
ten-millionth of the distance from either of the poles to the center of
the earth. This invariable distance, only recently determined by mod
ern scientists, is the basis of the metric system of measurement. The
distance from each pole to the center of the earth has been calculated as
3,949.79 miles. If this figure is correct, then the circumference of the
earth, measured as a great circle passing through the poles, is 24,817.32
miles. Abbe Moreux felt certain that these facts were known to the as
tronomers of ancient Egypt about six thousand years ago. The Sume
rians and Chaldeans of Mesopotamia were no mean students of astron
omy, but their best estimate of the circumference of the earth was
24,000 miles. The height of the Great Pyramid, at the time of its con
struction, was one-billionth of the distance from the earth to the sun
unit of measure not accurately established in modern times until 1874.
Abbe Moreux noted that this pyramid was oriented within one-twelfth
of a degree, a very accurate precision, and that the parallel of longitude
passing through the pyramid traverses the most land and least sea of
any in the world—a fact which also applies to the parallel of latitude



222 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
passing through the structure. In the north side of the Great Pyramid is
the entrance to an underground tunnel which is bored through 350 feet
of solid rock at an angle of 26 degrees, 1 7 minutes to the horizon.
Alpha Draconis, or Thuban, was the pole star about 3440 B.C., and for
several hundred years before and after that date. At its lower culmina
tion, when 3 degrees, 42 minutes from the pole, this star shone down
the underground tunnel. The ascending passage runs off from the un
derground tunnel of the pyramid at the base-line level; and the ascend
ing passage leads into the grand gallery. Both the ascending passage
and the grand gallery are inclined to the horizon at an angle of 26 de
grees and 17 minutes, the same as the inclination of the underground
tunnel, but in the opposite direction. These passages seem to have
served two purposes. Firstly, they enabled the builders to orient the
base and the lower layers of the pyramid up to the king's chamber in a
true north-south line. Secondly, the passages were so arranged that the
grand gallery could serve as the equivalent of the equatorial telescope of
a modern astronomical observatory.
The English astronomer, Richard A. Proctor, in his Problems of the
Pyramids presents much convincing evidence tending to show that the
Great Pyramid was used as an astronomical observatory. "The sun's
annual course round the celestial sphere," according to Proctor, "could be determined much more exactly than by any gnomon, by observa
tions made from the great gallery. The moon's monthly path and its
changes could have been dealt with in the same effective way. The ge
ometric paths, and thence the true paths of the planets, could be deter
mined very accurately. The place of any visible star along the zodiac
could be most accurately determined." (Cited by Samuel Laing in 138,
p. 56).
The triangular area of each of the four sides of the pyramid equals
the square of the vertical height. The added lengths of the four sides of
the square base bear to the vertical height the same proportion as that of
the circumference of a circle to its radius. This involves the mathemati
cal constant II (Pi). The numerical value of II, calculated to four deci
mal places, is 3.1416. The lengths of the base sides of the pyramid
added together would give us 3,055.16 feet. Its height is 486.23 feet.
Let us double the height, which gives us 972.46 feet. Now divide
3,055.16 by 972.46, and our answer comes out as 3.1416. Now let us
take the pyramidal height, 486.23 feet, and translate it into miles.
There are 5,280 feet in a mile, so we divide 486.23 by 5,280, and our
answer is 0.0921 mile. If we multiply 0.0921 by 1,000,000,000, we ob



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 223
tain 92,100,000 as an answer. In miles, this figure gives us the approximate distance of the earth from the sun. The average diameter of the earth has been calculated to be about 7,913.333 miles. This is changed
into feet by multiplying it by 5,280. (7,913.333 X 5,280 =
41,792,398.24 feet.) Now we divide this last figure by 20,000,000, and the resulting 2.09 feet is one twenty-millionth of the average diameter of the earth. In the words of an eminent mathematician, Professor
Aaron Bakst: "We are led to think that the Egyptian priests knew more about astronomy, the year, and the diameter of the earth than we
ever suspected." (6, p. 105) The length of each side of the square py
ramidal base measured 365% sacred cubits, which is equivalent to the
length of the year in days. The two diagonals of the base contained 25,824 pyramid inches, a good approximation of the number of years in
the precessional cycle. Professor Piazzi Smyth, a famous astronomer of the last century, made extensive measurements of the Great Pyramid. His results were summarized by Dr. Alfred Russell Wallace, in an ad
dress before the British Association for the Advancement of Science at
Glasgow in 1876, as follows:
1. That the pyramid is truly square, the sides being equal, and the angles
right angles;
2. That the four sockets on which the first four stones of the corners
rested are truly on the same level;
3. That the directions of the sides are accurate to the four cardinal
points;
4. That the vertical height of the pyramid bears the same proportion to
its circumference at the base as the radius of a circle does to its circumfer
ence.
Now all these measures, angles, and levels are accurate, not as an ordinary surveyor or builder could make them, but to such a degree as requires the very best modern instruments and all the refinements of geodetical sci
ence to discover any error at all. In addition to this, we have the wonderful
perfection of the workmanship in the interior of the pyramid, the passages and chambers being lined with huge blocks of stone fitted with the utmost
accuracy, while every part of the building exhibits the highest structural
science. (260, p. 117)
A talented young man from England landed in Egypt in 1881. This
individual, William Matthew Flinders Petrie, at that time only twenty
seven years of age, was soon to establish Egyptology on a truly scien
tific basis.
Petrie was an extraordinary man [we learn from a recent commentator] even among the other eminent Victorians. Though he never attended any



224 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
institution of higher learning, he made the pompous holders of a university
degree look like fumbling amateurs; and in due time, he was given honor
ary titles from dozens of academies and was appointed to England's first Chair of Egyptology, at the University of London. A man of enormous in
dependence of mind, he lacked the disposition to deal with officialdom and
often made scathing comments that, of course, reached the ears of his asso
ciates. Unfortunately, he was in need of official assistance, which at best, was precarious. That he managed at all was due to extreme austerity and
economy. (65, p. 99)
Petrie's first major undertaking in the archaeological field was a
study of the Great Pyramid, which kept him engaged for nearly two years. The young scientist was overwhelmed by the amazing crafts
manship displayed by the ancient builders. "The laying out of the base
of the Great Pyramid of Khufu," Petrie noted, "is a triumph of skill; its
errors both in length and in angles, could be covered by placing one's
thumb on them." But inside the structure he found some odd mistakes.
"After having levelled the casing so finely, the builders made a hundred
times the error in levelling the shorter length of the king's chamber, so
that they might have done it far better by just looking at the horizon.
After having dressed the casing joints so beautifully, they left the face
of the wall in the grand gallery rough chiselled." (Sir Flinders Petrie,
cited by Robert Silverberg in 227, p. 30) Petrie could only conclude
that an architectural and engineering genius had commenced the proj
ect and had died before the job was completed. His successor appar
ently was a man of lesser stature, who was both careless and inept. The
Pharaoh Khufu has been pictured by certain modern historians as a
cruel and remorseless tyrant who employed slave labor to erect his co
lossal pyramid; but this opinion is most certainly erroneous, for slavery
was practically unknown in ancient Egypt. "It seems that on the
whole," to cite a modern authority, "slavery never attained the serious
and infamous proportions that it had in Greece, or in Italy. The serf
age, which probably continued throughout the history, prevented the
requirements of slave labor on large estates. It was a mild and compara
tively harmless obligation, which did not prevent ability from rising,
and it saved the land from the ruin which slavery brings." (190, p. 25)
Some of the cinema spectaculars turned out by Hollywood studios
have given an entirely false picture of life in ancient Egypt. It is to the
credit of the English Egyptologist, Sir Arthur Weigall, that he has
made a protest against this type of propaganda. We have been assured by Weigall that:



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 225
The kindest race of the ancient world was that of the Egyptians; and if
we direct our course to the Nile Valley of three or four thousand years ago,
we shall find conditions there so humane that instances of pharaonic cruelty such as we have been shown in some recent film dramas will be seen at
once to reflect the mentality of the producer and not that of the people he
has thought to portray. The Egyptians were seldom consciously cruel; they
did not grind men to pulp under the wheels of their juggernauts, they did
not lash their laboring slaves, they did not torture people, they did not cal
lously inflict death upon anybody—in fact, they never did any of the things
of this sort which the film producers are at such pains to present to us. (262,
p. 58)
Weigall was Inspector General of Antiquities for the Egyptian gov
ernment for several years and had a wide and sound knowledge of the
ancient mores of the Egyptian people. For more details, the reader is
referred to the work cited above. "The Egyptians, indeed," Sir Arthur
concluded, "were tenderhearted to an astonishing extent; and that
being so, let me urge the film producer, should he feel impelled to wal
low for a while in the sink of iniquity, to leave out of the picture these
humane dwellers on the banks of the Nile. The bestial, half naked,
hairy chested executioner, beloved of Hollywood, did not exist in
Egypt." (262, p. 63) The building of the Great Pyramid was a skillfully organized project. One hundred thousand men were employed, three months at a
time, in transporting the rocks to the construction site. This was during
the season of the inundation, when there was no other work to be done.
Ten years were spent in constructing the great causeway, over which
the stones were hauled, and in preparing the site, and leveling and hol
lowing out the underground tunnel and chamber. The actual construc
tion required an additional twenty years. Sir Flinders Petrie has given
us a vivid impression of how this vast engineering enterprise was ac
complished:
This time would imply that a gang of eight men (about as many as could
work on one block) could move ten stones from the quarry across the Nile, up the causeways and have raised into place within three months. This
would be quite possible with good organization. There are several cause
ways besides the main one, still visible on the desert, and they must have been closely packed by working gangs to get up the thousand blocks every
day during the working season. Of course, there were also highly skilled
masons necessary for the thirteen acres of finely jointed casing, and the in
ternal parts; the barracks for these are still visible and would hold at the out



226 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
side 4000 men, who would live there continuously. If half of them were en
gaged on the casing, each man would have to prepare accurately and fit in
place one casing block every three weeks, or rather, a gang of three men
doing a block in a week. This is also a reasonable result. Of course, the
great blocks at the base would take far longer and the small courses would
be done in perhaps half the time for each stone. . . . Much nonsense has
been written about the oppression of the people, their tears and groans.
With the splendid organization evident in the work, the people must have
been well managed, and there was no hardship, whatever, in carrying out
the work. Each man might have been levied twice in his lifetime; he would
be just as well off there as at home, for he could do nothing during the in
undation. All that was necessary was to transport a couple of hundredweight of food with him, which he would eat there instead of at home. The
immense gain to the people was the education in combined work and tech
nical training. (190, pp. 25-27)
An unusual feature connected with the orientation of the Great Pyr
amid was studied by Colonel Braghine, which we let him present in his own words:
A detailed study of the structure will convince any investigator that the
wealth of mathematical, geometrical and astronomical data concealed
within it is not accidental, but has been produced intentionally after numer
ous and complex calculations, made by somebody possessing an astounding
amount of knowledge. . . . Not the least interesting detail concerning the
orientation of the pyramid is the following: the reflection of the sun rays
from the sides of the pyramid indicate almost exactly the equinoxes and sol
stices and therefore, the sowing time. The northern side of the pyramid is
lighted at sunrise for some moments during the period from the spring equinox to the autumn equinox. During the remainder of the year, the
southern side is lighted from sunrise till sunset. This phenomenon fixes the
moment of the equinoxes within 12 hours. When the stone facing was intact, this phenomenon of the missing shadows must have been still more pronounced and was noticed by the ancients. The Latin poet Ausonius
writes: "Quadrata cui in fastigo cono surgit et ipsa suas consumit puramis umbras" ("The pyramid itself swallows the shadow born on its summit"). This phenomenon has now been explained by Professor Pochan, who dis
covered that the northern and southern sides of the pyramid are not true
planes, but dihedral angles of 1 79 degrees, 50 minutes. Thus in plain speak
ing, the sides in question have been hollowed out to the extent of 64 centi
meters, insuring a rapid disappearance of the shadow of the sunrise at the
equinoxes. (14, pp. 237-38)



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 227
Among the great inventions of the Egyptians were the alphabet,
paper, ink, and the pen. The earliest paper was made of thin strips of
papyrus reed, pasted together. Ink was made from vegetable gum and
soot mixed with water. By dipping a pointed reed in the ink, the Egyp
tian scribe wrote messages on the papyrus sheets. Writing was a basic
invention, and its influence on the evolution of civilization was pro
found. As Breasted has truly asserted: ''The invention of writing and of
a convenient system of records on paper has had a greater influence in
uplifting the human race than any other intellectual achievement in the
career of man. It was more important than all the battles ever fought
and all the constitutions ever devised." (15, p. 45)
Another great Egyptian invention was the calendar. The earliest
Egyptians measured time by observing the phases of the moon. The
month (the interval between two new moons) was the unit of time
measurement. Unfortunately, the lunar month varies in length from
twenty-nine to thirty days, and hence the moon calendar is cumber
some and inaccurate. The lunar year of 354 days falls short of the solar
year by eleven days. Such a calendar can be made to work only by in
tercalating an extra month at suitable intervals; and the Egyptians met
this difficulty by devising an accurate calendar. It was noticed by them
that the dog star Sothis, or Sirius, rose heliacally (before sunrise) on
July 19th, at the beginning of the inundation (the annual overflow of
the Nile). One of the earliest fixed dates in recorded history is believed
to have been July 19, 4236 B.C., for on this date, it is said, our calendar
was born. This calendar consisted of twelve months, each of thirty
days' duration. To this total of 360 days were added five extra days at
the end of the year. Each thirty-day month was divided into three
weeks of ten days each, and there were three seasons recognized, each
of four months. The seasons bore the following names: (1) Inundation,
(2) Seed Time, (3) Harvest.
The Egyptian calendar is given below, and, for the benefit of the
reader, the months of our own Gregorian calendar are correlated:

The astronomers of ancient Egypt knew that the true length of the
years was close to 365 4 days and that the calendar could have been im
proved by inserting an extra day every four years. King Ptolemy Euer
getes issued a decree in 238 B.C. ordering that every fourth year
should be of 366 days' duration, but the Egyptians were opposed to the
institution of leap year, so they just ignored the royal decree. This ven
erable calendar, established in Egypt around six thousand years ago, has
descended down the stream of history to our own day. It was nearly
ruined by a couple of Roman politicians, who were bent on getting
their names perpetuated in the calendar. Julius Caesar, for instance, is
commemorated by the month July. Then Augustus Caesar insisted on
having the month of August in the calendar to perpetuate his name.
Not being satisfied with thirty-day months, these imperial personages
made July and* August into thirty-one-day months at the expense of
February, which was reduced to twenty-eight days. As a result of this
calendrical jugglery, we now have November, which was originally the
ninth month, showing up as the eleventh, and December, originally the
tenth month, winding up as the twelfth. The division of the circle into
360 parts may have also been an Egyptian invention. This point was
discussed by Breasted in a lecture, which we are pleased to quote:
It is certain that the length of the stellar year as recorded by successive
sunrise reappearances of Sirius was at first roughly established by the Egyp
tians as 360 days. As early as the fourth thousand-years B.C., that is, well
back of 3000 B.C., we find this 360-day year divided into 36 decads of 10
days each, for grouping the constellations along the celestial equator. This
appearance of a circle of 36 decads in the fourth millennium B.C. is highly
significant. It is certainly the oldest appearance of a circle of 360 divisions.
The Sumerian sexagesimal system, in which 60 appears as a numerical unit



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 229
(called sussu), is without doubt enormously old; and in all probability arose
from the length of the year— 360 days—by dividing it into six parts. ("The
Beginnings of Time—Measurement and the Origins of Our Calendar," a
lecture delivered by Professor James Henry Breasted at New York Univer
sity, May 16, 1935)
Breasted thought that the sexagesimal system of circular measure
ment was known earlier in Egypt than in Babylonia, but conceded that
it might have been derived by both the Egyptians and the Sumerians
from some more ancient common culture. (See 1 7.)
Before taking leave of Egypt's first Golden Age, we must say some
thing about Imhotep, the architect who designed the first pyramid.
This truly great man was vizier to King Zoser of Dynasty III (5345
5307 B.C.). He was also an astronomer, and held the post of Chief
Physician to the sovereign. In later days, he was deified, becoming the
God of Medicine. Known to the Greeks as Imouthes, he was metamor
phosed into their own Aesculapius. "A temple was erected to him near
the Serapeum at Memphis," we have been told by Breasted, "and at
the present day, every museum possesses a bronze statuette or two of
this apotheosized wise man, the proverb-maker, physician and architect
of Zoser. The priests who conducted the rebuilding of the Temple of
Edfu under the Ptolemies claimed to be reproducing the structure
formerly erected there after plans of Imhotep; and it may, therefore,
well be that Zoser was the builder of a temple there." (16, p. 95)
Egypt's first Golden Age ended in 4163 B.C. when the death of
King Neterkere ended the Vlth Dynasty. From 4163 to 3554 B.C.,
chaos prevailed in the Nile Valley, and this intermediate period covers
Dynasties VII through X. Often several rulers claimed the throne at
one time. This period of confusion was ended by a Theban nobleman
named Intef, who became the first king of Dynasty XI, which began
the Middle Kingdom. Intef I was succeeded by Intef II, who, in turn,
was followed by five Mentuhoteps. Mentuhotep V was so feeble that
he was dethroned by Amenemhet I, who established Dynasty XII.
This monarch was a man of outstanding ability. An inscription of his
age states that "he restored that which he found ruined; that which a
city had taken from its neighbor; while he caused city to know its
boundary with city, establishing their landmarks like the heavens, dis
tinguishing their waters according to what was in the writings, investi
gating according to that which was of old, because he so greatly loved
justice." (Cited by Robert Silverberg in 227, p. 9)



230 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Under Sesostris I (3 373-3327 B.C.) a period of expansion ensued,
and the boundaries of Egypt were extended into the Kingdom of Kush
in the south. The armies of Amenemhet II invaded the Sinai Peninsula
and, under Sesostris III, the conquest was extended into Syria. Since
the dollar has a tendency to follow the flag, the Egyptian merchants
followed in the wake of the armies, and the country benefited from the
resulting foreign commerce. In 3184 B.C., Amenemhet IV died leav
ing no heir to the throne. This created a problem, for in Egypt, as in
most African kingdoms, the kingship was inherited through the
daughter of the monarch. That is to say, the new queen transmitted the
regal prerogatives to her husband, who became the next pharaoh. The
kingly office passed from father to son-in-law; and in order to preserve
the royal succession within the family, the custom was to have the old
est son of the king marry his oldest sister, through whom the right of
sovereignty was transmitted. This made the son of the king also his
son-in-law, and gave him the right of succession to the throne. Amen
emhet IV had followed the prescribed procedure by marrying his sister
Sebeknefrure. Since he had died childless, the queen was privileged to
select the next king, inasmuch as her husband would, by law, inherit
the crown. Queen Sebeknefrure, it was assumed, would marry a The
ban noble and elevate him to the throne, but instead she married a com
moner from lower Egypt. The result of this action was a state of civil
war, for the Theban nobility refused to have a northerner from the
Delta as their king; and the ensuing civil strife lasted for about one
hundred years. Kings of Dynasty XIII ruled from Thebes, and a rival
ruler of Dynasty XIV occupied the throne at Memphis; while both
monarchs claimed the succession to Dynasty XII. The armies of both
regimes fought each other up and down the valley with neither side
being able to gain a victory. Now, while this senseless civil war was
going on, the country was invaded by nomads from Asia, known as the
Hyksos, or Shepherd-Kings. First, they conquered Lower Egypt, then
moved up the river and captured Thebes; and these foreign invaders dominated Egypt during the XVth, XVlth, and XVIIth Dynasties, a
time span of about 1 50 years.
While these alien kings controlled the land, certain Theban nobles
traveled southward to Kush and organized an underground liberation movement. The Hyksos were finally expelled from Thebes by an
army led by the Pharaoh Sekenenre, who ended his career on the field
of battle. He was followed in the kingship by the Theban monarch,
Ahmose I, who ascended the throne in 1709 B.C. This king led his



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 231
army to the north, liberated Memphis, and drove the Hyksos out of
Egypt into the desert of Sinai. Thus was the beginning of Dynasty XVI11, which inaugurated the time of the New Kingdom. The new
line of kings erected palaces and temples at Thebes which were among the wonders of the world and were heralds of a new Golden Age in the
Nile Valley. Under Thutmose I (1662-1628) Egyptian imperialism
reached its zenith. An admirable summary of this achievement has been
given by Professor Breasted:
Egypt had now become the controlling power in the far reaching group
of civilizations clustering in and about the eastern end of the Mediterra
nean, the center, perhaps the nucleus of the civilized world of rhat day. . . .
Seated astride both the intercontinental and interoceanic highway, Egypt
was building up and dominating the world of contiguous Africa and Eura
sia. Traditional limits disappeared, the currents of life eddied no longer
within the landmarks of tiny kingdoms, but pulsed from end to end of a great empire, embracing many kingdoms and tongues, from the Upper
Nile to the Upper Euphrates. The wealth of Asiatic trade circulating through the eastern end of the Mediterranean which once flowed down the
Euphrates to Babylon, was thus diverted to the Nile Delta, long before
united by canal with the Red Sea. All the world traded in the Delta mar
kers. ("Zenith of Egyptian Power" by James Henry Breasted, in 37, Vol.
II, p. 88)
The true glory of the age culminated in the reign of Amenhotep 111 (1538-1501 B.C.). Timber was imported from Syria, and large
seaworthy ships were built. With this fleet the Egyptian mariners and
merchants sailed down the East African coast and traded with the peo
ple of Punt, from whom they imported cargoes of ebony, ivory, ostrich
feathers, spices, and gold. To the south, they extended their sway over
the Kushites of Nubia, and in the north, they overwhelmed a confederation of foes in a battle at Har-Meggiddo (Armageddon). The domain
of Amenhotep III extended from the confines of Rush to the plains of
Shinar; and all these territories were so well organized and so fairly
governed as to greatly enhance their productive potential. Thebes ex
panded into a mighty metropolis with walls nine miles in circumfer
ence. In the suburbs, elegant mansions were erected for the nobility,
some of them containing fifty or sixty rooms. Their walls were deco
rated with fine paintings. They were fitted out with costly and attrac
tive inlaid furniture, and adorned with beautiful vases and skillfully
carved ornaments and utensils of bronze, ebony, and ivory. Along the
river front, superb temples were built by order of the king and were



232 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
linked together by impressive avenues of sphinxes. Surrounding the
mansions and temples were tree-shaded boulevards and gardens of
flowers, while the adjacent landscape was enhanced by a series of lakes.
Since the horse had been introduced into Egypt by the Hyksos, an im
proved system of transport developed: Bigger and better roads were
constructed, and Egyptian gentlemen traversed the highways in swift horse-drawn chariots.
The death of Amenhotep III, in 1 501 B.C., ended a brilliant reign of
thirty-six years and five months. He was succeeded by his son, the boy
Amenhotep IV. Queen Ti, mother of the young king, acted as regent
until her son reached his majority. The new monarch inaugurated a re
ligious revolution which brought him fame and, at the same time, ended the Golden Age established by his father. The young pharaoh betook himself from Thebes and established a new city, Tell el Amarna, as his capital. He repudiated the numerous gods of the Egyptian pantheon, and recognized only one god, Aton, whose symbol was the flaming disk of the sun; and he even renamed himself Ikhnaton (devoted to Aton). The nomarchs (provincial governors) had warned him that hostile armies were gathering on the borders and planning to in
vade the nation, but he heeded them not. The priests of the disestab
lished cults finally rebelled and Ikhnaton, the Heretic king, died ignominiously, probably poisoned by his enemies; and the Aton cult was abolished. On the enthronement of his youthful son-in-law, Tutankha
men, the capitol was moved back to Thebes, and the old religious cults were restored to power. The career of King Tut was ended by his
early death, at the age of seventeen years. Then the throne was seized by a priest named Eye, whose reign brought ruin to the country; for,
during his brief rule, nearly all the foreign territories annexed by the great kings of Dynasty XVIII were lost. Harmhab, a general from the North, ascended the river and toppled the usurper Eye from the
throne, and brought the period of decline to an end. The monotheistic Aton cult was crushed in Egypt, but it did not
perish entirely; since there was a young priest Moshe (Moses), who
had received his theological education at the Temple of Heliopolis, and who became a disciple of Ikhnaton. When Atonism was suppressed in Egypt, Moses led a group of heretics out of the country and reestab
lished the cult in Palestine. The Egyptian historian, Manetho, is our
authority for saying that Moses was an Egyptian priest. His opinion was endorsed by Strabo, who wrote: "Moses, who was one of the Egyptian priests, taught riis followers that it was an egregious error to
represent the deity under the form of animals, as the Egyptians did, or



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 233
in the shape of man, as was rhe practice of the Greeks and Africans.
... It is for this reason, that, rejecting every species of images or idols, Moses wished the deity to be worshipped without emblems and according to his proper nature; and he accordingly ordered a temple wor
thy of him to be erected." (Strabo, Geography, Book 16, cited by Count Volney in 258, pp. 150-51) Moses, as we know, did not enjoy an unqualified success in his promulgation of the new religion, since
many of his followers still recognized the old gods.
But in vain did he proscribe the worship of the symbols which prevailed in lx)wer Egypt and Phoenicia: as Volney observed, "for his god was, nevertheless, an Egyptian god invented by those priests of whom Moses had
been the disciple. ... In vain did Moses wish to blot from his religion
everything which had relation to the stars; many traits call them to mind in
spite of all he has done. The seven planetary luminaries of the great candle
stick; the twelve stones, or signs in the Urim of the high priests; the feasts
of the two equinoxes (entrances and gates of the two hemispheres); the cer
emony of the lamb (the celestial ram, then in the fifteenth degree); ... all
remain as so many witnesses of the filiation of his ideas, and of their extrac
tion from the common source. (258, pp. 149-51)
The Temple of Amen-Ra at Karnak, erected in 3700 B.C., was one
of the glories of ancient Egypt. "The temple built at Thebes," Profes
sor DuBois noted, "had a relief representing the four courts of the four
quarters of the Nilotic world: Dedun, the great God of Ethiopia, repre
sents the south; Sopd, the eastern desert; Sebek, the western desert; and
Horus, the north." (75, p. 137) Of all the solar temples of old Egypt,
this one was indubitably the most impressive. Sir Norman Lockyer,
one of the great astronomers of modern times, has given us a fine de
scription of this ancient temple in his excellent book The Dawn of Astronomy: A Study of the Temple Worship and Mythology of the Ancient
Egyptians, which we quote:
The solar temple of Amen-Ra at Karnak is the finest Egyptian solar temple which remains open to our examination. It is beyond all question the most majestic ruin in the world. It covers about twice the area covered by
St. Peter's at Rome, so that the whole structure was of a vastness absolutely unapproached in the modern ecclesiastical world. It is one of the most soulinspiring temples which have ever been conceived or built by man. There is a sort of stone avenue in the center giving a view towards the northwest, and this axis is something like five hundred yards in length. The whole ob
ject of the builder of the great temple at Karnak was to preserve that axis
absolutely open, the point being that the axis should be absolutely open
straight and true. The axis was directed toward the hills on the west side of



234 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
the Nile where are located the tombs of the kings. From the entrance py
lons the temple stretches through various halls of different sizes and details
until at last at the extreme end what is called the Sanctuary, Naos, Adytum, or Holy of Holies is reached. The end of the temple at which the pylons are
situated is open, the other closed. Every part of the temple was built to sub
serve a special object, viz. to limit the light which fell on its front into a nar
row beam and to carry it to the other extremity of the temple into the sanc
tuary so that once a year, when the sun set at the solstice, the light is passed
without interruption along the whole length of the temple finally illumi
nating the sanctuary in most resplendent fashion and striking the sanctu
ary wall. We find that a narrow beam of sunlight coming through a narrow en
trance some five hundred yards away from the door of the Holy of Holies
would, provided the temple were properly oriented to the solstice, and pro
vided the solstice occurred at the absolute moment of sunrise, or sunset, ac
cording to which the temple was being utilized, practically flash into the
sanctuary and remain there for about a couple of minutes, and then pass
away. . . . The magnificent burst of light at sunset into the sanctuary
would show that a new true solar year was beginning. (Sir Norman Lockyer in The Dawn of Astronomy, cited by William Tyler Olcott in 1 80, pp. 274-77)
The Grand High Priest of the Temple of Amen-Ra in the year 500 B.C. was a dark and handsome man named Mesocharis. He was about
sixty years of age, possessed of superior intellect and vast learning. He
was preparing to celebrate the festival of the New Year, and was stand
ing in the rear end of the world's largest temple, in a room which was
an exact cube in form; for its length, height, and width were all equal
to each other. He was clad in fine linen of royal purple color, which
was decorated with cloth of gold. On his head was a lofty mitre,
adorned with sparkling jewels and the insignia of his high office. He
wore on his breast a plate, ten inches square, set with twelve gem
stones arranged in four rows, each containing three stones each. These
precious stones were symbols of the zodiacal signs, and they were the
following: sardius, topaz, carbuncle, emerald, sapphire, diamond, lig
ure, agate, amethyst, beryl, onyx, jasper.
Each of these stones of the oracular breastplate was set in a socket of
gold, with the diamond located in the center position and representing
the constellation of Leo the Lion, since therein the summer solstice oc
curred. The waist of the priest was circled by an abnet, a girdle woven
from the finest linen, and dyed with the colors blue, purple, and scarlet.
His ephod, or tunic, was also an embroidered coat of fine twined linen
adorned with the figures of stars, gods, men, the sun, and animals.



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 235
Over his shoulders rested a leopard skin, his feer were clad in jewel-be
decked sandals, and he carried in his right hand a wand fashioned of
wood and gold. Mesocharis, as Grand High Priest, ranked second only
to the reigning pharaoh. He was descended from a long line of priests
going as far back as the Illrd Dynasty. In the temple library were his
torical data, genealogies of preceding priests, records of festivals and of
astronomical phenomena, especially those pertaining to the zodiac.
When the sun apparently crosses the celestial equator in March and
September, at the time of the equinoxes, it sets exactly in the west, if
the center of the sun crosses the equator at the moment of sunset. The
distance measured on the horizon to the north or south of the equator is
called amplitude, and is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds of
arc. At the moment of sunset, the distance of the sun's center from the
equator may be found with precision with modern instruments. After
the apparent equatorial crossing, the sun moves a certain distance
northward, then halts for a moment at maximum amplitude, then re
treats again toward the equator. The ancient Temple of Amen-Ra had
its central aisle directed toward the point where the sun set at the very
moment when its center was at the greatest possible distance from the
celestial equator, in summer, in the northern half of the celestial sphere.
This solar temple faced to the northwest, and a straight line drawn
from the position of the center of the sun at the summer and winter
solstices would traverse the axis of this temple. This imaginary line was
in the exact plane of the orbit of the earth; and extended from the
tropic of Cancer to that of Capricorn. Since this temple was con
structed for the specific purpose of garnering the light of the sun in the
sanctuary at sunset of the summer solstice, its northwest end was open,
whereas its southeast end was walled up completely. From time imme
morial, a high priest had officiated at the New Year ceremonial in the
temple, but in the year 500 B.C. something unusual happened, and the
Grand High Priest Mesocharis faced a crisis in his career. The story of
this incident has been told so well by Professor Edgar L. Larkin that
we give it in his own words:
For centuries, a high priest of Egypt had entered the Holy of Holies
once each year on the day of the summer solstice to behold the rays from
the setting sun, the sun of Egypt, come stealing into the dark and silent
sanctuary. For when the tiny pencil appeared on a polished reflecting sur
face in the darkened room, that supreme moment was the instant of New Year. This New Year's day was of far more importance to the Egyptians
than it is to us, for on an average, during thousands of years, the Nile began
to rise on the solstitial day, the day of days. From lethargy, a nation wak



236 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
ened into activity in a day. Agriculture began from Philae to Memphis; and
the entire country soon put on garments of living green. . . . The day of
the summer solstice was to the Egyptians as great as the winter solstice
Christmas—is to northern races.
On this solstice, however, the High Priest came an hour earlier than
usual to his beloved sanctuary. The first and entirely usual act of Meso
charis was to make the thin opening in the door of the Holy of Holies nar
rower than before. The mark on the rear wall, where the central ray from the sun had fallen for more than 3000 years was inspected and the dust re
moved. During the day, he had seen that all apertures along the axis of the
temple were in order and that no side light disturbed the straight band from
the sun. Then the multitude was admitted. . . . The sun approached the
horizon. Nearer it declined, and finally the critical moment arrived. The
tension in the minds of the people was intense. The priest opened wide the
door, held a diamond in the beam, flashed the light to all parts of the temple,
and gave his annual blessing to the waiting thousands, and proclaimed the
glad New Year. The people, with a mighty shout, rushed into the streets
with trumpets, proclaiming "New Year, New Year, the Nile, the waters,
joy and happiness!" The great festival was in progress and good will
reigned throughout the entire nation.
Everybody was happy except Mesocharis, the august High Priest of
Egypt, one of the most exalted dignitaries in the world. His mind was a tu
multuous sea, a tempest raged within. Dismay, alarm, and fear, a nameless
kind of dread filled his very being with crushing power. The central solar ray
did not fall on the ancient mark in the wall of Egypt's Holy of Holies; but to
one side, towards the north! (141, pp. 232-35)
Mesocharis was sorely troubled, for he knew that the pharaoh would
call for some sort of explanation of this unusual happening, and the
problem utterly baffled him. He summoned to Thebes the priests of the
solar temples in Memphis, Abydos, and Heliopolis for a conference,
and in due time they came. They had also noticed that the sun's rays
missed their mark, but could not figure out the reason why. Pinotem, a
priest from Memphis, suggested that they visit the king in a body and
tell him what had happened to the light of Egypt on New Year's day.
The assembled priests, headed by Mesocharis, approached the throne
of the reigning monarch and related to him the bad news. The pharaoh
was astounded and asked that they meet with him again on the third
day for further discussion of the problem.
What then happened is best told in the words of Professor Larkin:
Every nation of antiquity from Gaul to India had esoteric mysteries, se
cret societies, whose members were received by solemn rites of initiation.



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 237
The chief or grand lodge of Egypt (also the chief one in the world), was
due to meet in the great Labyrinth in Arsinoe, on the day of the first full
moon after the summer solstice. On the third day, the four priests came to counsel with their monarch. The approaching Grand Lodge was mentioned, of which the king was Grand Master and must preside, while Meso
charis himself was Grand Warden. Meines, priest of the solar temple at
Heliopolis, proposed that inquiry be made of all priests and delegates from the temples of Egypt and from temples in foreign countries to find whether
their temples were turning. Hikten, priest of the nome of Abydos, agreed
to the plan. Meanwhile, it was decided that this shifting of the solar rays
should nor be revealed to the people and by no means, to the army, save to
its commanders who were initiates into the mysteries.
When the full moon appeared, the grand Labyrinth was a scene of ani
mation. Hierophants, princes, scholars, literary men, and the most intellec
tual men of the world filled the enormous rooms; traversed the mysterious
subterranean ways and corridors, and held feasts of intellect amid surround
ings of culture and refinement. Members of the mysteries of Isis and Osiris
came from Ellora, Persepolis, Susa, Eckbatana, Nineveh, Babylon, Palmyra, Jerusalem, Tyre, Sidon, Athens, Dodona, Eleusis, Samothrace, Corinth and Rome. Many candidates from the temples in these world centers were
waiting to receive initiatory rites in the Labyrinth. When all business had
been transacted, the subject of the shifting of solar temples was broached by
the king. Pent-up excitement at once broke forth. Every priest present from every temple in the cities mentioned had noticed the mystery. No one
could even suggest a cause.
Priests of many other types of religion were present, also Hierophants
were in attendance who presided over sacrifices and rites in vast temples
orientated towards the larger stars. Temples in all parts of the world, of
porphyry, marble and onyx, whose axes were directed to the stars, Sirius,
Canopus, Aldebaran, Vega, Arcturus and others, were declared to be turning their Holy of Holies away from the tiny beams. Consternation filled
the minds of all. They realized that they were in the presence of an appall
ing awe-inspiring mystery. Could the gods be displeased with all mankind? And were all hierarchies and kingdoms to end? Were the gods preparing to
destroy man and the earth? (141, pp. 239-41)
We can readily understand the puzzlement of the ancient Egyptian
priests when faced with these baffling astronomical problems. The star
temples had been giving the Egyptian priests trouble long before the
building of solar temples. They had experienced the shifting positions
of the stars, but that the movements of the sun-god Ra should become
unpredictable was something that they could in no way explain. Olcotr
noticed that: "An extremely interesting feature of Egyptian temple
orientation, although it only pertains to temples dedicated to star wor



238 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
ship, is found in the fact that the precession of the equinoxes necessi
tated an alteration of the axis of the temple at long intervals to accom
modate the change of direction of the star to which the temple was
originally oriented. At Luxor and many other places in Egypt, there
are to be seen evidences of this change, a- later axis having been con
structed to meet the new requirements/' (180, p. 277) George St.
Clair argued that, though the Egyptian astronomers were acquainted
with the precession of the equinoxes, they were ignorant of its cause
and perplexed by the change it produced in the declination of the stars.
"It dislocated their catalogs and the havoc which it wrought seemed to
be so entirely mischievous that it could only be attributed to powers in
imical to the divine order. To this notion we owe many of the myths."
(219, p. 43) We have noted that the Temple of Amen-Ra at its building in 3700
B.C. was oriented to the plane of the earth's orbit. But the plane of the
earth's orbit has a motion of its own, not connected with the precession
of the equinoxes, and this was a mystery that the ancient astronomers
did not even suspect. According to Professor Edgar L. Larkin: "Long
before the temple was erected, this plane had been slowly moving
nearer to the plane of the earth's equator; and is still, and will for sev
eral thousand years to come. It will stop and slowly retrace its steps,
thus rocking to and fro like a pendulum, to a distance of one and one
half degrees on each side of its middle position. The cause is the in
fluence of attraction and motions of all the planets, Jupiter, Saturn, etc.,
on the earth." (141, p. 241) Professor Larkin, in the early years of the
present century, was Director of the Lowe Observatory on Echo
Mountain, in the Sierra Madre Range of California. He was a distin
guished astronomer and wrote many scientific articles for The Open
Court, a quality monthly magazine published in Chicago and edited by
Dr. Paul Carus, the well-known philosopher. Dynasty XIX began with the reign of Hormhab (1454-1395 B.C.),
but the great ruler of this dynasty was Rameses II (1394-1328 B.C.).
This king in his sixty-six-year reign conquered extensive territories in
western Asia and built colossal temples in the Nile Valley. In Ethiopia,
Rameses was worshiped as a god; for among the Kushites, he erected
six temples dedicated to Amen, Ra, and Ptah. In discussing these tem
ples, Breasted stated that "in all of them, Rameses was more or less
prominently worshipped, and in one, his queen, Nefretiri, was the pre
siding divinity. Of his Nubian sanctuaries, the great rock temple at
Abu Simbel is the finest, and deservedly the goal of modern travellers



ETHIOPIA AND EGYPT 239
in Egypt." (16, pp. 373-75) Rameses III (1230-1199 B.C.) of Dy
nasty XX was also a great ruler. He was succeeded by eight other
kings, all named Rameses, but none of them could be called great.
From 1075 to 714 B.C., a time known as Egypt's 3rd Intermediate
Period, there were four dynasties: XXI, XX11, XXIII, and XXIV, with some of the rulers being of Libyan and Ethiopian origin. Sheshonk I
(926-905 B.C.), a Libyan, led an army into Palestine, captured Jerusa
lem, and looted King Solomon's Temple. Then, in 761 B.C., Piankhi,
the Ethiopian, ascended the throne of Egypt, and rarely after that date
was Egypt under the rule of native monarchs. Piankhi began his career
as king of Kush and, from his palace in Napata, watched with misgiv
ings the tribute of gold, cattle, and soldiers which his country was obli
gated to send to King Orsokon III of Egypt. Finally, deciding to end
this state of affairs, he fitted out a large fleet, raised a mighty army, and
descended the river to lay siege to Hermopolis. The local ruler, King
Namlot, surrendered the city to the Ethiopian conqueror. From an in
scription of Piankhi, we read: "Hermopolis threw herself upon her
belly and pleaded before the king. Messengers came forth and de
scended bearing everything beautiful to behold; gold, every splendid
costly stone, clothing in a chest, and the diadem which was upon his
head; the uraeus which inspireth fear of him, without ceasing during
many days." On visiting the royal stables, Piankhi was saddened by the
malnutrition suffered by the horses during the siege of the city, so he
said to the former ruler of the place: "By God! 1 swear it grieves me
more that these horses have been starved than any other mischief that
you, Namlot, have caused." Then he proceeded to another city, and delivered this ultimatum:
"You suicidal, silly and miserable creatures! If an hour passes without
your opening your gates to me, you are dead men; and as it would be
painful to me to have to kill you, do not close the door upon life and do
not court death in this manner."
The garrison surrendered the city, and not one life was lost. On ap
proaching another city, Piankhi sent a message to the enemy, saying:
"Open your gates and you shall live; close them and you shall die."
The garrison surrendered, and Piankhi entered the city and held a
service in the local temple. The Kushite conqueror, continuing down
the river, next took Memphis. Then he crossed the Nile to Heliopolis
and was met there by King Osorkon III of Bubastis, who yielded his
regal powers to the Ethiopian monarch. On returning to Napata, Pian
khi had a granite stele set up in the temple of Amen and, on the four



240 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
sides of this monument, he described his successful campaign in detail.
This ancient record possesses intrinsic merit and has been praised by a
modern Egyptologist as follows:
It displays literary skill, and an appreciation of dramatic situations which
is notable, while the vivacious touches wound here and there quite relieve it of the arid tone usual in such hieroglyphic documents. The imagination en
dures the personages appearing here more easily with life than those of any
other similar historical narrative of Egypt; and the humane Piankhi espe
cially, the lover of horses, remains a man far removed from the conventional
companion and equal of the gods who inevitably occupied the exalted
throne of the pharaohs in all other such records. (16, p. 456)
The XXIVth Dynasty consisted of one Bocchoris, who, according
to Manetho, reigned only six years (720-714 B.C.). The XXVth Dy
nasty has been called the Kushite or Ethiopian Dynasty; and it began in
714 B.C. when, according to Herodotus: "Egypt was invaded by a vast
army of Ethiopians, led by Sabacos, their king." (117, p. 129) This
ruler, better known as Shabaka (714-702 B.C.), undertook the con
quest of Lower Egypt, and there established Ethiopian supremacy. He
then started an Asiatic campaign by waging war on the Assyrians. In
that campaign, his army escaped defeat only because the Assyrian hosts
were afflicted by a plague and were forced to retreat. This king was
followed by Shabataka, who, after reigning twelve years, was slain by
Taharka, who seized the crown and set up his capital at Tanis. The
reign of this pharaoh was marked by prosperity and cultural advance.
Sir Arthur Weigall has referred to this period as "that astonishing
epoch of nigger dominion." (262, p. 222) There is a tradition that Ta
harka led expeditions as far as the Strait of Gibraltar, but in the end he
failed to contain his enemies. The country was faced by an invasion
from Assyria, and Taharka fought the Assyrians until age forced him
to turn over the reins of government to Tanutamen; but the new king
could not halt the invading foe, and Ashurbanipal's Assyrian armies as
cended the Nile and captured and looted the great city of Thebes. The
Assyrians, however, couldn't hold Egypt, so they soon retreated to
their own land. The next dynasty, the XXVIth, lasted from 684 to 525
B.C. After that, no native Egyptian king ruled over the Nilotic domin
ions.
The last great African potentate to reign over Egypt, Ahmose II
(569-525 B.C.), was of Libyan ancestry; and this king, whom the
Greeks called Amasis, was a great statesman. However, he failed to



KT HI OP I A AND EGYPT 241
save his country from foreign domination. The best soldiers of the
Egyptian army had years before deserted to the Ethiopian king at
Meroe, and Amasis had to depend on Libyan and Greek mercenaries
for defense against foreign invasion. Being an able diplomat, he man
aged to maintain peace in the realm, but after his death, early in 525
B.C., the kingship fell to Psamtik III. A few months later, the land of Egypt was overrun by the armies of King Cambyses of Persia. Thus was ushered in Dynasty XXVII. This was followed by four puppet
dynasties, under Persian control, lasting until 332 B.C., when the Nile
land succumbed to Alexander the Great. His successors, the Ptolemies,
held on until 30 B.C., when Egypt became a province of the Roman
Empire. From Menes to Amasis was almost five thousand years, and
the record of Egyptian civilization under her native rulers was highly
creditable. The achievements of this African culture have been well summarized by a contemporary German scholar:
The insurgent Amasis stood at the end of Egypt's history, but at its be
ginning lay the Nile mud, which came from the interior of Africa, spread itself over the annually flooded river valley and proved to be an excellent fertilizer. And even in the Neolithic Age, men were sowing wheat and bar
ley there. These Neolithic children of the Nile were East Hamitic Afri
cans, related to the present day Galla, Somali and Masai in East Africa; the
later Egyptians were their descendants. The language of the Egyptians was an East Hamitic dialect as is spoken today by the natives between the
Upper Nile and the Masai Steppes. Egyptian skeletons, statues and countless pictures of Egyptians in their temples and monuments show the same
racial characteristics as the Nubians and the Nilotic tribes, the brown
skinned hunters of the Steppes and the savannah husbandmen of the Sudan.
Therefore, Egypt was a great kingdom created by Africans. . . . Of Afri
can inspiration are the pyramids, the golden burial chambers, the statues,
plastic arts, temple friezes and other great Egyptian works of art. The
Sphinx is an African monument, the hieroglyphs are an African script and
Ammon, Isis and Osiris are African gods. So great was the achievement of
the Africans in the Nile Valley that all the great men of ancient Europe
journeyed there—the philosophers Thales and Anaximander, the mathema
tician Pythagoras, the statesman Solon and an endless stream of historians and geographers whose works are all based on Herodotus' outstanding de
scription of Egypt, to which the second volume of his history entirely was
devoted. (269, p. 58)



CHAPTER TWELVE
The Evolution of Civilization:
Western Asia
WE now leave Egypt for a while and pay a brief visit to the land of the
Two Rivers. The ancient inhabitants of Mesopotamia are sometimes
called the Chaldeans, but they were latecomers to the area. Preceding
them were the Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians.
The earliest civilization was that of the Sumerians. They are described
in the Assyrio-Babylonian inscriptions as a black-faced people and are
shown on the monuments as beardless and with shaven heads. The
later Semitic Babylonians are depicted on the monuments with beards
and long hair. Around 4000 B.C., the Sumerians had attained a high
level of civilization in the plains of Shinar. They tilled the soil, prac
ticed irrigation, erected cities, reared cattle, and invented the system of
cuneiform writing which they bequeathed to their Semitic successors.
The Sumerians achieved such excellence in the various arts and scien
ces that none of the future cultures of Mesopotamia ever rose to their
level. "Babylonian science," as Dr. Briffault pointed out, "was exactly
as far advanced in the nebulous dawn of Sumerian culture as it was
nearly four thousand years later when the Greeks came to gather up its
crumbs. Not a single aspect or feature of the Babylonian civilization
shows in the course of the thousands of years of its supremacy the
slightest indication of advance or development." (20, p. 49) But we
must say that the Chaldean stargazers made a creditable use of their
Sumerian scientific heritage, for they were very able astronomers.
Shortly before 500 B.C., the astronomer Naburiannu calculated the
length of the solar year with great precision. His result was 365 days, 6
hours, 15 minutes, and 41 seconds. His figures made the year only 26
minutes and 55 seconds too long. Kidinnu, the last great Chaldean as
242



WKSTKRN ASIA 243
tronomer, about 500 B.C. predicted eclipses so accurately that modern
astronomers only reached his level of precision within the last hundred
years. The British Museum houses a Babylonian calendrical tablet,
showing the month as divided into four weeks, each of seven days' du
ration. This was a lunar calendar, with a month of twenty-eight days,
with seven days for each of the four phases of the moon: new moon,
first quarter, full moon, and last quarter. Every seventh day was a Sha
battu (Sabbath), or day of rest. Hence, we can trace our seven-day
week, Sabbath day included, back to the ancient peoples of Mesopota
mia. Attempting to trace the Sumerians back to their origin presents a
problem that has arrested the attention of a number of anthropologists
and archaeologists. Professor Dorsey thought that the original Sume
rians were Elamite immigrants. "If they lived today," he surmised, "we
should probably call them Arabs; but if they lived in Afghanistan, we
should call them Afghans. Perhaps they were prehistoric Mongols."
(71, p. 315) If the Sumerians were a colony of Elamites, as Dorsey sug
gested, then they were not likely to have been prehistoric Mongols.
More likely they were of Ethiopic origin. "The Elamites of Mesopota
mia," according to Johnston, "appear to have been a Negroid people
with kinky hair, and to have transmitted this racial type to the Jews
and Syrians. There is a curliness of the hair together with a Negro eye
and full lips in the portraiture of Assyria, which conveys the idea of an
evident Negro element in Babylonia." (130, p. 27) The opinions of
Johnston are supported by archaeological evidence; for Reginald S.
Poole, of the British Museum staff, compared Assyrian portraits from
the monuments with those of the Babylonians and Elamites and con
cluded: "The Assyrians themselves are shown to have been of a very
pure type of Semites, but in the Babylonias, there is a sign of Kushite
blood. . . . There is one portrait of an Elamite king on a vase found at
Susa; he is painted black and thus belongs tc the Kushite race." (Cited
by A. C. Haddon, in 103, p. 6) Dr. H. R. Hall, of the Department of
Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities of the British Museum, was con
vinced by his own studies that the Sumerians were Dravidian migrants
from the Indus Valley. Dr. Hall's opinions are worthy of careful con
sideration, and extracts from some of his conclusions are given below:
The Sumerian culture springs into our view ready made. . . . We have no knowledge of the time when the Sumerians were savages; when we first
meet with them, in the fourth millennium B.C., they are already a civilized,
metal using people, living in great and populous cities, possessing a compli



244 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
cared system of writing and living under rhe government of firmly estab
lished civil and religious dynasties and hierarchies. . . . The ethnic type of
the Sumerians, so strongly marked in their statues and reliefs, was as
different from those of the races which surrounded them as was their lan
guage from those of the Semites, Aryans, or others; they were decidedly
Indian in type. The face type of the average Indian of today is no doubt
much the same as that of his Dravidian race ancestors thousands of years
ago. . . . And it is to this Dravidian ethnic type of India that the ancient Sumerian bears most resemblance, so far as we can judge from his monu
ments. . . . And it is by no means improbable that the Sumerians were an
Indian race which passed, certainly by land, perhaps also by sea, through
Persia to the Valley of the Two Rivers. It was in the Indian home (perhaps
the Indus Valley), that we suppose for them that their culture developed.
(108, pp. 172-74)
In our opinion, Dr. Hall failed to prove his case. From the evidence
presented, we might just as rightly conclude that the Sumerian culture
preceded that of the Dravidians, or that both cultures stemmed from an
earlier common civilization. About 340 B.C., the Babylonian historian
Berosus wrote a history of his people in Greek. We learn from frag
ments of this work which have survived the ruins of empires that the
founders of the Sumerian culture came from the south in ships and in
troduced the arts of agriculture, reading, writing, metalworking, "and
all things that make life better." A legendary ruler named Oannes and
his seafaring companions brought civilization to Mesopotamia, and
these first Sumerians, according to Berosus, were "black-faced for
eigners." The ^traditions preserved by Berosus seem to ring true; for
though Sumerian civilization was buried under waves of Akkadians,
Amorites, Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites, Arameans, Kassites,
Medes, Persians, and Hellenistic Greeks, the Sumerians managed to
survive; for their descendants still live on, as a dark-skinned group,
among the populations of Hither Asia. Later invaders absorbed the cul
ture brought from the south by the legendary Oannes. Their arts and
crafts, their inventions, their scripts, and much else were absorbed by
their successors in the land between the rivers. Babylonia, Assyria, the
Hittite kingdom, Mitanni, Phoenicia, and Israel built on the founda
tions laid by the Sumerians. In the code of laws framed by King Ham
murabi of Babylonia, we are told: "Anu and Bel called me, Hammurabi
the exalted prince, the worshipper of the gods; to cause justice to pre
vail in the land, to destroy the wicked, to prevent the strong from op
pressing the weak, to go forth like the sun over the black faced race, to
enlighten the land and to further the welfare of the people/' The Su



WESTERN ASIA 245
merian stories of their origins definitely point to Egypt and Ethiopia as
their original homeland. This point of view was well presented by
Gerald Massey in a lecture, "The Hebrew and Other Creations Fundamentally Explained," from which we quote:
According to ancient tradition, the culture of Chaldea was brought to
that country by a Fish Man who rose up in the first year from that part of
the Red or Erythraean Sea, which borders upon Babylonia. The original of
this type can be identified in Ea the fish god, deity of the house of the deep
and divinity of wisdom. Whence came Ea, then, by the Red Sea? Lepsius
says from Egypt—so says Egypt herself. . . . It is at least suggestive to find
that the name and nature of Ea, the oldest Akkadian form of the One God,
may be so fully explained by the Egyptian Ua (later Ea) for the one, the
one alone, isolated as the only one; also the thinker and the captain of the
boat. It should be premised that the Egyptian U preceded the letter or sound of E, hence Ua = Ea. The Egyptian Ua, which passed into Ea, also
appears in the Akkadian Ua for the Supreme One the sole Lord or Chief.
. . . Ea was the deity of the deep, and Ua = Ea is Boat and Captain both.
. . . Ea is the wise god, the thinker and instructor; and Uaua (Egyptian)
means to think, consider, meditate. (165, p. 31)
Massey was certainly on the right track, for from the earliest times
Sumer, Egypt, and Ethiopia seem to have been in touch with each other. Early Sumerian texts refer to Dilmun, Magan, and Meluhha.
Where were these places? Professor W. J. Perry has devoted some
study to this question, and we shall let him speak for himself:
Dilmun was the first settlement that was made by the god Enki, who was
the founder of Sumerian civilization. He was the god of the first Sumerian
city of Eridu, situated on what was then the head of the Persian Gulf. Enki
is said to have come up from the Persian Gulf, and to have taught the Su
merians their civilization. . . . Of late years a considerable amount of dis
cussion has taken place with regard to the localization of Dilmun, Magan and Meluhha, which are always mentioned together, as places noted for
their ships and dates. Magan was famous among the Sumerians as a place whence they got diorite and copper, Meluhha as a place whence they got
gold, Dilmun has been identified with some place or other in the Persian
Gulf, perhaps the Bahrein Islands. ... In a late inscription of the Assyri
ans, it is said that Magan and Meluhha were the archaic names for Ethiopia
and Egypt, ... for this reason, it has been concluded by some scholars that Magan and Meluhha were actually Egypt and the place called by the Egyp
tians the land of Punt. . . . The two countries therefore, can well have
been the Magan and Meluhha of the Sumerians. Mention is also made, in



246 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
early Sumerian inscriptions, of a Magan pig, which certainly was an Egyp
tian pig; and this is another reason for identifying Magan with Egypt. (186, pp. 60-61)
Anthropologists of the evolutionary school deny any cultural con
nection between Egypt and Sumer in the early days of their history,
but their case fails for lack of evidence. On the contrary, we know that
there was a close affinity between the religions of Egypt and Mesopo
tamia. In Egyptian myth, the underworld was named Osiris—in As
syrian, Asar; the goddess Hathor corresponded with Ashtoreth, and Isis
with Istar. Sir Wallis Budge in his fine study The Gods of the Egyptians
has an interesting chapter entitled "The Oldest Company of the Gods
and the Creation." The oldest company of the gods in Egypt consisted
of four gods and four goddesses, and each god was paired with his fe
male counterpart. In the Assyrio-Babylonian Seven Tablets of Creation,
we find a similar company of gods described, being eight in number,
and divided into four pairs. Budge was convinced that the close corres
pondence of the two groups of godly companies was not due to chance.
The Seven Tablets of Creation [he noticed] contain several Assyrianized
forms of ancient Sumerian words, a fact which proves the original traditions
incorporated in the work must be of Sumerian origin, and must have been
formulated in remote antiquity. It is surprising therefore, to find so much
similarity existing between the primeval gods of Sumer and those of Egypt,
especially as the resemblance cannot be the result of borrowing. . . . And
we are therefore driven to the conclusion that both the Sumerians and the early Egyptians derived their primeval gods from some common but exceedingly ancient source. The similarity between the two companies of
gods seems to be too close to be accidental. ... Be this as it may, it is cer
tain that the company of primeval gods, which, as we have seen, was com
mon to the Sumerians and Egyptians, was quite different from the companies of gods of which Osiris and Ra-Tem were the heads in Egypt, and also from those which were formed in Babylonia and Assyria when these
countries were inhabited by Semitic populations. (32, pp. 290-91)
The myths, legends, and traditions of the Sumerians definitely point
to Africa as the original home of the Sumerians. The first Sumerian re
mains were unearthed in the middle of the nineteenth century by
Hincks, Oppert, and Rawlinson. Sir Henry Rawlinson called these
people Kushites. The name Sumerian we owe to Professor Jules Op
pert, a Franco-German Orientalist. Rawlinson anticipated Perry by
tracing the Sumerians back to Ethiopia.



CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The Evolution of Civilization: India
MEN of almost every shade of color are found in the great subconti
nent of India, but the early inhabitants of this region were black. Their
descendants may be observed in central India today. They are distinguished by Ethiopoid features, curly hair, and a dusky complexion. Their ancient forebears were described by Professor Lynn Thorndike
as "short black men with almost Negro noses." (249, p. 227) Dr. Will Durant referred to them as "a dark skinned, broad nosed people whom, without knowing the origin of the word, we call Dravidians." (76, p.
396) The first great civilization of India was established by the Dra
vidians in the Indus Valley. There they built large cities, the principal ones being Mohenjo Daro, Chanhu'Daro, and Harappa. These cities were well constructed. Mohenjo Daro was two square miles in area,
with regularly laid-out main and side streets, lined with attractive twostory brick houses. Bathrooms were a common feature, and they were
fitted out with runaway drains leading to brick sewers laid under the streets. This culture reached its peak about 3000 B.C. These people
had domesticated cattle, sheep, and elephants; cultivated cotton and wheat; built boats and wheeled carts; and became skilled workers of bronze and iron. They even discovered a process for making iron rustproof. Erich Von Daniken recently noted: 'in the courtyard of a tem
ple of Delhi there exists . . . a column made of welded iron parts that has been exposed to weathering for more than 4000 years without showing a trace of rust. In addition, it is unaffected by sulphur or phos
phorus. Here we have an unknown alloy from antiquity staring us in
the face." (54, p. 94) That the Dravidians possessed high skill in the
mining and fabricating of iron and steel implements is a fact not subject
to dispute.
The Megalith builders in India [Perry observed] made one great discov
ery. They found lying about on the surface in great quantities, in Hydera
247



248 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
bad and elsewhere, iron of such a quality that it practically constituted a
natural steel. In fact, it was of this iron that Damascus blades were made.
. . . The craft of iron working was, in time, carried further east, so that we
find the people of the East Indian Archipelago, which may be called Indo
nesia for short, working iron in Borneo, Celebes and elsewhere, they hav
ing, in the case of Celebes, learned the craft from wonderful strangers who
built megalithic monuments, and therefore belonged to the archaic civiliza
tion. (185, p. 108)
The Indus Valley civilization was in a way unique, for these people
seem not to have had priest kings. The largest building in Mohenjo
Daro was not a temple or palace, but a public bath. In Hammerton's
Wonders of the Past, there is an instructive study by S. G. Blaxland
Stubbs, Wonder Cities of Most Ancient India. We have been informed
by Stubbs:
The early Aryan literature of India, the hymns of the Rigveda, which, it
is commonly agreed, date from about 1000 B.C., speak of the people whom
the proud Aryan invaders found in India as black skinned barbarians, or
slaves. But Aryan pride of race has received something of a shock from the
archaeological investigations carried out by Sir John Marshall, and more re
cently by Dr. E. Mackay in the valley of the Indus. Here, ample evidence
has been found of a race whose complex civilization and high culture were
equal, and in some respects superior to those of early Mesopotamia and
Egypt. ("Wonder Cities of Most Ancient India" by S. G. Blaxland Stubbs,
in 111, pp. 659-66)
The Indus civilization is still a puzzle to the archaeologists, for they
have no clue as to its origin. In prehistoric times, primitive village
dwellers lived in the Indus area and points further north. Then sud
denly great cities appeared. By whom were they built? If the builders
were migrants, from whence did they come? As Robert Silverberg has
observed: "A civilization as complex as that of the Indus Valley does
not spring full blown out of nowhere. But that is exactly what appears
to have happened at Mohenjo Daro and Harappa. They are cities built
from scratch." (227, p. 93) Another puzzling feature of this ancient
culture is the system of writing, which seems to have been a picto
graphic script of about two hundred different signs. For many of these
signs (about a hundred) are almost identical with those used by the
mysterious inhabitants of Easter Island, situated two thousand miles
west of Chile in the Pacific Ocean. "All sorts of fantastic theories have
been spawned about this resemblance. Most serious scholars, though,



INDIA 249
regard the coincidence as just that: pure chance. They note that the
Indus script was lost from sight 3500 years ago—at least two thousand
years, possibly three thousand, before the earliest known use of the
Easter Island script. There is no way to explain the resemblance except
as a coincidence." The foregoing quote is the opinion of Robert Silver
berg (227, p. 102). A man who writes so charmingly is hard to disa
gree with, but here we must register dissent; this looks to us like an
other example of the diffusion of culture. Dragging in chance, or coin
cidence, in this case, begs the question. For there is plenty of evidence
that cultural diffusion was just as prevalent in the ancient world as it is
in our day. An interesting discussion of this fact has been presented by Eugen Georg:
For ages, the bond between Africa and the Far East (India, China, and
the Malayan district) has been amazingly close. A Suaheli colony flourishes on the west coast of India, and Madagascar is still the home of the Hova or Malays who immigrated more than a thousand years ago from Sumatra.
. . . Starting with Madagascar, the Oriental influence extends deep into
the heart of Africa. Some tribes in the western Sudan speak a dialect which shows undeniable relationship with the Chinese. The xylophones of inner
Africa are tuned to the same scales and absolute tones as are the Indo-Chi
nese xylophone. The prows of boats are painted black, white, red or green
by Negroes of Kamerun; and in details of form, color and style, they imi
tate the Knjallans of the Dyak of Borneo, whose black, white and red are an
original artistic element of mankind in the Pacific from the South Seas to Northwestern America. The colors assume mythical and magic values:
black is the color of night, fear and death; red that of blood and youth;
white that of light, the sun, life and joy. Astounding similarities, physical
and anthropological, are to be noted between certain tribes in West Africa and Melanesia. Both use bows of the same type, strung with the same mate
rial; both build rectangular huts with a gable roof. Almost identical ceremo
nies are employed in the initiations into secret fetichistic male societies.
Likewise the same masks, the same textiles made from bark, the same slit drums are found on the coast of Guinea and in Kamerun as in New Guinea, the Admiralty Islands and the New Hebrides. The Spaniard de
Rete early recognized such similarities; it was on account of them that he
called an island which he had discovered near Australia, New Guinea. (96,
pp. 100-1)



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
The Evolution of Civilization:
Crete and Phoenicia
THE ancient civilization of Crete is frequently referred to as the Mi
noan culture, being named after King Minos, an early legendary ruler.
The ancestors of the Cretans were natives of Africa, a branch of the
western Ethiopians, who dwelt in the grasslands of North Africa before
that area dried up and became a great desert. As the Saharan sands en
croached on their homeland, they took to the sea and, in Crete and
neighboring islands, set up a maritime culture. The archaeological
discoveries of Sir Arthur Evans have revealed to us the knowledge that
cultural influences from beyond the Mediterranean Sea were reaching
Crete before the rise of the Egyptian dynasties. By 1700 B.C. this civi
lization had reached its zenith; and from their capital at Knossus the
Sea Kings of Crete ruled over a region which had become the culture
nucleus of the eastern Mediterranean. The seat of these kings was the
Broad Palace of Minos, in Knossus. It was a huge structure, five stories
high, and spread out over an area of four acres. On the walls of its nu
merous rooms were beautiful frescoes and mosaics of high artistic
merit. In this palace were bathrooms with terra cotta bathtubs, fitted
with drains quite modern in construction. They were made of faucet
jointed pipes superior to anything known to the later Romans, and
were not equaled in modern times until the mid-nineteenth century.
The Palace of Minos contained a throne room, a chapel, storerooms,
living quarters, and recreational halls. There were no walls around the
city, so the island evidently enjoyed security from outside interference.
Throughout Crete were attractive and comfortable homes, well-con
structed ports, and fine paved roads. The Minoan mariners were domi
nant in the Aegean Sea, and carried on a lively trade with Egypt,
250



CRETE AND PHOENICIA 251
Sicily, and southern Italy. The people had ample leisure time, so they
went in for music, dancing, theatricals, athletics, and other forms of en
tertainment. The social organization was egalitarian, with women
enjoying the same rights and privileges as men. There was no powerful
sacerdotal caste; the gods were worshiped in caves or on hilltops or at
domestic shrines, but there were no temples. Around 1400 B.C. this
splendid culture was laid in ruins by an invasion of semi-barbarous
Greeks from the north; and upon the ruins of the Cretan culture the
Greeks in later days built their civilization. These Greeks were the
first civilized white folks.
The great mariners and merchants of the ancient world were the
Phoenicians, who adopted much of the culture of ancient Egypt, and
were instrumental in diffusing its elements to other nations. We first
hear of these people as dwelling on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and
have been told that they later colonized the land of Canaan, at the east
ern end of the Mediterranean. Hence they called themselves Canaan
ites. These ancient mariners manufactured a famous dye called royal
purple, which the Greeks named Phoenix. As a result, the makers of the
precious dye were nicknamed Phoenikes, or Phoenicians. Herodotus,
in Book VII, Chapter LXXXIX, of his famous History, stated: "The
Phoenicians, as they themselves say, anciently dwelt on the Erythraean
Sea (Indian Ocean); and having crossed over from thence, they settled
on the sea coast of Syria/' This opinion has been questioned by certain
modern scholars, but it has not been disproven. Professor George
Rawlinson, in an essay "On the Ethnic Affinities of the Nations of
Western Asia," expressed the opinion that: "The primeval Canaanites,
indeed, were of the race of Ham (i.e., they were Kushites), and no
doubt originally spoke a dialect closely akin to the Egyptian." (Cited
by John D. Baldwin in 7, p. 132) The Phoenicians carried on their in
dustrial and commercial operations from the cities of Aradus, By bios,
Sidon, and Tyre, situated at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea.
The port of Byblos was exporting timber to Egypt as far back as the
days of Dynasty III, when forty boats laden with cedars of Lebanon
sailed up the Nile. A stone tablet of the reign of the Pharaoh Snefru
reads: "We brought 40 ships laden with cedar trunks. We built ships
ofcedarwood. . . . We made the doors of the king's palace of cedar
wood." (Cited by Robert Silverberg in 227, p. 112) In later days,
when life in Canaan became hazardous, the Phoenicians expanded their
activities and established many colonies, the most important being Car



252 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
rhage, Urica, and Bizerre in North Africa, and Gadcs (Cadiz) in Spain
and Palermo in Sicily.
The city stare of Carthage, originally a colony of Tyre, was estab
lished on the North African coast before 800 B.C. This city, a great
metropolis of the ancient world, was destroyed by the Romans after the
final defeat of the Carthaginians, at the end of the Punic Wars. The
Phoenicians were great merchants and mariners. Not being warlike,
they neglected military affairs; and this finally led to their undoing.
For, as Professor Charles Seignobos pointed out:
To protect her colonies from the natives, to hold her subjects in check
who were always ready to revolt, a strong army was necessary. But the life
of a Carthaginian was too valuable to risk it without necessity. Carthage
preferred to pay mercenary soldiers, recruiting them among the barbarians
of her empire and among the adventurers of all countries. Her army was a
bizarre aggregation in which all languages were spoken, all religions prac
ticed and in which every soldier wore different arms and costume. There
were seen Numidians clothed in lion skins which served them as couch,
mounted bareback on small fleet horses, and drawing the bow with horse at
full gallop; Libyans with black skins armed with pikes; Iberians from Spain
in white garments adorned with red, armed with a long pointed sword;
Gauls, naked to the girdle, bearing enormous shields and a rounded sword
which they held in both hands; natives of the Balearic Islands, trained from
infancy to sling with stones or balls of lead. (222, pp. 78-79)
After losing Sicily to the Romans in 242 B.C., the Carthaginians
were faced with a rebellion of their Libyan vassals; and, to forestall
Roman aid to the rebels, they were forced to surrender the island of
Sardinia to the Romans. The Libyans were subdued by Carthaginian
arms, under the generalship of Hamilcar Barca in 238 B.C. Hamilcar
cherished a dream of restoring the ancient glories of Carthage, and of
recapturing Sicily and Sardinia; so the Second Punic War was waged
in Europe and Africa with Hannibal (a son of Hamilcar) leading the
Carthaginians, and Cornelius Scipio heading the Roman forces. A se
ries of blunders by Hannibal brought about the downfall of the Cartha
ginians at the battle of Zama, in 202 B.C. The Roman peace terms
were harsh; for Carthage was compelled to pay, over a period of fifty
years, an indemnity of 10,000 talents of silver, or about $20,000,000 in
modern currency. All the ships of war and elephants of Carthage were
confiscated by the Romans; and the establishment of new colonies or
involvement in foreign wars was forbidden, unless approved by Rome.



CRETE AND PHOENICIA 253
The great African city stare, despite all these setbacks, made a good re
covery and might have survived; but in the year 1 50 B.C., the armies of
King iMassanissa, of Numidia, an African ally of Rome, invaded Car
thaginian territory. The Carthaginians counterattacked in self-defense, and this led to the Third Punic War. The Romans, led by the evil
minded Roman Senator Cato, who plotted to crush Carthage under
any pretext, declared war on Carthage. This war, begun by Rome in
149 B.C. under the trumped-up claim that an old treaty had been vio
lated, raged for three years. In 146 B.C., the city of Carthage was cap
tured by the Romans and was completely destroyed by fire. This wan
ton destruction of the great African city by the Romans must be
regarded as one of the great crimes of history. For the Carthaginians
and their Phoenician forebears were culturally and intellectually supe
rior to the Romans. "They (the Romans) burned the great city of Car
thage," Professor Hapgood has stated, "their ancient enemy and their
incalculable superior in everything relating to science. The library of
Carthage is said to have contained about 500,000 volumes, and these,
no doubt, dealt with the history and the sciences of Phoenicia as a
whole." (112, p. 196)
The ships of the Phoenicians traded with ports on the shores of the
Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Atlantic
Ocean. The Phoenician seafarers and traders operated tin mines in
Cornwall and swapped goods with the ancient Britons; their ships cir
cumnavigated Africa and crossed the Atlantic to America. The Phoe
nicians have been credited with the invention of the alphabet, but this
claim is not valid; for it has been shown by the researches of the Egyp
tologist Prisse d'Avennes that the alphabet was an Egyptian invention.
"It is sufficiently proved," as noted by a modern authority, "by the pa
pyrus in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, actually the oldest book in
the world. It consists of eighteen pages written in black ink with a bold
round character, the prototype of the letters copied by the Greeks from
the Phoenicians and transmitted through the Latins to us." (80, p. 15)
In other words, the Phoenicians adopted the Egyptian alphabet, sim
plified it, and then diffused it among other nations.

The Evolution of Civilization:
Greece and Rome
THE Greeks are noted for their contributions to philosophy, but they
knew nothing of that study before coming under the influence of the
Egyptians. Aristotle conceded that his people obtained their first
knowledge of astronomy and mathematics from Egypt; and, according
to Diodorus Siculus, Egyptian priests possessed souvenirs of the visits of
Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato, and Eudoxus to their country. In
Egypt, Democritus studied astronomy; Pythagoras learned geometry,
the theory of numbers, and transmigration; and it was there that Solon,
Plato, and Lycurgus got their knowledge of law. Eudoxus, about 370
B.C., learned from the Egyptian astronomers the conception of the ce
lestial sphere. He carried it back to Greece and outlined upon it the ce
lestial equator; the ecliptic, and the most important constellations.
Thales of Miletus, of mixed Greek and Phoenician ancestry, was born
in the first half of the sixth century B.C., and he was the founder of
Greek science and philosophy. He was a merchant, traveler, philoso
pher, mathematician, astronomer, and an engineer. As a young man, he
was a student in Egypt, but he returned to Miletus in his old age.
The role of Egypt in civilizing the Greeks has been vividly depicted
by the English historian, Winwood Reade:
Egypt from the earliest times had been rhe university of Greece. It had
been visited, according to tradition, by Orpheus and Homer. . . . And
now every intellectual Greek made the voyage to that country; it was re
garded as a part of education, as a pilgrimage to the cradle land of their
mythology. To us, Egypt is a land of surpassing interest, but nevertheless,
merely a charnel house, a museum, a valley of ruins and dry bones. The
Greeks saw it alive. . . . They wandered in the mazes of the Labyrinth;
254



GREECE AND ROME 255
they gazed on the mighty Sphinx couched on the yellow sands with a tem
ple between its paws, they entered the great hall of Karnak, filled with col
umns like a forest and paved with acres of solid stone. . . . There are some
who ascribe the whole civilization of Greece and the rapid growth of Greek
literature to the free trade which existed between the two lands. Greece
imported all its paper from Egypt, and without paper, there would have
been few books. (203, pp. 60-61)
In material culture, the Greeks were inferior to the Orientals and
even to the Romans, and they showed progress in applied science only
in the Hellenistic era of Alexandria, which was more Oriental than
Hellenic. The great gifts of the Greeks were in the fields of free
thought, intellectual tolerance, and urbanity. They excelled in logic,
metaphysics, and theoretical science, but also made valuable contribu
tions to education, art, literature, and politics.
A blend of Greek and Oriental elements produced the Hellenistic
culture of Alexandria. Shortly before his death, Alexander the Great
decided to build a new city on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt.
When Alexander's domains were divided up, one of his generals,
Ptolemy, got Egypt as his share and then undertook the building of the
proposed city, which was named Alexandria. The new city was built
on a strip of land five or six miles long, and about two miles wide, be
tween the Mediterranean Sea and Lake Mareotis. In the harbor of
Alexandria, was the island of Pharos, on which was erected a splendid
lighthouse. It was built of marble and its pinnacle reached four hundred
feet into the air. From the summit shone a light, visible thirty miles out
at sea. This grand structure cost close to $1,000,000, which in those
days was a lot of money. The walls of Alexandria were about fifteen
miles in circumference, and underground cisterns were established ca
pable of storing an emergency fresh-water supply sufficient to sustain
the entire population for one year. The layout of the city was quite
modern, with streets running north-south and east-west, and crossing
each other at right angles. Canobic Street traversed the metropolis
from one end to another in an east-west direction of five or six miles. It
was over a hundred feet in width and was lined on both sides by a mar
ble colonnade. Another boulevard equally wide and stately ran in the
north-south direction. These avenues were lined with noble palms, and
were illuminated with lamps at night. The palaces, mansions, and pub
lic buildings were faced with white marble and polished granite. In
daytime, the glare of the sun was moderated by the use of veils and



256 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
curtains of green silk, which were everywhere in evidence. The mag
nificent tomb of Alexander the Great was located at the intersection of
the two main boulevards of the city. This mausoleum, which contained
the mummified remains of the deceased monarch, was surrounded by
gardens, fountains, and obelisks. The glory of Alexandria was the Mu
seum, commenced by Ptolemy Soter and completed by his son
Ptolemy Philadelphus. The outstanding feature of the Alexandrian
Museum, located in the Bruchion, the aristocratic quarter of the city
and adjoining the Royal Palace, was the Philadelphian Library. Its or
nate apartments were adorned with the finest statues and pictures of
the age, and housed about 400,000 volumes. Later, another library was
established in the Serapion (The Temple of Serapis), and this collec
tion grew to about 300,000 volumes. In the establishment of the Mu
seum (actually a university) and its famous libraries, Ptolemy Soter had
in mind three objectives: (1) The preservation of extant knowledge,
(2) The increase of such knowledge, (3) The diffusion of knowledge.
The first Ptolemy abdicated his throne in favor of his son Ptolemy II
(Philadelphus) in 285 B.C. During the reign of this second Ptolemy
(285-247 B.C.), Alexandria entered its Golden Age. The coronation
of Ptolemy Philadelphus was attended with great pomp and ceremony,
as the following account shows:
From morn to dusk of a mild November day, a stupendous procession
paraded broad, marble lined avenues. ... A large gold and ivory statue of
Dionysus rode in a chariot at the head of a vintage pageant which included
24 chariots containing gaily dressed Hindu ladies and drawn by elephants
and 80 chariots drawn by Asiatic antelopes, goats and wild asses. . . .
Statues of gods and kings rode in chariots of ivory and gold. In the royal box were a dozen of the Greek world's most famous scholars and poets; and
doubtless, they sat at the close in the specially built banquet hall, with mar
ble columns shaped like palms, the choicest paintings in the world, hangings
of Egyptian scarlet and Phoenician purple, and large gold vessels studded
with diamonds and rubies. The coronation cost, it is said, 600,000 pounds; and the gold crowns presented to the young king and queen by the cities of
the world were worth more than that in value. ( 1 50, pp. 66-67)
Ptolemy II appointed Callimachus to the post of Chief Librarian;
and one of his projects was a collection of literature embracing the sa
cred books of the Ethiopians, Elamites, Persians, Indians, Babylonians,
Assyrians, Phoenicians, Syrians, and Greeks. The chief librarian was
commissioned by royal authority to purchase whatever books he could



GREECE AND ROME 257
ar the expense of the government. All books brought into Egypt by
foreigners were taken to the library, where correct copies were made
by a corps of transcribers. A transcript was returned to the owner, and
the original was placed in the library. Owners of valuable books were
well compensated on the sale of such works. Ptolemy Euergetes bought
from a citizen of Athens certain works of Sophocles, Euripides, and
Aeschylus; and to the owner he returned transcripts of the books plus
an indemnity of about $15,000. The museum is sometimes called the
University of Alexandria, for it contained faculties of mathematics, as
tronomy, medicine, and literature. Connected with the museum were
botanical and geological gardens, an astronomical observatory, a chemi
cal laboratory and an anatomical dissection room. The scientists and
scholars of the establishment were especially celebrated in the fields of
mathematics, astronomy, and geography. One of the shining lights of
Alexandrian erudition was the mathematician Euclid, whose Elements
of Geometry was used as a textbook in the schools of the world for more
than two thousand years. The contemporary mathematician, Sir
Thomas Heath, has described Euclid's Elements as: "The greatest text
book of elementary mathematics that there has ever been or is likely to
be, a book which, ever since it was written twenty-two centuries ago,
has been read and appealed to as authoritative by mathematicians great
and small from Archimedes and Apollonius of Perga onwards." Ptol
emy Soter asked Euclid to simplify the study of geometry so that he
could learn it without too much mental effort. To this request, Euclid
replied, "In geometry there is no special path for kings." Another
mathematician of the Alexandrian school was Apollonius, who wrote
treatises on the conic sections. Also on the staff of the museum was Ar
chimedes, who was a mathematician, physicist, and an engineer. Era
tosthenesr astronomer and geographer, measured the curvature of the
earth for a distance of 480 miles from Alexandria to Syene, and then
calculated from the aforesaid data the circumference of the earth,
which he found roughly to be 24,000 miles. Other great astronomers of
Alexandria were Claudius Ptolemy, Hipparchus, and Sosigenes. The
last named revised the calendar at the behest of Julius Caesar, and
hence was responsible for the Julian version of the calendar. The mu
seum maintained a group of engineers and inventors. Ctesibius inven
ted a single-cylinder fire engine, and his pupil, Hero, improved the
same by giving it two cylinders. This same Hero invented a steam en
gine, which was a forerunner of 'the modern steam turbine. Water



258 MAN, COD, AND CIVILIZATION
clocks constructed by Apollonius and Cresibius measured time in the
Temple of Serapis. As a center of scientific research, the museum
flourished for about a hundred years, then went into a decline; whereas
the library was destroyed by fire in 48 B.C. when a Roman army led
by Julius Caesar captured Alexandria. The library was partly restored
by the Romans by importing books from foreign libraries, especially
that of King Eumenes of Pergamus. This second Alexandrian library,
which was added to the collection in the Serapion, was destroyed by a
mob of fanatical Christian monks in 389 A.C. The story of the de
struction of the library at Alexandria by Arab invaders in the seventh
century has no foundation in fact, since there was then no library for
them to loot. When Alexandria's period of progress had run its course,
the Romans took over and became the new custodians of civilization.
In a way, this was unfortunate, for the Romans lacked the intellectual
receptivity and mental acumen of the Greeks.
A good example of the Greek outlook on the world at its best was
noted by Win wood Reade, who pointed out:
The Egyptians laughed in the faces of the Greeks, and called them chil
dren when they talked of their gods of yesterday, and so well did their pu
pils profit by their lesson that they soon laughed at the Egyptians for believ
ing in the gods at all. Xenophanes declaimed against the Egyptian myth of
an earth-walking, dying, resuscitated god. He said that if Osiris was a man,
they should not worship him, and that if he was a god they need not lament
his sufferings. This remarkable man was the Voltaire of Greece; there had
been free thinkers before his time, but they had reserved their opinions for
their disciples. (203, pp. 78-79)
The Greeks had distinguished themselves in the realms of abstract
thought and pure science. In these endeavors, the duller- witted Romans were no match for the Greeks.
The Romans did make a valuable contribution to civilization, how
ever, in the domains of the industrial arts and the applied sciences, nor
should we overlook the imposing edifice of Roman law. The main de
fects of Roman civilization were slavery, militarism, and a bad fiscal
system. The Romans are not as bad as they have been pictured by their
critics. They had virtues as well as vices, and their good points should
not be overlooked. The free citizens of Rome in the imperial age were
probably better off than some free workingmen in the modern world.
Rome had slums, we know, but it also had the Forum, a finer civic cen
ter than that of any modern city of the Western world. The Roman



GREECE AND ROME 259
proletariat received a free supply of corn, and sometimes were given
free pork. They were also in receipt of a free and excellent water sup
ply, free schooling, and free medical service. Free entertainments were
available to the multitude in the Circus and the Amphitheater. For a
modest fee, the Roman citizen could patronize the public baths—huge
marble palaces with pools of hot and cold water, libraries, gymnasia,
and ornate halls. The Emperor Diocletian had a law passed guaranteeing the Roman worker a minimum wage. The Roman laborer
worked about 1 70 days per year. On the other 195 days, believe or not,
he enjoyed his holidays. At about 3:00 p.m. in imperial Rome, bells
rang, and the laborers ceased work for the day. "From this height of
freedom and enjoyment," McCabe declared, "the workers of the
Roman world were within less than a century of the establishment of
Christianity to be cast down to a level of sordid poverty, heavy toil, and
virtual slavery." (156, p. 17)
There is a considerable literature on the fall of Rome in which
theories are propounded attempting to explain the decline and fall of
that ancient empire. Most of these books are quite worthless; they spin
hypotheses, but explain nothing. Professor J. B. Bury, a leading mod
ern authority on Roman history, could find no good reason why Rome
fell, so he concluded that it was just a case of bad luck on the part of the
Romans. An American scholar, Edward Lucas White, wrote a book
with the title Why Rome Fell, and we think the work should be better
known than it is. In the introduction to his study on the fall of Rome,
White wrote:
This book is an attempt to answer the question: "Why did the Roman Empire, the worship of the Olympian Pantheon and the Greco-Roman civ
ilization and culture perish together?"
Its thesis is that, while there were many and potent negative, passive,
minor and contributory causes totally unconnected with Christianity,
Christianity, throughout its rise, growth, diffusion and success, as it was
manifestly the cause of the extinction of the worship of the Olympian Pan
theon, just as truly was the positive, active, major and paramount cause of
the ruin of the Roman Empire and of the annihilation of the Greco-Roman
culture and civilization. (271, p. ix)
For the details of the decline and fall of Rome, the reader is referred
to the considerable literature on the subject. Edward Gibbon's History
of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is a well-known classic.
White's book is not as difficult to read as Gibbon's, and we recom



260 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
mend it to the reader if he has any interest in the Roman civilization.
Since Why Rome Fell is out of print and many readers may not be able
to find a copy of it even in a library, we give below extracts from that
work, in which the author shows the devastating effects of a great pesti
lence that swept over the Roman Empire in the second century of the
Christian Era:
The Great Pestilence of 166 was, in fact, the real death blow to Rome's
greatness and from it dates the decline of Roman power. It broke the tradi
tion of civilization and culture which had grown from its small beginnings
among the primitive Greeks and Etruscans more than two thousand years
before. ... Up to the year of the Great Pestilence, that civilization had
prospered, had produced a long series of generals, inventors, architects,
sculptors, painters, musicians, poets, authors and orators. Everywhere, men
had shown self confidence, capacity, originality, power and competence
and had achieved success for two thousand years.
The Great Pestilence of A.D. 166 so depleted the population of the Roman Empire that Rome never again advanced its boundaries.
. . . All classes of the people suffered, but most of all, the rich, the well
to-do, the cultured and educated classes of the towns and cities. And the
main point of difference between the Great Pestilence and the others which
had preceded it was the universality of its incidence. For two thousand
years, pestilences had occurred at intervals, but previously not everywhere
at once. If one country suffered, others did not; if half the Mediterranean
world, even, was devastated, the other half escaped. From immune regions, competence and capacity flowed into the ruined
areas and civilization was restored there. But the Great Pestilence left no
district unscathed. In six months, it killed off all the brains and skill, all the
culture and ingenuity in the Empire. There were so few capable men left in
any line of activity that the next generation grew up practically untaught.
The tradition of two thousand years was broken. In all the Mediterranean
world, until centuries later, descendants of the savage invaders developed
their new civilization on the ruins of the old, no man ever again made a
great speech, wrote a great book or play or poem, painted a good picture,
carved a good statue, or contrived a good campaign or battle. The brains of
the Roman world died that year; the originality of the whole nation was
killed at once; the tradition broke off.
What the pestilence was, whether Asiatic cholera, typhus or what else
does not matter. The fact of its virulence is beyond question. It ravaged the Empire from Nisibis in Upper Mesopotamia to the west coast of Wales, from the Rhine and Danube to the cataracts of the Nile. Every farm, ham
let and village suffered; in not one town did more than half the inhabitants
remain alive. Few cities escaped with so much as a third of their population



GREECE AND ROME 261
surviving. Famine accompanied the pestilence in all the western portions of the Roman world, and from famine perished many whom the plague had
spared. (271, pp. 292-93)
The barbarians began to overrun the western Roman Empire in the
early part of rhe fifth century, and by the end of that century Roman
civilization was in ruins. Europe then entered upon the long night of
the Dark Ages, which lasted for five hundred years (500-1 100 A.C.).
The barbarians have been blamed for the collapse of Roman culture,
but they cannot be held entirely responsible for the debacle. "The
Dark Ages," as Professor Thompson truly said, "were at least as much
due to the corruption of the Church as to the decay of Roman civiliza
tion or the barbarian invasions." (247, p. 74) The story of the Dark
Ages in Europe presents a chronicle of horrors almost without a parallel
in human history; and the saddest part of it is the story of the conver
sion of Europe to Christianity. "Could the full history of the conversion
of Europe to Christianity be written," said Dr. Briffault, "it would
present a tale of horror more appalling than that of the Christianization
of Spain by the Inquisition. The Christian religion has been imposed
upon the people of Europe in much the same manner as was imposed
on Mexico and Peru, in the course of whose conversion Las Casas esti
mates twelve million people perished, butchered, burnt alive and tor
tured." (20, p. 117)
The Church not only perpetuated slavery, but created it where it
had never existed under Roman Law. Bishop Ratherius of Verona, in
the tenth century, went so far as to say: "God has mercifully destined
those to slavery for whom He saw that freedom was not fitting." In the
treatment of slaves, the clergy were as brutal as lay masters. There are
cases on record showing that churchmen mutilated or starved their
slaves to death. Civilization was finally restored in Europe, but it was
not from any relics of Greco-Roman culture, buried amidst the ruins,
nor from the degenerate empire of Byzantium. The first light to pene
trate the long night of Europe's Dark Ages and to herald the dawn of a new day was from Moorish Spain. As McCabe has so well put it:
None of our modern sophistry redeems the squalor of Europe from the
fifth to the eleventh century. And it was again the dark skinned men of the
south who restored civilization. By the year 1000, Europe was reduced to a
condition which, if we were not Europeans, we should frankly call barba
rism, yet at that time, the Arabs had a splendid civilization in Spain, Sicily,
Syria, Egypt and Persia, and it linked on to those of India and China. We



262 MAN, COD, AND CIVILIZATION
write manuals of the history of Europe, or of the Middle Ages, and we
confine ourselves to a small squalid area (Russia and Prussia were not yet
civilized and Spain was Moorish), and ignore the brilliant civilization that
ran from Portugal to the China Sea. ( 1 54, p. 298)



CHAPTER SIXTEEN
The Evolution of Civilization:
The Arab-Moorish Culture
THE story of the medieval Arab-Moorish culture begins with the birth
of Mohammed in 571 C.E. (Christian Era); and it has been claimed by
his followers that his birth was heralded by a spectacular display of mir
acles. When he was about thirty years old, while engaged in religious
meditation in a cave on Mount Hara, it is said that the angel Gabriel
appeared to him, proclaiming him as Mohammed, the Prophet of God.
In Mecca, the new prophet was not popular. In fact, he was forced to
flee to Medina; and at that place, he got his start in the year 622. This
year, known as the Hejira (flight), marks the beginning of the Moham
medan Era. The doctrine of the Arabian prophet proved to be widely
popular; for the Arabian peninsula had been recently devastated by a
prolonged drought, and the restless tribes were quite ready to listen to
the voice of a new messiah. The essence of the Islam doctrine is very
simple: "There is no god but God (Allah), and Mohammed is the
prophet of God."
This very simplicity was an asset. Islam appealed to all classes of so
ciety. The doctrines of equality and brotherhood were approved by the
oppressed, the doctrine of conquest was hailed by the tribes of the
desert lands, city dwellers were pleased by Mohammed's encourage
ment of commerce, and the superstitious were delighted by ceremony
and ritualism. Large numbers of Jews and Christians were converted to
Islam, because both Moses and Jesus were recognized as prophets of
God. Mohammed recognized no opposition and boldly challenged all
dissenters, proclaiming: "I, the last of the prophets, am sent with the
sword. Let those who promulgate my faith enter into no argument or
discussion, but slay all who refuse obedience to the law. Whoever
263



264 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
fights for the true faith, whether he fall or conquer, will assuredly re
ceive a glorious reward." The head officer of the Islamic religion was
called the caliph, 2 word meaning Successor or Representative of Mo
hammed. On the death of the Prophet of Islam, his father-in-law, Abu
Beker, was elected as the first caliph. This caused dissension among the
faithful, for many held that the office should have gone to Mohammed's
brother-in-law, Ali. The partisans of Abu Beker claimed that the cal
iphate should be elective, whereas the advocates of Ali argued for suc
cession by heredity. The first group, the Sunnites, became dominant in
Arabia, Africa, and Turkey and Turkestan; whereas the second sect,
the Shiites, prevailed in India and Persia. But despite internal strife, the
successors of Mohammed successfully pursued a vigorous policy of
conquest. Six years after the death of the prophet, Asia Minor and
Mesopotamia had succumbed to the Islamic armies, and the conquest of
Persia and India soon followed. A century later, the Moslem dominions
stretched from Spain through North Africa, across Asia to China. The
first great dynasty of caliphs in the East were the Ommayads, the de
scendants of Omar, known as the St. Paul of Islam. This line of rulers
was followed by the Abbasids, descendants of Mohammed's uncle,
Abbas. Egypt became the seat of the Fatimite caliphate, and the holders
of the office were descendants of Mohammed's daughter, Fatima. The
Caliph Almansor (753-75) transferred the seat of the Eastern Caliph
ate from Damascus to the new city of Bagdad (founded in the year
750), and proceeded to transform the new capital into a great metropo
lis. Here he promoted the study of the sciences, especially astronomy,
and founded schools of law and medicine. His grandson, Harun-Al
Rashid, Caliph of Bagdad (786-809) of Arabian Nights fame, con
tinued this policy by ordering that a school should be attached to every
mosque in his realm.
The Golden Age of Bagdad was the caliphate of Al Mamun (813
32). At its zenith, the Bagdad caliphate extended from the Oxus River
to Tripoli and from the Arabian Desert to the Caucasus Mountains. Sir
Richard Burton, in his translation of the Arabian Nights, gave the fol
lowing fine description of Bagdad in its day of splendor:
Bagdad was the inheritor of the glory of Babylon, Seleucia, and Ctesi
phon. In the midst of the richest and most thickly peopled country of the Abbasid Empire, well watered by the Tigris and Euphrates and the count
less canals springing from them, surrounded by gardens, where the natural
advantages of the climate were heightened by every device that art could



THE ARAB-MOORISH CULTURE 265
suggest, closely connected with the outer world both by land and sea,
Bagdad may well have seemed an earthly paradise. ... A city within a city
inhabited by thousands of officials, the Caliph's palace spread its vast courts
on the west bank with the great mosque, surrounded by the quarters of all
the many trades which fed on the luxury of the court. On the east bank of
the Tigris was the fashionable quarter. . . . where the great family of the
Barmecides had their houses and gardens. Countless minarets shot up their
slender stems like tall rushes into the clear sky. (35, Vol. X, p. 167)
Even with Europe, there was a considerable Saracenic commerce.
Moslems and Russians traded goods at Astrakhan, Kiev, Sari, and the
Black Sea ports. The Russians sold the Saracens slaves, furs, hemp,
cordage, and lumber, and bought fruits, spices, perfumes, and other
luxuries from them. A Moslem traveler visited Germany during the
reign of Otto the Great (936-73) and saw spices and silks from eastern
lands on sale in the city of Mainz. The extent and volume of this com
merce have been revealed to us by the numerous coins containing Ara
bic inscriptions which have been found widely scattered in eastern,
northern, and central Europe. All told, more than thirteen thousand
coins bearing the stamp of Saracenic sovereigns have been discovered
in these areas.
The reader of this discourse has probably heard of the invasion of
Spain by the Moors of North Africa in the seventh century and of how
they ruled over the Iberian peninsula for about eight hundred years.
This phase of the history of civilization has been slighted by the writers
of textbooks on so-called world history, so we must briefly treat of it.
Following the destruction of the city of Carthage in 146 B.C., the
Romans established a group of five provinces in North Africa which
were known collectively as Africa Romana. The ancient Libyan inhab
itants of this territory became amalgamated with Phoenician, Greek,
and Roman immigrants, and the Romans called these North Africans
Barbari (barbarians), from whence we get the name Berber, so in me
dieval and modern times, these people have been called Berbers. The
Romans labeled these Africans barbarians, not because of any cultural
inferiority, but only because they possessed certain mores which
differed from those of the Romans. The Libyans and their Berber kins
men had a matriarchal type of social organization which was common
to all African societies, but which seemed somewhat odd to the Romans
of Europe.
In the first century B.C., Julius Caesar decided to build a new Car



266 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
thage on the site of the old city but, due to his untimely death, the plan
was actually carried out by Augustus Caesar. An interesting account of
this event has been given by Professor J. C. de Graft-Johnson, of the
University of Ghana, which we are pleased to quote:
Carthage was rebuilt in the finest Roman architectural style. The build
ers worked under military discipline and soon the temples, palaces, baths,
theaters, high houses and market places sprang up on the old sites. A new
Forum was erected, the villas and lovely gardens of the Carthaginian sub
urb Megara reappeared. . . . Utica and Carthage were joined by a splendid
road in the true Roman style and blockhouses were built at intervals along
the route in order to protect the caravans against robbers. Other forts and
cities soon made their appearance and with the rebuilding of Carthage, the
prosperity of North Africa increased tremendously. The Carthage which
the Romans had destroyed was to be supplied with fresh, clear water con
veyed by a specially constructed aqueduct which brought the water from
ninety miles away. Julius and Augustus Caesar had in part atoned for the
sins of the past. (59, pp. 27-29)
In the last days of the Western Roman Empire, Spain was occupied
by the Vandals, where their tenure was insecure, since they were
being menaced by an incursion of the Visigoths. The Vandals, through
the good offices of Count Boniface, a Roman legate in North Africa,
were able to migrate to Africa Romana. The Vandals established a tyr
anny in that region that was destructive in the highest degree. We
learn from Professor de Graft -Johnson: "They found Africa flourish
ing and they ieft it desolate, with its great buildings thrown down, its
people reduced to slavery and the Church of Africa, so important in
those early days of Christianity, practically non-existent." (59, p. 56)
The Vandal despotism in Africa was ended in the year 533 when the Emperor Justinian of the Byzantine Empire sent an army under Gen
eral Belisarius to undertake the reconquest of Africa Romana. The Vandals were overcome, and North Africa, for nearly a hundred years
afterward, was under Byzantine rule. A contemporary writer, the
monk Salvian, has left us an interesting description of Carthage under
Byzantine sway:
Where are there more abundant treasures than with the Africans?
Where can we find more prosperous commerce shops better stocked? . . . Carthage, formerly the rival of Rome as regards power and warlike quality,
was she not afterward her rival in splendor, and in imposing majesty? Car
thage, the Rome of Africa, held in her bosom all the treasuries of the state;



THE ARAB-MOORISH CULTURE 267
here was the seat of government and all the institutes of the State; here
were schools for the liberal arts, audiences for philosophers, chairs for pro
fessors of all languages and for every branch of law. (Cited by J. C. de
Graft-Johnson in 59, p. 57)
The first incursion of the forces of Islam into Africa was in 640,
when Amru the Conqueror led his army into Egypt. The Saracen con
quest was aided by the Christians of Alexandria, who were enemies of
the Byzantine tyrant. These heretical Christians paid tribute to the ca
liph, repaired roads and bridges, and supplied provisions to the invading
hosts. After a siege of fourteen months, Alexandria capitulated to
Amru in the year 642. In a dispatch to the Caliph Omar, Amru enu
merated the glories of Alexandria and spoke of "its 4,000 palaces, 4,000
baths, 400 theaters, 1,200 shops for the sale of vegetables, and 40,000
tributary Jews."
The Saracens, after capturing Alexandria, almost immediately set
out to conquer the North African coast. General Abdullah, starting
from Memphis with an army forty thousand strong, traversed the
desert of Barca and besieged Tripoli; but the onset of a plague in his
forces compelled a retreat to Egypt. Twenty years later, another at
tempt was made to take over North Africa, when General Akbah led
an army from the Nile River to the Atlantic Ocean. Facing the Canary
Islands, the Saracen general rode his horse into the ocean and pro
claimed: "Great God! If my course were not stopped by this sea, I
would still go on to the unknown'kingdoms of the West, preaching the
unity of thy holy name, and putting to the sword the rebellious nations
who worship any other gods than thee." Early in the eighth century,
Caliph Alwalid of Damascus authorized his general, Musa, to under
take an invasion of Europe by way of Spain. The conquest of North Africa was completed in 708 when Musa subdued all of Morocco ex
cept Ceuta, which was under the rule of the Byzantine governor,
Count Julian. Musa could go no further until an army of Moors and
Berbers was organized and the opposition of Count Julian was over
come; and this task was accomplished by a Moor named Tarik. The
events leading up to the Moorish invasion of Andalusia have been in
terestingly related by Professor de Graft-Johnson:
Among the African chiefs converted to the Islamic faith during the Arab
invasion of Morocco was a great general known as Tarik. . . . Tarik was given the rank of general in the Arab army by Musa-ibn-Nusair. Musa later left Tarik in charge of Tangiers and made him governor of Mauri



268 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
tania. . . . The African, Tarik, now governor of Mauritania, entered into
friendly relations with Count Julian, governor of Ceuta. It was then that
Tarik discovered that Julian was on very bad terms with his master, Roder
ick, the Gothic king of Spain. Roderick, a profligate prince, had ravished
Julian's daughter, and Julian was looking for a way to avenge the dishonor
done to his family. Count Julian urged the African Tarik to invade Spain,
but the suggestion had to be carried out cautiously. Tarik accordingly informed Musa-ibn-Nusair, who had appointed him governor, that he in
tended crossing the straits to survey and examine the possibilities for an
invasion. (59, pp. 68-69)
This preliminary invasion was delegated ro Tarif, an officer in Tank's army. Four boats were borrowed from Count Julian, who is said to have accompanied Tarif; and an army of four hundred men and a
hundred horses were transported to Spain. The army landed at a place
later renamed Tarifa in honor of Tarif; and it was at the port of Tarifa
that the Moors later levied a certain tax, which, taking its name from
the town, became known as the tariff. Tarif and his small force plun
dered Algericas and neighboring towns and returned to Africa, with
their boats laden with spoils. This result was encouraging, so Tarik, in
71 1, led an army of twelve thousand in an all-out invasion of Spain. In
de Graft-Johnson's words:
Tarik crossed the straits and landed on the isthmus between an escarp
ment, then known as Mons Calpe, and the continent. . . . Realizing the immense advantage which Mons Calpe commanded, Tarik ordered a castle
to be built ortit so that he could retire there and hold out should he meet
with reverses in battle. Part of this castle is still to be seen today.
Tarik left a garrison at the foot of Mons Calpe (which the Africans re
named, in compliment to their general, Gebel Tarik—the Hill of Tarik
name which was subsequently corrupted by the Spaniards into Gibraltar). General Tarik and his African army surprised and captured several Spanish towns, among them Heraclea, which was only four miles from the rock of
Gibraltar. King Roderick soon heard about the invading army and he set
about gathering a huge force to oppose Tarik. After a series of skirmishes,
the two armies met near Xeres in Andalusia. The conflict was a bloody one,
but Tarik was victorious and soon became master of Spain. (59, p. 69)
There is a droll and fantastic legend concerning King Roderick. Ac
cording to this tale, prior to the Moorish invasion of Spain, King Rod
erick was visited at his palace in Toledo by two elderly men who
sought audience with him. These visitors were clad in white robes of



THE ARAB-MOORISH CULTURE 269
ancient design and wore girdles adorned with the zodiacal signs from which hung numerous keys. Addressing the monarch, the old men announced: "Know, O King, that in days of yore, when Hercules had set
up his pillars at the ocean strait, he erected a strong tower near to this
ancient city of Toledo, and shut up within it a magical spell, secured by
a ponderous iron gate with locks of steel; and he ordained that every
new king should set a fresh lock to the portal, and foretold woe and de
struction to him who should seek to unravel the mystery of the tower.
Now, we and our ancestors have kept the door of the tower from the
days of Hercules even to this hour; and though there have been kings
who have sought to discover the secret, their end has ever been death
or sore amazement. None ever penetrated beyond the threshold. Now,
O King, we come to beg thee to affix thy lock upon the enchanted
tower as all the kings before thee have done."
This message having been delivered, the aged pair departed. Roder
ick naturally wanted to find out the secret of the tower and so informed
his courtiers. His counselors warned him against such an endeavor and
told him that no one had ever entered the tower and returned to tell
about it; and that even Julius Caesar had not dared to enter the strong
hold. The royal advisers conveyed to the king the following poetic ad
monition:
Nor shall it ever ope, old records say,
Save to a king, the last of all his line,
What time his empire totters to decay,
And treason digs, beneath, her fatal mine, And high above impends avenging wrath Divine.
This, of course, did not hold back King Roderick who, surrounded
by a group of cavaliers, one day advanced on the tower, which stood on
a lofty rock, hemmed in by cliffs and precipices. The walls of this
tower were of jasper and marble, inlaid with designs which sparkled in
the rays of the sun. The entrance was by way of a passage cut through
stone, and was barred by a huge iron gate covered with rusty locks,
said to date back to the time of Hercules; and on each side of the gate
stood one of the two venerable men who had visited the audience
chamber of the king. For almost a day the two elderly guardians of the
gate, aided by the cavaliers of the king, turned keys in the rusty locks.
Slightly before sunset, the gate was opened and the royal party entered
the enchanted tower. Inside the gate was a hall, on the other side of
which was a door guarded by a gigantic bronze figure of terrible as



270 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
peer, which continuously swung a massive mace that smote the ground
nearby with mighty blows. On the breast of this monster robot King
Roderick saw the words "1 do my duty"; so the king appealed to the
animated image to permit him to pass, since he planned no sacrilege,
but only wished to solve the mystery of the tower. The figure then be
came still and, with uplifted mace, allowed the king and his compan
ions through the door into the second room. There they found them
selves in a chamber encrusted with precious stones in the midst of
which was a table, which had been placed therein by Hercules; and on the table was a casket upon which was engraved an inscription which
read: 'in this coffer is the mystery of the Tower. The hand of none
but a king can open it; but let him beware, for wonderful things will be
disclosed to him, which must happen before his death."
The king opened the coffer and on the inside was a piece of parchment folded between two plates of copper. On the parchment were
pictures of fierce warriors on horseback armed with bows and scimi
tars, and above them was theslogan: "Behold rash man, those who shall
hurl thee from thy throne and subdue thy kingdom." As the king and
his courtiers gazed at the figures on the parchment, they suddenly be
came aware of the sounds of battle. The figures of horsemen began to
move, and before them arose a vision of war:
They beheld before them a great field of battle where Christians and Moors were engaged in deadly conflict. They heard the rush and tramping
of steeds, the^blast of trump and clarion, the clash of cymbal, and the stormy din of a thousand drums. There was the flash of swords and maces
and battle axes with the whistling of arrows and the hurling of darts and
lances. The Christians quailed before the foe. The infidels pressed upon
them and put them to utter rout; the standard of the cross was cast down,
the banner of Spain was trodden under foot; the air resounded with shouts of triumph, with yells of fury and with the groans of dying men. Amidst
the flying squadrons, King Roderick beheld a crowned warrior whose back was turned towards him, but whose armor and device were his own, and who was mounted on a white steed that resembled his own war horse Ore
lia. In the confusion of the fight, the warrior was dismounted and was no
longer seen to be, and Orelia galloped wildly through the field of battle
without a rider. (The Conquest of Spain, Bonn's edition, pp. 378 ff., by
Washington Irving, cited by Stanley Lane-Poole in 140, pp. 18-19)
As the vision of the impending disaster came to an end, the king and
his attendants fled from the tower in a state of panic. By this time, the



THK ARAB-MOORISH CULTURE 271
great bronze image had vanished, and the two old men were lying dead
at the entrance to the tower. The tower itself then burst into flame and
every stone of it was consumed by fire.
When King Roderick went forth to do battle with the Moors he led
a large army that outnumbered his foe six to one. He was clad in an
outfit of ornate armor and was covered by a magnificent canopy. But
the Africans quailed not; for, as General Tarik led them into battle, his
voice rang out: "Men, before you is the enemy and the sea is at your
backs. By Allah, there is no escape for you save in valor and resolu
tion." This electrified the Moorish and they shouted in reply: "We
will follow thee, O. Tarik," as they charged into the ranks of the
enemy. The battle raged for a week, but finally the African invaders broke through the Andalusian lines and King Roderick and his hosts
were routed, the king himself being killed in the battle.
The Islamic culture of the Middle Ages is customarily refer/ed to as
Arabic, but the fact is that the Arabs were a minority in the so-called
Arabic world, and their chief contribution was the Arabic language.
This matter has been judiciously explained by Professor de Graft
Johnson:
It was because the conquering army in Spain was largely made up of Af
ricans from Morocco that we hear such phrases as the Moorish invasion of
Spain, and why Shakespeare's hero Othello is a Moor, and why the word
blackamoor exists in the English language, a word which leaves no doubt as
to the color of the army of occupation in Spain and Portugal.
To begin with, there was an intolerant self-sufficiency among the Arabs which made the Koran the only source of learning and the only book worth reading. This made the development of science and true knowledge impos
sible, but the intolerance was soon to give way to a new wave of learning. The organization of education throughout the Moslem world began in the
eighth century and by the ninth, learned men in the schools of Cordova in
Spain were corresponding with the learned in Kairowan, Cairo, Bagdad, Bokhara and Samarkand. The Greek classics were rediscovered and Aristotle came into his own.
The museum at Alexandria, so long neglected, became the center of re
search and learning. Mathematics, medicine, and the physical sciences received fresh attention. The clumsy Roman numerals were soon ousted by
the Arabic figures which we use to this day, and the zero sign first came
into general usage. Arabic words like algebra and chemistry became univer
sal words. . . . The term Arabic we intend in a cultural rather than a racial
sense, for the Arabs did not believe in any herrenvolk theory and freely in
termarried with those they conquered. ... It was through Africa that the



272 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
new knowledge of China, India and Arabia reached Europe, and it was Af
rica which supplied the men who protected Moslem Europe or Spain from
attack, and thus made it possible for the new learning to take root and de
velop. (59, pp. 74-76)
After overrunning the Iberian Peninsula, the Moorish invaders
pushed on through to France, where they were repulsed with heavy
losses by an army of Franks, led by Charles Martel. After this setback,
they retired into Spain, and there laid the foundations of a new civiliza
tion. The country was incalculably enriched by their labors. They, for
instance, first established the silk industry in Spain; they were highly
skilled agriculturists; and they introduced cotton, rice, sugar cane,
dates, ginger, lemons, and strawberries into the peninsula. Abu Zacaria
and Ibn-al-Awam wrote learned works on animal husbandry and agri
culture. A translation of an agricultural treatise by Ibn-al-Awam
(twelfth century) was published in Spain as late as 1802 for the in
struction of Spanish farmers. Ibn Khaldun, another Moorish expert on
agriculture, wrote an important treatise on farming and worked out a
theory of prices and the nature of capital. The Moorish achievement in
hydraulic engineering was outstanding. The Caliph Abd-er-Rahman of
Cordova commissioned the construction of an aqueduct which con
veyed water from the mountains to the city through lead pipes. In
modern Spain, only minute vestiges remain of the extensive irrigation
systems constructed by Moorish engineers; who also built large under
ground silos for the storage of grain in cases of emergency. The min
eral wealth ofthe land was not disregarded, for copper, gold, silver, tin,
lead, iron, quicksilver, and alum were mined on a large scale. Up to the
twelfth century, the maritime commerce of the Saracens on the Medi
terranean was greater than that of the Christian nations, and hundreds
of ships were engaged in it. This extensive trade was a natural stimu
lant to manufacturing. The sword blades of Toledo in quality and ap
pearance excelled all others produced in Europe, and a factory not far
from Cordova turned out twelve thousand fine shields per year. In
Murcia, factories fabricated all sorts of iron and brass implements; the
tanneries of Cordova and Morocco City were the best in the world;
Almeria specialized in the production of sashes, famous for their fine
texture and brilliant colors; carpets were made in Teulala, and bright
hued woolens in Granada and Baza. The Moorish craftsmen also pro
duced glass and pottery, vases, mosaics, and jewelry.
Cordova was the wonderful citv of the tenth century; the streets



THE ARAB-MOORISH CULTURE 273
were well paved and there were raised sidewalks for pedestrians. At
night one could walk for ten miles by the light of lamps, flanked by an
uninterrupted extent of buildings. All this was hundreds of years before
there was a paved street in Paris or a street lamp in London. Cordova
with a population exceeding one million was served by four thousand
public markets and five thousand mills. Its public baths numbered in
the hundreds, when bathing in the rest of Europe was frowned upon as
a diabolical custom, avoided by all good Christians. Moorish monarchs
dwelt in sumptuous palaces, while the crowned heads of England,
France, and Germany lived in big barns, lacking both windows and
chimneys and with only a hole in the roof for the exit of smoke. Educa
tion was universal in Moslem Spain, being given to the most humble,
while in Christian Europe 99 percent of the populace was illiterate, and
even kings could neither read nor write. In the tenth and eleventh
centuries, public libraries in Christian Europe were conspicuous by
their absence, while Moslem Spain could boast of more than seventy,
of which the one in Cordova housed 600,000 manuscripts. Christian
Europe contained only two universities of any consequence, while in
Spain there were seventeen outstanding universities. The finest were
those located in Almeria, Cordova, Granada, Jaen, Malaga, Seville, and
Toledo. Scientific progress in astronomy, chemistry, physics, mathe
matics, geography, and philology in Mqslem Spain reached a high level
of development. Scholars and artists formed associations to promote
their particular studies, and scientific congresses were organized to pro
mote research and facilitate the spread of knowledge.
Other cities in Spain were scarcely less opulent than Cordova. The
Sheik Ash-Shakandi, a Moorish scholar of the early thirteenth century,
was widely traveled in Spain and Morocco, and he praised highly the
glories of several other great cities of the Moorish Empire. Almeria
came in for special commendation. It was a bustling seaport, and its
shipyard manufactured fine boats. This greatest of Andalusian marts
did a thriving business in the maritime exports and imports. Ships from
eastern lands brought to its docks the finest goods of India and China.
The Almerian silk factories specialized in the production of damasks
and brocades and of silver and gold tissues, a trade which employed
thousands of artisans. There were also factories turning out high-qual
ity glass, pottery, and hardware. "Almeria is an opulent and magnif
icent city," said the Sheik, "whose fame has spread far and wide. God
has endowed its inhabitants with various gifts, such as a temperate cli



274 MAN, 001), AND CIVILIZATION
mare and abundance of fruits; rhey are handsome, well-made, good na
tured, very hospitable, very much attached to their friends and, above
all things, very refined in their manners and very elegant in their dress.
Its coast is the finest in all the Mediterranean as well as the safest and
most frequented." The citizens of Almeria were the wealthiest in all
Andalusia and managed to create a big factory town without detracting
from its scenic beauty and charm. A picturesque river wound over the
landscape for forty miles, and along its banks were groves, gardens, and
orchards inhabited by songbirds who delighted with their harmonies
the ears of the citizens.
A brisk intellectual life flourished in all parts of the Islamic domin
ions, for caliphs of both the East and the West were, as a rule, en
lightened patrons of learning. Caliph Al Hakem of Cordova filled an
entire palace with books collected from all parts of the known world,
and the 600,000 volumes of the royal library were all carefully cata
logued. Caliph Al-Mamun of Bagdad imported hundreds of camel loads
of books into his metropolis, and he signed a treaty with the Emperor
Michael III of the Byzantine Empire in which he stipulated that an en
tire library in Constantinople should be given to him. In this library
was a rare literary treasure, the treatise of Claudius Ptolemy on the
mathematical structure of the heavens. The Caliph, an able astronomer
himself, had the work translated into Arabic under the title of "The
Almagest." Harun-al-Rashid was the founder of the University of
Bagdad, and the most celebrated professor of this institution was a Jew
ish scholar, Joshua Ben Nun. Harun was also a patron of the Medical
College of Djoridesabour in southern Persia, and graduate students in
medicine had to pass an examination set by the faculty of that school or
by that of the University of Bagdad before being licensed to practice
the healing art. The Caliph Al-Mamun appointed a noted Christian
scholar to the presidency of a college in Damascus. The same ruler commissioned Postmaster Ibn Khurdadbeh of Bagdad to make a geo
graphical survey of his realms, mapping all sea and land routes, with all
places accurately located in respect to latitude and longitude. The Sara
cens adopted the decimal system of numerical notation from the mathe
maticians of India, and this notation was perfected by Mohammed Ben
Musa Al-Khwarizmi in the ninth century. He also introduced zero as a
mathematical quantity. The same mathematician wrote the first text
book on algebra and was the author of a treatise on spherical trigonom
etry. The Moslem mathematicians solved quadratic and cubic equa
tions in algebra and made trigonometry into a science by substituting



THE ARAB-MOORISH CULTURE 275
sines and tangents for the chords of the Greeks. Omar Khayyam is
now remembered for his poetry, but in his own time he was best known as a mathematician and an astronomer. The Caliph Al-Mamun
(ninth century) determined the obliquity of the ecliptic and calculated
the circumference of the earth by sending out an expedition which
measured the length of a degree of latitude on the shore of the Red Sea.
We have been taught in popular school histories that Magellan estab
lished the fact of the rotundity of the earth by circumnavigating it in
1519. This popular opinion is false, for Moorish schoolteachers taught
geography from globes long before Magellan's birth. The Moorish
scientist El Idrisi (twelfth century) wrote a book on geography, and in
that work said: "What results from the opinion of philosophers, learned
men, and those skilled in observation of the heavenly bodies, is that the
world is round as a sphere, of which the waters are adherent and main
tained upon its surface by natural equilibrium. It is surrounded by air,
and all created bodies are stable on its surfaces, the earth drawing to it
self all that is heavy in the same way as a magnet attracts iron." (Cited
by Lady Lugard in 146, pp. 37-38) Avicenna of Bokhara (980-1037) was a philosopher, physician, and
geologist and wrote many scientific and philosophical treatises. His best
known works were The Utility and Advantage of Science, Health and
Remedies, Canons of Physic, Astronomical Observations, Mathematical
Theorems, The Arabic Language, The Origin of the Soul and the Resur
rection of the Body, An Abridgment of Euclid, Physics and Metaphysics,
An Encyclopedia of Human Knowledge (twenty volumes). Under the scepter of Abd-er-Rahman, the western caliphate ex
tended from the Pyrenees to the borders of the Sudan; and there was a
dual government, with courts in both Spain and Morocco. This state
was known as the Empire of the Two Shores, and its sovereign, Abd
er-Rahman, was a man of many talents and high character. We have
been reliably informed: u His meekness, his generosity and his love of
justice became proverbial. . . . He was fond of science and the patron
of the learned, with whom he loved to converse, spending those hours
that he stole from the arduous labors of the administration in literary
meetings, to which all the eminent poets and learned men of his court
were admitted." (146, p. 51) The Moors introduced the manufacture of gunpowder into Europe,
and then their enemies adopted this weapon and used it to drive them
back into Africa. After several centuries of dominance, the culture of
Islam finally faded away into decadence. The Saracens never recovered



276 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
from the conquests of the Seljuk Turks in the eleventh century and the Mongols in the thirteenth. The Mongols, under Hulagu Khan, cap
tured and sacked Bagdad in 1258, when they destroyed the great irri
gation system dating back to antiquity, and thus turned vast areas of
fertile land into a desert. The disintegration of the Cordovan caliphate
dates from the year 1031, when the internecine strife of the Moslems
made it possible for their Christian enemies to overpower them. By
1492, the Moors had lost all Spain except the kingdom of Granada; and
the Christians were finally united by the marriage of Ferdinand and Is
abella, which joined in peace the formerly hostile royal houses of Ara
gon and Castile. The consolidated Christian forces cut off" and block
aded the city of Granada for eight months. The Moorish monarch,
King Baobdil, eventually capitulated. They lingered in Spain for a
while, but by 1610, through expulsion and migration, a million of them
had returned to North and West Africa.
The word Moor literally means black, so the Moors were the black
people. The Frenchman, de Fontenelle, in 1686 in his book Conversa
tion on the Plurality of Worlds speculated on what kind of people inhab
ited the planet Venus. "I can tell from here," he said, "what the inhab
itants of Venus are like; they resemble the Moors of Granada; a small
black people, burned by the sun, full of wit and fire, always in love,
writing verse, fond of music, arranging festivals, dances and tourna
ments every day." (Cited by Robert Jastrow in 125, pp. 1 18-19)
The final undoing of the dusky Moors was their underestimation of
the menace of the fair barbarians to the north of the Pyrenees. A Mos
lem historian iri the eleventh century referred to these people as barbar
ians with big bellies, pale skins, long and lank hair, and declared:
"They lack keenness of understanding and clarity of intelligence, and
are overcome by ignorance and foolishness, blindness and stupidity."
Another Moorish scholar, Said of Toledo, in the thirteenth century,
spoke of this same group of people in the following words: "They are
cold of temperament and never reach maturity. They are of great stat
ure and of a white color. But they lack all sharpness of wit and penetra
tion of intellect." (Cited by J. B. S. Haldane in 106, p. 138) The ex
pulsion of the Moors from Spain was a serious setback to modern
civilization. One of the finest studies of the Moorish contribution to
world history was Stanley Lane-Poole's The Story of the Moors in Spain
(140). This work is now a very rare book, but the interested student
should have some acquaintance with it, so we give the gist of this excel
lent study in the words of its distinguished author:



THE ARAB-MOORISH CULTURE 277
The history of Spain offers us a melancholy contrast. Twelve hundred
years ago, Tarik the Moor added the land of the Visigoths to the long cata
log of kingdoms subdued by the Moslems. For nearly eight centuries, under her Mohammedan rulers, Spain set to all Europe a shining example of a civ
ilized and enlightened state. Her fertile provinces, rendered doubly prolific
by the industry and engineering skill of her conquerors, bore fruit an hun
dred fold. Cities innumerable sprang up in the rich valleys of the Guadelquivir and the Guadiana, whose names, and names only, still commemorate
the vanished glories of their past. Art, literature, and science prospered as
they then prospered nowhere else in Europe. Students flocked from France and Germany and England to drink from the fountain of learning which
flowed only in the cities of the Moors. The surgeons and doctors of Andalusia were in the van of science: women were encouraged to devote them
selves to serious study, and the lady doctor was not unknown among the people of Cordova. Mathematics, astronomy and botany, history, philoso
phy and jurisprudence were to be mastered in Spain and in Spain alone.
The practical work of the field, the scientific methods of irrigation, the arts
of fortification and shipbuilding; the highest and most elaborate products of
the loom, the graver and the hammer, the potter's wheel and the mason's
trowel, were brought to perfection by the Spanish Moors. In the practice of
war, no less than in the arts of peace, they long stood supreme. Their fleets
disputed the command of the Mediterranean with the Fatimites, while their
armies carried fire and sword through the Christian marches. The Cid him
self, the national hero, long fought on the Moorish side, and in all save education was more than half a Moor. Whatsoever makes a kingdom great and prosperous, whatsoever tends to refinement and civilization, was found in Moslem Spain. In 1492 the last bulwark of the Moors gave way before the crusade of
Ferdinand and Isabella, and with Granada fell all Spain's greatness. ... In
the land where science was once supreme, the Spanish doctors became
noted for nothing but their ignorance and incapacity, and the discoveries of Newton and Harvey were condemned as pernicious to the faith. Where
once seventy public libraries had fed the minds of scholars, and half a mil
lion books had been gathered at Cordova for the benefit of the world, such
indifference to learning afterwards prevailed that the new capital, Madrid,
possessed no public library in the eighteenth century, and even the manu
scripts of the Escurial were denied in our own day to the first scholarly his
torian of the Moors, though himself a Spaniard. The sixteen thousand looms
of Seville soon dwindled to a fifth of their ancient number; the arts and in
dustries of Toledo and Almeria faded into insignificance; the very baths
public buildings of equal ornament and use—were destroyed because clean
liness savored too strongly of rank infidelity. The land, deprived of the
skillful irrigation of the Moors, grew impoverished and neglected; the rich



278 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
est and most fertile valleys languished and were deserted; most of the popu
lous cities which had filled every district of Andalusia fell into ruinous
decay; and beggars, friars and bandits took the place of scholars, merchants
and knights. So low fell Spain when she had driven away the Moors. Such
is the melancholy contrast offered by her history. (140, pp. vii-ix)
Lane-Poole concluded his brilliant chronicle of the Moorish achieve
ment in Spain with this dolorous passage:
The Moors were banished; for a while Christian Spain shone like the
moon, with a borrowed light; then came the eclipse, and in that darkness
Spain has grovelled ever since. The true memorial of the Moors is seen in
desolate tracts of utter barrenness, where once the Moslem grew luxuriant
vines and olives and yellow ears of corn; in a stupid, ignorant population
where once wit and learning flourished; in the general stagnation and deg
radation of a people which has hopelessly fallen in the scale of nations, and
has deserved its humiliation. (140, p. 280)
The outstanding characteristic of the Arab-Moorish monarchs was
their urbanity and tolerance. Their relations with the most distant na
tions were extremely cordial. Our knowledge of the past has been
greatly enriched by the industry of Moslem travelers, historians, and
scholars. Early in the tenth century, mariners of Oman in the south of
Arabia sailed southward to trade with the Zanj (Swahili) of the East
African coast. In one of their boats was Al Masudi of Bagdad, a great
historian of his age, and a voluminous writer. Most of his works have
perished, but one great opus survives, his Meadows of Gold and Mines of
Gems. A complete French translation of this great narrative was pub
lished in Paris, in 1864, in nine volumes. The only English translation,
a one-volume abridgment, was published in London in 1841. There
was a brisk ivory trade in the tenth century between East Africa and
India and China. Masudi related how the tusks of ivory from the Zanj
country were first taken to Oman and there transshipped to India and
China. "In China," he noted, "the kings and their military and civilian
officers use carrying chairs of ivory. . . . Ivory is much prized in India;
there it is made into handles for the daggers known as harari or ham in
the singular, as well as for the hilts of curved swords. . . . But the
biggest use of ivory is in the manufacture of chessmen and other gam
ing pieces." (Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems, Aloys Sprenger's
translation, cited in 7)
Besides the Zanj of Africa, Masudi wrote of another Zanj Empire in
Asia, centered in Indochina and spreading into Malaysia and Indonesia.



THE ARAB-MOORISH CULTURE 279
"India is a vast country," said Masudi, "having many seas and mountains, and borders upon the empire of ez-Zanij, which is the kingdom
of the Maharaj, the king of the islands, whose dominions form the fron
tier between India and China, and are considered as part of India." He
referred to the "splendor and high civilization" of these Asiatic Zanj
and stated that "the Maharaj is lord of the sixth sea and king of the
islands from which drugs and spices are exported and that the popula
tion and the number of the troops of his kingdom cannot be counted;
and the islands under his scepter are so numerous that the fastest sailing
vessel is not able to go round them in two years." (Meadows of Gold

According to Masudi, the people of this island empire were black. These Asiatic blacks were the Khmers, who were dominant in south
east Asia for six hundred years, and their center of culture was in Cam
bodia. It flourished during the years 800-1432. We have been informed by a contemporary investigator:
The Khmers began to develop their civilization about 2,000 years ago under the influence of traders from India and later from China. A Chinese
traveler of the third century A.D. reported: "The men are all ugly and
black. Their hair is curly. They go naked and barefoot." A later account of
the Khmer region, which the Chinese called Funan, said: "The people of
Funan make rings and bracelets of gold and vessels of silver." In the middle of the sixth century, Funan merged with another Khmer kingdom inland
known as Chenla to form a larger nation that called itself Kambujadesa—in
its westernized form, Cambodia (228, p. 137)
The Moorish historian Idrisi (1100-1166) referred to the superior
quality of Indian iron in one of his historical works. This Indian iron
was the famous wootz steel, fabricated in India from iron imported
from southeast Africa. The celebrated Damascus blades were made
from this steel.
When the first Portuguese explorers sailed up the east coast of Af
rica on the way to India they were surprised to find there a series of
seaport cities, such as Sofala, Mombasa, Kilwa, Malindi, and Zanzibar.
Kilwa was the greatest of these trading ports. In the year 1331 the fa
mous Moorish globe-trotter Ibn Batuta journeyed down the East Afri
can coast. Of all the places he visited, Kilwa impressed him most favor
ably. We give his impressions in his own words:
Then I set off by sea from the town of Mogadishu for the land of the
Swahili and the town of Kilwa, which is in the land of Zanj. We arrived at



280 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Mombasa, a large island two days' journey from the land of the Swahili.
The island is quite separate from the mainland. It grows bananas, lemons
and oranges. . . . The people do not engage in agriculture, but import
grain from the Swahili. The greater part of their diet is bananas and fish.
. . . We spent a night on the island of Mombasa and then set sail for
Kilwa, the principal town on the coast, the greater part of whose inhabit
ants are Zanj of very black complexion. . . . Kilwa is one of the most beau
tiful and well constructed towns in the world. The whole of it is elegantly
built. (92, p. 31)
Most of the Swahili trading ports were destroyed by Portuguese
vandals in the early sixteenth century, but the one emporium that man
aged to survive was Zanzibar. Famous for its spices, Zanzibar is an
island some four hundred miles south of the equator and about twenty
miles off the Tanzanian coast. In 1940, from the fourteen million clove
trees of Zanzibar, a crop of fifteen thousand tons of cloves was realized.
This was about 80 percent of the clove production of the entire world.
Zanzibar is one of those exotic places that has a charm all of its own.
We have learned from the statement of a resident that: "There are
worse places than Zanzibar, but not much worse. The place is so
windy that passengers on landing are blown up the beach right into the
Africa Hotel, which serves whiskey with lizards in it. You'll be sorry if
you visit Zanzibar, but you will be equally sorry if you do not. The
Island has a railroad that goes to a place called Boobooboo. It is of very
narrow gauge and has eight engines; one for every mile." (Cited by
Carveth Wells in 264, p. 158)
Ibn Batuta was born in Morocco in 1303, and starting in his youth
spent about thirty years traveling widely in Africa, Asia, and Europe.
In 1 349 he settled down in Fez, the capital of the kingdom of Morocco,
for a rest from his globe-trotting. The head of state of that nation was
at the time King Abu el Hacen, and Ibn Batuta thought him a good ad
ministrator, and regarded conditions of life in his kingdom as highly
commendable. His sentiments have been preserved for posterity by a modern commentator:
For reasons which he sets forth at length, his judgment was convinced
that the noble country over which its sovereign ruled was the best country and the best administered of all those that he had visited. Here he found the
conditions of life better than in any other country. Food was more plentiful,
varied and cheap; life and property were more secure, law was milder, jus
tice was more assured, charity more fully organized, religion more truly maintained, and literature, science and art more honored than in any other



THE ARAB-MOORISH CULTURE 281
center of civilization. He mentions in regard to the organized charities of
the country, that free hospitals were constructed and endowed in every
town of the kingdom. As regards the endowment of science and literature,
he describes the great College of Fez as having no parallel in the known
world for size, beauty and magnificence. He speaks of the deep interest
taken by the sovereign in all that related to science and literature, the very
considerable literary achievements of the sovereign himself, and of the gen
erous protection which he gave to all persons who were devoted to the
study of science. (146, pp. 74-75)
In the mid-fourteenth century, the Empire of Mali in the western
Sudan was an enlightened and prosperous state, and Ibn Batuta could
not resist the urge to pay it a visit; so on February 18, 1 352, he crossed
the Moroccan border and headed south for Mali. The Moorish traveler
crossed the frontier of Mali at Walata. Though noting the excessive
heat, Batuta liked Walata and its citizens. He noticed that foodstuffs
were good and plentiful, and that the citizens wore clothing of an at
tractive design. The women were charming and beautiful and, in Batu
ta's opinion, decidedly superior to the men. He pondered over their
somewhat odd customs—especially the practice of tracing kinship in
the female line, through a maternal uncle, and of inheritance passing
not from father to son, but from father to the son of a sister. This prac
tice was common in the Sudan, but Batuta recorded that the only other
place he had come across these customs was among the inhabitants of
Malibar in India. From Walata to Niani, the Malian capital was a jour
ney of twenty days. Along the highway, villages were numerous, trav
eling was safe, good food was plentiful and cheap, and among the flora
of the region were fruit trees which bore fruits resembling plums, ap
ples, peaches, and apricots. Anything needful during the journey could
be purchased at the roadside villages. Ibn Batuta walked into Niani just
in time to be present at the ceremony of the ending of the fast of Ra
madan. The prime feature of this celebration was the presenting of
arms to the Sultan. Squires presented to the ruler magnificent swords,
trimmed in gold, with scabbards of the precious metal, spears of gold
and silver, quivers of gold, and clubs of crystal. This was succeeded by
dramatic performances, with fencing, dancing, gymnastics, and the
recitation of comic poetry included; and which the Moorish visitor re
garded as first-rate entertainment. Lady Lugard in her fascinating book
A Tropical Dependency devotes a whole chapter to the adventures of
Ibn Batuta in Mali; and the feature of these happenings that arrested
her attention the most was the fact that some of the customs of Mali in



282 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
the fourteenth century were almost identical with those of the contem
porary Aztecs of Mexico. In her own words:
Poets wearing masks and dressed like birds were allowed to speak their
opinion to the monarch. Ibn Batuta states that this practice was of great an
tiquity, long anterior to the introduction of Islam among these people. The
description which he gives in some detail can hardly fail to recall similar
practices inherited from the Tezcucans by the Aztecs, who in nearly the
same latitude on the American continent were at this very moment, in the
middle of the fourteenth century, making good their position upon the
Mexican plateau. . . . They had other customs which correspond to those
of the Sudanese. The Aztec crown was transmitted, like that of Mali, in
collateral descent, though in both kingdoms, exceptions to the rule oc
curred. The practice of keeping the sons of subject princes as a sort of hon
orable hostage at the court of the monarch was perhaps too general to be
worthy of special note, though it was also common to the two people. The
more terrible custom of propitiating the gods with human sacrifice which
was so extensively practiced by the Aztecs, was, it will be remembered,
only the other day brought to an end under British rule in Benin, and is
probably still practiced in less accessible portions of the Pagan belt. . . .
The custom of wearing the heads of animals as headdress, which was also
common to the Aztecs, was preserved among the Pagans of the West Afri
can coast at the time of the first occupation of the Gold Coast by the Portu
guese in 1481. (146, pp. 137-39)



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
The Evolution of Civilization:
Ancient America
J. A. ROGERS, in his scholarly work Africa's Gift to America, cited Latin-American scholars on the ancient African influence in America. For example, C. C. Marquez is quoted as saying: "The Negro type is seen in the most ancient American sculpture. . . . Negroes figure fre
quently in the most remote traditions." From the Mexican historian,
Riva-Palacio, we have the following: "It is indisputable that in very an
cient times the Negro race occupied our territory (Mexico). . . . The
Mexicans recall a Negro god, Ixlilton,* which means black-face." Also, we have the testimony of Nicolas Leon, who declared: "The almost ex
tinction of the original Negroes during the time of the Spanish con
quest and the memories of them in the most ancient traditions induce
us to believe that the Negroes were the first inhabitants of Mexico."
In a little scholarly monograph, African Explorers of the New World,
Harold G. Lawrence expressed the following opinions:
That Africans voyaged across the Atlantic before the era of Christopher
Columbus is no recent belief. Scholars have long speculated that a great
seafaring nation which sent its ships to the Americas once existed on Afri
ca's west coast. . . . We can now positively state that the Mandingos of the
Mali and Songhay Empires and possibly other Africans, crossed the Atlan
tic to carry on trade with the Western Hemisphere Indians, and further
succeeded in establishing colonies throughout the Americas. (142, p. 2)
The Arab historian Abulfeda (1273-1332) described the world as
being spherical in shape and told of ships which had circumnavigated
* Ixlilton was the Aztec god of medicine and good health. The priests of this god were medicine men or shamans who specialized in the medical treatment of children. Do we have here an Aztec version of Imhotep, the deified Egyptian physician who became a god of medicine among the Greeks, under the name of Imouthes?
283



284 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
the globe. We have documentary evidence of an African expedition to
the New World as late as the fourteenth century. In the magazine
West Africa, for Saturday, June 7, 1969, there was an article by Basil Davidson entitled: "Africans Before Columbus?" According to Davidson: "Columbus and other early European arriv
als in America came back with quite a bit of evidence, suggestive but
inconclusive, that black peoples from Africa had already reached those
shores. Various writers have pointed from time to time, over the past
twenty years and more, to the likely West African origins of these
black explorers, notably of that tribe of Almamys who were said to have settled in Honduras." The great West African potentate, Mansa Musa I of Mali (ca.
1312-1337), while visiting his friend the Caliph of Cairo in Egypt, became engaged in discussion with an Egyptian scholar, Ibn Amir Hajib. This conversation was recorded by the Egyptian annalist Al-Omari.
The account of this discourse, given below, was translated from the
Arabic by Basil Davidson. The dialog was between Mansa Musa and
Ibn Amir Hajib, and went as follows:
1 asked the Sultan Musa how it was that power came into his hands.
"We are," he told me, "from a house that transmits power by heritage. The ruler who preceded me (probably Mansa Mohammed) would not be
lieve that it was impossible to discover the limits of the neighboring sea (i.e., the Mali Empire's western and southwestern sea, the Atlantic). He wanted
to find out and persisted in his plan. "He had two hundred ships equipped and filled with men, and others in the same number filled with gold, water and supplies in sufficient quantity
to last for years. He told those who commanded them: 'Return only when you have reached the extremity of the ocean, or when you have exhausted your food and water.' They went away; their absence was long before any
of them returned. Finally, a single ship reappeared. We asked the captain
about their adventures.
" 'Prince,' he replied, 'we sailed for a long time, up to the moment when we encountered in mid-ocean something like a river with a violent current.
My ship was lost. The others sailed on, and gradually as each of them en
tered this place, they disappeared and did not come back. We did not know what had happened to them. As to me, I returned where I was and did not
enter that current.' "But the Emperor (Muhammad), did not want to believe him. He equipped two thousand vessels, a thousand for himself, and a thousand for water and supplies. He conferred power on me (Mansa Musa) and left with his companions on the ocean. This was the last time that I saw him and the others, and I remained absolute master of the empire." (56)



ANCIENT AMERICA 285
"Now it seems very probable indeed," Basil Davidson commented,
"that Musa said this to Ibn Hajib who told Al-Omari, a careful annal
ist, whose information about Mali rested on other eye witness accounts
by Egyptian scholars who had sojourned there."
Continuing speculations on this topic, Davidson finally concluded:
Those who believe that the sailors of Mali did in fact reach the Americas
have other evidence to adduce. They point out that ships sailing west from
Senegal would pass the Cape Verdes a little north of latitude 10 degrees
north and that, in doing so, they would sail into the steady westward
flowing equatorial current, and thence into the Antilles current as far as the
Gulf of Mexico. They also recall that Columbus, on his third voyage, had
information from the Cape Verde Islands that "canoes had been found
which start from the coast of Guinea and navigate to the west with mer
chandise." The view that Mansa Muhammad's expeditions were a figment of Mansa
Musa's imagination, or that, if they really did take place, they altogether
failed to reach the Americas, has thus to overlook a great many bits of and
pieces of evidence to the contrary. This evidence has been largely set aside
by historians, one cannot help feeling, because of some inherent preconcep
tion about the inability of Africans to navigate at sea. . . Medieval Mali
was no mere outpost of the civilized world of those times: on the contrary,
it was in touch with the eastern world of Islam through many travelers and
learned men, and the eastern world of Islam was very familiar with the sea.
Traveling was very much in the spirit of West Africa, then as later; and if
by land, why not by sea as well? (56)
Professor Paul Radin wrote learnedly on the various Amerindian
cultures, but the rise and fall of the Maya utterly baffled him. His
bewilderment was expressed as follows:
Their culture seems to have arisen suddenly and to have disappeared in
as mysterious a fashion. ... As early as the year 100 B.C., the hiero
glyphic system had already been fully developed. . . . Where and when
this hieroglyphic system developed, of that we have not the remotest idea.
The earliest hieroglyphic date is found on a little statuette and it is not until
two hundred years later that we find monuments with inscriptions and
dates. Then, without warning or preparation, we find enormous mounds
with elaborate temples built upon them, public squares, stelae and altars. No
excavations have ever revealed to us any civilization of a simpler nature
from which this elaborate culture could possibly have been developed. (193,
pp. 76-77)



286 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Fifty years ago, Professor Leo Wiener of Harvard University pre
sented his solution to the riddle of the genesis of early American civili
zations. His major work was the three-volume Africa and the Discovery
of America (1920-1922), and this was followed by Mayan and Mexican
Origins (1926). Since Wiener's profound researches clearly showed
that the ancient cultures of x'Xmerica were of African origin, his books
were either denounced or ignored. One of his Harvard colleagues, Pro
fessor Herbert J. Spinden, wrote an essay on "The Prosaic vs. the Ro
mantic School in Anthropology" in which he discussed Wiener's ideas
as follows:
Professor Wiener solves the riddle of old American civilizations with an
Arabico-Mandingo lexicon and derives everything of importance in the
New World from the highly civilized coasts of Gambia and Sierra Leone.
From brightest Africa came the principal American food plants, the Mayan
calendar and the Mexican religion. . . . The full splendor of his disarticula
tion is demonstrated in several books. One, freshly off the press, has 1 10
colored plates, and 16 plates in black and white, a veritable monument to misguided enthusiasm. ... It may be added that Professor Wiener swarms
his Negroes across the Atlantic in no less than fifty voyages before Colum
bus (241).
Professor Leo Wiener's three-volume work on Africa and the discovery of America was amply documented, but he failed to get a fair
hearing. His auditors had already decided that Africans were a bunch
of benighted savages, a people who had never entered the stream of his
tory. In a finat-chapter of conclusions, Wiener gave us the gist of his
three volumes, in the following words:
The presence of Negroes with their trading masters in America before Columbus is proved by the representation of Negroes in American sculp
ture and design, by the occurrence of a black nation at Darien early in the
XVlth century, but more specifically, by Columbus' emphatic reference to
Negro traders from Guinea, who trafficked in a gold alloy, guanin, of pre
cisely the same composition and bearing the same name as frequently re
ferred to by early writers in Africa. . . .
There were several foci from which the Negro traders spread in the two Americas. The eastern part of South America, where the Caribs are men
tioned, seems to have been reached by them from the West Indies. Another
stream, possibly from the same focus, radiated to the north along roads
marked by the presence of mounds, and reached as far as Canada. The chief
cultural influence was exerted by a Negro colony in Mexico, most likely from Teotinhuacan and Tuxtla, who may have been instrumental in estab



ANCIENT AMERICA 287
lishing the City of Mexico. From here, their influence pervaded the neigh
boring tribes and ultimately, directly or indirectly, reached Peru. That the
Negro civilization was carried chiefly by the trader is proved not only by
Columbus' specific reference, but also by the presence of the African merchant, the tangoman as Tiangizman in Mexico, hence the Aztec Tiangiz
(market), and by the universality of the blue and white shell-money from
Canada to La Plata, and the use of shells in the Peru-Guatemala trade.
(272, Vol. Ill, p. 365)
The reader has probably seen pictures of the huge stone heads show
ing African facial features, which have been unearthed in Mexico fre
quently in the recent past. The first of these stone heads was reported
by J. M. Melgar in 1869. This cabeza colosal, as the Mexicans called it,
was half buried, but enough of it was visible so that observers noted its
Ethiopian features, and the presence of a headdress resembling a foot
ball helmet. The site of this ancient monument was in the wilds of
Veracruz, not far from the Gulf of Mexico. Early in 1938, Dr. Matthew W. Stirling, Director of the Bureau of American Ethnology, a
branch of the Smithsonian Institution, of Washington, D.C., visited
the forests of Veracruz and took a look at the colossal head. The an
cient relic was located near the village of Tres Zapotes, and after a pre
liminary survey, Dr. Stirling decided that the area looked promising as
a site for archaeological exploration. On returning to Washington, he
organized an expedition sponsored jointly by the Smithsonian Institu
tion and the National Geographic Society. This expedition later in the
same year proceeded to Tres Zapotes and began unearthing the great
stone head. It turned out to be a solid block of basalt, six feet high and
eighteen feet in circumference, with its base attached to a platform of
crudely hewn stone. A member of Stirling's staff noticed the African
features of the stone face and the cap on the head resembling the train
ing headgear of a pugilist, and gave the cabeza colosal the nickname Joe
Louis. In exploring the area around the site, the expedition found a
stone containing a date. After deciphering the inscription, which was
in the dot and bar notation similar to that in use among the ancient
Mayans of Yucatan, they were able to arrive at a date which in our cal
endar would be November 4, 291 B.C., the earliest date found in the
New World up to that time. In 1939, Dr. Stirling moved his party to the island of La Venta, near
the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, in the state of Tabasco. A stone head
had been reported at that location by a Tulane University expedition in
1925, but it had not been excavated. Stirling's group, looking for one



288 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
head, had the good fortune of finding five. One stone head had a circumference of twenty-two feet and an estimated weight of at least
twenty tons. All these relics closely resembled the cabeza colosal of Tres
Zapotes.
In 1946, Dr. Stirling organized another headhunting expedition.
This time, the site chosen was the San Lorenzo Plateau, in the south
eastern part of Veracruz. At this spot, five more of the giant stone
heads were uncovered. The prize find of the lot was a stone head of
about thirty tons in weight, with a mouth over three feet wide and eyes
measuring almost two feet across; and it was appropriately labeled El
Rey (the king).
In the spring of 1967, another party of archaeologists, led by Profes
sor Michael D. Coe of Yale University, enjoyed a successful season,
marked by rewarding finds, such as another huge basalt head with the
typical African facial features. A reproduction of this particular stone
head was featured on the cover of Science Digest for September, 1967.
These relics, dug up by the expeditions led by Stirling and Coe, were
all remains of the ancient Olmec culture. This early American civiliza
tion flourished in the states of Veracruz, Tabasco, and Chiapas, and
seems to have been the chief source of the later Maya, Aztec, Toltec,
and Zapotec cultures. There was an interesting and instructive article
in Science Digest, from which we quote the following passage:
The first Olmec artifact to attract archaeologists turned up in a plowed field in 1902 not far from the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico.
Sculpted in pale green jadette was a beautifully carved, fat, bald-headed In
dian priest about eight inches high. Undecipherable glyphs were incised on its stomach. Also on its stomach was a Mayan date. The date corresponded to 98 B.C., well before any known Maya civilization and in the wrong area of Mexico for Maya.
The long-count calendar, attributable at that time to the Maya, is a more
accurate calendar than the one we use today. It begins, for unknown reasons, in the year 3113 B.C. Closely correlated to astronomical observations, it can be read precisely for any day and year in the intermediate period and
transcribed into a date in terms of our calendar. It is a masterpiece of mathematical and astronomical knowledge, and it was the Olmecs, not the Maya, who developed it. [The Olmecs are sometimes called the People of the Jaguar, because in their numerous works of art, the jaguar motif is
prominent, and it is believed that the jaguar was an object of worship by the Olmecs.] (204, pp. 8-9)
The American scholar, William H. Prescott, when writing his
histories of the conquests of Mexico and Peru, speculated on the origin



ANCIENT AMERICA 289
of early American cultures. He had heard about the Olmecs, but con
sidered them as mythical. The pyramids of Teotihaucan were very an
cient, surmised Prescott, and he asked: "Who were the builders? Were
they the mythical Olmecs, whose history is lost in the mists of legend
and fable, or the peace loving and industrious Toltecs, about whom we
have scarcely more definite information? What happened to the tribes
that built them?" The pioneer Americanist, Professor Augustus Le
Plongeon, who studied Mayan ruins in Yucatan, published his Maya
Archaeology in 1885. In this work he recorded the tradition of an an
cient Olmec culture, which had preceded that of the Toltecs, and the
belief that these ancient people had come from the east in ships in order
to settle in the New World. Had LePlongeon had an open mind, he might have concluded that the Olmecs had come from Africa; but to
him, this would have been unthinkable; so he, of course, traced them
back to the lost continent of Atlantis.
The Olmec culture seems to have come to a sudden end about the
year 600 of our era. How this came about has been explained as fol
lows:
Judging by the conditions found by the archaeologists, it would appear
that at that time, the flatnosed people were destroyed by an alien race who
not only wiped out the others but devoted an enormous amount of time and
energy to defacing and destroying their idols, stonework, monuments and
anything else they could do away with. It would seem probable these in
vaders were from Palenque, for in the Temple of the Jaguars, there is a stucco panel showing the same type of figure wearing the Phrygian cap ex
actly like that shown on the pottery portrait head from San Lorenzo. A
similar portrait appears on a ceremonial axe of Totonac origin. Also the
dates agree. Dr. Stirling places the end of the flatnosed people's culture as
about 600 A.D. and archaeologists have dated the Palenque remains as
about 600 A.D. also. Whatever the truth may be, there is no question that the most ancient of
the Mexican higher cultures was that of the fat-faced, thick-lipped, flat
nosed people of the La Venta area in the State of Tabasco. (257, p. 100)
The African influence in ancient America is even now denied by
many, but the evidence is quite clear. This is supported by the fol
lowing remarks by a well-known explorer:
Hitherto, ethnologists imagined that Negroes appeared in the New World only during our own epoch, when they were imported as slaves; but the most recent researches demonstrate that they first came to America in a



290 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
period very remote. . . . I have seen a statuette of a Negro in the archaeological collection of Mr. Ernesto Franco in Quito (Ecuador): according to
the opinion of local archaeologists, this statuette is at least 20,000 years old. The autochthonous black races in America were either gradually mixed with the Indian ones, or became extinct, but in a very remote time, Negroes or Negroids were numerous in the New World. (14, p. 40)
Columbus has been called the discoverer of America, but he himself
made no such claim. In the words of a recent investigator:
Proof of this is evidenced by the fact that Columbus was informed by some men, when he stopped at the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Af
rica, that Negroes had been known to set out into the Atlantic from the Guinea coast in canoes loaded with merchandise and steering toward the west. The same Christopher Columbus was further informed by the Indians of Hispaniola when he arrived in the West Indies that they had been
able to obtain gold from black men who had come from across the sea from the south and southeast. ... It must also be added that Amerigo Vespucci, on his voyage to the Americas, witnessed these same black men out in the
Atlantic returning to Africa. (142, p. 6)
In an earlier chapter, we referred to the four compass gods of the an
cient Egyptians. They were depicted as follows: Amset, who was Human-Headed; Hapi, who was Ape-Headed; Tuamutef who was Jackal-Headed; Gebhsennuf, who was Hawk-Headed.
These deities were also connected with certain utensils known as
Canopic Jars. For an explanation of this connection, we refer to Every
man's Dictionary of Non-Classical Mythology. Under the heading
"Canopic Jars," we read:
In the process of embalming as practiced in Egypt, the intestines and other internal organs were removed, cleaned, wrapped in linen with pow
dered spices, etc., and placed in jars called Canopic Jars. The name is said to have arisen from the old legend whereby Canopus, the pilot of Menelaus, was buried at Canopus, and there worshiped in the shape of a jar with small
feet, thin neck, swollen body and a round back. As far back as the sixth dy
nasty, these jars were dedicated to the four cardinal points, and from about the seventeenth dynasty they bore the heads of the sons of Horus (or of Osiris): Amset, Hapi, Duamutef, and Qebhsneuf, who also became gods of
the cardinal points, protecting the liver, lungs, stomach, and intestines respectively. Traces of a similar custom have been observed in America. For
details see Bacabs.
In the same dictionary, we read that the Bacabs were: "The Canopic gods of the Mayas, who were also the supporters of



ANCIENT AMERICA 291
the four corners of the earth. Their names, their cardinal points, and
their symbolic colors were as follows: Mulac, north, white; Cauac,
south, red; Kan, east, yellow; lx, west, black." (242)
In discussing the ancient Mayan religious rites, Professor Paul Radin
wrote: "The earth was held in place by four deities, the four cardinal
points. With each cardinal point was associated a definite color. It is
difficult to overestimate the significance of these deities. Indian ceremo
nialism is almost unthinkable without them." (193, p. 66) An almost
identical symbolic complex existed among the Aztecs, where the com
pass-point gods were called the four Sky-bearers. The following accu
rate description we owe to Lewis Spence:
The Mexicans divided the universe into 4 regions, governed by 4 gods,
who were supposed to uphold the skies at the 4 directions of the compass.
These compass directions were associated with various colors, red, white,
black, yellow. . . . These sky bearers were supposed to be spirits or gods of
the stars. . . .
They were usually symbolized by insects, particularly scorpions, spiders
and bees. They were also associated with the only 4 days on which the cal
endar could begin, Acatl, Tecpatl, Calli and Tochtli. (237, p. 48)
An American archaeologist, Professor J. Eric Thompson, wrote a
scholarly essay, "Sky Bearers, Colors, and Directions in Maya and
Mexican Religions." For comparison he listed the Mayan and Mexican
compass gods, and the two lists are reproduced below:
Names Colors Directions
MAYA Kan Red East
Muluc White North lx Black West Cauac Yellow South MEXICAN Acatl Red? East Tecpatl White North Calli Black? West Tochtli Yellow South
The divinities are described as: "Gods who bore the weight of the
heavens and were at the same time associated with world directions,
and by extension, with their respective colors, are known to have
played an important role in Maya and Mexican religious belief and cer
emony." (246, p. 211)

Professor Thompson, alluding to the similarities listed above, con
cluded: 'in many cases, if not most cases, I believe the ideas were
passed on to both Maya and Mexicans from a mutual cultural ances
tor." (246, p. 240) The mutual cultural ancestor was not named by
Professor J. Eric Thompson. Professor Leo Wiener, on the other hand,
felt certain that the mutual cultural ancestor could be traced back to
Africa. Wiener contended that groups of nine gods were frequently
mentioned in the Pyramid Texts of ancient Egypt, and refers the
reader to Sir Wallis Budge's Gods of the Egyptians. (32, Vol. I, p. 85
fT.) He then noted: "In America, we have the same Nine Lords of the
Night frequently recorded in Mexico." (273, p. 130) According to
Professor Wiener, the nine Lords of the Night were known to the
Mossi of the Western Sudan, who presumably had a hand in transmit
ting the information to the New World. "The 9 Lords of the Night,"
we are further informed, "led to the 13 Lords of the Day, which either
represented the 1 3 hours of the day, the 1 3 heavens or, possibly, the 1
months." (273, p. 130) The Sky Bearers of Ancient America, Dr. Churchward thought,
could be traced back to the four sons of Horus of the ancient Egyptian
Pantheon. He found the same symbolism in the western Sudan. "The
people of Bavili, Bini, and Yorba, West Africa, have the same under
the names of (1) Ibara, (2) Edi, (3) Oyekun, (4) Oz-Be, and build
these names, with Ifi, the Son of God—i.e. Horus—into the walls of
their houses." (48, p. 320)
Gerald Massey, in the first volume of The Natural Genesis, has a
chapter on the Typology of the Four Quarters, and he traces this sym
bolism from Egypt to all parts of the Old and New Worlds. Massey, in
his day, was regarded as something of a visionary. Today, we have
scholars adopting his ideas, even though most of them never took the
trouble to read any of his works. As this is being written, we have be
fore us a book entitled Lord of the Four Quarters by John Weir Perry,
Professor of Psychiatry at the University of California, and Lecturer at
the C. G. Jung Institute. According to the publisher of Professor Per
ry's book: "These givers of life, in their simultaneous sacred and
human forms, were a universal experience of the archaic world. Here a
Jungian psychiatrist traces their appearance throughout legend from



294 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
the Nile to the New World, revealing the source of Jung's racial arche
type, which survives in the psyche of contemporary man." Starting
with the four sons of Horus in Egypt, Massey showed that the symbols
of these sky gods in Egypt were: (1) Man, (2) Ape, (3) Jackal, (4) Hawk.
In the Biblical Book of Ezekiel, Chapter I, we read of the four Faces
of the Celestial Beasts, which were: (1) Man, (2) Lion, (3) Ox, (4)
Eagle.
In the Book of Revelations of St. John, Chapter IV, Verse 7, the
symbolism of the four quarter signs of Zodiac were pictured as follows:
(1) Lion, (2) Calf, (3) Man, (4) Bird.
Traveling on to India, we have a similar symbolism, where the Lords
of the four quarters are represented by the following zootypes: (1)
Cow, (2) Ape, (3) Eagle, (4) Serpent.
Massey pointed out: "These four are universal. They belong to the
first circle that was quartered according to the cardinal points." (168,
Vol. I, p. 407)
In the Hindu mythology, we read of Mount Meru, situated at the
North Pole. This mythical mountain had four sides, each of a different
color, and each color was coupled with a point of the compass, as fol
lows: East—White, South—Yellow, West—Black, North—Red.
Massey connects the colors of the four faces of Mount Meru with
the mythology of the Ages of Metals. The ages and the corresponding
colors are: Golden Age—Yellow, Silver Age—White, Copper or
Brass Age—Red, Iron Age—Black. (See 168, Vol. I, p. 412.)
The zodiac, which we have discussed in an earlier chapter, seems to
have begun with the four quarter constellations and their principal
stars, and later was expanded from four signs to twelve. The four origi
nal signs and their stars were:
Stars Constellations
Corleonis IjCO
Antares Scorpio
Formalhaut Aquarius
Aldebaran Taurus
(For additional data, the reader might consult Massey's The Natural
Genesis, Vol. II, p. 207, and Creation Records Discovered in Egypt, pp.
136-39, by George St. Clair [219].)

Dupuis and Volney traced the earliest system of astronomy back to
the ancient Ethiopians. Massey thought Egypt a more likely source;
but there seems to be no doubt of the common origin of all the ancient
systems. In the words of Gerald Massey: "No serious student of the
subject can doubt that the Arabic, Chaldean, Hindu, Chinese and
Greek systems of ancient astronomy were derived from a common
source. Egypt alone is known to be old enough to account for that unity
of origin; and the chief types constellated in the heavens are of Egyp
tian origin and belong to the Kamite- mythology." (168, Vol. II, p.
214)
Among the ancient Chinese, the four spirits of the four quarters
were: (1) Black Warrior—North, (2) White Tiger—West, (3) Red
Bird—South, (4) Blue Dragon—East. (See 168, Vol. I, p. 410.)
Lord Raglan, in an anthropological study of great merit, The Temple
and the House, has a chapter on the four quarters, wherein the fol
lowing opinions were expressed: "The legendary emperors of China
were said to have controlled the four quarters of heaven. They were
sometimes paired with four spirits, symbolized by the White Tiger of
the West, the Green Dragon of the East, the Red Bird of the South, and
the Dark Warrior of the North." (197, p. 163)
We must now say something about the strange calendar systems of
Ancient America, for they, too, display a kinship with similar com
plexes in the Old World. The ancient Maya devised a very accurate
calendar, and their mode of time measurement was passed on to the Za
potecs and Aztecs, where it survived in a somewhat simplified form.
The Mayan calendar, like that of the Aztecs of Mexico and the Incas of
Peru, was originally a moon calendar; that is to say, it was based on the
lunar year. Beginning with a lunar year of 12 months, each of 30 days'
duration, the Mayan astronomers later introduced a sacred calendar
called the Tzolkin, which was made up of 1 3 months, each consisting
of 20 days, making a total of 260 days for the year. The Tzolkin Cal
endar, the Tonalamatl of the Aztecs, was made up of a series of 20-day
signs, combined with the numbers 1 to 13, inclusive. The two series in
terlocked like two wheels, one with 13 cogs, the other with 20. The
smaller number wheel made 20 revolutions, while the larger day wheel
made 13 revolutions; after which the number-cog and the name-cog
were again lined up the same as at the start of the operation. Thus a
day bearing the same name and the same number would recur after
13 x 20, or 260 days. This lunar calendar was called by the Aztecs the



296 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Tonalamatl, or the Book of the Good and Bad Days. A copy of this calendar, as reconstructed by Lewis Spence, is given below:
Number Name Sign Presiding God
Tonacatecutli
Quetzalcoatl
Tepeyollotl Ueuecoyotl
Chalchihuitlicue
Teciztecatl
Tlaloc Mayauel Xiuhtecutli
Mictlantecutli
Xochipilli
Patecatl Tezcatlipoca
Tlazolteotl Xipe
Itzpaplotl
Xolotl Tezcatlipoca
Chantico Xochiquetzal
We gladly let Lewis Spence explain the high points of this ancient
calendar. The outlandish names are for the most part unpronounceable
in the English language, but let us pay attention to Spence and we can
not fail to get the gist of the tonalamatl:
It will be seen from this list that the fourteenth day-sign takes the number 1 again. Under this arrangement, each day-sign has a number which does not recur in connection with that sign again for a space of 260 days, so that each day-sign, if taken along with its number, has reference to a sepa
rate day in the calendar. Thus the first day, Cipactli, is in its first occurrence
/ Cipactli; in its second, 8 Cipactli; in its third, 2 Cipactli; in its fourth, 9 Ci
pactli; and so forth. No day in the tonalamatl was described merely as Cipactli, Coatl, or Calli, its name being incomplete without the number in the sequence, just as we would not say Thursday in October instead of Thursday the 7th of October, or Thursday, the 28th of October. It was called ce
cipactli, one crocodile, or ome coatl, two snake, as the case might be.
Each of the 20 tonalamatl divisions or weeks of 1 3 days each, as they are wrongly but usefully called, had also a presiding god of its own. (237, pp. 35-36)

2 Eecatl Wind
3 Calli House

2 Quauhtli Eagle 3 Cozcaquauhtli Vulture 4 Ollin Motion 5 Tecpatl Flint-Knife
6 Quiauitl Rain
7 Xochitl Flower



ANCIENT AMERICA 297
The Maya devised another calendar, called the Haab, which con
sisted of 18 months, each of 20 days, giving a total of 360 days. To this
was added 5 days, called Uayeb, which corrected the year to 365 days.
Silverberg has noted: "The actual year is about 365 days, 6 hours long,
and the Mayas, aware of this, periodically adjusted the calendar to ac
count for this, just as we do with leap years. But the Maya calendar was
even more precise than ours, by a matter of some seconds a year."
(228, pp. 120-21) The Aztecs of Mexico adopted the improved Mayan solar calendar,
and merged it with their tonalamatl. In other words, their calendar was
a combination of both the Tzolkin and the Haab. For an explanation of
how this was done, we again turn to Lewis Spence:
Now this tonalamatl, or moon calendar naturally lost its significance as a
time count when a solar calendar was adopted. . . . But instead of adopting
the solar calendar and casting the old moon calendar aside, the Mexicans
combined both, the tonalamatl contributing the names of the days and the
solar calendar the divisions or months of the year, in which the days found
positions. The two calendars thus ran side by side, each recommencing
whenever it reached its own limits. ... A specific year was known by the
tonalamatl sign with which it began. As there were 20 day signs, and as 5
(the least common multiple of 365 and 20) goes into 20 exactly 4 times, the
year could begin with one of four signs only. These were Acatl, Tecpatl,
Calli and Tochtli. (237, p. 36)
This combination lunar and solar calendar was called the Calendar
Round. To us it seems cumbersome, but it certainly was ingenious, for it worked smoothly. The day-numbers associated with the day-names making up the ritual year were capable of running a gamut of 13
changes; and, as a result, a particular day with a particular number can
occupy a particular month position only in every 13 X 4 or 52 years;
which comes to a total of 18,980 days. We learn from Professor Radin:
"This period the Mayas called the Calendar-Round, and it is of vast im
portance both among the Maya and the Aztecs in connection with
their astronomy and their whole ceremonial life." (193, p. 74) The Mayan astronomers were not satisfied with the Tzolkin, the
Haab, and the Calendar-Round; for they also constructed a Venus Cal
endar. This calendar, based on the phases of the planet Venus, was a
triumph of human ingenuity. The planet Venus has a year of 584 days,
and the four phases of the same were Morning Star (236 days), Supe
rior Conjunction (90 days), Evening Star (250 days), and Inferior



298 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Conjunction (90 days). The equivalence in length of eight solar years
of 365 days each, and of five Venus years of 584 days each was recog
nized and accurately calculated; and we have good reason to believe
that a discrepancy of eight hundredths (0.08) of a day between the
mean Venus year and the true Venus year was corrected by a marginal
subtraction of two days after a period of 25 revolutions of that planet.
The Zapotecs utilized a ritual calendar of 260 days, which was prob
ably derived from the Maya. In addition, they tied it in with the astral
symbolism of the sky gods of the compass directions. As Radin ob
served: "In one of the old codices, they are represented as follows: The
first, the east, is a figure wearing as a helmet-mask an alligator's head;
he is a good and fruitful deity. The second, the north, has as his mask a
death's head; he signifies drought and death. The third, the west, wears
the head of an unknown animal. The fourth figure, the south, wears
the vulture's head. There is a fifth figure representing the center. His
colors are those of the gods of the night-heaven and twilight and the
symbols accompanying him refer to war." (193, p. 158) The ancient Maya seemed to have a profound knowledge of mathe
matics, and if their culture was an offshoot of the early Olmecs, then
we are led to look to Africa as a source of this knowledge. Professor
Wiener did just this, and his labors were not fruitless. For he has in
formed us: "We get a good insight into Mayan mathematics by
studying the corresponding numeration in Guinea." (273, p. 144) Pro
fessor Wiener gives us an insight into this by an examination of the
number system of the Bambaras of Guinea, in West Africa, relating it
to the Maya system, as follows:
It is obvious that in the vigesimal count they called 5 a heap, and 4 heaps
became the complete count, hence when the Mayas took over the Negro
numeration, tu was used for both 5 and 20. Indeed, we have the Maya hut,
complete, all, hence there can be little doubt that Maya hotuy 5, was originally the first complete heap, hence 5, and this produced ho, 5. From Ho-tu
baq, 500, it is clear that tu also meant 20, that is the complete heap, and here
we can show that the Mexicans got their numeration, as regard the larger numbers, entirely from the Mandingos, and bequeathed it to the Mayas.
(273, p. 145)
Students of Amerindian mythology are familiar with a black god of
merchants. Professor Wiener, in studying the Codex Peresianus,
traced this deity back to his African source. "Here we have," he con
cluded, "the complete story of the Negro who crossed the ocean as a



ANCIENT AMERICA 299
merchant and brought the art of extracting pulque from the agave plant
and distilling it on fire, and became the god of the travelling merchants
and was ultimately merged with Cak." (273, p. 105)
We are not trying to show that the ancient cultures of the New
World were entirely of African origin. There were other influences;
and we shall take due notice of them. In the customs, traditions, and
myths of ancient America we constantly meet with parallels that are so
alike that they cannot be due to coincidence or chance. Mummification
was widely practiced in ancient Mexico and Peru; and, according to
Sir Grafton Elliot Smith, this making of mummies possessed Egyptian
elements of associated ritual, such as the use of incense and libations,
and accompanying beliefs concerning the wanderings of the soul in the
underworld. Along with these we have corroborative details indicating
the influence of Ethiopia, Babylonia, India, Indonesia, China, Japan,
and Oceania on the various features of the process as practiced in the New World.
The Aztecs of old related a myth of a war in heaven, in which the
rebel angels met with defeat. They also held that the first man was
made of clay, and that the earliest woman was fashioned from a bone of
the first man. The Aztec Eve was pictured on the ancient Mexican
monuments as conversing with a big male serpent, who was, of course,
the old Devil in disguise. These same people had a tradition of the uni
versal Deluge. "There were giants in the earth in those days." (Gene
sis, VI, 4) And the Mexican Noah was one of them. He and six other
giants built an ark, which enabled them to survive a great flood. After
the waters had subsided, birds were sent out to search for dry land, and
the ark landed on a mountain peak. One of the giants present in the ark
was Xelhua the Architect who, in later days, planned a pyramid tall
enough to reach up to the very windows of heaven. As the work on
this edifice got under way and the structure approached the clouds, the
gods became angry and hurled fire down on the pyramid, toppling it
over and killing many of the workmen. The work could nor be re
sumed, because the gods caused each family engaging in the enterprise
to start speaking a strange new language, which the other could in no
way comprehend. The ruins of this pyramid at Cholula were shown to
Baron von Humboldt when that celebrated explorer visited Mexico,
and are described by him in his American Researches. The Aztecs also
believed in the doctrine of the Trinity; and the members of this triad
were (1) Yzona, the Father, (2) Bacab, the Son, and (3) Echiah, the



300 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
Holy Ghost. Bacab, or Quetzalcoatl, was the Aztec Christ, and he was
born of the Virgin Sochiquetzal. Like the Christian Savior, he was
tempted, and fasted for forty days. He was also a crucified savior, for
he is shown in the Borgian MS as on a cross with nail marks on his
hands and feet. After the crucifixion, he arose from the dead, after de
scending into hell for a period of three days and three nights. He was
represented as a man of black complexion; and thus falls into line with
other black savior gods, such as Osiris, Horus, Krishna, and Jesus
Christ. The Mexicans were expecting the Second Advent of Quetzal
coatl when the Spaniards invaded the country in the sixteenth century.
In 1894, Sir Edward B. Tylor, pioneer English anthropologist, ad
dressed a remarkable communication to the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, the title of which was "On the Diffusion of
Mythical Beliefs as Evidence of the History of Culture." The close
parallels between certain religious ideas common to the Mexican Az
tecs and the Chinese Buddhists are shown in the following extracts
from the pen of Professor Tylor
In the religion of Old Mexico, four great scenes in the journey of the
soul in the land of the dead are mentioned by early Spanish writers after the
conquest, and are depicted in a group in the Aztec picture writing known
as the Vatican Codex. The four scenes are first, the crossing of a river; sec
ond, the fearful passage of the soul between the two mountains which clash
together; third, the soul's climbing up the mountain set with sharp obsidian
knives; fourth, the dangers of the wind carrying such knives in its blast.
The Mexican ^pictures of these four scenes were compared with more or
less closely corresponding pictures representing scenes from the Buddhist
hells or purgatories as depicted on Japanese temple scrolls. Here, first, the
river of death is shown, where the souls wade across; second, the souls have
to pass between two huge iron mountains, which are pushed together by
two demons; third, the guilty souls climb the mountain of knives, whose
blades cut their hands and feet; fourth, fierce blasts of wind drive against
their lacerated forms, the blades of knives flying through the air. It was ar
gued that the appearance of analogues so close and complex of Buddhist ideas in Mexico constituted a correspondence of so high an order as to pre
clude any explanation except direct transmission from one religion to an
other.
It has been urged by certain anthropologists of the evolutionary
school that no direct contact between Chinese Buddhism and the reli
gion of ancient Mexico can be demonstrated; nor is it necessary to as
sume such contact to explain the close similarities in these beliefs. This



ANCIENT AMERICA 301
school of thought holds that, since both the Amerindians and the Chinese are Mongoloids, they both possess a Mongol type of mind, and
thus tend to think in a similar manner. This contention is quite absurd,
being refuted by the cold hard facts of the case; for we know that the
Chinese got many of these ideas from India, and the Indians were not
Mongoloids.



CHAPT E R E I G H T E E
The Evolution of Civilization:
Summary and Conclusions
MANY readers of this chapter will find it difficult, or perhaps even im
possible, to give assent to some of its implications and conclusions. This
is understandable, since nearly all the so-called world histories and
histories of civilization, so .popular in contemporary academic circles,
are based mainly on what is known as European civilization. This spe
cies of parochialism gives a false picture of human history; and few stu
dents become aware of the fact that European civilization, speaking his
torically, is a product of the recent past, and that European culture was
not indigenous, but was derived from the older civilizations of Africa
and Asia. Th^ Western World takes great pride in its accomplish
ments in the .ields of technology and science, and conveniently forgets
that Christian-Europe wallowed in the savagery of the Dark Ages until
the arts and sciences of the Moors were introduced into that backward
land, mainly by Jewish scholars, merchants, and physicians. A group of
Jewish scholars settled in England under the protection of William of
Normandy, and established a school of science at Oxford; and it was at
this school that Roger Bacon learned the Arabic language and studied
Moorish science. As Dr. Robert Briffault has stated: "The medical
school of Montpellier was founded on the pattern of that of Cordova
under Jewish doctors. The example was imitated at Padua, and later at
Pisa, where together with the Canons of Avicenna (Ibn Sina), and the
Surgery of Abul-Kasim, which until the seventeenth century remained
the textbooks of medical science throughout Europe, were taught the
mathematics and astronomy of the Moors. Those were the nurseries
which were one day to bring forth Fallopius, Vesalius, Cardan, Har
vey, Galileo." (20, p. 152)
302



SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 303
The first civilized Europeans were the Greeks, who were largely
civilized by the Egyptians, who were Africans. The Romans absorbed
some of the Greek culture, and then lost it at the onset of the Dark
Ages. The recivilization of Europe was brought about mainly by the
Moors, also a people of African origin. The Robber Barons of Europe
were clever enough to adopt the new civilization and use it for taking
over the world. They invaded the New World, destroyed its cultures,
enslaved and murdered its peoples, and opened up new lands (stolen
from the inoffensive owners thereof), and then appropriated the natural
resources of these new lands for the beriefit of the predatory ruling
classes of Europe. New territories were opened up to the hungry peo
ples of Europe, and helpless Africans were kidnapped into slavery so as
to form a servile labor force for the enrichment of the bandits of Eu
rope. The rulers of Europe sent out their emissaries, who stole entire
continents, appropriated the land, and slaughtered and reduced to
bondage the helpless dwellers of those unhappy lands. Due to their pri
ority in the Industrial Revolution, the Europeans for a while dominated
the world; but a series of revolutions and wars finally led to a decline of
this European supremacy. The French Revolution resulted in an up
surge of the spirit of nationalism that led to the Napoleonic Wars, and
ultimately turned Europe into an armed camp. World War I in 1914
was a turning point; for the Europeans had formed a habit of murder
ing, robbing, and oppressing the downtrodden colonials of Africa, Asia,
and the Americas; but now they turned on each other. Europeans slew
each other by the millions and then drafted the so-called inferior races
to help them murder their own blood brothers. This carnage brought
on the Russian Revolution, which established Communism as a force to
be reckoned with. A world-wide economic depression prepared the
ground for a second world war. The so-called democracies of Europe
and America decided to pit the Nazism of Hitler against the Commu
nism of Stalin. Hitler refused to cooperate, so the so-called free world
had to destroy Hitler and, at the same time, they were forced to aid
and abet Stalinism. World War I brought on a Communist Revolu
tion; World War II not only helped to consolidate this totalitarianism,
but established it on a solid foundation in China. The Europeans are
trying to hang on to what is left of their days of greatness, but the age
of European dominance in the world is on the decline and there is no
sign that this trend will ever be reversed.
The one good thing the Europeans did was to cultivate the study of



304 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
the sciences after they had been indoctrinated by the Moors. European
science was almost strangled in its cradle, for both church and state
were hostile to it; but the invention of the printing press saved the day
for science. Knowledge could now be diffused so widely and with such
great facility that no effective censorship was possible. Modern science
survived the Inquisition, the Wars of Religion, and the epidemic of
witchcraft, and reached its majority in the Age of the Enlightenment,
toward the end of the eighteenth century. At that time, the transition
from the medieval to the modern world was completed. The role of the
French thinkers of the Age of Reason in that transition has been admi
rably presented by Briffault:
The French 1 8th century is one of the grand climacterics of the history
of human growth. All the seeds which had been germinating in Europe
since the twelfth century ripened then into fruit; a new era began, in its
significance one of the epochs of most concentrated glory in the evolution
of the race. ... As in seventeenth century England, science expanded in
eighteenth century France, widely and eagerly cultivated, popularized in
crowded lecture rooms and was there shaped for the first time into that or
ganized body of knowledge and systematized enquiry which was to bear
immediate fruit in the conquests of the nineteenth century. ... It was by
those men, Bayle, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Diderot, D'Alembert, Volney,
Holbach, Condorcet, and their contemporaries who cast aside all conven
tional formulas, resolved to think for themselves, and what is more, to speak
out boldly what they thought, to own no other sanction or criterion than
rational thought, that the world has been transformed. Behind them and
around them stood medievalism in all its ignorance and darkness and tyr
anny over life and mind, . . . after them is a changed world, the modern
world. It was those men who threw open the portals from the one into the
other. (20, pp. 224-25)
Writers of textbooks on the history of civilization usually begin their
accounts with either Egypt or Babylonia, and dismiss all traditions of
earlier cultures as idle speculations. Many very able students of ancient
affairs have dissented, and we think they have a case worth presenting.
As an example, we cite Lloyd P. Smith, an American scholar of the last
century.
Thus alike on the starlit plains of Chaldea [Mr. Smith noted], and in the
rainless atmosphere of Egypt, astronomy for ages became the one great oc
cupation of the learned; and such was their progress in it, that they ascer
tained the length of the year with nearly as much accuracy as we know it



SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 305
ourselves. Even the precession of the equinoxes was to the Egyptian priests
a familiar fact. . . . The great pyramid of Cheops was built on lines ascer
tained by astronomical observations. It faces the four cardinal points, and
the tunnel which pierces its Northern slope is in reality a telescope forever
turned to that point of the heavens touched by the polar star at its lowest
declination. A crystal lens has lately been discovered on the site of Nine
veh, and Godfrey Higgins claims that even the telescope itself was known
to a very few of the Egyptian priests, and kept by them in private for the
use of those only who were initiated in the higher mysteries. (235, pp. 8-9)
Canon Rawlinson, in his famous Ancient Monarchies, stated: "There
is said to be distinct evidence that they (the ancient Mesopotamians)
observed the four satellites of Jupiter, and strong reason to believe that
they were acquainted likewise with the seven satellites of Saturn."
(200, Vol. II, p. 577)
The Italian astronomer, Eugene Antoniadi (1870-1924), held that
the priests of ancient Egypt possessed a secret scientific tradition which
was known only to the initiates of the mysteries, and since this knowl
edge was never published, the common people were ignorant of it.
Professor A. C. D. Crommelin (1865-1935), an English astronomer,
was of the opinion that the stars were first grouped into constellations
by the Egyptians about 4000 B.C. However, the contemporary French
astronomer, Pierre Rousseau, argues that this date is far too late. "In
fact," Rousseau observed, "the origin of the constellations is lost in the
mists of time. We find them among the Chinese and among the Su
merians, among the Egyptians and among the Incas, and it is notewor
thy that certain figures are the same everywhere. The Bear and the
giant Orion are recognized on the banks of the Nile as on those of the
Yellow River, so it is possible that this celestial typography sprang from
a common fund of knowledge, to which every people made its contri
bution." (215, p. 29) Rousseau's contentions seem to be confirmed by Or. Giorgio de
Santillana, Professor of the History and Philosophy of Science, in the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We are informed by De San
tillana:
We are indebted to Leo Frobenius and the German Historical school for
the theory of culture circles, . . . and if justice will be done, eventually to
the achievements of W. H. R. Rivers and the British School of DirTusion
ists. The point is this: that what we observe as primitive conditions are,
with very few exceptions . . . only what is left of the rise and fall of past



306 MAN, GOD, AND CIVILIZATION
higher cultures; what appeared to be a universal steady state of superstitions from which thought grows is only the common denominator to which
decaying civilizations run in the end. . . .
Once the possibility had been revived of a universal history of culture,
the road was opened to promising rediscoveries and new adventures: we are
able not only to put to good use the labors of great nineteenth-century
scholars like Boeckh, Ideler, Brugsch, and such of their eighteenth-century
forerunners as Charles Dupuis, but to recognize that only when fitted into
this rediscovered old-fashioned historical frame, could the amount of new
data presented to us by Thureau-Dangin, Kugler, Boll, and Seler be inter
preted and evaluated in a reasonable way. Thus the work of L. de Saussure
and Laufer, of Eisler and Gundel, after due critical revision, yield now re
turns beyond expectation. It is to be hoped that work in progress by Wer
ner, Stecchini and von Dechend will bring further light in this far reaching
enterprise. . . .
We have the Sumerian names of constellations and planets, surviving in
Babylonian cuneiform tablets, but we have reason to think that they were
inherited from unknown predecessors. As concerns the Egyptian names of
constellations, it is evident from the most ancient star lists that they were,
already then, no longer grasped in their original significance. So we con
clude that what looked to us like a point of departure is only a phase in a
line of thought which stretches back into the dim regions of predynastic
origins everywhere. But the extraordinary wealth of rites, tales, and tradi
tions found more or less uniformly around the world, in certain distinct
parts of Africa, in China, Polynesia, and Mexico, points to a time of great
migrations, and also to a center of diffusion . . . in the far back millinaries
where archaeological excavation yields only uncertain clues. We are, in
fact, beginning to understand that the vast protohistoric material of myths
and legends of gods and heroes founding cities, bringing culture, undertak
ing great voyages . . . can be deciphered as the technical language of the
yet unknown archaic astronomers who are also responsible for the naming
of the constellations. Surely, it implies a conscious intention, not mere idle
fancy, to read those figures out of the confusion of stars. Someone before
history must have blocked them out for reasons known to himself, and with
such an authority that they were repeated without question, substantially
the same from Mexico to Africa and Polynesia—and have remained with us
to this day. (220, pp. 10-13)
Ancient men may have had a far wider knowledge of mathematics than we have up to now credited them with. Dr. Alexander Thorn,
Professor of Engineering Science at Oxford University, studied the re
mains of hundreds of ancient stone temples, and found that four thou
sand years ago the ancient temple-builders utilized an accurate unit of

length of 2.72 feer. All students familiar with higher mathematics are
aware of the fact that the transcendental number e (Epsilon), which is
the base of the natural system of logarithms, is approximately equal to 2.71828. Reduced to two decimal places, this becomes 2.72. This num
ber is important not only in higher mathematics, but also in the bank
ing business. Let us assume that we deposit one dollar in a bank and that the banker pays us 100 percent interest, and allows an infinite
number of interest periods annually. Under these conditions at the end
of one year the dollar would earn $1.72 in interest, so that the principal
($1) plus interest ($1.72) would come to $2.72. How did the ancient
temple-builders compute this number? We can only guess, for no record of how this discovery was made has come down the stream of his
tory to us.
The Ethiopian origin of the culture of ancient Egypt is now clear to
all students not blinded by anti-African racist obsessions. This was
clearly shown by Gerald Massey in his great work, Ancient Egypt:
"The Egyptian record when correctly read will tell us plainly that the
human birthplace was a land of the papyrus reed, the crocodile, and
hippopotamus, a land of great lakes in Karua, the Koloe of Ptolemy,
. . . that is in Equatoria, from whence the sacred river ran to brim the
valley of the Nile with plenty. The track of civilization with cities
springing in its footprints is seaward from the south, not upward from Lower Egypt, which was a swamp when Upper Egypt was already the African home of civilization. The Egyptian always gave priority to the
south over the delta in the north." (163, Vol. 1, p. 255)
Massey's conclusions have been confirmed by the researches of such able scholars as Harold P. Cooke, of Cambridge, who noted:
The worship and rites of Osiris may have passed into Egypt, I think,
from the neighboring state of Ethiopia. . . . Herodotus says in his history, that following the Nile to the South, you will come to a great city, Meroe.
. . . The people there have but two gods—that is Zeus and Dionysus or
Bacchus. . . . Now Zeus must be Amen or Amun. Dionysus is no doubt Osiris. These statements, if true, are significant. This singular paucity of
gods, may well argue an older tradition than any that Egypt could boast of.
(52)
A later student of the early history of mankind has made some saga
cious remarks on the culture of ancient Egypt, which we are pleased to
cite:
Until comparatively recently the classical view has been that the civilization of Egypt arose in the Delta, whether it was brought by Asiatic invaders

from across the isthmus of Suez. . . . As a matter of fact rhc early history of
Egypt was a write-up effected by the Heliopolitan priest-scribes, possibly
not before the fifth dynasty. . . . In outline the sequence of early Egyptian
history has been presented much as follows: the earliest political units were
towns governed by Mayors and worshipping local deities. Later the towns
developed into vermes or provinces each of which had a ruler identified with
the local god. The nomes of the Delta then coalesced into two kingdoms, while the nomes of Upper Egypt remained independent of one another,
.ater, one of the two Delta kingdoms absorbed the other while the nomes of Upper Egypt formed a separate kingdom. The god I lorus was the patron of
the northern kingdom and Set that of the southern realm. Then the
southern kingdom subjugated the northern and the capital of the whole land
was established at Heliopolis (near Cairo). Eventually this united kingdom
fell apart and finally the ruler of the southern kingdom, Men, Meni or
Menes, subjugated the northern realm and established his capital at the city
of the white walls, or Memphis. There is no archaeological evidence for all
these complicated happenings. There are no signs of any northern (i.e. Delta)
cultures older than those of southern Egypt. (23, pp. 120-21)
Again the conclusions reached by Gerald Massey many years ago
are being confirmed by later research. It is high time that this great
Egyptologist should get the recognition that he should have received in
his own lifetime.

"Nearly all the so-called world histories and histories of civilization, so popular in contemporary academic circles, are based mainly on what is known as European civilization," says John G. Jackson. "This species of parochialism gives a false picture of human history; and few students become aware of the fact that European Civilization, speaking historically, is a product of the recent past, and that European culture was not indigenous, but was derived from the older civilizations of Africa and Asia."
In setting history straight, the author has explored a wealth of ancient and classical as well as contemporary literature. From 276 sources, ranging from Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus to Robert Briffault, Sir E.A. Wallis Budge, Charles Darwin, W.E.B. DuBois, Sir James George Frazer, Joseph McCabe, Lewis Henry Morgan, Bertrand Russell, Lewis Spence, and H. G. Wells, Jackson has drawn some soundly documented, often iconoclastic conclusions.
He shows, for example: • How Professor Arnold Toynbee's statement that the black race has made no creative contribution to civilization is false • The evidence for and against the lost continents of Lemuria, Mu, and Atlantis • Why the environment is a limiting agent rather than a determining one • How all available information isagainst the theory of male superiority
• Why the scientists who looked chiefly to Asia as the original home of man were wrong • How the myths of Egypt reveal an astro-religious system, and tell a true story of astronomical progress,calendar correction,and theological changes before the time of written history • Why a civilization may slip backward, but must be pushed to go forward
Man, God, and Civilization is a fascinating primer in geology, archaeology, biology, and sociology, as well as a sophisticated anthropological study. To every student of man's nature and history, it offers a wealth of controversial, provocative material derived from authoritative sources and solid scholarship.
