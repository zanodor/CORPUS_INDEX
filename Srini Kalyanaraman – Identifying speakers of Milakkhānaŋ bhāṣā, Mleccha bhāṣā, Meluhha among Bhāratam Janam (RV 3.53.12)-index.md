Identifying speakers of Milakkhānaŋ bhāṣā,
Mleccha bhāṣā, Meluhha among Bhāratam Janam
(RV 3.53.12)
-- Meluhha artisans and seafaring merchants as shown on Shu-ilishu cylinder seal account for
the formation and evolution of Mleccha bhāṣā, Meluhha , Bhāratīya lingua franca, संपक र् भाषा
-- Meluhha is the sprachbund, ‘speech union’ of Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization, from ca. 7th m.
BCE, which formed the basis for documenting, from ca. 4th m. BCE, over 9000 Indus Script
inscriptions.

“Meluhha as a place name is attested in the Sumerian and Old Akkadian
texts. It is almost always mentioned in connection with Mesopotamian
trade. The three countries Tilmun, Magan and Meluhha are as a rule cited
in this order, pointing to the fact that Meluhha was the most distant of the
three. The articles imported from Meluhha were copper, gold, ivoy birds,
usu wood identified with ebony and another wood that has been
translated as ‘sea wood’- its description Hansaman fits with the mangrove
wood found on the coasts of Sind and eastern Baluchistan...”(Aloka
Parasher, 1978, A study of attitudes—towards mlecchas and other
outsiders in northern India c.AD 600, Ph.D. Dissertation. Univ. of
London, pp. 77, 79, 119.)
Meluhha is a place name

Mleccha-mukha, mleccha ‘copper’; milakkhu in milakkhurajanam means ‘copper’ (Pali)
Milakkhurajanam is a reference to the banner dyed in the colour copper. (The Thera and
Therigāthā, PTS, 1930, verse 965 — milakkhurajanam rattam garahantā sakam dhajam/
tithiyanam dhajam keci dhaāresanty avadātakam// “Finding fault with their own banner which is dyed the colour of copper, some will wear the white banner of the sectarians”)(
K. R. Norman, (Tr. Theragāthā, PTS, 1969).
Mleccha, Meluhha are copper workers, forest workers
Arthśāstra refers to mleccha as forest workers: mlecchātavībhir; (A.S., VII, 10,
16)....coraganāṭavikamlecchajātīnām...( A.S. VII,14, 27)— coraprakrtīnām mleccha jātīnām (A.S. XIII, 5, 15). A variant of Milakkha is Milāca, ‘forest-dweller’. (Jataka, XXV, 486 j
XVII, 524). Mleccha are people living in forests or mountains (MBh., II, 47, 19-20; II, 48, 7
8.)

Bhedās, Kiratas, Sabaras and Pulindas constitute mleccha: bhedā kirāṭa śabarapulinda
mleccha ,jātayah (Amarakośa. II, 10, 20)
The Pali equivalent of Mleccha is Milakkha; the Prakrtam equivalent is Milakkhu; the
Akkadian equivalent is Meluhha. (Samyukta Nikāya, V.466; ācārānga Sutra, II.3.8
(Ardhamāgadhī); Vinaya Pitaka III.28 uses the expression milakkhuka, perhaps in
relation to the work of milakkhu, copper workers).
Bhedās, Kiratas, Sabaras and Pulindas are mleccha

speaks)'...I am informed by spies that five kings among the friends of the
mleccha king (Malayaketu) are following him with great courage... If the
allusion in this play is to actual events, the mleccha princes were
indigenous rulers who were called mleccha because they ruled over
kingdoms on the border — Kuluta, Parsika, Kaśmīra, Saindhava.
These are leads to their principal work related to minerals and metals from
mines in forests.
Malayaketu is mleccha king

Vatsyayana attests mlecchitavikalpa as a cipher, one of the 64 arts to be learnt together with deśabhāṣā jnānam and akṣaramuṣṭika kathanam. Patanjali elaborates on mleccha as a dialect. There is a lot of textual data on people as distinct from language -both mleccha and ārya as dasyu (cf. OIr. daha) and as dwīpavāsinah. I do not know when the word 'ayas' came into vogue. It is as old as Rgveda. The semantics of this word may hold the key in revisiting our language chronologies.
Maluha kedar is a raga in Hindustani classical music. The geographical connotation of
Maluha is Gujhari Todi (Gujarat) or Gaud Malhar (Bengal).

One resource for recontruction of mleccha is a work which dealt with Prākṛit forms. The work is Simharaja, 1909, Prakriti Rupavatara -- A Prakrit grammar based on the Valmikisutra, Vol. I, Ed. by E. Hultzsch, Albermarle St., Royal Asiatic
Society. Full text at: http://ia700202.us.archive.org/23/items/prakritarupavata00simhuoft/prakritarupavata00simhuoft.pdf Prākṛitarūpāvatāra literally means ‘the descent of Prākṛit forms’. Pischel noted: “...the Prākṛitarūpāvatāra is not
unimportant for the knowledge of the declension and conjugation, chiefly because Simharāja frequently quotes more forms
than Hēmachandra and Trivikrama. No doubt many of these forms are theoretically inferred; but they are formed strictly according to the rules and are not without interest.” (Pischel, 1900, Grammatik der Prākṛit-Sprachen, Strassburg, p.43). Pischel also had written a book titled, Hēmachandra's Prākṛit grammar, Halle, 1877. The full text of the Vālmīkisūtra,
with gaṇas, dēśīyas, and iṣṭis, has been printed in Telugu characters at Mysore in 1886 as an appendix to the ṣaḍbhāṣachandrikā.
A format to determine the structure of Prākṛit is to identify words which are identical with Sanskrit words or can be derived from Sanskrit. In this process, dēśīyas or dēśyas, ‘provincialisms’ are excluded. One part of the work of Simharja
is samjñāvibhāga ‘technical terms’. Another is pari bhāṣāvibhāga ‘explanatory rules’. Dialects are identified in a part
called śaurasēnyādivibhāga; the dialects include: śaurasēni, māgadhī, paiśācī, chūḷikā paiśācī, apabhramśa.Additional rules are identified beyond those employed by Pāṇini: sus, nominative; as, accusative; ṭās, instrumental; nēs, dative; nam, genitive; nip, locative.

Other resources available for delineation of mleccha are: The Prākṛita-prakāśa; or the Prakrit grammar of Vararuchi. With the commentary Manorama of Bhamaha. The first complete ed. of the original text... With notes, an English translation and index of Prākṛit words; to which is prefixed a short introd. to Prākṛit grammar (Ed. Cowell, Edward Byles,1868, London, Trubner)On these lines, and using the methods used for delineating Ardhamāgadhi language, by Prākṛita grammarians, and in a process of extrapolation of such possible morphemic changes into the past, an attempt may be made to hypothesize morphemic or phonetic variants of mleccha words as they might have been, in various periods from ca. 4th millennium BCE. There are also grammars of languages such as Marathi (William Carey), Braj bhāṣā grammar (James Robert), Sindhi, Hindi, Tamil (Tolkāppiyam) and Gujarati which can be used as supplementary references, together with the
classic Hemacandra's Dēsīnāmamālā, Prakrit Grammar of Hemachandra edited by P. L. Vaidya (BORI, Pune), Vararuchi's works and Richard Pischel's Comparative Grammar of Prakrit Languages.(Repr. Motilal Banarsidass, 1957).

Colin P. Masica's Indo-Aryan Languages, Cambridge University Press, 1993,"... has provided a fundamental, comparative introduction that will interest not only general and theoretical linguists but also students of one or more languages (Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujurati, Marathi, Sinhalese, etc.) who want to acquaint themselves with the broader linguistic context. Generally synchronic in approach, concentrating on the phonology, morphology and syntax of the modern representatives of the group, the volume also covers their historical development, writing systems, and aspects of sociolinguistics." Thomas Oberlies' Pali grammar (Walter de Gruyter, 2001) presents a full description of Pali, the language used in the Theravada Buddhist canon, which is still alive in Ceylon and South-East Asia. The development of its phonological and morphological systems is traced in detail from Old Indic (including mleccha?). Comprehensive references to comparable features and phenomena from other Middle Indic languages mean that this grammar can also be used to study the literature of Jainism. Madhukar Anant Mehendale's Historical Grammar of Inscriptional Prakrits is a useful aid to delineate changes in morphemes over time.

A good introduction is: Alfred C. Woolner's Introduction to Prakrit, 1928 (Motilal Banarsidass). "Introduction to Prakrit provides the reader with a guide for the more attentive and scholarly study of Prakrit occurring in Sanskrit plays, poetry and prose--both literary and inscriptional. It presents a general view of the subject with special stress on Sauraseni and Maharastri Prakrit system. The book is divided into two parts. Part I consists of I-XI Chapters which deal with the three periods of Indo-Aryan speech, the three stages of the Middle Period, the literary and spoken Prakrits, their classification and characteristics, their system of Single and Compound Consonants, Vowels, Sandhi, Declension, Conjugation and their history of literature. Part II consists of a number of extracts from Sanskrit and Prakrit literature which illustrate different types of Prakrit--Sauraseni, Maharastri, Magadhi, Ardhamagadhi, Avanti, Apabhramsa, etc., most of which are translated into English. The book contains valuable information on the Phonetics and Grammar of the Dramatic Prakrits-Sauraseni and Maharastri. It is documented with an Index as well as a Students'. "
It may be noted that Hemacandra is a resource which has provided the sememe ibbo 'merchant' which reads rebus with ibha 'elephant' hieroglyph.

Sir George A. Grierson's article on The Prakrit Vibhasas cites: "Pischel, in §§3, 4, and 5 of his Prakrit Grammar, refers very briefly to the Vibhāṣās of the Prakrit grammarians. In § 3 he
quotes Mārkaṇḍēya's (Intr., 4) division of the Prakrits into Bhāṣā, Vibhāṣā, Apabhraṁśa,
and Paiśāca, his division of the Vibhāṣās into Śākārī, Cāṇḍālī, Śābarī, Ābhīrikā,
and Ṭākkī (not Śākkī, as written by Pischel), and his rejection of Auḍhrī (Pischel, Oḍrī)
and Drāviḍī. In § 4 he says, “Rāmatarkavāgīśa observes that the vibhāṣāḥcannot be called
Apabhraṁśa, if they are used in dramatic works and the like.” He repeats the latter statement
in § 5, and this is all that he says on the subject. Nowhere does he say what the term vibhāṣā means. The present paper is an attempt to supply this deficiency." See also: http://www.indianetzone.com/39/prakrit_language.htm

The notes are based on: Source: MK Dhavalikar, 1997, Meluhha, the land of copper, South Asian Studies, 13:1, 275-279 (embedded document appended):Citing a cuneiform tablet inscription of Sargon of Akkad (2370-2316 BCE), Dhavalikar notes that the boats of Dilmun, Magan and Meluhha were moored at the quay in his capital (Leemans, WF, 1960, Foreign Trade in the Old Babylonian Period as revealed by texts from Southern Mesopotamia, EJ Brill, Leiden, p. 11). The goods imported include agate, carnelian, shell, ivory, varieties of wood and copper. Dhavalikar cites a reference to the people or ‘sons’ of Meluhha who had undergone a process of acculturation into Mesopotamian society of Ur III times cf. Parpola, S., A. Parpola and RH Brunswwig, Jr., 1977, The Meluhha Village: evidence of acculturation of Harappan traders in the late Third Millennium Mesopotamia, JESHO, 20 , p.152. Oppenheim describes Meluhha as the land of seafarers. (Oppenheim, AL, 1954, The seafaring merchants of Ur, JAOS, 74: 6-17). Dhavalikar notes the name given to a rāga of classical Indian (Hindustani) music – maluha kedār – which may indicate maluha as a geographical connotation as in the name of another rāga called Gujarī Todi. Noting a pronunciation variant for meluhha, melukkha, the form is noted as closer to Prakrit milakkhu (Jaina Sūtras, SBE XLV, p. 414, n.) cognate
Pali malikkho or malikkhako (Childer’s Pali Dictionary). Prakrit milakkhu or Pali malikkho are cognate with the Sanskrit word mleccha (References cited include Mahabharata, Patanjali). Jayaswal (Jayaswal, KP, 1914, On the origin of Mlechcha, ZDMG, 68: pp. 719-720) takes the Sanskrit representation to be cognate with Semitic melekh (Hebrew) meaning ‘king’.

Śathapatha Brāhmaṇa [3.2.1(24)], a Vedic text (ca. 8th century BCE) uses the word mleccha as a
noun referring to Asuras who ill-pronounce or speak an imprecise language: tatraitāmapi
vācamūduḥ | upajijñāsyāṃ sa mlecastasmānna brāhmaṇo mlecedasuryāhaiṣā vā natevaiṣa dviṣatāṃ sapatnānāmādatte vācaṃ te 'syāttavacasaḥ parābhavanti ya evametadveda. This is a
remarkable reference to mleccha (meluhha) as a language in the ancient Indian tradition. Pali texts Digha Nikāya and Vinaya, also denotes milakkha as a language (milakkha bhāsā). Comparable to the reference in Manu, a Jaina text (Pannavana, 1.37) also described two groups of speakers (people?): ārya and milakkhu. Pāṇini also observes the imprecise nature of mleccha
language by using the terms: avyaktayam vāci (X, 1663) and mleccha avyakte śabde (1.205). This
is echoed in Patanjali’s reference to apaśabda.Dhavalikar notes: “Sengupta (1971) has made out a
strong case for identifying mlecchas with the Phoenicians. He proposes to derive the word mleccha from Moloch or Molech and relates it to Melek or Melqart which was the god of the Phoenicians.
But the Phoenicians flourished in the latter half of the second and the first half of the first
millennium when the Harappan civilization was a thing of the past.” (: MK Dhavalikar, 1997,
Meluhha, the land of copper, South Asian Studies, 13:1, p. 276).

Worterbuch (St. Petersburg Dictionary), Hemacandra’s Abhidāna Cintāmaṇi (IV.105), lexicons
of Monier Williams and Apte give ‘copper’ as one of the meanings of the lexeme mleccha.
Gudea (ca. 2200 BCE) under the Lagash dynasty brought usu wood and gold dust and
carnelian from Meluhha. Ibbi-Sin (2029-2006 BCE) under the third dynasty of Ur “imported
from Meluhha copper, wood used for making chairs and dagger sheaths, mesu wood, and the multi-coloured birds of ivory.” Dhavalikar argues for the identification of Gujarat with Meluhha (interpreted as a region and as copper ore of Gujarat) and makes a reference to Viṣṇu Purāṇa (IV,24) which refers to Gujarat as mleccha country.

Nicholas Kazanas has demonstrated that Avestan (OldIranian) is much later than Vedic. " 'Vedic and Avestan' by N. Kazanas In this essay the author examines independent linguistic evidence, often provided by iranianists like R. Beekes, and arrives at the conclusion that the Avesta, even its older parts (the gaθas), is much later than the Rigveda. Also, of course, that Vedic is more archaic than Avestan and that it was not the Indoaryans who moved away from the common Indo-Iranian habitat into the Region of the Seven Rivers, but the Iranians broke off and eventually settled and spread in ancientv Iran." http://www.omilosmeleton.gr/pdf/en/indology/Vedic_and_Avestan.pdf
It is thus possible that Indian sprachbund of the times related to this Shu-ilishu cylinder seal with cuneiform text EME.BAL.ME.LUH.HA.KI (interpreter of Meluhha language), extended to contact regions with Meluhhan (Mleccha) settlers in Sumer and other settlements of Elam/Mesopotamia.

Vermaak, PS, 2008, Guabba, the Meluhhan village in Mesopotamia, in: Journal for Semitics, Vol. 17, No. 2: "Although a Meluhhan village (e-duru me-luh-ha) integrated under the jurisdiction of Girsu/Lagash in southern Mesopotamia has been known since Sargonic times, it has never previously been identified with a specific place name. In this article the Meluhhan village has now, for the first time, been connected in a Ur III text with the wellknown village/town of Guabba (Gu-ab-ba-ki) based on the (twice) published text MVN 7 420 = ITT 4 8024 from Ur III Girsu." http://www.sabinet.co.za/abstracts/semit/semit_v17_n2_a12.html The polemics of Aryan Invasion/Migration or Out of India Theories need not detain us here, in this enquiry related to identification of glosses of mleccha (meluhha), the most likely Indus language, and the underlying sounds used on Indus writing of metalware catalogs. The direction of 'borrowings' is a secondary component of the philological excursus; there is no universal linguistic rule to firmly aver such a direction of borrowing. Certainly, more work is called for in delineating the structure and forms of meluhha (mleccha) language beyond a mere list of metalware glosses. Meluhha were sea-faring merchants and dealers (artisans/ merchants) in tin, zinc and other bronze-age alloying minerals (attested in cuneiform texts).

Mleccha speech synonymous with that of Asura:

Asura get defeated because they lost possession of vāc (speech).

Nāṭyaśāstra (XVII,49) lists seven Prākr̥tam dialects, seven of which are called Bhāṣā: Māgadhī, Avantī, Prācyā, Śaurasenī, Ardhamāgadhī, Bāhlikā and Dakṣiṇātyā. Nāṭyaśāstra (XVII,50) identifies other languages which are used in drama: vibhāṣā dialects, the speech forms of Śakāra, Ābhīra, Caṇḍāḷa, Śabara, Dramiḍa, Oḍra and the speech of foresters (hīna vanecarānām). Nāṭyaśāstra (XVII,46) notes the languages not to be assigned to particular groups of people, guilds or communities: na

Mleccha is derived from proto-Bodish (proto-Tibetan) *mltse ‘tongue’ and Kukish
mlei.(Robert Shafer, 1954, Ethnography of Ancient India,p.23).
Mleccha is Samskrtam form of Hebrew melekh, ‘king’; the utterance he lavah, he
lavah in the SBr. is linked to Hebrew eloah (plural Elohim) meaning ‘God’. (KP
Jayaswal, 1914, Kleine Mitteilungen, ZDMG, Vol. 68, pp. 719-720.) Another view
is he lavah he lavah is a variant of Samskrtam expression he’rayo he’rayo (O
spiteful enemies, O spitful enemies) mispronounced.

Mlech means ‘to speak indistinctly’ and is the root of the word mleccha. The past participle passive is mliṣṭa, mlecchita mean ‘spoken indistinctly’.
(kṣubdhasvāntadhvantalagnamliṣṭviribdhetyādi – Aṣṭādhyāyi, VII, 2,18).
miliṭṭha is the participle in Mahārāṣṭr̥ī. Common form is meccha in Ardha Māgadhī, Mahārāṣṭr̥ī, Jaina Mahārāṣṭr̥ī, Sauraśeṇī, Apabhramśa
Infinitive form mleccitavai, is apabhāṣitavai ‘indistinct, mispronounced/ungrammatical’. (Patanjali, Mahābhāṣya, Vol. I, 1944, p. 25; I,1,1).
mleccha hi yavanas teṣu ( Brhatsamhita, II, 15)
“...the Yavanas were the foremost, the most degraded of the Mlecchas so that Yavana and Mleccha became synonymous.”(H. Kern, Brhatsamhita, 1865, Introduction, p.32, footnote). “...the word Yavana was used in medieval Indian literature as a synonym of mlechchha and indicated any foreigner.” (DC Sircar,1951, Chapter VII, ‘The Yavanas’, in: RC Majumdar, ed., The Age of Imperial Unity, p.101).

The Pannavaṇā (I,37), the fourth upānga of Ācārānga Sutra, states in the first book, in the section on Man, that there are two groups of peoples, the āriya and the milakkha.
Mleccha, mlecchamukha are two of the 12 names of copper: tāmram mlecchamukham śulvam raktam dvaṣṭamudumbaram/ / mlecchaśāvarabhedākhyam markaṭāsyam kanīyasam/ brahmavarddhanam variṣṭham sīsantu sīsapatrakam (Abhidhāna Chintāmaṇi. IV, 105-106).
Paia-Sadda Mahaṇṇavo notes that miccha (a Prakrit form of mleccha) means ‘garlic, and
onion’. mlecchānām priyah kando mlecc hakandah/ ‘Since this root is dear to the

“In Sat. Br. XIII, 8,15 the easterners are described as asurya and it is asura speech (Sat. Br., III, 2,1,24) which the mlecchas are supposed to use...The Nāṭyaśāstra in its chapter on the use of language in drama lays down the hierarchy of languages. Its ideas on the subject are not essentially different from the earlier ones. There are four types of languages – atibhāṣā, āryabhāṣā, jātibhāṣā and yonyantatibhāṣā. The first two, which have been translated as superhuman and noble languages, are ascribed to the Gods and kings respectively. They have qualities of refinement (samskāra) and are current in the seven divisions of the world. The last kins is the language of creatures such as animals etc. It is the jātibhāṣā, spoken only in Bhāratavarṣa, which is noted for its various forms and it is known to contain many words of mleccha origin: dividāha jātibhāṣā ca prayoge samudāhrtā mlecchasabdopacara ca bhāratam varsam āśritā Trans. ‘The Jatibhasa (common language), prescribed for use (on the stage) has various forms.

In the Great Epic, Mleccha are distinguished from Arya speech only in terms of grammatical or ungrammatical nature of speech forms. Mleccha are thus, NOT, foreigners. They are BhāratamJanam (RV 3.53.12). Given the meaning of ‘copper’for word mleccha-mukha and milakkhu, the Mleccha can be cleary identified as guilds of metal workers and given their geographical locations, members of seafaring merchant guilds. Pariyatra mountains of Aryavarta belong to the Vindhya range, probably the hills of Malwa; the Great Epic recognizes Mleccha as inhabitants of Vindha region. Since they were forest and island dwellers, they were also artisans working with wood and minerals/metals.There are 70 references to the Mleccha in the Great Epic. The Mleccha are island dwellers, forest-dwellers, live near sea-coasts, salt-marshes. They are elephant-riders, warriors capable of wielding varieties of weapons. Their speech differs from that of Arya (grammatical) speech. Amarakośa describes the Kiratas, Khasas and Pulindas as the Mleccha Jātis. IndoGreeks, Scythians, Kushanas and Arabs were also mlecchas. Geographic references to the Mleccha deśa (Mleccha country) to the west, identify the term identified with people of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization.The land of the Meluhha speakers is known from the Sumerian/Akkadian texts as Meluḫḫa.-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mleccha Among the peoples termed Mleccha were Sakas, Hunas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Pahlavas, Bahlikas and Rishikas --National geographer, 1977, p 60, Allahabad Geographical Society – History.

"...Ganga, on the lower reaches of which were the kingdoms of Anga, Vanga, and Kalinga, regarded in the Mahabharata as Mleccha. Now the non- Aryan people that today live closest to the territory formerly occupied by these ancient kingdoms are Tibeto-Burmans of the Baric branch. One of the languages of that branch is called Mech, a term given to them by their Hindu neighbors. The Mech live partly in Bengal and partly in Assam. B(runo) Lieblich remarked the resemblance between Mleccha and Mech and that Skr. Mleccha normally became Prakrit Meccha or Mecha and that the last form is actually found in Sauraseni. 1 Sten Konow thought Mech probably a corruption of Mleccha.* I do not believe that the people of the ancient kingdoms of Anga, Vanga, and Kalinga were precisely of the same stock as the modern Mech, but rather that they and the modern Mech spoke languages of the Baric division of Sino-Tibetan.

Mleccha were island-dwellers (attested in Mahabharata and other ancient Indian sprachbund texts). Their speech did not conform to the rules of grammar (mlecchāḥ mā bhūma iti adhyeyam vyākaraṇam) and had dialectical variants or unrefined sounds in words (mlecchitavai na apabhāṣitavai) (Patanjali: Mahābhāṣya)

It speaks of the birth of their sons Ayu and Amavasu, who were asked by their parents, to go out. pran Ayuh pravavraja. Tasyaite Kuru-Pancalah Kasi-Videha ity. Etad Ayavam pravrajam. Pratyan amavasus. Tasyaite Gandharvarayas Parsavo ‘ratta ity. Etad Amavasavam. ‘Ayu went eastward. His people are the Kuru-Pancalas and the Kasi-Videhas. This is the Ayava kin group. Amavasu stayed in the west. His people are the Gandharas, the Parsavas and the Arattas. This is the Amavasava kin group.’” Caland translation: “To the East went Ayus; from him descend the Kurus, Pancalas, Kasis and Videhas. These are the peoples which originated as a consequence of Ayus’s going forth. To the West went Amavasu; from him descend the Gandharis, the Sparsus and the Arattas. These are the peoples which originated as a consequence of Amavasu’s going forth.” Toshifumi Goto tras.: “From there, Ayu wandered Eastwards. To him belong (the groups called) ‘Kurus and Panchalas, Kashis and Videhas’ (note 87). They are the branches/leading away (note 88) originating from Ayu. From there, Amavasu turned westwards (wandered forth). To him belong (the groups called) ‘Gandharis, Parsus (note 89) Arattas’. They are the branches/leading away originating from Amavasu.

Banerji-Sastri refers to Asura a maritime people and links the term with Assyrian Ashur, ‘people of Assyria’, ‘their city’, ‘their country’, and ‘a god whom the Assyrians ralled around’; connects them with sea and waterways.
