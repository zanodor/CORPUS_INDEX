Preface
The idea of creating a concise and relatively inexpensive Akkadian-English dictionary was conceived in 1989 by Nicholas Postgate. It was plain from the start that it would need to be based on the Akkadisches Handwdrterbuch ( A H w ) of W. von Soden, who gave the scheme his blessing in the autumn of that year. From the start Jeremy Black and Andrew George agreed to collaborate in the venture, and in the course of the work we received considerable assistance from other colleagues with Assyriological experience. Although the three Editors have undertaken different proportions of the work, decisions on the dictionary's content and presentation were made collectively. Our procedure was first to produce a drastically abbreviated English translation of AHw, letter by letter. This was then checked against AHw by a second collaborator. To reduce the risk of misunderstandings of AHw's intentions either the first or the second stage was done in each case by a native German-speaker (Tina Breckwoldt, Marie-Christine Ludwig or Cornelia Wunsch). Each letter has been processed at some stage by at least one of the principal Editors. During or after the first stage the provisional text of each letter was word-processed, and the next major stage was the inclusion of corrections and additions. These came from various sources, including the addenda and corrigenda of AHw itself. The principal concern was to take full advantage of the material in the encyclopaedic Chicago Assyrian Dictionary ( C A D ) , now almost complete, wherever this amplified or corrected AHw. Further to this the reviews of both dictionaries in the Assyriological literature were initially harvested by Clemens Reichel, but for each letter responsibility for the difficult task of harmonizing or adjudicating between AHw and CAD where they diverged rested with one of the Editors. There followed a long period during which the complete text was subjected to various editorial and typographical refinements, as well as philological revision and correction.
Acknowledgements
It will be evident that our principal debt by far is to Professor von Soden himself. The production of CDA has taken all of ten years, and this serves to emphasize the single-minded dedication with which the AHw was achieved. Of the collaborators named on the title page Tina Breckwoldt carried out a large part of the initial stage of abbreviation and translation, as well as establishing some of the wordprocessing guidelines. At the other end of the line Graham Cunningham has had a major role in converting a rather ragged text into a coherent whole, single-handedly re-ordering and re-numbering the lemmata, checking all cross-references, standardizing abbreviations and punctuation, proof-reading, etc. etc. Both these collaborators put their own time and expertise into the project far beyond the call of duty. Our thanks go likewise to Clemens Reichel, to Marie-Christine Ludwig for her considerable input at the first and second stages, and to Cornelia Wunsch for her timely assistance with the last of the secondstage checking. Jonathan Blanchard Smith toiled indefatigably deciphering the handwriting of much of the first draft and committing it to disk. Junko Taniguchi prepared with great thoroughness the necessary documentation for the standardization of the logograms with R. Borger's Assyrisch-babylonische

Zeichenliste. To all these collaborators, who often contributed independent philological improvements of their own, we are much indebted, but we must stress that none of them can be held responsible for the inadequacies and especially the inconsistencies which doubtless still exist. At the very beginning Professor von Soden alerted us to the fact that a Riicldaufiges Worterbuch des Akkadischen (SANTAG 1; Harrassowitz 1990) was being produced by his colleague and successor at Miinster, Karl Hecker. He has supported our project since that time, and at the final stages of the work, in 1998, he reviewed the manuscript for us and sent a long list of improvements and additions, particularly for the Old Assyrian material. We are grateful to him and Walter Sommerfeld for accepting the CDA in the SANTAG series. Several other scholars have given us assistance with particular words and issues. Alphabetically, we would like to thank David Brown, Stephanie Dalley, John Emerton, John MacGinnis, Alasdair Livingstone, Eleanor Robson, Christopher Walker, and Martin West, as well as the authors of anonymous corrections inscribed in earlier drafts of the dictionary used in our respective libraries. We would like to say a special word of thanks to Michael Jursa and his colleagues for his unwitting contribution in the shape of the lists of words which regularly appear in the Archiv fur Orientforschung.
Given that our intention has been to create a work tool for students, we have striven to keep the cost of the volume as low as possible, and the text has been supplied to the printers in camera-ready form. For the first nine years of our work, which was done on a series of Macintosh machines, we used a font called "Raydia", designed and given to us by Roy Norman. We are very grateful for this: although with the passage of time it has been overhauled for technical reasons, his font made a substantial contribution to the dictionary. For the final camera-ready version we converted the font to "Assyrian Dictionary", originally generated for the Oriental Institute in Chicago. Guy Deutscher gave unstintingly of his time and computing expertise in the final stages of producing the printout. For ever-present help with computing resources in Trinity College, Cambridge, our thanks are due to Laura Cordy and Peter Thompson. Nicholas Postgate would also like to include a special word of thanks to Neil Mitchison, on whose verandah in Brebbia large sections of the first draft were transcribed. Over the years we have had a great deal of financial assistance for the support of our collaborators. Our thanks are due to the British Academy, to the C.H.W. Johns Memorial Fund and to the Master and Fellows of Trinity College in Cambridge, to the Shillito Fund and the Faculty of Oriental Studies in the University of Oxford, and to the School of Oriental and African Studies in the University of London.

Introduction
The purpose of the dictionary
The demand for a relatively short and inexpensive dictionary of Akkadian is undeniable, especially in the English-speaking world. The only complete and sufficiently modern dictionary of Akkadian available hitherto is Wolfram von Soden's Akkadisches Handworterbuch (AHw). While anyone working seriously on the textual riches of the ancient Near East will end up reading German, it is not encouraging for beginners in Akkadian to be told that they must leam German first. The Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (CAD) still lacks several volumes (at the time of writing, P, R, T, T and U), and even more than AHw it is far too expensive for a beginner or for those with a non-specialist interest in the language. Moreover, there is the purely physical consideration that neither dictionary can be conveniently transported in even the most capacious briefcase. Our experience in our respective universities suggests that for these reasons A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian (CDA) will be much used by students, and in their first year or two this is perfectly appropriate. Nevertheless, we must stress here that it is in no way a substitute for the two fundamental Akkadian dictionaries. Far more than in modem or even Classical languages, these are essential research tools, which need to be constantly consulted by anyone working on the original texts. There are several reasons for this. The CDA does not give textual references, so that the contexts in which a word is used cannot be controlled, which is essential as soon as finer nuances of meaning require to be established. Nor can our succinct presentation convey the relative rarity of many words, or indeed the degree of uncertainty surrounding their normalization, meaning, or even their very existence. In AHw and CAD the writing of the word is given sign by sign for each textual passage. The normalized transcription of each Akkadian word is derived from an interactive process drawing on the attested writings and our perceptions of the morphophonemic structure of Akkadian. Especially with infrequent words the attested writings can often admit of more than one defensible normalization, an ambiguity to which the format of CDA cannot do full justice. The actual writing of a word may also include a determinative which can help to define the area of meaning (e.g. gis for wooden and kus for leather items), and this too is not usually given in CDA. Further, CDA does not list the lexical equivalences, whether with Sumerian or synonyms in Akkadian, and these too can play a major role in establishing a word's meaning.
CAD, AHw and new material
As explained in the Preface, the CDA is based on Professor von Soden's AHw. This means that unless there was a compelling reason to the contrary, we have accepted the normalization and translation of a word as given in AHw. We have however used different principles for determining the alphabetical order of the entries, and adopted a simplified numbering system for words normalized identically. The publication of AHw was spread over more than twenty years, from 1958 to 1981. There are inevitably changes and inconsistencies in its format and content. Some of these will be reflected in the CDA,



Introduction x CDA
though we have of course noted the detailed addenda and corrigenda at the end of the third volume of AHw. In preparing these, Professor von Soden took account of relevant volumes of the CAD, when these existed; for the CDA we have checked our first draft against all published volumes of the CAD. In the Nachwort to AHw (in Band III) Professor von Soden explains that the pressure of time did not allow him always to take account of newly emerging philological commentaries or all of the reviews devoted to both the AHw and the CAD in journals. We have consulted such reviews, as also the lists of words treated in Assyriological literature published in the Archiv fiir Orientforschung, and some of the principal textual editions which have appeared since the completion of the AHw itself. Consequently there are additions and occasional corrections to AHw incorporated in the CDA. The style of the dictionary does not permit us to provide chapter and verse in justification of such changes, and the Editors are considering how best to make such justification available to colleagues. We must stress that there are certainly many more improvements which could have been made on the basis of the Assyriological literature published since 1982 but which we have not taken on board, and significant fresh material appears every year. We would be grateful to receive suggestions from colleagues for addenda and corrigenda for an eventual revised edition.
Principles for ordering of lemmata
The words ("lemmata") are arranged in the order of the English alphabet, ignoring any internal brackets and using the generally accepted conventions that dotted letters (s and t) follow the undotted letter, and s follows s. We have not used the symbol i in our dictionary, although this is found occasionally in AHw in some Old Akkadian contexts, nor have we used the vowel o> nor a symbol for the velar nasal in some loanwords from Sumerian. In our transcriptions and in the alphabetical ordering we use the letter y instead of the j of AHw (and of CAD, which follows German practice). This means that I and Y entries are separated from each other, but in a single volume this should not cause inconvenience. Those familiar with other Semitic languages should note that neither /h/ nor /h/ is recognized in transcriptions of Akkadian, although there is good reason to think that the difference between the two phonemes is reflected in the realization of an underlying adjacent /a/ vowel as a or e respectively. A glottal stop indicated in the cuneiform script is often represented in our transcription by an aleph ('); this need not always have been an aleph in origin, and again the difference between a Semitic aleph and 4ayin is reflected in the realization of an underlying adjacent /a/ vowel as a or e. This is not the place to discuss the realization of other phonemes surviving in Arabic such as the ghayin. The only other problem with the alphabetization concerns letters with a macron, for long vowels, or a circumflex, for contracted vowels, and words transcribed with an aleph ('). The principle by which these are ordered is relatively unimportant to the user, since all words displaying the same basic letters are placed together. AHw and CAD have quite different practices, and ours is different again. To satisfy the curious our practice is as follows: words are first ordered alphabetically ignoring macrons and circumflexes, so that all words containing the same letters in the same order are found together. Within the resulting groups of words, starting from the beginning of each word, words containing unmarked vowels are placed before those containing vowels with macrons, and both are placed before vowels with circumflexes. As for aleph, it does not count as a "letter" for alphabetization purposes, and does not have a position in the alphabetical sequence. A word containing an aleph will be placed immediately after the same sequence of letters without an aleph, or in the place where that word would be if it existed. Following AHw the head-words are presented in their notional Old Babylonian forms, in contrast to the CAD which adopts a Standard Babylonian version. This has certain consequences for the order of the lemmata, most significantly that words with an initial /w/ are found under W, and verbs with A/ as middle radical are to be sought under their uncontracted form (e.g. didnum). There are inevitably difficulties with words whose root has /w/ as a first radical. In some cases one derivative from the root (e.g. the verb) may be attested in Old Babylonian and listed under W, while another derivative (e.g. an



CDA xi Introduction
adjective) may only be known from later dialects, in which case it will probably be found in A. In these cases the derivations and derivatives listed at the end of the entries should make the position clear. Mimation (that is, the final -m of the nominative case ending) is ignored in the alphabetic ordering of the entries; this usually makes very little difference to the order, but note that the final -m of dative or loc.-adv. forms is observed, and this can have a significant effect on the position of some entries, such as -kum or ahum.
Words with identical transcriptions, or differing only by the presence or absence of mimation, are differentiated by Roman numerals (e.g. kibsu(m) I, kibsu II). In CDA only the substantive entries (shown in a bold font) are numbered thus; where we also list an identically transcribed word or words as a variant of a word or words whose substantive entry is elsewhere (shown in italics), a crossreference to that entry is given, but unlike AHw further Roman numerals are not assigned to the variant(s).
The lemma
Nouns are listed in the nominative singular, as are adjectives in their masculine form. A few nouns are cited in nominative plural form where a singular is not attested. Verbs are listed in the nominative infinitive of the G stem, where that stem is attested (or has been reconstructed for the convenience of the dictionaiy, in which case the reconstructed form may be marked with an asterisk, e.g. *ahu(m)). In most instances where a verb is not attested in the G stem it will be listed under the D, S or N form, whichever is attested. Note that such forms can be tracked down by use of the index of roots (pp. xvii-xxiv). Quadriliteral verbs are listed under their N stem, if this is attested, where the S stem will also be found; if only the S stem is known, seek it under S. As in AHw the lemmata are presented in their Old Babylonian or Old Assyrian form, where attested. In these cases, as with the occasional word attested only in Old Akkadian, the form will normally retain its mimation. If the word is also attested in lata- dialects the mimation is bracketed, e.g. eleppu(m), and if it is not attested in any of the earlier dialects, no mimation is shown. As mentioned above, the mimation is ignored in the alphabetization. There are special problems with Assyrian forms, and the following guidelines, which were adopted late in the day, may not have been applied fully consistently. Where a Babylonian form exists it is used as the head-word, and Assyrian forms which differ in accordance with regular changes between the two dialects are not separately specified: thus, for instance, the Assyrian emadu(m) is not specified in the entry emedu(m) since this is an entirely predictable change, and the same applies to short syllables subject to vowel assimilation, such as nemudu for the Babylonian nemedu. Nonetheless, in some cases such forms have been mentioned for the user's convenience. Where, on the other hand, no Babylonian form is attested, the word is cited in its Assyrian form. Thus the verb etaku is known only from Assyrian texts and we have refrained from inventing its Babylonian equivalent, so that it is listed as etaku (not eteku). Similar considerations apply e.g. to wazzunum and nouns such as uthurum. Again the list of roots (pp. xvii-xxiv) should assist the user in tracking down some of these less predictable entries. After the first form of the lemma, shown in bold type, other forms may be listed, in italics. These may be contemporary variants, or the forms attested in other dialects either as a result of predictable dialectal differences or less regular changes. The different dialects are often specified, but the caveats applying to the dialectal distribution of the word as a whole (see below) also apply here. In many cases we are at present unable to determine the correct normalization of a word, because of ambiguities in the way it is written in cuneiform: in such cases the format is x (or y), implying that one or other of the forms is possible (but not both).



Introduction xii CDA
Difficulties tracking down a word
The ambiguities of the cuneiform script frequently make it difficult to track a word down, especially for the student starting out. Apart from problems caused by incorrect grammatical analysis of verbal forms, most elusive words will be located by trying one of three strategies. The first is to look under e instead of iy or vice versa: many cuneiform signs do not distinguish the two vowels (such as // = le)> and even signs which can (such as mi and me) are often used "wrongly" for each other. In general, AHw and hence CDA normalize to e (rather than i) more frequently than CAD, and in particular the rule is usually observed that /i/ followed by /r/ or ty in a closed syllable is realized as /e/ (see GAG §9b). Hence the /pirsum/ form of parasum has to be sought under per sum. A second frequent difficulty is posed by the inability of many cuneiform signs to differentiate voiced from unvoiced and emphatic from unemphatic consonants. Thus the sign DA may be read as da or ta, AD as ad, at or at, BU can be bu and pu> and UB can be ub or up; etc. etc. This is in most cases purely a graphic uncertainty caused by the multivalence of the sign, and it is not the duty of the dictionary to alert the user to all these options. (One particular problem of Old Babylonian texts is posed by cases where a word with a written h may alternate with forms showing no consonant in that position (e.g. (h)alalu). The real nature of the phoneme is difficult to determine, and it is not assisted by the use of the A y sign, which in OB may also be used for a glottal stop, and only after 1500 was differentiated from the new sign A'). Thirdly, especially in earlier texts the scribes often did not indicate double consonants. Hence those reading cuneiform texts need to bear in mind the possibility that where they see only a single written consonant it may be shown by us as doubled.
Further details of the lemma
Where desirable to avoid uncertainty, a word may be followed by a statement identifying its part of speech (e.g. adv.) or by f. for feminine nouns not instantly recognizable as such, pi. for nouns cited in their plural form, or pi. tant. for nouns cited and thought to occur solely in the plural. There may also follow, introduced by f. or pi., feminine or plural forms of the word; these are usually only given where they diverge from the expected.
The principal meaning(s)
The meaning of a word is normally presented between inverted commas, thus "elephant". For verbs, the English infinitive is used at first, thus "to cut off \ but the "to" is not repeated further on in the article. Alternative English renderings of the same area of meaning are separated by commas, "to gain control of, acquire", while distinct meanings may be separated by semicolons, "to restore; have success". When the meaning of a word is not known or unclear, the dictionary states mng. unkn., mng. unci, or mng. uncert., categories which obviously overlap. Following AHw practice, single inverted commas are sometimes used to convey the "original" or "etymological" meaning of a word, a concept which may overlap with "literally". The symbol ~ before a meaning signifies "approximately". In many cases, especially with nouns, the broad area of meaning is certain but the precise translation impossible to determine; with these generic meanings the broad area is indicated between parentheses, e.g. (a plant) or (a disease). If a precise but tentative identification can be suggested we have tended to use the formulation: (a plant, phps.) "parsley".
The periods of attestation
After the principal meaning(s) are shown the dialects in which the word is attested, unless it is encountered generally throughout the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of Akkadian, in which case in keeping with AHw practice no dialectal distribution is given. After Old Akkadian in the 3rd millennium



CDA xiii Introduction
BC, we distinguish the two main dialects of the vernacular, each of which is divided chronologically into Old, Middle or Neo-Babylonian (OB, MB and NB) and Old, Middle or Neo-Assyrian (OA, MA and NA). These main periods may be be further refined by geographical qualifications, such as (N.Mes.), (Bogh.) or (Urar.). After about 1500 BC, in a parallel development, a more or less degraded version of Old Babylonian was preserved by the scribal tradition in Babylonia, in Assyria, and in the various surrounding centres where Akkadian was used as a legal or scholarly medium. This is called "jungbabylonisch" by German philologists, which corresponds broadly to the term "Standard Babylonian" introduced for the CAD. However, the two terms do not coincide exactly and we have elected to retain the abbreviation "jB", partly because it is very familiar to Assyriologists, and partly to emphasize that the period attribution is that of AHw. It is probably not necessary to underline that there was always a degree of cross-fertilization between the "jB" literary dialect and the contemporary vernaculars, especially Middle and Neo-Babylonian. There is only one important respect in which our period designations diverge from AHw, and that is in our abandonment of the category "spatbabylonisch" (spB). The CAD uses the equivalent term "Late Babylonian", but differently at different stages of the dictionary's compilation. The task of establishing our own criteria and applying them to each entry consistently was too daunting, and we decided that for our purposes the simplest solution was to include all spB (and CAD LB) references under NeoBabylonian. Users of CDA should therefore be aware that NB now includes both the later vernacular (after 625 BC on) and other texts of the Persian and Seleucid periods not written in jB or Standard Babylonian. It is important to emphasize that these chronological and geographical categories cannot reflect the real distribution of each word's usage, only its attestations. The periods listed refer only to the texts from which the word is known to us, not to the periods in which the word may really have been used. In the course of preparing the CDA one of the commonest changes from AHw has been the addition of new period attestations, and we can be confident that as new texts are found many of our words will turn up outside their presently known range of dialect and time. While mentioning dialectal distribution we should refer to the limits of our textual catchment area. Generally the dictionary includes words in Akkadian texts from the earliest Old Akkadian in the 24th century BC to the latest cuneiform texts of the 1st century AD. Akkadian, like 20th century English, was a broad church, and under "Akkadian texts" we include even the most divergent products of Human or Canaanite scribes. This means that the dictionary does include loan words from other languages (such as Human, Sumerian and West Semitic languages) provided they have been incorporated into an Akkadian text; however such words are not included when they are listed as equivalents of Akkadian words in bilingual or multilingual texts. In general, Akkadian words attested solely in texts in other languages are not included, but where a known Akkadian word is encountered, for instance, in a Hittite or Elamite text, this may be recorded.
Amplified meanings
After the statement of dialectal attestation there follows amplification of the meaning(s), which differs in its arrangement from entry to entry. In the case of verbs the entry is arranged according to the verbal stems attested (G, D, S and N, with tn and t forms of each where appropriate; and the occasional SD and R stems). The vowel of class {a!a, i/i, u/u, a/u etc.) is usually stated for the G stem, together with other details of the conjugation which are not to be predicted. In longer entries where the further meanings can be divided into significant groups they may be numbered (1., 2., etc.). These groups are not intended to correspond to similar subdivisions in the corresponding AHw entries. Such numbering is also used in cases, mostly nouns, where quite distinct meanings are given under a single entry.



Introduction xiv CDA
Logograms
Logographic writings of a word, usually borrowed from Sumerian, are shown in small Roman capitals between square brackets, thus [UDU]. They are usually placed after the dialectal distribution, but different logographic writings may apply to parts of an entry only (e.g. to the D stem of a verb, or a specialized usage of a noun), in which case they are shown in the appropriate place. No uniformity prevails among cuneiform specialists in the transcription of logograms. With rare exceptions we have adopted the values given in R. Borger, Assyrisch-babylonische Zeichenliste (3. Auflage, with Supplement; Alter Orient und Altes Testament 33/33A, Neukirchen-Vluyn 1986), since it seems best that the work-tools of the Assyriologist should be as consistent with each other as possible. Borger's choice of transcription is intended not merely to indicate the sign in use, but also to reproduce the presumed Sumerian value associated with that meaning. Hence, in contrast to AHw, we write [ M A . G U R S ] rather than [ M A . T U ] as the logogram for makuru(m)\ this does not imply that AHw was wrong, but is a necessary consequence of our exclusion of the lexical section of the AHw entries, from which the user can usually identify the "correct" Sumerian values.
Derivations and derivatives
Akkadian is unusual among Semitic languages in that our modern dictionaries are arranged alphabetically word by word, instead of by roots. This is a consequence of two considerations: there are too many foreign imports from languages which do not share the Semitic word structures (primarily of course Sumerian), and in too many cases the (usually) triliteral root of an "indigenous" Akkadian word cannot be confidently identified. In this respect we have followed the practice of AHw and CAD, but one can only regret the consequent separation of closely related words from their close relatives, so that, for instance, kinu(m)y mukinnufm) and takittum have to be sought in different parts of the dictionary. As a poor mitigation of this separation, at the end of each entry for an "indigenous" Akkadian word are listed words "derived" from it (preceded by the symbol >), and/or a word from which it "derives" (preceded by <). It will hardly need stressing that one form does not always strictly derive from another, but for pure convenience we have adopted the convention that the verbal infinitive is primary, and other forms derive from it. In some cases, where two closely related forms are placed next to each other, we have not felt the need to state their relationship (e.g. gasisis and gasisu(m)). When a word is borrowed into Akkadian from elsewhere, the derivation section merely indicates the presumed language of origin (preceded by <), e.g. Sum., Hum, W.Sem., Ug., Hitt., Elam. etc.
Cross-references
After the derivatives section (and elsewhere) there may also be cross-references introduced by an arrow (-+). These often go back to the "rod-and-ring" symbol adopted by AHw, and like it they are intended to draw the user's attention to another entry for a variety of different reasons. Similarly with the many italicized head-words which are followed only by an arrow referring the user to a main entry, the form in question may not always be listed under the main entry since some are forms not acknowledged by CDA but listed solely to assist the user in tracking down the correct entry. There are however many fewer such cross-references than in AHw, partly because the density of entries on the page makes them less necessary. In particular cross-references to an entry have generally not been included where they would have come immediately before or after it.

This index refers the reader to those lemmata which are verbs in which the given root letters occur. It is intended for practical purposes, to assist the user in identifying a particular verb and find its entry in the dictionary, and does not necessarily carry any implications about the history or etymology of the verb. It does not refer to other parts of speech. The aleph sign used here ( ' ) stands for all weaknesses, including medial a, I, and u, but excluding initial w.
