# Index for Tom van Bakel – The development of the Zodiac starting 23760 BC.pdf

The development of the Zodiac starting 23760 B.C.
In this essay I try to trace the 'story' of the Zodiac constellations based on what I have 'found' in the images of the Ancient Near East cylinder seals. I assumed that these constellations had been given their names in the course of history: for example, the constellation 'The Plough' only became ‘visible’ in the sky after it was invented on Earth:
Evidence of its use in prehistory is sometimes found at archaeological sites where the long, shallow scratches (ard marks) it makes can be seen cutting into the subsoil. The ard (a primitive plough) first appears in the mid-Neolithic and is closely related to the domestication of cattle.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ard_(plough)
And even today, new names are given to stars that are recently discovered.
Number 1
Now, what can be seen on these cylinder seals? In the first place it is shown that the gods engender children, which can be recognized in this imprint.
On the left, the storm god Enlil and his son Ninĝirsu (indicated by the two ears, as they are also grain gods) approach the naked goddess Bau, This scene can be described in the following verse:
An adab to Bau for Luma
Bau, child of An, he has chosen you in his holy heart in the great sky and on the great earth and made you worthy of the ladyship of the Land. Enlil has looked at you with favour,
young woman, Mother Bau, from the shining E-kur, and made you eminently fit for Lord Ninĝirsu. The Great Mountain Enlil has looked at you with favour, young woman, Mother Bau, from the shining E-kur and made you eminently fit for Lord Ninĝirsu.
Bau is the spouse of Ninĝirsu, they marry, engender a child and about nine months later the dog goddess spread her legs to give birth this child when the sun passed through the constellations Canis Major and Canis Minor, of course indicated by the two dogs.
A hymn to Bau's beneficent protective goddess
I shall praise the good woman, the Utu of the Land, my goddess. Mother Bau's august minister, who creates life for the king!



Number 2
Secondly, it became clear that 'life' was brought from heaven down to earth as depicted in this imprint.
Below a man and a wife make love and above them a winged goddess brings down two children, and as a result the wife may get pregnant.
So, from heaven ‘life’ was brought down to earth like in ‘The Flood Myth’ An and Enlil brought down ‘eternal life’:
‘More and more animals disembarked onto the earth. Zi-ud-sura the king prostrated himself before An and Enlil. An and Enlil treated Zi-ud-sura kindly ......, they granted him life like a god, they brought down to him eternal life. At that time, because of preserving the animals and the seed of mankind, they settled Zi-ud-sura the king in an overseas country, in the land Dilmun, where the sun rises.’



Number 3
What struck me is that Aries is a ram, it is male and it is my belief that this constellation originated during the mating season of the sheep and that 'life' was ‘brought’ from this constellation to them the moment the ram inseminated the sheep, like in the above imprint a winged deity brings small sheep to the big ones below.
I therefore moved Aries to the horse time of the sheep and looked at what image arose. I did the same for Taurus and Leo, and while I was figuring everything out I had to go back to the Age of Aquarius, 25000 years ago:
Aquarius 23760 to 21600 B.C.
Capricornus 21600 to 19440 B.C. Sagittarius 19440 to 17280 B.C. Scorpion 17280 to 15120 B.C. Scales 15000 to 12880 B.C. Virgo 12880 to 10760 Lion (Leo) 10760 to 8640, Crab (Cancer), 8640 to 6480; Twins (Gemini), 6480 to 4320; Bull (Taurus), 4320 to 2160. Ram (Aries), 2160 to 0; then Fishes (Pisces), 0 to A.D. 2160.

In this essay I'm using the names of the Babylonian months, which of course is a bit tricky, but I just had to see what that yielded.
We go back about 25000 years ago to ‘The Age of Aquarius’



Number 4
In the period from 23760 to 21600 BC. the sun passed through Aquarius in the Babylonian month ‘Araḫ Šabaṭu’, which then began in March and ended in April. Aquarius is depicted as a man pouring water from a bowl, indicating that it bring forth water and thereby raises the water level in the Tigris and Euphrates, as is the case in this month:
‘Both the Tigris and Euphrates rise many feet each spring, and overflow their banks in various places. The rise is caused by the melting of the snows in the mountain regions from which the two rivers and their affluent spring. The Tigris commonly begins to rise early in March, and reaches its greatest height in the first or second week of May, after which it rapidly declines, and returns to its natural level by the middle of June. The Euphrates first swells about the middle of March, and is not in full flood till quite the end of May or the beginning of June; it then continues high for above a month, and does not sink much till the middle of July, after which it gradually falls till September.’
http://www.annourbis.com/ancient-civilizations/Chaldea/chapter1.html
This means that in Araḫ Šabaṭu a new year began with the rising of the Tigris and the Euphrates, similar to Egypt where a new year began with the rising of the Nile in June.
In the same period the sun passed through Pisces in the Babylonian month ‘Araḫ Addaru’, which then began in April and ended in May. The constellation may have been related to the Manger Fish, a large carp species that lives in the Tigris and the Euphrates. In April and May it is spawning and thus in this period 'life' flows from this constellation to the big fish.
Manger Fish: In the river system of the Euphrates and Tigris Barbus is esocinus the largest freshwater fish and because of overfishing and river regulation strongly in its existence threatened the dam of the Ataturk Dam in Turkey in the upper reaches of the Euphrates also threatens the survival of this kind except for the spawning ascent of fish in April to May, very little is known about the biology of pike barbel.
https://memim.com/mangar-fish.html



From 21600 to 19440 B.C. the sun passed through Capricornus in ‘Araḫ Ṭebētum’, which then began in March and ended in April. The name of this Babylonian month means: 'Month of the Forthcoming of Water', which of course suggests that in ‘The Age of Capricornus’ the rivers began to rise in this very month.
Number 6
Originally, Capricornus was a Goat-fish that, as the name implies, was composed of a goat and a fish.



Today the 'bezoar-ibex' (that is a type of goat) lives in the mountains of Turkey. According to hunters, the mating season is from November to January.
Hunting Season: Hunting season starts as of August 1st and end by March 31st. Mating season is November, December and January.
https://frontier.com.tr/en/anatolian-bezoar-ibex/
The gestation lasted 147 to 180 days:
‘Once pregnant, females will have a gestation period of 147 to 180 days. She will give birth to one to three babies, called kids, at a time. Right after birth, a kid is very alert and can jump around.
Alina Bradford, Live Science, July 23, 2014
And thus kids start to be born in ‘Araḫ Ṭebētum’ (March/April), which means that at that time they got ‘life’ form the constellation Goatfish.
Another well-known fish in the Euphrates and the Tigris is the binni:
The binni (Mesopotamichthys sharpeyi) is a species of cyprinid fish endemic to the Tigris–Euphrates Basin in the Middle East. This fish mostly inhabits lakes and marshes, especially in densely vegetated places where it also lays its eggs, but periodically it moves into rivers.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binni
The spawning time of this fish was during ‘Araḫ Ṭebētum’ (March/April):
General Reproductive Biology of Bunnei (Barbus sharpeyi Gunther, 1874) in Al Huwaizah Marsh, Basra-Iraq
(-) Gonado Somatic Index and maturity stage indicated that spawning time was during March and April.
Turkish Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 6
So, between 21600 to 19440 B.C. the constellation Goatfish may have given ‘life’ to kids being born in ‘Araḫ Ṭebētum’ as well as to the binni fish when they were spawning in the same month.



In ‘The Age of Capricornus’ the sun passed through Cancer in the Babylonian month ‘Araḫ Dumuzu’ which began in September and ended in October.
In Babylon this constellation was called ‘The River Crayfish’:
7 The River Crayfish (AL.LUL), domicile (shu-bat d.Anim) of d.Anu. {Cancer}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
And in Turkey lives a species called ‘Turkish crayfish’:
Astacus leptodactylus, the Danube crayfish, Galician crayfish, Turkish crayfish or narrow-clawed crayfish is a species of brackish water crayfish imported and introduced to Central Europe in 19th century from the Caspian Sea region.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astacus_leptodactylus
The point is that nowadays this crayfish mate in October and November when water temperature is 7-12◦:
Reproductive Efficiency Turkish Astacus Leptodactylus The reproductive cycle of A. leptodactylus can be described as follows: the breeding season begins with the decline in water temperature in the fall. Mating occurs during October and November when water temperature is 7-12◦Candegg-laying takes place 4-6 weeks later, when the water temperature is 6-11◦C.A.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233526569_Reproductive_efficiency_of_the_narrowclawed_crayfish_Astacus_leptodactylus_in_several_populations_in_Turkey
Because the last glacial period ended about 15000 years ago the temperatures in ‘the Age of the Goatfish’ (19440 to 17280 B.C. ) may have been lower. This could have meant that the crayfish may have been mating in September and October, when ‘life’ from the constellation Grayfish was brought to the mating grayfishes on earth.



Number 5
In ‘The Age of Capricornus’ the sun went through Leo in the Babylonian month ‘Araḫ Abu’, which then began in October and ended in November. Leo of course is related to the Asiatic lion and this predator mates in October and November:
Asiatic lions mate foremost between October and November. Mating lasts three to six days. During these days, they usually do not hunt, but only drink water. Gestation lasts about 110 days. Litters comprise one to four cubs. The average interval between births is 24 months, unless cubs die due to infanticide by adult males or because of diseases and injuries. Cubs become independent at the age of about two years. Subadult males leave their natal pride latest at the age of three years and become nomads until they establish their own territory. Dominant males mate more frequently than their coalition partners. During a study carried out between December 2012 and December 2016, three females were observed switching mating partners in favour of the dominant male. Monitoring of more than 70 mating events showed that females mated with males of several rivaling prides that shared their home ranges, and that these males were tolerant toward the same cubs. Only new males that entered the female territories killed unfamiliar cubs. Young females mated foremost with males within their home ranges. Older females selected males at the periphery of their home ranges.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_lion#Reproduction
So it could be that in ‘Araḫ Abu’ ‘life’ from Leo was brought to the mating Asiatic lions on earth.



From 19440 to 17280 B.C. the sun passed through Sagittarius in the Babylonian month ‘Araḫ Kislimu’, which then began in March and ended in April:
Sagittarius is one of the constellations of the zodiac and is located in the Southern celestial hemisphere. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy and
remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for ‘archer’, and its symbol is (U+2650 ♐ SAGITTARIUS), a stylized arrow. Sagittarius is commonly represented as a centaur pulling back a bow.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(constellation)
In Mesopotamia it was called: ‘The Fire-Arrow-Sagittarian’:
33 The star behind them: The Fire-Arrow-Sagittarian (PA.BIL.SAG)AK {SAG = Sagittarius}
It was related to the storm god Pabilsag, who brought rain and thunder and therefore the fire arrow may have been his lightning.
https://en.allmetsat.com/climate/iraq-kuwait.php?code=40072
According to this table, in Abu Kamal the most rain of the year falls in March. It might be that between 19440 and 17280 B.C. much rain felt in this month too. This may have meant that when the sun passed through 'The Fire Arrow-Sagittarian' this constellation generated thunderstorms on earth.



In ‘The Age of Sagittarius’ the sun went through Gemini in the Babylonian month ‘Araḫ Simanu’, which then began in September and ended in October.

2 Araḫ Āru
'Month of the Bull' Ea Iyar April/May
3 Araḫ Simanu Suen BI(KAŠ) (Gemini) Sivan May/June
In this table we can see that the moon god Suen is the presiding deity of Gemini. This means that when the sun passes through this constellation then sun and moon are the twin. The sun of course represents the day and the moon represents the night. So, when the sun passed through this Gemini in ‘The Age of Sagittarius’ this constellation symbolized that during the autumnal equinox day and night were equal.



From 17280 to 15120 B.C. the sun went through Scorpio in the Babylonian month Araḫ Samna, which then began in March and ended in April.
The name Arah Samna means 'Month of Laying Foundations'. In ‘The temple hymns’ we read that the feast of the foundations were held in the month of the New Year, so at that time in Araḫ Samna.
The temple hymns
O Tummal, exceedingly worthy of the princely divine powers, inspiring awe and dread! Foundation, your pure lustration extends over the abzu. Primeval city, reedbed green with old reeds and new shoots, your interior is a mountain of abundance built in plenitude. At your feast held in the month of the New Year, you are wondrously adorned as the great lady of Ki-ur rivals Enlil. Your princess, Mother Ninlil, the beloved wife of Nunamnir, has erected a house in your precinct, O E-Tummal (Tummal House), and taken a place upon your dais.
We also read that mother Ninlil has erected a house. How are we supposed to understand this, because ‘The Age of Scorpio’ felt in the Epipalaeolitic, and the people of this Age were nomadic hunter-gatherers who generally lived in small, seasonal camps:
The Epipalaeolithic Near East designates the Epipalaeolithic (‘Final Old Stone Age’, also known as Mesolithic) in the prehistory of the Near East. It is the period after the Upper Palaeolithic and before the Neolithic, between approximately 20,000 and 10,000 years Before Present (BP). The people of the Epipalaeolithic were nomadic hunter-gatherers who generally lived in small, seasonal camps rather than permanent villages. They made sophisticated stone tools using microliths—small, finely-produced blades that were hafted in wooden implements. These are the primary artifacts by which archaeologists recognise and classify Epipalaeolithic sites.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipalaeolithic_Near_East
Now the following could be the case: couldn't it be possible that with every New Year a new seasonal camp was set up, for instance to celebrate festivities in honour of Marduk, as he was the presiding deity of this month Araḫ Samna?



The female scorpion keeps her eggs inside her body until they are ready to hatch.
https://nl.pinterest.com/pin/144115256795762009/
To understand the Scorpio constellation we have to know a little bit about scorpions. First of all, they mate in May:
The scorpions Androctonus crassicauda were collected at night during 2018-2019 in the mating season this specimens were collected from provinces Baghdad, Karbala, Salahuddin and Wasit the scorpions were found under objects wood, stone, trees ,specimens were put in Iron box and transferred to laboratory for study the genus and the species are identified in the laboratory according to the keys of Kovarik the females mating in May should undergo considerable development before the onset of winter relative to the amount of development in the embryos of females mating in late summer.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343821187_Behavior_Study_Of_Mating_and_Caring_Young_in_Scorpions_Androctonus_crassicaudaScorpionesButhidae
Secondly, all known species give live birth:
During courtship, the male and female scorpion grasp each other's pincers and move around in a ‘dance’ where the male tries to maneuver the female onto his deposited sperm packet. All known species give live birth and the female cares for the young as their exoskeletons harden, transporting them on her back.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion
And they have a long gestation period:
Gestation in scorpions can last for over a year in some species. (-) Unlike the majority of arachnids, which are oviparous, hatching from eggs, scorpions seem to be universally viviparous, with live
births. They are unusual among terrestrial arthropods in the amount of care a female gives to her offspring. The size of a brood varies by species, from 3 to over 100.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion
Because of the low temperatures in the last glacial period the scorpions may have hibernated in winter, like in the Phoenix Valley.
Scorpions are usually all over the Phoenix Valley, but as night temps drop under 70 degrees we don’t see them! That’s because Arizona Bark Scorpions gather to nest in sheltering areas till it warms back up. (-) They gather to nest together like a scorpion bomb waiting to explode in the spring! (-) Why do we say ‘like a scorpion bomb’? Because a scorpion can have up to 100 babies in a litter, and an Arizona Bark Scorpion nest can have 30 scorpions, so the bomb is potentially 3000 scorpions. Bark scorpion nests are like ticking time bombs that explode as soon as night temperatures rise above 70° in March or early April!
https://responsiblepestcontrol.net/blog/where-are-scorpions-in-winter-phoenix-az/
This meant that in Araḫ Samna, when the sun passed through Scorpion, they may have appeared again from their hiding places, together with their live born children: some call this ‘a scorpion bomb’ that explode in spring.



In ‘The Age of Scorpio’ the sun went through Taurus in ‘Araḫ Āru’. This Babylonian month began in September and ended in October
The name Araḫ Āru could be translated as the 'Month of the Bull', which no doubt was related to the aurochs.
Restoration of the aurochs based on a bull skeleton from Lund and a cow skeleton from Cambridge, with chart of characteristic external features of the aurochs.
Distribution of the three subspecies
This map demonstrated that these wild cows lived in all areas where seals were made and where the constellations were probably developed.
Aurochs
The aurochs[a] (Bos primigenius) (/ˈɔːrɒks/ or /ˈaʊrɒks/), also known as aurochsen, urus or ure, is a species of large wild cattle that inhabited Asia, Europe and North Africa. Whilst the wild subspecies, including the nominal subspecies Bos primigenius primigenius, is extinct, extant domestic cattle are considered subspecies of the aurochs. Further discussion and use of the term ‘aurochs’ in this article will, for simplicity, refer only to the extinct wild subspecies unless otherwise specified. Bos primigenius in Europe until 1627, when the last recorded aurochs died in the Jaktorów Forest in Poland.
During the mating season, which probably took place during the late summer or early autumn, the bulls had severe fights, and evidence from the forest of Jaktorów shows these could lead to death. In autumn, aurochs fed up for the winter, and got fatter and shinier than during the rest of the year, according to Schneeberger. Calves were born in spring. According to Schneeberger, the calf stayed at the cow's side, until it was strong enough to join and keep up with the herd on the feeding grounds.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs
The mating season probably took place during the late summer or early autumn, which meant at that time in the month Araḫ Āru 'life' from the constellation Taurus was brought to earth at the moment the aurochs were mating.



Then we move on to the period between 15000 to 12880 B.C. when the sun passes through Libra in March/April. In Babylon this month was called: ‘Araḫ Tišritum’ , which meant: 'Month of Beginning', as of course at that time a new year then began.
A Magnificent Skull with Hornpits of an Aurochs
https://www.catawiki.com/nl/l/11584857-a-magnificent-skull-with-hornpits-of-an-aurochs
It is natural to think that ‘The Scales’ perfectly symbolized that during the spring equinox day and night were equal.
10 The Scales zibanitum 35 Libra Zibanitu, meaning horn or scales = Libra
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
Nevertheless, in ‘The Age of Libra’ a balance did not exist. But Zibanitu means ‘scales’ as well as ‘horns’. As two similar horns it may have symbolised that in Araḫ Tišritum day and night were equal.



Bukhara Urial (Ovis orientalis bochariensis) at Nordens Ark, Sweden
In ‘The Age of the Scales’ the sun passed through Aries in the Babylonian month Araḫ Nisānu, which then began in September and ended in October.
Unfortunately it is not immediately clear which sheep is meant here, because the urial, which starts mating in September, now lives far away in Central and South Asia.
The urial (Ovis vignei), also known as the arkars or shapo, is a wild sheep native to Central and South Asia. The mating season begins in September. Rams select four or five ewes, which give birth to a lamb after a gestation of five months.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urial#/media/File:Ovis_vignei_bochariensis.jpg
There is another sheep called the argali, now living in the highlands of western East Asia. Nevertheless in ‘The Age of the Scales’ they may have lived in the Ancient Near East too, because it appeared that they even lived in France and Italy.
The argali lives in the mountains and plateaus of eastern Central Asia. In the north, its distribution range extends into the Altai in southern Siberia. It also covers the Tian Shan, Tarbagatay, Pamir, Kunlun, the Tibetan Plateau, the Karakoram and the Himalayas, an area within the borders of Mongolia, China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Nepal fall. Fossil finds from the Pliocene (5.3 to 2.6 million years ago) have shown that argali was also found in the Caucasus and Zagros at that time. Remains from France and Italy have shown that they also occurred in western Europe during the Pleistocene.
https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argali
They start mating in October:
The argali (Ovis ammon), also known as the mountain sheep, is a wild sheep that roams the highlands of western East Asia, the Himalayas, Tibet, and the Altai Mountains. Argali reach breeding maturity at two to three years of age. Rutting may occur from October to midJanuary, generally lasting longer in lower elevations.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argali
But in ‘The Age of the Scales’ the temperatures were much lower which may have meant that this sheep may have mated a bit earlier, so in Araḫ Nisānu.



http://www.rr-middleeast.oie.int/viewpage.asp?ID=219 Mouflon
The mouflon, a wild sheep, is native to the Mediterranean islands of Corsica, Sardinia, and Cyprus. The horns of the male can grow nearly into a full circle, distinguishing them from the female.
Then there is the mouflon, a sheep living in Western Asia and southern Europe:
The Armenian mouflon lives mostly in open rough terrain at medium or high altitudes, where they inhabit rocky hill country, lowland and highland steppes, rocky semideserts, grass-covered slopes, and alpine meadows. They spend the summer at the highest elevations, right below the permanent snow. In winter, they move lower and may come into the valleys. They live in small or large herds, and in the summer, the older males live singly or in separate groups. They may live up to 18 years.
https://www.gbif.org/species/165717810
The rutting season from the European mouflon is in October/November:
European mouflon usually form small herds with an older ewe as the leader. Rams often form separate groups outside the rutting season. During the rutting season, the rams fight over the ewes, especially by ramming each other with their curved horns, in order to push their rivals away. European mouflon are herbivores and eat a wide range of food. They also debark trees and seriously hinder tree growth. Their rutting season is in October/November; the gestation period is about five months, and birthing takes place in March/April. One or two lambs are born, the suckling time is about six months.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_mouflon#Behaviour
But rutting season from the Armenian mouflon is from late autumn to early winter:
Mouflon rams have a strict dominance hierarchy. Before mating season or ‘rut’, which is from late autumn to early winter, rams try to create a dominance hierarchy to determine access to ewes (female mouflon) for mating. Mouflon rams fight one another to obtain dominance and win an opportunity to mate with females. Mouflons reach sexual maturity at the age of 2 to 4 years. Young rams need to obtain dominance before they get a chance to mate, which takes another 3 years for them to start mating. Mouflon ewes also go through a similar hierarchy process in terms of social status in the first 2 years, but can breed even at low status. Pregnancy in females lasts 5 months, in which they produce one to two offspring.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouflon
Nevertheless, in the Netherlands, with its lower temperatures, the rutting season recently is in September:
During mating season, usually in October but more recently in September, the rams fight for the
attention of the ewes. During these fierce battles, they ram their horns together. The blows can often be heard from a great distance. It therefore comes as no surprise that they developed thick skulls. Unlike red deer, mouflons do not keep harems. Their young are born in February.
https://www.hogeveluwe.nl/en/discover-the-park/nature-and-landscape/mouflon
I think that one of these sheep must have served as a model for Aries, but I don't really know which one.



Between 12960 to 10760 B.C. the sun went through Virgo in March/April. This constellation indicated that many children were born in this period. The point is that the cylinder seals show again and again that in the Ancient Near East for a long time it was common to get married in June just like in Rome:
In Rome June is known for the large number of marriages that occur over the course of the month. According to one etymology, June is named after Juno. Juno was the goddess of marriage and a married couple's household, so some consider it good luck to be married in this month.
Published: http://en.wikipedia.org/
Being engendered during honeymoons in June, the children were born about nine months later in March. So, between 12960 to 10760 B.C. they were born in Virgo, so this constellation brought these children ‘live’ the moment they were born.
Like this goddess brought ‘life’ to the loving couple below.



https://watchdogpestcontrol.com/baby-scorpions-are-not-cute/
In ‘The Age of Scorpio’ marriages may also have been performed in June, when the sun passed through Aquarius. About nine months later children were born in Scorpio. That is the reason why the scorpion goddess Iskhara is a mother goddess who is related to Ishtar:
‘The evidence that the scorpion is Iskhara is drawn from an astrological omen tablet. In Thompson, ‘Reports of the Magicians’, p. 76), we read: ‘ Anu {D. P. muT) Akrahi {D. P. ilu) Iskhara ina la'ah iirrisha,’ etc., ‘when in the flaming Ught of Scorpio Iskhara,’ etc. Here Scorpio and Iskhara are identified. See also Jensen (‘ Kosmologie,’ pp. 72, 73) for ‘ {Mul) Girtah-Iskhara tamtim,’ where Girtab, Sumerian for Akrabu, scorpion, is equated with Iskhara, a goddess resembling Venus. The scorpion is frequently depicted on the stones and Iskhara is frequently mentioned. She is a goddess of the Kassite pantheon of whom very little is known. She is related to Ishtar and is called ‘Goddess of the Holy Mound,’ that is, of the sea (Sayce, ‘Religions of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia,’ p. 374)’

In ‘The Age of Taurus’ that lasted from 4320 to 2160 B.C. marriages may also have been performed in June, and the sun passed through Leo. The children engendered during the honeymoon were born about nine months later in Taurus, during the harvest period, indicated by the ear.



Number 8
And in ‘The Age of Aries’ that lasted from 2160 B.C. to 0 marriages may also have been performed in June, and the sun passed through Cancer (on cylinder seals this constellation is always represented by scorpions). The children engendered during the honeymoon were born about nine months later in Aries. On this drawing two scorpions symbolized a Sacred Marriage of Anu, the god of heaven, and Iskhara in June. The two sheep symbolized that the same Anu and Iskhara gave life to a child in Aries, which then indicated March.

Diskussion: [ergänzter Text von Keel/Schroer 2004: Nr. 71: Die Stellung der gespreizten Beine hat wohl nichts mit Geburt zu tun, sondern ist wie auf Terrakottaplaketten aus dem nördlichen Babylonien, die ab Hammurabi belegt sind, als primär apotropäische Position zu deuten (Assante 2002: 44-47; vgl. auch Kat. 235)].

Number 6 This piece was found in Burrington, Somerset, UK, by an individual using a metal detector, and is



now held at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton, Somerset in southwestern UK. It has been roughly dated to C 1st or 2nd AD during the Roman occupation of Britain. Although it weighs 886g, the figurine is only 25 cm long, 3.75 cm wide and 8.825 cm tall. It is made of bronze, or more generally, copper alloy. Apparently it used to have horns as well, but these were broken off in the past, since a patina has developed over the breaks. It is thought to be the figure of Capricorn, or of the mythical sea-goats from the first sea god, Pricus. Pricus is the father of all the sea-goats. The legend goes that the sea goats liked to go up onto the land to lay in the sun, and eventually they all evolved to the 4legged goats we have today, leaving Pricus as the sole sea-goat because he didn’t agree with the sea-goats leaving to go to land. In his misery, he begged Chronos to allow him to live in the sky as the constellation Capricorn, so that he can see his children on the earth. This sculpture is an earthy mid-brown colour with what appears to be verdigris evident on its right forelimb, suggesting that it may be made of a copper alloy. Most of its surface is patterned with incised lines that outline the scales on its hindquarters and the hair on its forequarters. The modelling of facial features and forelegs contributes to the realism of the sculpture, as does the lively action of the forelimbs, implying movement.
Number 7 This is a typical Early Dynastic cylinder seal, (grey speckled marble 2.6 cm) dated around 2500 B.C. It depicts a contest frieze. Crossing lions attack horned animals, flanked by trees. Prof. Lambert dates this seal to the Akkadian period, but according to Dr. Winkelmann (see links) it is clearly Early Dynastic. Below the seal impression see a parallel, found at Kish.

Number 8 Fig. 1021 is peculiar in the style of its cutting, quite unlike almost anything else. Two such scorpions, cut very deep on the hematite and yet well cut, can hardly find a parallel. The columns, with their crossed pineapple tops and the closely crossed bodies of the goats, are equally pecuhar, not to speak of the stars in couples flanking the bottom of the columns. It is impossible to guess with any degree of assurance as to the provenance of this seal.
