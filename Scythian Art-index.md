Foreword
In archaeology, the term ‘Scythians’ is generally used to refer to the tribes which inhabited the steppes adjacent to the northern shores of the Black Sea. There is also a broader concept of‘the Scythian world’, considered as a conglomeration of various tribes sharing a common economic and cultural life and inhabiting a vast territory. The study and excavation of Scythian burial sites in the territory to the north of the Black Sea coast began over two hundred years ago. In 1763 a large mound was unearthed near Yelizavetgrad (now Kirovograd) in the Ukraine. It yielded many precious objects of gold and silver of the early Scythian period (late seventh and sixth centuries B.C.). These artifacts were taken to the Kunstkanmer{Chamber of Curios) in St. Petersburg, founded by Peter the Great as Russia’s first museum. The Kunstkammer already possessed a number of gold artifacts in the Scythian style which had been discovered in Siberian barrows. They had been presented to Peterthe Great by Nikita Demidov,a rich manufactur¬ er in the Urals(in 1715),and by Matvei Gagarin,governor of Tobolsk (in 1716). In 1859 all the archaeological collections of the Kunstkammer were moved to the Hermitage. The systematic study of Scythian antiquities started with the excavation of the KulOba barrow near Kerch in 1830. A rich burial of the fourth century B.C. was discovered there in a stone sepulchre. It contained many priceless works of Greek jewellery, includ¬ ing a magnificent gold torque (rope necklace) with sculptured figures of horsemen at its ends and a ritual vessel of electrum (an alloy of silver and gold) depicting four groups of Scythians. These scenes may illustrate a legend recorded by Herodotus which relates how the three sons of Heracles (apparently identical to the first Scythian king, Targitaus) decid¬ ed the question of succession by stringing his bow. Excavations of barrows in the Ukraine and the North Caucasus intensified after the establishment of the Imperial Archaeological Commission in 1859. The main office of the commission was in the building of the Hermitage, and the most valuable finds were handed over to that museum. In 1863 the Chertomlyk barrow, whose huge dimensions (it was 20 m high) had attracted the attention of scientists for a long time, was unearthed in the Ukraine. During its excavation archaeologists discovered a fine silver amphora with friezes of Scythians taming wild horses. Excavations of the Bolshaya Bliznitsa barrow were carried out between 1864 and 1868. This barrow was apparently a family sepulchre since it had several vaults. One of the vaults contained a number of articles supposedly belonging to a priestess of Demeter, the goddess of fertility, and numerous gold adorn¬ ments from the ritual dress usually worn by a woman of high birth. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the majority of archaeological finds were made in the North Caucasus and especially in the territory along the Kuban river. Here, in the vicinity of the Cossack village of Ulsky, at a depth of fifteen metres, archaeologists discovered the remains of a wooden structure. Three hundred and sixty skeletons of horses were lying around the pillars and hitching-posts. Although the Scyth¬ ians are known to have sacrificed horses to their deities, no group of that size had ever been found before. Further searches are being conducted in the area. Excavations of the six Kelermes barrows carried out in 1903 and 1904 were of great importance for the study of early Scythian culture. They yielded extraordinarily interesting materials which confirmed the Scythians’ ties with the Ancient Orient. The artifacts included an akinakes (a short iron sword) with its gold mount and scabbard deco¬ rated with imaginary beasts in an old Oriental style. The only other sword of that type was found in the Ukraine in 1763. Objects of purely Scythian craftsmanship were also found at Kelermes. One of these, a shield ornament, shows a gold panther whose paws and tail are ornamented with stylized images of curled-up predatory beasts. Another gold shield ornament, bearing the image of a recumbent stag with large foliated antlers, was found in the village of Kostromskaya on the Kuban in 1897. Stylized images of various animals were traditional in Scythian art.

While at the turn of the century new archaeological discoveries were being made almost every year in the North Caucasus and along the Kuban, rich archaeological finds in the Scythian barrows in the Ukraine had become very rare. It seemed that all the impor¬ tant barrows in the area had already been dug up or pillaged, and that further excavations would require enormous effort while promising but poor results. Nevertheless, new excavations were undertaken in 1912 and 1913 at the site of the Solokha barrow on the left bank ofthe Dnieper near Nikopol. One ofthe chambers ofthis barrow had not been ransacked and a famous gold comb, made by a Greek artist in the fourth century B.C., was found there. The comb is crested with sculptured figures of Scythians engaged in battle. The successful excavation of the Solokha barrow brought new hopes for further discoveries of Scythian artifacts in the Ukraine, but forty years were to pass before the hopes were realized. With the outbreak of World War 1 in 1914 all the archaeological activity in the country came to a standstill, to be resumed only in the Soviet period when favourable conditions for archaeological work had been created. The Archaeological Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR was put in charge of archaeological work in this territory. In 1954 a barrow ofthe fourth century B.C. was dug up near Melitopol and a remarkable gorytus (a case for bow and arrows) was found there in a cache. Its design appears to have been made from the same mould as was used for the goryti found in the Chertomlyk, Ilyinetskaya and Yelizavetovskaya barrows. Excavations of Scythian barrows were intensified in the 1960s and 70s when con¬ struction of irrigation systems was started in the steppe to the north of the Black Sea. During this period about three hundred barrows were excavated by different archaeologi¬ cal expeditions of the Institute of History, Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. One of these barrows, the Gaimanova Mogila, yielded a silver-gilt ritual vessel of the fourth century B.C. The vessel shows two groups of relaxing Scythians, whose servants are offering them a wineskin and a goose. Excavations of the Tolstaya Mogila (Great Grave) barrow near the town of Ordzho¬ nikidze, Dnepropetrovsk Region, in 1971 were of great importance, particularly because
6



they yielded a large and unique gold pectoral (breast ornament) of superb workmanship. Made in relief, it depicts scenes from the nomadic life of the Scythians. All these outstanding artifacts, found in the Scythian barrows ofthe Ukraine over the past thirty years, are now kept in the Museum of Ancient Ornaments in Kiev. A thorough study of the relics of Scythian culture found in the Ukraine, the North Caucasus and Siberia, has provided evidence that all the artifacts dating from the sixth century B.C. are closely related. Archaeologists have gradually established the similarity of many cultural elements in the vast area extending from the Danube to Mongolia. Many identical articles of the Scythian type were found at sites separated by enormous distances. The majority of these objects are items of horse attire or harness, since the horse was at that time the chief means oflong-distance travel. A similarity is also traceable in the bronze arrowheads, akinakiand other weapons, as well as in personal adornments, which were found in different areas. Cultural contacts may also be demonstrated by the frequent depiction of animals, usually shown engaged in fighting, in the so-called Scyth¬ ian animal style. The links between the nomadic tribes can be traced back to the pre-Scythian era, beginning from the eighth century B.C. They are illustrated by material from the archaeo¬ logical excavations of the Arzhan barrow (Tuva ASSR). In addition to objects similar to those found in the Ukraine and Bulgaria, it also contained fragments of Persian fabric which were two centuries older than the earliest Persian carpet which had been found in the Pazyryk barrow in the Altai mountains. All these facts show that the conditions ofthat period allowed certain contacts between remote areas to be maintained. This was largely due to the nomadic forms of livestock-raising common to all the tribes, especially horsebreeding, which made it possible to move great distances. Regular interchanges between the nomads helped them to compensate for the deficiencies in minerals and metals, such as tin. Nevertheless, there were apparently no direct contacts between the tribes of the extreme East and West. Cultural elements were obviously adopted and passed on from one tribal group to the next, although the process might have been haphazard and the groups themselves unaware of the origins of this culture.

The well-armed and highly mobile Scythian horsemen - skilled archers and brave warriors - were a constant threat to their neighbours. Herodotus recorded that they, alongside the Cimmerians, invaded Asia Minor and conquered some areas of the region. Herodotus’ view, however, that these nomads subsequently lost all contact with their native land is questionable. Herodotus’ record of the Scythian invasion of Asia Minor has been recently confirmed by ancient documents and by archaeological evidence. The arrival of the Cimmerians was first recorded by Assyrian scouts about the mid-eighth cen¬ tury B.C., and the Scythians appeared in this area in the seventh century B.C.,as recorded on clay tablets found in the archives of Nineveh, the capital of Assyria. The Scythians par¬ ticipated in hostilities against Assyria - this fact was mentioned in the chronicles of the Babylonian king Nebopolassar for the years 616-609 B.C. Excavation of Urartian citadels of the seventh century B.C. in Transcaucasia (Karmir-Blur) and in the central part of the former Urartian kingdom (Chavush-Tepe), near Lake Van (Patnos), has yielded many items of horse harness, iron weapons, beads, etc. In shape and style the objects are reminiscent ofthose found in the ancient barrows near the Dnieper river and in the North Caucasus. In the barrow to the north of Lake Van a large number of three-edged bronze arrowheads, apparently of the Scythian type, was found. Further proof of the interaction between the Scythian and the ancient Oriental cul¬ tures was provided by analysis of the archaeological finds made at Zawiyeh in the north-west of Iran in 1947. One group out of a large body of artifacts was quite distinct from the others, in that its decoration combined elements of the ancient Oriental style (Urartian) with certain features typical of Scythian art. At the same time some objects recovered from distinctly Scythian barrows show an Oriental influence. These include akinaki with gold hilts and scabbards from Kelermes and from the Melgunov barrow, which was opened in 1763. The Scythian motifs (recumbent stags) combine on the objects found in Scythian barrows, as well as on the Zawiyeh finds, with Near Eastern elements (a sacred tree and fantastic animals) rendered occasionally in a distorted way. Archaeologists often associate the origin of Scythian art with their invasion of Asia Minor. Undoubtedly, their stay there resulted in a strong impact of Near Eastern art on Scythian culture, but elements of the animal style have also been observed in artifacts of the earlier period found in Siberia and in the Volga area. As is now known, the steppes around the Ural mountains and along the Don and Volga rivers were inhabited by no¬ madic tribes with a culture akin to that of the Scythians. The Greeks called them Sauromatae or Sauromatians, and in all probability it was they who served as intermediaries be¬ tween the Scythian world and the tribes of East Kazakhstan. The gold plaques from a wooden quiver, shaped as recumbent stags, which were found in Kazakhstan, in the Chilikta barrow of the early sixth century B.C., are a convincing evidence of the links. The contacts spread further through the Kazakh steppes to the Altai mountains, as testified by the finds unearthed in the Pazyryk and Bashadar barrows. The unique mate¬ rial recovered from these barrows proved to be of the utmost scientific and artistic value, because the formation of permafrost had ensured excellent preservation of objects of wood, bone, felt, leather and metal. All these articles testify to the links of the Altaian cul¬ ture with those of China, Persia and Scythia. The sixth-century B.C. objects from the Pazyryk barrows include the oldest specimen of Chinese silk fabric ever found, a large
8



Persian carpet and some fragments of Persian textiles, with designs copied from glazed
tiles of the Achaemenid palace in Susa. The famous collection of Scythian antiquities in the Hermitage consists mainly of artifacts unearthed from the barrows in the lower reaches of the Dnieper river and in the North Caucasus. It provides an opportunity for the viewer to see the whole range of intri¬ cate relations that existed between the Scythians and their western, eastern and southern neighbours. Thus, in 1970 a Thracian bridle set with fine silver plaques in the form of ani¬ mals’ heads was found in the Khomina Mogila barrow. A remarkable object of Persian origin (from the Achaemenid era) is a richly decorated gold hilt of a sword, found in the Chertomlyk barrow. Also of note are a silver rhyton (drinking vessel) in the shape of a winged ibex and gold overlays for a wooden vessel, discovered in tumulus 4 of the Seven Brothers barrows (so named because of their number). We know of a dozen Achaemenid seals, which were found in the areas to the north of the Black Sea and in the North Caucasus. A burial in the Bolshaya Bliznitsa barrow on the Taman peninsula yielded two works of Near Eastern art: a chalcedony signet-ring of the Achaemenid era depicting a king killing a lion and an earthenware amulet shaped as the head of the Egyptian god Bes (a dwarf with an ugly face and a head-dress of feathers or palm leaves). The image of Bes, who was regarded above all as a guardian spirit, might have reached the area from the south, since many Egyptian craftsmen had been forced to move to Persia in the Achaemenid time and they could make their amulets there. Egyptian objects may also have reached the Scythian lands through Urartian centres and, starting in the sixth century B.C., through Greek colonies, especially those ofthe city of Miletus. A large number of Egyptian scarab amulets was manufactured in the Milesian colony ofNaucratis in the delta of the Nile and then exported to Scythia (they were found on Berezan Island, in the ancient necropolis of Olbia, commanding the estuaries of the Bug and the Dnieper, and in the burials of Gomaya Racha on the southern slope of the Caucasus mountains). Thus, numerous artifacts found in the Scythian lands provide evidence of the Scyth¬ ians’ vast contacts with different cultures of the peoples of Eastern Europe and the Near and the Far East. This extensive channel of cultural communication connecting East and West functioned successfully until the middle of the first millennium B.C., to be later transformed into the famous “silk route”. The silk route existed until the sixteenth cen¬ tury A.D., running from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea via Persia and Cen¬ tral Asia to the banks of the Huanghe river in China. Later on the main trade route shifted southwards, as the sea came to be preferred for trade and communications. The strong links with the countries of Asia Minor were vital for the Scythians, who thereby gained access to a highly developed culture and art. The magnificent Hermitage collection of Scythian antiquities, dating from the seventh to the third century B.C., contains many masterpieces ofjewellery. It reveals the highest level of workmanship and the Scythians’ close ties with many peoples and tribes in the vast territories between the Far East and Western Europe.

Pages from Scythian History
Herodotus (484-425 B.C.), the Greek historian known as the Father of History, states in his detailed account of the origin and customs of the Scythian tribes that they called themselves “the most recent of all nations” and believed that they descended directly from their legendary forefather Targitaus, who was born in their land, then a wilderness, to divine parents - Zeus and the daughter of the Borysthenes river (as the Dnieper was then called). The historian recorded that legend during his visit to the Greek colonies on the northern coast of the Pontus Euxinus (Black Sea), about 450 B.C. According to another story related by Herodotus the Scythians were descended from Heracles and a mythical creature, half-maid and half-serpent, who dwelt in a dense wood¬ land called Hylaea, not far from the Borysthenes. Both legends were apparently created by the Scythians to sub¬ stantiate their claims to the area in the lower reaches of the Dnieper. Herodotus himself shared the opinion of the Greek poet Aristeas, who thought that the Scythians had migrated to this area from their native lands somewhere in the eastern part of the Eurasian steppes. Although the real origin of the Scythians has still not been established, historians favour two main theories. One group thinks that the Scythians were Iranian-speaking tribes which migrated to the area from Asia and reached the northern parts of the Black Sea in the seventh century B.C. with their culture already formed. Another group of historians believes that these were autochthonous tribes of indigenous origin which had inhabited these areas for many cen¬ turies. This group believes that their material culture had been formed by the seventh century B.C. on the basis of the so-called log culture, which had been brought to the Black Sea from the Volga basin about the end of the second millennium B.C. Since the appearance of these nomadic tribes on the stage of world history the name ‘Scythian’ became a symbol of the threat of destruction. Herodotus points out that the Scythian invasion of the area adjacent to the northern Pontic shores ended in the nearly complete extermination of the Cimmerians who lived in this area. The surviving Cimmerians left the steppes for Asia Minor. Shortly afterwards the Scythians also headed south in search of new lands. They crossed the Caucasus and invaded the territory of Asia Minor. Ancient records describe a great upheaval caused by the invasion of this mobile and well-armed force. The Assyrian chronicle dated these events from the 670s B.C. Oriental and classical records also report that the Scythians stayed in the ter¬ ritory of Asia Minor for nearly a century and actively participated in a number of military campaigns and local wars. According to Herodotus, they not only imposed heavy tributes upon the conquered nations, but often car¬ ried out plundering raids, devastating all around “by licentiousness and neglect”. The prophet Jeremiah, addressing the Israelites, described in a dramatic manner the disasters that would be brought by the northern nomads: “It is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say. Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men. And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat; they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees; they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.” The Scythians formed on the territory of Transcaucasia a kind of tribal alliance which was called the Scythian kingdom, with its centre in the country' of Manna near Lake Urmia (now Lake Rizaiyeh in Iran). For twenty years they dominated the area, taking an active part in the raids against Assyria, in the siege of its capital Nineveh and in the destruction of the state of Urartu. Even the pharaoh of Egypt had to pay large tributes to placate the Scythian rulers. The rise of a powerful kingdom of the Medes in this area put an end to the rule of the Scythians. Driven away by the Median king Cyaxares (c. 600 B.C.), they abandoned the area and left Asia Minor for their native lands in the lower reaches of the Dnieper. On their way back some groups of Scythians settled in the North Cau¬ casus, which had been their bridgehead during the military incursions into Asia Minor. A major centre of the early Scythian culture was the area along the Kuban river in the North Caucasus. From time immemorial it had been inhabited by non-nomadic Maeotian tribes which were subjugated by the nomads moving from Asia Minor. The finds from the Kelermes barrow in that area, where a local aristocracy of Scythians was buried, fully confirms this assumption. The rest ofthe Scythians,judging by archaeological finds of the Litoi (Melgunov) type of barrows, returned to the steppes near the Dnieper. The strong and militant nomadic tribes of Scythians soon subjugated a number of Thracian-speaking and pre-Slavonic tribes (Alazones, Budini, Geloni, agrarian Scythians), who occupied the area of the forest-steppes along the Dniester, Bug and Dnieper rivers. This tribal alliance was the first state organized on the territory of Eastern Europe. Within this state, the clan of the Scythian king established political and military domination. From the seventh to the fifth century B.C., Greek colonies emerged on the northern and eastern shores of the Black Sea near the area inhabited by the Scythians. Particular importance was acquired by Olbia, Chersonesos and Panticapaeum. The unusual way of life and strange customs and habits of the Scythians attracted the attention of many Greek historians, geographers and writers. Herodotus writes that the Scythians “have neither cities nor fortifica¬ tions, but carry their houses with them”, that they “are all equestrian archers, living not from the cultivation ofthe earth, but from cattle”, and that their “dwellings are waggons”. These nomads, with their huge herds and wheeled family-dwellings, endlessly roamed the vast steppes. Constantly in search of new pastures, they resorted to force to acquire new grazing-grounds. Their livestock pro
12



vided them with all necessaries of life. They drank mare's milk and ate cheese and the meat of the animals. They usually received grain for their bread from the subject land-tilling tribes as tribute, while wine, olive oil, adorn¬ ments and some items of weaponry were bought from the Greeks or acquired in exchange for some other goods, including animal products, hides, honey, fish and especially wheat. The Black Sea coast also supplied people for sale as slaves, who were captured by the nomads during their plundering raids against neighbouring tribes. Ancient records often mention Scythian names among the slaves sold as potters and domestic servants, but most are listed as archers. Describing the Scythian way of fighting the enemy, Herodotus states that “no one who attacks them can escape” and “if they do not choose to be found, no one is able to overtake them.” The historian explains it as fol¬ lows: “For they, who have neither cities nor fortifications but carry their houses with them, who are all equestrian archers... - how can such a people not be invincible, and difficult to engage with?” A fine example of Scythian invincibility was the utter defeat of the Persian kings Cyrus and Darius I in their military campaigns against the Scythians carried out in 529 and 512 B.C. respectively. The Scythians usually lured the enemy deep into the open steppe far from his sources of supply and then exhausted him by endless attacks from all sides. In the early period of the Scythian kingdom its armies were formed by the conscription of all able-bodied men. Women also sometimes took part in military campaigns. The king himself headed the troops. Later, caval¬ ry detachments of the Scythians were organized on a voluntary basis. The nucleus of each detachment was a heavily-armed corps of the nobles which formed the king’s bodyguard. The steppe nomads were bom warriors and never parted with their weapons. “We are continuously engaged in battles, either attacking the enemy or defending our loot and pastures,” said the Scythian Toxaris, a hero of the story of the same name by the Greek writer Lucian of Samosata (second century A.D.). It is not strange, therefore, that bravery and defiance of danger were virtues particularly revered by the Scythians. They specially cultivated these qualities by performing solemn military rituals and ceremonies. When a Scythian soldier killed his first enemy, Herodotus relates, the event was marked with a special ritual the Scythian drank his blood. Skulls of enemies were used for making bowls covered with leather and sometimes with gold. Slain enemies were scalped. According to a tribal law, the share of the booty awarded by the chieftain to his warriors for bravery depended on the number of heads with which they returned. Fraternal relations were quite natural for the Scythians. Unrelated men could affirm their friendship and mutual loyalty by making a solemn contract of blood brotherhood. According to Herodotus and Lucian, Scythians entering such a union had to cut their fingers with a knife, squeeze out several drops of blood into a sacred bowl filled with wine, plunge a sword, a spear, a pole-axe and some arrows into the bowl and make many solemn prayers. Finally all the participants drank the mixture and proclaimed themselves to be brothers. Depic¬ tions of the ritual, especially its crowning moment, are frequent in works of art from the Scythian era. Lucian tells us that according to Scythian beliefs such a brotherhood could not exceed three persons because “a fraternity shared by many cannot be strong.” He describes several Scythian legends about the heroism and faithfulness of those who tied their destinies to others’ by the oath of blood brotherhood. “It was on the fourth day of the friendship of Dandamis and Amizokes, after they had drunk each other’s blood,” begins a legend. Suddenly the Sauromatians, nomads from across the Don, attacked the Scythian camp. They captured much loot and drove hundreds of people with them. Amizokes was among the prisoners too. When he was being taken away, he began to “call his friend loudly reminding him of the blood and the bowl.” On hearing his voice, Dandamis immediately went to the enemy’s camp and asked for the release of his friend. When the chief of the Sauromatians demanded a large ransom he answered: “You’ve looted all I had... If you want, take me instead of him and do with me whatever you like.” The Sauromatian ordered his eyes to be put out. At this high price Dan¬ damis regained freedom for his blood brother. Amizokes did not remain indebted. In solidarity with his friend, he blinded himself. After that they lived in honour, receiving food from the Scythian community. Like most ancient peoples, the Scythians believed in magic and worshipped deities which embodied natu¬ ral phenomena; they also held animals in veneration. Unlike the Greeks, the Scythians did not erect temples or statues for their deities; they constructed a special altar for offerings and sacrifices only to their god ofwar. For this purpose they built every year an enormous mound of dry faggots in the open, and on the top they placed an ancient iron sword, a symbol of the Scythian counterpart to the Greek god Ares. The religious rituals of the Scythians consisted mainly of such ceremonies as libations, offerings and sacrifices of horses and other domestic animals. In addition, one of every hundred captives was sacrificed to their god of war. The funeral ceremonies of Scythian kings, who were believed to be descended from the gods, included human sacrifices. As soon as the news of the death of their king reached the Scythians, they started constructing a grave for him. The site ofthe Scythian royal cemetery, as indicated by Herodotus in his account, was in the land of the Gerrhi, who dwelled at the point where the Borysthenes (Dnieper) was first navigable, i.e. near the Dnieper rapids. The internal organs were removed and the cavity filled with a preparation of chopped galingale, frankin¬ cense, parsley-seed and anise-seed. After that the incision was sewn up and the body was coated with wax. It was then carried on a chariot through all the tribes. Finally it was brought to the country of the Gerrhi and laid upon a mattress in the prepared grave; spears were fixed in the ground on either side of the corpse, beams were
13



stretched across them, and the whole covered with a roof of twigs. Along with the king and his valuables, the Scythians buried his guards, domestic servants, cup-bearer, one of his concubines, and some of his horses, all killed in his honour. Then they set to work raising an earthwork above the grave, seeking to make the mound as high as possible. Some Scythian burial mounds are indeed very large and reach a height of 18 to 20 m. Nevertheless, the site of the royal Scythian necropolis mentioned by Herodotus remains unknown. Some unearthed barrows of the fourth century B.C., like the Solokha, Chertomlyk or Tolstaya Mogila tumuli, seem closest to kings’ burials in terms of their splendour. They are located on the lower reaches of the Dnieper, which corresponds to the myste¬ rious land of the Gerrhi indicated by Herodotus. But they are of a later date and differ in some details from the de¬ scription given by the historian. The main difference is that they were not constructed as rectangular pits but are rather complicated underground tombs with deep entrance shafts and long passages leading to burial chambers of the catacomb type. The royal power in the Scythian kingdom was patrimonial, and after the king’s death the throne was tradi¬ tionally taken by his heir. The king was first and foremost the supreme military commander. Together with the chieftains of the tribes he performed the main religious rites. A privileged group was also formed by magicians or soothsayers who divined with the help of sacred willow rods. The Scythians revered the customs of their ancestors and remained faithful to their tribal deities. Adherence to alien religions brought severe punishment or even death to any violator, including members ofthe royal family. Greek colonists in the towns along the shores of the Black Sea knew the fate which had befallen many Scythians who had abandoned their tribal deities for the religion and customs of the Hellenes. Herodotus tells the story ofthe son ofa Scythian king who was murdered by his own brother for veneration ofthe Greek gods and for close relations with the Hellenes. In the sixth century B.C. Anacharsis, son of King Gnurus, travelled to Greece, where he became famous for his profound knowledge of philosophy and other sciences. His name is associated with the invention of the potter’s wheel and the anchor. He is also supposed to have taught the Greeks to drink wine in the Scythian way, undiluted by water. The learned barbarian was known as one of the wisest men in the world. The ship on which he was travelling home was driven by a storm to the harbour of Cyzicus in Asia Minor. This was during the festi¬ val dedicated to the Great Mother ofthe Gods, and the superstitious Scythian made a vow to the goddess that if he returned safe to his country, he w ould sacrifice in the same manner as he had seen. Being a man of his word, he fulfilled the vow and began to perform the rites to the goddess. But in the course of the sacred ceremony he was surprised by his brother Saulius, who shot him with an arrow and killed him. Thus did Anacharsis die, concludes Herodotus, for his “aping of foreign customs and intercourse with the Hellenes”. Eventually the growth of contacts and trade between the Scythians and the Greek colonies brought a no¬ ticeable change in the Scythians’ attitude towards the Hellenic civilization. Some Scythians even succeeded in gaining high repute among the Greeks for their abilities. In the sixth century B.C. the Scythian Toxaris, for example, settled in Athens. Although he was a man of modest means and had no titles ofdistinction, he became a very skilful healer and was posthumously deified by the citizens of Athens. But his real immortality rests on his colourful descriptions of the everyday life, customs and traditions of his native Scythia. Many famous Greek au¬ thors repeated his legends in their own works, but of these only a few tales in Lucian have come down to us. Herodotus tells a second dramatic legend about the cruel punishment meted out to Scythians who betrayed their native beliefs and customs, but in this case the subject is a Scythian king, Skyles. Herodotus describes how Skyles came to prefer the Greek way of life to the Scythian. He lived in Olbia, where he built a house for himself and decorated it with marble statues, wore Greek clothes, spoke Greek and married a Greek woman, and, most important, worshipped Greek gods. Having met him among the Greek inhabitants of Olbia during the festival in honour of Bacchus, the god of wine and merry-making, after he had been initiated in the Bacchic mysteries, the Scythians killed him as a traitor. “Thus”, Herodotus concludes, “the Scythians maintain their own customs, and impose such punishments on those who introduce foreign usages.” The extension of trade and cultural relations with the Greek colonies, however, considerably increased the Hellenic influence upon Scythian culture. By the end of the sixth century B.C. many elements of Greek culture had become part of the everyday life of the Scythian nobles. They used more and more articles of Hellenic origin along with the products of local Scythian craftsmen and revealed an interest in Greek mythology. In turn, Scythian life and artistic imagery became a source of inspiration for artisans in the Greek centres on the Pontic coast. Thus the Scythian world was the inspiration for masterpieces of Greek metalwork with realistic scenes of the nomads' life, which are an invaluable contribution to antique art and world art as a whole. Late in the fifth century B.C. the Scythians built their first stronghold (known as Kamenskoye Gorodishche, on the lower reaches of the Dnieper), which grew into the administrative, manufacturing and trade centre of the Scythian kingdom. This large fortified settlement was inhabited by craftsmen, artisans and mer¬ chants who supplied the Scythians with necessary weapons, jewellery and articles of carved bone. In the fourth century B.C. the Scythian kingdom reached the highest point of its power and wealth. The most outstanding personality among its rulers was king Atheas. During his reign the Scythian state expanded its
14



western borders to the banks of the Danube. In 339 Atheas, still trying to conquer new lands at the age of ninety, led his troops against the Thracians, who inhabited the territory on the right bank of the Danube. The Thracians were rescued by the Macedonian king Philip II, whose army repulsed the Scythians' attack. King Atheas was killed in the battle. Nevertheless, the Scythians soon recovered from this defeat and eight years later, in 331 B.C., summoned a force strong enough to defeat the 30,000-strong Macedonian army of Zopyrion, a general of Alexander the Great, who had laid siege to Olbia. Endless war and internal strife gradually undermined the stability and power of the Scythian kingdom. The Sarmatian nomadic tribes, neighbours of the Scythians, took advantage of the weakening of the Scythian king¬ dom and crossed the Don river invading the Scythian territory. Eventually they completely ousted the Scythians from the area near the Dnieper. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (first century B.C.) described this event as follows: “The Sarmatians grew immensely strong and devastated most of the territory of Scythia, exterminating the population and turning the whole country into a desert.” The former owners of the northern coast of the Pontus Euxinus had to be satisfied with the steppes of the Crimean peninsula, where they found their last refuge. There they built their new capital, Neapolis, on the site of present-day Simferopol. Deprived of the tributes paid to them by the land-tilling tribes living along the Dnieper, the Scythians practically lost the main source of their wealth. In search of other sources of supply, they made an attempt to capture some Greek colonies in the Crimea and take control of the trade in the area. But they failed because military reinforcements sent by the Pontic king Mithridates VI (120-63 B.C.) defeated them in a series of battles. Although this crushing defeat did not result in the final collapse ofthe Scythian kingdom in the Crimea, it marked the beginning of the Scythians' disappearance from the historical scene. The Scythians gradually settled down in the Crimean steppes and turned to agriculture. Eventually they merged with other peoples of this area and lost their tribal identity. The third century A.D. saw the end of the Scythian kingdom; life in their capital of Neapolis came to a halt. After the Scythians had vanished from the stage of world history, the name ‘Scythia' continued for many centuries to denote the territories north ofthe Black Sea in South Russia. The Scythians left to mankind a rich cul¬ tural legacy, which is a subject of ever-increasing interest.






The Artistic Legacy of the Scythians
The lasting artistic value of Scythian antiquities is due to the great variety of superb works of decorative and applied art which belong to different trends and schools. The vast Soviet collections of antiquities done in the socalled Scythian animal style, unique in its refinement and expressiveness, are known throughout the world. Of special interest are the masterpieces of ancient relief metalwork with Scythian motifs and objects in the GraecoBarbarian style manufactured in the Greek colonies on the shores of the Pontus Euxinus (Black Sea). Also note¬ worthy attention are the extremely rare works of art brought by the Scythians from Greece and Asia Minor, as well as some artifacts executed in the mixed Urartian-Scythian style or in the Oriental-Hellenic manner. The Scythian artistic treasures are not only the pride of the Soviet people, but have great significance for all mankind. The distinctive features ofthe art and culture ofthe Scythians were determined by their nomadic way of life. Bom warriors, horsemen and herdsmen, they roamed the boundless steppes near the Black Sea coast with their numerous herds of cattle and horses all year round, their dwellings being covered waggons. It is quite natural that they had no interest in constructing public buildings or temples and did not erect images of their deities. The only kind of monumental art were roughly carved tombstone figures, which the Scythians placed above their chieftains' graves. The sculptures presumably represented their legendary king and ancestor Targitaus, usually depicted as a mighty war-lord clad in Scythian armour, with sword or bow fixed to his belt. In his hand he usually held a sacred vessel as an attribute of the priestly authority of the Scythian kings. The Scythians demonstrated particularly remarkable craftsmanship in the minor arts, producing fine bone carvings, bronzes cast by the cire perdue (lost wax) method and repousse works in gold and silver. The emergence of these decorative arts was connected with the class differentiation in Scythian society, a process which began in the seventh century B.C. The military' leaders forming the upper stratum of the society tried by all possible means to distinguish themselves from their fellow tribesmen and to mark their importance and social superiority with the trappings of wealth and power. In the conditions of nomadic life and frequent mili¬ tary engagements these aims could be best achieved by gold and silver ornaments worn on ceremonial and ritual garments or by richly ornamented weapons and horse attire, toilet articles and ritual utensils. All these objects were decorated with figures of animals or scenes of fighting beasts, which were rendered in a distinctive vivid manner usually called kthe Scythian animal style’. This art, designed to have practical significance, was by nature an applied art, but it had an extremely wide range of expressive symbolic imagery. The zoomorphic images of the Scythians reflected their outlook on the world and expressed the ethical and aesthetic ideals of nomadic warriors. Their ceaseless military campaigns, the constant readiness to repulse an attack and to defend themselves, led the Scythians to cultivate reverence for heroic deeds and valour. It was natural, therefore, that these qualities also embodied the Scythian concept of beauty. It is not merely coincidental that in their depiction of animals obvious preference is given to images of strong and aggressive beasts of prey or to extremely alert or swift-running animals capable of defending themselves. The Scythian belief in the magic power of zoomorphic images also contributed to their choice of animals as subjects of their works of art. Every figure or image executed in the Scythian animal style was considered by the Scythians as a kind of apotropaion,an amulet capable of warding olTdisasters and troubles. The ornamentation of weapons and horse harness with images of strong, swift animals had a special significance because the Scythians believed that such qualities as strength, speed, a keen eye and an acute sense of smell could be transferred from the images to the warrior, his weapon and his horse. Each image apparently had its own concrete meaning, al¬ though it is not easy to identify it now. It is quite obvious that every zoomorphic image was associated with some kind of deity personifying cosmic powers and natural phenomena. It is known from Herodotus' account that the Scythians worshipped the gods of the hearth, fire, sky, earth, sun and war. Lack of detailed information about the Scythian deities, however, makes it impossible to link a particular image in the animal style to a definite deity of the Scythian religious pantheon with any degree of certainty. In the mythology of the congeneric Indo-Iranian tribes, one animal could symbolize several different gods and, conversely, each deity was invested with the capacity of reincarnation as several animals. The sun, for instance, which struck people’s imagination with its swift movement, was interpreted either as a soaring bird, as a stag with golden antlers or as a galloping horse. All these images were represented in the stock of motifs of the Scythian style. Scythian art, like the whole of Scythian culture, may be divided into three periods: early Scythian or archaic (seventh and sixth centuries B.C.), middle Scythian (fifth and fourth centuries B.C.) and late Scythian (late fourth and early third centuries B.C.). Each period had its own peculiar features in style and subject matter. In the course of time specific motifs appeared or disappeared and the shapes underwent a number of changes. Even in the archaic period the animal style seemed to be a natural blend of the unique Scythian artistic tra¬ dition and certain borrowed forms, mostly of ancient Oriental origin. The range of imagery was based on the notions of the animal world and included both real animals and fan¬ tastic beasts, the latter often whimsically incorporating dissimilar parts taken from different beasts. Thus, figures of members of the cat family, images of stags, ibexes, elks and birds of prey were introduced to Scythian art. Cer¬ tain parts of animals' bodies symbolizing their main qualities were also used as independent motifs. The most favoured subjects were heads of beasts, birds, rams, and horses, or simply a horse’s hooves or an animal’s ears.

Two imaginary creatures, specific to the Scythians, were predominant in their art. One of these originated in Scythian mythology and resembled a (lying ram with the beak of a bird of prey. The other one, the griffin - a winged lion, generally with an eagle’s head - was created by the fantasy of Oriental peoples. The Scythian antiq¬ uities of the archaic period usually depict only the avian head of the monster with a beast’s ears and a long pro¬ jecting tongue. Naturally, the Scythians invested this borrowed Oriental motif with their own meaning. The dreadful appearance of the monster carried the idea of the indomitable power and unconquerable spirit that per¬ meated the nomad's entire perception of the world. The subjects of ancient Oriental origin which were borrowed by the Scythians included the already men¬ tioned felines, most likely panthers, as well as ibexes - animals which are unknown in the area to the north of the Black Sea. The Scythians did not simply copy the borrowed subjects, but re-interpreted them according to their own stylistic precepts. The images of animals in Scythian art were subject to a canon of artistic representation. Predatory beasts were shown in upright position, with their muzzles bent to the ground as if they were tracking their prey or curled up so that their rear paws touched the muzzles. An ancient Oriental heraldic composition, two figures of rampant beasts facing each other, also occurred in Scythian art. Standard stylistic devices were used widely in the treat¬ ment of details; for instance, the ends of the paws and tails were denoted as a rule by circles and ovals. Stags and ibexes were depicted in a recumbent position with their legs drawn under their bodies, and ibexes, moreover, were shown with their heads turned back, which made them reminiscent of their ancient Oriental prototypes. The species of animals were designated by one or two distinctive features. The stag, for instance, can be easily identified by its stretched-forward head with many-tined antlers laid back along its spine. The ibex can be recognized by its slanted muzzle, large sickle-shaped horns and sometimes a liule beard. In interpreting birds of prey (most likely eagles), craftsmen generally restricted themselves to depicting their heads. Images of birds with outspread wings are rare. In side views of birds’ heads the Scythians usually emphasized large round eyes and hooked predatory beaks. One particularly interesting example is an eagle’s head sculpted of bone: its eyes are surrounded by styl¬ ized miniature figures of hoofed animals. This figurine, one of the oldest specimens of the animal style, reveals a tendency of Scythian craftsmen to use zoomorphic ornamentation in their compositions. They did not, however, introduce additional animal motifs simply for decorative effect. This was apparently done to increase the magical powers of the image by transforming it into a symbolic creature endowed with the qualities of several animals. This stylistic and perceptual device vividly illustrates the originality of Scythian artistic interpretation. The compositional arrangement in Scythian works of art was often determined by the form and shape ofthe material. The creators of the animal style always attempted to use enclosed, compact forms to fit their images into the available space. Thus, for example, the image of a curled-up beast of prey became a customary compositional scheme for ornamenting round surfaces. This motif occurs on a great variety of Scythian artifacts. An example may be seen in the decoration of the upper part of a bone eye-bar, part of a horse bridle of the early Scythian period (the four eyelets cut out at its sides served as guides for the reins). The carved bone tips which were attached to wooden bits, snaffles and cylindrical bridle pieces are another noteworthy example of form determined by application. They were ingeniously transformed into miniature heads of rams, rum-birds and goats, whose short necks had eyelets for the reins and pins. The designs of ancient Scythian bri Jie bits and cheek-pieces were dictated by strict constructional logic. The tip of one of these is carved as a horse’s head w ith its muzzle stretched forward and a long ear bent to the neck. The craftsman revealed a fine sense of plasticity fitting the head into the plaque's general structure which, according to convention, stands for the body of the animal. This device allowed him to create the image ofa swiftly flying horse. The tip ofanother bit was sculptured in the form of an intricately stylized head ofa ram, with a hoof and a horn sharply coiled around its eye. The motif of the hoof was also a magic symbol expected to quicken the gait of a horse. The amazing variety of different plastic and compositional designs is illustrated by a number of bronze pole-tops typical of Scythian art. They were intended for use in ritual ceremonies. The interior ofthe pole-top was filled with little balls and suspended bells, which produced a clanging sound believed by the Scythians to frighten away evil spirits. Sometimes the pole-top was made in the form of the head of a horse or a mule with pointed ears as if on the alert. In other cases an openwork body containing a bell was crowned by the head of a fantastic bird with a ram’s horn and a protruding, seemingly trembling tongue. Most of these clanging pole-tops were recovered from the graves of Scythian war-lords alongside remnants of sacrificed horses. This indicates that the pole-tops were linked with the cult of the horse. In spite of all the rigorous convention of Scythian composition, their early representations of animals demonstrate a realistic style and a deep knowledge of nature. The ability of the ancient craftsmen to perceive the essence of each animal and to capture its specific features is worthy of admiration. The Scythian craftsmen did not actually copy nature, but created a typical pattern by hyperbolization and stylization. Thus, the combina¬ tion of lifelike authenticity writh a stylization and generalization of fornix became a distinctive feature of early Scythian art.

One of the most exquisite works of the animal style, truly its classical standard, is the golden plaque found in the Kostromskaya barrow, which was evidently used as a shield emblem by a Scythian chieftain. This plaque, chased in high relief, shows a recumbent stag with its legs drawn up under its body. The precise outline and the generalization of form enhance the expressiveness and sense of movement of the image. The raised head of the stag, its antlers spread along its entire back, its outstretched neck, its sharply defined muscles - all this makes the sense of the animal's internal energy, power and instinctive alertness even greater. The difficult task of conveying this idea in a conventionalized and at the same time realistic manner has been successfully solved in a precise decorative form. The integrity of the composition and the intricately decorative pattern of scrolls on the antlers enhance this impression of harmony. The round eye and the leaf-shaped ear of the stag were originally decorated with inlays of coloured paste. Among the artifacts of the early Scythian period the gold figure of a panther from the Kelermes barrow occupies a unique place. The artistic treatment of this figure accentuates the aggressive character of the beast. Its tremendous strength and constant readiness to attack are revealed in its alert pose and in the angle of the head with its threatening display of teeth. The most interesting thing about this work is that it is a fusion of the Scythian and Oriental styles. The craftsman must have been well versed in the art of Asia Minor. His adherence to the Oriental motifs is evident in his choice of the panther as his subject and in the use of coloured inlays for orna¬ menting the ear, eye and nostrils, as well as in the departure from the strict profile view of the figure - the beast is shown from another angle, with all its four paws visible. Nevertheless, these minor divergencies from the conven¬ tional rules of Scythian art do not alter the genuinely Scythian nature of the Kelermes panther. This is clearly demonstrated by the specific pose of the animal, by the use of light and shade and most of all by the zoomorphic stylization of the details. The tail and the lower parts of the beast's paws are covered with the minuscule figures of curled felines, ten in all. These images were apparently intended to increase the magic power of this amulet. Of great value for the comprehension of the atmosphere in which Scythian art was formed are the priceless finds of the Melgunov (or Litoi) and Kelermes barrows. These rich sepulchres of the late seventh and early sixth centuries B.C. were constructed for the Scythian supreme rulers who participated in the military expeditions to Asia Minor. The superb artifacts found in these barrows are all the more striking because of the number of differ¬ ent stylistic manners they represent. It is most likely that during their temporary stay in Asia Minor the Scythian nobility quite eagerly engaged the services not only of their own craftsmen, but also of artisans from various West Asian and Oriental centres. Illustrative in this respect is the above-mentioned burial mound of the Scythian chieftain who was the owner of the gold panther plaque. The presence of articles executed in the animal style alongside metalwork belonging to other traditions suggests the diversity of his artistic tastes. Three objects of the latter group are of par¬ ticular interest. They include one of two nested bowls (one fitting into the other), a battle-axe and a sword. The hemispherical body of the inner bowl is ornamented with three rows of friezes with embossed designs. The upper frieze depicts a procession of striding birds which look like bustards, a favourite motif in Assyrian glyptics. The middle frieze also depicts a scene typical for the Ancient Orient: a wolf chasing a she-goat and a lion tearing a stag. The lower frieze shows a stag, a wild boar, and recumbent goats with their legs drawn under their bodies. The bot¬ tom of the bowl is decorated with an embossed rosette, which is a symbol of the life-giving sun. Although the poses of the animals depicted in the lower frieze and the presence of a stag among them sug¬ gest the Scythian animal style, the technique of execution and principles of stylization are quite alien to Scythian art. The stiff, naturalistic treatment of the bodies and their intentionally accentuated ribs, meticulously marked hair and other minor details all reveal the hand of an ancient Oriental craftsman, an adherent of the Assyrian school of art. It seems that these libation bowls may have been commissioned from him by a high-ranking Scyth¬ ian, simultaneoulsy performing the duties of commander and priest. The bladed head and wooden handle of the iron battle-axe are covered with gold overlays modelled in relief. They are dominated by images of various animals in different poses - bulls, wild boars, goats, stags, pan¬ thers, a horse with a bridle and a fantastic beast with its paws transformed, in truly Scythian fashion, into birds' heads. In spite of the presence of these and a number of other Scythian motifs the general scheme is overbur¬ dened with images, which is a characteristic of Oriental art. The compositional principles of ancient Oriental art are reflected in the symmetrical positioning of the goats (the only sculptured group of the decoration) on the back pan of the head, in the goats at the sides of the sacred Tree of Life and, finally, in the figure of a man with a battle-axe. The images are clearly on the borderline between the Scythian and ancient Oriental artistic styles. The execution of the images is not so overtly naturalistic as in the treatment of the libation bowl and not so laconic as it customarily is in Scythian works. The muscles of the animals' haunches are shown by double contour lines while backbone, ears and hair are marked by hatching. The difference between the Ancient Oriental and the Scythian artistic conceptions is visually demonstrated by the decorative finish of the sword and scabbard. It is covered with high-relief gold plaques done in an eclectic style. Heads of eagles stylized in a Scythian manner and a clearly Scythian stag are surrounded by mythological figures borrowed from the ancient Oriental pantheon. The images typical for Oriental art include winged deities standing by the Tree of Life and fantastic beasts some of which are shooting from bows. The frightful monsters

have lions’ bodies, griffins’, goats’ or bulls’ heads, and toothed fish in place of wings. One cannot help noticing an unnatural fusion of two styles in this work. The detailed ornamental depiction of the bodies of fantastic creatures contrasts sharply with the generalized and laconic treatment of the little figure of the recumbent stag. The overall character of the relief patterns clearly shows the predominance of the Ancient Oriental, or, to be more precise, Urartian style. While using his traditional technique, the Urartian craftsman did his utmost to meet the require¬ ments and tastes of the Scythian customer. This accounts for the presence of the stag motif on the sheath, so popular with the Scythians and obviously copied from a Scythian prototype. Artifacts of ancient Oriental work¬ manship, similar to those found in the Kelermes burial, apparently were the main source from which the creators of the animal style derived certain compositional schemes and motifs. Yet another interesting group of toreutics from Asia Minor was recovered from the Kelermes and Melgunov barrows. It mainly consists of decorative elements for the legs, elbow-rests and seats of ceremonial stools of the Urartian-Assyrian kind. The three-dimensional decorative details of this furniture (heads of lions and goats, pomegranates, petals, etc.) are combined with elements decorated by means of granulation techniques or inlaid with enamel or amber. The graves of Scythian chieftains in the Melgunov and Kelermes barrows also contained marvellous arti¬ facts of the Graeco-Oriental style. One of the best specimens of this style is a gold diadem in the shape of a crown with drop-like pendants and encrusted rosettes, whose petals were originally inlaid with coloured enamels. The sculptured head of a griffin, its neck plumage rendered in gold filigree, interrupts the monotony of the row of rosettes and gives the diadem a particular ceremonial quality. Also belonging to this artistic current are a gold relief overlay for an unidentified object and a cast silver mirror. The figures on the overlay - two wading herons and a monkey with a human hand - are of exquisite gracefulness. A fine specimen of metalwork is a round silver mirror with a fragment of a central ring handle. The reverse side of the silver disk is covered with electrum plates decorated with fine designs. The composition of the image is truly overburdened with ornamental and figurative motifs and is centred around a winged female figure, Cybele, the Great Goddess of Asia Minor and the queen of the animals. She is surrounded by fantastic sphinxes and griffins as well as by recumbent, running or fighting animals - lions, a fox, a bear and others. The iconography ofthe images, the meticulous attention to detail (rendering ofanimal hair by subtle hatch¬ ing) and other stylistic devices are quite typical for the Graeco-Oriental school of metalwork. At the same time two motifs, a standing panther with curled claws and a ram with its leg under the body, are typically Scythian artis¬ tic images. The mirror itself is also Scythian in design, although its decorator undoubtedly was a Greek crafts¬ man. Complying with the request of his Scythian client, he embellished the mirror with electrum plates and did his utmost to meet Scythian tastes in their decoration. The influence of Greek culture on the Scythian world was especially pronounced after the nomads’ expedi¬ tions into Asia Minor. In the first half of the sixth century B.C. a number of Greek colonies appeared on the Kerch Strait and along the Black Sea coast, which were founded predominantly by migrants from the Ionian cities. From that time the impact of the mighty antique civilization became a steady factor in the history of Scyth¬ ia. But the Greeks had known about these lands and the population of the northern shores of the Black Sea long before permanent Greek colonies were set up. Colonization was preceded by a long period of chance visits of Greeks who had undertaken the risky voyages from the Aegean Sea to the Pontus Euxinus. This was followed by a period of slowly developing trade relations between Greek maritime traders and the upper stratum of the barbarian society. The Greek merchants offered a number of goods which had been unknown to the Scythians: fine painted vases, richly chased metal vessels, beautiful textiles, graceful personal adornments, decorated wea¬ pons, as well as olive oil and grape-wine. They traded these goods for grain (Greece was always in need of grain), wool, hides and slaves. The trade contacts with the Greek merchants prior to the establishment of their colonies on the Black Sea coast are clearly illustrated by material from the excavation of the Temir-Gora barrow near the present-day town of Kerch. Alongside superb sculptured decorations in bone, such as the already mentioned head of a bird of prey and the coiled beast, both executed in the Scythian animal style, archaeologists discovered a painted terracotta vessel (oenochoe) of surpassing beauty. It belongs to the so-called Rhodian-Ionian pottery popular in Ionia in the seventh century B.C. The yellowish surface of the vessel looks as if it were covered with the mottled pattern of an Oriental rug. The neck of the vessel is decorated with an ornamental linear pattern of meander, and its body is adorned with friezes. The upper frieze shows a panther approaching a bull and the sides of the vessel are embel¬ lished with goats. The lower part of the vessel bears a lanceolate pattern, while the friezes are separated by bands of intertwining lines. The free space between the animals is also ornamented with rosettes, swastikas, diamonds and crosses. The decoration shows that the potter followed the traditional orientalizing scheme of the developed Graeco-Ionian style. But at the same time the images of the panther and the bull are obviously derived from the metalwork of ancient Persia. The animals are rendered with great care and confidence, and the depiction is remarkable for its plasticity and beauty. Although the figures are rather conventional and generalized, they fully retain their lifelike charm and vivacity. The composition of the decor, its motifs and type of ornamentation as well as the specific style of its
20



brush painting in dark-brown varnish fully correspond to the character ofdecoration used in Rhodian-Ionian pot¬ tery' in the third quarter of the seventh century B.C. It is worth noting that this masterpiece of Greek an had fallen into the hands of a Scythian ruler prior to the appearance of Greek towns and colonies in the area ofthe Kerch Strait (Bosporus Cimmerius). After the colonies had been founded in the coastal area of the Black Sea in the sixth century’, many wonderful overseas items made of metal or clay were exported to remote areas of Scythia by ship, via the rivers Dnieper, Bug, Don and Kuban and their navigable tributaries. The Greek merchants also made use of the land routes which ran from Olbia across the vast territory of Scylhia to the East. It is likely that the unique masterpieces of antique toreutics which were found in the barrows of Martonoshy and Annovka in the Ukrainian SSR were brought to the Scythian terri¬ tory from the Greek colony of Olbia. A magnificent Ionian bronze krater is of particular interest. Its volute Pi. 55 handles are decorated with running figures of the Gorgon Medusa. The handles and decorations were cast in a mould forming the outside of a wax model, the standard method employed by Greek craftsmen. They could use the mould for only one item. The other barrow yielded a fine bronze mirror with a sculptured handle in the form of the nude goddess Aphrodite, whose raised hands support its disk. Thus, imported luxury' goods first found their way by sea from mainland and insular Greece directly to the Pi. 51 Scythian nobility; later such goods were brought from the neighbouring centres of the Black Sea coast. In the second half of the sixth century B.C. a large number of workshops catering to the tastes and demands of the barbarian aristocracy emerged in Olbia, Panticapaeum and other coastal Greek towns. Their products Pi. 52 included, for example, cast bronze mirrors of Greek design, with long handles decorated with figures or heads of animals according to Scythian prototypes. A cross-shaped bronze plaque, evidently part of a quiver, was manufactured in one of these Greek towns. Pi. is despite its traditional Scythian motif. The Greek craftsman, however, was not as much interested in the depiction of an animal as in purely decorative effect. The abundant hatching used to depict the heads of birds and goats around the curled-up beast and the whole arrangement of the relief images produce a vivid ornamental impres¬ sion. During the late archaic period (turn of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.) the tendency towards ornamental decorativeness in Scythian art itself gradually increased as well. One of the most remarkable works of this period is a bronze pole-top found in the Ulsky barrow, which is Pi. 58 cast in the form of a stylized head of a bird of prey. The imagery of this monumental piece is based on its wellbalanced proportions and rhythmic dynamism, as well as on the wealth and plasticity of its forms, which are so carefully integrated with the overall design. The eagles' heads, vary ing in size, with circular eyes and spiral beaks, give the impression of a dense and elaborate pattern. This ornamentation is in sharp contrast to the realism found in the image of a recumbent goat and a small bird's head (faintly visible under the goat's chin), and especially in the enormous eye of a bird, which betrays an influence of Greek naturalism. This is undoubtedly an apotropaion intended to guard against evil spirits. For the Scythians, the bronze pole-top was clearly a powerful amulet sup¬ posed to ward off evil spirits by its frightening appearance and ringing bells.

The fifth century B.C. (middle Scythian period) saw substantial changes in Scythian art. These were reflected both in the choice of animal motifs and in the manner of their execution. The emergence of new forms occurred under the steadily increasing impact of Greek art and the simultaneously declining influence of West Asian and particularly Assyrian-Urartian art. In the course of time, the deep-rooted tendency of Scythian applied an towards ornamentation and decorative stylization gained new impetus. It is largely owing to this that scholars have named this epoch the age of Scythian baroque. In their subject matter, forms and manner of execution, all the works ofthe Scythian animal style executed in the first half of the fifth century B.C. are, as a rule, still very close to earlier specimens. Nevertheless, they clearly reveal certain new features which will later develop into the fundamental traits of the middle period. Thus, for instance, bronze bridle ornaments from the barrows near the village of Zhurovka, whatever their shape - stags’ heads, recumbent elks or feline beasts - all have clear-cut, laconic forms without meticulous ren¬ dering of anatomical detail. Although certain parts of the body are conveyed as large relief planes, the specific fea¬ tures of each animal are always accentuated: the frightening teeth and the enormous claws of a beast of prey, the big, alert ears and tossed-back head of a hoofed animal. The same features can be observed in the heads of a bird and a recumbent stag on the gold overlays of wooden vessel from the Ak-Mechet barrow. Nevertheless, the same artifacts display a pronounced tendency of Scythian art towards decorative stylization of images - a ten¬ dency that was obviously inspired by Greek art. The result was a fusion of various zoomorphic images with floral patterns. The most common ornamental motif, constantly reinterpreted with astounding inventiveness, was the head of a bird, with a large round eye and a volute-shaped beak. Quite remarkable in this connection is the treat¬ ment of the stag's antlers on the gold plaque mentioned above. The antlers are in fact a fantastically arranged bunch of tiny birds' heads and petals of the antique palmette gathered around the animal’s ear. During this period such subjects as horses, ibexes, rams and ram-birds disappeared or became rare. But at the same time the Scythian artistic repertory was enriched by new motifs, both local and borrowed. The images of lions, wolves, wild boars and hares began to appear on gold and bronze wares, alongside fantastic creatures such as griffins with eagle’s or lion's heads. The enrichment of the repertory was also connected with the introduction of so-called ‘zoomorphic transformations'. While in the archaic period this device had been used with discretion, in the new period heads, hooves, legs and claws became independent and artistically finished motifs. In the course of time, these zoomorphic images gained the dominant position among Scythian themes, which testifies to their growing significance as amulets and magic charms. This unnatural emphasis on certain parts of the ani¬ mal body also contributed to the tendency towards ornamentation and stylization. More and more often addi¬ tional symbolic elements were introduced into the structure of the main image. These elements were representa¬ tion of other animals or certain parts of their bodies. They were placed as a rule on the shoulders and hips as well as on the feet, horns and tail of the beast. All these specific features can be well demonstrated by a bronze openwork plaque in the shape of a wolf, which was found in the Kulakovsky barrow in the Crimea. The image of this beast was brought to Scythian art from the Sauromatian world. Although iconographically alien to Scythian art, the motif was modified in this case to fit Scythian standards. The craftsman used the most logical compositional scheme for the decoration of a round-shaped object - a beast of prey coiled up in a circle, which perfectly fitted the shape of the object. In accordance with the representational principle ofthe time, the animal's proportions are somewhat distorted - the neck and other parts of its body are elongated. At the same time the deliberate enlargement of the eye and the ear is reminiscent of archaic images. The figure is covered with a large number of additional zoomorphic elements including, on the wolfs shoulder, a goat in its customary pose with the head turned backwards. The other sym¬ bols - a head of an elk and a number of the stylized eagle’s heads - are placed on the shoulder, hip, tail and paws of the beast. The birds' beaks, rhythimically arranged in groups on each paw, seem to merge with the wolfs claws, enhancing their symbolic importance. Although this image may lack the vigour of the stag from the Kostromskaya barrow or of the panther from the Kelermes barrow, it nevertheless demonstrates the organic blend of realistic features and ornamental designs characteristic ofthe Scythian animal style ofthat period. The craftsmen, forced to adjust their skill to the predetermined shapes of their wares, became accustomed to enclosed arrange¬ ments of figures and to their generalized depiction, which led to a certain amount of distortion for artistic effect. From the mid-fifth century B.C. onwards, the influence of classical Hellenic art on the Scythian animal style substantially increased owing to the more extensive use of Greek wares by the Scythian nobility, especially those who lived in the vicinity of the Bosporan cities. If earlier only rare samples of Greek workmanship had reached Scythia, they now became widely used by the local nobility in its daily life. This is confirmed by the exca¬ vations of the famous Seven Brothers barrows on the Taman peninsula, which yielded many articles of that type. Similar objects were also found in the Scythian barrows of the ancient necropolis of Nymphaeum near Kerch. They include richly decorated weapons, torques and bronze adornments of Scythian horse harness as well as various objects, some of high artistic value, imported to the Bosporan centres from Greece, Etruria, Asia Minor and other areas. Thus, for example, the Seven Brothers barrows yielded a whole series of remarkable vessels made of pre¬ cious metals. Among them were silver and gold rhytons with finials in the form of sculptured half-figures or

heads of animals, which had been obviously imported from Achaemenid Persia, and very rare silver-gilt Attic bowls, kylikes, notable for their decor and execution. The interiors of the kylikes are decorated with exquisite engravings based on Greek mythological or literary subjects. In style they are very close to contemporary redfigure vases which were produced by the famous Athenian miniaturists. Another interesting artifact is a silver kylix of the third quarter of the fifth century B.C., with a multifigured composition in the central part of a medal¬ lion. It probably depicts a scene from the story of Odysseus and Penelope. Even more imported artifacts of the high classical period were discovered in the Nymphaeum barrows in the Crimea. Alongside a number of the finest black-lacquered and red-figure vases, the barrows yielded wonder¬ ful bronze artifacts from the Greek centres in Italy (Magna Graecia). A red-figure vessel, a skyphos, depicting a standing woman clad in a tunic and mantle, with a thyrsus in her hand, and a woman holding a bowl on the other side, was undoubtedly painted by a skilful Athenian craftsman about the middle of the fifth century B.C. Etruria is the source of a superlative bronze wine-sieve of the first quarter of the fifth century B.C. The highrelief figure of a Siren standing in the halo of her raised wings is its main adornment. The sieve is marvellously decorated with an exquisite pattern of engraved volutes and palmettes. A bronze oenochoe, which is noteworthy for its rare decoration, was produced in one of workshops of Magna Graecia (Southern Italy). The upper part of the handle portrays the bearded figure of Silenus, lying with his head on an amphora. The lower part of the handle depicts a seated boy framed by an intricate floral ornament of inlaid silver. One of the workshops of Magna Graecia, most likely in the town of Locri, a renowned metal-working centre, produced the marvellous figurine ofan athlete designed to crown a bronze candelabrum made in the form of tripod. The depiction of triumphant athletes, winners in sport competitions, was a leading theme in Greek art of the fifth century B.C. The numerous surviving figurines of athletes are probably small-size reproductions of the statues which were placed in the temples of the athletes’ native towns or in sanctuaries on the sites of competi¬ tions. Among artifacts of this kind, the miniature from Nymphaeum is an outstanding specimen of the so-called ‘austere style’; it imitates a statue by the great Greek sculptor Polykleitos. A well-preserved Panathenaic amphora was found in the grave of a Maeotian chieftain in the Yelizavetinskaya barrow. Vessels of this type served as awards to the winners of sporting events held in Athens once every four years in honour of Pallas Athena, patroness of the city. One side of the black-figure amphora shows the ma¬ jestic figure of Athena and the other depicts the conclusion of a boxing match. All these artifacts testify to the great wealth of the Sindo-Maeotian and Scythian chieftains and to their extensive trade and cultural contacts with the Greek centres in the coastal areas of the Black Sea in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. It is perhaps surprising that the barbarian chieftains had developed the discriminating taste required to appreciate the fine Greek works which are so common among their imports. But it helps to explain the steadily growing influence of classical art on the local tradition and, in particular, on the development of the Scythian animal style. Owing to the introduction of a more realistic, sometimes even naturalistic treatment of details, a new stylis¬ tic trend emerged in Scythian art. At the same time, the techniques of decorative stylization were being enriched by elements borrowed from classical art and by the fashion for zoomorphic transformations, often carried to extremes. A set of bronze bridle adornments recovered from the same Nymphaeum and Seven Brothers barrows demonstrate these trends. They are characterized by an original treatment of traditional Scythian subjects and by the unusual character of their plastic forms. They include a number of plaques in the form of heads of lions, grif¬ fins and wild boars, full-size figures of beasts, elks and stags, as well as images of fantastic creatures synthesized from the features of a griffin and a ram (the ram-bird) or a griffin and a stag (the bird-stag), etc. The generalized representations of animals’ heads continue to retain the realistic features typical of early Scythian art. However, it is precisely these representations that reveal, for ther first time, conventional ornamen¬ tation in the rendering of detail, indicating a desire to give the image a certain integrity. Thus, the bronze bridle plaques in the form of lions' heads found in the Nymphaeum barrows differ from earlier ornaments from the Zhurovka barrow in that the lions have manes. Although treated schematically, almost conventionally, by oblique lines on a low raised field, it adds an important realistic touch to the image, which allows one to distinguish the lion from other feline beasts. In some cases animal eyes and ears are modelled in a more natural way. Protruding rounded eyes are replaced by almond-shaped ones with clearly outlined pupils; at times they are elongated by means of oblique incised lines, as was done on relief plaques in the form of wild boars’ heads. The wing-shaped ears are often cov¬ ered by deep incisions imitating animal hair. Such naturalistic treatment is noticeable on the chamfron (headpiece of a horse's armour) ornaments found in the Seven Brothers barrows, done in the form of stags’ heads. A bronze head of bird, taken from the Seven Brothers barrows, is one ofthe finest masterpieces in this natu¬ ralistic style. This chased plaque is done in a manner that is at once realistically generalized and decorative, in a combination determined by its functional use. The highly defined arrangement of the zoomorphic elements and
62



the ornamental pattern of antique palmette lend the bird and the whole image an exceptional expressiveness and finished look. This perception is not even disturbed by the substitution of a ram’s horn for the bird's beak, because of which the image has been called the grifiln-ram. A similarly fantastic fusion of different animal motifs is seen in a bronze chamfron in the shape of a birdstag. The menacing head of a griffin with a large protruding eye is placed on a powerful stag’s neck, which in turn rests on a rectangular plate imitating a w ing. The head is crowned by antlers branching upwards in stylized floral ornaments. A final example ofthe combination of different images on a bridle plaque is the delicately modelled head of a stag. Its antlers are composed of three small eagles’ heads and the petals of a palmette. The variety of zoomorphic elements interwoven with palmettes, volutes and rosettes in bridle sets is infinite. Nevertheless, the composi¬ tional scheme of the image is always determined by a single artistic consideration - its decorative effect. All these features are equally characteristic of the full figures of animals, among which hoofed animals and beasts of prey remained popular. Some bronze ornaments of bridles from the Seven Brothers barrows are quite unique in their design, although they depict traditional subjects. They seem to represent a local variation typical of the lower reaches of the Kuban river. Stags and elks are generally shown with their legs folded under their bodies, their heads turned backwards and their antlers branching in a fan-like shape. Unlike the archaic examples, the side-view depiction of animals occupies two planes - the head is shown against the body, and both pairs of legs are in full view. Pursuing purely decorative aims, craftsmen in each case designed a composition in such a way that it united the softly modelled individual parts ofthe body with the ornamentation. In all this one can see the impact of classical Greek art. There are only slight visual deviations from the total symmetry. The centre of the composition is always a round eye, harmoniously fitted into the base of a palmette which is formed by the animal’s antlers. The stag’s antlers are always especially sumptuous, whereas the elk’s are treated more laconically. In both cases, however, the inner points of the antlers are stylized as birds’ heads. Ingenious devices are also used for the depiction of other beasts, particularly the lion and the panther. Bronze bridle bits might take the form of springing beasts. Shaping the ornament to fit its function (it passed through an iron ring), the artisan made the middle part of the body disproportionately large, and gave its hind part a twist. This made the figure expressive and dynamic and gave it the proper appearance of agility. All this is in full accord with the realistic rendering of some of the details and of the subject as a whole. The fifth century B.C. saw the introduction into the Scythian animal style, evidently again through the Greeks, of a new theme, that of fighting animals, which had originated in the art of the Ancient Orient. The gold overlays of rhytons unearthed from the Seven Brothers barrows show vibrant scenes of beasts and fantastic winged creatures attacking peacefully grazing animals. Stylistically, these images are still very close to late archaic examples because they have the same clear-cut forms of relief, the modelling of bodies in two planes and the rigid manner of depicting the wings. At the same time the treatment of the poses, foreshortenings and details is quite realistic. The plastic modelling and the choice of themes reveal an amazing combination of Greek and Oriental elements adapted to local Scythian traditions. The gold overlays which show a winged lion tearing a goat or the image of Senmurv, a fantastic creature in the form of dog-bird, suggest Persian influence, while the addi¬ tional ornamentation is in the Greek manner. The stag’s antlers are also stylized as an antique palmette with long offshoots. At the same time the wing of Senmurv is replaced by a bird’s head in accordance with the rules of zoomorphic transformations adopted by Scythian art. The originality of the local artist is revealed in the free spatial disposition of the scenes on the surface of the plate, which retains considerable blank space. Gold applique work sewn on formal garments and on funeral shrouds enjoyed great popularity with barbar¬ ian nobility. Thousands of such articles survive, displaying a distinct evolution in subject matter and style. The earliest specimens, found in the Nymphaeum and Seven Brothers barrows, are distinguished by their fine chas¬ ing, sharp outlines and variety of forms and subjects. Besides the traditional animal motifs widely represented in bronzework, one can see here a number of subjects new to the Scythians in the fifth century B.C., again derived from Greek mythology. These include the head of Athena and her constant companions, an owl and the Gorgon Medusa, images related to the cult ofofferings, such as the cockerel and the bull's head (bucranium), and fantastic creatures - the sphinx, Silenus and many others. Thus the Scythian animal style became much more complicated owing to the wide penetration of Greek motifs, artistic devices and even whole subjects. At the same it was also enriched by the realistic treatment of details and various floral elements of ornamentation.

Even greater alterations in Scythian art took place in the years that followed. In the fourth century B.C. the Scythian kingdom reached its zenith, and its contacts with the Greek colonies along the northern coastal area of the Black Sea greatly intensified. The centre of Scythian art then shifted to the Bosporan kingdom and especially to its capital Panticapaeum, where numerous workshops manufactured articles for the barbarian nobility. As the importation of Bosporan works of art attained mass scale, the Graeco-Scythian style, which had been remarkable in the previous epoch, acquired a completely new tinge. Bridles, armour, ritual paraphernalia and other articles formerly ornamented in the animal style now began to be decorated with anthropomorphic images of Scythian gods, mythical heroes, and religious and epic scenes. Multifigure, frieze-shaped compositions also gained popu¬ lar acceptance. Adornments for the formal robes worn by men and women of distinction during solemn rites or burial ceremonies became common. All these representations in the animal style served primarily a decorative purpose; their symbolic importance was substantially reduced. The royal barrows and the sepulchres of the Hellenized upper classes of the Scythians have yielded a great number of artifacts dating from this golden age of Scythian art. Among these countless objects one can see items of different origin: articles of Scythian workmanship are found side by side with purely Hellenic works as well as with objects made by Greek craftsmen in accordance with Scythian tradition. These artifacts of the mixed Grae¬ co-Barbarian style are usually exceptionally ingenious. Executed in the classical forms of Greek realism, they were fully in accordance with the tastes and demands of the Scythian nobility. Many objects of gold and silver used on festive occasions are of this category. The gold shield plaque in the shape ofa recumbent stag, found in the Kul-Oba barrow, is a fine specimen of fourth-century Greek craftsmanship. It shows the influence of Scythian archaic works of the type exemplified by the Kostromskaya stag. While trying to imitate the scheme of the ancient original, which was a kind of eternal symbol of the Scythians, the craftsman treated it in a completely new stylistic manner. The main image is char¬ acterized by an emphasis on ornamentation, and somewhat dry, regular geometric shapes. At the same time the additional zoomorphic symbols are executed not in the conventional Scythian technique, but in the realistic Greek manner. Neither does their distribution on the stag’s body correspond to Scythian criteria (usually the ani¬ mals were placed on the shoulder of the main image and the birds on its tail). The images of a griffin, a hare, a lion and a dog, which undoubtedly represent particular concepts, are not directly linked with the central figure. Traditional motifs and compositional schemes typical of Scythian animal art did not experience any considerable changes in this period as compared to the prior one. And yet some new images ofanimals, birds and insects emerged in Scythian art - the dog, sheep, duck, swan, cockerel, grasshopper and fly; images of bulls, hares and especially of lions become more widespread than before. The artistic inventory was augmented by for¬ merly unknown subjects taken from Greek mythology: Pegasus (the winged horse), hippocampus (the sea horse or dragon), satyrs and maenads (priestesses of Dionysus). Animal motifs were now found on numerous purely ornamental plaques used as appliques to formal dress, mantles and curtains as well as on narrow plaques for ritual men’s and women’s head-dress, diadems and calathi (head-gear of Greek priestesses), link bracelets and other items. Executed in low relief by using the simplest tech¬ nique of embossing or stamping, they are distinguished as a rule by their realistic rendering of forms, perfect plasticity and soft modelling. Some of the plaques from the Kul-Oba barrow, for example, are of a high artistic standard, for Greek craftsmen fashioned small objects as meticulously as works on a monumental scale. Greek toreutic art of the fourth century B.C. displays a great variety of multifigurc compositions with different or repeated scenes of preying animals. Two shallow gold libation bowls, phialae from the Kul-Oba and Solokha barrows, are outstanding specimens of this kind of work. Their external surfaces are entirely covered with rich relief patterns. The Kul-Oba bowl bears rhythmically arranged bands of chased friezes with twelve panthers’ heads, twelve heads of the Gorgon Medusa, twenty-four masks of bearded Sileni, forty-eight figures of wild boars and ninety-six bees. A narrow ornamental band around the basin is decorated with images of dolphins and fishes. The howl from the Solokha harrow, the work of a Greek craftsman, depicts fighting animals - lions charging at stags and horses. All the subjects which constitute the rich decoration are beautifully fitted to the bowl’s shape. At the same time the interrelations between the individual images and the friezes are based on mathematically precise and artistically motivated calculations. Similar gold and silver bowls were widely used by many ancient peoples, including the Greeks, for the ritual drinking of wine. A gold bowl of this type is mentioned by Herodotus in one of his legends. Along with other sacred implements, it fell, as legend has it, from the sky and became a symbol of royal power of the first Scythian king. The presence of such bowls in sepulchres points to the high social status of the persons buried. The symbols of high office also include torques, usually decorated with sculptured figures ofanimals facing each other at oppo¬ site ends. These typically barbarian adornments for men and women of royal or noble descent were produced both by local Scythian and by Greek craftsmen. Torques of local origin are characterized by smooth surfaces and terminals in the form of recumbent or sleeping lions (the Kul-Oba and Chertomlyk barrows), or groups of six crouching lions on each side (the Chertomlyk and Tolstaya Mogila barrows). The torques of Greek manufacture are smooth or twisted, most often terminating in caps inlaid with coloured enamels, and the head of a lion show¬ ing frightful teeth (the Solokha, Kul-Oba, Talayev barrows). Stylistic differences between these two groups are

also very substantial: full-length figures are executed in a generalized manner without special attention to detail, while the lions’ heads, on the contrary, reflect the realistic tendency of classical Greek art. The two artistic tendencies mentioned above can be seen quite clearly in the decoration of ritual vessels and rhytons, which form an integral part of the funerary inventory of royal persons. The most representative series of such artifacts, unearthed from the Kul-Oba barrow, includes three silver drinking-cups of a specific local shape: spherical, round-bottomed, with a tall cylindrical spout. The surface of each cup is decorated with a wide frieze depicting animals engaged in fierce fighting. In spite of their common subjects, the three vessels are rendered by different plastic means. In one ofthem, prominence is given to the scene in which three animals - a lion, a lioness and a stag - are engaged in mortal combat. The composition occupies almost the entire frieze, leaving only a small space for the image of a panther. The relief is not high and the individual parts of the bodies are treated in a rigid decorative manner. The paws are covered by volute-shaped lines which in a way resemble birds’ heads with curved beaks, whereas the ribs are depicted by parallel incised arcs. These ingenious stylistic devices were obviously derived from Oriental art. The Greek craftsman who created the second vessel gave the same artistic problem a completely different solution. The frieze on this vessel, identical in size, includes three more closely spaced scenes of fighting animals: a lion and a lioness pouncing on a stag, two griffins swooping down on a goat, and a lion bringing down a wild boar. Together, these independent scenes form a harmonious unity tied by a common artistic idiom. The free expressive forms and movements are in full accord with the subtle realism in the rendering of detail. The intricate relief modelling is used to emphasize the extreme tension of the animals’ bodies, their strained muscles and vibrant nerves. The figures are full of dynamism and the scenes themselves are full of emotional power. And yet there is neither a hint of pure decorativeness nor any symbolic overtone. On the contrary, the lively features are enhanced by naturalistic details: the birds’ wing feathers, the lion’s mane, the stag’s hair and the wild boar’s bristles. The silver vessel with ducks is decorated in the same style. These graceful, lifelike birds are busy catching fish: one of them is just alighting on the water, the second is smoothly gliding on its surface, the third is taking wing, the fourth is diving for fish and so on. All these realistic scenes are rendered in the scrupulous manner so typical for Greek craftsmen. This is confirmed by the carefully considered poses, exact foreshortenings, precision in the depiction of the eyes, paws and feathers as well as by the mastery of chasing. This class of artifacts includes a great number of objects from Scythian royal barrows such as link bracelets, diadems and ornamented plaques. In the golden age of the Scythian kingdom, the upper classes did not restrict themselves to works ofthe ani¬ mal style or to Graeco-Barbarian art. Hellenized to a substantial degree, the Scythian aristocracy was increasingly attracted to Greek culture itself. The best workshops of the Greek mainland sent sumptuous bronze vessels with gilt high-relief overlays to the steppes via the Bosporan towns. Greek jewellery enjoyed great popularity, especially among women of distinction. Ceremonial attire and lavish head-gear were decorated with elegant ornaments. Some ofthese necklaces, ear-rings, bracelets and signetrings are masterpieces of the classical epoch. Thus, the exquisite ear ornaments found in the Kul-Oba barrow are outstanding specimens of that ingen¬ ious method of ancient Greek jewellery- making generally known as microtechnique, for which the craftsmen of Athens were especially famous. Each piece consists of a richly decorated disk, a crescent-shaped pendant and many small bud-like drops attached to the crescent by interlaced chains. The fine, elaborate details are so tiny that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. The disk is also covered with a microscopic filigree design of garlands, volutes and acanthus leaves interwoven with flowers which are done in the granulation technique and inlaid with blue and green enamels. What is most surprising is the skill with which the craftsman accomplished the task of setting four figurines of Nereids (sea nymphs) between the tiny petals of the double rosette in the centre of the disk. According to legend, the Nereids brought Achilles his helmet, sword and other pieces of arms and armour. Three tiers of lotus buds with engraved and finely granulated surfaces are fixed to the crescent-shaped pendant, which is itself ornamented with a delicate filigree design. The connecting points of the chains are hidden from view by filigree rosettes inlaid with blue enamels. Two temple ornaments from the Kul-Oba and Bolshaya Bliznitsa barrows, part of a woman’s head-dress, are stylistically very similar to the above-mentioned ear ornaments. Each has a disk-shaped medallion and a suspended openwork pendant, which forms a net of interlaced gold chains. Rosettes and buds hide the points of connection, and the medallions themselves are decorated with relief scenes derived from mythology. In the Kul-Oba specimen the medallion is adorned with a head of Athena in a rich helmet which bears images ofgallop¬ ing winged horses and, seated in the centre, a sphinx. The temple ornaments from the Bolshaya Bliznitsa barrow depict Thetis, mother of Achilles, riding a hippocampus, with her son’s armour in her hands. The pendants from the Kul-Oba barrow, apart from their artistic value, are of great historical importance, for they are the earliest reproduction in full detail of the famous statue of Athene Parthenos created by the great sculptor Phidias for the Parthenon in Athens. Pausanias, a Greek historian ofthe second century A. D., has left us a description of the statue. The helmet from the pendants, along with the goddess’s other attributes, fully corre¬ sponds to his descriptions.

A necklace from the Bolshaya Bliznitsa barrow is a fine example of the inventiveness ofjewellers in that period. It is a flexible and at the same time rather solid braid woven of thin gold strands, with filigree clasps at the ends made in the shape of lions’ heads. Three rows of buds of different sizes are suspended from the braid on interlaced chains. Double rosettes and ringlets decorated with filigree and granulation are soldered over the con¬ necting points of the chains. Smooth and twisted gold bracelets were usually decorated in the same way as torques. Caps on the ends of the bracelets are usually richly ornamented with filigree patterns, inlaid with enamels and decorated with sculp¬ tured figurines of animals or fantastic creatures. The massive bracelets from the Kul-Oba barrow terminate with half-length figures of sphinxes with folded wings. The figures, facing each other, have a stem and resolute look. All the details oftheir hair and the plumage of their wings are carefully engraved. Their heads are crowned with diadems, the necks are decorated with neck¬ laces and suspended pendants and the ears are adorned with ear-rings. Thus, these artifacts reproduce in some way the appearance of a woman of that epoch. No less imposing are the bracelets from the Bolshaya Bliznitsa barrow with sculptured figures of lionesses in rampant position. These bracelets are a successful blend ofthe realistically treated images with ornamental pat¬ terns of the caps. A specific group ofjewellery is represented by gold signet-rings with engraved images. Their small bezels, engraved with extraordinary skill, depict miniature compositions on many diverse subjects and themes. Such wonderful artifacts marked by the creative stamp of Ancient Greece could not fail to gain popularity among the upper strata of Scythian society, which possessed great wealth and wished to surround themselves with luxury. The long-lasting contacts ofthe Scythians with the Bosporan Greeks brought about one more phenomenon in art, the famous metalwork of northern Pontic Greeks, articles which depict the Scythians, their life, clothing, weapons and horse harness. The subject matter of these works reflects the daily life ofthe Scythians, their battles, rituals and customs, and events from their heroic epics. One of the most famous specimens ofthis group is the electrum ritual vessel from the Kul-Oba barrow. On its sides, in high relief, four scenes of Scythian life unfold: bow stringing, chatting, bandaging a wounded leg, and extracting a tooth (or treating a mouth ailment). The Scythians’ appearance, dress and weapons are reproduced in these scenes with amazing realism and ethnographic precision. By the skilful use of plastic modelling, the crafts¬ man has managed to convey their moods and emotions - concentration, pensiveness and pain. Each scene is compositionally complete, but they are evidently only parts of a single theme which can be interpreted as a picture ofa Scythian camp after battle or as an illustration ofthe Herodotus legend about Heracles (identified by the Scythians with Targitaus) and his sons. The sons competed for the right to succeed him, attempting to string his bow. Two of the brothers were not up to the task - one injured his leg and the other his mouth - but the third one succeeded and became the king of Scythia. Evidently the same legend was treated by the craftsman who decorated a silver vessel found in the Chastiye Barrows near Voronezh. Another outstanding ritual vessel, a silver bowl, was found in the Gaimanova Mogila barrow. It is decorated with a wide frieze which contains six figures of Scythians in relief. The core ofthe composition is two scenes, each depicting a pair of Scythians. Two more single figures, evidently ofsecondary importance, are arranged under the horizontal handles of the bowl. Unlike the above-mentioned vessel, this one clearly portrays members of the royal family. Those portrayed are bearded warriors in opulent attire, in majestic and dignified poses, and invested with the visible attributes oftheir power - each has a torque on his breast and a mace, a whip or a libation bowl in his hands. Ceremonial weapons and armour complete their military appearance. The figures are in high relief and gilt; only the faces and hands are left in silver. This ingenious device intensifies the decorative effect in a man¬ ner obviously intended by the Greek craftsman. The elaborate treatment of details demonstrates his deep know¬ ledge of Scythian life. Most probably this bowl also depicts a scene from the Scythian heroic epos. One of the most beautiful specimens of Greek metalwork is the silver-gilt amphora from the Chertomlyk barrow. This is a large wine-vessel whose neck and three spouts are equipped with sieves to filter the wine. The vessel is flawless, both in its exquisite shape and its rich decorative finish. The exceptional subtlety ofthe chased work is clearly displayed by the decoration of the vessel’s body. It is made up of floral patterns - palmettes, off¬ shoots of plants, bluebell and lotus flowers, spiny leaves of acanthus and rosettes - and was apparently inspired by the finest red-figure vases of Attica and supplemented by birds with wings raised high. The side faucets are made in the shape of heads of lions and the central one has the form of a hippocampus’ head surrounded by a radiant collar resembling fish fins. The upper part of the frieze on the shoulder of the vessel represents the tradi¬ tional Scythian subject - a griffin attacking a deer. The middle frieze depicts a group of Scythians taming horses and its central part shows four men sacrificing a mare to a Scythian deity. Three of them are pulling their lassos and the fourth, half-naked, is ready to strike as soon as the horse is thrown down. The craftsman has displayed outstanding talent in showing all the figures in complicated foreshortenings and in conveying their various emo¬ tional states. The composition of the scene is full of vigour and movement. All the scenes of the frieze as well as the other parts of the decor are closely interrelated and subordinated to a single idea, which incorporates mytho

logical conceptions and religious beliefs of the Scythians. The vase itself is chased in high relief, but most of the figures and sculptured faucets are moulded, then soldered to the body of the vase and gilt. In 1971 the collection of Scythian artifacts was augmented by yet another unique piece, the gold pectoral (breast decoration) from the Tolstaya Mogila barrow in the Ukraine. In this heavy piece of male adornment, the upper frieze, with its scenes of Scythian daily life, blends harmoniously with exquisite ornamental designs and representations of fighting animals. This brilliant example of antique goldwork is reminiscent of many of the masterpieces described above in its treatment of images, its execution and its subject matter. As in a focal point, the pectoral brings together all the finest achievements of the Bosporan craftsmen who worked in the GraecoBarbarian style. The craftsman has displayed his great skill in the lifelike rendering of the Scythian characters: two of them are making a sheep-skin shirt, a third, younger one, is milking a ewe and a fourth is sitting with an am¬ phora and checking the yield. Another frieze vividly depicts horses, cows and other animals. In the variety of its imagery, the pectoral is unequalled by any other artifact from Scythian times. The images seem to have a deep symbolic meaning, yet it remains undeciphered. One of the best works of the Graeco-Barbarian style is the gold comb from the Solokha barrow. Modelled in the round, it shows three warriors engaged in battle. A mounted Scythian and his assistant are attacking a dismounted warrior. The composition reflects the culmination of the battle and the craftsman succeeds in expressing the ferocity of the struggle most convincingly. All the figures - warriors, horses and lions - as well as the reins and the armour, were chased separately for both sides, soldered together and fitted into the comb. Such perfect technique required consummate skill. Every artifact of that period is remarkable in its own way. They may have been made on commission and hence never repeated. Therefore their historical, ethnographical and artistic value cannot be overestimated. The influence exerted by Graeco-Barbarian and Greek art on Scythian craftsmen in the fourth century’ B.C. contribut¬ ed to the emergence of anthropomorphic images of deities and mythical heroes. The objects depicting these images were either manufactured by the Scythian craftsmen themselves or made by Greek craftsmen on com¬ mission from Scylhian warriors. These two distinct artistic currents are easily traced and distinguished. The dominant position among the deities of the nomadic Scythians was occupied by goddesses in human form. Such a figure is generally shown seated by an altar (or on a throne) and with an interceding Scythian in front of her. There are also images of a winged goddess with the heads of fantastic beasts in her hands, a snake-legged goddess, etc. According to Herodotus, the Scythian religious pantheon was headed by the goddess Tahiti, the guardian of the hearth (counterpart to Vesta). The Scythians also worshipped the goddess Apia (the Earth) and Argimpasa (the Sky). But it is difficult to identify which of them is represented in any given scene. The altar seems to be the attribute of the goddess Tahiti and the wings, of Argimpasa. The image of a winged creature surrounded by ani¬ mals must have personified the Great Goddess, the supreme ruler of people, animals and other living creatures. The main male deity was Targitaus, the forefather of all the Scythians and the founder of their royal dynasty. Legends about Targitaus are so amazingly similar to the heroic exploits of Heracles that many classical Greek authors preferred to call Targitaus by the Greek name. The stone-carved statues which once surmounted the burial mounds of the Scythian royal dynasty are thought to have represented Targitaus. In the minor arts, most popular were the scenes which depicted Targitaus wrestling with a lion or with some monstrous fantastic beast. In their representational and compositional principles many purely Scythian artifacts closely followed Greek prototypes, although markedly differing from them in their simple, naive and at times unskilled treatment of human figures, and in their conventionality in rendering details. Thus, for example, a classical Greek object apparently inspired the composition ofa gold plaque (applique) from a woman's ritual head-dress. The upper part of the triangular plaque, found in the Karagodeuashkh barrow, is occupied by the image of a goddess clad in a Grecian tunic, the middle part shows a man driving a chariot and the lower part is occupied by a multifigure composition: two Scythians with ritual vessels in their hands stand before a goddess, who is seated on the throne with an air of authority. The first thing that catches the eye is the motionless poses of the figures, the generalized and sketchy modelling of form and, at the same time, the tend¬ ency to realistic treatment of the subjects. The attire of the goddess resembles the ritual dress of a Scythian woman of distinction: a high, pointed, crown-shaped head-dress and a long, patterned mantle thrown over it, and a garment with puffed sleeves. The scene itself represents the common Scythian ritual of drinking sacramental wine in order to obtain the benevolence and protection of a deity. A battle scene involving Scythian warriors is depicted on a trapezoid plaque from the Geremesov barrow. The arrangement and poses of the warriors have something in common with those on the famous Greek comb from the Solokha barrow. The ornamental frame of the plaque is also based on classical Greek motifs. But the coarse relief and the poorly proportioned figures reveal the hand of an unskilled craftsman, although his shortcomings are to a certain extent offset by his precise depiction of the events (either real or taken from the epic) and his faithful rendering ofthe personal attributes, which enabled his contemporaries to identify each char¬ acter in his work. The craftsman depicted Scythians in Italic helmets with beavers protecting their faces, in

armour and mail, wearing Greek greaves. He shows the horse’s scaly breast-plate and collar, a chamfron and bridle plaques. All the details were executed carefully and provide valuable information about Scythian weapons, armour, coats of mail and other military equipment. Nonetheless, anthropomorphic images of gods and mythical heroes were not very popular motifs in the work of local Scythian craftsmen. In the late Scythian period (late fourth - early third centuries B.C.) zoomorphic images still dominated in decorations and adornments of garments, pole-tops and particularly in horse harness and trappings. At the same time this period is characterized by the growing influence ofthe Thracian artistic tradi¬ tion on Scythian art. The Thracian tribes, the western neighbours of the Scythians, inhabited the CarpathianDanube region. While the animal style came to Thrace in the sixth century B.C., obviously under the direct influence of Scythian art, a reverse process took place beginning in the mid-fourth century B.C., when Thracian works of art and Scythian imitations of them were in great demand in the steppe north of the Black Sea. These articles were mostly silver or gold ornaments and adornments of horse harness and trappings similar to those found in the Oguz and Khomina Mogila barrows in the Ukraine. In their depictions of stags or beasts of prey, or of the heads of such animals, the Thracians focused on ornamental stylization of the image, amply using the scrolls and hatching typical of Thracian art. Scythian art still retained its traditional subjects, although its stylistic means changed considerably. A large number of new compositional schemes and stylistic devices replaces the relatively limited store prescribed by the canons of Scythian art. This situation was a necessary prerequisite for greater freedom in expressing individual conceptions and tendencies. Some local craftsmen were inclined to revive the realistic approach to subjects which was typical of early Scythian art. These efforts and tendencies, for example, are embodied in sculptured figures of birds on a pole-top from the Alexandropol barrow. In the lifelike authenticity ot their images, almost severe in their laconism, they are reminiscent of Scythian artifacts of the archaic period. The art of this period, nonetheless, was dominated by a decorative trend within the framework of the Scyth¬ ian animal style. Plasticity of forms gradually gave way to less flexible patterns. Figures of animals tended to become flat and often schematically treated; the relief began to be replaced by engraving. A more prominent role was assumed by openwork structures, and decorative features increasingly prevailed over the figurative aspect. In their search for more effective compositional schemes, the Scythian craftsmen, creators of the animal style, demonstrated a familiar inexhaustible inventiveness. They might convert a bridle ornament into a flattened but lavishly adorned and expressive figure of a running winged beast, while the end of a horse bit could be made to resemble an exotic flower, formed by the heads and elongated necks ofthree animals - a kind of faunal palmette. Frequently the images of animals were so densely interwoven with the elaborate linear design of the orna¬ ment that one can hardly make out the figure. This, for example, applies to a bronze pole-top from the Anapkurgan barrow. At first, perhaps, it is impossible to make out the profile of a stag’s head barely marked on the boss of the pole-top. It is hidden among the enormous foliated antlers, which form an openwork pattern of intricate scrolls. A bronze chamfron ornament (a chance find purchased in Maikop) is decorated with three stags' muzz¬ les, which are also difficult to trace, for their foliated antlers, formed by an alternation of birds' heads with various scrolls, cover the entire surface of the composition like intricate delicate lace. Despite its loss of realistic features, the Scythian animal style acquired compensating qualities: subtlety of form, ingenuity of composition and exquisite decorativeness. In the early third century B.C. the Sarmatian nomadic tribes invaded the Scythian territory, penetrated deep into the steppe in the lower reaches of the Dnieper river and drove the Scythians to the Crimean peninsula. There they gradually settled down and their culture, under the influence of the Greek colonies, acquired some features of urban civilization. In this period of the late Scythian kingdom (third century B.C. - third century A.D.) handi¬ crafts gave way to monumental forms of art: sculptured tombstones, architectural monuments, frescoes, etc. In spite of a strong influence of Hellenic culture, they retained elements of the ancient Scythian tradition. Thus, the development of the Scythian animal style whose creative potential was far from being exhausted, nevertheless came to a stand-still. In subsequent centuries some Scythian themes and compositions were revived in the art of various tribes and peoples of different regions. The influence of Scythian prototypes is felt in the ingenious variation of the ani¬ mal style which was created by the Sarmatians between the first century B.C. and the first century A.D. Traces of Scythian motifs arc also observed in the zoomorphic style of the Perm culture and in Scandinavian art of the early Middle Ages. The artistic tradition of Scythian art is also noticeable in diverse kinds of applied art (embroidery, enamels, architectural decor, etc.) of pre-Mongol Russia. All this helped to preserve for posterity the memory of the high spiritual and material culture of the former sovereigns of the southern steppes of Russia. Indeed, it is not deeds of war, but acts of creation that perpetuate the name of a people.

FORTHCOMING EDITION:
Treasures of Adygei Burial Mounds. Excavations of 1981-83. Format 24 x 33 cm. 189 colour and 77 black and white plates, 300 black and white illustrations in the catalogue.
This book publishes for the first lime artifacts unearthed from the burial mounds of Adygeya in the North Caucasus between 1981 and 1983 by an expedition from the Museum of Oriental Art, Moscow. This expedition, headed by Alexander Leskov, Doctor of History (author of the present book), discovered some two hundred graves near the city of Maikop dating from the Bronze Age to the Middle Ages (3000 B.C. to the 14th-15th century). Their finds include many works of ancient art executed in metal, ceramics, glass, stone and bone. These objects range from vessels, sculpture, and jewellery to a horse harness decorated with plaques and a horse’s forehead ornaments with images of animals. True masterpieces are the gold deer head with silver antlers, the recumbent silver boar inlaid with gold, the gold rhyton crowned with a head of a panther and the silver-gilt rhyton with a head of Pegasus, decorated with a unique frieze showing the gigantomachy. Classical articles, objects imported from Egypt and Asia Minor are represented in the volume alongside works produced by local masters. The discoveries made during these recent excavations not only considerably augment what is known about the Scytho-antique art of the tribes inhabiting the area behind the Kuban, but also fill a chronological gap, as no objects from the late 5th and early 4th centuries B.C. had previously been found.



The vast Soviet collections of antiquities in the so-called Scythian animal style, which is unique in its refinement and expressiveness, are known throughout the world. Of special interest are the masterpieces of ancient relief metalwork with Scythian motifs and objects in the Graeco-Barbarian style manufactured in the Greek colonies on the shores of the Pontus Euxinus (Black Sea). Also noteworthy are the extremely rare works of art brought by the
Scythians from Greece and Asia Minor, as well as the artifacts executed in the mixed Urartian-Scythian style or in the Oriental-Hellenic manner. The Scythian artistic treasures are not only the pride of the Soviet people, but are of interest for art lovers throughout the world.
