Organic Magyar Linguistics, Introduction
Organic Magyar Linguistics.
The Untenability Of Present Day Hungarian Linguistics
The author has lived in the U.S.A. since 1956. She was engaged in
independent research concerning the Magyar language and
ethnography. She audited Prof. Jacobsen’s Sumerian lectures at
Harvard University. She utilized Adorján Magyar’s works and the
immense material the libraries had to offer. She is founding editor of
the bilingual Journal of Hungarian Studies. She lectured in several
Magyar forums in the U.S.A: and her writings appeared in Magyar
Publications in the U.S.A. and Hungary.

Magyar-English word origins
Magyar Word-groups and their affiliations with non-agglutinative
languages.
Hungary is surrounded by cultures speaking Indo-European
languages. Language research in these areas conformed to the rules
and characteristics of these Indo-European languages. The politically
oppressed Hungary followed these guidelines, which are incompatible
with the structure, in fact with all aspects of her language. This
methodology produced a host of detrimental consequences:



It prevented the Hungarians from knowing the inherent values of their
language and their far-reaching influences upon world cultures.
It sent the Hungarian scholarship into historical blind alleys.
It prevented Hungarians from participating in the decipherment of
ancient agglutinative languages, and consequently their
understanding remains incomplete even with the best efforts of
Indoeuropean based linguistic approaches.
Indo-European linguists ignore important Hungarian linguistic
achievements, such as the Tibetan-English Dictionary by Alexander
Körösi Csoma.
This artificially created linguistic and historical hiatus prevented and
still prevents the Indoeuropean linguists from recognizing fully the
existing bridges between languages leading toward a deeper
understanding of our common cultural heritage.
Professor Mary Ritchie Key of the University of California, organizer of
the Intercontinental Dictionary Series (IDS) states that no comparable
work has ever been produced for non-Indo-European languages. I
propose this work to be undertaken by the new generation of
unshackled Magyar linguists.
My lecture deals with nineteen aspects of the Magyar language that
do not exist in the presently accepted Indo-European linguistics.
Linguists of the Western world base their research by necessity upon
the known, Indo-European linguistic rules when they study the
evolution of languages. These rules rest upon the present day use of
languages and never touch upon the first moments of their birth.
Placing the already known and the newly discovered languages onto
the map of linguistic achievements according to the Indo-European



world view necessitates an incredibly precise work, which almost
achieves its goals. Western linguists still continue to battle the
outcomes of this almost condition since they feel that behind the
collected material there is another, unknown linguistic layer onto
which they are unable to put their finger. They call this layer “proto
language” no matter where its occurrence is. Linguists identified such
a proto language in the most ancient cultural strata up to our days, or
almost our days. They found a Proto Sumerian, Proto Hittite, Proto
Greek, Proto Celtic language and we could continue this enumeration
of proto languages beyond Eurasia to the Proto Language of other
continents and distant cultures. This mysterious Proto Language
occupies a thick branch of the vast tree of languages, as the November
5, 1990 article of the U.S. News and World Report so nicely illustrated.
Here all the twigs and branches of the language tree originate from a
Proto Language which leads us to the trunk of the tree which they call
“mother tongue”, the birth mother of all languages. They do this
without ever defining the concept of the mother tongue.
Western linguists – after they very precisely catalogued the languages
- came to the conclusion that the Proto Indo-European language’s
birthplace was in Anatolia, in today’s Turkey and it spread from here
to all parts of Europe some 8.000 years ago. The British archaeologist
Colin Renfrew holds this theory. He also emphasizes that the birth of
languages predates the birth of literacy. From an archaeological point
of view he believes that the birth and spread of language was the
result of the spread of the peaceful culture of cereal growing societies.
Grover S. Krantz, the late professor of anthropology at the University
of Washington who established the pattern of spread of language
groups, held similar beliefs. He identified twelve language branches
from which he originated all the known European languages. He
placed the birth of languages to a pre-Mesolithic time with the
Carpathian basin as its epicenter.[1]



In the Geographical Development of European Languages, he recognizes
the Magyar language, – which until now was considered and treated
as Europe’s stepchild – the base of European culture. According to his
theory the Indo-European languages developed very late in time in
Europe and, for this reason, 30% of these languages indicate another,
non-European origin. For example he shows that on the early maps of
Europe there are no Indo-European river names. We are interested in
his following statements:
“The unexpected conclusions here are mainly in the area of increased
antiquity ascribed to the original Indo-European dispersion itself, and in
the longer residence indicated for some of its subdivisions in their present
locations. This would include, for example, developing Greek in its
present area since 6500 BC., and Celtic in Ireland since 3500 BC. The
antiquity of Magyar in Hungary may be equally surprising: I find it
to be a Mesolithic speech that predates the Neolithic entry.”
And a little later: “In at least one major instance the commonly
assumed direction of migration of population is reversed here. It is
usually stated, that the Uralic Magyars moved into Hungary from
an eastern source in the 9th century A.D. I find instead that all the
other Uralic speakers expanded out of Hungary in the opposite
direction, and at a much earlier date.”
According to Krantz the network of dialects of different regions is
understandable to people living in close proximity to one another. This
situation changes according to the distances placed between them. He
believes that 10,000 years ago Europe and the Near East was one
linguistic network. This view coincides with the one held by the
Hungarian historian Dr. Tibor Baráth.
Krantz accepts migrations only as far as it becomes necessary to deal
with overpopulation. According to his theory all peoples are born, and



form a nation where their majority presently resides. He began to
work out this theory in 1976 in connection with the tribal placements
of the North American Indians. After the success of working out the
details of their tribal origins, he began to work out the details of
ancient European cultures in 1981. His method takes into
consideration the modalities of agriculture, means of survival, the
growth of cultures and he regards their growth and radiation toward
other regions as their adjunct. He holds that the most likely group to
spread a culture were not the mobile hunters but the members of
agricultural societies, who had plenty of time and material reserves to
undertake such ventures.
“Krantz develops models that are more like those found in the physical
sciences. This deductive approach is quite novel in the social sciences
where most conclusions are reached inductively. Future scholars on this
subject are now in a position to test a variety of hypotheses about the
evolution of culture and language in Europe.” says Roger M. La
Jeunesse, professor at the University of California.
Krantz mentions that the old, petrified historical views deal only with
strong rulers and political borders, even though mankind’s history is
the history of smaller groups which are tied into a unit through an
affinity of dialects within one language. He emphasizes that the
results of linguistics and history have not supported one another until
now. Historical borders have to be changed and the regions of
languages, their mutual support and the changes they exert upon one
another have to come to the forefront. When this is done he proves
that the homeland of linguistic and occupational groups, and their
migratory routes can be worked out with mathematical precision. He
also states at the beginning of his book: “We cannot just move people
all over the map solely to accommodate proposed linguistic connections.”
This sentence brings to mind the efforts of the Magyar Tudományos
Akadémia (Hungarian Academy of Sciences, abbreviation MTA) which



chases the Magyars from Siberia to the Urals in search of a homeland,
and gives them a language only in the Carpathian homeland.
One of the cornerstones of Krantz’s theory is the recognition that the
evolution of language is just as much a part of the natural order as the
selection of a home and it cannot be separated from the nature of
human beings and the customs where they have their roots. Adorján
Magyar wrote almost a hundred years ago that every culture and
cultural achievement survives the longest at its place of origin. He
discovered sixteen ethnic groups within the Magyar mother culture.
Each of these ethnic groups had a cultic vocabulary within the border
of a certain consonantal group. The ancient ethnic groups and their
attached word roots and dialects appear in almost the same context in
Krantz’s theories, although he was unable to give a sound to these
dialects.
Krantz emphasizes that from an anthropological point of view one
must be able to answer the following questions:
“1. Why did the people move at all rather than simply remain where
they were?
2. Why did they move where they did rather than to some other
location?
3. Why did they move when they did rather than at some other time?
4. Why was it they who moved, there and then, rather than some
other people?
5. How was the move accomplished over the presumed resistance of
the people already occupying the location?”[2]
According to him if one can answer these questions, the proposed



theory rests on solid ground. The more questions remain unanswered,
the less is the value of the theory and one should question if it is
worth continuing this line of thought. Krantz worked out the
geographical map of the American Indian languages with a 95%
success rate. He discovered that people do like continuity, security and
if there is no overwhelming reason, they will not move from the
familiar region. According to him there are no waves of migrations
which entail a complete population change.
According to the second point of his theory, the migrants always move
to a territory where they find a population with lower cultural
standards than their own.
The migrants can always overstep the linguistic borders; this is the
natural result of the migration. But the incoming migrants will soon
be absorbed by the settled population and society of that region and
they will cease to exist as a separate language and organized entity.
According to Adorján Magyar if the spoken language within the
Carpathian basin had not been Magyar before and at the time of
Árpád’s conquest, there would be no Magyar language today even if
the incoming people of Árpád in the 9th century A. D. had spoken the
purest form of Magyar.
After some deliberation Krantz comes to the conclusion that the
peaceful, settled, agricultural societies with hundreds of thousands of
people are unable to get moving in one unit. He cites Dennel’s work of
1983 and, following this line of thought, he also came to the
conclusion that the migrations which were presumed by
archaeologists do not mean a complete replacement of ethnic groups
and language groups. In the field of linguistics he mentions that, at
first glance, it seems impossible to follow the migration of languages
from the most ancient times up to our days. But Krantz’s theories are



ground-breaking in this field also. He came to the following
conclusions:
1. Today’s linguists believe that from today’s languages one is able
to reconstruct the languages of prehistory. But there is no tool as
yet which could explain the spread of languages in the pre
literacy period, their rules, the routes of their spread, the speed
of spread, since it cannot be presumed that all languages spread
at an equal speed. So there is more time for the researches to
work and, in this broader framework, archaeologists would be
able to supply more data.
2. The second question is how these languages started on their
journey of broader differentiation. According to Krantz’s theory
the Indo-European languages began with an admixture of
languages, language networks and their constant breaking off
into smaller groups which must have begun 6400 years ago. He
also mentions here Gimbutas’ work of 1977.
3. Thirdly we have to know very accurately some prehistoric
languages if we want to be correct in the reconstitution of the
spread of languages. Data uncovered by archaeologists deal
usually with a leading personality and place names, monuments
surrounding this personality. Languages on the other hand are
the creation of unknown masses. When we take a look at the
earliest known maps of Europe we realize how little these
political maps have to do with the linguistic reality of the region.
Krantz comes to the basic conclusion that the huge linguistic spread in
Europe was the feat of the peaceful agriculturists and, with this
statement, he again agrees with the Hungarian linguist and
ethnographer, Adorján Magyar, who stated that only peaceful, creative
societies are capable of creating a higher culture.



Krantz’s Climatic Races and Descent Groups examines our journey as
part of human evolution from an anthropological perspective and
believes its pinnacle was the development of speech. According to
him, the one million or so years which today’s scientists give to the
development of the ape-men is in no way enough to develop the
organs of speech, which is the prerequisite of human speech. He
believes it is at this point that the Homo Erectus becomes Homo
Sapiens. According to him, for some unknown reason this
transformation took place in Europe, more precisely in Central
Europe, maybe near the Eastern Mediterranean, when Europe’s
population was in its entirety blond and blue eyed. Blood-type in
Europe was represented by the Rh negative group.
Here we have to remind ourselves that the Rh negative, blond, blue
eyed Bodrogköz people represent one of the oldest ethnic groups in
Hungary which has inhabited the country continuously for 6000
years[3] according to archaeological evidence.
Independently of Professor Krantz, Evan Hadingham, professor of
anthropology at Harvard University, places this evolution in Central
Europe, more precisely in the region of Érd and Tata in Hungary. In his
opinion, human evolution reached its highest peak here without any
outside influence.[4]
Linguists of the former Soviet Union place the divergence of the
human languages to 14.000 years ago and, according to them, not
only the Indo-European languages, but the languages of India and
Africa originated here too. They call this ancient language nostratic
and consider it as the mother tongue of mankind. This nostratic
language was the first crack in the wall of the theory of language
groups which until now were believed to be sacrosanct. Nostratic
linguists clamor to find common word groups among languages with
divergent origins. Their efforts are sometimes rewarded as long as



they are willing to make this leap between language families. Such an
effort is illustrated in the article of the U.S. News and World Report
concerning the “family tree” of the word water: According to this
article, the following can be observed:
Proto-languages Haku
American Indian Hakw
Dene-Caucasian Kwa
Nostratic Haku
Indo-European Hakw
Latin Aqua
Old-German Wazzar
English Water
It becomes obvious, even in this one example, that the consonants H
K and W-T are interchanged freely by the adherents of nostratic
theories, and an attempt is made to explain an unfounded theory with
this phonetic impossibility. The W which they attach to the H-K
consonants may round out the interpretation of the particular words,
but the very limited view of today’s linguists hinders this process. I
perceive the origins of this hindrance in the fact that this proto
language is viewed at all costs as Indo-European, even though the
lifeblood of the world’s languages come from a much deeper layer
which gives life to the later languages, among them the Indo-European
languages. Or in a similar order, the same sap nurtured the Proto
world’s hita, the Amerind hit, the Nostratic -ita, the Indo-European
hed, the Greek edmenai, the Latin edere, the Old Germanic ezzen,
and the English eat.
Only great partiality can deny the antiquity in this matter of the
ancient Magyar word root esz-isz (to eat, to drink). We also have to
note that the English eat is the direct descendant of this ancient root,



where the “s” sound signifies a taking in process which holds true to
both drinking and eating. The English language preserved it in the
form of eating, but did not follow up with the drinking process which
was formed according to another word root. This one example and all
the other 640 words collected in my Magyar-English Word Origins[5]
show that the closer the place of development of a language was
to the Carpathian basin, the closer it adhered to the ancient word
roots which are closest in relationship to the Magyar root. These
ancient similarities can chart our way toward the place and time
of the birth and dispersion of languages.
Concerning the afore-mentioned K-W and W-T word groups, these
can be led back to two ancient Magyar dialects: the K-W to the
Magyar hab (foam, as in sea-foam), the W-T to the Magyar víz
(water), without having to resort to an extra linguistic license to do
so. Later explanations will familiarize us with these ancient dialects.
The in the former Soviet Union proponents of the Nostratic theory[6]
are Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky. In their study,
which they began in the 1960’s, they compared the ancient layers of
languages with the names of body-parts, personal pronouns, objects
and phenomena of nature, such as the names of the Sun and the
Moon. The words that are similar they believe to be a maternal
offshoot of the Nostratic language, but they are still unable to go
beyond these superficial similarities and find the one originating
ancestor. Such is the nostratic majra, the Indo-European merio
meaning a young man, the French mari meaning husband and the
English marry meaning marriage and connected ideas. Here apples
are compared with oranges: the ancient nature words are compared to
the much later words of cultural concepts, totally ignoring the natural
order of language development even though this journey could lead to
far-reaching deductions in the natural sciences. One such observation
could have been the realization that this particular M-R word group



expressed the male and the female concept within the same
consonantal group, as in case of the French mari and mère, thus
giving the vowels the differentiating role.
Only few linguists studied the “smaller” languages, such as the Basque
and other “exotic” languages. In due course, linguists have to face up
to the existing non-Indo-European American Indian languages, and
their early divisions for which the Behring Straits, were of little
hindrance for as yet unknown reasons.
Luigi Scavalli-Sforza, geneticist at Stanford University, saw a close
connection between the development of genes and of languages. He
studied 42 gene-pools and came to the conclusion that mankind’s
family tree grew out of one single group of people. He believes that
this origin took place in Africa some 92.000 years ago. Allan Wilson,
Mark Stoneking and Rebecca Cann from the University of California
place this differentiation at 200.000 years ago.
The much divided territory of historical linguistics is represented by
Brown University’s linguist, Philip Lieberman[7] and Derek
Bickerton[8] from Havaii. According to Lieberman, the necessary
organ of speech – the larynx – did not yet exist 200.000 years ago.
Bickerton, on the other hand, believes that the brain’s speech center
was already fully developed millions of years ago, which fact – he
believes – is due to mankind’s innate need to give expression to the
world surrounding him and to see it in an organized manner. He
places the young child’s babble into this first language which induces
the grown-ups also to engage in the same talk. The Yerkes Regional
Primate Research Center of the University of California came to the
unanimous conclusion that pigmy chimpanzees are capable of using a
language which follows linguistic rules.[9] Other researchers believe
that dolphins, and sea lions are capable of using word-order.



The afore-mentioned researchers, Allan Wilson, Mark Stoneking and
Rebecca Cann from the University of California, Berkeley, trace
mankind’s gene-pool to an “Eve” who lived 200.000 years ago in
Africa. Other research projects assign the same role to an inhabitant of
Asia. This question is really of primary importance and its full research
is still in the future.
The Russian Sheveroskin states that the once existing ancient
language can still be detected in today’s languages. He mentions the
Nostratic lapa, the Dene-Caucasian tlalpa, the Amerind dap words as
examples, all of them meaning leaf. He could have included the
English leaf, the German Blatt and note that these are one another’s
reciprocal forms. The Palóc-Magyar lap, lapi, levél, lebeny, libeg,
lebeg, lebben, lobban words (lap, lapi = a flat surface, levél = leaf,
lebeny = lobe, libeg = to flutter, lebeg = to float, lobban = to flare
up, as in fluttering flames) and their extensive word group should
never have been omitted. By doing so linguists would also come to the
realization that within this word-group the L-B group represents the
female essence of creation as opposed to its reciprocal B-L carrying
the male concepts of creation, such as Bál, Pál (names of the Sun),
pálca, balita (staff, symbol of energy), to mention just a few examples.
Sheveroskin mentions that all kinds of concepts were already present
in mankind’s ancient vocabulary but he was unable to find ancient
words which express feelings. The Magyar language offers these
too, like ó, meaning amazement, bú meaning sorrow. These I will
discuss later. For now I will mention that the ó of amazement
remained in mankind’s vocabulary as an exclamation of amazement,
in Magyar it also became the word meaning ancient.
The article further explains that the inevitable prerequisite in
finding the roots of a language is to define what a language is in
the first place.



Based on this statement it seems that the Indo-European linguists still
have not defined what a language is and neither know, nor use the
following points which belong to the Magyar linguistic realities. If the
Indo-European linguists are unable to give answers to the
following questions, any statement concerning the roots of the
Magyar language is only the mirror of their ignorance in this
matter and so they are in no way qualified to give an opinion of
the same.
Do they know of the following linguistic phenomena which are
part of the Magyar language:
1. The phonetic value of creation’s force and matter?
2. Are they familiar with the connection of the symbols expressed in
sound and matter and their order?
3. Are they familiar with the order of creation as it reveals itself
through the structure of the language?
4. Are they familiar with the phonetic rules of this order?
5. Do they realize the meaning and implications of the reciprocity of
words?
6. Are they familiar with the primary importance of word groups?
7. Do they differentiate between the ancient nature words and
cultural words and do they know the role of these?
8. Do their linguistic rules reflect the fact that all dialects carry the
image of the environment of their origin?
9. Are they familiar with the organic life of languages and their
dialects? Do they know how the organic intellectual content of a



language exercises power over the development of its society?
10. Are they familiar with the development of new language
branches, their order and their organic base?
11. Have they noted that the development of new language branches
is the result of the weakening inherent cohesiveness of the
original language’s ethic, and intellectual content?
12. Are they familiar with the role of the ancient mono-syllabic
words?
13. Are they familiar with the role of the multi-syllabic nature words?
14. Have they charted the independent meaning of sounds?
15. Are they familiar with the meaning of the vowels and their
independent role?
a. the deep vowels express a possibility
b. the high vowels express fulfillment (Ell-él = process of birth
- lives, al-áll = a low base-it stands, ör-őr=circle-guardian)
16. Mankind’s first language was the ancestral emotional language.
This language began at the moment of creation. All languages are
still nurtured by these ancient springs.
17. The following step in language development comes through the
use of consonants, which express their environment.
a. The first step is the use of one vowel and one consonant.
These words are subject and predicate at the same time:
within them force and matter are in perfect balance. (Ég
ég=sky-to burn, él-él=the edge of something-to live; ér



ér=artery-to reach something).
b. the power of the two consonantal word-roots bring to life
their native environment and define a concept. (G
gumó=bulb, K-kő=stone, Sz-szem=eye, etc.)
c. The psychological effect of the consonantal word-roots, like
the double organizational focus of societies which depended
on an oblong shape as their symbol, like the SZ-M word
group’s society, the Szemere (people of the seed). The
Magyar word szervezkedés (organization) contains the
concept of szervesség (organic development).
18. Through the spread of the well outlined consonantal groups one
can clearly observe the routes taken by a particular society.
19. The first language started from God, it is inseparable from God
and the structure of this language contains the order of creation
up to our days. (According to Adorján Magyar, the Magyar
language is the verbal expression of creation and it is as perfect
as crystals and snowflakes.)
My study deals with the above nineteen points. As an attachment I can
offer my four thousand word collection which shows some of the
routes these ancient natural word-roots have taken.

Organic Magyar Linguistics, part 1.a
The development of language, its growth cannot be separated from
the life of the individuals using it and from their environment. An
inseparable organic bond ties them into one unit and together they
can lead back the interested researcher to the dawn of creation.
As the language forms an organic unit with the body, the organic
body functions that guide the body become part of the language
also.
The prerequisite of transmitting thoughts is the existence of a
transmitting agent.
The starting point of thought - from the point of view of life
development - is not known by today’s scientists and thus far only
humans were given the elevated status of intellectual beings. This
narrow definition is beginning to expand in our days and maybe a
future generation will notice that our human development was not the
proud fact of a nicely-moving thumb but the creative thought of which
our bodies are only an instrument, molded according to our needs.
The modern scientist, whose world view explains matter through
matter, becomes insecure and even scared at the immense distances
our thoughts can offer because he knows that, the instant he makes
the first step toward the world of thoughts, he must bid farewell to
the narrow little world of microscopes and instruments of which until
now he has been the ruler, like the tiny life forms in a drop of water.
Once this journey begins, it will take us sooner or later to the thought
behind the Word of creation and to universality.
This subconscious knowledge is immensely larger than our present



conscious state and it played a far greater role at the beginning of our
lives than we are able to imagine today. We call its occasional
manifestations “superconscious” and place it most often into the cheap
entertainment category of psychic phenomena. Only rarely is it
examined by a daring scientist as subject of a scientific study within
the realm of psychology. Interestingly, the content of this
superconscious and the subconscious meet at the base of the pyramid,
at the level of universal consciousness. This consciousness is the first
to realize the world and sends the thought onto its journey of which
in human affairs – the end expression is Man[1]. This Man – with the
exception of a few inspired individuals – locks himself away from the
knowledge that is his, which began at the first moment of his
consciousness, which is the originator of his existence and the
preserver of his life. The result of this action is his constant sense of
incompleteness, which he tries to satisfy with material goods. The
futility of this action is well demonstrated by today’s world of
“consciousness expansion” through material means and its complete
failure. Man feels that once he was able to achieve through the totality
of his life all the things which he is now able to achieve only through
limited material means – telephone, radio, TV, space ships – etc. This
state of affairs is much like the fate of the sorcerer’s apprentice who
started a sequence of actions but was unable to stop it.
The first originator of our thought-sharing processes – as I can
perceive it today – is embedded in our consciousness and it is
independent of the media, which we call material world. Our
consciousness is at home in the infinite. Its tool is thought; the
instrument of thought is matter. The endless possibilities of the
infinite are still alive within us in our childhood and it even gives
expression of to its existence within the symbolism of the child’s
environment. Like “I see a child looking into the mirror which shows a
child looking into the mirror....”, or “I am sitting in a movie where the



audience sees on the screen an audience which....” and so on. The
child realizes the infinite as a personal experience, which he cradles
within himself. This consciousness of the child awaits answers and
cultivation so he may rise to the fullness of his human capabilities in
the name of universal life of which he is a rightful heir. Today we
realize some of this talent in the lives of our inspired artists who even
as grown ups remember that the buds of spring sprout from their
being.[2] An unbelievably beautiful world would open up in front of
our eyes if we were to base our lives on full consciousness.
Consciousness makes its home in the world of ideals and beauty,
goodness and harmony. Love is its nurturing soil and the thought that
preserved its original consciousness will bring these about in our
material world also. The nurturing of this talent should be the basic
goal of childhood education. In Magyar context we are still aware of
the once existing schools of ancient priests and wise men and their
methods of teaching. Arnold Ipolyi, a priest, linguist and ethnographer
talks about these in detail in his Magyar mythologia (Magyar
Mythology) and this may have been the reason that his church
superiors did not give their blessing to his monumental work which
could have heralded in a new age. In ancient times – up to the times
of the so called historical age – before a Magyar child stepped out into
the world from the protective environment of his family, he spent
years in a holy community, where he studied, perfected his knowledge
and elevated his talent to connect with the universal to the highest
degree.[3] In other words: they made the body, which is the
instrument of, capable of accepting the knowledge received from the
universal in the name of love that always creates. With such
preparation the body, and within it the brain, is made capable of
processing the universal knowledge which he needs and can apply in
his present environment. There is an old Magyar saying that “the
knowledge was poured into his head with a funnel” which saying – I
believe – is a very picturesque expression of the process of how



consciousness becomes thought.
Returning to linguistics, we see that the prerequisite of thought, which
is consciousness, is a gift that was given not only to human beings. On
the level of pure consciousness the world is in constant connection
with all participants of creation. From experience we know that our
favorite dog, or other pet close to us has proven several times over
that he is aware of our thoughts. Magyar ancestral memories know of
a time when human beings understood the language of the animals
and knew that the waves of the Sea of Heaven transmit the Song of
Creation. They perceived that the grapes talk, the peaches ring out
and the sun and the high heavens are loud and the dawn laughs.[4]
These words are not an empty poetic imagery but the product of a
refined sense that perceives the waves of creation. Through their
inherited talents and teaching, they helped to maintain this level of
consciousness, to use it in case of need to help creation, even in our
days.
Presently we walk like blind and even more like deaf people since our
lives are attached to materiality. But, even so, we realize that our
actions are sometimes dictated by “the spirit of our time”. Similar
artistic creations, humanitarian efforts, music emerge at great
distances, from people who do not know one another. But we have
absolutely no idea what waves our planet passes through at any given
moment and what effects they have upon our lives, our consciousness,
our psyche and what our role is within these, because the universal
knowledge cannot surface in our lives.
Our Magyar heritage recognizes consciousness as being above space
and time and its participants used it in this manner. The frequent
motif of our children’s stories is the exclamation: “Hip-hop I’ll be
there where I want to be”. This was an accepted, daily reality at the
time of king Atilla and, according to a Christmas song, this method of



travel is still practiced in County Baranya Hungary in our days.[5]
Concerning the development of the transmission of thoughts, I spoke
of a sequence, where the necessary prerequisite is the desire to
communicate. The desire, the feeling is already attached to matter.
The prerequisite to the birth of sound is the presence of matter and its
ability to contain. According to Magyar traditions, the knowledge built
into the language is connected with materiality; the capacity to
contain, to enfold is a maternal and material quality. Light and energy
are masculine concepts. The two are interchangeable according to
physics and within the structure of the Magyar language too.
[Erő=force, erőny=energy, anyag=matter. Here the Magyar word for
energy (erőny) is a composite of the word force (erő) and matter
(anyag)].
The use of sounds in the Magyar language is never arbitrary but a
reality presented by the strict principles that are operational within
the forces of creation and ancient consciousness. First grade writing
exercises in Magyar schools frequently contained the following words,
side by side: „úr, ír” (the lord, to write). Writers and poets frequently
used this chance exercise in the practice of the letter R in a socio
economic sense mostly in connection with Hungary’s welfare
problems. From the point of linguistics the words „Úr” (Lord) and
„Űr”(space) fully express the interplay of thought and matter as they
arise from the realm of consciousness.
The first instance when consciousness touches matter, the first feeling
and the first pre-speech thought is born which forms matter. The
meeting of the two brings about the need and desire for
communication, the first consciously created sound which shouts the
joy of life into the Universe. Out of this, the first textless simple tune is
born, as music theorist and teacher Dániel Mindszenty stated[6].
Writing – in the context of human life – appears only later, when



matter, which forms our bodies, has become an obedient tool along
with our nicely-flexing thumb. The pre-speech and pre-literacy world
of humans was the land of ideals and we are destined to transplant
this world into our present world. Our first thought transmitting tool
was the song, born of the harmony of sounds, and the dance.
From a biological point of view, we now know that the developing
embryo is very sensitive to sounds even in its earliest stages of
development, and it also responds to sounds in an appropriate
manner: the noise called modern music leaves a negative influence
upon its development. The unimaginably lovely cradle songs of the
Magyar peasant society, their text, their melody, their rhythm and
mood changed the child’s environment to become even more
beautiful, more complete, beginning in the womb of its mother and
continues in the lovely songs of his/her grown up years, all designed
to encourage the positive emotions and actions. As comparison let me
mention one of these Magyar songs and then an English lullaby:
Tente baba tente Rock a bye baby, rock a bye
aludj szívem szentje sleep my heart’s little saint
alszik a viola the violas are sleeping
csicsijja, bubujja hush baby hush.
(It is hardly possible to translate the tender words that are derived
from imitating nature’s hushed tones, like the last two words of the
paragraph.)
The English cradle song, Rock a bye baby on the tree, top places fear
and violence into the center of the child’s world with no soft place on
which to fall.



Interestingly, a modern disease called Alzheimer’s Disease gives us a
glimpse into the language development of human beings. The
sufferers of AD seem to roll back their speech capacity and life
functions all the way to the cradle. Part of this regression is the
regression of their capacity to think and to speak to an age when they
were not able to form words at will. When their speech fails they still
can express their feelings through songs. Melody remains their tool
and when this fails, motions express the feelings within their
retreating world: a gentle stroke means good and a hug means love.
As we reach the end station of our lives, the last dominion that stays
with us is the world of sounds. It is with sounds we bid our last
farewell before we enter the world of pure consciousness.
Following this line of thought we can safely state that the basis of our
human speech is harmony and song.
The process of speech is the following:
Thought —> desire (directed toward expression) —> sound,
enclosed into a textless song —> modified sound (meaning
constructed from one sound) —> monosyllabic words created with
the use of several sounds —> a one-word sentence (question, or
statement) —> enlarged sentences —> modified sentences (poems).
1. The thought is still free; it does not have any material
prerequisites.
2. The desire, the need to communicate is already directed toward
matter and it desires to radiate, to divide and share of its essence.
3. The prerequisite of the sound is the existence of matter, since
there can be no sound without it. There are:



1. sounds that express feelings and send their joy or pain into
the big wide world. Vowels become fixed at this point and it
is also the beginning point of melodies,
2. sounds that are based upon observation and the imitation of
the sounds of the material world. The birth of consonants
takes place at this time. This is also the first appearance of
sounds that originate from an object outside the speaker and
achieve marked importance in our phonetics. One such
example is the hard K sound of stones as they hit one
another, and later during the tool-making period. The
stabilized K sound of stone and hardness (kő, kemény) will
form the word ÉK (wedge). Since splitting a stone produces
many wedges (ékek), the K became the marker of plurality
also.
4. The modified sound is purposely created to express a certain,
already stabilized meaning. The sound „A” expresses amazement,
surprise, the „Ó” expresses reverence. In the Magyar language
this later became also the word to express antiquity. It is a logical
progression since this sound gave expression to the reverence
when seeing the first light of creation.
A later development ties the vowels and the consonants together.
The Magyar image of God and anything essential to maintain life
belongs in this ancient word formation of one vowel and one
consonant [(Ég (God), Úr (Lord), Ős (ancestor), Él (lives),
etc.]. This ancient time is the time of beginning.
The name of the Son of God, who is active participant in
creation, (in essence he is the Creator: compare the roles of force
and energy) is formed by monosyllabic, bi-, or multi-consonantal
words.



According to the above, from the Magyar linguistic point of view
the “In the beginning was the Word” (Íge) is an unbelievably
accurate statement.
The monosyllabic words — due to the influences of
environment and occupation — shift toward a certain
consonantal group, which remains dominant from here on. This
is the base of the individual linguistic groups’ mode of expression.
The importance of Adorján Magyar’s sixteen ancient consonantal
groups lies within this realization, which makes these groups the
base of all human language.
5. The one-word sentence ties the modified sounds to a meaning
and uses it as such regularly. This is a later period of language
evolution. The base of the later multi-word sentences is already
present, which is the matter-space-time continuum and a
multitude of expressions of emotions.
6. The extended sentence already explains, teaches, defines.
7. The modified sentences are born due to a need for beauty. The
simple passing on of thoughts is not enough. There is a need to
do this by expressing beauty, through rhythm and harmony. The
people who formed the ancient sentences still remembered the
original meaning of sounds and their meaning was amplified
with rhythms and rhymes. In our days the linguist and poet
Dénes Kiss does groundbreaking work in this line.
Today’s linguists do not take the ancient layers of language into
consideration and concentrate solely upon the later products of
language development, neglecting their ancient origin. This method
may be compared to the work of an archeologist who strives to
understand the thinking of the ancients through present day artifacts.
Even though all layers of the past are enshrined in today’s objects, the



questions of when, why and how cannot be answered and much
research is needed to answer with certainty.
Writing is also born from a desire to communicate and here too most
of the stages of language development are present.
THE PROCESS OF LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT:
Thought —> desire (centered upon the need to communicate)
—>the need to communicate becomes permanent —> the
manipulating of matter is the base of bringing the thought into the
material world —> modification of sound, —> bringing the imagery
of material change into focused reality —> attaching the image to
sound.
We can observe the following in connection with the process of
language development:
The organic connection between sound and matter.
The use of matter which is outside of the body and the sound
that is attached to it, – like the hard “K” sound and the form of
the chips of stone (kő, ék) which were created by knocking two
stones together – satisfied the aesthetic need of a person at the
beginning. It was at this time that the sharp angles of the stone
were recognized in other objects too – like the wedge shaped
head of a wolf or dog – and this form was used as decoration:
zigzag lines on Neolithic statues and pottery and even a dog’s
head on one of the ancient houses in Hungary, where a dog’s
head became part of the ornamental structure of a roof.[7] The
jagged lines of broken stones became ingrained in the aesthetic
nature of this group of people and remained their symbol
through the ages. Consequently we can state that the
manipulation of matter is the basis of both the sound



formation and of writing and the first step in their creation.
The image-saving capacity of manipulated matter – which is
its innate characteristic – brings about the further development of
writing. When the three sounds of láb (leg) consistently mean a
leg the first pictograph is born at a time when its communication
becomes necessary for some reason.
The wedge shape, which was born from the aesthetic need of its
creator, was soon attached to sound also and it became the letter
K in the Székely-Magyar rovás (runic writing).
The material base and image forming capacity of a manipulated sound
depends on the region’s environment, the work of its creator, etc. and so
these symbols slowly become the symbols of that particular group or
extended family. The names and symbols of Adorjan Magyar’s ancient
linguistic groups become fixed at this point of development.[8] This
realization is groundbreaking in mankind’s self-realization and it
becomes its new base.
By the time a culture reaches the stage of pottery making, sculpting,
ceremonial burials these symbols are already fixed. Some sampling of
these burials from ancient times through the Bronze Age clearly show
the presence of this ingrained symbolism of the Carpathian lands.[9]
So the ancient vessels used at burials and their symbols are not
arbitrary but the particular design on an urn tells us about the ethnic
group to which a person belongs, just as much as today’s written
scripts on headstones. Prof. Lajos Szántai reminds us that the grave
goods are not for the use of dead in the afterlife but are teaching tools
directed toward the enlightenment of later generations.
The basis of language development is the song born out of the
harmony of sounds of the Universe. The basis of writing is art. In both



instances the participants have to know fully the nature of the
material they work with and they have to have a desire toward beauty
and order. In both instances they will need a fully developed
symbolism. In the case of speech, they need fully developed sounds,
which they can replicate at will; in the case of writing, they need
consciously selected lines. The end result of both is a changed
environment, which is the result of a changed mood. The Hungarian
author, Sándor Márai, mentioned in his diary that one never remains
the same after listening to music, which first takes apart the
components of the listener’s real or imaginary world and creates a
new one from it.
Harry Bober, professor of art at Harvard University, published a small
booklet in 1953[10] in which he talks about the development of
writing.
He explains that, in correct speech, the proper inflection of the voice is
important to convey a meaning correctly. The artist has a problem
similar to that of the writer, since he cannot use his voice to do this
job. Instead he has to use the proper lines, colors and shapes to
convey the meaning of his art.
Later Bober says that whether it is recognized today or not, art has a
basic vocabulary also, which consists of lines, and one is just as
familiar with the meaning of these lines as with the spoken word. He
shows three lines, one zigzag line, a flowing wave-like line, and an
irregular line. He says nobody would fail the exam as to the meaning
of these lines, even if he were confronted with them for the first time.
Anyone would recognize that one line is full of angles which may
represent thorns or fences; the flowing lines are connected with an
image of flowing hair and quiet waters and the third, irregular, jagged
line is full of tension, and may represent the running-about of nervous
people.



According to the above, the beginning of art is the first consciously
used line. I mentioned this earlier but I am repeating it because of its
importance in understanding our human heritage: The point where the
first consciously used sound and the first consciously used line meet is the
mirror image of the environment where this developing culture lives, in
the first language of mankind.
In this language every sound had its own meaning which was derived
from the observation of nature. To deny this would be just as foolish
as to suppose that the individual numbers don’t carry a meaning and
they derive their meaning only within a mathematical procedure.
I also mentioned earlier that the organization of sounds, the formation
of words is discussed at length in Adorján Magyar’s „Az Ősműveltség”.
Right now I will mention only a few examples.
The first Magyar agricultural society, which lived a creative and
productive life, recognized, through inherited consciousness that
creation’s most perfect form is the globe, which in their language was
called mag (a round kernel). The Sun is a mag of which our solar
system and our earth were born, just as the little round kernels of
which the life sustaining fruit tree, the meggy (sour-cherry) is born,
which has a gömb (globe) shape along with its flowers which grow in
round bouquets on its branches.
When we translate these into sounds, we have to realize that the
ancient Magyar “G-M” word group uses the soft “G” sound, which is
still part of a developing baby’s first sounds. It also brings to mind the
soft lines of a globe and it is one with the concept and sound of rolling
(görög). This G is also the base of the name of cumulus clouds



(gomoly), the round fruits and bulbs, which carry and sustain their
lives (gyümölcs and gumó), all of which are the reciprocals of the
original mag (round seed). Low, rolling hills, fruit trees, and quietly
gurgling brooks round up their environment.
The “M” is the happy sound when man first realized the ownership of
something pleasant: “Mmmmmmm” — it is the joyous sound of a
baby suckling the sweetness of mother’s breast. The “A” is the sound
of ancient matter (anyag) before it came into contact with creation’s
light. The “Á” sound on the other hand is full of light, warmth and
admiration. Its Universe is the endlessness of a quiet sky (“ÉG”). The
sounds of ÉG reveal life (É) and warmth (G). Everything is full of
harmony, full of perfection and order in the Magyar ancient world.
The hardened form of the above M-G changed into the “K-M” sound
due to the people’s changed environment, which instead of rolling
hills incorporated the edgy, hard world of mountains, cliffs, glaciers
and fir trees. Each of these contained the wedge (ék) form of split
stones. The dominant zigzag line is the regularly repeated image of a
well-formed wedge. The reciprocal of the wedge (ék) is the Magyar
name of the stone: kő, and both are the product of the original “K”
sound which helped the concept of hardness to manifest in our three
dimensional world. All the ancient onomatopoeic words denoting
hardness begin with the same ancient K: kő (stone), kavics (pebble),
koccan (knocking sound given out by the touch of two hard objects),
kopog (to knock). This is the sound of a patriarchal society that has to
eke out a living in a new, hardened environment. So the K became
also the base for the word hím and kan, meaning the masculine
concept (hím) and individual maleness (kan), and the name of their
society (Hun, Kun).
The form of the split stone wedges gave rise – as mentioned earlier
to the form of the letter K in the Székely-Magyar rovás (runic writing).



The multiple wedges ensuing from the process of splitting stones gave
rise to the sign of multiplicity in the Magyar language, which is the K
(Ék = wedge, ékek = wedges).
The basic consonant of an agricultural society is the susurration of
windblown wheat fields: SSSSS (in Magyar spelling: SZ) Their basic
lines form the oblong body of a kernel of wheat (szem), which is the
same as the form of our eyes (szem). The eye permits light to enter;
the wheat kernel cradles the life-giving light within its own body. The
ancients knew that the primal form of the Sun was the same eye form
(szem), as that of the wheat kernel, and for this reason they called the
Sun Szem-úr (Lord of the eye). This Sun bore all its planet children.
The matriarchal branch of this culture perceived the Sun as a loving
mother and this concept is still present in the German form die Sonne;
patriarchal societies believed that out of the side of the male Sun
arose a flower (virág), which gave birth to our world (világ). Later
misunderstood fragments of this concept found their way to the Adam
and Eve rib story. This same concept remained unchanged from
ancient times within the English language as Sun, its high season as
Summer. They called themselves the children of Szem, which is
Szemere, who carry the light and life giving properties of Szem, the
Sun. The external female organ (szemérem) forms an eye shape also,
as does the island to which this group of people tied their origins,
which on the other hand is the mirror image of the great island within
the visible branches of the Milky Way. The word szemérmes (bashful)
belongs in this group, but it is a cultural word. The seeds of men
belong in this category and appear as semen in the English language,
as does seminare (to plant) in the Latin. The life-sustaining fruit of
the Szemere was the som (cornel), a red, eye-shaped, tart berry. They
called their home Somogy, which means the land of the som berries.
They may also have called it the reciprocal of the S-m consonants, the
M-s, like Moson. Both Somogy and Moson are still the names of



counties in Hungary and the names of several towns.
The vocabulary and the symbols, which reflect the original
environment of these above mentioned groups, can easily be
recognized in other languages also, no matter how far the original
bearer of this culture wandered from his home. The Magyar group
always maintained its dotted or raised globe-like designs along with
the original wavy lines just as the Hun-Kun peoples preserved their
zigzag, the Szemere their eye-motifs and their derivatives along with
the basic sound and word groups which were based upon them. A
huge word group surrounded these ancient concepts showing the
importance and also the antiquity of these sounds. The presence of a
sound and the corresponding word is the gene marker of a people’s
culture. But while the genetic markers talk only about the material
characteristics of a group, the sound or the voice tells us about the
nature of their environment, the customs of their society, their beliefs
and language and, above all, their picture of the Universe which they
preserved in their consciousness, and its connection with the then and
now.
I will mention a few samples of such word groups from Adorján
Magyar’s „Az ősműveltség”:
The G-M (Magyar) word group’s words:
Ég —is the word for God and the Universe
Íge — the Word of God, which is creation itself.
Igaz — light, truth
Igi, ügy — the apple of the eye. The ancient representations of
humans show the very distinctive round eyes, which denote the
ethnicity of these people.



Egy — the concept of one and God
Ügek — the name of the “old God”, the God of antiquity. Its base is
Ük, which means a distant ancestor.
Óg —a vaulted building, which imitates the dome of the sky
Ág, aga — branch. It was the first tool of the agricultural people,
which was made of wood or the discarded antler of a dear. This
agricultural tool was in use from the most ancient times in the
Carpathian Basin.[11] The shape of this tool became the form of A in
the Székely-Magyar rovás writing.
Ag, ug, mag, méh, — these all mean land, earth.
Mag — a round kernel, such as the cherry pit. It is the name of a
unifocal geometrical form and symbol of masculine concepts. The Sun
was considered a mag, from which life grew.
Magyar — originally it meant man of the seed, a son of God, a human
being. Its variation, written with “K” is Makar which means happy in
ancient Greek. Magor or Makar -- Sungod was the “Happy God” of
Magyar lore. The saying still lives on: Szegény ember szándékát
Boldog Isten birja: “The plans of poor men are tended to by our Happy
God.”
Gyöngy — round kernel and also a pearl. Gyöngy-virág (lit.: flower of
pearl = lily of the valley) was the Magyar group’s symbol of Mother
Earth, Mother of Life.
Gyümölcs -— reciprocal form of the mag (kernel) and the life that
grows out of it.
Gyám, gyombó — a walking stick with rounded head, made of
specifically grown wood. It was the weapon of the Magyars in ancient



times.
Gomoly - originally it meant the ancient nebulae of which our world
condensed. Today it means a cumulus cloud.
The K-N (Kún) word group’s basic vocabulary.
Kő — stone, which begins with the sound of hardness.
ék — wedge. It was their first tool
kan (a male), hím (masculine gender),— masculine concepts.
makk — acorn, masculine symbol
ne, nő — female
Kám — male ancestor of the Kun-Magyar people.
kitta — arrow
The M-N word group
The M-N word group was at home in the material world and this word
group expresses the concepts of God and life sustaining materials. It is
also connected with walking and wandering.
Mén — stallion. Its white variety is the symbol of the constantly
wandering moon. It is also the name of the ancestral father of their
migrating societies..
Menny — heaven. It is not the endless Universe (Ég) of the Magyar
group, but a clearly defined place, a country.
mony — an egg. It also meant the egg-shape of the Universe.
monnó — their ancient word of one



manó — man
manyó — old woman
menyecske — young woman
Female concepts here are connected with water and moistness:
nedű, mut, mat, mad — words of wetness of mother, and female
concepts.
nád — reed, which grows on wet lands
Nádszál kisasszony — the Magyar “Reed Princess” and the Egyptian
fairy, Neit are the same.
Sz[12]-M (Szemere) word group’s basic vocabulary:
Szem — eye. It is also their name for the Sun.
szem — eye, organ of sight.
szem — the oblong seed of cereal plants, such as wheat, oat, etc.
szunnyad, szumnyad — to slumber, which is represented in their art
as a partially or fully closed eye.
som — cornel cherry, a red, tart, oblong fruit. It has two variants: one
variety has one seed, which is a masculine symbol, and there is also a
thorny bush, where the fruits have several seeds and thus they became
the female symbols of this society.
szemcse — granule
szám — number
számos — numerous. The seeds of wheat (szem) are encased in a pod



of 3 x 6 rows. The number six has become the base of their numeral
system. In their carved writing (rovás) the numbers were in the shape
of wheat seeds. Their later Sumerian culture preserved the six-based
numerical system.
szemel — to pick something one-by-one
számol — to count
szánt — to till, which makes the earth ready to grow wheat.
szamár — donkey. It was Szemúr’s symbolic animal. Its Christianized
version is the story: “Why is a cross on the donkey’s back?” in which
Jesus assumes the role of the ancient Szemúr. The answer is: Because
he sat on the back of the donkey. The symbol of light and sun was the
cross in Magyar mythology and it was unmistakably present on the
donkey’s back.
The K-R (Körös) word group’s basic vocabulary:
kör — a circle. It is a two-dimensional expression, or projection of the
three dimensional globe.
kering — to revolve
kerekedik — to rise. It is the result of a striving toward perfection.
keres — looking for something, walking round about.
kerek — round.
kar — arm
karol — to embrace
Károly — a personal name. In ancient times it meant an eagle, along



with the word:
király — king
köröz — to circle something
kér — to ask. A reply is needed to round out the information.
kérd — as above
kérés — request
kéreg — a hard shell, as the bark of the tree.
kor — a unit of time, an age, as in the Latin aetas.
karaj — a round slice of something (like a slice of bread).
köröm — nail
karom — claw, the long, circular claw of birds and some animals.
kert — garden, an enclosed territory.
karika, kerék — hoop, wheel, the material manifestation of a line
which returns within itself.
karima — the upper edge of a round vessel
korsó — a round pitcher
körös — denotes a circular path of a drawing, a river, etc.
ÍGE — THE WORD OF GOD
As we have seen the prerequisite of the spread of sound is the
presence of matter. Since matter plays a focal role in the creation of



sounds I include sounds into the world of symbols just as much as
the symbols of later ages where matter takes on a much denser
substance to help create vessels, statues, and writing which are also
the tools of transmitting thoughts. All these symbols carry the main
characteristics of matter: Matter can be formed, it is receptive, it
remembers and nurtures. These characteristics elevated matter to
symbolize motherhood and this knowledge has been made part of the
language structure also as the words anya and anyag indicate.
Similarly one finds it in the Sz-M word group’s category as mother
and matter. The word mother-tongue expresses the knowledge of
matter’s role in language formation and has nothing to do with the
now presumed social factors as the background indicator of this word.
The word mother-tongue is not the result of a patriarchal-matriarchal
strife for superiority, but a careful observation of the processes of
nature and creation. Since we mentioned social factors one has to
realize that mothers, women were the guardians and transmitters of
ancient traditions through their songs, stories, prayers and
embroideries to their children, answering the innate call of matter.
In order for matter to be born and take its place in the Universe we
need a Creator and a created world in which God expresses himself;
consciousness, which cradles in its ancient layers a universal
awakening of universal proportions and intellect, which is able to
transmit this knowledge and serve creation through it. Everything
follows this same pattern, the development of language and symbols
too, since the ancients expressed the wonders of creation in beautiful
imagery. Let me show a few examples:
The old Christmas traditions are of ancient origin, and their images
can be found in early Paleolithic drawings[13] and in Christmas
oriented ceremonies, songs and prayers even today. Here the main
participant is the Cock (Kokas): “...The Cock spoke and called for
Mary: wake up, wake up beautiful Virgin...”[14] When scientists could



not come to an agreement what came first, the chicken, or the egg
they jokingly asked a Magyar peasant about his thoughts. The old man
answered without hesitation: the rooster came first. The scientists
took this answer as a joke, laughed and let it rest until the story found
its way into an ethnographer’s collection. Yet researching the language
one finds the deeper truth in this answer. The call of the Cock
awakened pre-creation’s virgin matter, our original Sleeping Beauty.
The ancient mother of creation, the Great Madonna who bore the
world and light[15] (világ), who became Mary in the much later
Christian times. According to this knowledge, the Creator brought
forth matter from the depths of his own body just the same way as we
scatter our own matter into the world with every breath we take,
along with our words. Later sound waves transmit the gentler waves
of a settled Universe, symbolized by the song of Égúr’s (God’s) Ágas
(stag), Ákos, who is the Miracle Stag, Guiding Stag of the Magyars.
The voice of the Cock breaks into the world like an explosion, utilizing
the K sound as it first reaches primordial matter. Later the rooster also
becomes the symbol of the dawn and of fire. So the first word of the
Cock also meant the time of the first dawn, which interrupted the
unchanged silence of pre-creation, when the Creator’s eternal rest
gave way to Light. The breaking of the dawn presupposes a force,
which brought matter and sound to the surface.
Magyar ancestors perceived that the dawn “laughs” (kacag), and they
knew about the “loudness of high heaven”.[16] It is not difficult to
conclude that God’s first expression was a hearty laugh, which is the
highest expression of the joy of life. The word kacag (to laugh) also
means light, shine. Thus God’s Firstborn was Light.
Ancestral memories tell us that our ancients were aware of the fact
that waves transmit sounds and in their consciousness the entire
Universe laughed, rang, talked and while speaking, it scattered itself



into the Universe.
The November issue of the 1997 American Discovery Magazine’s
article, the Echo of the Big Bang”[17] talks about two different kinds of
light, which were born at the time of the Big Bang. The first light was
born in the instant of the first explosion; the other, now visible light was
born around the time when nebulae started to take on shape. Later it
also stated that the Universe is a very bright and noisy place because of
this secondary light and its radiation. Remember the Magyar word
kacag, which means both to laugh and to shine: this “modern”
knowledge was encoded into the language at the time of its birth.
And finally: “...the undulation of matter is barely more than sound
waves in an immense, expanding plasma.” We have to stand in awe
before the knowledge of the ancients, as all this was preserved in
their language and traditions, which talk about the noise of the high
heavens and the laughing, and shiny break of dawn.[18].
God’s word in Magyar is expressed by the word Íge, which is verb
and noun at the same time to indicate the undifferentiated aspects
of force and matter in Creation.
In connection with the word Ég (God, sky, Universe) and wave
motions it is important to talk about the two different kinds of seas of
Magyar lore: Ég tengere (the sea of heaven), and the Óperenciás
tenger (the sea called Óperenciás).
The word Ég means the endless Universe and God. The sea of Heaven
(Ég) tells us that our ancients knew that the Universe is filled with
waves: the waves of Life — which we mention today only according to
their different properties as light, heat, magnetism, electricity,
thought, emotion, mentioning only a few — heave and fulfill their
creative job which uphold the Universe. The knowledge that this
energy, in its capacity of the Creator, is One, became part of human



consciousness at the time of creation. They called this One, universal
energy the Son of God, Little Son (Fiacska), Radiant God, Beautiful
God, Happy God and a thousand other names which reflect a very
personal and loving knowledge of the Creator. This energy, which
created the world, is, according to the ancients, Life, which arrived on
the wings of Light. The earlier mentioned double feature of light
supports this view. The first light of the Big Bang is Life; the later light
brings Life to the world. God, who lives in a constant Universe,
expresses his essence with the transmission of Life. The Universe of
solitude is filled with constant change, opposites of hot and cold, fire
and water, dualities that cuddle close to one another as instruments of
creation. An old Magyar minstrel song tells us with these words:
The Ocean of the Universe is in constant motion
Whispering legends of God’s creation
Always-new songs ever changing
Always-old songs, everlasting.[19]
The instrument of transmitting Life is Light, in which there is
complete balance of force and matter; each received later different
roles in creation.
The P-R word group’s Óperenciás Sea belongs in the two-consonantal
category, which already utilizes matter that appeared in the process of
creation. The words in the P-R word group express some kind of
transitory state, which I will explain later. For now, the word
Óperenciás is connected with the idea of twirling (pereg) and our
ancients knew that this sea is attached to the twirling, rotating Earth:
it is the layers of moisture, the clouds and all the waters on this globe
which twirl with the earth and earthly oceans. The Earth rotates, the
oceans rotate, and the atmosphere rotates at the same time and this



knowledge again was built into the structure of the language. Worldly
scientists, incapable of viewing language and the world in an organic
manner, came up with the idea that the name of the Óperenciás Sea
has been derived from the name Ober-Enns, a non-existing name of a
non-existing place. According to Mór Ballagi, linguist and
ethnographer the Óperenciás Sea is an “uncertain place which is very,
very far from here”, and became synonymous with a great distance.
[20] It was not this sea a great distance away, but those who traveled
beyond it, as was the case in many of the old stories, which are
testimony to the fact that our ancestors did travel beyond the Earth
and her atmosphere, a feat that is ascribed only to the travelers of our
20th century. They were able to complete travels “beyond the
Óperenciás Sea” without machines with the help of their ancient and
refined consciousness.
After this necessary detour, let us examine the statement I made, that
the human consciousness absorbed all the events and experiences
from the beginning of creation and later it made this knowledge part
of the language. How is this possible? We can answer this question,
always to the limits of our present day knowledge, with the help of
the Magyar language. Presently, the new findings of quantum physics
help us realize the depth and yes: the power of knowledge enshrined
in the Magyar language. I would like to give some examples showing
the organic connection between the knowledge of today’s physics and
the Magyar language by quoting some statements from the XII.
Chapter of my book Kezdeteink (Our Beginnings).

Organic Magyar Linguistics, part 1.b
„...Humans of the Fairy Age [21], also referred to as the Golden Age,
were at home in the land of universal consciousness. They knew and
understood the forces that keep our world moving and Man
consciously served the forces of creation, and through it he was a
conscious part of Life Universal.
They recognized the parents of creation as the invisible Ancient Force
(Ős-Erő) who stands above creation, symbolized in a dark coat
decorated with stars, and the Ancient Matter (Ős-anyag) who was
symbolized in white attire. The product of their immaculate embrace
was Life, which arrived on the wings of light. Life contains the
properties of the parents – force and matter – in perfect equilibrium.
They made this knowledge part of the structure of their language too.
Ar — force and the masculine element of creation
Any — matter and the female element of creation
AR + ANY — the complete balance of the two as expressed in
ARANY — which is Light
Should someone accuse me of the arbitrary use of language I would
like to quote some of the findings of modern physics dealing with the
questions of Life and Light.
Matter.
Page 473
„..Today’s scientists can perform many experiments that together reveal a



great diversity of properties in matter. Some of these properties suggest
that matter is continuous, with a wave-like characteristic. Others suggest
that matter is discrete... it follows that matter is both particulate and
wave-like.... at the present time we can only accept the dual nature of
matter, and the inherent uncertainty that goes with it.” [22]
Force and motion:
Page 475
5. “ Force, torque. There are many kinds of force, but the name can be
applied to any physical agency that causes (or tries to cause) a body to
change its state of motion or internal strain..” [23]
Magyar language sharply distinguishes between force and energy (erő
and erőny). It holds fast to the concept that Force is universal in its
effect.
Energy
“Energy is the capacity of a body or system for doing work.” [24]
Magyar consciousness knows of only one, universal energy, which is
Life. All other forms of energy as mentioned in science today
(physical, chemical energies, etc.) are but a part of this universal
energy.
Light.
“ Light is an electromagnetic wave, that is, a wave whose carrier
oscillations and fluctuations in the value of the electric and magnetic
field strengths at each point along the path of the light ray. These carrier
oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of travel of the wave, and
hence light is an example of a transverse wave (sound waves are
longitudinal waves)... When a light ray interacts with matter, energy is



absorbed from the ray in finite bundles or quanta, which are best
described in terms of wave packets. These quanta of light are called
photons. Since photons can be thought as particles of light, light is
regarded as having a dual nature — particles or waves.” [25]
The Magyar symbol of light is the isosceles cross (+). It was believed
to symbolize the two crossed sticks with which the ancients generated
fire.
But, according to the above, the isosceles cross leads us to a far more
ancient thought. It symbolizes the crossed path of light. The symbol of
fire was the isosceles cross turned on its side: x and clearly
differentiated between the two: the limited, earthly fire and that of
universal light. It is by no accident that the former (+) symbol is used
in mathematics as a sign of the positive, of adding, increasing, and we
still cross out something with the symbol x.
The symbol of the ancient Magyar priest, the Gyula, - whose duty was
to maintain light, both spiritual and physical - was a bundle of rods,
which may well represent the above mentioned “energy bundles”. In
some agricultural regions bundles of wheat are called Jesus, whose
role is identical with the pre Roman Christian Lord of the Seed.
Magyar archaic prayers mention that these “bundles” are bundles of
light. For further information see my study on the Magyar Christmas
(Karácsony). All these Magyar linguistic connections clearly express
the double nature of light and today’s scientists hold true the same
facts. One must keep in mind that all these scientific data were
embedded into the Magyar language at its birth, thousands of years
before today’s science began, and this knowledge is a reflection of the
Golden Age, the Age of Light.
Life.

“What is life? Life is the most complex state of organization of matter
known in the Universe.”
and
Page 392-393
“ The simple chains of amino acids are called polypeptides. The proteins,
the fundamental constituents of the living cells, are very special
polypeptides. Not only does each protein have a very specific
construction, but also it is folded into a special three-dimensional
configuration, which it maintains as long as it is biologically active.
The properties of the protein molecule cannot be deduced from its
chemical constitution alone; the properties depend crucially on the
natural selection operating at a pre-biological stage, favouring the
formation of a small class of important proteins.” [26]
According to fragments of Magyar origin-sagas that have survived,
God’s Son, who is Life, at the beginning of his creative role,
descended into the depths of the Universe and brought up all the
slumbering seeds. His father scattered these seeds upon the created
world. Depending on where these seeds fell, they became plants, or
fish, or land animals and finally men. Here we find the concept of the
pre-biological selection process of today’s science. The fact that life on
this earth depends upon its three dimensional structure opens further
vistas to the Magyar saying: “Three is the Magyar truth” („Három a
magyar igazság”) especially when we take into consideration that the
Magyar word for truth, and light is the same (ég/ig). According to
scientists as long as a protein is biologically active, in other words, as
long as it is alive, it works according to such a triple structure.
“ The way in which protein molecules are made raises a fundamental
question: which came first, the protein or the nucleic acid, that contains
the protein plan? What did it evolve from, and how?”



Adorján Magyar mentioned that it is no accident that all our ancient
ethnic groups used a red and sour fruit as their symbol of life. He
proposed that these fruits may well be symbols of the nucleic acid. A
Celtic legend talks about “some sour fruits” of the Tree of Life that the
fairies guard, but at the birth of this legend the name of this fruit was
already forgotten in their culture. They must have met the concept
during their stay within the Carpathian Basin and took it with them to
the British Isles. These sour fruits tell us about the ancients’
knowledge of the structure of cells and it also solves the seemingly
unsolvable question.
“ The onset of natural selection in some primitive form is often
considered to be the point at which life began. An interesting and
possibly very important fact about the genetic code is its ubiquity on
Earth. The DNA molecule contains the plans of proteins in a coded form
where each amino acid of the protein is described by three successive
rungs of the DNA ladder. What is striking is that the coding is identical
in all terrestrial life. A possible implication of this is that all life
descended from a single ancestral system.... The single ancestor theory is
not the only possible explanation of the universality of the genetic code,
but there are other peculiarities of the code which are also consistent
with this particular theory.”
According to Magyar traditions God (Ég) is one (Egy), universal
(egyetemes) and is the ancestor of all. These names are linguistically
the same. He is the ancient force, the ancient “doer” (Ős Tenő). His
Firstborn is also universal, he is the universal energy and he is Life
who arrives on the wings of light. He is the Golden God of the
Magyars. He is the active principle of Creation, the Creator of our
material world. All that is, is descended from this one ancestor and all
carry this memory in their genetic makeup.
“ There is an independent piece of evidence also favouring the single



ancestor theory. This concerns the optical activity of amino acids. In the
laboratory, any complex amino acid can exist in one of the two forms
which differ only in that they are mirror images of one another. The
forms are referred to as right-handed (dextro) and left-handed (laevo) in
analogy with the gloves of a pair that are identical in all respects except
that they are mirror images. In biological systems, all amino acids are
left-handed. (This is not just a matter of semantics, a left-handed
molecule rotates the plane of vibration of an electromagnetic wave one
way, while a right handed molecule rotates it the other way. Thus
handedness can be measured using polarized light.) There is no obvious
reason why both forms of amino acid should not coexist; if amino acids
are made in a laboratory, both forms are produced in equal amounts.
This is true of the Miller-Orgel type of experiment. One way of explaining
the left-handedness phenomena is in terms of life being descended from a
single event and place.”
I have often mentioned in this book the fact that Hungarian art always
uses a mirror construction. This is a reflection of the Magyar mirroring
world-view. It also represents the fact that our ancients knew that
energy and matter are essentially the same, that the two can be
transformed into one another; this knowledge is again part of the
Magyar language structure. Today’s science is only now approaching
the knowledge of the ancients.
Explanations of the pictures at the end of this section are as follows:
Illustration 1.
The picture of the lower left line: It shows the endoplasmic reticulum,
where most proteins are created. The nature of the protein is determined
by its RNA. The “laboratory” where the proteins are created holds the
finger-print of the creator..., and beyond this it also reminds us of the
ancient Magyar wave designs. Let us compare this with the Magyar



horn-decoration below it:
Explanation of the following picture: This is a typical protein molecule.
The chain of amino acids forms within itself several times and thus it
takes on the shape of a sphere to accommodate molecules that are yet to
be taken up.
According to this, matter here and in the Universe assumes a round,
globular shape. This shape is called mag in Magyar and it is the basis
of the Magyar language and designs.
Page 226. picture no. 2:
It is an illustration of the mirroring world-view. The two-headed
“Sunbird” is a symbol of light’s double nature. The center of the sun
here shows the square, electromagnetic lines that were discovered in
the sun by scientists only recently. The flower, which grows out of this,
represents a flower (virág), light and world (világ), which is
expressed with the same word. It also helps us decide which came
first: the hen or the egg, the nucleic acid or the cell.
Illustration 3.
This is another fine example of this mirroring world-view. I have to
emphasize again that there is no Magyar folk art that is not
constructed in this mirroring manner. One has to think of the optical
activity of amino acids and their right, or left-handed appearance in
the laboratory.
Illustration 4. is the image of the DNA molecule. According to Magyar
legends, the thread of life is woven by fairies and according to some
legends, there are pearls woven into these threads. When the thread
of life breaks, the pearls scatter and the life of the person comes to an
end.



Illustration 5. shows the proteins of the muscles. Let us compare them
with
Illustration 6., which shows an ancient woven fabric out of which
according to legends — the fairies weave “soldiers”. The Magyar name
of soldier is katona and it has a large number of linguistic connections
with the words of hand, to bind (kéz, köt, etc.). The red patterns of
the fabric are the “soldiers”, while the entire woven piece is a replica
of the structure of muscles.
Illustration 7. This is the illustration of life’s appearance on this planet
according to today’s science. According to this, the vertebrates
appeared 500 million years ago. The ancient legends of life in the
Carpathian Basin mirror life of some 25-30 million years ago. [27]
We have little idea of the vast knowledge of our ancients. Their
knowledge in their time was public knowledge, since its images were
sewn into their embroideries, are parts of the carvings of the men folk
and even their everyday utensils were used to hold and preserve their
knowledge of the Universe. Their mirroring world-view begins with
the thready kusza, which is the image of the world in the process of
formation. This too is part of their knowledge, which has survived to
our day.

We learn from the above the following:
Our ancestors were fully aware of the double nature of matter:
particle and wave like. We learn of this knowledge since it was built



into the structure of language concerning Force and Matter. The Word,
or if I so desire, the ORGANIC CONNECTION BETWEEN LANGUAGE
AND CREATION EXISTED FROM THE FIRST MOMENT ON. THIS
FACT BEARS TESTIMONY OF THE ANCESTRAL NATURE OF THIS
LANGUAGE.
They also knew the difference between force and energy just as much
as today’s science makes a difference between the two. The force
represents a potential for tension, which can give rise to action [31];
the energy means a work process.
Scientists today recognize that light is a transverse wave. Our
ancestors knew this too since they symbolized light with an isosceles
cross. Later societies, which became dissociated with this ancient
knowledge, believed that the cross represented the two sticks which
were rubbed together when starting a fire. Both are true since truth is
universal in all layers of consciousness. At the same time our ancestors
knew that truth (Igazság) is light (Ég) and one with God (Ég). These
words included also the knowledge that, at the time of creation, fire
and heat were generated. In those days this knowledge was built
within the word roots of the language; it was enough to say the
corresponding vowel and consonant and the entire mythology was
before us. Today we have to say a full sentence to achieve a similar
level of understanding: “In the light of truth.” So the Sun-cross of our
ancestors was the symbol of this transverse light wave and later also
of the sun which transmits this light to us. Our mothers transmitted
this knowledge through their embroideries, where the knowledge that
the world (világ) is made of light (világ) was expressed with cross
stitches. They captured the moments of creation in the material
(embroidery) they worked with. The expression of this world-view is
particularly strong in Hungary where the old Magyar religion survived
the longest, in the once Avar-Magyar region, where it can still be
found. There is still an organic bond between consciousness and



symbol.
The word Keresztfa (transl.: cross of wood) is unique to the Magyar
language. These crosses are all over the Magyar landscape (where
they escaped the ravages of war and Communism) on the roadsides,
at the edge of agricultural fields. Today it is believed that they
originated with Jesus’ cross. This cross was used thousands of years
before Christianity and it was the symbol of light emerging from the
Sun. [32] Waddell brings these “wooden crosses” into connection with
the Sungod, Tas, and the resurrection in early Trojan and early
Sumerian symbology. Tas was the name of one of the Princes who
participated in founding the modern Hungarian state eleven hundred
years ago.
Today’s science talks about a pre-biological age of natural selection in
connection with the development of polypeptides. Their construction
is “very specific and shows a three dimensional configuration.” [33]
This natural selection, which occurs at a pre-biological state had its
beginning in the world of consciousness and became a reality which
we enjoy even in the present.
The ancient shape of creation is a globe. As consciousness turned
toward matter this form became the symbol of perfection, of
completeness. The round kernel (Mag) was the ancient symbol
Magyars in the Carpathian Basin, both in language and materially. We
have also seen that the protein molecule during its evolutionary
process tries to achieve the form of a sphere. Even today we may say:
“...Let’s round it out...” meaning to bring a process to perfection. This
sentence lets ancient consciousness seep into our daily lives.
The endoplasmic reticulum draws lines around a central sphere
(gömb ), kernel (mag) and the same image is repeated in our folk art,
beginning in the Neolithic and continues even today. The ancient



sound of the sphere ( gömb), or (mag) uses the mild G sound as
mode of expression even today in the quiet voices of very young
babies who remind us of the miracle of the first beginning. The
environment of this soft G is the world of low hills, babbling
(gurgulyázó [34]) brooks, round fruits and lilies of the valley
(gyöngyvirág) grown from tubers (gumó). According to our ethnic
name (which has its roots in a world when mankind did not develop
the social and political structures of national existence), which is
Magyar, we too were part of this landscape, as the people of the Mag
(kernel, seed) and are children of Mag-Úr (Lord of the Kernel, the
Sun). Again there is a complete and organic connection between
the world of consciousness, matter, sound and picture.
Hungarian linguists educated in a foreign-centered academia, to
which they became fully committed, try to originate the Magyar name
from the Mansi. With this act they contradict their own and the Indo
European linguistic rules, since the G sound will never change into N
according to the presently held theories. In order to understand the
contact of origin of the Magyar and Mansi names we have to look into
two different word groups: the m-g and the m-n group, and their
world view.
It is important information concerning the optical activity of amino
acids that any complex amino acid can appear in only two forms and
these are one another’s mirror images. This phenomenon is reflected
in the Magyar language’s mirroring capacity, which either enlightens
two different sides of the same object or idea on the elemental level of
creation, or it expresses the interchangeability of force and matter.
I would like to illustrate the former through the gamó, gömb and
mag words, where gamó means a bent form which is in the process
of becoming a sphere, a mag, as we have seen in the illustration of
the development of protein molecules; the gömb (sphere) means the



finished product and mag its stabilized state. Linguistically the
gömb and mag are one another’s reciprocals.
This mirroring world-view appears in all branches of Magyar art from
the painted eggs to embroideries among which I believe the two
headed sunbird to be a very important pattern inherited from great
antiquity.
Not only the amino acids’ activity was preserved by our ancestors and
transmitted still, but also the patterns of their weaving are reflections
of the body’s “fabric”, the muscle. The picture of the DNA molecule
does not need further explanation; the pearly life threads of the fairies
are clearly visible. Again, as always the consciousness and the
symbol go hand in hand.
The ancient prayers, which cradle ancient memories, talk about the
order of creation up to our days, wrapped in Christian clothing:
...I have a Lord Jesus Christ,
Above my head there is a ragling
He sat upon it
Its branch bore a bud
The bud bore a flower,
the flower bore St. Anna
St. Anna bore the Virgin Mary
The Virgin Mary bore her holy Son. [35]
In this pre-Christian vernacular, the above tells us the following: The
sky’s (Ég) tree bore a bud (the round atoms and suns), these bore



their flower (virág and világ, world and light are synonymous in
Magyar), St. Anna, the Great Madonna, is the personification of
creation’s ancient matter, who bears worlds in her womb and gives life
to our world (the Virgin Mary) too. God sits above all these, as on top
of the holding raft of a roof, in eternal magnificence. The same world
view is reflected in all the other ancient prayers. [36]
According to our ancient consciousness the first stirring of Force, the
masculine principle, brought the base of creation to the surface of
creation’s waves, which is matter and this first motion was connected
to sound. The Word of God (Íge), the crow of the Cock, the laughter
of creation, its ringing (like the sounds of small bells) were the
sounds of the first beginning. Here I need to mention the Magyar
word for song: dal, which is part of a huge word group. Dániel
Mindszenti [37], the great teacher of 19th century Magyars, believed
that music was the universal language of Mankind: “As I am looking at
its origin: music is the product of the forces of nature, consequently the
musical talent is born with us humans and for this reason as long as
humanity resides on this earth, this talent will always be with us.”
The composer and educator, Zoltán Kodály, wrote: “What could the
motivation have been which sent me against all odds on the straight
paths, sometimes flying, sometimes dragging the wagon of my life? A
hopeless, unreciprocated love affair. A love of the people whose visible
one-thousand year old history, and even more her several thousand year
old history, which lives on in her language, draws me with unparalleled
strength....” [38] Later: “The basic layer of the soul cannot be built from
two different materials. Man can have only one mother tongue,
musically speaking too...” [39]
So the above quoted teachers and musicians recognized the first
stirrings of our beginnings, including the language within the basic
layer of the soul, in our ancient consciousness. These layers have an



organic connection in both music and language. Later we shall see
how this organic connection influences human characteristics, man’s
calling, his aesthetic values, structure of society: his entire life.
The two-consonantal, monosyllabic word dal expresses the early
connection with matter during creation. It shows the time when
matter still flowed in soft waves toward its fulfillment. In other words:
The song of God is the created world itself. The singing God’s work is
song: he creates song, and its melody is the order of the singing
Universe. With his song the world will be rounded out. (In Magyar:
Dalos Isten dolga dal: dalt dall [40], s dallama a dalos világ rendje
. Dalával dalmahodik a világ.) We may realize that in Magyar all this
is expressed within the borders of the D-L consonantal group. Related
to the dal is our dél (noon, south) word, which is the brightest time of
the day, or the sunniest part of the world; the word deli, meaning a
stately, splendidly attired person. Our God of Song is deli (shiny),
dalos (singing) and dolgos (diligent.). The messenger of this two
consonantal, beginning world and God is the Magyar Ákos, or Ékes,
the Shining Stag, the Miracle Stag of the Magyars, who carries the
stars and galaxies, in fact all creation upon his body and helps to
dispel the darkness with his songs, with which he teaches humanity.
The name of this early Universe is dalhon, the land of songs, which
one would like to delegate into the world of storybooks these days.
Here I need to mention that man cannot imagine anything that has no
base in his consciousness. The greater a person’s creative talent is, the
more sensitive his “antennae” are to tune in to the knowledge that
surrounds him, which is part of the Universe, the more perfect his
creations will be, with which he blesses the world. Today’s measuring
instruments show for example that some of Mozart’s music transcends
the three dimensional world and the dances of the honey-bees reach
their full significance in the sixth dimension.
The following concepts belong in this singing world: the shiny and



colorful delice bird, the dalimadár, which is also a bird with a
beautiful voice, dalmahodás (rounding out). The earthly messenger
of the singing God is the Táltos, the ancient priest of the Magyars,
who teaches mankind with gentle songs and not laws etched into
stone. The dalos Táltos [41],(the singing Táltos) keeps the wonders
of this singing Universe alive in the people’s souls, and his song is
always in the creative service of the Universe.

Organic Magyar Linguistics, part 2.a
In Adorján Magyar’s view the Magyar language is creation expressed
in sounds and it is so perfect that it cannot be the product of a human
mind, but it was created by the great forces of nature like the crystals
and snowflakes.
Today’s science of linguistics holds that the individual sounds of the
language are without meaning, but for some reason there is order in
the changing of sounds.
To believe this statement is as irrational as to believe that the
individual numbers don’t carry meaning and they are suddenly vested
with it in a mathematical process.
When we look for the meaning of the individual sounds, we have to
return to the formation of language development to find out if there
are any meaningful words made of one sound? Indo-European
linguistics did not find any nor did it find any ancient monosyllabic
words that express feelings, as mentioned before.
When we examine the Magyar sound base, such words come easily to
our aid. These words are part of the ancient song (dal), and are still
part of the language of our infants. These words express our
sentiments in the most concentrated manner. These words formed
humanity’s first language, the language of emotions. Indo
European linguists did not find these ancient word roots. Here I
mention only a few, where the root of the word is monosyllabic: bú,
víg, agg (búsong), hőköl, haboz, gyászol, dédelget. (sorrow, glad,
worried, to be startled, hesitates, mourns, to pet.) These words are all
part of our ancient emotional language. But beyond this, there is our



first emotion-based language and its words of emotion, which belong
to the world of the one-vowel ancient words. The word ancient,
which I use, does not fully express the Magyar word ős. Its further
explanation will follow in the chapter dealing with the meaning of
vowels. The heavily vowel-based Hawaiian language may hold much
information about language development if researched in this context.
This research is the job of the future.
The Ancient Meaning of Vowels
TC "The Ancient Meaning of Vowels" \f C \l "2"
The words of the first emotional language consisted of vowels.
Ó — It is the word of profound amazement as it first opens up to the
marvels of creation; later this word became synonymous with the
concept of old, ancient, while maintaining its one sound form. In
Indo-European languages we cannot find such one-sound words
that mean antiquity and this fact is one significant proof to support
the antiquity of the Magyar language. Later this Ó became the word of
the concept JÓ (good) at the early stages of consonantal development.
Ő — today when we respectfully talk about a third person, we use this
sound. At the beginning the only “other” was God, and the Ő denoted
Him. He was the only Ő, marked with a sound that arose from the
depth of our being, remembering and pointing toward the Creator.
This vowel became Ő-S (Ő-like) through the added consonant. The
meaning of Ő-S is God-like, ancestral, and became the word for the
concept of ancestral. With our present vocabulary we may call the ŐS
Istenes (God-like). The earlier the ancestor we talk about, the closer
we come to God, the ancestor of our ancestors until we reach a time,
where there is no question of who our first ancestor was.
A — is the sound of the sleeping matter. It is a relaxing sound which
helps babies to fall asleep in their mother’s arms: a...a...a.... As



ancient concepts attached to this sound, it became later connected
with words of antiquity, of something or someone ancient. The word
agg (old) consists of two sounds, the first is the sound of sleeping,
primordial matter (a), the second sound (g) brings the warmth of
Creation to us. Ancient Matter, as the Great Madonna of the Magyars
appears as a very old (AGG) woman under the wings of the Turul
Sunbird in Scythian symbology. The words: avétt (old material), avas
(rancid), avar (old leaves under the trees) denote materials which
passed the time of their usefulness. Later languages formed their
concept of antiquity with the help of these words, like the Latin avus
(old) and ago (as compared to creation.).
Á — is the sound of amazement as man first realized light: it is the
sound of awakening matter. Its later forms include among others the
word
ár (flood), árad (to overflow); both are connected with the motion of
waves.
E — It has an open and a closed pronunciation and this makes it
possible to express the undifferentiated state of force and matter. It
too expresses amazement, surprise. At the same time it is a word that
points to close-by objects. In “baby language” edi means sweetness.
The word Egy (one) is the mirror image of the word Ég (God, Sky)
and it is the symbol of creation’s male concept. The linguistic relative
of the word egy is the above edi (sweet). And truly, we still say: Édes
Istenem! (Our Sweet God!) Our Egy (One) God was our Sweet God
too. The word edi is also preserved in the word and concept of Eden,
which according to the Magyar language was the Garden of
Sweetness. Its E-sz (to eat) variation means taking in something and
so it is a word of the feminine concept and motherhood. The word
Egres (gooseberry) is an oblong fruit with many seeds and so it is a
feminine symbol.



É —é — él — élet This vowel and its implications are the sounds of
life, and they remember God’s ÉLŐ name. The oneness of Élet (life)
and Lélek (soul) points toward Him (Ő), God. This sound is at home
with both the sharp low- and high vowels (véka). In words like Étet
etet (to feed), lészen-leszen (will be) it seemingly stands for the sound
E, but by this substitution we achieve significant changes in meaning.
The word etet means feeding; étet means to feed someone a substance
he/she does not know about; this way there is a change in
consciousness between the ancient meaning of the E and É sounds.
I — is the tiny sound of smallness and of cold, which arches from the
cool drops of water (víz) toward the blue sky. Water’s specific heat is
the lowest on this earth. Our syllable Ig, which is a component of the
word igaz (truth and God) means light, as we talk about it even
today: „igazság fényében” (in the light of truth). According to today’s
science the material part of the Universe was present as a tiny dot
before creation’s “Big Bang”. At the time of this Big Bang, heat was
released which is still measurable in the Universe. Earlier we
mentioned that at the time of the explosion, the first sound was born,
which is called IGE (the word of God). As we prepare to speak, we
have to take a deep breath, which is accompanied by a process of
expansion, after which the sound leaves the body like an explosion
and it scatters matter, moisture and heat into the environment. The I
sound means something tiny (pici) and cold; the G sound means
warmth (meleg) and also contains the round lines of a sphere (gömb).
The explosion of creation started from a cold point, scattered warmth
into the Universe. All this knowledge is an integral part of the word
IGE which is God’s word. Scientists did not mention that the pre-Big
Bang concentrated matter was cold, but our language lets us know
through the meaning of the sounds and their organic relationship with
the subject, which is Creation in this case. Our consciousness tucked
away the memory of this Big-Bang as the occasion when God spoke.



Earlier we talked about the fact that the one vowel-one consonant
words are subject and action at the same time. The sharper and
mellower variations of the I sound carry this duality within. Its mild
pronunciation is related to the E sound (csillag-csellag=star), and it is
related to the Ű sound (idő-üdő=time, weather) too.
So the inclusionary property of the E-sz (to eat) is repeated with the
role I-sz (to drink), only the quality of the material that is taken in
changes: the E is capable of taking in solid materials, the I partakes of
liquids. The sound I expresses a dual state too. It expresses cold and
extreme heat in which there is a white glow of the heated material
(hideg=cold, izzó=glowing).
Its related sound is the
Ü — in which immobility (ül=to sit), and action unite (üg-et=to
trot). Ük (ancestor) looks back on us from the world of the two-toned
ancestral sounds, in which the whole has not yet known separation.
The word Úr brings the role of ancient matter – Űr - to the forefront
and along with it her property of negative action (szív=to suck). The
word Ügy is the word of possibilities. With its related I it signals also
the beginning of time. (idő, or üd=time). Üde (fresh, healthy) talks
about the first seconds of creation where the world is new, the air and
the environment are comfortable. Üd (üdöl / ünnepel) means a
holiday, to celebrate. Üdv is a state of bliss.
U — This sound comes from the depth of our being and gives our
unveiled self. The depth of caves (udu-k [1]) is our first home. Writer
and poet Dénes Kiss’ article concerning the words which were born
with the help of U gives clear voice – among others – to the bark of a
dog (kutya) which is a series of deep U-s (u-gat=to bark), which
literally means that the dog gives out an unbroken chain of U-U-U-U
U-U sounds. The U also has a dual role. The mono-consonantal,



ancient word, which expresses feelings, in this case bú (sorrow) unites
the sounds of creation (b ) and depth (ú). The U of the bi-consonantal
words does not change the essence of the word (huz, húz/to pull; lug,
lúg/alkali). In its later evolution it may be interchanged with the
sounds O (boglya-buglya), or the A (baba-bábu).
The word Úr (Lord) comes from the depths of Creation as it fills the
void (Űr).
Our vowels have dual roles with the exception of the Ó in which force
and matter admired creation in unison. So our first language, based
on vowels clearly expressed our God-Consciousness. According to
these words, our ancients knew their God as Good, as Ancestor, as
One, as Sweet, as Living, as the Word, as Truth, as Lord, as Guardian
[Jó, Ős, Egy, Éd(es), Élő, Ige, Igaz, Úr, Őr] and these words have
been used since the beginning of time with unblemished clarity.
The Ancient Meaning of Consonants
TC "The Ancient Meaning of Consonants" \f C \l "2"
Our vowels gave voice to the melody of Creation; our consonants
determined the direction, goal of this melody, whether or not it should
become a textless little melody or the parliamentary speech of István
Széchenyi. [2] The closer one is to the fountainhead of nature, the
easier can that person recognize the original meaning of sounds and
their role and his speech will be more refined and meaningful. This
person will also become a man of few words: if one sound can express
everything he has to say, he will not waste a great many other sounds
or words on a subject which he has already expressed. His speech will
be balanced and clear and his song will explore the heights of heaven.
This kind of speech and this kind of song will always look for
harmony.
The dances that accompany such harmonious, uplifting songs will



always awaken the higher centers of the body and will teach its
participant to use an erect posture with uplifted arms, and motions
that bring the body and the soul into harmony. The Hungarian poet
Gyula Illyés mentioned in one of his writings, that when he
participates in Magyar dances, his arms lift unwittingly toward
heaven, as if he were a participant of some ancient holy ceremony.
The person with an open consciousness is in constant contact with the
forces of creation, with God. His dance is an erect posture facing God
in creative harmony. As such he becomes the intermediary of the
forces of creation.
I am about to discuss the role of consonants. I will not follow the
presently used alphabetical order, but the order of creation in which
the consonants were born.
L — The concept of liquid substance (lé), the soul (lélek), the quiet
sound of waves belong to this consonant. This Magyar phonetic
structure appears in the Biblical story of creation when it mentions
that God’s spirit moved upon the face of the waters. In the Magyar
language the liquid substance forms an organic unit with the concept
of soul, breath and to float (lé — lélek — lélekzet — lebeg).
The word for life (él) is subject and verb at the same time. The word
edge (él) is associated with this concept, which becomes
understandable when one considers the cutting power of a blade of
grass, or any other manifestation of life. The tender blade of grass cuts
through a fallen dry leaf without moving it: such a feat cannot be
achieved even with the finest swords forged in Damascus. We learn
from this word that God’s edge, his sword is life. When our ancestors
talked about the sword of God, they talked about Life, Life universal.
Life and soul (élet and lélek) form an organic unit in the Universe
just as much as in our everyday life: without liquid and soul there



would be no life on this earth. Our bi-consonantal word lég (air)
belongs in this category and the meaning of its sounds is the
following: l=lé (liquid) é= lélek (soul) and g=ég (warmth).
R — is the manifestation of the ancient creative force. It is in the
sixteenth place of the modern Magyar alphabet. Its formation is the
result of the tongue repeatedly touching the upper palate and it
belongs among the liquid sounds, says Ballagi. Its relative is the L.
The Magyar Ar signals the pre-creation togetherness of ancient force
(Ar) and ancient matter who is his bride (Ara). With the separation of
the two, light was born, which our ancestors expressed with a very
meticulous word formation called ar-any, arany. And life arrived on
the golden wings of light to complete the immense task of creation. It
is for this reason we call Life the Golden God, among many other
loving names. The path of life was and is a transverse wave.
Ethnographers still look in vain for the world’s Golden Age since they
are unaware that the original Golden Age was the Age of Light, the
beginning of time, which started when Light first appeared in
creation. This Light is universal, as Life is too and was not restricted to
the world of photons, but it also meant the world’s illuminated state
of consciousness.
Ráró is the name of a bird of swift flight in the falcon family.
Interestingly many fast horses bore this name and we also have a story
about the Táltos-paripa (winged horse) with the name Ráró. It is
known that the Táltos horse flies faster, than the wind, faster than
thought. The individual sounds of Ráró tell us the following: The Á
sound means matter which was in contact with light, the Ó is the
sound when creation becomes first conscious of light, the R is the
sound of ancient force. These sounds swiftly fly (repít) us into the
realm of ancient consciousness, which is truly faster than even
thought.



Our related Egyptian culture calls – very correctly – its Sungod Ra,
which is the mirror image of the ancient force AR.
While the L sound brings elongated, soft waves, the R is frequently
represented by sharper, shorter and stronger oscillations: Re-meg
(quivers) Re-cseg, Rö-csög (crackles), Re-zeg (vibrates).
B — is Creation’s upper labial sound. Its pronunciation requires an
explosion-like intensity by which this sound is expelled through our
lips into the world. The word meaning procreation (which has some
undesirable connotations in present society), the Basz [3] originally
meant that the resting matter’s A is sent through the explosion-like
quality of the B toward the whispering world of the Sz and a watery
beginning.
Ar+any = arany (orig.: shine, now: gold) originally meant the shine,
the light of creation and its energy. Our Golden God is Life Universal,
present in creation and arriving on the wings of light. Bar-atya is the
Creative force present in the world, B+ar+anya (Baranya) is our
Mother Earth, the Woman clad in the Sun and the B+ár+ány
(bárány=lamb,) the golden fleeced lamb of ancient stories is our Sun.
Its name, bárány carries the names of the Ancient Parents, Bar-atya
and Bar-anya, energy and matter in perfect balance. Here too the
language and the process of creation forms an organic unit, as always.
We will see that the people of this particular B-R word group
expressed everything that is life-sustaining within this consonantal
group.
The reciprocals of creation’s B-R sounds frequently express the
concept of self-serving materiality: rab (prisoner), rabol (to rob).
The R-B word group also expresses the seeming reciprocal of Bar’s
energy, robbanás (explosion).
P — expresses a transitory state in the relationship of force and



matter and for this reason the birthplace of this sound is in the mid
section of our lips. The pára (vapor), por (dust), pír (flush), parány
(atom), pernye (cinder) belong to this category. The word pereg (to
rotate) expresses the rotation of the Earth. The Óperenciás Sea is
connected with the atmosphere, moisture and oceans, which rotate
with our Earth.
F — is the sound of energy, which turns even more toward the
material, and for this reason it appears as a sound formed at our
lower lips. It is the sound of rotation (forgás), which produces heat
(forró = hot) through material means, like with a drill (fúró). Among
its definitions it is also called a “blowing sound”. And truly, in life one
not only needs the drilling action to create a fire, but air and blowing
are necessary components too. The first sound of Föld (earth, globe)
is also the rotation’s F sound. The name of lady Firuna – collected by
Arnold Ipolyi, – is the name of the ancient matter, of the woman who
expresses herself in fire. We also need to remember, that blowing
(fúvás) serves as a drill too in a thinner material, as air, or water: it
creates a vacuum, a whirlpool as much as a drill does in wood.
V — deals with matters of the world and it is created with the help
of the lower lips. It is the base of a new creation, which gives birth to
flowers (virág) and the world (világ) and knows that in essence the
two are the same. The Mother of Flowers (Viráganyó) of our folk
stories and the Celtic queen (Virágó) are the product of a same line of
thought. The headdress of the Mother of Flowers is decorated with
pearls of dew; her hair ribbon is the red-white and green flutter of the
Northern Light.
The R when associated with another consonant becomes the creator of
the closed circle of matter and of worldly strength, as in vár
(fortress).



The reciprocal of V-R becomes the word of worldly endeavors, as
rovás (to carve). The word of being uplifted from the worldly realm
also belongs in this category: révülés, which is a word expressing a
contact with the highest centers of consciousness, and révbe ér, to
achieve one’s goal, to reach home. According to our language this
home is the world of light (világ).
This V-R wordgroup offers us the transition from the worldly world to
the world of light (virág=flower, világ = light and Universe).
G — It is the ancient sound of gentleness, of a baby’s first words,
the gurgling of a gentle brook, and the roll (görög) of the already
completed Universe’s most perfect form, the globe (gömb), arising
from the depth of our being. It brings the ancient memory of the
process of creation, as creation constantly rounds out the world and
everything therein. The reciprocal of the words gömb, gumó (sphere,
bulb), is our word mag (kernel). Our ancestors considered the Sun a
kernel, which transmits the light and warmth of the heavens (Ég) and
called it Mag-úr, Lord of the Mag. The worlds of the Universe are
round and the particles of the created world are round too. The
kernel’s round form is the beginning of our human life too and its tiny
globes adorn the life-thread of the DNA molecule also.
The fact that the Magyar name is embedded into creation’s
beginning mag state helps us recognize its antiquity, and her
language as the ancient language of creation. The word Magyar
means the offspring of the mag, a human. This name and concept
reverberates in the Scottish Mac or Mc, which similarly means a seed,
a son, a man.
The earliest archaeological layers in the Carpathian basin contain the
raised kernel (mag) form, which always signals a Magyar presence,
the mag-people of creation. Later centuries differentiate between



matriarchal and patriarchal societies. The patriarchal symbol is the
raised (positive) kernel form, the matriarchal symbol is its negative,
punched or carved appearance.
GY — is creation’s sound as expressed in matter. As the
boundlessness of the Universe reaches the state of matter, it attains
material properties and it becomes quantifiable. This fact is
expressed as the endless Ég (heaven, Universe, God), which becomes
EGY (one). Magúr’s child on this earth is the Magyar (lit.: human).
Our present national name bears the name of creation’s perfect shape
in its earthly form. Her aesthetic ideal was shaped according to this
realization and her role in creation is defined accordingly.
Light generated on this Earth is GYÚL (to ignite); its priest is the
GYULA who carries light-bundles in his arms as symbols of his
mission, which is to keep God’s light alive in creation, beginning with
the souls, down to the life-sustaining warmth of fire, and remind
people that all this has its beginning with God and is transmitted by
the Sun. This task was downgraded by cultures that borrowed some
aspects of this philosophy to the latter activity, as could be observed
for example by the activities of the Roman lictors.
Our word for angel (ANGYAL) also means a being of light. [4]
J — is a transitory sound between vowels and consonants. It is
related to the sound I which expresses smallness and cold and
frequently they substitute one another. It was this sound with which
we formed the word for goodness, God’s foremost quality, by adding
the most ancient sound, the Ó: JÓ. The Ó sound gives voice to the
amazement of creation as it first becomes conscious of creation’s
immensity and light. And in this instance it became aware of the fact,
that the one, who created all this, is good (JÓ).
JÉ is the sound of awakening to one or the other aspects of life on this



earth. JAJ is the sound of unenlightened matter, which was not
touched by light, and expresses the feeling of helplessness weather it
reacts to light or pain.
The cold expressed in the sound I continues in J and formed the word
group of JÉG (ice).
D — is a soft sound which originated before words were created,
and it is part of young children’s pre-speech vocabulary as they
express their joy of closeness of their mother’s body and milk. Magyar
words contain the concepts and joy filled sounds of gügyög = to coo,
dödörkél = to babble, didi = teat. Our songs (dal) start from this
environment on the wings of soul (lélek) and air (lég) as the songs of
our teachers (dalos Táltos = the singing Táltos) and the dalimadár
(nightingale). This first, soft sound is created by touching our upper
palate. The word dajka (wet-nurse) tells us that the created beings,
which arrived on Earth, were nursed by the light (dele and deleje) of
the Universe and its Creator and both are filled with song (dalos); he
is splendid (daliás), his tool in creation is song (dal) and creation
itself is God’s song (dal). In this ancient time Man still heard the
song of creation’s waves, so the song of light too. Dínom-dánom
(merrymaking, revel, reverie) expresses Man’s joy and enjoyment of
creation.
Déd means a great-great grand (mother or father) ancestor. The sexes
have not come into play on the material plain yet. Déd may be man,
or woman, it does not matter, what is important is that it is an
ancestor. Our ancient stories remember a time when the material was
only a latent part of structure of creation: they talk about a father
clearly recognizeable as Godhead - and three sons. The maternal
presence is represented through a fleeting image of the Great
Madonna – as Prof. Lajos Szántai reminds us.



When the D sound comes in contact with the J it gets very close to the
GY and it approaches the material world through this process.
C — its diminutive power was born at the beginning of word
formation and remains there on the lips of our babies: CCCCC. The
Magyar words of cuccan, cuppant imitate the satisfaction of babies as
they suckle on the breast (cici) or pacifier and for this reason it
became endeared to us, as Dénes Kiss, linguist and poet, reminds us.
It is an ancient sound and it remained part of the vocabulary of a
linguistic group that lived near waters and perceived our Earth as a
bubble floating on the waves of the Universe. Their watery world-view
is an organic part of the C-ish world (like cuppan, which describes the
sound of walking in mud) of their language. The word be-céz
indicates words of endearment, literally, its object becomes part of the
world of C. They perceived their world as beautiful and little: szép,
pici and the two are mirror images of one another. Their words were
the organic outcome of their language which became a language
within a language: pici=little, paci=word of endearment of a horse
(ló), poci=word of endearment of a baby’s belly and so on.
CS — gives a glimpse into the glittering, shiny world of stars
(csillog, csalló, csillag – glitter, sparkle, star) and of tiny particles.
The name of the first home of the Magyars on this Earth came from
this word-group: Csallóköz (Fényesköz), the land of shine and this
name was preserved to the present. The tiny chirps (csipetke
csicsergés, csipogás) of birds, the sound of water-drops (cseppek
csöppenése) come from this group’s vocabulary. We accompany
tickling (csiklandozás) with the sounds „csik-csik-csik” which are the
enlivening sounds of endearment. The word pici (little, tiny) can also
be substituted with the reciprocal csipet (a pinch), but in concept this
little (pici) something is the pinched part (csipet, csípett) of a whole.
The large extent of this word group points to its antiquity.



H — exhales the ancient warmth of creation: HHHHH — We still
warm our cold hands with this sound. The H radiates heat (hő) or
cold (hideg) but it always emits the essence of its environment. HA!
is the ancient expression of amazement. The H may stand in the
beginning, in the middle, or as a weak, sound of aspiration at the end
of a word.
The word has (belly) means our first, pre-birth house (ház) of flesh
(hús). The round houses of our becoming helped to form the word
kas (hive) in both word and object, as the workings of nature were
observed. This word became synonymous with abode in several
languages: casa in Latin, house in English and other variants in the
Indo-European languages, but they lack the organic connection of
their origin.
The monosyllabic words of H which were formed with the help of the
A of ancient matter express depth, and a watery surrounding
(hal=fish, hal=to sink, hab=foam).
Its hardened variant is the K sound. Until the H uses the more
etheric aspects, the knock (koccan) of the K touches the harder layers
of our world. The speakers of some Indo-European languages cannot
pronounce the mid-word H and substitute it with K.
K — it is the first sound following the meeting of Energy and hard
Matter. It is also the hard version of the soft G sound.. While the G
of the word Ég (God, heaven, burning) brings awareness of round
spheres which rest on the waves of creation’s energy, the K sound
reports the birth of light through an intermediary process of hard
matter: Ék (wedge). The sunbeam can be considered a wedge, which
is shiny (ékes) too. Instead of the endearing babble of G (gügyögés) it
is the sound of hard knocks (keményen koccan), the knock of stones
pounding against one another (koppanó kő). The two wedges (ék) of



the two K sounds of the cock (kakas) bring with them the first break
in the darkness of night, the first dawn, and help the energy to knock
against the ancient matter and thus to father energy, as our ancient
memories tell us through the structure of the Magyar language. This
birth of light holds true in the Universe just as much as here on the
earth, where the first fire is ignited with the help of the flint-stone
(kovakő). The crow of the cock signaled the birth of the God of
Light (Arany Isten), and the knocking of two stones against each
other gave birth to the first spark, which originated in the world
of matter.
M — it is the ancient sound which expresses the enjoyment of
matter and that of ownership and I am advising the reader to turn
to Dénes Kiss’ work on the subject. If we like a food very much, we
express our finger-licking enjoyment with the spontaneous mmmm
sound, independent of any language affiliation.
The mirror images of the objects of heaven were formed with the
addition of the M of materiality. Our God (Ég) expressed his essence
in this world in the kernel (mag). The Egyed (individual, literally: the
part of the One) attains here on earth the name Magyar through the
M sound. Further examples are cited in connection with the letter G.
N — is the sound of matter itself. It’s ancient forms are na, no,
nocsak which express interest, like “let’s see”. The sounds of the nő
(woman), and nő (to grow) carry the concept of matter (n) and
ancestor (ő), and both are the prerequisite of growth. The word NŐ
explains the material base of this new growth. Materiality
(anyagiság) always carries the concept of motherhood (anyaság).
The word nap (sun) knows about the material part of this
illuminating globe, as does its reciprocal too, which is fény (light).
Our ancestors knew the essence of light, its material structure, which
is a transverse wave, they knew about its spread in space and all this



knowledge again is an organic part of our language. Considering that
they knew about the Sun’s material part, they rightfully were able to
use it to symbolize femininity. As far as they also knew its properties
as energy, they rightfully could use it as a symbol of creation and
masculinity: in both cases their expressions reflected the true essence
of creation. The word napa contains the consonant n and the vowel a
both of which are the ancient sounds of materiality to express the
concept: mother-in-law. The words nana, nene, néni (aunty, dame,)
Anna and anya (mother) also belong to this word group.
The endlessness of heaven (Ég) gave way to a clearly defined place
(Menny-ország; menny=heaven) through the introduction of the two
consonants (M-N) dealing with matter. The earth dwellers began to
separate the different aspects of the Universe – according to the role
they play – into male and female concepts. The ancient words of
manó, manyó, meny, menyecske (man, old woman, daughter in law,
young woman) all attest to this.
The word monnó, according to Ipolyi’s research meant one in ancient
times. According to its sound structure the users considered the
Universe (mindenség) a material entity, but it was still an undivided
one. Ballagi’s research of contemporary language found that monno,
monnon means a unit (like both of us). This word signals the moment
when the world of force and matter began to separate in their
perceived role in the consciousness of people. The participants of this
change considered the Universe as something that can be owned,
which is mine (enyém).
The consciousness of people filled the eternally unchanged Universe
(ég) with the realization of creation’s constant change. The symbol of
change is the stallion (MÉN), its male and female creative power is
the MONY and the by now circumscribed land of heaven (menny) was
known to be egg (mony) shaped, our earth’s rotational path around



the sun also follows an oval pattern. According to the Magyar
language the earthly heaven (menny), our world, is the land, which
belongs into the gravitational field of the Sun.
As long as the symbol of change was the stallion (MÉN), the
helplessness of matter was expressed through its reciprocal NE and
NEM, the words of negation. Until the M works from the outside in,
the N exerts influence toward the outside. The first protest: Ne!
(don’t) and the personalized negation: Nem! belongs into this age.
The first only objects, the second one already takes a firm stand.
Interestingly the recognition of the differences in sexes (nem) belongs
in this category as does the idea of the union of male and female
(nász).
The watery world of our globe is clearly reflected in the words nedű
(liquid) and nád (reed). Nádszálkisasszony (the Princess of the Reed)
is one of the names of Mother Earth and it gives voice to this world
view. According to Finnish legends the earth came about when a
woman’s knee emerged from the ancient oceans. This legend – old as
it may be – does not know the connection of the concepts and
linguistic connection of the nő-nől-nedű-nád (woman-to grow-liquid
reed). The Bible’s creation story sees the spirit of God as moving
above the waters. The Magyar linguistic connection contains all these
old legends in an organic manner.
The sounds in the word nesz (noise) talks about the early memory of
the meeting of force and matter.
NY — expresses materiality as does the N, but frequently her
moist media: nyál, nyir, nyirok (saliva, birch tree, wet). The words
nyil (to open), nyel (to swallow) are the inclusionary words of
materiality. Nyár (summer) talks about the fecund season of our
world, when moistness and light enliven matter (which here is



expressed by the sound á). The word mother ((anya) expresses this
moistness, wetness of creation very correctly since the growing new
life she nurtures before birth is embraced by fluids just as much as our
earth is surrounded by the oceans.
S — The hushed ssss sound of mothers as they cradle their babes
brings us to our human beginnings. It is the sound of amniotic fluid
surrounding the developing baby as it is also the whispering (susogó)
sound of rushing waters, of windblown reeds and wheat fields, the
sizzling (surranás) of lightning, the hiss (sustorog) of the water-drop
when it meets the surface of a hot stone; the sliding sound of objects
all meet at this sound. The friction of ancient force and ancient matter
bore the word saj (shine) as it was preserved in an archaic poem,
which talks about a shiny (sajgó) lily which grew out of a rock
(„kőszálon sajgó (csillogó) liliomszál”) [5]. Its variant utilizing the
sound R is SÁR, also means shine, light, bright according to the
following expressions: sárarany (shiny gold), selyemsárhaju (silky
and shiny hair, in connection with Mother Earth).
SZ — It belongs into the large group of sibilants. The words szól
(to speak) and to scatter (szór) belong to this group. The organic
connection between to scatter and speak (szór and szól) tells us that
the ancestors – who were familiar with our beginnings – considered
the words to be seeds which are scattered through speaking.
The large SZ-L wordgroup concerns itself with “airy” qualities, such as
szél, száll, szellem, szól, szólás. etc. (wind, to fly, spirit, to speak,
speech), all prerequisites to transmitting words.
Z — Its onomatopoetic words bring the concept of low-frequency
sound waves closer to us, such as zeng = reverberates, zümmög =
buzz, hum. Sometimes it expresses the presence of disorganized
thoughts and actions and their mixed consequences: zúr hang =



sounds of confusion, zürböl = to slurp, zűr = difficulty, trouble,
hurly-burly. The rustle (zúg) of the wind, the sound of gurgling water
(zurbol) also belong in its domain.
ZS — It belongs into the world of sibilants. Its words frequently
bring a watery world into focus, like zsálya, zsegenye (a plant
growing in wet soil; a rivulet), or with cereal-like plants like zsázsa.
T — It is the harder relative of our D sound, and it is part of the
ancient sound system.
If repeated independently and in a fast sequence, it expresses fast and
repeated actions: TTTTTT. TA-TA means ancient father in our ancient
language as it is still repeated in children’s vocabulary. Tata is a city in
Hungary and one of its most ancient settlements; later it was the
foremost place of survival during the last Ice Age in Europe [6]. In
successor languages it is frequently substituted by its D variant but the
same meaning (DA-DA, etc.) TE (you) is the endearing word of close
friends and family). The word Tenő (Doer, Creator) was preserved in
this form in the Bécsi Kódex meaning God. Tenni (to do) talks about
creation, and Is-ten (God) means Ancient Doer, ancient Creator. The T
expresses the masculine concept in Creation and the name of Tas the
Sungod, preserved it over the centuries, where it became the name of
Tas, one of the founding Princes of 9th century Hungary. [7]
In the Sumerian language – as it is called today – tal-tal means a
song, which is dal in Magyar. If we consider the meaning of its
individual sounds, we find the L, which expresses waves, including
light and sound waves (deli / dal). The connection of light and sound
waves needs to be researched in our century, although quantum
physics already calls the Universe a very bright and noisy place. This
knowledge is already part of the language.
The T may be exchanged with C and Cs sounds as in the following



words: törtet-csörtet, tépál-cibál (to rush, to tear).
The word Taa (tova) = away is built upon the balance of ancient force
and ancient matter when it expresses motion.
As we examine the Magyar phonology we have to realize that the
origin of all sounds in our language lead to God. This is even more
startling in the ancient monosyllabic words where the concepts and
sounds of force and matter have not separated yet and where verb
and subject are expressed with the same sounds, the same words.
Mono-Consonantal Words
TC "Mono-Consonantal Words" \f C \l "2"
With the use of consonants that express motion, the world of vowels
and feelings holds hands with task-oriented intelligence, where not
only the vowels but all the consonants carry a definite meaning. The
mono-consonantal ancient words reflect a pre-creation status and
unity and in its most ancient strata the word is subject and predicate
simultaneously.
ÉG (sky, heaven, Universe, God). The sounds of this word cradle the
consciousness of spirit (É) and warmth (G) [8], which is distributed in
creation — a fact which our scientists have just begun to realize, but
the language born at the dawn of creation has already placed this
knowledge into her structure and focuses our attention on God. May
heaven/God bless you! Ég áldjon! This two-sound word, ÉG, is the
most ancient name of God which appeared on the lips of Man. ÉG, as
a verb informs us of the slow burning process which maintains life
and also the process of burning through fire.
ÉL — ÉLŐ (lit.: he lives) is the name of God and Life. The soul and
life multiplies itself. (Here the L sound serves as frequentative affix).
The word ÉL as a verb means the flow of life: to live. As a noun it



means the edge of something, like a blade of grass, a sword, or the
edge of a piece of furniture: it always deals with the meting-point of
two, or more surfaces. If the SZ sound of air movement is attached to
the ÉL we get the name of wind, Szél, and the name of Szél-úrfi, the
younger master of earthly life, which is the Sun. The ancients were
aware that the Sun is the creator of air-movements and winds and
through his word (szól) he scatters (szór) the seeds of life into the
world. Subsequent languages derived from this word group their
words for soul, the German Seele, the Bible’s as yet unexplained Sela
(which is the name of Szél) and the symbol of the harp playing Sol of
the Roman culture. All these names praise Master Szél’s name, his
words (szólás) as he scatters (szór) these word-seeds of life into the
Universe.
ÉL’s reciprocal form is Lé (liquid), which they knew as being the base
of all life on this earth.
ÉR — means a place of movement and also action. Water flows in the
rivulet (ér) until it reaches (ér) the river. The word intelligence
(értelem) is the vessel of the Universe, which forwards the messages
of the Universe (ég) to the brain (agy). According to an old saying,
“The knowledge is poured into his head by a funnel.” This Ér-telem is
the funnel.
ÉV —The word Év = year carries the beginning concepts of time and
space, as it is expressed with the lower labial V. As it already touches
matter, it is the beginning concept of a circle of time, a year. The word
Éva is the mother of time on this Earth, which is to be filled in order
to create. Évül expresses the changeability of matter, and later it gives
voice to the concept of getting old.
AD — ADÓ — to give and giver. The warmth of D and creation is
attached to matter, which had not yet been touched by light. The



giver’s Ó is part of ancient wonder and the instance of creation. As
giver it is a masculine concept and Adam’s name in the Bible is part of
this concept. (The Magyar ad means to give; its reciprocal do means
the same in Latin. The English verb to add belongs to this group too.)
AGG — It comes from the time of sleeping matter and the resting
ancient Mother. It means an old woman or person and attaches age to
things expressed in matter. Its verbal form agg [9] means to worry, a
material and earthly concept. („ Ne aggj már” [10]).
AGY — means brain and its resting cells await the enlivening strength
and shine of thought.
Óg — is the dome of ancient shine and warmth. Its variant (with v)
means protection from harm (ó, óv).
PA — expels air from the depth of a person’s body, in an almost
explosive manner: pa-pa... It was this sound with which the Father of
Creation breathed life into Creation and later these sounds became
synonymous with fatherhood all over the world. Our words carried
on the wings of our breath become part of creation.
“ A lélekzés szárnyán világba szálló szólásaink a teremtés részeivé
válnak”. This one tightly knit word group tells us the following: Our
sayings are carried on the wings of breath into the world and become
an integral part of creation. Every word that was ever uttered has
power to create, or to destroy according to our intentions. Our
ancestors were aware of this fact and used words sparingly, while they
bathed their lives in uplifting songs.
I have to emphasize the „M” sound of ancient ownership and pleasure
which is summarized in the word MAMA in the most complex manner,
the N, NY sounds of matter, and the GY which expresses its ideals in
matter while it carries the spirit and warmth of creation; in the word



gyúl it ignites light from matter. The universality of creation (EGY
ség) becomes four (N+EGY = NÉGY) with the addition of the
material sound of N thus recognizing the four basic forces of creation
(the strong, the weak, magnetism and gravity). This concept is not
only part of the language but it is present in the earliest symbology
too.
Our symbols, which appear in the world of matter, are the direct
descendants of consciousness — sounds — words. Energy and
matter are essentially the same and can be transformed into one
another. Úr — Űr (Lord and Vacuum), to give and to receive. The
ancient Sun-cap of the Magyars when worn on the head was the
masculine symbol of creation, when held in hand with its open side up
it became the symbol of the all-inclusive materiality, motherhood.
The low vowels imply possibility; the high vowels mean the
realization of something, according to the role of vowels that were
touched by light. Thus their substance was quickened, enlightened, in
the case of the ancient words with one vowel and one consonant.
E — ell (process of birthing)
É — él (it lives)
A — al, — ag (base, — old, another form of agg)
Á — áll (to stand). Here the enlightened matter is set into motion
with the help of creation’s light and spirit. It is connected with the
word ág (branch) and ég (Universe) since the Stag (Ágas) carries
worlds and suns on its antlers. The word Ád (to give) connects the Á
of the enlivened matter with the soft D which carries warmth. It is
connected in the most natural way to the Christmas circle, which
originally celebrated the sequence of the first creation.



O — Ok, means cause and it is the name of God who stands behind
all creation. Its reciprocal is the knock of motion – set forth by this
First Cause – against the hard matter of kő (stone) and the fire
bringing flint-stone (kova). The two consonantal kor (aetas) marks
the beginning of the birth of time when our world was rounded out
into a round (kerek) whole. I define time the following way, as I
perceive it through the phonetics of our language: THE ACTION OF
FORCE UPON MATTER AND THE CHANGES IT CREATES THEREIN
ARE MEASURED WITH TIME.
Half understood fragments of the K-R group’s concept of time gave
rise to the Greek legend concerning Kronos (kor=aetas), who was
born on Mt. Ida (idő=time) and who devoured all his children. The
borrowing Greeks and the Indo-European communities were not clear
about the true meaning of the legend and took the story verbatim,
thus making a monster of Kronos, the father of time. They had no idea
that the children of Kronos (aetas) are the days and years, which are
devoured by the passing of time (idő), by the ages (kor).
Ó — óg means the dome of Heaven, and it is connected with light.
Antiquity’s Ó forms a bridge toward the uni-consonantal words like
the word óv (to protect). The ancient form remained intact in its past
tense, which is ótt (megótta=he protected him, or it), and in its
imperative, which is ódd (protect!). The word óv is regularly used in
supplications to God. In connection with the Ó’s antiquity it tells us
that in ancient times (ó-idő) God protected (óvott) us and does
protect us (óv) even today. The Magyar version is the following: Ó
Isten ó-ja ó-időktől népünket. (Ancient God protect our people from
ancient times on.)
The two consonantal, reciprocal form of óg is góg, a variant of góc,
meaning center, gist. Originally “it was a place where they used to
start a fire, an oven; a spot, where the rays of the emitting source



converge.” [11] It was the center of light. The mythical saga of our
origin – which talks about Góg – meant people who lived in the
center of light. In the language of children gogó means walnut, the
round form of the heavenly bodies. The walnut in Christmas tradition
is the symbol of light.
The word gógatás means the call of the rooster, which, as we have
already seen marks the beginning of creation. [12] Here we also
realize that the rooster was at the center of light ( góg) and spread it
too (gógat).
Ö — ör, is the sound and word to signal the continuity of the world of
consciousness, and gains expression in the material world by the word
örök (eternal). When a second consonant places it into the world of
matter, it gives our word kör (circle), kor (aetas) which also signals
the presence of time.
Ő — ős, őr means ancestor, guardian. Ő is God’s first name and the
ÉG (sky, Universe, God) was formed also from this monosyllabic
language. The God of Creation, who acted within the realm of matter,
is Life, and his name is formed in the closed circle of matter’s two
consonantal words. He is called the God of Creation, the Son of God,
The Younger Master of Creation, the Happy God, the Loving God
(Teremtő Isten, Fiú Isten, Boldog Isten, Szerelmetes Isten) and
innumerable other loving expressions.
Our material symbols are inseparable from the sound-symbols,
and both mirror the immediate environment of the person who
created them.
The hard K sound was first observed when two stones collided and
later in the process of tool making, when the stone was split and
several wedges ensued as a result. Since the pieces assumed a wedge
form, they became useful wedges (ék), plows (eke) and their shape



formed the letter K of the Székely-Magyar rovás (runic writing). The
multiplicity of wedges thus attained lent itself to the use of the sound
K to express plurality. The organic connection between man’s action
(kő-fejtés = quarrying), the accompanying sound (K) — symbol (ék
= wedge) — tool (eke= plow) and the language is probably
nowhere as obvious as in the case of the sound K. These organic
connections compel us to rely upon the Magyar linguistic base
when researching linguistic connections.
The above example, for instance, explains why one cannot agree with
the present explanation of the word eke (plow) which officially is
derived from the Slavic languages. The above organic connection
follows through the objects of our archaeology. The beginning of
agriculture in the Carpathian Basin, with the use of wedges (ék) and
plows (eke) made from branches and antlers (ág and agancs), preceded
the use of similar objects in Anatolia and in the West by several thousand
years.)
Truth is always truth. We may know only a small segment of one of its
manifestations, but all layers are transfused with the same truth
content “from the highest heaven to the world of atoms”. [13] This
truth base may be misinterpreted by foreigners of later ages, but it can
be rediscovered. For example:
The word ék (wedge) refers also to the shape of the sun’s rays and so
this same word ék stands also for shiny, ornate (ékes) and jewel
(ékszer). So when our ancestors used their plow (eke), they knew that
the Lord of Shine, Ék-Úr also uses his plow of shine (ékes eke), which
are the rays of the sun without which the seeds would not come to
life. This arany-eke (plow of light, the golden plow) was
misunderstood by writers, centuries later (in this case Herodotos) who
believed that this “golden plow” was made of the shiny metal which
fell from heaven to the land of the Scythians. He did not know that



the golden plow of our ancestors was the sunlight.
Ancient Monosyllabic Nature-Words Formed With Two Consonants
TC "Ancient Monosyllabic Nature-Words Formed With Two
Consonants" \f C \l "1"
The one vowel and one consonantal words, which were created from
the ancient sound elements produce a closed circle of materiality by
adding a second consonant. This closed state is characteristic of the
material world and it means strength in our three-dimensional world,
protection derived through the addition of matter.
The words and forms always mirror the environment of their
formation:
G — Ég — mag — Magor — (heaven — seed — Lord of the seed)
begins with the warm tones of roundness and rolling. Our first
consciousness brought the world’s and the seed’s (mag) round shape
into focus and these shapes still envelope us today. It is this mag
shape we find in the most ancient archaeological layers of the
Carpathian Basin, either in its positive or negative aspect, depending
on whether the community was a matriarchal or patriarchal
organization. The regions consisted of round hills, quiet brooks, and
round fruit trees completing this idyllic picture. In related cultures this
decoration is also present from the Etruscans on to the Sarmatians, to
mention only two of the European related cultures.
K — Ék (wedge; jewel; shiny) reflects the “wedges” of a world filled
with mountains, the round mag (seed) turns here into makk (acorn)
as the G changes into K, Magor (Lord of the Seed) into its reciprocal
and hardened form Kan (male), or Kam, both phallic symbols. The
Miracle Stag of the Magyars, Ágas, becomes here Ákos, Ékes, who
carries the Universe as glittering, hard jewels (ék) upon his antlers.



The first known true house in the Carpathian Basin at Lúdvár sported
the wedge shape as decoration in the structure of its roof in the image
of a dog-, or wolf-head. As light is reflected from matter, the first
colors appear, which our language remembers as blue (KÉK); out of
this word Dénes Kiss created the language’s fairy castle.
R — This sound always produces a closed circle or unit, a stronghold
and circular motion. The two-consonantal variation of ör (circle) is
kör (circle). The Körös (Circle) linguistic group gave the name of the
Körös region at the dawn of history, which remained the same until
today in their geographical names, like the Kőrös river.
Sz — szem (eye, eye shaped seed) This word remembers the whispers
of wheat fields and its symbol is already present in the Carpathians
from the Stone Age on into the Copper Age and today. [14]
Energy, Matter, and Reciprocity
TC "Energy, Matter, and Reciprocity" \f C \l "1"
Energy is focused, it points toward the sky, it stands erect, it
creates.
Matter receives, enfolds, nurtures and remembers.
The monosyllabic, two-consonantal words are excellent opportunities
to express the connection between force and matter. Our ancestors
knew that the force that is activated in energy and matter is
essentially the same and for this reason energy and matter can change
into one another. The ancient people expressed this seeming
contradiction with the law of reciprocity of words. Reciprocity was
used for other purposes too and we discuss them later. Adorján
Magyar mentioned that this language is so perfect it cannot be the
product of the human mind but it was created by Eternal Nature like
snowflakes and crystals: „...again and again we have to realize, we
have to ascertain that the Magyar language is the most wonderful



expression of Nature, the realities of nature, its mirror image
imprinted into sounds which fact will give a base to much future
research.” [15]
At the time of the birth of our language we heard God’s voice in every
sound, and later in the order of growing words and sentences and this
helped us to remember the miracle of our first beginning and the road
leading back to it. God’s thoughts were poured into words and they
hide – by necessity – the order of creation within the unit of cause
and effect, which cannot be dissolved. This order exists only to a
limited extent in other languages, and often in a mixed state of
understanding. It is for this reason imperative that, when we study the
languages of the world, we do it by starting out from the Magyar base
and understanding. We always have to know the cause (ok) of things,
we have to use causal knowledge (be okos = smart) in our actions.
We also know from our language that God was honored also by the
name of OK (cause), the truly okos (intelligent, knowing the cause)
person is a person of God (AMT, OK), and he is able to look into the
heavens any time through God. All he has to do is to step out in front
of his door. [16] In other words: The truly intelligent person (Okos )
lives with the cause (Okos) and is a child of God (Ok).
The Relationship of Force and Matter
TC "The Relationship of Force and Matter" \f C \l "1"
In the Magyar language, force manifests itself through words that
describe creation, movement and direction. Matter is place bound; it
envelops, nurtures and remembers. It also follows the workings of
force as sensitively as a ribbon fluttering in the breeze.
Ancient knowledge also tells us through the language that this
principle operates in the Universe and it is also an organic part of our
bodies. The semen of the male principle – like the consonants of our



language – are the creators of change and motion through their work
exerted in creation. The female egg grows the future from her resting
point. This ancient principle was present in creation before the birth
of the individual and, as one enters materiality by choosing one role
or the other, the individual’s mission, direction and quality in this life
are determined. This law cannot be transgressed without
consequences and without harming creation, which surrounds us. If
we doubt this statement we only have to look at the life forms, which
surround us. What would happen, if the ovum did not accept the life
fluids which are there to help it fulfill its mission, or if it erased the
DNA memories which determine the goal of this mission. The miracle
of creation is repeated within our bodies. Today we know that our
cells are not isolated according to function and their role is
determined by their location at the beginning of organic functions.
This process is similar to the fact that our male or female being
determines our goal, and flow of our lives.
What would happen if the Sun did not send energy to the earth and if
the earth did not accept the life giving strength of the sun?
The ancient law of force and matter, which is operational through
energy, is an organic part of our language. This language tells us our
connections with creation. The individuals, who came later, the Táltos
[17], were conscious of all this. They were able to hear the songs of
creation and the waves of life without instruments; they were able to
notice when disharmony crept into this song; they saw the workings
of cells and the paths of light within the body. The rediscovery of this
ancient knowledge is bound to machines in our age but, even so, their
use of this ancient knowledge will be a huge step in the welfare of
people and a blessing.

Organic Magyar Linguistics, part 2.b
The Concepts and Words of Masculinity and Femininity
Are Mirror Images
TC "The Concepts and Words of Masculinity and Femininity" \f C \l "1"
Pál — a masculine concept and it is the name of the Palóc language
group’s creator, their word for light. His symbol is the pole.
lap — (a flat surface) It is a feminine word, related to concepts of
fluttering, enfolding, material medium. (lebeg=to flutter, levegő=air,
lepke=butterfly)
lép, lepény — (spleen, honeycomb; flat-cake) is a feminine concept
as it nurtures life.
The union of male and female carries life and our flags are symbols of
this: the pole is the symbol of masculinity, the flat cloth, fluttering in the
wind is the symbol of femininity. The former is the symbol of the rays of
the sun, the latter is the symbol of the air. Male and female. New life.
(The English words pole, and flat, to flutter belong into this
wordgroup along with their reciprocal life, love, lip, lobe, liver – just
to mention a few.)
Bak — (buck) Masculinity rises toward the sky.
kupa — (cup) It is a receiving vessel, feminine symbol. The force of
the Universe fills its emptiness. It is a part of statues holding a kupa
on ancient graves, some still standing in Hungary.
kapu — (door) It is a feminine symbol. She frames the rising sun in
Székely-Magyar villages even today, as Stonehenge framed the sun in



ancient times.
rúd — (rod) Expresses masculinity, as above.
tűr — (to enfold) Materiality turns within itself signaling her capacity
to create spheres, globes.
pis — (to piss) It is a forceful ejection of liquids
fos — (to excrete) As above, except the liquid comes from the lower
centers. (Both pis and fos belong today into the “bad word” category.)
visz — (to carry)
sziv — (to suck) the reciprocal of ejection, a feminine concept.
szop — (to suckle) as above
Pairs of Constancy and Change
TC "Pairs of Constancy and Change" \f C \l "1"
Mag — The seed fulfills its God given role in one place, it grows new
life; it remembers its life experiences and transmits it to the offsprings.
kan — The male kan, kun, hun serves creation by widening the circle
of its territory, like the rays of Sun nurture the slumbering life in the
seeds. It is for this reason that cultures on the move were carried by
the kan, kun, hun principle. The ancient stories of the little kanász
(swine herd) who climbed the Tree which grows to Heaven (Világ
Égigérő Fája) is not so much about his occupation, but the fact that he
carries in his name this principle of forging ahead, as does its other
form, the kondás. The structure of the swine’s head is wedge shaped
and belongs into the same symbolic group.
This story clearly talks about the concept of relativity and space travel.



Interestingly where this Magyar story ends, the origin saga of the
Osage Indians begins.
Szem — (eye) brings to mind the shape of our eye and the form of
cereal grains. Whereas the round kernel has one focal point, the
szem’s elongated form has two geometrical foci. The Szem society’s
rapid spread was not only caused by the quick growth in numbers, but
their entire world outlook rested upon this bi-focal destination. One of
the two foci remained in their homeland, the other became part of any
other territory. This could have been close or very distant, but the
people within the two-focal culture always remained in organic unity
with one another. The wanderings to and fro between the two
remained constant unless some major catastrophe prevented them
from carrying on this process. One such formation of the Szem people
was the establishment of the culture in the Fertile Crescent and the
fluctuation of the two societies between that land and the Carpathian
Basin. The last returning group of that society was the people of
Prince Árpád in the 9th century. His name is well documented from
the earlier centuries in the Bible among other sources. Their
vocabulary contains the following:
mező – meadow
méz – honey (the honey-bee was the symbol of their six-based
worldview)
medve – bear (lover of honey, its head carries the roundness of the
sun, its nose the cone shape of sunrays, its brown coat the burnt color
of fire.)
mezgél, mezgérel, mezgerél — to look for something, as the ears of
wheat on the fields after harvest.
messze — It is a typically Szem concept, means distance.



más — (other) This word becomes aware of the differences in foreign
lands.

Ancient Monosyllabic Words and Word Groups
TC "Ancient Monosyllabic Words and Word Groups" \f C \l "1"
Our mono-consonantal words bring back the age of creation. The bi
consonantal words show our consciousness as it settled in the
material world. We experience matter “hands on” in our three
dimensional environment. It is. Its further life follows creation’s
pattern of constant change and creation.
The circle (kör) is a line, which returns to its own beginnings and
encloses space in the process. In the material world the circle becomes
a hoop, it is capable of circular motions (kerengeni, kerülgetni) on
the solid surface of the earth just as much as it can rotate around the
sun within the framework of the Universe. The Earth’s rotation around
the sun gives birth to time, its unit is expressed with the concept of
kor (aetas)
Man begins to play with thoughts, concepts, language and objects.
The meaning of the ancient sounds never went into oblivion and



objects and happenings were always expressed with the knowledge of
the meaning of sounds, which always help form a unified, organic
culture. This process is still ongoing as we listen to the voice of
ancient consciousness. Ancient monosyllabic words were the definitions
of the individual ancient sounds.
These monosyllabic words, expressed with consonants that are
connected, formed word groups. These word groups are the mirror
images of cultures, which became separated due to environmental
factors. During linguistic research these monosyllabic words and their
word groups cannot be separated from their organic and spiritual
content. If we insist on doing this, the result will be malformed,
unable to grow and will remain finite. I call these ancient,
monosyllabic, bi-consonantal words ancient nature-words
henceforth. [18]
In later evolutionary processes – by evolution I mean here the greater
familiarity with the environment and the concomitant change of
language – the forthcoming cultural words were a natural outgrowth
of the nature-words. The cultural words consisted of – by necessity
several syllables and sounds. If we cannot find in the vocabulary of a
culture the basic nature-word to support the cultural word, then this
culture word is the product of another language and culture.
I mentioned earlier that the first environment of the M-G group’s
round word remembers a soft, hilly region. This is also the first,
universal memory of mankind. Babies’ ga-ga world reminds us of that
and even as grownups people like to play with round, spherical
objects, no matter where they were born. Mankind’s language consists
of many more sounds but this warm G and its world remained a
favorite. Considering that the word for a round kernel is mag, and the
Universe consists of such magos (round) forms, as the planets, this
word became synonymous with the idea of big, high and exalted



(magas, magos) and we find it in this context in vocabularies of
related cultures: Latin magnus, Sanskrit and Sumerian mahar).
The Mag society’s life is the mirror of the life of the mag (seed): it
remains in one place and builds its future there. Man remains here as
seed („Megmarad magnak”), raises his child (magzat) here too. He
becomes conscious of self here and creates the word for self also from
mag: maga. At the same time he is conscious that he and his fellow
human beings are essentially the same and his respectful address
toward them is maga. The Mag person also knows that he has to work
out his life by himself, alone and his word for alone-ness is magány.
As representatives of this culture became uprooted occasionally, they
carried the mag concept with them. It is for this reason, for example,
that we find the Scottish Mac, Mc words (seed, son) as related
concepts, with the same meaning as part of this ancient culture. In the
Welsh language this word became the name of the symbolic little
round mussels on the seashore. [19]
The man of the Mag culture recognizes the limits of its earth-bound
state. With the word magas (high) he sees his environment in context
of the sky and frequently equates the concept of the heavens with this
word: „Ha itt e földön nem, találkozni fogunk ott a magasban.” (“If
not on this Earth, we’ll meet up there high...”). He expresses today
(ma) the not yet fulfilled future (még), while he peacefully awaits it
from this word group (mig).
He knows himself as the mirror image of God (Mag Úr) and as the
man of the seed (mag) and he knows himself as Magyar according to
his role in creation.
His language is Magyar also and his own essence remains in the quiet
teachings he undertakes: magyaráz (explains).
In social connections he is rather a loner (magának való), his



motions are measured: megy (he walks). He searches heavens (ég)
and truth (igazság) , he explains (magyaráz). Justice (igazság) to
him is based on truth (igazság), they are synonymous.
His religious vocabulary contains the following: Ég, Ige, Igaz,
(God, Word of God, Truth), and their earthly equivalents: Egy, egyed,
egyház, (one, individual, church). He also counts among these
everything that sustains his life on this earth: mag, megye, magos,
megyer, meggy, magyaró (seed, earth, high, religious symbol, cherry,
hazelnut, etc.).
In his thinking he uses the word meg when he wants to focus on
something, clarify ideas (lát, –meglát; ad, –megad — to see, / ponder,
to give / to donate, or give back), and adds up (egy meg egy az kettő
— one plus one is two).
The M-G (Magyar) word group
TC "The M-G (Magyar) word group" \f C \l "1"
Ancient nature words:
Ég = God
ég = sky
ég = to burn
ig = light
ige = Word of God
igen = yes
Concepts that attained their form during the birth of matter and
their first level derivatives:



Egy = God
egy = one (matter is needed to develop numerical concepts)
egyed = individual, lit.: a part of God
egyén = individual
egyház = church
egység = unit
egyezkedés = to come to agreement
egyhangu = unison
Ancient nature sounds as expressed within matter:
mag = kernel
maga = you (respectful form)
magzat = seed, child
magas = high
magyaró = hazelnut
megy = to walk
megye = earth
meggy = cherry
Reciprocals:
gumó = bulb



gam — támasz = support
gomba = mushroom
First level derivatives, and the beginnings of culture-words.
Magor, Magúr— a nap = Lord of the Seed — the sun
magyar — ember = human
magyarán — nyiltan = openly
magyaráz = to explain
magasztal = to praise
mágicsál (felhalmoz, több darabból álló holmit egymásra rak, hogy
följebb emelkedjék.) [20] = to built something out of particles
máglya = bonfire
megyer = staff, as religious symbol
Reciprocal forms:
gömb = globe
gomb = button
gambács = an earthenware vessel with an opening on top and a
nipple on its handle.
gamó = a staff with a round knob on its end.
gamócs = a hook
According to changed environments our vocabulary became larger



too. The ancient M-G word group remained, sometimes with changed
meaning, but still recognizable. Changed environments placed greater
emphasis on the other groups’ vocabulary. The soft G turned into hard
K, the kernel (mag) became acorn and poppy (makk and mák),
Magor became Makar. In the new homeland when thinking back to
the old environment this word became synonymous with happiness in
the new land: the Greek makaros means happy, Makaria the land of
happiness. The unity of consciousness and language here is still intact.
The life circle of the K sound and its affiliation with the stone (kő) is
the following, according to Adorján Magyar’s explanations:
KŐ — Ancient Nature Sound (Stone)
TC "KŐ — Ancient Nature Sound (Stone)" \f C \l "1"
I. First derivatives
a. KOVA, KOHA (flint stone)
Finnish: kova = kemény (Hung.) (hard. The Finnish language created
its own word for hardness and stone from the Magyar word for flint
[kova], but the basic word kő is missing.
Finnish: kive = kő (stone)
b. KEMÉNY (hard)
c. KOPOGNI, KOCCANNI (to knock and to knock against something).
Italian: percutere = ütni (to hammer)
coccare = koccanni (to knock to something)
Slavic: kucati = kopogni (to knock)
cs. KOHASZTANI, KOVASZTANI, KÖVESZTENI (to cook with the help



of hot stones.)
Italian: cocere = to cook
German: kochen
Slavic: kuhati
English: to cook
II. Second derivatives
ad. a. KOVÁCS, vagy KOVÁS (smith, or the one who has a flint)
Slavic: kovac = kovács (smith)
kovati = kovácsolni (to forge)
Italian: coniare = kovácsolni (to forge)
ad.b
Slavic: kamen = kő. (The Slavic language created its word for stone
from the Magyar word expressing hardness = kemény.)
Slavic: kremen = kovakő (flintstone)
ad. cs. KONYHA (kitchen)
Italian: cuccina = konyha
German: Kűche = konyha
Slavic: kuhinja = konyha
Italian: cuoco = cook
German: Koch = cook



Slavic: kuhar = cook. I am adding to Mr. Magyar’s list the following:
English: to cook
cook
kitchen
The base of all these words, the ancient KŐ (stone) and its Magyar
derivatives are missing completely, or exist in a misused form in the
Indo-European and other successive languages. Nevertheless they
express their culture words connected with cooking, hardness with the
KŐ nature-word as their base.
After this one example – and there are thousands of similar examples
– I am introducing Adorján Magyar’s ancient ethnic groups to be able
to discuss further aspects of the ancient forms of the Magyar
language. These ancient ethnic groups derived their uniqueness first
of all in the realm of consciousness, then in language. Their names
express this fact and they were born in a time when mankind was not
separated yet into countries and nations. One must not equate these
names with much later nations, which are known under similar
names, even though these nations, too, had contact with these ancient
linguistic groups, but of course mingled with other ethnic groups
which were already displaced from their original unifying
consciousness, and linguistic unity through their historical role. Such
changes, torn from the original culture produced over thousands of
years the groups of culture and language, which I call successor
cultures. This process continues from the wanderings of the most
ancient times even to the present. The once uni-lingual mankind’s
language and symbols are to a large extent preserved by the
indigenous population of America who most likely lived here before
the break up of the continents. However, the ancient language’s purest
form remained at the place of her birth, in the Carpathian Basin.



Grover S. Krantz also holds that smaller communities formed the
ancient language of mankind. He postulates twelve such pre
Mesolithic groups. Adorján Magyar proves the existence of sixteen
such ancient groups through the language. All sixteen groups were
part of the ancient Magyar consciousness, culture and the M-G basic
word group but they also used their own particular symbols,
consonants that expressed their unique place in the world and its
connections with God and life. All of them were the bearer of God’s
word. Their song resembles a harp with sixteen strings; each of the
strings carries a sound of our language and each string is the symbolic
sound of a particular ethnic group’s language.
These ancient language groups all had their origin in their
consciousness of God. Without explanation I am citing some of the
names of the Great God (always mono-consonantal), the Son of God
(Light and Life – always bi-consonantal), the Great Madonna (Mother
of the Universe – mono consonantal), and Little Madonna (Earth – bi
consonantal) at the end of every word group in the above order:
1. Magyar G, GY, H - M, N reflect the round world. The basic symbol
is the mag (kernel). They considered the Sun a mag from which life
grows.
Ég, Egy, Ág-ata, AG (Heaven, One, Father of the Tree, Old)
Mag, Magor, Magyar (names of the Son of God)
Ana, Egina (names of the Great Madonna)
Ilona, Helona, Hilma, Hilona (names of the Little Madonna, mother
Earth.)
2. Kun, hun K, T –N. Their world is full of edges, their language
hardens and becomes the reciprocal of the M-G group. Symbol: the ék



(sharp edge). Their role may be compared to the rays of the Sun.
Ok, Ük (the name of the Great God)
Kún, Kün, Hunor, Kám, Him, Tana (the name of the Son of God)
Isz, Is (the Great Madonna)
Temise (The little Madonna, Mother Earth)
3. Black Kun. They too lived in the world of the kő base-word and
their symbol is the blunt edge. This edge is man-made.
4. Szemere SZ, S Z, C, CS - M, N world is that of grain cereals,
abundance, honey sweet environment (gabonás, szemes, mézes and
édes) and they were the first to conquer distances as part of their
extended consciousness.
Ur (Great God’s name)
Szem, Szám, Szamota, Szamos, Samas, Szamszon, Szandon,
Szander (The names of the Son of God)
En, Ené, Ana, Emő., Eme, Ama (Great Madonna)
Szem, Zem, Zemele, Szemere, Szemere-nő, Szemele, Tamara, Mesz,
Med, Mizse, Mizera, Szamonya, Szenora, Szemerama (Little
Madonna, Mother Earth)
5. Besenyő B, P, V, V - S, SZ lived near waters. Their consciousness
carried the beauty (szép), and tender language (becéző) of their world
washed by gentle waves. Their ancient symbol was the drop of water
(csepp) and this is the basic element of their later art, which contain
the life forms of the once existing sea in the Carpathians, which they
still cherish. According to their symbology our globe is a bubble on top



of the sea of the Universe. The newest findings of quantum physics tell
us the same story concerning the structure of the Universe. The
following lines are again the names of the Great God, the Son of God,
the Great Madonna of the Universe and the Little Madonna, who is
Mother Earth.)
Isz, Is, Ős
Beszer, Beszeraba, Bisúr, Péter, Petúr, Patar
Sssz, Oz-anya, An, Am, Iszonya, Bözön, Buzun, Buzonya was their
Black Madonna (representative of outer space).
Visz, Bisz, Besenyő, Vizenyő, Vizanya (all these mean a watery
environment, mother Earth’s watery representation.)
6. Jász S, SZ, Z, ZS, C, CS - J At the base of their language is Jó
(good) God, the glowing Sun (izzó), and symbolic flower, the jasmin.
Asz, Ős, Jó
Ős, Asz, Jó
Jász, Jiz
Jó
Jolán, Júlány
7. Székely Sz-K They cradled the consciousness of the life giving
szikecske (life within the seed) which grows out of the rocks (szikla)
in their ancient land (szék). Their places of worship followed this
edgy, mountainous world. Their later cultures re-created this
environment of worship in the ziggurats of the Fertile Crescent and
step pyramids of Egypt. Their symbol was the zig-zag line. Their



symbolic flower was the szekfű (carnation).
Ék-Úr
Szikúr, Székúr
Szikán
Gizella
8. Kazár K-Z They were among the first sheep herders in the
Carpathian basin. Their symbol was the arms of developing nebulae
and also the ram’s horn (kos): these left their mark on the earliest
vessels of the Paleolithic in the Carpathian Basin. [21]
Ős, Ise
Kos
9. Kabar K, H, G, GY-B, P, F, V . This group herded goats and their
basic symbol was the form of the scrotum of the billy-goat (bak) and
the line of their horns, which are clearly represented in the ancient
layers of the Békásmegyer [22] vessels in the exact time when the
goats first appeared in that land. The same symbols were present in
the decorations of Scythians, Huns and on the objects of Árpád’s
group, returning from Etelköz in the 9th century. It is also a favorite
building element of the Eastern churches, which they now call
“onion”-shaped domes, but in reality this form goes back to the
ancient goat herders.

10. Török T, D-R,L This group’s consciousness centered on eternity
and the concept of return and they expressed these in both language
and symbolism. Great God’s name in their vocabulary was Ur (lord),
Uruk and Ürük, Örök, which all carried the concept of eternity. Their
Great Madonna was Urán, Uranna, Uranya, Mother Earth was,
mother of returns Turan, or Mother Tur (Tur-anya). Her name and
role is still misunderstood by historians and linguists alike, but even so
they bring this name in contact with Magyar related groups. The King
Arthur legend of the English- speaking world is this group’s cultural
product. [23] In my opinion when Byzantine historians refer to the
language of the Turks it is this group and not the Turkish nation of the
historical age to which they refer. Their symbol was the bull ( turka),
and the lines of its horns. Their symbolic flower was the tulip, which
embodies the same symbolic lines. The name, the population and
symbolism of the Trojans are derivatives of this T-R based culture.
Ur, Őr, Ur-opa, Ad, Ős-úr, - later Örök, Öreg, Urakán
Tur, Tor, Tör, Tur-uk, Tör-ük, Turuk, Toldi
Urania, Éda, Éga, Ada, Édua
Turán, Tezán, Terenna
11. Körös K, H, G, GY - R, L Their symbol was the reflection of the
three-dimensional sphere, which is the two dimensional circle (kör).
The meaning of their ethnic name means the same. They preserved
the memory of the birth of time in the word kor (aetas) and the
freedom of motion within the turns and loops made of a straight line.
Their ancient home was in the region of the Körös rivers in the
Carpathian Basin and they were the name givers of the geographical
names of the region. Their round (kör) gardens (kert), their round



churches are still within reach. Their holy holiday was Karácsony
(Christmas), which, in their culture celebrated the birth of the
Universe and the Mother of Ages, Korasszony. In Western Hungary
there is an ancient Christmas custom of giving flight to the kerecsen
(a type of falcon), whose circular (köröző) flight pattern brings to
memory the time, when at the dawn of times the newborn life was
entrusted onto his wings. Their ancient designs which have survived
to the present, consist of loops of all kinds, each of which carries a
meaning. Because of their beauty they were adapted into the uniforms
of many nations (French, English), who took the uniforms of the
Hussars as an example.

12. Avar B, P, F, V - R This word group gives voice to the vocabulary
of the already settled mankind and to creation as it appears on this
earth. Their symbol is the pattern of the path of transverse light
waves: the cross. This was their symbol since the beginning of
creation. Their sounds clearly mark the connection between heaven
and earth, which they bring to our awareness through their use:
matters of heaven and creation are expressed through the sound B,
which we form with our upper lips. The P sound is formed in the mid
line of our lips and it expressed thoughts and concepts of transition.
The F sound helps us express energy as it turns more and more
toward the earth and matter. The V is concerned about new life
growing out of this earth which already bears the seeds of a new
creation. With the addition of the R they express either energy in
action, or material strongholds (vár = castle), depending on the



beginning consonant’s meaning. Creation’s Great Madonna was
Baranya, mother Earth was Virona, or Viráganyó (mother of
flowers). The fire burning in Mother Earth’s bosom was represented
by Firuna. All these names are still living in the part of Hungary,
which was originally their Avar homeland. Their ring-shaped
strongholds are part of the Magyar landscape. They were the
gardeners of the region.

13. Palóc B, F, P, V - L This word group is the ethereal variant of the
Avar group’s vocabulary. They expressed the connection of force and
matter with the position of their consonants and reciprocity. The flow
and sequence of creation becomes very clear following the message of
the structure of their language. Their symbol was the staff
representing energy, which is still in every male’s hand in their
homeland and the forked branches of the tree expressing femininity.

14. Pannon B, P, F, V-N This group used the lens shape as the symbol
of the Sun thus expressing its sunlight scattering property; they too
engaged in migratory routes but remained in organic unity with the



homeland. They were the earliest maritime people, the Venets and the
Phoenicians. Their ancient consciousness carried the light of creation
(fény) and its materialized form, the sun (nap), which are linguistic
mirror images of one another. Whereas the Magyar symbol of the
shine of the Universe was the Stag (Ágas) and its “branches”, the
Pannon symbol, was the fir tree (fenyő), tree of shine (fény). Even
though today’s Hungarian ethnographers hold that the Christmas tree
is a late-comer in Hungary, the language tells us of a deeper content
and earlier origin.
Ő, Apa
Nap, Napata, Ban, Bán, Fény, Főnük

Panna, Panona, Vanna, Venussza and I consider the Celtic Epona in
this category.
15. Szarmata S, Sz, Z, Zs, C, Cs - L, R This word group cradles the
concepts of spirit and meekness. Their symbol for light was the dragon
(sárkány = shiny male). In historical times the tattoo of a Scythian
warrior shows the North Star and its constellation as coming out of
the dragon’s mouth. [24] The related Sarmatians carried this
philosophy and dragon on their banners all over Europe. [25] Another
light symbol was the rose, which they planted around their
strongholds as part of a natural defense.

16. Marmar M, N - R, L This word group chose the mellow (mellő,
máló) sweetness of the earth as their representative concept. While
the Besenyő group chose bubbles of water while describing our Earth
as swimming on the sea of the sky, the Marmar chose the small
bubbles of the round raspberry (málna) to hold on to the same image
and their one-ness with the spherical world of the Magyar mother
culture. The unified consciousness of all these groups means the road
back to the ancient consciousness of their origin.
The reciprocal of this sweet and mellow world came about during
their later, earthly life and words of fierceness (mord, marcona) and
its reciprocals: scary (rém), trembling (remeg). In Indo-European
languages the concepts of death are expressed within this word group,
like the Latin mors. The founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus came
from this word group’s culture, as did the Celtic Mac Morna. The
concepts of sinking (merül), of depth (mélység) belong in this
vocabulary. The symbol of death was the deep, silent world of a fish
called márna (barbel). Geographical regions that are connected with
this culture are the Marmar Sea and the Mármaros region of
Transylvania.
Mar, Marah, Mart, Moloh [26]
Márna, Morena, Marana
Out of these ancient ethnic cultures the languages of the world
developed. The question is not, if this, that or another language is
related to the Magyar, but: Which of these ethnic vocabularies are
represented in a certain language and to what extent? Researching
the Celtic language I found – beside the Magyar – the Szemere, Jász,
Kun, Török and Avar groups as the most representative. Without going
into detail, for curiosity’s sake, I would like to mention that the Jász
and Kun groups reside side by side in the Carpathian Basin and the



same two groups are side by side on the island of Iona. According to
Adorján Magyar, the culture, which today we call Sumerian, was
established by the ancient Szemere and Török groups, also the Avar,
Kabar and Székely. All these connections can be easily assembled with
the help of computers, but one has to keep the philosophy of the
language as we have seen in this paper, the unity of the word groups
intact along with meticulously watching the nature word / cultural
word concept’s integrity when trying to establish the direction of
transmittance.
The Magyar language is the mirror in which all peoples can
recognize their own higher self and reestablish their ancient
consciousness. In this way the idea of the brotherhood of men
will not be a lofty and empty idea, but tangible truth.
***
Some Closing Thoughts...
TC "Some Closing Thoughts" \f C \l "1"
The language’s treasure chamber – which must not be forgotten – is
filled with ancient sayings, and their origin leads us into uncharted
antiquity.
One Magyar saying for example is “Ezt megúsztuk” (we swam
through this one), which is used to express our satisfaction that we
made it out of a difficult situation. Dénes Kiss, in his works, mentions
that it must have been an awfully big body of water which we swam
through once and believes this saying leads us back to an immense
ancient flood, which became indelibly imprinted in our collective
memories. In my studies, I found linguistic evidence of existing
cultures in the Carpathian Basin, at the time when the Pannon Sea
was formed and when the inland sea of the Great Plains still existed.
Stories go back also to the time when this sea receded, thus language



— stories — geographical happenings form an organic unit. [27]
Recently I translated a letter written in the late 19th century by a
simple lady from the old country. The translation was requested by
her great grandchildren who don’t speak the Magyar language. This
letter was written by a mother to her daughter. During translation I
became acutely aware of the words of endearment she used to address
her daughter: my golden child (aranyom), my soul (lelkem), my star
(csillagom). These ancient pictures are natural part of the language,
but appear to be affected in the English translation. In the Magyar
language these images bring back the Golden Age, which only we
know through our language was the time of Light, the birth of light in
which we were present as beings of light and came to this earth with
stardust under our feet. Aranyom, lelkem, csillagom! (My golden
child, my Soul, my Star) expressions recreate the Golden Age through
the preserving attribute of mothers and mother language.
At the end of this letter, stood the following admonishment: Live with
a clean soul. Behind this reminder stands our ancient belief system,
symbolized by the mirror of conscience, which was part of the Magyar
thought and life from antiquity to our present. With its help we are
able to care for our souls, and keep them intact. In our materialistic
culture not even the idea of this task comes up.
Finally I would like us to remind ourselves of the following:
When I say that the Magyar language is the language of creation,
since it gives information about forces that shaped creation, then the
conclusion must follow: our Magyar language is the ancestral
language, the mother-tongue of Mankind. And if it is the ancient
language of mankind, no matter how flattering it may seem to trace
the Magyar origins to any of the ancient cultures – Sumerian,
Egyptian, Maya, etc. –, we did not originate from any of these, not



from the Urals, or Meotis, or any other place our present historians
and linguists like to place our cradle.
Our origin is with God.
An old Magyar saying, which comes at the end of every children’s
story states: If you don’t believe this, then look into it yourself.
But in order to look into the statements in this paper, it is not enough
to sit among dictionaries. One has to know the presently still living
ancient Magyar prayers, songs, art, dances, mode of thinking and the
unique characteristics of the language. It is necessary not only to read
about them but also to live them. Then and only then can one make a
comprehensive decision in the question of origins.
I have presented the reader with a mass of strange-looking and
sounding words which I have tried to explain to the best of my ability.
What I could not transmit is the gentle spirit of these words and their
connection with one another, which is part of the living language.
When considering this, one comes to the realization that Creation
lives within us, with all of us. As we gather the words, concepts to
complete the now fragmented picture of each consonantal group, we
can recreate not only the ancient language of mankind but become
one with the ancient consciousness which created it.
Until then let us walk with a clean soul on our God given paths and let
us be lights, stars, helping spirits to one another in this world. And let
us teach our children to think and speak the Magyar language,
because with this we place an invaluable treasure into their hands.
