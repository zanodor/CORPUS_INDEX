Archaeologist unearths Noah in stars Utahn finding picture story of flood,ark in ancient constellations
The ancient story of a great flood -- first recorded in writing
around 1700 B.C. -- may actually have originated around 5,000
B.C. because it appears as a "picture story" in the stars,
according to new evidence pieced together by a local
astronomer-archaeologist.
Known to Christians and Jews as the story of Noah and the
ark, the story of a deluge so complete that it wiped out all life
except for those aboard a boat that was built under direction
from God, is recorded in 11 ancient texts, including the Bible,
the Torah and the Koran.Utah archaeologist John McHugh
says though there is "no archaeological, paleontological or
geological evidence" for such a catastrophic flood, "ancient
cosmologists verified it" by "viewing it as a picture story in the
constellations."
The notion of "proving" such a story to be true through
astronomy seems "crazy to us, because we use science and
history" to explain modern events, including weather-related
phenomena, McHugh said.
Yet ancient cultures that had yet to develop such methods
routinely viewed the heavens as a pictorial reflection of
"events believed to have occurred on earth in ancient times."
The way McHugh has pieced his theory together begins with
his belief that the first known record of the flood story -
penned in 1700 B.C. by the Babylonians -- was formed in part
by using constellations that derived from the religious texts of
the pre-Babylonian Sumerians.



If, in fact, the flood story were based on such a picture story in
the stars, "then all of the major themes and elements should
correspond to constellations," including "the flood waters, a
flood hero, a boat and a benevolent deity."
Reading cosmological, astrological and astronomical texts
from Mesopotamia, McHugh found writings regarding a "wet
region" of the southern night sky known as the Apsu,
translated as a "flood wave" or "terrible inundation."
His reasoning extended that a constellation of a flood ship
should also be positioned within the stellar floodwaters, which
he also found a description of.
Known as the Magur, the ship constellation -- now referred to
as Argo -- was "based on the crescent-shaped, cargo vessel"
that was commonly used on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in
Mesopotamia in ancient times. "Every second millennium B.C.
version of the flood hero endures the flood waters in a Magur,"
he said, noting the description in one Middle Babylonian
(1600-1000 B.C.) flood account says the "big boat" was built
"entirely of reeds . . . let it be a huge Magur with the name, The
Life Saver."
The "benevolent deity" mentioned in all the flood accounts
warns a righteous man of the impending flood, urging him to
build a boat to preserve mankind. In pre-biblical accounts, the
god is known as Ea, or Enki in Sumerian. Cosmological texts
describe how this god is "lord of the Apsu," and ancient star
atlases state that Ea is the water-god constellation, renamed
Aquarius by later cultures. In early flood accounts, this is the
god who warns the flood hero of the deluge, McHugh said.
While he found writings about the Magur and Ea
constellations in several early texts, McHugh said only one -
The Epic of Gilgamesh from the 7th century B.C. -- provided
enough clues to help him understand "which constellation



was the flood hero." Tablet XI of that epic speaks of "the only
mortals to have attained everlasting life" -- the Assyrian Noah,
known as Ut-napishtim, and his wife.
It also records that while Ut-napishtim "was mortal," he and
his wife shall now "be as we gods are," dwelling "far off at the
mouth of the rivers." For the picture story to be complete,
McHugh said he found the flood hero by looking for a Tigris
Euphrates constellation that flowed into the stellar waters of
the Apsu and found the river constellation Eridanus.
That's important, he said "because Eridanus leads from the
foot of the most conspicuous constellation in the stellar sky"
- the constellation Orion.
Because Orion was a "man constellation" in both
Mesopotamia and the Near Eastern cultures, the reference to
the flood hero "dwelling far off at the mouth of the rivers" may
be a literal one, McHugh said. "Ancient cosmologists probably
perceived this flood hero constellation as 'evidence' that he
had survived the catastrophic flood in ancient times."
While all of the evidence from the earliest texts fits nicely
together, McHugh said by around 700 B.C., the precession of
equinoxes in the night sky had moved the stellar boat Magur
(Argo) about halfway below the southern horizon when viewed
from the Assyrian capital at Nineveh. This "sinking" of the
traditional stellar flood ship coincided with the time the
Assyrian flood story in the Epic of Gilgamesh was written.
Because McHugh's theory rests on the continued visibility of
the central "pieces" of the flood story in the stars, he looked
for -- and found -- evidence that the old ship constellation was
replaced in Gilgamesh and later texts with another
constellation positioned in the sky's "wet region." Six
constellations were contained within that area, one of them a
square "field" within the floodwaters.



That description meshes with the Gilgamesh account of
Noah's construction of the "flood boat," which says "a field
was her perimeter, ten poles (60 meters) each the height of
her walls."
McHugh said since Mesopotamian agricultural fields were
measured in square units of 60 meters per side, "it can be
inferred that the new flood boat was shaped like a cube."
Though the ancients knew such a vessel would not be
seaworthy, McHugh believes that to maintain the integrity of
the stellar flood story, "cosmographers were forced to replace
the original flood ship constellation with another that could be
seen sailing in the stellar floodwaters of the Apsu.
"This seems to explain why, beginning with the 7th century
B.C. Assyrian flood story, each subsequent flood boat is
quadrangular in shape. . . . By replacing the original flood ship
constellation with the field Iku, Assyrian cosmologists had
created the original 'ark,' . . . which insured that the flood boat
would be perennially seen sailing in the flood waters."
Today, the stars that make up the flood boat are known as the
Pegasus Rectangle asterism, McHugh said. "The ark is this
huge, really long rectangle in the Bible -- at least 180 cubits, or
about 330 yards."
A Catholic who recently graduated with a master's degree in
archaeology from Brigham Young University, McHugh said
religious scholars in particular are interested in his work
because his timing of the earliest versions of the flood story
could place it as far back as 5000 B.C.
"My research suggests that the flood story could have
appeared much earlier than the advent of writing. If you're a
religious person, you want to hear that."



Though he has his personal religious beliefs, McHugh is
careful to say he doesn't know whether the flood described in
all the ancients texts was a historic event or a tale
perpetuated through the ages in the night sky.
"I'm not saying that picture story isn't based on real event, but
in my theory the flood just can't have the magnitude that a lot
of modern-day creationists assign to it. Today, the
constellations are thought of as fairy tale kind of stories -- but
not to the ancient cultures. If you can prove the story
happened in the stars, to them that's how it happened."
While McHugh spends most of his days now looking through
the dirt as an archaeologist for Orem-based Baseline Data
Inc., his theories about the stars are grabbing a lot of national
attention.
Last month, National Public Radio aired a program explaining
his "picture story" flood theory, followed by a piece done by
the science editor for ABC's "Good Morning America." A flurry
of e-mail has been racing around the Internet as a result of the
publicity, and McHugh said he's now considering an offer to
put his work forward for a national publishing house. A
scholar in Hawaii also wants to do a documentary on his
theory.
First presented at the Society of Biblical Literature in 1998,
McHugh's theory seems to intrigue scientists, astronomers
and religious scholars alike with a new take on the story some
view as myth and others accept as divine.
McHugh said whether his work will have any lasting impact is
as much a mystery as many of his scholarly suspicions were
before he pieced them together.
"I've been rejected a bunch of times, not information-wise, but
because of the picture story in the stars. Who knows where it
will go from here?"
