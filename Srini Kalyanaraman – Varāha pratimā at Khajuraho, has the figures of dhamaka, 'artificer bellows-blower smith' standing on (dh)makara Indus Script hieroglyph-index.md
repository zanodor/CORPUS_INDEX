--Narasimha and Śrī K ̥rṣṇa avatāra are also shown on Varāha pratimā at Khajuraho, as persons with four arms Thus, the Varāha pratimā is a veneration of Vaikuṇṭha ṣṇ in three avatāra and veneration of artisans and seafaring merchants

Description: In a creation myth, Vishnu took the form of a boar to rescue Bhuvedi, the Earth goddess from the depths of the primordial waters. In this sculpture, Bhudevi stands to the right of the boar’s head, while a serpentgoddess (nagini) appears in front. Rows of sages, deities and other figures appear on the body of the cosmic boar. The prominent conch shell, discus and mace below are all symbols of Vishnu.

Vaikuntha Vishnu. Date: last quarter of the 8th century; Culture: India (Jammu & Kashmir, ancient kingdom of Kashmir); Medium: Stone; Dimensions:
34.7 x 43.3 cm | 13.7 x 17.1 inches | This complex form of Vishnu, first referred to by the name Vaikuntha in the seventh-century Vishnudharmottarapurana, is four-faced (chaturmurti), with the heads of a lion (right) and a boar (left) flanking a human head. He is also identifiable in this form by the epithet Para-Vasudeva,  ́the highest god. ́ The lion and boar represent Vishnu ́s Varaha and Narasimha avatars. Carved in low relief on the back of the halo is the fourth face, a demonic, grimacing representation with fangs and a vertical third eye on the forehead. The small attendant on Vishnu ́s left is Chakrapurusha, the personification of his war discus, originally balanced on his right by Gadadevi, the female personification of his battle mace. The earth goddess Prithvi, stands

between Vishnu ́s legs. from the eighth through the tenth century, this fourfaced Vishnu was the paramount cult icon in the kingdom of Kashmir. https://www.alamy.com/stock-image-vaikuntha-vishnu-date-last-quarter-ofthe-8th-century-culture-india-168161501.html He has a human head, a lion head, a boar head and a fierce head. Another theory based on Pancharatra texts relates the four heads to the Chaturvyuha: Vāsudeva (Krishna), Saṃkarṣaṇa (Balarama), Pradyumn a and Aniruddha – four vyuhas (manifestations) of Vishnu. The Lakshmana Temple of Khajuraho suggests his worship in the Chandela kingdom (Central India) in the 10th century. This is the reason why Narasimha appears on Khajuraho Varāha pratimā.
