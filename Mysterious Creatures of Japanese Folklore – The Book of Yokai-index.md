Water Goblin Tales
PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Long ago, there was a kappa. A water goblin. It was about
two inches tall, green, made of some sort of durable
ceramic material, and it sat atop the small refrigerator in
my studio apartment in California. It was just an
inexpensive charm from a shrine that somebody must have
given to me when I lived in Japan for the first time. Or
perhaps I bought it myself. Either way, I had never actually
given it much thought. But then one day, I was opening the
refrigerator to get a beer and, for some reason, the kappa
caught my attention. I began to inspect it carefully, turning
it over in my hands. What was a kappa anyway? I knew that
it was a little monster from Japanese folklore, a nasty,
threatening creature that pulled people and animals into
the water. But that didn’t really explain anything. The little
goblin was inviting me on a quest to explore an otherworld
of fantastic beings and to try to understand how this
otherworld might also be part of our own world.



I was in graduate school at the time, in Asian studies,
and I ended up writing my master’s thesis about kappa. I
wasn’t able to answer all the questions the creature raised,
but I did learn that in Japan such water creatures fit into a
larger category called yōkai, and the world of yōkai offers
insight into the world of humans. Yōkai are an age-old part
of belief and, simultaneously, at the cutting edge of
knowledge and contemporary expression. In 1929, the
physicist and writer Terada Torahiko (1878–1935)
explained that the desire to understand yōkai is at the core
of innovation because it inspires investigation within all
sorts of fields. And this investigation never ends: the
moment a mystery is solved, yōkai assume different shapes,
evolving right alongside humans and inspiring us to keep
asking questions.1
The creature on my refrigerator guided me into the
otherworld of yōkai, and I have been exploring it ever
since. I went on to write a doctoral dissertation on yōkai,
and in 2009 I published a book called Pandemonium and
Parade: Japanese Monsters and the Culture of Yōkai, which
is a cultural history of discourses of the weird and
mysterious over the last four hundred years.
The Book of Yōkai is a very different endeavor. Although
it builds on what I learned while working on Pandemonium
and Parade and in the years since its publication, the
present book focuses more explicitly on yōkai as forms of
folkloric expression and communication that are
simultaneously part of long-standing historical traditions



and also very much alive and changing today. It also travels
further back, into the earliest known texts in Japanese
history, exploring a range of ideas and discussing some key
individuals, from Abe no Seimei to Lafcadio Hearn, who
contributed in different ways to shaping understandings of
the supernatural world. The Book of Yōkai also introduces
many of the yōkai themselves—some already famous
beyond Japanese shores, and others almost unknown
outside the small villages in which their legends developed.
Yōkai are part of folklore and popular culture in Japan, of
course, but in recent years they have also started to garner
attention elsewhere, including North America and Europe.
In large part because of manga, anime, gaming, and the
global influence of Japan’s “soft power,” more and more
people have heard of yōkai and are interested in their
folkloric roots. Although The Book of Yōkai does not focus
explicitly on contemporary popular culture and media, I
hope it will be useful to people engaged in these
dimensions, as well as to anybody interested more
generally in questions of belief, the monstrous, and the
uncanny.
I wrote The Book of Yōkai while living in two very
different locations in Japan: the city of Kyoto and the island
of Shimo-Koshikijima in Kagoshima Prefecture. Kyoto, of
course, is a historic capital and was a center of elite power
and cultural production for much of Japanese history. In
contrast, the island of Shimo-Koshikijima, with fewer than
three thousand people, is far removed from the historical



seats of power and, for that matter, from many of the
amenities of urban life today. Yet both these places are
entirely fitting locations to contemplate yōkai, because
yōkai are equally at home in the metropolitan centers of the
nation and in its rural peripheries. And in both places, my
thinking about this project benefited immensely from
conversations with friends and colleagues and teachers
though, of course, responsibility for any mistakes is entirely
my own.
Kyoto is the home of the International Research Center
for Japanese Studies (Nichibunken), a research facility that
houses one of the largest collections of material on yōkai in
the world; the current director, Komatsu Kazuhiko, has
been the leading academic researcher on yōkai for the last
several decades. I finished drafting this book while in
residence there in 2013 and was fortunate to have access
to all these resources, as well as to the wisdom of Komatsu
sensei and the members of his various kenkyūkai (research
workshops). My profound gratitude goes to Komatsu-sensei
and to Professor Yamada Shōji, who sponsored me while I
was there as a visiting research scholar. I am also indebted
to Nakano Yōhei, Tokunaga Seiko, and the other denizens
of the “yōkai project room,” to Egami Toshinori and the
Nichibunken library staff, and to Hayashi Hiroko,
Nishiyama Akemi, No Sung-hwan, Ted Mack, and Kasumi
Yamashita for many hours of excellent company and
conversation.



For the first half of 2012, I lived on Shimo-Koshikijima, in
the village of Teuchi, in order to research a ritual that I
have written about elsewhere. But while on the island, I
also began writing this book. A few of the local yōkai made
it into the pages that follow; but more important, the
experience of living in a small rural community gave me a
deeper understanding of the kind of village lifestyle that
was, and still is, characteristic of many parts of Japan. My
friends on the island, many of whom I have known for over
a decade, helped me understand viscerally the intimate
connection of people with place, and the living relationship
between history and the present. I am indebted to too many
people to name them individually, but I am especially
grateful to Hironiwa Yoshitatsu and Hironiwa Yasuko for
many hours of insightful conversation and exquisite food
(and imo-jōchū). My deep appreciation also goes to my
good friend Ozaki Takakazu and his family; to Shirasaki
Hiroki, Shirasaki Sugako, Kawabata Tsuyoshi, Kawabata
Yoriko, Hironiwa Hirokazu, Hironiwa Masako, Megurida
Toshifumi, Megurida Chiriko, Hashiguchi Yoshitami,
Hashiguchi Kyoko, Hironiwa Mamoru, Hironiwa Eiko, and
their families; and to the fishermen of Aose.
Reed Malcolm, editor at the University of California
Press, originally suggested this book—I am grateful to him
and Stacy Eisenstark for their support throughout the
project. My great thanks also goes to Chalon Emmons for
her clear editorial guidance and to Bonita Hurd for her
impeccable and perceptive copyediting. I also thank



Makiura Yoshitaka for patiently assisting me with relevant
aspects of copyright. Jon Kay and Hannah Davis of
Traditional Arts Indiana graciously worked with me on last
minute technical issues as I prepared images, and Suzy
Cincone provided careful (and bilingual) proofreading.
Throughout this project it has been an honor to work with
Shinonome Kijin, the illustrator who drew the original
images in this book; he is not only a brilliant artist but also
a true scholar of yōkai.
I am indebted to the Fulbright Foundation, which
generously funded me in 2012 as the writing began to take
shape; I particularly thank Jinko Brinkman and the other
members of the JUSEC staff for their constant, good
natured support. I am profoundly grateful to my colleagues
in the Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology and the
Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at
Indiana University, as well as to my graduate students
there, for allowing me to escape campus duties for long
enough to do a little yōkai hunting. In the United States
and Japan, many people have supported my work, both
intellectually and through pleasant distractions. There is no
space to thank them all by name, but I would like to
mention Ariga Takashi, Christopher Bolton, Dylar Kumax,
Paul Manning, Steve Stuempfle, Denise Stuempfle, Suga
Yutaka, Tsukahara Shinji, and the members of the
Shingetsukai Research Society.
My deep gratitude also goes to my family. Adam Foster,
Ann Ayton, Suzuki Tatsuo, Suzuki Yumi, and Suzuki



Ken’ichirō were all remarkably patient and supportive
throughout the research and writing process. My father,
Jerry Foster, passed away in July 2014, while I was doing
the final editing of the manuscript. Although he did not live
to hold the finished book in his hands, for me every page is
infused with his memory. His intellectual curiosity,
encyclopedic knowledge, and extraordinary capacity to
appreciate facts and ideas will always inspire me.
Finally, I am infinitely grateful to Michiko Suzuki, who
has kept my work, and my life, centered. She has read all
my drafts with crystalline perception and constantly
challenged me to write more clearly and think more deeply.
Without her, nothing would make sense.



Names, Dates, Places
A NOTE ON JAPANESE NAMES AND TERMS
Throughout this book, Japanese proper names are noted in
Japanese order, with family name first. Where appropriate,
I follow the Japanese convention of referring to certain
writers, scholars, and artists by their pseudonyms or given
names. For example, Toriyama Sekien is called Sekien
rather than Toriyama. Japanese words and place-names
that appear in standard English-language dictionaries are
written in Roman script with no macrons (e.g., Tokyo,
Shinto); other Japanese words are written with macrons to
indicate long vowels. Japanese words used frequently
throughout the text are italicized only in their first
appearance.

PART I
Yōkai Culture



1
Introducing Yōkai
About fifteen years ago, I lived for a time in a small coastal
village in rural Japan, where I was researching a local
festival. I rented a rickety old wooden house literally a
stone’s throw from the ocean. Until a few months earlier, a
family had lived there, and a lot of their belongings were
still in the house: old furniture, pots and pans, kitchen
utensils, drawers overflowing with clothes. A single
Japanese-style room with worn tatami flooring served as my
living room and became my bedroom when I unfolded my
futon at night. There was a television in one corner and a
Buddhist altar in another, and high on the wall was a row of
framed black-and-white portraits of men and women
looking down at me with severe expressions. These were
the ancestors of the family who owned the house.
I’m not sure why the family had left. I rented the house
from a distant relative of the owners, a kind old woman
who lived nearby and saw that I was comfortable during my
stay. And for the most part I was. I would fall asleep to the



endless singsong of the waves. A few times, in the middle
of the night, I awoke to rustling sounds in my tiny kitchen:
a stray cat had snuck in through a hole in the floor and was
rummaging around for scraps of food. And once or twice,
when a storm blew in from the ocean, I could hear waves
crashing on the beach with an eerie and purposeful
violence. The wind would shriek through the outer walls of
the house and rattle the flimsy shoji doors inside.
But once, something really strange happened. I had been
out late, drinking with friends and discussing the festival.
When I got home around midnight, I diligently wrote up the
day’s events in my field notes and then laid out my futon. I
promptly fell into a deep sleep.
When I opened my eyes, the room was glowing faintly.
The framed photos of the ancestors glinted. It was dawn,
that deep, quiet time of transition from darkness to light,
from night to day. I wondered why I had woken up so
suddenly and so early. Perhaps the cat had snuck into my
kitchen again.
But then I heard voices—a woman, speaking quietly but
with authority, and a man responding. I sat up wide awake
now and looked around.
The voices were coming from the television. I watched
the end of a weather report and the beginning of the
morning news. There was nothing particularly scary about
this until I started to wonder why the television was on in
the first place. The remote control was on a table, a few
feet from my futon, so it is unlikely I had turned it on



accidentally while sleeping. Had I left it on the previous
night? Perhaps I had been drunker than I thought, but I
had no recollection of watching TV. Could there have been
a weird electrical surge? Was something like that possible?
Or perhaps it was a sign, some kind of message. Maybe
somebody was trying to tell me something. I watched the
news carefully, but could not figure out what message was
being conveyed to me, other than the fact that the world
was in its usual turmoil.
Eventually, I turned the television off and went back to
sleep for another hour or two. Later that day, I mentioned
the experience to several of my friends in the village. They
had no explanation.
YŌKAI, FOLKLORE, AND THIS BOOK
I begin with this inconclusive story, a mundane modern
mystery, because it raises the simple question of how we
interpret our world. In particular, how do we explain
occurrences that don’t easily fit our everyday
understandings of the way things work? When we ask who
or what turned on the television, we are intimating that
there is a living being or animated force interacting with us
even though we cannot see it. We may visualize this force
as a monster or a spirit or a ghost or a shape-shifting
animal. In Japan such a force, and the form it takes, is often
called a yōkai.



And yōkai, notoriously, take many different forms. They
are commonly associated with folklore, and with small
villages or old cities or deserted mountain passes, but they
have also long populated literature and visual imagery.
Today they are found throughout Japanese anime, manga,
video games, movies, and role-playing games. Particularly
in these latter formats, they have crossed oceans and
continents to become part of popular culture in countries
far from Japan. So what is a yōkai? For now, let us just say
that a yōkai is a weird or mysterious creature, a monster or
fantastic being, a spirit or a sprite. As this book will show,
however, yōkai are ultimately more complicated and more
interesting than these simple characterizations suggest.
Yōkai may emerge from questions such as who turned on
the television when nobody was around, but from there
they take us on a kaleidoscopic journey through history and
culture.
About This Book
One common characteristic of yōkai is their liminality, or
“in-betweenness.” They are creatures of the borderlands,
living on the edge of town, or in the mountains between
villages, or in the eddies of a river running between two
rice fields. They often appear at twilight, that gray time
when the familiar seems strange and faces become
indistinguishable. They haunt bridges and tunnels,
entranceways and thresholds. They lurk at crossroads.



It is appropriate that this book about yōkai also fits
somewhere in between. While it is based on years of
academic research and fieldwork, it is not intended only for
scholars of Japan or experts on supernatural folklore. I
hope it will contribute to their discussions, of course; but
more important, I hope anybody with even a passing
curiosity about these subjects will find it of interest. I have
tried to present my ideas as clearly as possible, with little
technical language; at the same time, I have strived to do
justice to the depth and complexity of the topic.
The book, then, occupies a space between the academic
and the popular, a position, in fact, similar to that of many
books written about yōkai, and other subjects, in Japan.
While Japan has a long tradition of publishing highly
academic monographs with small print runs, many
scholarly books—particularly about popular subjects such
as yōkai—are also published by commercial presses and
available at bookstores throughout the country. A diverse,
well-educated public regularly consumes serious works on
history, archaeology, folklore, media, literature, religion,
and even philosophy.
This book is also situated at a crossroads between
cultures. One objective is to introduce Japanese yōkai and
Japanese scholarship on the subject to an English-language
readership. In the West over the last several decades, the
monstrous has increasingly become a subject of scholarly
and popular fascination.1 While much of the writing on
these topics is insightful, rarely is there any mention of



Japanese monsters. But as will become apparent in the
pages that follow, in Japan the study of the monstrous—of
yōkai—has long been a vibrant field. Like much other work
within the humanities, yōkai research in Japanese simply
has not been translated into English. This book is by no
means a translation, but it is informed by rich Japanese
research on the topic, which I hope to make accessible to
people studying the monsters of other cultures. At the same
time, I give all this my own particular interpretation and
analysis, adding my voice to the conversation on these
subjects.
Serious research on yōkai in English and other languages
may be limited, but yōkai themselves are becoming more
and more familiar to people in countries outside of Japan.
Part and parcel of Japan’s so-called soft power, these
strange creatures have started to invade the rest of the
world. For many of my students in the United States, for
example, the terms yōkai and Japanese folklore are
practically synonymous; they have encountered kappa or
kitsune or tengu in manga and anime, films and video
games, usually in English translation. This exposure
inspires them to delve further into folklore, to find the
“origins” of the yōkai of popular culture that they have
come to love. And that is another purpose of this book, to
provide some folkloric grounding for yōkai they might
encounter. Although it is often impossible to trace the roots
of particular creatures, I can offer a sense of the diverse



influences and complex cultural histories that breathe life
into them.
It will become clear, I think, that there has always been a
great deal of interaction between yōkai in folklore,
literature, art, manga, and so on, and it is meaningless to
draw sharp distinctions between these forms of
communication. But for the most part, I leave analysis of
the most contemporary popular-culture appearances of
yōkai to readers—who are probably more familiar with
these versions than I am. I also do not explicitly treat
Western-born manifestations of yōkai, such as English
language manga and fan fiction. My own research has
focused on yōkai as they are expressed in Japan; I hope
those with interests located elsewhere will build on what I
present here or use it for comparative purposes.
With all this in mind, I have divided the text into two
parts. Part 1, “Yōkai Culture,” provides a cultural history of
yōkai folklore and yōkai studies and explores some of the
concepts that inform how yōkai and humans interact. Part
2, “Yōkai Codex,” is a bestiary, a compendium of various
yōkai, that helps illustrate many of the concepts discussed
in part 1. These two parts are really interdependent—yōkai
discussed in part 2 appear in part 1, and texts mentioned in
part 1 show up in part 2. Getting the full picture may
require flipping back and forth.
“Yōkai Culture” is divided into three chapters, each with
several sections. Because there is a lot of information in
each of these chapters, the sections are short and each one



includes a number of subheadings. The current chapter
presents key concepts related to yōkai and their study. I
explain a little about folklore in general and then trace the
words that historically have been used for yōkai. Finally, I
explore some of the ways we can define yōkai and think
about how they come into existence.
Chapter 2, “Shape-Shifting History,” introduces the big
names—both people and texts—through which we know
about yōkai today. The simple premise of this chapter is
that yōkai would not exist without the human beings who
told of them, studied them, wrote about them, and in some
cases tried to subdue them. Yōkai have played an important
role, often in the shadows, as Japan developed from one
period to the next. This chapter is divided into four
sections, each dealing with a particular historical era.
Chapter 3, “Yōkai Practice/Yōkai Theory,” has two
sections. The first provides a brief journey through what I
call the “yōkai culture network”—a web of people who are
closely involved with the production of yōkai knowledge
today. And the final section suggests further approaches to
understanding yōkai in the abstract and to exploring their
meanings within a larger global context.
Part 2, “Yōkai Codex,” is designed like a small
encyclopedia. One way people have commonly dealt with
yōkai is by labeling, organizing, and classifying them.
Perhaps this is because yōkai are so varied and plentiful:
maybe the only way to really define them is by listing
examples. So this part is a bestiary with information about



selected yōkai: the list is long but really only scratches the
surface, because, as I argue throughout the book, yōkai are
diverse and abundant and always changing or being
reborn. In the codex, I have tried to include all the best
known creatures, as well as a smattering of more obscure
ones, but inevitably many have been left out. This bestiary
is designed for easy sampling and for easily looking up
particular yōkai, but it can also be read straight through,
which may reveal surprising connections between different
creatures.
Researching Yōkai
Yōkai dwell in the contact zone between fact and fiction,
between belief and doubt. They inhabit a realm of narrative
in which laws of nature are challenged. And yōkai
themselves are always changing, from place to place and
generation to generation. Because of this mutability, broad
generalizations or simplistic statements about them are
tempting. With something so elusive and shape-shifting,
how can anybody say you are wrong? How do we prove
anything about these creatures?
Indeed, one is faced with a problem when writing about
yōkai: unlike historical figures, political events, or
economic changes, yōkai rarely make it into the
authoritative public record. They slip through the cracks of
official history. They don’t belong to anybody. Rather, they
are a kind of communal intellectual property: anybody can



play with them, change them, believe in them, and make
new versions of them to be sent out into the world. Of
course, these are all reasons why yōkai are deeply
revealing. They are a part of culture that tends to be
dismissed as “just folklore.” So how do you study
something that emerges anonymously, exists in multiple
versions, and circulates widely over time and space? What
do you do when there is no original? How do you research
yōkai?
A young woman would walk up to people on the street.
She was attractive, but she wore a large white surgical
mask over her mouth. She would tap a stranger on the
shoulder and ask, “Am I pretty?” Then she would remove
the mask. Her mouth was slit at the corners all the way up
to her ears. “Even like this?”
This is a legend I heard one day from a Japanese friend.
She had heard it as a child and recalled being afraid to
walk home from school alone. This frightening female yōkai
came to be known as the kuchi-sake-onna, or the “slit
mouthed woman,” and for a few months back in 1979 the
very thought of her terrified children throughout much of
Japan. In the codex, I have a longer entry on the kuchi
sake-onna, but I mention her now because, as a modern
urban yōkai, she serves as a good example of how one goes
about researching yōkai in general.
In my experience there are three general approaches,
each one informing the others. First there is ethnography:
talking with people, asking them about yōkai they grew up



with or encountered in their communities, their
hometowns, their apartment buildings, or even in manga
and anime. That is how I first learned of the kuchi-sake
onna—and then I followed up by asking almost everybody I
met for their versions of the legend and memories of what
it had meant to them. Sometimes this sort of research can
be easy: you just hang out in a bar and chat with
customers. But it can also require contacting a village
historian, formally interviewing a publisher or novelist, or
making an appointment at a shrine to talk with the priest.
It can entail participating in a public festival or getting
permission to attend a ritual or private ceremony. In some
cases, this kind of research requires living in a community
for a long time and gradually learning about people’s
everyday lives.
A complementary form of research is archival—digging
through primary sources. This might mean reading old
texts written in Sino-Japanese kanbun or examining Edo
period images or illustrated books. It can also entail
reading popular magazines or analyzing novels or
contemporary manga and anime. These materials can be
found in research libraries or museums, and sometimes in
local communities or private households. The kuchi-sake
onna, for example, did not appear in any of the official
historical documents I looked at, but I found dozens of
references to her when I combed through popular
magazines and tabloids from 1979 and the early 1980s; I
also came upon all sorts of other data that helped me



understand what she might have meant to people at that
time. I found most of these sources in archives in Tokyo,
but I also got some firsthand information from a record
producer whose company had once recorded a song about
the kuchi-sake-onna.
And finally, in Japan there has already been a great deal
of research on yōkai. Fortunately, highly trained scholars
have sorted through difficult old texts, sometimes
translating them into modern Japanese. They have looked
through images, and woodblock prints, and community
records and tracked down the yōkai lurking there. Japanese
scholarship on monsterdom is perhaps the most active in
the world. This means there are a great many secondary
sources—dictionaries, anthologies, collected art, and
documents, as well as insightful analyses. University
professors in Japan, in fact, have written numerous works
on yōkai, and today several freelance writers make a living
by writing and lecturing about yōkai. The legend of the
kuchi-sake-onna is recounted in a number of contemporary
legend collections; there is at least one doctoral
dissertation discussing her; and several scholars have
written about how she links to different female yōkai from
earlier periods or reflects sociocultural concerns. I did not
always agree with the analyses I read, of course, but they
helped me think more deeply and develop my own
interpretations.
As the kuchi-sake-onna example demonstrates,
investigating yōkai entails a mix of all three of these



approaches—ethnographic, archival, and secondary
research. For the majority of yōkai in this book, I relied in
part on archival materials and a great deal on the wealth of
secondary scholarship available in Japan. I have also
benefited immensely from getting to know some of the
researchers personally; they have made suggestions,
introduced me to primary materials, and engaged
thoughtfully with my ideas and interpretations.
Throughout this book, I try to be as accurate as possible
in my reporting and analysis. Accuracy may seem a strange
word to use when talking about yōkai, but it is precisely
because of their elusiveness that it is all the more
important to note where the data and ideas come from.
That is why I provide so many references and footnotes.
Most sources, inevitably, are in Japanese, but whenever
possible I also cite material in English, either translations
or original research, so that English-language readers can
know where to find more information. Unless otherwise
indicated, all translations from Japanese-language sources
are my own.
About Folklore
The word folklore in English is bandied about relatively
freely. It is a concept people tend to feel they understand
until they try to explain it. Folklore has actually always
been difficult to define and indeed has changed a great deal
since 1846, when the neologism Folk-Lore was introduced



by William J. Thoms to describe “the manners, customs,
observances, superstitions, ballads, proverbs, &c., of the
olden time.”2 All these things are still considered folklore,
but the “&c.” (etc.), of course, is all but endless. It includes
verbal folklore, everything from myth, legends, and
folktales to jokes, anecdotes, memorates, and even slang.
And material folklore—the making of things—can
encompass the throwing of a ceramic pot to folding origami
to baking a cake or carving a pumpkin. Another broad
genre is customary folklore: rituals, festivals, and beliefs
that are themselves often made up of, or expressed
through, a combination of verbal and material culture.
Think of a wedding, for instance, with its symbolic
exchange of rings or other objects, formulaic utterance of
vows, and eating of special foods.
One aspect of folklore that is often emphasized is
traditionality—the idea that something has added value
because of its association with the past (“the olden time,”
as Thoms would say). But tradition, too, is tricky to define; I
characterize it as referring to behaviors and beliefs that are
infused with special meaning or value in the present
because of a sense of continuity with the past and also with
the future. Traditions are constantly changing, even though
they retain (or seem to retain) some connection with the
way they were performed in past years or by previous
generations. And they are practiced in the present only
because they have (or seem to have) some bearing on the
future. Traditions, we might say, are creative continuity.



The process by which folklore operates is a kind of tug
of-war between two forces—the conservative pull of the
past versus the immediate pull of present (and future)
needs. Within this process there is also a contrast between
the communal voice that has developed over the years and
the innovative personal voice of the individual performer or
participant. It is out of this tension between conservatism
and dynamism that the folklore of the present is shaped
and experienced.3
This pull between past and present is one of the forces in
the creation and re-creation of yōkai through time. To a
certain extent, this tug-of-war applies more or less to any
process of creation—nothing is ever wholly new, and
nothing is ever exactly the same as what came before. But
one reason folklore is distinct from, say, fine art or a best
selling novel is that it tends to be unofficial and
noninstitutional: folklore is not controlled by formal
authorities, such as governments, schools, or established
religious institutions. This is not to say that there is no
overlap between folklore and these more official forms of
organization, but the things we call folklore usually fly
under the radar of these formal establishments. This is one
reason folklore is able to change so easily—because nobody
controls it.
Similarly, in principle, folklore is noncommercial. No
author or designer or professional artist dictates what is
correct or incorrect. Folklore does not belong to an
individual creator or a single group—it belongs to all the



people who engage with it.4 Of course, none of this is cut
and-dried: these are not definitions as much as they are
tendencies or orientations. In reality, as yōkai demonstrate,
there has always been a dynamic and symbiotic
relationship between folklore and commercial and popular
culture. But in general, folklore is free to travel and
reproduce—or rather, people can freely reproduce and
reinvent folklore, transmitting it from person to person
across time and space. And this is why any “single” item of
folklore tends to have multiple versions and variants. As we
will see, almost every type of yōkai exists in more than one
place at a given time (and more than one time in a given
place). Yōkai are characterized by these local and historical
versions: they are the same but different wherever and
whenever you find them.
And where do we find the yōkai of folklore? Often they
reside within some kind of story—usually a legend or a
folktale. While these two forms of narrative are related and
often overlap, folklorists generally make a simple
distinction. Legends tend to be thought of as true, or
possibly true, by the teller or listener or both. At the very
least, there is a question of truth or believability at their
core. They often include specific details of time and place,
as well as the names of characters (sometimes historical
people). Sometimes they are recounted as hearsay,
something about a “friend of a friend” (an FOAF, in
folklorist parlance). On the other hand, folktales are related
as fictional stories for purposes of entertainment; they take



place “once upon a time” or “deep in the woods,” and the
characters are often “an old man and an old woman” rather
than specific people. Yōkai are found in both these kinds of
stories, and they are also found in shorter anecdotes and
beliefs shared by people in a particular community.
We should also remember that not all folklore is
transmitted by word of mouth; today we accept that
folklore has always also been passed along through writing,
drawing, and the making of objects. Yōkai in particular
seem to inhabit visual media, such as picture scrolls and
woodblock prints, and also work their way into books of all
sorts. In contemporary culture, social networking, texting,
and other digital means of transmission increase the
creative ways in which beliefs, narratives, rumors,
memorates, ideas, fears, jokes, and so on are
communicated from person to person.
Finally, the notion of “folk” has also changed radically
since the early days of folklore studies. The folk are no
longer considered—as they once were—uneducated, rural
people. They are, to quote American folklorist Alan Dundes,
“any group of people whatsoever who share at least one
common factor. It does not matter what the linking factor is
—it could be a common occupation, language or religion
but what is important is that a group formed for whatever
reason will have some traditions which it calls its own.”5
Which brings us back to yōkai. While many of the yōkai
in this book have been around for a long time, this does not
mean they are only a thing of the past. Of course, the folk



for whom yōkai are relevant are long-ago warriors from the
Heian (794–1185) or Kamakura period (1185–1333), or
urban merchants from the Edo period (c. 1600–1868), or
perhaps even contemporary farmers working in small rural
villages. But the folk are also sleekly dressed commuters in
Japan’s thriving postmodern metropolises, and people like
you and me who share a common interest in these
mysterious, ever-changing phenomena. While some yōkai
may already be gone and faded from memory, new yōkai
and new versions of old yōkai are always being born, or
reborn, and infused with fresh energy. Recall the kuchi
sake-onna story: a modern legend, in an urban setting, told
by everyday people, and written about in popular
magazines. All this is to say that as long as human culture
persists, so too, in one form or another, yōkai will flourish.
If we are a folk group linked by an interest in yōkai, then
we are connected with people in other places whom we
have never met, and we are also connected with people
who are long dead, and people who have not yet been born.
THE LANGUAGE OF YŌKAI
Yōkai begin where language ends.
Mysterious sounds. Lights flitting through the graveyard.
A flood that destroys one village and leaves another
unscathed. A feeling that something is watching you in the
darkness. How do we speak of things that are ungraspable,
anomalous? What words can we use to signify things that



evade established categories and seemingly refuse to
conform to the laws of nature?
In Japan, as elsewhere, inexplicable occurrences and
supernatural creatures have been part of the cultural
imagination for as long as history has been recorded.
Broadly speaking, these diverse mysterious phenomena and
weird “things” have come to be called yōkai. In a sense,
yōkai is nothing more than a convenient label to indicate a
whole range of otherwise ineffable experiences that might,
in English, be translated with the words spirits, goblins,
phantoms, specters, sprites, shape-shifters, demons,
fantastic beings, numinous occurrences, the supernatural,
and perhaps most commonly today, monsters. This wide
variety of possible translations speaks to the open
endedness of the word and hints at the many different
ideas and nuances associated with it. Because of the
danger of narrowing the definition too much, in this book I
generally avoid translations and just use the word itself
and maybe, like sushi or tofu, it will take root in other
languages as well.
Mysterious Words
MONO-NO-KE 物の怪
In popular culture and scholarly literature in Japan today,
yōkai has become the umbrella term for an entire panoply



of mysterious phenomena and weird creatures. But the
common use of the word actually began relatively recently;
during different historical periods other terms have been
used. In the Heian period, for example, spooky and
unexplainable “things” were often called mono-no-ke. We
find mono-no-ke, for instance, in Murasaki Shikibu’s Genji
monogatari (The Tale of Genji, early eleventh century), the
most famous literary text of the Heian period, where they
tend to “take an invisible form imagined to signify human
spirits.”6 A direct translation of mono-no-ke is difficult, but
mono usually refers to “thing” or “matter” and ke to
something mysterious, suspicious, or troubling. Some
scholars suggest that in early texts mono did not refer to
concrete things as it does in modern Japanese but to
amorphous or ghostly things such as souls or spirits.7
Although this interpretation is disputed, we can
compromise by thinking of mono as the essence of
something and, therefore, characterize mono-no-ke as a
sense of spookiness and mystery. However we translate it,
though, mono-no-ke during the Heian period indicated
danger, uncertainty, and terror—something lurking out
there, just beyond reach, intending to do you harm.
ONI 鬼 AND HYAKKIYAGYŌ 百鬼夜行
Another term used to signify danger and fear was oni,
generally translated today as “demon” or “ogre.” During
the Heian period, oni was a default label for any sort of



nasty and threatening creature, usually but not always
humanlike in shape. For example, oni (in this case
pronounced ki) is embedded in the word, hyakkiyagyō
(alternatively pronounced hyakkiyakō), which can be
translated as “night procession of one hundred oni.” In
Heian-period texts, hyakkiyagyō usually refers to a
procession of dangerous beings passing through the Heian
capital (present-day Kyoto). Warnings that the hyakkiyagyō
would be out on a given evening were provided by the
Onmyōryō, the Bureau of Divination, staffed by
practitioners of Onmyōdō, a complex system of divination
and geomancy based on principles of yin and yang. When
the hyakkiyagyō was on the move, it was to be avoided:
suddenly the familiar space of the city was possessed by
wild, unpredictable, dangerous demons. For a short time,
this world and the other world would intersect and the
usual rules of human culture were invalid.
It was also possible for people traveling outside the city
to inadvertently stumble into alien territory possessed by
demons. One tale from Uji shūi monogatari (A Collection of
Tales from Uji, c. 1220?; hereafter Tales from Uji) tells of a
monk traveling alone through the province of Settsu (near
the present-day city of Osaka). Coming upon a deserted
temple, he decides to settle in for the night and begins
chanting an incantation to the guardian deity Fudō. But
suddenly, “a crowd some hundred strong came surging into
the temple, every one of them with a torch in his hand.
When they got close, he saw that they were fantastically



weird creatures, not men at all; there were all sorts of
them, some with only one eye, some with horns, while their
heads were more terrible than words can describe.” The
monk spends a terrifying night, surviving only because
Fudō protects him. After the gang of oni finally leaves and
the sun rises, the monk is shocked to discover that there is
actually no temple at all and he cannot even find the path
that brought him there. Eventually, he meets some
travelers who inform him that he is in the province of Hizen
—hundreds of miles from Settsu!8
In some cases even just looking at hyakkiyagyō could be
fatal. Ōkagami (The Great Mirror, c. 1100), for example,
recounts an episode in which a nobleman named Morosuke
encounters hyakkiyagyō while traveling through the
capital. After commanding his entourage to set down his
carriage, he lowers the blinds and recites a protective
incantation. After the danger finally passes, he raises the
blinds and continues his journey. (Interestingly, the passage
suggests that only Morosuke, as a member of the nobility, is
endangered by looking at the procession of demons;
apparently his servants cannot even see them.)9
Given the danger and fear associated with looking upon
this night procession, it is ironic that in succeeding
generations hyakkiyagyō would become the subject of
numerous illustrations, many of them lighthearted and not
in the least frightening. Perhaps the most famous are a
number of picture scrolls, many of which are simply called
Hyakkiyagyō emaki. Because the images in these picture



scrolls often allude to earlier versions (and the artists were
clearly aware of each other’s work), collectively they can be
thought of as a kind of series, with the Hyakkiyagyō emaki
label broadly applying to the genre itself. The oldest
(known) of these scrolls, believed to be by Tosa Mitsunobu
(1434?–1525?), dates from the Muromachi period. It
features a chaotic panoply of weird creatures and, although
the narrative is not entirely clear, concludes with the
appearance of a gigantic red fireball (probably the sun),
which causes the yōkai to scatter.10
TSUKUMOGAMI 付喪神
Notably, many of the weird creatures parading through
Tosa’s scroll are household items and other everyday
objects animated with legs, arms, eyes, and occasionally a
tail. There are, for example, a number of musical
instruments, such as a red-limbed creature with a biwa
(Japanese-style lute) for a head, dragging what looks like a
koto with legs and a reptilian tail.11 Such yōkai-ified
everyday objects are called tsukumogami. The morphing of
normal utensils (kibutsu) into yōkai seems to have been the
fate of objects that had survived a hundred years. Later on,
I discuss this further, but I’ll mention here that these
images transform the riot of oni and other frightening
creatures from the earlier Heian period into a playful
parade of household objects, including musical
instruments, rice containers, and tools for cooking. On one



hand, this trivializes the whole idea of the hyakkiyagyō as a
terrifying otherworldly threat that must not be looked at; at
the same time, it also brings the threat right into the home,
with the implication that even common household goods
possess the potential to become animated monsters.
The expression hyakkiyagyō, therefore, took on new
meanings over time, eventually becoming a catchall for all
sorts of fantastic creatures, from truly terrifying oni to
comical musical instruments and everything in between. It
was a word associated with danger but also,
simultaneously, with a carnivalesque topsy-turvy parade in
which all manner of creatures and objects danced riotously,
musically, through the streets. These picture scrolls not
only demonstrate great playfulness but also show a huge
assortment of yōkai of all different shapes and sizes. All
these elements—the tension between the fearful and comic,
the repulsive and appealing, as well as the emphasis on
playfulness, variety, and abundance—remain influential in
the yōkai world to this day. What is missing from the
images are humans: for a short time at least, the streets
belonged to these wild, lawless creatures.
BAKEMONO 化物 AND OBAKE お化け
During the Edo period, another word, bakemono, began
appearing in all sorts of contexts, from illustrated books to
Kabuki plays to misemono spectacle shows. Meaning
literally “changing thing” or “thing that changes,”



bakemono emphasizes transformation, a characteristic
common to many yōkai. But its usage was not limited only
to shape-shifting things: bakemono also applied to all sorts
of strangely formed, frightening, or anomalous creatures.
Even today, bakemono is commonly used in casual
conversation and sometimes in academic and literary
discussions. A related word, obake, is still popular as well,
particularly among children.12 Both bakemono and obake
are also similar to the English word monster and can refer
to an evil person or to somebody or something extremely
large, as in “look at that monster pumpkin!”

YŌKAI 妖怪



In recent years, however, yōkai has become the word of
choice. The term itself is made up of two Chinese
characters (kanji) both of which denote strangeness,
mystery, or suspicion. The word has roots in China but
appears in Japan as early as the eighth-century
mythohistorical text Shoku Nihongi, where it is stated that
because of a “yōkai”—inferably a strange or unfortunate
occurrence of some sort—a purification ceremony was held
at the Imperial Court.13 The word is rare during the
classical and medieval periods but starts to appear with
increasing frequency during the mid-Edo period, when it
was sometimes glossed with the pronunciation
“bakemono.”
However, it was not until the Meiji period (1868–1912),
most prominently in the work of Inoue Enryō, that yōkai
gradually became a technical term for all things beyond the
realm of explanation. In the first part of the twentieth
century, folklorist Yanagita Kunio used yōkai as a kind of
catchall word in his academic writing, and in the late
twentieth century it became the word of choice for the
popular manga artist Mizuki Shigeru. Today yōkai appears
frequently in both academic and popular writing, where, as
noted earlier, it is an umbrella signifier for things we
generally translate with terms such as monster, spirit,
goblin, demon, phantom, specter, fantastic being, lower
order deity, or unexplainable occurrence.14



Gods, Monsters, Strange Beasts, Ghosts
YŌKAI AND KAMI 神
A key concept associated with yōkai is kami (often used
with an honorific suffix: kami-sama), meaning “god” or
“deity.” Translations like this, however, can be misleading:
kami in Japan may be worshipped and prayed to, but they
do not have the all-powerful status attributed to gods in
monotheistic religions. Rather, there are multitudes of kami
inhabiting all sorts of things in the natural world. A large or
striking feature of the landscape, like a mountain or a
waterfall or an ancient tree, may contain (or actually be) a
kami; in other cases, kami may lodge in something small
and local, like a boulder, or a stone, or a trickling creek.
Kami are abundant and varied and all around: almost
anything, potentially, can possess a spirit.
I should note here that religion in Japan is notoriously
complex; the very idea of “religion” as such is really a
modern “invention.”15 Generally speaking, the two
dominant strains of thought are Buddhism and Shintoism;
but historically, and even now, these are intertwined with
each other. The kami worship described earlier is often
characterized as part of the “Shinto religion,” but in
practice Shinto is anything but an integrated and
institutionalized system. Rather, it may be thought of “as a
series of attempts at imposing a unifying framework upon
disparate kami cults, or at creating a distinct religious



tradition by transforming local kami cults into something
bigger.”16 Whether we call them kami cults or folk
religious practices or localized belief traditions, worship of
kami at natural sites and in small communities continues to
be part of everyday life in many parts of Japan. It is always
important to remember the plurality and disparity of these
traditions; the meaning of a kami in one time and place is
not (necessarily) the same as in the next. As scholars of
Shinto history put it, “The paths of the kami through
Japanese history have been manifold.”17
It is also important to remember that individual kami
may be powerful, but they are not necessarily good in the
moral sense. In fact, some kami are known for a short
temper and violence; the line between deity and demon is
rarely distinct and often depends on the perspective of the
humans affected. Similarly, Buddhism has numerous figures
of monstrous proportions who are both frightening and
benevolent. Broadly speaking, in the early historical period
in Japan the spirit of something could assume either of two
distinct attitudes: it could be angry and rough, and would
be known as an aratama, or gentle and beneficial, known as
a nigitama. Rough spirits were sometimes labeled oni, and
as we have already seen, oni are clearly related to yōkai.18
In short, although it is tempting to think in terms of a
simple opposition—kami good and yōkai bad—the line
between the two is blurry. Yanagita Kunio, the father of
folkloristics in Japan, suggested that yōkai are kami that
have “degraded” over time, an idea that suggests an



intimate relationship between the two. Moreover, although
yōkai are often considered mischievous and even
murderous, they are not necessarily defined by bad
behavior. An individual kami/yōkai can be evaluated
positively or negatively depending on one’s perspective: a
water spirit, for example, may be worshipped as a kami by
families for whom the river provides irrigation, and
despised as a yōkai by families who suffer drought. An act
that benefits one person may hurt another. Folklorist
anthropologist Komatsu Kazuhiko has suggested that yōkai
are “unworshipped” kami and kami are “worshipped”
yōkai.19
Both kami and yōkai reflect a way of thinking often called
animistic, meaning that the things in the world around us
rocks, rivers, even musical instruments—can possess
animating forces or spirits. In Japan, this way of thinking
has been important historically and may, as Komatsu
suggests, still be part of the consciousness of many people
today.20 Within such an animistic world, we can imagine a
continuum. On one end, where yōkai cluster, we have
everything that seems troublesome, undesirable,
unworshipped. The other end contains helpful, desirable,
and worshipped things—generally called kami. But these
are extremes, and any individual entity can move along this
continuum. If a “bad” yōkai does something “good,” we
might consider it a kami, and vice versa.
In other words, these identities are not set in stone; they
are contingent on the perspectives of the humans



interacting with them. Through appropriate human action,
such as rituals of pacification, a rough spirit might be
transformed into a gentle spirit. The very thing that
threatens human enterprises and society (aratama, yōkai)
can be changed into a beneficial and cooperating power
(nigitama, kami) in these same enterprises. One famous
example of transformation is Sugawara no Michizane (845
903), a Heian-period scholar and poet who was banished
for political reasons to an undesirable post in Kyushu. After
his death, it is said, he became a vengeful spirit (onryō) and
proceeded to cause a series of terrible misfortunes,
including untimely deaths, floods, and lightning storms.
Eventually, through government proclamations and
pacification ceremonies, he was deified, transformed into
the kami called Tenjin-sama. The calamities ceased.21 To
this day, there are shrines throughout Japan dedicated to
Tenjin-sama, considered the kami of learning because of
Michizane’s status in life as a great scholar. Every year
thousands of students flock to these shrines to pray for
success on their school entrance exams.
In the case of Michizane, then, human agency
transformed a murderous spirit into a beneficial kami who,
among other things, helps students. And this is an
important point, because ultimately judgments of good/bad,
troublesome/helpful, desirable/undesirable, and
worshipped/unworshipped are based on human
interpretation. Komatsu suggests, for example, that we can
imagine a scenario in which a bright object appears in the



sky and seems to fall somewhere. Everybody would agree
that this is a mysterious occurrence, but whether it is read
as a good omen or as a portent of ill fortune is up to the
observers. If it is taken as a bad sign, then we might
classify it as a kind of yōkai.22 Ultimately then, yōkai
provide insight into the way humans, at different historical
moments and in different circumstances, choose to
interpret the world around them.
MONSTERS AND KAIJŪ 怪獣
The idea that a yōkai might be read as an omen aligns well
with the English word monster, deriving as it does from the
Latin monstrum, a term that “to the Romans signified
generally a supernatural event thought to be a portent from
the gods, a warning of some sort.”23 In this sense,
“monster” is certainly a convenient translation for yōkai,
but at the same time the characteristics of yōkai can also
be quite different from those commonly associated with
monstrousness in the West today. In contemporary culture,
monsters are often portrayed as physically intimidating or
frighteningly grotesque; some yōkai are similar, but many
others express themselves through more spiritual, haunting
forms of mischief. In fact, those things that fit under the
rubric of yōkai run the gamut from tangible creatures to
intangible phenomena, from the solid and embodied to the
spiritual and ephemeral and everything in between. In
general, then, yōkai is a more inclusive and amorphous



concept than monster. Throughout this book, I mostly use
yōkai to refer to the things I am discussing and leave it to
the reader to determine how (or if) they differ from
monsters and similar things in other languages and
cultures.
We should, however, recognize another common
Japanese term often translated as “monster”: kaijū. Kaijū
shares a kanji (kai) with yōkai and might be translated as
“strange beast.” The difference between kaijū and yōkai is
murky, but kaijū usually encompass gigantic creatures such
as Godzilla, Mothra, and Gamera that appear in kaijū eiga,
or “monster movies.” Kaijū do not often, if ever, appear in
local folktales and legends. Generally speaking, then, kaijū
are physically giant creatures whose origins are traceable
not to folk roots but to commercial sources—usually a
movie. So even though Godzilla (or Gojira as it is known in
Japan) is one of Japan’s most globally infamous monsters,
in Japan Godzilla is not a yōkai.24
YŪREI 幽霊
Finally, one more relevant word is yūrei, generally
translated as “ghost.” A question that frequently comes up
when discussing yōkai is how they are distinct from yūrei
that is, how do yōkai and ghosts differ? As with all
questions relating to concepts as elusive as these, the
answer depends on factors such as the historical period
under discussion.



Writing in 1936, Yanagita Kunio argued that in the past
people were clear about the difference between ghosts
(yūrei) and obake/bakemono (by which we can assume he
means yōkai). He points out distinctions with regard to
place, victim, and time. Yōkai, he explains, “generally
appeared in set locations. If you avoided these particular
places you could live your entire life without ever running
into one.” On the other hand, yūrei were not associated
with particular locations but would chase after you
wherever you happened to be. Connected to this is the fact
that yōkai were not particular about who they tormented:
“They did not choose their victims; rather, they targeted
the ordinary masses.” In contrast, a yūrei “only targeted
the person it was concerned with.” Finally, yōkai could
appear any time of day or night but preferred the “dim
light” of twilight or dawn. Yūrei only came out during the
time of ushimitsu, the third quarter of the hour of the ox,
about 2:00–2:30 a.m., when night was at its darkest.25
Subsequent scholars have challenged Yanagita’s
distinctions, finding exceptions and pointing out that more
often than not a yūrei is associated with a human being
who has died. Given the broad definition of yōkai, then, the
best solution perhaps is to consider ghosts a subset of the
larger category of yōkai. This is what Komatsu Kazuhiko
suggests, explaining that ghosts can be thought of as a
special subcategory of yōkai just as we think of human
beings as a special subcategory of animals. Because
humans are animals who possess a particular kind of



culture, they tend to receive special attention within the
wider study of living things. So too ghosts, as yōkai with a
particular relationship to humans, have received special
attention within the wider study of yōkai.
Komatsu further points out that ghosts in Japanese
history and culture can be roughly divided into two related
“types.” The first is what we might call folkloric ghosts:
people who have died harboring a lingering attachment or
with unfinished business of some sort. They wander about
in the present world appearing much as they did when they
were alive. If you did not know they were dead, you might
not notice anything odd about them. Such ghosts often
harbor a deep resentment toward a particular individual, or
perhaps unquenchable feelings of love or friendship. In
some cases, a person becomes a ghost because he or she
has died suddenly with no opportunity to make peace with
the world. This type of ghost is common in legends and
personal-experience narratives, in which the plot revolves
around the sudden, shocking realization that a person who
seems very much alive is actually dead.
The second type of ghost, which overlaps with the first, is
common in drama and art. Its distinguishing feature is that
it clearly appears as somebody who has already passed to
the other side; he or she might be dressed in a funeral
shroud or have no feet—a particularly common trope for
Japanese ghosts. When you see one of these ghosts, you
know right away that you are dealing with a dead person.
This type of ghost makes for good theater and artwork but



rarely appears in folk narratives or local legends. A
significant aspect of both these types of ghosts is that they
are not just some vague scary presence, but rather they are
associated, often by name, with a specific person who once
was living.26
EVENT BECOMES OBJECT
By exploring various words relevant to yōkai, we get a
sense of both the history and the parameters of the concept
and the way it fits into particular cultural contexts. But
words get us only so far. So now I would like to take one
step back and think a little about the basic cognitive
processes that, in theory at least, give birth to yōkai. These
processes, of course, are not specific to Japan. Whether
they call them monsters or spirits or demons or whatever, it
is likely that all cultures have traditions involving
something that fits what we are calling yōkai. Thinking
about the genesis of yōkai, then, is really a philosophical
problem; it helps us explore how human beings struggle to
grasp, interpret, and control the world around them.
Imagine you are alone at night in an old house in the
countryside. You are lying in bed trying to fall asleep. All of
a sudden, you hear rattling sounds coming from the
windows and something scratching against the walls.
Perhaps it is only the wind, you think, and you get up and
walk to the window to listen more carefully. The sounds



stop. You open the window and peer out into the darkness,
but there is nothing, not even a breeze.
You go back to bed. The sounds begin again. Could it be
an animal? Maybe there is a squirrel or possum in the attic,
or something outside scratching against the side of the
house. But again, the instant you get up to check, the
sounds stop.
What if this went on night after night? During the day,
you inspect the house thoroughly, hoping for clear evidence
of an animal or maybe a tree brushing against the eaves.
But you find nothing at all. What now? You are confronted
with something that makes no sense, a phenomenon that
does not follow the rules of nature and the laws of science
as you have come to know them. But there must be an
explanation. Perhaps some human is causing this. Are there
mischievous kids in the neighborhood? Is somebody trying
to torment you? As far as you know, you have done nothing
to anger anybody.
At this point, when all possibilities in the known world
are exhausted, you might venture into the unknown. Maybe
something is trying to contact you. Are these mysterious
noises some sort of a sign? A warning to leave the house?
Or maybe they are a message of comfort, a signal that you
are protected and not alone? Is it possible that something
happened in this house long ago—somebody died, perhaps
—and the memory of that time is somehow expressed by
these strange sounds? The possibilities are endless, and



disconcerting, and along with the sounds themselves they
keep you awake at night.
Then late one evening when you finally fall asleep,
utterly exhausted, you dream of little demonlike figures,
each one with a hammer in its hand, banging away at the
foundations of your house, climbing the walls, scratching
with clawlike hands, rattling the windows. When you
awaken, you know that this is the cause of the noise—these
little creatures—and you call them yanari, meaning “house
sounders.” You have not necessarily solved the noise
problem, but now you have a name to associate with it, and
an image of the creatures causing it. It is no longer just
some vague mystery but an identifiable mystery. You are
being kept awake at night by yanari. And now you can start
thinking of how to make them go away.
Of course, the narrative here is imaginary—although
there is a yōkai called yanari that causes strange noises in
the house. But the point is that we can imagine a simple
process of reasoning through which an odd experience
mysterious noises at night—is gradually transformed into
an identifiable thing with a body and a name. Moreover,
perhaps this identifiable thing with a body and a name is
already part of common sense; when you tell a friend about
the strange sounds, she immediately identifies the culprit
as yanari and then describes them as little demonlike
figures with hammers. Your own imagination is informed by
this knowledge, and when you hear these sounds again, all
you see in your mind’s eye are yanari. In a sense, this is



folklore at work: commonly shared knowledge (lore) passed
from person to person helps us make sense of new and
unfamiliar experiences. It also can provide a solution: since
you now know the cause of the problem, you may be able to
find a special charm or incantation to rid you of these
mischievous demons.
Take another example. You have spent all day cutting
wood in the forest. It is dark now. You are hungry and
exhausted and you have a long way to travel. So you hoist
your pack onto your shoulders and set off through the
mountains. You walk and walk, and then suddenly, at a
certain point, you just cannot take another step forward. It
feels like something is blocking you, as if you have walked
into a solid but invisible wall. And in fact there is a yōkai,
called a nurikabe (plaster wall), described in just this way:
an invisible wall that prevents you from moving forward. In
the second half of the twentieth century, manga artist
Mizuki Shigeru illustrated this nurikabe—giving it legs and
arms and two little eyes. It would soon become a standard
character in his manga and anime, known to children and
adults throughout Japan. So we can see here the process by
which a strange phenomenon (not being able to move
forward anymore) becomes a yōkai (the nurikabe) and
eventually even becomes a famous character.
In an interesting parallel, marathon runners are often
said to “hit a wall” around the twentieth mile of their race.
Certainly hitting a wall is a powerful image for the sudden
fatigue that overtakes a runner who no longer has energy



to continue. Literally speaking, of course, there is no wall.
But that is just the point—we do not always speak literally.
Rather, we often speak figuratively, drawing on metaphor
and other figures of speech to accurately and gracefully
express our ideas or feelings. Here the runner projects an
internal experience (from inside the body) onto the external
world. The violent image of hitting the wall is a vivid,
memorable, and effective way to articulate a sense of
helplessness.
The runner’s experience dovetails neatly with the idea of
bumping into a nurikabe. If hitting the wall itself is a
metaphorical expression, then nurikabe is a slightly more
concrete (no pun intended) metaphor, in which the
phenomenon is not just described by alluding to the feeling
of hitting a wall but is given its own special name and
personality. (By calling a yōkai a metaphor, I am by no
means saying it is not real—it is as real as any other “thing”
for which we have a word or figure of speech.)
But of course, scientists would not explain sudden
energy loss as “nurikabe.” Rather, they might say that the
experience of “hitting the wall” occurs when the body’s
“glycogen supplies have been exhausted and energy has to
be converted from fat.”27 Does this mean that the nurikabe
is just an explanation for people who know nothing about
biology or medicine? Of course, how you explain something
depends on your background and culture—your education,
interests, values, beliefs. We could just as easily say that
“glycogen depletion” is how people who know nothing



about yōkai explain the experience of meeting a nurikabe!
In some ways, in fact, this might be the most persuasive
explanation—after all, I can draw a picture of a nurikabe,
but I have no idea where to begin with glycogen.
All this is to say that by exploring yōkai we challenge
ourselves to ponder issues of belief, both personal and
cultural, as well as metaphysical and phenomenological
questions about the ways we experience and perceive our
lives. Although belief in the supernatural is often debunked
as irrational or unscientific, for example, we can actually
consider the processes through which yōkai are created to
be, in a sense, rational. The unknown, the feared, those
things that overwhelm us with anxiety, are carefully
identified, given form, and labeled. Only then can we
grapple with them. Whether we label something with the
name of a yōkai or a disease, whether we call it nurikabe or
glycogen depletion, identifying it helps us work out an
appropriate response—which of course is a pretty rational
way to deal with a problem.
The creation of yōkai is a process through which fear,
mystery, the unknown, is transformed into something
concrete. The hyakkiyagyō discussed earlier, for example,
started out as a terrifying and amorphous experience but
was shaped over time into something that could be
illustrated and eventually even laughed at. We can think of
this process as a gradual movement from pandemonium to
parade, from chaotic fear of the intangible unknown to an
orderly and lighthearted display of identifiable creatures.



Event, Presence, Object
With all the foregoing in mind, I will briefly introduce the
way Komatsu Kazuhiko, probably the leading academic
authority on the supernatural in Japan, analyzes the
development of yōkai within Japanese history. In part, I
review Komatsu’s ideas here because they have influenced
my own thinking about the subject, but more importantly
because they reflect and have influenced the ideas of a
great many scholars currently working in Japan. Komatsu’s
books are often read by the general public as well, so they
also have an effect on popular notions of yōkai throughout
the country. Komatsu presents a kind of structural analysis,
dividing yōkai into three “realms” or “domains”: yōkai as
event, as presence, and as object.
YŌKAI AS EVENT
This domain of yōkai is entered when you experience
something strange, mysterious, or weird through one (or
more) of your five senses. When you feel that this
phenomenon (genshō) or event (dekigoto) is caused by an
“undesirable supernatural thing” (nozomashikunai
chōshizenteki na mono), you are positing the intervention
of a “yōkai.” In theory, any of the five senses—sight,
hearing, smell, touch, or taste—can play a role in the
experience, but the majority are perceived through the
eyes and ears.



Komatsu tells of somebody spending the night in a hut in
the countryside. Late at night he hears a tree being
chopped down in the distance, but when he investigates he
finds no evidence of a felled tree. It turns out that there has
long been folklore about this sort of phenomenon; it is
known as furusoma. So with this knowledge, an odd event
takes on the name of a yōkai called furusoma, about which
there are already legends and beliefs. Through narrative
and exchange, shared knowledge about this yōkai develops
and gradually becomes part of a communal yōkai culture.
YŌKAI AS PRESENCE
The second domain is presence (sonzai). All around us are
“things,” such as animals and other presences, some of
which we interpret as “supernatural.” Within the generally
animistic worldview that has long been part of the Japanese
cultural imagination, not only do all things possess souls or
spirits (rei or tama), but also we personify these spirits,
attributing to them the kind of emotions we know from
ourselves and other humans. They can be angry or sad,
grateful or happy, and these emotions directly affect the
human world: anger can be expressed in stormy weather or
disease, and happiness expressed by a good catch or
bountiful harvest. Komatsu stresses that during the ancient
period (kodai) most natural phenomena were attributed to
the machinations of a limited number of yōkai, such as oni,
tengu, kitsune, and tanuki.



YŌKAI AS OBJECT
For the third realm, Komatsu uses the word zōkei, which I
render as “object,” but which could also be translated as
“figure,” “image,” or “sculpted item”—that is, it refers to a
created physical thing of some sort. With the introduction
of Buddhism to Japan (in the sixth century) people created
figures of deities and other spirits. During the Heian
period, picture scrolls became a popular form of artistic
literary expression among the courtier classes, and certain
yōkai-like creatures were illustrated for the first time.
During the Muromachi period, a variety of illustrated texts
became popular with merchant and working classes as
well, and folk narratives featuring yōkai proliferated within
these visual formats.
This creation of images was profoundly important for the
cultural history of yōkai. As image-making continued
through the years, many of the yōkai pictured did not come
from local beliefs; rather, they were invented for purposes
of recreation, pleasure, and amusement. This process of
illustrating yōkai had two critical effects. First, certain
yōkai became fixed with regard to how they were depicted
—oni, for example, were illustrated with horns and a tiger
skin loincloth—and these images became the accepted,
shared understanding of the yōkai in question. At the same
time, however, the creativity involved in image-making also
led to a major increase in the number and kinds of yōkai.28



Questioning Yōkai
Komatsu’s brief summary here neatly prefigures the
historical discussion in the next part of this book. It also
encapsulates the processes through which yōkai evolve,
exploring the question “What are yōkai?” and, more
important, “Why are yōkai?” Ultimately, yōkai have no
single definition or function—they are the spooky
unexplainable things lurking on the edge of knowledge, and
they are simultaneously the pictures—sometimes scary,
sometimes cute or goofy—of what we imagine such things
to look like. In the final analysis, defining yōkai is less
interesting than the questions they raise and the
discussions they inspire.
One question often asked about yōkai is whether people
actually believe in them. This is tricky to answer, in part
because it depends on what historical period, and which
yōkai, we are discussing. Implicit in a question like this,
however, is the assumption that there are only two
possibilities—belief or doubt. One thing yōkai teach us is
that between belief and doubt, between the literal and the
metaphorical, lies a zone of ambiguity that is fertile ground
for the imagination.
Humans seem to have a tremendous capacity to embrace
different ideas, even ones that may seem contradictory. Any
time we hear a story, read a novel, or watch a movie with
fictional characters, we allow ourselves to “believe” in
people and activities we know are not “real.” But of course
in one sense they are real: they make us laugh and cry, and



they stay with us as memories, affecting the way we think
and feel. We often express strong emotions about fictional
characters—love and hate and everything in between.
When it comes to yōkai, too, different attitudes and
different truths can interact productively—a process I call
cognitive resonance. That is, the balance of seemingly
contradictory ideas itself reflects a realistic and meaningful
stance. One common Japanese phrase in the discussion of
yōkai is hanshin-hangi, which means “half-belief/half
doubt.” The appeal of this phrase is that it does not call for
a decision one way or the other but combines two halves
into a whole, a single attitude that recognizes that belief
and doubt can live together harmoniously. Perhaps the
question is not whether people believe in yōkai but why we
require a yes-or-no answer in the first place.
Another yōkai-related question is whether Japan has
more monsters and fantastic creatures than other countries
do. Of course this depends on how we define such
creatures. Moreover, to answer it thoroughly would require
a tremendously extensive survey! Certainly, yōkai-like
creatures and supernatural beings are found in cultures
throughout the world—they are by no means unique to
Japan—and they seem to be more prominent in some places
than in others. In Ireland, for example, and certain
European, African, and Native American cultures, such
creatures still thrive in the cultural imagination and
popular media. To a certain extent, I think, this stems from
a deep association with local place—many such creatures,



and the stories told about them, are linked to specific
features of the landscape. Most important, they survive
because people choose to continue to tell their stories, to
document them, to re-create them, to keep them alive.
And this is certainly the case in Japan. In contemporary
Japanese culture, yōkai may indeed be more prominent
than monsters and spirits are in many other countries. If
so, this is in part because of their deep connections to local
places, to the landscape, and to folklore and history. And
more important, it is because of the long and intimate
relationship of local places, folklore, and history with art,
literature, and popular culture. Having long ago been
documented—made into objects, as Komatsu might put it
even old yōkai continue to have a presence in
contemporary culture. This presence has been bolstered by
key individuals who have breathed new life into yōkai at
various times, reinvigorating them in the popular
imagination.
I will also make the related argument that in Japan,
perhaps more than in other countries, yōkai have long been
the subject of serious academic study. Again, I don’t think
this has anything intrinsic to do with the nature of yōkai
themselves or with some essential cultural attitude. Rather,
it is because of specific historical circumstances through
which certain intellectual leaders brought attention to the
position of yōkai, gradually making viable their serious
study.



The next chapter of this book takes a more detailed look
at some of these people, and at the ways in which the
representation of yōkai and the study of yōkai have evolved
over the centuries. We can see how the theoretical
concepts mentioned here play out against the backdrop of
Japanese history and cultural change.



2
Shape-Shifting History
Most likely in every part of the globe, human beings have
shaped mysterious and fearful phenomena into monsters
and spirits as a way of making sense and meaning of their
experiences. But the particular shapes such monsters and
spirits assume are anything but universal. They are
sculpted by the distinct cultures and societies in which they
emerge, evolving through specific historical moments and
with the changing desires and challenges of the people who
tell their tales.
To understand the history of yōkai, then, we have to meet
some of the individuals who have sought, documented,
illustrated, explained, and discussed them over the
centuries. That is, it is impossible to separate yōkai from
their times and their texts, and from the people who have
considered them. As otherworldly as yōkai may seem, they
are also, of course, part of this world; throughout history
both sword and pen have been invoked to eliminate them
as a dangerous menace or, alternatively, to capture,



preserve, and breathe life into them as a cherished part of
heritage.
Yōkai have generally been overlooked in serious political,
military, and social histories. To a certain extent this is
because, like so many kinds of folklore, they are a taken
for-granted part of everyday life and rarely make it into
official documents or registers. Moreover, when they did
come to people’s attention in the past, particularly during
the modern period, it was only as unimportant relics or
dangerous superstitions that were to be destroyed. All the
more reason, then, to seek them out, because yōkai can in
fact be found in all sorts of cultural records throughout
Japanese history—in folklore, literature, encyclopedias, art,
and even games. The yōkai in these places may point to
overlooked ideas and changes and offer an unusual view of
the wide sweep of Japanese history.
The pages that follow briefly trace the history of yōkai by
introducing some of the big names—people both ancient
and living who are associated with the world of yōkai. This
includes a few legendary sorcerers and warriors famous for
subduing yōkai, and it also includes artists, scholars, and
writers who have illustrated and documented them.
Along the way, I also explore some major texts and
trends in which yōkai have appeared. I focus mainly on
written works, but even as they were being captured on
paper, yōkai remained a feature of lived experience, part of
beliefs, festivals, legends, and folktales throughout the
country. These local versions, often passed along through



oral tradition, very much influenced the textually captured
versions, and vice versa. Most of my examples come from
written sources simply because writing, as a technology for
preserving thoughts, provides the easiest (though not
necessarily the most complete) access to the past.
Some of the people and texts mentioned have already
appeared in the preceding chapter, but here I situate them
within a broader historical context. This brief outline,
however, is by no means a thorough review of the role
yōkai have played in Japan’s complex history. For example,
I only fleetingly touch on yōkai illustrations, since the visual
culture and art history of yōkai deserve a whole separate
book or series of books. But the pages that follow are
intended to convey a broad sense of both changes and
continuities in how people have imagined and understood
yōkai through the centuries. The various sections in this
chapter, therefore, introduce some of the highlights, the
moments and places where yōkai appear most prominently,
and where they clearly reflect the social, cultural, and
intellectual circumstances of the moment.
HEROES OF MYTH AND LEGEND
Susa-no-O, Dragon Slayer
Other than wooden slips called mokkan, seals, and similar
fragments of writing, the earliest known texts in Japan are
the mythohistorical Kojiki (712) and Nihonshoki (720).1



Although the word yōkai itself does not appear in these
works, they do include some terrifying and monstrous
creatures—as well as people, or gods, who subdue them.
Perhaps the most famous is a deity named Susa-no-O, the
mischievous younger brother of the sun goddess,
Amaterasu. In one episode, Susa-no-O meets an old couple
in despair because every year an “eight-tailed dragon,”
known as Yamata no Orochi, comes and devours one of
their daughters. “His eyes are like red ground cherries,”
the father explains. “His one body has eight heads and
eight tails. On his body grow moss and cypress and
cryptomeria trees. His length is such that he spans eight
valleys and eight mountain peaks. If you look at his belly,
you see blood oozing all over it.”
Susa-no-O asks for the hand of the remaining daughter
and then orders wine to be made and a fence built. “Make
eight doors in the fence,” he tells them. “At each door, tie
together eight platforms, and on each of these platforms
place a wine barrel. Fill each barrel with the thick wine of
eightfold brewings, and wait.” Eventually, the huge serpent
appears, and “putting one head into each of the barrels,”
drinks until drunk, and then falls asleep. Susa-no-O duly
unsheathes his sword and “hack[s] the dragon to pieces.”
His own blade eventually breaks inside the tail of the
creature and, digging around, he finds another sword, the
spectacular Kusanagi, a legendary weapon that would
eventually, along with a mirror and jewel (called a



magatama), become part of the so-called imperial regalia of
Japan.2
Susa-no-O’s slaying of the Yamata no Orochi is a very
early example of what would come to be known as a yōkai
taiji, or yōkai conquest, a traditional narrative in which a
(usually) human hero manages to vanquish or kill a
dangerous yōkai. Such narratives resurface again and
again in local folk culture as well as in written and
theatrical venues.
Early Textual Sources
Along with the Kojiki and Nihonshoki, some of the earliest
Japanese texts are regional gazetteers, known as fudoki,
which contained all sorts of historical and geographical
records as well as local legends, myths, folktales, rituals,
and beliefs. Not surprisingly, they also document kami and
demonic creatures, though it is important to interpret them
with the particular historical and political circumstances in
mind. For example, the Hizen no kuni fudoki (Fudoki from
Hizen Province; Hizen was the region of present-day Saga
and Nagasaki Prefectures) refers to a creature called a
tsuchigumo, an “earth spider.” This certainly sounds like a
yōkai, and eventually it would become one. But in these
early texts, tsuchigumo is actually used as a kind of ethnic
slur in order to demonize, to make less than human, the
native residents of the area that the Yamato people, the
authors of the Fudoki, were trying to conquer.3



During the Heian, Kamakura, and Muromachi eras, we
encounter many more written records. One of the richest
resources from this time is a literary genre called setsuwa.
Although opinions differ about how to actually define the
term, setsuwa are generally explained as short prose
narratives that were gathered and organized into
collections. Some of these anecdotes and legends originally
came from oral tradition. Many seem to express a moral of
some sort and may have been used for didactic purposes.
Indeed, some collections are clearly assembled to promote
a specific set of Buddhist principles. Others seem to have
been gathered by a fun-loving collector and contain
humorous stories, satiric commentaries, and sometimes
wondrously gory descriptions. Although there are
numerous setsuwa collections, the most famous are Nihon
ryōiki (Miraculous stories of karmic retribution of good and
evil in Japan; ninth century; hereafter Miraculous Stories),
Konjaku monogatari shū (Collection of tales of times now
past; eleventh or twelfth century; hereafter Tales of Times
Now Past), and Tales from Uji. No one is certain of the
objectives of the compilers and editors of these works, but
now these collections are rich storehouses of information
about the beliefs, attitudes, and experiences of people of
the past. As with all texts, literary and otherwise, they must
be carefully interpreted and understood within the context
of their production.4
From the Muromachi into the early Edo period (late
fourteenth century through the end of the seventeenth



century), there flourished a new literary genre known
broadly as otogizōshi, or “companion books.” Hundreds of
otogizōshi are extant today, and more are being discovered
all the time. They come in a variety of formats but, on the
whole, are relatively short, entertaining narratives that
often include illustrations. Content varies greatly: there are
stories about people from all walks of life, religious
narratives, animal stories, travel adventures, and tales
concerning various yōkai.
One famous early (fourteenth-century) otogizōshi is the
Tsuchigumo-zōshi, which is in the form of a picture scroll
and tells of the heroic conquest of the earth spider. In
contrast to its appearance centuries earlier in the Fudoki
from Hizen Province, the tsuchigumo in this scroll is a full
fledged yōkai, a gigantic spider-demon surrounded by its
progeny of smaller spiderlike monsters, all fully illustrated
in color.5 The tsuchigumo is just one example of the way
the “same” yōkai can appear differently at different times,
invoked for diverse purposes in a wide range of media. Of
course, it is always difficult to access the past, particularly
intimate qualities of belief, through textual sources. But for
exploring the development of yōkai and human interactions
with yōkai, these texts are invaluable, and we know much
of what follows because of setsuwa and otogizōshi.
Abe no Seimei, Sorcerer Extraordinaire



Susa-no-O is a mythological deity, but as far back as the
Heian period, there were also humans who were very much
involved with the spirit world. One of the most famous was
Abe no Seimei, a historical figure who lived from 921 to
1005. Seimei was an onmyōji, a practitioner of Onmyōdō, a
divinatory and geomancy practice with roots in Chinese
yin-yang and five-element philosophies.6 As mentioned
earlier, it was the Onmyōryō, or the Bureau of Divination,
that determined which nights the hyakkiyagyō were out.
Technically this Bureau of Divination was divided into four
sections, each with its own specialty: (1) divination, (2)
calendar, (3) astronomy and meteorology, and (4) time
measurement and scheduling.7 In practice, all these were
somewhat related, and the bureau was called on for a
range of services, including interpreting the dreams of
court nobility, performing purification ceremonies,
calculating auspicious dates, and exorcising spirits when
somebody was possessed.8 The Abe family and the Kamo
family held the directorship of the bureau during the Heian
period.
Because of their influential and mystical role within the
government during this period, Onmyōdō practitioners
came to be portrayed as powerful wizards specializing in
quelling yōkai, exorcizing bad spirits, and intoning secret
spells in order to kill people. Historical evidence suggests
that Abe no Seimei himself was nothing more than a
“middle-ranking bureaucrat” who performed a variety of
services for the court and eventually rose to become the



highest-ranking and most prominent of the onmyōji. One
scholar notes that, compared to the rise of other onmyōji,
Seimei’s rise was not particularly smooth; had he not lived
such a long life, he might not even be remembered today.9
Regardless of historical evidence (or its scarcity), however,
Abe no Seimei came to be thought of as the embodiment of
supernatural power and his life became enshrouded in
legend. It was said, for example, that his father, Abe no
Yasuna, saved the life of a fox, who returned the favor by
transforming into a beautiful woman. Seimei (or Dōji as he
was known as a child) was the result of their coupling—a
sort of human-yōkai hybrid born with insight into both
worlds.10
A legend recounted in the Tales of Times Now Past tells
how a young Seimei was attending his teacher, Kamo no
Tadayuki, as they traveled through the capital. Tadayuki
had fallen asleep inside the carriage when Seimei spied a
frightening group of oni (perhaps a hyakkiyagyō) moving in
their direction. He woke up Tadayuki, who cast a spell over
the travelers to hide them from the oni, and eventually the
danger passed. After this incident, Tadayuki took Seimei
under his wing because he was so impressed by the young
man’s special ability to see oni.11
The life of the adult Seimei is similarly embellished with
legends, many of which celebrate his prowess as a wizard.
One famous episode plays off his supposed rivalry with
another onmyōji, Ashiya Dōman. In the story, Dōman hears
of Seimei’s abilities and challenges him to a contest, the



loser of which must become the winner’s disciple. On the
emperor’s orders, sixteen daikōji, a type of citrus fruit, are
secretly put into a box, and the two wizards are challenged
to reveal what is inside. Dōman stares at the box for a long
time and then declares that it contains sixteen of the fruits.
Next it is Seimei’s turn, and he promptly declares that the
box contains sixteen mice. The government ministers and
nobility, who all favor Seimei, are disappointed by his
incorrect answer and are reluctant to open the box. Finally,
however, they remove the lid, only to discover that it does
indeed contain sixteen mice. In other words, Seimei’s
power allowed him not just to see through a sealed box but
also to change what it contained. As promised, Dōman
submits to becoming Seimei’s disciple.12
The image of Seimei and his exploits, therefore, has been
shaped through legend and through numerous literary and
dramatic portrayals. He makes a striking appearance, for
example, in the Noh drama Kanawa (The Iron Crown). In
the play, a man is haunted by nightmares; Seimei soon
divines the cause of his malaise to be his wife, who is
deeply resentful of his philandering. The wife has
transformed herself into a demon who will, Seimei
foresees, try to kill the husband that very evening. Through
secret spells and rituals, Seimei manages to successfully
transfer the wife’s hatred to effigies of the husband and his
new lover, thus saving the man’s life (though, sadly, doing
nothing to resolve the cause of the wife’s resentment).13



Seimei and other onmyōji were also said to have at their
command a magical familiar, or spirit servant, known as a
shikigami. Often portrayed as a demonic, grotesque, oni
like figure, a shikigami was charged with doing the bidding
of its master, whether the job was critically important or
completely mundane. For example, rumor had it that the
doors in Seimei’s house would open by themselves because
of the machinations of his shikigami. More significantly,
shikigami served as bodyguards and magical protectors for
their controllers; they could even be sent to inflict illness or
kill an enemy. It was said that an onmyōji could actually
create shikigami through magic; by using a complex series
of spells and incantations, he could transform a piece of
paper or wood into this potent spirit. In some cases, an
onmyōji might also transform a defeated yōkai or oni into a
shikigami.14
Legend has it that Seimei himself had twelve shikigami
at his command. While they were usually invisible to the
average person, at night you might catch a glimpse of them
in his house. Seimei’s wife found them frightening and
unpleasant to look at, so she pleaded with her husband to
remove them, and eventually Seimei put them in a stone
box that he hid under a nearby bridge, called Ichijō-modori
bashi. As one scholar points out, a bridge is a particularly
strategic place to stash one’s familiars; not only does it
represent a symbolic connection with the other world—a
link between one realm and another—but it is also a place
people pass over, often while having conversations and



revealing potentially valuable information. All of which
could be extremely handy for a diviner and wizard.15
The Ichijō-modori-bashi bridge is a real place in Kyoto
and can still be visited today, but researchers have pointed
out that “there is no mention in the historical record of Abe
no Seimei employing shikigami, and virtually none even of
shikigami themselves.”16 Indeed, historical evidence
regarding shikigami is vague and varied. Like so much
about Seimei, our understanding of these supernatural
attendants is shaped by legend, literature, and drama, and
even by later academic speculation. The fact that shikigami
are so hard to pin down historically does not make them
less interesting or valuable—as with all yōkai, their
meaning at any given moment reflects the imaginations of
the humans who conjure them up.
To a certain extent Seimei, Onmyōdō, and shikigami are
popular today because they are one part of a general
fascination with yōkai and the supernatural. Within this
broader context, however, they seem to occupy a
particularly glamorous position. To interject a brief
personal anecdote: I first encountered Abe no Seimei in
early 1999, when I was a graduate student trying to write a
paper about The Iron Crown. I was eager to find out more
about this mysterious sorcerer, so I scoured the Japanese
collections at university libraries in the United States.
Eventually I found a few relevant references here and
there, usually in dusty old books that nobody had opened
for years; but for the most part Seimei seemed an obscure,



if intriguing, figure. My research did not get far. Later that
year, however, I went to Japan. I walked into a Tokyo
bookstore, and there was an entire display table covered
with novels, manga, and research monographs about
Seimei! I soon learned that Japan was in the midst of an
Abe no Seimei boom.
In fact, Seimei had never completely disappeared from
the popular imagination; throughout the Edo period his
status as a hero became firmly entrenched through legend,
fiction, and drama. But it wasn’t until the Heisei period,
particularly beginning in the 1990s, that he reemerged as a
sexy star of modern literature and popular culture. This
newfound popularity began with a series of romantic
historical novels, titled Onmyōji, written by Yumemakura
Baku (b. 1951) and featuring Seimei as a handsome young
man, often accompanied by his nobleman friend, Minamoto
no Hiromasa Ason (also a historical figure). The first book
appeared in 1988 and was followed by numerous others, as
well as an extremely popular manga series by Okano Reiko
(b. 1960), a television series, and two feature-length films
(2001 and 2003). In all these versions, the image of Seimei
was “re-imagined as a bishōnen, a beautiful young man
with huge eyes, flowing locks, and a sculpted face.” This
“extreme makeover,” as one scholar puts it, transformed
the Heian-period sorcerer into a delicate and handsome
idol who conforms to the gaze of contemporary Japanese
girls and young women, presumably the primary consumers
of Seimei novels, manga, and films.17



During the 1990s and early 2000s, in response to
Seimei’s newfound popularity and the makeover of his
image, dozens of Onmyōdō-related shrines throughout the
country were rejuvenated. In Kyoto, for example, Seimei
jinja (shrine) is relatively small and not centrally located,
but it is now a popular pilgrimage site for Seimei fans. The
shrine itself is crisply decked out with Onmyōdō symbolism
—five-pointed stars, sun-moon motifs, yin-yang symbols
and sells all manner of charms and other official souvenirs.
A shop right next to it has also tried to make the most of
Seimei’s popularity, selling Seimei and Onmyōdō T-shirts,
key chains, cell phone straps, and other “unofficial”
goods.18 Akin to so many of the yōkai featured in this book,
the Seimei of the past—of the Heian period, and even of
Edo-period legend and literature—is very different from the
Seimei of the early twenty-first century.
Minamoto no Yorimitsu, Legendary Warrior
Seimei’s life overlapped historically with that of another
hero of the yōkai world: Minamoto no Yorimitsu (948?
1021), commonly known as Raikō (the Sinified reading of
Yorimitsu). Like Abe no Seimei, Raikō was a real person; he
was a member of the Seiwa Genji, a branch of the
Minamoto family renowned for its great warriors. And like
Seimei, Raikō is most remembered today through the
legends that grew up around him—in this case, legends
about his prowess as a warrior and his ability to subdue



yōkai with sword and cunning. Perhaps his most famous
yōkai conquest is that of Shuten dōji, a great oni that
terrified the capital. In some versions of this legend, Abe no
Seimei is the diviner who reveals the location of the demon,
so we get an instance of the two superheroes—one the
brains, the other the brawn—working together to rid the
capital of a troublesome monster.
Tales of Raikō are found in various sources, including the
“Book of Swords” (Tsurugi no maki) section of Heike
monogatari (The Tale of the Heike), various otogizōshi, Noh
drama, and Kabuki. In addition to conquering Shuten dōji,
Raikō is also the hero of the Tsuchigumo-zōshi, mentioned
earlier. This picture-scroll narrative recounts a journey of
Raikō and his faithful companion, Watanabe no Tsuna, one
of four trusty retainers. Raikō and Tsuna come across a
dilapidated old house, where they encounter all sorts of
yōkai, including a 290-year-old woman, a nun with a
gargantuan face, a sixty-meter-tall oni, a kitsune fox, and
some random tsukumogami. In the end, they finally meet
up with the gigantic earth spider, which Raikō duly
beheads.19
Legends about Raikō nicely complement legends about
Seimei. Raikō is the brawny, visceral warrior who conquers
his enemies with his strength and his sword. Seimei, on the
other hand, is the mystical, divining, intellectual
counterpart who exerts power over others through
knowledge, magic, and the strength of his secrets spells.
Together these yōkai-hunting heroes neatly reflect the



duality of event and object inherent in the very concept of
yōkai: while Seimei divines the mysterious phenomenon,
Raikō fights the weird body.
WEIRD TALES AND WEIRD TASTES
The Tokugawa, or Edo period, from around 1600 to 1868,
was a time of great dynamism and change in Japan.
Without oversimplifying a span of almost three centuries,
we can say that during this period the disparate domains of
the Japanese islands were, relatively speaking, united as
one country through a complex system of oversight with a
strong military government based in Edo (present-day
Tokyo) and a weak but symbolically meaningful emperor in
Kyoto. It was a period of comparative peace and rigid social
order, often enforced by government suppression. Cities
expanded rapidly: by 1700 the population of Edo was
greater than that of either Paris or London at the time,
making it one of the largest metropolitan centers in the
world.20
As people converged from communities all over Japan,
urban centers such as Edo and Osaka became dynamic
sites of cultural exchange and creativity. The Edo period
witnessed the rise of Kabuki drama and ningyō jōruri
puppet theater (generally called bunraku today). Along
with these dramatic arts, there developed a massive
publishing industry that produced ukiyoe woodblock prints
(the movie posters of their day) and printed thousands of



relatively inexpensive books, many of which were filled
with color and black-and-white images, making them the
equivalent of today’s manga and popular literature. Not
surprisingly, yōkai also proliferated during this period of
vibrant cultural activity, finding new homes in the world of
commercial art, popular literature, and drama. At the same
time, they remained part of local culture—still thriving in
folktales and legends. As literary scholar Sumie Jones puts
it, “One of the intersections between the high and the low
was a taste for the weird.”21
Spooky Tales: Hyaku-monogatari 百物語
One way in which yōkai from local rural communities made
their way onto a more national (or regional) urban stage
was through a practice called hyaku-monogatari. These
were gatherings at which spooky stories, called kaidan,
were exchanged one after another with the intent of
inducing a supernatural experience. The procedure was
simple: people would gather in a large room, sometimes in
a temple or other semipublic venue, and tell short, spooky
stories or anecdotes about ghosts, yōkai, or mysterious
occurrences. After each brief tale, a lantern or candle
would be extinguished. At the end of the final story, the
room would be plunged into complete darkness. And then,
it was said (or hoped or feared), a real yōkai would appear.
Buddhist priest and author Asai Ryōi (d. 1691) explains, “It
is said that when you collect and tell one hundred stories of



scary or strange things that have been passed down since
long ago, something scary or strange is certain to occur.”22
The word hyaku-monogatari literally means “one
hundred stories,” but the number one hundred was not
necessarily taken literally. In fact, most hyaku-monogatari
collections include fewer than a hundred tales. In one
sense, the implication was simply that this was a very large
number.23 The particular number one hundred (hyaku),
however, also had symbolic implications for the mysterious.
As mentioned earlier, tsukumogami refers to inanimate
objects transformed into yōkai after reaching the magic age
of one hundred. Similarly, one hundred was often cited as
the age after which a normal fox, cat, or tanuki might turn
into a yōkai. One hundred seems to have signified a
transformative or liminal point—beyond the normal life
span of an object or living thing but not so high as to be
completely out of reach. One hundred was the number after
which things might get a little unusual. The practice of
hyaku-monogatari reflects this premise: after a certain
point—after the one hundredth story—you were in a space
in which the mundane and the normal could be
transcended.
Hyaku-monogatari supposedly got its start as a test of
bravery, a so-called kimo-dameshi, or “challenge of the
liver,” undertaken by samurai. Whether this is true or not,
by the early part of the Edo period hyaku-monogatari
gatherings seem to have become a popular form of
entertainment and a lively venue for the performance and



exchange of oral narratives. Some of these were based on
local legends, others were personal experiences or
memorates, some came from Chinese literature, and still
others may have been invented expressly for the game.24
Whatever the tales’ origins, however, as people publicly
shared and performed them, the images and attributes of
individual yōkai were enhanced and developed, and these
yōkai took on more concrete forms.
Given the vibrant literary and artistic world of the time,
it is also not surprising that publishers soon began to
gather and sell hyaku-monogatari collections.25 The
collections varied greatly in length and content. Some were
dedicated not to telling mysterious tales but to explaining
the reasons for such phenomena. This was the case most
famously with Kokon hyaku-monogatari hyōban of 1686,
which offered the interpretive wisdom, mostly based on yin
yang principles, of Yamaoka Genrin (1631–1672).
Although the oral practice of hyaku-monogatari started
to go out of vogue around the mid-1700s, publication of
written collections continued to flourish; in fact, the kaidan
form also became part of high literature, most notably with
the 1776 publication of Ueda Akinari’s Ugetsu monogatari
(Tales of Moonlight and Rain).26 Though not explicitly a
hyaku-monogatari text, this famous collection of nine
spooky tales (some based on Chinese stories) was
considered a masterpiece of beautiful writing and eerie
atmospherics and neatly reflected the popular fascination
with the weird.



Picturing Yōkai: Emaki
So far, I have focused primarily on written records of yōkai
and their subduers. But, particularly during the Muromachi
period, yōkai started to proliferate in visual form as well,
appearing primarily in emaki (picture scrolls or hand rolls):
long, horizontal rolls of paper or silk that could be unfurled
to show a series of events, often, though not always, with
accompanying text. Many otogizōshi, such as the one
concerning the tsuchigumo, were produced in this visual
form.
But it was the first known Hyakkiyagyō emaki that really
set the stage for a proliferation of yōkai illustrations. This
picture scroll by Tosa Mitsunobu, often called the
Shinjuanbon version, seems to have started (or at least
been an early part of) a veritable hyakkiyagyō “boom,” in
which all sorts of different yōkai were pictured in numerous
scrolls produced in a range of styles.27 In most cases,
these yōkai are portrayed with humor, a chaotic parade of
wacky characters. In fact, the hyakkiyagyō became a sort of
artistic genre that continued to be produced, often with
clear allusion to earlier versions, throughout the Edo
period and even into Meiji. The work of Kawanabe Kyōsai
(1831–1889) stands out in particular as a brilliant late
incarnation of this tradition.
Tosa Mitsunobu’s Shinjuanbon version of the
Hyakkiyagyō emaki does not tell a story as such, but the
final scene shows the yōkai scattering—so there is a hint of
a plot. A number of picture scrolls that were painted



slightly later, during the Edo period, do not even bother
with narrative at all; rather, they unroll to simply reveal
one yōkai after another, individually depicted, and each one
labeled with its name: rokurokubi, yuki-onna, ubume, and
so on. Both these facts—that the yōkai are shown
individually and that they are labeled—suggest that to a
certain extent these scrolls may have been made for the
purpose of recording information or perhaps even teaching,
akin to children’s books today. Unfortunately, we do not
know the objectives of the artists; but we can think of these
scrolls as an early artistic way of documenting yōkai,
whether intentionally or not—a kind of “natural history
record.”28
If we look at some of these scrolls, such as Bakemono
zukushi (artist unknown, date unknown) and Hyakkai-zukan
(Sawaki Sūshi, 1737), we notice that they are populated
with all sorts of yōkai; but in contrast to the Shinjuanbon
Hyakkiyagyō emaki, they do not feature any household
objects. These artists seem interested in documenting a
range of folk beliefs beyond the tsukumogami; this would
have included legends or descriptions they had heard about
yuki-onna, kappa, or other yōkai that thrived in rural
environments, as opposed to the urban settings where the
artists themselves lived. Perhaps tsukumogami—household
object yōkai—were a sort of urban-consumer-society yōkai,
whereas yuki-onna, kappa, and the others were more rural.
Or perhaps these scrolls represent a visual supplement to
some of the narratives recounted in hyaku-monogatari, an



illustration of creatures described in oral tale-telling
sessions. Although the number one hundred (hyaku) has
numerous implications, it also certainly links together
hyaku-monogatari and hyakkiyagyō, and it connects both to
notions of the otherworld.29 All this is speculative, but
whatever they were intended for, ultimately these emaki
demonstrate a taxonomic impulse to isolate and label the
individual yōkai in the hyakkiyagyō parade.
Documenting Yōkai: Encyclopedias
This interest in identifying and naming reflects a broader
zeitgeist, a kind of encyclopedic way of thinking about the
world. Even while picture scrolls and spooky tale
collections were produced and consumed as a form of
entertainment, the Edo period was also a time of serious
intellectual inquiry, informed especially by a strain of neo
Confucian philosophy known as Shushigaku. Based on the
philosophy of Zhu Xi (1130–1200), Shushigaku promoted
the “investigation of things” (kakubutsu chichi) in order to
understand the structure of nature and the proper order of
society; it was highly influential in intellectual and
government circles, leading to the importation of all sorts
of natural history texts and pharmacopoeias from China,
and also to research and writing about Japanese plants,
animals, and minerals (and all sorts of other things). One
product of this broad interest in just about everything was
a 105-volume encyclopedia called the Wakan-sansaizue (c.



1713; Japanese-Chinese collected illustrations of the three
realms; hereafter Three Realms) compiled by an Osaka
medical practitioner named Terajima Ryōan. The Three
Realms drew on earlier Chinese sources (and images),
especially a materia medica text called the Bencao gangmu
(Japanese: Honzō kōmoku), but also presented original
observations and indigenous Japanese learning.30
In certain sections of this massive compendium, yōkai
appear right alongside other animals. In “fish types,” for
example, there is a short entry for ningyo, or “mermaid,”
that includes a matter-of-fact description of the creature’s
appearance and also casually mentions the handy fact that
ningyo bones can be made into a poison with “wonderful
effect.”31 In another section there is an array of strange
beings all more or less anthropomorphic, including the
monkeylike enkō and witchlike yamauba. Most descriptions
include a straightforward presentation of physical
characteristics, habits, and habitats, and they refer back to
Chinese texts and earlier Japanese texts.
One of the entries, for the kawatarō (related to the
kappa), is notable because Terajima makes no effort to
connect it to previous Chinese sources; he simply includes
a picture of the creature (a hairy, monkeylike figure
walking upright) and explains that it likes to steal certain
vegetables, challenge people to wrestle sumō, and pull
cattle and horses into the water. In fact, one important
dimension of the Three Realms is that it cites versions of
yōkai from earlier texts, both Chinese and Japanese, but it



also references oral and local folklore. Because the Three
Realms is a serious academic work, written presumably for
a scholarly readership, the incorporation of local beliefs
like this helps to authenticate them as “facts” just as valid
as data extracted from older documents.
The Three Realms also places yōkai right next to other
creatures, such as rhinoceroses, that were not found in the
wild in Japan. In a way this makes absolute sense: to an
Edo-period reader in Japan, a rhinoceros would have been
just as real or just as fantastic (if not more so) as a
kawatarō or a ningyo. All these creatures fit neatly in a set
of books that aimed to document all things, whether seen
or unseen.
Toriyama Sekien and the Gazu Hyakkiyagyō series
During the first half of the Edo period, then, yōkai
appeared in the oral and written tales of hyaku-monogatari,
in playful picture scrolls, and also in serious academic
compendia such as the Three Realms. All these different
forms come together in the work of a man named Toriyama
Sekien (1712–1788), an artist who had the most significant
influence on how we envision and understand yōkai to this
day. Sekien was born in Edo and was a follower of the Kanō
school of painting. Not much is known about his life, but
there is speculation that he was a Buddhist priest and
possibly served the Tokugawa government.



Sekien is most remembered for his four sets of
illustrated catalogs, produced between 1776 and 1784, that
collectively document over two hundred different yōkai:
Gazu hyakkiyagyō (1776), Konjaku gazu zoku hyakki
(1779), Konjaku hyakki shūi (1781), Hyakki tsurezure
bukuro (1784).32 Both in form and content, these books
are a perfect combination of picture scroll and
encyclopedia. Some images are directly modeled on the
yōkai in the earlier picture scrolls, and in fact it has
recently been discovered that Sekien himself painted his
own version of a Hyakkiyagyō emaki.33 But what is most
significant about his illustrated catalogs is that they are not
picture scrolls. Like the Three Realms and other
encyclopedic texts of the day, they are bound in a fukuro
toji style with folded pages fastened with thread on one
side. In shape and style they are roughly similar to today’s
paperback books, and they are read in the same fashion, by
turning one page at a time.34
Each page of Sekien’s catalogs features a separate entry,
like you might find in an encyclopedia, with a black-and
white line drawing of an individual yōkai and sometimes a
description. The earliest set of catalogs, Gazu hyakkiyagyō,
contains three volumes and a total of fifty-one yōkai. There
is relatively little writing with each image; often the text
notes only a particular yōkai’s name and maybe a variant
name. The entry on kappa, for example, states, “Kappa,
also called Kawatarō.” It is likely that in this first catalog,
Sekien was drawing the best-known yōkai, those creatures



that were already so deeply entrenched in the popular
imagination that no explanation was necessary. In his later
catalogs, however, Sekien adds more text to the images. In
part, this may be because he is introducing less established
or regional yōkai, creatures that need some explanation.
But he also seems to be more playful in these later works,
filling both text and illustration with lively puns and image
play.
Sekien was creating a comprehensive yōkai bestiary, but
he also seems to have been having fun. And as he produced
additional catalog sets over the next few years, his writing
and his images became even more inventive. Some of his
yōkai were adapted from the Three Realms, some were
taken from picture scrolls, some from Chinese materials,
some from local belief and legend, and more than a few
were his own invention. According to one analysis of the
more than two hundred distinct creatures illustrated by
Sekien, most are derived from Japanese folklore, art, or
literature; fourteen come directly from Chinese sources;
and eighty-five may have been fabricated.35
Many common yōkai today may have started with Sekien,
but even if he did not invent them from whole cloth, he
certainly helped to popularize them. Through his books,
creatures from China became Japanese yōkai, and local
yōkai from all over Japan were presented to a mass
readership. A yōkai from one small corner of the country
might be combined with yōkai found in different regions, or



under different names, to make a sort of generic yōkai
shared by a larger, national folk group.
Today, the inventive aspect of Sekien’s work, along with
its wordplay and tongue-in-cheek quality, is difficult for
readers to appreciate. Recognized less for their humor and
levity, then, his catalogs are often treated as the
quintessential record of the yōkai world. Even in his own
day he influenced, either directly or indirectly, a number of
important artists. He taught Kitagawa Utamaro (1753
1806) and Utagawa Toyoharu (1735–1814); Utagawa would
become the founder of the Utagawa line of painters, which
included Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1797–1861), who in turn
taught Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1839–1892) and Kawanabe
Kyōsai (1831–1889).36 Although their styles varied, and
differed greatly from Sekien’s, all these artists would
eventually become known in part for portraying yōkai and
for illustrating supernatural narratives. Sekien’s own works
today are still referenced for their encyclopedic value, and
his images and descriptions continue to inspire numerous
contemporary manga artists and others.
Yōkai as Characters: Kibyōshi
By extracting yōkai from other texts and from local
legends, Sekien helped disconnect them from their
particular places of origin and from the narratives in which
they played a part. This made them more generic and more
versatile, employable in all sorts of new places. And in fact,



during the latter part of the Edo period, yōkai haunted
literature, art, and popular culture, everything from
woodblock prints to Kabuki to rakugo storytelling. They
especially thrived in a lighthearted genre of illustrated
books known as kibyōshi, or “yellow covers,” produced
mainly between 1775 and 1806. Kibyōshi were a kind of
kusazōshi (picture book), a popular form of comic book or
graphic literature that came in a variety of styles
including red books, black books, and blue books. As the
name implies, kibyōshi had yellow covers (actually they
started out blue-green but faded to yellow); a single
kibyōshi narrative might consist of two or three separate
volumes, each one only about ten pages long. Every page
contained a detailed line drawing, and the space around
the image was crammed with text—the books are often
thought of as an early-modern version of manga. Of all the
popular books of this time, the kibyōshi were considered
the most sophisticated and the most satiric. In fact, one
reason their production came to an end in 1806 may have
been because the authorities did not take kindly to their
critical humor.37
It was in part to facilitate this satire that kibyōshi drew
on yōkai as rich stock characters; a particular yōkai might
stand in for an individual, a whole class, or a particular
type of person. These texts, therefore, provide a glimpse
into the Edo-period popular imagination. An example of
how yōkai were used is Bakemono no yomeiri (The Monster
Takes a Bride, 1807), by Jippensha Ikku (1765–1831).



During the eighteenth century there were picture books
that depicted the marriage of two people (and the uniting
of their families) through careful illustrations of various
wedding rituals. Such books may have been simultaneously
entertaining and used as manuals for prospective brides.
The kibyōshi version parodies these books by adopting the
same format but portraying all the characters as yōkai,
with ritual behavior appropriate only to the yōkai world.
Tsukumogami-style lanterns, each hopping on a single leg,
help light the way, for example, and one yōkai remarks that
a storm is brewing—perfect weather for a wedding.38 It is
a comical portrayal without much of a plot to speak of. But
by showing human behavior through the topsy-turvy world
of yōkai, the author helps to defamiliarize, to make strange,
a whole range of wedding customs and social standards
that otherwise might go unquestioned.
For the most part, yōkai in kibyōshi were anything but
scary; they were goofy and comical, their language full of
puns and topical references. This was an urban genre with
a mass readership; like the encyclopedias and Sekien’s
catalogs, they must have spread a kind of shared
understanding about yōkai to people from all over Japan.
That is, they would have made distinctions between yōkai
from different regions less pronounced.
Another important effect of kibyōshi is that they
transformed yōkai into “characters.” Removed from its
connection to a particular legend or belief, a given yōkai
could become an iconic image—like an advertising mascot



—independent from text or tale. It was in the kibyōshi, for
example, that an eerily cute tofu-carrying urchin called
tōfu-kozō prospered, and where a romantic relationship
between long-necked mikoshi-nyūdō and long-necked
rokurokubi bloomed.39
I have only scratched the surface of the Edo-period
relationship with yōkai. The humorous and cute characters
of the kibyōshi were dynamic and innovative and became
memorable icons that still influence our image of yōkai
today. The last one hundred years of the Edo period also
witnessed a variety of other playful uses of yōkai: they
appeared in board games (sugoroku), shooting galleries,
spectacle shows (misemono), and even a popular card
game known as yōkai karuta, which is remarkably similar
to contemporary Pokémon.40
But these playful and ironic images of yōkai did not kill
off the frightening folk creatures from which they
developed. For example, the Kabuki play Tōkaidō Yotsuya
kaidan (1825) by Tsuruya Nanboku IV (1755–1829) thrilled
Edo audiences with its portrayal of the vengeful ghost of
Oiwa-san, a story based on “real” local ghost stories. It was
an exceedingly popular fictional entertainment—but in
order to avoid being cursed, the actors made sure to pay
respect to the grave of the real woman on whom the Oiwa
san character was based.41
Similarly, yōkai were still a subject of fascination for
intellectuals as well. Famous kokugaku (national studies)
scholar Hirata Atsutane (1776–1843), for example,



interviewed individuals who had been carried away by
tengu or had had other supernatural experiences. He
documented a report by a man who claimed to understand
the chatter of birds, and by another who could recall his
former life.42 Even as yōkai were the subject of fun and
games, they were also a matter for serious inquiry.
Atsutane’s investigations of the otherworld foreshadowed
the folkloric study of yōkai that would begin as Japan
started to modernize in the years to come.
MODERN DISCIPLINES
During the Meiji period (1868–1912), Japan began a
vigorous push toward what it called “civilization and
enlightenment” (bunmei kaika). In a short time, the nation
experienced rapid and momentous changes. The capital
was officially moved to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo.
Knowledge was actively sought from abroad by inviting
foreigners to come teach and by sending promising young
scholars to study in Europe and the United States.
Meanwhile, the educational system at home was revamped.
And so was the military, as the nation began a series of
wars and colonial incursions abroad (that would eventually
culminate in Japan’s involvement in World War II). Social
structures, such as the system that designated samurai as
an elite class, were abolished. And government policies to
rationalize and organize belief systems were implemented,
leading, for example, to the forced merger of local shrines



throughout the nation. In cultural circles, too, change was
rapid and radical, even on the level of language and
literature, as evidenced by the genbun’itchi movement that
strove to unite spoken and written Japanese.
Inoue Enryō and the Invention of Yōkaigaku
Within this radical restructuring of society and culture,
what happened to yōkai? Simply put, during the Meiji
period a number of Japanese scholars and ideologues,
under the influence of Western scientific knowledge and
attitudes, tried to demystify mysterious phenomena. In
particular, a charismatic Buddhist philosopher and
educator named Inoue Enryō (1858–1919) created the
discipline of yōkaigaku (yōkai-ology, or “monsterology”)
with the objective of rationally explaining away
supernatural beliefs so that Japan could become a modern
nation-state.43 Enryō himself was a dynamic character,
clearly a man on a mission, who was so obsessed with
collecting and explaining supernatural phenomena that he
was nicknamed Professor Yōkai (Yōkai Hakase).
Enryō (or Kishimaru, as he was known as a child) was
born in 1858 in Echigo (present-day Niigata Prefecture),
where his father was a Buddhist priest at a small temple. A
lot of energy was invested in young Kishimaru’s education;
he studied kangaku (Chinese learning) as well as Western
and Japanese natural history and sciences, a mixture that
would greatly influence his own philosophical interests and



the later development of yōkaigaku. He also trained in the
Buddhist priesthood, taking the name Enryō when he was
ordained.44
In 1881 Enryō entered the Department of Literature and
Philosophy at the University of Tokyo. He studied Chinese
and Indian philosophies along with Western philosophy,
particularly the work of Spencer, Hegel, and Kant. He also
took courses in various sciences, history, and literature and
was a founding member of the Tetsugakkai (Society of
Philosophy), an organization that is still active today. When
Enryō completed his degree in 1885, he was the first
Buddhist priest to graduate from the university and the
first graduate to specialize in philosophy.45
Enryō believed that by drawing on Western philosophy,
Buddhism could be modernized and reformed. He also felt
it was important for people from all walks of life—not just
those with the chance to study at the University of Tokyo
to be exposed to Western philosophy. And with these
objectives, he founded his own academy; opened in 1887
and called Tetsugakkan, the school would eventually
develop into Tōyō University, which today has over thirty
thousand students.
Clearly Enryō was passionate about philosophy,
Buddhism, and education. So maybe it is not surprising that
he also had an abiding interest in getting to the bottom of
the mysteries of the world around him, such as yōkai, and a
deep desire to tell people of his discoveries. Even in 1886,
as plans were taking shape for Tetsugakkan, Enryō and



some friends formed an organization called the Fushigi
kenkyūkai, literally the Mystery Research Society. The
group seems to have been inspired by the British Society
for Psychical Research, which itself had been founded in
1882—and is still active today.46 The Mystery Research
Society actually met only three times, but Enryō had
already embarked on his yōkai research, publishing an
appeal for information on “strange dreams, ghosts, kitsune
and tanuki, tengu, inugami, shamanism, possession,
physiognomy, prophecy, etc.,” in order to analyze such
phenomena from a psychological perspective and “consider
and report on the facts of yōkai from each region.”47
Throughout his life, Enryō traveled around Japan
lecturing about yōkai and collecting information on beliefs
and customs. Additionally, he seems to have created a
network of likeminded colleagues and followers throughout
the country who would keep him informed about local yōkai
in their regions. Before his death (while lecturing in China)
in 1919, Enryō wrote thousands of pages on the subject.
His early magnum opus, Yōkaigaku kōgi (Lectures on
yōkaigaku), was first published in 1893–1894 and is over
two thousand pages long. He explains that this new
academic discipline, “yōkaigaku,” is a form of
enlightenment every bit as profound as all the modern
technologies that were changing Japan: “If through this
[discipline of yōkaigaku], the light of a new heaven opens
inside the hearts of the citizens, then is it too much to say
that these achievements are just as important as the



installation of railroads and telegraphs? Herein lies the
necessity of the research and explanations of
yōkaigaku.”48
At first glance it seems that Enryō insisted that
mysterious phenomena could not exist, that science and
psychology could ultimately explain everything. But his
thinking was actually more subtle than this, and his
categorization of strange phenomena was complex. He
divided yōkai into two broad categories: kakai (false or
provisional mystery) and shinkai (true mystery). His goal
was not to dismiss all mystery but to systematically filter
out meishin (superstitions), gokai (mistaken mystery), gikai
(artificial mystery), and all sorts of other false mysteries
that were deceiving the Japanese people and inhibiting
their enlightenment. After all the false mysteries had been
weeded out, one would be able to identify “true mystery.”
The ultimate goal of Enryō’s yōkaigaku was to locate this
true mystery, the shinkai: the secret thing at the core of
existence.
In service of this objective, Enryō collected massive
amounts of data on yōkai from all over the country. Despite
his expressed desire to debunk mysterious creatures and
phenomena, he certainly seems to have enjoyed telling
people about them. It was through his work as a public
intellectual, who lectured continuously and wrote
numerous newspaper articles, that the word yōkai became
part of the popular vocabulary. And the mountain of data



Enryō collected still provides invaluable information for
scholars today.
Lafcadio Hearn and Spooky Translation
In 1891, when Inoue Enryō was in his early thirties and
already deeply immersed in his yōkai research, he traveled
to the small city of Matsue in Shimane Prefecture. There he
spent the morning of May 30 engrossed in conversation
with a forty-year-old English teacher recently arrived from
America.49 There is no record of what the two discussed,
so we cannot know if they talked about yōkai. But it is
certainly intriguing that the two men actually met: the
English teacher, Lafcadio Hearn (1850–1904), would go on
to become one of the most important foreign-language
interpreters of Japanese culture. Among other things, he
would write extensively on the supernatural, folklore,
religion, and yōkai. Perhaps most famous among his many
works is a book called Kwaidan, an early, romanized
rendering of the word we have already seen as kaidan, or
“spooky tales.” Although Hearn’s contribution to the
understanding of yōkai is rarely noted in books on the
subject, it is important to include this enigmatic Greek
Irish-American-Japanese writer here as a key figure in the
modern history of yōkai studies. Not only did he eloquently
record some important narratives, but also his passion for
the strange and supernatural, and the deeper cultural



insights they could provide, prefigured the work of
Japanese scholars who would come after him.
Hearn led a complex life. He was born in 1850 on the
Greek island of Lafkada (hence the name), the second child
of a passionate affair between an Irish officer in the British
Army and a local Greek woman. Several months later, his
father was transferred to the West Indies, and his mother
took baby Patrick Lafcadio Hearn to Ireland. She returned
to Greece after two years, leaving the boy with a wealthy
great aunt (on the Hearn side). In his teens, young Paddy
was sent to a Catholic boarding school in England. In an
accident at school, his left eye was blinded and slightly
disfigured (it is in order to hide this disfigurement that
Hearn is always turned to the side in photographs).
Meanwhile, his great aunt lost her fortune, and the family
fell into poverty.
When he was nineteen, Paddy went off to America and
ended up in Cincinnati, where he quickly managed to
become a successful newspaper journalist. He especially
made a name for himself reporting on the seamier side of
life—murders, slaughterhouses, garbage dumps,
corruption, and the poor districts of the city. In his
twenties, he moved to New Orleans, where he continued
his successful journalism career, but this time dropping the
“Patrick” in favor of his more exotic-sounding middle name,
“Lafcadio.” He wrote a novel, Chita, and received a
commission to travel to the West Indies (especially
Martinique), where he wrote another novel as well as a



successful collection of nonfiction essays titled Two Years in
the French West Indies. In all these places, Hearn—with his
awkward appearance, his one good eye, his restless spirit,
and an abiding interest in folklore, religion, and occult
practices—always lived on the edge of the mainstream but
wrote about people and places and his own experiences in
a thoughtful, accessible prose style.
In 1890, Hearn was commissioned to travel to Japan. The
changes of the Meiji period were rapid and revolutionary,
and he found himself profoundly interested in both the
disappearing ways of the old Japan and the new emerging
culture. In his first year in the country, while teaching
English in Matsue, he married a woman named Koizumi
Setsu. When he became a Japanese citizen in 1896, he
changed his own name to Koizumi Yakumo, taking the
family name Koizumi from his wife. Yakumo literally means
“eight clouds” and can be understood more as “abundant
clouds,” or possibly “sacred clouds.” It is the first line of
the earliest known Japanese poem, appearing in the same
passage of the Kojiki in which Susa-no-O slays the Yamata
no Orochi, and it is also a poetic reference to Izumo, near
Matsue, where Hearn met his wife.
Hearn subsequently lived in Kumamoto City for three
years, went to Kobe to work as a journalist again, and then
moved on to Tokyo to take a position as professor of
English literature at Tokyo Imperial University. Until his
death of a heart condition in 1904, he published numerous
books and essays on Japan, creating a body of work that,



according to one biographer, “is among the best ever
written on that country, and is of continuing relevance.”50
Hearn was a master of the essay form and wrote about
everything from Buddhism to proverbs to incense to insects
(he loved insects: ants, crickets, silkworms, and even
mosquitoes). He also had a deep interest in spooky tales,
and much of his work includes translated or rewritten
versions of legends and literary ghost stories. Even his
book titles, such as Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan (1894), In
Ghostly Japan (1899), and Shadowings (1900), reflect this
interest in the otherworld. Published in 1904, the year of
his death, Kwaidan is particularly full of spooky stories and
includes such yōkai as rokurokubi, mujina, and yuki-onna.
Hearn probably never mastered Japanese well enough to
collect and translate these tales by himself. In his early
years in the country, he relied on a translator or his wife to
collect stories orally, and in later years he would carefully
work through written texts, retelling them in his clear
English prose.51 While his interests tended toward local
legends, folktales, and beliefs, ultimately Hearn was not an
ethnographer but a creative writer; his objective was not to
scientifically record narratives but to re-create them in a
literary format. And perhaps his skillful prose is one reason
many of these stories, particularly the ones in Kwaidan, are
still well known in Japan today, and still readily available in
translation more than a century after they were written.52
Hearn’s importance to the history of yōkai studies is
twofold. First, he put great value on certain aspects of



Japanese culture—yōkai and kaidan—at the very moment
Enryō and others were working to banish them as
incompatible with modernity. In some cases, his embrace of
everything “traditional” could be problematically
nationalist, especially as Japan was in the process of
building its military and embarking on colonialist invasions.
In fact, the publisher’s introduction to Kwaidan notes that
even as the book appeared, Japan and Russia were at war,
and the publication of the volume “happens, by delicate
irony, to fall in the very month when the world is waiting
with tense expectation for news of the latest exploits of
Japanese battleships.”53 In the Japanese context of
modernization and Westernization, Hearn’s interest in the
strange and overlooked aspects of Japanese culture was
particularly meaningful: in part because he was a
respected teacher from abroad, his recognition of the value
of yōkai traditions brought them new attention and
reconsideration. It also helped that he was a good
storyteller, and that his skillful retellings were soon
translated back into Japanese, where they “became a much
loved part of the modern literary canon, familiar to every
schoolchild.”54
Secondly, Hearn was a romantic and a nostalgic. Unlike
Inoue Enryō, he did not dismiss yōkai as impediments to
progress; he celebrated them as an intrinsic and
meaningful part of Japanese culture—a culture that he saw
changing in front of his very eyes. He felt there was value
in collecting and understanding them for the insight they



might offer into fading beliefs and shifting worldviews and
what it means (or meant) to be Japanese. This attitude
prefigured the approaches that would be taken by a
number of important Japanese scholars in subsequent
years.
Ema Tsutomu and the Changing History of Yōkai
One of these scholars, Ema Tsutomu (1884–1979), wrote a
book called Nihon yōkai-henge shi (Japanese history of
yōkai-henge) in 1923. Ema was not an expert on yōkai, but
he was the leading scholar of a field called fūzokushi-gaku,
which was concerned with the history of customs and
manners. Ema recognized the importance of yōkai in
shaping and reflecting the broader history of the Japanese
people. He was not interested in documenting yōkai in
order to debunk them; rather, his objective was to “look at
how humans interacted with them in the past[,] . . . the way
our ancestors saw yōkai-henge, how they understood them,
and how they dealt with them.”55
Ema’s point is that yōkai, whether you believe in them or
not, have always been part of the human world and,
therefore, have to be taken seriously. His own analysis
examines a range of sources (including many of those
already mentioned) and divides the history of Japan into
several different epochs. One of his arguments is that there
is a distinction between yōkai and henge. Henge was
sometimes used interchangeably with yōkai, but Ema



suggests that the two words have different emphases, with
henge being more closely associated with the notion of
changeability. “If I were to give the definitions of both
words,” he explains, “I would say yōkai is an ungraspable
mysterious nondescript, whereas henge is something that
has externally changed its identity.”56
Ema creates a complicated typology of both yōkai and
henge, classifying them by their ability to shape-shift, by
the forms they generally take, and by when and where they
appear. Most of them, he says, emerge in the evening and,
depending on particular type, may inhabit mountains,
shrines, houses, or the ocean. Although he finds mysterious
creatures to be important during all periods of Japanese
history—“since the beginning of time in Japan, our
ancestors have had a close relationship with yōkai-henge”
he also suggests that attitudes changed with the Meiji
period. Whereas in the past people were afraid of yōkai, he
explains, now yōkai are afraid of humans.57
Ema’s distinction between yōkai and henge, his specific
typology, and his historical analysis do not seem to have
greatly influenced subsequent scholars. But his general
attitude toward yōkai is significant: for Ema, yōkai are
encoded with critical data from the cultures and times in
which they thrived, and they can tell us about the values
and beliefs of the people who created them. Unlike Inoue
Enryō, Ema did not worry about whether yōkai exist or not.
And in distinction to Lafcadio Hearn, he did not set out to
salvage them or cherish the eerie aesthetics of yōkai



narratives. Rather, he simply argued that yōkai are an
integral part of Japanese history, and therefore we should
study them.
Yanagita Kunio and the Folkloristics of Yōkai
This general attitude is paralleled in the cultural approach
assumed by Yanagita Kunio (1875–1962). Yanagita was one
of modern Japan’s most influential thinkers, best known as
the founder of minzokugaku, an academic study
translatable into English as “folklore studies,” “native
ethnology,” or “Japanese folkloristics.” Largely because of
Yanagita’s own interests, even today minzokugaku is the
academic discipline in Japan most closely associated with
the study of yōkai.
Yanagita himself began exploring yōkai early in his
career. His most famous book, Tōno monogatari (Tales of
Tōno), contains several references to kappa and zashiki
warashi, for example, and recounts a number of ghostly
occurrences. He would go on to write about yōkai in
numerous short essays, often as part of his exploration of
other issues and themes. For Yanagita, research into yōkai
represented a way to think broadly about Japanese folklore
and folklife. Although he never devised an explicit
methodology for interpreting yōkai, we can extract three
general theoretical directions from his essays: (1) an
acceptance of ambiguity, (2) collection and categorization,
and (3) a theory of degradation.58



The “acceptance of ambiguity” means that Yanagita was
not concerned about whether yōkai actually exist or not;
like Ema, he figured that if people believed in their
existence or told stories about them at some point, we
should study them. Generally speaking, this attitude is now
a given in folklore studies, in Japan and elsewhere, in
which belief systems are not refuted but observed and
interpreted. During the early twentieth century, however,
Yanagita’s promotion of this approach stood in distinct
contrast to Enryō’s method and set the tone for future
studies of yōkai and, more generally, for the development of
Japanese folkloristics as a discipline that sought to explain
the interiority of people’s lives.
As we have seen, “collection and categorization” of yōkai
started at least as early as the Edo period, so Yanagita’s
interest here was nothing new. Yanagita’s own collection of
data on yōkai entailed fieldwork (talking with people in
various regions) as well as scouring documents and other
written sources. In many essays, he provides examples of
yōkai and reasserts the need for further collection. Over
several months in 1938 and 1939 he published a glossary of
yōkai called “Yōkai meii” (Yōkai glossary) listing seventy
nine different yōkai. Most of the information was garnered
from local gazetteers and folklore collections; each entry
contains a short description of the yōkai in question.59
Yanagita’s most notorious contribution to the
classification of yōkai is his distinction between yūrei
(ghosts) and bakemono (or obake), introduced earlier. In



short, he claims that bakemono “generally appear in set
locations,” haunting a particular place, in contrast to yūrei,
which haunt a particular person. Yūrei come out only late
at night, but bakemono prefer the “dim light of dusk or
dawn,” finding this border zone between light and dark the
most productive for their purposes: “In order for people to
see them, and be frightened by them, emerging in the pitch
darkness after even the plants have fallen asleep is, to say
the least, just not good business practice.” Although many
people have found exceptions to his rules, Yanagita’s
distinctions here are often cited in books about yōkai and
have been important in stimulating conversation on the
topic.60
The third aspect of Yanagita’s approach to yōkai is his
“theory of degradation.” In 1917 Yanagita wrote, “When old
beliefs were oppressed and made to surrender to new
beliefs, all the [old] deities [kami-sama] were degraded
[reiraku] and became yōkai. That is to say, yōkai are
unauthorized deities.”61 His point is that yōkai were deities
who had fallen in status; they were no longer sacred but
still possessed some of their old supernatural powers.
Yanagita repeated this idea in a number of different essays
throughout his career, using the devolution of yōkai for
measuring the evolution of humans. As human beings
progress and move into a modern way of life, he suggested,
supernatural beings gradually degenerate from kami,
objects of serious belief, to yōkai, which are sometimes
even comical. To a certain extent, this attitude reflects



Yanagita’s general approach to folklore and history; he saw
many present customs as “survivals,” or relics, of an older,
bigger system of belief that had faded over time and was
disappearing even more rapidly with the changes of the
twentieth century.
Yanagita’s attitude toward yōkai, and to the beliefs of the
“folk,” continues to influence scholars and writers today. As
with other aspects of daily life that would become the
subject of his folkloristics, Yanagita understood that it was
not up to researchers to decide whether yōkai had an
objective existence or not; if yōkai were part of the life of
the people, then they existed as a meaningful and real part
of Japanese culture and they should be studied as such.62
By taking yōkai seriously and giving them an important (if
not central) role in the development of an entirely new
academic discipline, Yanagita signaled to generations that
followed that any study of culture could not ignore its
monsters.
POSTWAR ANIMATION AND THE YŌKAI BOOM
Animating Nostalgia: Mizuki Shigeru
Yanagita recorded yōkai as a critical part of the Japanese
cultural imagination even as the nation was embarking on
the terrible calamity of the Fifteen-Year War (1931
1945).63 During the second half of the twentieth century,
while Japan recovered from the devastation of war and



entered a period of rapid economic expansion and
industrial growth, yōkai took on yet another meaningful
role. Yanagita had collected them as relics from a
disappearing Japan; now they became infused with
nostalgia as icons from a more innocent, prewar Japan that
had already disappeared.
The individual most responsible for making yōkai
relevant during this period was the manga and anime artist
Mizuki Shigeru (b. 1922). Unlike Yanagita, Mizuki is not
generally characterized as a scholar; he is a creative
illustrator and storyteller who skillfully mixes history and
folklore with invention and imagination to produce
compelling narratives and memorable characters. Mizuki
was deeply influenced by Yanagita, Sekien, and other
scholars and artists who came before him, but ultimately it
is Mizuki’s manga and anime that most transformed the
elusive yōkai of folklore into the concrete yōkai characters
of contemporary popular culture and mass media.
Mizuki’s most significant manga series, which has been
around for half a century now, is called Gegege no Kitarō
(Spooky Kitarō); not only are the characters from this
series famous throughout Japan today but also Mizuki
himself is a well-known personality. In 2008, his wife, Mura
Nunoe (b. 1932), published an autobiographical account of
their life together called Gegege no nyōbo (Wife of
Gegege), which was made into a successful morning
television series in 2010 and a feature-length movie (dir.
Suzuki Takuji). Since the 1990s, Mizuki’s rural hometown



of Sakaiminato in Tottori Prefecture has been developed as
a tourist attraction featuring a museum dedicated to
Mizuki’s work, along with the Mizuki Shigeru Road, a
shopping street lined with more than 130 bronze yōkai
figures. In short, Mizuki is a nationally known personality,
and his yōkai characters animate contemporary Japan.
Mizuki was born Mura Shigeru in 1922. Although his
family was from Sakaiminato, he was actually born in the
city of Osaka, where his father was working, and moved to
Sakaiminato with his mother one month later.64 He has
written nostalgically of his childhood in this small port
town, and particularly about an old woman named
Nonnonbā (Granny Nonnon) who looked after him when his
parents were busy. According to Mizuki’s memoirs,
Nonnonbā was knowledgeable about the yōkai world, and it
was through her that he was first trained in the mysterious
things residing around him.
Mizuki came of age during World War II and saw combat
with the Japanese infantry near Rabaul in Papua New
Guinea, where he lost his left arm. He has written movingly
of his time in the military, of his struggles as a bumbling
soldier and of his near-death through injury and illness in
the tropics. While he seems to have despised most of his
superior officers, he portrays the natives of Rabaul with
great affection, as true friends who cared for him when he
was ill and suffering.
After returning to Japan, Mizuki studied at Musashino
Art School and worked as an illustrator for kamishibai



(picture-card shows) from 1950 to 1957; between 1957 and
1965, he wrote and illustrated kashi-hon manga, cheaply
produced manga available for a small rental fee at shops
throughout Japan.65 His first critical success came with the
1965 magazine publication of “Terebi-kun” (Television boy),
the story of a boy who enters into televisions to participate
in the world beyond the screen. “Terebi-kun” received the
Sixth Kōdansha Jidō Manga Award and propelled Mizuki
into the more lucrative world of magazine manga
publishing.66
It was as a kamishibai artist in 1954 that he first created
Kitarō, the charming boy yōkai who would become his
signature character. The original production was called
Hakaba Kitarō (Graveyard Kitarō), a title that Mizuki
retained, with small variations, until his successful 1968
series, Hakaba no Kitarō (Kitarō of the graveyard), was to
be made into an anime for television. The sponsors of the
television version were concerned that having graveyard in
the title would not be good for business, so Mizuki changed
it to Gegege no Kitarō, a title derived from his own
nickname as a child—Gege, or Gegeru (a mispronunciation
of Shigeru).67 Gegege no Kitarō became the title of the
anime first and, subsequently, the title of the manga; in a
sense this moment also marks the invasion of the postwar
Japanese media world by Mizuki’s yōkai.
The black-and-white anime ran until 1969, followed by
successive series in color: 1971–1972, 1985–1988, 1996
1998, and 2007–2009. There have also been a live action



film (2007; dir. Motoki Katsuhide), video games, and even a
new TV anime series based on an early version of Hakaba
Kitarō. Through this skillful promulgation in a wide range
of media, Mizuki’s distinctive yōkai characters have
become part of the popular imagination of children and
adults in late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century
Japan.
Because of this dynamic media mix, and with so many
different episodes and versions, Gegege no Kitarō
narratives cannot be summarized concisely, but they
generally involve the adventures of Kitarō and a cohort of
yōkai friends. Kitarō himself is the progeny of a ghost
family: an otherwise normal-looking boy, he wears magic
geta sandals and a protective black-and-yellow chanchanko
vest, and there is always a shock of hair covering the left
side of his face. Kitarō is written with the character for oni
(ki), a not-so-subtle reminder of his origins and affiliations.
Kitarō is frequently accompanied by another character,
Medama-oyaji (Papa Eyeball), a disembodied eyeball with
arms, legs, and squeaky voice (even though he has no
mouth), who represents the remains of Kitarō’s dead father
and is often pictured perched on Kitarō’s head or
shoulder.68 Many of the episodes in the series involve
Kitarō, Medama-oyaji, and other regular yōkai characters
teaming up to fight for the survival of good yōkai and good
humans against evil yōkai and evil humans. Mizuki also
celebrates the ambiguous nature of yōkai; one of the other
regular characters, for example, is the ne’er-do-well



Nezumi-otoko (Ratman), a mischievous trickster figure who
is both friend and foe of the boy hero.
Kitarō, Medama-oyaji, and Nezumi-otoko are Mizuki’s
original creations. But Mizuki is also a scholar of yōkai
folklore and history, and many of his characters are
adapted from the work of Sekien, Yanagita, and others. For
example, one famous character in Kitarō’s yōkai gang is
Nurikabe, or “Plaster Wall,” mentioned earlier, which
Mizuki extracted directly from an entry in Yanagita’s “Yōkai
Glossary.” By illustrating a wall with arms, legs, and eyes,
he transforms what Yanagita described as a vague
phenomenon into a solid, free-standing character. Similarly,
Sunakake-babā, the Sand-Throwing Granny, was also a
relatively obscure yōkai whom Mizuki lifted from “Yōkai
Glossary” and made into a star.
Mizuki’s narratives are full of other yōkai mined from
folklore and previous texts. Moreover, in addition to his
narrative manga, he has also published numerous
illustrated catalogs consciously reminiscent of the Edo
period bestiaries of Toriyama Sekien. Indeed, in many ways
Mizuki might be considered a modern-day Sekien, using
the popular media of his day not only to document yōkai
but also to invent new ones. And just as Sekien’s
eighteenth-century images exerted enormous influence on
the understanding of yōkai in succeeding years, so Mizuki’s
images powerfully shape the popular imagination of
contemporary Japan. Although Mizuki has published many
other yōkai-related manga, such as Kappa no Sanpei



(Sanpei the kappa) and Akuma-kun (Devil boy), he is still
most famous for Gegege no Kitarō: the manga, the
numerous anime series, and all sorts of spin-off goods and
products, from key chains and cell phone straps, to plastic
figurines, clothing, and even canned coffee.
Mizuki’s hometown of Sakaiminato, with its yōkai statues
and Mizuki museum, has become a Mecca for yōkai lovers
from all over the country—tens of thousands visit each
year. You can find tourists of all ages clustered next to each
small bronze statue along Mizuki Shigeru Road.
Grandparents stoop to carefully read the engraved
nameplate, parents chat nostalgically, and children
excitedly shout out the name of each yōkai character the
moment they recognize it. For children in particular, these
yōkai are contemporary celebrities, stars of TV and film and
video games. For older visitors, they inspire nostalgic
memories of their own childhoods—when they heard tales
of yōkai, perhaps, or more likely when they first
encountered Mizuki’s manga and anime. Recalling his own
excitement when visiting the road, eclectic writer and
scholar Aramata Hiroshi (b. 1947) explained, “Even if my
head has been corrupted by old books and cigarettes, my
heart, it seems, is still a child’s.”69
In fact, this is the power of Mizuki’s yōkai—they emit a
potent nostalgia for a time that is now gone (if it ever
existed in the first place). Yōkai narratives and beliefs may
have been extracted from village life, debunked by Inoue
Enryō, or put into the pages of library books by Yanagita



Kunio, but Mizuki’s work makes them seem alive again.
And as living characters in his manga and anime, they re
create a lost time when they were also alive in everyday life
—or at least, in an imagined everyday life of the past, one
that is created by the longings of everyday life in the
present.
There is no denying the real sense of nostalgia invoked
by his characters, but we should remember that Mizuki
himself and his production company (Mizuki Production)
are also extremely skilled at using media to promote his
creations. Many of Mizuki’s yōkai characters may have
folkloric precedents, but they are ultimately a distinctive
brand, trademarked, copyrighted, and marketed with great
skill. Mizuki is a documenter of yōkai but also a producer
and popularizer of his own yōkai vision. In contemporary
Japan, his images are so deeply ingrained in popular
culture that you would be hard-pressed to find a child or
adult unfamiliar with them. It is likely that without Mizuki’s
prolific work over the last half a century, many older yōkai
of folklore would have been forgotten or relegated to
library books and museum shelves. So even as he inflects
them with his own particular spin, Mizuki has kept these
creatures alive in the cultural imagination.
Urbanizing Yōkai: Miyata Noboru
Just as Mizuki, a creative artist, was in part inspired by
Yanagita’s work on yōkai, so too were professional scholars,



especially those affiliated with Yanagita’s own discipline of
folkloristics. For the most part these researchers adhered
to Yanagita’s theoretical framework. But in 1985, a
folklorist named Miyata Noboru (1936–2000) published a
book titled Yōkai no minzokugaku (The folklore of yōkai),
which used the concepts of borders (kyōkai) and the city
(toshi) as “keys to break open the deadlock.”70 This new
perspective was important because it helped rescue
folkloric yōkai from being written off as nostalgic rural
icons from the past, and brought them into contemporary
culture so they could be understood once more as an
aspect of the lived experiences of real people.
For example, in discussing the Kuchi-sake-onna, the
female yōkai protagonist of urban legends that had
circulated wildly throughout Japan in 1979, Miyata links
her appearance in modern urban and suburban settings to
earlier, more rural yōkai, such as yamamba, a mountain
dwelling witchlike woman (sometimes called yamauba). He
demonstrates continuity not just with the image of the
yōkai itself but also with emotional, geographic, and social
factors that give birth to yōkai. Similarly, he seeks to
connect random urban crimes that were occurring in Tokyo
to the Edo-period yōkai phenomenon known as kamikiri
(hair-cutter), in which a person would suddenly discover
that her hair had been sheared off.
Miyata’s focus on place (“the topology of yōkai,” as he
puts it) also builds on earlier suggestions by Yanagita that
yōkai haunt the borderlands. But Miyata pushes these ideas



further, exploring examples of strange occurrence at
crossroads, on bridges, and in the no-man’s-land outside
the safe space of everyday life. The city, of course, is filled
with these uneasy, dangerous places that belong to nobody.
In effect, Miyata developed a field of urban folklore studies
that does not deny connections to the past or to rural
areas, but which also recognizes that “folklore involving
mysterious phenomena is constantly being exchanged
within the glittering spaces of large modern urban
centers.”71
A New Yōkaigaku: Komatsu Kazuhiko
At the same time Miyata was exploring strange phenomena
in the city, folklorist and anthropologist Komatsu Kazuhiko
(b. 1947) was beginning to develop a new yōkaigaku. Like
Miyata, Komatsu observed the way in which borders played
a role in determining who was human and who was an
outsider. In a seminal 1985 book titled Ijin-ron (Theories of
the stranger), he examines so-called ijin-goroshi (stranger
killing) legends, in which a wandering beggar or mendicant
priest is murdered while passing through a village.
Sometimes, through the phenomenon of communal illusion
(kyōdō gensō), the crime is hidden under a thick layer of
legends—often concerning yōkai and yūrei. Although this
book does not focus on yōkai per se, in the last chapter
Komatsu looks toward a new theory that would explore
links between yōkai and concepts of otherness, suggesting



that sometimes yōkai can be interpreted as folkloricized
versions of outsiders (including outcastes/outcasts).72
Whether this social model of yōkai actually represents
the beginnings of a new yōkai theory or simply a new
perspective on previous approaches, it signaled Komatsu’s
own deepening interest in exploring yōkai in fresh ways.
One of his important early contributions, for example,
revisits the difference between yōkai and kami. He updates
Yanagita’s “degradation theory” by stressing the fact that
both yōkai and kami possess supernatural powers. What
determines whether they are kami or yōkai is whether or
not humans worship them—so the movement can go both
ways, from kami to yōkai or from yōkai to kami, depending
on the needs of the society in question. To understand
yōkai, then, you have to understand the people for whom
they are important, and this requires a broad,
multidisciplinary, humanistic approach.
Komatsu presents these ideas as part of a reevaluation of
yōkai studies in his 1994 book, Yōkaigaku shinkō (New
thoughts on yōkaigaku); more than a century after Inoue
Enryō coined the term, Komatsu proposes a new yōkai
ology:
The new yōkaigaku is a discipline that researches the yōkai that humans
imagine (create), that is, yōkai as cultural phenomena. Just as with animals,
plants, and minerals, the form and attributes of yōkai existence cannot be
studied without considering their relationship with human beings; they
always reside within this relationship with humans, within the world of
human imagination. Accordingly, the study of yōkai is nothing other than the
study of the people who have engendered yōkai. In short, yōkaigaku is “yōkai
culture studies [yōkai bunka-gaku],” a “human-ology [ningengaku]” that



seeks to comprehend human beings through yōkai.73
As part of developing this new yōkaigaku, Komatsu
under the auspices of the International Research Center for
Japanese Studies (known as Nichibunken), a national
research institute located in Kyoto—organized a series of
interdisciplinary research workshops to study yōkai from a
variety of perspectives. Participants included scholars of
literature, folklore, history, art, anthropology, sociology, and
religion, as well as museum curators, photographers, and
novelists. All together, these various workshops met some
sixty-two times from 1997 to 2013, leading to the
publication of dozens of books and articles and the creation
of three public databases of yōkai research material and
images through an ongoing “yōkai project.”
Komatsu himself first became interested in yōkai in
graduate school while exploring setsuwa and picture scrolls
in which references were made to mono-no-ke, spirit
possession, Onmyōdō, and shugendō (aesthetic religious)
practices for warding off demons and illness. He also
learned about a community in the mountains of the island
of Shikoku that still practiced rituals of this nature as part
of a religious system called Izanagi-ryū.74 During his initial
fieldwork in that community, he felt a sense of strangeness,
as if he were simultaneously in the Heian period and the
present. So his initial interest in yōkai was spurred by this
exciting mixture of past and present, and methodologically
he felt it was important to combine archival and historical



research with ethnographic fieldwork. He felt there was a
conception of something between what is visible and what
is invisible that played a distinctive role in Japanese culture
and could not easily be classified under a particular
academic subject heading; this “mystical thinking” (shimpi
shisō) spanned literature, art, history, and religion and was
part of people’s everyday lives. His classification of yōkai,
then, is purposely inclusive and “provisional” in order to
encompass the “complexity” of the way yōkai are written
about, spoken about, and illustrated.
He suggests that what we find surprising about yōkai
should not be surprising—those things that seem strange to
us now can be understood through carefully examining the
ideas and practices of the past and tracing how things
came to be the way they are. That is, yōkai are a window
into something else—into popular thought and Japanese
culture. Ultimately, Komatsu stresses, defining yōkai is not
important; rather, we should learn to read through the
“yōkai-ish thing,” using it as a lens with which to explore
“what is on the other side,” the “message” of the text or
belief in which yōkai appear. This is a way for people to get
a deeper grasp of Japanese culture—and to achieve a
different perspective on their own culture, whether
Japanese or Western.75
Komatsu and many of the other people involved in the
study of yōkai produce work that is highly accessible and
well read by the general public. In fact, Komatsu purposely
chooses to write some of his texts so that they can be



understood by high-school-age readers.76 Any major
bookstore in Japan today has a few shelves devoted to
Japanese folklore, and there is usually a subsection
specifically dedicated to yōkai. Sometimes there is even a
smaller subsection devoted to Komatsu’s writing and edited
volumes.
In 2012, Komatsu became director of the International
Research Center for Japanese Studies. In one sense, his
appointment to the helm of a major government-funded
research center suggests that yōkai are no longer a
marginalized topic of study; their value for understanding
Japanese culture is, as it were, authorized by the
government. On the other hand, the fact that their value for
understanding “Japanese culture” has been authorized in
this way places them at the center of sometimes
problematic discussions of what it means to be Japanese.
Nichibunken itself was established in the 1980s under the
directorship of Umehara Takeshi (b. 1925), a philosopher
notorious for his Japan-first “nativist” ideology, and
Nichibunken has sometimes been accused of promoting
Nihonjinron, discourses on the uniqueness of Japan.77
A great deal has changed since Umehara’s tenure, and
the research institute has come to be known for its
interdisciplinary scholars and for hosting foreign
researchers, many of whom come from other Asian
countries, such as China, Korea, and Vietnam. Komatsu’s
own research, and the work of his yōkai workshops, is
never explicitly nationalist. Having acknowledged that,



however, we should remember that the study of yōkai,
because it is so deeply intertwined with discourses of
Japanese history and culture, and because it has now been
“sanctioned” by the government, can easily slip into
commentary on the uniqueness of Japan. Particularly as
they become recognized in other countries as a distinct
product of Japanese culture, yōkai are dangerously poised
to be part of essentialist or orientalist discussions about
“weird,” “wacky,” or “inscrutable” Japan. And that is why,
hopefully, the serious study of yōkai can get us beyond such
positions—by understanding where they come from, we can
see that yōkai are not, after all, so surprising.
As I have suggested from the outset, Japanese yōkai are
specific to Japan—that is, they are molded by the particular
history and culture of the group of islands that is now
called “Nihon” (Japan). To be sure, then, yōkai do tell us
something about the “Japanese” experience, but they also
tell us a lot more: about how people understand their
world, about artistic and narrative expression, about the
transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next,
about science and religion, and on and on. Komatsu may
have first come across what he calls “mystic thinking” in
Japanese texts, but as the history of monsters and the
supernatural in other countries also reminds us, such
thinking is clearly not limited to Japan. Ideally, the study of
yōkai gestures to something beyond Japan—to the study of
human culture—and the new yōkaigaku can work to
transcend the language of essentialism.



Best-Selling Yōkai: Kyōgoku Natsuhiko
Although Komatsu’s books are well read, he is still working
within an academic environment. The current star of the
creative yōkai world (other than Mizuki Shigeru, who
remains exceedingly popular) is the best-selling novelist
Kyōgoku Natsuhiko (b. 1963). Kyōgoku grew up with the
manga and anime of Mizuki, whom he credits as a direct
influence on his own career. He is also a serious researcher
and has worked with Komatsu and other scholars (he
participated in Komatsu’s yōkai workshops).
Kyōgoku is almost supernaturally prolific. Since his debut
novel in 1994, he has written dozens of books and
hundreds of short stories and essays. Many of his novels
are so long they are easily spotted in the paperback section
of a bookstore: bricklike books dwarfing their neighbors.
His fiction has been adapted for television, film, manga,
and anime. He also publishes research articles, edits
academic volumes on yōkai, lectures widely throughout
Japan, and appears annually in forums and panel
discussions, where he always draws a huge crowd. He is a
celebrity in both the literary and yōkai worlds, and his work
brings these two worlds together.
Born in Hokkaido, Kyōgoku attended the Kuwazawa
Design School in Tokyo, worked for a while at an
advertising agency, and set up on his own as a designer.
Legend has it that one day, with no warning, he simply
brought a massive manuscript to the Kōdansha publishing
house; the resulting book was Ubume no natsu (The



Summer of the Ubume), a runaway best seller. Set in 1950s
Tokyo, The Summer of the Ubume is a mystery story told in
the first person by tabloid writer and novelist Sekiguchi
Tatsumi, and it features a cantankerous but brilliant used
book dealer named Chūzenji Akihiko, generally called by
the name of his shop, Kyōgoku-dō. The complex narrative
surrounds the yōkai ubume; in the process the book
mentions Sekien, Enryō, and Yanagita, and it explores
questions of belief and psychology. Parts of the novel read
like an introduction to yōkaigaku. All the characters are
quirky, and the unlikely hero, Kyōgoku-dō, seems like an
odd mixture of Inoue Enryō and Abe no Seimei, cloyingly
scientistic but simultaneously privy to the mysteries of the
otherworld (and the human mind).
The Summer of the Ubume is the first work in Kyōgoku’s
“Hyakkiyagyō series” of novels, each of which features
many of the same characters found in the others and draws
on a Sekien yōkai for title and motif. The theme of each
story reflects the nature of the particular yōkai, resulting in
a unique blend of the mystical atmospherics of yōkai fiction
and the rational deductive methods of a modern detective
novel. Kyōgoku’s writing is famous for its sophisticated use
of difficult kanji, and the books themselves are known for
their high production values and stylish design.
Kyōgoku has also written numerous short stories, often
set in the Edo period and presented under various different
“hyaku-monogatari” titles. Nochi no kōsetsu hyaku
monogatari (Subsequent hyaku-monogatari rumors) won



the prestigious Naoki Prize for popular fiction in 2003.
Moreover, Kyōgoku is extremely adept at crossing into
other media; his second novel in the Hyakkiyagyō series,
for example, Mōryō no hako (The box of the mōryō, 1995),
was made into a manga, anime, and a live action film.
Along with yōkai researchers Tada Katsumi and
Murakami Kenji, Kyōgoku has published an informal
roundtable discussion called Yōkai baka (Yōkai crazy,
2001). With Aramata Hiroshi and Mizuki Shigeru, he is one
of the driving forces behind a triannual journal called Kai
(The strange) that began publication in 1997 and advertises
itself as the only magazine in the world completely
dedicated to yōkai. It publishes scholarly articles (by
Komatsu, among others), as well as roundtable discussions,
manga, analyses of Sekien’s images, short fiction, and
photographs.78
Kyōgoku has expressed deep admiration for Mizuki
Shigeru, and even jokingly claims to “want to become like
that old man in forty years.”79 And indeed, like his mentor,
Kyōgoku is a celebrity, known not only for his creative
genius and prolificacy but also for his personal style. Unlike
most contemporary writers, for example, he often appears
in public wearing a traditional Japanese kimono. And,
mysteriously, he always wears black, fingerless gloves.
Boom



Since the 1980s, Japan has experienced a “yōkai boom.”
Although it is impossible to quantify what actually makes
something a boom, it seems that the combination of manga,
anime, research, fiction, film, and other manifestations of
yōkai and yōkai-related material in popular culture reached
a tipping point of sorts: suddenly, in the 1980s, yōkai
became visible and commercially profitable. The continued
production of yōkai manga, anime, and video games
suggests that they still are. At the same time, serious
research into yōkai also continues. Occasionally an
undiscovered text will come to light—an otogizōshi or
kibyōshi—and experts such as Tokuda Kazuo or Adam
Kabat will explore what they reveal about how people once
understood yōkai. Komatsu’s work in particular has
spawned a whole new generation of researchers—people
such as Kagawa Masanobu, Yasui Manami, and Iikura
Yoshiyuki—who continue to expand the boundaries of the
new yōkaigaku.
For the sake of brevity, my historical summary here has
focused primarily on people and texts related to yōkai per
se, but other fields are closely associated. For example,
recent Japanese horror movies, known as J-horror, draw on
many folk ideas and images, often developing them in
modern settings with contemporary technology. And the
internationally recognized anime of Studio Ghibli are
steeped in yōkai lore and traditional imagery and ideas.
Takahata Isao’s Heisei tanuki gassen: Pompoko (Pom Poko,
1994) draws directly on tanuki legends as well as famous



hyakkiyagyō images. And Miyazaki Hayao’s films, from
Tonari no totoro (My Neighbor Totoro, 1988) to Mononoke
hime (Princess Mononoke, 1997) and Sen to chihiro no
kamikakushi (Spirited Away, 2001), are creatively inspired
by the yōkai world. And this is to say nothing of Pokémon,
Yu-Gi-Oh! and the explosively popular Yōkai Watch, which
are all directly and indirectly related to yōkai folklore.

If all of this is part of the so-called boom, then it has
been going on so long now that perhaps it is not really



appropriate to call it a boom. Rather, it is simply that yōkai,
in many different shapes and in a huge range of media, are
an indelible feature of contemporary Japanese cultural life
and—given their proven ability to adapt to new forms of
expression—will remain that way for years to come.

Yōkai Practice/Yōkai
Theory
By tracing how yōkai have been portrayed, illustrated, and
analyzed at different times in Japanese history, we can see
that they are a permanent (though ever-changing) feature
of the cultural landscape. And if Japan is currently
experiencing a yōkai boom, it is only because in recent
years Mizuki, Komatsu, Kyōgoku, and others have brought
this feature to the attention of a large number of people. In
other words, the boom is about awareness. Now that
people notice that yōkai have long been part of their lives
in legends or literature or art or games—they feel a greater
affinity for them and are more interested in thinking about
what they mean. In places where a local yōkai legend may
have been all but forgotten, efforts are made to revitalize it.
Scholars spend time looking for yōkai-related texts and
images and exploring new approaches for analyzing them.
And certainly commercial businesses such as publishers,
filmmakers, and toy companies are well aware of the profit



potential of anything having to do with yōkai.
In a sense, then, yōkai can be thought of as part of
contemporary commercial and folkloric practice. When I
use the word practice here, I mean yōkai are not just found
in historical texts, old images, folktales, and legends from
the past, or even in manga, anime, and films today, but
rather they play an intimate and informal role in everyday
lives—at least for some people. Yōkai of practice are not
simply objects or creatures or phenomena but a broad and
exciting theme around which people gather.
The idea of practice has a long history in anthropological
and sociological theory, but what I stress here is that the
practice of yōkai entails people not simply accepting yōkai
as they are handed down but actively engaging with them,
changing them, and making them their own. By thinking in
terms of practice, we explore how people express agency
and creativity within existing rules and structures. We see
close up the folkloric creativity mentioned earlier, the
negotiation between conservative tradition and innovative
change, between communal and individual voices. This is
particularly evident when we visit a “folk group” deeply
immersed in the practice of yōkai: we see how people can
be meaningfully connected to each other through their
interests, and how yōkai can be, in a sense, a concrete part
of life.
At the same time, yōkai always also raise abstract
questions. In the final pages of this chapter, I further
develop some of the ideas we have seen throughout and



explore more conceptual ways that yōkai reflect and inform
our cognitive and social structures. Of course, there is no
grand unified theory of yōkai, but thinking about them in
the abstract can inspire theoretical and philosophical
speculation about the ways we experience and make sense
of the world. And the abstract and the concrete, the theory
and the practice, are never far apart.
YŌKAI CULTURE NETWORK
Long ago, folklorist Alan Dundes argued that a folk group
can be any group of people with a shared interest or some
other linking factor, such as an association with a common
idea, place, or even language. In Japan today, the word
yōkai, along with the various associations that go with it,
serves as just this sort of linking factor, providing a bond
for an otherwise diverse set of people. Members of this
extended community may not actually know each other and
may never even meet—but nonetheless, they are connected
by a common interest in yōkai. This folk group would
certainly include all the people mentioned in the previous
chapters—the scholars, writers, and artists, as well as all
the people who read and view their work.
Such a group, however, would be so extensive as to be
almost meaningless, or at least not a manageable size for
exploring the way people associate with ideas and each
other. It is more productive to think of people (and ideas) as
being connected through a kind of network. I call this the



yōkai culture network. The YCN has no center; it is a kind
of “rhizome,” a concept originally used in botany but
developed by philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix
Guattari to refer to systems that are interconnected and
nonhierarchical. The structure of relations in such a system
is not treelike, with a trunk and branches, but more like a
web of tangled roots and vines. As Deleuze and Guattari
explain, “Any point of a rhizome can be connected to
anything other, and must be.”1
Within the YCN, however, we do find a few particularly
dynamic points of intersection—let’s call them nodes or
hubs—around which certain people and activities tend to
cluster. We can think of each one of these nodes as a kind
of community of practice, each with a slightly different
focus, from which influences and ideas radiate. There are
at least four of these: the local, the academic, the
commercial, and the vernacular. These nodes are all
equally important—they are connected and symbiotic. By
briefly examining them, we can explore what yōkai mean to
different people in different places and positions; we can
also see how they mutually influence each other and how
individuals fit into different parts of the broader network.
After a brief tour of each node, I will zero in particularly on
the vernacular.
Local: Heritage and Connection



The local here refers to the many manifestations of yōkai
found in specific places throughout Japan. This may be the
oldest node of yōkai culture, and it is often the impetus for
the development of the others. It includes, for example,
legends of tengu living on a particular mountain, or tales of
tree spirits haunting a dark forest, or ghost or poltergeist
phenomena associated with a particular building in a city.
In some cases, a yōkai may be known only to a few hundred
people living in a corner of one small village or
neighborhood. In short, the local suggests a direct
connection with location, with place. If we think of practice
as the way in which people engage with and use yōkai, then
local practice is characterized by people interacting with
the legends, beliefs, folktales, and so on that are part of
their own geographical community.
But even though the local is defined by its affiliation with
a particular place, the way people interact with their own
local yōkai can be determined by outside factors, such as
the academic and the commercial. For example, in the city
of Tōno, in Iwate Prefecture, there have long been stories
of kappa. But after Yanagita Kunio wrote The Tales of Tōno
in 1910, the local kappa there became part of the academic
world and now reside not only in the kappa-buchi (kappa
pond) there but also in research books—including this one.
They are simultaneously part of the commercial world,
used to advertise Tōno; the kappa pond is a tourist
attraction now, and even the police box at the Tōno train



station is shaped like a winking kappa, a gesture of friendly
welcome to visitors from out of town.2
Mizuki Shigeru’s hometown of Sakaiminato provides
another example. Certainly there were once local yōkai
legends and beliefs there, but now (at least to the casual
visitor) they have been overwritten by the connection with
Mizuki, and the town is full of references to yōkai from his
manga—that is, from all over the country. For many of the
residents of Sakaiminato, then, local engagement with
yōkai means a kind of commercial engagement with
Mizuki’s yōkai and their fans.
There are many other examples, most of which do not
demonstrate such a direct influence from academic or
commercial interests. In some places, a local yōkai legend
may be learned at school, for instance, as part of the study
of local or regional history. Or it may be the focus of a
shrine ritual or festival. Sometimes a legend may be the
catalyst for local engagement with the wider world. For
example, the Japanese Oni Exchange Museum (Nihon no
oni no kōryū hakubutsukan) is located in a rural part of
Kyoto Prefecture famous as the site of the Shuten dōji oni
legend. The museum celebrates the local relationship with
the legend but also introduces oni-related lore and material
from all over Japan.
Similarly, but on an even smaller scale, in rural Fukuoka
Prefecture, in Ukiha City near the Chikugo River—famous
for kappa—there is a shop that makes and sells traditional
style Japanese sweets, many of which have a kappa theme.



It turns out that the owner has long been fascinated by
kappa lore and for decades now has collected ceramic
figurines and other kappa-related goods from all over
Japan. The store itself is decorated with these items, and
the second floor—which the owner may allow interested
visitors to view—is like a private museum dedicated solely
to kappa.
It is hard to draw any general conclusions about the
local. But in many cases, the local practice of yōkai is
characterized by a sense of tradition and history and
community. Whatever the local yōkai legend is—indeed, no
matter how gruesome or unattractive—it suggests
continuity with residents in the past. On the local level,
yōkai are a form of heritage, often a source of pride, and
sometimes a resource for commercial prosperity. They
provide a cherished connection with the past that people
living in the present feel compelled to hand down to future
generations.
Academic: Lens into Another World
There is no need for me to write much about the academic
node of the YCN here, because so much of the information
in the previous chapters emerges from this particular form
of practice. Suffice it to say that even though only a few
scholars, such as Komatsu, have actually built their
academic careers around yōkai, many scholars in a variety
of disciplines touch on yōkai in their research. Similarly,



archivists and museum curators, such as Yumoto Kōichi and
Kagawa Masanobu, have an abiding interest in yōkai
culture in general and its material aspects more
specifically. It seems that at least once a year somewhere in
Japan there is a major museum exhibition of yōkai art and
artifacts. The academic node focuses on collection,
interpretation, writing, and display; for people involved in
this form of engagement, yōkai provide a lens into bigger
issues—literature, history, art, and religion, as well as
concepts of nation and “Japanese culture.”
Commercial: The Yōkai Industrial Complex
Since at least the 1970s and 1980s, a plethora of books,
manga, anime, video games, and films have creatively
played with traditional and historical images of yōkai,
recontextualizing them and repurposing them for all sorts
of uses. In the previous chapter, I reviewed some of the
largest actors in this commercial node of the YCN, but what
I stress here is simply that there is clearly money to be
made from yōkai. Mizuki’s manga and anime are at the
heart of this; their success proved that yōkai can be
profitable. While not quite the Disney of Japan, Mizuki
Production is instrumental in publishing Mizuki’s work and
licensing his images to toy companies, game makers, and
other manufacturers. Among the Mizuki goods for sale on
the Mizuki Production website are yōkai candles, Papa
Eyeball figurines, Nurikabe bags, Kitarō calendars, Mizuki



yōkai stickers, bookmarks, coffee mugs, folders, DVDs,
games, and a whole range of smartphone apps.3
Mizuki is the seminal figure in this commercial node, but
many other individuals and manufacturers produce yōkai
related materials for profit, starting with the range of
products (books, DVDs, etc.) generated by best-selling
author Kyōgoku Natsuhiko. Numerous manga artists
incorporate yōkai in their work, and even some
researchers, such as Murakami Kenji and Tada Katsumi,
make a living through a mix of writing and lecturing on
yōkai. Many of them contribute to the journal Kai, with its
blend of manga, fiction, and academic research and
commentary. Another more recent journal, Yū (written Yoo
on the cover), is similar to Kai but focuses more on ghost
tales and horror stories than on yōkai themselves.
All these products attest to the fact that yōkai have
commercial allure. Some individuals, like Kyōgoku, Tada,
and Murakami, are simultaneously active researchers and
creative producers of new ideas. Others are less caught up
in the creative side of the practice and more involved in
actually manufacturing the items themselves—whether in
paper or plastic or celluloid or digital form. But all these
people and products are part of what we might call the
yōkai industrial complex, in which commercial producers
draw on traditional yōkai imagery and historical
background to create attractive yōkai-related goods. The
yōkai industrial complex provides a structure not only for
creating products but also for promoting and selling them.



Negatively viewed, it is a system that corrupts the
“authenticity” and “folkloric” value of yōkai, removing them
from their local or personal context and transforming them
into commodities from which only a few individuals and
businesses profit. It makes the public property that is a
folkloric yōkai into a private commercial possession. On the
other hand, such commercial production is one way in
which yōkai stay relevant and viable and ever changing. It
is a circular process: yōkai keep businesses afloat and
people employed, and the yōkai industrial complex in turn
ensures that yōkai continue to play a role in the cultural
imagination of consumers.
Vernacular: Subculture of Yōkai Aficionados
In addition to the mass producers of these widely
distributed goods, there is also an overlapping group of
people who participate in the production of yōkai items.
These individuals grew up with Mizuki’s images and now
Kyōgoku’s novels; not satisfied with simply consuming,
however, they have entered the fray as independent
producers themselves. Some are yōkai otaku, profoundly
inspired by manga and anime and possessing an almost
encyclopedic knowledge of yōkai. Others are more
enamored with older or localized yōkai manifestations, and
have traveled (or read) widely in search of yōkai folklore. I
call this the vernacular node, to stress its informal,
unofficial nature. In a sense, this is a sort of subculture of



yōkai aficionados, a grassroots community of yōkai
producers focusing on handcrafting and very small print
runs.
One member of this community, for example, is the
illustrator of most of the pictures in this book—Shinonome
Kijin—who has a full-time job completely unrelated to yōkai
(he is a schoolteacher). In his spare time, however,
Shinonome not only draws yōkai in a wide variety of styles
but also writes short texts introducing yōkai and their
history. The brief, inexpensive booklets he produces are
lovingly and meticulously crafted. One or two have been
published by commercial presses, but for the most part
Shinonome puts them together himself and sells them
independently at manga- and yōkai-related gatherings.
This node of the network is restrained by neither the
rules of academia nor the demands of a highly
commercialized market economy. The members of this
small community are, as they sometimes call themselves,
yōkai-zuki, literally “lovers of yōkai” or yōkai aficionados;
they are well versed in folklore and history but also engage
imaginatively, inventively, with yōkai culture. By briefly
visiting a “yōkai event” run by one such group of yōkai
aficionados, we get a sense of the dynamism of this group
of people and the diverse ways they articulate their
creativity through yōkai. It becomes evident that within the
vernacular community of the YCN, yōkai provide a kind of
language, a form of communication through which
individuals express artistry and humor.



In February 2013, Shinonome Kijin invited me to attend
an event at which he would be selling some of his works.
The gathering was held from noon to 5:30 P.M. in a creative
studio in the basement of a building in the Takadanobaba
district of Tokyo, a lively area near Waseda University, full
of bars, restaurants, used bookstores, and other shops
catering to a young, creative crowd. The venue consisted of
two large rooms with about twenty-five tables displaying all
sorts of yōkai items for sale. This was the second such
gathering for this group, the first one having occurred
several months earlier; both were organized by Nurarihyon
Uchida (an alias), who was dressed in costume and makeup
to look like the yōkai nurarihyon, a creature of obscure
origins that has come to be considered a yōkai leader.
Nurarihyon Uchida describes himself as a “yōkai
navigator,” “yōkai performer,” and writer. At the event, he
was flanked by four women dressed as kitsune and tengu,
complete with feathery wings, in rather revealing
costumes. Such cosplay is a common element of this
vernacular yōkai community, especially since many
members are interested in manga and anime. Uchida
explained to me that organizing these gatherings was easy
for him because about two-thirds of the participants were
his friends; they were already part of a community linked
by their interests, associating in similar events, or
communicating through Internet forums and social
networking sites. Many of them, like Uchida himself or my
friend Shinonome Kijin, are known primarily by their pen



names or other aliases. Most participants were between the
ages of twenty and fifty, and about 60 percent were male.
A wide range of wares was on display. One participant
sat behind a table full of plastic yōkai figurines, some his
own design and others modeled on Mizuki images (with
legal permission, he explained). Right nearby, another
participant exhibited—in stark contrast to these colorful
plastic items—a variety of handmade objects modeled to
look like mummified yōkai, or mummified parts of yōkai,
such as a kappa’s arm, complete with its own wooden case.
There were also various yōkai body parts in specimen
bottles. (Special orders are accepted.) At the next table a
vendor was displaying tengūthemed items, including small
plastic tengu heads that could be attached to the wall in
such a way that the tengu’s notoriously long nose would
serve as a hook or a coat peg. And another artist had
created small wood-framed paper lanterns, each one
illustrated carefully with a line drawing in the style of
Toriyama Sekien.
Several people, such as Shinonome, were selling manga
they had drawn themselves—some had a handcrafted pen
and-ink appearance, while others were printed in brilliant
color on glossy paper. One woman was selling original
yōkai-themed short stories; each booklet, between twenty
and forty pages, cost no more than five hundred yen. At
another table, a man calling himself Schumann Shigeoka
had humorously rewritten the lyrics of famous popular
songs, giving them all yōkai themes. In the introduction to



his twenty-three-page illustrated booklet, he explains that
“the lyrics have been changed so that only yōkai
aficionados can understand them. Please use them at
gatherings of yōkai aficionados.” The songs themselves are
lighthearted and creative, each page illustrated with a
relevant yōkai and brief explanation.4
Consider both the enthusiasm and imagination that go
into the production of so many of these items, as well as
the fact that these artists and authors are producing their
work for members of their own community. Shigeoka’s
comment that his lyrics are only for yōkai aficionados
applies to his own changed songs and to many of the other
items for sale. This sort of creative in-group communication
is, in fact, one of the ways folklore has been defined
—“artistic communication in small groups.”5
Another example of this form of practice is evident in a
collection of “yōkai photographs.” Each entry in the booklet
starts with a picture drawn by an artist to replicate a well
known illustration of a particular yōkai. For example, one
page has a small, hand-drawn copy of Toriyama Sekien’s
image of akaname. Above this is another picture, this one a
copy of Mizuki’s version of akaname (which is itself based
on Sekien’s image). Finally, on the facing page is a
photograph of the yōkai aficionado artists themselves
posing to replicate, cheaply and very tongue in cheek, the
Mizuki image. In short, every entry demonstrates the
derivative nature of each succeeding image. Like a visual
version of the old game of telephone, the portrayal of the



yōkai is transmitted up through the ages—from Sekien to
Mizuki to the present artists—until it becomes a
photograph, which ironically seems the least “real” of them
all.6
This is a profound form of play: the images are copies, of
course, but they are also originals—part of the constant
process of replication and innovation that is the very
essence of folklore, with its different versions and variants
transmitted through time and space. Such playfulness,
however, can work only if the members of the yōkai
network feel an affinity with each other not only across the
present (synchronic) moment but also through the historic
(diachronic). That is, just as these artists are
communicating with each other across space in the
present, they are also connecting to their predecessors,
whether living people they have never met, like Mizuki, or
long-dead historical figures like Sekien. The yōkai network
is an “imagined community” linking both the living and the
dead through a common interest in yōkai.7
The gathering of yōkai aficionados was not simply a
marketplace for yōkai-themed creations. There was also a
performance. At six that evening, some forty people paid
one thousand yen each (about ten U.S. dollars) for
admission to a panel discussion, emceed by Nurarihyon
Uchida and featuring manga artists Shinonome Kijin and
Schumann Shigeoka, a figurine maker, a cosplayer, and a
paper-cutting artist. The event was called “Yōkai-tachi no
iru tokoro” (Where the yōkai are) and began with Uchida



asking each member of the group which yōkai he or she
was currently most excited about.8 The discussion was
wide-ranging and humorous, with participants presenting
new versions of old yōkai, complete with PowerPoint slides
of their illustrations, and also introducing little-known
yōkai from the Edo period. As with the items for sale
earlier, the performance demonstrated a dynamic
engagement with yōkai as living, changing things with as
much meaning in the present as they had had in the past.
The second part of the event was a contest of images and
wit, in which Uchida challenged the panel to create
illustrations in response to questions, such as “What is the
cutest yōkai?” and “What is the difference between a yōkai
aficionado and a normal person?” While participants spoke
with knowledge about and respect for yōkai images from
the past, they also demonstrated dexterity and imagination
in converting these images for the present, complete with
references to contemporary popular culture. As an
observer, I was reminded of the playfulness of the Edo
period kibyōshi artists and others who had treated yōkai as
mutable figures to express both personal creativity and
social satire. To current-day yōkai aficionados, the
pantheon of known yōkai provides endless source material
for creating innovative and topical characters.
Concluding at eight o’clock, this event was followed by a
reception, complete with sake from all over Japan, the label
of each bottle containing a yōkai motif of some sort.
Meanwhile, at a venue a few train stops away, another



group of yōkai aficionados was gathering for an annual
party. These were people from the more commercial node
of yōkai culture: they included publishers and commercially
successful manga artists, the novelist Kyōgoku Natsuhiko,
the editors of Kai and Yū, and researchers Tada Katsumi
and Murakami Kenji (who organizes the event every year).
Altogether some forty-six participants attended the raucous
party at an all-you-can-eat-and-drink Chinese restaurant.
Some participants from the earlier, vernacular yōkai event
also joined this one, arriving a little late; in other words,
the two nodes within the network are not mutually
exclusive. After three hours at the Chinese restaurant,
about twenty stalwarts rented a private room in a karaoke
bar, where they hung out until sunrise, drinking, talking,
and singing songs, including the yōkai-themed parodies
from Schumann Shigeoka’s collection.
I linger on the events of that day because so often folklore
is relegated to the past, or it is thought of as something
untainted by commercial interests and contemporary media
or, similarly, as something “authentic” in danger of
disappearing. But when I arrived home after a long night
spent talking and drinking (and singing) with members of
the yōkai community, it was clear to me that yōkai as a folk
practice, as part of a constant process of tradition and
change—a process of both preservation and innovation—is
very much alive today. Its vernacular and commercial
practitioners, whether they make manga, or CDs of yōkai



themed songs, or models of mummified kappa, are deeply
aware of the history of yōkai (as outlined by the academic
practitioners) and are also profoundly interested in the
continued meaning of yōkai on the local level. At the same
time, however, they do not feel restricted by these
approaches, and they themselves engage creatively with
yōkai, reinventing them, animating them, infusing them
with contemporary relevance.
My own research has brought me into most frequent
contact with the academic node of the YCN: I have met
scholars who seek the meanings of yōkai in artistic forms
and literary texts. I have also worked in villages and cities
with local people who are very knowledgeable about their
own yōkai beliefs and legends, and who develop these for
festivals and community celebrations. While the particular
objectives of people clustered around each node of the
network may be different, such differences are less
interesting than the convergences. If the study of yōkai is,
as Komatsu puts it, a kind of human-ology, then yōkai are a
window into a world of personal obsession, community
concern, commercial production, and folkloric tradition.
The model of the YCN gives us insight into human
connections as well as cultural and economic structures. In
a hundred years, I suspect, scholars will look back on this
particular period in the same way we look back at the late
Edo period—as a time when the practice of yōkai was
thriving, a moment of great creativity fueled by new media



technologies, changing social relations, and a vibrant
network of imaginative individuals linked by a concept.
ZONE OF UNCERTAINTY
I hope it is clear by now that yōkai existed in the past but
are also very much alive today. As we have seen, if we keep
the word yōkai relatively loose in definition and open-ended
in usage, it can encompass an exciting diversity of
phenomena. At this juncture I wish I could offer a single
yōkai theory to bring all this diversity together in a
meaningful way, some sort of key to crack the “yōkai code.”
But such a gesture, unfortunately, would not do justice to
the complexity of yōkai culture.
That said, however, this culture is not without its
governing principles. In the next few pages I briefly explore
some of the ideas, orientations, and keywords that can be
extracted and abstracted from the historical instances and
concrete examples we have looked at already, and from the
entries on actual yōkai in the bestiary section of the book,
which follows. In some cases, the discussion here simply
pushes a little harder on ideas introduced earlier, but these
are, in my view, critical concepts that inform the way yōkai
work and the functions they serve. These are the abstract
theoretical points that emerge from the concrete practice
of yōkai. With that in mind, each one of the short sections
that follows is an arrow pointing in a direction for further
exploration.



Empathy
I have already discussed how yōkai reflect a generally
animistic worldview—the idea that all things possess a
spirit, a soul, a life force of some sort. As one scholar of
Western monsters puts it, “Animism can be defined as the
belief that there are many kinds of persons in this world,
only some of whom are human.”9 By interpreting the
environment in this way, we can understand how trees and
stones become the dwelling places of kami. With such an
approach we can also imagine why an old musical
instrument that once sounded beautiful, or an old broom
that was once indispensable for keeping your home clean,
is so much more than just a disposable material object. It is
this feeling that gives life to tsukumogami.
This feeling also allows us to see the invisible: the
rattling window in the dead of night is the work of yanari
intent on disturbing our sleep. We attribute the cause of the
rattling to a consciousness similar to our own, something or
someone with desires and a will and the ability to make
decisions. While such a worldview may be key to the
emergence of yōkai, it is certainly exclusive neither to
Japan nor even to explicitly “animistic” cultures; witness,
for example, the popularity and emotive resonance of
movies such as the Toy Story series and Wall-E, which
concern the feelings of nonliving things.
A keyword here is empathy. Empathy is notoriously
difficult to define but is often characterized as the ability to
understand (or at least imagine you understand) the



feelings of another. Taken one step further, we can think of
it as the attribution of feelings, of intentionality and agency,
to somebody/something else, to an other—even to an object
or phenomenon. As one scholar puts it, “It is part of our
constant, everyday humdrum cognitive functioning that we
interpret all sorts of cues in our environment, not just
events but also the way things are, as the result of some
agent’s actions.”10 In a sense then, yōkai are artifacts of an
energetic expression of empathy—the discovery of
intention and subjectivity in the events of the outside
world, a projection of our own abilities to think and act
onto something else.
Antiempathy
But even as empathy allows us to attribute will and
intentions to things in the world around us, it does not
quite allow us to transcend the differences between those
things and ourselves. There is still a gap between self and
other. And this is one reason yōkai are often frightening or
grotesque—because even though they may emerge from a
feeling of empathy, it is ultimately our inability to fully
empathize with them, to imagine leaving our own bodies
and entering into theirs, that keeps them strange.
One of Japan’s most important modern writers, Abe Kōbō
(1924–1993), wrote an essay on why he and a lot of other
people are afraid of snakes. He explains that snakes are
beyond just “scary.” There is something deeply unnerving



about them; they provoke a loathing that is qualitatively
different from the fear we have of other wild beasts. This is
not, he says, because they were dangerous to our tree
dwelling ancestors and this sense of danger has come down
to us through our genes. Rather our fear stems from the
fact that snakes have no legs, and when we look at one
slithering out of a small hole in the ground, we have an
experience very different from the experience of watching
an animal like a dog or cat. Somehow we can imagine
ourselves in the place of a dog or cat (we know what it is
like to walk on our hands and knees). But a snake is too
alien for us to “personify” in this way; it is simply “close to
impossible to imagine its everyday life from the inside.”11
The same problem occurs when a creature has too many
legs—as in the case of a mukade (centipede)—because it,
too, moves so differently from us. We cannot identify with
it; we can’t empathize.
Abe does not mention yōkai specifically, but we can see
the same dynamic at work. It is not surprising that gigantic
snakes as well as mukade are also considered yōkai, or that
spiders like the tsuchigumo become symbols of dangerous,
monstrous otherness. We understand that a spider is a
living thing, but with only four limbs of our own we find it
difficult to imagine what it is like to propel ourselves
forward on eight. Think of the 1998 movie A Bug’s Life. The
filmmakers wisely chose to draw most of the major insect
protagonists with two legs and two arms rather than six



legs, a move that made them seem somehow more human,
allowing the viewer to identify with them.
My point is that yōkai operate in a tricky middle zone
that tests our powers of empathy. They emerge from an
instinct to imagine life and agency in other things; but at
the same time, they remain alien and creepy because of our
inability to fully empathize with them. They unsettle us
because they don’t “make sense” intellectually or
emotionally: they are the familiar and the unfamiliar
merged together in an uncanny assembly.12
The bestiary in the next section of this book contains a
number of yōkai sutured together from pieces of animals
the legs of a tiger, the head of a monkey, the wings of a
bird, and so on. These are chimeras, hybrids, neither one
animal nor another: they are uncanny exactly because of
their simultaneous resemblance to animals we know and
the unfamiliarity of their combination. The same goes for a
creature like the nekomata, a cat that looks like a run-of
the-mill feline except for its forked tail—and that forked tail
makes all the difference. There are also all sorts of
humanlike creatures with exaggerated features, such as a
long neck (e.g., mikoshi-nyūdō and rokurokubi) or a long
tongue (e.g., akaname, tenjōname). One frequent trait of
yōkai (and monsters from many other cultures) is
asymmetry: many of them have only one eye (e.g.,
hitotsume-kozō) or hop around on a single leg (e.g., kasa
bake). This imbalance, too, contributes to a sense of
simultaneous familiarity and distance.



Interstitial
For several decades now, theorists of robotics have
explored the idea that “as a robot’s appearance becomes
more human-like it is perceived as familiar to a viewer,
until finer nuances from human norms cause them [sic] to
appear strange, evoking a negative effect for the viewer.”13
In other words, when something looks almost-but-not-quite
human, it repulses us. In 1970, roboticist Mori Masahiro
famously named this gap between the familiar and the
unfamiliar the “uncanny valley.”14 Mori and others are
concerned with robots designed to look human, but I
suggest that many yōkai also reside somewhere in this
uncanny valley. Again, take the tsukumogami: familiar
household objects that suddenly have arms and legs,
making them uncomfortably unfamiliar. Or a kappa, green
and amphibious like a frog, but with a shell like a turtle and
the ability to walk upright like a monkey: a combination of
perfectly natural traits combined in an unnatural,
unfamiliar way. Or consider a shape-shifter like a tanuki or
kitsune. One creepy thing about shape-shifters is that,
despite their familiar appearance, they are never fully what
they appear to be—a fact occasionally revealed by a tail
emerging from their human clothing. They are literally
between—not really humans but not really furry little
mammals either.
There are many words we might use to describe this
common yōkai trait: in-between, hybrid, ambiguous,



liminal, but let me suggest interstitial. The quality of being
interstitial relates to gaps, the zones of uncertainty
between zones of certainty. Similarly, interstitial can refer
to an assembling of different and perhaps seemingly
incompatible elements into a new whole. The interstitial is
not an empty and meaningless space but just the opposite:
a site of communication, combination, and contact. The
zone of uncertainty is the space where meanings are made.
Space and Time
The notion of the interstitial also helps us explore questions
of where and when yōkai appear. Although answers depend
on the particular yōkai, we can make a few generalizations.
Yōkai tend to appear between and at the edge. I remember
the first time I heard of a kamaitachi, a “sickle weasel,”
from a Japanese friend who had learned of this yōkai as a
child. When I asked her where it lived, she explained
mysteriously that it resided in the “spaces between the
hours.”
Yōkai love bridges, tunnels, intersections, crossroads,
and borders. These are spaces where control and
ownership is unclear. Governing authority is undetermined.
A bridge is neither land nor water, neither this side of the
river nor that. A tunnel is a dark narrow portal through
which you are transported almost magically into a world
different from the one you just left. And a crossroads is a
point where one can go different ways, a space that



demands a decision, and where what you decide has
consequences. All these interstitial spaces are dangerous
exactly because they are zones of uncertainty. They are
spaces of change and potential, of passage from one realm
into another. Sometimes this passage is literal, as in the
passage from one side of the river to the other or from one
town into another, but such movement easily dovetails with
the figurative: such places of passage can also become, as
it were, portals to the otherworld of yōkai.
Similarly, yōkai may appear at different times of day, but
in general they seem to be most active during the twilight
hours: the vague, hazy, gray period between the light of day
and the dark of night. Yanagita Kunio highlighted this in
several essays focusing on the words tasogare and
kawatare, which mean “twilight.” He says that these words
originally meant something like “who are you?” or “who is
that face?” They were uttered at dusk, when you could no
longer recognize the person walking in your direction.
Depending on the response, you could determine whether
the figure coming toward you was a villager, an outsider, or
perhaps a yōkai.15 In zoological terms, yōkai would be
known as “crepuscular,” a word used in distinction to
diurnal or nocturnal and indicating a predilection not for
brightness or darkness but for the interstitial moments of
twilight.
Again, yōkai emerge from spaces and times between
existing structures, between here and there, between day
and night, when nothing is quite certain. In the



philosophical study of logic, the “law of the excluded
middle” suggests that for any proposition there are only
two possible choices: true or not true. The middle is
excluded. But, of course, the interstitial space-time in
which yōkai thrive is this excluded middle—wherein lies the
possibility of a third, previously unimagined, choice. This
excluded middle is a zone of uncertainty not because of the
negative value associated with uncertainty but because of
its potential. Certainty can delimit vision and hinder
change. Uncertainty requires us to see things in fresh ways
and find things we otherwise would not look for.
Variation and Abundance
If these are some of the principles by which human beings
interact with yōkai, perhaps it is not surprising that the
yōkai world is one of variation and abundance. Variation is
intrinsic to any folkloric phenomenon, and yōkai are no
exception. Their diversity is dazzling. They originate from
both native and foreign sources, are constructed from a
mixture of past histories and present concerns, from
communal beliefs and individual creativity, visual imagery,
narrative innovation, wordplay, and commercial inspiration.
Not only are there thousands of local yōkai that live only in
particular small communities or are known by only a single
group of people, but even a yōkai such as the kappa goes
by dozens of different names (raising the question, of
course, of how we decide what a kappa actually is).



Because of this diversity and variation, the sheer number
of yōkai is overwhelming—the recurrence of the number
one hundred reflects this abundance. It is exciting, and
frightening, to know that there are always more yōkai out
there. And if yōkai are often a combination of traits of other
things (animals, people, etc.), then of course such
combinations are infinite—and relatively easy to imagine.
While this book tends to concentrate on yōkai within a
folkloric context, yōkai have many different origins, some of
which we can never know and others which we can clearly
attribute to a particular individual. It is no coincidence that
a game like Pokémon, whether consciously or not, develops
this notion of abundance to invent hundreds of new
monsters.
Encyclopedic
But how do we get a handle on this variation and
abundance? One way that has been predominant since at
least the early Edo period is what I call the encyclopedic
mode. As we have seen, some early Japanese
encyclopedias, such as the Three Realms, included yōkai in
their pages. And even though works such as those by
Toriyama Sekien are not “real” encyclopedias, they operate
in the same fashion, extracting yōkai from their stories,
from the particular space-time contexts they haunt, so that
they can be ordered and organized. This encyclopedic
mode for thinking about yōkai (and other things)



emphasizes: (1) the presentation of inclusive knowledge
about a subject, (2) the compression of this knowledge into
self-contained units, and (3) the organization of these units.
This is exactly what Sekien did with his catalogs. It is
what Yanagita did with his “Yōkai Glossary.” And it is still
done today: many books about yōkai contain some form of
listing and explanation, and some, including many by
Mizuki Shigeru, are full-fledged encyclopedias. This desire
for order seems to be a governing principle of how we
approach the world of yōkai. Perhaps it is precisely because
they reside in the zone of uncertainty that we call out for
something certain about them.
Ludic
It is also clear that even though yōkai may be strange and
interstitial, they are not always scary: they are also about
play, or the “ludic mode.” In fact yōkai are often produced
through playfulness. Many of Sekien’s yōkai, for example,
were consciously created from wordplay, and his images
are full of visual puns. (Because he puts his newly invented
yōkai in an encyclopedic format, however, they seem as if
they have been around for a very long time.) Even a
practice such as hyaku-monogatari was a form of
recreation and entertainment, to say nothing of kibyōshi
and, of course, manga and anime and video games today.
For all the spookiness they may educe, yōkai are also fun.
And this levity is one key to their longevity and versatility:



if the zone of uncertainty allows limitless possibilities and
unbridled imagination, then it is a space of experimentation
and play and ultimately of creation. The ludic mode often
coincides neatly with the encyclopedic mode; again, Sekien
is one example, but think also about the games of Pokémon
and Yu-Gi-Oh! and the way each card contains a compact
unit of information, like an encyclopedia entry.16
Media Mix/Multiplatform
We should also remember that franchises such as Pokémon
or Yu-Gi-Oh! are “media mix,” a term suggesting that
narratives and individual characters—such as, for example,
Pikachu—are equally at home on trading cards, on
television screens, in comic books, in electronic games, or
even in three-dimensional performative forms such as
cosplay. All these different expressions contribute to our
image of Pikachu. As one scholar puts it, the media mix
creates “a synergistic relationship between multiple media
formats.”17 It allows for a multiplatform mode of
expression, in which the “same” character can perform on
many different stages, none of them necessarily more
authentic or original than the next.
I am talking here about contemporary media, but notions
of media mix, multiplatformativity, and intertextuality are
also helpful for thinking about much older forms of
expression. As we have already seen, questions of
authenticity and origins are less important for the yōkai of



folklore than the fact that they are at home in a wide range
of environments and media. Even some of our oldest
recorded yōkai move from one platform to another. A
tengu, for example, might be the protagonist of a
Kamakura-period setsuwa, be portrayed visually in a
Muromachi-period picture scroll, be discussed orally in a
local legend, and appear in a video game or anime series.
We cannot say that any of these is the “true” or “original”
tengu. They are versions of each other—the same but
different—and it is the tengu’s ability to thrive within
diverse genres and media environments, to perform
simultaneously on multiple platforms, that makes it such a
vital yōkai even today. It has been noted about anime that
“media mix must presuppose or must create a situation
where characters can move beyond one media format and
beyond one narrative context.”18 These same ideas about
transferability also apply to the yōkai of tradition.
Characters
We have already explored the way yōkai phenomena
change into yōkai things, morphing from events or
occurrences into beings or creatures. Because of this
process, today those things we usually call yōkai are no
longer scary phenomena but instead named creatures that
may refer to scary phenomena. Remember how a feeling of
powerlessness to move forward morphed into a yōkai called
a nurikabe with eyes and arms and legs? Similarly when



the local river floods or a child drowns, the culprit is not
the weather or the water but a creature identified as a
kappa. Labeling and naming are at the heart of this
process. “For something to become a yōkai, it needs to be
named,” Shinonome Kijin explains. “Because without a
name, it is just a scary story [kaidan].”19
Naming is part of the encyclopedic process, a way to
identify something with concision and accuracy. It is also
part of a process of character creation, by which I mean the
way specific versions of tanuki and kappa, the kind found in
legends and folktales, are combined into generic versions
of the creatures and then eventually transformed into, for
example, PR mascots for a credit card (DC Card). As
advertising icons, tanuki and kappa are cute and cuddly,
akin to commercial characters such as Sanrio’s Kero Kero
Keroppi or most famously, Hello Kitty. The mascot-ified
tanuki and kappa are still indexable as traditional yōkai,
but as representatives for a credit card company they
presumably are no longer associated with causing mischief
or drowning children!
Such yōkai characters appear nationwide in
advertisements, manga, anime, and video games; they also
serve as icons in any number of local communities. The
neighborhood of Kappabashi in Tokyo, for example,
employs a kappa as its symbol. The much smaller town of
Satsuma-Sendai in southern Kyushu also uses a kappa
called by its local name garappa—as a mascot figure. And
Hachiōji City recently created a cute, red-faced, geta



wearing boy tengu as its “tourism character.”20 For
decades now tengu, oni, and all sorts of other yōkai have
been enlisted in communities throughout Japan as mascots
for village revitalization (mura-okoshi).
But since the first decade of the twenty-first century,
there has also been another trend in character creation.
Although these newly created characters are not
necessarily yōkai, the creation process is related. Hundreds
of communities and institutions (including museums,
private companies, and even Tokyo Tower) have developed
what they call yuru-kyara: a word derived from “loose
[yurui] mascot character.” These are often made into big,
soft, lumbering, cutesified figures—think of those puffy big
headed Mickey Mouse characters prancing around
Disneyland—and used for PR and advertising.21
Inspirations for yuru-kyara mascots vary and include (but
are not limited to) animals, local products, physical objects,
and historical figures. Occasionally they are directly
inspired by yōkai, especially when there happens to be a
famous local legend or relevant belief. More often,
however, yuru-kyara are created anew by imaginatively
assembling representative characteristics of the community
or region. In the town of Imabari in Shikoku, for example,
the mascot (named Barysan) looks like a gigantic yellow
chick with a towel around its waist and a tiara on its head.
All these elements have meaning: the area is famous for its
grilled chicken (yakitori) and its towel industry, and the
tiara is shaped like the bridge that connects Shikoku and



Honshu. In a sense, these characteristics are filed away in
the shared “encyclopedia” of the local community and can
be selected and skillfully assembled into a new creation.
The ancient capital of Nara, famous for its Buddhist
temples and free-roaming deer, designed a character
named Sento-kun: a young Buddha-shaped boy dressed in
religious clothing, with deer antlers emerging from his
gigantic bald head. This particular mascot caused some
controversy among religious practitioners, as well as
among members of the general public who thought it
looked just plain ugly or, as it were, monstrous. But my
point here is that the creation of these yuru-kyara mascots
is much like the creation of yōkai; local features and
characteristics are stitched together to create a hybrid
creature or being to represent the community.
This idea of selecting from an existing set of
characteristics recalls a notion by the popular-culture
theorist Azuma Hiroki, that of a conceptual “database.”
Azuma suggests that consumers of manga and anime
interact with products and information through “database
consumption”; rather than thinking in terms of narrative,
they focus on settings, characters, and component parts.22
Clearly, a similar process of picking and choosing elements
to construct an appropriate new character occurs when a
yuru-kyara is created, just as it might (and does) when a
new yōkai comes into being. Such characters are portable
and identifiable across different contexts and different
media—just like yōkai who thrive and multiply and mutate



across diverse platforms. Of course, unlike the animals,
objects, or folkloric yōkai on which they may be based,
yuru-kyara are not necessarily in the public domain—as
individual or commercial inventions, they are subject to
copyright laws and conventions. While some of the more
popular characters allow for “looseness” in this regard,
many are “tightly” controlled and can be used only for
certain approved products and venues.23
Creation
I started this book with a discussion of how yōkai emerge
as people grapple with mysterious experiences, putting
names and faces on occurrences or feelings that are
otherwise indescribable. But from at least Sekien’s time
onward, we see a complementary process of creation
occurring. Just like the yuru-kyara devised all over Japan
today, many of the yōkai Sekien invented did not come into
being through attempts to describe mysterious phenomena.
Rather they were drawn from relevant elements and
existing motifs and put together in an interesting and often
ingenious fashion. I am not saying that new yōkai
characters do not serve a function; I am only noting that
their inception is different and, in a sense, more playful. It
derives not from the challenge of grappling with the
incomprehensible in the world around us but from the
challenge of making something new and sending it out into
that world.



But even freshly minted yōkai have something to say. In a
recent experiment, a Japanese university professor gave
her students twenty minutes to come up with a “new
yōkai”—to name it, describe its characteristics, and draw it.
The results were varied, of course, but many of the
invented creatures related directly to the concerns of
student life. Several students, for example, created yōkai
who mischievously alter the flow of time in order to make
people late for class. Many students built their yōkai
around wordplay and puns. One particularly resonant
example was called hitoma, which can variously be
interpreted as “one space,” “human gap,” or even “human
demon.” It refers to the single open seat one often finds on
a crowded train or subway, a seat that mysteriously nobody
seems willing to sit in. The student drew this yōkai as a
foreboding dark shadow, an eerie inky aura, occupying the
“empty” seat.24
This sort of newly created yōkai, whether it goes on to
circulate as a “real” belief or not, reflects associated
processes of play and naming. More important, even
though the hitoma did not emerge from a profound need,
its genesis still reflects the same process of creation we
have seen before. It expresses a subtle phenomenon—the
oddly untaken seat on a crowded train—for which no word
previously existed. Even when yōkai are purposely created
(for a class assignment no less!), they remain effective
vehicles for articulating thoughts for which we do not
already have vocabulary.



Global
With all this in mind, let me reiterate here the danger of
treating yōkai as a key to some essential secret of the
“Japanese people” or “Japanese psyche.” To be sure, those
things we call yōkai usually reside within the broad
geographic region known as Japan, but this region has over
120,000,000 individuals who, like people everywhere, hold
diverse beliefs and values. How is it possible to speak
collectively of “the Japanese”? Throughout this book I try to
avoid such language—and such traps of thinking—because
if yōkai teach us anything about “the Japanese,” it is that
monolithic terms like this are all but meaningless. As I have
stressed repeatedly, yōkai are characterized by diversity,
abundance, regional variation, and multiple origins; only in
this sense, perhaps, can we say they represent the
Japanese people!
I emphasize this here because people sometimes tend to
exoticize “Japan.” Distinctive aspects of culture and
aesthetics—such as ninjas, geishas, samurai, tea
ceremonies, even television game shows—are portrayed in
Western media as enigmatic or wacky. Yōkai certainly fall
into this category, particularly as part of a discourse on
“weird Japan,” in which unusual-seeming aspects of culture
are highlighted as somehow indicative of a generally
bizarre “foreignness” that cannot be penetrated by non
Japanese. No surprise, perhaps, that several English
language websites feature tongue-in-cheek postings on
“bizarre Japanese mythological creatures.”25 Whether the



tone of this exoticization is celebratory or mocking, it tends
to position “the Japanese” and their “beliefs” as special or
unique. Sometimes such characterizations of uniqueness
are embraced by Japanese politicians, cultural
commentators, and scholars who promote concepts of
Nihonjinron or suggest a kind of dangerously nationalist
Japanese exceptionalism.26
I am wary of the fact that yōkai can be used as examples
of a particular Japanese spirit or way of interpreting the
world. This book was written in part to show that the
mysterious creatures of Japanese folklore are, when we
have a sense of their history and cultural context, not so
mysterious after all. Once we know a little of the context,
they start to make sense. Does Japan have more (or
stranger) monsters than other cultures? There is no simple
answer to this question except, perhaps, “It’s complicated.”
Yōkai have as much to do with indigenous kami beliefs as
they do with an exchange of ideas (and languages) with
other cultures, especially those found in China and the
Korean peninsula. And the continued proliferation of yōkai
today is energized not so much by intractable and ancient
cultural beliefs as it is by a vibrant and cutting-edge media
industry. Moreover, as I have discussed, we can pinpoint
several prominent (human) individuals throughout history
who have kept yōkai alive and abundant in the popular
imagination.
Given all this, it is important to think a little about the
broader picture. Even though yōkai are associated with



Japanese culture, they have always also been part of world
culture. The fears and desires and creativity that go into
their creation are human traits found all over the globe.
Certain individual yōkai have parallels in the monsters of
other cultures, but even yōkai that are native or unique to
Japan are also shaped by influences from other places. Just
as the history of Japanese religion or aesthetics or
philosophy is a history of exchange, so too is the history of
yōkai. It is no coincidence that almost every entry on a
yōkai-like creature in the Three Realms references earlier
Chinese texts. And many of those Chinese texts look back
toward other parts of the world. Like all folklore, yōkai
travel across time and space.
But of course the world is even more closely connected
today, and ideas and images travel even more easily (and
faster). Not surprisingly, yōkai flourish in contemporary
media, proliferating on the Internet and in anime and in
computer games. Part of this has to do with transnational
commercial interests: the anime of Studio Ghibli, for
example, and translations such as Nura: Rise of the Yōkai
Clan, and blockbuster films such as The Great Yōkai War
are moneymakers that draw on the cultural capital of the
Japanese supernatural.
Perhaps even more interesting, however, is the informal,
vernacular creativity that yōkai generate. There are
numerous role-playing games based on them, and even
public art shows of “original” yōkai. A quick glance at
DeviantART.com reveals thousands of yōkai images from



artists all around the world, and recently an American
artist published a book called The Night Parade of One
Hundred Demons, based on the idea of hyakkiyagyō and
financed by raising more than eighteen thousand dollars
through Kickstarter in 2011 (even though the goal was only
two thousand dollars!). The second volume raised more
than twenty-seven thousand dollars in 2013.27 Clearly a lot
of people are interested in yōkai, and clearly, also, yōkai
are part of global culture. It is questionable whether we
should even call them Japanese.
But what does it mean when yōkai cross into new places?
In postwar Japan, yōkai became nostalgic icons of an
imagined, more innocent time. For people in countries far
from Japan, perhaps they work in a similarly nostalgic way
today, but by reflecting a desire for an imagined place
called “Japan,” an “otherworld” where mysterious or
“bizarre” creatures still lurk. Whatever the case, wherever
yōkai travel, they speak to a desire of some sort. They mean
something. Which brings me back, finally, to the idea of
language.
Language of Yōkai Redux
Earlier in this book, I suggested that yōkai begin where
language ends. I will amend that thought now. Certainly the
process of yōkai creation starts with the need to express
something for which there are no words; it emerges from
an aporia, a hole in language. But gradually, abstract



phenomena become concrete creatures. Similarly,
somebody might set out to invent a yōkai, giving it a name
and describing its shape and features and behavior. In
either case, named and identified, these
creatures/beings/things can now, like words, be put in their
appropriate place in a dictionary and listed alongside other
yōkai. They are figures of speech.
When I was a child growing up in New York City, one of
my closest friends was from Japan. I remember sitting next
to him one day in first grade as the two of us happily drew
pictures of “monsters.” I don’t recall the details, except
that we engaged in a friendly competition to create
stranger and stranger creatures, and that we laughed until
the teacher told us to be quiet. But most important, I recall
that this experience made our friendship stronger. Looking
back now, I realize that by adding bits and pieces to each
other’s pictures and by coming up with new combinations
and novel shapes, we were using monsters to communicate
in a way that transcended the words we had at our
disposal.
In a sense, then, the creation of yōkai is the creation of
language: with grammar, vocabulary, and even local
dialects. Like all languages, this one is constantly adding
new words to respond to emerging needs, to express new
ideas, or to say old things in fresh ways. It is constantly
changing as different people learn to speak it. Ultimately,
the language of yōkai allows us to talk about the most
intimate of beliefs, about fears and desires, and about the



mundane and the silly. Where once yōkai emerged to fill the
holes in language, to describe the unexplainable, now we
also seek ways to describe yōkai in their many different
manifestations. And as we learn the language of yōkai,
deciphering the various signs out of which it is constructed
and adding new words to it, we hear the voices of people
who lived in the otherworld of the past and we project our
own voices into the otherworld of the future.



PART II
Yōkai Codex



Books are bound, literally: pages are put into a particular
order and sewn together or cemented along the spine so
that they cannot be removed or reordered. And in contrast
to a picture scroll, an individual page of a book, and the
words and images imprinted on it, can be accessed at any
time without having to review what comes before it. That
is, even though the pages are in a sequence, they can be
opened and read at random. A book like this is called a
codex, simply defined as “a collection of sheets of any
material, folded double and fastened together at the back
or spine, and usually protected by covers.”1 During the Edo
period the codex became the most popular written medium
for a flourishing urban and literate culture.
As far as we know, Toriyama Sekien was the first person
to put yōkai into the pages of a book like this—to extract
mysterious creatures and phenomena from folklore,
literature, and earlier picture scrolls and bind them
together in codex form. Because Sekien’s catalogs are
similar in format to the encyclopedias and almanacs of the
time, they had the effect of appearing to be an authoritative
take on yōkai. Even today, despite the fact that we know
Sekien invented many of his yōkai, and that many of his
entries were intended to be tongue in cheek, his catalogs



are still the go-to guides for exploring the Edo-period yōkai
world.
So what does it mean to put a yōkai in a book? One effect
is that it preserves a creature long after its living relevance
may have disappeared. To a certain extent, documenting a
yōkai freezes it in place, stabilizing it in a certain form with
a certain set of behaviors, changing the course of its
evolution, and making it generally more accessible to
people. In Japan, the yōkai “of the book” are the yōkai that
people know. But of course, only a very limited number of
yōkai can fit within the covers of a book. So what of all the
yōkai that are not recorded? One of the yōkai in the pages
that follow is a local kappa-like creature called a gamishiro
that I came across during my fieldwork in Kagoshima. I
have not been able to find it in any “authoritative” book or
dictionary of yōkai, and these days very few young people
in the community have even heard of it. So what of the
thousands of yōkai like this throughout Japan that have
never been captured on paper?
This section, the final and longest of my own book of
yōkai, does not necessarily answer these questions, but it
implicitly explores them. I begin with the simple premise
that, as much as we take this sort of thing for granted in
our daily lives, the ordering and accessing of knowledge is
always a historical and subjective undertaking that reflects
and affects our cognitive approaches to everything we
encounter around us. In the pages that follow, I briefly
discuss the encyclopedic mode and the taxonomy of yōkai.



Then, in the remainder of the book, I present my own
version of an encyclopedic text, a bestiary in which I list
and describe and sometimes illustrate a select portion of
the expansive pantheon of yōkai.



4
The Order of Yōkai
OF FISH AND YŌKAI
The ocean is full of fish. When you look at the opaque
surface of the water, you can’t see them, but you know
they’re down there, everything from gargantuan silver
sided tuna to wormlike fingerlings to deep-sea dwellers
moving like ghosts in the cold darkness. There are blue
bodied sharks and shimmering schools of tropical fish, red
and yellow and luminous indigo, flitting this way and that
with the slightest current. And there are slithering eels and
flat, gliding rays, some of which can make electricity, and
hagfish that secrete gallons of gooey slime when you touch
them.
This is to say nothing of squid and octopi, and shellfish,
and shrimp, and lobsters, and sea urchins, and sea
cucumbers, and plankton, and animals that are not “fish”
but which also live in the ocean, such as whales and
dolphins and sea turtles. The numbers and variety are
overwhelming. How can we sort this all out? How do we



make sense of this morass of shapes and sizes and colors,
of these creatures, with their different habitats and special
characteristics, hidden in another world beneath the
surface of the water?
I start here with questions about fish because, it turns
out, there are actually quite a few similarities between fish
and yōkai. Not only do fish possess all sorts of different
characteristics—some of which, like the hagfish’s ability to
produce slime, seem downright supernatural—but also this
chaotic, jumbled abundance of fish presents similar
challenges to anybody trying to organize them into an
accessible body of knowledge. Whether you are creating a
compendium of information or are just curious about what
kind of fish you caught, there are different ways of
knowing. Humans master and organize knowledge through
a variety of methods.
When I started working on this book in 2012, I was also
doing research on folklore, rituals, and everyday life on an
island in the south of Japan (Shimo-Koshikijima in
Kagoshima Prefecture). As part of learning about daily life,
I helped out on a fishing boat a few days a week. Early in
the morning, just as the sun was rising, we would haul up
nets set just a little offshore. It was the season for horse
mackerel (aji or ma-aji), so on good days we caught a lot of
them, but we also caught lots of mackerel (saba), yellowtail
(buri), and various types of bream (tai). Those were the
most common fish, but really you never knew what you
would find in the nets. Sometimes there were tiny squid or



mahi-mahi (shiira), and once we even caught a moray eel
(utsubo). I was new to this, so I was constantly pestering
my coworkers to explain what each kind of fish was called,
when it was in season, and how it was best eaten (as
sashimi, for example, or dried and salted). This is a kind of
knowledge—what the Japanese call chie—that is learned by
word of mouth and years of experience.
But this information was sometimes confusing. For
example, along with the yellowtail, we often also caught a
similar fish that my colleagues on the boat called hirasu. If
you look up hirasu in a common Japanese dictionary, you
won’t find it. It turns out that hirasu is a local name for a
fish technically called hiramasa, which can be translated
into English as “yellowtail amberjack.” So my first lesson
here was that each fish has a different local name, to say
nothing of the different local ways of preparing it for
dinner.
Moreover, this yellowtail amberjack looks so similar to
the yellowtail that I couldn’t tell the difference—though of
course all the experienced fishermen could. And while
these two fish may look very similar, I was told that, at
certain times of the year, the yellowtail amberjack actually
tastes much better than the yellowtail and therefore is
more desirable and sells for a higher price at the market.
So my other lesson here was that differences, no matter
how subtle, can be meaningful.
The fishermen have acquired all this knowledge, this
chie, through years and years of working in the same



environment and talking with their seniors and their
colleagues. But I was way behind and wanted to catch up,
so I bought a pocket fish dictionary; every entry contained
a photograph of a fish, its “official” name, regional variant
names, description, habitat, and the best ways to eat it. The
book had a thorough index, with both official and regional
names, and it was organized into categories, such as fish
caught from boats, from sandy beaches, and in freshwater.1
All this might seem completely natural, because we have
grown up with dictionaries and encyclopedias and
databases; websites such as Wikipedia are all about
organizing, synthesizing, and making information
accessible. But of course, creating a fish dictionary like this
is really a difficult and profound process. All this
information about sea creatures has been neatly ordered
and made accessible, folded into a convenient and portable
packet. This work of carving order out of chaos is by no
means a natural process. The divisions between types of
fish, the naming of these creatures, distinctions between
them, data on where they live and what they eat, even
information about how tasty they are, come from years of
observation and research and generations of shared
wisdom. And only then did the author of this particular
book have to decide exactly what information to include in
each entry and how to organize the entries. This process of
naming and grouping, of ordering, listing, and describing,
is a concrete way to make sense of the worlds we contend
with every day.



Which brings me back to yōkai. As I argue in the first
part of this book, yōkai are a way to carve something
sensible, believable perhaps, out of the chaos of the world
around us. A particular yōkai can be the metaphoric
embodiment of a vague fear or mysterious phenomenon,
like mists of anxiety merging into a sentient, tangible shape
with a name and a personality. It is not surprising, then,
that there are numerous yōkai dictionaries and
encyclopedias on the market, and several websites
dedicated to just this process of naming, categorizing, and
documenting yōkai. Just like my fish dictionary, many of
these encyclopedias contain illustrations (though usually
not photographs), descriptions of habits and habitats, and
lists of regional names and related phenomena.
TAXONOMY
Everything I describe here is part of the process of
taxonomy, how things are arranged and ordered. Taxonomy
most often refers to the naming and classifying of natural
phenomena such as animals and plants, but it can also be
applied more generally to any kind of object or even to
ideas or abstract concepts. In contemporary scientific
culture, the taxonomy of animals generally follows an
accepted set of principles set out in the International Code
of Zoological Nomenclature, which is an attempt to
systematize the “confusion of names that occurred in the
zoological literature of the early part of the 19th century.”2



Of course, any taxonomy, even one with an international
code, grows out of years of work and interpretation by
people looking for commonalities and differences between
the things under investigation.
In the case of yōkai, there is no universal classification
code or nomenclature. But certainly a lot of attempts have
been made, some more serious than others, to organize
them into a coherent, useful, and accessible system. Each
particular taxonomic effort reflects the concerns and
technology of the historical moment in which it emerged. In
Japan, we can roughly trace these attempts to some early
documents imported from China. One of the oldest of these
is the Shanhaijing (Guideways through Mountains and
Seas; J. Sangaikyō), probably written during the Warring
States Period (475–221 B.C.E.), and brought to Japan by the
tenth century. This text is a geographical compendium, a
kind of atlas with descriptions of strange places and their
unusual inhabitants. Organized by location, a geography
such as this represents one way in which yōkai and other
mysterious things could be, in a sense, put in their proper
places. Guideways through Mountains and Seas does not
focus specifically on each yōkai, but rather it focuses on the
distant places where odd beings happened to reside. Still, it
was a great influence on early Japanese texts and picture
scrolls, many of which include the yōkai it identified.3
As discussed earlier, the Edo period in particular
witnessed the development of an encyclopedic mode of
expression through which the world was divided into



component parts and organized in a comprehensible way.
During this time, Japanese cities were becoming bigger and
bigger, literacy rates were rising, and a lively commercial
book industry was developing.4 Along with fiction and
other works for entertainment, there were all sorts of
almanacs, farming manuals, travel guides, dictionaries, and
compendia. All these books, in the words of historian Mary
Elizabeth Berry, made up a “library of public information”
that served “to examine and order the verifiable facts of
contemporary experience for an open audience of
consumers.”5
Information about yōkai was part of this “library.”
Extracted from stories and beliefs, yōkai were identified as
individual units: artists started painting them in picture
scrolls as separate creatures, each labeled with a name.
And then Toriyama Sekien came along and put them in a
series of books, just like in a real encyclopedia, each
creature with its own separate page, name, and
commentary. Since that time, there have been dozens of
compendia of yōkai. Some of them are serious and
scholarly, others are creative and illustrated, some are for
kids, and still others are firmly tongue in cheek. Even in
English now, there are books about yōkai that take the form
of an encyclopedia—or a “field guide” or “survival guide.”6
And more recently, of course, there are also databases
the digital version of the encyclopedic mode. Some of
these, like the ones produced by Nichibunken, are
professionally curated—even government funded. Others,



like the Gensō dōbutsu no jiten (Dictionary of fantastic
animals), which is in Japanese but is not limited to Japanese
yōkai, are created by knowledgeable enthusiasts.7 Because
of their abundance and diversity, yōkai lend themselves to
this sort of encyclopedic cataloging.
Databases may be particularly handy for accessing
information on yōkai, because their contents can be
searched through keywords. In fact, one of the biggest
challenges for anybody putting together a taxonomy is to
decide what principles should be used in the ordering
process. With animals and plants, the most common forms
of classification come from the Linnaean system, which
organizes the natural world into ranks of species, genus,
family, and so on. In determining how to label a particular
plant or animal, biologists and taxonomists use a variety of
criteria to establish similarities and differences between
specimens. Such determinations are based on everything
from physical appearance and biological makeup to habitat
and other factors.
So how would you do this with yōkai? You could say that,
for example, a kawatarō is the name of a species; the genus
is kappa; and the family is water-dwelling creatures. But of
course, this gets much more confusing with, for example, a
yōkai like the makura-gaeshi (pillow-shifter), whose identity
is commonly described in terms of behavior (i.e., flipping
people’s pillows) rather than physical appearance. Also, of
course, we know that yōkai descriptions and images change
through time—so you would have to choose a manifestation



at one particular moment for your classification. In short, it
would be an interesting exercise to arrange yōkai by means
of a Linnaean system—but certainly a challenging one.
So how have yōkai been ordered? Usually, it seems,
pretty randomly. Sekien breaks up his own books into
several sections, but his criteria for organizing are not
clear. In his first book, Gazu hyakkiyagyō, some of the yōkai
do seem to be placed in relation to each other: for example,
two yōkai associated with rivers, kawauso and kappa, are
on facing pages, as are yamabiko and tengu, both
associated with mountains. But as he produced more and
more yōkai, and their descriptions became increasingly
complex, such connections became harder to pin down.
More recent attempts also demonstrate the difficulty of
figuring out a logical system. Mizuki has produced
numerous encyclopedias and seems to have tried a variety
of methods. In one case, for example, he divides his yōkai
into broad categories that may seem somewhat systematic
but which are ultimately subjective: “Yōkai I Have Met,”
“Celebrity Yōkai,” and “Ghosts and Tsukumogami Types.”
In other books, he lists them in the order of the Japanese
syllabary. Murakami Kenji, too, in his massive yōkai
dictionary, follows a syllabary-based index, a handy system
if you happen to know the name of the yōkai you are
searching for. Another method, which emphasizes the
diversity of yōkai throughout the country, is to list them by
region, as Chiba Mikio does. This may make it difficult to
find immediate connections between “species,” and it also



raises questions not only of how to divide yōkai but also of
how to divide regions of the country. Yet another strategy,
this one employed by Itō Ryōhei, is to create categories
based on place of appearance, such as: “Yōkai of the Rivers
and Bogs,” “Yōkai of the Ocean,” “Yōkai of the Slopes,
Roads, and Mountain Passes,” and “House Yōkai.” This
method differs from a Linnaean system in that it does not
privilege shape or body type and instead emphasizes the
human relationship with yōkai. And most recently, there is
now a 680-page dictionary with over thirteen hundred
entries compiled by more than a hundred researchers,
based on the material recorded in the Nichibunken yōkai
databases. The editors have included different indices so
yōkai can be searched through type and location, without
omitting regional names or squelching their abundance and
diversity.8
A COMPLETELY INCOMPLETE BESTIARY
In short, creating a taxonomy of yōkai is not a simple task;
it often takes a whole committee of researchers and,
ultimately, can never be completely complete. But by
grappling with how best to compartmentalize and order
these diverse beings, we discover both connections and
contradictions and better understand their complexity. The
rest of this book is my own small attempt, embarked upon
with all this in mind, to present yōkai in an encyclopedic
format. Such an undertaking is made all the more



complicated in English because, of course, many readers
may not have a background in Japanese and so will be
unable to look up yōkai names alphabetically. And
unfortunately, there are no standardized English
translations, even for the most common of yōkai (except
perhaps for the kitsune, or fox). So in creating this
compendium here, I have had to make some difficult
decisions about naming, ordering, and which yōkai to
include.
Inclusiveness
The first principle of the encyclopedic mode is to strive for
inclusive knowledge about a subject, and the pages that
follow include dozens of individual yōkai, with dozens more
mentioned in passing. But this only scratches the surface.
As I have stressed, yōkai are characterized by abundance
and infinite variety. Since the space of this book is not
infinite, however, many fine yōkai had to be left out, and I
apologize if the particular one you were looking for does
not appear.
I have of course included the big five: kappa, tengu,
kitsune, tanuki, and oni. These are not only found locally
throughout Japan but also seem to be the most documented
in folklore, literature, and even secondary sources. I have
also included a lot of other major yōkai, particularly those
that are well distributed throughout the country and
generally known by Japanese people today, such as



yamamba, nopperabō, and rokurokubi. At the same time, I
have put in a few very local and all-but-forgotten
phenomena, such as bābū and gamishiro. There are urban
yōkai and rural yōkai, age-old yōkai and recent ones. I have
tried to choose a representative sampling of different types,
but of course, the result remains incomplete. There is just
no way to record them all. Nor, ultimately, would you want
to: this inconclusiveness, the knowledge that there are
always more out there, may be one of the elements that
keep them interesting.
Units
The second principle of the encyclopedic mode entails the
compression of knowledge into self-contained units. For
each entry, I provide a Japanese name, sometimes more
than one, and, when appropriate, an English translation. In
general, each entry outlines the history or context of the
particular yōkai, noting some regional variations with
regard to nomenclature, beliefs, legends, habitat, and
attributes. Some entries are illustrated, either with original
images made for this book or ones borrowed from historical
texts. (I do not include kanji in the entry itself, but at the
end of the codex there is a list of all the yōkai included;
that list contains kanji when it is unusual or helpful for
understanding the character of the yōkai in question.
Otherwise, assume the name is most commonly written in
hiragana or katakana.)



Overall, I strive to provide a sense of each yōkai in its
context and complexity as the product of a process of
storytelling, popular beliefs, and creative innovation.
Because of this, I try to avoid simple characterizations and
generalizations. I emphasize variation and inconclusiveness
even if it means sacrificing concise narratives or neat
definitions.
Especially for the more prominent or well-documented
creatures, entries are detailed and include representative
tales and where they come from. One goal is to
demonstrate that knowledge about yōkai is not set in stone:
it differs from place to place, from person to person, and is
constantly in flux. (In the language of semiotics, we might
say that a particular signifier can point to many different
signifieds.) Ideally, each entry would be a self-contained
unit, but of course, yōkai are tied to each other, and tied to
other ideas, so the borders between entries are porous.
I have also tried to carefully note where I get my data.
Because yōkai are developed through generations of
storytelling, and through layer upon layer of retellings and
reimaginings, information about them can sometimes feel
ungrounded, free floating, unsourced. This is all part of the
dynamic folkloric process, the way material is exchanged
and changed and infused with meaning in the present
tense. One of my goals as a scholar of yōkai, however, is to
present this material, in all its complexity, with as much
documentation and grounding as possible. Readers can
take it from there.



Organization
As noted, there is no perfect way to organize a text like
this, and my own structure is certainly not based on an
“objective” rationale. Instead I embrace the fact that an
author’s subjectivity always informs the content and
organization of what is written. Rather than use body shape
or behavior as governing factors for organizing groups of
yōkai, I have chosen to separate them here into “contact
zones,” the places in which humans and yōkai might come
in contact with each other.9 These are spaces where two
worlds intersect—those zones of uncertainty discussed
earlier.
I begin with the zones most distant from the places
where people usually live, and follow a trajectory inward.
The first zone is the Wilds: mountains and forests in which
human intruders are rare. Next comes Water: ocean and
ponds and rivers, which are often murky and hard to
fathom. Such places can be like little regions of mysterious
nature located right inside the most developed parts of
human culture. And then there is the Countryside: where
humans and the natural world are in constant contact. Next
is Village and City: places of human habitation that are
open and porous to outside incursion. And finally, we enter
the Home: where humans and yōkai may live side by side,
this world and the otherworld overlapping in the most
intimate of spaces. Of course, these groupings are anything
but rigid, and many of the yōkai described here cross from
one zone to another. But in this organization there is a



sense of movement from the distant and external to the
close-at-hand and personal: from that mysterious thing way
out there in the wilds, to this mysterious thing right here at
home.
For convenience, at the end of the codex there is an
alphabetical listing of every yōkai mentioned—including
those only alluded to in passing within an entry for another
creature. As limited as this list may be, at the very least it
underscores the abundance and variety touched upon in
the following pages.
The codex can be used as a reference to look up
individual yōkai. Or the entries in it can be read straight
through, one by one, as you might read the chapters of a
novel. I call it a bestiary because it collects all sorts of
beasts in one place. Medieval bestiaries in Europe were
often infused with symbolism—each animal, real or
imaginary, also indicating something beyond itself and
sometimes representing a moral of some sort. The yōkai
here may not articulate specific morals, but they are
symbolically charged. Yōkai are real and, at the same time,
imagined; they are literal and figurative, simultaneously
themselves and metaphors. Each yōkai recorded here, and
its connections with the others, is open to individual
interpretation. Read with this in mind, individual entries
may reveal hidden meanings; and read together one after
another, they may also tell a larger story.



5
Wilds
All the yōkai in this chapter are associated in one way or
another with natural landscapes, especially forests and
mountains. They are creatures or phenomena that humans
may encounter when they venture into the woods or walk
along a mountain pass. A lone traveler in a distant part of
the forest, for example, may bump into a nurikabe or
mikoshi-nyūdō. Some of these yōkai—such as tengu and
yamamba—live in the mountains but also may descend
specifically to visit the habitations of humans. Wherever
they are encountered, however, all these yōkai possess a
certain wildness: they are undomesticated expressions of
nature, denizens of a wild territory beyond human agency.
KODAMA
Tree Spirit



Trees are prominent features of the landscape throughout
Japan; large, unusual, or old trees are often considered
sacred. In shrines throughout the country it is common to
see a shimenawa rope draped around the trunk of an
ancient tree, indicating a divine connection. Belief systems
associated with trees are complex, and they vary depending
on the region and the particular tree.



F I G U R E 3 . Kodama. Original illustration by Shinonome Kijin.
The kodama, which means “tree spirit,” is not set in
behavior or appearance. Toriyama Sekien uses a kodama as
the opening image in his first catalog of yōkai, completed in



1776—making it the first yōkai in his famous series. The
picture shows an old man and woman who seem to have
emerged out of a crooked old pine tree. The entry itself is
unusual because it is spread across two pages, rare for
Sekien, and because it is the only entry in the entire
volume that includes commentary. The caption simply
reads, “It is said that when a tree reaches the age of one
hundred, it has a kami that will show its form.”1 In more
recent iconography, the kodama appears in Miyazaki
Hayao’s anime Mononoke hime (Princess Mononoke; 1997)
as a multitude of cute ball-like creatures that make a
clicking sound; this imagery, one scholar suggests, may be
based on the ninmenju, another kind of arboreal yōkai.2
In Japanese, the word kodama also means “echo.” This
usage may be directly linked to the yōkai kodama—from a
belief that an echo is the spirit of the woods responding to
a call.3 Another yōkai, the yamabiko, is also associated
with “echo.” Given that an echo is an animated voice that
seems to emerge from the forest or the mountains, the
echo-yōkai connection is not surprising. In contemporary
Japan, the word kodama is now closely associated with the
Kodama Shinkansen (bullet train), presumably named for
the echo rather than the yōkai.
ONI
Demon or Ogre



A ubiquitous character in Japanese folklore, religion, and
popular culture, the oni may be variously translated into
English as “demon,” “devil,” or “ogre.” Found in written
documents as far back as the eighth century, oni feature in
numerous folktales and legends and, more recently, in
manga, anime, and film. Historically there is a wide variety
of oni images, but in contemporary Japanese culture oni are
commonly imagined as large, powerful, frightening,
humanlike male figures with red, blue, black, or yellow
faces, clawed hands, and sharp, protruding fangs. They
have horns, carry an iron staff or club, and wear a loincloth
(fundoshi) made of tiger skin. While many of these details
vary, the horns—whether a single protrusion or two or
more—are the creature’s most definitive feature in the
modern Japanese imagination.4
Although there is some variation, the oni is generally
portrayed in narratives and ritual contexts as a nasty
otherworldly being who threatens humans; he is a person
shaped antiperson, encapsulating everything that imperils
humans and human society. As one scholar notes tersely,
“The oni is a presence that excludes human nature
[ningensei].”5 There are also numerous examples of
humorous, stupid, innocuous, and even benevolent oni, but
these are the anomalies, the ones that stand out because
the “premise” is that the oni’s general intentions are
negative; oni are “constructed as antisociety and
antimoral.”6



The word oni is found in the earliest-known Japanese
texts, including the Kojiki, Nihonshoki, and various fudoki
(local gazetteers). Although the pronunciation—oni—seems
to be a Japanese construction, the kanji currently
associated with it is inconsistent in these early texts and
became established only during the Heian period. (At that
time, the reading ki also came to be used in compound
words.)
The earliest images of oni (or figures that would come to
be associated with oni) are seen in Buddhist depictions of
hell, such as the late-twelfth-century Jigoku zōshi (Hell
scrolls).7 As the image developed it was probably also
influenced by early pictures of Raijin (the thunder deity), as
found in, for example, the thirteenth-century illustrated
Kitanotenjin engi emaki. Portrayal of the oni as a fierce,
demonic, violent horned figure has remained remarkably
consistent since these early illustrations. Similarly, its
characterization as a “frightening presence” has been
constant since its earliest mention in writing.8 Whatever
the absolute origins of the oni concept and image,
influences on the development of the figure have varied
and include Chinese, native Japanese, Buddhist, and
Onmyōdō sources.9
Historically, oni were conflated with yōkai more
generally—invoked as generic signifiers for all sorts of
frightening or unknown monsters. For example, the
medieval-period expression hyakkiyagyō contains the kanji
for oni (pronounced ki) and translates as “night procession



of one hundred oni.” But in most cases, the oni in the
procession are interchangeable with yōkai more generally;
that is, they are not only anthropomorphic demonlike
creatures but also monstrous beings of all shapes and sizes.
Through time, however, the oni eventually developed into
a specific figure (a single type of yōkai) characterized by a
number of traits that appear again and again in
visualizations and descriptions. These include a fierce
countenance, a large muscular body stripped to the waist, a
nasty temper, an association with lightning, and a penchant
for eating people. In many images, oni have only three
fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, all of
them with sharp, clawlike nails. Sometimes oni are
portrayed with a third eye in the middle of the forehead. As
mentioned earlier, they commonly have ox horns on their
heads and wear tiger-pelt loincloths. These features
suggest an association with the north-east direction, known
in Japanese as ushi-tora, literally “ox-tiger,” a direction
linked with the kimon, or “oni-gate,” through which
misfortune was said to enter a household or community.10
The specific visual imagery associated with the oni may
have taken shape in response to vague fears and invisible
dangers. That is, the image of the oni serves as a floating
signifier applicable to any number of threats to human
society. One interpretation of the oni’s origins, for example,
is that the word signified an epidemic; the physical body of
the oni thus became a visible image of the invisible yet
terrifying spread of disease.



Similarly, oni can be interpreted historically as
visualizations of otherness and the dangers associated with
it. Almost human in form, but at the same time imperiling
all that is human, oni represent everything foreign and
mysterious that threatens the status quo. Varying
interpretations suggest that these humanlike supernatural
beings may reflect fear of historically marginalized
populations, such as shugendō religious practitioners, who
were “outsiders” living in the mountains and engaging in
mysterious practices. Similarly, oni may have been
associated with communities of blacksmiths, metalworkers,
and miners who lived on the outskirts of villages and were
believed to possess—along with their ability, literally, to
shape metal—supernatural powers for safe childbirth. As a
kind of antihegemonic cultural metaphor, then, the
presumably negative and destructive oni can also assume a
positive and creative role as antiestablishment rebel or
underdog, the marginalized or disenfranchised Other who
challenges the entrenched sociopolitical order and
becomes a driving force in shaping history.11
This transgressive but ambiguous role is evident in one
of the most famous oni legends, the story of Shuten dōji,
literally, “Sake-Drinking Boy.” As with all folk narratives,
there is more than one version, but the oldest extant
written account is the so-called Ōeyama text (early
fourteenth century) in which the demonic protagonist
resides on Mount Ōe, on the edge of the Heian capital,
present-day Kyoto. In the story, the time period is not



specified, but references to real people hint that it probably
took place around the late tenth or early eleventh century.
The capital is plagued by demons abducting young
women, including the daughter of an important
government official. Eventually, a divination is performed
and it is determined that the demon culprits reside on
Mount Ōe. The emperor orders the great warrior Minamoto
no Yorimitsu (Raikō) and his lieutenants to subdue the
demons.
Raikō and his men pray to various Buddhist deities, and
then, disguised as mountain ascetics, they head into the
hills in search of the oni’s hideout. Along the way, they
meet three old men who explain that the lead oni, Shuten
dōji, is particularly fond of alcohol; the old men give Raikō
and his entourage a container of magical sake that is
poisonous to oni but beneficial to humans. It turns out that
these men are actually deities, incarnations of the very
gods to whom Raikō and his men had prayed. After
pointing the warriors in the direction of the oni’s lair, the
deities disappear into thin air.
Traveling upstream, the warriors meet a young woman
who provides them with more information, explaining that
Shuten dōji “has light-red skin and is tall with disheveled
short hair. He has a human appearance during the day, but
at night he transforms into a ten-foot-tall demon whose
countenance is truly horrible. He always drinks sake. Once
he becomes intoxicated, he forgets everything.” The
warriors eventually come to the iron palace in which the



oni and his demon army live. Through a mixture of good
fortune and cunning, Raikō and his men end up eating and
drinking with Shuten dōji and his henchmen, sharing the
magical liquor, until all the oni become drunk and
disoriented and, eventually, pass out. In repose, Shuten dōji
himself expands to twice his size: “His horns were now
protruding through the spiked red bristles on his scalp, his
beard had become wildly shaggy, and his eyebrows were
overgrown. His limbs had become heavy and thick, like
those of a bear.”
With the assistance of the three deities, who appear
again just when they are needed, Raikō cuts off Shuten
dōji’s head—which at first continues to attack and bite even
after being separated from its body. And then, in a dramatic
battle, the warriors dispatch all the other oni. Entering
deeper into the compound, the men discover a scene of
horror, replete with skeletons, pickled human flesh, and a
woman with severed limbs but still alive, who they vow to
come back for later. Raikō and his men then lead the
young, abducted women to safety, reuniting them with their
families in the capital, where Raikō himself is celebrated as
a heroic warrior.
In this extended and theatrical narrative, Shuten dōji and
his fellow oni are vicious and unpleasant to be sure, but
they can also be read in a more sympathetic light. They are,
after all, somewhat hospitable and good-natured when
banqueting with the warriors, they fight honorably and
well, and ultimately, they fall victim to the warriors’



deception. Indeed, as Shuten dōji himself exclaims before
his head is cut off, “How sad, you priests! You said you do
not lie. There is nothing false in the words of demons.”12 In
one sense, they might be seen as antiestablishment rebels
—no coincidence, perhaps, that the women they kidnap all
seem to be the daughters of government officials. Shuten
dōji himself can certainly be interpreted in terms of
otherness: a being unable to live within society and driven
into an isolated existence literally on the margins of the
seat of power (the capital).13
While the Shuten dōji story is considered a classic
literary text, many legends and folktales concerning oni
were passed down orally in local communities and reflect a
much more popular approach, in which oni are outwitted or
subdued not by great warriors but by cunning common
folk. A tale collected in Yamanashi Prefecture, for example,
tells of an excruciatingly poor mother who can no longer
afford to feed her three sons, and who reluctantly abandons
them in the forest. The children seek shelter in a hut, but
the old woman living there tells them that the house
belongs to an oni, who will soon be coming home. Sure
enough, a moment later they hear him coming, and the old
woman quickly hides the boys in a storage pit. Sensitive to
the odor of human flesh, the oni is immediately suspicious;
the old woman explains that three boys had come, but had
left as soon as they heard he was coming. The oni proceeds
to put on his magic boots, which allow him to travel many
miles with each step, and dashes out to look for them. Try



as he might, however, he cannot find them anywhere, and
eventually he concludes that he has gone too far. Deciding
to wait for them to come his way, he lies down to take a
nap.
Meanwhile, the old woman instructs the boys to escape
out the back door, and they run off. Eventually, they hear a
sound like the thunder god and realize they have come to
the place where the giant oni lies fast asleep, snoring. The
youngest brother decides to steal the oni’s magical boots,
which he manages to do—very carefully—while the
slumbering demon mumbles something about mice. The
boy gives the boots to the oldest brother, who puts them
on, ties his brothers to his back, and flies away with them.
Without his boots, the oni cannot catch them, and the
brothers soon escape to the safety of human habitations,
where “they worked very hard and helped their mother.”14
The tale is lighthearted, to be sure, and it features an oni
who eats flesh but is at the same time a bit goofy, as in the
typical “numbskull” tales found in folklore of cultures
around the world. But as with the Shuten dōji legend, it is
also a tale of conquest and escape from mortal harm.
The most famous of all Japanese folktales, the story of
Momotarō (Peach Boy), presents a similar situation, in
which oni are defeated. In this case, a boy born from a
peach and raised by an old couple decides to travel to Oni
Island (Oni-ga-shima) to conquer its demonic inhabitants.
His parents supply him with energy-giving kibi-dango
(millet dumplings), and he sets off on his quest, acquiring



along the way a loyal entourage made up of a dog,
pheasant, and monkey. Upon arriving at Oni Island, the
small band of warriors, fortified by Japan’s finest millet
dumplings, easily defeat the oni, making them pledge never
to be bad again and receiving all sorts of treasure.15
The tale of an exceedingly courageous boy defeating a
band of terrifying demons is a gratifying story in which the
underdog wins and good triumphs over evil. Because of this
relatively simple structure, the narrative lends itself to
allegorical interpretation and manipulation; it is not
surprising that this tale in particular was adapted for early
twentieth-century textbooks and for propaganda during
Japan’s colonial period and the Pacific War, when the allied
troops were portrayed as the dangerous demonic Other. In
one 1942 film, Oni Island is identified as Hawaii.16
Female Oni
The oni I have described here are primarily male figures;
this is the imagery commonly associated with them in Japan
today. But historically, as the embodiment of anger and
resentment, oni have also often assumed female form. In
fact, perhaps the earliest known oni-like figures are the
Yomotsu-shikome, the “hags of Yomi,” who appear in the
Kojiki and Nihonshoki. These demonic women chase
Izanagi from the underworld after he has glimpsed his
deceased wife, Izanami, as a rotting corpse in which
“maggots were squirming and roaring.”17



While the word oni is not actually used for these hags of
Yomi, it does appear during the medieval period, in a tale
from a Buddhist setsuwa collection called Kankyo no tomo
(A companion in solitude), believed to have been compiled
in 1222 by the priest Keisei Shōnin.18 The tale relates an
event that “took place not too long ago in the province of
Mino.” A young woman is neglected by her lover from a
distant province. She quietly gives up eating and takes to
her bed, until “one day she took some millet jelly from a
container lying nearby. She tied her hair up into five knots
and smeared some jelly on them; she then let them dry so
they would look like horns. Then, putting on a red skirt, she
quietly ran away that evening.”
After some thirty years, word spreads that there is a
demon living in an old temple, who has been wreaking
havoc in several villages. Finally, the villagers burn the
temple, and from the flames runs “a creature with five
horns, wearing a red skirt, bent at the hips and looking
indescribably frightening.” The oni identifies herself,
confessing that she had indeed murdered the man who had
deserted her. “After that,” she continues, “no matter how
much I tried, I could not regain my former physical self.” In
a sense, by not only taking on the superficial form of a
demon but also actually acting demonically—that is,
committing murder—she has transformed herself
irrevocably into a demon whose very existence “is
extremely painful.” In tears, she eventually leaps into the
fire and dies. The tale is one of pathos and sadness and, as



one scholar puts it, “reveals an understanding of the oni as
ultimately lonely and pitiful, and with human pain despite
her transformation.”19
This particular Buddhist tale seems to be related to a
number of later, similar narratives, including one found in a
version of The Tale of the Heike (fourteenth century) and
the Noh play The Iron Crown (fifteenth century). In all
these cases the woman’s transformation into an oni comes
about as a result of inordinate passion and jealousy. Her
internal state of mind, one of anger and resentment, causes
her body to change—often through purposeful and
sustained effort—into the body of a demon. It is a profound
and presumably permanent transformation that makes
visible an invisible emotion—in this case, rage. As pitiable
and human as this emotion may be, it is expressed by the
oni’s deeply antihuman behavior.
Oni in Festival and Ritual
Oni are a lively presence in contemporary Japanese ritual
and festival life. Particularly on New Year’s Eve, or a date
known as Koshōgatsu (Little New Year) observed around
January 15, oni-like figures feature in local observances in
a number of small communities, especially in the Tohoku
region. The most famous version of this ritual is called
Namahage and takes place on the Oga Peninsula of Akita
Prefecture. Young men from the local community dress in
straw raincoats and demon masks and tromp through the



snow from house to house, receiving offerings of food and
drink from the residents and chasing and scaring the kids
of the household. The origins of Namahage and similar
rituals, including summer rituals observed in the Ryukyu
Islands of Okinawa Prefecture, are unknown, and there is
much debate about whether the frightening figures are oni,
kami, or some other presence. Whatever the case, however,
it is clear that the current incarnation of these figures has
been deeply influenced by oni iconography and behavior.20
A much more common and widespread oni-related ritual
is the Setsubun holiday observed in early February. Strictly
speaking, setsubun refers to a “joint” in the year when one
season changes into another, so there are four Setsubun
annually; in Japan, however, the only one still observed to
any extent is in February, the day before risshun, or the
first day of spring (according to the old calendrical system).
So Setsubun is much like New Year’s Eve, a dividing point
between the old year and the new and therefore a ritually
meaningful moment of transition. This is a crack in the flow
of time, a potentially dangerous bridge between one period
and another, during which both good and bad spirits might
enter. Accordingly, a custom found throughout Japan is to
scatter beans around the house or throw them out windows
and doors, shouting, “Out with oni; in with good fortune”
(Oni wa soto; fuku wa uchi). The actual practice varies with
region and family tradition, but the notion of
simultaneously inviting in good fortune and banishing bad
(i.e., oni) is generally consistent. So too is the power of



beans (usually roasted soybeans); during this time
throughout Japan, supermarkets and convenience stores
sell small packets of beans expressly for banishing oni.21
The origins of the Setsubun ritual are likely a
combination of Buddhist, Onmyōdō, and popular religious
practices. The expulsion of oni is related to a purification
ceremony called tsuina, probably of Onmyōdō origins,
which was enacted to cleanse the palace before the
emperor’s appearance on the eve of the new year. The
practice entails banishing bad spirits and warding off evil
for the coming year through a variety of symbolic gestures,
such as shooting arrows in four directions and striking a
shield with a staff.
In the modern era, tsuina has been revived at various
shrines and temples. Currently, every year at the Yoshida
Shrine in Kyoto, for example, tens of thousands of people
gather to witness a tsuina ceremony featuring three large
(and somewhat comical-looking) red, blue, and yellow oni,
who dance and roar at the crowd but eventually leave
weakened and cowed, having been conquered by the ritual.
The Rozan Temple in Kyoto also holds a similar ritual
presentation to banish disease and bad fortune, in which
red, green-blue, and black oni perform a slow dance of
intimidation and eventually depart, defeated and
submissive. After they leave, temple officials throw lucky
beans to the throngs of visitors.
Similar ceremonies involving humans wearing oni
costumes are enacted throughout Japan on Setsubun. This



visualization—the transformation of the invisible vapors of
pestilence, famine, and all sorts of bad fortune into a
visible, embodied form—is critical to the oni’s
pervasiveness in Japan. While the medieval version of the
tsuina ritual most likely only suggested oni (that is, the oni
themselves were never visible), the oni of the modern
Yoshida Shrine ritual have horns and wear tiger-skin
loincloths, at once reflecting and contributing to the oni
image in the contemporary imagination. Catching a glimpse
of an oni is one of the most exciting aspects of the
experience; people stand in place for hours before the
ritual begins, children sit on parents’ shoulders, and
amateur photographers with massive telephoto lenses
position themselves atop stepladders throughout the shrine
grounds. Interestingly, when the tsuina ceremony was first
reintroduced at the Yoshida Shrine in the twentieth
century, it garnered little public attention. Only later, when
the shrine staff decided to make the oni visible, did tourists
flock to see it.22

Komatsu Kazuhiko writes that in his own family version
of Setsubun, he used to put on a paper oni mask and run
through the house while his wife and daughter threw beans
at him. Rather than aiming at an imagined but invisible oni,
he notes, his family found it was “much more fun and easily
understandable” to throw beans at an oni they could
actually see.23 This simple family anecdote reflects the
same logic found in making oni visible at public events,
such as those enacted at Yoshida Shrine and Rozan Temple.
It also reflects the process by which generations of artists
have illustrated oni, and storytellers have described them,
making the dangerous, threatening, fearsome things
around us into visible embodied beings—and accordingly
subject to efforts to control them.
In one form or another, then, oni play a role in thousands
of folktales, legends, festivals, and customs throughout
Japan. While it would be dangerous to generalize, we can
certainly say that many of these—from the Shuten dōji
narrative, to Momotarō, to the enactment at Yoshida Shrine
—involve the triumph of human over oni. Sometimes this
triumph is accomplished by courage and strength,
sometimes by cunning or deceit, and sometimes by dumb
luck, but if oni are the Other of the human, embodying the
fears and dangers of worldly existence, then their defeat
in narrative and ritual—reflects a symbolic triumph of
human order over chaos. At the same time, the oni’s failure
makes the creature seem somewhat comical and even
loveable. In contemporary Japan, the negative, terrifying



image of the oni coexists happily with a more cheerful,
amiable image found in media of all sorts and used as an
advertising icon for a wide range of products.
YA M A B I K O
Mountain Echo
The yamabiko is said to be responsible for the echo that
answers when you shout into the mountains. The word
yamabiko actually means “echo,” and it is unclear whether
the word came before the yōkai, or the yōkai led to the
creation of the word. Toriyama Sekien portrays the
yamabiko as a floppy-looking, monkeylike creature sitting
atop a high stony peak. The kanji characters are not the
standard ones associated with the word or the reading;
rather they might be translated literally as “spirit of the
valley reverberation.” Similar yamabiko are pictured in
several Edo-period picture scrolls, so it is likely that it was
a well-known yōkai at the time.24

Yamabiko is also the name of a Shinkansen train running
between Tokyo and the Tohoku region. Presumably, like the
Kodama Shinkansen, which similarly means echo and
similarly references a yōkai, the Yamabiko Shinkansen was
named for the echo and not the yōkai.
TSUCHIGUMO



Earth Spider
The word tsuchigumo, literally “earth spider,” appears in
the Kojiki and Nihonshoki as well as in various fudoki, such
as the Fudoki of Hizen Province. In these mythohistorical
texts, tsuchigumo seems to have been used as a derogatory
and demonizing label for the indigenous inhabitants of
Japan. That is, the people writing the texts used the term to
negatively describe the natives they were conquering; they
portrayed them as having short bodies and long arms and
legs, and as living in holes in the ground.
Over time, the image of the tsuchigumo shifted, and it
developed into a murderous yōkai not directly connected
with these indigenous people. From the Kamakura period
onward, the tsuchigumo appeared in texts and legends in
which it was subdued by the gallantry of a human hero
most famously the well-known demon-slayer Raikō.25 The
fourteenth-century Tsuchigumo-zōshi, for example, tells
how Raikō and his warrior companion Watanabe no Tsuna
kill a tsuchigumo, which is illustrated as a zoologically
realistic but gigantic spider surrounded by a host of smaller
spiders. They cut off the tsuchigumo’s head and slice open
its belly, out of which pours 1,990 skulls of its victims.26
Stories concerning Raikō and the tsuchigumo have been
made into a Noh play and a Kabuki drama, both called
Tsuchigumo.
During the late Edo period, the great ukiyoe-woodblock
print artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1797–1861) drew on the



popular knowledge of the tsuchigumo to create a famous
triptych titled Minamoto Raikō kōkan tsuchigumo saku
yōkai no zu (1843). Raikō is shown asleep in the
tsuchigumo’s den, surrounded by hundreds of yōkai in a
hyakkiyagyō-style display of variety and abundance.
Though the artist’s intentions are unknown, the painting
was interpreted at the time as a satire against the
Tokugawa government, particularly in response to the
unpopular Tempo Reforms of 1841–1843. Viewers of the
painting associated specific yōkai with specific individuals;
the spider’s lair itself may have been a reference to the
sticky web of Tokugawa rule.27 In their earliest
appearance in ancient texts, tsuchigumo were invoked for
their metaphoric power to demonize the people being
conquered; in Kuniyoshi’s triptych, they are still used
metaphorically, but this time by the folk to demonize the
rulers.

TENGU
Mountain Goblin
One of the best known of all yōkai, the tengu has played a
long and varied role in Japanese history, religion, literature,
and folklore. Often characterized as a “mountain goblin,”
tengu tend to have birdlike characteristics and superlative
martial arts skills and are often associated with Buddhism



and mountain ascetic practices. Even today, there are
mountain shrines and festivals that honor tengu.
There are two types of tengu. The first is the karasu
tengu, literally a “crow tengu,” which is a birdlike creature
with wings, beaked mouth, and the ability to fly. Despite the
word crow, karasu tengu are often portrayed as birds of
prey, particularly tonbi (kites). During the Edo period, the
karasu tengu was gradually supplanted by a more
humanlike creature—tall, dressed like a Buddhist monk or
other religious practitioner, and featuring a long, bulbous,
red nose. This long-nosed tengu is the version most
commonly depicted in Japanese culture today. In some
cases, karasu tengu are portrayed as lieutenants to this
distinguished, long-nosed figure.
Tengu literally means “celestial dog” or “heavenly
hound” (Ch. tian gou), and the same combination of kanji is
found in various early Chinese texts, where it refers to a
comet or star or possibly an “enormous dog-shaped
meteor.”28 In Japan, the word is first found in the
Nihonshoki, in an entry for the year 637, in which it is
recorded that “a great star floated from East to West, and
there was a noise like that of thunder.” A monk explains
that this is not a shooting star but rather a “Celestial Dog,
the sound of whose barking is like thunder.”29 Despite the
continued use of the “dog” kanji, however, subsequent
references to tengu in Japan never actually describe it as
looking or acting doglike; rather it is almost always



depicted as anthropomorphic or avian (or a mixture of
both).
It is impossible to unpack the exact process by which a
word meaning “heavenly hound” and indicating an
astronomical occurrence gradually came to signify a long
nosed monk with wings, but it is clear that this
transmogrification reflects a mixture of historical, religious,
and popular influences. For example, the avian image of the
tengu may be associated in some way with the Garuda, a
deific bird figure that features prominently in both Hindu
and Buddhist beliefs, and which most likely entered Japan
through China—along with Buddhism itself. But just as
Buddhism has gone through many changes in its long
journey across continents, so too tengu, and the meanings
and images associated with them, have altered with
different historical circumstances.
During the Heian period, tengu were thought of as
mysterious forces residing in the mountains. Similar to
mono-no-ke, they were amorphous malignant spirits that
could cause illness or war or torment an individual.30
There are few records of what they might have looked like
during this time: generally they were invisible, but on
occasion one might appear as a bird or monk.
It wasn’t until the Kamakura period that tengu really
started to acquire more established characteristics.
Considered after-death incarnations of emperors or dead
warriors, they would appear as malevolent birdlike
creatures, monks, or yamabushi (mountain ascetics),



descending from the mountains to torment the powers that
be. In the Taiheiki (Chronicle of great peace; late
fourteenth century), for example, twelfth-century emperor
Sutoku, who was banished to a remote province, is
described as a kite plotting with a troop of demons and
tengu how best to disrupt humanity.31 It was also during
this time that tengu took on a more profound relationship
with Buddhism; in particular they were associated with the
concept of ma, or evil—that which hinders a person on the
path toward enlightenment.32
Some of the setsuwa collected in the late Heian-period
Tales of Times Now Past tell of tengu who possess (and
teach) supernatural powers called gejutsu (outside
technique): non-Buddhist magic that was deceptive and
could be used for nefarious purposes. Although tengu
might appear as accomplished monks, in reality their
powers were false and would not lead to enlightenment.
But tengu, like so many yōkai, are ambiguous. In one tale,
for instance, a mountain ascetic is called upon to heal an
ailing emperor. The ascetic demonstrates amazing magical
powers, rapidly curing the emperor. But the emperor’s
priests, having studied the way of the Buddha, are
suspicious of the ascetic’s uncanny abilities and set about
directing incantations toward him: “Suddenly the ascetic
hurtled out through his curtains and crashed to the floor,
where he lay sprawled on his back. ‘Help!’ he shrieked.
‘Good sirs, save me, please! All these years on Kōzen I’ve
worshipped the tengu and prayed to them to make me



famous. And it worked, you know, because I was called
here to the palace! But what an awful mistake it was! I’ve
learned my lesson now, yes I have! Please save me, oh
please!’”33 Although the ascetic had followed the false
path of the tengu in order to become famous, his curing of
the emperor appears genuine. While the tengu’s power may
not be in accord with Buddhism and may never lead to
enlightenment, in this example at least it nonetheless
proves effective (and beneficial).
There developed at this time a concept called Tengu-dō,
the Way of Tengu, or the Realm of Tengu, which was “a
realm reserved for Buddhist practitioners who had failed to
overcome the temptations of evil.”34 A text called Hirasan
kojin reitaku, for example, records a fascinating dialogue
between a monk and a tengu. The tengu, speaking through
a young woman he has possessed, tells the monk about the
otherworldly realm of the Tengu-dō and its inhabitants
(including some former emperors). In fine zoological detail,
he also describes tengu themselves as being the size of ten
year-old children, having human bodies and heads, short
tails, bird legs, and wings about a yard long.35 In disputes
between different Buddhist temples and sects, sometimes
one faction would negatively represent the priests of
another by conflating them with tengu. Portraying a monk
of an opposing temple as a tengu was a way to demonize
(tengu-ize?) him and imply that his teachings were
dangerous or deceptive.36



Tengu, Yoshitsune, and the Arts of the Warrior
At the same time, we can also imagine how tengu might
become potent symbols of the underdog, representing a
rebellious, antiauthoritarian spirit. It is perhaps in this
context that they became famous for knowing secret
martial arts techniques. Most famously, it is said that tengu
trained Minamoto no Yoshitsune, one of the great warriors
of Japanese history. Yoshitsune was the younger brother of
Minamoto no Yoritomo, the leader of the victorious Genji
forces during the Genpei War (1180–1185), the great civil
conflict that led to the founding of the Kamakura
government. As a Genji general, Yoshitsune was famous for
his military skills, which, according to legend, he learned
from tengu when he lived as a child at Kurama Temple in
(current-day) Kyoto. This explanation for his military
prowess seems to have become part of popular cultural
imagination quite early. The Kamakura-period Heiji
monogatari (The tale of Heiji), for example, notes simply
that “it is told that Yoshitsune night after night was taught
the manual of arms by a Tengu . . . in Kurama-yama. That
was the reason why he could run and jump beyond the
limits of human power.”37
The relationship between the tengu and Yoshitsune, or
Ushiwaka as he was called as a child, has been elaborated
in a Noh play, Kurama tengu, and in a lesser known
dramatic-literary form called kōwakamai, from the
Muromachi period. This latter work, titled Miraiki
(Chronicle of the future), opens with Ushiwaka training by



himself every evening in a wooded area behind Kurama
Temple. Some tengu spot him there and at first resent his
intrusion into their territory. But when they recognize that
he is training to avenge the death of his father, one tengu
says to the others: “We are known by the name of tengu
there is a reason for this. We were humans long ago, but
studying well the dharma we felt there was nobody more
knowledgeable, and because we swelled with pride, we
could not become Buddhas and fell into the Way of Tengu
[Tengu-dō]. But even though this pride caused us to fall
into this path, there is no reason we should not know pity.
So let us help Ushiwaka, teach him the method of the tengu
so he can attack his father’s enemy.”
And so, appearing to him as yamabushi, the tengu invite
Ushiwaka back to their dwelling place. Ushiwaka is
suspicious of these monklike figures but, feeling
adventurous, agrees to accompany them. He is soon
spirited away to a mountain he has never before seen: a
beautiful place, thickly wooded, with rocks towering
majestically, the fragrance of flowers, and the sound of a
waterfall. They enter a magnificent temple, where a
hundred tengu are playing musical instruments. Ushiwaka
joins them for a wonderful meal with foods from the
mountains and the rivers, flavored with all kinds of spices.
The tengu (who presumably still appear as monks or
yamabushi) then proceed to enact a kind of play, in which
one by one they assume roles of key players in the Genpei
conflict, for which Ushiwaka is training. Essentially they



perform the future for him, explaining his own role in the
conflict and even informing him that, after the last battle,
he will fall out of favor with his older brother. All their
predictions, of course, are accurate: indeed, the reader or
viewer of Chronicle of the Future would already know that
Yoshitsune would end up being killed, infamously, by his
older brother. Interestingly, however, there is no explicit
military training involved in the tale—perhaps simply
receiving this vision of the future is enough to make
Ushiwaka a superior warrior. When the tengu have finished
their tale, they give the boy a small iron ball as a token of
his visit, and then they disappear. Suddenly Ushiwaka finds
himself on a branch of a pine tree behind the temple. He
thinks, “Well, I was tricked by tengu.”38
The tengu here, and in the Noh play as well, are
portrayed as generally benevolent creatures eager to assist
Ushiwaka in his fight for justice; here we see the more
helpful side of their character. Whether this reflects a
general change in attitude toward tengu or not is difficult
to ascertain, but it clearly demonstrates the tengu’s deep
involvement with the human world.
Spiriting Away
During the Edo period, tengu developed into the long
nosed, winged, monklike form for which they are most
famous today, a shift in appearance that scholars cannot
clearly explain.39 Perhaps one reason for this change,



however, was their increasing identification with humans
and the workings of humanity, as if the tengu realm were a
strange mirror of the human world. Indeed, reflecting the
highly structured society of Tokugawa-period Japan, tengu
were portrayed hierarchically, with the human-shaped,
long-nosed tengu, called daitengu (big tengu), flanked by a
posse of birdlike karasu tengu called kotengu (small tengu).
It was also during this period that tengu became
increasingly associated with mountain worship and deeply
embedded in all manner of local folk belief. They were
often invoked as an explanation for mysterious happenings.
The sound of a tree falling in the forest, for example, might
be attributed to the machinations of a tengu and called
tengu-daoshi (tengu knocking-down). A loud guffaw
echoing through the forest was called tengu-warai (tengu
laugh).40
Other times, tengu might cause real mischief. In a
certain location in Gifu City, for example, it was said that a
tengu made his home in a large pine tree. If a fisherman
wanted to go fishing nearby, the tengu would throw rocks
at him in order to get him to reconsider. And if that did not
stop him, the tengu would proceed to overturn his boat.41
Most famously and frighteningly, tengu were often the
perpetrators of something called kamikakushi: kidnapping
by a god, translatable as “spiriting away,” or more literally,
“hiding by a deity.” The details of such occurrences vary,
but usually the story goes like this: A young boy or
adolescent suddenly disappears. His family and the



villagers search frantically but to no avail. Then, some time
later, he shows up in a strange place—in a tree, or in the
eaves of a house—dazed but otherwise unharmed.
Sometimes he is able to recount a story of being abducted
by a stranger, usually an older man, who took him off to
distant places.

tengu). Original illustration by Shinonome Kijin.



A story from Takayama in Gifu Prefecture, for example,
tells of a boy employed by a merchant family. The boy
receives a new pair of geta (wooden sandals) from his
master and plans to wear them that evening. However, his
master warns him that if he wears his new geta in the
evening, “a tengu will take him away.” But the boy is so
thrilled to have the new footwear that he surreptitiously
puts them on anyway and strolls out into the street—and is
not seen again. When his master realizes he has
disappeared, a big commotion ensues and a troop of people
is enlisted to search. Finally, about a week later, they find
the boy standing on a bridge, looking exhausted. He
explains that as he was walking along that evening in his
new geta, a large man with a long nose and wings on his
back came up to him and said, “Get on my back and I will
take you to a good place.” The boy did as he was told, but
after that, he remembers nothing. “The next thing I
realized I was standing here on this bridge.” The tale ends
with the comment “They say that it was a tengu.”42
Similarly, Yanagita Kunio records an episode from 1877
that took place in Kanazawa City in Ishikawa Prefecture,
and which was related to him as a childhood memory by
the novelist Tokuda Shūsei (1871–1943). In the house next
to Tokuda’s, a young man of about twenty disappeared from
under a large persimmon tree, leaving only his geta. After
searching for a long time, everybody suddenly heard a loud
sound in the attic, like something falling. When Tokuda’s
older brother went up to investigate, he discovered the



young man lying there. After he carried him downstairs,
they saw that his mouth was green, as if he had been
chewing tree leaves. When he recovered sufficiently, he
explained that a large man had come and taken him away;
they had traveled here and there, eating wherever they
went. After a while, he told the man he had to go and he
made his escape—and that’s when they found him in the
attic.43
There is, in fact, no specific mention of a tengu in this
story, and certainly throughout history there must have
been instances in which children accidentally got lost or
killed, or abducted by other humans. Although different
yōkai (including kitsune and oni) may be implicated in such
kidnappings, at least as far back as the Kamakura period
the tengu has been the most commonly blamed perpetrator
of this kind of crime. The Ushiwaka legend mentioned
earlier, for example, fits the pattern.
Even in the modern period, the correlation of such
abductions with supernatural powers is clear. Yanagita
relates another story, from 1907, of a boy who disappears
during a festival in which villagers are making offerings of
rice to the deities. When the boy is found in the attic of a
house, he explains that an older man took him from house
to house to feast on the food provided there, and indeed his
mouth is covered with rice.44 Again, there is no explicit
mention of tengu, but it is clear that the boy was in the
company of a supernatural being; we can also see obvious
similarities to Tokuda Shūsei’s legend.



Perhaps the most famous example of a supernatural
abduction during the Edo period is the story of the boy
Torakichi, who claimed to have been taken on a series of
mystical journeys around the world, and even to the moon,
by an accomplished tengu. His adventures came to the
attention of nativist scholar Hirata Atsutane, who
interviewed him extensively and recorded his findings in a
text called Senkyō ibun (Strange tidings from the realm of
immortals). Although the text was inflected with Atsutane’s
particular religious and political perspectives, it reveals
details, both fantastic and mundane, about the residents of
the otherworld, including animals (real and legendary) and
all sorts of demons.45
In contemporary Japan, the idea of kamikakushi is still
well known, primarily because of Miyazaki Hayao’s
blockbuster anime Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (2001),
which was appropriately translated into English as Spirited
Away. Although no tengu appear in the film, and the way in
which the characters are “spirited away” is quite different
from the legends noted here, the movie’s success at the box
office brought the word and concept of kamikakushi back
into the popular imagination. Recently the concept has
featured in literature and visual media and even as the
theme for several websites.46
Meanwhile, in contemporary Japan, tengu are often
invoked as symbols of local identity, although they still
retain their mystical, historical associations. In Hachiōji
City, to the west of central Tokyo, for example, Mount



Takao features several tengu statues, tributes to the
legends associated with them in the area. And at the Takao
san Yakuō-in Temple on the mountain, there are statues of
a long-nosed daitengu and beak-nosed kotengu.
Appropriately, too, the tengu’s association with shugendō is
still very much alive: the temple is a center of worship by
mountain ascetics, where practitioners still undergo
austerities such as waterfall training and fire walking.47
The tengu image and name are also commonly used for
merchandise. There is a popular chain of inexpensive
izakaya (restaurant-bars) called Tengu, for example, which
uses a stylized image of the long-nosed being as its icon.
There is also a famous sake made in Ishikawa Prefecture
called Tengumai (Dance of the tengu). In short, tengu have
a long history, and although they have undergone many
changes, they remain one of the most distinctive and vital
yōkai in Japan today, with roles in local community life,
religion, tourism, and commerce.
MUKADE
Centipede
The mukade is a species of centipede: a real animal that is
also considered a yōkai.
Mukade beliefs and legends are found throughout Japan.
The most famous comes from the Ōmi region, present-day
Shiga Prefecture. There are of course different versions,



but the story takes place during the Heian period. The
Dragon King living in Lake Biwa disguises himself as a
gigantic snake and lies down across a bridge, preventing
anybody from crossing. But when a warrior named
Fujiwara no Hidesato (nicknamed Tawara Tōta or Tawara
no Tōta) steps over the snake without showing the slightest
fear, the Dragon King knows he has found his man. He
promptly recruits Hidesato for the job of subduing a giant
mukade on Mount Mikami. (In some versions, it is the
beautiful daughter of the Dragon King who recruits
Hidesato.)
Hidesato finds the giant mukade coiled seven and a half
times around Mount Mikami. After shooting several arrows
into the creature to no effect, he finally moistens the tip of
an arrow with his own spit and this time kills the mukade.
Legend has it that among the rewards he receives from the
Dragon King is a large bell, which he donated to Miidera
Temple, where it is still on display today.48 Bad relations
between snakes and mukade persist in beliefs throughout
Japan.49
It is not difficult to imagine why the mukade might be
considered a yōkai. Examined closely, a real centipede is
completely alien to the human world. With its “hundred”
legs it seems to possess supernatural—or at least
unfamiliar—powers of propulsion. Its pincerlike mouth
looks vicious, and indeed, a real mukade’s bite is extremely
painful and can be poisonous. Moreover, mukade in Japan
can be six or seven inches long and are notoriously difficult



to kill. As with Hidesato’s experience, they rarely die on the
first attempt. Contemporary mukade lore suggests that the
best way to subdue them is to cut them into pieces with a
sharp pair of scissors.

NURIKABE



Plaster Wall
The nurikabe is probably most famous as one of the
standard characters in Mizuki Shigeru’s Gegege no Kitarō
series, where it appears as an animated rectangular wall
with eyes, arms, and legs. The most famous early folkloric
reference to the nurikabe is in Yanagita Kunio’s “Yōkai
Glossary,” which collected yōkai names and descriptions
from many parts of Japan. Yanagita describes the nurikabe
as a mysterious phenomenon: “Found on the coast of Onga
County in Chikuzen [present-day Fukuoka Prefecture].
When [you are] walking along a road at night, suddenly a
wall appears in front of you, and you cannot go anywhere.
This is called nurikabe and it is feared. It is said that if you
take a stick and strike at the bottom of it, it will disappear;
but if you hit at the top part, nothing will happen.”50
Similar examples of nurikabe phenomena have been
documented elsewhere in Kyushu, such as tanuki no
nurikabe (nurikabe caused by tanuki) found in Ōita
Prefecture. In this case, the walker suddenly is unable to
see in front of himself or herself.51
For his part, Mizuki describes a personal experience with
a nurikabe-like encounter that occurred when he was in
New Guinea during World War II. Exhausted and alone, he
is walking through the “dark jungle” at night eager to
rejoin his companions and wary of enemies, when suddenly
he feels as if he is stuck in “coal tar,” unable to move
forward or to either side. Completely at a loss for what to



do, he sits down to rest for a few minutes, and when he
tries to walk again it is as if nothing at all had happened.52
Many years later, Mizuki gave visual form to Yanagita’s
description as well as his own experience; the resulting
yōkai exemplifies the way a phenomenon can be fleshed out
and made real through visual imagery and the addition of
eyes and limbs to endow it with agency. Whereas Yanagita
states that a wall “appears,” Mizuki creates the wall’s
appearance. Moreover, through the popularity of Mizuki’s
work, and the fact that the nurikabe is one of the standard
characters in his Gegege no Kitarō series, the nurikabe of
Japanese folklore has been transformed from an obscure,
local experience with no visualizable form to a nationally
recognized character.
Although this trajectory, from Yanagita’s description to
Mizuki’s character, accurately depicts the development of
the nurikabe in the twentieth century, it turns out that
Mizuki’s image is not the first visualization of the
phenomenon. In 2007, scholars discovered an image
labeled “nurikabe” in an 1802 picture scroll archived at
Brigham Young University in the United States. This Edo
period nurikabe illustration looks very different from
Mizuki’s—more like a flat-faced, three-eyed elephant. The
discovery suggests that oral and visual traditions do not
always materialize in tandem with each other, and that the
“same” yōkai may be reimagined, reenvisioned, and
reinvented multiple times. Mizuki reportedly was happy
about the discovery and called it “significant.”53



MIKOSHI-NYŪDŌ
The mikoshi-nyūdō is usually described as an exceedingly
tall monklike figure you might encounter while walking
through the mountains. Sometimes he starts off small, but
as you look up at him, he keeps growing and growing.
Although the word nyūdō refers to a Buddhist monk,
literally somebody who has “entered the way,” the mikoshi
nyūdō is not necessarily an actual monk. However, he often
looks like one, with a shaved head and severe features.
Folkloric records of mikoshi-nyūdō are found throughout
Japan, where he is also known by alternative names, such
as miage-nyūdō and sometimes just mikoshi. In some cases,
it is said that he is a shape-shifting animal such as a tanuki
or kitsune in disguise.
Meeting a mikoshi-nyūdō can pose a serious problem,
but there is often a way to escape. In one region of
Okayama Prefecture, for example, it is said that if you move
your line of vision from the feet of the mikoshi-nyūdō up to
his head, he will devour you. But if you start with his head
and move down to his feet, you can escape unharmed.54
Yanagita Kunio records a yōkai called a nyūdōbōzu, which
he explains is the same as a mikoshi-nyūdō: “At first it looks
like a small monk less than three shaku [shaku = approx. a
third of a meter], but as [you] get closer it becomes [more
than] seven or eight shaku tall. It is believed that if you are
first to say, ‘I saw you,’ everything will be all right, but if it
says this [first], you will die.”55



Since at least the Edo period, images of the mikoshi
nyūdō have appeared in a wide variety of texts. The early
encyclopedia Three Realms, for example, explains that this
yōkai is “tall and has no hair. The folk [zoku] call it mikoshi
nyūdō. It is said that it leans over a person’s shoulders from
behind and stares him in the face.”56 In his first catalog,
Toriyama Sekien also includes a mikoshi-nyūdō (labeled
only mikoshi), which he draws as a long-necked, balding
figure peering out from behind a tree.57
Later in the Edo period, the mikoshi-nyūdō became a
standard yōkai character in popular literature, especially
the illustrated kibyōshi genre, where he emerged as a
leader of yōkai. In these images and narratives, his neck
became longer and more flexible, giving him the ability to
peer over all sorts of folding screens and other barriers and
making him an ideal partner for the extendable-necked
female, rokurokubi.58 The imagery of the long neck is both
phallic and snakelike, managing to be simultaneously
comical, suggestive, and creepy.
The word mikoshi can mean to “look through” a barrier
of some sort, but it can also mean to “foretell” or look
through the present into the future. Although this meaning
does not seem to be explicitly discussed in the folkloric
record, perhaps it hints implicitly at the mikoshi-nyūdō’s
supernatural powers. Written with different kanji, mikoshi
also refers to the vehicle or portable shrine in which a deity
is carried during festivals or other events. In the Amakusa
region of Kumamoto Prefecture, a legend tells of a man



encountering a tall mikoshi-nyūdō who sticks out his
tongue and threatens to lick him. The man prays
desperately: eventually a sword-wielding deity appears and
glares angrily at the creature, who proceeds to fly away in
a mikoshi-like vehicle. The name and narrative
development here seem to be based on a play on words or
confusion of language.59

The mikoshi-nyūdō is ambiguously positioned between
deity and demon. Not only does this particular version refer
to a sacred vehicle reserved for transporting gods, but also



the very name—nyūdō—has Buddhist overtones. Powers of
vision, too, are important for this yōkai; even in this legend
from Kumamoto, it is not the sword but the deity’s mighty
glare that banishes the monster.
YAMAMBA OR YAMAUBA
Mountain Crone, Mountain Hag, or Mountain Witch
The yamamba, or yamauba, is an old woman who lives in
the mountains. The word yamamba literally means
“mountain old woman” but might be more loosely rendered
as “mountain crone,” “mountain hag,” “mountain witch,” or
even, as one translation puts it, “malevolent ogress.”60
The yamamba is one of the best-known yōkai in Japan. In
legends, folktales, and local beliefs, she is often portrayed
as a hideous witchlike being who kidnaps women from local
villages, eats livestock and small children, and torments
anybody who wanders into her territory. At the same time,
there are also positive portrayals of the yamamba in which
she is a deific and beneficial presence.
Most commonly the yamamba is described as tall, with a
large mouth (sometimes slit from ear to ear), long hair, and
piercing eyes.61 In addition to appearing in local folklore,
she is the protagonist of a famous Noh play (Yamamba,
attributed to Zeami) and stars in several literary texts from
the Muromachi period to the present.62 In his first codex,
Toriyama Sekien drew a bony Yamamba with long hair,



seated in front of a mountain peak and holding a tree
branch in her hand. She seems to be emerging from the
mountainside, like an anthropomorphic version of the old,
wizened landscape itself.
In many characterizations, the yamamba is a demonic
woman who harms or kills anybody unfortunate enough to
cross her path in the mountains; she may also descend
from her mountain habitat to terrorize people in the
lowlands. A folktale collected in the early twentieth century
in Tokushima Prefecture, for example, tells of a mother who
leaves her three children at home while she goes to visit
the grave of her dead husband. She warns the children that
there is a yamamba in the mountains, and that they should
not open the door for anybody. Sure enough, after a short
while, the yamamba appears at the door of the house,
claiming to be the mother. The appropriately suspicious
children inspect her hand and see that it is covered with
hair, so they refuse to let her in. She goes away and shaves
her hand, but next the children suspect her because of her
rough voice. Eventually, the yamamba does manage to get
into the household, where she proceeds to devour the
youngest child. After a long series of events, and the help
of the “deity of the sky,” the two older boys eventually
escape and the yamamba is killed.63
While this is just one of many narratives featuring a
yamamba, it reflects the danger and fear associated with
her. At other times, however, she is drawn sympathetically,
as a woman of great strength and resources who has



managed to survive hardship. Numerous legends attest to
her benevolence. In some regions, for example, she readily
assists with household work, such as spinning thread. Or
she may suddenly appear at a marketplace to purchase
something; the money received from her is said to bring
good fortune.
In one part of Kōchi Prefecture, the yamamba’s
ambiguity is clearly reflected in local belief. If you meet a
yamamba in the mountains, it is said, you will incur the
“yamamba’s curse,” suffer from illness of an unknown
origin, and require the services of an exorcist to free
yourself. On the other hand, in the same region, it is told
that a household visited by a yamamba will prosper.64
Within this particular set of beliefs, then, transgressing the
yamamba’s home (that is, the mountains) can cause
misfortune; but inversely, allowing her to enter your own
home brings about wealth.
Clearly then, the yamamba has mysterious powers but
cannot be succinctly labeled as either good or evil. With so
many variations, it is difficult to find absolute
commonalities, except to characterize her as a woman who
lives in the mountains or, more accurately, as a woman who
does not—or cannot—live in a village with other people.65
Because of her ambiguity, scholars have suggested there is
a link between the yamamba and mountain deities; in a
complex argument, for example, folklorist Orikuchi Shinobu
(1887–1953) speculates that she can be considered the wife
of the mountain god (yama no kami).66 Whatever her



origins, however, clearly the yamamba is closely associated
with the furtive powers and dangers of the mountains. And
mountains, of course, not only are a source of wealth for a
community, providing wood and food and water, but also
represent uncharted territory, a space of undomesticated
nature into which humans must venture only with care and
respect.
The yamamba is also associated with motherhood and
birthing and might be considered, in modern terms, a fierce
and exemplary single mother. Most famously, in some
narratives a yamamba is said to be the mother of the
legendary boy hero Kintarō, who would grow up to be
Sakata no Kintoki, faithful retainer of the great warrior
Raikō and one of his lieutenants in the conquest of the oni
Shuten dōji. Legends connecting these various characters,
and describing Kintoki as the son of a yamamba, developed
through popular-culture narratives, dramas, and
illustrations during the Edo period and became particularly
widespread with the production of Chikamatsu
Monzaemon’s Komochi yamamba as a bunraku puppet
drama in 1712.67
A set of beliefs collected in Gifu Prefecture during the
mid-twentieth century neatly encapsulates a number of the
ideas associated with the yamamba. In a certain
community, there was a rock, some four meters high,
known as Yamamba-iwa (Yamamba rock). On the rock could
be seen the image of a yamamba’s face, “with one closed
eye, no nose, and a large mouth with missing teeth.” It was



said that “long ago, wandering through the mountains,
there was a frightening yamamba who lived by sucking the
blood and eating the meat of birds and beasts.” She could
be terrifying to behold, but when she was in good spirits
she would come down to the village and help farmers with
their work, “easily doing the same amount of labor as four
or five men.”
Once she complained that her scalp was itchy, and
somebody took a look and discovered that it was crawling
with centipedes and caterpillars. They gave her an old
comb, and she “happily scratched herself as she went back
home into the mountains.” Every December, she would buy
some sake at the market, take it up into the mountains and
not return for the entire winter. When she died, the people
of the village buried her at the base of a large rock, which
gradually eroded over the years into the image of a
yamamba’s face. It was said that if the face appeared to be
crying, it would soon rain; if it seemed happy, the sun
would shine. It was also said that if a woman prayed at the
rock, she would produce abundant milk for her child.68
The yamamba here is hideous and frightening but
simultaneously well respected, benevolent, and associated
with motherhood. Her legend is, literally, engraved in the
landscape. This one specific example reflects the complex
of ideas associated with her figure, as well as the interplay
and mutual influences of popular culture and folklore.
The word yamamba (or yamauba) does not seem to
appear in Japanese texts until the Muromachi period;



before that, such witchlike women were generally
portrayed as female oni.69 Whether classified as yamamba
or not, demonic women can be found as far back as the
Kojiki and the Nihonshoki episode in which the Yomotsu
shikome, the “hags of Yomi,” chase Izanagi from the
underworld. They also appear in numerous medieval
setsuwa and Noh plays.70
That said, it is important not to conflate all female demon
figures. The female oni is often characterized by her jealous
rage—in fact, this rage is sometimes the very thing that
turns a regular woman into a demon in the first place. This
is, for example, one characteristic of the demonic female
hannya mask used in many a Noh play. Akin to male oni,
the female oni is distinguished by horns sprouting from her
head. In contrast, most descriptions of yamamba do not
include horns; nor generally is her monstrousness
attributed to jealousy or sexual passion.
The yamamba is clearly a multifaceted and often
contradictory being. In contemporary feminist analysis, she
is a figure of great interpretive value. Living on the edge of
society, in the mountains, she becomes a symbol of the
marginalized Other, the outcast, or perhaps someone who
has purposefully chosen to live off the grid. As a woman in
particular, she comes to represent resistance to patriarchy
and hegemonic gender relations. It is no coincidence that
at the turn of the current century, yamamba became the
name of a Japanese fashion-related subculture featuring
young women who bleach their hair white and artificially



darken the color of their skin. As an extreme cultural
statement, the yamamba fashion threatens normative
standards, drawing on the dangerous and rebellious spirit
of this yōkai of folklore.

KIJIMUNĀ
Probably the most widely known yōkai of the Okinawa and
Ryukyu Island region in the south of Japan, the kijimunā is
a trickster figure akin to a kappa. It is also considered a
tree spirit like a kodama. There is no simple English
translation for kijimunā.
Within Okinawa, there are numerous local names for the
creature, including kijimuna, kijimun, kimuyā, bunagai,
bunagayā, michibata, handanmii, and akagandā, among
others. As suggested by the variety of names, there are also
many regional versions; but kijimunā are often described as
having both hair down to their shoulders and hairy bodies.
In some locales, they are the size of an infant or small child
and covered in red hair; elsewhere they are large and
completely black; and in some places they are said to
possess gigantic testicles. They tend to reside in trees, such
as fig trees and other types native to the region.71



Kijimunā like to play tricks on people by, for example,
giving them dirt and making them believe it is rice. They
can be violent and troublesome, robbing people walking
alone at night. But they can also befriend humans, helping
them catch fish or do work in the mountains. A fish
provided by a kijimunā is always missing one eye because,
it is said, the kijimunā has eaten the other. You can break
off a friendship with a kijimunā or cause it to leave the area
by giving it something it hates, such as an octopus or a
chicken, or by burning down or hammering nails into the
tree in which it lives.72
A legend collected in the Shimajiri district in Okinawa
clearly exemplifies the double-edged, ambivalent character
of the kijimunā. There was a man called Kujira-dono, who
spent his days working hard and his evenings fishing in the
ocean. Once, while fishing, he noticed a man he had never
seen before; he greeted him and eventually the two became
friends, meeting every night at the same place and
occasionally even sharing their catch. Kujira-dono noticed
some strange things about the man—an accent he could not
place, for example, and the fact that his clothing always
seemed wet. When he asked him where he lived, the
strange man only gestured vaguely to a mountain in the
distance. Kujira-dono eventually became more and more
suspicious and one day ventured to ask him again where he
came from and what his village was called. Suddenly the
man’s eyes flashed, and he said, “Today is no fun, so I am
going home.” Kujira-dono followed him through the woods



and into the mountains, where he eventually came to a
gigantic old mulberry (kuwa) tree. And then the man just
disappeared, as if swallowed up by the tree.
That night, when Kujira-dono told his wife about the
experience, she immediately realized that her husband’s
friend must be a kijimunā. The next day, Kujira-dono went
to their fishing spot and greeted the man as usual. But
while they were fishing, Kujira-dono’s wife found the old
mulberry tree and set it on fire. When the kijimunā
returned to find his home destroyed, he was distressed and
angry and eventually just disappeared. Kujira-dono and his
wife were afraid and moved to another village far away.
Several years later, Kujira-dono had to travel to town.
Late at night, as he walked alone on the road, he saw a
light coming toward him. When it got closer, he recognized
the kijimunā. He was frightened, of course, but screwed up
his courage and greeted his old companion. The two old
friends went out for a drink and had a lively time telling
stories. At one point, Kujira-dono forgot himself and told
about the time, five years earlier, that he banished a spirit
from an old mulberry tree.
The kijimunā listened carefully and then stood up,
whipped out a small knife, held down Kujira-dono’s hand,
and cut off his five fingers. He then just disappeared. In
extreme pain, Kujira-dono managed to make it home, where
he eventually died in agony. In her sadness, his wife carried
his body back to his hometown. When she stripped off his



clothing to dress him in his funeral garb, she discovered
that his entire body was the color of rust.73
On a lighter note, the kijimunā name is also currently
associated with Kijimunā Festa, an international
performing arts festival for young people held every
summer in Okinawa City. The festival symbol is an image of
a crazy-haired, cute, red kijimunā.74
NINMENJU OR JINMENJU
Human-Faced Tree
In one of his many encyclopedic compendia of yōkai, Mizuki
Shigeru describes a tree in Aomori Prefecture that,
according to legend, would bleed when cut. He suggests
that this strange plant might be a version of the ninmenju
(alternatively jinmenju), a tree with human heads instead of
flowers.75 Such a yōkai tree was pictured two centuries
earlier by Toriyama Sekien, who explains that it is found “in
the mountains and valleys. Its flowers are like human
heads. They do not speak, but merely laugh constantly. If
they laugh too much, it is said, they will fall off.”76
In Sekien’s illustration, the tree skirts the left side and
top of the page, with a spiky-leafed branch bearing small
bald heads. Sekien apparently developed this image from
one in the Three Realms; interestingly, however, in the
Three Realms there is a man standing to the right of the
tree. More intriguing still is that this entry is not in the



section on plants but in the section on “peoples from
foreign lands.”77 In fact, the focus is not the tree itself but
the land with which it is associated: a place called Daishi.
The Three Realms passage refers to an earlier Chinese
text, the Sancaituhui (c. 1609), where the land is called Da
shi, possibly from tazi, a Persian word meaning “Arab.” If
we continue back in time and along the Silk Road, we find
different versions of the great Persian epic poem Shahnama
(Book of Kings) by Firdawsi (d. 1020), with illustrations of a
man conversing with a tree bearing humans heads. The
man, it turns out, is Alexander the Great (Sikandar or
Iskandar), and the illustrations portray his legendary
encounter with a talking tree, sometimes called the
Wakwak Tree, that prophesied his death.78
By tracing this complex lineage, we can see images and
ideas moving across space, time, and cultures. Here a
picture of Alexander the Great becomes associated with
“foreign lands” and enters Japan (through China) during
the Edo period (a time, ironically, known for its relative
isolation). Eventually man and place disappear, leaving only
a mysterious tree located somewhere in “the mountains
and valleys”—a plant monster that joins the world of
Japanese yōkai. This tree yōkai, in turn, not only becomes
part of the cultural imagination of Japan but also comes to
be associated with a local legend in one corner of the
country.

The process demonstrates one of many ways in which
“Japanese” yōkai come into being. It turns out that a
seemingly indigenous monster may have originated with a
Persian illustration of Alexander the Great! Interestingly,
many scholars have focused on how Alexander’s travels
introduced monsters and “marvels of the East” into the
Hellenistic world and the Western imagination.79 The
talking or laughing heads of the ninmenju tell us that such
monstrous influences went both ways. Even in so-called
premodern times, there were global connections through
which legends and imagery were transmitted and
transformed across time, language, continents, and
cultures.

Water
Japan is made up of numerous islands and surrounded by
ocean. It is also full of rivers, creeks, marshes, and ponds.
Historically much of the arable land has been farmed
through wet-rice cultivation, in which paddy fields are
flooded during the growing season. Water control and
irrigation are critical to Japanese economic life, and water
plays a large part in the cultural imagination. All the yōkai
in this chapter are connected in some way with water.
NINGYO
Mermaid or Merman
Legends of human-fish hybrids, often called mermaids or
mermen, are found throughout the world. In Japan, the
earliest documented account of a ningyo (literally, “human
fish”) appears in the Nihonshoki, where it is recorded that
near (present-day) Osaka in the year 619, a fisherman



caught something “shaped like a child. It was neither a fish
nor a person, and its name was unknown.”1 Historically,
the implications of a ningyo sighting varied; it might be
considered a sign of prosperity to come or, alternatively,
interpreted as an omen of impending catastrophe, such as
a typhoon, earthquake, or tsunami.2
Either way, however, ningyo were thought to possess
great powers. One famous belief was that eating ningyo
meat would bring you long life. Sometimes just looking at a
ningyo was considered good fortune. A wood-block print
from 1805, for example, shows a female ningyo from
Ecchū-no-kuni (current-day Toyama area), with the
comment that “a person who looks even once at this fish”
will have a long and happy life, free of natural disasters and
bad things.3
The story of Happyaku bikuni (also called Yao bikuni),
the “eight-hundred-year nun,” is one of the best-known
legends (or complexes of legends) associated with the
ningyo; the tale reveals the mixed blessings that long life
can bring. A version recounted in the Wakasa-Obama area
(present-day Fukui Prefecture) tells of a man who invites a
guest to his house to eat a rare fish, a ningyo that he has
caught in his nets. Put off by the idea of eating the flesh of
a human-faced creature, the guest carefully manages to
avoid the meat—but his host insists that he take some
home, where, inadvertently, his sixteen-year-old daughter
eats it. In the years to come, it is discovered that the
daughter, miraculously, does not seem to age; as time



progresses, her parents and friends all die and she is left
lonely. Eventually she becomes a nun and travels
throughout the country doing good things for everyone she
meets. At the age of eight hundred, she returns to Wakasa
Obama to enshrine herself in a cave by the sea. Just before
entering the cave, however, she plants a single camellia
tree near the entrance, saying, “When this tree withers,
please think that I have died.” According to legend, the tree
has not yet withered.4
The size, shape, and countenance of ningyo vary.
Generally the upper body of the creature—sometimes just
the head, sometimes the arms as well—is humanlike, while
the lower body is fishlike. The inverse has also been found
on occasion. In many Edo-period illustrations, ningyo also
have horns protruding from their otherwise humanlike
heads.
A number of mummified mermaids can still be found
today. These mummies seem to have been artfully
constructed during the Edo period by Japanese (and
possibly other Asian) fishermen, who would stitch together
the upper body of a monkey and the lower body of a fish.
Mermaid-making like this, which required a sophisticated
knowledge of taxidermy, may have been a way for seafaring
people to pass the time and perhaps make a little extra
money.5 Several of the existing examples of these creatures
are found in Holland and were most likely sold or traded to
Dutch sailors by Japanese fishermen.



The most notorious desiccated mermaid was the one
displayed in 1842 by the great American showman P.T.
Barnum. Called the “Feejee Mermaid,” this ugly, shriveled,
two-foot-ten-inch-long mummy was a cause célèbre when
Barnum showed it with great fanfare in New York. It not
only made viewers rethink their common conception of the
mermaid as an attractive woman who just happens to have
the tail of a fish, but it also set off a debate among
naturalists and the general public about the possibility of
mermaids in the first place.
Some twenty years earlier this same ningyo had made a
stir on the other side of the Atlantic, where “throughout the
autumn of 1822, the mermaid was London’s greatest
scientific sensation: people thronged to see it, and most
newspapers had articles about ‘the remarkable Stuffed
Mermaid.’”6 The ningyo was first brought to London by
Samuel Barrett Eades, an American sea captain, who had
purchased it from Dutch merchants in Holland. The
Dutchmen claimed that they had bought it from a Japanese
fisherman who had caught it in his net. The ultimate fate of
the Feejee Mermaid is unknown—though it was probably
destroyed in a Boston fire in the 1880s. But in its
sensational global sojourn, from Japan to Holland to Britain
to the United States, this one small yōkai seems to have
made a remarkable impression on a great number of
people, inspired debates among scientists and the general
public, and played a small but meaningful role in Western
cultural history.7



Over a hundred years later, in 1990, a yōkai called a
jinmengyo, or “human faced-fish,” became an instant media
sensation in Japan when a weekly magazine published a
photo of a carp that had what looked like a human face,
found in a temple pond in Yamagata Prefecture. This
occurred almost directly on the heels of rumors about a
human-faced dog (jinmenken), so it was likely a sort of
copycat yōkai phenomenon. As recently as 2008, jinmengyo
sightings have been reported, and these may be the result
of a trick of light created by the pattern of reflective scales
on the heads of certain kinds of fish; when seen through
the water from above, the fish appears to have the features
of a human face.8 Although the jinmengyo may not be
historically related to the ningyo, the hybrid of human and
fish is still part of the cultural imagination and still causing
viewers to question, or play with, the limits of possibility.
KAPPA (ALSO KAWATARŌ)
The kappa is associated with water, usually rivers, ponds,
or swamps. It is one of the most famous of all yōkai in
Japan. Different legends and beliefs about it are distributed
throughout the country, but generally speaking, the kappa
is thought of as scaly or slimy, greenish in color, with
webbed feet and hands, and a carapace on its back.
Sometimes it resembles a monkey, sometimes a giant frog
or turtle. It is the size of a young child but
disproportionately strong. A concave indentation or saucer



on top of the kappa’s head contains water; if this water is
spilled, the creature loses its super strength. Kappa are
mischievous and sometimes deadly, notorious for pulling
horses and cattle into the water; they have also been
known to drown young children and extract their internal
organs through their anuses.
Despite these murderous proclivities, kappa can be both
playful and exceedingly honest. They especially enjoy sumō
wrestling and like to challenge passersby to a match. One
tactic for defeating a kappa in sumō is simply to bow
beforehand; when the kappa bows in response, it spills its
strength-giving liquid from the saucer on its head. The
kappa is at once a dangerous, demonic monster—a reason
to warn children about swimming in a river or pond—and
an amusing, if disgusting, water sprite. While Chinese lore
has certainly influenced its development, and comparable
water creatures exist elsewhere in world folklore, the
kappa as described here is considered a distinctly Japanese
creation.
Kappa are fond of certain foods, including melons,
eggplants, and especially, cucumbers. In many places,
children were warned not to go swimming after eating
cucumbers, because they might be attacked by a kappa; in
some communities, there is a tradition of leaving
cucumbers at shrines or in the water as offerings to
appease the resident kappa. In fact, in Japan and much of
the rest of the world, sushi rolls made with cucumbers are



called kappa maki, named for the kappa’s love of this
summer vegetable.
Numerous local rituals and festivals, particularly in
agricultural communities that depend on water for
irrigation, celebrate kappa as water deities (suijin). When
treated appropriately, the local kappa will ensure ample
water for irrigation; if neglected or treated with disdain, it
will cause drought or flooding. The kappa, therefore, can
be considered simultaneously a deity and a demon,
depending on the perspective of the human beings with
whom it is in contact.
The Word
Literally meaning “river” (kawa) “child” (warabe), the
name kappa seems to perfectly describe the little beast
itself—a child of the river. But kappa is actually only one of
many variant words for the creature, whose wide
distribution throughout Japan is reflected in its many local
types—there are more than a hundred regional variations.
Scholars have tried to classify the various names or types
of kappa found throughout Japan, organizing them into
“lineages.” Ishikawa Jun’ichirō, for example, has mapped
out names in accordance with their possible derivations;
some reflect the creature’s physical resemblance to a child
(e.g., kawappa, kawako, kawatarō), others its resemblance
to a monkey (e.g., enkō, enko), a turtle (e.g., dangame), or



an otter (e.g., kawaso); still other names indicate the
kappa’s behavior (e.g., komahiki, or “horse puller”).9
The word kappa itself was originally a regional term used
in the east of Japan, from the Kanto area to Tohoku, but has
now become the generic label for the creature, commonly
used in academic works and in popular culture.10 The
ubiquity of the label raises the question of how much the
name of the thing determines the nature of the thing. In my
own fieldwork, for example, I interviewed a number of
older residents of the small community of Teuchi in
Kagoshima Prefecture. They told me how, as children, they
were warned about a terrifying water creature called a
gamishiro. When I asked them to describe it, one of them
told me it was “just like a kappa.” Most likely, however,
when they were children they never actually heard the
word kappa; only after they were older, and had heard
descriptions of the kappa from elsewhere, did they attach
this label to their own local water creature—and with the
label, they also imported some of the kappa’s particular
characteristics.
Similarly, folklorist Itō Ryōhei notes that several years
ago, when he taught a class on Japanese culture at a
university in Taiwan, he asked his students to draw pictures
of oni, tengu, and kappa. Of these three, it was the kappa
images that were most similar to each other: “a small cute
creature, a head with hair surrounding a saucer, a beak and
webbed hands and feet, and a shell on its back.” As Itō
points out, this is how a Japanese person would probably



illustrate a kappa.11 In other words, not only has the kappa
—both name and image—become unified or generic within
Japan, but also, through mass media and other means, it
has been transmitted overseas.
If we take kappa as a generic label for a whole range of
water creatures, then we can trace its earliest documented
appearance to the Nihonshoki, in which it is explained that
in the year 379 a snakelike water creature called a
midzuchi had been killing travelers near a particular river.
The district warden, “a man of fierce temper and of great
bodily strength, stood over the pool of the river-fork and
flung into the water three whole calabashes, saying:—‘Thou
art continually belching up poison and therewithal plaguing
travellers. I will kill thee, thou water-snake. If thou canst
sink these calabashes, then will I take myself away, but if
thou canst not sink them, then will I cut up thy body.’” In
the end, the midzuchi fails in his efforts to sink the gourds
and is duly dispatched by the warden.12
Whether or not the water-snake or spirit portrayed in
this early period can be considered a kappa or perhaps a
“pre-kappa,” it was not until the Edo period that the
creature became a major yōkai presence.13 That was when
the kappa started to appear in many a local legend, as the
protagonist in numerous lighthearted popular illustrated
texts and as the focus of academic and protozoological
studies. The earliest known mass-produced image appears
in the Three Realms, under the label kawatarō,
accompanied by the following description:



About the size of a ten-year-old child, the kawatarō stands and walks naked
and speaks in a human voice. Its hair is short and sparse. The top of its head
is concave and can hold a scoop of water. Kawatarō usually live in the water,
but in the light of the late afternoon, many emerge into the area near the
river and steal melons, eggplants, and things from the fields. By nature the
kawatarō likes sumō; when it sees a person, it will invite him [to wrestle]. . . .
If there is water on its head, the kawatarō has several times the strength of a
warrior. . . . The kawatarō has a tendency to pull cattle and horses into the
water and suck blood out of their rumps. People crossing rivers must be very
careful.14
Kappa were also among the first yōkai illustrated in
Toriyama Sekien’s Gazu hyakkiyagyō, where the label reads
simply, “Kappa, also called kawatarō.” Along with such
encyclopedic treatments, kappa appeared as protagonists
in kibyōshi and other graphic literary works. Through these
inexpensive and widely circulated formats, the kappa image
became relatively standardized, and this mass-produced
urban version in turn influenced localized rural versions.
Kappa versus Kawatarō
Scholars have traced images of the kappa to different
regions, broadly dividing the country between east and
west. The shell-bearing, amphibious yōkai was generally
found in eastern Japan, from the Kanto (Edo) region to
Tohoku. In western Japan, from Kansai to parts of Shikoku
and Kyushu, the creature was called a kawatarō (or some
variation of this name) and was hairy and walked upright
and monkeylike. It is no coincidence, for example, that the
“kawatarō” in the Three Realms quoted earlier looks much



like a monkey; the author, Terajima Ryōan, was from Osaka,
in the west of the country. Similarly, a 1754 text called the
Nihon sankai meibutsu zue shows a group of kawatarō from
Bungo (modern-day Ōita Prefecture) in Kyushu walking
upright and playing near a river; the text describes them as
“the size of five-year-old children and having hair all over
their bodies.”15 In 1776, when Toriyama Sekien created an
image labeled “Kappa, also called kawatarō,” he neatly, and
perhaps consciously, subsumed the name and image of the
western kawatarō under the name and image of the eastern
kappa. In the ensuing years, and certainly by the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, this generally
amphibious, slimy version of the creature, called by the
name kappa, would become the yōkai we know today.16
Kappa Characteristics
Keeping in mind this complex history of regional variants
and creative interaction, we can identify a number of
widely noted kappa traits. As mentioned earlier, kappa are,
for example, exceedingly fond of cucumbers. On the other
hand, they are repelled by certain materials, such as iron
an aversion common to many water spirits around the
world.17 Their inability to cope with calabashes, or gourds,
as demonstrated in the Nihonshoki passage quoted earlier,
persists even in a much later folk narrative known as the
“Kappa muko-iri” (Kappa bridegroom) tale. A farmer offers
to give his daughter to anybody who can successfully



irrigate his fields. He had assumed this would be a human
being, of course, but it is the local kappa who eventually
performs the task and receives the daughter’s hand. The
prospective bride, understandably, is not keen on the
relationship and challenges the kappa to sink some gourds
in the river. Unable to complete this impossible assignment,
the kappa exhausts himself, forsaking the marriage.18
Particularly in the northern part of Japan, kappa were
known for pulling horses into the water: in some regions
they are called komahiki, or “horse-puller.” This nasty
penchant for drowning horses (and sometimes cattle) is
balanced by the fact that, in most of these narratives, the
kappa fails. Its attempt backfires and the kappa, or just its
arm, is pulled by the startled horse all the way back to the
stable. In this emasculated condition, the kappa is
receptive to human negotiation, and often, in order to
regain its freedom or get its arm back (the arm can be
reattached within a certain number of days), it will pledge,
for example, to stop harassing passersby, to help with work
in the fields, or perhaps to teach its captors secret
medicines and techniques for setting bones.
This last trait, the kappa’s knowledge of medicine, is a
motif found throughout Japan. In some cases, an ancestor’s
negotiation with a captive kappa is touted as the origin of a
family’s lineage as medical doctors. A legend from Ehime
Prefecture reflects not only this secret medical knowledge
but also another nasty habit of the kappa (in this case,
called an enko):



Long ago, the maid [of a doctor’s household] went to the outhouse at night,
and out of the toilet reached a hairy hand—perhaps a human, perhaps a
monkey; she didn’t know what—and made to stroke her buttocks. She was
frightened and told her experience to the doctor.
On hearing this, the doctor grabbed a sword, exclaimed, “I’ll go conquer
this thing,” and entered the outhouse. And sure enough, when a hand
reached out of the toilet the doctor grabbed it and chopped it off with his
sword. He brought the hand inside and put it in his examination room.
The next evening, there was a knock at the front door; assuming it was a
patient, the doctor went out and discovered that it was the enko whose arm
he had chopped off the day before. “Doctor,” the enko said, “please return
my arm. If I don’t apply medicine and reattach it quickly, I won’t be able to
reattach it at all. I won’t do anything bad anymore,” it apologized, “so please
return my arm.”
When the doctor at first refused, the enko signed a pledge promising to
teach him secret knowledge and how to make a medicine for mending bones,
and so it seems the doctor then returned his arm. After this, it is said, the
doctor prospered as a specialist in the setting of bones.19
The kappa’s interest in stroking human buttocks is
connected with another, more devious trait—namely, its
desire for an organ called the shirikodama. The
shirikodama is characterized as a ball positioned at the
opening of the anus; if your shirikodama is snatched away
by a kappa, you will die. Of course, biologically speaking,
there is no such organ, but one explanation for the belief is
that the bodies of drowning victims have an “open anus,”
as if something had been removed.20 In some cases, it is
said, the kappa’s objective is not the shirikodama itself but
the internal organs beyond it.
Modern Kappa



Despite their potentially devious and disgusting behavior,
kappa flourish in modern Japan. They have gradually been
cleaned up—domesticated and made safe—and are often
used for nationwide advertising campaigns and the
promotion of local tourism. This process of domestication
certainly started with the kappa’s comic appearance in
kibyōshi and other Edo-period formats. In the twentieth
century, the creature made a particularly famous literary
appearance, as the protagonist of Akutagawa Ryūnosuke’s
short novel Kappa (1927), a social satire narrated by a
human who journeys to a land of kappa. In his depiction of
kappa characters, with their similarities to and differences
from humans, the author poignantly critiques certain
aspects of modern Japanese society. Akutagawa was
already well known when he wrote Kappa; his suicide soon
after its appearance brought attention to the satirical
contents and kappa characters of his final novel.21
The kappa’s appearance also developed throughout the
twentieth century. The artist Ogawa Usen (1868–1938), for
example, was famous for his depictions of kappa frolicking
joyfully. As in Akutagawa’s novel, the kappa became stand
ins for humans. This is also clear in the popular manga of
Shimizu Kon (1912–1974), whose Kappa tengoku (Kappa
heaven), complete with female kappa (rare in folklore) and
“salaryman” kappa (nonexistent in folklore), began
nationwide circulation in the Asahi Weekly in 1953. Kojima
Kō (b. 1928) also illustrated naked female kappa, with pink
nipples and thick eyelashes, similar to humans but for their



patterned shells and the delicate blue saucers perched on
their heads. Images by both these artists were used in
advertising campaigns, most famously by Kizakura sake. In
the 1960s, Mizuki Shigeru published a serialized manga
titled Sanpei the Kappa. The kappa’s role as a national
icon, and as a metaphor for the Japanese consumer, can
also be seen in its use as a mascot for the DC Card (a credit
card). In this case, the kappa is paired with another
popular yōkai—the tanuki.22
The kappa’s commercial power is also recognized on the
local level. In the 1970s and 1980s, when many people
were moving to the cities, rural communities throughout
Japan began to develop local kappa-lore for “village
revitalization” projects. By celebrating the kappa’s
association with agriculture and a rapidly disappearing
rural lifestyle, communities branded themselves
nostalgically as traditional hometowns, attracting tourists
and selling products based on these images.
Similarly, this slimy creature that once terrorized people
and animals venturing near the water has now become a
symbol of unspoiled nature. You can find cutesified kappa
images posted near rivers, imploring people not to litter or
spoil the environment. In other words, a yōkai that used to
represent the violence and unpredictability of the natural
world, and especially water, has now literally become a
poster child for the effort to stop the sacrifice of nature.
Even while kappa serve different purposes on the local
level, they continue to appear nationally (and



internationally) in popular media, especially film. Mizuki
Shigeru’s 1960s manga Sanpei the Kappa returned as an
animated series in the 1990s, and a kappa character played
a starring role in the E.T.-like feature film Kappa (1994).
The early twenty-first century has already witnessed
several kappa-related films, such as director Miike
Takashi’s Yōkai daisensō (The Great Yōkai War, 2005); Desu
kappa (Death Kappa, dir. Haraguchi Tomo’o, 2010),
starring a mammoth mutant kappa stomping through
Tokyo; and Imaoka Shinji’s Onna no Kappa (2011, English
title: Underwater Love), a fantasy soft-porn musical. The
kappa remains a vibrant and versatile character, more
often than not providing satirical, if not frightening,
commentary on contemporary human society.

Finally, as one of Japan’s best-recognized yōkai, the
kappa has also appeared internationally, famously in Harry
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (1999) and Rowling’s
bestiary Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them (2001).23
Although the kappa is not celebrated specifically as a
shape-shifter, it turns out to be very capable of adapting to
all sorts of different environments. After its humble
beginnings as a repulsive water creature in a Japanese
river, it has now traveled the world.
KAWAUSO



River Otter
Kawauso are found in various regions throughout the
country, where they are known for deception and mischief
similar to that of kitsune and tanuki. And like kitsune and
tanuki, kawauso are also related to a real mammal, in this
case the river otter.
Since at least the Edo period, the kawauso has been
famous for assuming the guise of an attractive human in
order to deceive other humans. In some literary accounts,
it is portrayed as a particularly cruel yōkai, transforming
itself into a beautiful woman in order to kill a man. Tales of
otters taking the guise of beautiful women are also found in
early Chinese texts.24
In some local folklore, kawauso are conflated with kappa,
performing the same types of mischief and similarly
challenging humans to sumō. In fact, the names kawauso
and kawaso are sometimes used as variant labels for kappa.
At the very least, kawauso and kappa are close relatives:
Toriyama Sekien’s kawauso, walking upright and wearing a
sedge hat, appears in his earliest text—on the page facing
the kappa.
Both the image of the kawauso and the word itself are
deeply linked with the Japanese river otter (Lutra lutra
whiteleyi or Lutra lutra nippon), which once swam in
abundance throughout the Japanese archipelago. Eating
shrimp and fish, these sleek carnivorous creatures grew to
be about a meter long. Given their quick, flashing



movements and expressive faces, it is easy to imagine them
possessing shape-shifting and deceptive capabilities.
Unfortunately, they also possessed highly desirable fur,
which was primarily sold to foreign traders. And more
recently, during Japan’s postwar period of rapid
industrialization, many rivers were dammed and polluted,
gradually destroying the kawauso’s natural habitat. A wild
otter was spotted in Kōchi Prefecture in 1979, but none
have been seen since. In September 2012, the Japanese
Ministry of the Environment officially declared them
extinct.25
HYŌSUBE
The hyōsube, also called hyōsuhe, hyōzunbo, and hyōsubo,
is a water yōkai, perhaps a species of kappa, found
especially in Saga and Miyazaki Prefectures in Kyushu.26
In his first catalog, Toriyama Sekien draws the hyōsube as
a goofy-looking creature with an extremely hairy body (but
bald head); he does not provide any written description or
other information. Even though the creature is thought to
be related to the kappa, Sekien’s hyōsube seems to be on
the veranda of a house, and there is no water in sight.
Sekien’s image also resembles a hyōsube found in an
earlier yōkai picture scroll, the Hyakkai-zukan by Sawaki
Sūshi, where it is also illustrated in a comic fashion but
with no explanation.27

GAMISHIRO, GAMISHIRŌ, OR GAMESHIRŌ
The gamishiro lives in the ocean near the village of Teuchi
on the island of Shimo-Koshikijima off the west coast of
Kagoshima Prefecture. While the creature seems to be
localized to this small area, it shares many characteristics
with the kappa. Like the kappa, for example, it is
particularly fond of cucumbers. But whereas most yōkai of
the kappa family tend to haunt rivers and small pools of
water, the gamishiro lives in the ocean.
There are no extant illustrations of the gamishiro, and it
has been all but forgotten by younger islanders. However, it
seems to have been well known in the past. In 2012, for
example, one fifty-eight-year-old island native told me that
when he was a child he was warned not to go swimming in
the ocean after eating cucumbers, because he would be
attacked by a gamishiro. Looking back, he suggests this
may have been a way for adults to prevent children from
stealing cucumbers, a summer crop on the island. His
parents, both in their eighties, confirmed that they too
were told the same thing as children, so the belief has been
consistent for at least eighty years or so. Another islander
in her fifties recalled being told that she should not go



swimming alone in the ocean because a gamishiro would
grab her leg and pull her under. In retrospect, she
interprets this as a way for her elders to remind her of the
dangers of swimming alone in the ocean. She has no
recollection of an association with cucumbers.
Generally there is no specific physical description
associated with the gamishiro: it is just a frightening and
dangerous “thing” lurking in the waters. However, another
Teuchi resident, in his late eighties, described the creature
as being similar to a kappa, with a cavity on its head and
clawlike limbs. As a child he was warned that the gamishiro
lurked particularly in two deep pools of water in the bay,
and that it would pull you down by grabbing your Achilles
tendon. He recalled that when he was a child a young
relative of his was almost drowned in one of these pools;
when he was rescued, everybody checked his ankles for
marks of the gamishiro’s claws, but there were none.28
It is possible that the “gami” in “gamishiro” is related to
the word kami, the general Japanese word for deity. The
alternate name gameshirō has also been recorded for this
same oceangoing yōkai.29 The game part of the word is a
name for kappa-like creatures found in various different
regions and may imply an association with the turtle, or
kame.30 The variety of names and the possible associations
with deities, other yōkai, and turtles demonstrate the
flexibility of such vernacular designations. The fact that
there are no known illustrations or other visible images of



this particular yōkai also allows it to remain vague and
changeable but still dangerous and potentially frightening.
MŌRYŌ
The mōryō has a complex and somewhat vague history, but
the name derives from Chinese sources and indicates a
deity or demon associated with water. Mōryō is one part of
the longer word chimi-mōryō, an inclusive term for all sorts
of yōkai, which has been used in Japan since at least the
Edo period. Chimi refers to spirits associated with the
mountains, while mōryō is linked with water.31
In the Kinmōzui (1666), an early Japanese illustrated
encyclopedia, there is a brief entry for oni that explains,
“Oni is chimi, which is the spirit of an old thing; mōryō or
mizuchi, which is a water deity [suijin]; and also the tree
spirit [kinomi] or kodama; mountain demon [sanki] or
yamazumi.”32 About fifty years later, in the Three Realms,
the mōryō is given its own entry, in which it is described as
a creature the size of a “three-year-old child, black and red
in color, with red eyes, long ears, and beautiful hair.”
Judging from the illustration, the mōryō looks harmless,
much like a human child but for the elongated upright ears.
The author goes on to note, however, that this creature
“likes to eat livers from dead bodies.”33
In Konjaku gazu zoku hyakki (1779), Toriyama Sekien
develops this image with a description very similar to the
one found in the Three Realms: “Its figure is like that of a



three-year-old child. It is red and black in color. It has red
eyes, long ears and beautiful hair. It is said that it likes to
eat the livers of dead bodies.” In contrast to the innocent
looking creature illustrated in the Three Realms, however,
Sekien’s mōryō has sharp nails and hairy ears and is
pulling a body from the ground; a broken Buddhist stupa
indicates the site of the disrupted grave. There is no
mention of any relationship with water.34
More recently, the mōryō has been pictured in manga
and anime by Mizuki Shigeru.35 It was also the title
character of Kyōgoku Natsuhiko’s second novel, Mōryō no
hako (The box of the mōryō; 1995), which won the Mystery
Writers of Japan Award for Best Novel (1996) and was later
made into a live action film (2007), a manga (2007–2010),
and a television anime (2008).36
AZUKI-ARAI
Bean-Washer
The azuki-arai is a yōkai that creates the sound of azuki (or
adzuki) beans being washed in a river, pond, or well. The
phenomenon is found throughout most of Japan, though the
name may differ from region to region; for example, it is
called azuki-suri and azuki-sarasara in parts of Okayama
Prefecture, azuki-sogi in one village in Yamanashi
Prefecture, and azuki-goshagosha in part of Nagano City.
Along with making the sound of washing, sometimes it is



heard singing. Similar sounds of washing have also been
attributed to tanuki, kitsune, kawauso, and mujina.37
While the origin of the azuki-arai is most likely the sound
of water running across pebbles or through leaves, the
connection with azuki is also important. In Japan, azuki
(Phaseolus angularis) and other beans are symbolically
powerful. During the Setsubun celebration in early
February, for example, family members in many parts of
Japan throw soybeans while shouting, “Out with oni, in with
good fortune!” and then each eats as many beans as his or
her age. The magical properties of the beans ward off evil
and usher in good fortune for the year to come. Similarly,
special events such as weddings, graduations, and other
achievements are often celebrated by eating seki-han, rice
cooked with red azuki beans.

Kijin.



Although the folk phenomenon of the azuki-arai
described earlier is auditory, at least as far back as the Edo
period a visual image was also associated with it. In an
1841 illustrated book of spooky tales by Takehara Shunsen,
for example, there is a story of a disabled Buddhist acolyte
who enjoys, and is exceedingly skilled at, counting beans.
One day, an evil monk throws him down a well, and
afterward his spirit appears at twilight and is heard
washing and counting beans. The narrative is illustrated
with an image of an awkwardly bent man with a crazy smile
and a demonic glint in his eye, his hands thrust into a
bucket of beans. Mizuki Shigeru’s azuki-arai image is
clearly based on this one, and an even more developed
character appears in the film The Great Yōkai War
(2005).38
Azuki-arai is also an alternative name for the chatate
mushi (literally, “tea-brewing insect,” Psocoptera), a family
of insects known for making noise at night in the paper
shoji dividers of households. The noise they make is said to
be similar to the sound of the brewing of tea (cha o tateru)
or, as it were, the washing of beans.39



7
Countryside
The yōkai in this chapter live and appear in the
countryside, by which I mean any sort of rural setting
from a wooded mountain to a farming village. This
designation is necessarily broad and somewhat vague,
occupying the expansive space between the Wilds of nature
and the busy streets of Village and City. The yōkai here
might appear by a shrine or small shelter in a lonely forest,
but they also might come right down to a farmhouse or
field or a bridge in town. Some of the yōkai in this group,
particularly tanuki and kitsune, seem to be at home in
almost any setting. Many of these yōkai assume animal
form, and all of them are forces of nature—metaphors for
the mysteries of the natural world that make their presence
known to the humans who would try to control it.
SUNAKAKE-BABĀ
Sand-Throwing Granny



In “Yōkai Glossary,” Yanagita Kunio writes that this yōkai is
“found in various locations in Nara Prefecture. [She]
threatens people by sprinkling sand on them when they
pass through places such as the shadows of a lonely forest
of a shrine. Although nobody has ever seen her, it is said
that she is an old woman.”1 Sunakake-babā (alternatively
sunakake-baba) has also been recorded in Hyōgo
Prefecture and elsewhere in the Kansai area. In some
regions of the country, similar mischief is attributed to
monkeys or tanuki (sunakake-tanuki).2
Despite the fact that “nobody has ever seen her,” Mizuki
Shigeru illustrates sunakake-babā in his catalogs and has
also transformed her into one of the standard yōkai
characters in his Gegege no Kitarō series.3 If not for
Mizuki’s influence it is likely this yōkai would have
remained relatively obscure, collected in Yanagita’s work
and perhaps remembered in a few communities around
Nara. But because of Mizuki, she is now one of the most
well recognized of all yōkai.
YUKI-ONNA
Snow Woman
The yuki-onna is a female yōkai who appears on snowy
nights or in the midst of a snowstorm.
Specific names, beliefs, and narratives vary from region
to region. In Miyagi Prefecture, for example, she is called



yuki-banba; in parts of Nagano Prefecture she is known as
shikkenken; in Yamagata Prefecture, yuki-jorō; and in
Miyazaki Prefecture and the Satsuma region of Kagoshima
Prefecture, she is known as yuki-bajo (bajo being a local
term for “old woman”).
In Iwate and Miyagi Prefectures in northeast Japan, it
was said that if you saw yuki-onna, your spirit would be
drawn from your body. In parts of Aomori Prefecture, her
behavior is similar to that of the ubume: she will ask you to
hold her baby. In some parts of the country, such as Tōno,
in Iwate Prefecture, she appears on a set date; elsewhere
her appearance is random and witnessed only by
particularly lucky (or unlucky) individuals. She is variously
explained as the spirit of the snow, as the ghost of a woman
who died in the snow, or even—in Yamagata Prefecture—as
a moon princess who was kicked out of the sky-world, and
who descends, dancing, along with the snow.4 In one form
or another, the yuki-onna seems to have been commonly
known throughout the country; Toriyama Sekien puts her in
his earliest catalog, along with other yōkai for whom no
explanation was needed.5
Even with this widespread distribution throughout Japan,
the yuki-onna is probably best known today because of a
tale written in English by Lafcadio Hearn in his Kwaidan of
1904; translated into Japanese, it has been widely read
over the last century. Hearn explains in the preface that the
yuki-onna narrative he recounts was related to him “by a
farmer of Chōfu, Nishitama-gōri, in Musashi province, as a



legend of his native village.”6 One night, two woodcutters
are caught in a terrible snowstorm and take shelter in a
hut. The younger of the two, Minokichi, witnesses a
beautiful woman in white blow white smoke in the face of
his older companion, a cold breath that, he later discovers,
takes the older man’s life. The mysterious white woman
then stoops down to breathe on Minokichi’s face, but pulls
back at the last second—leaving him alive but with a
warning that she will kill him if he ever reveals what he
saw that night.
The next year, Minokichi meets a beautiful young woman
named (somewhat suspiciously!) O-Yuki. They are soon
married and lead a happy and fruitful life together, replete
with ten children. One night, however, Minokichi gazes at
his wife and, lost in reverie, tells her of his encounter with
yuki-onna so many years earlier. In that instant, his wife
flies into a rage and cries, “But for those children asleep
there, I would kill you this moment!” And with that, she
melts “into a bright white mist that spired to the roof
beams, and shuddered away through the smoke-hole.”7
Although Hearn attributes the narrative to a local farmer,
scholars have doubted the veracity of this claim because
his fully developed love story is significantly more complex
than any known local legends concerning yuki-onna.
Indeed, Hearn himself had much earlier mentioned the
simplicity of such legends in an 1893 letter to Basil Hall
Chamberlain: “The Japanese fancy,” he wrote, “has its
‘Snow-women’ too—its white spectres and goblins, which



do no harm and say nothing, only frighten and make one
feel cold.”8 It is possible then that Hearn combined a
simple Japanese legend with more complex and stylish
European literary images of a “femme fatale.” One scholar
suggests he was specifically influenced by Charles
Baudelaire’s poem “Les Bienfaits de la Lune” (The moon’s
blessings).9
Hearn’s yuki-onna tale also incorporates a variety of folk
motifs—particularly the notion of marriage between human
and nonhuman. Common to such tales is the end of the
marriage when the husband, often by accident, breaches a
promise and the wife returns to her true form. In Japan,
this motif occurs as far back as the Kojiki and Nihonshoki;
it is found in the widely distributed legends “Hagoromo”
(Feather mantle) and “Tsuru-nyōbo” (Crane wife), and there
are numerous examples of men who have married kitsune.
The motif is also common in folklore of other cultures, such
as Gaelic legends of the selkie. Such diverse sources were
likely an influence on Hearn as he successfully developed
an evocative literary narrative and created an image that
survives to this day, in Japan and abroad, as the most
resonant image of the snow woman.
KAMAITACHI
Sickle Weasel



You are walking outside and suddenly discover that your
leg has been cut as if with a sharp blade. This is said to be
the work of a kamaitachi—literally a “sickle weasel.” The
kamaitachi is an extremely widespread yōkai phenomenon
found throughout Japan, but probably most common in the
so-called snow country of northern Honshu. In most cases,
the creature inflicts its wound on the lower part of the
body, on the shin or the calf, and often there is no pain or
blood associated with the cut.10 Beliefs and narratives
about kamaitachi vary from place to place, but the creature
is often said to ride in with a powerful gust of wind or on a
whirlwind; in some places the phenomenon is known as
kamakaze, or “sickle wind.”
The origins of the word kamaitachi are unclear but may
stem from a play on kamae-tachi, which could be translated
as “poised sword.”11 Regardless of whether this play on
words led to the name or not, it is easy to imagine a weasel
as a stealthy culprit sneaking in like the wind, inflicting a
wound, and disappearing. In fact, zoologically speaking,
weasels are famous for their speed, moving “quickly and
tirelessly, investigating every hole and crevice.”12
Extremely skilled hunters with razor sharp teeth, they can
kill animals much larger than themselves, leaving only a
small wound and taking just enough meat or blood for their
immediate energy requirements. The fact that a weasel can
slip into small places and leave almost no trace of its
passage on the body of its victim may be one reason they
are associated with mysterious phenomena.



Although the word and phenomenon precede it, one of
the earliest and most influential images of a kamaitachi is a
sharp-clawed weasel in a spiraling whirlwind found in
Toriyama Sekien’s first catalog. But there are also very
different ways of characterizing the phenomenon; in Gifu
Prefecture, for example, the kamaitachi is reported to
consist of a trio of three gods: the first one pushes over the
victim, the second inflicts the injury with a blade, and the
third administers a healing salve. The wound does not
bleed and is not painful.13
Attempts have been made to explain the kamaitachi
phenomenon scientifically. It has been attributed to
changes in air pressure caused by whirlwinds or to pieces
of debris picked up by a strong gust of wind. Such
explanations, as Murakami Kenji points out, are themselves
a form of folk belief, and nothing has been proven
scientifically.14 With this in mind, it is worth mentioning
that as early as 1911 the phenomenon was taken seriously
as a medical condition worth international attention. Under
the heading of “Spontaneous Wounds,” the British Medical
Journal introduced a report by a Japanese doctor about
a form of wound which occurs spontaneously and is frequently seen in Japan,
the so-called Kamaitachi disease. The wound is suddenly formed. . . . Usually
it occurs on one of the lower limbs, sometimes the face. . . . It is known by
meteorologists that during thunderstorms a temporary vacuum may occur in
places as a result of stray air currents, and if a part of the body comes into
such a space a tear may result from the internal pressure unmodified by the
action of external pressure. The cases usually occur in outlying mountain
districts, rich in trees and streams, and it is in just such districts that in a
thunderstorm atmospheric conditions can most readily produce a vacuum of



the kind described.15
It is no coincidence that such a scientific analysis comes at
the end of the Meiji period, exactly when Inoue Enryō’s
rationalist explanations of yōkai had become common in
intellectual circles.
In contemporary Japan, the kamaitachi lends its name
and mystery to one of the first “sound novels,” or
interactive fiction games. Originally made by Chunsoft in
1994, versions (and sequels) of the game have been
available for play on PlayStation, Game Boy, Android, and
other platforms.

KITSUNE
Fox
The kitsune, or fox, is one of the most famous yōkai in
Japan; and perhaps more than any other, it has also
fascinated people outside the country. Although kitsune is
the most common generic term for this yōkai, foxlike
creatures are also known by different regional names,
including ninko, osaki-gitsune, kuda-gitsune, and
nogitsune.
The kitsune is multitalented, appearing in local folklore,
historical records, literary texts, theatrical performances,
and contemporary popular culture. It can be a dangerous
shape-shifter and it can possess people; but it is also a
standard feature of Inari worship, and stone statues of
kitsune are stationed at shrines throughout the country.
With so many different incarnations and meanings, it is fair
to say that in Japan today the kitsune—a charming and
cunning deceiver that emanates an aura of danger and
malevolence—is admired, worshipped, and feared.
Many early Japanese tales of kitsune can be traced back
to China, where the creature was also known for its shape
shifting talents, most notoriously taking on the guise of
beautiful, seductive women. Some of these tales were told
in highly literary forms and came to Japan in written
texts.16 In China, the word huli, a combination of the kanji
for kitsune and tanuki, generally indicates a fox; in Japan
the same kanji compound, pronounced kori, refers to all



sorts of supernatural and troublesome occurrences (and
includes tanuki as one of the culprits).17
In Japan, kitsune and tanuki are both famous for their
ability to shape-shift and deceive others. Tanuki tend to be
comical and less adept at their deceptions; kitsune appear
to be more serious about their performances, and their
abilities are better honed. Both creatures are members of
the Canidae family. The folkloric characteristics of the
kitsune, like those of the tanuki, reflect its zoological traits
as a creature that can live on the edges of human society
visible one moment and gone the next. The most common
fox in Japan is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), which is also
“the most widely distributed carnivore in the world.”18
Kitsune are mentioned in the earliest Japanese texts,
such as the Nihonshoki, where they seem to appear as
omens, either good or bad.19 But they have also been
turning into beautiful women and attracting men since at
least the ninth century, when one such affair was recorded
in a setsuwa collected in Miraculous Stories. A man met “a
pretty and responsive girl,” married her, and the two had a
son. At around the same time, their dog gave birth to a
puppy, which insisted on barking at the wife. One day it
startled her: “Terrified, she suddenly changed into a wild
fox and jumped up on top of the hedge.” In the end, the
couple is forced to separate, but their love remains strong
and the wife comes every night to sleep with the man, and
from this, the text explains, we get the word kitsune: to
come (kitsu) and sleep (ne).20



The etymology offered here is not generally taken
seriously today, but such narratives of faithful and caring
fox-wives are found throughout Japanese history, some
more embellished than others. One from the Tales of Times
Now Past is particularly elaborate. The year is 896, and a
man named Kaya no Yoshifuji, who lives in the village of
Ashimori in Bitchū Province, is left to his own devices when
his “wife went up to the Capital, leaving him all alone. He
was far too randy a fellow to stand this for long. One
evening at twilight, he was out for a stroll when he spotted
a lovely young girl he had not seen before, and wanted her
right away. She tried to run when he grabbed at her, but he
caught her and asked who she was. Very sweetly, she
answered, ‘Nobody.’”
Eventually Yoshifuji goes back with the girl to her house,
an attractive home filled with servants. That evening, they
sleep together: “He was so taken with her that he forgot all
about his wife. As for his house and children, he never gave
them a thought. He and the girl pledged each other eternal
love.” His new wife is soon pregnant, and when she gives
birth, “Yoshifuji had not a care in the world.”
Meanwhile, back at his human household, Yoshifuji’s
disappearance causes a great commotion and a thorough
search is undertaken, but to no avail. His family prays,
reads Buddhist sutras, and carves an image of an Eleven
Headed Kannon.
The narrative then cuts back to Yoshifuji’s new home,
where a man with a stick suddenly appears. Yoshifuji’s new



family runs away in terror, and the man pokes at Yoshifuji,
forcing him out of a narrow passageway: “This was the
thirteenth evening after Yoshifuji’s disappearance. The
people at his old home were still shaking their heads over
what had happened when a strangely dark, monkeylike
creature crawled out from under the storehouse nearby.
What could it be? Through the jabber of the excited
onlookers came a voice saying, ‘It’s me!’ It was Yoshifuji.”
Yoshifuji explains about his wonderful new life and his new
child. A servant is sent to investigate the storehouse, and
foxes run off in every direction. Although there was little
space under the storehouse, “that was where Yoshifuji had
been. Obviously a fox had tricked him. He had married the
fox and was no longer in his right mind.” His thirteen days
in the vulpine otherworld had seemed like thirteen years to
him. A monk and an onmyōji are summoned to pray for him
and exorcize him, and he is bathed over and over. When he
“finally came back to himself he was horribly
embarrassed,” but he “lived on in good health another
decade and died in his sixty-first year.”21
The narrative is wonderfully complex, presenting
different perspectives—a man’s journey into the otherworld
of the kitsune realm and, simultaneously, his family’s
search for him. The fox herself does not appear as a
demonic and deceptive monster, but is more like an
innocent victim of a man’s libidinous desires. Yoshifuji’s
casual abandonment of his first wife, followed by the
abandonment of his second (fox) wife, suggests that in the



gender dynamics of the time, the status of women and
foxes may not have been all that far apart. As with many
setsuwa, the “moral” is not necessarily clear, but at least on
one level we can interpret the tale as a warning not to take
one’s family for granted.
Another famous example, in which the narrative of love
between fox and human inspires pathos, is the story of Abe
no Yasuna, father of the great onmyōji Abe no Seimei.
Yasuna was said to have married a white fox called
Kuzunoha. The legend appeared at least as early as 1662 in
a written work called Abe no Seimei monogatari (The tale
of Abe no Seimei), but it garnered greater popularity
through its later dramatization in both puppet theater and
Kabuki. The most famous scene in the Kabuki version is the
henshin (transformation) in which an actor performs a
quick change from human to fox, a stunt that not only
flaunted an actor’s skill and the special effects of Kabuki
but also played off the kitsune’s notorious shape-shifting
powers.22
Tales of kitsune-nyōbo, or fox-wives, were collected as
late as the twentieth century. Yanagita Kunio, for example,
records one from a rural part of Ishikawa Prefecture. A
man went outside one night to use the outhouse, and when
he came back he discovered that his wife had doubled
there were two of her in the room. They looked
indistinguishable, and he could not decide which one was
the real one and which one was a bakemono. He asked
them all sorts of difficult questions, which they both



answered with ease. Finally, he made the decision that one
of them was just not quite right, so he chased her away and
kept the other woman as his wife. In the years that
followed, the household prospered and she gave birth to
two boys.
One day, the boys were playing hide-and-seek, and they
noticed that their mother had a tail! Now that her true
nature had been discovered, the fox-wife could no longer
stay with the family, and she departed in tears. But during
planting season she appeared again, this time in her fox
form, and circled the family’s rice paddies. That year, and
in succeeding years, the rice stalks appeared to be empty,
and the tax collector determined that the family owed
nothing. But when they cut the stalks, brought them into
the house and peeled back the husks, they found that they
were full of rice . . . and since they didn’t have to pay taxes
on their income, the family became wealthy.23
Inari Worship
The connection with rice cultivation in this narrative is no
coincidence. In fact, kitsune are connected with the
worship of Inari, the kami of the rice fields. Depending on
the time and place, Inari has also been associated with
farming, fishing, fertility, prostitution, and even warfare.
Inari worship in some form has presumably existed since at
least the Nara period, but it was not until the eleventh
century or later that foxes became linked with it, and not



until the Edo period that Inari shrines proliferated
throughout the country—according to some statistics there
may be almost forty thousand of them today.
The kitsune is not the Inari deity itself, but rather the
messenger or attendant of Inari. And in this capacity, a pair
of stone foxes typically stands guard in front of Inari
shrines throughout Japan. The connection between Inari
worship and the complex of beliefs associated with the
kitsune of folklore is not straightforward, but it is clear that
the two overlap and mutually influence each other, if not in
religious doctrine than certainly in the popular
imagination.24
Fox Possession
The kitsune’s dangerous ability to possess or bewitch
humans is generally known as kitsune-tsuki (fox
possession). Instances of possession have been recorded
from the time of Miraculous Stories well into the modern
period. Historically, kitsune-tsuki took many forms and
occurred for a variety of reasons. Although the term
kitsune-tsuki is not actually used in the setsuwa about
Yoshifuji mentioned earlier, certainly such a tale of
obsessive and deluded love can be thought of as a
possession story. More commonly, however, during kitsune
tsuki events a fox would take control of a person’s body in
order to communicate a message from the otherworld or
sometimes simply to torment him or her.25



There were various ways of dealing with a possession,
but in many cases an exorcist would be called in and he
would transfer the possession to a medium—as in this
setsuwa:
Once, someone in a certain house was possessed by a spirit, and when it had
been transferred to a medium, it spoke through her, as follows: “I am no evil
spirit, only a fox who happened to come wandering by. I have a young family
at home in my den who were hungry, so I came in here because it seemed to
me that in a place like this there would be some food lying about. Please give
me a feed of rice-cakes and I’ll go.” The people of the house had some rice
cakes made and offered a trayful to the girl, who ate a few and said how
delicious they were. “She only pretended it was a fox possessing her because
she wanted some rice-cakes,” grumbled the onlookers.
The spirit then spoke again. “Will you please let me have some paper, so
that I can wrap this up and take it home for the old lady and my children to
eat.” A large parcel of rice-cakes was wrapped up in two pieces of paper, and
the girl stuffed it down inside her dress, with the end sticking out by her
chest. She now said to the exorcist, “Drive me out and I’ll go away.” “Out,
out!” he cried, and the girl stood up, after which she fell flat on her face.
Presently she got up again and the parcel in her dress was missing.
What a strange thing that it should have vanished!26
Although the narrative presents a relatively frivolous
though still creepy—instance of possession, in other
situations the life of the victim might be in danger or the
fox might be acting out of revenge. Miraculous Stories, for
example, tells about a monk who is called in to cure a sick
man:
As long as he chanted a formula, the patient was cured. If he stopped,
however, the disease would return at once. . . . Making a vow to cure the
patient at any cost, the monk continued chanting the formula. Then,
possessed by a spirit, the patient said, “I am a fox. I won’t surrender easily,



so don’t try to force me!” The monk asked, “Why?” The patient replied, “This
man killed me in his previous life, and I am taking revenge on him.”
Eventually, the patient dies, and a year later, one of the
monk’s own disciples is lying sick in the same room. A
visitor comes to see the monk, and happens to tie his dog to
a post. The monk sees the dog struggling hard against its
chain and tells his visitor to set it free:
As soon as the dog was released, it ran into the room of the sick disciple and
came out with a fox in its mouth. Although the visitor tried to restrain the
dog, it would not release the fox but bit it to death.
It was evident that the dead person had been reborn as a dog to take
revenge on the fox. Ah! Revenge knows no limits.27
Centuries later, the theme of possession, revenge, and
dogs is still relevant. An Edo-period text, for example,
reports that a man named Kakubē was taking a nap when a
family of playful foxes disturbed him. He chased most of
them away, but he caught and tormented one of the cubs,
half killing it. Soon after this incident, Kakubē was
possessed by the parent fox and fell into a state of madness
and frenzy. A shugendō practitioner was called in, and he
caused the fox “to borrow Kakubē's mouth.” The fox
explained that it was tormenting Kakubē because he had
hurt its child. However, the fox continued, once in the past
a dog was pursuing it and this same Kakubē chased the dog
away. “It is because he tormented my child that I have
possessed Kakubē in order to punish him,” the fox said,
“but since I owe him for helping me in the past, I will leave



it at this.” And with that, Kakubē seemed to wake up and
return to himself.28
Symptoms of kitsune-tsuki varied. There are descriptions
of “afflicted persons who ate gravel, ashes, hair, or combs,
wandered the mountains and fields making piles of stones,
jumped into rivers or ran into the mountains, etc.”29 In
1894, Lafcadio Hearn wrote, “Strange is the madness of
those into whom demon foxes enter. Sometimes they run
naked shouting through the streets. Sometimes they lie
down and froth at the mouth, and yelp as a fox yelps.”30
Kitsune-tsuki (and other forms of possession) persisted
throughout Hearn’s time, and similar phenomena are still
occasionally identified today. But during the Meiji period,
modern Western medicine was called on to redefine fox
possession as a form of mental illness treatable by
psychiatrists. A German doctor named Erwin von Bälz
(1849–1913) wrote the first Western scientific treatise on
the subject, in 1885, giving it the medical label
alopecanthropy—akin to lycanthropy, the belief that a
person can become a wolf or werewolf.31
All these examples of fox possession entail a fox who
chooses to enter the body or psyche of a person. But
sometimes, it was thought, possession was caused by
people who could send out spirit foxes at will to do their
bidding. Known as kitsune-tsukai (fox-employers) or
kitsune-mochi (fox-owners), such people were said to be
members of hereditary lineages, families that passed the
ability to control a fox from one generation to the next. In



regions where this belief persisted, the position of fox
owners was troublesome: people identified as such were
often individuals who came from wealthy families whose
fortune was attributed by others to their devious
manipulation of foxes against their enemies. These families
were viewed negatively, their relationship with foxes
considered a contagion that others wanted to avoid. In
some places, instead of kitsune, other animal familiars
could be employed in the same fashion; these included
kitsune-like creatures called osaki and kuda, as well as
snakes and dogs (known as inugami). While such beliefs
are certainly not common anymore, cases of discrimination
because of presumed fox-ownership were, as recently as
the 1950s, noted in the news.32
Foxfire and Fox Weddings
The kitsune is a real animal that treads the borders
between this world and that. This ambiguous character,
and some of the traits that we have already seen, are clear
in the Three Realms encyclopedia:
For the most part, kitsune have a long life, and many have lived for several
hundred years. . . . When a kitsune is suffering, its call is very much like the
crying of an infant; when it is happy, it sounds like [somebody] beating on a
hollow container. By nature, kitsune are afraid of dogs; if chased by a dog,
the kitsune will most certainly emit a fart in its urgency. The odor is so bad
that the dog cannot come closer. When a kitsune is going to transform itself,
it will always place a skull [on its head], pray to the Big Dipper, and
transform into a person. . . . It deceives people, attacking them and also



exacting retribution. Kitsune like rice cooked with deep fried foods and azuki
beans.33
One of the kitsune’s favorite foods is abura-age, thin sheets
of deep-fried tofu. Noodle shops throughout Japan today
serve kitsune udon: udon noodles topped with abura-age.
Additionally, abura-age can be formed into small pouches
and filled with sushi rice to make a delicacy called inari
zushi, likewise named for its association with foxes.
The entry in the Three Realms also mentions another
kitsune talent: “By striking its tail [against the ground], it
causes fire to appear.”34 In fact, the kitsune’s ability to
make fire, known as kitsune-bi, or “foxfire,” is an old
explanation for mysterious fire balls that were occasionally
seen. In some locations the fire was attributed to the
kitsune’s tail, and in other regions to its breath. The Ōji
Inari Shrine in Tokyo was particularly famous for foxfire; it
was said that kitsune from all over the area would
congregate at the shrine every New Year’s Eve. The foxfire
they created could be seen for miles around, and based on
its brightness the local humans would predict whether that
year’s harvest would be good or bad.35
Because of their relationship with fire, kitsune were
sometimes blamed for actually starting fires. One setsuwa,
for example, tells of a retainer for the governor of Kai who
spots a fox one evening while he is heading home. He
shoots the fox in the hindquarters with an arrow, and the
fox, clearly in pain, manages to disappear. The man



continues on his journey, but “a quarter of a mile from
home he saw the fox running ahead of him carrying a
flaming brand in its mouth. What could it be up to? He
spurred his horse on. On reaching the house, the fox
changed into a human being and set the house on fire. The
retainer was ready to shoot as soon as he got within range,
but the human changed right back into a fox and got away.
The house burned down.”36
Another phenomenon associated with kitsune is kitsune
no-yomeiri, a “fox’s wedding.” The expression is used to
signify the seemingly contradictory weather phenomenon
that occurs when the sun is shining while it is raining. It
was at mysterious, paradoxical times like this that foxes got
married, or alternatively, it was the mysterious powers of
foxes that caused such paradoxical meteorological
phenomena. In several records from the Edo period, people
claim to have witnessed kitsune wedding processions. In
one case, boat captains were employed to ferry what
looked like a noble entourage, lit with lanterns, across the
river. But in the morning, the captains discovered that the
money they had received for their labor had transformed
into nothing but leaves. This is a vivid example, but in most
cases the phenomenon was noted simply as a procession of
lights seen in the distance.37 Parades of light may be rare
these days, especially in well-lit urban areas, but even
today whenever it is raining and the sun is shining,
somebody is sure to mention that a fox is getting married.

TANUKI
Raccoon Dog
Tanuki are among the most common yōkai. Folktales and
legends about them are found throughout Japan, and tanuki
have long been a presence in literature and art, in
children’s books, and more recently in films, anime, manga,
video games, and advertising. Generally they are
characterized as supernatural trickster figures, often



comical and mischievous but not necessarily murderous,
though in some narratives they come across as vicious.
Tanuki are real animals: in English they are sometimes
called badgers or, more accurately, “raccoon dogs.” They
are small, primarily nocturnal, omnivorous mammals that
look like a cross between raccoon and possum. Native
throughout East Asia, tanuki have spread to Scandinavia
and much of northern Europe. They have a high rate of
reproduction, as well as the ability to eat human-made
foods and live close to human settlement. The tanuki is a
beast of the borders, ecologically skirting the line between
culture and nature.38
The traits of the animal tanuki are reflected in its yōkai
image: tanuki seem to exist simultaneously in this world
and the otherworld. In folklore they are tricksters, often
portrayed as somewhat bumbling and potbellied, with a
penchant for drinking sake, changing shape, and
impersonating Buddhist monks. One of the tanuki’s most
famous characteristics is its gargantuan scrotum, which it
employs for all sorts of creative shape-shifting—numerous
woodblock prints and other images illustrate the powers of
this magnificent paraphernalia. Accordingly, in
contemporary Japan tanuki are fertility symbols, signs of
prosperity and good fortune: in front of restaurants, bars,
and sake shops, you can find a ceramic statuette of a
plump, wide-eyed, cheerful tanuki standing upright and
adorned with a straw hat, a jug of sake in one hand. On the



streets of a modern city, the creature radiates a sense of
joviality and traditional welcome.39
The first documented appearance of a tanuki-like
creature is in the Nihonshoki, where it is called a mujina.40
During the Heian and Kamakura periods, tanuki started
appearing in setsuwa. Tales from Uji, for example, includes
a story in which a mountain hermit, after years of deep
devotion, begins to receive nightly visits from the
Bodhisattva Fugen on his white elephant. One evening a
hunter who brings food to the hermit is invited to witness
the holy vision. But when Fugen appears, radiating a
beautiful light, the hunter is suspicious. Why would he, a
killer of animals, be permitted this glimpse of the divine?
And so he fits an arrow to his bow and shoots at the image.
The light goes out and a crashing sound is heard. In the
morning, hunter and hermit follow a trail of blood to the
bottom of a ravine where they find a dead tanuki with an
arrow in its chest.41
Historically, tanuki are often associated with foxes or
kitsune, and in some cases the two creatures are
interchangeable; the term kori, which combines the kanji
for kitsune and tanuki, was used to refer to all manner of
supernatural occurrences.42 Although generalizations are
always difficult, for the most part kitsune seem to be sly
and dangerous creatures that assume the shape of a
seductive woman; in contrast, tanuki are more comical,
often taking on the shape of a pudgy monk or other not-so
seductive figure. As in the setsuwa related earlier, despite



the temporary success of their transformations, tanuki
often end up dead.
During the Edo period, the image of the tanuki as a
ribald trickster and somewhat inept shape-shifter
continued to develop. For example, the famous folktale
“Bunbuku-chagama” (The lucky teakettle) concerns a
tanuki’s distinct inability to sustain its transformation. In
one simple version of the tale, for example, a junk dealer
asks a friendly tanuki to transform into a teakettle, which
he does with no problem. The junk dealer then sells the
kettle to a Buddhist priest, who puts the kettle on the fire.
First the kettle complains about the heat, and then out
pops the tanuki’s face, feet, and “big fat tail,” and the
creature escapes into the mountains.43 In more elaborate
versions of the tale, an entrepreneurial priest ends up
marketing the walking, talking teakettle as a moneymaking
attraction. During the Edo period, this comical image of
half transformation made for all sorts of wonderful imagery
in wood-block prints and other visual forms.44 As an
animated household object, the teakettle is also
reminiscent of tsukumogami.
Although the tanuki image from the Edo period onward
was generally a lighthearted and even friendly one,
occasionally the tanuki of lore could be quite nasty. The
famous folktale “Kachi-kachi yama” (Crackling-fire
mountain), for example, tells of a tanuki that not only kills
and cooks an old woman in soup, but then transforms itself
into the woman’s shape to serve the soup to her husband.



This tale, too, comes in hundreds of versions, some more
graphic than others, but in most cases the murderous
tanuki ends up experiencing a gruesome set of tortures:
being set on fire, given a hot pepper salve to rub on its
burns, and eventually drowning.45
The tanuki’s shape-shifting talents are used not just to
transform itself; it can also reshape the landscape. Many
local legends, for example, concern somebody walking
home after a night of sake drinking and getting hopelessly
lost in familiar terrain that has been magically transformed
by a playful tanuki. In some cases, this is because the
tanuki uses its powers to create an elaborate optical
illusion. In other cases, the mischief is of a more mundane
nature: an early-twentieth-century legend, for example,
tells of “a tanuki who is in the habit of throwing sand.
When a person is passing through at night, the tanuki will
rain down so much sand that the person will lose his way,
and then the tanuki will guide him to a river or waterside
and cause him to fall in.”46 Tanuki are also adept at
leading people astray by imitating sounds, creating what
we might call sonic mirages. They are particularly
notorious for making uncanny drumming noises by
thumping their ample bellies (hara-tsutsumi).47
The tanuki can also be found in the Edo-period
encyclopedic Three Realms, which describes its
appearance and habitat and then casually mentions that
“just like kitsune, old tanuki will often change shape
[henshin] and become yōkai. They always hide in a hole in



the ground and emerge to steal and eat grains, fruits,
chickens, and ducks. . . . And also, they enjoy themselves by
thumping on their bellies.” The entry goes on to describe
ways to cook tanuki and various uses for tanuki skin
(particularly good for making bellows, apparently).48
But even as tanuki were being recorded with this sort of
zoological detail, they continued to appear as characters in
the spooky narratives of hyaku-monogatari, such as in this
one:
In Bishū, a samurai with a salary of two thousand koku had lost his wife.
Every night, she was all he could think about. Then one night, when he set
down his light and nodded off, his dead wife, beautifully made up and
appearing exactly as she had in life, came to his bedroom. She looked [at
him] longingly and made to get under the covers. Surprised, the samurai
said, “Is it possible for a dead person to come back?” He grabbed her, pulled
her toward him, and he stabbed her three times with his sword: she
disappeared into thin air. His retainers rushed in, lit torches, and searched
everywhere, but there was nothing. When morning broke, they discovered a
trace of blood on the hole of the door latch. Thinking this was very strange
indeed, they searched and found a hole in a grove located at the northwest
corner of the property. They dug this up and found an aged tanuki, stabbed
three times and lying dead.49
Tales of tanuki are too varied and numerous to
generalize beyond noting that in the popular imagination of
Edo-period Japan, the creature was at once a common
everyday animal and a dangerous, vexing, and often
comical shape-shifting yōkai. While sometimes tanuki
appear as fleshed-out characters in a story, often they
simply serve as default explanations for the otherwise



unexplainable—odd sounds in the forest, a sense of being
watched, and strange occurrences of all sorts.
During the Meiji period, tanuki continued to appear in
oral tales and even, on occasion, made it into the
newspapers. One widely distributed story was the legend of
the phantom, or counterfeit, train (nise-kisha), in which
tanuki articulate (futile) resistance to the steam train,
perhaps the most pervasive symbol of modernizing Japan.
Here is a version of the legend reported in the Tōō Nippō
newspaper on May 3, 1889:
Just before arriving in Okegawa [station, opened in 1885] one evening, a
steam train that had left Ueno [in Tokyo] encountered another train, with its
steam whistle blowing, advancing along the same tracks from the opposite
direction. The train driver was surprised; he hastily reduced his speed and
blew his whistle wildly. The oncoming train did the same, blowing its whistle
insistently. However, the train that had appeared close [at first] did not seem
to come any closer. When he fixed his eyes on it, the train seemed to be there
but it also seemed not to be there; it was very unclear, so he increased his
speed so much that he was going to crash into the other train. But the other
train just disappeared like smoke, leaving not a trace. However, where it had
been, two old tanuki the size of dogs were found lying dead on the tracks,
having been hit by the train. Thinking they were terrible nuisances and now
they would get their comeuppances, the driver skinned them and used the
meat for tanuki soup. What a surprise that such a thing could occur these
days, during the Meiji period.50
In this kind of legend, tanuki continue their role as
shape-shifting yōkai living on the edge of human society.
Well into the twentieth century, tanuki were the go-to
explanation for anything strange—and in some areas of
Japan, they still are. In my own research, I interviewed a



man, then in his seventies, on an island in Kagoshima
Prefecture. He told me a story he had heard as a “true
story” when he was a child—the events would have taken
place in the 1930s. Here is an abbreviated translation:
Of course, there’s absolutely no way there can be a train on this island. But
in spite of that, this guy’s asleep and, you know, in those days bathrooms
were outside, so you had to put on geta and go outside or you couldn’t use
the toilet. . . . So this guy wakes up in the middle of the night and goes out to
the toilet, . . . and he hears the chiin, chiin, sound of a train. He’s never seen
a train before, never even heard the chiin, chiin, sound of a train before.
Only maybe he’s heard about it in rumor—that the train goes chiin, chiin, . . .
you know, he’s just heard people talking about it. So he hears chiin, chiin,
and believe it or not a train comes along. And he thinks, “Wow, that’s a
train,” and he runs and leaps aboard. . . . And then the train gradually goes
along the coast, and [he hears], “This is Jugoya-baba; are there any departing
passengers?” The guy thinks, I’m already on board so I may as well ride on to
the last station. . . . The next stop is Kunboigawa, so [he hears], “This is
Kunboigawa,” and . . . then there’s that shrine, Suwa-jinja, and they arrive
there and it says, “Last stop, Suwa-jinja.” In the old days there was a rocky
shore there, so they get to the shore, and then the guy gets off and arranges
the area, making a nice spot for himself.
Meanwhile, his wife [back home] is thinking, he went out for a piss and he
hasn’t come home yet. And they were just newlyweds, so she’s wondering
what could have happened, where could he have gone? So she calls the fire
department and the search begins. The firemen search throughout the area,
and when they find the guy, he tells them proudly, “Hey, I came out here by
train.”
That’s the story. Nobody’s sure what it was, but it was probably a tanuki.
There are a lot of people tricked by tanuki, so it was most likely a tanuki for
sure.51
Even though the story could be thought of as frightening
—a man getting lost in the middle of the night and having
to be rescued by the fire department—it was apparently



related as a comical but true story. Interestingly, in some
ways it is akin to the kamikakushi, or spiriting away,
narratives more often associated with tengu. In this case,
however, the tanuki appears once more as a shape-shifter
who is more playful than harmful. This may be one reason
that, as the twentieth century progressed, tanuki also
became common commercial characters, appearing as
ceramic figurines in front of shops and as mascot
characters.
The tanuki continues to be visually represented today, in
manga and anime, including Studio Ghibli’s 1994 animated
feature film, Heisei tanuki gassen ponpoko (Pom Poko, dir.
Takahata Isao). The film takes place in the late 1960s,
during a period of economic growth and urbanization, and
tells of a community of tanuki living on the outskirts of
Tokyo. Humans are planning to build a new suburb there,
which will destroy the tanuki’s native home. In a desperate
attempt to stymie the human plan, the older tanuki teach
the younger tanuki how to shape-shift, and together they
create illusions and roadblocks to stop the construction of
the suburb.52
The tanuki has also made a name for itself
internationally. In Nintendo’s Mario Bros. video game
franchise, for example, there is a raccoonlike figure with
various magical abilities called “Tanooki.” A tanuki also
appears as a big-balled protagonist in Villa Incognito
(2003) by American novelist Tom Robbins.

Throughout its long history in Japan, the tanuki has
constantly plied its trade as a shape-shifter. It has also
shifted its shape with each historical moment to conform to
diverse media and different social contexts. In today’s
Japan, it is simultaneously a real animal, a fun-loving
supernatural trickster, and a mutable character for
commercial and creative experimentation.
MUJINA
Similar to tanuki and kitsune, mujina are found throughout
Japan and are known for causing mischief and for shape
shifting. In contemporary Japanese, mujina generally refers
to a mammal called anaguma, or Japanese badger (Meles
anakuma), which is found throughout much of the country,
excluding Hokkaido. In some regions, however, mujina is
also a local name for tanuki. Whether referring to a badger
or a tanuki, legends about mujina tend to resemble legends
about tanuki; in some cases the two creatures are
interchangeable.53
The earliest reference to a mujina is found in an entry for
spring of the year 627 in the Nihonshoki: a mujina
appeared in Michinoku Province (in northern Honshu),
where it transformed itself into a person and sang.54
Numerous legends throughout Japan tell of mujina that
turn into monks; various temples possess calligraphy and
other art said to be the handiwork of a mujina.55 Toriyama
Sekien’s mujina sits at an irori (sunken hearth), looking



distinctly half human and half animal. The brief text
compares the creature’s shape-shifting talents to those of
tanuki and kitsune, mentioning that the old mujina in the
picture managed to sustain its monk disguise and carry out
its duties all day until it nodded off after eating and “let its
tail come out.”56
Perhaps not coincidentally then, the Three Realms (citing
the Chinese Bencao gangmu) explains that mujina “like to
sleep. Even when people come close, they will not awaken;
if a person sees this and bangs on a piece of bamboo, the
mujina will wake up, but it will soon go back to sleep
again.”57
BĀBŪ
This is a general name for yōkai found on Kami-Koshikijima,
a small island off the west coast of Kagoshima Prefecture.
According to a book of local history and folklore, bābū
refers to “a yōkai or frightening imaginary thing.” In order
to quiet crying children, people would say “the bābū is
coming” or “the bābū is here.”58 I have not been able to
find reference to bābū elsewhere, and this is just one
example of an extremely localized yōkai. Examples of
similarly rare or obscure creatures can be found
throughout Japan, often recorded only by local scholars and
providing evidence of the richness of regional variation and
imagination.



KUBI-KIRE-UMA
Headless Horse
Kubi-kire-uma (also kubi-nashi-uma) is, as the name
implies, a yōkai horse with no head. Folklore concerning
the kubi-kire-uma is found in various places throughout
Japan, but especially in Fukui Prefecture and the four
prefectures of Shikoku. While legends of the kubi-kire-uma
vary, these creatures are sometimes characterized as
steeds on which deities ride when they come visiting on
New Year’s Eve or the Setsubun holiday. That is, like many
yōkai and mysterious phenomena, kubi-kire-uma appear at
moments of transition—in this case during the liminal time
between the end of the old year and the start of the new.59
NUE
This hybrid creature appears in medieval texts, most
famously The Tale of the Heike (Kakuichi text, composed
1371), where it is subdued by Minamoto no Yorimasa
(1106–1180).
Most likely the nue originated in China and was
considered a bird of some sort. Its earliest appearance in
Japan is in the Kojiki and, soon after, in the Manyōshū
poetry collection (eighth century). In the latter it is called
nue-dori (nue-bird) and said to make a sad call in the forest
at night; after the call of this strange bird was heard,
purification ceremonies were performed in the palace.60



The bird in question here is probably what is now called a
toratsugumi (White’s thrush, Zoothera dauma). The kanji
for nue consists appropriately of two components: “night”
and “bird.”
The Wamyō ruijū shō (Japanese names for things
classified and annotated; 931–938) describes the call of this
bird as being a portent or omen. By the time of The Tale of
the Heike, however, the nue had become a chimera-like
hybrid made from the head of a monkey, the legs of a tiger,
and a snake’s tail, all linked by the inherently shape
shifting body of a tanuki.61
The episode in The Tale of the Heike describes two
events in which Minamoto no Yorimasa, a warrior and poet,
is called on to shoot a nue out of the sky. In the first
instance, a black cloud was seen over the emperor’s
residence every night at the hour of the ox, and the
emperor felt a sense of dread. When Yorimasa looks up into
the cloud, he sees “in it a strange shape.” He fits an arrow
into his bow, and praying, lets it fly. He hits his mark:
Everyone there brought up light
for a good look at whatever it was:
a monkey’s head, a badger’s body,
a snake’s tail, the limbs of a tiger,
and a cry like that of a thrush.
“Frightening” is hardly the word.62
Because of his success, Yorimasa gains a reputation as a
subduer of strange monsters and goes on to kill another
nue during the reign of a subsequent emperor.



In the fifteenth century, Zeami (1363–1443) composed a
Noh drama in which the tale is expressed from the deeply
sad perspective of the slain nue:
Such aimless misery, my body a caged bird,
My mind a blinded tortoise clinging to a floating log;
Bogwood buried in the sightless back
And yet not fully buried,
Why should my spirit linger on?63
The forlorn nature of the nue’s lament perhaps ties the nue
to its earliest association, in the Manyōshū, as a bird with a
sad call.

The nue does not seem to have been a common yōkai in
local lore, but it was certainly well known. Sekien includes



it in one of his catalogs, with the tip of its tail a vicious
looking snake’s head. He mentions its association with the
Yorimasa legend and also says simply that it lives deep in
the mountains.64
RAIJŪ
Thunder Beast
The raijū, or thunder beast, is said to come down to earth
with a lightning bolt during a thunderstorm; lightning scars
on a tree were sometimes attributed to raijū. Although not
the best-known yōkai today, raijū were exceedingly
common during the Edo period: numerous documents,
illustrations, and even mummified bodies record their
appearance in regions throughout Japan. In these materials
raijū come in a wide variety of sizes and shapes, ranging
from squirrel- or weasel-like creatures to beasts more akin
to dogs or large cats.65
Clearly, lightning and thunder were mysterious,
frightening, transcendent phenomena for people in the past
(and present), and it is not surprising that they were
associated with deities and mysterious creatures. The exact
relationship between raijū and thunder gods varies from
region to region, but the direct inspiration for the raijū
itself most likely came to Japan through China; scholars
believe the Chinese materia medica text Bencao gangmu,
imported to Japan in the early seventeenth century, was a



primary cause of the plethora of raijū sightings and
documentation later in the Edo period.66
To people during this time, Yumoto Kōichi suggests, the
sky was completely unexplored territory. Whereas the
depths of the ocean may have been hard to penetrate,
human beings had a direct relationship with the sea and
could make a living through fishing and diving. The sky on
the other hand, though always present and visible, was
simply not accessible. It was a place of the imagination,
where otherworlds and mysterious phenomena were always
possible.67
In the twentieth century, attempts were made to
scientifically explain raijū as animals startled or knocked
out of a tree by thunder and lightning. That is, the theory is
that raijū may be a “misinterpretation” of a real animal,
and various creatures have been nominated as the most
likely model. One fairly recent theory posits that the
creature is derived from a small, tree-dwelling animal
called a hakubishin, a masked palm-civet (Paguma larvata),
found in parts of China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. It is
commonly believed that the hakubishin appeared in Japan
only after World War II, when soldiers brought them back
from Southeast Asia as pets and they escaped into the wild.
Because Edo-period images of raijū bear a striking
resemblance to these creatures, however, some scholars
are now convinced that hakubishin have been in Japan
since much earlier.68 Whatever the case, the discussion



inspires productive interaction between folkloric
knowledge and scientific inquiry.

TSUCHINOKO
The tsuchinoko is a short, thick, snakelike creature. In
some places, it is said to be poisonous or to continue living
even after its head has been cut off. Perhaps its most
distinguishing characteristic today, however, is simply its
elusiveness, along with the quest this has inspired to prove



whether it actually exists. In the language of cryptozoology
(the study of “hidden animals”), tsuchinoko is a cryptid; or
to use a Japanese categorization, it is a UMA—an
unidentified mysterious animal.69
The word tsuchinoko can be interpreted variously,
depending on the kanji, as “child of the earth” or, more
commonly, “small mallet” or “mallet child,” a reference to
the creature’s short, stocky shape, similar to that of a
Japanese tool known as a tsuchi, which can be used as a
hammer, mallet, or pestle. In fact, one kind of small pestle
is actually called a tsuchinoko, and it is certainly likely that
the name or shape of the yōkai and the name or shape of
the tool are linked.70 In addition to tsuchinoko, there are
numerous regional names for the creature, including gigi
hebi and bachi-hebi (Akita Prefecture), koro and koro-hebi
(Fukui Prefecture) and tsuchi-korobi (Tottori Prefecture), to
mention just a few.71 Another common variant is nozuchi
(field mallet).
Since at least the Edo period, people have reported
seeing or hearing about tsuchinoko. For example, an urban
legend from the city of Kanazawa recorded in 1807
explains that there is a particular slope in the city where
strange things have occurred. It is overgrown and
somewhat spooky even in the daytime. One evening during
a light rain, a man saw something moving along the slope
in a rolling, tumbling fashion. On looking more carefully, he
discovered that it was a kind of pestle, but as thick as a
mortar and completely black. It was moving here and there.



Then suddenly it let out a burst of laughter, made a sound
like thunder, erupted in light—and disappeared. Several
people had seen similar things in the past, and in each case
the witness was ill for a few days afterward.72
The various different images and beliefs about
tsuchinoko-type creatures came together in the 1970s
during a so-called tsuchinoko boom. The boom was set off
with the publication of a book called Nigero tsuchinoko
(Tsuchinoko, escape; 1973) by Yamamoto Soseki (1919
1988), an angler and author who wrote about his own
sighting of a tsuchinoko and collected eyewitness accounts
from others. Yamamoto memorably described the creature
he saw as looking like a beer bottle. Images in the book
were picked up in manga and other mass media venues,
and excitement about the tsuchinoko spread. The book was
a key factor in making the name tsuchinoko into a generic
label for all such snakelike creatures; it was also
instrumental in transforming the tsuchinoko from yōkai
(mysterious, supernatural) to UMA (real animal but hard to
catch).73
In the opening years of the twenty-first century, there
was another tsuchinoko boom, this one occurring when a
farmer in a small town in Okayama Prefecture happened
upon the remains of a mysterious creature. The discovery
set off a frenzy in the mass media, with tabloid newspapers,
magazines, and television shows stirring up excitement.74
Eventually the body was examined by a biologist, who
pronounced it “probably a yamakagashi [tiger keelback



snake, Rhabdophis tigrinus] but not a normal one.” The
town itself had quickly become identified with the
tsuchinoko (there had been earlier sightings as well), and
today tsuchinoko is a local brand—you can, for example,
buy tsuchinoko wine.75



8
Village and City
This chapter introduces yōkai associated with human
settlements, such as cities, towns, villages, and suburbs
essentially any place people gather in large numbers.
Again, such designations are necessarily vague: some of
the yōkai listed in this chapter, such as hitotsume-kozō, are
not associated with a particular kind of place and might
just as easily be found in the rural setting of the
countryside. On the other hand, tōfu-kozō and kamikiri
seem to be cosmopolitan in their hauntings. Not
surprisingly many yōkai here originally emerged during the
Edo period, a time characterized by the intensive
development of urban centers. Some, such as kuchi-sake
onna and jinmenken, haunt the modern cities and suburbs
that developed during the rapid-growth period of the late
twentieth century.
HITOTSUME-KOZŌ



One-Eyed Rascal
Hitotsume-kozō is a widely distributed yōkai distinguished,
as its name implies, by having a single eye. This yōkai often
assumes the size and shape of a young boy about ten years
of age, and sometimes he has only one leg and a very long
tongue. Translating the word kozō is difficult: although
strictly speaking it refers to a Buddhist acolyte, it is also
commonly used to signify a boy and sometimes has a
slightly derogative or casual tone, as in “kid,” “urchin,” or
“rascal.” In the Edo-period merchant world, it also
indicated a menial employee, such as an errand boy.
Narratives about hitotsume-kozō vary; in general he is
not portrayed as particularly evil or deadly but is more like
a troublesome mischief-maker. In some legends, he scares
people by showing a face lacking a mouth and nose but
having one large eye in the middle. Occasionally he uses
his long tongue to lick people. There are, however,
traditions that portray hitotsume-kozō in a more sinister
light, as a bringer of disease and misfortune, a creature to
be avoided at all costs. Particularly in the Kanto region,
there was a belief that on certain days households were
subject to visitation by hitotsume-kozō. In order to ward off
this threat, residents put certain objects, such as bamboo
baskets, outside their homes.1 The word for bamboo
basket, mekago, is constructed of the characters for eye
and basket; one interpretation of its effectiveness against



hitotsume-kozō is that because it has so many eyes (holes),
it frightens off yōkai who have only one.2
In 1917, in one of his earliest essays on yōkai, folklorist
Yanagita Kunio examined the widespread traditions
concerning hitotsume-kozō in an attempt to trace an
earlier, “authentic” set of Japanese beliefs. He claims in the
essay, titled simply “Hitotsume-kozō,” that “with only a
little variation, this yōkai has crossed most of the islands of
Japan.” He goes on to present the “bold hypothesis” that
the tradition of hitotsume-kozō represents a remnant of
earlier customs involving human sacrifice.
Long ago, Yanagita contends, there were rituals in which
a human was sacrificed. The victim would be selected
through divination the year before the ritual was scheduled
to take place, and “in order to distinguish him from the
others, one of his eyes might be poked out. This person,
who was to work in a sacred capacity, would be treated
with a certain amount of hospitality and respect.” Although
“human knowledge advanced and such bloody rituals came
to an end,” Yanagita explains, the notion that a one-eyed
person could receive sacred intelligence from the deities
persisted. Many generations later, this connection between
one-eyedness, the sacred, and the status of being doomed
or outcast, would survive in the form of hitotsume-kozō:
Like most obake, hitotsume-kozō is a minor deity that has become divorced
from its foundations and lost its lineage. . . . At some point in the long distant
past, in order to turn somebody into a relative of a deity, there was a custom
of killing a person on the festival day for that deity. Probably, in the
beginning, so that he could be quickly captured in the event of an escape,



they would poke out one eye and break one leg of the chosen person. And
then that person would be treated very favorably and afforded great respect.
. . . After a while, [this sort of sacrificial rite] came to an end, and all that
remained was the ritual in which the eye was poked out. . . . And in due
course, the time came when putting out the eye became a superfluous
procedure. . . . Meanwhile, it was long remembered that the sacred spirits
[goryō] of the past had one eye; it is only natural that when this deity became
separated from the control of the higher gods and started to wander the
mountains, fields and roads, it came to be seen as exceedingly frightening.3

Although there is no actual evidence for Yanagita’s
assertion about the connection between human sacrifice
and hitotsume-kozō, his comments are significant because
they associate the sacred and godlike with the outcast,
doomed, or deformed. Like so many yōkai, hitotsume-kozō
is ambiguous: both worshipped and feared, held in
reverence but also excluded, a deific liminal being doomed
to wander on the edge of human society. Moreover,
hitotsume-kozō also exhibits an imbalance—one eye and
one leg—that sets it apart from “normal” human society;
his visible physical disability hints at special invisible
abilities. One-eyed monsters, such as the Cyclops of the
Greek pantheon, and one-legged or lame beings with
supernatural powers, are found in folklore from different
cultures around the world.
ISOGASHI
Busy-Body
This is a gangly, sinewy yōkai, running with his head in the
air and a huge tongue dangling out of his mouth. The name
isogashi is evidently a play on the word isogashii, meaning
busy or hectic, and this yōkai seems to be the incarnation
of that particular state of being.
The isogashi makes only rare appearances. It is featured,
complete with label, in the Hyakkiyagyō emaki (1832) by
Oda Yoshi, owned by the Matsui family in Kumamoto.4 It



appears alongside other yōkai in the scroll, but there is no
explanation—just the name written in hiragana. A very
similar creature, but with no name attached, can be found
in another hyakkiyagyō emaki that is probably also from
the late Edo period.5 Again there is no explanation, but
perhaps in the case of the isogashi no caption is needed:
with its flailing arms and lolling tongue, this creature is
clearly busy.

UBUME
Birthing Woman
The ubume is found in various forms throughout the
country and in collections of ghost stories, religious texts,



and other documents. Although details vary, she is most
commonly thought of as an incarnation of a woman who
has died during childbirth. She appears at a crossroads or
on a bridge as evening falls, her lower body covered with
blood, crying and cradling her infant in her arms. She asks
a male passerby to hold the baby, and then she leaves. In
his arms, the baby gradually gets heavier and heavier until
the man cannot move at all for fear of dropping it. (In some
versions, the baby turns into a stone.) Ubume narratives
have many different outcomes, and it is not always clear
what becomes of the baby or the woman; but at least in a
number of legends, the man is rewarded for his efforts with
great physical strength, a trait he passes down to his
descendants.6
Ubume-related narratives and beliefs vary significantly
from region to region, as does the specific name associated
with her. In Shiga Prefecture, for example, there is an
ubume-tori, and on Sado Island in Niigata Prefecture there
is an ubu.7 Textual portrayals of the ubume can be found as
far back as the Heian-period Tales of Times Now Past.8
During the Edo period, she is described in the 1687 Kokon
hyaku-monogatari hyōban, and her image as a yōkai
became solidified through illustrations in picture scrolls
such as the Hyakkai-zukan and the Bakemono zukushi and
in Toriyama Sekien’s catalog. She also became a standard
character in fiction and a popular trope in Kabuki drama,
where she was one model for the ghost of Oiwa-san, the
vengeful spirit who returns from the dead to haunt her



cruel and cheating husband, in a famous play by Tsuruya
Nanboku IV (1755–1829), Tōkaidō Yotsuya Kaidan (1825).9
Today the standard kanji characters associated with the
ubume define the situation in which she died: 産女, literally
“birthing woman.”10 Sekien, however, chooses characters
with readings not readily associated with the pronunciation
ubume, or with the image of a ghostly woman holding a
baby, but rather with a legendary Chinese bird: kokakuchō
(姑獲鳥). The kanji combination here is somewhat confusing,
but the name seems to suggest, very loosely, something
like: “bird on the hunt to become a surrogate mother.”
These same characters are found in the Tales of Times Now
Past, and they are also used in an entry in the Three
Realms, which pictures a small bird, called taufūnyau or,
colloquially, ubume-dori (ubume bird), perched in a tree.
With reference to earlier Chinese texts, the Three Realms
explains that this bird becomes a woman when its feathers
are removed: “Because this is the incarnation of a woman
who has died in childbirth, she has breasts and likes to
steal other people’s children, raising them as her own.”11
When Sekien draws the ubume, he shows the woman from
legend, standing in a river and clutching a baby to her
breast, but he labels his picture with the “bird” characters,
simultaneously referencing both Chinese precedents and
Japanese legends.12



F I G U R E 2 2 . Ubume and nuppeppō. Original illustrations by
Shinonome Kijin.
Death during childbirth was not uncommon before the
modern period, and the ubume may be related to similar
yōkai, most famously the kosodate-yūrei, or “child-rearing
ghost.” Found in many parts of Japan, legends tell of a
mysterious woman who comes night after night to buy
candy from a particular shop. Finally, one night the
suspicious shopkeeper follows her. She disappears into a
graveyard, and then he hears a baby crying. A grave is dug
up and they find the corpse of a recently buried woman
who had died during pregnancy. By her side in the grave is



a live, healthy baby. In many of the legends, the baby grows
up to be a prominent monk.13
As a yōkai, then, the ubume embodies grave and real
concerns about pregnancy and safe delivery. She also
represents the self-sacrificing spirit of motherhood. Various
Buddhist temples in Japan today are associated with the
ubume, safe childbirth, and motherhood; similarly, place
names throughout the country include the word ubume.14
Award-winning mystery writer and yōkai researcher
Kyōgoku Natsuhiko draws on the image of the ubume and
the theme of childbirth in his debut novel, The Summer of
the Ubume, which was also made into a film of the same
title in 2005 (dir. Jissōji Akio).15
NUPPEPPŌ
This yōkai looks like a somewhat amorphous fleshy blob,
with fatty folds vaguely taking on the shape of eyes, nose,
and mouth. It also has saggy, semiformed arms and legs, so
it appears to be a kind of walking—or rather, staggering
lump of flesh. Despite this disgusting description, however,
the nuppeppō is generally illustrated as somewhat cute and
humorous.
The nuppeppō image can be found in Edo-period texts,
including Sekien’s Gazu hyakkiyagyō and emaki such as
Bakemono zukushi, Hyakkai-zukan, Bakemono emaki, and
Hyakkiyagyō emaki. However, none of these works explain
the characteristics or behavior of the creature, and it does



not appear in any known legends or beliefs during this
time.
By the late twentieth century, presumably through the
creative energies of Mizuki Shigeru, the character of the
nuppeppō had become more fleshed out (pun intended).
Mizuki explains, for example, that this yōkai (he writes
“nuppefuhofu”) is the “spirit of flesh” that haunts deserted
temples; if a monk chooses to sleep in such a temple, he
might be awakened by the creature walking through the
hallways. The objective of its nocturnal wanderings is
unknown, but since this yōkai may be “the flesh of a dead
body walking by itself, it is not a particularly pleasant
thing.”16
The word nupperi (also nopperi) means “flat-faced,” and
it is likely that the nuppeppō derives its name or
countenance, or both, from this connection. The idea of a
flat or expressionless face also coincides with that of a
related yōkai, the nopperabō, which may be a later, more
developed version of the nuppeppō.17
NOPPERABŌ OR NUPPERABŌ
This yōkai looks like a human until you see its face, which
is completely featureless, lacking eyes, nose, mouth, and
any kind of expression—a face as smooth as an egg.
The iconic nopperabō legend is recounted by Lafcadio
Hearn in Kwaidan. Late at night, a man was walking along
the edge of a moat when he came upon a young woman



crouching at the edge of the water, crying with her face in
her sleeve. He asked what was wrong and if he could help,
but she did not respond. Finally she turned around,
“dropped the sleeve, and stroked her face with her hand;
and the man saw that she had no eyes or nose or mouth,
and he screamed and ran away.” He saw a light up ahead,
which turned out to be the lantern of a traveling soba
noodle stand, and “he flung himself down at the feet of the
soba-seller” and tried to explain what he had seen. “‘Was it
anything like this that she showed you?’ cried the soba
man, stroking his own face—which therewith became like
unto an Egg. . . . And, simultaneously, the light went
out.”18
This type of tale is common. In Aomori Prefecture, for
example, where the nopperabō is called a zunberabō, there
is a story about a man walking through the mountains
singing, who hears a voice singing the exact same song
only more skillfully. He asks who it is, and a blank-faced
zunberabō appears and says, “Me!” The man escapes to a
nearby village and recounts his experience to an
acquaintance there. The acquaintance asks, “Did that
zunberabō look like this?” and turns to him with the same
blank face. The man faints and, it is said, dies soon
afterward.19
Similarly, in Higo Province (present-day Kumamoto
Prefecture), this yōkai is called nopperabon. A man is
traveling through the mountains, when night falls. He is
relieved to see a lantern up ahead and calls at the house to



see if he can stay for the night. An old woman comes to the
door—with no nose, eyes, or mouth. The traveler runs in
fright, coming eventually to a village. When he describes
his encounter to a young woman there, she asks whether
that “bakemono looked like this”—and shows him her blank
face.20
In the Hearn story quoted earlier, Hearn never mentions
the name nopperabō. In fact, he calls the short narrative
“Mujina,” a reference to a tanuki-like creature with a
reputation for shape-shifting mischief. While Hearn’s use of
mujina here may be misleading, in many regions nopperabō
is indeed attributed to the machinations of shape-shifting
animals, such as mujina, kitsune, and tanuki. In the 1994
anime Pom Poko, tanuki enact a scene reminiscent of the
one portrayed by Hearn; the victim in this case is a
policeman, who runs for help to a convenience store—an
updated version, perhaps, of Hearn’s soba stand.
The nopperabō is most likely related to the nuppeppō,
though the key difference here is that the nopperabō has a
head and face (but no features on it), in contrast to the
nuppeppō, who has no body but just a face. Both nupperi
and nopperi mean “flat-faced.” The suffix bō literally refers
to a monk but can also indicate a young boy; here (and in
other examples) it seems to anthropomorphize (or yōkai-ify)
the thing being described—that is, the nopperabō is the
personification of facelessness.21
In Miyazaki Hayao’s film Spirited Away, there is a being
called a “kaonashi,” literally “no-face.” There are no



folkloric records of a yōkai with this name and exact
description, but it may be at least in part inspired by the
nopperabō.
KAMIKIRI OR KAMIKIRI-MA
Hair Cutter or Hair-Cutting Demon
Kamikiri (also kamikiri-ma) refers to a strange phenomenon
in which a person’s hair is suddenly cut. It was documented
especially during the Edo period in collections of urban
legends and other contemporary observations, such as
Shokoku rijindan (1743) and Mimi bukuro (1814).
In Shokoku rijindan, for example, poet Kikuoka Senryō
(1680–1747) reports that during the early Genroku period
(1688–1704) men and women walking home at night might
suddenly have their hair cut off right at the point where it
was tied. This occurred all over Japan but was particularly
common in Matsuzaka City (in current-day Mie Prefecture).
Some people would not even realize their hair had been cut
off, and it would remain lying in the street. In one case, it
was not until a woman arrived home that people told her
her hair was gone—at which point she fainted in terror. The
phenomenon was also reported in several places in the city
of Edo, where the victims were female shop employees.22
Miyata Noboru notes other instances of kamikiri attacks
throughout the Edo period, labeling it a “serial crime” and
pointing out that most victims of kamikiri were young



women, and that the incident usually occurred at twilight.
One explanation at the time was that it was caused by “a
demonic wind blowing in from a foreign place [ikoku],” and
that to counter it you had to call on the winds of the deity
of Ise to protect you. Apparently, spells were intoned to this
effect, and some women would write out the words of the
prayer on a piece of paper they inserted into their
hairpins.23
Various other explanations were offered. It was
suggested, for example, that this might be caused by
kitsune. In Mimi bukuro, Negishi Yasumori (1737–1815)
explains that in one particular neighborhood three women
had their hair cut off. Finally a wild fox was caught and its
belly sliced open. They found female hair inside.24
Another common explanation takes the strange
phenomenon of having one’s hair cut and transforms it into
a strange creature that does the cutting. Specifically it was
said that the culprit was a kamikiri-mushi, a “hair-cutting
insect.”25 Although there are no eyewitness accounts of
this insect-yōkai, it was visualized in Edo-period picture
scrolls such as Bakemono zukushi and Hyakkai-zukan,
where it was shown in action with a devilish birdlike face, a
pincer hand, and a lock of freshly cut hair falling to the
ground. Toriyama Sekien does not include a kamikiri in his
catalogs, but does draw a scorpion-like yōkai labeled
amikiri, or “net cutter.” Significantly, the amikiri comes
right after his image of a kamaitachi, a yōkai similarly
known for its ability to cut.26 One possible reason for the



association of kamikiri with the insect world stems from its
similarity in sound to kamakiri, the Japanese word for a
praying mantis—a large insect that seems ready to attack
with scythelike (kama) front limbs, and which is in fact
carnivorous.
It is worth noting also that hair has long been
symbolically significant in Japanese culture. In Heian
period texts such as The Tale of Genji, long luxurious
female hair projected beauty, sexuality, and wealth. In
Genji, as well as later military tales such as The Tale of the
Heike, both women and men cut off their hair on becoming
Buddhist nuns or monks. The phrase “cut off one’s hair”
became a kind of shorthand for taking religious vows and
renouncing the material world. At other times, too, such as
the genpuku coming-of-age ceremony held to celebrate a
boy’s initiation into manhood, cutting off hair represented a
symbolic change in status. Throughout the Edo period, hair
also revealed a great deal about people: women’s hairstyles
could vary with age, marital status, social position, and
employment. For men, the topknot (chonmage) transmitted
information on status, profession, and lineage. All this is to
say that the kamikiri resonated meaningfully in Edo
society: having your hair cut suddenly and without your
knowledge would have been a violent physical and symbolic
experience.

TŌFU-KOZŌ
Tofu Boy
This yōkai seems to have appeared suddenly during the
An’ei period (1772–1781), particularly in the popular
literary form of kusazōshi, especially the illustrated books
known as kibyōshi, or “yellow covers.” Tōfu-kozō flourished
during this time, lingered into the Meiji period, and then



was forgotten, reemerging only recently as scholars began
to explore kibyōshi and similar texts.27 There is no known
folkloric evidence of the tōfu-kozō; he appears to be a
character born within the popular literature and mass
media of the Edo period.
Even within this context, however, tōfu-kozō assumed a
variety of appearances. Most typically he was pictured as a
small boy, often with an oversized head, wearing a bamboo
rain hat and holding a block of tofu, as if delivering it or
offering it to somebody. There are variations on this: in
some cases he has a single eye (like hitotsume-kozō), or is
sticking out his tongue, and sometimes he has claws
instead of feet. One of the most common, if not defining,
features is a Japanese-maple-leaf (momiji) shape imprinted
on the side of the tofu he is offering. In general, he is
comical and cute, and as literature scholar Adam Kabat
points out, no matter what story you read, tōfu-kozō is
never portrayed as being explicitly bad. Rather there is
something a little lonely about him; he is often shown
walking behind people who don’t seem to want to talk with
him.28
Because of his sudden appearance in the second half of
the eighteenth century, the origins of this little creature
remain an intriguing mystery; he may have been born of a
play on words of some sort, or he may have first been
promoted as an advertising mascot. He also may be a
topical reference to a now forgotten popular sensation or
news event.29 One unusual recent theory suggests a



connection between tōfu-kozō and an Edo-period smallpox
epidemic that claimed the lives of numerous children and
often left survivors pockmarked and occasionally blinded.
Because the cause of the illness was not readily
understood, a variety of folk remedies were employed,
including the use of particular colors and designs that were
believed to ward off the smallpox god (hōsō-gami). Similar
design patterns can be found on the tōfu-kozō’s clothing as
it is illustrated in kibyōshi texts, suggesting that he may
have developed as a popular-culture parody of the smallpox
god, or perhaps he was a charm to protect against the
illness.30 Whatever his origins, the tōfu-kozō took on a life
of his own as an odd little character who seemed to take
pleasure in surprising people with his offer of tofu.
NEKOMATA
Split-Tailed Cat or Forked Cat
BAKENEKO
Monster Cat or Goblin Cat
There are numerous examples of yōkai cats in Japanese
folklore, where they are portrayed as everything from
lighthearted tricksters to vicious monsters. Presumably the
quiet, intelligent mien of the cat, along with its stealthy
prowling behavior and powerful vocal abilities, contributes



to a sense of mystery and otherworldliness. In Japan, like
many places in the world, cats seem to occupy an
ambiguous position in human lives; they sit calmly, purring,
on our laps one minute and go off chasing rats the next.
They are both domestic and wild, comfortable in either
urban or rural environments, simultaneously an intimate
part of the human world and part of the natural world.
Perhaps it is not surprising that cats, both feral and
domestic, play an important role in yōkai folklore.
One common cat yōkai, the nekomata, is characterized
by a forked tail. It was said that when a cat reached a
certain age, its tail would bifurcate and it would begin
acting in a dangerous and suspicious manner. One early
nekomata story, from the year 1233, tells of a creature with
eyes like a cat and a body like a large dog. It devoured
seven or eight people in a single night.31 In many cases
nekomata are described as exceedingly large cats living in
the mountains and forests, but they are also found in
populated cities and towns.32
Toriyama Sekien illustrates a nekomata in his first
catalog; it stands on two legs on the outer veranda of a
house, with a small towel (tenugui) on its head. Another cat
—presumably not a yōkai—sits on the ground below it,
while a third seems to be looking out from inside the house.
Although Sekien does not explain anything here, the
nekomata is portrayed as betwixt and between the human
and natural worlds. It is wild but wears a towel on its head,
stands on two legs like a person, and is perched literally on



the outer edge of a human habitation, with one cat outside
(feral?) behind it and another inside (domestic?) in front of
it. The fact that there is no commentary suggests that the
nekomata was such a commonly recognized yōkai that
explanation was not necessary.33
Another yōkai cat is called bakeneko, which might be
loosely translated as “monster cat.” While bakeneko
generally look no different from regular cats—no split tail
like a nekomata—their monstrousness is similarly
attributed to age. In some parts of Japan it was said that a
pet cat kept longer than a certain number of years (the
exact number varied by location) would kill its master or,
more commonly, turn into a bakeneko and perform all sorts
of mischievous acts. Such misbehavior might be comical
speaking in a human voice, for example, or dancing around
with a towel on its head—or it might be terrifying, such as
turning into a human, molesting travelers, possessing
people, or manipulating the bodies of the dead.34
The most famous bakeneko narrative is “Nabeshima no
bakeneko sōdō” (The disturbance of the bakeneko of
Nabeshima), a legend that developed from a succession
dispute, known as the Nabeshima Disturbance, that
occurred in Hizen (present-day Saga Prefecture) in the late
1500s. Some versions of the Nabeshima legend are simple
tales of revenge, while others recount a complex plot
featuring a demon cat in the guise of a woman who is foiled
only by the intense loyalty of one of the Nabeshima clan
retainers. The narratives themselves probably did not



originate until the late Edo period, long after the original
disturbance, but they became popular through
sensationalist Kabuki and kyōgen plays, as well as through
wood-block-print illustrations. In the twentieth century,
versions of the tale were made into movies, such as Hiroku
kaibyō-den (The Haunted Castle, 1969, dir. Tanaka
Tokuzō).35

KUDAN
Human-Faced Bovine
The kudan is a cow or bull with the face of a human. Upon
being born it will utter a prophecy and then die. It is said to
appear at times of social upheaval or rapid change, and its
prophecy often concerns a natural disaster or an epidemic
of some sort. The prophecy is guaranteed to come true.
Kudan are quintessential examples of what Yumoto Kōichi
calls “prophesy beasts” (yogenjū).36
Evidence of the kudan is first found during the Edo
period, when it is mentioned primarily in kawaraban
newssheets. The earliest known reference is to a prediction
made in 1705 about the harvest for the following year. A
famous 1836 kawaraban, complete with line drawing of a
bull with a human face, explains that the newssheet itself
can be posted in the house, where it will ward off evil and



bring good fortune.37 In other words, the kudan itself may
be an omen of bad things to come, but the representation
of the kudan on paper is, in the parlance of religious
studies, apotropaic—it can protect against these very
things.
Along with images of kudan, physical representations
(made through skillful manipulation of the carcasses and
skins of cows or pigs) and mummified bodies were
displayed at misemono spectacle shows. Kudan appeared
throughout the Meiji period, during times of epidemic and
hardship, and even during World War II, when a rumor
circulated that one had predicted Japan would lose the
war.38
The kanji that signifies kudan (件) is constructed of two
parts perfectly indicating its hybrid nature: 人 meaning
person and 牛 meaning cow or bull. This character is
commonly found in Edo-period deeds and legal agreements,
where the phrase kudan no gotoshi was used as a pledge
meaning roughly: “It is guaranteed to be as stated here.”
Literally translated, however, the phrase reads, “Like the
kudan,” presumably a reference to the fact that what the
kudan says is guaranteed to come true. Scholars suspect
that the phrase, and the kanji character itself, may have
preceded the yōkai. In other words, the character, made
from the elements for human and bovine, inspired wordplay
in which the yōkai—constructed from human and bovine
elements—was imagined.39 Given this use of the phrase in



legal contracts, the kudan’s prophecies would be, as it
were, legally binding.

Shinonome Kijin.
NURARIHYON OR NŪRIHYON
There is some confusion about the exact identity of the
nurarihyon. An image of a big-headed, bald, monklike
figure appears under this name in Sawaki Sūshi’s Hyakkai
zukan of 1737; Sekien also draws a similar image in his



first catalog almost forty years later. It is possible that
Sekien’s original name for this yōkai was nūrihyon, with
nurarihyon being a later misreading.40
Neither of the images mentioned here has a description,
so the nature of the creature is uncertain. In recent years,
however, the nurarihyon seems to have acquired various
characteristics: particularly his role as a leader of yōkai,
and his tendency to sneak into your house and drink your
tea. This is, for example, how Mizuki Shigeru describes the
nurarihyon in one of his many compendia.41 These traits,
however, are not found in known folklore or documentary
materials, and their origins are difficult to trace. Tada
Katsumi points out that in 1929, folklorist Fujisawa
Morihiko (1885–1967) labeled an image of nurarihyon with
the caption “leader of yōkai” (yōkai no oyadama). Fujisawa
provides no explanation or rationale for this designation,
but ever since that time nurarihyon has occupied this
leadership role.42
A somewhat different yōkai, too, goes by the name of
nurarihyon. This one is an ocean yōkai reported in the
Okayama area. The name presumably comes from
onomatopoetic interpretations of its actions: a spherical
object like a human head is seen bobbing in the water;
when sailors reach out to seize it, the object slips away
(nurari-to) and disappears under the waves, only to bob up
(hyon) a few seconds later. This happens over and over
again.43



Similarly, in a standard Japanese dictionary, the word
nurarihyon is described as being synonymous with
nurarikurari, which refers to something (or somebody) with
no place to grab onto. In this case, nurarihyon is written
with the characters for “slippery” and “gourd,” and an
analogy is made to a famous Japanese proverb about the
futility of attempting to catch a catfish with a gourd.44 It is
possible that this word for a hard-to-grasp slippery thing is
entirely unrelated to the monk figure illustrated by Sawaki
and Sekien; however, one might easily imagine a
connection between the elusive bobbing object in the ocean
and a slick, bulbous-headed (catfishlike) yōkai who slips in
and out of your house. Certainly the idea of something that
is definitely there but ultimately ungraspable is a tempting
metaphor for yōkai in general—perhaps one of the reasons
nurarihyon has come to be a leader in the pantheon.
Indeed, despite or perhaps because of its elusiveness,
the nurarihyon is a darling of modern mass media. Mizuki
features one as a recurring character in his manga and
anime, and more recently he has become the title character
for a manga series by Shiibashi Hiroshi called Nurarihyon
no mago (Grandchild of nurarihyon). The series
commenced publication in 2008 in the manga magazine
Shūkan shōnen janpu (Weekly Shōnen Jump) and has since
been made into a television anime series; it is also popular
in its English-language translation as Nura: Rise of the
Yōkai Clan.



TOIRE NO HANAKO-SAN
Hanako of the Toilet
Toire no Hanako-san is a ghostly girl who haunts school
bathrooms. She is the protagonist of a popular
contemporary legend that has circulated widely throughout
Japan since at least the 1980s, though there are also older
variants. Details differ from school to school, but typically it
is said that if you go to the girls’ bathroom on the third
floor and knock three times on the door of the third toilet
stall, a girl’s voice will answer. In some versions, the door
swings open but nobody is there. Sometimes it is explained
that Hanako will answer if you call her name or say,
“Hanako-san, let’s play!” And in some versions, Hanako
does appear: a little girl with a bob haircut, dressed in a
white blouse and red skirt.45
Common to many versions of the legend is the emphasis
on the number three, and one alternate name for the girl
yōkai is “Hanako-san of the third [toilet]” (Sanbanme no
Hanako-san). An old variant of the legend from 1948
(collected in Iwate Prefecture), for example, explains that
among the students of a particular elementary school there
was a taboo about using the third toilet in the bathroom
behind the gymnasium: “If you went in there and called,
‘Hanako-san of the third,’ a large white hand would
suddenly reach out of the toilet.”46
The other critical element of the legend, of course, is the
bathroom. In fact, bathrooms are surprisingly common



sites for yōkai encounters. Legends of kappa reaching their
hands out of outhouse toilets, for example, are found
throughout Japan. In many ways the bathroom is a
dangerous liminal space, exactly the sort of no-man’s-land
that yōkai like to frequent. In particular a school bathroom
is shared, and in this sense it is very public; at the same
time, however, it is also the most private of spaces, in
which a person literally exposes herself. Moreover, a toilet
—with its hole leading to somewhere else—can be thought
of as a kind of portal to another world. The bathroom, then,
is a distinct space in the school, with its own special
function (and its own special odors); it is a space of
vulnerability and transition and potential danger.
Schools, too, are particularly vital spawning grounds for
spooky lore and yōkai legends, so much so that in the last
thirty years an entire genre of eerie story has grown up
around them. In the 1980s and 1990s, folklorist Tsunemitsu
Tōru (b. 1948) collected and analyzed many of these so
called gakkō no kaidan, or “eerie tales of the schoolhouse,”
leading eventually to a number of books, television series,
and several films. The legend of Toire no Hanako-san was
also made into a manga and two hit films in the 1990s; a
new film was released in June 2013.47 As with most
contemporary legends, there is a feedback loop between
popular-culture depictions of the legend (and character)
and the oral narratives related in local schools, with
students incorporating details from manga and movies into
the word-of-mouth versions and vice versa.



The school environment functions as a small community,
with each set of students representing a different
generation; legends are passed from one generation to the
next, reinterpreted and re-created in accordance with the
needs and anxieties of the current group of students
occupying the school. In some variants of the Hanako
legend, Hanako is described as the ghost of a student who
died. In this context, she becomes a kind of ancestral spirit,
the belief in her existence transmitted through time and
across generations.
The legend might also be analyzed in terms of the
anxieties of the young girls who commonly tell it. In middle
school and the upper grades of elementary school,
presumably many girls are concerned about puberty and
menstruation—physical experiences that can be frightening
and mysterious, and that they may confront in the school
bathroom. Perhaps it is no coincidence that when Hanako
san does appear, her skirt is bright red, the color of
blood.48
ROKUROKUBI
Pulley Neck
NUKEKUBI
Removable Head



The rokurokubi appears as a normal woman whose head
can become completely detached from her body or,
alternatively, remain attached by a long threadlike neck. In
either case, the head has the ability to fly around and act of
its own accord. During the Edo period, narratives about
rokurokubi appeared in several hyaku-monogatari
collections and other texts, and Toriyama Sekien includes
an image in his Gazu hyakkiyagyō. Although rokurokubi are
usually portrayed as female, there are also male rokurokubi
and occasionally even an entire family of them.
The idea of a rokurokubi with a fully detachable head
most likely came from Chinese folk and literary sources.
The Three Realms, for example, references several Chinese
texts that describe a “flying-head tribe,” glossed as
rokurokubi, living in parts of China and Southeast Asia. At
night, their heads separate from their bodies and, with ears
flapping like wings, fly around chomping on insects; in the
morning the heads reattach themselves.49
The word rokuro refers to a pulley, a device that
facilitates the extending or retracting of a rope or cable. In
Japan, visual images of the rokurokubi generally show the
neck stretching and swirling in a snakelike fashion, while
the head is never completely separated. During the Edo
period, lighthearted narratives of rokurokubi appeared in
numerous illustrated kusazōshi texts; sometimes she is
paired with mikoshi-nyūdō, a male yōkai endowed with an
elongated, elastic neck.50 The rokurokubi has long
provided a fascinating subject for visual artists, including



Kawanabe Kyōsai and Mizuki Shigeru. More recently, she
has appeared in films, where computer graphics extend the
imagistic possibilities of her stretchable neck.
In Kwaidan, Lafcadio Hearn records a compelling story
of a rokurokubi or nukekubi encounter, the first extended
discussion of this yōkai in English. A samurai-turned
wandering-priest finds himself staying the night with a
woodcutter and his family. After reciting prayers until late
into the night, the priest gets up to get some water to drink
and discovers the woodcutter and his family lying in their
sleeping room, with no heads! He realizes that he has
“been lured into the dwelling of a Rokuro-Kubi.” Sneaking
outside, he sees the heads flitting around and eating worms
and insects. He also overhears them discussing how
delightful it will be to devour the “traveling priest.”
Fortunately, however, he recalls an old text in which it is
written that if you “remove the body to another place, the
head will never be able to join itself again to the neck. . . .
When the head comes back and finds that its body has been
moved, it will strike itself upon the floor three times,
bounding like a ball,—and will pant as in great fear, and
presently die.”51 Using his cunning, as well as his great
strength, the priest escapes with his life and a souvenir
head.
The notion of a detachable head that flies around at night
while the body sleeps or is otherwise unaware of what is
going on may be related to a belief that the spirit can
become separated from the body. As early as the Heian



period, narratives tell of ikiryō, spirits of living people who
detach from their bodies to possess others or wreak havoc,
all without the knowledge of their owners. This is most
famously portrayed in Murasaki Shikibu’s The Tale of Genji;
in a series of disquieting episodes, the spirit of the jealous
but still-very-much-alive Lady Rokujō slips from her body to
haunt and torment her rivals—all without her own
knowledge. The case of the rokurokubi also raises profound
philosophical questions about the seat of the spirit and the
intellect—whether a “person” is defined as head or body or
as a perfect linking of both.
KUCHI-SAKE-ONNA
Slit-Mouthed Woman
Kuchi-sake-onna, literally “slit-mouthed woman,” is the
name of a modern female yōkai. She is the protagonist of a
contemporary legend that first appeared at the end of 1978
and spread throughout Japan within a few months. As with
all such legends, there are many variations, but the basic
narrative describes her as an attractive young woman,
perhaps in her twenties or early thirties, who wears a white
mask over her mouth, a common practice in Japan for
somebody with a cold. In the case of the kuchi-sake-onna,
however, the mask covers up a mouth hideously slit from
ear to ear. She stands on an urban or suburban street,



often at dusk, and approaches children on their way home
from school:
This woman with a white mask and long hair would come from behind and
tap you on the shoulder. When you turned to look, she would ask, “Am I
pretty?” [Watashi kirei?] If you said, “Yes, you’re pretty,” she would ask,
“Even like this?” [Kore demo?], and remove the mask and threaten you. Or if
you said, “You’re not pretty,” she would come chasing after you. When I
parted with my friends on the way home from school, and it was getting
dark, I would be frightened if I thought about it.52

illustrations by Shinonome Kijin.



For six months, the legend traveled throughout Japan,
assuming local characteristics wherever it went, scaring
children walking home from school alone, and reportedly
inspiring extra police patrols in some locations.53 The
basic story became so well known that even today the
phrases Watashi kirei? and Kore demo? can have an eerie
ring to them.
Many attempts have been made to link kuchi-sake-onna
to earlier demonic female yōkai in Japan, and certainly one
can find connections with ubume, yuki-onna, yamamba, and
others. The sudden reveal of her hideous mouth may even
be related to the gabu, a type of mechanical head used in
Bunraku puppet theater since the Edo period: with a pull of
a string, an attractive female face turns demonic, complete
with a slit mouth, sharp teeth, and sometimes horns.
Additionally, the ear-to-ear slit-mouth motif is sometimes
found in descriptions of both oni and yamamba. Whatever
her precedents, however, the kuchi-sake-onna was first
documented in Gifu Prefecture in December 1978; by June
1979 there were reports in every prefecture.54 According
to one set of statistics, some 99 percent of children in Japan
were aware of the legend in one form or another.55
As the kuchi-sake-onna narrative traveled through the
country, it took on local characteristics and was often set in
streets and neighborhoods familiar to the tellers. The story
itself also became more and more elaborate. Sometimes the
kuchi-sake-onna carried a scythe or a knife and threatened
to slit her victim’s mouth to make it like hers. Her behavior



might depend on the way you answered the question Am I
pretty? Often the only way to escape was to respond with
an ambiguous “So-so.”
She also acquired various personality traits and
backstories. It was said that she was fond of a hard candy
known as bekkō-ame. She had once been an Olympic
athlete and could run extremely fast. But you could escape
her if you ran into a record shop or repeated the word
pomade (pomādo) three times. The number three appears
again and again in the legend cycle—there are sometimes
three kuchi-sake-onna sisters, for example, and the kuchi
sake-onna is often associated with place-names containing
the character for “three” (e.g., Sangenjaya, Mitaka).56
Versions of the legend include explanations for her slit
mouth, often attributing it to a horrible mistake incurred
during cosmetic surgery:
The kuchi-sake-onna came into being because there was this very beautiful
woman, but she was concerned that her mouth was too small so she went to
a certain cosmetic surgery clinic and had an operation. But there was a
mistake with the operation to make her mouth larger, and the instant she
saw her face after the operation, she went insane and became the kuchi
sake-onna. Usually she wears a large mask and asks people “Am I pretty?” If
they say “Yes,” she will remove the mask, say, “Even like this?” and show her
mouth. If you see that and try to escape, she will come after you, and kill you
with a scythe. She is exceedingly fast and can soon catch anybody, but she
has the weakness of not liking the odor of pomade, so if you say “pomade,” it
is said that you can escape her.57
And from Kanagawa Prefecture:
There are three sisters. The oldest had cosmetic surgery, and mistakenly her



mouth was slit open. The second sister was in a traffic accident and her
mouth was slit open. Because of that, the youngest sister went insane, slit
open her own mouth, and was put into a mental hospital. She escaped and
has appeared in town. Her hair is long, she always wears a mask, and [she]
holds a scythe in one hand. If you give her candy [bekkō-ame], she won’t
chase after you. Or if you say “pomade” you can run away.58
There are many descriptions of the kuchi-sake-onna’s
image and behavior, but several motifs are common: (1) she
is a young woman, (2) her mouth is slit from ear to ear, (3)
she asks, “Am I pretty?” and (4) her mouth is covered by a
mask, the removal of which is frightening. Although
methods of escape, types of weapon, clothing, and so on all
vary, these four elements seem key to her identity and to
the storyline of the legend.
One reason the legend spread so rapidly is that the
kuchi-sake-onna became a media darling: in addition to
being spread by word of mouth, her story was broadcast
nationwide on television and late-night radio and discussed
in weekly magazines and sports tabloids. The legend seems
to have reflected real social concerns, such as the
alienation children might feel while growing up in a world
of concrete apartment complexes. It has also been
suggested that she represented a monstrous version of an
“education mama,” a term for an overly enthusiastic
mother who pressures her children to do well in school.59 I
argue that the mask also symbolizes awareness of
environmental illnesses, since at the time such masks were
occasionally worn to protect against air pollution. This
practice is even more prevalent today in Japan and other



(especially Asian) countries, where masks are used to filter
out polluted air and allergens.60 Moreover, during the
1970s the women’s liberation movement became more and
more active in Japan, so the legend’s appearance at this
time might reflect social anxieties over changing roles for
women.61
The commotion over the kuchi-sake-onna died down after
about six months, but by that time she had already become
a permanent member of the yōkai pantheon, an example of
a modern urban-suburban monster. She has been famously
illustrated by Mizuki Shigeru, of course, and has appeared
in numerous other manga and anime. She has also surfaced
in Korea (wearing a red mask) and, more recently, become
a film star, mentioned in the blockbuster horror movie
Ringu (Ring, 1998, dir. Nakata Hideo) and featured as the
protagonist of a series of Japanese horror movies (Kuchi
Sake-Onna [Carved: The Slit-Mouthed Woman], dir.
Shiraishi Kōji, 2007; Kuchi-Sake-Onna 2 [The Scissors
Massacre], dir. Terauchi Kōtarō, 2008). The example of the
kuchi-sake-onna demonstrates the way in which “folk”
knowledge is profoundly intertwined with popular media
and commercial culture, as well as with broader social
anxieties. It also reminds us that yōkai are not merely a
thing of the past but are constantly being created and re
created.
JINMENKEN



Human-Faced Dog
In the second half of 1989, an urban legend featuring a dog
with a human face, called a jinmenken, caused excitement
across Japan, primarily among elementary school children.
The rapid transmission of the rumor was propelled by mass
media, especially weekly magazines and sports tabloids.
The modern precedent for a yōkai becoming a media
sensation had been established by the kuchi-sake-onna
almost exactly ten years earlier, but the jinmenken may
have been even more prominent in this context than its
predecessor.62 Perhaps because of their propulsion
through mass media rather than by word of mouth, stories
about jinmenken never became complex and seem to have
been told more for comic effect than out of belief or fear
at least among adults.
In most cases, an encounter with a jinmenken was brief,
startling, and comic: you see a dog rummaging through
garbage, it looks up at you with a human face and says,
“Just leave me alone [hottoite kure]!”63 A variety of similar
utterances were attributed to the dog, but in most cases
the implication was something akin to “What do you think
you’re looking at?” Sometimes the encounter would occur
while people were driving: running at a tremendous speed,
a dog would overtake the car and then look back with its
human face. The jinmenken was variously explained as the
result of a DNA experiment or as the ghost of a person hit
by a car while walking a dog.64



There have been occasional accounts of dogs with human
faces in Japan since at least 1810, when it was reported
that a human-faced puppy was put on display in a spectacle
show (misemono), where it proved exceedingly popular.65
A jinmenken rumor may also have circulated among surfers
in the 1950s.66 Famously, a dog with the face of a man
appears in the 1978 American film Invasion of the Body
Snatchers (dir. Philip Kaufman). It is unclear whether the
appearance of the jinmenken in Japan in the late 1980s and
early 1990s was related to any of these previous versions.
More to the point is that the jinmenken fits into a fairly
common yōkai pattern of nonhumans with human faces;
these include the jinmenju (human-faced tree), ningyo
(mermaid), jinmengyo (human-faced fish), and kudan
(human-faced bovine). Such creatures literally embody the
betwixt and between of yōkai—they are neither human nor
animal but a hybrid of both. As such, they are the site of
contact between different worlds and may possess distinct
powers of communication. Indeed, the utterances of such
creatures are often seen as especially meaningful, and
some—like the kudan—are famous as “prophesy beasts” for
their ability to see into the future.67
With this in mind, we may see the jinmenken in a slightly
different light. With the anticlimactic punch line—“Just
leave me alone!”—the narrative is superficially lighthearted
and humorous. But it is also funny distinctly because we
are expecting a more profound and meaningful utterance
an omen of future fortune or catastrophe. The humor pivots



on this unfulfilled expectation and the shock when we
realize that this unique creature not only speaks like a
human but also utters something as mundane and everyday
as the average human.
Taking the analysis one step further, however, perhaps
there is a more profound meaning to the utterance. There
is an undertone of sadness and social commentary
embedded in the joke: “Leave me alone” implies a
weariness with always being stared at or pointed to. At a
time when Japan was struggling with issues of otherness
and changing attitudes toward foreignness, the jinmenken,
as an unusual and anomalous (monstrous?) being, may
have offered a subtle critique of social conformity and
mainstream attitudes toward disability, hybridity, and
difference.

Home
Yōkai may reside in the wilds, in the water, in the country,
and in cities and villages, but we don’t necessarily have to
travel far to find them: they also live in the home. In fact,
these domestic (but undomesticated) creatures may be
some of the most frightening of all yōkai because they
share with us, whether we know it or not, the places we
think of as our own, the places where we feel most secure.
These are intimate yōkai. When we see the signs they leave
—marks on the ceiling, a pillow in the wrong place—they
remind us that we are never actually alone and never
completely in control. The otherworld of yōkai overlays our
own world and can even seep into our dreams—yōkai are
always with us.
YA N A R I
Sounding House, House Sounds, or Poltergeist



Yanari refers to unexplainable sounds within a house, the
kind of phenomenon often called a poltergeist today. In an
old Japanese house, yanari would be heard through the
rattling of fusuma and shoji screens and other mysterious
noises at night.
F I G U R E 2 7 . Yanari and kasa-bake. Original illustrations by
Shinonome Kijin.
The first known reference to yanari appears in Gazu
hyakkiyagyō, where Sekien illustrates them as little
anthropomorphic oni-like figures, scratching and
hammering at the outside beams and foundations of a



wooden house. He provides no explanation or description
with the image, other than the word yanari (literally,
“sounding house”).1 Since the yanari appear in his first
codex, containing mostly well-known traditional yōkai for
which no explanations were necessary, it is possible that
Sekien was simply illustrating a commonly known
poltergeist phenomenon. However, he may have been the
first person to actually affix a concrete visual image—little
demon figures—to this phenomenal yōkai, effectively
transforming an intangible aural occurrence into an
embodied living being.
KASA-BAKE, KASA-OBAKE, OR KARAKASA-BAKE
Umbrella Monster
Although there are no known narratives or folk beliefs
associated specifically with the kasa-bake (also called kasa
obake or karakasa-obake), this umbrella monster has
become a staple of yōkai iconography, appearing in
everything from Edo-period games to contemporary live
action films and anime. The kasa-bake is generally
portrayed as an old-style Japanese umbrella (made of oil
paper on a bamboo frame) with two arms, one eye, a long
tongue and—in place of a handle—a single leg with a
wooden geta sandal. The kasa-bake is a decidedly
lighthearted and loveable image, particularly in film
versions, in which it hops around on its single leg.



A yōkai in the shape of an umbrella appears in an early
Edo-period picture scroll, Hyakkiyagyō-zu, attributed to
Kanō Tōun (1625–1694).2 In his Hyakki tsurezure bukuro
of 1784, Toriyama Sekien also includes a yōkai he calls
hone-karakasa (bone umbrella). Both these images,
however, are quite different from the image that would
become popular in later years. A particularly
representative version of the one-eyed, one-legged, long
tongued kasa-bake is found on an illustrated sugoroku
board game (a popular form of play throughout much of the
Edo period) made by Utagawa Yoshikazu.3 This is the
image that, much later, Mizuki Shigeru developed in his
manga, and it is also the character used, for example, in
the 2005 film The Great Yōkai War.4
Whatever its origins, the kasa-bake is clearly associated
with the concept of tsukumogami, household tools and
objects that become yōkai after a hundred years.
Additionally, the one-eyed, one-legged nature of the kasa
bake suggest that it is cognitively related to many other
yōkai—such as hitotsume-kozō—that have one eye or one
leg, attributes common to deities and monsters of other
cultures as well.
It is also worth noting that, since the Edo period, some
umbrellas were known as ja-no-me-gasa, “snake-eye
umbrellas,” but it is unclear whether there is a direct
relationship between these and the kasa-bake yōkai.
Presumably ja-no-me-gasa were so named because of a
circle of color placed around the circumference of the



canopy near the peak. When the umbrella was opened, the
top appeared like a single eye of a snake.
MOKUMOKUREN
Eyes Everywhere
Late afternoon and you are traveling through the forest.
You come to an old abandoned house, potential shelter for
the evening. You are alone but have an unshakable sense
that somebody, or something, is watching you. Such an
eerie phenomenon, the feeling of being watched, was
translated into an image by Toriyama Sekien in his Konjaku
hyakki shūi of 1781. The yōkai he portrayed is called the
mokumokuren, which might be translated as “eyes-eyes
continuously” or “eyes everywhere.” Sekien’s picture
shows the corner of a seemingly abandoned house,
overgrown with weeds. The shoji screen is ragged and
ripped, but in each section of paper there is a set of eyes.
On closer inspection, the eyes seem to have a quizzical,
almost comical expression. Sekien’s description, too, is
playful: “a house, in which long ago somebody lived, has
many eyes. It must be the house of somebody who played
go.”5 The joke here is that in the game of go, squares on
the board are referred to as “eyes,” and the designated
counter for the playing pieces is also “eyes.”6 So Sekien is
simultaneously creating a potentially frightening image and
making a (somewhat goofy) pun. The mokumokuren,



therefore, is a good example of the way a strange
phenomenon (the sense of being watched) is transformed
into a living creature (a house with eyes), and it is also a
good example of the playfulness of Sekien’s catalogs.
There is no known documentation predating Sekien’s
mokumokuren image, so scholars suspect that he may have
simply created this yōkai.7 As with so many of his
creations, however, this one was later redrawn by Mizuki
Shigeru, who adds a terrified man leaping out of the house.
He also provides a folkloric backstory about a lumber
merchant from Edo who travels up to the Tsugaru region of
northeast Japan to purchase some wood; with nowhere else
to sleep, he spends the night in an abandoned house. When
eyes appear all around him, he is not the least bit
frightened: “on the contrary, he plucked the eyes out one at
a time, put them in a bag, and took them back to Edo,
where he sold them to an eye doctor.”8 Although Mizuki
himself does not mention it, this story had been recorded
earlier by folklorist Yamada Norio, who does not use the
term mokumokuren but titles the brief narrative “Eyes of
the Shoji” (Shōji no me).9
The mokumokuren seems, oddly, to be a particularly
relevant image for today’s global surveillance society. The
notion of eyes embedded within the shoji of a house can
also be thought of as a visualization of the eyes of society
the eyes of all those people around you, watching and
evaluating your behavior. Indeed, there is a Japanese
proverb—Kabe wa mimi ari, shōji wa me ari—that means:



“The walls have ears and the shoji have eyes.” In a sense,
then, the community itself is a kind of yōkai, always
keeping an eye on you—even when you think you are alone.
AKANAME
Scum-Licker
This yōkai appears for the first time in Sekien’s Gazu
hyakkiyagyō, where it is pictured as a small,
anthropomorphic creature, scratching its head and sticking
out its tongue as it creeps suspiciously around the corner of
a bathhouse. Like most of the other entries in this
particular codex, there is absolutely no explanation. We can
infer from its inclusion in a catalog with common yōkai
such as tanuki and tengu that the akaname, too, may have
been well known at the time, although specific legends and
folk beliefs are lost to us now.
The word aka refers to dirt, grime, or sweat and also
describes the coating of scum that accrues to the sides of a
bathtub. Some scholars believe that Sekien’s akaname is
similar to, or based on, the akaneburi discussed in Kokon
hyaku-monogatari hyōban of 1686, in which yōkai and
other mysterious phenomena are explained. There the
akaneburi is described as a creature formed from an
accumulation of dust and grime and living in a bathhouse
or dilapidated house.10



Mizuki Shigeru bases his own illustration on Sekien’s but
shows it actually licking an old wooden bathtub. He also
notes that this yōkai is not known particularly for anything
other than licking the aka off the tub, but that having a
creature like this come into your house at night is certainly
creepy—and a good reason to make sure your bathtub is
clean. In this way, Mizuki suggests, the akaname can be
thought of as a yōkai who provides a lesson about
cleanliness.11
Interestingly, another word pronounced aka, but written
with different kanji, is derived from Sanskrit (arghya) to
indicate sacred water used as an offering to Buddha. It is
tempting to imagine that the akaname might also be a
yōkai who would stealthily lap up water offered during
religious rites. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of a
connection here, but this sort of homonymic wordplay is
just the sort of thing Sekien was famous for.



F I G U R E 2 8 . Akaname and tenjōname. Original illustrations
by Shinonome Kijin.
TENJŌNAME
Ceiling Licker
The tenjōname, literally “ceiling licker,” is a tall, bony
creature with frilly hair and an extraordinarily long tongue.
The first documented reference to this yōkai is Toriyama
Sekien’s Hyakki tsurezure bukuro of 1784, where it is



pictured seemingly suspended in midair, licking a wooden
ceiling.
The title of the catalog itself contains the phrase
tsurezure, and the tenjōname entry appropriately
references the famous essay collection containing this
same phrase, Tsurezure-gusa (Essays in Idleness, 1333), by
the monk Yoshida Kenkō (c. 1283–c. 1350). In entry number
55 of this text, Kenkō writes that “a room with a high
ceiling is cold in winter and dark by lamplight.”12 The
description Sekien includes with his tenjōname plays off
this assertion: “It is said that if the ceiling is high, [the
room] will be dark and in winter it will be cold; but this is
not because of the way the house is made. Rather, it is
entirely due to the machinations of this yōkai [kai]. Just
thinking about it will give you the creeps.”13 In other
words, it is not the architecture that makes it cold and dark
but the tenjōname.
It is possible that this yōkai existed in folklore before
being illustrated by Sekien, but there is no evidence of this,
and many scholars believe he simply fabricated it.14 Many
years later, however, a tenjōname appeared in Mizuki’s
catalogs, illustrated in a remarkably similar fashion. But
Mizuki’s description is very different:
There is a yōkai called “tenjōname.” You would think that it would be a great
help for neatly licking clean the ceiling, which normally does not get cleaned
—but this is not the case. It is fine that this “ceiling licker” licks the ceiling,
but when it licks, it inversely causes dirty stains to adhere. When there is
nobody around in an old house, temple, or shrine, it comes out and licks with
its long tongue. . . . It seems that if they found stains on the ceiling, people in



the old days thought it was the handiwork of the tenjōname.
Mizuki goes on to explain how he first learned about the
creature: “When I was a child,” he writes, “there was an
old woman in the neighborhood who was particularly
knowledgeable about yōkai. On occasion, she used to stay
at our place, and she looked at the stains on the ceiling of
our house and said, ‘Look! The tenjōname comes out at
night and makes those stains.’”15
If Sekien did create the tenjōname, was his invention
later incorporated into oral tradition and village folklore to
become, centuries later, an explanation for stains on the
ceiling? Or was this part simply made up by Mizuki,
effectively transforming an individual artistic creation into
a folk product of collective imagination? In fact there are
several other records of the tenjōname. In a 1929 collection
of yōkai-related material, for example, folklorist Fujisawa
Morihiko noted that “in old houses and old halls, stains on
the ceiling are the result of this yōkai.” And writer and
folklorist Yamada Norio (1922–2012) tells a legend of a
tenjōname captured in the house of a retainer of the
Tatebayashi clan, who brought it to Tatebayashi Castle and
put it to work licking up spider webs. Unfortunately,
however, neither Fujisawa nor Yamada provides any
sources for this material, so the origins remain obscure.16
Whatever the case, the work of Sekien and Mizuki, as well
as of folklorists and other writers, demonstrates the
dynamic and nonlinear relationship between the oral and



literate (and visual), as well as the lively interplay of
tradition and individual creativity in the making of
monsters.
BAKU
Tapir or Dream-Eater
In Japan, the baku is a generally benevolent yōkai endowed
with the power to eat nightmares.
Knowledge of the creature came from China as early as
834 in a poetry collection by the Tang-period poet Bai Juyi
(772–846). There it is described as having the nose of an
elephant, the eyes of a rhinoceros, the tail of an ox, and the
legs of a tiger. The text goes on to explain, “If you lay out
the skin when you sleep, you can avoid epidemics, and by
drawing an image of the baku you can avoid misfortune.
People with chronic headaches can protect their heads by
using a screen with an image of a baku when they go to
sleep.”17 This association with sleep and prevention of bad
fortune took hold in Japan, and by the Edo period the baku
had become a full-fledged devourer of nightmares, a
guardian creature charged with protecting the vulnerable
sleeper as he or she ventured into the otherworld of
dreams. For this purpose, an image of a baku might be
placed near the pillow at night. There were even pillows
made in the shape of baku.18



The Three Realms includes an entry on the baku with a
line drawing and an extended reference to the Chinese
materia medica text Bencao gangmu. The creature is
described as it is here, but with a few more details
attesting to its particular strengths. For example, its teeth
and bones are incredibly strong and its “urine can melt iron
and turn it into water.”19
One theory posits that the baku is based on the tapir, a
real mammal found in South and Central America and
Southeast Asia and also called baku in Japanese (with the
same kanji). The yōkai version most resembles the Malayan
tapir, the only species native to Asia. Although some
scholars argue that the “zoological baku is not related to
the baku of legend,”20 the image of the baku with its long
snout does indeed resemble the animal version.
Regardless of whether the zoological baku influenced the
naming of the yōkai baku or vice versa, descriptions of the
creature exemplify the way in which yōkai are often
constructed as hybrids. The baku is generally described as
a composite of animals—a tiger, elephant, rhinoceros, and
ox. It is a chimera, a zoological collage. This explanation by
analogy (tail like an ox, legs like a tiger) is a common way
of describing yōkai and, by extension, part of the process of
their construction. In a sense, then, a yōkai such as the
baku fits somewhere between the real and imaginary; all its
parts are derived from real animals, but their combination
is imaginary.



F I G U R E 2 9 . Baku and makura-gaeshi. Original illustrations
by Shinonome Kijin.
But the baku in particular complicates this even further.
To people living in Japan during the Edo period or earlier,
the very parts from which the creature was constructed
were as strange and foreign as their unnatural
combination. Elephants, rhinoceroses, and tigers were not
native to Japan; the average Japanese person during this
time would have seen one only in illustrations and books (if
at all), the same places that might also have images of a
baku. That is, a baku was presumably no more mysterious,
and also no less real, than a rhinoceros.



MAKURA-GAESHI
Pillow Shifter
You wake up in the morning to discover that your pillow
has been mysteriously flipped over or moved from your
head to your feet or to some other place in the room. Or
perhaps you find your entire futon was moved to a different
position after you went to sleep. This is the handiwork of a
pillow-shifting yōkai called the makura-gaeshi.
An early image of the makura-gaeshi appears without
commentary in Sekien’s earliest catalog, so we can assume
that it was fairly well known during the mid-Edo period.
Sekien’s picture shows a samurai waking up, with a
confused look on his face, to find his pillow at his feet.
Hovering faintly in the background above him is a demonic
little creature (similar in appearance to traditional images
of the thunder god Raijin or even to Sekien’s own yanari
from the same catalog), presumably the culprit who shifted
his pillow. The figure is drawn hazily, as if it might be an
image lingering from the samurai’s dream.
Murakami Kenji points out that despite Sekien’s
illustration, few concrete examples of this yōkai dating
from the Edo period can be found; however, examples are
abundant in more recent local folklore, where the makura
gaeshi is often described as a childlike figure and, in some
regions, called a makura-kozō (pillow urchin). Sometimes
the shifting of pillows is also blamed on house spirits, such
as zashiki-warashi.



Murakami also points out that the position of one’s pillow
has been a matter of concern since at least the late Heian
period; it was considered important to shift the direction of
a corpse so that the head, and the pillow, faced north.21
This notion of the kita-makura, or “north-pillow,” is
commonly connected with the fact that the historical
Buddha is said to have died lying down with his head to the
north—so north came to be the direction associated with
the sleep of death. Even today, common custom in Japan
dictates that you avoid sleeping with your head to the
north, because by the mechanism of sympathetic magic,
this would mean your sleeping position replicates the
position of death, which you would therefore be tempting.
Although the north-pillow concept is rarely mentioned in
conjunction with the makura-gaeshi, occasionally the
relationship between the two is explicit. A story collected in
Kōchi, for example, tells of somebody waking up to find
that while he slept, his position was turned around entirely
so that his head and pillow were to the north.22 In other
instances, the makura-gaeshi just seems to be having fun,
with no malicious intent or effect.
The connection between sleeping and death, and
between consciousness and the loss of self that comes with
sleep, is no coincidence. As Miyata Noboru suggests, a
pillow is a kind of threshold device through which a person
can cross into another world. As the mind starts to dream,
the spirit and the physical body seem to separate. Before
the modern period, many pillows in Japan were hard and



boxlike; sometimes incense was placed inside or
underneath them with the idea that the fragrance would
lull the sleeper into dreams. In other words, the pillow was
a sort of magical device through which a person could
travel to another world. Pillows should, therefore, be
treated with respect, and it was considered taboo to kick or
throw one around. In this context, we can understand why
it might have been frightening to wake up and find your
pillow moved from one place to another or flipped over, as
if somebody or something had shifted around the entire
world.23
The experience of sleeping, and dreaming, is also
connected with the idea that the spirit leaves the physical
body in which it resides most of the time. By altering the
position of your pillow while you are asleep, the makura
gaeshi makes it possible that your spirit may be unable to
return home to the body. A similar idea can be found in the
case of the rokurokubi.
ZASHIKI-WARASHI
House Spirit or House Familiar
Zashiki-warashi are most commonly associated with the
Tohoku region in northeast Japan, particularly Iwate
Prefecture. Translated literally, the name means “parlor
child” or “little boy of the house”; and accordingly, zashiki
warashi reside inside the house. They usually resemble a



boy between three and thirteen years of age, but there are
also examples of female zashiki-warashi. There are
numerous variant and regional names for this yōkai, such
as zashiki-bokko, heya-bokko, kura-warashi, and kome
tsuki-warashi.24
Not all houses have a zashiki-warashi, but it is said that
if one takes up residence the family will prosper. If it
departs, however, household fortunes will decline. Zashiki
warashi generally refrain from showing themselves directly
to the family, but rather, they perform mischief in all sorts
of subtle ways: flipping pillows over while people are
sleeping, yanking on the bedcovers, making noises
throughout the house. If the resident zashiki-warashi
suddenly does appear, this may be considered a sign of his
impending departure and an omen that the house will fall
on hard times.
A zashiki-warashi recorded in Aomori Prefecture was
said to look like a little girl wearing a red chanchanko
(sleeveless kimono vest) and to shift the pillows of visitors.
She was considered a “protective spirit” (mamorigami) of
the household.25 In his famous collection from Tōno (in
Iwate Prefecture), Yanagita Kunio recorded several zashiki
warashi tales:
The mother of Kizen Sasaki was sewing alone one day when she heard the
sound of paper rustling in the next room. That room was only for the master
of the house, but he was in Tokyo. Thinking it strange, she opened the door
and looked in, but no one was there. Having sat down for a short while, she
now heard the sound of someone sniffing in the next room. She concluded
that it must be Zashikiwarashi. It has been rumored for sometime [sic] that



Zashikiwarashi resided in this house. A house that this kami (spirit) lives in is
said to become rich and prestigious.26
In some cases zashiki-warashi may be related to the
practice of mabiki, or infanticide, which was carried out for
population control in parts of rural Japan through at least
the eighteenth century. A newborn baby was not
necessarily considered a full-fledged human, so the dead
infant might not be memorialized in the traditional fashion.
Instead, for example, the body might be interred within the
house itself, where it came to be thought of as a protective
spirit.27 Although this interpretation of the zashiki-warashi
is speculative, it is clear that by having one less mouth to
feed, the household in question would be a little more
prosperous than otherwise—exactly the effect a resident
zashiki-warashi is said to bring.
Although zashiki-warashi are most commonly associated
with the Tohoku region, similar yōkai or protective house
spirits are found elsewhere, such as the ainukaisei in
Hokkaido and the akagantā in Okinawa.
TSUKUMOGAMI
Object Monsters or Utensil Yōkai
Tsukumogami is a general term referring to all sorts of
household utensils, musical instruments, and other human
made objects that have become yōkai. The Tsukumogami
ki, a Muromachi-period otogizōshi tale, explains that “when



an object reaches one hundred years, it transforms,
obtaining a spirit [seirei] and deceiving people’s hearts;
this is called tsukumogami.”28
A related set of sixteenth-century picture scrolls owned
by a temple in Gifu Prefecture warns,
There are tools and other objects that change into spirits after a span of one
hundred years and often deceive people. These spirits are called
tsukumogami. . . . At year’s end families discard old furniture and utensils
and pile them up at the side of the road. Then at New Year’s—when it is time
to renew the hearth fire and draw new water—the clothing, household
utensils, and other objects transform in shape. They become angry at the
extravagance of wealthy families. These tsukumogami should be treated with
caution.29
The scrolls offer a story of Buddhist salvation, following a
troop of discarded tools on their journey to seek revenge
against human beings. Eventually the transformed objects
are converted to the way of the Buddha and themselves
finally attain Buddhahood.30
Since the Muromachi period, if not earlier, there seems
to have been a belief that objects not treated with respect,
or objects disposed of improperly, might become animated
and seek revenge against the humans who mistreated
them. As with many yōkai-related beliefs, the number one
hundred seems to be instrumental in this transformation.
The word tsukumogami itself may derive from complex
wordplay associated with the number: tsukumogami is read
the same as tsukumo-gami 九十九髪, in which case the kanji
for tsukumo 九 十 九 indicates the number ninety-nine, and



gami (kami 髪 ) denotes hair. The phrase then could be
translated as “ninety-nine[-year-old] hair” and would refer
to the white hair of an old woman and, by extension, to old
age more generally. (The number ninety-nine is, of course,
one short of one hundred; the character for white 白 is
similarly one stroke short of the character for one hundred
百 , hence connecting it to whiteness.) Kami, meaning
“hair,” is also a homonym for kami meaning deity.31 The
numbers here are not necessarily meant to be exact; both
ninety-nine and one hundred may simply indicate that a
very long time has passed, the assumption being that when
any normal thing exists for long enough it can transform
into something not so normal. An old tanuki might develop
nasty magical powers, an old cat might turn into a
bakeneko, an old human might become an oni, and even old
objects can morph into yōkai.
This process of animation may reflect an animistic
worldview, in which everything, including nonliving objects,
potentially possess spirits. The transformation of things
into yōkai articulates the essence of what it means to be a
bakemono—a thing that changes. As Komatsu points out,
one of the many interesting aspects of the tsukumogami
scrolls noted earlier is that the ultimate objective of
transformation is for each object to turn into a full-fledged
oni. The scrolls illustrate the process of this transformation
—they depict objects developing facial features and
growing arms and legs.32



If becoming an oni is the goal of the transformation,
however, then tsukumogami—at least in this example—are
stuck in the middle, no longer objects, but not yet oni
either. They are adolescent monsters, as it were, caught
midtransformation. The fact that tsukumo is associated
with the number ninety-nine also adds to the implication
that these objects have almost—but not quite—completed
their metamorphosis.
Just as the animate nature of all things suggests an
animistic understanding of the world, so too the potential
to transform reflects a Buddhist perspective in which there
is always the possibility, in theory, of transformation into a
Buddha.33 In the case of tsukumogami, whether the object
becomes a benevolent kami or a maleficent yōkai depends
on how humans treat it: whether they respect it or,
inversely, chuck it away as garbage. Even today in Japan,
memorial services (kuyō) are performed for certain objects,
particularly household goods such as brooms, brushes,
needles, dolls, and eyeglasses that have dedicated their
“lives” to helping humans. To an extent this attitude
reflects a kind of ecological sensibility, perhaps born of
necessity, in which nothing should be taken for granted. It
also may reflect an economic, practical perspective, in
which increased consumption of goods was facilitated by
ritualistically handling “the disposal of used, exhausted
objects.”34
On a popular-culture level, certainly the idea of animate
inanimate objects provides an entertaining and comical



subject and the potential for social commentary. The most
famous early images of tsukumogami appear in the playful
Muromachi-period Hyakkiyagyō emaki, but the idea has
been reinvented over and over into the modern period. One
early-twentieth-century version, for example, lightheartedly
reflects a particular anxiety of the time: a procession of
tsukumogami candles, lanterns, and torches runs in
frenzied terror from a new, and frighteningly powerful,
object-yōkai in the shape of an electric lightbulb.35 It is all
too easy to imagine an early-twenty-first-century version,
full of discarded computers and cell phones, wide-eyed and
animated, haunting our every step.

Epilogue
MONSTERFUL
Monsterful is an archaic word defined by the Oxford
English Dictionary online as meaning “rare, marvelous, and
extraordinary.” Even though the word may be all but
forgotten today, it seems an appropriate adjective to apply
to the yōkai pantheon. In part this is because yōkai are akin
to monsters in the modern sense—strange, anomalous
manifestations of otherness. But most important,
monsterful is associated with the marvelous and rare. It
describes a sense of wonder—indeed, our contemporary
equivalent might simply be wonderful. Wonders, of course,
are things that transcend easy categorization and
understanding, things beyond our powers of
comprehension. Wonder is also a verb—expressing not only
the intellectual act of contemplation but also an emotional,
spiritual, affective sense of awe. And if wonderful and
monsterful are synonymous, then in a sense, monster must
also be a kind of feeling.
But what good is this monsterful world of yōkai in a real
world racked by wars, ethnic tension, religious strife,



economic crisis, and potentially catastrophic climate
change? In Japan, the 2011 cataclysm of earthquake,
tsunami, and ongoing nuclear emergency reminds us not
just that the natural environment is beyond the control of
humans but also, more devastatingly, that we humans have
created monsters over which we have no control. The study
of yōkai will not, of course, solve any of these problems.
But because yōkai emerge from the process of thinking
through the unknown, they can perhaps offer a small
metaphor for considering these immense challenges. As I
have argued implicitly throughout this book, yōkai are born
from the dual acts of reading and writing the world around
us; they develop from symbiotic processes of interpretation
and creation.
If the monsterful is about wonder and the possibility of
the inconceivable, it reminds us that there are otherworlds
out there—sounds we have never heard, wavelengths of
light human eyes cannot see, entire structures of thought
yet to be imagined. As the human world contends with
seemingly insurmountable twenty-first-century challenges,
the otherworld of yōkai may provide an escapist dream of
fantasy and lighthearted play. But more significantly, with
its variety and abundance and endless change, it can also
offer a metaphor for imagining the unknown, and for the
possibility of transforming amorphous hopes into solid
futures. Whether these futures turn out to be monstrous or
monsterful, however, is the responsibility not of the yōkai
but of the humans who do the transforming.

Thought and Literature (Montreal: McGill-Queen’s Press, 1999); David D.

2. Thoms suggested the word as a substitute for “Popular Antiquities, or
Popular Literature.” See “Folk-Lore,” Anthanaeum (August 22, 1846).
Reprinted in Journal of Folklore Research 33, no. 3 (September–December
1996): 187–189.
3. See the discussion of the “twin laws” in Barre Toelken, The Dynamics of
Folklore (Logan: Utah State University Press, 1996), 39–52.
4. Sometimes lack of “ownership” is the very thing that makes folklore the
subject of disputes about intellectual property law and indigenous rights. See,
for example, Michael F. Brown, Who Owns Native Culture? (Cambridge, MA:
Harvard University Press, 2003).

Obakemono Project, which seems to use the word obakemono as a creative
mash-up of obake and bakemono. This is not a Japanese word per se, but it
seems to have become a kind of regional (English-language) variant word for
yōkai.

Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697 (1896; reprint, Tokyo:

Elizabeth Oyler, Swords, Oaths, and Prophetic Visions: Authoring Warrior Rule
in Medieval Japan (Honolulu: University of Hawai‘i Press, 2006), especially
115–137.
Interestingly, a careful reading of the Yamata no Orochi passage, with its
multiple repetitions of the number eight, suggests that the creature actually
drinks sixty-four barrels of wine! (I thank Bonita Hurd for bringing this to my
attention.) It is probable, however, that the number eight is invoked here not as



an exact amount but as a signifier of abundance and because of its great
symbolic value as a sacred and propitious number in both Japanese and
Chinese cultures. For a discussion of the importance of the number eight in
Japanese tradition, see Gunji Masakatsu, Wasūkō (Hakusuisha, 2001), 125–142.

“the Way of yin-yang” as the most accurate English translations of Onmyōdō.

10. Komatsu, in Komatsu et al., Nihon ikai emaki, 55–56. There are many
versions of this legend; it seems to have been around since at least the
medieval period but became popular during the Edo period (Shigeta, Abe no
Seimei, 9–10). The fox is called Kuzunoha, and numerous legends and dramas
have developed around her. Setting aside the question of whether Seimei’s
mother was a fox, even his paternity is disputed, with some evidence that his
father was not Yasuna but Abe no Masuki. Okano Reiko, Yumemakura Baku,
Komatsu Kazuhiko, and Togashi Rintarō, Onmyōdō (Tokuma shoten, 2000), 46
47. For more on Kuzunoha, Seimei, and Edo-period plays concerning them, see
Janet E. Goff, “Conjuring Kuzunoha from the World of Abe no Seimei,” in A



Kabuki Reader: History and Performance, ed. Samuel L. Leiter (Armonk, NY:

Nihon misuteriasu yōkai, kaiki, yōjin jiten (Bensei shuppan, 2012), 207.
12. This story is found in a text from the 1580s; see Shimura Kunihiro,
Onmyōji Abe no Seimei (Kadokawa gakugei shuppan, 1995), 56–57. A version of
the episode is recounted on a panel at the Seimei Shrine in Kyoto.
13. Though sometimes attributed to the Noh master Zeami Motokiyo (1363
1443), authorship of this drama is uncertain. For an English translation, see
Eileen Kato, The Iron Crown (Kanawa), in Twenty Plays of the Nō Theatre, ed.
Donald Keene (New York: Columbia University Press, 1970), 193–205.

and popular culture, see Carolyn Pang, “Uncovering Shikigami: The Search for
the Spirit Servant of Onmyōdō,” Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 40, no. 1
(2013): 99–129.
17. Miller, “Extreme Makeover,” 31. The Seimei obsession may have been
inspired by, in addition to Yumemakura’s contribution, Aramata Hiroshi’s mid
1980s novel, Teito monogatari, which features a twentieth-century descendant
of Seimei and introduced Onmyōdō concepts. See Tanaka Takako, Abe no
Seimei no issen nen: Seimei genshō o yomu (Kōdansha, 2003), 14–22; Shigeta,
Abe no Seimei, 2–3; Kyōgoku Natsuhiko, Taidanshū: Yōkai daidangi (Kadokawa
shoten, 2005), 70–71. But while these fictional versions of Onmyōdō and Seimei
certainly fueled popular interest, the authors and illustrators of these texts
were surely influenced by academic research; in 1985, for example, Komatsu
Kazuhiko and Naitō Masatoshi discussed Onmyōdō and Seimei in a popular
nonfiction book. See Oni ga tsukutta kuni Nihon: Rekishi o ugokashite kita
“yami” no chikara to wa (Kōbunsha, 1985), 99–133.
18. There seems to be a battle over who “owns” Seimei; a sign at the shrine
strictly warns that the items for sale at the shop next door are not officially
endorsed.

Yanagita Kunio and Japanese Folklore Studies in the 21st Century, ed. Ronald
A. Morse (Tokyo: Japanime, 2012), 20–35. Yanagita’s early essays on yōkai are
in Santō mintan shū of 1914 (Teihon Yanagita Kunio shū [Chikuma shobō,
1970], 27:41–179); Hitotsume kozō sono ta (in Teihon, 5:113–340). See also
“Tanuki to demonorojii,” of 1918 (in Teihon 22:467–473), and “Yūrei shisō no
hensen,” of 1917 (in Teihon 15:562–568). Yōkai dangi (Discussions of
monsters), a collection of some thirty essays originally published between 1910
and 1939, was released as a collection in 1956; for a newly annotated
paperback version, see Yanagita Kunio, Shintei yōkai dangi (Kadokawa gakukei
shuppan, 2013).

reprinted in Teihon, 4:424–438, and Yanagita, Shintei yōkai dangi, 243–301.
60. Yanagita, “Yōkai dangi,” in Teihon, 4:292–293. See Komatsu, Yōkaigaku
shinkō, 16–17, for examples of how scholars have refined Yanagita’s ideas.
61. Yanagita, “Hitotsume-kozō,” in Teihon, 5:125. “Hitotsume-kozō” was first
published in August 1917 in the Tokyo nichi nichi shinbun (newspaper) and
reprinted in 1934 with a number of other essays by Yanagita in a separate
volume titled Hitotsume-kozō sono ta.
62. For explanation of this attitude in Yanagita’s minzokugaku, see Alan
Christy, A Discipline on Foot: Inventing Japanese Native Ethnography, 1910
1945 (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2012), especially 205–208.

of pictures used by a performer to tell a story to an audience, usually of
children aged four to twelve”; Sharalyn Orbaugh, “Kamishibai and the Art of



the Interval,” Mechademia 7 (2012), 78. For more on kamishibai and manga,

Kitarō’s father, who has disintegrated through disease. The eyeball remains to
watch over Kitarō as he grows up. See Mizuki Shigeru, Chūkō aizōban Gegege

3. YŌKAI PRACTICE/YŌKAI THEORY
1. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and
Schizophrenia, trans. Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota
Press, 1987), 7. The ramifications of thinking of culture in terms of rhizomes
are more complex than my use of the term here, but I invoke it to emphasize a
web of relations built around yōkai in terms of interconnectedness and mutual
influence. This also allows us to transcend questions of “origins” or
“authenticity” that can obstruct interpretation of the multifacetedness of yōkai
culture.

21. Beans have long been valued both for nutrition and for ritual power.
Throwing beans to ward off oni during Setsubun has probably been practiced
since at least the Muromachi period; some scholars posit that rather than (or in
addition to) their role in banishing evil, beans were presented as offerings to
the gods. Sasaki Kōkan, Miyata Noboru, and Yamaori Tetsuo, eds., Nihon
minzoku shūkyō jiten (Tōkyōdō, 1998), 318. This double function—both weapon
and offering—is evident at setsubun as beans are thrown to ward off oni even
as they invite in good fortune. When the ritual is performed at a temple or
shrine, the beans are often thrown not at the oni but to the visitors, who reach
out excitedly to grab them.

canids, in the same family as dogs, Linnaean classification Nyctereutes
procyonoides. Three subspecies have been identified: Nyctereutes
procyonoides procyonoides and N. p. ussuriensis in continental Asia, and N. p.
viverrinus in Japan. See Kaarina Kauhala, “The Raccoon Dog: A Successful

40. The relationship between mujina and tanuki is often confusing. In
contemporary biological terms, mujina generally refers to an anaguma, or
Japanese badger, native to parts of Japan. In some regions, however, tanuki
were also called mujina, and the two are often conflated in folklore. See
