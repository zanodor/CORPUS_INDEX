Simplicity of a Binary Model | Binary Research Institute
In both models the point of equinox occurs where the celestial
equator (grey disk) intersects the ecliptic (gold disk), which of
course occurs twice a year – the first day of Spring and the first day
of Autumn. And in both models the equinox moves at the same rate
relative to the black background and fixed text (which represents the
fixed stars).
The difference in the models is that the conventional model moves
the point of equinox by requiring the celestial equator to slip along
the ecliptic (a wobbling earth scenario as propounded by lunisolar
theory), whereas in the binary model the ecliptic and celestial
equator remain fixed (meaning the equinox occurs at the same point
every year in the earthʼs orbit path around the sun) moving against
the background stars simply because the solar system moves.
The only way to easily tell the difference between the two models is
by noting the position of an observer (the red X) relative to the
equinox, ecliptic and celestial equator. In the conventional model the
solar system is static and therefore the observer is stuck in one
position (relative to the fixed stars), so the only way the equinox can
move relative to the fixed stars is if the point at which the celestial
equator intersects the ecliptic is constantly in local motion. In the
binary model the observer remains fixed in relation to local markers
and the equinox moves because the solar system moves.
The simplest observable of the precession of the equinox is that at
the time of the annual equinox we observe that the sun has moved
west about 50” from the position it was in the year before – relative
to the background stars. Under conventional theory this motion is



considered “apparent” with astronomers believing the sun did not
actually move – it just “appeared” to move because the earth
wobbled by 50”.
But in the new model things are much simpler. The sun moves
across the sky at 50” p/y because this is how much the solar system
moves per year (its angular velocity). The “precession of the
equinox” then is not an “apparent” motion of the sun – it is a real
motion of the sun. The solar system moves!
The above graphic shows that the precession observable (seen here
as the delta of the tropical and sidereal “year” in the lower graph) is
nearly identical to the observable we find between a sidereal and
tropical “day” (in the upper graph). It is a well known fact that the
daily time difference of 4 minutes between a tropical day and a solar
day is simply the result of the earth curving through space at the
rate of almost one degree per day, as it orbits the sun. Likewise the
annual time difference between a tropical and sidereal “year” can be
modeled via identical orbital mechanics, albeit on a larger scale. In



other words, the 20 minute difference between a tropical year and a
sidereal year is simply the result of the solar system curving through
space at the rate of about 50” p/y, no wobble required. The big
question of course is, “What does the solar system orbit”?
