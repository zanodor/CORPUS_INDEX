The Reindeer Goddess by Judith Shaw
By Judith Shaw December 18, 2016
Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere is the day of the least
daylight and the longest night. Long before Christmas our Northern
European ancestors celebrated the Winter Solstice, the moment that
heralds the return of the sun and with it the promise of new life in
spring. Without the comforts offered by modern technology, this
time of year must have raised fears in the hearts of our ancestors;
fear that the sun would not return to its summer glory, fear that there
would not be enough food for the winter, fears that surface most
easily in the dark. A celebration of light would have been most
welcome and needed.
The longest night was called “Mother Night” as it was during this
time that the Goddess worked her magic to nurture the seeds laying
dormant in the dark womb of earth so that new life could emerge in
spring. It is a time to celebrate the eternal cycle of life, death and
rebirth.
Many of the elements associated with Christmas have their origins in
our Goddess worshipping past: evergreen trees, holly, mistletoe, the
wreath, lighting candles, and yes even our favorite Santa Claus and
his reindeer who both have their origins in Northern European Sun



Goddesses.
Saule, the Lithuanian and Latvian goddess of light and the sun, took
to the skies on the Winter Solstice in a sleigh pulled by horned
reindeer. She journeyed with the aide of Her smith, who forged a
golden cup in which to catch Her tears which then transformed into
amber. During Her flight through the heavens she threw these
pebbles of amber, like little bits of sun, and apples down to the world
of humans below. She was a spinning Goddess who used her skill to
spin the rays of sunlight onto the world.

Saule ruled all parts of life, determining life, death and the well-being
and regeneration of all. She was the sun, riding every day in Her
chariot across the sky. She also welcomed the souls of the recently



departed into Her apple tree in the west.

Beiwe was a Sun Goddess of the Sami or Lapps, the indigenous
people of the Nordic countries. The Sami were reindeer herders who
relied on the reindeer for their survival. Beiwe, Sun Goddess,
nourished them and their herds and helped Her people maintain
mental health during the difficult months of darkness. She flew
through the heavens with her daughter, Beaivi-nieida (sun maiden) in
a ring of reindeer antlers flinging fertility and life back onto the land.
On Winter Solstice Her people smeared offerings of warm butter on
doorposts to help Her gain strength for her flight high into the sky.
Beiwe, like Saule was associated with spinning. Spinning wheels and
flax were left as offerings on Her altars.
The Norse goddess, Frigga (Freya) was also a spinning goddess. She
sat at her spinning wheel during the Winter Solstice weaving the
fates of the year to come. This celebration was called Yule, from the
Norse word for wheel. Christmas is often called Yule or Yuletide. The
Christmas wreath was adapted from Friggaʼs “Wheel of Fate,”
symbolizing the cyclical nature of life.



Rozhanitza, Slavic Winter Goddess is also associated with reindeer
and the Winter Solstice. She is
depicted as a horned Goddess with reindeer antlers. Folk art of red
and white embroideries were made of Her for solstice celebrations.
On Her feast day, December 26, cookies made in the shape of deer
were given and eaten for good luck.
Reindeer are the only members of the deer family whose females
have horns and are stronger and larger than the males. The males
shed their antlers in winter, leaving it to the Deer Mother to fly
through the long, dark night of Winter Solstice. The Reindeer was a
sacred animal to our ancient ancestors of Northern Europe. The doe
was seen as the giver of light and life. Their horns were associated
with the tree of life and often times they were depicted carrying the
sun, the giver of life, in their horns.

Esther Jacobson in her book, The Deer Goddess of Ancient Siberia,
concludes that the deer images found throughout the early nomadic
and semi nomadic cultures of the vast steppe and mountainous
regions of Eastern Europe and Asia are evidence of a Deer Mother as
the source of life and death. Monolithic “Deer Stones” are found
through out this region, carved with stylized depictions of reindeer
as if in flight.
Horned Goddesses are found in the Celtic world also. Elen of the
Ways, in Her most ancient form was the Guardian of the Leys, the
ancient track ways. In Her guise as the Horned Goddess, She led the
way on the migratory tracks of the reindeer.
With time the reindeer became the deer in many Celtic myths. Elen
of the Ways also opened the pathways for the red deer in the forests
of Northern Europe. Flidais was associated with the deer who she
milked to provide sustenance for Her people. As more time passed
the deer became the cow. From Brigid to Boann, many Celtic
goddesses are associated with a sacred cow.
We can learn from the wisdom of the past, a time when humans
understood more clearly our tiny part in the cosmic web of life. and
the necessity of honoring the earth and all its life. At this time when
the shadow side of human nature once again seeks dominance
through naked self-interest and the promotion of fear and hatred of
others, let us remember and honor the Ancientʼs belief in the
Reindeer Goddess, the Sun Goddess and the Motherʼs Night when
She both flies high in the sky and dives deep into the earth to
nourish and promise a renewal of life in the coming spring. Though it
may be dark now, the light will return.

Postscript – While I was working on this article, news broke about the
death of thousands of reindeer due to the warming of Siberia. Read a
report on that situation on Huffington Post.

San Francisco Art Institute, has
been interested in myth,
culture and mystical studies all her life. Not long after graduating
from SFAI, while living in Greece, Judith began exploring the
Goddess in her artwork. She continues to be inspired by the
Goddess in all of Her manifestations. Originally from New Orleans,
Judith now makes her home in New Mexico where she paints and
sells real estate part-time. Give yourself the gift of one of Judithʼs
