# Index for Dhanu (month) – Wikipedia.pdf

Dhanu, Dhanus or Dhanurmas (धनुमार्स) is a month in the Hindu calendar, Malayalam
calendar and others.[1][2] It corresponds to the zodiacal sign of Sagittarius, and overlaps with
approximately the second half of December and about the first half of January in the
Gregorian calendar.[1]
In Vedic texts, the Dhanus month is called Sahas (IAST: Sahas), but in these ancient texts it
has no zodiacal associations.[3] The solar month of Dhanu overlaps with its lunar month
Pausha, in Hindu lunisolar calendars.[4][5] The Dhanu marks the winter season for the Indian
subcontinent. It is preceded by the solar month of Vṛścika, and followed by the solar month
of Makara.[2]
The Dhanus month is called Margali in the Tamil Hindu calendar.[1] The ancient and medieval
era Sanskrit texts of India vary in their calculations about the duration of Dhanus, just like
they do with other months. For example, the Surya Siddhanta calculates the duration of
Vrschika to be 29 days, 7 hours, 37 minutes and 36 seconds.[5] In contrast, the Arya
Siddhanta calculates the duration of the Vrschika month to be 29 days, 8 hours, 24 minutes
and 48 seconds.[5]
Dhanurmas or Dhanur Masa is also known by the names Chapa Mas, Kodanda Mas,
Karmuka Mas etc. Chapa, Kodanda, Karmuka etc., in Sanskrit are synonyms of Dhanus;
meaning a bow. It is the month of margashira and so also called Margazhi masam in Tamil.
Sri krishna in bagavatam says 'Maasanam Margashirshoham' ... meaning 'I am the
margashira in the months'. Dhanurmasa is also called as Shoonya Masa because it is
generally advised not to conduct any good things other than godly and holy functions.
Dhanu is also an astrological sign in Indian horoscope systems, corresponding to Sagittarius
(astrology).[6]
This period of month is considered as highly auspicious for Vishnu devotees. Old Hindu
scriptures have set apart this month to be completely focused on devotional activities. Other
non-devotional activities (such as weddings, purchase of property etc.) are prohibited during

Etymology and significance



this month so that attention can be given exclusively to the worship of God without any
diversions. In South India, especially the Vaikunta Ekadasi, which falls during Dhanur Mas,
attracts thousands of devotees. Temples conduct special pujas during this period.
Sri Krishna in Bhagavad Gita, says मासानां मागर्शीषोर्हम् 10.35. I manifest more in Margashirsha
Maas among the different months in a year.
According to tradition, the Gods wake up early in the morning during the month of
Dhanurmas. They perform special prayers to Sri Maha Vishnu during the auspicious period
of "Brahm Muhurta", which is one and half hours before sunrise. During this month,
devotees offer prayers to the Lord very early in the morning. The month of Dhanurmas is
considered a very special month for performing Puja of Vishnu.
Dhanurmas Phal Shruti: Worshiping Vishnu on a single day during this auspicious period is
equal to worshiping Vishnu with devotion for 1000 years. Every single step taken towards the
nearby lake, river etc. for morning dip during this month brings forth merit equal to
performing an Ashvamedha Yaga.
During this period the sun is in the Sagittarius or "धनु रािश",[7] the period when the sun passes
from Sagittarius to Capricorn or "मकर रािश" is considered as a period of scarcity to the plenty
in India.[8] Feeding or giving alms to the deserving poor and Brahmins during this period is
believed to confer great merit i.e. Punya.[9]
