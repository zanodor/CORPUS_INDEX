" Wilt thou lere of sterres aught ?

INTRODUCTION.
This list of star-names is published in the endeavor to fill an acknowledged vacancy in our popular astronomical literature. It is not intended for the professional astronomer, who, as a rule, cares little about the old designations of the objects of his study,- alphabets, numerals, and circles being preferable, indeed needful, for his purposes of identification. Yet great scholars have thought this nomenclature not unworthy their attention, - Grotius, Scaliger, Hyde, and our own Whitney, among others, devoting much of their rare talent to its elucidation; while Ideler, of a century ago, not without authority in astronomy as in other branches of learning, wrote as to inquiry into star-names:
This is, in its very nature, coincidently a research into the constellations, and it is so much more worth while learning their history as throughout all ages the spirit of man bas concerned itself with a subject that has ever had the highest interest to him,- the starry heavens.
Old Thomas Hood, of Trinity College, Cambridge, in I 590 asserted that they were "for instruction's sake . . . things cannot be taught without names"; and it is certain that knowledge of these contributes much to an intelligent pleasure when we survey the evening sky. For almost all can repeat Thomas Carlyle's lament :
Why did not somebody teach me the constellations, and make me at home in the starry heavens, which are always overhead, and which I don't half know to this day? xi

Xll Introduction
Naturally these titles are chiefly from the Arabs, whose Desert life and clear skies made them very familiar with the stars, as Al Biruni 1 wrote :
He whose roof is heaven, who has no other cover, over whom the stars continually rise and set in one and the same course, makes the beginnings of his affairs and his knowledge of time depend upon them.
So that the shaykh Ilderim well told Ben Hur at the Orchard of Palms :
Thou canst not know how much we Arabs depend upon the stars. We borrow their names in gratitude, and give them in love.
But many star-names supposed to have originated in Arabia are merely that country's translations of the Greek descriptive terms, adopted, during the rule of the Abbasids,2 from Claudius Ptolemy's 'H Mrydl71 l:vvra;ir rijr 'Aarpovoμlar, the Great Sys~em of Astronomy, of our second century. For it was early in this khalifate,
in the golden prime Of good Haroun Alraschid
(Aaron the Just), that Ptolemy's l:vvraftf 3 was translated as Al Kitab al Mifisti, the Greatest Book. This, in its various editions, substituted among the educated classes a new nomenclature; while, as revised by Al Thabit ibn ~urrah in the lat~er part of the 9th c~ntury, it eventually became, through a Latin version by Cremonaeus (Gerard of Cremona) of the 12th century, the groundwork of the first cpmplete printed Almagest. This, published at Venice in 1515, so manifestl~ showed its composite origin that Ideler and Smyth always referred to it as the Arabo-Lali11 Almagest. The Greek text of the Syn/axis seems to have been practically unknown in Europe until translated into Latin from a Vatican manuscript by Trapezuntius (the monk George of Trebizond), several editions
1 This was the celebrated Khorasmian Abii Rail}iin Mul}ammad ibn Al}mad of A. D. 1000, whose designation in literature came from his birthplace, a /Jiriin, or suburb, of Khwiirizm. His v~stigrs of Past G~mtions, a chronology of ancient nations, and his India, are of interest and authority even now. 2 This first organized government among the Arabs began in 749, and under "its enlightened and munificent protection Baghdad soon became what Alexandria had long ceased to be.·· 3This was subsequently designated as 'H M,yforq to distinguish it from his smaller astrological work in four books, the Tueaf11(1fo~ Xv1'1'a;1c. Our word A/,,,a,r~sl is now supposed to be composed of the principal letters of the Greek title.



Introduction Xlll
of this issuing during the 16th century. From all these and kindred works have come the barbarous Graeco-Latin-Arabic words that, in a varied orthography, appear as star-names in modem lists. But there were other purely indigenous, and so very ancient, titles from the heathen days of the Ishmaelites anterior to Mediterranean influences, perhaps even from the prehistoric "'Arab al BaidA," the Arabs of the Desert,- these titles generally pastoral in their character, as accords with such an origin. So that we find among them the nomads' words for shepherds and herdsmen with their maidens; horses, horsemen, and their trappings; cattle, camels, sheep, and goats; predatory and other animals; birds and reptiles. It should be remembered, however, that the archaic nomenclature of the Arabs - archaic properly so called, for we know nothing of its beginnings - in one respect is unique. They did not group together several stars to form a living figure, as did their Western neighbors, who subsequently became their teachers; single stars represented single creatures,a rule that seems rarely to have been deviated from,- although the case was different in their stellar counterparts of inanimate objects. Even here they used but few stars for their geographical, anatqmical, and botanical terms; their tents, nests, household articles, and ornaments; mangers and stalls; boats, biers, crosses, and thrones ; wells, ponds, and ri~·ers; fruits, grains, and nuts; - all of which they imaged in i:he sky. They had, too, still another class of names peculiar to themselves, such as Al ~idak, Al Sima~, Al Suhii, respectively the .Trusted One, the Lofty One, the Neglected One; their Changers, Drivers, Followers, and Wardens; their Fortunate, or Unfortunate, Ones, and their Solitary Ones, etc. None of these early asterisms, however, were utilized by the scientific Arabians, but, with their titles, became merely interesting curiosities to them, as to us. These were known as " of the Arabs," while Ptolemy's figures were " of the astronomers,"- a distinction maintained in this book by the use of "Arab " or"Arabic" for the first, and "Arabian" for the last. The Persian astronomical writer, the dervish 'Abd al Ra~man Abii al I;Iusain, now better known as Al Sufi,1 the Mystic or Sage, made mention of this early distinction, in
I Al Sufi also was known as Al Razi, from his birthplace, Al Rayy. east of Teheran. A French translation of his work was published in 1874 by the late H. C. F. C. Schjellerup of Saint Petersburg.

964. in his Description of tlte Fixed Stars ; Kazwini following, three centuries later, with the same expressions. The various Arabic titles that we see applied to a single star or group, and the duplicate titles for some that are widely separated in the sky, apparently came from the various tribes, each of which had to a certain extent a nomenclature of its own. The rest of _our star-names, with but few exceptions, are directly from Greek or Latin originals,- many of these, as is the case with the Arabian, although now regarded as personal, being at first only adjectival or merely descriptive of the star's position in the constellation figure; while some are the result of misunderstanding, or of errors in translation and oft. repeated transcription. But these are now too firmly established to be discontinued or even corrected. Vergil wrote in the ut Georgu:
Navitn tum stellis numeros et nomina fecit;
and Seneca, the traditional friend of Saint Paul, in his QuaestioMs Nahlralts:
Graecia s'tellis numeros et nomina fecit;
both of these heathen authors almost exactly following the words of the sacred psalmist, who, at least four hundred years before, had sung:
He telleth the number of the stars; He giveth them all their names,
and of the prophet Isaiah :
He calleth them all by name.
While Seneca's statement may have some foundation, and Vergil's assertion as to the sailor's influence in star-naming may be true in part, yet for most of this we should probably look to the Desert, where the stars would be as much required and relied upon for guidance as on the trackless ocean, and so necessarily objects of attentive interest and study. Indeed, Mul)ammad told his followers, in the 6th Sura of the ¥ur'tin:
God hath given you the stars to be your guides in the dark both by land and sen.



Introduction xv
It seems safe to conclude that they were first named by herdsmen, hunters, and husbandmen, sailors and travelers, - by the common people generally, rather than by the learned and scientific; and that our modem lists are the gradual accumulation of at least three thousand years from various nations, but chiefly from the nomads, as well as the scholars, of Arabia,
those earthly godfathers of heaven's lights, That give a name to every fixed star,
and from Greece and Rome. It may be thought that too much attention has been paid to stellar mythology, now almost a hackneyed subject; but it serves to elucidate the literary history of the stars, and the age of its stories commands at least our interest. Indeed, we should remember that the stars were largely the source of these stories,- Eusebius, early in our 4th century, asserting in his Praeparalio .Evangelica:
The ancients believed that the legends about Osiris and Isis, and all other mythological fables [of a kindred sort], have reference either to the Stars, their configuration, their risings and their settings, etc.
And Proctor wrote in his Myths and Marvels of Astronomy that the chief charm of this study
does not reside in the wonders revealed to us by the science, but in the lore and legends connected with its history, the strange fancies with which in old times it has been associated, the half-forgotten myths to which it bas given birth.
Yet these myths, old as the present forms of some of them may be, are but modern and trivial when one goes back into the dim past to their probable fountainhead among the Himalayas and on the Ganges, or along the banks of the Euphrates, where the recent study of mythology discovers their origin in serious connection with the most ancient of earthly religions, long· antedating Moses,-" attempted explanations ofnatural phenomena," drawn from observations on the earth and in the sky of the powers of nature and of nature's God.
The world-wide field of research that I have endeavored to traverse, containing the records of four or five millenniums, it need hardly be said



XVI Introduction
demands for its exploration the best efforts, long continued, of the scientist and scholar accomplished in archaeology, astronomy, literature, and philology. None such, however, has appeared since ldeler's day, nearly a century ago ; so that, with the desire of taking up again this most interesting task, and the hope of thus stimulating others more competent to carry it on, I have done what I could, although frankly confessing that I have fallen very far short of my ideal. Originality is not claimed for my book Much of it has been gathered from widely scattered sources, brought together here for the first time in readily accessible form, although doubtless with errors and certainly with much omission; for while I have sought, as did Milton's II Penseroso, to sit and rightly spell Of every star that heav'n doth show,
yet in preparing my material I have seen, as Doctor Samuel Johnson wrote in the preface of his Dictionary,
that one enquiry only gave occasion to another, that book referred to book, that to search was not always to find, and to find was not always to be informed.
So that, following him,
I set limits to my work, which would in time be ended though not completed.
While to temper such criticism as may be bestowed upon my efforts, I quote again from the same source :
Dictionaries 1 are like watches ; the worst is better than none, and the best cannot be expected to go quite true.
Doctor Christian Ludwig Ideler's Unlersucltungen uberden Ursprungund die Bedeulung der Sternnamen, dated in Berlin the 2d of April, 1809, is the main critical compendium of information on stellar names -Arabic, Greek, and Latin especially. It is to him that we owe the translation of the
1 It is greatly to be regretted that our dictionaries are, without exception, singularly unsatisfactory as to star-titles, being always deficient and too often erroneous. The recent Cau11ry Cyc/Qpedia ofNatnes, however, contains the most correct, detailed, concise, and scholarly list that we have.



Introduction • xvii
original Arabic text of Kazwini's 1 Description of the Constellations, written in the 13th century, which forms the basis of the Sternnomen, with Ideler's additions and annotations from classical and other sources. From this much information in my book is derived. The Bedford Cata/ope in Captain (afterwards Vice-Admiral) William Henry Smyth's 2 Cycle of u/eslial Ol?J"ects, a book of exceptional value as to information on star-names and unique in its racy style, also has been drawn from. Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer's recent Dawn of Astron""'y - a most interesting work even if all his deductions are not accepted- has furnished many of the references to Egypt and its temple worship of various stars; this new study in orientation having been initiated by Professor Nissen of Germany, although independently so, about the same time, by Lockyer. Professor D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's Glossary of Greek Birds has been utilized as to the ornithological symbolism 3 on early coinage, sculpturing, etc.; for this, hitherto unintelligible, is now thought to be largely astronomical. The details of star-spectra mainly are from the Spectra/analyse der Geslinu, of 1890, by Doctor J. Scheiner, of the Royal Astrophysical Observatory of Potsdam, translated by Professor E. B. Frost, of Dartmouth College,
in 1894. The matter connected with the astronomy of China is chiefly from Mr. John Williams' work of 1871,- the Observations of Comets from 6zI B. C. lo A. D. z640, extnuted from tl,e CniMse A,mals,- the star-names being
1 His customary designation is from bis birthplace, ~a.zwln, in northern Persia, and has been variously given; Smyth aj/JrnJuzli,w it lo 'Omadu-d-din Abu Yahya Zakariyil Ibn-Mahmlld Ansilri aJ-KazwlnI. The name is correctly written Zal<ariyli ibn Mu~ammad ibn Mal,pmiid al ~a.zwlnl. He was collaborator with his noted fellow-countryman Na~r al Din al Tiisi, who, in 1270, compiled the 1/ltllaniat, Taj/es, used in Persia perhaps to the present day. a It is pleasant to us Americans lo know that Smyth was a lineal descendant ofCaptain John Smith of Virginia fame; and of interest to all New Jersey people that his father was from the province of East Jersey, but, as a loyalist in our Revolution, was compelled to flee lo England, where the son was born in 1788, He died, in 1865, after a most useful and distinguished career in the British navy and as astronomer and hydrographer. I This subject originally was broached by Gorius, in 1750, in his De Gemmi.r Astrifms; and Dupuis treated of it, although in an exaggerated way, a century ago.



XVlll - Introduction
from that or from Mr. John Reeves' Appendix 1 to Volume I, Part 2, of the Reverend Doctor Robert Morrison's Dictionary, published at Macao in 1819, with Bode's star-numbers. I have also been aided by the Reverend
Doctor Joseph Edkins' recent papers in the C/rina .Revuw. The translations of the names in Reeves' list are by Professor Kazutami Ukita, of the Doshisha Theological School of Kyoto, Japan; but he expresses misgivings as to the correctness of many of them in their stellar application. Professor Richard J. H. Gottheil, of Columbia University, has very kindly supervised the .transcription and translation of the Hebrew and Arabic star-names, and has added the table of the Arabic alphabet and the English equivalents of its letters. But his absence abroad while the earlier pages were going through the press will account for some errors, which, however, I have endeavored to correct in the Index. The Euphratean 2 titles are from various sources. The star-magnitudes are from the Esti.mates of the Harvard Photo11telry, a list of 4260 naked-eye stars north of the 30th parallel of south declination, published in 1884 by Professor Edward C. Pickering, or from the Uranometria Argtnti11a3 of the late Doctor Benjamin A. Gould, published in 1879. The star-maps of the northern sky to which I generally refer are those of Doctor Friedrich Wilhelm August Argelander in his Uranometria Nof.'a, published at Berlin, in 1843, with 3268 stars down to the 6th magnitude; and of Doctor Eduard Heis in his Atlas Coeleslis Novus of 1872. But
1 The original of Reeves' list is from the 3xst volume of the Led LeiA y.,.,,, Y11t111, in one hundred volumes, issued in the reign of Kang Hi, with Jesuit assistance. The early native titles seem to have been arbitrarily applied to single stars or small groups, with no apparent stellar signification. t The term " Euphratean " is used throughout these pages in a general way for the material lately discovered in the Euphrates Valley, the source of which-Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Chaldaean, or Assyrian - is as yet largely undetermined. The references to this material I have taken bodily from the works of Hommel, Sayce, Strassmaier and Epping, Jensen, and Robert Brown, Junior. 3 This great work is designed to include all stars down to the ;,th magnitude in that portion of the sphere within 100° of the south pole,-the favorable atmospheric conditions at C6rdoba, whence the observations were made, rendering even that magnitude readily visible. It comprises, of course, all the southern constellations, with 6733 stars, and those parts of the north
ern, with m stars, that lie below the 10th degree of north declination,- 66 constellations in all, with 7730 stars.



Introduction XlX
the last-named acute observer includes those to the 61⁄4 magnitude 1- 5421 stars from the pole to 40° of south declination, in eight tenths of the heavens. Smyth more conservatively wrote of this oft-mooted point in observational astronomy :
The n11mber of those seen by the naked eye at once is seldom much above a thousand; though from their scintillation, and the indistinct manner in which they are viewed, they appear to be almost infinite. Indeed, albeit the keen glances of experience might do more, the whole number that can be generally perceived by the naked eye, taking both hemispheres, is not greatly above three thousand, from the first to the sixth magnitudes, in abo11t these proportions :

1500,
3000 in all. Professor David P. Todd, in his New Astronomy of 1897, increases the number of 5th-magnitude stars to 1400, and of those of the 6th magnitude to 5000,-7185 in all; but ex~eptional conditions of eyesight and atmosphere probably must exist for confirmation of this. The star-colors generally are from Smyth's list whenever noted by him ; but it should be remembered that even good authorities sometimes differ as to stellar tints, and those assigned here will not be accepted by all, and in the case of minute objects are very doubtful. I have begun my work with brief notices of the Zodiacs,-Solar and Lunar,- that necessarily are constantly alluded to in treating of the individual Constellations; following these with three chapters on the latter,their history among the naiions, cataloguing and early treatment by authors, and their connection with astrology, art, folk-lore, literature, and religion. The detailed list of the Constellations, in alphabetical order, and of their named components follows, with the derivation, signification, and history of their titles, and some facts as to the scientific aspects of the stars. In this last feature of my book Professor Charles A. Young, of Princeton University, has,afforded me much valuable assistance, for which, although very inadequately, I here return my sincere thanks. A chapter on the Galaxy ends the work.
1He was enabled to do this by means of special arrangements for shutting off outside light from the field of sky under view ; so that the observations, although by the naked eye, were Doi unaided.



:x:x Introduction
Where thought necessary, the accentuation of the star-titles is given in the Indices, although in some cases, from the uncertainty of origin, this may be doubtful. · In conclusion, I would acknowledge my obligations for useful suggestions to Professor Edward S. Holden, till lately the Director of the Lick Observatory; to Mr. Addison Van Name, of the Yale University Library, for access to volumes of reference and help in translations; to Messrs Theodore L. De Vinne & Co. (the De Vinne Press), for their accustomed skill in the make-up of my book; and to Mr. P. J. Cassidy, for his interest and intelligent care in its proof-reading. Lastly do I thank my young friend Miss Lucy Noble Morris, of Morristown, for long-continued aid in various ways, especially in her tasteful selection of poetical illustrations. And now, with the hope that my work, even with its imperfections, may serve to foster a more intelligent interest in the nomenclature and "archaeology of practical astronomy," I submit it to all lovers of the stars.

STAR-NAMES AND THEIR MEANINGS

Luiz de Camoes' o, L.,lad,u,
Many theories have been propounded for the birthplace and time of formation of this; but there now seems to be general agreement of opinion that it originated, mainly as we have it, in archaic Euphratean astronomy, possibly with only the six alternate: signs, Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricomus, and Pisces, and later divided because of the annual occurrence of twelve full moons in successive parts of it. Yet Servius, about A. o. 400, said that for a long time it consisted of but eleven constellations, Scorpio and its claws being a double sign, this characteristic feature descending to Greece and Rome. Riccioli, about 1650, cited as a" Chaldean" title Hadronitho DemallllChe, or Circle of the Signs; but this must be taken with much allowance,1 for in his day Babylonian study had not begun, while modern scholars think that it was known to the Akkadians as Innum, and as Pidnu-eha-Shame, the Furrow of Heaven, ploughed by the heavenly Directing Bull, our Taurus, which from about 3880 to about 1730 B. c. was first of the twelve. Although our knowledge of that country's astronomy is as yet limited, it is certain that the Akkarlian names of the months were intimately connected with the divisions of this great circle; the calendar probably being taken from the stars about 2000 B, c., accordiQg to Professor Archibald Henry Sayce, of Oxford. Thence it passed to the Jews through .\s.~yria and Ararnaea, as the identity of its titles in those countries inpicates; and- the eleven, or twelve, signs for a time became with that people objects of idolatrous worship, as is evident from their history detailed in the 2J B()(Jk of the Kings, xxiii, 5. ·
In the Babylonian Creation Legend, or Epic of Creation, discovered by
I In fact. the same caution may be exercised in regard to much of the Euphratean transcription and translation throughout this work, as well as of the Chinese.



2 Star-Names and their Meanings
George Smith in 1872,1 the signs were llizriti,-a very similar word appears for the Milky Way,- generally supposed to be the original of the biblical llazziroth; llazziloth being the form used in the Targums and later Hebrew writings. This word, although ofuncertain derivation, may come from a root meaning" to watch," the constellations thus marking the watches of the night by coming successively to the meridian; but Doctor Thomas Hyde,2 the learned translator at Oxford in 1665 of the Zij, or Tables, of Ulug Beg, and of Al Tizini's work, derived them from Ezor, a Girdle; while the more recent Dillmann referred them to Zahir, from Zuhrah, a Glittering Star, and so signifying something specially luminous. Still this Bible word has been variously rendered, appearing for the Greater Bear, Sirius, the planets, or even for the constellations in general; indeed it has been thought to signify the Lunar Mansions. Another name with the Jews for the zodiac was Galgal Hammaziloth, the Circle of the Signs; and Bayer said that they fancifully designated it as
Opus Phrygionarum, the Work of the Phrygians, i. e., of the embroiderers in gold. The Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, followed by Saint Clement of Alexandria, A. o. 200, surmised that the twelve stones in the breastplate of the high priest might refer to the twelve zodiacal constellations. Philo Judaeus, of about the same time, associated the latter with the stars of Joseph's dream; the modern poet Johann Christoph Friedrich Schiller, in Die Piccolomini, thus alluding to the ancient opinion as to its sacred character: Twelve! twelve signs hath the zodiac, five and seven, The holy numbers include themselves in twelve;
while Smyth wrote:
The allegorical images of Jacob's blessing have been identified by several writers with the signs of the Via Solis, whence God, as bow-man, becomes Sagittarius. Hebrew antiquaries have long recognized Enoch as inventor of the Dodecatemory clivisions; and both Berosus [Bero,sos as now written,-the Chaldaean historian of about 26o B. c.] and Josephus declare that Abraham was famous for his celestial observations,
an~ even taught the Egyptians. As to this last people, while our twelve figures appear on the Denderah
1 This was found on tablets of the reign of As-sur-ba-ni-pal, 6oo B. c., although supposed to have been originally composed about 2350 B. c.: a supposition confirmed by Pl!re Scheil, who recently has found a fragment of this legend on a tablet bearing the name of Am-mi-za-du-ga, King of Babylon, 2140 B. c. s It was this Doctor Hyde who first described the wedge-shaped characters of the Persepolis inscriptions by the term cunrifon,us, now a word of universal acceptation.



The Solar Zodiac 3
planisphere doubtless from Greek or Roman influence, we have little knowledge as to what was the zodiac of their native astronomy, although it perhaps represented their twelve chief divinities; and Saint Clement tells us that the White, or Sacred, Ibis, Ibis aethiopica or religi<,sa, was its emblem. The Jesuit Father Athanasius Kircher,11602-1680, has left to us its separate Coptic-Egyptian titles in the Greek text, with their supposed significations in Latin ; but these, presumably translations from the originals, are not lexicon words. Among them, for the zodiac itself, is Taμnovpo evuviq,(Ja, whatever that may be. But Miss Agnes M. Clerke says that when Egypt adopted the Greek figures it was with various changes that effaced its character as "a circle of living things." In Arabia the zodiac was Al llin?,kah al Buriij, the Girdle of the Signs, that Bayer quoted as Almantioa sm llitac; and, more indefinitely, it was
Al r ~ the Expanse of the Sky.
In Greece it was Ta awde1CaT71μ,6pia, the Twelve Parts, and oZwdm,c6i;Kvdoi;-; but Aristotle, the Humboldt of the 4th century before our era, called it b Kvdoi;- TW'II Zwd[wv,2 the Circle of Little Animals, the signs before Libra was introduced being all of living creatures. The German Thierkreil has the same signification. Proclus of our 5th century called it b Aof6i;Kvdoi;-, the Oblique Circle, that originally was for the ecliptic; but with Aratos, who regarded the claws as distinct from Scorpio, it was Ta "EuJwla dvo.fa{desa, the Twelve Images'. As Homer and Hesiod made no allusion to it, we may consider as in some degree correct the statement that another poet, Cleostratos of Tenedos, made it known in Greece about 500 B. c., from his observations on Mount 0lda. In Rome it commonly was ZodiaCUI; the Orbit qui Graece ZtoJdtaK6i;duilur of Cicero's De Divinalione ; and the Orbit ligniferu, or Ciroulu1 lignifer, of Cicero and Vitruvius, the Sign-bearing Circle, that became Signiportant in the Livre tie Creatures, the 12th-century Anglo-Norman poem of Philippe de Thaun. Poetically it was lledia Via Selia and Orbit& Solla; the Balteu 1tellatu of Manilius, the Starry Belt; and the varii llutator Circulu anni of Lucan.
Bayer's Sigillariu probably is a Low Latin word for the Little Images ; and he quoted Limbu textilia, the Woven Girdle, and Faaoia, the Band, that Ptolemy used for the Milky Way.
1 Kircher was a distinguished mathematician and scholar to whom, as also to Roger Bacon of four centuries previously, is attributed the invention of the magic lantern. In Samuel Boteler·s celebrated poem Hllllwrru, 1663-1678, he is alluded to as " the Coptic priest Kircherus." It wa. he who began the modem study of the Egyptian hieroglyphics. 2 This is the first mention of the zodiac by any extant writer.

Chaucer's terms may have been taken from Ovid's Formasque ferarum. In manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxons it is llielan oircul zodiac~ the Great Zodiacal Circle, and Twelf Taona, the Twelve Signs; but their descendants, our English ancestry of four or five centuries ago, knew it as the Bestiary, Our Ladye'1 Waye, and as the Girdle of the Sky; while the ecliptic was the Yoke of the Sky, or Thwart Circle, and the prime meridian, the Noonsteede, or Noonstead, Circle. Milton, in Paradise Lost, thus accounts for the obliquity of the earth's axis, as if by direct interposition of the Creator:
Some say, he bid his angels turn askance The poles of earth twice ten degrees or more From the sun's axle; they with Jabour push'd Oblique the centric globe: some say, the sun Was bid turn reins from th' equinoctial road Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven Atlantic Sisters, and the Spartan Twins, Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amain By Leo, and the Virgin, and the Scales, As deep as Capricorn, to bring in change Of seasons to each clime.
Pope, in his Essay on Man, called it the Solu Walk, and, before his day, its various divisions were the Hou1e1 of the Sun, and the lll[onthly A.bod.ea of Apollo.
Dante Alighieri, 1265-1321, designated it

In the neighboring Persia, the Bundehesh, or Cosmogony, in the Pahlavi dialect, of about the 8th or 9th century, a queerly mixed farrago of Persian and Semitic words, mentions our zodiacal divisions as the Twelve A.khtin that lead the army of Ormuzd, while the seven Asvahtars, or planets (including a meteor and a comet), fight for Aryaman. But the twelve signs of that country, as also those of China and India, were gathered into four great groups marking the four quarters of the heavens, each with a Royal Star or Guardian; and the Avesta, or Divine Law, of Zoroaster is thought to mention a heavenly circle of figures equivalent to our zodiac. Mr. Robert Brown, Jr., says that in China the Kung, or
zodiacal signs, are the Tiger (Sagittarius); the Hare (Scorpio); the Dragon (Libra); the Serpent (Virgo); the Horse (Leo); the Ram (Cancer); the Ape (Gemini); the Cock (Taurus); the Dog (Aries); the Boar (Pisces); the Rat (Aquarius); the Ox (Capricornus). This is a sodiac indeed; but although the late&t research [notably by the late Doctor Terrien de Lacouperie) points to a more western origin of Chinese civilization (as of about 4000 years ago], and even (a most interesting fact) to the original identity of the Chinese pictorial writing with the Akkadian Cuneiform, as both springing from one prior source, yet the Chinese Zodiac is evidently independent, and none the less so because it happens to include the Ram and the Bull, which, however, are not Aries and Taurus.
It is well shown on the Temple Money,1 a full set of which, of uncertain age, is in my possession. This Chinese zodiac, however, progressed in reverse order from our own, opposed to the sun's annual course in the heavens, and began with the Rat. It was known as the Yellow Way, the date of formation being assigned to some time between the 27th and 7th centuries before our era, and the twelve symbols utilized to mark the twelve months of the year. It was borrowed, too, by the neighboring nations ages ago, some of its features being still

current among them. After the establishment in China of the Jesuits in the 16th century our zodiac was adopted, its titles being closely translated and now in current use. In England the Venerable Bede, 673-735, substituted the eleven apostles for eleven of the early signs, as the Corona NU Ciroul111 aanotorum Apoetolo
rum. John the Baptist fitly taking the place of Aquarius to complete the circle. Sir William Drummond, in the 17th century, turned its constellations into a dozen Bible patriarchs; the Reverend G. Townsend made of them the twelve Caesars; and there have been other fanciful changes of this same character. Indeed, the Tree of Life in the Apoca(ypse has been thought a type of the zodiac, as
bearing twelve manner of fruits, yielding its fruit every month.
Probably every nation on earth has had a solar zodiac in some form, generally one of animals. Even in Rhodesia, the aboriginal Mashona 1 Land of South Africa, there has recently been found a stone tablet thirty-eight inches in diameter, with the circle of the zodiacal signs on the edge; and early Mandaean tradition makes its figures children of their creative spirits Ur and Ruha. The introduction of the twelve figures into the walls or pavements of early churches, cathedrals, and public edifices, as well as, sometimes, private houses, is often to be noticed in Europe, and still more frequently in the temples of the East; 2 while all visitors to the New York State Building in the World's Columbian Exposition of Chicago in 1893 will recall the striking octagonal zodiac3 designed by Messrs. McKim, Mead, and White, and laid in brass in the floor of the entrance hall, which, although not astronomically correct, greatly added to the interior effect of that beautiful structure. The zodiacal constellations being of unequal extent, Hipparchos more scientifically divided the ecliptic circle into twelve equal spaces of 300 each, the twelve signs still in almanac use; but these are not now coincident with the similarly named constellations, having retrograded about 33° on the sphere since their formation. The constellation north or south of the one of the zodiac that rose or set synchronically with it in Greece was known, in later days, as its paranatellon.

once bore an important part in observational astronomy, especially in that of Arabia, China, and India, and of Khiva - the ancient Khorasmia - and Bole.hara- the ancient Sogdiana; while recent research finds them well established in the Euphrates valley, Coptic Egypt and Persia, perhaps originating in the first. They lay for the most part along the celestial equator or in the zodiac, varying in extent, although theoretically each was supposed to represent the length of the moon's daily motion in its orbit. They sometimes were twenty-seven, but usually twenty-eight in number, the lunar month being between twenty-seven and twenty-eight days, and possibly long antedated the general constellations, or even the solar zodiac. They seem to have been among the earliest attempts at stellar science; indeed with the Khorasmians, to whom Al Binini attributed great knowledge of the stars, an astronomer was called Akhtar Wenik, Looking to the Lunar Stations; and they have largely been made use of in the astrology of all ages, as well as in early poetry and prose, even in Arabic doggerel. Their astrological characters were various, eleven being considered fortunate, ten the reverse, and seven of uncertain influence; but each, at least in India, was associated with some occurrence of life. Their antiquity is proved by the fact that there, and probably elsewhere, the list began with the Pleiades, when those stars marked the vernal equinox, although this was changed about the beginning of our era, owing to precession, to stars in Aries, the z7th of the early series, and further from the fact that many of their titles occur in the most ancient books of China, and are positively claimed there as of at least 2500 B. c. While these lunar asterisms in the main agree as to their component stars, -eighteen arecoincident,-some of the Hindu and Chinese are located in our Andromeda, Aquila, Bootes, Crater, Delphinus, Hydra, Lyra, Orion, and Pegasus, outside of the moon's course. Nor are their titles similar, except in the 16th, 17th, and 28th of China and Arabia; but our great Sanskrit scholar Whitney thought that this can hardly be fortuitous, and claimed,

from this and other points of resemblance, that they are "three derivative forms of the same original." They have been much disputed about, 1 yet no substantial agreement has been reacherl as to the date of their formation, or their plac~ of origin. Whitney's resume of the discussion appears in his Lunar Zodiac, his conclusion being that the moon stations were adopted into India, perhaps everywhere, from Mesopotamia, their birthplace. Biot, early in this century, said that they were of Chinese origin, and Sedillot, that they came from Arabia; but Miss Clerke considers India as their source, and that they were first published in Arabia, in Al Ferghani's Elements of Astronomy, under the Khalif Al Mamun, in the early part of the 9th century, when Hindu cultivation in art, literature, and the sciences was much looked up to by the Arabians. Yet in the year 1000 Al Bin1ni wrote, in his India, about its astronomers:
I never came across any one of them who knew the single stars of the lunar stations from eyesight, and was able to point them out to me with his fingers.
The Hindus knew them as 1'alahatru, Asterisms, the J'ufiir of Al Birfmi, and thought them influential in their worship, and selected from the list the names of their months; but, although in some form or other they were very ancient in India, they do not seem to have been fully recognized there until the 7th or 8th century before Christ, when they appeared in the Brahmanas.
Unlike their counterparts in Arabia and China, each seems to have been represented by some special figure, in no way associated with the title. In Arabia they were Al Nujum al Alidh, the Stars of Entering, and Al B.ibi~t, the Roadside Inns, although better known as Al Ka.nizil al ~ ' the Mansions, or Resting-Places, of the Moon; maflzil, in the singular, signifying the noonday halt of camel and rider in the desert. Readers of Ben Hur will recall this in connection with Balthasar, the Egyptian, at the meeting of the Magi in their search for Him " that is born King of the Jews," after they saw
his star in the east, and are come to worship him.
They are alluded to in the 10th Sura of the .§:ur'tin, where, referring to the moon, it says that God
1 Professors Whitney and Newton have done the most to elucidate the subject in all its details by their article of 1858 in the Journal oftlu Ameruan Orimlal Sockly on the Sitry.i Siddkanta, the Straight (or Standard) Book of the Sun, the most important astronomical book of India, and claimed by the Hindus to be of divine origin, although Al Biriini asserted that it was composed by La!a,

hath appointed her stations, that ye might know the number of years, and the computation of time;
but long before the Prophet the authors of the Chaldaean Creation Legend and of Genesis wrote similarly; while in the 104th Psalm, that noble nature-psalm for Whitsunday, we read:
He appointed the moon for seasons.
In China they were Sieu, Houses, the series commencing with Kio,- a and ( Virginis,- at the September equinox ; and some are disposed to regard them there not merely as lunar divisions, but also as determinant points in reference to the movements of the sun and planets. Differing, however, from the analogous divisions of other nations, they generally were located along the equator. In the legends of that country they were the sky representatives of twenty-eight celebrated generals. They also were introduced into Japan at an early day, and the chronicler of Magellan's voyage in 1521 found them familiarly known in the ~lalay Archipelago, and their astrological influence well recognized. These Hindu, Arabic, and Chinese lunar asterisms have long been familiar to us, but the Persian have more recently been found in the Bundehesh, and Brown has only lately published transcriptions and translations of the Chal<laean, Khorasmian, and Sogdian titles;- the originals of the last two from Al Birani,- as also the significations of the Coptic and Persian. Their names and locations are given in connection with their component stars throughout this work; and they have been charted in detail by Williams and by Newton. Other divisions of the sky, somewhat analogous to these, were the Decau of the Chaldaeans, Egyptians, and Greeks, "belts of stars extending round the heavens, the risings of which followed each other by ten days or so," but of much greater extent north and south than the Lunar Mansions, and thirty-six in number instead of twenty-eight. Miss Clerke writes of them :
The Chaldaeans chose three stars in each sign to be the " councillor gods " of the planets. These were called by the Greeks "decans," because ten degrees of the ecliptic and ten days of the year were presided over by each. The college of the decans was conceived as moving, by their annual risings and settings, in an "eternal circuit" between the infernal and supernal regions.
They are mentioned by Manilius as Deoa.nia, by others as Decanioa,
Decane, Decanon, Degane, Deganae, and Decima; while the lords of the decans were known as Decani and their titles have been preserved to us

now designated by arbitrary lines outside and entirely independent of the figures, in ancient times were confined within the outlines of the forms that they were supposed to represent, although any resemblance was only occasionally noticeable. All stars adjacent to but beyond these were called by the Greeks aμ,6pcpwTot, unformed, and mropdou;, scattered, which Latin authors followed in their extra, informes, dispersae, disseminatae, and sparsiles; and the Arabians in their Al H'arfj 111i11 Al .Jurah, Outside of the Image. In our day, however, every star is within the limits of some one of the constellations, although the boundaries of these are not in all cases agreed upon by astronomers. Still those adopted by Argelander are generally accepted for the northern figures, as those of Gould are for the southern ; Gould's boundaries largely agreeing with the suggestions of Sir John
Herschel, i. e., formed by arcs of meridians and parallels of declination for a given epoch. The figures were variously known by the Greeks as l:.~1iaTa and Teipea, Signs; l:.wμaTa, Bodies; Zwr.lta, Animals; and as Me,fopa, Things in Heaven, our word Meteors. Hipparchos said'AaTep1aμo1, as did Ptolemy, but also alluded to them as Mopcpwuetf, Semblances, and J:.x4μam, Figures. Pliny and other Latins called them A1tra, Sidera, and Signa, while later on Conatellatio appeared, that in the ~515 Almagest is Stellatio; and the Arabians knew them as Al ,uwar, Figures.



The Constellations 11
Aratos, in the 4»at1•01u:va of 270 B. c., mentioned forty-five, but many of these probably had been formed millenniums previously by the Chaldaeans, or even by their predecessors; in fact, he is not supposed to have invented any that he described. Eratosthenes, nearly a century after Aratos, reduced the number to forty-two in the Ka,aaTeptaμ.oi that were attributed to his authorship until Bernhardy's time; as did Gaius Julius Hyginus Historia, about the beginning of our era, in his reputed work, the .Poe/icon Aslronomicrm, and Decimus Magnus Ausonius, the Christian poet of nearly four centuries later. The Catalogue of Hipparchos, no,v lost except as preserved by Ptolemy, is said to have contained forty-nine constellations with 1080 stars; but his Commentary on E11doxos a11d Aratos, that we still have, mentions only fortysix. It was of this great astronomer that Pliny wrote in the year 78, as translated by Philemon Holland, in 1634, in his Historie of the Worlde:
The same man went so farre that he attempted (a thing even hard for God to perform) to deliver to posteritie the just number of starres;
and asserted that this was induced by the appearance, in 134 B. c., of the bright nova, or temporary star, in Scorpio. The observations of Hipparchos seem to have been made between 162 and 127 B. c. Pliny, although but a poor cosmographer, devoted two chapters to astronomy in the Hisloria Nat11rolis, and, according to the usual rendering, mentioned seventy-two 1 asterisms with 1600 stars; but this, if the original be correctly understood, could have been only by separately counting parts of the old figures, for nowhere does he allude to any that are new, unless it be his Thronos Caesaris, probably the Southern Cross. Ptolemy scientifically followed with those now known as the ancient forty-eight, in the 7th and 8th books of the Syn/axis, twelve of the zodiac with twenty-one northern and fifteen southern, made up by 1028 stars, in
cluding 102 aμopq,wr-01, all probably from Hipparchos, although with some acknowledged alterations by himself; for in the 5th chapter of his 7th book he wrote:
we employ not the same Figures of the Constellations that those before us did, as neither did they of those before them, but frequently make Use of others that more truly represent the Forms for which they are drawn.

gree of south declination, his earliest recorded observations being in A. n. 127 and the last in 15 1 ; and we find with him the first comparative list of star magnitudes. In the year 1252 Europe resumed its old position in astronomical work by the compilation of Los Li/Jros tie/ Saber de Aslronomia, the celebrated
Alfonsi11t Tt1/Jks, by Arabian or Moorish astronomers, at Toledo, under , the patronage of the Infante, afterward King Alfonso X, El Sabio, the Wi11e, and the Astronomer, of Leon and Castile, who "abandoned the crown for the astrolabe and forgot the earth for the sky." These Ta/Jiu and their Latin translations are strongly Arabicized, as plainly appears in our modem star-titles drawn f~om them; while the whole work is in the main only copied from Ptolemy with some necessary corrections. But it probably fairly represents the science of the Middle Ages, and was in use until at least the 16th century; for Eden,1 in 1555, quoted from Gemma Phrysius' On the Maner of Fyndyngt lht Lo11giludt: "Then eythcr by the Ephemerides or by the tables of Alphonsus .•.

The Constellations
In the 15th century, however, it was corrected and copied under the auspices of the celebrated Ulug Beg, grandson of the great Tatar conqueror, Timur i Leng, Timur the Lame, our Tamerlane, and, as his Tables, was published at Samarkhand, with the date of the 5th of July, 1437. The constellation descriptions in these are from Al Sufi's translation of five centuries previously, the titles of a few groups being changed; and the intrinsic excellence of the work, as well as the deservedly great reputation of its author as an astronomer, supported by many able assistants, made it a standard authority for nearly two centuries. Following Ulug Beg, but from Europe, came in 1548-51 the globes of Gerardus Mercator (Gerhard Kramer), on which wer!! located fifty-one asterisms with 934 stars, besides numerous infor111es. About this time Copernicus' great work laid the foundations of modern astronomy, and was soon followed.by Tycho Brahe's posthumous catalogue of 1602, with forty-six constellations, but only 777 stars, the mystic number, and so perhaps by design, for the author, although the first real observer of modern days, was still under the influence of astrology. In the succeeding year appeared the Uranomelria of Johann Bayer, the great Protestant lawyer of Augsburg, a work also much tinctured with the occult science, in which the author probably followed Tycho. This contained spirited drawings, after Dilrer, of the ancient forty-eight figures, with a list of 1709 stars and twelve new southern asterisms. These last were its noticeable feature, with the fact that in the plates of the ancient constellations for the first time formally appeared Greek and Roman letters to indicate the individual stars, and so conveniently taking the place of the cumbersome descriptions till then in vogue.1 Although this lettering did not come into general use until the succeeding century, Bayer had been anticipated in it fifty years before by Piccolomini of Siena, and even the Persi(ms and Hebrews are said to have had something similar. Dr. Robert Wittie, of London, in his 'Ovpavooitorrla of 1681, wrote of this last people:
Aben Ezra tells that they first divided the Stars into Constellations, and expressed them all by the Hebrew Letters, which when they had gone through, they added a second Letter to express the shape, and oft-times a third to ~et forth the Nature of the Constellation.
After Bayer new constellations were published in the Planisphaerium Stdlat11m of 1624 by Jakob Bartsch (Bartschius); in the Rutlolphi11e Tables of 1627, Kepler's edition of Tycho's catalogue; in Augustin Royer's work of 1679; and in the Catalogue of Southern Stars of the same year, by Doctor Edmund Halley, from his observations at Saint Helena. The .Prodromus .-tstronomiae of 1690, by Johann Hewel, or Hoevelke (Hevelius), and its
I So leltering, however, was applied by Bayer to stars of the twelve new southern figures.

appendix with plates, the Fir"'a1Mnl11»1 Sobiescianum, also gave ne•· figures, as did the Historia Coeleslis Britan11ica of the Reverend Doctor John Flamsteed, completed in 1729 by Crosthwait and Sharp after Flamsteed's death in 1719. This comprised fifty-four constellations, the stars being consecutively numbered in the order of their right ascension; the companion Atlas following in 1753, and again in 1781. The Abbe Nicolas Louis de La Caille, "the true Columbus of the southern sky," 1 in his Mlmoires of 1752 and his Coe/um Slelliferum of 1763, introduced fourteen new groups, "to which he assigned the names of the principal implements of the sciences and fine arts"; while a few others were formed by Pierre Charles Le Monnier from 1741 to 1755, and by Joseph Jerome Le Fran~is (dil de La Lande) from 1776 to 1792, the 3d edition of La Lande's Astronomie containing a total of eighty-eight constellations. Lastly, in 1800, Johann Ellert Bode published nine new figures in his Uranographi"a, although some of these were by La Lande; a 2d edition, entitled Die Geslirne, being issued in 1805. But none of these inventions of , the last three authors are now recognized. The greater part of the new constellations were of course in the south. a quarter of the heavens which, although alluded to by a writer of the time of Pharaoh Neku, who sent a Phoenician fleet to circumnavigate Africa about 600 B. c., practically was unknown till the discovery of the Ne•· World stimulated the efforts of the early voyagers at the beginning of the 16th century. Some of these have left records of their stellar observations among them the Italians Corsali, Pigafetta, and Vespucci, and the Dutch Pieter Theodor of Embden (Embdanus), alias Pieter Dircksz Keyser, and Friedrich Houtmann. But the results did not formally appear till a century later in the works of Bayer and Kepler, although they were mentioned in the Decades of Peter Martyr 2 and in Eden's translations of it and similar works ; and some of the figures were inserted on the now almost unknown globes of 'Emeric Mollineux, Jodocus Hondius, and Jansenius Caesius (Willem Jansson Blaeu), of 1592 and the years following. The hitherto unfigured space around the south pole, the object of these observations, was an eccentric one as to the pole, although in itself circular, reaching from Argo, Ara, and Centaurus, now within 20° of that point on

one side,. to Cetus and Piscis Australis, within 60° on the other; while its centre, near y Hydri and the Nubecula Minor, was the pole of 2000 to 2400 B. c., when a Draconis corresponded to it on the north. From this fact came Proctor's ingenious argument that such was the date of formation of the latest of the ancient constellations. It is perhaps worthy of notice that the Ductor in linguas, or Guide into Tongues, the polyglot dictionary of 1617-27, by John Minsheu (Minshaeus), at the word Asterisme in the later editions alluded to
Eighty-four in all besides a few found out of late by the Discoverers of the South Pole ;
but he gave no detailed list, and doubtless erred in his statement. In our day there is discrepancy in the number of constellations accepted by astronomers, few of whom entirely agree in recognition of the modem formations. For, although Ideler described 106, with allusions to others entirely obsolete, or of which nearly all traces had been lost, Argelander catalogued only eighty-six, Vela, Puppis, and Carina being included under Argo; and the British Associalio11 Catalogue of 1845 only eighty-four. Proft'SSor Young recognizes sixty-seven as in ordinary use, although he catalogues eighty-four, Argo being divided into Carina, Puppis, and Vela; Upton's Star Atlas, of 1896, eighty-five; and the Standard Dictionary eightynine, but the latter's list of 188 star-names is disappointing. Nor should I forget to mention a very popular book in its day, the Geography of the Heavens, with its Atlas by Elijah H. Burritt, published in various editions from 1833 to 1856. This described fifty well-recognized constellations visi
ble from the latitude of Hartford, Connecticut, 41 ° 46'; although his table of those in the entire heavens included ninety-six, most of which appeared in the accompanying maps, the figures being taken from Wollaston's drawings. Although not an original work of great scientific value, and erroneous as well 3.5 deficient in its stellar nomenclature, it had a sale of over a quarter of a million copies, and much influence in the dissemination of astronomical knowledge in the generation now passing away. I am glad to pay here my own tribute to the memory of the author, in acknowledgment of the sen·ice rendered me in stimulating a boyhood interest in the skies. From eighty to ninety constellations may be considered as now more or less acknowledged; while probably a million stars are laid down on the various modern maps, and this is soon to be increased perhaps to three millions upon the comple~ion of the present photographic work for this object by the international association of eighteen observatories engaged upon it in different parts of the world. The first instalment in print of these ou

sen·ations may be expected in a few years ; the whole perhaps iD twenty6,re or thirty years. It has been the fashion with astronomers to decry this multiplictty of sky figures, and with good reason; for, as Miss Clerke writes in her monograph on Tiu Hersduls and Modem Astronomy:
Cel('Stial maps had become " a system of derangement and confusion," of confusion .. worse coofoanded." New asterisms, carved out of old, existed precariously, recognited by !IOmc, ignored by others; waste places in the sky had been annexed by encroaching astronomers as standing-ground for their glorified telescopes, quadrants. sextants, dxl,:-: a chemical apparatus had been set up by the shore of the river Eridanus, itself a meanderi:ig and uncomfortable figure; while serpents and dragons trailed their perplexing com-olutioas through hoar after hour of right ascension;
with more to the same effect. This condition of things led the Royal Astronomical Societ}', in 1841, to depute to Sir John Herschel and Mr. Franci< Baily the task of attempting a reform. But although improvement was made by the discarding of several figures and the subdivision of others. their changes were too sweeping and were not successful, so that as the constell:1tions stood then, in the main do they stand to-day, and so "ill they prohabl}' remain, at least with the people. The change from the old system of star-designations, however, has been much more thorough, and, except in the popular mind, has been practically accompl:shed; but now in turn 1s there confusion in their substitutes, the ,·arious catalogue numbers and letters. even among the astronomers. and certainly with us unscientific star-gazers. As to this Miss Clerke graphically continues:

The Constellations
Aratos,1 the first Greek poetical writer on astronomy now extant, described them as from the most ancient times, and wrote in the Phainomma:
Some man of yore A nomenclature thought of and devised, And forms sufficient found.
So thought he good to make the stellar groups, That each by other lying orderly, They might display their forms. And thus the stars At once took names and rise familiar now.
His sphere, probably identical with that of Eudoxos of a century previous, accurately represented the heavens of about 2000 to 2200 B. c., a fact which has induced many to think it a reproduction from Babylonia; and the disagreement in the poet's description with the sky of his day led Hipparchos, the first commentator on the Phai11omena, to much needless although in some cases well-founded criticism;" for Aratos was, as Cicero said, ltominem ignarum aslronomiae. Still his poem is now apparently our sole source of knowledge as to the arrangement of the early constellations, and has been closely followed in all star-maps as an indispensable guide. It seems to have been a versification of its now lost prose namesake by Eudoxos, somewhat influenced by the writings of Theophrastus, and had a great run in its day. Landseer 2 wrote in his Sa/Jaean .Researches of 1823:
When the poem entitled the Phenomena of Aratus was introduced at Rome by Cicero anrl other leading characters, we read that it became the polite amusement of the Roman ladies to work the celestial forms in gold and silver on the most costly hangings; and this had previously been done at Athens, where concave ceilings were also emblazoned with the heavenly figures, under the auspices of Antigonus Gonatas,
King of Macedonia and patron of Aratos. It has always been much translated, versified, commented upon, and quoted from; and we know of thirtyfive Greek commentaries on this work. "It continued to be used as a practical manual of sidereal astronomy as late a,; the 6th century of our era." Cicero translated it in his youth, seventy years before the appearance of Vergil's Aeneid; Germanicus Ca!sar did the same about A. o. 15; and Rufus Festus Avienus versified.it in our 4th century: all commented on by Hugo Grotius in his Synlagma Araleorom of 1600.

translations the most literal and useful is that of Mr. Robert Brown, Jr.• in 1885. Saint Paul's supposed quotation from it in Tiu Acts of tlu .Apostks, :mi. 28, perhaps made it popular with the Christians of his and subsequent times, for apparent references to it occur in the writings of the early fathers. It may be assumed that, with the exception of Ursa Minor, Equuleu~. and Libra in its present shape, the sources of the old forty-eight have been lost in their great antiquity. Yet Pliny asserted that Aries and Sagittarius were formed by Cleostratos at some time between 548 and 432 B. c. ; and the rest, with equal improbability, have been ascribed by Aristotle's pupil Eudemos to the Pythagorean Oinopides of Chios as of about 500 B. c., but from Egyptian dictation. Whatever may be the facts as to all this, we know that a long line of notable Greeks, from Homer !ind Hesiod to Ptolemy, were interested in. and have preserved to us, their constellated heavens. Of these the first astronomers were Thales, 640-546 B. c., who gave us Ursa Minor; Eudoxos, who. according to common story, brought the constellations from Egypt. and. about 366 B. c., was the first to publish them in the original prose .Pltai11,1nu11a, Cicero calling him the greatest astronomer that ever lived; while Hipparchos,1 of whom Pliny said 1IU111Jtlalll salis laudalus, is the acknowledged founder of our modem science. His works, however, are now lost, except his Co111mmtary and the star-catalogue reproduced by Ptolemy. All these are mentioned with respect even by the astronomers of to-day; and it is certain that we find in their country the immediate source of most of the constellations as they now appear on our maps, and of the stories connected therewith. Yet these unquestionably are in many cases variations of long antecedent, perhaps prehistoric, legends and observations from the Euphrates, Ganges, and Nile; indeed the Greek astronomers always acknowledged their indebtedness to Chaldaea and Egypt, but gave most of the credit to the latter. While we have few individual star-titles from Greece, the characters of the Argonautic Expedition are largely represented in the heavens; and Saint Clement, followed by many,-even by the great Sir Isaac Newton,- attnl>uted the invention of the constellations to Chiron, the reputed preceptor oi Jason, for the latter's use on that celebrated voyage, fixing its date as about 1420 B. c. And, coincidently as to the time of their formation, that good authority Seneca said that they were from the Greeks of about r 500 B. c.,

which may be true to the extent that they then adopted them from some earlier nation. But the mythologists ascribed them to Atlas, the Endurer, the father of the Hyades and Pleiades, so skilled in knowledge of the skies that he was shown as their supporter; and they had a story fitted to every heavenly figure. But much of this is more than unreliable, even childish, and we are only sure that Greece originated our scientific astronomy and gave great attention to it from the times of Thales and Anaximander; this culminating in the work of the Alexandrian School,1 Egyptian in location, but entirely Greek in character. To the Romans we owe but little in the way ofastronomy,-indeed they always were ready to acknowledge the superiority of Greece in this respect, - although we find much of stellar mythology and meteorology in their poetry and prose. No real astronomer, however, appeared among them; and when Julius Caesar needed such for his reform of the calendar, albeit himself somewhat skilled in the science, as his .De Astris shows, he was compelled to call Sosigenes to his aid. The architect Vitruvius (Marcus Vitruvius Pollio), just before the beginning of our era, apparently was the most scientific among them, and in the 9th book of his .De Architectura tells us much of their star-lore in connection with the proper location of sun-dials; while Columella, of our 1st century, in his .De Re Rustica made many allusions to stars and constellations in their supposed connection with the weather and crops. Many have maintained that Egypt was the first to give shapes and names to the star-groups; Dupuis, perhaps inspired by Macrobius of our 5th century, tracing the present solar zodiac to that country, and placing its date 13,000 years anterior to our era, when the flow of the Nile with its consequent harvests, and the seasons, coincided with the positions of the separate figures and the characters assigned to them. In this he has been followed by others even to our day. The little that we know of Egypt's early constellations indicates that they apparently were of native origin, and in no respect like those of Greece, which, if adopted at all, were so at a very late time in that history, and from the influence of the dominant Greeks, perhaps aided by recollections
I This great school was begun by such men as the two Arystilli and Timochares, under Ptolemy Soter, JOO B. c., the first really scientific astronomers who initiated the observations 1ba1 are generally supposed to have led Hipparchos to his discovery of the phenomenon of prectssion; and it was carried on by Aristarchos, Eratosthenes (the inventor of the ormillary 'Phere), Euclid (the geometrician), Conon, Sosigenes, and lastly Ptolemy, who ended thefam,,us list in A. o. 151, although the school was nominally maintained till the final destruction of the great Alexandrian Library in the 7th century.

of Chaldaea. Diodorus the Sicilian, of the 1st century before Christ, and Lucian, of three centuries later, distinctly assert this. The following are among the native stellar groups of Egypt so far as at present can be thought assured : Sahu, identified with Orion, although by some limited to the head of that figure; Sept, Set, Sotbia, etc., with Sirius; the Hippopot&m111, a part of our Draco; the Thigh, our Ursa Major; the Deer, our Cassiopeia, although some place the Leg here. The doubtful ones were Kena, or Kenat, an immense figure if Renoufl be correct in his statement that it included Antares and Arcturus ; the Kany Stan, our Coma llerenices; Arit, that Renouf thought may have been marked by {3 Andromedae ; the Fleece, indicated by some stars of Aries ; the Gooae, by a Arietis ; Chu, or Chow, the Pleiades; the Cynooephal111, claimed by La Lande for Ara's stars; the Servant, that Brugsch says was our Pegasus, although the Denderah planisphere shows a Jackal here ; the Two Stan, that we may guess were Castor and Pollux; and the Lute-Bearer, or lLepi, the Lord, perhaps our Spica. Those so far unidentified were the Stan of the Water; Kena'■ Herald; Kena'■ Follower■ ; Neoht, in the vicinity of our Draco; the Lion, but not our Leo; and the Hare, with some others that La Lande indefinitely alluded to as lying on the borders of Ophiuchus and Scorpio and in Aquarius. A reference is made in Egypt's veritable history to the vernal equinox, then in our Taurus, 3285 B. c.; yet the astronomy of that country was not scientific, and we know little of it except as connected with religion, the worship in the north, about 5200 B. c., of the northern stars being associated with the god An, Annu, Ant, or On, under the supposed government of Set, or Typhon, the god of darkness, recognized under many synonyms. That of the east and west stars was indicated by the Ghizeh temples and pyramids, about 4000 B. c.; while in southern Egypt the worship of the southern stars, as early as 6400 B. c., perhaps much earlier, was presided over by Horus, a southern sun-god, although later he occasionally appeared as a northern divinity. The rising stars represented the youthful goddesses; those setting, the dying gods; while a figure of three stars together symbolized divinity. Assertions as to India being the first home of astronomy, and the birthplace of the constellation figures, have been made by many-notably, a century ago, by Sir William Jones and Messrs. Colebrooke, Davis, and Von Schlegel; but modem research finds little in Sanskrit literature to confirm this belief, while it seems to be generally acknowledged that the Hindus

borrowed much from Greece, perhaps beginning with Pythagoras, who is said to have traveled there and even listened to Zoroaster's teachings. Indeed, Aryabhata, of our 5th or 6th century, reckoned by the same signs as Hipparchos; and their most noted later astronomer, Vara.ha Mihira,1 of 504, in writing of the constellations, used the Grecian titles, changed, however, to suit his native tongue. But Arabia also probably exercised influence over them, as over the rest of Asia. Professor Whitney's opinion as to this is summed up thus :
We regard the Hindu science as an offshoot from the Greek, planted not far from the commencement of the Christian era, and attaining its fully developed form in the course of the fifth and sixth centuries ;
but unfavorably criticizes it, as did Al Biriini. The annals of China, a country never backward in claiming the invention of almost everything, new or old, on earth or in the sky, ascribe the formation of constellations to Tajao, the prime minister of Hwang Ti, 2637 B. c., and make much of an observation of the Pleiades, 2537 B. c., from an observatory said to have been erected 2608 B. c. But real stellar work in that country seems to have begun only about ten or twelve centuries before our era, and then almost solely in the interests of astrology. The attainment of the Chinese in the science, probably very highly overrated, however, is thought to be largely due to Chaldaea, and later on the Arabians, in the times of the khalifs, apparently exercised influence over them; while all their recent advance is due to the Jesuit missionaries who settled among them in the 16th century, during the early years of the present Tsing dynasty, and introduced the knowledge of our Western figures. These were thenceforward to a great extent adopted, and our own star-titles in the translations which the Chinese called Sze Kwo Ming, the Western Nation Xames, became common, especially in the case of the constellations visible only from south of the parallel of Peking, 40°. The indigenous titles were Chung Kwo Ming, the Middle Nation Names, Edkins saying as to these that there were two great periods of star-naming: the first about 2300 B. c. 1,y the people, and the second from 1120 to 220 B. c., during the Chow dynasty, that plainly shows an imperial origin. And it was during this period, about 600 B. c., that a chart was drawn with 1460 stars correctly laid down. This is now in the Royal Library of Paris. In all its history in China astronomy has been under the special care of the state, and the regulator of all affairs of life, public and private.
IAI Biruni mentioned this author as an excellent astronomer, and quoted much from his work the B!'U"'tsamhila, or Collection.

The early Chinese included the twenty-eight sinJ and the twelve k11ng, or zodiac figures, in four larger equal spaces,-Taing Lung, the Azure Dragon: Heung Woo, the Dark Warrior; Choo lleaou, the Red Bird, Phoenix. , Pheasant, or Quail; and Pih Hoo, the White Tiger. And they marked off. in their general constellations, three large yum, or inclosures,- Tae Wei, the circumpolar stars; Tien She and Tai Wei, containing the rest that were visible to them. Williams' Observations of Comets is accompanied by a full set of maps of 351 early asterisms traced over Flamsteed's figures; but, large as is this number, M. Gustave Schlegel, in his Uranographie Chinoise of 187 5, cited 670 that he asserted could be traced back to 17000 B. c. I In the neighboring Japan some, even of its wise men, thought that the stars were made to guide navigators of foreign peoples, with their tribute. to the land of the Mikados. Aethiopia's claim to the invention of the constellations probably can be entertained only by considering that country as the Kush of southwestern Asia, - Homer's eastern Aethiopia, - stretching along the Arabian and Persian gulfs, whence early migrations across the Red Sea at the Strait oi Babd al Mandab may have carried astronomical knowledge directly to the Nile, or, by a roundabout way, to Meroe in western Aethiopia, the modem Nubia, and thence northward into Egypt. Of Phoenician stellar science little is known, and assertions as to its antiquity rest largely upon the fact that this people was the great maritime nation of ancient times, and hence some knowledge of the heavenly bodies was a necessity with them. Yet Thales, the father of astronomy and a teacher of the Greeks in the science,-indeed one of their Seven Sages,probably was Phoenician by binh; and Samuel Bochart, the Oriental scholar of the 17th century, as well as other authorities, thought that many of our older groups in the sky are merely reproductions of the figureheads on the Carthaginian, Sidonian, and Tyrian ships; This, if correct, might account for the incompleteness of such as Argo, Pegasus, and Taurus, as well as for the marine character of many of them. But the general opinion is that the Phoenicians drew from Chaldaea such astronomy as they may have had. Ideler, in his Stemkunde der Chalt!aer of 1815, asserted that the constellations originated on the Euphrates, - "reduplications of simpler ideas connected with natural phenomena," -and conviction as to the truth oi this seems to be growing with students of stellar archaeology. Indeed recent discoveries make it apparently safe to say that those of the zodiac at least were first formed in the Akkad country, probably in almost prehistoric

times, and that there, as among all the earliest nations, " their order and harmony is contrasted with and opposed to the supposed disorderly motion of the planets." It is also probable that many of the extra-zodiacal groups, in somewhat the same form and location as we have them now, came from the Valley of the Great River, as well as the myths associated with them, originally introduced by Northem invaders; for Bailly said that the science current in Chaldaea, as well as in India and Persia, belonged to a latitude higher than that of Babylon, Benares, and Persepolis. With the Babylonians the chief stars represented their chief gods, and they connected the several constellations with particular nations over whose destiny they were thought to dominate. Cuneiform characters arranged in stellar form were the ideograph of ilu, Divinity; while, combining business and religion, their Ku-dur-ru, or Division Stones, recently unearthed, that marked the metes and bounds of city lots and farm lands, are often inscribed with some constellation figure, probably the one representing the tutelar god of the owner. But whatever may be our conclusions as to the beginning of astronomy in the Euphrates valley, it can be considered settled that astrology in the present sense of the word had its origin there, and that the modem astrological characters of the sun, moon, and planets are those current on that river and in all ages since. The prophet Isaiah, 700 B. c., in pronouncing the Almighty's judgment on Babylon, contemptuously referred to
the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators;
Daniel, a century later, knew his captors as accomplished in the art, although himself and his companions were " ten times better"; while the terms " Babylonians " and " Chaldaeans " have come down almost to our own time as synonymous with observers of, and diviners from, the stars, whatever their individual nationality. But the art became widely spread elsewhere, and especially in vogue in Rome, where its devote~s, known as Babylonii, Chaldaei, Astronomi, Astrologi, Genethliaci, Mathematici, and Planetarii, seem to have flourished notwithstanding the efforts made to suppress them and the ridicule cast on them by Cicero, Juvenal, and others of the time. Indeed they were driven out of the city by law in 139 B. c., and frequently afterward, but as often returned. In Greece, Eudoxos and Aristarchos of Samos felt it needful to urge their countrymen against it, although Berossos taught it there soon after them; and its influence everywhere up to two hundred years ago is well known. Dante's belief in it is frequently shown throughout the Divina Com111edia, while in Shakespeare's day- indeed for a century after him

reliance upon it was well-nigh universal, and much was made of it in all

Cecil, Baron of Burghley, calculated the nativity of Queen Elizabeth; Lilly was consulted by King Charles I, in 1647, as to his escape from Carisbrooke Castle; Flamsteed drew a horoscope of the heavens at the moment of laying the foundation of the Royal Observatory, on the 10th of August, 1675, although he added to it Risum lmealis amid; and about the same time astrologers were called into the councils of Parliament. The art still obtained even among the educated classes of the succeeding century ; for astrological evidence was received in a court of justice as late as 1758, and Sir Walter Scott made Guy Mannering cast a horoscope for the young laird of Ellangowan that the latter preserved till of mature age. It is not unlikely that the decadence of astrology in England was hastened by the publication of Boteler's Hudibras, in which the practice andit5 great exponent William Lilly, under the title Sidrophel, were so successfully and popularly satirized. Among its passages we read of its devotee:
in one case they tell more lies, In figures and nativities,
Than th' old Chaldean conjurors In so many hundred thousand years.
Dean Swift followed in the same vein in his .Predictums for tl,e year 17o8 ~• Isaac Bickent,,jf, Esq.
On the Continent astrology had been still more prevalent, and even men of science were seriously interested in it. Gassendi began his distinguished careerin its practice : Tycho predicted from the comet of 15 77, and, as it happened, successfully, the achie,·ements and time of death of Gustavu, Adolphus; the still greater Kepler prophesied from the stars a corning hard -.·inter, and so it pro,·ed. Miss ~laria ~litchell wrote ofthese two astronomers:

The horoscope of Wallenstein by one or the other of these great men is still preserved in the library of the Poulkowa Observatory. Napoleon's belief in his guiding star is well known. But as an occult science astrology practically died out in England with the astronomers of the 17th century. It still flourishes, however, in the East, especially among the Chinese and Parsis. The recent advent of a little son to the Chinese consul-general in New York was the occasion of much telegraphing to the chief astrologers of the Celestial Kingdom who were to predict his future; and the horoscope of the Parsi even now is carefully preserved during life, burned at his death, and its ashes scattered over the Sacred River. In a measure it lingers among the people everywhere, for its almanacs and periodicals are still published; its advertisements and signs are daily to be seen in our large cities ; a society for its study, called the Zodiac, was established in New York City in 1897; and even now there are many districts in Germany where the child's horoscope is regularly kept with the baptismal certificate in the family chest.
It should not be forgotten that astrology, Kepler's" foolish daughter of a wise mother," originally included astronomy, Seneca being the first in classical times to make distinction hetween the meanings of the two words; and be was followed in this by Saint Isidore of Seville (lsidorus Hispalensis), the Egregius Doctor of the 7th century, and author of the Origines
e, Etymologiae; although even as late as the 17th century we see confu
sion in their use, for Minsheu mentioned the" astrologers" as having formed the "asterismes," and the diarist John Evelyn wrote of "Mr. Flamsteed the learned astrologer." Contrariwise, and not long previously, the word "astronomer" was applied to those whom we would now call astrologers. Shakespeare devoted his 14/ii Sonnet to the subject, beginning thus:
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck, And yet methinks I have astronomy;
and in Troilus and Cressida we read
When he performs astronomers foretell it.
But this is a long digression from my subject. Arabia's part in early astronomy was slight, for although the tribes before Mul)ammad's day doubtless paid much attention to the heavenly bodies, this was entirely unscientific, merely observational and superstitious; and only in their subsequent days of peace and power, after the Prophet had

solidified them into an active nation, did their more cultured class seriously take up the study of the sky. Even this was solely along the lines laid down by Ptolemy, and they originated little. Still we owe them and their Jewish assistants much of gratitude for their preservation of the beginnings of modem astronomy during the thousand years of the Dark and Mediaeval Ages; while, as we have seen, our star-names are largely due to them. The heathen Arabs were star-worshipers,- Sabaeans,- as still are the Parsis of our own special star, the sun ; indeed this worship was very general in antiquity. It was universal in earliest India, and constantly alluded to in their sacred books; Egyptian priests showed to Plutarch stars that had been Isis and Osiris; in Greece Aristophanes made special mention of it in his Pax, 419 B. c., and Aristotle wrote to Alexander:
Heaven is full of the gods to whom we give the name of stars.
In Plato's Timaeus we read of his supreme divinity :
And after having thus framed the universe, he allotted to it souls equal in number to the stars, in~erting each in each. • • . And he declared also, that after living well for the time appointed to him, each one should once more return to the habitation of bis associate star, and spend a blessed and suitabl"! existence;
Dante adopting this in the ./tzradiso .

The Constellations
The Christian father Origen, following the supposed authority of the Book of Job, xxv, 5, and perhaps influenced by the 43d verse of chapter xiii of the Gospel of Saint Mat/hew, said that the stars themselves were living beings; and Dionysius Exiguus, the chronologist of our 6th century, established in the constellations the hierarchies of the genii, assigning to the cherubim the domain of the fixed stars. Shakespeare has many allusions to this stellar attribute. In King Henry VI, Bedford, invoking the ghost of Henry V, said
a far more glorious star thy soul will make Than Julius Caesar;
and in ./1⁄4rides we see
Heavens make a star of him.
Even now, according to Mr. Andrew Lang, German folk-lore asserts that when a child dies God makes a new star-a superstition also found in ~ew England fifty years or more ago. The German peasant tells his children that the stars are angels' eyes; and the English cottager impresses it on the youthful mind that it is wicked to point at the stars, though why he cannot tell. In much the same way Al Biruni cited from Vara.ha Mihira:
Comets are such beings as have been on account of their merits raised to heaven, whose period of dwelling in heaven has elapsed and who are then reclescending to the earth.
Cicero, in De Natura Deorum, asserted that the constellations were looked upon as divine; and Statius, that the sea nymphs were the constellations of the sea, the divine inhabitants of the waters, as the others were of the heavens. Yet this same author elsewhere represented Aurora as driving the stars out of heaven with a scourge like so many beasts; and Manilius called them a flock going on like sheep; while Shelley, in his .Promtfheus U116tJ11nd, writing of the astronomer's work, said :
Heaven's utmost deep Gives up her stars, and like a flock of sheep They pass before his eye, are number'd, and roll on.
In Upper India even now women teach their children that the stars are kine, and the moon their keeper. Following the opinion of Josephus, Origen said that the constellations were known long before the days of the patriarchs by Noah, Enoch, Seth, and Adam - indeed were mentioned in the Book of Enoch as " already named

and divided"; and he claimed that ancient longevity was a blessing specially bestowed to give opportunity for a long-continued period of observation and comparison of the heavenly bodies. In early Christian art a star became the peculiar emblem of sanctity, and often appeared over the heads or on the breasts of representations of the saints.

Some allusion should be made to what Smyth called the Biblical School and the Mosaicists, who at various times have sought to alter the sky figures to others drawn from sacred history and its interpretation. Beginning with the Vcnerable Bede, this school has come to our time, but their efforts, fortunately, have been in vain; for, although their motives may ha,·e been praiseworthy, our scheme of the heavenly groups is of too much historical value and too useful and interesting a source of popular instruction for us to wish it discarded. Among the number of these stellar iconoclasts was the unfortunate Giordano Bruno of the 16th century, who, in his Spaccio tie/la Bestia Trionfa11te, sought to substitute for the ancient figures the moral virtues, Law. Mercy, Prudence, Truth, Universal Judgment, Wisdom, etc.; and others, most numerous in the 17th century, were Caesius, Jeremias Drexelius, Novidius, Postellus, Bartsch, Schickard, Harsdorffer, and Julius Schiller of Augsburg; while in our day the Reverend Doctor John Lamb, the versifier of Aratos, and Proctor wrote in somewhat the same vein. The recent efforts of Miss Frances Rolleston and the Reverend Doctor Joseph A. Seiss are especially remarkable. Proctor made other changes in constellation titles, although he followed the old lines; but his changes have not been adopted, and, Chambers says," were far more barbarous than the originals which he condemned"; indeed in his later works he abandoned the effort as impracticable. The following remarks by Professor Holden on the history of the delineation of our stellar figures are interesting :
The contribution of Albrecht Diirer to astronomy is . • . unknown, I believe, to all his biographers.
But this statement he subsequently modified by a reference to Thausing's Life of Durer, in which this artist's map-work is mentioned:
Hipparchus (B. c. 127) and Ptolemy (A. D. 136) fixed the positions of stars by celestial latitudes and longitudes,and named the slars so fixed by describing their situation in some constellation figure. The celestial globes of that day have all disappeared, and we have only a few Arabian copies of them, not more ancient than the XI 11th century, so that ire



The Constellations
may say that the original constellation figures are entirely lost. The situations of the principal stars in each one of the forty-eight classic constellations are verhally described by Ptolemy. In La Lande's Bi6/iopupkie Aslronomique we find that in A. D. 1515 Albrecht T>iirer published two star-maps, one of each hemisphere, engraved on wood, in which the stars of Ptolemy were laid down by Heinfogel, a mathematician of Nuremberg. The stars themselves were connected by constellation figures drawn by Diirer. These constellation figures of Diirer, with but few changes, have been copied by Bayer in his Ura1U»netria (A. D. 16o3); by Flamsteed in the Atlas Codestis (1729); by Argelander in the Uranometrin NDVa (11!43); and by Heis in the Atlas Coelestis NDVus (1872), and have thus become classic. It is a matter of congratulation that designs which are destined to be so permanent should have come down to us from the hands ofso consummate a master.
I would add to this that Ptolemy's catalogue of stars was published at Cologne in 1537, in folio, with the forty-eight dr~wings by Diirer. It seems singular that of the world's artists few, save he and Raphael, have done anything for this most ancient, exalted, and interesting of the sciences; others, famous or forgotten, introduce the subject into their compositions with generally sad result.I One instance especially absurd, although not strictly astronomical, is worthy repetition. Mrs. Jameson, in her Sacred and Lege11dary Arl, describes, from an . old French print,
St. Denis at Heliopolis, seated on the summit of a tower or observatory, contemplating, through a telescope, the crucifixion of our Saviour seen in the far distance.
And much the same may be said of most of our authors. Pope thus mistranslated Homer's allusion to Sirius:
rises to the sight Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night;
Henry Kirk White, in Ti~, had
Orion in his Arctic tower ;
Shelley, in the Witch of Atlt1s, wrote of the minor planets as
those mysterious stars Which hide themselves between the earth and Mars;
and in Prince Atlzanase thus ignored the apparent motion of the stars:
far o'er southern waves immovably Belted Orion hangs;
Dickens, in Hard 'Ifmes, doing the same in his description of Stephen Black~ool's death, comforted the sufferer by a star shining brightly for

Carlyle, who at one time aspired to the position of astronomer at the Edinburgh University, thus alluded, in his French Revolqti,m, to the scenes in Paris on the night of the 9th of August, 1792 :

although the former did not rise till daybreak; and again, still more blunderingly :
Overhead, as always, the Great Bear is turning so quiet round Bootes;
while Dickens, in Our Mutual Friend, made perhaps the worst mistake of all when, in describing the voyage that "brought a baby Bella home," a revolution of the earth around the sun marks a month instead of a year. Wallace, in Ben Hur, makes the shaykh Ilderim give impossible starnames to th'e parents of his great team - Sirius, from the hated Roman tongue instead of the beautiful Al Shira of the Desert; and Mira, unknown to him, or indeed to any one, till nearly sixteen centuries thereafter; while the unlikely Greek Antares was given to one of the victorious four. Errors as to the moon and planets are notoriously frequent, Venus and the new moon often being made to rise at sunset. Shakespeare, although contemporary with Galileo and Kepler, has many such ; yet he seems to have known the action of the moon, his "governess of the floods," on the tides,1 for we find in Hamlet the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands;_
and in King Henry IV,
being governed as the sea is by the moon.
Marryat, sea-captain though he was, wrote of a waning crescent moon seen in the early evening; and H. Rider Haggard has something similar in King Solomon's Mines-a book, by the way, that was once ordered for the library of a school of mineralogy ! Charles Wolfe, in his Burial of Sir John Moore after the battle of Corunna, January 16, 1809, said that it was
By the struggling moonbeams' misty light,
1 Dante showed similar knowledge in Paradiso, xvi, 82, 83.

whereas the moon did not shine that night, whether misty or clear; and Coleridge, in the RiR1e of tlte Ancient Marirur, had
The horned moon with one bright star Within the nether tip.
The astronomy of the modern newspaper is notorious - ridiculous were not the fact of such prevalent ignorance lamentable. Classical writers abounded in stellar allusions far more than do authors of our day; in fact, Quintilian, of our 1st century, in his Institutio Oratoria, insisted that a knowledge of astronomy was absolutely necessary to a proper understanding of the poets. And these allusions generally were correct, at least for their day. The same may be said of Dante, whose thorough acquaintance with the stellar science of the 14th century appears everywhere in his works - in fact, the .Paradiso may be called a poetical frame for the Ptolemaic system ; and it has been well written of Milton, "the poetical historian of the astronomy of his day," that in astronomy the accuracy of his facts fairly divides the honors with the beauty of his language; but he slipped when he located Ophiuchus" in th' Arctic sky," and it is not till late in his works that we see the abandonment of Ptolemy's theories. Tennyson makes many beautiful allusions to stars and planets, and is always accurate, unless we except his" moonless Mars," which, however, was before Asaph Hall's discovery; while our Longfellow and Lowell knew the stars well, and well showed this in their works.

acter; but she seems to go far back of classical times, and we probably must look to the Euphrates for her origin, with that of her family and Cetus.
Sayce claims that she appeared in the great Babylonian Epic oL Cna/io11,
of more than two millenniums before our era, in connection wi¥the story of Bel :Marduk and the dragon Tiamat, that doubtless is the fo1mdation of the story of Perseus and Andromeda. She was noted, too, in ~hoenicia, where Chaldaean influence was early felL As a constellation these stars have always home our title, frequently v.ith 1 the added Kulier Catenata, the Woman Chained, and many of the classia.l , Latins alluded to her as familiar and a great favorite. Caesar Germanicus called her Virgo Dnota ; a scholiast, Penea, as the bride of Perseus ; while Manilius, and Germanicus again, had Cepheia, from her father. In some editions of the A!funsine TalJ/es and Almagest she is Alallae,
taken from the title of her star y; and Andromada, described as Mtdin f/lli non ridit maritum, evidently from Al Bin1ni, this reappearing in Bayer'• Carms Omnino viro. Ali Aben Reduan (Haly), the Latin translator of the Arabian commentary on the TetralJilJlos, had Amade, which in the Berlifl , Codex reads Anmade et est mu/in- fJUlle non luzkl iivu• maritu• ; these changed by manifold transcription from Alarmalah, the Widow, applied by the Arabians to Andromeda ; but the philologist Buttmann said from A.lllODeda, another erroneous form of our word. The Antamanla of the Hindus is their variation of the classical name. The original figure probably was, as Dilrer drew it, that of a young and beautiful woman bound to the rocks, Strabo said at lope, the biblical Joppa; and Josephus wrote that in his day the marks of her chains and the bones of her monster foe were still shown on that sea-shore. But this author, " who did not receive the Greek mythology, observes that these marks attest not the truth but the antiquity of the legend." Others, who very naturally thought her too far from home at that spat, located lope in Aethiopia and made her a negress ; Ovid expressing this in his patrilu fusca co/ore suae, although he followed Herodotus in referring her to India. :Manilius,1 on the contrary, in his version of the story described her as nirea cervice ~- but the Aethiopia of this legend probably was along the Red Sea in southwestern Arabia.
1 Manilius, author of the Podico11 As,,,,,__i£ml, frequently quoted throughout these pages, flourished under Augustus and Tiberius, and probably was the first Latin author to write al length on astronomy and astrology; but he adhered closely to Aratos' scheme of the constellations, making no mention of Berenice's Hair, Equuleus, or the Southern Crown. Tbe text, as we have it, is from a manuscript exhumed in the 15th century from an old German librarY by Poggius. the celebrated Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini, who rescued so much of onr classic literature from the dust of ages.

Arabian astronomers knew these stars as Al Iar'ah al •UD]u.Jah, their equivalent of the classical descriptive title,- Chilmead's Almara Alma111hala,- for Western mythological names had no place in their science, although they were: familiar with the ideas. But they represented a Sa. Calf, or Seal, Vitulus marinus catenatus, as Bayer Latinized it, with a chain around its neck that united it to one of the Fishes; their religious scruples Jeterring them from figuring the human form. Such images were prohibited by the .l{ur'an; and in the oral utterances attributed by tradition to the Prophet is this anathema:
Woe unto him who paints the likeness of a living thing: on the Day of Judgment those whom he ha.~ depicted will rise up out of the grave and ask him for their souls. Then, verily, unable to make the work of his hands live, will he be consumed in everlasting flames.
This still is the belief of the Muslim, for William Holman Hunt was warned of it, while painting his &ape Goal in the °i¥ilderness, by the shaykh under whose protection he was at the time. The Spanish edition of the Alfonsine Tables pictures Andromeda with an unfastened chain around her body, and two fishes, one on her bosom, the other at her feet, showing an early connection with Pisces; the Hyginus, printed at Venice anno salutifere im:arnationis, 7th of June, 1488, by Tltomas de /Jlauis de alexandria, with some most remarkable illustrations, has her standing between two trees, to which she is bound at the outstretched wrists ; in the Leyden Manuscript 1 !he is partly clothed on ·the sea beach, chained to rocks on either side. Caesius 2 said that she represented the biblical Abigail of The Books of Samuel; and Julius Schiller, in 1627, made of her stars Sepulchrum Chrilti,3 the ''new Sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid."
I The figures in this old manuscript are spirited, many of them beautiful, and all studded ,.ith ,tars, but with no attempt at orderly arrangement; and, although in perfect preservation, high antiquity has been claimed for them as of ancient Roman times. Hugo Grotius reproduced them in his SynlaK""4 Araleon1m, and the Manusrri/t is stlll preserved in the University Library at Leyden. aine work of Caesius (Philip Zesen), the Coe/um Aslro11ot11ico-Poeti&um, published by Joannes Blaeu at Amsterdam in 1662, is much quoted by I.a Lande, and is a most interesting ~,urce of information as to star-names and the mythology of the constellations, with many extracts from Greek and Roman authors. He mentions sixty-four figures, but some of his ,tar-tilles, as also perhaps those of other astronomical writers, would seem merely to be synonyms for the human originals erroneously assumed as for their sky namesakes. 1This appeared in the Coe/um Ste/Jalum Cltristianum, wbich, according to its title-page, was the joint production of Schiller and Bayer, an enlarged reprint of the Ura11ot11elria of 16o3; and Gould says that it was in reality the 2d edition of Bayer's work, almost ready for the press at th• latter's death in 16c15, but appropriated by Schiller to embody his own absurd constellation changes.

34 Star-Names and their Meanings
The apparently universal impulse of star-gazers to find earthly objects in the heavens is shown in the Cross which is claimed for some of Andromeda's stars; (3, y, and o marking the upright, a and " the transverse. But
a much more noticeable group, an immense Dipper, is readily seen in following up its y and (3 to the Square of Pegasus, far surpassing, in extent at least, the better-known pair of Dippers around the pole. Andromeda is bounded on the north by Cassiopeia and Perseus; on the east by Perseus; on the south by Pisces and Triangulum ; and on the west by Lacerta and Pegasus. Milton's passage in .Paradise Lost, where Satan surveys our world
from eastern point Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears Andromeda far off Atlantic seas Beyond th' Horizon,
seems to have puzzled many; but the poet was only seeking to show the comprehen~ve view had by the arch-fiend east and west through the six signs of the zodiac from the Scales to the Ram with the golden fleece; Andromeda, above the latter, apparently being borne on by him to the westward, and so, to an observer from England, over the Atlantic. Kingsley's Andromeda well describes her place:
I set thee High for a star in the heavens, a sign and a hope for the seamen, Spreading thy long whi,,te arms all night in the heights of the aether, Hard by thy sire and the hero, thy spouse, while near thee lhy mother Sits in her ivory chair, as she plaits ambrosial tresses; All night long thou wilt shine;
these members of the royal family, Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Cepheus. and Perseus, lying contiguous to each other, wholly or partly in the Milky Way. The stars that mark her right arm may be seen stretching from a to I and " ; , marking the left arm with the end of the chain towards Lacerta; but in early days she was somewhat differently located, and even till recently there has been confusion here; for Smyth wrote:
1''1amsteed's Nos. 51 and 54 Andromedae are ,i, and v Persei, though placed exactly where Ptolemy wished them to be- on the lady's foot: so also a in this asterism has been lettered ,1 Pl"gasi by Bayer, and ,J has been the lucida of the Xorthern Fish.

Alpherats, Alpherat, and Sirrah are from the Arabians' Al Surrat al P'araa, the Horse's Navel, as this star formerly was associated with Pegasus, whence it was transferred to the Woman's hair; and some one has strangely called it Umbilicua Andromedae. But in all late Arabian astronomy taken from Ptolemy it was de!>cribed as Al B.il al )[ar'ah al Kuaallalah, the Head of the Woman in Chains. Aratos designated it as ~vv6,; afTT~p, i. e., common to both constellations, and it is still retained in Pegasus as tht: d of that figure, although not in general use by astronomers. In England, two centuries ago, it was familiarly known as Andromeda'■ Head.
With {3 Cassiopeiae and y Pegasi, as the Three Guide■, it marks the equinoctial colure, the prime meridian of the heavens; and, with y Pegasi, the eastern side of the Great Square of Pegasus. In the Hindu lunar zodiac this star, with a, {J, and y Pegasi,-the Great Square,-constituted the double nakshatra,-the 24th and 25th,-Piirva and Uttara Bhidrapadi■, the Former and the Latter Beautiful, or Auspicious, Feet; also given as Pro■hthapadi■, Footstool Feet; whi_le Professor Weber of Berlin says that it. was Prap■hthana, a Stand or Support, which the four bright stars may represent. With y Pegasi, the determinant star, it formed the 25th sieu Pi, or Peih, a Wall or Partition, anciently Lek, and the manzil Al Fargu, from Al Farigh al Mu'ah·h·ar, the Hindmost Loiterer; or, perhaps more correctly, the Hind Spout of the Water-jar, for Kazwini called it Al Farigh al Thi.ni, the Second Spout; a Well-mouth and its accompaniments being imagined here by the early Arabs. The Persian title for this lunlu station, Kiyan; the Sogdian, Bar Far■hat; the Khorasmian, Wabir; and the Coptic, Artulo■ia, all have somewhat similar meanings.

Kiraoh was described in the Alfonsine Tables of 1521 as super miral, from which has been derived its present title, as well as the occasional fonns Iino, Kerach, Kirar, Iirath, Jfiraz, etc. ; mirat probably coming from the 1515 Almagest's super mizar, the Arabic mi'zar, a girdle or waist-doth. Scaliger, the great critical scholar of the 15th century, adopted this J[izar as a title, and Riccioli followed him in its use, thus confounding the star with { Ursae Majoris. The Kirae of Smyth doubtless is a typographical error. although Mirae had appeared in Chilmead's Treatise 1 of 1639 for the same word applied to /j Ursae Majoris. Hipparchos seems to refer to it in his {wv11; and, synonymously, some have termed it Oingulum; others, Ventrale, from its former position in the figure, although now it is on the left hip. In later Arabian astronomy it marked the right side of Andromeda, and so was known as Al lanb al J[uull&'lah, the Side of the Chained Woman. {J appeared in very early • drawings as the ludda of the northern of the two Fishes, and marked the
26th manzil Al BatJi al ]Jiit, the Belly of the Fish, or Al '8,Ib al ]Jit, the Heart of the Fish; and the corresponding siet, Goei, or Kwei, the Man Striding, or the Striding Legs, anciently ][wet. In this location it was Al Rialli, the Band, Cord, Ribbon, or Thread, as being on the line uniting the Fishes; but this title now belongs to n. Piscium.
Brown includes it, with v, If>, and x Piscium, in the Coptic lunar station Kuton, the Thread; and Renouf, in Arlt, an asterism indigenous to Egypt. It lies midway between a. and y, about 15° distant from each; and in astrology was a fortunate star, portending renown and good luck in matrimony.

Ulug Beg, a century and a half previously, as well as Al Tizini 1 and the Arabic globes before him, gave it the animal's title in full. But the propriety of such a designation here is not obvious in connection with Andromeda, and would indicate that it belonged to very early Arab astronomy. Bayer said of it,perperam AJbamM, 'lD erroneous form of some of the foregoing. Riccioli 2 also mentioned this name, but only to repudiate it. Mu!]ammad al Achsasi 3 al Muwakkit designated y as AI H·imis al l'a'imit, his editor translating this Quinta Slrulhionum, the 5th one of the Ostriches; but I have not elsewhere seen the association of these birds with this constellation. Hyde gives another Arabian designation for y as Al B.ijl al Jl'ualnJab, the Woman's Foot. ln the astronomy of China this star, with others in Andromeda and in Triangulum, was Tien Ta T1eang, Heaven's Great General. Astrologically it was honorable and eminent. Its duplicity was discovered by Johann Tobias Mayer of Gottingen in 1778; and Wilhelm Struve,' in October, 1842, found that its companion was closely double, less than 1" apart at a position angle of 100°, and probably binary. The two larger components are 10".4 apart with a position
1 The catalogue of ibis author, Mui)ammid abu Bekr al Tizini al Muwakkit, was published at Damascus in 1533 with ;JD stars, and from its long list of purely Arabic star-names was
regarded as worthy oftranslation and republication by Hyde, in 1665, with the original text. The •IITIJd.Uu of his title indicates that he was shaykh of the grand mosque. 2 This last author, to whom I shall make frequent reference, was Joanne Baptista Riccioli, ot the Society of Jesus, whose Altatqrsl11t11 N""""' of 1651 and Aslrrwunr,ia Reftm11ala of 1665 were famous in their day, and are interesting in ours, as preserving to us much of the queer mediaeval stellar nomenclature, as well as of the general astronomical knowledge of the times.

He is noted, too, as having drawn for his Al-rest the 2d map of the moon,-Hevelius preceding him in this by four yearJ,-and as having given the various names to its various features, more than two hundl'l!d of tbese being still in use, while all but six of those given by his justly more celebrated conieruporary have been discarded. His lunar titles naturally were Jesuitical; nor was he overmodest, for his own name appears first in the list, and that of his colleague Grimaldi immediately succeeding. 1The Arabic manuscript or this author, with its star-list or about the year 1650, has been reviewed by Mr. E. B. Knobel in the Mo11lluy Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society for
June, 1895. It contains n2 stars, perhaps taken from Al Tizini's catalogue of the preceding century. The Achsasi of his title was from the village of similar name in the Fayiim, doubtless his binhplace; and, like Tizini, he was shaykh of the grand mosque in Cairo, where his •·ork was wril ten. 1S1ruve was the first director of the Russian National Observatory at Poulkowa, where he •as succeeded by bis son Otto; and two of the grandson• bear names already celebrated in astronomy. 3•

angle ·of 630.3. The contrast in their colors is extraordinarily fine. Sir William Herschel wrote of it in 1804:
This double Star is one of the most beautiful Objects in the Heavens. The striking difl"erence in the colour of the two Stars suggests the idea ofa Sun and its Planet, to which the contra.~t of their unequal size contributes not a little; but Webb thought them stationary.
It is readily resolved by a 2}(.-inch glass with a power of forty diameters, ~nd it seems singular that its double character was not sooner discovered From its vicinity radiate the Andromedes II, the Bielid meteors of November, so wonderfully displayed on the 27th of that month in 1872 and 1885, and on the 23d in 1892, and identified by Secchi and others with the celebrated comet discovered by Biela in 1826, which, on its return in 1832, almost created a panic in France. The stream completes three revolutions in about twenty years, although subject to great perturbations from Jupiter, and doubtless was that noticed on the 7th of December, 1798, and in 1838. These objects move in the same direction as the earth, and so with apparent slowness,- about ten miles a second,- leaving small trains of reddishyellow sparks. The radiant, lying northeast from y, is remarkable for its extent, being from 7 to 10 degrees in diameter. The Mazapil iron meteorite which fell in northern Mexico on the 27th of November, 1886, has been claimed "as being really a piece of Biela's comet itself."

Halley, however, did so claim it in 1661 in favor of Bullialdus (Ismail Bouillaud), who, although he doubtless again brought it into notice as the ne/Julosa in cingulo Andromedae, expressly mentioned that it had been observed 150 years previously by some anonymous but expert astronomer. Hevelius catalogued it in his .Prodromus, and Flamsteed inserted it in his Historia as ne/Julosa supra dngulum and nebuwsa dnguli; but Hipparchos, Ptolemy, Ulug Beg, Tycho Brahe, and Bayer did not allude to it, from which some have inferred an increase, or variability, in its light; but there is no positive evidence as to this, and it does not seem probable. Marius said that it resembled the diluted light from the flame of a candle seen through horn,• while others of our early astronomers described it differently; discordances probably owing to the different means employed.

After his day it seems unnoticed till Mercator put it on his celestial globe of 1551 with six components; Bayer following him in illustrating it with Aquila, although with no distinct list of its stars. Tycho also utilized it ; but it first separately appeared in print on a plate in Kepler's Stella N11·va of 1606, and in his .Rud11lphine Tables. Longomontanus (Christian Longberg of Denmark) had it in his Aslr11ntJmica Danica of 1640; Hevelius included it in the .Prodro111us, but added a Bow and Arrow, the ancient Sagitta; Flamsteed mentioned it in the Hislflria Codes/is as Aquila Antinou, Aquila vel Antinoua, and- Aquila cum Antinoo i and the Hungarian Jesuit Abbe Maximilian Hell had it in constant use in his Ephemerides AslrontJ1nicae of 1769 and 1770. Bode also distinctly catalogued and illustrated it; but Argelander omitted its title from his UrantJmelria Nova of 1843, although he showed it as a part of Aquila. It is now hardly recognized, its stars being included with those of the latter constellation. Bayer substituted Ganymedel for Antinoiis, and others have used both names indiscriminately; Tennyson describing the youth as
Flush'd Ganymede, his rosy thigh Half buried in the Eagle's down.
This same name occasionally has appeared for Aquarius, but is given by La Lande, with many other titles, for our Antinoiis; among these are Pu.er Adrianaeua, Bithymcu, Phrygiu, and TroiC'lll; 11'0V111 Aegypti Deus; Pu.er Aquilae; Pinoerna and Pocillator, the Cup-bearer.
Caesius saw in it the Bon of the S:hun&mmite raised to life uy the prophet Elisha; and La Lande said that some had identified it with the bold Ithacan, one of Penelope's suitors slain by Ulixes.

Simone Assemani said that they were Alkhalimain, that more correctly is Al a.Jilain, the Two Friends, or Al ]Jalimatain, the Two Papillae; but his assertions as to star-names are often unfavorably criticized by Ideler as" a confused medley, raked together without criticism." These globes are so frequently referred to as indicative of the character and progress of the astronomy of Arabia, that I may be pardoned a brief digression as to them.

of comparatively small dimensions, five to eight inches in diameter, a great I
contrast to the six-foot globe of Tycho Brahe, now in the castle at Prague. Those of Mercator were about sixteen inches. But celestial globes were known long anterior to these. One that is considered very correct as to the location of the early constellations, although it does not show the individual stars, is in the Farnese collection of antiquities, surmounting the statue of Atlas. This globe, supposed to be a copy of the sphere of Eudoxos, and perhaps antedating Ptolemy, although somewhat defaced, has preserved to us more than forty of the sky figures of its day; while another, of brass, said to have been constructed by Ptolemy himself,- doubtless an apocryphal statement,- was found in 1043 in an old public library in Kahira, the modern Cairo. Ptolemy described the globe of Hipparchos that is illustrated in Halma's edition of the Syntaxis, published with a French translation in Paris in 1813-16; Eudoxos is said to have constructed one 366 B. c., as did Anaximander of Miletus 584 B. c. The actual invention of celestial globes has been credited to Thales, as the mythical was to Atlas; but Flammarion nearly rivals this last when he seriously tells us of Chiron's sphere - "the most ancient sphere known, constructed about the epoch of the Trojan War, 1300 B. c."; and Sir Isaac Newton, induced by an incorrect translation from Diogenes Laertius, asserted that Musaeus, one of the Argo's crew, was the first to make a celestial sphere, on which he located the ship and many others of the Greek constellations derived from the story and characters of the Argonauts.

The Constellations 43
The constellation lies just south of Crater and Hydra, bordering on the Vela of Argo along the branches of the Milky Way, and culminates on the 6th of April ; Gould assigning to it eighty-five naked-eye stars. He thinks that a, the red ludda, may be a variable, as his observers had variously noted it as of from the 4th to the 5th magnitude, and Argelander entered both of these. La Caine's 13 lies within the present limits of Hydra. Although inconspicuous, and without any named star, Antlia is of special interest to astronomers from containing the noted variable 1 S, discovered in 1888 by Paul of Washington, and confirmed by Sawyer. Chandler gives its maximum as 6.7 and its minimum as 7.3, the period being 7 hours, 46 minutes, 48 seconds,- the shortest known until it was supplanted by
U Pegasi with a period of s1⁄4 hours.

Its avian original is found only in the Papuan Islands, and the title is from •Arrovr, Without Feet, for the ancient Greek swallow, but well applied to this bird that has been thus fabled, as witness Keats' " legless birds of paradise," in his E1•e of Saini Mark. Bayer strangely had it Apia lndioa on his planisphere of the new southern figures, where the typical bird is shown, as also in the corresponding page of text; but the universal consent as to the name Apu, or Avis, and its appearance as Apu lndica and lndianischer Vogel in the abridged German edition of Bayer's work issued in 1720, with the fact that he had another, and correct, Apis, would indicate a typographical and engraver's error in the original; but I have not seen this alluded to till now. The drawing always has been of the typical bird of our title, which Caesius adopted in his Paradilaeus Alea; but it sometimes is Avis lndica, the Indian Bird.

44 Star-Names and their Meanings
Theplani.,;phere in Gore's English edition of Flammarion's Aslr01Ul#liePo)lllaire has the constellation as the Home Swallow, probably taken from early ornithological lists or the lexicons; for our Andrews-Freund translates Ap,u as the Black Martin, the English synonym of the Hirundo apus ofLinnaeus,the Cypselus apus of William Yarrell,- not a swallow, however, but a wellknown swift of the Old World, with perfectly formed, although small, legs and feet, yet appropriate enough to its mode of life ; and the stellar bird ' appears in Willis' Sdwlar of Tltekl .Bm Khora/ as
Hirundo with its little company; 1• And white-brow'd Vesta lamping on her path Lonely and planet-calm;
with this explanatory note:
An Arabic constellation placed instead or the Piscis Australis, because the swallow arrives in Arabia a'bout the time or the heliacal rising or the Fishes.
I have not met with these hirundine star-titles except in these two instances, and think them both incorrect. Mr. Willis' idea may have come from the XeluJ611ta~ of the zodiacal pair, but he errs in ascribing the figure to Arabia and in considering it a substitute for the Southern Fish, as well as in confusing it with the older Pisces. But all this poem is beautiful in stellar allusions. Here is another bit:
Where has the Pleiad gone ? Where have all missing stars found light and home? Who bids the Stella Mira go and come? Why sits the Pole-star lone? And why, like banded sisters, through the air Go in bright troops the constellations fair?
Apus similarly appears in China as E Cho, the Curious Sparrow; and as the Little Wonder Bird. Schiller included it with the Chamaeleon and the Southern Fly in his biblical Eve. Gould details sixty-seven naked-eye stars in Apus, its lucida, y, being 3.9. It culminates about the middle of July, but of course is invisible from northern latitudes. This is one of the twelve new southern constellations with which Bayer's name generally is associated, although he only adopted them and, Gould says, took them from one of the globes of Jacob, or Arnold, Florent van Langren; but Bayer distinctly attributed their formation to" Americus Vesputius, Andreas Corsalius, Petrus Medinensis and Petrus Theodorus," navigators of the early part of the 16th century, giving to the last most of the credit of their publication; and Smyth ascribed their invention to "Peter Theodore,"

and their publication to another sailor, Andrea Corsali, in 1516. In Chilmead's Treatise they are indefinitely ascribed to" the Portugals, Hollanders, and English sea-faring mm."
\Villem Jansson Blaeu, the celebrated globe-maker of Amsterdam, Chilmead's contemporary, credited their introduction to Friedrich Houtmann, who observed from the island of Sumatra; while the latter, Semler asserted, took his ideas from the Chinese. Although Ideler denied this, yet he acknowledged that the latter nation knew Phoenix, Indus, and Apus as the Fire Bird, the Persian and the Little Wonder Bird, almost exact translations of the Western titles; and summed up his account of them with the opm1on that their origin "is involved in an obscurity that it is scarcely possible to penetrate."

il Aquario in Italy, le Veneau in France, der Wauermann in Germany, has universally home this or kindred titles; ldeler assigning as a reason the fact that the sun passed through it during the rainy season. In connection with this the proximity of other analogous stellar forms is worthy of note: Capricornus, Cetus, Delphinus, Eridanus, Hydra, Pisces, and Piscis Australis, all the watery shapes in the early heavens, with Argo and Crater, are in this neighborhood; some of whose stars Aratos said "are called the Water"; indeed in Euphratean astronomy this region of the sky was the Sea, and thought to be under the control of Aquarius. The constellation immemorially has been represented, even on very early Babylonian stones, as a man, or boy, pouring water from a bucket or um, with an appropriate towel in the left hand, the human figure sometimes being omitted; while the Arabians, who knew of the latter but did not dare to show it, depicted a mule carrying two water-barrels; and a~ain simply a water-bucket. This last was Ulug Beg's idea of it, his original word being rendered by Hyde Situla, the Roman Well-bucket; but Al Biruni had it in his astrological charts as Amphora, a Two-handled Wine

jar, that he may have adopted from Ausonius the poet of our 4th century. Even Vercingetorix, Caesar's foe in Gaul, 52 B. c., is said to have put the similar figure on his stateres with the title Diot&, a Two-eared Jar. On a· Roman zodiac it was a Peaoock, the symbol of Juno, the Greek Here, in whose month Gamelion-January-February-the sun was in the sign; and at times it has been shown as a Gooae, another bird sacred to that goddess. New Testament Christians of the 16th and 17th centuries likened it appropriately enough to John the Baptilt, and to Judu Thadclaeu the Apostle, although some went back to ll'aaman in the waters of Jordan, and even to KOIMII taken out of the water. Its nomenclature has been extensive but consistent. In Greek literature it was 'l'dpo,t6~, the epic 'Ydpoxoev~, or Water-pourer, transliterated by Catullus as Hydrochoiil, and by Germanicus as Hydrochotie ; although the latter also called it Aquitenena and l"undena laticea, saying that it personified Deucalion of the Greek Deluge, 1500 B. c. Ausonius had Umam qui , tenet; Manilius, Aequoreu Juvenia, or simply Juvenia, and Ganymedel. the beautiful Phrygian boy, son of Tros and cup-bearer of Jove, of whom Statius wrote in his Tlzebais :
Then from the chase Jovc's towering eagle bears, On golden wings, the Phrygian to the stars.
This title also appeared with Cicero, H yginus, and Vergil; and with Ovid, in the Fasti, as Ganymede Juvenia, Puer ldaeu, ancl lliacu1, from his birthplace, and Juvenia gerena aquam; while in a larger sense it was said to represent the creator Jove, the pourer forth of water upon the earth. We find it, too, as Ariltaeu, their Elijah, who brought rain to the inhabitants of Ceos, and Oeoropa, from the cicada nourished by the dew. whose eggs were hatched by the showers; while Appian, the historian of our 2d century, called it Hydridul'UI, which reappeared in the 1515 A/,na. gest as Idrud1ll'UI and Hauritor aquae. The great Grecian lyric poet Pinclar asserted that it symbolized the genius of the fountains of the Nile, the life-giving waters of the earth. Horace added to its modem title Ty· rannu1 aquae, writing of it as "saddening the inverted year," which James Thomson, 1700-1748, followed in the Winter of his Seasuns:
fierce Aquarius stains th' inverted year;
and Vergil, calling it frigidus, similarly said that when coincident with the sun it closed the year with moisture : •
Extremoque inrorat Aquarius anno.



The Constellations 47
In Babylonia it was associated with the 11th month Shabatu, the Curse of Rain, January-February; and the Epic of Creation has an account of the Deluge in its nth book, corresponding to this the 11th constellation; each of its other books numerically coinciding with the other zodiacal signs. In that country its Urn seems to have been known as Gu, a Water-jar overflowing, the Akkadian Ku-ur-ku, the Seat of the Flowing Waters_: and it also was Ramm.in or Rammin1\, the God of the Storm, the still earlier Imma, shown pouring water from a vase, the god, however, frequently being omitted. Some assert that Lord of Cana.la is the signification of the Akkadian word for Aquarius, given to it 15,000 years ago(!), when the sun entered it and the Nile flood was at its height. And while this statement carries the beginnings of astronomy very much farther back than has generally been supposed, or will now be acknowledged, yet for many years we have seen Egyptian and Euphratean history continuously extended into the hitherto dim past; and this theory would easily solve the much discussed question of the origin of the zodiac figures if we are to regard either of those countries as their source, and the seasons and agricultural operations as giving them names. Aben Ezra called it the Egyptians' Koniu, from their muau, or Mw, Water; Kircher said that it was their Tm:vlJip,av, Brachium bmejicum, the Place of Good Fortune; which Brown, however, limits to its stars a, y, ,;, and 1/ as a Coptic lunar station; and our Serviss writes that " the ancient Egyptians imagined that the setting of Aquarius caused the rising of the ~ile, as he sank his huge urn in the river to fill it." With the Arabians it was Al Dalw, the Well-bucket; and Kazwini's Al Bikib al Ki', the Water-pourer; from the first of which came the Edeleu of Bayer, and the Eldelil of Chilmead. The Persians knew it as Dol or Di1; the Hebrews, as Deli (Riccioli's Delle); the Syrians, as Daulo, like the Latin Dolium; and the Turks, as Xugha,-all meaning a Waterbucket. In the Persian Bunddiesh it is Vabik. In China, with Capricornus, Pisces, and a part of Sagittarius, it constituted the early Serpent, or Turtle, Tien Yuen; and later was known as Hiaen Ying, the Dark Warrior and Hero, or Darkly Flourishing One, the Blaen Wu, or Hiuen Heaou, of the Han dynasty, which Dupuis gave as Hiven Iao. It was a symbol of the emperor Tchoun Hin, in whose reign was a great deluge; but after the Jesuits came in it became Paou Ping, the Precious Vase. It contained three of the sieu, and headed the list of zodiac signs as the Rat, which in the far East was the ideograph for" water," and still so remains in the almanacs of Central Asia, Cochin China, and Japan. Some of the minor stars of Aquarius,-i, A, 11, and q:,,-with others of

Capricomus and Pisces, formed the asterism Luy Peih Chin, the Camp with Intrenched Walls. On the Ganges, as in China, it began the circle of the zodiacal signs; and Al Biruni said that at one time in India it was Khumba, or ][umbaba, which recalls the Elamite divinity of that name, the K6μ/J11, or Storm God, of Hesychios. This, too, was the Tamil title for it; La Lande writing it Coumbum. Vara.ha Mihira, under the influence of Greek astronomy, called it Hridroga and Udruvaga, in which we can see 'Tdpox~With the Magi and Druids it represented the whole science of astronomy. The Anglo-Saxons called it 18 Waeter-gyt, the Water-pourer; while not long after them John of Trevisa, the English translator, in 1398 thus quaintly recalled the classical form:
The Sygne Aquarius is the butlere of the goddes and yevyth them a water-potte.
English books immediately succeeding had .Aquary, .Aquarye, and, still later, the queer title S.ldnker. This last, which has puzzled more than one commentator, is found in the rare book of 1703, Meteorologiae by Mr. C(J{k, Philomathemat.:
Jupiter in the Skinker opposed by Saturn in the Lion did raise mighty South-west winds.
But the passage affords its own explanation that ought not to have been delayed till now; for we know our sign to be the opposite of Leo, while the dictionaries tell us that this archaic or provincial word signifies a Tapster, or Pourer-out of liquor, which Aquarius and Ganymede have notably been in all ages of astronomy. Although early authors varied in their ascription of the twelve zodiacal constellations to the twelve tribes of Israel, yet they generally were in accord in assigning this to Reuben, "unstable as water." But the fountainheads of all this Jewish banner story, Jacob's death-bed address to his sons in Egypt, and Moses' dying song on Mount Nebo, are not clear enough to justify much positiveness as to the proper assignment of any of the tribal symbols, if indeed the Israelites had any at all. The little that we have on the subject is from Josephus and the Cha/dee Paraphrase. Dante, in the 19th canto of II Purgatorio, wrote that here
geomancers their Fortuna Major See in the Orient before the dawn kise by a path that long remains not dim;
which Longfellow explains in his notes on the passage:
Geomancy is divination by points in the ground, or pebbles arranged in certain figures, which have peculiar names. Among these is the figure called the Fortuna Major, which

is thllS draW'D, : : and, by an effort of the imagination, can also be formed out of some of the last stars •: • in Aquarius and some of the first in Pisces.
In astrology it was the Airy Ti'igon, Gemini and Libra being incluqed, and
a sign of no small note, since there was no disputing that its stars possessed influence, ,-irtue, and efficacy, whereby they altered the air and seasons "in a wonderful,strange, and secret manner";
and an illuminated manuscript almanac of 1386, perhaps the earliest in our language that has been printed, says of the sign: "It is gode to byg castellis, and to wed, and lat blode." With Capricorn it was the Ho1118 of Saturn, governing the legs and ankles; and when on the horizon with the sun the weather was always rainy. When Saturn was here, he had man completely in his clutches -caput et rol/um; while Jupiter, when here, had humeros, frclus etJetles.
As J'unonil aatrum it was a diurnal sign, Juno and Jove being its guardians, and bore rule over Cilicia and Tyre; later, over Arabia, Tatary, Denmark, Russia, Lower Sweden, Westphalia, Bremen, and Hamburg. Proctor's Myths and Man•ds of Astronomy has a list of the astrological colors of the zodiac signs attributing to Aquarius an aqueous blue; while Lucius Ampelius, of our 2d century, assigning in his Liber Memorialis the care of the various winds to the various signs, intrusts to this the guardianship of Eurus and Notus, which blew from the east, or southeast, and from the south. The astronomers' symbol for the sign, : , showing undulating lines of waves, is said to have been the hieroglyph for Water, the title of Aquarius in the Nile country, where a measuring-rod may have been associated with it; indeed Burritt drew such in the hand of the figure as liorma. llilotica, a suggestion of the ancient Nilometer. Brown, in the 47th volume of Archaeologia, has these interesting remarks on the symbols of the signs :
Respecting these Mr. C. W. King observes: "Although the planets are often expressed by their emblems, yet neither they nor the signs are ever to be seen represented on antique works by those symbols so familiar to the eye in our almanacs. Wherever such occur upon a stone it may be pronounced without any hesitation a production of the cinque-cento, or the following century. . . . As for the source of these hieroglyphics, I have never been able to trace it. They are to be found exactly as we see them in very old medieval MSS."; and Mr. King is inclined, in default of any other origin," to suspect they were devised by Arab sages "-an opinion which I do not follow. The subject is certainly shrouded in great obscurity; and even Professor Sayce recently informed me that he had been unable to trace the history of the zodiacal symbols up to their first appearance in Western literature. 4

While Miss Clerke writes that they are found in manuscripts of about the 10th century, but in carvings not until the 15th or 16th. Their origin is unknown; but some, if not all, of them have antique associations. Hargrave's Rosicrucians has an illustration of an object showing an Egyptian cross and disk with our present symbols of Leo and Virgo, or Scorpio, purporting to be from the breast of a mummy in the museum of the London University. If this statement be correct, a much earlier origin can be claimed for these symbols 1 than has hitherto been supposed. From his researches into the archaic astronomical symbolism on classic coins, monuments, etc., Thompson concludes that the great bas-relief of the Asiatic Cybele, now in the Hermitage Museum at Saint Petersburg, was designed to represent the ancient tropics of Aquarius and Leo; and that Aquarius, Aquila,-or more probably the other Vultur, our Lyra,-Leo, and Taurus appear in the familiar imagery of Ezekiel i, 10, and x, 14, and of The Rez•elation iv, 7.
Aquarius is not conspicuous, being chiefly marked by the stars y, ;, f/, and rr,-the Urn, the familiar Y,-called by the Greeks KdA1r17, KaAm~, Kd}.. m:ir, and Situla, or Urna, by the Latins, Pliny making a distinct constellation of the latter; and by the line of fainter stars, ;.,, tf>, X, tp, i.1, and others indicating the water running down into the mouth of the Southern Fish, or, as it is occasionally drawn, uniting with the river Eridanus. Spence, commenting on this figure on the Farnese globe and its description by Manilius, Ad juvmem, aeternas jundentem Piscibus undas, and Fundentis semper Aquarii, wrote:
Ganymedes, the cup-bearer of Jupiter. He holds the cup or little urn in his hand, inclined downwards; and is al ways pouring out of it: as indeed he ought to be, to be able from so small a source to form that river, which you see running from his feet, and making so large a tour over all this part of the globe.
Manilius ended his lines on Aquarius with Sic prefluit urna, which Spence translated " And so the urn flows on "; adding :
which seems to have been a proverbial expression among the antients, taken from the ceaseless Bowing of this urn; and which might be not ina!Jplicable now, when certain ladies are telling a story; or certain lawyers are pleading.
Geminos, in his 'Et11ayw)1ti, about 77 B. c., made a separate constellation of this stream as Xv111~ vda,Of, the Pouring Forth of Water; but Aratos also had called it this as well as the Water, although in the latter he included /3 Ceti and the star Fomalhaut. Cicero gave it as Aqua.; and the

scholiast on Gennanicus, as Jffl'uio aquae; while Efruaor and Fuaor aquae were common titles. The modern Burritt has Fluvius Aquarii and Cascade. The stars marking the ribs of the figure in this constellation are, in some maps, mingled with c and others in Capricorn. Although of astronomical importance chiefly from its zodiacal position and from its richness in doubles, clusters, and nebulae, it also is interesting
from the fact that one of its three stars ,p was occulted by the planet Mars on the 1st of October, 1672. Thisoccultation was predicted by Flamsteed, and, on his suggestion, observed and verified in France and by Richer at Cayenne; and the several independently accordant results are considered reliable,although made more than two centuries ago. These have enabled our modem astronomers, especially Leverrier, accurately to ascertain the mean motion of Mars, and materially aid them in calculating the mass of the earth and our distance from the sun. Aquarius lies between Capricornus and Pisces, the sun entering it on the 14th of February, and leaving it on the 14th of March. Argelander catalogues here 97 naked-eye stars; Reis, 146. La Lande, citing Firmicus and the Egyptian sphere of Petosiris,1 wrote

Badalmelik is from the Arabic Al Sa.'d a.I Ka.lik, the Lucky One of the King, sometimes given as Al Sa.'d al Kulk, the Lucky One of the Kingdom, under which last title Kazwini and Ulug Beg combined it with o.

The Rucbah of the Century CyckJpedia is erroneous for this star - indeed was intended for a Sagittarii. Sadalmelik lies on the right shoulder of the figure, 10 south of the celestial equator; and has a distant 11th-magnitude gray companion.

But as this word Ah'biyah is merely the plural of H ·iba', a Tent, a more reasonable explanation is that the star was so called from its rising in the spring twilight, when, after the winter's want and suffering, the nomads' tents were raised on the freshening pastures, and the pleasant weather set in. This idea renders Professor Whitney's" Felicity ofTents" a happy translation of the original. .;, 7/, and 'II' are included with y under this designation by Ulug Beg - .;, in the centre, marking the top of the tent; Kazwini, however, considered this central star as Al Sa.'d, and the three surrounding ones his tents.

It was near y that the Capuchin friar of Cologne, Schyraelus de Rheita,1 in 1643, thought. that he had found five new satellites attendant upon Jupiter, which he named Stellae Urbani Octavi in compliment to the reigning pontiff; and a treatise, De novem Ste/lae circa Jovem, was written by Lobkowitz upon this wonderful discovery. "The planet, however, soon deserted his companions, and the stars proved to be the little group in front of the Um." a, 3.4,

But Hyde, probably following Grotius, said that it was from Al Sa'd of the preceding stars. On the Euphrates it seems to have been associated with Hasisadra or Xasisadra, the 10th antediluvian king and hero of the Deluge; while, with ,l, K, and others adjacent, it was the lunar station Apill, the Channel, and individually the Star of the Foundation. The corresponding stations, Kha.tar in Persia, ShaWlhat in Sogdiana, and Xalhtawand in Khorasmia, were also determined by this star.

The corresponding lieu, Ito, ltu, Biu, Bi, or Woo lieu, a Woman, anciently written llok, was composed of these stars with the addition of another, unidentified, r being the determinant; and the same three were the Euphratean lunar asterism ltunaxa, the Goat-fish, and the Coptic trpeuritoa, the Discoverer. Bayer mentioned for it ltantellum and ltantile, marking the Napkin or Towel held in the youth's hand; but in some early drawings this was shown as a Bunob of Grain Staib.
Grotius had Ancha and Pyxia, but neither appropriate; while in our day the former is applied only to fJ, and the latter is never seen as a stellar title except in La Caille's Pyxis Nautica in Argo. Eastward from t., near v, is the Saturn llebula, N. G. C. 7009, that the largest telescopes show somewhat like the planet.

Although unnamed, this is an interesting star at the centre of the Y of the Urn, and almost exactly on the celestial equator. Mayer discovered its duplicity in 1777, and its binary character, first noted by Herschel in 1804, was confirmed by his son in 18:u; but the period is not yet determined, although it is very long. The components are 3".3 apart, and the position angle 322°.

Bitula is applied to this, from the classical Latin term for a Water-jar or -bucket, the later Arabian word being the somewhat similar Satl, and the earlier Al Dalw. · Gassendi, however, derived it from sitis, thirst, the Waterman's Um having been figured by some as an Oven! Theon the Younger, father of the celebrated Hypatia of our 5th century, termed this star 'Otvo,toEia, the Outpouring of Wine, as if by Ganymede; and others, KdA-~1J, and Uma, the southern edge of which, near the outflow, it marks.

Sundry other four or five small stars in Aquarius were given by Reeves as Poo Yue, the Headsman's Ax.

the Milky Way; its southern stars constituting the now discarded Antinoiis. Early representations added an arrow held in the Eagle's talons; and HeveIius included a bow and arrow in his description ; but on the Heis map the Youth is held ·by Aquila, for the Germans still continue this association in their combined title cler Adler mit dam A.ntinoiia.
Our constellation is supposed to be represented by the bird figured on a Euphratean uranographic stone of about 1:zoo B. c., and known on the tablets as Idxu 9;amarna, the Eagle, the Living Eye.
It always was known as Aquila by the Latins, and by their poets as lma
A.lei and 1ovia Jfutris, the Bird, and the Nurse, of Jove ; lovia Armiger and .Armiger Alea, the Armor-bearing Bird of Jove in this god's conflict
with the giants; while GanJJD8d• B&ptris and Servan■ A.ntinoiim are from the old stories that the Eagle carried Ganymede to the heavens and stood in attendance on Jove. Ovid made it J[erop1, King of Cos, turned into the Eagle of the sky; but others thought it some Aethiopian king like Cepheus, and with the same heavenly reward. As the eagles often were confounded with the vultures in Greek and Roman ornithology, at least in nomenclature, Aquila also was Vulblr volam, the stars {3 and y, on either side of a, marking the outstretched wings; this title appearing even as late as Flamsteed's day, and its translation, the Flying Grype, becoming the Old English name, especially with the astrologers, who ascribed to it mighty virtue. 'AeT~, the Eagle, in a much varied orthography, was used for our constellation by all the Greeks; while poetically it was .ii6r "Opi•ir, the Hird of Zeus; and Pindar had 'Oivwv BaotAevr, the King of Birds, which, ornithologically, has come to our day. Later on it was B1:foai•or, Baoavto/l~, and Baoa1•t11T~fl10V, all kindred titles signifying Torture, referred by Hyde to the story of the eagle which preyed on the liver of Prometheus. Similarly we find Aquila Promethei and Tortor Prornethei; but Ideler said that this idea came from a confounding by Scaliger of the Arabic' Ikab; Torture, and 'O}fab, Eagle. Dupuis fancifully thought that its name was given when it was near the summer solstice, and that the bird of highest flight was chosen to express the greatest elevation of the sun ; and he asserted that the famous three Stymphalian Birds of mythology were represented by Aquila, Cygnus, and Vultur cadens, our Lyra, still located together in the sky; the argument being that these are all paranatellons of Sagittarius, which is the fifth in the line of zodiacal constellations beginning with Leo, the Nemean lion, the object of Hacules' first labor, while the slaying of the birds was the fifth. Appropriately enough, like so much other stellar material, these creatures

came from Arabia, migrating thence either to the Insula Martis, or to Lake Stymphalis, where Hercules encountered them. Thompson thinks that the fable, in Greek ornithology, of the eagle attacking the swan, but defeated by it, is symbolical of" Aquila, which rises in the East, immediately after Cygnus, but, setting in the West, goes down a little while before that more northern constellation." A similar thought was in the ancient mind as to the eagle in opposition to th~ dolphin and the serpent; their stellar counterparts, Aquila, Delphinus, and Serpens, also being thus relatively situated. In connection with the story of Ganymede, the eagle appeared on coins of Chalcis, Dardanos, and Ilia; and generally on those of Mallos in Cilicia and of Camarina; while it is shown perched on the Dolphin on coins of Sinope and other towns, chiefly along the Black Sea and Hellespont. One, bearing the prominent Stars, was struck in Rome, 94 B. c., by Manius Aquilius Nepos,1 the design being evidently inspired by his name; and a coin of Agrigentum bears Aquila, with Cancer on the reverse,-the one setting as the other rises. To the Arabians the classical figure became Al •O~b, probably their Black Eagle, Chilmead citing this as Alhhakhab ; while their Al ll'qr al 'rair, the Flying Eagle, was confined to a, /3, and y; although this was contrary to their custom of using only one star for a sky figure. Grotius called the whole Altair and Aloair; Bayer said Alcar and Atair. Al Achsasi, however, mentioned it as Al Ghurib, the Crow, or Raven, probably a late Arabian name, and the only instance that I have seen of its application to the stars of our Aquila. Persian titles were Alub, Ghergea, and Shahin tara zed, the Star-striking Falcon of Al Na~r al Din, but now divided for /3 and y. In the Illdtanian
Ta/Jiu, as perhaps elsewhere, it was rv,p 1rer61'evo(', the Flying Vulture; the Turks call it Tauhaugjil, their Hunting Eagle ;-all these for the three bright stars. The Hebrews knew it as ll'eahr, an Eagle, Falcon, or Vulture; and the Cha/dee .Paraphrase asserted that it was figured on the banners of Dan; but as these tribal symbols properly were for the zodiac, Scorpio usually was ascribed to Dan. This confusion may have originated from the fact, asserted by Sir William Drummond, that in Abraham's day Scorpio was figured as an Eagle. Caesius said that Aquila represented the Eagle of military Rome, or the Eagle of Saint 1ohn; but Julius Schiller had already made it Saint Catherine the Jh.rtyr; and Erhard Weigel, a

professor at Jena in the 17th century, started a new set of constellations, based on the heraldry then so much in vogue, among which was the llrudenburg Eagle, made up from Aquila, Antinoiis, and the Dolphin. Hevelius said that the stellar Eagle was a fitting representation of that bird on the Polish and Teutonic coats of arms. The Chinese have here the Draught Oxen, mentioned in the book of odes entith:d She King, compiled 500 years before Christ by K'ung fu tsu, Kung the Philosopher (Confucius),-the passage being rendered by the Reverend Doctor James Legge :
Brilliant show the Draught Oxen, But they do not serve to draw our carts;
and the three bright stars are their Cowherd, for whom the Magpies' Bridge gives access to the Spinning Damael, our Lyra, across the River of the Sky, the Milky Way. This story appears in various forms; stars in the Swan sometimes being substituted for those in the Eagle, Lyra becoming the Weaving Biaten.
The Korean version, with more detail, turns the Cowherd into a Prince, and the Spinster into his Bride, both banished to different parts of the sky by the irate father-in-law, but with the privilege of an annual meeting if they can cross the River. This they accomplish through the friendly aid of the good-natured magpies, who congregate from all parts of the kingdom dur- 1 ing the 7th moon, and on its 7th night form the fluttering bridge across which the couple meet, lovers still, although married. When the day is over they return for another year to their respective places of exile, and the bridge breaks up ; the birds scattering to their various homes with bare heads, the feathers having been worn off by the trampling feet of the Prince and his retinue. But as all this happens during the birds' moulting-time, ' the bare heads are not to be wondered at; nor, as it is the rainy season, the attendant showers which, if occurring in the morning, the story-tellers attribute to the tears of the couple in the joy of meeting; or if in the evening, to those ofsorrow at parting. Should a magpie anywhere be found loitering around home at this time, it is pursued by the children with well-merited illtreatment for its selfish indifference to its duty. Nor must I forget to mention that the trouble in the royal household originated from the Prince's unfortunate investment of the paternal sapekes in a very promising scheme to tap the Milky Way and divert the fluid to nourish distant stars. Another version is given by the Reverend Doctor William Elliot Griffis in his Japanese Fairy World, where the Spinning Damsel is the industrious princess Shokujo, separated by the Heavenly River from her herd-boy lover,

Kinjin. But here the narrator makes Capricorn and the star Wega represent the lovers. The native Australians knew the whole of Aquila as Totyarguil, one oftheir mythical personages, who, while bathing, was killed by a kelpie; their stellar Eagle being Sirius. It was in the stars of our constellation, to the northwest of Altair, that Professor Edward E. Barnard discovered a comet from its trail on a photograph taken at the Lick Observatory on the 12th of October, 1892-the first ever found by the camera. Argelander catalogued 82 naked-eye stars in Aquila, including those of Antinoiis; Heis gives 123.
rJ., 1.3, pale yellow.
Altair is from a part of the Arabic name for the constellation; but occasionally is written Althair, Athair, Attair, and Atair; this last readers of Rm Hur will remember as the name of one of the shaykh Ilderim's horses in the chariot race at Antioch. And the word has been altered to Alcair, Alchayr, and Alcar.
In the Syn/axis it was 'At:r~, one of Ptolemy's few stellar titles, probably first applied to a, and after the formation of the figure transferred to the latter, as in other instances in the early days of astronomy. Even six or seven centuries before Ptolemy it was referred to as 'Att:r6r where the chorus in the 'Piju~, until recently attributed to Euripides, says:
What is the star now passing? the answer being:
The Pleiades show themselves in the east, The Eagle soars in the summit of heaven.
It is supposed that long antecedent to this it was the Euphratean Idxu, the Eagle, or Brigu, the Powerful Bird, inscriptions to this effect being quoted by Brown, who thinks that it also was the Persian Kuru, the Bird; the Sogdian Shad Kuhir, and the Khorasmian Sadmuij, the Noble Falcon. In Mr. J. F. Hewitt's Essays on the .Ruling .Races of .Prehistoric Times it h asserted that later Zend mythology knew Altair as Vanant, the Western Quarter of the heavens, which earlier had been marked by our Corvus. With {J and y it constituted the twenty-first nakshatra Qrava.na, the Ear, and probably was at first so drawn, although also known as Qrona, Lame, or as Aqvattba, the Sacred Fig Tree, Vishnu being regent of the asterism; these stars representing the Three Footsteps with which that god strode through the heavens, a Trident being the symbol.

In China a, {3, and y were Ho ][oo, a River Drum. In astrology Altair was a mischief-maker, and portended danger from reptiles. Ptolemy, who designated the degrees of star brilliancy by Greek letters. applied {3 to this as being of the 2d magnitude, whence some think that it has increased in light since his day. It is now the standard 1st magnitude according to the Pogson, or "absolute," photometric scale generally adopted by workers in stellar photometry, and is largely used in determining lunar distances at sea; while Flamsteed made it the fundamental reference star in his observations on the sun and in the construction of his catalogue. Its parallax,1 o".214, considered by Elkin as nearly or quite exact, indi
cates a distance of about 15 t light years. Its spectrum is of Pickering's class Xb of Secchi's first type, but peculiar. with very hazy solar lines between the broad hydrogen lines. Altair has the large proper motion of 0 11.65 annually; and Gould thought it slightly variable. It marks the junction of the right wing with the body, and rises at sunset about the 15th of June, culminating on the 1st of September. Near it appeared, in A. n. 389, an object, whether a temporary star or a comet is not now known, said by Cuspinianus to have equaled Venus in brilliancy, which vanished after three weeks' visibility; and there is record of another, of sixty years previous, in this constellation. 50 to the ea!>tward of Altair, according to Denning, lies the radiant point of the Aquilida, the meteor stream Yisible from the 7th of June to the 12th of August. ~' 3.9, pale orange.
A.lahain is from Shahin, a portion of the Persian name for the constellation; but Al Achsasi termed it Al Unu~ al Ghurib, the Ra\·en's Neck. It is the southern of the two stars flanking Altair; yet, although it bears the second letter, is not as bright as y or d.

Tarazed, or Taruad, from the same Persian title, lies north of Altair. These three stars constitute the Family of Aquila, the line joining them being 5° in length.

But no star thus far in,·estigatcd has so large a parallax; that of the nearest, a Centauri, being only o".75.

and in classical times was intimately associated with Centaurus and Lupus. which it joined on the west before Norma was formed. The Latins knew it under our title, often designated as Ara Centauri, Ara ThJIID&Dl&tia, and as Thymele, the altar of Dionysus; and occasionall~in the diminutive Arula. It also was Alta.re, A.pt.a A.ltaria, Alt.aria; Saararium and Saoria; Acerra, the small altar on which perfumes were burned before the dead ; Batillu, an Incense Pan; Prunanm. Conoeptan· lum, a Brazier; Focu, Lar, and Ignitabulum, all meaning a Hearth; and 'Em·ia, or Veda, the goddess of the hearth.
ThJlribulum and Turribulum, a Censer, more correctly TuribulllDl, were customary titles down to the 18th century. Pharu also appears, altars often being placed upon the summits of temple towers and thus serving the ancients as lighthouses, of which th( Alexandrian Pharos was the great example. The Alfonsine Tables added to some of these titles Puteu, a Pit; Ila· crariu, and Templum, a Sacred Place; but represented it as a typical altar. The .uytlm ,Vanuscript made it a tripod censer with incense burning; the illustrated editions of Hj,ginus of 1488 and 1535, an altar from which flames ascend, with demons on either side; and an illustrated Gennan manuscript of the 15th century showed the Pit with big demons thrusting little ones into the abyss. This recalls the story of Jove's punishment of the defeated giants after he had, as Manilius wrote,
Rais'd this Altar, and the Form appears With Incense loaded, and adom'd with Stars;
the occasion being the war with the Titans, when the gods needed an altar in heaven for their mutual vows. That poet also described it as
ara ferens turris, stellis imitantibus ignem,
which would show that the flame was concei,·ed of as rising northward~ through the ~lilky Way, or that the latter itself was the smoke and flame; and it was so thought of and represented by the ancients, and down to the times of Arabic globes and ~liddle Age manuscripts. But from Bayer's day to ours it has been shown in an im·erted position, which for a southern c-onstellation is ,tppropriate.

plant was burned. Eratosthenes had Ni«-:-ap ~ 8vr~ptov, which Ideler and Schaubach, however, did not understand, and thought a corrupted reading. Its varied classical names show disagreement as to its form, yet great familiarity with its stars, on the part of early observers, with whom it was of importance as portending changes in the winds and weather; Aratos devoting twenty-eight lines -a large proportionate space-of the Phainomena to this character of Ara. In Arabia it was Al ](ijmarah, a Censer, which, being its only title in that country, implies that it was unformed there before the introduction of Greek astronomy. Derivations from this word are found in the Almegramith of Riccioli and the Almugamra of Caesius. This last author said that Ara represented one of the altars raiaed by K0888, or the permanent golden one in the Temple at Jerusalem ; but others of the biblical school considered it the Altar of Ioah erected after the Deluge. Euphratean research seems to show a stellar Altar differently located, which Brown says p;obably was the lost zodiacal sign subsequently represented by the Claws and afterwards by the Balance; and identifies it with the 7th Akkadian month and sign Tul-Ku, the Holy Altar, or the Illustrious Mound, perhaps a reference to the mound-altar of the Tower of Babel. • When these changes were accomplished this early zodiacal Altar was removed to its present position, and its diversified altar-censer form retained from the Euphratean figuring. This recollection of the first Altar will perhaps account for the otherwise strange prominence given in classical times to our visually unimportant Ara, when Manilius called it llundi Templum; this last word also having another stellar signification, for Varro used it to indicate a division of the sky. Other details of this early Euphratean Altar are noted under Libra. Ara is not wholly visible now north of the 23d degree of latitude; and its brief period above the horizon - only about four hours - explains Aratos' allusion in our motto; his horizon being about the same as that of the city of New York. Gould catalogues in it eighty-five stars, from 2.8 to the 7th magnitude; but none seem to be named except in China. There a, 2.9 magnitude, was Choo, a Club or Staff; and with (3, '}', and t, Low, Trailing. With fJ it marks the top of the Altar's frame, culminating, on the 24th of July, just above the horizon in the latitude of New York,-400 42' 43" at the City Hall. Bayer's map carries the latter star several degrees too far to the southwest; similar errors being found in others of his constellation figures of the southern heavens.

The centrt: culminates on the 1st of March. La Caille used for it nearly 180 letters, many of them of course duplicated, so that although this notation was adopted in the British Associatio11 Catalogue, recent astronomers have subdivided the figure for convenience in reference, and now know its three divisions as Carina, the Keel, with 268 stars, Puppia, the Stern, with 313, and Vela, the Sail, with 248. This last is the German Segel. La Caille, moreover, formed from stars in the early subordinate division )[alll8, the Mast, Pyxis 1'autica, the Nautical Box or Mariner's Compass, the German See Compau, the French Boll880le or Compaa de )[er, and the Italian Buaola; and this is still recognized by some good astronomers as

From other stars Bode formed Lochium Fun.ii, his Logleine, our Log and Line, now entirely fallen into disuse. The Ship appears to have no bow, thus presenting the same sectional character noticeable in Equuleus, Pegasus, and Taurus, and generally is so shown on the maps. It was in reference to this that Aratos wrote :
Sternforward Argo by the Grtal Dog's tail Is drawn; for hers is not a usual course, But backward turned she comes, as vessels do When sailors have transposed the crooked stern On entering harbour; all the ship reverse, And gliding backward on the beach it grounds. Sternforwarrl thus is Jason's Arg-o drawn.
This loss of its bow is said to have occurred
when Argo pass'd Through Bosporus betwixt the jostling rocks
the Symplegades, the Cyanean (azure), or the Planctae Rocks at the mouth of the Euxine Sea. Yet Aratos may have thought it complete, for he wrote: All Argo stands aloft in sky, and
Part moves dim and starless from the prow Up to the mast, but all the rest is bright ;
and it has often been so illustrated and described by artists and authors. The Alfonsine Tables show it as a complete double-masted vessel with oars, and Lubienitzki, in the Tluatrun, Cometicu,n of 1667, as a three-masted argosy with a tier of ports and all sails set full to the wind. llythology insisted that it was built by Glaucus, or by Argos, for Jason, leader of the fifty Argonauts, whose number equaled that of the oars of the lbip, aided by Pallas Athene, who herself set in the prow a piece from the ,pea.king oak of Dodona; the Argo being " thus endowed with the power of warning and guiding the chieftains who form its crew." She carried the famous expedition from Iolchis in Thessaly to Aea in Colchis,1 in search of :he golden fleece, and when the voyage was over Athene placed the boat
In the sky. Another Greek tradition, according to Eratosthenes, asserted that our constellation represented the first ship to sail the ocean, which long before

Jason's time carried Danaos with his fifty daughters from Egypt to Rhodes and Argos, and, as Dante wrote,
Startled Neptune with the aid of Argo.
Egyptian story said that it was the ark that bore Isis and Osiris over the Deluge; while the Hindus thought that it performed the same office for their equivalent Isi and Iswara. And their prehistoric tradition made it the ship Argha for their wandering sun, steered by Agastya, the star Canopus. In this Sanskrit argha we perhaps may see our title; but Lindsay derives Argo from arek, a Semitic word, used by the Phoenicians, signifying "long," this vessel having been the first large one launched. Sir Isaac Newton devoted much attention to the famous craft, fixing the date of its building about 936 B. c., forty-two years after King Solomon. With the Romans it always was Argo and Navis, Vitruvius writing NaviI quae n:nni11atur Argo; but Cicero called it Argolica llavil and Argoliea Puppia; Germanicus, Argoa. Puppia; Propertius, the elegiac poet of the 1st century before our era, laaonia Carina; Ovid, Pagasaea Carina and Pa· gaaaea Puppil, from the Thessalian seaport where it was built; Manilius, Batis Heroum, the Heroes' Raft,
which now midst Stars doth sail;
and others, llavil J'aaonil, or Oairidi1, Celox laaonia, Carina Argoa, Argo Batis, and llavigium PraedatorillJD, the Pirate Ship. While somewhat similar are Curru Karil, the Sea Chariot, the Currua Volitan1 of Catullus, who said that in Egypt it had been the Vehioulum Lunae. It also was Equu■ lleptuniu■ ; indeed Ptolemy asserted that it was known as a Hone by the inhabitants of Azania, the modem Ajan, on the nonheastem coast of Africa, south of Cape Gardafui. The Arabians called it Al Safinah, a Ship, and ][arkab, something to ride upon, that two or three centuries ago in Europe were transcribed Al■ephina and Kerkeb.
Grotius mentioned Cautel as a title for Puppis, "from the Tables," but he added Hoc quid sit nescio.
The biblical school of course called it 1'oah11 Ark, the Arcia lloachi, or Archa lloae as Bayer wrote it; Jacob Bryant, the English mythologist of the last century, making its story another form of that of Noah. Indeed in the 17th century the Ark seems to have been its popular title. In Hewitt's Essays we find a reference to "the four stars which marked the four quarters of the heavens in the Zendavesta, the four Loka-palas, or nourishers of the world," of the Hindus; and that author claims these for

Sirius in the east, the seven stars of the Greater Bear in the north, Corvus in the west, and Argo in the south. He gives the latter's title as Bata
Vaesa, the One Hundred Creators; all these imagined as forming a great
cross in the sky. The differing Persian conception of this appears in the remarks on Regulus,- a Leonis. The Chinese asterism Tien Keaou probably was formed from some components of Argo. The constellation is noticeable in lower latitudes not only from its great extent and the splendor of Canopus, but also from possessing the remarkable variable 'I'/ and its inclosing nebula. Near the stars' Carinae appeared, between March 5 and April 8, 1895, a 1un1a with a spectrum similar to those of the recent novae in Auriga and Norma.

Kavw(Jor, in the early orthography of the Greeks, apparently was first given to this star by Eratosthenes, but KavWTl'Of later on by Hipparchos. Ptolemy used the former word, among his few star-names, which Halley and Flamsteed transcribed into Canob111; but now it universally is Canop111, Al Sufi's translator having Kanup111 as an Arabian adaptation of the Greek. Aratos, Eudoxos, and Hipparchos also, designated it as II11dai.tov, the Rudder, Cicero's GubernaculUJD, Aratos writing:
The slackened rudder has been placed beneath The hind-feet of the Dog.
Ancient ships had a rudder on each side of the stem, in one of which our star generally was figured, thus differing from the modem maps that locate it in the bank of oars. Strabo, the geographer of the century preceding our era, said that its title was "but of yesterday," which may have been true of the word that we now know it by; but an Egyptian priestly poet of the time of Thothmes III - 1500 years before Strabo -wrote of it as Xarbana,
the star Which pours his light in a glance of fire, When he disperses the morning dew ;

and this still was seen a millennium later in the Xabarnit of As-sur-ba-ni-pal's time. Our name for it is that of the chief pilot of the fleet of Menelaos, who, on his return from the destruction of Troy, 1183 B. c., touched at Egypt, where, twelve miles to the northeastward from Alexandria, Canopus died and was honored, according to Scylax, by a monument raised by his grateful master, giving his name to the city 1 and to this splendid star, which at
that time rose about 13⁄4 0 above that horizon. The foregoing derivation of the word Canopus is an early and popular one; but another, perhaps as old, and more probable, being on the authority of Aristides, is from the Coptic, or Egyptian, Kahi :Sub, Golden Earth. Ideler, coinciding in this, claimed these words as also the source of other titles for Canopus, the Arabic Wun, Weight, and ~&4&r, Ground; and of the occasional later Ponderona and Terreatria. Although I find no reason assigned for the appropriateness of these names, it is easy to infer that they may come from the magnitude of the star and its nearness to the horizon; this last certainly made it the TTEpiyEt~ of Eratosthenes. Similarly the universal Arabic title was Suhail, written by Western nations Suhel, Suhil, Suhilon, Bohayl, Sohel, Bohil, and Boheil, 8a.hil, Bihel, and Bihil; all taken, according to Buttmann, from Al Sahl, the Plain. This word also was a personal title in Arabia, and, Delitzsch says, the symbol of what is brilliant, glorious, and beautiful, and even now among the nomads is thus applied to a handsome person. Our word Canopus itself apparently had a somewhat similar use among early writers; for Eden translated from Vespucci's account of his third voyage and Of th Pok A nlartike and the Starres abowt the Same:
Amonge other, I sawe three starres cauled Canopi, wherof two were exceadynge cleare, and the thyrde sumwhat darke;
and again, after describing the " foure starres abowte the pole" :

1 Ancient Canopus is now in ruins, but its site is occupied by the village of Al Bekur, or Aboukir, famous from Lord Nelson's Battle of the Nile, August 1, 1198, and from Napoleon's victory over the Turks a year afterwards; and it is interesting to remember that it was here, from the terraced walls of the Serapeum, the temple of Serapis, that Ptolemy made his observations. Serapis was the title of the great Osiris of Egypt as god of the lower world; his incarnation as god of the upper world being in the bull Apis.

these Clouds that the Canopus of Vespucci would seem to refer in much of his description. But I have never seen any explanation of this title as used by him, and Vespucci's fame certainly does not rest upon his knowledge of the skies. The great New English Dictio11a,y erroneously quotes some of the foregoing as being references to our a Carinae, strangely ignoring this different use of the star's title. Among the Persians Suhail is a synonym of wisdom, seen in the wellknown Al AnwA.r i Suhaili, the Lights of Canopus. A note to Humboldt's Cosmos tells us that this name was given to other stars in Argo, and Hyde asserted the same as to its use for stars in neighboring constellations. Thus he found Suhel Alfard, Suhel Aldabaran, and Suhel Sirius; in fact this last star, Karsten Niebuhr 1 said, was commonly known thus in Arabia a century and more ago. The AljunsiN Tables had Suhel pondero1u, that appeared in a contemporary chronicle as Sihil ponderoaa, a translation of Al Suhail al Wun. In the 1515 Almagest it was Subhel; and in the Gnuco-Persian Tables of Chrysococca (the 14th-century Greek astronomer, author, and physician resident in Persia), edited by Bullialdus in his Astronomia Plzilolaica, it was ~oall laμavij. This was from the Arabs' Al Suhail al Yamaniyyah, the Suhail of the Soμth, or perhaps an allusion to the old story, told in connection with our Procyon, that Suhail, formerl) located near Orion's stars, the feminine Al Jauzah, had to flee to the south after his marriage to her, where he still remains. Others said that Suhail only went a-wooing of Al Jauzah, who not only refused him, but very unceremoniously kicked him to the southern heavens. Another occasional early title was Al F~, the Camel Stallion. Allusions to it in every age indicate that everywhere it was an important star, especially on the Desert. There it was a great favorite, giving rise to many of the proverbs of the Arabs, their stories and superstitions, and supposed to impart the much prized color to their precious stones, and immunity from disease. Its heliacal rising, even now used in computing their year, ripened their fruits, ended the hot term of the summer, and set the time for the weaning of their young camels, thus alluded to by Thomas Moore in his Evenings in Greece :
A camel slept - young as if wean'd When last the star Canopus rose.
And in a general way it served them as a southern pole-star.
I This Niebuhr was the noted Danish traveler in the East between 1761 and 1767, and ·subsequently the father of the great historian. His discoveries at Persepolis gave the clue to the deciphrnnent of cuneiform inscriptions.

It was worshiped by the tribe of Tai, as it probably still is by the wilder of the Badawiyy ; and in this connection Carlyle wrote of it in his Heroes and Hero Worship :
Canopus shining-down over the desert, with its blue diamond brightness (that wild, blK. spirit-like brightness far brighter than we ever witness here), would pierce into the heart of the wild Ishmaelitish man, whom it was guiding through the solitary waste then. To
his wild heart, with all feelings in it, with no s,,«cA for any feeling, it might seem a little eyr, that Canopus, glancing-out on him from the great, deep Eternity; revealing the inner splendour to him. Cannot we understand how these men 7Dt1nAipped Canopus; became what we call S.beans. worshipping the stars ? • • • To us also, through every star, through every blade of grass, is not a God made visible, if we will open our minds and eyes? We do not worship in that way now: but is it not reckoned still a merit, proof of what we call a "poetic nature," that we recognize how every object has a divine beauty in it; how every object still verily is " a window through which we may look into lnfinitnde itself" ?
Moore wrote of it in Lalla RtJOH .
The Star of Egypt, whose proud light, Never hath beam'd on those who rest In the White Islands of the West;
again alluding to it, in the same poem, as the cause of the unfailing cheerfulness of the Zingians.1 And, as the constellation was associated on the Nile with the great god Osiris, so its great star became the Sm of Oairia ; but, later on, Capella and the scholiast on Germanicus called it J»tole,gllflml and PtoJ......., in honor of Egypt's great king Ptolemy Lagos; and at times it has been S.bilon, but the appropriateness of this I have been unable to verify. The ~-:r,).~. cited by Hyde as from Kircher, and so presumably Coptic, is equally unintelligible. While all this knowledge of Canopus is ancient, it seems " but of yester· day" when we consider the star's history in worship on the Nile. Lockyer tells us of a series of temples at Edfii, Philae, Amada, and Semneh, so oriented at their erection, 6400 B. c., as to show Canopus heralding the sunrise at the autumnal equinox, when it was known as the symbol of Khons, or K.honsu, the first southern star-god; and of other similar temples later. At least two of the great structures at Karnak, of 2100 and 1700 e. c., respectively, pointed to its setting; as did another at Naga, and the temple of K.hons at Thebes, built by Rameses III about 1300 B. c., aften·ards restored and en·

larged under the Ptolemies. It thus probably was the prominent object in the religion of Southern Egypt, where it represented the god of the waters. Some of the Rabbis have asserted-and Delitzsch in modem times that this star, and not Orion, was the H·qil of the Bible, arguing from the similarity in sound of that word to the Suhail of Arabia, and from other reasons fully explained, although not accepted, by Ideler; while, coincidently, there are able commentators who have thought that the Kesilim of Isaiah xiii, 10, now translated "Constellations," means the brightest stars, which often are those now referred to in the use of the word Suhail. Delitzsch, in his commentary on the B()()k of Job, quotes much, from Wetzstein and others, of this identity of Canopus with H·asil, illustrating it with stellar stories and proverbs of the present-day Arabs of the Haman, the patriarch's traditional home. The Hindus called it Agutya, one of their Rishis, or inspired sages,and helmsman of their Argha,-a son of Varuna, the goddess of the waters; and Sanskrit literature has many allusions to its heliacal rising in connection with certain religious ceremonies. In the Avesta it is mentioned as "pushing the waters forward "-governing the tides(?). The late George Bertin identified it with Sugi, the Euphratean Chariot Yoke; but others claim that title for some stars in the zodiac as yet perhaps unascertained, but probably the luddne of Libra. In China it was Laou J'in, the Old Man, and an object of worship down to at least I oo B. c. Since the 6th century it has been the Star of Saint Catharine, appearing to the Greek and Russian pilgrim devotees as they approached her convent and shrine at Sinai, on their way from Gaza, their landing-place. In early German astronomical books it was the Sohif-ttem, or Ship-star. With Achernar and Fomalhaut, corresponding stars in Eridanus and Piscis Australis, it made up the Tre Facelle of Dante's .Purgatorio, symbolizing Faith, Hope, and Charity,

Manilius poetically followed in his path by using it, with the Bear, to prove the spbericity of the earth. The confusion in the titles of Canopus and Coma Berenices is noted under that constellation. Lying 52° 38' south of the celestial equator, about 35° below Sirius, this star is invisible to observers north of the 37th parallel; but there it is just above the horizon at nine o'clock in the evening of the 6th of February, and conspicuous from Georgia, Florida, and our Gulf States. Sirius follows it in culmination by about twenty minutes. Canopus is so brilliant that observers in Chile, in 1861, considered it brighter than Sirius; and Tennyson, in his .Dream of Fair Womnr, made it a simile of intensest light,- in Cleopatra's words,

Bcrossos described Oannes as the teacher of early man in all knowledge; and in mythology he was even the creator of man and the father of Tammw: and Ishtar, themselves associated with other stars and sky figures. Jensen thinks Oannes connected with the stan of Capricorn; Lockyer finds his counterpart in the god Chnemu of Southern Egypt ; and some have regarded him as the prototype of Noah.

The variations in its light are as remarkable in their irregularity as in their degree, The first recorded observation, said to have been by Halley in 1677, although it is not in his Southern Catalogue, made 11 a 4th-magnitude, but since that it has often varied either way, at longer or shorter intervals, from absolute invisibility by the naked eye to a brilliancy almost the equal of Sirius. Sir John Herschel saw it thus in December, 1837, as others did in 1843; but, gradually declining since then, it touched its lowest recorded magnitude of 7.6 in March, 1886. It is now, however, on the increase; for on the 13th of May, 1896, it was 5.1, or about a half. magnitude higher than its maximum of the preceding year. The nebula, N. G. C. 3372, surrounding this star has been called the Keyhole from its characteristic features; but the most brilliant portion, as drawn by Sir John Herschel, seems to have disappeared at some time be- , tween 1837 and 1871.

is Ariete io Italy, lWlier in France, and Widder in Germany-Bayer's Wider; in the Anglo-Saxon tongue it is Ramm, and in the Anglo-Norman of the 12th century, Kultuna. The constellation is marked by the noticeable triangle to the west of the Pleiades, 6° north of the ecliptic, 20° north of the celestial equator, and 20° due south from y Andromedae. With the Greeks it was Kp,~, and sometimes 'Aiyo,cepw,;, although this last was more usual for Capricorn.

It will be remembered that on the way Helle fell off into the sea, which thereafter became the Hellespont, as Manilius wrote :
First Golden Aries shines (who whilst he swam Lost part of's Freight, and gave the Sea a Name);
and Longfellow, in his translation from Ovid's 1ristia:

On reaching his journey's end, Phrixus sacrificed the creature and hung its fleece in the Grove of Ares, where it was turned to gold and became the object of the Argonauts' quest. From this came others of Aries' titles : OYil aurea and auratua, Chrylom&llu, and the Low Latin Chrylovellu.
The A.tbamaa used by Columella was a classical reproduction of the Euphratean Tammuz Dum-uzi, the Only Son of Life, whom Aries at one t!me represented in the heavens, as did Orion at a previous date, perhaps when it marked the vernal equinox 4500 B. c. Cicero and Ovid styled the constellation Corn111; elsewhere it was Cor
niger and Laniger; Vena. the Wether; Du opulenti gregia; Oaput arieti· num; and, in allusion to its position, A.equinootialil. Vernu Portitor, the Spring-bringer, is cited by Caesius, who also mentioned A.roanu, that may refer to the secret rites in the worship of the divinities whom Aries represented. From about the year 1730 before our era he was the Princep■ aigncmua
ooele■timn, Prinoepa locliaci, and the Duotor mroitlll sodiaci, continuing so through Hipparchos' time; Manilius writing of this:
The Ram having pass'J the Sta serenely shines, And leads tho Year, the Prince of all the Signs.
But about A. n. 420 his office was transferred to Pisces. Brown writes as to the origin of the title Aries, without any supposition of resemblance of the group io the animal:
The stars were regarded by a pastoral population as flocks ; each asterism had iu special leader, and the star, and subsequently the constellation, that led the heavens through the year was the Ram.
Elsewhere he tells us that when Aries became chief of the zodiac signs it took the Akkadian titles Ku, I-ku, and I-ku-u, from its luada Hamal, all equivalents of the Assyrian B.ubd, Prince, and very appropriate to the leading stellar group of that date, although not one of the first formations. He also finds, from an inscription on the Tablet of the Thirty Stars, that the Euphratean astronomers had a constellation Gam, the Scimetar, stretching from Okda of the Fishes to Hamal of Aries, the curved blade being formed by the latter's three brightest components. This was the weapon protecting the kingdom against the Seven Evil Spirits, or Tempest Powers. Jensen thinks that Aries may have been first adopted into the zodiac by the Babylonians when its stars began to mark the vernal equinox ; and that the insertion of it between Taurus and Pegasus compelled the cutting off a



The Constellations 77
part of each of those figures,-a novel suggestion that would save much theorizing as to their sectional character. . The Jewish Nisan, our March-April, was associated with Aries, for Josephus said that it was when the sun was here in this month that his people were released from the bondage of Egypt; and so was the same month .Sisanu of Assyria, where Aries represented the Altar and the Sacrifice, a ram usually being the victim. Hence the prominence given to this sign in antiquity even before its stars became the leaders of the rest; although Berossos and Macrobius attributed this to the ancient belief that the earth ~-as created when the sun was within its boundaries; and Albumasar,1 of the 9th century, in his .RrvolulilJn of Years wrote of the Creation as having taken place when "the seven planets"-the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, ~[ars, Jupiter, and Saturn -were in conjunction here, and foretold the destruction of the world when they should be in the same position in the last degree of Pisces. Dante, who called the constellation Kontone, followed with a similar thought in the Inferno:
The sun was mounting with those stars That with him were, what lime the Love Divine At first in motion set those beauteous things.
To come, however, to a more precise_ date, Pliny said that Cleostratos ot Tenedos first formed Aries, and, at the same time, Sagittarius; but their origin probably was many centuries, even millenniums, antecedent to this, and the statement is only correct in so far as that he may have been the first to write of them.
Many think that our figure was designed to represent the Egyptian King of Gods shown at Thebes with ram's horns, or veiled and crowned with feadlers, and variously known as Amon, Ammon, Hammon, Amen, or Amun, and worshiped with great ceremony at his temple in the oasis Ammonium, now Siwah, 5° west of Cairo on the northern limit of the Libyan desert. Kircher gave Aries' title there as Ta,-ieTovpo A,-iovv, Regum Ammonis. But there is doubt whether the Egyptian stellar Ram coincided with ours, although Miss Clerke says that the latter's stars were called the Fleece.

As the god Amen was identified with ZEvf and Jupiter of the Greeksand Romans, so ~lso was Aries, although this popularly was attributed to the story that the classical divinity assumed the Ram's form when all the inhabitants of Olympus fled into Egypt from the giants led by Typhon. From this came the constellation's titles lupiter Ammon; lovil Sidua; Kinenu Sidu, the goddess being Jove's daughter; the lupit.er Libyoua of Propertius, Deu Libyoua of Dionysius, and Ammon Libyoua of Nonnus. The Hebrews knew it as Teli, and inscribed it on the banners of Gad or Naphtali ; the Syrians, as Amru or Bmru ; the Persians, as Bara, Jere, or Berre ; the Turks, as Xui ; and in the Parsi .Bunddusl, it was Vant: all 1 these being synonymous with Aries. The unexplained An.bib, or .Aribib, also is seen for it. The early Hindus called it Aja and Kelha, the Tamil Kelham; but the later followed the Greeks in Kriya. An Arabian commentator on Ulug Beg called the constellation Al Xablh , al 'Alif, the Tame Ram; but that people generally knew it as Al ]Jamal, the Sheep, - Hammel with Riccioli, Alohamalo with Schickard, and Alhamel with Chilmead. As one of the zodiacal twelve of China it was the Dog, early known as Heang Low, or Kiang Leu; and later, under Jesuit influence, as Pih Yang, the White Sheep; while with Taurus and Gemini it constituted the White Tiger, the western one of the four great zodiac groups of China; also known as the Lake of Pullneu, the Five Beservoin of Heaven, and the Houae of the Five Bmperon.
Chaucer and other English writers of the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries Anglicized the title as Ariete, which also appeared in the Low Latin of the 17th century. It was about this time, when it was sought to reconstruct the constellations on Bible lines, that Aries was said to represent Abraham'• lla.m caught in the thicket ; as also Saint Peter, the bishop of the early church, with Triangulum as his Mitre. Caesius considered it the Lamb sac• rificed on Calvary for all sinful humanity. Aries generally has been figured as reclining with reverted head admiring his own golden fleece, or looking with astonishment at the Bull rising backward; but in the Albumasar of 1489 he is standing erect, and some early artists showed him running towards the west, with what is probably designed for the zodiac-belt around his body. A coin of Domitian bears a representation of him as the Princep■ juventuti■, and he appeared on those of Antiochus of Syria with head towards the Moon and Mars - an ap· propriate figuring; for, astrologically, Aries was the lunar house of that planet. In common with all the other signs, he is shown on the zodiacal rupees generally attributed to the great Mogul prince Jehangir Shah, but

really struck by Nur Mahal Mumtaza, his favorite wife, between 1616 and 1624, each figure being surrounded by sun-rays with an inscription on the reverse. Its equinoctial position gave force to Aratos' description of its "rapid transits," but he is strangely inexact in his
faint and starless to behold As stars by moonlight
a blunder for which Hipparchos seems to have taken him to task. Aratos however, was a more successful versifier than astronomer. Among astrologers Aries was a dreaded sign indicating passionate temper and bodily hurt, and thus it fitly formed the Houae of Kan, although some attributed guardianship over it to Pallas Minerva, daughter of Jove whom Aries represented. It was supposed to hold sway o,·er the head and face; in fact the Egyptians called it AnallDl, the Lord of the Head; while, geographically, it ruled Denmark, England, France, Germany, Lesser Poland and Switzerland, Syria, Capua, Naples and Verona, with white and red as its colors. In the time of Manilius it was naturally thought of as ruling the Hellespont and Propontis, Egypt and the Nile, Persia and Syria; and, with Leo and Sagittarius, was the Fiery Trigon. Ampelius said that it was in charge of the Roman Africus, the Southwest Wind, the Italians' Affrico, or Gherbino; but the Archer and Scorpion also shared this duty. Pliny wrote that the appearance of a comet within its borders portended great wars and wide-spread mortality, abasement of the great and elevation of the small, with fearful drought in the regions over which the sign predominated; while 17th-century almanacs attributed many troubles to men, and declared that " many shall die of the rope" when the sun was in the sign; but they ascribed to its influence " an abundance of herbs." Its symbol, 'l', probably represents the head and horns of the animal. The eastern portion is inconspicuous, and astronomers have mapped others of its stars somewhat irregularly, carrying a horn into Pisces and a leg into Cetus. Argelander assigns to it 50 naked-eye components; Heis, So. The sun now passes through it from the 16th of April to the 13th of May. A IIQ'IJa is reported to have appeared here in May, 1012, described by Epidamous, the monk of Saint Gall, as oeulos v~rhrans.

Hamal, from the constellation title, was formerly written Hamel, Hema], Hamul, and Hammel; Riccioli having Baa Hammel from Al Bil al)Jamal, the Head of the Sheep. Burritt's El D~ from Al Dp)J., the Horn of the Butting One, is appropriate enough for this star, but in our day is given to /3 Tauri; still Burritt had authority for it, as Kazwini, Al Tizini, Ulug Beg, and the Arabic globes all used the word here; and Chaucer wrote, in 1374:
He knew ful wel how fer Alnath was shove ft'ro the heed of thilke fixe Aries above.
The title of the whole figure also is seen in Arietia, another designation for this star, as was often the case with many of the ludtlae of the constellations. In Ptolemy's and Ulug Beg's descriptions it was "over the head"; but both of these mentioned Hipparchos as having located it over the muzzle, and near to that feature it was restored by Tycho, in the forehead, as we now have it. Renouf identified it with the head of the Oooae supposed to be one of the early zodiacal constellations of Egypt. Strassmaier and Epping, in their Astronomisd,es aus .Babylon, say that there its stars formed the third of the twenty-eight ecliptic constellations,Arku-aha-riahu-ku, literally the Back of the Head of Ku,-which had been established along that great circle millenniums before our era; and Lenormant quotes, as an individual title from cuneiform inscriptions, Dil·br, the Proclaimer of the Dawn, that Jensen reads Aa-kar, and others Dil-gan, the Messenger of Light. George Smith inferred from the tablets that it might be the Star of the Flocks; while other Euphratean names have been · Lu-lim, or Lu-nit, the Ram's Eye; and Si-mal or Si-mul, the Hom Star, which came down even to late astrology as the Ram's Horn. It also was A.nuv, and had its constellation's titles 1-ku and I-ku-u,- by abbreviation Xu,-the Prince, or the Leading One, the Ram that led the heavenly flock, some of its titles at a different date being applied to Capella of Auriga. Brown associates it with Aloros, the first of the ten mythical kings of Akkad anterior to the Deluge, the duration of whose reigns proportionately coincided with the distances apart of the ten chief ecliptic stars beginning with Hamal, and he deduces from this kingly title the Assyrian Ailuv, and the Hebrew Ayil; the other stars corresponding to the other mythical kings being Alcyone, Aldebaran, Pollux, Regulus, Spica, Antares, Algedi, Deneb Algedi, and Scheat.

The interesting researches of Mr. F. C. Penrose on orientation in Greece have shown that many of its temples were pointed to the rising or setting of various prominent stars, as we have seen to be the case in Egypt; this feature in their architecture having doubtless been taken by the receptive, as well as "somewhat superstitious," Greeks from the Egyptians, many of whose structures are thought to have been so oriented six or seven millenniums before the Christian era, although our star Hamal was not among those thus observed on the Nile, for precession had not yet brought it into importance. Of the Grecian temples at least eight, at various places and of dates ranging from 1580 to 360 B. c., were oriented to this star; those of Zeus and his daughter Athene being especially thus favored, as Aries was this god's symbol in the sky. It was perhaps this prevalence of temple orientation, in addition to their many divinities and especially I, "Ayvwa-ror 0e6r, the Unknown God, which furnished an appropriate text for Saint Paul's great sermon on the Areopagus to the "men of Athens," when, in order to prove our source of being from Him, he quoted, as in A,ts xvii, 28, from the celebrated fifth verse of the PJ,ainomma:
Toii yap ml rtvor loμlv 1 (For we are also his offspring).
To this work this quotation generally is ascribed, and naturally so, for the poet and apostle were fellow-countrymen from Cilicia; but the same words are found in the Hymn to Jupiter by Cleanthes the Stoic, 265 B. c. As Saint Paul, however, used the plural -rivir in his reference, "certain even of your own poets," he may have had both of these authors in mind. Hamal lies but .little north of the ecliptic, and is much used in navigation in connection with lunar observations. It culminates on the 11th of December. Vogel finds it to be in approach to our system at the rate of about nine · miles a second. Its spectrum is similar to that of the sun.

It is a large constellation stretching northward across the Milky Way from its star -y, which also marks one of the Bull's horns, to the feet of Camelopardalis, about 30° in extent north and south and 40° east and west; and is shown as a young man with whip in the right hand, but without a chariot, the Goat being supported against the left shoulder and tlie Kids on the wrist. This, with some variations, has been the drawing from the earliest days, when, as now, it was important, chiefly from the beauty of Capella and its attendant stars so prominent in the northwest in the spring twilight, and in the northeast in early autumn. But the Hyginus of 1488 has a most absurd Driver in a ridiculously inadequate four-wheeled car, with the Goat and Kids in their usual position, the reins being held over four animals abreast - a yoke of oxen, a horse, and a zebra (!) ; while the Hyginus of Micyllus, in 1535, has the Driver in a two-wheeled cart with a pair of horses and a yoke of oxen all abreast. A Turkish planisphere shows

these stars depicted as a Kule, and they were so regarded by the early Arabs, who did not know- at all events did not picture -the Driver, Goat, or Kids. In this form Bayer Latinized it as the Kulu clitellatu, the Mule with Panniers. Ideler thinks that the original figure was made up of the five stars a, {J, t, {, and 'I; the Driver, represented by a, standing on an antique sloping Chariot marked by /3; ·the other stars showing the reins. But later on the Chariot was abandoned and the reins transferred to their present position, the Goat being added by a misunderstanding, the word •Aif, analogous to 'Ai-yir, simply meaning a Storm Wind that, apparently, in all former times the stars a, 'I, and ;have portended at their heliacal rising, or by their disappearance in the mists. Still later to a as the Goat were added the near-by 'I and ; as her Kids, the •Ep,4>o,,-an addition that Hyginus said was made by Cleostratos. But the results of modem research now give us reason to think that the constellation originated on the Euphrates in much the same form as we have it, and that it certainly was a well-established sky figure there mil• lenniums ago. A sculpture from Nimroud is an almost exact representation of Auriga with the Goat carried on the left arm; while in Graeco-Baby· lonian times the constellation B.ukubi, the Chariot, lay here nearly coincident with our Charioteer, perhaps running over into Taurus. 'Eviaxor, the Rein-holder, was transcribed Heaiochu by Latin authors, and personified by Germanicus and others as Erechtheua, or more properly Brichthoniua, son of Vulcan and Minerva, who, having inherited his fa. ther's lameness, found necessary some means of easy locomotion. This was secured by his invention of the four-horse chariot which not only well be· came his regal position as the 4th of the early kings of Athens, but secured for him a place in the sky. Manilius thus told the story:
Near the bent Bull a Seat the Driver claims, Whose skill conferr'd his Honour and his Names. His Art great Jove admir'd, when first he drove His rattling Carr, and 6x't the Youth above.
Vergil had something similar in his 3d.Georgic. These names appear as late as the 17th century with Bullialdus and Lon· gomontanus, Riccioli writing Brichtoniu. Others saw here Kyrtilua, the charioteer of Oenomaus, who betrayed his master to Pelops; or Cillaa, the latter's driver; Pelethroniua, a Thessalian; and Trethon; while Euripides and Pausanias identified him with the un• fortunate Hippolytu, the Hebrew Joseph of classical literature.

tional titles in Greece were 'Apfui..an,r, liu/>P'IMI.T'lf, 'hr71''/A(fr'lr; and 'EAda&71'7Tl>f, all signifying a Charioteer; while La Lande's Bellerophon and Phlithon are appropriate enough, and his Trochilu may be, if the word be degenerated from Tpoxal~, running; but his Abqrthe, correctly •A,pvpTOf, the young brother of Medea, is unintelligible. Although Auriga was the usual name with the Latins, their poets called it Aurigator ; .Agitator curru1 retineu habenu; Habenifer and TeneDI habenu, the Charioteer and the Rein-holder; some of these titles descending to the Ta/J/es and Almagests down to the 16th century. Arator, the Ploughman, appeared with Nigidius and Varro for this, or for Bootes; in fact the same idea still holds with some of the Teutonic peasantry, among whom Capella and the Kids are known as the Ploughman with hi, Oxen. Grimm mentions for the group Voluyara, as stars that ploughmen know. The .Acator occasionally seen may be an erroneous printing of Arator.
From the Goat and Kids came Cutol caprarum, HabeDI capellu, Habeu haecloa, and Habenl himun. Habenl oleniam capram and Oleniae lidu pluviale Capellae of Ovid's Meta11Wrplwses are from the 'fllev[v'lv of Aratos, thought to be derived from thAiv11, the wrist, on which the Kids are resting. Some, however, with more probability have referred the word to Olenus, the father and birthplace of the nymph Amalthea in ancient Aetolia. Isidorus of Hispalis 1 - Saint Isidore - called it Kavora, the poetical tenn for Mars, the father of Romulus and so the god of the shepherds; Nonius, the Portuguese Pedro Nunez of the 16th century, similarly said that it was Kafutiu; and Bayer found for it Kaforte: but his Ophiultu, probably a Low Latin word also applied to a, seems to be without explanation. Some have thought that Auriga was Horu with the Egyptians; but Scaliger said that the Hora of the translation of Ptolemy's TeTpci.{Jt{Jlor should be Boha, Bayer's Boh, a Wagoner; Beigel, however, considered it a misprint for Lora, the Reins.
The barbarous Alhaior, Alhaiot, Althaiot, Alhailet, Alhatod, Alhajot, Alh"1oth, Alhojet, Alanao, Alan.at, and Alioo,- even these perhaps do not exhaust the list,- used for both constellation and lurida, are probably degenerate forms of the Arabs' Al '.Au and Al '.Ay~ specially applied to Capella as the Goat, which they figured as the desert Ibex, their Badan ; and Ideler thinks that this may have been the earliest Arabic designation for the star.
The 1515 Almagest says, "et 11ominatur laline antarii . . . id est collarium,"- this Collarium perhaps referring to the collar in the Charioteer's har

ness; but the A.ntarii has puzzled all, unless it be Professor Young, who suggests that it may be the reins diverging from the Driver's hand like guyropes, which the original means as used by Vitruvius in his description of a builder's derrick. The Arabians translated the classic titles for the Rein-holder into Al Dhu al 'Inin, Al J6lik al 'Inin, and Al Kumaik al 'Inin,- Chilmead's Kumaaioh Alhanam; but the Rabbi Aben Ezra 1 mixed things up by calling the figure Put.or in eujus manu estfrenum.
Some have illustrated it as Saint lerome, but Caesius likened it to Jaeob deceiving his father with the flesh of his kids; and Seiss says that it represents the Good Shepherd who laid down his life for the sheep.

This has been known as Capella, the Little She-goat, since at least the times of Manilius, Ovid, and Pliny, all of whom followed the K1vijaiu Xe,,ujv~ of Aratos in terming it a Signum pluviale like its companions the Haedi, thus confirming its stormy character throughout classical days. Holland translated Pliny's words the rainy Goat-atarre; Pliny and Manilius treated it as a constellation by itself, also calling it Capra, Caper, Jliro1ll, and by other hircine titles. Our word is the diminutive of Capra, sometimes turned into Crepa, and more definitely given as Olenia, Olenie, Capra Olenie, and the Olenium Altrum of Ovid's Heroides. In the present day it is Cabrilla with the Spaniards, and Chevre with the French. Amalthea came from the name of the Cretan goat, the nurse of Jupiter and mother of the Haedi, which she put aside to accommodate her fosterchild, and for which Manilius wrote :
The Nursing Goat's repaid with Heaven.
From this came the occasional lovis 1'utrix.
I This celebrated man, often cited in bygone days as Abenare, Avenore, Evenare, was Abraham ben Meir ben Ezra of Toledo, the great Hebrew commentator of the 111th century, an astronomer, mathematician, philologist, poet, and scholar, and the first noted biblical critic.

But, according to an earlier version, the nurse was the nymph Amalthea, who, with her sister Melissa, fed the infant god with goat's milk and honey on Mount Ida, the nymph Aige being sometimes substituted for one or both of the foregoing; or Adrasta, with her sister Ida, all daughters of the Cretan king Melisseus. Others said that the star represented the Goat's horn broken off in play by the infant Jove and transferred to the heavens as Comu oopiae, the Hom of Plenty, a title recalled by the modern Lith
uanian Pood•bearer, In this connection, it was 'A1,al8tia,; "i~, also brought absurdly enough into the Septuagint as a translation of the words Keren-happuch, the Paint-horn, or the Horn of Antimony, of the B""k of Joi, xlii, 14,- the Comus tibii of the Vulgate, Ptolemy's •A,f probably be
came the Arabo-Greek 'A,ov" of the Graeco-Persian Chrysococca's book, and the Affif, Alhajoo, Alhajoth, Alathod, Alkatod, Alatudo, Atud, etc., which it shared with the constellation; but ldeler thought 'Ayyiilt an indigenous term of the Arabs for this star. Assemani's Alcahela may have come from Capella. The Tyrians called it 'lyiithi, applied also to Aldebaran and perhaps to other stars; but the Rabbis adopted the Arabic 'Ayylllt as a title for their heavenly Goat, although they greatly disagreed as to its location, placing it variously in Auriga, Taurus, Aries, and Orion. The "armborne she goat," however, of Aratos, derived from the priests of Zeus, would seem to fix it positively where we now recognize it. Hyde devoted three pages of learned criticism to this important (I) subject, but
insisted that the Arabic and Hebrew word •.Lh designated this star. With { and 'I, the Kids, it formed the group that Kazwini knew as Al 1nis, the Goats, but others as Al 'Au, in the singular. The early Arabs called it Al Bikib, the Driver; for, lying far to the north, it was prominent in the evening sky before other stars became visi
ble, and so apparently watching over them; and the synonymous Al Hi4i of the Pleiades, as, on the parallel of Arabia, it rose with that cluster. Wetzstein, the biblical critic often quoted by Delitzsch, explains this last te~ as "the singer riding before the procession, who cheers the camels by the sound of the luzawa, and thereby urges them on," the Pleiades here being regarded as a troop of camels. An early Arab poet alluded to this Haqi as overseer of the Mrisir game, sitting behind the players, the other stars. Bayer's Ophiultlll now seems unintelligible. Capella's place on the Denderah zodiac is occupied by a mummied cat in the outstretched hand of a male figure crowned with feathers; while, always an important star in the temple worship of the great Egyptian god
Ptah, the Opener, it is supposed to have borne the name of that divinity and probably was observed at its setting 1700 B. c. from his temple, the



88 Star-Names and their Meanings
noted edifice at Karnak near Thebes, the No Amon of the books of the prophets Jeremiah and Nahum. Another recently discovered sanctuary of Ptah at Memphis also was oriented to it about 5200 B. c. Lockyer thinks that at least five temples were oriented to its setting. It served, too, the same purpose for worship in Greece, where it may have been the orientation point of a temple at Eleusis to the goddess Diana Propyla ; and of another at Athens. In India it also was sacred as Brahma B.iclaya, the Heart of Brahma; and Hewitt considers Capella, or Arcturus, the lryaman, or Airyaman, of the Rig Veda.
The Chinese had an asterism here, formed by Capella with (3, 9, "•and"/, which they called Woo Chay, the Five Chariots - a singular resemblance in title to our Charioteer; although Edkins says that this should be the Chariots of the Five Emperors. The Akkadian Di1-gan I·ku, the Messenger of Light, or Dil-gan Babili, the Patron star of Babylon, is thought to have been Capella, known in Assyria as I-ku, the Leader, i. e. of the year; for, according to Sayce, in Akkadian times the commencement of the year was determined by the position of this star in relation to the moon at the vernal equinox. This was previous to 1730 B. c., when, during the preceding 2150 years, spring began when the sun entered the constellation Taurus; in this connection the star was known as the Star of ](ardtk, but subsequent to that date some of these titles were apparently applied to Hamal, Wega, and others whose positions as to that initial point had changed by reason of precession. One cuneiform inscrip· tion, supposed to refer to our Capella, is rendered by Jensen Altar, the Tempest God; and the 1ab/d of the Thirty Stars bears the synonymous Ka-a-tu; all this well accounting for its subsequent character in classical times, and one of the many evidences adduced as to the origin of Greek constellational astronomy in the Euphrates valley. The ancient Peruvians, the Quichuas, whose language is still spoken by their descendants, appear to have devoted much attention to the stars; and Jose de Acosta, the Spanish Jesuit and naturalist of the 16th century, said that every bird and beast on earth had its namesake in their sky. He cited several of their stellar titles, identifying this star with Colca, singularly prominent with their shepherds, as Capella was with the same class on the
Mediterranean in ancient days; indeed in later also, for the Shepherd'• Star has been applied to it by our English poets, although more commonly to the planet Venus. In astrology Capella portended civic and military honors and wealth. Tennyson, in some fine lines in his Maud,mentions it as" a glorious crown.''

As to its color astronomers are not agreed; Smyth calling it bright white; Professor Young yellow; and others say blue or red, which last it was asserted to be by Ptolemy, Al Ferghani, and Riccioli; while those whose eyes are specially sensitive to that tint still find it such. Capella perhaps has increased in lustre during the present century; but, brilliant as it is, its parallax of 011.095, obtained from Elkin's observations,
indicates a distance from our system of 341⁄4 light years ; and, if this be correct, the star emits 250 times as much light as our sun. Its spectrum resembles that of the latter; indeed spectroscopists say that Capella is virtually identical with the sun in physical constitution, and furnishes the model spectrum of the Solar type,1 yellow in tinge and ruled throughout with innumerable fine dark lines. Vogel thinks it receding from our system at the rate of 15-U miles a second. It is the most northern of all the 1st-magnitude stars, rising in the latitude of New York City at sunset about the middle of October, and culminating at nine o'clock in the evening of the 19th of January. Thus it is visible at some hour of every clear night throughout the year.

the two practically equal stars that compose the pair being only 13⁄4 millions of miles apait, and revolving in a period of about four days, with a relative velocity of fully 150 miles a second.

Horace similarly knew them as l,orrida d insana sit/era and insana Caprae sukra; and Ovid as nimDOsi, rainy. They thus shared the bad repute in which Capella was held by mariners, and were so much dreaded, as presaging the stormy season on the Mediterranean, that their rising early in October evenings was the signal for the closing of navigation. All classical authors who mention the stars alluded to this direful influence, and a festival, the Nata/is navigatwnis, was held when the days of that influence were past.

2° south from X, on the 24th of January, 1892, an amateur observer, the Reverend Doctor Thomas D. Anderson of Edinburgh, discovered with an opera-glass a 5th-magnitude yellowish nqva, now known as T Aurigae, which has excited so much interest in the astronomical world by the character of its spectrum. Subsequent to the optical discovery it was identified on a photographic plate taken on the 10th of December previously, but not on one taken on the 8th, thus indicating its appearance in the sky between those two dates. Other photographs show that its maximum, 4.4, occurred about the 20th. Its conflagration, however, is supposed to have occurred at least

a hundred, perhaps many hundred, years ago, so great is its distance from our system. It became invisible towards the end of April, 1892, but was rediscovered from Mount Hamilton on the 19th of August as a planetary nebula, the second instance in astronomical history of such a change of character, the nova Cygni of 1877 having been the first. It was still visible 1 in 1895, its spectrum continuing distinctly nebular in its character; and it is worthy of notice that two others of the new stars discovered since the application of the spectroscope to this class of investigations have had nearly identical histories. Scheiner, who gives a detailed account of this phenomenon in his Spectra/analyse, alludes to the velocity of the two constituent bodies as being 400 miles or more a second; if indeed - which some doubt - the peculiar separation of the bright and dark lines of hydrogen noted in its spectrum is to be accounted for by the relative motion of gaseous masses involved in the phenomenon. ,j,1 to ,f,10, 5th-magnitude stars, were the Bovltjyir, or Goads, the Latin Dolonea, called Stimulu by Tibullus.

imagined the Driver of Asterion and Chara in their pursuit of the Bear around the pole, thus alluded to by Carlyle in Sartor Resarlus:
What thinks BocStes of them, as he leads his Hunting Dogs over the zenith in their leash of sidereal fire ?
Others, and perhaps more correctly, thought the word B<>17T,jr, Clamorous, transcribed as Boetea, from the shouts of the Driver to his Oxen,- the Triones,- or of the Hunter in pursuit of the Bear; Hevelius suggesting that the shouting was in encouragement of the Hounds. In translations of the Syn/axis this idea of a Shouter was shown by Vooiferator, Vociferalll, Cl&mau, Olamator, Plerau, the Loud Weeper, and even, perhaps, by Canis latraQS, the Barking Dog, that Aben Ezra applied to its stars in the Hebrew words Kelebh h&1111&bih.
The Arabians rendered their similar conception of the figure by Al '.6.wri',- Chilmead's AlhaVL
The not infrequent title Herdaaan, from the French Bouvier, also is appropriate, for not only was he associated with the Oxen of the Wain, but in Arab days the near-by circumpolar stars were regarded as a Fold with its inmates and enemies.
Other names were 'Apnoq,v).,a~ and 'Apnovpor, the Bear-watcher and the Bear-gaard, the latter first found in the "Epya •al 'Hμepat, the Works and Days, "a Boeotian shepherd's calendar," by Hesiod, eight centuries before our era. But, although these words were often interchanged, the former generally was used for the constellation and the latter for its lucida, as in the Phai11omma and by Geminos and Ptolemy. Still the poets did not aiways discriminate in this, the versifiers of Aratos confounding the titles notwithstanding the exactness of the original ; although Cicero in one place definitely wrote :
Arctophylax, vulgo qui dicitur esse Bootes.
Transliterated thus, - or .6.rtophilaxe,- and as Aroturul, both names are seen for the constellation with writers and astronomers even to the 18th century; Chaucer having" ye sterres of Arctour." The scientific Isidorus knew it as Aroturu KiD.or, his Major being the Greater Bear. Smyth derived this word from •Apnov ovpd., the Bear's Tail, as Bootes is near that part of Ursa Major; but this is not generally accepted-indeed is expressly condemned by the critic Buttmann. Statius also called it Portitor Unae; Vitruvius had Cutol and Outol
Anti, the Bear-keeper; Ovid, Outos Brymauthidoa Unae; the Aljonsine



94 Star-Names and their Meanings
Ta6ks, Afflari Cutol ; while the Bear-cbiver is often seen with early English writers. Although Manilius knew it in connection with the Bear, he changed the simile when he wrote : whose order'd Beams Present a Figure driving of his Teams;
and Aratos long before had united the two thoughts and titles:
Behind and seeming to urge on the Bear, Arctophylax, on earth Bootes named, Sheds o'er the Arctic car his silver light.
Plautri Cutol, the Keeper of the Wain, was another name for it that altered the character of Bootes' duties; Ovid following in this with :
interque Triones Flexerat obliquo plaustrum temone Bootes.
It has been Lycaon, the father, or grandfather, of Kallisto, when that nymph was identified with Ursa Major; as well as Arcu, her son; Ovid distinctly asserting in the 2d of the Fasti that Arctophylax in the skies was the earthly Areas, although it is often wrongly supposed that the latter is represented by Ursa Minor; it was Septentrio, from its nearness to the north, so taking one of the Bear's titles ; and Atlu, because, near to the pole, it sustained the world. Hesychios, of about A. o. 370, called it Orion, but this seems unintelligible unless originating from a misunderstanding of Homer's lines, translated by
Lord Derby: Arctos call'd the Wain, who wheels on high His circling course, and on Orion waits,
as if they were in close proximity. Or the title may come from some confu• sion with the Oru, or Koru, of the Egyptians, that was associated with both Orion and Bootes. La Lande alluded to this when he wrote:
Arctouros ou l'Orus voisin de l'Ourse, pour le distinguer de la constellation meridionalc d'Orion;
and, in considering this very different derivation of our word Arcturus, it should be remembered that Kavdaor and KavdaCaJv were the titles also applied to Bootes, as the latter Greek word was to Orion by the Boeotians. It would be interesting to know more of this connection. Philomelu is another designation, as if he were the son of the neighboring Virgo Ceres; and the early title VenatorUr-.e, the Hunter of the Bear,again



The Constellations 95
appears as Bimrocl, the Mighty Hunter before the Lord, with the biblical school of two or three centuries ago; although this was more usual for Orion. Putor, the Shepherd, presumabJy is from the Arabic idea of a Fold around the pole, or from the near-by flock in the Pasture towards the southeast, in our Hercules and Ophiuchus; or perhaps by some confusion with Cepheus, who also was a Shepherd with his Dog. Putinator is Hyde's rendering of a supposed Arabic title signifying a Digger or Trencher in a vineyard. A commentator on Aratos called it TpvyETf7f, the Vintager, as its rising in the morning twilight coincided with the autumnal equinox and the time of the grape harvest; Cicero repeating this in his Protrygeter; but both of these names better belonged to the star Vindemiatrix, our e Virginis. Still its risings and settings were frequently observed and made much of in all classical days, and even beyond the Augustan age, although many, perhaps most, of these allusions were to its bright star. As a calendar sign it was first mentioned by Hesiod, thus translated by Thomas Cooke:
When in the rosy mom Arcturus shines, Then pluck the clusters from the parent vines;
and again, but for a different season of the year :
When from the Tropic, or the winter's sun, Thrice twenty days and nights their course have run ; And when Arcturus leaves the main, to rise A star bright shining in the evening skies ; Then prune the vine.
Columella, Palladius, Pliny, Vergil, and others have similar references to Bootes, or to Arcturus, as indicating the proper seasons for various farmwork, as in the 1st Georgie:
Setting Bootes will afford the signs not obscure.
Ioaru, or Ioariu, also was a title for our constellation, from the unfortunate Athenian who brought so much trouble into the world by his practical expounding of Bacchus' ideas as to the proper use of the grape, and who was so unworthily exalted to the sky, with his daughter Erigone as Virgo, and their faithful hound Maera as Procyon or Sirius. From this story came the loarii bovea applied to the Triones by Propertius, and in the Andrews-Freund Lexicon to Bootes himself.
Ceginu, Seginu, and Ohegninu, as well as the Oheguim of the Ara6oLalin A/lhagest, may have wandered here in strangely changed form from the neighboring Cepheus; although Buttmann asserted that they probably

came, by long-repeated transcription and consequent errors, from Kheturu, the Arabian ·orthography for Arcturus. Bayer had Thtgiu, as usual without explanation ; still I find in Riccioli's Almageslum Nb'llum : .Arabiti Theguiu, fUOSiplorans a11tv«iferans; but Arabic scholars do not confirm this. La Lande cited Cutol Boua, the Keeper of the Oxen, and Bubulu, or Bubulou, the Peasant Ox-driver, although ldeler denied that the latter ever was used for Bootes. Juvenal, however, had it, and Minsheu defined Bootes as Bubulou ooelenia. Landseer, following La Lande, said that the Hmllmau was the national sign of ancient Egypt, the myth of the dismemberment of Osiris originating in the successive settings of its stars: and that there it was called Oliril, Jlaoohu, or Sabuiu, the ancient name
for Bacchus and Noah; and that Kircher's planisphere showed a·vme instead of the customary figure, thus recalling incidents in the histories of those worthies, as well as of Icarius. Homer characterized the constellation as l»f,€ dvt.>v, late in setting, a thought and expression now become hackneyed by frequent repetition.
Aratos had it : he, when tired o( day, At even lingers more than half the night;
Manilius somewhat varying this by
Slow Bootes drives his ling'ring Teams ;
Claudian, Juvenal, and Ovid, by lardus, slow, and piger, sluggish, which their later countryman Ariosto, of the 16th century, repeated in hispigro.Artaroi and Minsheu, in the 17th century, wrote ofit as
Bootes, or tlte Carman, a slo,v mooving starre, seated in tbe North Pole ,uen to Charles Waine, wlticlt itfalhwes.
And all this because, as the figure sets in a perpendicular position, eight hours are consumed in its downward progress, and even then the hand of Bootes never disappears below the horizon - a fact more noticeable in early days than now. The reverse, however, takes place at its rising in a horizontal position; hence the a.8p6~, all at once, of Aratos. Some say that these expressions of sluggishness are from its setting late in the season when the daylight is curtailed, or a reference to the natural gait of the Triones that Bootes is driving around the pole; while still others, more astronomically inclined, attributed them to his comparative nearness to
that point where slowest are the stars, Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle,
that Dante wrote of in the .Purga/oriQ.

The Constellations 97
Bootes' association with the Mons Mae~alus, on which he is sometimes shown, is unexplained unless by the suggestion found under that constellation heading. This association was current even in early days, if Landseer be correct where he says:
Eqsebius, quoting an ancient oracle which has apparent reference to this constellation as formerly represented, writes
A m~ goad the mountain herdsman bears.
Brown says that it was known in Assyria as Biu-but-tame, "that reappears in Greek as Bootes "; and thus
the idea of the ox-driving Ploughman or Herdsman, as applied to the constellation, is Euphratean in character.
Among its Arabian derivatives are lfekkar, often considered as Al lf~
p.r, the Digger, or Tearer, .analogous to the classic Trencher in the vineyard; but Ideler showed this to be an erroneous form of Al ~ ' the Herdsman, found with lbn Yunus (or Yunis). Albluropa, which appeared for Bootes in the Alfonsine Tables as In• caluru, is from KaAavpo,/J, a herdsman's Crook or Staff, with the Arabic article prefixed; this now is our title for the star μ. The staff, ultimately figured as a Lance, gave rise to the name A l ~ which came into general use among the Arabians, but subsequently degenerated in early European astronomical works into Aramech, Ariamech, and like words for the constellation as well as for its great star. The same figure is seen in Al ~ LUD, the Spear-bearer, or, as Caesius had it, Al Xamelu, Riccioli's Kolanza, and the Azimeth ColaDZa of Reduan's translator, which Ideler compared to the Latin cum lancea and the Italian col/a /anda. Similarly, Bayer said that on a Turkish map it was 'O'it1Toq>opor, the Arrow-bearer; and elsewhere Sagittifer and Lanoeator.
Al '1111 al Sa.mi' of Arabic literature originally was for Arcturus, although eventually applied to the constellation. But long before these ideas were current in Arabia, that people are supposed to have had an enormous Lion, their early Asad, extending over a third of the heavens, of which the stars Arcturus and Spica were the shin-bones; Regulus, the forehead ; the heads of Gemini, one of the fore paws; Canis Minor, the other; and Corvus, the hind quarters. Yet there seems to be doubt as to all this, as is more fully explained under a Geminorum. In Poland Bootes forms the Ogka, or Thills, of that country's much-extended Woz lfiebeu:i, the Heavenly Wain; and in the Old Bohemian
tongue it was PnJack, as unintelligible as it is unpronounceable. 7

The early Catholics knew it as Saint Sylftlter; Caesius said that it might represent the prophet Amoa, the Herdsman, or Shepherd Fig-dresser, of
Tekoa; but Weigel turned it into the Three Swecliah OroWDL Proctor asserted that Bootes, when first formed, perhaps included even the Crown, as we know that it did the Hunting Dogs; and that, so constituted,
it exhibits better than most constellations the character assigned to it. One can readily picture to one's self the figure of a Herdsman with upraised arm driving the Greater Bar before him.
The drawing by Heis, after Dilrer, is of a mature man, with herdsman's staff, holding the leash of the Hounds; but earlier representations are ofa much younger figure: in all cases, however, well equipped with weapons of the chase, or implements of husbandry; the earliest form of these probably having been the winnowing fan of Bacchus. The Venetian Hyginus of 1488 shows the Wheat Sheaf, Coma Berenices, at his feet; Argelander's Uranomelria NQVa bas different figures on its two plates-one of the ancient form, the other of the modem holding the leash of the Hounds in full pursuit of the Bear. This constellation and the Bear, Orion, the Hyades, Pleiades, and Dog were the only starry figures mentioned by Homer and Hesiod; the latter's versifier, Thomas Cooke, giving as a reason therefor-" the names of which naturally run into an hexameter verse"; but the general assumption that these great poets knew no other constellations does not seem reasonable, although it will be noticed that all those alluded to are identical with each author. Bootes is a constellation of large extent, stretching from Draco to Virgo, 1 nearly 50° in declination, and 30° in right ascension, and contains 85 naked-eye stars according to Argelander, 140 according to Heis.

A.roturu has been an object of the highest interest and admiration to all observant mankind from the earliest times, and doubtless was one of the first stars to be named; for from Hesiod's day to the present it thus appears throughout all literature, although often confounded with the Greater Bear. Indeed Hesiod's use of the word probably was for that constellation, except in two cases, already quoted, where he unquestionably referred to this star, mentioning its rising fifty days after the winter solstice, the first allusion that we have to that celestial point. And it is popularly supposed that

our Arcturus is that of the B()()/e "I Job, xxxviii, 32 ; but there it merely is one of the early titles of Ursa Major, the Revised Version correctly rendering it" the Bear." Still, even now, the Standard Di&lit>nary quotes for the star the Authorized Version's
Canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons ?
But, like other prominent stars, it shared its name with its constellationin fact, probably at first, and as late as Pliny's day, was a constellation by itself. Homer's Bown1r doubtless was this, with, possibly, a few of its larger companions; and Bayer cited Bootea for the star; but in recent times the latter has monopolized the present title. It was famous with the seamen of early days, even from the traditional period of the Arcadian Evander, and regulated their annual festival by its movements in relation to the sun. But its influence always was dreaded, as is seen in Aratos' detvoii 'Ap,r,Toiipo10 and Pliny's horridum sidus; while Demosthenes, in his action against Lacritus 341 B. c., tells us of a bottomry bond, made in Athens on a vessel going to the river Borysthenes - the modem Dnieper- and to the Tauric Chersonese -the Crimea-and back, that stipulated for a rate of 221⁄2 per cent. interest if she arrived within the Bosporus" before Arcturus,";, e. before its heliacal 1 rising about mid-September; after which it was to be 30 per cent. Its acronycal 2 rising fixed the date of the husbandmen's Lustratio frugum ; and Vergil twice made allusion in his 1st Georgi& to its character as unfavorably affecting the fanners' work. Other contemporaneous authors confirmed this stormy reputation, while all classical calendars 3 gave the dates of its risings and settings. Hippocrates, 460 B. c., made much of the influence of Arcturus on the human body, in one instance claiming that a dry season, after its rising,
agrees best with those who are naturally phlegmatic, with those who are of a humid temperament, and with women; but it is most inimical to the bilious ;
and that diseases are especially apt to prove critical in these days.

I Copies of these calendars, called 11aea1t11yμa~a, engraved on stone or brass, were conspicuously exposed in the market-places, and two are supposed to have come down to us, - that of Geminos, 77 B, c., and of Ptolemy, A. D. 140. While these probably in the main were accurate, the allusions to their subjects by the poets and authors generally seem to be as often wrong as right, being based upon observations taken on trust from earlier writers, or from tradition, although by various causes, and especially by the effect of precession, they had become incorrect. Hesiod's statement, in the Wor.b and Days, of the beliacal rising of Arcturus is regarded as fixing his own date in history at about 8oo u. c.



100 Star-Names and their Meanings
The Prologue of the .Rudms of Plautus, delivered by Arcturus in person, and " one of the early opinions of the presence of invisible agents amongst mankind," declares of himself that he is considered a stormy sign at the times of his rising and setting,- as the original has it:
Arcturus signum, sum omnium quam acerrimum. Vehemens sum, cum exorior, cum occido vehementior.
And the passage from Horace's Odes
Nec saevus Arcturi cadentis Impetus aut orientis Haedi
is familiar to all. This same idea came down to modem days, for Pope re· peated it in his verse,
When moist Arcturus clouds the sky.
Astrologically, however, the star brought riches and honor to those born under it. An Egyptian astronomical calendar of the 15th century before Christ, deciphered by Renouf, associates it with the star Antares in the immense sky figure Kenat; and Lockyer claims it as one of the objects of worship in Nile templt;s, as it was in the temple of Venus at Ancona in Italy. In India it was the 13th naksltalra, Svati, the Good Goer, or perhaps Sword, but figured as a Coral Bead, Gem, or Pearl ; and known there also as 11'iah9&, Outcast, possibly from its remote nonhern situation far outside of the zodiac, whence, from its brilliancy, it was arbitrarily taken to complete the series of Hindu asterisms. Hewitt thinks that it, or Capella, was the .i.ryamiu of the .Rig Veda; and Edkins that it was the Tiltar usually as· signed to Sirius. The:: Chinese called it Ta Kio, the Great Horn, four small stars near by being Kang Ohe, the Drought Lake; Edkins further writing of it :
Arcturus is the palace of the emperor. The two groups of three small stars on its right [11, r, v] and left [,, o, ,r] are called lhe ti, the Leaders, because they assign a fixed direction to the tail of the Bear, which, as it revolves, points out the twelve hours of the horizon.
The Arabs knew Arcturus as Al Simit1 al Bimil), sometimes translated the Leg of the Lance-bearer, and again, perhaps more correctly, the Lofty

It is from a root meaning "to raise on high," and is thought to have been em· ployed by the Arabs when they wished to indicate any prominent object higb up In the heavens. but with special reference to this star and to the other Simlk, Spica of the Virgin.

Lance-bearer. From the Arabic title came various degenerate forms: Al lam.ea, .lrameo, Aremeah, Alcimec, Azimech, and Azimeth, found in those queer compendiums of stellar nomenclature the Aljo11sine Tables and the Almagest of 15 r5 ; Bomeoh haramaoh of Chilmead's Treatise; and Aramikh, which Karsten Niebuhr heard from the Arabs 136 years ago. The Kheturu of their predecessors, already alluded to under Bootes, also was used for this. The idea of a weapon again manifested itself in the KovTapdTor, Javelinbearer, of the Graeco-.Persian Tables; while Bayer had Gladiu, J[oJanza, and Pagio, all applied to Arcturus, which probably marked in some early drawing the Sword, Lance, or Dagger in the Hunter's hand. Similarly it took the title AJkamelu of the whole constellation.
Al :Jiri1 al Sami, the Keeper of Heaven, perhaps came from the star's early visibility in the twilight owing to its great northern declination, as though on the lookout for the safety and proper deportment of his lesser stellar companions, and so" Patriarch Mentor of the Train." This subsequently became Al Jp.ria al Simik, the Keeper of Simak, probably referring to Spica, the Unarmed One. Al Binlni mentioned Arcturus as the Seoond Calf of the Lion, the early Asad; Spica being the First Calf. It has been identified with the Chaldaeans' Pap81lkal, the Guardian Messenger, the divinity of their 10th month Tibitu; while Smith and Sayce have said that on the Euphrates it was the Shepherd of the Heavenly Plock, or the Shepherd of the Life of Heaven, undoubtedly the Sib-zi-anna of the inscriptions; the star '1 being often included in this, and thus making one of the several pairs of Euphratean Twin Stars. The 1515 Almagest and the Alfonsine Tables of 1521 add to their list of strange titles d no111inatur Audiens, which seems unintelligible unless the word be a misprint for Audens, the Bold One. John de Wiclif, in his translation of Amos v, 8, in 1383, had it Arture, which he took from the Vulgate's Arcturus for Ursa Major; but John of Trevisa in 1398 more correctly wrote:
Artla11r111 is a signe made of vn starres, .•. but properly Arthurus is a sterre sette behynde the tayle of the synge that hyght Vrsa maior.
With others it was Art1uia and Ariture, or the Carlwayneaterre from the early confusion in applying the title Arcturus to Charles' Wain as well as to Bootes and its lucida. Prominent as this star always has been, and one of the few to which Ptolemy assigned a name, yet its position has greatly varied in the draw

ings; indeed in the earliest it was located outside of the figure and so described in the Syntazis. It has been put on the breast; in the girdle, whence, perhaps, came Bayer's Arotuona; on the leg; between the knees, - Robert Recorde, the first English writer on astronomy, in 1556 mentioning in the Castle of Knowtedie the " very bryghte starre called Arcturus, which standeth between Bootes his legges"; and, as some of its titles denote, on the weapon in the hand. But since Diirer's time it has usually marked the fringe of the tunic. Smyth asserted that this is the first star on record as having been observed in the daytime with the telescope, as it was in 1635 by Morin, and subsequently, in July, 1669, by Gautier and the Abbe Picard, the sun having an elevation of 17°. Schmidt has seen it with the naked eye twenty· four minutes before sunset. While these instances serve to show its brilliancy, yet this was still more evinced when, enveloped in the Donati comet of 1858, and on the 5th of October, only 20' from the nucleus," it flashed out so vividly its superiority," visible for many hours. And it is somewhat remarkable that this same thing was seen 240 years before in the case of the comet of 1618; at least such is the record of John Bainbridge," Doctor of Physicke," who wrote:
The 27th ofNovember,in the morning, the comet's hair was spread over the faire stam Arcturus, betwixt the thighs of Arctophylax, or Bootes.
It is interesting to know that the first photograph of a comet was of Donati's, near this star, on the 28th of September, 1858. Ptolemy specified its color as vrr61t1ppat;, rendered ruti/11s, "golden red," in the 1551 Almagest; but Schmidt observed, on the 21st of March, 1852, that the star had lost its usual tinge, which it did not regain for several years. This phenomenon was confirmed by Argelander and by Kaiser of Leyden; but generally it has " figured immemorially in the short list of visibly fiery objects." Its rich color, in contrast with the white of Spica, the deeper red of Antares, and the sapphire of Wega, is very noticeable when all can be taken in together, at almost a single glance, on a mid· summer evening. The Germans know it as Arotur; the Italians and Spanish, as Arturo, Schiller wrote in the .Death of Wallenstein :
Not every one doth it become to question The far off high Arcturus ;
but Elkin did so in 1892, his observations resulting in a parallax of o".016,

i. e. insensible, the probable error being much greater than the measured parallax itself. The star has a large proper motion,1 given as 2".3 annually, which probably has shifted its position southwestward on the face of the sky by
somewhat more than 1° since the time of Ptolemy; and great velocity in the line of sight was assigned to it by the earlier spectroscopists, even as high as seventy miles a second; but the later and accordant determinations, at Potsdam by Vogel and at the Lick Observatory by Keeler, reduce this to between 4 and 43⁄4 miles. Its spectrum is Solar, of Secchi's second type, but with a remarkable mass of dark lines in the violet. Arcturus culminates on the 8th of June.

With y, 6, and μ, it constituted the trapezium Al Dbi'bah, the Female Wolves, or, perhaps, Hyaenas, an early asterism of the Arabs before they adopted the Greek constellation ; these animals, with others similar shown by stars in Draco and near it, lying in wait for the occupants of the ancient Fold around the pole. /J marks the head of the modem figure.

Keirer, Kesen, Keser, Kerak, and Kira.k, similar to the title of /j Andromedae, and all appropriate. The analogous Perizoma was used for it in the Alfonsine Tables.
Why it was so favored in nomenclature is not known, for with us it is noticeable only from its exquisite beauty in the telescope, whence it is fast monopolizing the name Puloherrima, given to it by the elder Struve. The components can be seen with a 2 3(-inch glass, about 3" apart, at a position angle of 325°. The period of their revolution is as yet undetermined, but they are thought to be approaching us at the rate of ten miles a second. This pair was the chief object of Sir William Herschel's investigations for stellar parallax about 1782, in which, of course, he was unsuccessful, although he did• not know the cause of his failure till years thereafter, when he recognized its binary character. {, f, o, and rr were TIO She Ti, an Officer, in China, on the left hand of the emperor.

Bayer called these Aaellu,-prim11s, sec1111d11s, and lerlius respectively,although without explanation ; but the title is well known for each of the two stars in Cancer flanking Praesaepe.

But Ideler, rejecting this, thought Schickard more correct in deriving these words from iv ,co)..6vpw, " in the colure," a statement that was nearly right as to Arcturus 2000 years ago; the name since then having, in some way, been transferred .to this star, as also to the constellation. The editor of the 1515 Almagest added to his title forμ el est ltastik luzkns caMs, which, ldeler said,- and Homer is for once caught nodding,-" is with reference to the surrounding hyaenas." This most erroneous explanation is corrected by the late Professor C. H. F. Peters of the Hamilton Observatory, whose private copy of this rare edition is now in my possession, in his autographic annotation that the original Arabic should have been rendered/errum curualum instead of caMs. Some Latin writers have called this star Venabulum, a Hunting-spear.

This word is from Ma"a, a Hoe, or Rake, used by Columella and Juvenal, and still is sometimes seen as Jlarrha for the star. The latter was well known to Pliny as Fah Italioa.

Burritt, in the early editions of his book, arbitrarily changed the name to Pruitelea, perhaps thinking thereby to avoid possible confusion with the constellation Sculptor. Caelum comes to the meridian with the star Aldebaran on the 10th of January, and is entirely visible from the 40th parallel.

It was formed by Bartschius, who published it, in outline only, in 1614, and wrote that it represented to him the Camel that brought Rebecca to Isaac. Was it from this that Proctor attempted to change its title to Claelu ?-an alteration that seems to have been adopted only by Mr. J. E11ard i Gore in his translation, in 1894, of Flammarion's Astronomk .Et,pulairt.

Aratos called it Kaptclvor, which Hipparchos and Ptolemy followed; the Caroinm of the AljonsiM Tables being the Latinized form of the Greek word. Eratosthenes extended this as Kap"ivar, •ovoi, 1Cal 4>aTV1J, the Crab, Asses, and Crib; and other Greeks have said 'OmofJofjdμwv and '01CTarrovr, the Ootipea of Ovid and Propertius. Litoreu, Shore-inhabiting, is from Manilius and Ovid ; Altaoua and
Cammaru appear with various classic writers; and llepa is from Cicero's De Ftnibus and the works of Columella, Manilius, Plautus, and Varro,-all signifying Crab, or Lobster, although more usual, and perhaps more correct, for Scorpio. Festus, the grammarian of the 3d century, said that this was an African word equivalent to Sil/us, a Constellation or Star. It is the most inconspicuous figure in the zodiac, and mythology apologizes for its being there by the story that when the Crab was crushed by Hercules, for pinching his toes during his contest with the Hydra in the marsh of Lerna, Juno exalted it to the sky; whence Columella called it Lernaeua. Yet few heavenly signs have been subjects of more attention in early days, and few better determined; for, according to Chaldaean and Platonist philosophy, it was the supposed Gate of Ien through which souls descended from heaven into human bodies. In astrology, with Scorpio and Pisces, it was the Watery Trigon; and has

been the Houe of the Koon, from the early belief that this luminary was located here at the creation; and the HorolOOpe of the World, as being, of all the signs, nearest to the zenith. It was one of the unfortunate signs, governing the human breast and stomach; and reigned over Scotland, Holland, Zealand, Burgundy, Africa (especially over Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis), and the cities of Constantinople and New York. In the times of Manilius'it ruled India and Aethiopia, but he termed it a fruitful sign. Its colors were green and russet; and early fable attributed its guardianship to the god Mercury, whence its title Kercurii Sidu. \Vhen the sun was within its boundaries every thunder-storm would cause commotions, famine, and locusts; and Berossos asserted that the earth was to be submerged when all the planets met in Cancer, and consumed by fire when they met in Capricorn. But this was a reversal of the astrologers' rule; for, as Pascal wrote :
They only assign good fortune with rare conjunctions of the stars, and this is how their predictions rarely fail.
It is said to have been the Akkadian Bun of the South, perhaps from its position at the winter solstice in very remote antiquity; but afterwards it was associated with the fourth month Duzu, our June-July, and was known as the llorthern Gate of the Bun, whence that luminary commences its retrograde movement. llan-garu is Strassmaier's transliteration of the
cuneiform title; others being Pllluk•tu and Xu, Division, possibly referring to the solstitial colure as a dividing line. Brown has recently claimed for it the title llag&r-111&gga, the Workmar:i of the Waterway. The early Sanskrit name was Xarka and Karkata, the Tamil Xarkatan,
and the Cingalese Xathaoa; but the later Hindus knew it as Xulira, from Kolovpor, the term originated by Proclus for our colure. The Persians had it Ohercjengh and Xalakang; the Turks, Lenkutcb ; the Syrians, and perhaps the later Chaldaeans, Sart.ono; the Hebrews,
Bat1ID; and the Arabians, Al Sarat&n, all words equivalent to Cancer. Al Biiiini added Al Lilui', the Soft Palate, but this was an early title of the Arabs in connection with their mant:'il Al llathrah.
Kircher said that in Coptic Egypt it was KAapla, the .Hestia seu Stano 7yphunis, the Power of Darkness; La Lande identifying this with Anubis, one of the divinities of the Nile country commonly associated with Sirius. But the Jews assigned it to the tribe of Issachar, whom Jacob likened to the "strong ass" that each of the Aselli represents; Dupuis asserting that these last titles were derived from this Jewish association. A Saxon chronicle of about the year 1000 had" Cancer that is Cr&bba,.;



The Constellations
Chaucer had Canan, probably a relic of Anglo-Norman days, for in his time it generally was Canaer; and Milton called it the Tropio Crab from its having marked one of these great circles. Showing but few stars, and its luada being less than a 4th-magnitude, it was the Dark Sign, quaintly described as black and without eyes. Dante, alluding to this faintness and high position in the heavens, wrote in the
Paradiso: Thereafterward a light among them brightened, So that, if Cancer one such crystal had, Winter would have a month of one sole day.
Jensen makes it the Tortoile of Babylonia, and it was so figured there and in Egypt 4000 B. c. ; although in the Egyptian records of about 2000 B. c. it was described as a Soarabaeu, sacred, as its specific name stutr signifies,
and an emblem of immortality. This was the Greek 1tdpa/Jor, with its nestball of earth in its claws, an idea which occurs again even as late as the nth century, when an illuminated astronomical manuscript shows a Wat-.erbeetle. In the Aloumasar of 1489 it is a large Crayflah; Bartschius and Lubienitzki, in the 17th century, made it into a Loblt.er, and the latter added toward Gemini a small shrimp-like object which he called Canoer minor. Caesius likened it to the Breastplate of Bighteoumeu in Ephesians vi, 14; while Praesaepe and the Aselli were the )(anger of the infant Jesus, with the Ass and Ox presumed to be standing by. Julius Schiller said that the whole represented Saint .John the Evangelist. Our figure appears on the round zodiac of Denderah, but in the location of Leo Minor. This planisphere 1 is a comparatively late sculpturing, supposed to be about 34 B. c., in the time of Tiberius and Cleopatra, possibly later; but it shows, at least in part, the heavens of many centuries previous, the exact date fixed by Biot being 700 B. c., although some scholars, notably Brugsch, carry it back a thousand years earlier and assert that it was largely copied from similar works of Sargon's time. It was discovered by the French general Desaix de Voygoux in 1799, and removed in 1820 to the Bibliotheque Imperiale in Paris, where it has since remained. Its appearance is that of a very large antique sandstone medallion, 4 feet 9 inches in diameter, contained in a square of 7 feet 9 inches. With some manifest errors, it is, nevertheless, a most interesting and much-quoted object, although not of the importance once attributed to it. Of the many en

gravings of this, the best is found in Flammarion's journal L'Astr0111J111U for September, 1888. Cancer appears on the Farnese globe underneath a quadrangular figure, in the location of our Lynx, of which I can find no explanation. In this constellation, with some slight variations as to boundaries at different times in Hindu astronomy,-'}' and 6 always being included and occasionally 'I, fJ, and Praesaepe,- was located the 6th na/ul,a/ra Puhya, Flower, or Tiabiya, Auspicious, with Brihaspati, the priest and teacher of the gods, as presiding divinity. It was sometimes figured as a Crescent, and again as the head of an Arrow; but Amara Sinha, the Sanskrit author of about 56 B. c., called it Bidhaya, Prosperous. The manzil Al ll'athrah, the Gap in the hair under the muzzle of the supposed immense ancient Lion, was chiefly formed by Praesaepe; but later on 'Y and 6 were sometimes included, when it was Al JpmiraiD, the Two Asses, a title adopted from the Greeks. The Arabs also knew it as Al Fum al Alad and as Al ADJ al Alad, the Mouth, and the Muzzle, of the Lion, both referring to the early figure. The sim Xwei, Spectre, anciently Xut, the Cloud-like, was made up , from Praesaepe with 'I and fJ, the latter most strangely selected, as it is now hardly distinguishable by the naked eye, and yet was the determining star,- perhaps a case of variation in brightness. This asterism, with Tsing in our Gemini, formed Shun Show, one of the twelve zodiacal Kung, which Williams translates as the Quail's Head, giving the modern title as Xeu Hea, the Crab ; this Quail being otherwise known as the Phoenix, Pheasant, or the• Red Bird that, with the stars of Leo and Virgo, marked the residence of the Red, or Southern, Emperor. Like Gemini and Taurus, it was shown rising backward, to which some of the ancients fancifully ascribed the slower motion of the sun in passing through these constellations, as well as its influence in producing the summer's heat; even Doctor Johnson, in Rasulas, alluded to " the fervours of 1 the crab." Very differently, however, Ampelius associated it with the cold Septentrio, or North Wind. Coins of Cos in the Aegean Sea bore the figure of a Crab that may have been for this constellation. The symbol of the sign, 2o, probably is "the remains of the representation of some such creature"; but it is also referred to the two Asses that took part in the conflict of the gods with the giants on the peninsula of the Macedonian Pallene, the early Phlegra, afterwards rewarded by a restingplace in the sky on either side of the Manger. The sun is in Cancer from the 18th of July to the 7th of August; but the

solstice, which was formerly here and gave name to the tropic, is now about 33° to the westward, near 1/ Geminorum. The celebrated Halley comet first appeared here in 1531; and in June, 1895, all the planets, except Neptune, were in this quarter of the heavens, an unusual and most interesting occurrence. Argelander catalogues 47 stars in the constellation in addition to Praesaepe; and Heis, 91.

Aaa.bem, from the Clulae 9uas A,ubmae Cnaltfai vo,ant of the Alfonsine Ta/Jks, is not Chaldaean, but from the Arabic Al Zubanih, the Claws, on the southern one of which this star lies, near the head of Hydra. Bayer repeated this in his Acuben.e and Azubene, adding Pliny's names for itAoetabula, the Ann Sockets of a crab, and Cirrol,- properly Cirrus,- the Arms themselves, equivalent to Ovid's .Flagella, which Bayer wrongly translated Scourge; others similarly saying Branohiae and Ungulae. Bayer also cited the " Barbarians' " Griveneaooa, unintelligible unless it be their form of rpaiJ,aior, a Crab. 8art&n and Sertan are from the Arabic word for the whole figure. The star ,, marking the other claw, shares in many of these titles. Some assign Al :Kama.rein to a,-an undoubted error, as Al ~imA.rain was the common Arabian term for the Aselli, 'Y and If, that the Arabic signifies. Acubens culminates on the 18th of March. The companion is 11".4 distant, at a position angle of 325°.5. /J, a 4th-magnitude, is Al ~ the End, i. e. of the southern foot on which it lies.

The Basel Lalin Almagest of 1551 says .Alinua for 'Y only, but the Alfonsine Tables and the Almagest of 1515 have Duo Alini; and the Arabians similarly knew them as Al JJimirain, the Two Asses. Bailey, in his Mysli< of 1858, calls them the Alelline Btarleta.
Manilius is supposed to allude to these outstretched stars as the 1ugalae, taken indirectly from Jugum, a Yoke, which became Jugulum, the Collar

bone,- in the plural Jugula and Jugulae; but Ideler asserted that this originated from an erroneous statement of Firmicus, and that reference was really made by the poet to the well-known Belt of Orion. Riccioli's strange title, Blnatret, doubtless was from that of the lunar mansion Al llathrah, which the Aselli and Praesaepe constituted. In astrology they were portents of violent death to such as came under their influence; while to the weather-wise their dimness was an infallible precursor of rain, on which Pliny thus enlarges:
If fog conceals the Asellus to the northeast high winds from the south may be expected, but if the southern star is concealed the wind will be from the northeast.
Our modern Weather Bureau would probably tell us that if one of these stars were thus concealed, the other also would be. Pliny mentioned them with Praesaepe as forming a constellation by themselves ; but he was given to multiplying the stellar groups. Inconspicuous though it be, the Babylonians used d to mark their 13th ecliptic constellation Arkii-tha-nangaru-tha-ehiltu, the Southeast Star in the Crab; and Brown says that the Aselli, with f/, 0, and Praesaepe, were the Akkadian Gu-thir-kee-da, the Yoke of the Enclosure. They also marked the junction of the nakshatras Puhya and .lqleahi. The following passage from Rind's Solar System in regard to d will be found interesting:
The most ancient observation of Jupiterl which we are acquainted with is that reported by Ptolemy in Book X, chap. iii, of the A lmagut, and considered by him free from all doubt. It is dated in the 83d year after the death of Alexander the Great, on the 18th of the Egyptian month Epip!,i, in the morning, when the planet eclipsed the star now kuon as d Cancri. This observation was made on September 3, B. c. 240, about 18 b on the meridian of Alexandria.
was applied by Bayer to the coarse extended cluster, N. G. C. 263:z,44 M., on the head of the Crab, composed of about 150 stars of magnitudes from
6Yz to 10, with two noticeable triangles among them. With us it is the well-known Beehive, but its history as such I have not been able to learn, although it undoubtedly is a recent designation, for nowhere is it Apiarium. Scientifically it was the NEtf>D.wv, or Little Cloud, of Hipparchos; the 'Ax.l1ir, or Little Mist, of Aratos; the NEtf>t.loEtd~r, Cloudy One, l:vaTpo<fYI/, Whirling Cloud, and llubilum, literally a Cloudy Sky, of Bayer;

but the Almagests and astronomers generally of the 16th and 17th centuries referred to it as the Nebula, and Nebulosa, in pe,ture Can,ri, for before the invention of the telescope this was the only universally recognized nebula, its components not being separately distinguishable by ordinary vision. But it seems to have been strangely regarded as three nebulous objects. Galileo, of course, was the first to resolve it, and wrote in the Nu,uius Sidereus : 1 ·
The nebula called Praesepe, which is not one star, only, but a mass of more than forty ,mall stars. I have noticed thirty stars, besides the Aselli.
Popularly it also is the ](anger, or Crib, the 4>aTV1J of Aratos and Eratosthenes ; the 4>aTV1Jt; of Ptolemy; and with the Latins, Praelaepe, Praeaaepes, Praeeaepil; Prueaepia, Praelaepium, the Alfonsine Preaepe and Bayer's Pesebre,- also the modem Spanish, - flanked by the Aselli, for whose accommodation it perhaps was invented. Bayer cited for it Kell~ which Chilmead followed with Kellef, and Riccioli with Keeleph; these from the Arabians' Al ][a'laf, the Stall; and this, in turn, derived from the Greek astronomy, for their indigenous Ma'laf was in Crater. Schickard had this as Kallephon. Brown includes t with y, d, 1/, and fJ in the Persian lunar station A:vra•k,
the Cloud, and the Coptic Ermelia, Nurturing. Tyrtaeus Theophrastus, the first botanist-author, about 300 B. c., and Aratos, described its dimness and disappearance in the progressive condensation of the atmosphere as a sure token of approaching rain; Pliny said,
If Praesaepe is not visible in a clear sky it is a presage of a violent storm ;
and Aratos in the t:uoo11μeia (the .Prugnqslua):
A murky Manger with both stars Shining unaltered is a sign of rain. If while the northern Ass is dimmed lly vaporous shroud, he of the south gleam radiant, Expect a south wind: the vaporous shroud and radiance Exchanging stars harbinger Boreas.
Weigel used it in the 17th century, in his set of heraldic signs, as the
:.anger, a fancied coat of arms for the farmers. In astrology, like all clusters, it threatened mischief and blindness. In China it was known by the unsavory title Taeih She Xe, Exhalation of Piled-up Corpses; and within 10 of it Mercury was observed from that

This lies on the rear edge of the Crab's shell, and is known as Tegmine, In the Covering; but, if the word be allowable at all, it should be Tepio, as Avienus is supposed to have had it. Id~ler, however, said that Alienus was referring to the covering shell of the marine object, and not to the stellar. This is a system of great interest to astronomers from the singular changes in color, the probable existence of a fourth and invisible component, and for the short period of orbital revolution - sixty years - of the two closer stars. The maximum of interval between these is but 1 11, the minimum o".2; yet they never close up as one star. The third member is 5" awar, and its orbital period must be at least 500 years. ~ and 0, according to Peters' investigations, probably are the objects announced by Watson as two intra-Mercurial planets, discovered(?) during the total eclipse of the sun on the 29th of July, 1878. l, of the 6th magnitude, with adjacent stars, was in China Kwan Wei, the Bright Fire.

modem forms first appear in the .Protinmrus of their inventor Hevelius. The more northern one is Aaterion, Starry, from the little stars marking the body; and the other, which contains the two brightest stars, is Chara, as Dear to the heart of her master. Flamsteed followed in the use of these names, and the Hound.I are now well established in the recognition of astronomers, as is the case with most of the stellar creations of Hevelius, which were generally placed where needed. Proctor, in his attempt to simplify constellation nomenclature, called them Oatuli, the Puppies; but the usual illustration is of two Greyhounds held by a leash in the hand of Bootes, ready for pursuit of the Bear around the pole; their inventor thus reviving the idea that Bootes was a hunter. Hevelius counted 23 stars here; Argelander, 54; and Heis, 88. The Chinese designated three stars in or near the head of Asterion as San Xmig, the Three Honorary Guardians of the Heir Apparent. Assemani alluded to a quadrate figure on the Borgian globe, below the tail of the Greater Bear, as Al Xarb al lbl, the Camel's Burden, that can be no other than stars in the heads of the Hunting Dogs. Bartschius drew on his map of this part of the sky the lliver 1ordan, his Jordania and 1ordanu, not now recognized, indeed hardly remembered. Its course was from Cor Caroli, under the Bears and above Leo, Cancer, and Gemini, through the stars from which Hevelius afterwards formed Leo Minor and the Lynx, ending at Camelopardalis. But the outlines of his stream were left somewhat undetermined, much like those of Central African waters when guessed at by map-makers thirty years or more ago. This river, however, had already existed before his day on French starmaps and -globes.

This star, the 12 of Flamsteed's list ofthe Hounds, stands alone, marking Chara's collar; but was set apart in 1725 by Halley, when Astronomer Royal, as the distinct figure Cor Caroli, not Cor Caroli II as many have it, in honor of Charles II. This was done at the suggestion of the court physician, Sir Charles Scarborough, who said that it had shone with special brilliancy on the eve of the king's return to London on the 29th of May, 166o. It has occasionally been seen on maps as the centre of a Heartshaped figure surmounted by a crown, and its name occurs in popular lists ; but Flamsteed did not insert it on his plate of the Hounds, although hP rlic:. tinctly wrote ofit in his manuscript under this title; and the Heart perhaps is shown in the tail-piece to the preface of the Atlas Dlekslis.

It is the French Oonr de Cha.rlel; the Italian Ouor di Carlo ; and the German Hen Karla. With Ulug Beg it was Al Kabel al Aaad, the Liver of the Lion,-here a technical term indicating the highest position of any star within the compass of a figure reckoned from the equator. In China it was Chang Chen, a Seat. This is a favorite object with amateur observers, the components being about 20" apart. Espin says, in Webb's Celestial Ob/e,ts of 1893, that they have been relatively fixed for seventy-three years, yet show considerable proper motion, and probably are unequal stars at nearly equal distances from us; and he gives various opinions of observers as to their colors. Miss Clerke calls them pale yellow and fawn. Their present position angle is about 230°, but is slowly changing. Cor Caroli culminates on the 20th of May. On the line from Cor Caroli to Arcturus, and somewhat nearer the latter, in a triangle of small stars, is a beautiful globular cluster concentrated into a central blaze. This is N. G. C. 5272, 3 M., long a well-known object, but recently rendered specially noticeable by Bailey's discovery in 1895, on photographs taken by Harvard astronomers at Arequipa, Peru, of no less than ninety-six _variable stars within its boundaries,- nearly ten per cent. of the whole number in the cluster distinctly photographed: the usual proportion of variables among the naked-eye stars is not quite one per cent. The stars near the centre run together and cannot be counted, but the total number in the cluster probably is many thousands. ' {J, 4.3, is Chara, the 8 of Flamsteed, and, after Cor Caroli, the brightest member of the Southern Hound.

La Superb& was so named by Father Secchi from the superbly flashing brilliancy of its prismatic rays. It is the brightest of its class of stars with spectra of the 4th type, of which only about 120 are known from our lati• tude, and but seven or eight of these visible to the naked eye. Variability in its light is also suspected. It lies about 7° north and 2,1⁄4 0 west of Cor Caroli.

of the southern heavens, and thus Canil A111tralior, lies immediately to the southeast of Orion, cut through its centre by the Tropic of Capricorn, and with its eastern edge on the Milky Way. It is Oa.ne ][aggiore in Italy; 0181 in Portugal; Grand Chien in France; and Groaae Hund in Germany. In early classical days it was simple Ca.nil, representing Laelaps, the hound of Actaeon, or that of Diana's nymph Procris, or the one given to Cephalus by Aurora and famed for the speed that so gratified Jove as to cause its transfer to the sky. But from the earliest times it also has been the Dog of Orion to which Aratos alluded in the .Prognoslica, and thus wrote of in the Pllainomma in connection with the Hare:
The constant Scorcher comes as in pursuit, . . . and rises with it and its setting spies.
Homer made much of it as Kvwv, but his Dog doubtless was limited to the star Sirius, as among the ancients generally till, at some unknown date, the constellation was formed as we have it,-indeed till long afterwards, for we find many allusions to the Dog in which we are uncertain whether the constellation or its lueida is referred to. Hesiod and Aratos gave this title, both also saying '!.e{p,o<;, and the latter μfya,;; but by this adjective he designed only to characterize the brilliancy of the star, and not to distinguish it from the Lesser Dog. The Greeks did not know the two Dogs
thus, nor did the comparison appear till the days of the Roman Vitruvius.

Ptolemy and his countrymen knew it by Homer's title, and often as A<1Tpo1evwv, although it seems singular that the former never used the word l'.elpio~.
The Latins adopted their Canis from the Greeks, and it has since always borne this name, sometimes even Canicula in the diminutive (with the adjectival candens, shining), Erigonae111, and Ioariua; the last two being from the fable of the dog Maera,- which itself means Shining,- transported here; her mistress Erigone having been transformed into Virgo, and her • master Icarius into Bootes. Ovid alluded to this in his Icarii stel/a proterva canis; and Statius mentioned the Icarium utrum, although Hyginus had ascribed this to the Lesser Dog. Sirion and Syriua occasionally appeared with the best Latin authors; and the Alfonsiru Tables of 1521 had Cani1 Byriua. Vergil brought it into the 1st Georgie as a calendar sign,
adverso cedens Canis occidit astro,
instructing the farmer to sow his beans, lucerne, and millet at its heliacal setting on the 1st of May; the adverso here generally being referred to the well-known reversed position of the figure of Taurus, but may have been intended to indicate the hostility of the Bull to the Giant's Dog that was attacking him. Cu1to1 Europa.e is in allusion to the story of the Bull who, notwithstanding the Dog's watchfulness, carried off that maiden ; and lanitor Lethaeus, the Keeper of Hell, makes him a southern Cerberus, the watch-dog of the lower heavens, which in early mythology were regarded as the abode of demons: a title more appropriate here than for the so-named modern group in the northern, or upper, sky. Bayer erroneously quoted as proper names Dexter, J[agn111, and Seound111, while others had Alter and Sequens; but these originally were designed only to indicate the Dog's position, size, and order of rising with regard to his lesser companion. The aestifer of Cicero and Vergil referred to its bright Sirius as the cause of the summer's heat, which also induced Horace's invidum agricolis; and Bayer's 'Topo¢o{3ia was from the absurd notion, prevalent then as now, of the occurrence of canine madness solely during the heat from the Dog-star: an idea first seen with Asclepiades of the 3d century before Christ. Or it may have come from being confounded by Bayer, none too careful a compiler, with the 'Topaywy6v, which Plutarch applied to Sirius in his De Isidoro, signifying the Water-bringer, i.e. the cause of the Nile flood.



The Constellations 119
Aratos termed the constellation rrouilloc;, as of varying brightness in its different parts; or mottled-the Dog, lying in as well as out of the Milky Way, being thus diversified in light. In early Arabia, as indee<l everywhere, it took titles from its ludda, although strangely corrupted from the original Al Shi'ri al 'Abiir al YamaDiyyah, the Brightly Shining Star of Passage of Yemen, in the direction of which province it set. Among these we see, in the Lati11 Almagest of 1515, "canu: ti" est uehere, alahabor aliemenia"; in the edition of 1551, Elacbeere; in Bayer's Uranometria, Elleiri (which Grotius derived from aeiptoc;), Bllere, 8ceara, 8cera, Soheereliemini; in Chilmead's Treatise, Alaa·
hare aliemalija; and Elchabar, which La Lande, in his l'Aslronomit, not unreasonably derived from AI Kabir, the Great. The Arabian astronomers called it Al Kalb al Akbar, the Greater Dog, so following the Latins, Chilmead writing it Alcheleb Alachbar; and Al Birimi quoted their Al Kalb al J'abbir, the Dog of the Giant, directly from the Greek conception of the figure. Similarly it was the Persians' Xelbo Oavoro.
It was, of course, important in Euphratean astronomy, and is shown on remains from the temples and mounds, variously pictured, but often just as Aratos described it and as drawn on maps of the present day,-standing on the hind feet, watching or springing after the Hare. Professor Young describes the figure as one " who sits up watching his master Orion, but with an eye out for Lepus." Bayer and Flamsteed alone among its illustrators showed it as a typical bulldog. A Dog, presumably this with another adjacent, is represented on an ivory disc found by Schliemann on his supposed site of Troy; and an Etruscan mirror of unknown age bears it with Orion, Lepus, the crescent moon, and correctly located neighboring stars. While both of the Dogs, the Dragon, Fishes, Swan, Perseus, the Twins, Orion, and the Hare are described as on the Shield of Hercules in the old poem of that title generally attributed to Hesiod. The Hindus knew it as llrigavyidha, the Deerslayer, and as Lubdha.ka, the Hunter, who shot the arrow, our Belt of Orion, into the infamous Praja-pil.ti, where it even now is seen sticking in his body; and, much earlier still, with their prehistoric predecessors it waS" San.mi, one of the Twin Watch-dogs of the Milky Way. Among northern nations it was Greip, the dog in the myth of Sigurd. All of these doubtless referred solely to Sirius. ~ovidius, who imagined biblical significance in every starry group, said that this was the Dog of Tobiu in the Book of To/Jil, v, 16, which Moxon

Siriua, the Dog.atar, often written Syriua even as late as Flamsteed's and Father Hell's day, has generally been derived from t1tipio<;, sparkling or scorching, which first appeared with Hesiod as a title for this star, although also applied to the sun, and by Abychos to all the stars. Various early Greek authors used it for our Sirius, perhaps generally as an adjective, for we read in Eratosthenes:
Such stars astronomers call 11£1piot~ on account of the tremulous motion of their light;
so that it would seem that the word, in its forms t1tdp, t1ti~, and otipux;,Suidas used all three for both sun and star,- originally was employed to indicate any bright and sparkling heavenly object, but in the course of time became a proper name for this brightest of all the stars. Lamb, however, thought it of Phoenician origin, signifying the Chief One, and originally in that country a title for the sun; Jacob Bryant, the mythologist, said that it was from the Egyptians' Cahen Sihor; but Brown considers it a transscription from their well-known B:emi, the Greek Oairia; while Dupuis distinctly asserted that it was from the Celtic Syr, Plutarch called it Ilpo6rrr77<;, the Leader,which well agrees with its character and is an almost exact translation of its Euphratean, Persian, Phoenician, and Vedic titles; but Kvwv, Kvwv t1Eipto<;, Kvwv dt1rftp, l:.tlpto<; dtirftp, Itipwv ,forpov, or simply To a<1Tpov, were its names in early Greek astronomy and poetry. 1Ipo11:vwv, better known for the Lesser Dog and its ludda, also was applied to Sirius by Galen as preceding the other stars in the constellation. Homer alluded to it in the Iliad as 'Orrwptv6,;, the Star of Autumn; 1 but the season intended was the last days of July, all of August, and part of September- the latter part of summer. Lord Derby translated this cele
brated passage :
A fiery light There ftash'd, like autumn's star, that brightest shines When newly risen from his ocean bath;
1 The Greeks had no word exactly equivalent to our "autumn" until the 5th century before Christ, when it appeared in writings ascribed to Hippocrates.

The Roman farmers sacrificed to it a fawn-colored dog at their three festivals when, in May, the sun began to approach Sirius. These, instituted 238 B. c., were the Robigalia, to secure the propitious influence of their goddess Robigo in averting rust and mildew from their fields; and the Floralia and Vinalia, to ensure the maturity of their blooming flowers, fruits and grapes. Among the Latins it naturally shared the constellation's titles, probably originated them; and occasionally was even Canioula; indeed, as late as 1.po the Palladium of Husbandry urged certain farm-work to be done "Er the caniculere, the hounde ascende"; and, more than a century later, Eden, in the Hislorie of tire Vyage to .Moseovie and Cathay, wrote: "Beri111 is otherwise cauled Canicula, this is the dogge, of whom the canicular dayes have theyr name." It has been asserted that Ovid and Vergil referred to Sirius in their
Latrator Anubia, representing a jackal- or dog-headed Egyptian divinity, guardian of the visible horizon and of the solstices, transferred to Rome as goddess of the chase; but it is very doubtful whether they had in mind either star or constellation. Its well-known name, Al Bbi'ri, or Al Bi'ri, extended as al 'A.bur al YamaniJJ&b, much resembles the Egyptian, Persian, Phoenician, Greek, 1nd Roman equivalents, and, Ideler thought, may have had common origin \\;th them from some one ancient source: possibly the Sanskrit Surya, the Shining One,- the Sun. The 'Abur, or Passage, refers to the myth of Canopus' flight to the South; and the adjective to the same, or perhaps to the southerly position of the star towards Yemen, in distinction from that of AI Ghuma~• in the Lesser Dog, seen towards Sham,-Syria,-in the :\orth. From these geographical names originated the Arabic adjectives Yamaniyyah and Shamaliyyah, Southern and Northern; although the former literally signifies On the Right-hand Side, i. e. to an observer facing eastward towards Mecca. In Chrysococca's Tables the title is I.taf/p Ia,-wvi); and Doctor C.

queerly corrupted form, is found in Eber's Egyptian .Princess. In the Alfonsine Tables the original is changed to Aaooher and Alchere Aliemini; while Bayer gives plain Alchere and Elacheere for the star, with others similar for both star and constellation. Boera is cited by Grotius for the star, and Sceara for the whole, derived from an old lexicon; and Alaere; but he traced all to l:Eip,~. In modem Arabia it is Suhail, the general designation for bright stars. The late Finnish poet Zakris Topelius accounted for the exceptional magnitude of Sirius by the fact that the lovers Zulamith the Bold and Salami the Fair, after a thousand years of separation and toil while building their bridge, the Milky Way, upon meeting at its completion,
Straight rushed into each other's arms And melted into one ; So they became the brightest star In heaven's high arch that dwelt Great Sirius, the mighty Sun Beneath Orion'.s belt.
The native Australians knew it as their Eagle, a constellation by itself: while the Hervey Islanders, calling it llere, associated it in their folk-lore with Aldebaran and the Pleiades. Sharing the Sanskrit titles for the whole, it was the DeeNlayer and the Hunter, while the Vedas also have for it Tilhiya or Tiahiga, Tiatrija, Tish· trya, the Tiltar, or Chief'tain'1, Star. And this we find too in Persia; as also Sira. The later Persian and Pahlavi have Tir, the Arrow. Edkins, however, considers Sirius, or Procyon, to be Vanand, and Arcturus, Tistar. Hewitt sees in Sirius the Sivinam, or Dog, of the Rig Veda awakening the Ribhus, the gods of mid-air, who " thus calls them to their office of rain sending," a very different office from that assigned to this star in Rome. Yet these gods, philologically, had a Roman connection, for Professor Fried• rich Maximilian Mueller, writing the word Arbhu, associates it with the Latin Orpheus. Hewitt also says that in the earliest Hindu mythology Sirius was Sukra, the Rain-god, before Indra was thus known; and that in the Avesta it marked one of the Four Quarters of the Heavens. Although the identification of Euphratean stellar titles is by no means settled, especially and singularly so as to this great star, yet various authorities have found for it names more or less probable. Bertin and Brown think it conclusively proved that it was Kat-ehilha. the Dog that Leads, and " a Star of the South " ; while Xak-■hidi is Sayce's transliteration of the original signifying the Creator of Prosperity, a character which the Persians also assigned to it; and it may have been the Akka

dian Du.ahiaha, the Director - in Assyrian Ke1-ri-e. Epping and Strassmaier have Kat-ban as a late Chaldaean title, which Brown renders Kal•bu, the Dog, " exactly the name for Sirius we should expect to find "; Jensen has Xakkab lik-ku, the Star of the Dog, revived in Homer's &vwv; and it perhaps was the Assyrian Kai-bu Sa-mu, the Dog of the Sun ; and the Akkadian Kul-lik-ud, the Star Dog of the Sun. Jensen also gives Kakbb bati, the Bow Star, although this may be doubtful; and Brown has, from the Assyrian, Su·b-du, the Restless, Impetuous, Blazing, well characterizing the marked scintillation and color changes in its light. Hewitt cites an Akkadian title Tu-khu. Its risings and settings were regularly tabulated in Chaldaea about 300 e. c., and Oppert is reported to have recently said that the Babylonian astronomers could not have known certain astronomical periods, which as a matter of fact they did know, if they had not observed Sirius from the island of Zylos in the Persian Gulf on Thursday, the 29th of April, 11542 B. C.! It is the only star known to us with absolute certitude in the Egyptian records- its hieroglyph, a dog, often appearing on the monuments and temple walls throughout the Nile country. Its worship, chiefly in the north, perhaps, did not commence till about 3285 B. c., when its heliacal rising at the summer solstice marked Egypt's New Year and the beginning of the inundation, although precession has now carried this rising to the 10th of August. At that early date, according to Lockyer, Sirius had replaced ')' Draconis as an orientation point, especially at Thebes, and notably in the great temple of Queen Hatshepsu, known to-day as Al Der al Bahari, the Arabs' translation of the modern Copts' Convent of the North. Here it 11as symbolized, under the title of Iai■ liathor, by the form of a cow with disc and horns appearing from behind the western hills. With the same title, and styled Her Kaje■ty of Denderah, it is seen in the small temple of Isis, erected 700 B. c., which was oriented toward it; as well as on the walls of the great Memnonium, the Ramesseum, of Al ~urneh at Thebes, probably erected about the same time that this star's worship began. Lockyer thinks that he has found seven temples oriented to the rising of Sirius. It is also represented on the walls of the recently discovered stepttmple of Sa~~ara, dating from about 2700 B. c., and supposed to have lieen erected in its honor. Great prominence is given to it on the square zodiac of Denderah, where it is figured as a cow recumbent in a boat with head surmounted by a star; and again, immediately following, as the goddess Sothil, accompanied by the goddess Anget, with two urns from which water is flowing, emblematic



124 Star-Names and their Meanings
of the inundation at the rising of the star. But in the earlier temple service of Denderah it was Im Bothia, at Philae Im Bati, or Ba.tit, and, for a Jong time in Egypt's mythology, the resting-place of the soul of that goddess, and thus a favorable star. Plutarch made distinct reference to this; although it should be noted that the word Isis at times also indicated anything luminous to the eastward heralding sunrise. Later it was Oairil, brother and husband of Isis, but this word also Was applied to any celestial body becoming invisible by its setting. Thus its titles noticeably changed in the long period of Egypt's history. As Thoth, and the most prominent stellar object in the worship of that country,-its heliacal rising was in the month of Thoth,-it was in some way associated with the similarly prominent sacred ibis, also a symbol of Isis and Thoth, for, in various forms, the bird and star appear together on Nile monuments, temple walls, and zodiacs. Sirius was worshiped, too, as Bihor, the Nile Star, and, even more commonly, as Bothi and Bothia, its popular Graeco-Egyptian name, the Brightly Radiating One, the Fair Star of the Waten; but in the vernacular was Sept, Bepet, Bopet, and Bopdit; Bed,1 and Bot,- the l:~8 of Vettius Valens_
Upon this star was laid the foundation of the Canicular, Sothic, or Sothiac Period named after it, which has excited the attention and puzzled the minds of historians, antiquarians, and chronologists. Lockyer has an admirable discussion of this in his Dawn 1Jj AsfrOflQmy. Sir Edwin Arnold writes of it in his Egyptian .Princess:
And even when the Star of Kneph has brought the summer round, And the Nile rises fast and full along the thirsty ground;
for the Egyptians always attributed to the Dog-star the beneficial influence of the inundation that began at the summer solstice; indeed, some have said that the Aethiopian Nile took from Sirius its name Siris, although others consider the reverse to be the case. Minsheu, who dwells much on this, ends thus: "Some thinke that the Dog-starre is called Sirius, because ol the time the Dogge-starre reigruth, -Nilus also overftowetl, as though the water were led by that Starre." Indeed, it has been fancifully asserted that its canine title originated in Egypt, " because of its supposed watchful care over the interests of the husbandman; its rising giving him notice of the approaching overflow of the Nile." Caesius cited for it Bolechin as from that country, signifying the Starry , Dog, and derived from the Egypto-Greek word ~olEa:~v.
lAccording to Mueller, this Sed, or Shed, of the hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared in Hebrew as El Shaddar.

Perhaps it is the ancient importance of this Dog on the Nile that has given the popular name, the Emtian X, to the figure formed by the stars Procyon and Betelgeuze, Naos and Phaet, with Sirius at the vertices of the two triangles and the centre of the letter. On our maps Sirius marks the nose of the Dog. The Phoenicians are said to have known it as Hannabeah, the Barker. The astronomers of China do not seem to have made as much of Sirius as did those of other countries, but it is occasionally mentioned, with other stars in Canis Major, as Lang Hoo; and Reeves quoted for it Taeen Lang, the Heavenly Wolf. Their astrologers said that when unusually bright it portended attacks from thieves. Some have called it the Kuziroth of the Book of Job; others the H·&fil of the Hebrews ; but this people also knew it as Sihor, its Egyptian name, and ldeler thinks that the adoration of the S•erim, or " Devils" of the Authorized Version of our Bible, the" He Goats" of the Revision, which, as we see in .Levitieus xvii, 7, was specially prohibited to the Jews, may have had reference to Sirius and Procyon, the Two Sirii or Shi'rayin, that must have been well known to them in the land of their long bondage as worshiped by their taskmasters. The culmination of this star at midnight was celebrated in the great temple of Ceres at Eleusis, probably at the initiation of the Eleusinian mysteries; and the Ceans of the Cyclades predicted from its appearance at its heliacal rising whether the ensuing year would be healthy or the reverse. In Arabia, too, it was an object of veneration, especially by the tribe of }::.ais, and probably by that of Kodhii.'a, although Mul].ammii.d expressly forbade this star-worship on the part of his followers. Yet he himself gave much honor to some " star" in the heavens that may have been this. In early astrology and poetry there is no end to the evil influences that were attributed to Sirius. Homer wrote, in Lord Derby's translation,
The brightest he, but sign to mortal man Of evil augury.
Pope's very liberal version of the same lines,
Terrific glory ! for his burning breath Taints the red air with fevers, plagues and death,
~ms to have been taken from the Sluplteard's Kalendar for July:
The rampant Lyon hunts he fast with dogge of noysome breath Whose balefull barking brings in hast pyne, plagues and dreerye death.
Spenser, however, was equally a borrower, for we find in the Aeneid:

and in the 4th Georgie:
Jam rapidus torrens sitientes Sirius lndos Ardebat coelo,
rendered by Owen Meredith in his Paraphrase on Vergil's Bees of Aris
taeus: Swift Sirius, scorching thirsty Ind, Was hot in heaven.
Hesiod advised his country neighbors, " When Sirius parches head and knees, and the body is dried up by reason of heat, then sit in the shade and drink,"- advice universally followed, even till now, although with but little thought of Sirius. Hippocrates made much, in his Epidemics and Aphorisms, of this star's power over the weather, and the consequent physical effect upon mankind, some of his theories being current in Italy even during the last century; while the result of all physic depended upon the sign of the zodiac in which the sun chanced to be. Manilius wrote of Sirius: from his nature flow The most afflicting powers that rnle below.
But these expressions as to the hateful character of the Dog-star may have been induced in part from the evil reputation of the dog in the East. Its heliacal rising, 400 years before our era, corresponded with the sun's entrance into the constellation Leo, that marked the hottest time of the year, and this observation, originally from Egypt, taken on trust by the Romans, who were not proficient observers, and without consideration as to its correctness for their age and country, gave rise to their tlus ca11iculariae, the dog days, and the association of the celestial Dog and Lion with the heat of midsummer. The time and duration of these days, although not generally agreed upon in ancient times, any more than in modem, were commonly considered as beginning on the 3d of July and ending on the 11th of August, for such were the time and period of the unhealthy season of Italy, and all attributed to Sirius. The Greeks, however, generally assigned fifty days to the influence of the Dog-star. Yet even then some took a more correct view of the matter, for Geminos wrote :
It is generally believed that Sirius produces the heat of the dog days ; but this is an error, for the star merely marks a season of the year when the sun's heat is the greatest.
But he was an astronomer.



The Constellations 127
The idea prevailed, however, even with the sensible Dante in his " great scourge of days canicular" ; while Milton, in Lyddas, designated it as "the swart star." And the notion holds good with many even to the present time. This character doubtless is indicated on the Farnese globe, where the Dog's head is surrounded with sun-rays. But Pliny took a kinder view of this star, as in the "xii. chapyture of the xi. booke of his naturall hystorie," on the origin of honey:
This coometh from the ayer at the rysynge of certeyne starres, and especially at the rysynge of Sirius, and not before the rysynge of Vergiliae (which are the seven starres cauled Plriades) in the sprynge of the day;
although he seems to be in doubt whether "this bee the swette of heaven, or as it were a certeyne spetty] of the starres." This idea is first seen in Aristotle's History of Animals. So, too, in late astrology wealth and renown were the happy lot of all born under this and its companion Dog. Our modern Willis wrote in his Scholar of Tltel,d !,en Khora/:
Mild Sirius tinct with dewy violet, Set like a flower upon the breast of Eve.
When in opposition Sirius was supposed to produce the cold of winter. It has been in all history the brightest star in the heavens, thought worthy by Pliny of a place by itself among the constellations, and even seen in broad sunshine with the naked eye by Bond at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and by others at midday with very slight optical aid; but its color is believed by many to have changed from red to its present white. This question recently has been discussed, by See in the affirmative and Schiaparelli in the negative, at a length not allowing repetition here, the weight of argument, however, seeming to be against the admission of any change of color in historic times. Aratos' term -rro,dlor;, applied to the Dog, is equally appropriate to Sirius now in the sense of many-colored or changeful, and is an admirable characterization, as one realizes wl\en watching this magnificent object coming up from the horizon on a winter evening. Tennyson, who is always correct as well as poetical in his astronomical allusions, says in Tiu .Princess: · the fiery Sirius alters hue And bickers into red and emerald;
this, of course, being largely due to its marked scintillation ; and Arag0 gave ~ as an Arabic designation for Sirius, meaning Of a Thousand

Colors; and said that as many as thirty changes of hue in a second had been observed in it.I Sirius, notwithstanding its brilliancy, is by no means the nearest star to our system, although it is among the nearest; only two or three others having,'so far as is yet known, a smaller distance. Investigations up to the present time show a parallax of o".39, indicating a distance of 8.3 light years, nearly twice that of a Centauri.
Some are of the opinion that the apparent magnitude of Sirius is partly due to the whiteness of its tint and its greater intrinsic brilliancy; and that the red stars, Aldebaran, Betelgeuze, and others, would appear much brighter than now if of the same color as Sirius; rays of red light affecting the retina of the eye more slowly than those of other colors. The modem
scale of magnitud~ that makes this star -1.43,-about 93⁄4 times as bright as the standard 1st-magnitude star Altair (a Aquilae),- would make the sun -25.4, or 7000 million times as bright as Sirius; but, taking distance into account, we find that Sirius is really forty times brighter than the sun. Its spectrum, as type of the Sirian in distinction from the Solar, gives name to one of the four general divisions of stellar spectra instituted by Secchi from his observations in 1863-67; these two divisions including
nearly -H- of the observed stars. Of these about one half are Sirian of a
brilliantly white colour, sometimes inclining towards a steely blue. The sign manual of hydrogen is stamped upon them with extraordinary intensity
by broad, dark shaded lines which form a regular series. It is found by Vogel to be approaching our system at the rate of nearly ten miles a second, and, since Rome was built, has changed its position by somewhat more than the angular diameter of the moon. · It culminates on the 11th of February. The celebrated Kant thought that Sirius was the central sun of the Milky Way; and, eighteen centuries before him, the poet Manilius said that it was " a distant sun to illuminate remote bodies," showing that even at that early day some had knowledge of the true character and office of the stars. Certain peculiarities in the motion of Sirius led Bessel in 1884, after ten years of observation, to the belief that it had an obscure companion with which it was in revolution; and computations by Peters and Auwers led Safford to locating the position of the satellite, where it was found as pre

dieted on the 31st of January, 1862, by the late Alvan G. Clark,1 at Cambridgeport, Mass., while testing the 181⁄2-inch glass now at the Dearborn Observatory. It proved to be a yellowish star, estimated as of the 81⁄2 magnitude, but difficult to be seen because of the brilliancy of Sirius, and then 1011 away; this diminishing to 5" in 1889; and last seen and measured by Burnham at the Lick Observatory before its final disappearance in April, 1890. Its reappearance was observed from the same place in the autumn of 1896 at a distance of 3".7, with a position angle of 195°. It has a
period of 51 .1⁄4 years, and an orbit whose diameter is between those of
l'ranus and Neptune; its mass being 1⁄4 that of Sirius and equal to that of our sun, although its light is but 1 o1⁄4o O of that of its principal. So that it may be supposed to be approaching non-luminous solidity,- one of Bessel's "dark stars." It is remarkable that Voltaire in his Micromegas of 1752, an imitation of Gulliver's Travels, followed Dean Swift's so-called prophetic discovery of the two moons of Mars by a similar discovery of an immense satellite of Sirius, the home of his hero. Swift, however, owed his inspiration to Kepler, who more than a century previously wrote to Galileo:
I am so far from disbelieving in the existence of the four circumjovial planets, that I long for a telescope to anticipate you, if possible, in discovering two round Mars (as tb.prnportion seems to me to require), six or eight round Saturn, and perhaps one each round Mercury and Venus.
Other stars are shown by the largest glasses in the immediate vicinity of Sirius, two additional having very recently been discovered by Barnard at the Yerkes Observatory.

Xunim, generally but less correctly lfirzam, and occasionally )(ina, is from Al Klll'lim,2 the Announcer, often combined by the Arabs with /3 Canis Minoris in the plural Al Jlinamini, or as Al Kirzami al Shi'rayain, the two Sirian Announcers; Ideler's idea of the applicability of this title be:ng that this star announced the immediate rising of the still brighter :-irius.

Aludra is from Al 'Aclhri, the singular of Al 'Adhiri, and one of that group. This title has been universal from the days of Arabian catalogues and globes to our modem lists.

To this last from the time of Vitruvius, (JCrhaps before him, the Romans added various adjectives; septmlrio11alis, from its more northerly position than that of Canis Major; minor, minusm/11s, and parv11s, in reference to its inferior brightness; primus, as rising

as tl\ough it were the Canioula, and he was followed by others in this: indeed, Pliny began the dog days with its heliacal rising on the 19th of July, and strangely said that the Romans had no other name for it. With mythologists it was Actaeon's dog, or one of Diana's, or the Egyptian Anubis; but popularly Orion'■ 2d Hound, often called Cani■ OriODia, and thus confounded as in other ways with the Sirian asterism. Hyginu, had Ioarium Aatrum, referring to the dog Maera; Caesius, Brigoni1II an<l Canis virgineu■ of the same story, but identified by Ovid with Canis Major: and Finnicus, Argion, that perhaps was for Ulixes' dog •Apy<X;. It also was considered as representing Helen's favorite, lost in the Euripus, that she prayed Jove might live again in the sky. It shared its companion's much mixed, degenerate nomenclature, as in the 1515 Almagest's "Antecedens Canis el est Al■ehere Aloemie Algameill "; while the industrious Bayer as usual had some strange names for it. Among these are Fovea, a Pit, that Caesius commented much upon, but little to our enlightenment; and IvtCdμtvot;, or llorua, the Sycamine tree, the equil'alent of one of its Arabic titles. His Aachemie and Aachere, as well a, Chilmead's Ahah&Mt al■emalija, and mongrel words from the foregoing Almagest, etc., can all be detected in their original Al Shi'ri al Shimiyyah. the Bright Star of Syria, thus named because it disappeared from the Arabs' view at its setting beyond that country. We also find Al lummaizi, their Sycamine, although some say that this should be Al Ghumaifi', the Dim, Watery-eyed, or Weeping One; either from the fact that her light was dimmer than that of her sister Al Shi'ra, or from the fable connected with Suhail and his marriage to Al Jauzah and subsequent flight, followed by Al Shi'ra below the Milky Way, where she remained, the other sister, Al Ghumai~a·, being left in tears in her accustomed place, or it may be from a recollection of the Euphratean title for Procyon,-the Water-dog. Bayer wrote the word Algomeia; Riccioli, Algomi■a and Algomiza; and others, Algomey■a, Algomy■o, Alchamilo, etc. Thus the Two Dog-stars were the Arabs' Al Aliawit al Suhail, the Sisters

of Canopus. Still another derivation of the name is from Al Ghamu, the Puppy; but this probably was a later idea from the Romans. Also borrowing from them, the Arabians called it Al Kalb al Alghar, the Lesser Dog,- Chilmead's .Aloheleb Alugar, Riccioli's Xelbelugua.r,and Al Kalb al Kut&Jputclim, the Preceding Dog.
In Canis Minor lay a part of Al Dhiri' al A.ad al Ka~bu4ab, the Contracted Fore Ann, or Paw, of the early Lion; the other, the Extended Paw, running up into the heads ·of Gemini. Like its greater neighbor, Procyon foretold wealth and renown, and in all astrology has been much regarded. Leonard Digges 1 wrote in his Prognoslieation Everlasting of .Right Good Effect, an almanac for 1553,
Who learned in matters astronomical, noteth not the great effects at the rising of the starre called the Lite! Dogge.
Caesius made it the Dog of Tobias, in the Apocrypha, that Novidius had claimed for Canis Major; but Julius Schiller imagined it the Puchal Lamb. Who traced out the original outlines of Canis Minor, and what these outlines were, is uncertain, for the constellation with Ptolemy contained but two recorded stars, and no 'aμ6pq,wrot; and even now Argelander's map shows only 15, although Heis has 37, and Gould 51. Canis Minor lies to the southeast from the feet of Gemini, its western border over the edge of the Milky Way, and is separated by Monoceros from Canis Major and Argo.

Proqon, varied by Procion and Prochion,- IIpo~vwv in the original,has been the name for this from the earliest Greek records, distinctly mentioned by Aratos and Ptolemy, and so known by all the Latins, with the equivalent Antecanil. Ulug Beg designated it as Al Bhi'ri al Bhimiyyah, shortened to Al Shimiff&h; Chrysococca transcribing this into his Low Greek 1:.ta~p l:.ta/L1/, and Riccioli into Biair Siami; all of these agreeing with its occasional English title the Northern Biri111, TheAlfonsine Tables of 1521 quote it as Alchere, Alohemie d Algomeyaa; those of 1545, as prochion & Algomeyla. It thus has many of its constellation's names; in fact, being the magna jars of it, probably itself bore them before the constellation was formed.
I It was this Digges who, nearly fifty years before Galileo, wrote of the telescope as though it were an instrument with which he was familiar,- perhaps from Roger Bacon's writings or 350 years before him.

Jacob Bryant insisted that its title came to Greece from the Egyptian Par Callen.
Euphratean scholars identify it with the Kaktab Pa1dara, Pa1lib, or Palura of the cylinders, the Star of the Crossing of the Water-dog, a title evidently given with some reference to the River of Heaven, the adjacent Milky Way; and Hommel says that it was the Xat1hiaha which the majority of scholars apply to Sirius. Dupuis said that in Hindu fables it was Singe Hu:aaat; and Edkins that it, or Sirius, was the Persian V&ll&DIL
Reeves' Chinese list gives it as •u Ho, the Southern River, in which J
and 1/ were included. With the natives of the Hervey Islands it was their goddess Veu. In astrology, like its constellation, it portended wealth, fame, and good fortune. Procyon culminates on the 24th of February. Elkin determined its parallax as o".341, making its distance from our
system about 91⁄4 light years; and, according to Vogel, it is approaching us at a speed of nearly six miles a second. Gould thinks it slightly variable. Its spectrum is on the border between Solar and Sirian. It is attended by several minute companions that have long been known; but in November, 1896, Schaeberle of the Lick Observatory discovered a 13th-magnitude yellowish companion, about 411.6 away, at a position angle of 3180.8, that may be the one predicted by Bessel in 1844 as explaining iL~ peculiar motion,- a motion resembling that of Sirius, which astronomers had found to be moving in an oval orbit entirely unexplained until the discovery of its companion by Alvan G. Clark in 1862. Barnard, at the Yerkes Observatory in 1898, makes the close companion of Procyon 4".83 away, at a position angle of 326°. The period of revolution of this most magnificent system is about forty years, in an orbit slightly greater than that of Uranus, the combined mass being about six times that of our sun and earth, and the mass of the com· panion equaling that of our sun. Its light is three times greater.

next to the eastward from Sagittarius, is our Caprioom, the French Oaprioome, the Italian Caprioomo, and the German Steinbock,- Stone-buck, or Ibex,- the Anglo-Saxon Buoca and Buocan Hom, The common Latin name was varied by the Caper of Ausonius, fluu1 Caper of Manilius, HirCUI oorniger of Vergil, hiroinu■ Sidu■ of Prudens, Capra and aequoril lliro1ll, the Sea Goat; while Minsheu's "Capra ii/a Amalthea" indicates that it was identified by some with the goat usually assigned to Auriga. All this, doubtless, was from oriental legends, perhaps very ancient, which made Capricorn the nurse of the youthful sun-god that long anticipated the story of the infant Jupiter and Amalthea. The Latin poets also designated it as l!Jeptuni prole■, Neptune's offspring; Pelagi Procell&, the Ocean Storm; Imbrifer, the Rain-bringing One; Signum hiemale, and Gelidu■, because then at the winter solstice, the equivalent 'A.IJaA.mk appearing with the Greeks, which Riccioli repeated as Athalpil.

The Arabo-Lalin Almagest of 1515 turned this into Aloauaar111, explained by habe11s cor11ua hirci; and Bayer mentioned

Alantaru. Eratosthenes knew it as Da11 and 'Aiyi-Dii11, the Goat-Footed Pan, half fishified, Smyth said, by his plunge into the Nile in a panic at the approach of the monster Typhon ; the same story being told of Bacchus, so that he, too, always was associated with its stars.
In Persia it was Buhpli, Babi or Vahit, and Ooi; in the Pahlal'i tongue, lfahi; in Turkey, Vghlalt; in Syria, Gadjo; and in Arabia, Al ladJ, usually written by us CHedi; all meaning the Goat, or, in the latter country, the Badan, or Ibex, known to zoologists as Capra kden. Burritt's Tower of Gael, at first sight presumably Hebrew, would seem rather to be a bungled translation 1 from tile Arabic, and in no way connected with the Jewish tribe. Riccioli had Blgecli, Blgeucli, and Gaclio. Very frequent mention was made of this constellation in early days, for the Platonists held that the souls of men, when released from corporeity, ascended to heaven through its stars, whence it was called the Oate of the Goda; their road of descent having been through Cancer. But some of the Orientals knew it as the Southern Oate of the Bun, as did the Latins in their altera Bolia Porta. Berc.ssos is reported by Seneca to have learned from the old books of Sargon 2 that the world would be destroyed by a great conflagration when all the planets met in this sign. Numa Pompilius, the second mythical king of Rome, whose date has been asserted as from 715 to 673 B. c., began the year when the sun was in the middle of Capricorn, and when the day had lengthened by half an hour after the winter solstice. In astrology, with Taurus and Virgo, it was the Barthly TrigOD, and black, russet, or a swarthy brown, was the color assigned to it; while, with Aquarius, it was the Houe of Saturn, as that planet was created in this constellation, and whenever here had great influence over human affairs ; as Alchabitus asserted, in the Ysagogims of 1485, caput ti peJts ha/Jet; and it always governed the thighs and knees. It also was regarded as under the care of the goddess Vesta, and hence Veatae Bid111. Ampelius singularly associated it with the burning south wind Auster, and Manilius said that it reigned over France, Germany, and Spain; in later times it ruled Greece, India, Macedonia, and Thrace, Brandenburg and Mecklen•
I The Arabic word B11,j signifies both Constellation and Tower, or Fortress. 2 This Sargon has been considered the almost mythical founder of the first Semitic empir<', 3850 B. c., but inscriptions recently unearthed at Nuffar, and only deciphered in 18g6 at Con• stantinople by Professor Herman V. Hilprecht of the University of Pennsylvania, mak,· ii evident that Babylonia was an important kingdom at least three or four millenniums before him. Sargon·s astronomical work, the 1/lumina/io,, of Rd, in 72 books, was compiled by 1hr priests of that god, and translated into Greek by Berossos about 26o B. c. Fragments of thi, last work still remain to us.

burg, Saxony and Wilna, Mexico and Oxford. Manilius also wrote of it as in our motto, and at Caesar's Birth Serene he shone.
The almanac of 1386 has:" Whoso is borne in Capcom schal be ryche and we! lufyd "; in 1542 the Doctor, as Arcandum was called, showed that a man born under it would be a great gallant, would have eight special illnesses, and would die at sixty; and according to Smyth it was " the very pet of all constellations with astrologers, having been the fortunate sign under which Augustus and Vespasian were born," although elsewhere, in somewhat uncourtly style, he quotes: "prosperous in dull and heavy heasts." It also appears to have been much and favorably regarded by the Arabians, as may be seen in their names for its chiet stars, and in the character assigned by them to it.c; lunar mansions. But these benign qualities were only occasional, caused probably by some lucky combination with a iortunate sign, as is known only to the initiated, for its general reputation was the reverse; and, in classical days, when coincident with the sun, it was thought a harbinger of storms and so ruler of the waters,-Horace's
tyrannus Hesperiae Capricornus undae.
.\ratos had clearly showed this long before:
Then grievous blasts Break southward on the sea, wheri coincide The Goat and sun; and then a heaven-sent cold.
Ovid expressed much the same opinion in connection with the story of Acaetes; but ages before them this seems to have been said of it on Euphratean tablets. Caesius and Postellus are authority for its being Aluel, the Scapegoat ,JC Lroiticus ,· although Caesius also mentioned it as Simon Zelotea, the
Apostle. Suetonius in his Life ef Attgustus, and Spanheim in his De Num111is, said that Capricorn was shown on silver coins of that emperor, commemorating the fact that it was his natal sign; and it always has been regarded in astrology as the Kanlion of King& It is seen, too, on a coin found in Kent, struck by the British prince Amminius, and was the most frequent of the zodiacal figures on uranographic amulets of the 14th and 15th centuries, "worn as a kind of astral defensive armor." Its figuring generally has been consistent, and as we now see it, with the h1:ad and body of a goat, or ibex, ending in a fish's tail. Manuscripts from :he zd to the 15th century show it thus; a Syrian seal of 187 B. c. has it in the same way ; as also an early Babylonian gem, surmounted, not inap

propriately, by the crescent moon, for Capricorn was a nocturnal sign; and the same figure is on a fragment of a Babylonian planisphere, now in the British Museum, supposed to be of the 12th century B. c. So that this may be considered its original form, in full agreement with its amphibious character, and with some resemblance, in the grouping of the chief stars, to a goat's horns and a fish's tail. From this figuring CamOes, in Os l11sia• das of 1572, called it the Semi-0..pran Piah, as it now is with us the GoatFiah and the Sea Goat. Still at times it has been a complete goat-like animal, and was so considered by Aratos, Eratosthenes, and Ptolemy, as by the more modem Albumasar, Kazwini, Ulug Beg, and in occasional mediaeval manuscripts. It was thus shown on some Egyptian zodiacs; although on that of Denderah it appears in its double form, where " an ibis-headed man rides on Capricornus, under which sign Sirius rose anti-heliacally "; the ibis being sacred to Isis, with which Sirius was identified. Still differ• ently, a silver bowl from Burmah engraved with the Brahmin zodiac, probably copied from original sources, makes the Fish entire in Capri• corn, and omits the Goat; while Jensen says that in Babylonia the Goat and Fish, both complete, were occasionally used together for the con• stellation. Jewish Rabbis asserted that the tribe of Naphtali adopted this sign as their banner emblem,-" Naphtali is a hind let loose,"-as if Capricorn were a deer, or antelope ; _others ascribed it to Benjamin, or to Reuben; but Aquarius more fitly represented the latter. Some connect the sign in Egyptian astronomy with Chn11Dl, Chnemu, Gnoum, or hum, the God of the Waters, associated with the rising of the Nile and worshiped in Elephantine at the Cataracts, this divinity bearing goat's, not ram's, horns. Others have said that it was the goat-god Iendee ; and La Lande cited the strange title Ozirinque from the Greek adjective descriptive of a Sword1llb, our constellation sometimes being thus shown, when it was considered the cause of the inundation. In Coptic Egypt it was 'Orrivr-vr, Brachium S,urifia"i; and Miss Clerke says that 11 was figured in that country as a Kinor, emblematic of life. Earlier Hindu names were Iriga and Kakara,-the Cingalese •atn and the Tamil llakaram, an Antelope; but occasionally it was shown with a goat's head upon the body of a hippopotamus, signifying some amphibious creature, and a later term was Bhi-thu-mara or Sim-thu-mara, the Crocodile, although this originally was marked by stars of Draco. Varaha Mihira took his title for it, Akokera, from the Greeks; and it was the last in order of the zodiacal signs of India, as on the Euphrates. In the Aztec calendar it appeared as Oipaotli, with a figure like that of the narwhal.

It was the zodiacal Bull, or Ox, of Chinese astronomy, that later became Io Xi, the Goat-Fish. Williams says that, with stars of Sagittarius, it was Sing Ki, the Starry Record, and with a part of Aquarius Hiuen hiau ; while in very early days, with Aquarius and Sagittarius, it was the Dark Warrior, etc., the so-called Northern one of the four large divisions of the zodiac. Flammarion asserts that Chinese astronomers located among its stars a conjunction of the five planets 2449 B. c. Sayce, Bosanquet, and others think that they have without doubt identified it with the Assyrian Kunaxa, the Goat-Fish; and we see other probable names in Shah or Shahu, the Ibex, and in B'iru, the Yoke, this last perhaps a popular one. Brown gives for it the Akkadian Su-tul of the same meaning; and another possible title, resembling the early Hindu, was Jlakhar, claimed also for Delphinus. It seems likewise to have been known as the Double Ship. Jensen says that " the amphibious Ia Oannes of the Persian Gulf was connected with the constellation Capricomus "; Sayce, that a cuneiform inscription designates it as the Father of Light,-a title which, astronomically considered, could not have been correct except about 15000 years ago, when the sun was here at the summer solstice; that " the goat was sacred and exalted into this sign "; and that a robe of goatskins was the sacred dress of the Babylonian priests. So that, although we do not know when Capricomus came into the zodiac, we may be confident that it was millenniums ago, perhaps in prehistoric days. It was identified with the 10th Assyrian month Dhabitu, corresponding to December-January. Its symbol, "3, usually is thought to be TP, the initial letters of Tpayor, Goat, but La Lande said that it represents the twisted tail of the creature; and Brown similarly calls it " a conventional representation of a fish-tailed goat" Indeed it is not unlike the outline of these stars on a celestial globe. The sun is in the constellation from the 18th of January to the 14th of February, when, as Dante wrote in the .Paradiso,
The horn of the celestial goat doth touch the sun;
and Milton mentions the latter's low elevation during this time,
Thence down amain
As deep as Capricorn.
The title Tropic of Capricorn, originating from the fact that when first observed the point of the winter solstice was located here, now refers to the sign and not to the constellation, this solstice at present being 33° to the westward, in the figure of Sagittarius, near its star I'·

Other titles, Dabih and the degenerated Daohibbe and Dahabeh, applied to them, but more commonly to /3, have been traced by some to Al Jabbah. the Forehead, although the stars are nearer the tip of the horn; but the names undoubtedly come from Al Sa'd al Dhi~ the Lucky One of the Slaughterers, the title of the 20th mansil (of which these alphas and ~ were the determinant point), manifestly referring to the sacrifice celebrated by the heathen Arabs at the heliacal rising of Capricorn. And of similar signification was the Euphratean Shak-shadi and the Coptic Bupntil, or Opeutu, for the same lunar asterism of those peoples. Brown thinks that 11, then seen only as a single star, with /j and i· was known by the Akkadians as lJz, the Goat; and as Bnn in the astronomy of their descendants; while Epping is authority for the statement that this. or perhaps /3, marked the 26th ecliptic asterism of the Babylonians, Qarnu Shahil, the Hom of the Goat. Brown also says that a represented the 8th antediluvian king Amar Sin,- 'Aμiμ,f,,vr,r.

Smyth described a minute blue companion of a3 which he caught "in little evanescent flashes, so transient as again to recall Burns's snow-flakes on a stream "; and mentioned Sir John Herschel's suggestion that this might shine by reflected light. Alvan G. Clark doubled this in 1862, the distance being 1".2, and the position angle 239°.

The two stars mark the head of the Goat, the components 205" distant from each other, and each very closely double.

queen's enemies, the sea-nymphs, to give her an effectual lesson in humility, for a location nearer the equator would have kept her nearly upright. Aratos said of this : She head foremost like a tumbler sits.
Her outstretched legs also, for a woman accustomed to the fashions of the East, must have added to her discomfort. Euripides and Sophocles, of the fifth century before our era, wrote of her, while all the Greeks made much of the constellation, knowing it as Ka11t1tiTl'Eta and 'H Tov 0p6vov, She of the Throne. But at one time in Greece it was the Laconian Xey, from its resemblance to that instrument, the invention of which was attributed in classical times to that people; 1 although Pliny claimed this for Theodorus of Samos in Caria, 730 e. c., whence came another title for our stars, Carlon. The learned H uetius (H uet, bishop of Avranches and tutor of the dauphin Louis XV) more definitely said that this stellar key represented that described by Homer as sickleshaped in the wardrobe door of Penelope:
A brazen key she held, the handle tum'd, With steel and polish'd elephant adorned;
and Aratos wrote of the constellation:
E'en as a folding door, fitted within With key, is thrown back when the bolts are drawn.
But even Ideler did not understand this simile, although the outline of the chief stars well shows the form of this early key. The Romans transliterated the Greek proper name as we still have it, but al~o knew Cassiopeia as M:ulier Sedia, the Woman of the Chair; or simply as 8edel, qualified by regalis or regio; and as Sella and Solium. Bayt'r's ,tatement that Juvenal called it Cathedra molli1 was an error from a misreading of the original text. Hyde's title Inthronata has been repeated by subsequent authors; and Cassiopeia'• Chair is the children's name for it now. The! Arabians called it Al Dhit al Kunin, the Lady in the Chair,Chilmead's Dhath Alouni,-the Greek proper name having no signification to them ; but the early Arabs had a very different figure here, in no way connected with the Lady as generally is supposed,-their Xaff' al ll·adib,

The early Arabs additionally made Two Dogs out of Cassiopeia and Cepheus, from which may have come Bayer's Canis; but bis Cerva, a Roe, is not explained, although La Lande asserted that the Egyptian sphere of Petosiris had shown a Deer to the north of the Fishes. Al Tizini imagined a Kneeling Camel from some of its larger stars, whence the constellation's name Shuter found with Al N~r al Din, and common for that animal in Persia. The Alfonsine Jab/es and Ara/Jo-Latin Almagest described the figure as lu1bens palmam delibulam, Holding the Consecrated Palm, from some early drawing that is still continued; but how the palm, the classic symhol of victory and Christian sign ofmartyrdom, became associated with this heathen queen does not appear. Similarly La Lande cited Siliquaatrum, the name for a tree of Judaea, referring to the branch in the queen's hand. Bayer's Hebrew title for it, Aben Ezra, was by a misreading of Scaligcr's notes.
La Lande quoted HarnaoaJf from the Melamorpltoses of Vishnu, but the later Hindus said Cuyapi, evidently from the classical word. Grimm gives the Lithuanian Ioatandia, from J osta, a Girdle, although without explanation. As the figure almost wholly lies in the Milky Way, the Celts fixed upon it as their Llys Don, the Home of Don, their king of the fairies and father of the mythical character Gwydyon,1 who gave name to that great circle. Schiller's Wallmslein, as versified by Coleridge, has

And in some constellated form its stars unquestionably were well known on the Euphrates with the rest of the Royal Family, and shown there on seals. The earthly Cassiopeia ought to have been black, and is so described by ~lilton in his verses of JI Penseros(J on

while Landseer with the same idea called her Cuhiopeia, the Queen of Cush, or Kush, but the Leyden Manuscript makes her of fair complexion, lightly clad, upright and unbound in a very uncomfortable chair; and such is the general representation. But in the 17th-century reconstruction of sky figures in the interests of religion, our Cassiopeia became Jlary M:agclalene; or Deborah sitting in judgment under her palm tree in Mount Ephraim ;· or Batbaheba, the mother of Solomon, worthy to sit on the royal throne. The astrologers said that it partook of the nature of Saturn and Venus. Professor Young gives the word Bagdd as a help to memorizing the

Smyth said that it was known as Luoida Cauiopea,- a matter-of-fact statement, as the brightest star in any sky figure is the lucida. Birt noticed its variability in 1831, which is now determined as in a period of about 79 days, although irregular. It culminates on the 18th of November. Burnham has discovered two additional faint companions, the nearest 17".5 away: the companion first known, a smalt blue star, having been found by Sir William Herschel, in 1781, 63" away.

Caph, Chaph, or XafF, on the upper right-hand comer of the chair, are from the Arabic title of the constellation; but Al Tizini designated the star as Al Sanim al lf~ah, the Camel's Hump, referring to the contemporaneous Persian figure. With '-' Andromedae and y Pegasi, as the Three Gu.idea, it marks the equinoctial colure, itself exceedingly close to that great circle; and, being located on the same side of the pole as is Polaris, it always affords an approximate indication of the latter's position with respect to that point. This same location, 32° from the pole, and very near to the prime meridian, has rendered it useful for marking sidereal time. When above Polaris and nearest the zenith the astronomical day begins at o hours, o minutes, and o seconds; when due west the sidereal time is 6 hours; when south and nearest the horizon, 12 hours, and when east, 18 hours; this celestial clockhand thus moving on the heavenly dial contrary to the motion of the hands of our terrestrial clocks, and at but one half the speed.

after its appearance as the Stranger, or the Pilgrim, Star, and the Star in the Chayre, but by us as Tyoho'a Star, although it was first noticed by Schuler at Wittenberg in Prussia, on the 6th of August; again at Augsburg by Hainzel, and at Winterthiir, Switzerland, by Lindauer, on the 7th of November; and on the 9th by Cornelius Gemma, who called it the llew Venu. Maurolycus began its systematic study at Messina on the 8th, while Tycho did not see it till the 11th, at the time of its greatest brilliancy; but his published account of it in 1602, in his Aslronomi'ae Inslauralae Protgym11asmala, has caused his name to be identified with it. Its lustre began to wane in the following December, and it was inserted in the .Rudolphine Ta6/u as" Nova anni 1572" of the 6th magnitude, to which it had at that time decreased. It disappeared entirely in March, 1574, so far as could then be known. This nova is said to have incited Tycho to the compilation of his starcatalogue, as that of seventeen· centuries earli~r may have been the occasion of the catalogue of Hipparchos. At all events, it created a great commotion in its time, and induced Beza's celebrated prediction of the second coming of Christ,1 as it was considered a reappearance of the Star of Bethlehem. The statement that this star appeared in 945 and 1264 rests upon the very doubtful authority of the Bohemian astrologer Cyprian Leowitz, and is not credited by our modern astronomers; although Williams asserts that a large comet was seen in the latter year near Cassiopeia. The reddish 10_1⁄4-magnitude, known as B Cassiopeiae, singularly variable in its light, is now to be seen o'.8 from the spot assigned by Argelander to the star of 1572, and is thought possibly to be identical with it. The Chinese recorded Tycho's nova as Ko Bing, the Guest Star.

The spectrum is peculiarly variable, as also is its light. The components are 2".1 apart, at a position angle of 255°.2, and there has been no change in angle or distance since measured by Burnham in 1888. A telescope of high power shows several minute companions.

sequence of exercising this virtue toward Hercules. Apollodorus tells us that the latter's gratitude caused this centaur's transformation to the sky as our constellation, with the fitting designation 'Evμev,,r, Well-disposed. Eratosthenes asserted that the stellar figure represented Xeipwv, a title that, in its transcribed forms Chiron and ChJTOD, was in frequent poetical use in classical times, and is seen in astronomical works even to Ideler's day. This has appropriately been translated the Handy One, a rendering that well agrees with this Centaur's reputation. He was the son of Chronos and the ocean nymph Philyra, who was changed after his birth into a Linden tree, whence Philyrides occasionally was applied to the constellation; although a variant story made him Phililyrides, the son of Phililyra, the Lyre-loving. from whom he inherited his skill in music. He was imagined as of mild and noble look, very different from the threatening aspect of the centaur Sagittarius; and Saint Clement of Alexandria wrote of him that he first led mortals to righteousness. His story has been thought in some degree historic, even by Sir Isaac Newton. As the wisest and most just of his generally lawless race he was beloved by Apollo and Diana, and from their teaching became proficient in botany and music, astronomy, divination, and medicine, and instructor of the most noted heroes in Grecian legend. ~latthew Arnold wrote of him in Empedocks on Etna:
On Pelion, on the grassy ground, Chiron, the aged Centaur lay, The young Achilles standing by. The Centaur taught him to explore The mountains where the glens are dry And the tired Centaurs come to rest, And where the soaking springs abound.
He told him of the God~, the stars, The tides.

Prometheus evidently inherited Chiron's astronomical attainments, as well as his immortality, for Aeschylus, who thought him the founder of civilization and " full of the most devoted love for the human race," made him say in .PrumelMus Bu11nd:
I instructed them to mark the stars, Their rising, and, a harder science yet, Their setting.
The conception of a centaur's figure with Homer, Hesiod, and even with Berossos, probably was of a perfect human form, Pindar being the first to describe it as semi-ferine, and since his day the human portion of the Centaur has been terminated at the waist and the hind quarters of a horse added. William Morris thus pictured him in his Life and Death uf Jas1111:
at last in sight the Centaur drew, A mighty grey horse trotting down the glade, Over whose back the long grey locks were laid, That from his reverend head abroad did flow; For to the waist was man, but all below A mighty horse, once roan, but now well-nigh white With lapse of years; with oak-wreaths was he dight Where man joined unto horse, and on bis bead He wore a gold crown, set with rubies red, And in bis hand be bare a mighty bow, No man could bend of those that battle now.
Some ancient artists and mythologists changed these hind quarters to those of a bull, thus showing the Jlinotaur, and on the Euphrates it was considered a complete Bull The Arabians drew the stellar figure with the hind parts of a Bear, but adopted the Greek title in their Al Xentauru. that has been considered as the original of the otherwise inexplicable Taraapoz, used in Reduan's Commentary for our constellation. Some of the Centaur's stars, with those of Lupus, were known to the early Arabs as Al Kadb al Kann, the Vine Branch; and again as Al Shamirili, the broke~-off Palm Branches loaded with dates which Kazwini described as held out in the Centaur's hands. This degenerated into
Alemarik, and perhaps was the origin of Bayer's word Aameat. He also had Albea; and Riccioli, Albezze and Albizze,- unintelligible unless from the Arabic Al Wazn, Weight, that was sometimes applied to a and /3. Hyde is our authority for another title (from Albumasar), Birdun, the Pack-horse.



The Constellations
Ptolemy described the figure with Lupus in one hand, and the Thyrsus in the other, marked by four 4th-magnitude stars, of which only two can now be found; this Thyrllll being formed, Geminos said, into a separate constellation by Hipparchos as Ovpa6loy"o<;,- in the Manitius text as 8vp<10<;,and Pliny wrote of it in the same way, but their selection of such small stars seems remarkable. The Centaur faces the east, and the Farnese globe shows him pointing with left hand to the Beast and the adjacent circular Altar; but in the Hygilfus of 1488 the Beast is in his outstretched hands, the Hare on the spear, and a canteen at his waist; the Alfonsine Tables have the Thyrsus in his right hand and Lupus held by the fore foot in his left, which was the Arabian idea. The Leyden Manuscript gives a striking delineation of him 11ith shaven face, but with heavy mustache(!), bearing the spear with the Hare dangling from the head, and a Kid, instead of the Beast, held out in his hands towards the Altar, the usual libation carried in the canteen. Bayer shows the Centaur with Lupus; Burritt has him in a position of attack, with the spear in his right hand and the shield on his left arm, the Thyrsus and vase of libation depicted on it ; Grotius calling this portion of the constellation Arma. The Century Dictionary illustrates a Bacchic wand with the spear. In Rome the constellation was Centa1lr'ILI, the duplici Centaurus imagine of Manilius, and the Geminua biformil of Germanicus; Jr.inotaurua; Semi Vir, the Half Man, and Semi Fer, the Half Beast; Pelenor and Pelethroniua from the mountain home of the centaurs in Thessaly; Acri■ Venator, the Fierce Hunter; and Vergil had Sonipea, the Noisy-footed. The A/f,msine Ta6ks designated it as Sagittarius tenens pateram seu crater-am to distinguish it from the other Sagittarius with the more appropriate bow. Robert Recorde, in 1551, had the Centaure Chiron, but Milton, in 1667, wrote Centaur for the zodiac figure, as so many others have done before and since his day; in fact, Sagittarius undoubtedly was the original Centaur and from the Euphrates, the Centaur of the South probably being of Greek conception. But in the classical age confusion had arisen among the unscientific in the nomenclature of the two figures, this continuing till now; much that we find said by one author for the one appearing with another author for the other. During the 17th century, however, distinction was made by English authors in calling this the Great Centaure. In some mediaeval Christian astronomy it typified Boah, but Julius Schiller changed the figure to Abraham with Iaaao; and Caesius likened it to lebuohadrezzar when "he did eat grass as oxen." This is one of the largest constellations, more than 60° in length, its

centre about 50° south of the star Spica below Hydra's tail; but Aratos located it entirely under the Scorpion and the Claws, an error that Hipparchos criticized. It shows in the latitude of New York City only a few of its components in the bust, of which 8, a variable 2d-magnitude on the right shoulder, is visible in June about 12° above the horizon when on the meridian, and 27° southeast from Spica, with no other star of similar brightness in its vicinity. It was this that Professor Klinkerfues of Gottingen mentioned in his telegram to the Madras Observatory, on the 30th of November, 1872, in reference to the lost Biela comet which he thought had touched the earth three days previously and might be found in the direction of this star. t on the left shoulder, a 2,1⁄4-magnitude, is about 11° west of H. Gould's list contains 389 naked-eye ~tars in this constellation. One of the remarkable nebulae of the heavens, N. G. C., 3918, was discovered here by Sir John Herschel, who called it the Blue Planetary," very like Uranus, only half as large again." A 7th-magnitude nova that appeared in Centaurus between the 14th of June and the 8th of July, 1895, has changed since its discovery to a gaseous nebula, as has been the case with recent noz,ae in Auriga, Cygnus, and Norma.

Baily's edition of Ulug Beg's catalogue gives this as B.igil Xentauru, from Al Rijl al Xent&urua, the Centaur's Foot; describing it as on the toe of the right front hoof, and Bayer so illustrated it. Chrysococca had the synonymous rrovr 1'ov,ovpor; and our Centur_v Dictionary retains Rigel, although this is better known for the bright star in Orion. Burritt located on the left fore hoof a 4th-magnitude star that he wrongly lettered a; and above the pastern our 1st-magnitude, also lettered a, with the title Bangula, which I find only with him and the Standard Dictionary. He gives no explanation of this, nor can I trace it further; it may be a word specially

its first visible emergence from the sun's rays, in the morning at the autumnal equinox, has been connected by Lockyer with the orientation of at least nine temples in northern Egypt dating from 3800 to 2575 B. c., and of several in southern Egypt from 3700 B. c. onward. As such object of worship it seems to have been known as Serk•t. It bore an important part, too, in southern China as the determinant of the stellar division llan Kun, the South Gate. a lies in the Milky Way, 60° south of the celestial equator, culminating with Arcturus, but is invisible from north of the 29th parallel. It is of the greatest interest to astronomers, being, so far as is now known, the nearest to our system of all the stars, although more than 275,000 times the distance of the earth from the sun,- 92,892,000 miles,-and 100 millions of times the distance from the earth to the moon,- 238,840 miles. Its parallax, first taken at the Cape of Good Hope by Henderson in 1839, and later by Gill and Elkin, and now fixed at o".75, shows a distance equal to that
traveled by light in d- years. We can better realize the immensity of this distance from Professor Young's statement that if the line from the earth to the sun's centre be represented as 215 feet long, one to this star would be 8000 miles; and from Sir John Herschel's illustration :
10 drop a pea at the end of every mile of a voyage on a limitless ocean to the nearest fixed star, would require a fteet of 10,000 ships of 6oo tons burthen, each starting with a foll cargo of peas.
The nicety of parallactic observation, too, is shown by the fact that
"an angle of 2" is that in which a circle of -fo of an inch in diameter would be seen at the distance of a mile." Were our sun removed to the distance of a Centauri, its diameter of 866,400 miles would subtend an angle of only 1 h of a second of arc, of course utterly inappreciable with the largest telescope; and if seen from that star, would appear as a 2d-magnitude near the chair of Cassiopeia. a was first discovered to be double by Richaud at Pondicherry, India, in 1689; but there seems discrepancy in the magnitudes respectively attributed to the components. Early astronomers thought the lesser star, a1, a 4thmagnitude; even recently Gould has estimated it as 3,1⁄2; yet Miss Clerke
writes," the lesser, though emitting only 1⁄4as much light as its neighbour, is still fully entitled to rank as of the 1st magnitude"; all of which may indicate an increase of brilliancy since its observation began. Together they give nearly four times as much light as the sun, while their mass is double that of the latter.

This appears absolutely round, 20' in diameter, and contains many thousands of 13th- to 15th-magnitude stars; while its uniform structure indicates that it may be among the youngest of its class.

Star-Names and their Meanings
In Greek story, like so many other stellar personages, Cepheus was connected with the Argonautic expedition. The figure bore our title among all early astronomers and classic authors, but Germanicus added Iaaidea from the 'Iaoidao of Aratos; Nonnus had 'Av~p {3aotA.71'0f from his royal station, which became Vir regiu and even B.egulu. Others said that he was the aged ll'ereu and thus also Beau aequoreu, and others strangely called it luvenil aequoreu1. Oant&DI, Sonana, and Vooiterana show early confusion with the not far distant Bootes; while Dominu aoli11 Flammige,-, Inft•mm•tu, and hcelllu are fiery epithets that do not seem appropriate for so faint a figure, unless originating from the fable that the tables of the Sun were spread in Aethiopia, the land where Cepheus reigned when on earth. Some one, howe\·er, has suggested that they are from the fact that his head is surrounded and illuminated by the Milky Way, although itself in an entirely bare spot in that great circle of light. This appeared in Horace's lines:
Claros occultum Andromedae pater Ostendit ignem.
Cepheus is an inconspicuous constellation, but evidently was highly regarded in early time~ as the father of the Royal Family, and his story well known in Greek literature of the 5th century before Christ: The name
K11<f>evr, compared by Brown to Khufu of Great Pyramid fame, was the source of many queer titles from errors in Arabic transcription-first into Jμfail, ~kaiil, Xankau; later into Fikau, Pifau, and Fioarea, or Pbicarea, its usual designation in Persia, and PhiO&l'III. Chilmead suggested that Phicares was a Phoenician title equivalent to Flammiger, and identical with ITvpA:afvf, the Fire-kindler, which, transliterated as Pirohaeu, has been
used for these stars. Later on in astronomical literature we find OaioaDI.
Oeginu, Oeiohiu, Ohegniua, Ohegninu, Oheguinua, and Ohiph111, some of which also are seen for Bootes. The later Hindus knew Cepheus as OapvJa, adopted from Greece; but Hewitt claims that with their prehistoric ancestors it represented Kap~ the Ape-God, when its stars a and y were the respective pole-stars of 21000 and 19000 u. c. Dunkin derives our title from the Aethiopic Hyk, a King, but the con· nection with Aethiopia probably can only be allowed by considering that country the Asian Aethiopia, for our Cepheus is unquestionably of Euphratean origin. Still Bayer's illustration of it is that of a typical African. In China, somewhere within this constellation's boundaries, was the Inner Throne of the Five Emperon.

Arabian astronomers translated Inflammatus into Al ][ultahab ; but the nomads knew Cepheus, or at least some of its stars, as Al Aghnim, the Sheep, and thus associated with the supposed Fold, a large figure around the pole very visible traces of which appear in the nomenclature of components of this and other circumpolar constellations. Bayer specified certain of these,-11, 0, y, "• rr, and p,-as the Shepherd, his Dog, and the Sheep; but Smyth alluded to the whole of Cepheus as the Dog, Cassiopeia being his mate. Riccioli quoted from Kircher, as to these, the Arabic "Baar, lelcla & Ban: nempe Pastorem, Canem, Oves," more correctly transcribed Iii', Xalb, and Shim.
A translator of Al Ferghani's 1 Elements of Aslrono111y called the constellation Al Radif, the Follower, which may have come by some misunderstanding from the near-by Al Ridf in the tail of the Swan, for Cepheus does not seem ever to have been known by any such title. The early Arabs' Jμdr, the Pot, was formed by the circle of small stars from ~ and 1/ on the hand of our figure extending to the wing of the Swan. In the place of Cepheus, Caesius wished to substitute King Solomon, or 1.erah, the Aethiopian, whom King Asa overthrew, as told in the 2d Book of f/,e Cl,ronicles, xiv, 9-12; but Julius Schiller said that it should be Ba.int Stephen.

Kazwini mentioned it as Al Fir~ but, although thus found on the Borgian globe, Ideler thinks it a mistake of that author, as a single star cannot represent a Flock, which Al Firlt signifies.

The 4th- to 5th-magnitude stars that Hevelius assigned to it are Flamsteed's 93, 95, 96, and 109, lying half-way between the head of Hercules and the head of the Swan.

The royal poet James I designated the infernal Cerberus as "the thrie headed porter of hell," and the heavenly one has been so figured. although with serpents' darting tongues; but the abode and task of the creature would seem to render very inappropriate his transfer to the sky, ,o that it probably was only made for the purpose of mythological completeness, as the death of this watch-dog of Hades fitly rounded out the circle of Hercules' twelve labors. Others have said that the figure typified the serpent destroyed by the Hero while it was infesting the country around Taenarum, the Mfo,mo11 of Greece, the modem Cape Matapan. Some of the stars of Cerberus were known in China as Too Su, the Butcher's Shop; and others as Keen Too, a Cloth Measure.

is the French Baleine, the Italian Bala.en&, and the German Walllloh. This constellation has been identified, at least since Aratos' day, v.ith the fabled creature sent to devour Andromeda, but turned to stone at the sight of the Medusa's head in the hand of Perseus. Equally veracious additions to the story, from Pliny and Solinus, are that the monster's bones were brought to Rome by Scaurus, the skeleton measuring forty feet in length and the vertebrae six feet in circumference; from Saint Jerome, who wrote that he had seen them at Tyre; and from Pausanias, who described a nearby spring that was red with the monster's blood. But the legend in which Cetus figured seems to have been current on the Euphrates long before our era; and, descending to Euripides and Sophocles, appeared in their dramas. as also in much subsequent literature. For its stellar title the Greeks usually followed Aratos and Eratosthene, in K17Tof, but they also had 'Op<J>ir, 'Op<J>6r, and 'Op<J>wr, some species oi

cetacean; and the equivalent UpijaTtr and IJpfoTtf,1 from 1rpij9Etv, to blow or spout, the common habit of the animal. The last word, variously transliterated, was common for the constellation with Roman authors, appearing
as Priam, Priatu, and Piatriz, qualified by the adjectives auster, Nerna, /era, Neptunia, aequorea, and squammigera. Cetus, however, has been the usual title from the days of Vitruvius, varied by Cete with the 17th-century astronomical writers, although the stellar figure is unlike any whale known to zoology. The Harleian 2 and Leyden Manuscripts show it with greyhound head, ears, and fore legs, but with a long, trident tail; the whole, perhaps, modeled after the ancient bas-relief of Perseus and Andromeda in the Naples Museum. It is found thus on the Farnese globe, and this figuring may have given rise to, or originated from, the early title that La Lande cited, Cani1 Tritonil, his own Chien de Ker. But the Hyginus of 1488 has a dolphinlike creature with proboscis and tusks, all imitated in the edition of 1535 by Micyllus; and Diirer still further varied the shape of the head and front parts. Thus in these, as, in fact, in all delineations, it has been a strange and ferocious marine creature, in later times associated with the story of Andromeda, and at first, perhaps, was the Euphratean Tilmat, of which other forms were Draco, Hydra, and Serpens; indeed, some have thought that our Draco was Andromeda's foe because of its proximity to the other characters of the legend. But as an alternative signification of the word Kij~~ is Tunny,3 also a signification of Xd,d6vu1r, applied to the Northern Fish of the zodiac, it is not unlikely that the latter figure should be substituted in the story for the time-honored Whale. Cetus is sometimes represented swimming in the River Eridanus, although usually as resting on the bank with fore paws in the water; its head, directly under Aries, marked by an irregular pentagon of stars, and its body stretching from the bend in Eridanus to that in the Stream from the Um. It occupies a space of 50° in length by 20° in breadth, and so is one of the most extended of the sky figures ; yet it shows no star larger than of the 2d magnitude, and only one of that lustre.

Argelander enumerates 98 stars in the constellation, and Heis 162. The 1515 Almagest and the Alfo11sine Tables called it Ba1aena, but Firmicus said Belua, the Beast or Monster, a more appropriate name than ours. Bayer mentioned it as Draco, and drew it so, but without wings; he also cited for it Leo, ][outrum marinlllll, Urau marinua, Orphu, and Orphu; and Grotius quoted Gibb111, Humped, from anonymous writers. The Arabian astronomers of course knew the Greek constellation and called it Al Jetua, from which have come Elketoa, Elkaitoa, and Blbitu; but their predecessors, who had not heard of the Royal Family and its foe, separated these stars into three very different asterisms. Those in the head, a, y, d, l, /l, ~1, and~. were Al Ka.ft' al lidhmah, the Part of a Hand, from a fancied resemblance to their Stained Hand, our Cassiopeia; f/, 0, r, {, and 1, in the body of our Cetus, were Al lla'imit, the Hen Ostriches; and the four io a straight line of 3° length across the tail, all lettered q,, were Al Iipiim, the Necklace. The biblical school of the 17th century of course saw here the Whale that ■wallowed lonah; and commentators on that great astronomical poem, the Book of Job, have said that it typified the Leviathan of which the Lord spoke to the patriarch. Julius Schiller thought it "88. loachim and Anna." The Euy Chair has popularly been applied to it from the arrangement of its chief stars, the back of the chair leaning towards Orion. Although an old constellation, Cetus is by no means of special interest, except as possessing the south pole of the Milky Way and the Wonderful Star, the variable Mira; and from the fact that it is a condensation point of nebulae directly across the sphere from Virgo, also noted in this respect

It is the prominent star in the northeastern part of the constellation, and culminates on the 21st of December. Al Ka.ft' al lidhm.ah, found on the Borgian globe, is Ulug Beg's and Al Tizini's designation for it, taken from that for all the stars in the head; but modern lists apply this solely to y. In astrological days it portended danger from great beasts, disgrace, ill fortune, and illness to those born under its influence.

Deneb Xaitol is from the Arabian Al Dhanab al '.l[ai~ al J'antbl17, the Tail of the Whale towards the South, i. e. the Southern Branch of the Tail. Chrysococca synonymously had 'Ovpa Tov Kafrov, arbitrarily formed from the Arabic; and the Alfonsine Tables of 1521 called it Denebcaiton. Very differently it was the Arabs' Al J;)ifdi' al ThinI, the Second Frog, that we see in the present Difda, Latinized as Rana Secunda; the star Fomalhaut being Al J?ifdi' al Awwal, the First Frog. In China it was Too Sze Kung, Superintendent of Earthworks. Although below it in lettering, this star is now brighter than a, yet both were registered y-i. e. of the 3d magnitude-by Ptolemy; and Miss Clerke asserts that this inversion of brilliancy took place during the last century. It is nearly 40° southwest from a, culminating on the 21st of November.

Still, aJ. though a misnomer, the title seems to be generally recognized. The UII· tury Cyc/Qpetlia extends it as Deneb Algenubi.

From this Arabic adjective the Standard .Dictionary• very unsatisfactorily gives Schemali simply as the star's title. With '1, 9, i•, ,, and stars in the modem Fomax, it made up the Chinese asterism Tim YHI, Heaven's Temporary Granary. l, of about 4_1⁄4 magnitude, is occasionally called Kenlcar, and, as it exactly marks the Nose of Cetus, the title would seem more appropriate than it is to a; but it was applied by the Arabs to both.

Jlira, Stella Jlira, and Collum Ceti are all titles for this Wonclerfal Star in the Whale's neck, the show object in the heavens as a variable oflong period and typical of its class. It was first noticed as a 3d-magnitude on the 13th of August, 1596, and again on the 15th of February, 1609, by David Fabricius, an amateur astronomer and disciple of Tycho Brahe; but its true character was not ascertained till 1638 by Phocylides Holwarda of Holland,- the first estab- ' lished record of a variable star. Bayer lettered it in 1603 as of the 4th magnitude, evidently at a time of its diminished brilliancy and without knowledge of its variability; Hevelius. having observed it from 1659 to 1682, insened it in his .Protfro111us as the Nova in Col/Q Celi; and Flamsteed, numbering it 68, described it as in pee/ore no;va and of the 6th magnitude on the 18th of October, 1691, and again on the 28th of September, 1692. " This was singular in its kind till that in Collo Cygni was discovered: and the attention it excited among astronomers is detailed in the Historwla Mirae Ste/lae" of Hevelius in 1662; thus virtually naming it and "com· memorating the amazement excited by the detection of stellar periodicity." Its period, fixed by Bouillaud in 1667 as 333 days, is now given as 331,

but this is subject to extreme irregularities,- at various times it has not been seen at all with the naked eye for several years consecutively,- and its maxima and minima are even more irregular. While it has been known almost to equal Aldebaran in its light, as it did under Herschel's observations on the 6th of November, 1779, Chandler gives its maximum as from 1.7 to 5, and its minimum from 8 to 9.5. It thus sometimes sends out at its maximum fifteen hundredfold more light than at its minimum, and •'after three centuries of notified activity gives no sign of relaxation." It is generally at its brightest for about a fortnight; the increase occupying about seven weeks and the· decrease about three months. The maximum of 1897 occurred about the 1st of December, when it was a little below the 3d magnitude. Sir William Herschel wrote of it in 1783 as being of a deep garnet color like μ Cephei. The spectrum is of Secchi's 3d type, with extremely brilliant hydrogen lines at the time of maximum. Mira lies almost exactly on the line joining y and ,, a little nearer the former star. q,1,q,2, "13, and q,', 5th- to 6th-magnitude stars, were the Arabs' Al ll'ipiim. In China they were Tien Jlwan, Heaven's Sewer. It was near these that Harding of Lilienthal discovered the minor planet Juno, on the 2d of September, 1804, the 3d of these objects found. , and y, small stars near T, were the Chinese Foo Chih, the Ax and Skewer.

It was first published and figured by Bayer among his new constellations from obser;ations by navigators of the preceding century. Pontanus, in Chilmead's Treatise, included it with Musca as" the Chamaeleon with the file"; but Julius Schiller entirely changed its character by combining it with Apus and Musca in his biblical Eve.

Although first formally published by Royer in 1679, and so generally con· sidered one of his constellations, it had appeared seventy-six years before correctly located on Bayer's plate of Canis Major, and in his text as rt<tnlW· ribus Columba; one of these "more recent" being Petrus Plancius, the Dutch cosmographer and map-maker of the 16th century, and instructor of Pieter , Theodor. While these are the first allusions to Columba in modern times, yet the following from Caesius may indicate knowledge of its stars,1 and certainly of the present title, seventeen centuries ago. Translating from the PrYdagogus of Saint Clement of Alexandria, he wrote :
Signa sive insignia vestra sint Columba, sive Navis coelestis cursu in coelum teodens sive Lyra Musica, in recordationem Apostoli Piscatoris.
Still it was not recognized by Bartschius twenty-one years after Bayer, nor by Tycho, Hevelius, or Flamsteed; but Halley gave it, in the same year as Royer, with ten stars; and our Gould, two centuries later in Argentina, increased the number to seventeen. It was made up from the southwestem ,

Royer cut away a portion of Canis Major, and constructed Colomba Noachi therewith in 1679. The part thus usurped was called Muliphein, from al-mul,lifrln, the two stars sworn by, because they were often mistaken for Soheil, or Canopus, before which they rise: these two stars are now a and {3 Columbae. Muliphein is recognized as comprehending the two stars called lfatf'dr, ground, and al-wnn, weight.

Phaet, Phact, and Phad are all modem names for this, perhaps of uncertain derivation, but said to be from the Ha~ar already noted under the constellation. The Chinese call it Chang J'in, the Old Folks. Although inconspicuous, Lockyer thinks that it was of importance in Egyptian temple worship, and observed from Edfu and Philae as far back as 6400 B. c. ; but that it was succeeded by Sirius about 3000 B. c., as a Ursae Majoris was by y Draconis in the north. And he has found three temples at Medinet Habu, adjacent to each other, yet differently oriented, apparently toward a, 2525, 1250, and 900 years before our era: all these to the god Amen. He thinks that as many as twelve different temples were oriented to this star; but the selection of so faint an object for so important a purpose would seem doubtful. Phaet is 33° south of t Orionis, the central star in the Belt, and culminates on the 26th of January.

It seems to have been first alluded to by Eratosthenes as Ariwe'• Hair in his description of Ariadne's Crown; although subsequently, in his account of Leo, he mentioned the group as 1lA61ra,,()f &pevl1e11r 'EvEpyh-1~. But for nearly 2000 years its right to a place among the constellations was unsettled, for it has been the dμ6pqx.,roi behind the Lion's tail, or connected with Virgo, or partly recognized as an asterism by itself. Tycho, however. set the question at rest in 16o2 by cataloguing it separately, adopting the early title as we have it now. Aratos, perhaps, alluded to it, although indefinitely, in the 146th line of the Pltainomma:
Each after each, ungrouped, unnamed, revolve;
but, of course, did not give its name, for he wrote under the 2d Ptolem}' (Philadelphus), whereas it was not known till about 243 B. c., in the reign of the 3d (Euergetes), the brother and husband of Berenice, whose amber

hair we now see in the sky figure. It was the happy invention of this constellation by Conon that consoled the royal pair after the theft of the tresses from the temple of Arsinoe Aphrodite at Zephyrium. Some versions of the story turned the lady's hair into a hair-star, or comet. The scholiast on Aratos, however, referred to it, as did Ca)]imachus, the latter calling it B6oTpV"Of &pivl"'lr; t and his poem on it, now lost, was imitated 200 years later by Catullus, in one of his most beautiful odes, describing it as
the consecrated spoils of Berenice's yellow head, which the divine Venus placed, a new constellation, among the ancient ones, preceding the slow Bootes, who sinks late and re· luctantly into the deep ocean.
The beautiful and touching legend of the Sudarium of Veronica, with its vera i(on, has been associated with our constellation from the similarity in words, some supposing the saint to have been the Herodian Bernice,- in Latin Beronica,-converted to Christianity through her sympathy for the Saviour's sufferings. Lady Eastlake has fully told this story in her continuation of Mrs. Jameson's History ofour Lord. Hyginus had Bepw{"'lr d6"al'Of; and Ptolemy, simple rr16Hμ,or for three of its stars among the aμ,6P'f,wTo, of Leo, calling it veipeloeuf~r ova-:-pot/)1, a cloudy condensation. This was rendered Al Atha by Reduan, or, as Golius printed it, Al Ultha, literally a Mixture. Manilius did not mention Coma, although he wrote 2 50 years after Conon; nor of course did the versifiers of Aratos, at least by name, as the figure is not distinctly specified in the Phaino111ma. Crinea and Orinea Berenio81 are found in classical times; Flamsteed has
the plural Comae Berenioea, and La Lande Capilli Cinoinnu appears on Mercator's globe of 1551, but there consists of only one star and two nebulae; and the Lalin A Images/ of the same year wrote Com·olulio nubilosa f/llllt rindnnus v«alur, with this marginal note, all for Coma's stars as informes of Leo: P/o(amos grae(e, laline vero cincinnus, ho( est, (aesarits & coma virginis, Berenius fortasse crinis qui ti Poe/a Calimarlto i11 aslra rdatus est.

IThe word Berenice, sometimes Beronice, is from B1enh,q, the Macedonian form of the purer Greek ••enl••• Victory-bearing; and is the B1erl1tq, or Bernice, of the New T~stat11ml, the name of the notorious daughter and wife of the Agrippas. From it some philologists derive the Italian Vnniu, the French Vnnis, the Spanish Dami•, and our Varnis4, all from the ,Jmilar amber color of the lady's hair; B1eul1t• having later become the Low Greek word for amber.

changed this to Trieu, Teriou, and Triquetru, taking these probably from the Low Greek Tptxei;, which doubtless is the origin of our word "tresses." Pliny wrote in the Historia Natura/is: nee [urnit] Canopum Italia d quern vocant Bermices crinem, which Bostock and Riley correctly translated, in 1855, "nor can we, in Italy, see the star Canopus, or Berenice's Hair": but Holland had rendered this, in 1601, "neither hath Italy a sight of Canopus, named also Berenices Hair," from which mistranslation it was long inferred that the southern heavens contained another sky group bearing this same title. And this blunder has been perpetuated, even in Doctor Murray's New English .Dictionary, which defines the word as the name " formerly of the southern star Canopus," citing as authority the foregoing passage from Holland. Pliny's statement as to the invisibility of Coma from Italy of course was incorrect then as now. Julius Schiller asserted that the constellation represented the Flagellum Christi.
Thompson writes in his Glossary, p. 134, that
It has been suggested by Landseer, Sabaean Hesearcltes, p. 186, from the study of an Assyrian symbolic monument, that the stars which Conon converted into the Coma Berenice, (Hygin. P.A. ii, 24, cf. Ideler, Sftrnnamm, p. 295) and which lie in Leo oprosite to the Pleiades in Taurus, were originally constellated as a f'ove; and that this con• stellation, whose first stars rise with the latest of those of Argo, and whose last rise simultaneously with the hand of the Husbandman, links better than the Pleiad into the astronomical Deluge-myth. The case rests on very little evidence, and indeed is an illu,tration of the conflicting difficulties of such hypotheses: but it is deserving of im·estigati,,n, were it only for the reason that the Coma Berenices contains seven visible stars (Hygin.), and the Pleiad six, a faint hint at a possible explanation of the lost Pleiad.
Serviss, who has some beautiful stellar similes, says that it is a
curious twinkling, as if gossamers spangled with dewdrops were entangled there. One might think the old woman of the nursery rhyme who went to sweep the cobwebs out of the sky had skipped this corner, or else that its delicate beauty had preserved it even from her housewifely instinct.
In Hudibras the constellation was Berenice'■ penwig; while another old-fashioned name has been Berenice'■ Buh, found in Thomas Hill's Schoole ofSki/ of I 599, but even then rendered classic in its use by Chauw and Spenser; and Smyth says that there has been a name still homelier. Bayer also mentioned Roi&, a Rose, or a Rose Wreath ; but he figured it on his plate of Bootes as a Sheaf of Wheat, in reference to the Virgo Ceres close by; indeed, Karsten Niebuhr, at Cairo in 1762, heard it called Al Huzmat, the Arabi~ term for that object, or for a Pile of Fruit, Grain.

or Wood. The Dresden globe has it as an Ivy Wreath, or, just as probably, a Diltaff' held in the Virgin's hand, which has been designated Fusus vd Co/us, Fila et Stamina, the Distaff, Thread, and Woof; or perhaps the Cadaceu of Mercury, placed here when Coma was a part of Virgo and this latter constellation the astrological house of that planet. But very differently in early Arabia it was Al ]Jau4, the Pond, into which the Gazelle, our Leo Minor, sprang when frightened at the lashing of the Lion's tail; although some of the Desert observers claimed that this Pond lay among the stars of the neck, breast, and knees of the Greater Bear; and Lach substituted it for the Gazelle in our location of Leo Minor. The Arabian astronomers knew Coma as Al Halbah, or Al :Qafirah, the Coarse Hair, or Tuft, in the tail of the Lion of the zodiac, thus e"xtending that figure beyond its present termination at the star Denebola. Coma probably was known in early Egypt as the Jhny Stan. The Chinese had several names here; the /11cida being Hing Chin; u and win the Reeves list, Chow Ting, the Imperial Caldron of the Chow dynasty; a small group toward Virgo, Woo Choo How; a, b, c, d, e, and/, Lang Wei,
Official Rank; p, Lang Taeang, a General, and v, Shang Taeang, a Higher General; 1 while Taae Ching, the Favorite Vassal, was the title for Bode's 2629. This abundant nomenclature, in so faint a figure, shows great interest on the part of the Chinese in this beautiful little group. Argelander numbers thirty-six stars here, Heis extending this to seventy; and Chase, of the Yale Observatory, has taken measures of thirty-two of these. The constellation culminates about the middle of May. Although it is not easy for the casual observer to locate any of the indi1·idual stars except the lucida, three have been lettered - a, {3, )' - that Baily claimed for Flamsteed's 7, 15, and 23. Of these Fl. 15, an orange star, is generally supposed to be the Arabian Al :p&firah, from Ulug Beg's name for the whole that he located among the informes of Leo. Hyde cited some ancient codices as applying to Fl. 21, toward the south, the title Xiuin, a species of Ivy, Convolvulus, or perhaps the climbing Dogrose. This appeared with Ulug Beg, evidently from Ptolemy's 1'iaatvo<;, but Ideler said that it was intended to mark c, g, and h, and Baily, that it was for Fl. 21 or 23. There evidently is much uncertainty as to the lettering and numbering of Coma's stars; and it seems remarkable that such minute objects should liear individual names.
1Some of these letters may be from Flamsteed, as he applied a, 6, c, d, ~. f. g, and ,t to a <mall portion - the centre -of the constellation ; but Baily, his editor, has rejected them as being only a temporary arrangement.

often qualified by other synonymous adjectives, austrina, mmdiana, meridionalis, or notia, is an inconspicuous constellation, although accepted in Ptolemy's time as one of the ancient forty-eight. On modem maps it> location is close to the waist of Sagittarius, on the edge of the Milky Way. The Germans know it as the Siiclliche Krone; the French, as the Colll'ODD.e Auatrale ; and the Italians, as the Corona Auatrale.
Aratos did not mention it by name unless in his use of the plural Im/>a· 110, for both of the Crowns; yet doubtless had it in mind when he wrote of the tltvwroi Kvdw in our motto. His scholiast and Geminos had 'Ovpavla,'°<;, the Canopy; 1',.evripo<;, the Second; and lievTipa Kvr).a, the Second Circle. Hipparchos is said to have known it as K17pvuio1•, the Caduceus, or Herald's Wand of Peace, but this is not found in his Cnrmentary. Ptolemy called it r.·mpdvo<; voTio<;, the Southern Wreath. Germanicus rendered the supposed reference in the Pluzillo11una as Corona sine honore-i. e. without any such noteworthy tradition as is connected with the Northern Crown ; commenting upon · which, Grotius said that this author, as well as Cicero and Avienus, understood Aratos to refer to the southern figure; and added that this was the Centaur'■ Crown, those personages frequently being represented as wearing such. This ide3 doubtless originated from the outspreading sun-rays, in crown-like form, around the heads of the Gandharvas, the Aryan celestial horses that probably were the forerunners of the Centaurs. It was thus appropriately associated with the centaur Sagittarius and took the title Corona Sagitt&rii



The Constellations 173
Manilius did not allude to it; but others of the classical poets thought it the Crown that Bacchus placed in the sky in honor of his mother Semele; or one in commemoration of the fivefold victory of Corinna over Pindar in their poetical contest; and some considered it the early Bunch of Arrows radiating from the hand of the Archer, often imagined as a wheel. This idea was expressed in its titles Tpoxor 'l{uivor and Rota Ixionil, the Wheel of Ixion, perhaps from the latter's relationship to the centaur Pholos.
Albumasar called it Coelum, while Coelulum and parvum Coelum, the Little Sky, i.e. Canopy, are from the Satyncon,1 the encyclopaedic writings of the Carthaginian Martianus Mineus Felix Capella of the 5th century, in the 8th book of which he treats of astronomy. La Lande cited Sertum autrale, the Southern Garland, and Orbiculu Capitia; Proctor, Brown, and Gore of the present day have Corolla, the Little Crown, but this was used 250 years ago by Caesius, who also gave Spira all.ltralis, the Southern Coil, and said that its stars represented the Crown of Bternal Life promised in the New Testament. Julius Schiller, however, went back a millennium before our era to the Diadem of Solomon. Al Sufi is our authority for the Arabs' Al ~ubbah, literally the Tortoise, but secondarily the Woman's Tent, or traveling apartment, from its form; and it was Al Hibi', the Tent, and Kazwini's Al Udl].i al ll'a'im, the Ostrich's Nest, for the same reason; the birds themselves being close by in what now are the Archer and the Eagle. Al Fa.kkah, the Dish, was borrowed from the Northern Crown, but among the later Arabians it was Al lklil al J'aniibiyyah, their equivalent for our title; Chilmead giving this as Alachil Algenubi; Riccioli, Elkleil Elgenubi; and Caesius, Aladil Algenubi
The Chinese knew it by the figure current in early Arabia-Pei, the Tortoise. Bayer illustrated Corona as a typical wreath, but without the streaming ribbons of its northern namesake, and the original A ljonsine Tables show a plain heart-shaped object with no semblance to the name. Gould assigns to it forty-nine stars, many more than even Heis does to its much more celebrated and noticeable counterpart in the north. Its ludtla, the 4thmagnitude a, at the eastern edge of the constellation, is Alfecca meridiana in the Latin translation of Reduan's Commentary. It culminates on the 13th of August.
1 This was a popular text-book centuries ago, and noticeable even by us, as it contains a

is the French Couronne BoreaJe, the German llorclliohe Krone, and the Italian ancestral Corona. It was the only stellar crown known to Eratosthenes and the early Greeks, but they called it °l:.Ticpav~, a Wreath; and their successors, who had begun to locate the Southern Crown, added to this title of the original the distinguishing 1rpw,oc; and {36pewc; to show its priority and its northern position. The Latins adopted the Greek name and adjectives in Corona bore&, borealia, and aeptentrionalil; and further knew it as the Crown of Vulcan fashioned ex auro el i11dicis gemmis; or of Amphitrite, probably from its proximity in the sky to the Dolphin associated with that goddess. But generally it was Ariadnaea Corona, Corona Ariadnae, Corona Ariadnea, Creua Corona, Corona Gnoaida, Corona Cretioa and Gnouia, varied b)· Kinoia Corona and ltinoia Virgo found with Valerius Flaccus and Germanicus, and Ariadnaea Sidua with Ovid; these classical designations referring to Ariadne, or to her father Minos, king of Crete, and to her birth· place in that island, at Gnosos, where Theseus married her. When deserted by him she became the wife of Liber Bacchus, and so took his name Libera: while the crown that Theseus-or, as some said, the goddess Venus-had given her was transferred to the sky, where it became our Corona; and, as early as the 3d century B. c., Apollonius Rhodius wrote in his Argonautitat:
Still her sign is seen in heaven, And midst the glittering symbols of the sky The starry crown of Ariadne glides.
Keats changed this in his Lamia to Ariadne'• tiar; and others made it the Coiled Hair of Ariadne as companion to the Streaming Tresses of Berenice. Some authors, however,-Ovid among them in his Fasti,- said that Ariadne herself became the constellation; and Mrs. Browning, in her Paraphrases from Nonnus of How Bacchus comforts Ariadne:

This legend of Ariadne and her Crown seems to have been first recorded by Pherecydes early in the 5th century before Christ. Dante, referring to Ariadne's descent, called these stars la Figliuola di lfinoi, the poet giving much prominence to her father,1 who" was so renowned for justice as to be called the Favorite of the Gods, and after death made Supreme Judge in the Infernal Regions." In all ages Corona has been a favorite, popularly as well as in literature, and few of our stellar groups have had as many titles, although the English of the Middle Ages usually wrote its wearer's name" Adrian" and" Adriane." Chaucer had this strange passage on the constellation :
And in the sygne of Taurus men may se The stonys of hire coroune shyne clere;
but this seems unintelligible, unless from some confusion in the poet's mind with the location of Koronis of the Hyades. These, however, lie in the heavens just opposite the Crown, and Skeat ingeniously suggests that Chaucer may have meant that when the Sun was in Taurus the Crown was specially noticeable in the midnight sky, as is exactly the case. "England's Arch Poet," Edmund Spenser, wrote in the Shepheard's Kalmdar 2 of 1579:
And now the Sunne hath reared up his fierie footed teme, Making his way between the Cuppe and golden Diademe;
one of the early titles of Corona being Diadem& Coeli. The Wreath of Flowen, occasionally seen for it, is merely the early signification of the words 'l:.,hpavoc; and Corona. Ocul111 was another name of the constellation - a term common in poetry and post-Augustan prose for any celestial luminary; and Prudens 3 called it Iaera, the Shining One. As the ardens corona of the Georgics, Vergil included it with the Pleiades as a calendar sign, May translating the passage:
I Dante furnished him "with a tail (col/a coda), thus converting him, after the mediaeval fashion. into a Christian demon." It was a long tail, too, for we read: Who bore me unto Mino•, who entwined eight times his tail about his 11ubbom back.

Bat if thou plow to sowe more solid graine, A wheat or barley harvest to obtaine : First let the morning Pleiades be set, And Ariadne's shining Coronet, Ere thou commit thy seed to ground, and there Dare trust the hope of all the following yeare.
Columella, in a similar connection, called it Gnoaia Ardor Baocbi, and ll'mua Ardor, from Naxos, where Ariadne had been deserted by The:.eus: and specially designated its ludda as dara std/a. Its stars were favored also by the astrologers, Manilius expressing this in:
Births influenc'd then shall raise fine Beds of Flowers, And twine their creeping Jasmine round their Bowers; The Lillies, Violets in Banks dispose, The Purple Poppy, and the blushing Rose: For Pleasure shades their rising Mounts shall yield, And real Figures paint the gawdy Field : Or they shall wreath their Flowers, their Sweets entwine, To grace their Mistress, or to Crown their Wine.
Bayer said of it Azophi Parma, by which he meant that Al Sufi called it a Shield; but the majority of Arabian astronomers rendered the classie.11 title by Al Dilil al Shamiliyyah, which degenerated into Aolil111Chemali and Acllllhemali, and appeared with Ulug Beg as plain lklll But in early Arabia there was a different figure here, Al l!'akbh, the Dish, which Ulug Beg's translator gave as Phecoa, and others as Alphaea. Alfeooa, Alfacca, l!'oca, Alfeta, and Alfelta; while Riccioli said A.lphelll Syrochaldaeis; and Schickard, Alphakha.co.
Hyde quoted ~·at al Silik, and ~·at al •a.aildn, the Pauper's Bowl; and the Persians had the same in their Kiaah Darwiahin, the Dervish', Platter, or Klaah Shekeateh, the Broken Platter, because the circle is incomplete. Bullialdus Latinized some of these titles in his Dilc1ll parv1II oonfractua, evidently taken from Chrysococca's lltvaKtv ,cetc).aa/lfror, 3 Small Broken Dish, which, however, should read IItvaKtov. The Alfo11sine Tables have llalfelcarre, "of the Chaldaeans," Riccioli's •alphelcane, considered by Ideler a degenerate form of the Arabic Al llunlr al l!'akkah, the Bright One of the Dish; though Buttmann deril'ed it from Al llalf al Khatar, the Loop of the Wreath, or the Junction of the Crown; and Scaliger suggested Al Ialif al Iurra, of somewhat similar
meaning, more correctly written Al 1lilaft' al Iurrah. Bayer said lal· phelcarre quod est serlum pupil/ae, the Circle of the Pupil of the Eye; and. although he did not explain this, may have written better than he knew.



The Constellations 177
for Pupilla is the Latin equivalent of K6P17, which, as a proper name, was a title for Persephone. In La Lande's Aslronomie Dupuis devoted much space to his identification of this goddess, the Latin Proserpina, with the Chaldaean Phersephon, taking the title from Phe'er, Crown, and Serphon, Northern. Thus, if Dupuis be correct, the origin of the figure, as well as of the name, may lie far back of Cretan days. The Hebrews are said to have called it 'A~oth, the Crown,-perhaps of the Semitic queen Cushiopeia; and the Syrians, Aahtaroth, their Astarte, the' Aippodfr-11 of the Greeks and the Venus of the Latins; but all this seems doubtful, as also is Ewald's conjecture that it was the biblical Mazzaroth. Blake quotes from Flammarion, Viohaca, but without explanation. Reeves catalogued it as the Chinese I.wan Soo, a Cord. In Celtic story Corona was Caer .Arianrod, the House of Arianrod or Ethlenn, the sister of Gwydyon and daughter of Don, the Fairy King, this name bearing a singular resemblance to that of the classical owner of the Crown. The Shawnee Indians knew it as the Celeetial Sisten, the fairest of them being the wife of the hunter White Hawk, our Arcturus. Caesius said that it represented the Crown that Aha111eru1 placed upon Bllther'1 head, or the golden one of the Ammonite Iing of a talent's weight, or the Crown of Thoma worn by the Christ. The Leyden Manuscript shows it as a laurel wreath, and thus, or as a typical crown, it appears on the maps. In the Firma111enlum Firmia11um, a work of 1731, in honor of the persecuting bishop of Salzburg, of the Firmian family, the figuring is that of the Corona Firmiana, with a stag's antlers from the coat of arms of that family. But an exception to the rule may be noted in an illustration, in the original Alfonsilte Tables, of a plain three-quarter circle, entirely unlike either crown or wreath. Proctor suggested that in the earliest astronomy it may have formed the right arm of Bootes. It is interesting to the astronomer from its many close binaries, and is a favorite object with youthful observers, who generally know it as Ariadne'■
Crown. It certainly is much more like that for which it is named than usually is the case with our sky figures; and it is equally suggestive to the A1L<;tralian native of the Woomera, our Boomerang, his idea of Corona's stars. Here appeared very suddenly, 58' south of e, on the 12th of May, 1866, the celebrated Blue Star as a 2d-magnitude visible to the naked eye for only eight days, declining, with some fluctuations, to the 10th magnitude at the rate of half a magnitude a day, but rising again to the 8th, where it

still remains as T Coronae, a pale yellow, slightly variable star. Although called a nova, Argelander had already mapped it on the 18th of May, 1855, and again noted it on the 31st of March, 1856, probably at its normal magnitude. It was the first temporary star to be " studied by the unh·ersal chemical method "-the spectroscope. Near its place the Variabilia Coronae, now lettered R, was discovered by Pigott in 1795, still varying from 5.8 to 13, but with much irregularity. Professor Young repeats the {3aydEt of Cassiopeia as a help to the memory in locating the stars of this constellation. The extreme northern one is 8, but then follow in order (3, a, y, d, E, ,. They form an almost perfect semicircle 20° northeast of Arcturus. Argelander gives a total of 27 stars visible to the naked eye; and Heis, 31.

Alpheooa, the Alphaca of Burritt's Atlas of 1835, was Ulug Beg's Al lf&'ir al :Pakkah, the Bright One of the Dish, this Nii"ir being equivalent to the Latin word l11t"itla. Bayer asserted that the Arabs knew this star as Po.pill&, which also appears in the nomenclature of the constellation, with a possible clue to its derivation; but as the word belongs to Lyra, and is certainly not Arabic. we may have to recur to first principles for its origin in the classical .Fhf'illa. Kunir, found with Bayer as of the " Babylonians,"- by whom he probably intended those gifted in astrology,- is from the Arabs, and synonymous with their Nair. Chilmead gave this as Kunic. In Vergil's Georgia it was Gnoaia Stella Ooronae.
Gemma. and Gemma Ooronae were not used in classical times, but are later titles, perhaps from Ovid's 1;emmasque 11011em that Vulcan combined with his auro to make Ariadne's Crown; but Spence said, in his PolyNUtis. that the word should be taken in its original meaning of a Bud, referring to the unopened blossoms and leaves of the floral crown, thus agreeing with the early idea of the figure.

occasionally transformed into Saint Jlarguerite. It marks the loop, or knot, of the ribbon along which are fastened the buds, flowers, or leaves of the wreath shown in early drawings with two long out-streaming ends. The spectrum is of Secchi's Solar type ; and the star is receding from our system at the rate of about twenty miles a second. It has a distant 8thmagnitude companion, and culminates on the 28th of June. It marks the radiant point of the Coronids, the meteor shower visible from the 12th of April to the 30th of June. {3, a 4th-magnitude northwest from Alphecca, is llusakan in the 2d edition of the Palermo C11talog11e, derived from the Masakin of the constellation. y, '1, and a, although unnamed, are all interesting binary stars.

Although now traversed by the 20th degree of south declination, 2000 years ago it lay equally on each side of the celestial equator. It contains only 15 naked-eye stars according to Argelander,-26 according to Heis,yet was a noted constellation with the Gret"ks and Romans, and always more or less associated with the Cup and with the Hydra, on whose body it rests. Ovid said of this combination in his Fasli:
Continuata loco tria sidera, Corvus et Anguis, Et medius Crater inter ulrumque jacet;
but while always so drawn, the three constellations for a long time have been catalogued separately. The Greeks called it Kopaf, Raven; and the Romans, Corvus. Manilius designating it as Phoebo Sacer Ales, and Ovid as Phoebeiua Alee, mythology having made the bird sacred to Phoebus Apollo in connection with his prophetic functions, and because he assumed its shape during the conflict of the gods with the giants.

_Ovid, narrating in the Metamorphoses the story of Coronis, and of her unfaithfulness to Apollo,1 said that when the bird reported to his master this unwelcome news he was changed from his former silver hue to the present black, as Saxe concludes the story:
Then he turned upon the Raven, "Wanton babbler! see thy fate! Messenger of mine no longer, Go to Hades with thy prate!
"Weary Pluto with thy tattle! Hither, monster, come not back; And- to match thy disposition Henceforth he thy plumage black! "
This story gave rise to the stellar title Garrulua Proditor. Another version of the legend appears in the Fasti -viz., that the bird. being sent with a cup for water, loitered at a fig-tree till the fruit became ripe. and then returned to the god with a water-snake in his claws and a lie in his mouth, alleging the snake to have been the cause of his delay. In punishment he was forever fixed in the sky with the Cup and the Snake; and, we may infer, doomed to everlasting thirst by the guardianship of the Hydra over the Cup and its contents. From all this came other poetical names for our Corvus -Avis Ficariue, the Fig Bird; and Bmaneor, one who stays beyond his time; and a belief, in early folk-lore, that this alone among birds did not carry water to its young. Florus called it Avis Satyra, the Bird of the Satyrs, and Pomptina, from the victory of Valerius when aided by a raven on the Pontine Marsh. This bird and an ass appear together on a coin of Mindaon, which is interpreted as a reference to the almost simultaneous setting of the constellations Corvus and Cancer, for the ass always has been associated with the latter in the •ovot, or Asini, of its stars. The Raven of Rome and Greece became Al Ghurib in Arabia; but in , earlier days four of its stars were Al 'Anh al Simik al 'A.l&l, the Throne of the Unarmed One, referring to the star Spica. These naturally hal'f been considered {J, ')', t5, and 1/; but Firuzabadi, as interpreted by Lach, said
that they were 0, K, i/J, and g; and the same stars were Al 'Ajz al And, the Rump of the ancient Lion. Other early titles for the whole were Al A.jmil,

Instead of Ajmal, Hyde quoted, from the ilfud:fizat, Ahmal, or ]Jamal, the Ram, but this does not seem probable here. As these stars were utilized by the Arabs in forming their exaggerated Asad, so also were they by the Hindus in the immense Praja·piti, of which they marked the hand,-this title being duplicated for Orion, and much better known for that constellation. The head of the figure was marked by Citra, our Spica, and the thighs by the two Vi~akhas, a and /3 Librae;
while the Anuradhas, /3, o, and rr Scorpii, formed Praja-pati's standing-place. Incongruously enough, they considered Nishtya, or Svati,-our star Arcturus,- as the heart; but as this was far out of the proper place for that organ, Professor Whitney substituted,, K, and ;t Virginis of the ma11zil and sieu. The Avesta mentions a stellar Raven, Eoroach; but how, if at all, this coincided with ours is unknown; although Hewitt thinks that our Corvus, under the title Vanant, marked the western quarter of the earliest Persian heavens. Nor is the reason for the association of Corvus with Hydra evident, although there is a Euphratean myth, from far back of classical days, making it one of the monster ravens of the brood of Tia.mat that Hydra represented; and upon a tablet appears a title that may be for Corvus as the Great Storm Bird, or Bird of the De1ert, to which Tia.mat gave sustenance, just as Aratos described K6pa{ pecking the folds of t~e Hydra. The prominent stars of Corvus have otherwise been identified with the Akkadian Xurra, the Horse. The Hebrews knew it as 'Orebh, or Orev, the Raven; and the Chinese, as a portion of their great stellar division the Red Bird, while its individual stars were an Imperial Chariot ruling, or riding upon, the wind. In later days it has been likened to lloah'1 Raven flying over the Deluge, or alighting on Hydra, as there was no dry land for a resting-place; or one of those that fed the prophet Elijah; but Julius Schiller combined its stars with those of Crater in his Ark of the Covenant.

opening to the northwest. This was long considered a part of the threefold constellation Hydra et Corv1ll et Crater; but modern astronomers catalogue it separately, Argelander assigning to it 14 stars, and Heis extending the number to 35. In early Greek days it represented the Kdv8apor, or Goblet, of Apollo, but universally was called KpaTf/p, which in our transliterated title obtained with all Latins, Cicero writing it Cratera; while Manilius described it as gratu Iaccho Crater, so using the mystic, poetical name often applied to Bacchus. In ancient manuscripts it appears as Creter. The Greeks also called it Ka.b77, a Cinerary Urn; 'Ap-yeiov, 'Tdpeiov, and 'Tdpia, a Waterbucket. The Romans additionally knew it as Urna, Calix, or Scyphu1, and, poetically, asPooulum, the Cup, variously, of Apollo, Bacchus, Hercules, Achilles, Dido, Demophoon, and Medea; its association with this last bringing it into the long list of Argonautic constellations. · Hewitt connected it with the Soma-cup of prehistoric India; and Brown with the Ki.mg-bowl in the Euphratean myth of Istar-Kirke, referring to the words of the prophet Jeremiah :
Babylon hath been a golden cnp in the Lord's hand.
But any connection here would seem doubtful, although the Jews knew it as Cos, a Cup. Hewitt also identifies it with "the Akkadians' ltummu Tiimut, the chaos of the sea, the mother of heaven and earth, and the child of Tiamut, the mother (mut) of living things (tia) "; but all this better suits Corvus. It was known in England two or three centuries ago as the Two-handed Pot; and Smyth tells us of a small ancient vase in the Warwick collection bearing an inscription thus translated:
Wise ancients knew when Crater rose to sight, Nile's fertile deluge had attained its height;
although Egyptian remains thus far show no allusion to the constellation. In early Arabia it was Al lta'laf, the Stall,-a later title there for the Praesaepe of Cancer; but when the astronomy of the Desert came under Greek influence it was Al Biμyah, the Persian Badiye, and the Al Batinah of Al Achsasi, all signifying an earthen vessel for storing wine. Another title, Al Kia, a Shallow Basin,-A.lhas in the Alfonsine lists,-has since been turned into Alter and Elkis; but Scaliger's suggestion of Altes generally has been adopted, although now applied to the star a. These same Tables Latinized it as Patera, and as Vu, or Vu aquarium.

A fifth star, E,. of the 4th magnitude, between a and d, somewhat interferes with the regularity of the figure; and there are forty-nine others visible to the naked eye within the constellation boundaries. The statement that it was mentioned by Hipparchos probably is erroneous, although he distinctly alluded to its {j as of the Centaur; but Pliny may have known it as Thronoa Caesaris in honor of the emperor Augustus; yet it was then invisible from Italy, though plainly visible from Alexandria, where it may have been thus named by some courtly astronomer. And Al Biriini wrote that a star could be seen from Multan in India, in 30° 12' of north latitude, " ,qhich they call Siila," the Beam of Crucifixion. This, if a referehce to the Cross, is· a striking anticipation of the modern figure. Hewitt, repeating this title as ,hula, claimed it for the south pole of Hindu astronomers. Whittier said, in his Cry of a Lost Soul:
The Cross of pardon lights the tropic skies ;
which is correct for our day, as it is not now entirely visible above 27° 30' of north latitude. It was last seen on the horizon of Jerusalem -31° 46' 45" -about the time that Christ was crucified. But 3000 years previously all its stars were 7° above the horizon of the savages along the shores of the Baltic Sea, in latitude 52° 30'. Its invention as a constellation is often attributed to Royer as of 1679, but it had been the theme of much description for nearly two centuries before him, and we know that it was illustrated by Mollineux of England, in 1592, on his celestial globe, with others of the new southern figures; and Bayer drew it over the hind legs of the Centaur, giving it in his text as modernis m,:r, Ptolemaeo pedes Cenlauri. Bartschius had it separately in 1624, and Caesius catalogued it in 1662 as though well known; hence it seems remarkable that it was only outlined over the Centaur in the Flamsteed Atlas. Crux lies in the Milky Way,-here a brilliant but narrow stream three or four degrees wide,- and is noticeable from its compression as well as its fonn, being only 6° in extent from north to south, and less in width, the upper star a clear orange in color, and the rest white; the general effect being that of a badly made kite rather than of a cross. So that, notwithstanding all the poetry and romance associated with it,-perhaps owing to these,-it usually disappoints those from northern latitudes who see it for the first time.

186 Star-Names and their Meanings
For twelve centuries, from Pliny to Dante, we find no allusion to its stars till that great poet, turning from his contemplation, in the .Purgatorio, of Venus " veiling the Fishes,"
posi mente Al altro polo e vidi quatro stelle Non viste mai fuor che alla prima genie,
in which Baron Alexander von Humboldt, in his Examen Crilicum, insists that he refers to the Cross; while Longfellow, translating the passage
and fixed my mind Upon the other pole and saw four stars Ne'er seen before save by the primal people,
calls it an acknowledged reference to the same, figuring, as it were, the cardinal virtues, Justice, Prudence, Fortitude, and Temperance, attributes of Cato as the Guardian of Purgatory, claiming that
We here are Nymphs and in the Heaven are Stars.
Later on in the same canto we read again of Cato :
The rays of the four consecrated stars Did so adorn his countenance with light.
But this reference to the " primal people" is not, Barlow says in his Stud)· of Dante, to our first parents, as Cary's translation has it, but to the early races of mankind, who 5000 years ago could see the Cross from latitudes very much higher even than that of Italy. In the same passage Dante alludes to its local invisibility in his apostrophe to the northern heavens:
0 ! thou septentrional and widowed site Because thou art deprived of seeing these!
and in the 8th canto calls them Le quatro chiare ste/le. Whence Dante learned all this we do not know, for it was not till 200 years later that we have any published account of the constellation; but that he paid great attention to the heavens is evident from his frequent and intelligent allusions to them throughout the Divine Comedy. He was, too, a man of erudition as well as of imagination and poetical genius,- Carlyle called him the spokesman of ten silent centuries,-and may have seen some of the Arabic celestial globes, on at least one of which - probably the Borgian of 122 5 - we know that the stars of the Centaur were represented; and he doubtless had frequent opportunities of intercourse with learned

travelers,1 or some of the many returned voyagers among his own adventurous countrymen, worthy successors to their ancient neighbors the Phoenicians. This should be sufficient to account for these allusions without attributing them to prophetic inspiration. And here, although in no way connected with the Cross, I would call attention to a fact pleasing to starlovers -viz., "the beautiful and endless aspiration, so artistically and silently suggested by Dante, in closing each part of his poem with the word ste/le."
The Inferno ends with:
Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars;
the .P'urgaforio:
Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars;
and the .Paradiso:
The love which moves the sun and the other stars.
Note, too, the poet's perhaps unconscious advance in astronomical knowledge beyond his contemporaries in associating the sun with the stars. Vespucci, on his third voyage in 1501, called to mind the passages from Dante, insisting that he himself was the first of Europeans to see the Four Stars, but did not use the title of the Cross, and called them Kandorla.2 V asco da Gama said of it in the Lusiadas:
A group quite new in the new hemisphere, Not seen by others yet;
while nearly four centuries after him, in our day, Lord Lytton (Owen Meredith) has something similar in his Queen Guenevere:
Then did I reel as one who, much perplex!, Led by strange lf'gends and the light of stars Over long regions of the midnight sand Beyond the red tract of the Pyramids, Is suddenly drawn to look upon the sky, From sense of unfamiliar light, and sees, Reveal'd against the constellated cope, The great cross of the South.
Writers of the 16th century made frequent mention of it in their accounts ofsouthem navigation; Corsali saying in 1517, as translated by Eden:
I Marco Polo was his contemporary. 1 This, literally " an Almond," is the word used in Italian art for the vtsciaz Jiscis, the oblong glory, surrounding the bodies of saints ascending to heaven.

Subsequently, in 1520, Pigafetta, the companion of Magellan, mentioned it as El Crucero, and una croce maravigliosa used for the determination of altitudes, saying that Dante first described it; Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa called it the Star Cruoero and the Stars of Cruoero; Blundevill, in 1574,

Crosier and, very differently, the South Triangle, but this was twenty-nine years before Bayer gave this title to other stars. Eden also cited the Croaiera and Croue Stan; Chilmead, Cruaero and Cruaien; Sir John Narborough, Croaen; and Halley, in 1679, Oroaien. A century before Halley, the Portuguese naturalist Cristoval d'Acosta, writing the title Cruzero,- the old Spanish Cruciero,- termed the Cross the Southern Celestial Clock; and as such it has served a useful purpose for nearly 400 years. Von Humboldt, in his Voyage lo /he Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent, alluding to the Portuguese and Spaniards, wrote :
A religious sentiment attaches them to a constellation the form of which recalls the sign of the faith planted by their ancestors in the deserts of the New World;
a thought which Mrs. Hemans beautifully expressed in her Cross of /he Suuth where the Spanish traveler says:
But to thee, as thy lode-stars resplendently burn In their clear depths of blue, with devotion I turn, Bright Cross of the South! and beholding thee shine, Scarce regret the loved land of the olive and vine. Thou recallest the ages when first o'er the main My fathers unfolded the ensign of Spain, And planted their faith in the regions that see Its imperishing symbol ever blazoned in thee,
Von Humboldt adds:
The two great stars, which mark the summit and the foot of the Cross, having nearly the same right ascension, it follows that the constellation is almost perpendicular at the moment when it passes the meridian. This circumstance is known to the people of every nation situated beyond the Tropics or in the southern hemisphere. It has been observed at what hour of the night, in different seasons, the Cross is erect or inclined. It is a time piece, which advances very regularly nearly four minutes a day, and no other group of stars affords to the naked eye an observation of time so easily made. How often have we heard our guides exclaim in the savannahs of Venezuela and in the desert extending from Lima to Truxillo," Midnight is past, the Cross begins to bend." How often these words reminded us of that affecting scene when Paul and Virginia, seated near the source of the river of I..ataniers, conversed together for the last time, and when the old man, at the sight of the Cross, warns them that it is time to separate, saying, "la Croix du Sud rst droite sur I' horizon."
Von Humboldt thought it remarkable that these so striking and well-defined stars should not have been earlier separated from the large ancient constellation of the Centaur, especially since Kazwini and other Muhammadan astronomers took pains to discover crosses elsewhere in the sky; and he



190 Star-Names and their Meanings
said that the ancient Persians, who knew the Cross well, celebrated a feast by its name, their descendants, to whom it was lost by precession, finding its successor in the Dolphin. The Pareni Indians of his day made much of the stars of the Cross, calling them Bahumehi, after one of their principal fishes. Lockyer alludes to it as the Pole-ltar of the South, which it may be when on the meridian, as the most prominent constellation in the vicinit~· of the pole, although its base star is nearly 28° from that point, about four and one halftimes the length of the Cross. But this idea is an old one; Minsheu's Guide having, at the word " Cruzero," Quatuor std/a poli, Fa,m starres crossing; and Sarmiento, even earlier, had much the same, but asserted that, "with God's help," he was enabled to select another polestar nearer the true point. In modern China it has been Shih Tue Kea, the equivalent of our word. The five stars are shown on postage stamps of Brazil,-Camf>es' Realms of the Holy Cross,-surrounded by twenty-one stars symbolizing the twenty· one states, and some of the coins bear the same. But this name for that country was not new with the poet, for it was given by the discoverer Cabral, on the 1st of May, 1500; and the fine Ptolemaeus printed at Rome in 15081 with the first engraved map of the new continent, carries as its title for South America, Terra sancte crucis. Partly within the constellation's boundaries, and at the point of the nearest approach of the Milky Way to the south pole, is the pear-shaped Coal-11&clt, or Soot-bag, 8° in length by 5° in breadth, containing only one star visible to the naked eye, and that very small, although it has many that are telescopic, and a photograph taken at Sydney in 1890 shows about as many in proportion as in the surrounding region. This singular vacancy was first formally described by Peter Martyr, although observed in 1499 by Vicente Yanez Pinzon, and designated by Vespucci as il Canopo folco, and perhaps alluded to by Camr>es. Narborough wrote of it in 1671 as ··a small black cloud which the foot of the Cross is in "; but before him it was Jhcula llagellani, Magellan's Spot, and fifty years ago Smyth mentioned it as the Black llagellanio Cloud. Froude described it in his Ouana as "the inky spot-an opening into the awful solitude of unoccupied space.'' A native Australian legend, which "reads almost like a Christian parable.'' says that it was "the embodiment of evil in the shape of an Emu, who lies in wait at the foot of a tree, represented by the stars of the Cross, for an opossum driven by his persecutions to take refuge among its branches." The Peruvians imagined it a heavenly Doe suckling its fawn. Although this is the most remarkable of those" curious vacancies through

Al Tizini defined its position as near the ankle-bone of the right hind foot of the Centaur, in which Bayer's plate agrees, lettering it {. It was discovered to be double by some Jesuit missionaries sent by King Louis XIV to Siam in 1685; and another companion, of the 6th magnitude, is 60" away. The two larger stars are 5" apart, with a position angle of 120°. a lies 2° east of the equinoctial colure, and, at its culmination, touches the horizon in latitude 27° 30' on the 13th of May, due south from Corvus. y, the uppermost star, is on the horizon of the Lowe Observatory, at an elevation of 3700 feet, in latitude 34° 20'. Gould thinks it variable, for it has been variously estimated, even by the same observer, as from 1.8 to 2.4. Around the 6,1⁄2-magnitude " is the celebrated cluster of colored stars, ~- G. C. 4755, occupying one forty-eighth of a square degree of space; the central and principal one being of a deep red, surrounded by about 130 others, green, blue, and of various shades; but Miss Clerke writes :
It must be con fessed that, with moderate telescopic apertures, it fails to realize the effect ofcolour implied by Sir John Herschel's [its discoverer] comparison to" a gorgeous piece of fancy je..-ellery." A few reddish stars catch the eye at once; but the blues, greens and yellows belonging to their companions are pale tints, more than half drowned in white light.
Gould, however, called it exquisite!) beautiful.

called him, who for thirty years had been the gatherer and keeper of the harvest of comets, and the discoverer of twelve between the years of 1794 and 1798. This title also may have been ind\lced by the fact that the two neighboring royal personages were rulers of an agricultural people, and the Giraffe an animal destructive to the grain-fields; all perhaps selecterl because the Phoenicians are said to have imagined a large Wh•t lield in this part of the sky. Its inventor was the enthusiastic astronomer who would spend nights on the Pont Neuf over the Seine, explaining the wonders of the variable Algol to all whom he could interest in the subject, and whose seclusion in his observatory, amid the turmoil of the French Revolution, enabled him to "thank his stars" that he had escaped the fate of so many of his friends. Custos has now passed out of the recognition of astronomers.

Padus and transported to the sky.1 Associated, too, with Leda, the friend of Jupiter and mother of Castor, Pollux, and Helena, it was classed among the Argonautic constellations, and Helenae Genitor, with other names derived from the well-known legend, was applied to it. Popularly the constellation was .Alee, Avil, and Volucria, a Bird,- .Alee lovia, Alea Leclaeua, and Avil Venerill,- while Olor, another word for the Swan, both ornithological and stellar, has been current even to modern times. Phoebi Aueuor is cited by La Lande, the bird being sacred to that deity; and Vultur cadens is found for it, but this was properly Lyra's title. .\s the bird of Venus it also has been known as llyrtilua, from the myrtle sacred to that goddess ; and it was considered to be Orpheu, placed after death in the heavens, near to his favorite Lyre. Our Cygnus may have originated on the Euphrates, for the tablets show a stellar bird of some kind, perhaps Urakhga, the original of the Arabs' Rukh, the Roe, that Sindbad the Sailor knew. At all events, its present figuring did not originate with the Greeks, for the history of the constellation had been entirely lost to them, as had that·of the mysterious Engonasin, - an evident proof that they were not the inventors of at least some of the ,tar-groups attributed to them. In Arabia, although occasionally known as .Al ~•ir al Ardiif, the Flying Eagle, Chilmead's Alt.ayr, or as .Al Radif, it usually was .Al Dajijah, the Hen, and appears as such even with the Egyptian priest Manetho, about 300 B. c., this degenerating into the Adige, Adigege, .Aldigaga, Addigagato, Degige, Bdegiagith, Bldigiagich, etc., of early lists, some of these even now .1pplied to its brightest star. Scaliger's Al Ridhadh, for the constellation, which degenerated to Bl Rided, perhaps is the origin of our Arided for the 'tucida, but its signification is uncertain, although the word is said to have been found in an old LatinSpanish-Arabic dictionary for some sweet-scented flower. Hyde gives Kathi for it, the Arabic .Al Ka~t, a bird in form and size like a pigeon; indeed, Al Sufi's translator, Schjellerup, defined the latter's title for it, Al fi'ir, as le pigeon de poste; but Al Katat is now the Arabs' word for a common gallinaceous game-bird of the desert, perhaps the mottled partridge. The Aljonsine Tables, in the recent Madrid edition, supposed to be a reproduction of the original, illustrate their Galina by a forlorn Hen instead

of a Swan, with the bungled Arabic title altayr aldipya, although elsewhere they say O/or: Hyparcus Cyg11um vocal; the Arabo-.Lalin Almagest of 1515 had Burilim: et est volans: et jam vocalur ga//ina. et tlicitur eurisim qlllJSi redo/ens ut /ilium ab ireo; the Alfonsine Tables of 1521 have HJT81Y]D,i d dicitur quasi redo/ens 111 /ilium: et est 1•0/ans: eljam 1•ocatur gallina; Bayer wrote of it, quasi Rosa redo/ens Lilium_: Riccioli, quasi Galli rosa; and contemporaries of this last author wrote Hirezym and Hierilim. ldeler's comments on all this well show the roundabout process by which some of our star-names have originated, and are worthy quotation entire:
They have, moreover, made use of the translated Greek •op11,r, as is shown by the Borgian Globe, on which is written Liirnia, or ll'l'llil (for the first letter is not connected with the second, so that we have both readings). It is most probable that from thi> Urnis originated the Eurisim in the foregoing rare title. Probably the translator found in the Arabic original the, to him, foreign word Urnis. He naturally surmised that it was Greek, only he did nol know its proper signification. On the other hand, the plant 'Eploa1μ.o11 (Erysimum o.fficinak, Linn.) occurred to him, which the Romans called lrro (see Pliny, Hist. Nat. xviii, 10, xxii, 25), and this recalled the richly scented Iris or Sword Lily (Iris jl1JTmtina, Linn.), and so, as it seems to me, he traced the thought through a perfectly natural association of ideas to his beautiful Eurisim, quasi ndolnu, Ml /ilium ab ireo. At the same time I believe I have here struck the trail of the title Albireo, which has never yet been satisfactorily explained. This is given to the star on the beak,-~.by Bayer and in our charts. It seems to me to be nothing more than the above a6 irrP, which came to be turned into an Arabic star-name by means of an interpolated /.
The early Gallina continued in use by astronomers even to the last century. Cygnus usually is shown in full flight down the Milky Way, the Stream of Heaven," uppoised on gleaming wings"; but old drawings have it appar· ently just springing from the ground. Caesius thought that the constellation represented the Swan in the Authorized Version of Leviticus xi, 18, the Timshiimath of the Hebrews; but this is a Homed Owl in the Revision, or may have been an Ibis.
Other Christians of his time saw here the Crou of Calvaey, Chrilti Crux, , as Schickard had it, Schiller's Crux cum 8. Helena; these descending to our day as the llorthern Croa1, well known to all, and to beginners in stellar observations probably better than by the stars' true title. Lowell was familiar with it, and thus brings it into his New Year's Eve, z844:

This Cross is formed by a, y, 71, and {3, marking the upright along the Galaxy, more than 20° in length,,, e, y, and d being the transverse. These last also were an Arab asterism, .Al Fawiria, the Riders; a and ,c sometimes being added to the group. The Chinese story of the Herdsman, or Shepherd, generally told for our Aquila, and of his love for the skilful Spinster, our Lyra, occasionally includes stars in Cygnus. While interesting in many respects, it is especially so in possessing an unusual number of deeply colored stars, Birmingham writing of this :
A space of the heavens including the Milky Way, between Aquila, Lyra, and Cygnus, ,ecms so peculiarly favored by red and orange stars that it might not inaptly be called the Red Region, or the Red Region of Cygnus.
Argelander locates 146 naked-eye members of the constellation, and Heis 197, its situation in the Galaxy accounting for this density. Of these stars Espin gives a list of one hundred that are double, triple, or multiple. The Lace-wort Jiebula, N. G. C. 6960, also lies within its borders. We find among classical authors 'l,cTivo~, Miluus, Milvus, and Mylvius, taken from the .Parapegmata, and, even to modern days, supposed to be titles for our Cygnus, Aquila, or some unidentified sky figure; but Ideler showed that by these words reference probably was made to the Kite, the predaceous bird of passage annually appearing in spring, and not to any stellar object.

Deneb is from Al Dhanab al Dajijah, the Hen's Tail, which has become Denebadigege, Denebedigege, Deneb A.dige, etc.
In the Alfonsine Tables A.rided appears, and is still frequently seen for this star, as .Al B.idhidh and Bl B.ided formerly were for the constellation. Referring to this last title, Caesius termed a 01 roaae, the German Roaemund, although he also designated it as Uropygium, the Pope's Nose of our Thanksgiving dinner-tables. a also, and correctly enough, is A.ridif, from .Al B.idf, the Hindmost; but Bayer changed it to A.rrioph, and Cary to Arion, Bayer gave Gallina as an individual title. Mr. Royal Hill says that this and the three adjacent bright stars in tht: figure are known as the Triangle■.

Deneb has no sensible proper motion, and hence has been considered a, deserving the term, generally inappropriate, of a "fixed star" ; but spectroscopic investigations made at Greenwich seemed to show motion at the rate of thirty-six miles a second toward the earth, and so only apparent\) stationary. Such motion, Newcomb saysr would eventually carry it at some time,-probably between 100,000 and 300,000 years hence,- past our system at about 1-lm part of its present distance, making it the nearest and the brightest of the earth's neighbors. But Vogel's recent and more trustworthy measures at Potsdam give its rate as about five miles a seconci. Elkin estimated its parallax in 1892 as o".047,-practically insensiblr Its spectrum is Sirian.

Albireo, the now universal title, is in no way associated with Arabia. but apparently was first applied to the star from a misunderstanding as to thr words ab ireo in the description of the constellation in the 1515 Almogt;f. Albireo in the Standard Dictionary undoubtedly is from a type error, as als,, ' may be A.bbireo, Alberio, and Albeiro, which occasionally are used. The Arabians designated {3 as Al Jlinliar al Dajijah, the Hen's Bc.1k. where it is still located on our maps. Riccioli wrote this Kenkar Eldigia· gich; and also had Hierizim.
{3 is one of the show objects of the sky, and Miss Clerke, calling its color,
golden and azure, says that it presents "perhaps the most lovely effect ,i· colour in the heavens." Being 35" apart, the components can readily ht: resolved by a field-glass. The system, if binary, has a very long period 01 revolution, as yet undetermined, the present position angle being 560. Close to {3 appeared a nova on the 20th of June, 1670, described by thr Carthusian monk Anthelmus of Dijon. This disappeared after two years of varying brilliancy, but may still exist as a 10th- to nth-magnitude variable. discovered, in the supposed location, by Hind in 1852.
In the neck of the Swan, not far from {3, is the variable x2, ranging from 4.5 to 13.5 in 406 days. Sometimes, at its maximum, it is of only the 6th magnitude.

}', 2.7, is Sadr,-incorrectly Sudr,-from Al Sadr al DajiJah, the Hen's Breast, and one of the l'&wlril of the Arabs. Reeves said that in China it was Tien Tlin, the name of a city ; but this generally was given to the group of four stars, a, /3, y, and cJ.
r is in the midst of beautiful streams of small stars, itself being involved in a diffused nebulosity extending to a ; while the space from it to /3 perhaps is richer than any of similar extent in the heavens. Espin asserts that around y and the horns of Taurus seem to centre the stars showing spectra of the fourth type. Its own spectrum is Solar. According to observations at Potsdam, it is in motion toward us at the rate of about four miles a second.
s, 2.6, yellow,
on the right wing, is Gienah, from the Arabic Al 1anil1,, the Wing. Between a, y, and this star is the liorthern Coal-aack, an almost vacant space in the Milky Way; another, still more noticeable and celebrated, coincidently being located in the Southern Cross. 6° to the northeast from e is 61 Cygni, with a parallax of o".5, and thus, so far as we now know, the nearest star to us in the northern heavens, with the exception of La Lande 21185 Ursae Majoris. If the distance from the earth to the sun be considered as one inch, that to this star would be about seven and one half miles. It also is remarkable for its great proper motion toward the star a,- 511• 16 annually,- near to which it probably will be in r 5,000 years. 4000 years ago it was near e. It is a double 6th-magnitude, and may be binary, the components 20"

P, or FI. 34, a 5th-magnitude, located at the base of the Swan's neck, is one of the few so-called gaseous stars having bright lines in their spectra. It was discovered by Janson, as a nova of the 2d magnitude, on the 18th of August, 1600; was numbered 27 in Tycho's catalogue, with the designation of nova anni 1600 in pee/ore Cygni; and Kepler thought it worthy of a monograph in 1606. Christian Huygens, the Dutch astronomer of the 17th century, called it the Bevenante of the Swan, from its extraordinary light changes; but these now seem to have ceased.

is Dauphin in France, Delfino in Italy, and Delphin in Germany: all from the Greek t:.e).q,lt; and t:.e).qi[v, transcribed by the Latins as Delphia and Delphin. This last continued current through the 17th century, and in our day was resumed by Proctor for his reformed list. Chaucer, in the Hous of Fame, had Delphyn, and later than he it was Dolphyne. It now is one of the smallest constellations, but originally may have included the stars that Hipparchos set off to form the new Equuleus; and in all astronomical literature has borne its present title and shape, with many and varied stories attached, for its namesake was always regarded a!! the most remarkable of marine creatures.
1 What is this last? It seems to have escaped comment by all of the authorities.



The Constellations
In Greece it also was "Iepo~ 'lxOvr, the Sacred Fish, the creature being of as much religious· significance there as a fish afterwards became among the early Christians; and it was the sky emblem of philanthropy, not only from the classical stories connected with its prototype, but also from the latter's devotion to its young. It should be remembered that our stellar Dolphin is figured as the common cetacean, Delphinus delplzis, of Atlantic and Mediterranean waters, not the tropical Corypl,arna that Dorado represents. Ovid, designating it as clarum sidus, personified it as Amphitrite, the goddess of the sea, because the dolphin induced her to become the wife of Neptune, and for this service, Manilius said, was " rais'd from Seas" to be
The Glory of the Floud and of the Stars.
From this story the constellation was known as Penuasor Amphitrites, as well as lleptunua and Triton. \Vith Cicero it appeared as Curvus, an adjective that appropriately has been applied to the creature's apparent form ·in all ages 1 down to the " bended dolphins" in Milton's picture of the Creation. Bayer's Currtll merely is Cicero's word with a typographical error, for he explained it, Cuero11i ob gibbum in dorso; but he also had Bmon nautis, and Riccioli Smon barbaris, which seems to be the Simon, Flat-nosed, of old-time mariners, quoted by Pliny for the animal. Another favorite title was Vector Arioni1, from the Greek fable that attributed to the dolphin the rescue of Arion on his voyage from Tarentum to Corinth - a variation of the very much earlier myth of the sun-god Baal Hamon. Hence comes Henry Kirke White's
lock'd in silence o'er Arion's star, The slumbering night rolls on her velvet car.
In continuation of the Greek story of Arion and his Lyre appears Movni"6v ,wdiov, the J[uicum lignum of the Latins; or this may come from the fact mentioned in Ovid's Fasti that the constellation was supposed to contain nine stars, the number of the Muses, although Ptolemy prosaically catalogued 10; Argelander, 20; and Heis, 31. Riccioli and La Lande cited Hennippua for Delphinus, and Aoete■ after the pirate-pilot who protected Bacchus on his voyage to N axos and Ariadne; while to others it represented Apollo returning to Crissa or piloting Castalius from Crete.
1 Huet, in his notes on Manilius, quoted many examples of the use of this term by the
Latins, and said Perpet,,am hoc Delpkinum Epilketon.

The Hindus, from whom the Greeks are said to have borrowed it,although the reverse of this may have been the case,...:... knew it as Shi-lb.umira, or Bim-shu-mira, changed in later days to Zinmara, a Porpoise, also ascribed to Draco. And they located here the 22d nakskalra, Qravilhthi, Most .Favorahle, also called Dhanilhthi, Richest; the Vasus, Bright or Good Ones, being the regents of this asterism, which was figured as a Drum or Tabor; {3 marking the junction with Catabishaj. Brown thinks that it may have been the Euphratean Kakhar, although Capricorn also claimed this.
Al Biriini, giving the Arabic title Al ¥&'id, the Riding Camel, said that the early Christians - the Melkite 1 and Nestorian sects - considered it the Cross of Jeana transferred to the skies after his crucifixion; but in Kazwini's day the learned of Arabia called a, {J, y, and d Al 'Vpd, the Pearls or Precious Stones adorning Al '8,llb, by which title the common people knew this Cross; the star E, towards the tail, being Al 'A.mud al ~1,, the Pillar of the Cross. B\lt the Arabian astronomers adopted the Greek figure as their Dulfim, which one of their chroniclers described as" a marine animal friendly to man, attendant upon ships to save the drowning sailors." The Alfo11si11e Jab/es of 1545 said of Delphinus, Quae habel stellas qUM sapiunt naturnm, a generally puzzling expression, but common in the 1551 translation of the Tetrabiblos, where it signifies stars supposed to be cognizant of human births and influential over human character,- nal11ra111. Ptolemy. as is shown in these Four Books, was a believer in the genethliacal influence of certain stars and constellations, of which this seems to have been one specially noted in that respect. Delphinus lies east of Aquila, on the edge of the Milky Way, occupying. with the adjoining aqueous figures, the portion of the sky that Aratos called the Water. It culminates about the 15th of September. Caesius placed here the Leviathan of the 104th Psalm; Novidius, the Great Fish that swallowed Jonah; but Julius Schiller knew some of its star.; as the Water-pot& of Cana. Popularly it now is Job's Coffin, although thr date and name of the inventor of this title I have not been able to learn. The Chinese called the four chief stars and { Kwa Chaou, a Gourd.

seemingly a great puzzle to Smyth, which he perhaps never solved, although he was very intimate with the staff of the Palermo Observatory. Webb, however, discovered their origin by reversing the component letters, and so reading Nicolaus Ve11ator, the Latinized form of Niccolo Cacciatore, the name of the assistant and successor of Piazzi. But Miss Rolleston, in her singular book Mazzaroth, considered in some quarters as of authority, wrote that they are derived, a from the
Arabic Scalooin, swift (,is th,·jlm,, ofwat,·r); and i3 from the

The components are golden and bluish green, and a fine object for small glasses. f, a 4th-magnitude, although lying near the dorsal fin of our present figure. bears t~e very common name Deneb, from Al Dbanab al Dulfim, the Dolphin's Tail. But in Arabia it also was Al 'Amid al fallb, as marking the Pillar of the Cross. In China it was Pae Cbaou, the Rotten Melon. The comparative brilliancy of (3, ')', d, and e has been variously estimated - a fact which the observations of Gould at Albany in 1858, and at Cordoba rn 1871-74, prove to be occasioned by variability, within moderate limits, oi all four.

dered Gold Field; and Craver, in the Colas' list of the Celestial Handbook of 1892, is equally erroneous. Chilmead mentions it as the Oilthead fish, but this, in ichthyology, was a very different fish, the Crenilabrus mt/ops of British coasts. Caesius combined its stars with the Greater Cloud and the Flying Fish to form his Old Testament figure of Abel the Jut. The alternative title Xiphiaa, the Swordfish, I first find in the Rudolplzint Jab/es of 1627; Halley used it, in addition to Dorado, in his catalogue of 167 9; Flamsteed gave both names in his edition of Sharp's catalogue; and the modem Stieler's planisphere still has Schwerdtflsch. Xipltias, however, had appeared in astronomy in the first century of our era, for Pliny applied it to sword-shaped comets, as Josephus did to that " which for a year ('.1 had hung over Jerusalem in the form of a sword,"-possibly Halley's comet of A. D. 66. The Rudolpltine Tables and Riccioli catalogued here 6 stars of 4th and 5th magnitudes, but Gould 42 from 3. 1 to 7. The head of Dorado marks the south pole of the ecliptic, so that, according to Caesius, the constellation gave its name to that point as the Polus Doradinalis. Within 3° of this pole is the very remarkable nebula 30 Doradus, that Smyth called the True Lover'• Knot, although now known as the Great Looped Nebula, N. G. C. 2070, described by Sir John Herschel as an assemblage of loops and one of the most extraordinary objects in the heavens,-" the centre of a great spiral." e appears in Reeves' list as Kin Yu, but this star being only a 5th-magnitude, and these words signifying a Goldfish, they doubtless were designed for the whole figure introduced into China by the Jesuits. ;, a 5th-magnitude, bears the Chinese title Kaou Pih.

and in the Latin Tables, as with some of the poets, it occasionally appeared, with the other starry snakes, as Anguia, Coluber, Python, and 8erpen1. From the latter came A81C1llapiu, and perhaps Audu. It was described in the Shield of Hercules, with the two Dogs, the Hare, Orion, and Perseus, as
The scaly horror of a dragon, coiled Full in the central field ;
and mythologists said that it was the Snake snatched by Minerva from the giants and whirled to the sky, where it became Bidu Mlnervae et Bacchi or the monster killed by Cadmus at the fount of Mars, whose teeth he sowed for a crop of armed men. Julius Schiller, without thought of its previous character, said that its stars represented the Holy Innocent.a of Bethlehem; others, more consistently, that it was the Old Serpent, the tempter of Eve in the Garden; Caesius likened it to the Great Dragon that the Babylonians worshiped with Bel; and Olaus Rudbeck,1 the Swedish naturalist of about 1700, said that his countrymen considered it the ancient symbol of the Baltic Bea ; but he also sought to show that Paradise was located in Sweden ! Delitzsch asserted that a Hebrew conception for its stars was a Quiver; but this must have been exceptional, for the normal figure with that people was the familiar Dragon, or a sea monster of some kind. Renan thought that the allusion of Job to " the crooked serpent" in our Authorized Version is to this, or possibly to that of Ophiuchus; but the Dragon would seem to be the most probable as the ancient possessor of the pole-star, then, as ours now is, the most important in the heavens; while this translation of the original is specially appropriate for such a winding figure. The Reverend Doctor Albert Barnes renders it " fleeing," and Delitzsch, " fugitive"; but the Revised Version has "swift," a very unsuitable epithet for Draco's slow motion, yet applicable enough to the more southern Hydra. Referring to Draco's change of position in respect to the pole from the effect of precession, Proctor wrote in his Myths and Marvels of Astronomy:
One might almost, if fancifully disposed, recognize the gradual displacement of the Dragon froni his old place of honour, in certain traditions of the downfall of the great Dragon whose "tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven," alluded to in The Rrodat,o,i ,di, 4;
and the conclusion of that verse, "did cast them to the earth," would show a possible reference to meteors.

Star-Names and their Meanings
In Persia Draco was Azhdehi, the Man-eating Serpent, occasionally transcribed Haahteher; and, in very early Hindu worship, Shi-ehu-min, the Alligator, or Porpoise, which also has heen identified with our Delphinus. Babylonian records allude to some constellation near the pole as a Snail drawn along on the tail of a Dragon that may have been our constellation; while among the inscriptions we find Sir, a Snake, but to which of the sky serpents this applied is uncertain. And some see here the dragon Tiimat,1 overcome by the kneeling sun-god Izhdubar or Gizdhubar, our Hercules, whose foot is upon it. Rawlinson, however, said that Draco represented Hea or Hoa, the third god in the Assyrian triad, also known as Kim-mut. As a Chaldaean figure it probably bore the horns and claws of the early typical dragon, and the wings that Thales utilized to form the Lesser Bear; hence these are never shown on our maps. But with that people it was a much longer constellation than with us, winding downwards and in front of Ursa Major, and, even into later times, clasped both of the Bears in its fold,: this is shown in manuscripts and books as late as the 17th century, with
the combined title Arctoe et Draco. It still almost incloses ursa Minor. The usual figuring is a combination of bird and reptile, magnus d lorl11j, a Konatrum mirabile and Konatrum audu, or plain Konatrum with Germanicus. Vergil had Kuim111 Anguil, which,
after the manner of a river, glides away with tortuous windings, around and through httween the Bears ;
a simile that may have given rise to another figure and title, found in the Argona11ticae,-Ladon, from the prominent river of Arcadia, or, more probably, the estuary bounding the Garden of the Hesperides, which, in the ordinary version of the story, Draco guarded,·• the emblem of eternal vigilance in that it never set." Here he was Ooluber arborem co11scendens, and C1lltoa Heaperidum, the Watcher over the golden fruit; this fruit and the uee bearing it being themselves stellar emblems, for Sir William Drummond wrote:
a fruit tree wa~ certainly a symbol of the starry heaven~, and the fruit typified the cor.stellations ;
and George Eliot, in her Spanish Gypsy_.
1 This notable creation of Euphratean mythology was the personification of primeval chaos, hostile to the gods and opposed to law and order; but Izhdubar conquered the monster in • struggle by driving a wind into its opened jaws and so splitting it in twain. Cetus, H)'dr.l and the Serpent of Ophiuchus also have been thought its symbols. Its representation " found on cylinder seals recently unearthed.

Draco's stars were circumpolar about 5000 B. c., and, like all those similarly situated,-of course few in number owing to the low latitude of the '.'.ile country,- were much observed in early Egypt, although differently figured than as with us. Some of them were a part of the Hippopotam111, or of its variant the Crocodile, and thus shown on the planisphere of Denderah and the walls of the Ramesseum at Thebes. As such Delitzsch says that it was Hea-mut, perhaps meaning the Raging Mother. An object re<embling a ploughshare held in the creature's paws has fancifully been said to have given name to the adjacent Plough. fhe hieroglyph for this Hippopotamus was used for the heavens in general; while the constellation is supposed to have been a symbol of Ilia Hathor, Athor, or Athyr, the Egyptian Venus; and Lockyer asserts that the myth of Horus which deals with the Hor-she-shu, an almost prehistoric people even in Egyptian records, makes undoubted reference to stars here ; although subsequently this myth was transferred to the Thigh, our Ursa Major. It is said that at one time the Egyptians called Draco Tanem, not unlike the Hebrew Tannim, or Aramaic Tannin, and perhaps of the same signification and derived from them. The Egyptian llecht was close to, or among, the stars of Draco; but its exact location and boundaries, how it was figured, and what it represented, are not known . .-\mong Arabian astronomers .Al Tinnin and .Al Thu'bin were translations of Ptolemy's J.pd1ewv; and on the Borgian globe, inscribed over {Jandy, arc the words Alghavil .Alt&nnin in Assemani's transcription, the Poisonous Dragon in his translation, assumed by him as referring to the whole con,tdlation. That there was some foundation for this may be inferred from the traditionary belief of early astrologers that when a comet was here poison was scattered over the world. Bayer cited from Turkish maps Btanin, and from others Aben, Taben, and Btabin ; Riccioli, A.been vel Taeben; Postellus, Daban; Chilmead, .Alanin; and Schickard, Atta.Dino. Al Shuji', the Snake, also was applied to Draco by the Arabians, as it
11a, to Hydra; and .Al J1anah, the Snake, appeared for it, though more 'ommon for our Serpens, with which word it was synonymous. Bayer had Palmee emeritua, the Exhausted Vine Branch, that I do not rind elsewhere; but the original is probably from the Arabs for some minor ~roup of the constellation. Williams mentions a great comet, seen from China in 1337, which passed through Yuen Wei, apparently some unidentified stars in Draco. The

creature itself was the national emblem of that country, but the Dragon of the Chinese zodiac was among the stars now our Libra. Edkins writes that Draco was Tai Kung, the Palace of the Heavenly Emperor, adding, although not very clearly, that this palace
is bounded by the stars of Draco, fifteen in number, which stretch themselves in an on! shape round the pole-star. They include the ,tar Tai :,i, f, o, a, s, of Draco, which is distant about ten degrees from the tail of the Bear and twenty-two from the present pole. It was itself the pole in the Epoch of the commencement of Chinese astronomy.
Draco extends over twelve hours of right ascension, and contains 130 naked-eye components according to Argelander; 220, according to Heis: but both of these authorities extend the tail of the figure, far beyond its star A, to a 4th-magnitude under the jaws of Camelopardalis,-much farther than is frequently seen on the maps.

Sayce says that the great astrological and astronomical work compiled for the first Sargon, king of Agade, or Akkad, devoted much attention to this star, then marking the pole, as Tir-An•na, the Life of Heaven; DaJIII Same, the Judge of Heavenj and Dayan Sidi, the Favorable Judge,-all representing the god Caga Gilgati, whose name it also bore. Brown applie. these titles to Wega of the Lyre, the far more ancient pole-star,- but this was 14,000 years ago !-and cited for a Draconis Dayan Bliru, the Prospering Judge, or the Crown of Heaven, and Dayan Shi.aha, the Judge Directing. as having the highest seat amongst the heavenly host. About 2750 B. c. it was less than 10' from the exact pole, although now more than 26°; and as it lies nearly at the centre of the figure, the whole constellation then visibly swung around it, as on a pivot, like the hands of a clock, but in the reverse direction.

Herschel considered that there is distinct evidence of Thuban formerly being brighter than now, as its title from its constellation, and its lettering, would indicate; for with Bayer it was a 2d-magnitude,- in fact the only one of that brilliancy in his list of Draco,- and generally so in star-catalogues previous to two centuries ago.

The word Tinnin is nearly synom mous with Thu'ban, and Bayer mentioned B.utaben as one of its titles, thl' Alfonsine B.uaben, and now B.utaban in .£he Ce11hlry• G_l,dopetlia ; but in early Arabic astronomy it was one of the Herd of Camels alluded to at J. Firuzabadi referred to a Ras al Tinnin and Dhanab al Tinnin in the heavem.. the Dragon's Head, and Tail ; but these have no connection with our Draco. reference being there made solely to the ascending and descending nodes in the orbits of the moon and planets known to Arabian astronomers under these titles. Primarily, however, these were from India, and kmown a, Rahu and Kitu. This idea seems to have originated from the fact that the moon's undulating course was symbolized by that of the stellar Hydra: anii had the latter word been used instead of" Dragon," the expression would now be better understood. But it was familiar to seamen as late as the 16th century, for "the head and tayle of the Dragon" 1 appears in Eden·, Dedication, of 1574, to Sir Wyllyam Wynter; and even now the symbols. ~ for the ascending node and 1'3 for the descending, are used in text-boo~and almanacs.
r has been a notable object in all ages. It was observed with a telescopt· by Doctor Robert Hooke in the daytime in 1669 while endeavoring tu determine its parallax, but his result afterwards was found to be due to the ' effect of aberration. Subsequently this star was used by Bradiey for the same purpose, although unsuccessfully; but, on the other hand, it g;n~ him his great discovery of the aberration of light,2 of which Hooke of courst was ignorant. Millenniums before this, however, it was of importance on the Nile. a, 1: ceased to be circumpolar about 5000 B. c., and a few centuries thereaiter became the natural successor of Dubhe (a Ursae Majoris), which up t,, that date had been the prominent object of Egyptian temple worship in tht north. y was known there as Ilia, or Taurt Ilia,- the former name JI'" plied at one time to Sirius,-and it marked the head of the Hippopotamu, that was part of our Draco. Its rising was visible about 3500 B. , . through the central passages of the temples of Hathor at Denderah and,,! Mut at Thebes; Canopus being seen through other openings toward thr south at the same date. And Lockyer says that thirteen centuries later 1: became the orientation point of the great Karnak temples of Rameses an<: Khans at Thebes, the passage in the former, through which the star \la,

observed, being 1500 feet in length; and that at least seven different temples were oriented toward it. When precession had put an end to this use of these temples, others are thought to have been built with the same purpose in view ; so that there are now found three different sets of structures close together, and so oriented that the dates of all, hitherto not certainly known, may be determinable by this knowledge of the purpose for which they were designed. Such being the case, Lockyer concludes that Hipparchos was not the discoverer of the precession of the equinoxes, as is generally supposed, but merely the publisher of that discovery made by the Egyptians, or perhaps adopted by them from Chaldaea. He also states that Apet, But, Kut, 8ekhet, and Taurt were all titles of one goddess in the Nile worship, symbolized by y Draconis. It is interesting to know that the Boeotian Thebes, the City of the Dragon, from the story of its founder, Cadmus, shared with its Egyptian namesake the worship of this star in a temple dedicated, so far as its orientation shows, about 1130 B. c. : a cult doubtless drawn from the parent city in Egypt, and adopted elsewhere in Greece, as also in Italy in the little temple to Isis in Pompeii. Here, however, the city authorities interfered with this star-worship in one of their numerous raids on the astrologers, and bricked up the opening whence the star was observed. y lies almost exactly in the zenith of Greenwich, in fact, has there been called the Zenith-1tar; and, being circumpolar, descends toward the horizon, but, without disappearing, rises easterly, and thus explains the poet's
line: the East and the West meet together.

The Jail, which is found in various lists, maps, and globes, would seem to be a typographical error, or an erroneous transliteration of the original Arabic. d also may have been one of Firuzabadi's two undetermined stars Al Ta)'JUin, the Two Goatherds.

Gia.mar and Giauzar are variously derived: either from Al Jauza', the Twins,-a little star is in close proximity,-orfrom Al Jauzah, the Central One, as it is nearly midway between the Pointers and Polaris; or, and still ' better, from the Persian Ghiiuzar,- Al Biruni's J auzahar of Sasiinian origin.the Poison Place, referring to the notion that the nodes, or points where the moon crosses the ecliptic, were poisonous because they " happened to , be called the Head and Tail of the Dragon."

Al llipl, from Ulug Beg's catalogue, turned into Arrakis and Errakil, generally has been thought to signify the Dancer, perhaps to the neighboring Lute-player, the star (J; but here probably the Trotting Camel, one of the group of those animals located in this spot. ldeler added for it Al
Ii.fad, the Camel Pasturing Freely, that the original, differently pointed, may mean. The little star in the centre of the group of Camels, B, 'Y, I', v, and {, is named .Al Buba' on the Borgian globe, although almost invisible; but did not appear in the catalogues till Piazzi's time, except with Julius Schiller in his Coe/um Stella/um Christianum of 1627, where it is the 37th star in his constellation of the Holy Innocents. As.semani mentioned I' as Al Ca'ab, the Little Shield or Salver, but gave no reason for this, and its inappropriateness renders the claim very doubtful. In modern drawings it marks the nose or tongue of Draco. The components are 2".5 apart, with a position angle of 165°; and their period is long, although not yet accurately determined. 1•, on the Dragon's head, already mentioned in connection with (3, 'Y, μ, and f, is an interesting double for a small telescope.

shoulders" of our motto are lacking here, and the reference may be to Pegasus, to which the characterization certainly is more appropriate. The Germans call it Fiillen, the Filly, and Kleine Pferd, which with us is the Little Kone, the French Petit Cheval, and the Italian Oavallino. Hood wrote of it about 1590:
This constellation was named of almost no writer, saving Ptolomee and Alfonsus who followith Ptolomee, and therefore no certain tail or historie is delivered thereof, by what means it came into heaven;
but we know that Geminos mentioned it as having been formed by Hipparchos, its stars till then lying in the early Dolphin. Still Hipparchos did not allude to it in his Commmlary, nor did Hyginus, Manilius, or Vitruvius, a century after him. Ptolemy catalogued it as •1mrov ITpoTOμ~, this last word equivalent to our Bust for the upper part of an animal figure; but with later astronomers it
!\·as Equu prim111 and prior, as preceding Pegasus in rising; while from its inferior size come our own title and Equulu1, Equioul111, and Equ111 Kinor. Gore's translation of l'Aslronomie .Populaire, following Proctor, has Equua, the larger Horse being Peg&1111, Ptolemy's idea of the incompleteness of the figure was repeated in the Bqui Seatio, Equi Praeleotio, Seotio equina, Bectio Equi minoria, Bemi-perfectua, and Praeeegmen of various authors and Latin versions of the Syn/axis and of the Alfonsine Tables; the Almagest of 1551 gave Praeoiaio Equi.
Chrysococca's Tables had KecpaA~ wlmrov, the Equi Caput of some Latin writers, and the Hone'• Head of our day. The Arabians followed Ptolemy in calling it Al Xi~'ah al Faru, Part of a Horse, Chilmead's Xataat Alfara1; Al Faru al Thini, the Second Horse, alluding either to its inferior size, or to the time of its adoption as a constellation; and Al l!'aru al .Awwal, the First Horse, in reference to its rising before Pegasus. From the first of these comes the modern Xitalpha, sometimes applied to the constellation, and generally to the brightest star. Riccioli's Blmao Aloheru certainly is a barbarism,- not unusual, however, with him; but La Lande's rarely used Hinnul111, a Young Mule, has more to commend it. With the Hindus it was another of their .A!vini, the Horsemen, altho~h their figuring resembled ours. Some of the mythologists said that the constellation represented Celeri1, the brother of Pegasus, given by Mercury to Castor; or CyllarUI, given to Pollux by Juno; or the creature struck by Neptune's trident from the earth when contesting with Minerva for superiority; but it also was connected 14•

Excepting Achernar, however, it has no star larger than a 3d-magnitude, although it is the longest constellation in the sky, and Gould catalogues in it 293 naked-eye components.

of modem, Italy,-famous in all classical times as the largest of that country's rivers, Vergil's .Rex jluviorum; with the Ebro of Spain; with the Granicus of Alexander the Great; with the Rhenus and the Rhodanus,our Rhine and Rhone; and with the modem Radaune, flowing into the Vistula at Danzig. Some of these originals of our River, especially the Padus, were seats of the early amber trade, thus recalling the story of the Heliades, whose tears, shed at the death of their brother Phaethon, turned into amber as they fell into "that stream of tears" on which that unfortunate was hurled by Jove after his disastrous attempt to drive the chariot of the sun. This was a favorite theme with poets, from O_vid,,in the Metamorphoses, to Dean Milman, in Samor, and the foundation of the story that the river was transferred to the sky to console Apollo for the loss of his son. But none of these comparati vely northern streams suit the stellar position of our Eridanus, for it is a southern constellation, and it would seem that its earthly counterpart ought to be found in a corresponding quarter. In harmony with this, we know that Eratosthenes and the scholiasts on Germanicus and Hyginus said that it represented the Nile, the only noteworthy river that flows from the south to the north, as this is said to do when rising above the horizon. Thus it was llilu1 in the Alfonsine Tables, the edition of 152 1 saying, Ste11atio jl11vii id est Eridanus sive Gyon sfre Ni/us; Gyon 1 coming from the statement in Genesis ii, 13 :
the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush;
this latter being misunderstood for the Nile country instead of the Asiatic Kush that was unquestionably intended by the sacred writer. La Lande cited llulda, equivalent to another title for the stellar Eridanus,- MO.ar, Black,- and so again connected with Egypt, whose native name, Khem, has this same meaning, well describing the color of the fertile deposit that the Nile waters leave on the land. This became the Latin llelo, an early name for the Nile, as it also was for the constellation. This allusion to the Nile recalls the ancient wide-spread belief that it and the Euphrates were but different portions of the same stream ; and Brown, in his monograph The Eridanus, argues that we should identify the Euphrates with the sky figure. He finds his reasons in the fact that both are frequently alluded to, from very early days to the classical age, as The River,

the Euphrates originally being Pura or Purat, the Water, as the Nile was, and even now is, Ioma or Iauma, the Sea; that they resemble each other as long and winding· streams with two great branches; that each is connected with a Paradise - Eden and Heaven; that the adjoining constellations seem to be Euphratean in origin; and that each is in some way associated with the Nile, and each with the overthrow of the sun-god. There is much in the Euphratean records alluding to a stellar stream that may be our Eridanus,-possibly the Milky Way, another sky river; yet it is to the former that the passage translated by Fox Talbot possibly refers :
Like the stars or heaven he shall shine; like the River or Night he shall flow;
and its title has been derived from the Akkadian Aria-dan, the Strong River. George Smith thinks that the heavenly Eridanus may have been the Euphratean Brib-me-gali. Its hither termination at the star Rigel gave it the title River of Orion, used by Hipparchos, Proclus, and others; and Landseer wrote:
1he ~tars now constellated as Erydanus were originally known in different countries by the names of llile, llennui, and 0 - , or 1'ept11D8.
Riccioli cited for it Vardi, and a Moorish title, according to Bayer, was Guad,-the 1720 edition of the Ura11omelna has Guagi,-all these from the Arabic wadi, and reminding us of the Wadi al Kabir, the Great River, the Spaniards' Guadalquivir; but the common designation among the Arabians was Al llahr, the River, transcribed liar and llahar,- Chilmead's Alvahar; this Semitic word, occasionally written Nahal, also having been adduced as a derivation of the word Nile. Assemani quoted Al Kaft' Algeria from the Borgian globe for stars in the bend of the stream; but Ideler claimed these for Al Kaff al Jidhmah of Cetus. Caesius thought our Eridanus the sky representative of the Jordan, or of the Bed Sea, which the Israelites passed over as on dry land. Old illuminated manuscripts added a venerable river-god lying on the surface of the stream, with urn, aquatic plants, and rows of stars; for all of which the Hyginus of 1488 substitutes the figure of a nude woman, with stars lining the lower bank. Bayer's illustration is quite artistic, with reeds and sedge on the margins. The monster Cetus often is depicted with his fore paws, or flippers, in the ~iver.

title was first given to the star now lettered 0, the farthest in the Stream known by Arabian astronomers. For a Bayer had Acharnar pru Achar· nahar vd Aoharnarim, and Enar; Caesius, Aoarnar; Riccioli, Acamalwim and Aobarnaar; Scaliger, Aoharnarin; Schickard, Achironnahri; while Aohenar and Aroharn&r are still occasionally used.
This star is supposed to be one of Dante's Tre l!'aoelle, notwithstanding its invisibility from Italy. Chinese astronomers knew it as Shwuy Wei. Ptolemy did not mention it, although he could have seen it from the latitude of Alexandria, 31° 11',-a fact, among others, which argues that his catalogue was not based upon original observations, but drawn from the
now lost catalogue of Hipparchos, compiled at Rhodes, more than f further north, from which place Achernar was not visible. It culmin~tes on the 4th of December, due south of Baten Kaitos.

Cuna, 3° to the northwest of Rigel in Orion, is the principal star in this constellation, seen from the latitude of New York City. The word is from Al Kunin al Jauzah, the Chair, or Footstool, of the Central One, i. e. Orion, formed by {3, )., and 1/J Eridani with -:- Orionis. and regarded as the support of his left foot; but in the earlier astronomy of the nomads it was one of Al Udl}i al 1'a'im, the Ostrich's Nest, that some extended to ol and 02.

Zaurao and Zaurak are from the Arabic Al lli'ir al Za~ the Bright Star of the Boat; but Ideler applied this early designation to the star that now is a of our Phoenix. With 6, e, 1/, and others near, it made up the Chinese Tien Yuen, the Heavenly Park.

Achernar was the early name for this at the then recognized end of the stream, Halley saying of it, ultima jluminis in veteri catalogo, referring to Tycho's work, of which his own was a supplement. Various forms of its title are given under a, but Acamar, from the Alfonsine Tables, is peculiar to 0. Ulug Beg called it Al '!'haJim, the Ostrich, but Hyde rendered this the Dam, as if blocking the flow of the stream to the south. Bullialdus, in his edition of Chrysococca's work, had it 'Aiii..af, the Furrow, equivalent to the sulcus used by Vergil to denote the track of a vessel, appropriate enough to a star situated in the Stream of Ocean; and Riccioli distinctly gave SulOlll for it in his Astronomia .Reformata. It is the solitary star visible from the latitude of New York City in early \\inter evenings, low down in the south, on the meridian with Menkar of the Whale; but Baily said that its brilliancy has probably lessened since Ptolemy's time, for the latter designated it by a-i. e. of the 1st magnitude. Between it and Fomalhaut lie many small stars, not mentioned by Ptolemy, that Hyde said were Al Zibil; but ,Al Sufi had already called them Al B.i'il, the Little Ostriches. ,, ,, q,, and X, of about the 4th magnitude, were another Tien Yuen of the Chinese, different from that marked by y; , an<l " are the lowest in the constellation visible from the latitude of New York. μ and w, 4th-magnitude stars lying westward of (3, were Kew Yew in China; Reeves including under this title b and the stars of the Sceptre.

In early Arabia this was Al Bai4, the Egg, from its peculiarly white color, as well as from its position near the Ostrich's Nest.

Its duplicity was discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1783, and in 1851 Otto Str"uve found the smaller star itself double and a binary of shon period. The system is remarkable from its great proper motion of 411.1 annually. The two larger stars are 83'' apart, at a position angle of 108°, and the smaller 4" apart, at an angle of 111°. The parallax by Elkin indicates a distance of twenty light years.

A.ngetenar of the Atfonsine Tables, now the common title, the ArgenteDlr of Riccioli and A.nchenetenar of Scaliger, is from Al ]Jiniyat al llahr, the Bend in the River, near which it lies ; Ideler transcribing this as Al Anchat al ll'ahr. This is one of Bayer's nine stars of the same letter lying just above Fornax; he said of them, sibi mutuo succedenks novem. See found, in 1897, a 14.9-magnitude bluish star, about 52" away, at a position angle of 128°.3.

from an Arabic term for two medicinal roots; but Ideler's suggestion that it is from the Hebrew Bamma'yim, In the Water, would seem more reason· able, although we have but few star-names from Judaea, and he intimated that it might be a distorted form of Al Thalim, the Ostrich. The A/IIUlg(sl of 1515 has Beemun; and the Standard Dictionary, The.e'.nim.

a word which Latin lexicographers now write Faelil, was formed by u Lande from stars between Antlia and Hydra, and first published in his Bib/iographie Astronomique of 1805. Its inventor said ofit:

In Die Geslirne, the 2d edition of Bode's maps, it appears as Xatze, with twenty stars; but, except with Secchi, 'Yho included it as Gatto in his planisphere of 1878, it has long been discontinued in the catalogues and charts.

was formed by La Caille from stars within the southern bend of the River; but modem astronomers, by whom it is still recognized, have abbreviated the title to Fornu. · The Chinese know it as Tien Yu, Heaven's Temporary Granary. Bode changed the early name in 1782 to .&.pparatu chemiOlll, and translated it as the Chemilche .&.pparat, Ohymiache Ofen, and l'.&.pparat Ohimique, an alteration in honor of the celebrated chemist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier. These titles, however, have fallen into disuse. Gould assigns to it 110 stars, from 3.6 to 7th magnitudes. a, the lucida, is a double of 4th and 7th magnitudes, 3" apart, with a position angle of 320°, and may be binary. It comes to the meridian on the 19th of December.

In 1787-Bode formed, and in 1790 published in the Jahr!JUch, this minor constellation as l'riedrich'1 Ehre,-Frederick's Glory, Burritt's Gloria Frederica, and Miss Clerke's Gloria Frederioi,-in honor of the great Frederick II of Prussia, who had died in 1786. It was made up from thirty-four stars in the space between Cepheus, Andromeda, Cassiopeia, and the Swan, where Royer, in 1679, had attempted to replace the earlier Lacerta of Hevelius by his Sceptre and Hand of Justice. But he borrowed for his new creation from the northern hand of Andromeda, which he moved to a more easterly position, entirely indifferent

to the fact that it had been " stretched out there for 3000 years." Bode's figure was thus described :
Below a Nimbus, the sign of royal dignity, hang, wreathed with the imperishable Laurel of fame, a Sword, Pen and an Olive ijranch, to distinguish this ever to be remembered monarch, as hero, sage and peacemaker.
It is now seldom mentioned, and has been discarded from the charts, while Lacerta maintains its position in this much occupied spot.

Then both were cleans'd from blood and dust To make a heavenly sign ; The lads were, like their armour, scour'd, And then hung up lo shine ; Such were the heavenly double-Dicks, The sons of Jove and Tyndar.
John Grubb, in Percy's R,ll,pu, efAlld,11I E•r/isl, P«t,y.
The conception of a sky couple for these stars has been universal from remote antiquity, but our Latin title dates only from classical times, varied by Gemelli, which still is the Italian name. The Anglo-Saxons knew them as ge Twiaan, and the Anglo-Normans as Frere; the modem French as 06meau, and the Germans as Zwillinge, Bayer's Zwilling.
While on earth these Twins were sons of Leda, becoming, after their transfer to the sky, Geminum A.strum, Ledaei Fratrea, Ledaei luven-. and Ledaeum Sid111; Dante calling their location llido di Leda, the Nest oi
Leda. Cowley, the contemporary of Milton, wrote of them as the Ledaeu Stan, and Owen Meredith of our day as
The lone Ledaean lightl from yon enchanted air.
They also were Gemini Laoonea,- Milton's Spartan Twins and William Morris' Twin Laconian Stan ; Spartana Subolee from their mother's home, and Cyono generati from her story ; Pueri Tyndarii, Tynclaridea, Tyndaridae, and Horace's olanun Tynclaridae Sid111, from Tyndarus, their supposed father; while the Oebalii and Oebalidae of Ovid, Statius, and Valerius Flaccus are from their grandfather, Oebalus, king of Sparta. Mamlius called them Phoebi Sid111 as being under Apollo's protection.



The Constellations 223
Individually they were Castor and Pollux,- Dante's and the Italians' Cutore e Polluoe; Apollo and Hercule,, Triptolemu and Iuion, Theeeu and Pirithoiia. Horace wrote Castor fraterque magni Outoria; Pliny, Cutore1; and Statius had alter Castor from their alternate life and death that the modern James Thomson repeated in the Summer of his Seasons.
Th' alternate Twins are fix'd.
But Welcke gave an astronomical turn to these titles by seeing in the first Aator, the Starry One, and in Pollux Polyleukea, the Lightful. With the Greeks they were Mdvμot, the Twins,- Riccioli's Didymi,originally representing two of the Pelasgian Kd/3etpot, but subsequently the Boeotian ~t6a,wpot,-DiOIC1lri in Rome,-the Sons of Zeus; as also Am· phion and Zethu, Antiope's sons, who, as Homer wrote, were
Founders of Thebes, and men of mighty name,
strikingly shown on the walls of the Spada Palace in Rome, and with the Farnese Bull now in the Naples Museum. Plutarch called them •Ava,m;,
Lords,-Cicero's Anace•, and ~tw, the Two Gods of Sparta; Theodoretus, 'Ecpfonot, the Familiar Gods; others, Dii Bamothraoea, from the ancient seat of worship of the Cabeiri; and Dii Germani, the Brother Gods. In India they always were prominent as AQVini, the A.lhwin1, or Horsemen, a name also found in other parts of the sky for other Hindu twin deities; but, popularly, they were lfithuna, the Boy and Girl, the Tamil l6dhunam, afterwards changed to lituma, or Tituma, from the Greek title. A Buddhist zodiac had in their place a Woman holding a golden cord. Some of the Jews ascribed them to the tribe of Benjamin, although others more fitly claimed them for Simeon and Levi jointly, the Brethren. They called them Teomim; the Tyrians, Tome; and the Arabian astronomers, Al Tau'amin, the Twins; but in early Desert astronomy their two bright stars formed one of the fore paws of the great ancient Lion; although they also were Al Burj al lauzi', the Constellation of the Twins. From this came Bayer's A.lgeuze, which, however, he said was unrechl, thus making Riccioli's Elgeuzi and Gieuz equally wrong. Hyde adopted another form of the word,- J auzah, the Centre,- as designating these stars' position in medio coeli, or in a region long viewed as the centre of the heavens; either because they were a zenith constellation, or from the brilliancy of this portion of the sky. Julius Pollux, the Egypto-Greek writer of our second century, derived the title from Jauz, a Walnut, as mentioned in his Onomaslicon. But there is much uncertainty as to the



224 Star-Names and their Meanings
stellar signification and history of this name, as will be further noticed under Orion. The 1515 A/mares/ has the inexplicable Ali~ said to be from some early edition of the Aljonsine Tables. The Persians called the Twins Du Paikar, or Do Patkar', the Two Figures; the Khorasmians, Adhupakarik, of similar meaning; and Riccioli wrote that they were the "Chaldaean" Tammech. Kircher said that they were the K.lvo~, or Claus/rum Hori, of the Egyptians; and others, that they represented the two intimately associated gods, Hol'lll the Elder, and Hol'lll the Yomiger, or llarpechruti,- the Harpocrates of Greece. The Twins were placed in the sky by Jove, in reward for their brotherly love so strongly manifested while on earth, as in the verses of Manilius:
Tender Gemini in strict embrace Stand clos'd and smiling in each other's Face;
and were figured as Two Boys, or Young Men, drawn exactly alike:
So like they were, no mortal Might one from other know;
or as Two Infants, Duo Corp1llC1lla. But Paulus Venetus and other illustrators of Hyginus showed Two Angela, and the Venetian edition of Albumasar .of 1489 has two nude seated figures, a Boy and a Girl, with arms outstretched upon each other's shoulders. The Leyden Manuscript shows two unclad boys with Phrygian caps, each surmounted by a star and Maltese cross; one with club and spear, the other with a stringed instrument. Bayer had something similar, Pollux, however, bearing a peaceful sickle.
Caesius saw here the Twin Bona of Rebecca, or David and lonathu; while other Christians said that the stars together represented Saint; lamu the Greater; or, to go back to the beginning of things, Adam and Eve, who probably were intended by the nude male and female figures walking hand in hand in the original illustration in the Aljonsine Tables. A similar showing appears, however, on the Denderah planisphere of 1300 years previous. The Arabians drew them as Peacoob, from which came a mediaeval title, Duo Pavones; some of the Chaldaeans and Phoenicians, as a Pair of Kida following Auriga and the Goat, or as Two Gazelles; the Egyptians, as Two Sprouting Pla.nta; and Brown reproduces a Euphratean representation of a couple of



The Constellations 225
small, naked, male child-figures, one standing upon its bead and the other standing upon the former, feet to feet; the original Twins being the sun and moon, when the one is up the other is generally down;
a variant representation showing the positions reversed and the figures clothed. Another symbol was a Pile of Briob, referring to the building of the first city and the fratricidal brothers - the Romulus and Remus of Roman legend; although thus with a very different character from that generally assigned to our Heavenly Twins. Similarly Sayce says that the Sumerian name for the month May-June, when the sun was in Gemini, signified " Bricks" (?). In classical days the constellation was often symbolized by two stars over a ship; and having been appointed by Jove as guardians of Rome, they naturally appeared on all the early silver coinage of the republic from about 269 B. c., generally figured as two young men on horseback, with oval caps, surmounted by stars, showing the halves of the egg-shell from which they issued at birth. On the denarii, the "pence" of the good Samaritan, they are in full sp~ed as if charging in the battle of Lake Regillus, and the sesterlii and quinarii have the same; but even before this, about 300 B. c., coins were struck by the Bruttii of Magna Graecia, in Lower Italy, that bore the heads of the Twins on one side with their mounted figures on the other. The coins of Rhegium had similar designs, as had those of Bactria. For their efficient aid in protecting their fellow Argonauts in the storm that had nearly overwhelmed the Argo, the Gemini were considered by the Greeks, and even more by the Romans, as propitious to mariners, Ovid writing in the Fasti: Utile sollicitare sidus utrumque rati,
which moral John Gower, the friend of Chaucer, rendered:
A welcome couple to a vexed barge;
and Horace, in his Odes, as translated by Mr. Gladstone:
So Leda's twins, bright-shining, at their beck Oft have delivered stricken barks from wreck.
In The Acts of the Apostles, xxviii, 11, we read that the Twin Brothers were the "sign," or figurehead, of the ship in which Saint Paul and his companions embarked after the eventful voyage that had ended in shipwreck on Malta; or, as Tindale rendered it in 1526:
a ship of Alexandry, which had wyntred in the Vie, whose badge was Castor and Pollux,15



226 Star-Names and their Meanings
the Greek Alexandria, and Ostia, the harbor of Rome, specially being under the tutelage of the Twins, who were often represented on either side of the bows of vessels owned in those ports. The incident of the storm in the history of the Twins seems to have as.wciated them with the electrical phenomenon common in heavy weather at sea, and well known in ancient times, as it is now. Pliny described it at length in the Hisloria Natura/is, and allusions to it are frequent in all literature; the idea being that a double light, called Castor and Pollux, was favorable to the mariner. Horace designated this as Fralrts Hdmat, /ucitla sit/era, rendered by Mr. Gladstone" Helen's Brethren, Starry Lights"; Rabelais wrote: He had seen Castor at the main yard arm;
and our Bryant: resplendent cressets which the Twins Uplifted in their ever-youthful hands.
A single light was " that dreadfull, cursed, and threatening meteor called Helena," -the sister of the Twins that brought such ill luck to Troy. In modem times these lights are known as Composant, Corposant, and Corpusant, from the Italian Corpo Santo; Pigafetta ending one of his descriptions of a dangerous storm at sea with " God and the Corpi Santi came to our aid"; and as the Fire of Saint Helen, Saint Helmes, or 'felmes - San Telmo of Spain; or of San Anselmo, Ermo, Hermo, and Eremo, from Anselmus, or Erasmus, bishop of Naples, martyred in Diocletian's reign. Ariosto wrote of it, la disiala luce di Sa11to Enno~· and in Longfellow's Golden Legend the Padrone exclaims:
Last night I saw Saint Elmo's stars, With their glittering lanterns all at play On the tops of the masts and the tips of the spars, And I knew we should have foul weather to-day.
The phenomenon also has been called Saint Anne's Light; and some one has dubbed it Saint Electricity. In recent centuries, with seamen of the Latin races, it has been Saint Peter and Saint Nicholas; the former from his walking on the water, and the latter from the miracles attributed to him of stilling the storm on his voyage to the Holy Land when he restored to life the drowned sailor, and again on the Aegean Sea. These miracles have made Nicholas the patron saint of all Christian maritime nations of the south of Europe, and famous everywhere. In England alone 376 churches are dedicated to him,-more than to that country's Saint George.

In Eden's translation from Pigafetta's account of his voyage with Magellan, 1519-1522, we read that when off the coast of Patagonia the navigators
were in great daungiour by tempest. But as soon as the three fyers canted saynte Helen, saynte Nycolas, and saynt Clare, appered uppon the cabels of the shyppes, suddeynely the tempest and furye of the wyndes ceased ••. the which was of such comfort to us that we wept for joy.
This Saint Clare is from Clara d'Assisi, the foundress of the order of Poor Clares in the 13th century, by whose rebuke the infidel Saracens were put to flight when ravaging the shores of the Adriatic. Von Humboldt mentioned in Cosmos another title, San Pedro Gonzalez, probably Saint Peter of Alcantara, another patron saint of sailors, " walking on the water through trust in God." A few words as to Pigafetta may be not uninteresting. His work is described in Eden's Decades as
A briefe declaration of the vyage or navigation made abowte the worlde. Gathered owl of a large booke wrytten hereof by Master Antonie P:icgafetta Vincentine [i. e. from Vincenza], Knyght of the Rhodes and one of the coompanye of that vyage in the which, Ferdinando Magalianes a Portngale (whom sum caule Magellanus) was geuerall Capitayne of the navie.
Pigafetta was knighted after his return to Seville in the ship Victoria that Transilvanus wrote was " more woorthye to bee placed amonge the starres then that owlde Argo." And it was from Eden's translation of this" large booke" that Shakespeare is supposed to have taken his Caliban of the Tempest, whose " dam's god, Setebos," was worshiped by the Patagonians. Indeed Caliban himself seems to have been somewhat of an astronomer, for he alludes to Prospero a.c; having taught him how
To name the bigger light, and how the less, That burn by day and nig~t.
The Gemini were invoked by the Greeks and Romans in war as well as in storm. Lord Macaulay's well-known lines on the battle of Lake Regillus, 4~ B. c., one of his Lays of Ancient Rome, have stirred many a schoolboy's heart, as Homer's Hymn to Castor and Pollux did those of the seamen of earliest classical days. Shelley has translated this last:
Ye wild-eyed muses! sing the Twins of Jove,
mild Pollux, void of blame, And steed-subduing Castor, heirs of fame. These are the Powers who earth-born mortals save



228 Star-Names and their Meanings
And ships, whose flight is swift along the wave. When wintry tempests o'er the savage sea Are raging, and the sailors tremblingly Call on the Twins of Jove with prayer and vow, Gathered in fear upon the lofty prow, And sacrifice with snow-white lambs, the wind And the huge billow bursting close behind, Even then beneath the weltering waters bear The staggering ship-they suddenly appear, On yellow wings rushing athwart the sky, And lull the blasts in mute tranquillity, And strew the waves on the white ocean's bed, Fair omen of the voyage; from toil and dread, The sailors rest rejoicing in the sight, And plough the quiet sea in safe delight.
They seem to have been a common object of adjuration among the Romans, and, indeed, as such have descended to the present time in the boys' "By Jiminy !"while the caricature of 1665, Homer A la Mode, had, as a common expression of that day," 0 Gemony ! " And theatre-goers will recall the "0 Gemini! " of Lucy in Sheridan's .Rivals. Astrologers assigned to this constellation guardianship over human hands, arms, and shoulders; while Albumasar held that it portended intense devotion, genius, largeness of mind, goodness, and liberality. With Virgo it was considered the Houe of J(eroury, and thus the Cyleniu tour of Chaucer; and a fortunate sign, ruling over America, Flanders, Lombardy, Sardinia, Armenia, Lower Egypt, Brabant, and Marseilles ; and, in ancient days, over the Euxine Sea and the river Ganges. High regard, too, was paid to it in the 17th century as being peculiarly connected with the fortunes of the south of England and the city of London; for the Great Plague and Fire of 1665 and 1666 occurred when this sign was in the ascendant, while the building of London Bridge and other events of importance to the city were begun when special planets were here. But two centuries previousiy it was thought that whoever happened to be born under the Twins would be "ryght pore and wayke and lyf in mykul tribulacion." Chinese astrologers asserted that if this constellation were invaded by Mars, war and apoor harvest would ensue. Ampelius assigned to it the care of Aquilo, the North Wind, the Greek Boreas that came from the north one third east. Its colors were white and red like those of Aries, and it was the natal sign of Dante, who was born on the 14th of May, 1265, when the sun entered it for the first time in that year. He made grateful acknowledg• ment of this in the .Paradiso:

and called them gli Eterni Gemelli. How like this is to Hesiod's reference to the Muses ! To them I owe, to them alone I owe, What of the seas, or of the stars, I know.
The sign's symbol, J!, has generally been considered the Etrusco-Roman numeral, but Seyffert thinks it a copy of the Spartans' emblem of their Twin Gods carried with them into battle. Brown derives it from the cuneiform
YT, the ideograph of the Akkad month Kas, the Twins, the Assyrian Simanu, corresponding to parts of our May and June when the sun passed through it. The constellation was certainly prominent on the Euphrates, for five of its stars marked as many of the ecliptic division~ of that astronomy. The Gemini were the Ape of the early Chinese solar zodiac, and were known as Shih Chin; Edkins, calling it Shi Ch'en, says that this title was transferred to it from Orion. Later on the constellation was known as Yin Yang, the Two Principles; and as lidim, an important object of worship. The Reverend Mr. William Ellis wrote, in his Polynesian Researches, that the natives of those islands knew the two stars as Twins, Castor being Pipiri and Pollux B.ehua; and the whole figure lia Aina.nu, the Two Ainanus, one Above, the other Below, with a lengthy legend attached; but the Reverend Mr. W.W. Gill tells the same story, in his Myths and Songs of the South Pacific, as belonging to stars in Scorpio. The Australian aborigines gave them a name signifying Young Men, while the Pleiades were Young Girls; the former also being Turree and WanJil, pursuing Purra, whom they annually kill at the beginning of the intense heat, roasting him by the fire the smoke of which is marked by Coonar Turung, the Great Mirage. The Bushmen of South Africa know them as Young Women, the wives of the eland, their great antelope. Aristotle has left an interesting record of the occultation, at two different times, of some one of the stars of Gemini by the planet Jupiter, the earliest observation of this nature of which we have knowledge, and made probably about the middle of the 4th century B. c. The southern half of the constellation lies within the Milky Way, a and /3, on the north, marking the heads of the Twins between Cancer and Auriga, and noticeably conspicuous over setting Orion in the April sky. Argelander enumerates 53 naked-eye stars, and Reis 106. 15•

Castor, Ovid's Bquea, the Horseman of the Twins, and the mortal one as being the son of Tyndarus, is the well-known name for this star, current for centuries; but in later Greek days it ~as 'Arr6.t~.wv, and Apollo with the astronomers even through Flamsteed's time. It will be remembered that till toward the Christian era this name for the god of day was the title of the planet Mercury when morning star,1 its rapid orbital movement and nearness to the sun preventing its earlier iden• tification with the evening star,1 which was designated, as now, after the god of thieves and darkness. In Percy's Bdiques Mercury is described as "the nimble post of heaven" ;-Goad, in 1686, called it
a squirting lacquey of the sun, who seldom shows his face in these parts, as if be were in debt;
while this same quick motion induced the alternative word of the chemists for quicksilver, as well as for the very uncomfortable human temperament that Byron described :
a mercurial man Who fluttered over all things like a fan.
Notwithstanding, however, the supposed difficulty of seeing Mercury,Copemicus died regretting that he had never observed it, although this was doubtless partly due to his high latitude and the mists arising from the Vistula at Thorn,-the canon Gallet, whom La Lande styled Hermophile, saw it 100 times, and Baily said that Hevelius observed it 1100 times I Indeed, it is easily visible in the latitude of New York City for several days, at its elongation, if one knows where to look for it.

Its car• liest observation, reported by Ptolemy as from Chaldaea, was on the 15th of November, :i65 B. c., the planet then being between [1 and .J Scorpii. 2 This Apian was Pieter Bienewitz, whose surname was Latinized, after the fashion of bis day, into Apianus; apis, our word /Ju, taking the place of the German /Jinu.

Caesius had the synonymous Phoebu, and also cited Th8181l11 but this should rather be applied to /3 as another title of the original Hercules. Bayer gave Bualgeuze; and Riccioli, Algueze vd potius Blgiautzi, but these also better belong to /3. The Babylonians used Castor to mark their 11th ecliptic constellation, Kuh•maahu·Iahru, the Westem One of the Twins; while with Pollux the two constituted llas-tab-ba-gal-gal, the Great Twins. In Assyria they were Ku-mas and Tuimu, the Twins, although that country knew other twin stars here as well ·as elsewhere in the sky. As an object of veneration Castor was Tur-us•mal•max, the Son of the Supreme Temple ; but in astrology, everywhere, it has been a portent of mischief and violence. When the Arabians adopted the Greek figures they designated this star
as Al Ria al Taum al •~4cμm, the Head of the Foremost Twin; but,
according to Al Tizini, the early and indigenous term was Al Awwal al Dhiri', the First in the Paw or Forearm. Reference was made by this to the supposed figure of the enormous early Lion, the nomads' Asad, the Outstretched Forearm of which a and {3 marked as Al Dhiri' al J(ab111~t. This extended still further over Gemini, the other, the Contracted one, Al ~biicJ.ah, running into Canis Minor. The rest of this monstrosity included Cancer, part of our Leo, Bootes, Virgo, and Corvus, as was mentioned by Kazwini, and commented on by Ideler, who sharply criticized mistakes in its construction. Al Biriini also described this ancient figure, especially complaining of the many errors and much confusion in the Arab mind as to the nomenclature of the two stars, although he himself used titles for them generally applied only to Sirius and Procyon. Ideler and Beige} attributed this exaggerated and incongruous formation to blunders of misunderstanding and transcription by early writers and copyists. Indeed, the former asserted that the whole was the creation of grammarians who knew nothing of the heavens, and arbitrarily misrepresented older star-names. The two bright stars were the 5th manzil, Al Dhiri', and the 5th nakshatra,Punarvanii, the Two Good Again; Aditi, the sky goddess, mother of the Adityas, being the presiding divinity, and /3 marking the junction with Pushya, the next naksltalra. They also constituted the 5th sieu, Taing, a Wall, or Pit, anciently Tiam, although this was extended to include e, tl, {, A., ~. y, v, and μ, Biot making the last the determinant star. a and /3 also were a distinct Chinese asterism, Ho Choo, and with 'Y and
rJ were Pih Ho. As marking lunar stations, Brown thinks them the Akkadian Supa, Lustrous; the Coptic Pimaft, the Forearm; the Persian Tarah&, the Sogdian Ghamb, and the Khorasmian liray,- these last three titles signifying the

Two Stars. Hyde wrote that the Copts knew it.as rr,,ui.t, or Iltμdtniu:w•·. the Forearm of the Nile; KEwv being for Gihon, a name for that river. Castor is 7° north of the ecliptic, but, although literally heading the constellation, is now fainter than its companion, and astronomers generally are agreed that there has been inversion of their brilliancy during the last three centuries. It culminates on the 23d of February. It is among those double stars Whereof the one more bright Is circled by the other,
viewed by the Self-indulgent Soul of Tennyson's Palace of Ari; and Sir John Herschel called it the largest and finest of all the double stars in our hemisphere ; while the rapid revolution of its two components first convinced his father of the existence of binary systems. But Bradley had already noticed a change of about 30° in their angle of position between 1718 and 1759, and" was thus within a hair's breadth of the discovery of their physical connection," afterwards predicted, in 1767, by the Reverend John Michell, and positively made in 1802 by Sir William He1schel, who coined the word" binary" now applied to this class ofstars. Burnham wrote in 1896 that we have only 36 pairs whose orbits can be said to be well determined, and about 230 other pairs probably binary systems; and there are 1501 other pairs, within 211 of space between the components, from which the foregoing number may be increased; as well as other pairs now known only as having a common proper motion.1 Of course the stars observed till now have been almost entirely in the northern heavens,-within 1200 of the pole,-so that these numbers may be largely added to as astronomers tum their attention to the southern skies with this object in view. The orbit of Castor is such, however, that the observations of even a century do not enable us to calculate its size or period with any certainty: but the period certainly is long,-probably between 250 and 1000 years. The components at present are about 511.7 apart, equal to the angle suhtended by a line an inch long at the distance of half a mile. Their position angle is about 227°. The spectrum is of the Sirian type, and, according to the Potsdam observers, the star is approaching us at the rate of 18.5 ~iles a second_ In 1895 Belopolsky announced that the larger star, like Spica, is a spectro
1 In a note from Professor Burnham, of the 19th of July, 18c]S, in regard to these figures, ht says: '' The statements I made a couple of years ago about binary systems will hold good generally at this time. . . . So far as well-determined orbits are concerned, I do not think anything could be added to the estimate I made."

scopic binary, completing its revolution in less than three days around the centre of gravity between it and an invisible companion, with a velocity of about 151⁄4 miles a second. Burnham thinks that the 9.5-magnitude star, 73" distant, forms, with the two larger, one vast physical system. In 1888 Barnard found five new nebulae within 1° of Castor.

As companion of'ATTol).wv, this was 'Hpan:lijr and 'Hpadi11r, descending to Flamsteed's day as Hercules, and degenerating, in early catalogues, into Abrachalelll, that Caesius derived from the Arabic Ab, Father, and the Greek word; this being contracted by some to Araoaleua; by Grotius to Iracleua, by Hyde to Heraolua, and by Riccioli to Garaclea. All these are queer enough, as are some of Castor's titles; but what shall be said of Riccioli's BlbaJraac, that he attributes to the Arabs for a and {3 jointly, and Ketpholtauman for (3 alone, and with no clue to their origin ! It was the early Arabs' Al Thini al Dhiri', the Second in the Forearm ; but the later termed it Al Ria al Taum al J(u'&h·h·ir, the Head of the Hindmost Twin, and Al Ria al lauzi', the Head of the Twin,-the Alfonsine B.uaJgenae and Raaalgeuze, that elsewhere is Raaalg&uze. Riccioli cited Elhenaat, but this he also more properly gave to y. (3 was the determinant of the 12th Babylonian ecliptic asterism J[uhmuhu-artii, the Eastern One of the Twins; and individually J(u-eir-kea-da, the Yoke of the Inclosure. It lies 12° north of the ecliptic, the zodiac's boundary line running between it and Castor; and Burnham has found five faint companions down to 13.5 magnitude. Elkin gives its parallax as o".057; and Scheiner, its spectrum as Solar; its rate of recession from us being about one mile a second. It is one of the lunar stars made use of in navigation; and, in astrology, differed from its companion in portending eminence and renown. Ptolemy characterized {3 as imo,uppor, a favorite word with him for this star-tint, and generally supposed to signify "yellowish" or "reddish," Bayer correctly following the former in his suljlava; but the Alfonsine Tables of 1521 translated it quae lrahit ad aerem, el est cerea. Miss Clerke, somewhat strongly, says "fiery red." The two lucidae probably bore the present title of tpe constellation long

As a convenient measuring-rod it may be noted that a and f3 stand 4:/ apart ; and this recalls an early signification of their mam:il title, Al Dhir.l. the Arabs' Ell measure of length that the stars were said to indicate. This naturally became the dual Al Dhiri'in that also was used on the Desert for other similar pairs of stars.

Almeiaan, Almiu.n, Almeilam, and .Almilam are from Al Kailan, the Proudly Marching One, its early Arabic name, which Al Firuzabadi, howmr. said was equally applicable to any bright star. Riccioli called it Blhenaat, but Alhena is now generally given to it, from Al Han'ah, the 4th manzil, y, μ, v, 1/, and f, in the feet of the Twins. This word, usually translated a Brand, or Mark, on the right side of a camel';, or horse's, neck, was defined by Al Biriini as Winding, as though the star, of this station were winding around each other, or curving from the centr.tl star; and they were Al ll'uqitai, the dual form of Al Nul)at, a Camel's Hump, itself a curved line. Some Arabic authority found in them, with.\1

Wasat and Went are from Al Wuat, the Middle, i. e. of the constellation; but some have referred this to the position of the star very near to the ecliptic, the central circle. In China it was Ta Tsun, the Great Wine-jar. The components are 7" apart, with a position angle of 203°, and may form a binary system. Just north of d lies the radiant point of the Geminide, visible early in October; another stream of meteors bearing the same title appearing from the northeastern border of the constellation and at its maximum on the 7th of December.

Propu is from the 1Ip6rrovr of Hipparchos and Ptolemy, indicating its position in front of Castor's left foot, and is its universal title, with the equivalent Praepee. Riccioli wrote it 1Ip6rror, and Flamsteed gave both 1Ip6rrovr and Propu; but Tycho had applied this last to the star Fl. 1 among the extras of Gemini. This position of'f/ similarly made it the Pim Pai of the Persians. Bassus and Hyginus said Trop111, Turn, referring to the apparent turningpoint of the sun's course at the summer solstice, which now is more precisely marked by the star y just eastward from 'f/; and Flamsteed also had Tporror. Flammarion's assertion that Hipparchos knew 'f/ as a distinct constellation, Propu, does not seem well founded. Tejat prior is from Al Tal)iyi, an anatomical term of Arabia by which it was known in early days; a name also applied to stars in the head of Orion. The Arabs included it with y and I' in their ll'ul].itai; the Chinese knew it as Yui, a Battle-ax; and in Babylonia it marked the 8th ecliptic constellation, llaru1ha-pu•u•muh·muhu, the Front of the Mouth of the Twins. It portended lives of eminence to all born under its influence. The variability of 'f/ was discovered by Schmidt in 1865, and its period is now considered as 229-231 days; in 1881 Burnham found it double, the components 111.08 apart, and likely to prove an interesting binary system.

Near this star Sir William Herschel discovered the planet Uranus on the 13th of March, 1781. He thought it a comet,and its discovery as such was communicated to the Royal Astronomical Society on the 26th of April Its true nature, however, first suspected by Maskelyne, was announced in the succeeding year by Lexell of Saint Petersburg and by La Place; and Herschel then published it on the 7th of November, 1782, as the Georgium Sidus, thus following Gali)ieo, who, till he knew their true nature, had named Jupiter's satellites Sidera Cosmiana and Sidera Medicea, after his patron the 2d Cosmo di Medici, and Tarde, who had called the sun-spots Borbonica Sidera. Continental astronomers designated the planet as Herschel, and this in a much varied orthography, strangely erroneous considering the fame of.its discoverer. We find it thus with La Lande in 1792; indeed, Herschel appeared as an alternative title in our text-books as late as fifty years ago; but Bode suggested the present Uranus to conform to the mythological nomenclature of the other planets, and because the name oi the oldest god was specially applicable to the oldest - as the most distantbody then known in our system. Uranus, however, had been observed and noted as a star twenty-two times previously by various observers; these are called" the ancient observations"; and Miss Clerke writes : " There is, indeed, some reason to suppose that he had been detected as a wandering orb by savage ' watchers of the skies' on the Pacific long before he swam into Herschel's ken." 1 The 4th-magnitude 0, and t, v, T, and </>, collectively were Woo Chow Shih, or Woo Choo Bow, the Seven Feudal Princes of China. t is Propu in the Standard Dictionary, although it lies between the shoulders of the Twins.
μ, Double, 3.2 and 11, crocus yellow and blue,
occasionally has been known as Tejat posterior, and sometimes as J'ul!,itai, from the manzil of that title of which it formed a part.
The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia apply to it the Pish Pai seen for T/, yet appropriate enough for this similarly situated star; but in Flamsteal's edition of Tycho's catalogue we distinctly read of it, did,, Cah, the Heel. It marked the 9th ecliptic com,tellation of Babylonia as Arkij-tha•pu-umaah-maahu, the Back of the Mouth of the Twins.
1 The Burmans, too, thought that there was an 8th planet, Rabil, but invisible; and 1he Hindus named other imaginary planets Kethu, Rethu, and Kulican; and figured Sani, their god Saturn, with a circle around him of intertwined serpents ages before Galileo's day; although this has bad a very different explanation.

D. 400, tells us that the crane was the symbol of a star-observer in Egypt, presumably from its high flight as described in our motto. Caesius, who carried his biblical symbols even to the new constellations, imagined this to be the Stork in the Heaven of Jeremiah viii, 7, although the Crane occurs in -the same verse; but Julius Schiller combined it with Phoenix in a representation of Aaron the High Priest. The Arabians included its stars in the Southern Fish, Al Sufi giving its a, 13, d, O, ,, and l as unformed members of that constellation. The components, with the exception of the lucida, form a gentle curve southwest from this Fish, and among them are stars noted in astronomy.

One hundred and seven are catalogued by Gould as being visible to the naked eye. a, marking the body of the bird, is the conspicuous 2d-magnitude southwest from Fomalhaut when the latter culminates in autumn evenings, itself coming to the meridian on the 11th of October. It was Al Tizini's Al lfi.'ir, the Bright One, i. e. of the Fish's tail, when that constellation extended over the stars of our Grus. The Chinese knew it as Xe. /3, a 2.2-magnitude red star, was Al Tizini's Rear One at the end of the tail of his Fish, thirty-five minutes of arc to the eastward from a.

The alternative title for the stars of Grus,

known to the first Greek astronomers under that name,- for Eudoxos had 'Evyativaa,; Hipparchos, 'Evy61•aat, i. e. b iv y6vaat K,a011μevor, Bending on his Knees; and Ptolemy, ev yovaatv. Aratos added to these designations 'Od~wv, the Kneeling One, and •EuJw;lov, the Phantom, while his description in the Phainomma well showed the ideas of that early time as to its character: • . . like a toiling man, revolves A form. Of it can no one clearly speak, Nor to what toil he is attached; but, simply, Kneder they call him. Labouring on his knees, Like one who sinks he seems; • • . • . . And his right foot Is planted on the twisting Sn-pmt's head.
But all tradition even as to
Whoe'er this stranger of the heavenly forms may be,
seems to have been lost to the Greeks, for none of them, save Eratosthenes, attempted to explain its origin, which in early classical days remained involved in mystery. He wrote of it, ovT6r, <f>aalv, 'HpaK,A-1/f foTiv, standing
upon the •oq,,r, our Draco; and some modern students of Euphratean mythology, associating the stars of Hercules and Draco with the sun-god Izhdubar 1 and the dragon Tia.mat, slain by him, think this Chaldaean myth the foundation of that of the classical Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra. Izhdubar is shown on a cylinder seal of 3000 to 3500 B. c., and described in that country's records as resting upon one knee, with his foot upon the Dragon's head, just as Aratos says of his 'Evy6vaa,, and as we have it now. His well-known adventures are supposed to refer to the sun's passage through the twelve zodiacal signs, appearing thus on tablets of the 7th century before Christ. This myth of several thousand years' antiquity may have been adopted by Greece, and the solar hero changed into Hercules with his twelve familiar labors. • This constellation is said to have been an object of worship in Phoenicia's most ancient days as the sky representative of the great sea-god Jlelkartb. Indeed, it has everywhere been considered of importance, judging from its abundant nomenclature and illustration, for no other sky group seems to have borne so many titles. The usual Greek name was transliterated Engonui, Engonaaia, and Engonuin down to the days of Bullialdus, with whom it appeared in the queer

It also was Saltator, the Leaper; Xdpt.11/J, the Keen-eyed One; Kopvv~~'/1' and Kopv1•11cJ>6poc;, the equivalents of Clavator and Claviger, the Club-bearer of the Latins: all applied to the constellation in early days, from classical designations of the hero Hercules, whose own name has now become universal for it. Although we first find this in the Catasterisms, Avienus asserted that it was used by Panyasis, the epic poet of 500 B. c., and uncle of Herodotus, perhaps to introduce into the heavens another Argonaut. The lieans of Vitruvius came from the story of Deianira, the innocent cause of Hercules' death, when, as in the Death of Wallenstein,
Soared he upward to celestial brightness ;
llilua, from the city of Nisa; J[alica, J[elica, J[elioartu, and J[elioerta,from the name of its king, known later as Palaemon,- although some refer these to the title of the great god of Phoenicia, Melkarth, the King of the City; and Aper, from the Wild Boar slain at Elis. It was Cernuator, the Wrestler, from the hero's skill; C~te'lll, Cete111, and Cethe'lll, as son of Lycaon, and so uncle or brother of Kallisto, who, as Ursa Major, adjoined this constellation ; indeed, it was even known as Lyoaon himself, weeping over Kallisto's transformation. Ovid's A.loidea was a common poetical title, either from 'AA11fi, Strength, or from Alcaeus, Hercules' grandfather; while Almann111 and Celtio111 came from the fact that a similar hero was worshiped by the Germans and Celts, themselves noted for strength and daring deeds, and said to have been descended from Hercules. The un· explained Pataeoua and Epipataeoua are from Egypt; J[aceria, from Libya; while De1anat11, Deaanes, and Doaanea, or Donanea, are said to be of Hindu origin.

Other titles are hi.on, laboring at his wheel, perhaps because Hercules also labored; or from the radiated object shown on Euphratean gems, a supposed representation of the solar prototype of Hercules, which in later times may easily have been regarded as a wheel; Prometheu, bending in chains on Caucasus; Thamfria, sad at the loss of hls lyre; Ampbitryoniadea, from the supposed sire of Hercules; Heroa Tirynthiu, from the place where he was reared ; and Oetae111, from the mountain range of Thessaly whence he ascended the funeral pyre. The Sanctu that has appeared as a title is properly 8an0118, the Semo Sancus, of Sabine-Umbrian-Roman mythology, identified with Hercules. Theeeu was a name for this constellation, from the similar adventures of the originals; Jlellu and Ovillu trace back to the Malum and Ovis in the myth of the Apples, or Sheep, of the Hesperides, with which the story of Hercules is connected,- different ideas, but both from μfilov with this double signification ; although La Lande thought that reference was made to the skin of the lion thrown over the hero's shoulder. We also occasionally see Diodaa, Jlaniliu, Orphe111, and Trapesiu, the exact connection of which with our sky figure is not certain. The 4th edition of the Alfonsine Tabks singularly adds Baeaben, from the neighboring Draco's Al Ras al Thu'ban.
Bayer erroneously quoted rvv; i:pmwv, on Bended Knee, as if from Homer; and gave "Etowlov arr£V0or, the Unknown Image, and Imago labonmti limilil. He also cited the Persians' Ternuellea, which Beige) suggested might be from their mistaken orthography of the word Hercules; and Hyde added another term, from that people, in Ber zanii niaheate, Resting on his Knees, a repetition of the earliest idea as to the figure. Flammarion states that he found our modem title first mentioned in an edition ofHyginus of 1485,-but he had not read Eratosthenes; and some say that even this Hercules of Hyginus was really designed for the adjacent Ophiuchus. · The modem Italians' Ercole is like their Roman predecessors' abbreviated name for the deity, who was one of their most frequent objects of adjuration. Our stellar figure generally has been drawn with club and lion-skin, the left foot on Draco and the right near Bootes, the reversal of these by Aratos being criticized by Hipparchos; but the Farnese globe shows a young man, nude and kneeling ; while the Leyden ~fanuscript very inappropriately drew it as a young boy, erect, with a short star-tipped shepherd's crook, be~ring a lion's skin and· head. Bayer shows the strong man kneeling, clothed in the lion's skin, with his "all brazen" club and the Apple Branch, 16

This last he called Ramu pomifer, the German Zweig, placing it in the right hand of Hercules, on the edge of the Milky Way; but this even then was an old idea, for the Venetian illustrator of Hyginus in 1488 showed, in the constellation figure, an Apple Tree with a serpent twisted around its trunk. Argelander followed Bayer's drawing, but Reis transfers the Branch to the left hand, with two vipers as a reminder of the now almost forgotten stellar Cerberus with serpents' tongues, which Bayer did not know. The French and Italians, who give more prominence to these adjuncts of Hercules than do we, have combined them in a sub-constellation :Rameau et Oerbere and Ramo e Cerbero. In all this, as well as in some of the titles of the Hercules constellation and of Draco, reappears the story of the Golden Fruits of the Hesperides with their guardian dragon. It may have been the serpent and apples in our picturing of the con
stellation that aided Miss Rolleston to her substitution of the biblical Adam for the mythological Hercules. Others, however, changed the latter to SalDIOn with the jawbone of an ass; and Julius Schiller multiplied him into the Three Jlagi.
The Arabians turned the classical Saltator, or Leaper, into Al Rapa, the Dancer; 1 as also 'Evy6vaa, into Al lithiyy a'la llukbataihi, the One who Kneels on both Knees; this subsequently degenerating into Elgesiale rull· baohei, A.loheti hale reohabatih, Blzegeziale, and Elhathi. It also bas often appeared as Alohete and Aloheti; as Algethi, and, in the 1515 Almagest and Aljonsine Tables of 1521, as Algiethi incurvati super genu ipsius. Argelander catalogues 155 naked-eye stars in Hercules, and Reis 227. Between/; and 1/, two thirds of the way from I;, is N. G. C. 6205, 13 M.,the finest cluster in the northern heavens. Halley discovered this in 1714 and thought it a nebula, whence its early title, the Balley Nebula; but it is remarkable that it was not sooner seen, for it is visible by the unaided eye, although only 8' in diameter. Herschel's estimate that it contains 14,000 stars is so high that some regard it as a typographical error for 4000; the number counted by Harvard observers is 724, outside of the nucleus. Mis5 Clerke records an opinion that it may be 558,000 millions of miles in diam· eter, and distant from us sixty-five light years; but we have as yet no certain determination of either size or distance. Burnham notes one of its central stars as double, an infrequent occurrence in compressed clusters; and Campbell of the Lick Observatory writes:

In the Hercules cluster the stars are perhaps very little denser than the streams of nebulous matter in which they are situated, and hence their density is [i.e. may be] only something a thousand millionth part of that of the sun.
Bailey finds no variables in it. In the early days of Arab astronomy a space in the heavens, coinciding with parts of Hercules, Ophiuchus, and Serpens, was the RaufJah, or Pasture, the N orthem Boundary of which, the :Nasa~ Shimiyy, was marked by
the stars 8 and y Herculis, the Syrians' Row of Pearls, with {3 and y Serpentis in continuation of the Pasture line; whiled, a, and e Serpentis, with «J, e, {, and 'I Ophiuchi, formed the Southern Boundary, the :Nua~ Yamaniyya.h. The group of stars now known as the Club of Hercules was the Sheep within the Pasture.

Ru Algethi, also Ru Algathi, on Malby's globe Bu Algothi, is from Al Ria al J'ithiyy, the Kneeler's Head; but it often is Ru Algeti, sometimes B.u Algiatha, and the Standard Dictionary has Ru Algetta. It was Ruacheti with Chilmead, Riccioli's Ru Elhhathi and Ru Alhathi probably came from Ru Alheti of the first three editions of the Aljonsine Tables; but in the 4th edition very incorrectly appeared B.asaben for both the star and the constellation, probably taken from the neighboring Al Ras al Thu'bii.n of Draco;- all Arabian translations of the Greek names. The nomads' title for it was Al Xalb al Rii.'i, the Shepherd's Dog, that our a shared with the adjoining lucida of Ophiuchus, 5° distant. The Chinese called it Ti Tao, the Emperor's Seat; and Tsin. Some small stars in Hercules, near a, were included with t and " Ophiuchi in the asterism Ho, one of the measures of China. This is a beautiful pair, but apparently not binary, for there has been no certain change in the last century. The components are 411.8 apart, at a position angle of 119°. Its variability, discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1795, is now described by Chandler as shown by "very irregular oscillations in periods of two to four months."

perhaps the diminutive of rulilus, "golden red," or "glittering," an adjective
applied to Arcturus ; but this term is by no means appropriate for fl The Ara/Jo-Latin Almagest of 1515 reads rutil&o, addingpropinfUt' cillitiio, this last unintelligible unless explained by the Basel edition of 1551 as pnus axil/am seu scapulam; so that we may perhaps consider the alternative title to be from the barbarism used to show the star's position on the shoulder of the figure. Indeed, Bayer said of it, .Rulilicum /Jarbari dinlfll. Ideler, however, asserted his belief that it was from rutellum, the diminutJ\'e of rutrum, a sharp instrument of husbandry or war, in Roman times, that Hercules in some early representations, especially on the Arabic globes, is carrying. The Century Cyclopedia gives Rutilioo as a rarely used name. {3 was the Chinese Ho Chung, In the River, while the 4th-magnitude)' was Ho Keen, Between the River.

Although Johann Tobias Mayer of Gottingen seems to have been the pioneer, in 1760, in the efforts to ascertain the direction of the sun's motion among the stars, yet Sir William Herschel was the first successful investigator as to this, about 1806, and he settled upon the vicinity of;\. as the objective point of our solar system, the Apu of the Sun'• Way; and his determination was, in a great measur.e, confirmed by later astronomers. Some recent observations, however, change this: either to v of this constellation, to the group of small stars four or five degrees north of west from v, to the immediate vicinity ofWega_in the Lyre, or to the neighborhood of Arided, near the tail of the Swan,-yet all in the same general quarter of the heavens. Thirty-five separate determinations of this Apex, made from 1783 to 1892, locate it variously between 227° 18' and 289° of right ascension, and between 14° 26' and 53° 42' in north declination; the weight of authority being in favor of some point 1 in Hercules near the boundary between it and Lyra. The velocity of the sun's motion is found by Potsdam com
puters of spectroscopic observations to be from 7_1⁄2 to 11 1⁄4 miles a second; this is more reliable than the value deduced by other methods. The Sun'• Quit, the point in the heavens opposite to the Apex, according to Todd, lies about midway between the stars Sirius and Canopus. μ1, a 4th-magnitude triple, half-way between Wega of the Lyre and a Herculis, was the Chinese Xew Ho, the Nine Rivers. The distance between the large star and its 9th-magnitude companion is
I Professor Young thinks the Apex in about 267° of right ascension and 31° of declination, but that the data are not yet sufficient to give a very close determination of either the sun's speed or direction, since the problem is embarrassed by the probability of systematic motions among the stars themselves. Results so far obtained are t,.o be regarded only as rather rough approximations.

Some recent investigations place here the Apex of the Sun's Way. w, a 4th-magnitude double, by some early transcriber's error, is now given as Cujam, from Caiam, the accusative of Caia, the word used by Horace for the Club of Hercules, which is marked by this star. Gaiam, Guiam, and Guyam, frequently seen, are erroneous. In Burritt's Atlas the star is wrongly placed within the uplifted right arm. The Club of Hercules is supposed to have been a separate constellation with Pliny.

lies to the eastward of Achernar,- a of Eridanus,- and north of Hydrus. 'In France it is Orloge; in Italy, Orologio; and in Germany, Pendeluhr. Although shown on the maps, it is rarely mentioned; and the only object in it known to be of special interest is a variable star, detected by Harvard observers in Peru, changing in light from 9.7 to 12.7 in a period of about three hundred days. Gould catalogues 68 stars down to the 7th magnitude; a, the lucida, being 3.8. Whitall had on his planisphere a figure, which he entitled Horoaoope, between " Chemica Fornar" and " Caela Sculptoris," but no Horologium. His title is undoubtedly for our constellation, as it occupies Horologium's place.

Its stars are now well defined under this single title, but anciently were described, with their riders Corvus and Crater, as Ovid wrote:
Anguis, Avis, Crater, sidera juncta micant.
This continued to the 18th century, Flamsteed and other early astronomers making of them even four divisions, Hydra, Hydra et Crater, Hydra et Corn11, and Continuatio Hydrae. Iepa and Bepu, originally African words for the terrestrial crab and scorpion, seem also to have been used for this constellation in classic times. Aratos called it "T6p11; Eratosthenes, Hipparchos, and Geminos, "T6por, the Hydroe of Germanicus, while others wrote it "T6pa; but Eratosthenes again had it all under K6pa}, and Hipparchos also used flpaKwv. In Low Latin it has been Hidra, Idra, and Ydra; and, in the Almagest of 1551, Hydrua in the masculine, which, correct enough before Bayer's day, would now confound it with the new southern figure. Riccioli, and Hyde in his translation of Ulug Beg's catalogue, had it thus, showing its continuance till then as a common title, although often written Idrua and Idrua aquaticu, as well as changed to Serpens aquatioua.
Other names, also used for the northern Dragon, have been Draco, ABiua,
and Ania, or Ania, which Bayer referred to as auovyia non au{Jia; but these are not Greek words, and doubtless are from Al Shuji', the Snake, transformed, as only the late mediaeval astronomical writers and their immediate successors could transform classical and Arabic terms into their Low Latin and Greek ; Chilmead wrote it Alaugahh. Still another conception and title may be seen in the Arabo-Latin A/magest's Stel/atio Ydre: et est species serpenlium: et jam nominatur Asiua. secur'; where the last word, if an abbreviation for securis, " ax," seems not inappropriate when taking the western half of Hydra for a somewhat crooked handle, and Corvus for the ax-head. The Alina, or She Ass, which La Lande mentioned, is probably a continuation of some early type error in the barbarous Asiua. Coluber, the Snake, and Echidna, the Viper, also obtain for Hydra, with the adjectives Furioeu, llagnanimu, and 8ublimatu1, here used as proper nouns, as they were for Orion. The Arabians similarly called it Al ]Jayyah, another of their words for a snake,- El Havie in Riccioli's New A Imagest. Its representation has generally been as we have it, but the H_ygi11us of 1.i88 added a tree in whose branches the Hydra's head is resting; probably a recollection of the dragon that guarded the apple-trees of the Hesperides, although this duty really belonged to our Draco; and at times it has been shown as three-headed. Map-mak~rs have always figured it in its present form, the Cup resting midway on its back, with the Raven peck

ing at one of its folds; Hydra preventing the latter's access to the Cup in punishment for its tattling about Coronis, or for its delay in Apollo's service. The minor constellation Turdu, or Roctlla, only recently has been added to it. Those who saw biblical symbols among the stars called Hydra the Flood; Corvus, :Noah's Raven; and Cmter, the Cup "out of which the patriarch sinned"; but Julius Schiller said that the whole represented the River J'ordan.
The 7th sieu, Lieu, a Willow Branch, or Liu, a Circular Garland,-was the creature's head, 15° south of Praesaepe, d being the determinant, and formed the beak of the Red Bird ; it governed the planets and was worshiped at festivals of the summer solstice as an emblem of immortality. Here, too, was the 7th nakshatra, Atleahi, or .igreahi, the Embracer, fig• ured as a Wheel, with Sarpas, the Serpents, as presiding divinities; i marking the junction with the nakshatra Magha. The 8th sie11, Sing, a Star, anciently Tah, was formed by a, o, and T, with others smaller lying near them, a being the determinant. This asterism constituted the heck of the Red Bird, and, Edkins asserts, was also known as the Seven Stan.
The 9th sieu consisted of K, v1, v, A,μ, q,, and another unascertained, and was called Chang, or Tchang, a Drawn Bow,- Brown says "anciently Tj11Jl8', the Archer,"- v1 being the determinant; the god Chang using this bow to slay the Sky Dog, our Crater. The stars between Corvus and Crater were Xien J(un, and those between 'Y Hydrae and Spica of the Virgin were Tien Kun, Heaven's Gate. These lie beyond the outlines of the Virgin's robe on the Heis map, but on Burritt's are included in the tip of her left wing. Hydra is supposed to be the snake shown on a uranographic stone from the Euphrates, of 1200 B. c., "ideritified with the source of the fountains cf the great deep," and one of the several sky symbols of the great dragon Tiamat. Certain stars near, or perhaps in the tip of Hydra's tail and in Libra, seem to have been the Akkadian Bn-te-na-maa-luv, or Bn-te-na-llllf' mur, the Assyrian Btaen-tairi, the Tail-tip. Theon said that the Egyptians considered it the sky representative of the Bile, and gave it their name for that river. After Al Sufi's day, in our 1cth century, the figure was much lengthened, and now stretches for nearly 95° in a winding course from Cancer to Scorpio; this well agreeing with the fable of its immense marine prototype, the Scandinavian Kraken. Conrad Gesner, the 16th-century naturalist, gave an illustration of this in its apparently successful attack upon the ship Argo.

The constellation cannot be seen in its entirety till Crater is on the meridian. Argelander enumerates in it 75 stars ; Heis, 153. For an unknown period its winding course symbolized that of the moon; hence the latter's nodes are called the Dragon's Head and Tail. When a comet was in them poison was thought to be scattered by it over the world ; but these fanciful ideas are now associated with Draco. Al Sufi mentioned an early Arab figure, Al H•ail, the Horse, formed from stars some of which now belong to our Hydra, but more to Leo and Sextans.

Alphard, Alfard, and Alphml,-Alphart in the Alfonsine Tables and Pherd with Hyde,-are from Al Fard al Shuji', the Solitary One in the Serpent, well describing its position in the sky. Caesius gave Alpharad, which on the Reuter wall-map was Alp!lrad; and a still more changed title is Alphora. The Arabs also knew a as Al F ~ al Shuji', the Backbone of the Serpent; but Ulug Beg changed this to Al 'Unk al Shuji', the Serpent's Neck; and it shared the Suhel of other bright stars as Suhel al Fard, and
Buhel al Shim, the Solitary, and the Northern, Suhail. Tycho first ca1led it Cor Hydrae, the Hydra's Heart,- Riccioli's Kalb Blhavich and Xalbelaphard,- which, with the alternative Collum Hydrae, the Hydra's Neck, is current even now. In China it determined the 8th sieu, and was the prominent star of the Red Bird that combined the seven lunar divisions of the southern quarter of the heavens. Its longitude is said to have been ascertained there in the 19th century before our era, but the statement may be questionable; as also that it was observed passing the meridian at sunset on the day of the vernal equinox during the time of the emperor Yao, about 2350 B. c.

first published by Bayer, must not be confounded with the ancient Hydra. It lies between Horologium and Tucana; the head adjoining the polar Octans, the tail almost reaching the magnificent star Achernar of Eridanus. The French know the figure as l'Hydre Dle; and the Germans as der Kleine Wauenchlange.
Out of this, with Tucana and the Lesser Cloud, Julius Schiller made his biblical constellation Raphael. The Chinese formed from the stars of Hydrus, with others surrounding it, four of their later asterisms : Shay Show, the Serpent's Head, marked by e and~; Shay Fuh, the Serpent's Belly, towards Tucana; Shay We, the Serpent's Tail, entirely within the boundaries of Hydrus; and Foo Pih, ofunknown signification, marked by y, a red 3.2-magnitude, specially mentioned by Corsali in his account of the Magellanic Clouds. In it Gould catalogues 64 stars from 2.7 to 7th magnitudes.

Flamsteed's Atlas has

a similar figuring. Julius Schiller, however, went much further back in point of time and joined it with Pavo as the patriarch J'ob, Indus, or its ludda a, was Pe Sze in China, where it also was known as the Peraian, a title from the Jesuit missionaries. Gould assigned to it 84 naked-eye stars, from 3.1 to 7th magnitudes; but none of these are specially noticeable except the 6.3 y, which may be a variable, and e, with the unusually large proper motion of 4".6 annually, a rate of speed that will carry it to the south pole in 50,000 years.

is the French Uzard, the Italian Lucertola, and the German Eidechae,Bode's Eidexe,- extending from the head of Cepheus to the star 1r at the left foot of Pegasus, its northern half lying in the Milky Way. This inconspicuous constellation was formed by Hevelius from outlying stars between Cygnus and Andromeda, this special figure having been selected because there was not space for any of a different shape. But he drew "a strange weasel-built creature with a curly tail," heading the procession of his offerings to Urania illustrated in his Firmamentum Sobiescia11um of 1687_ Flamsteed's picture is more like a greyhound, but equally uncouth ; that by Heis is typically correct. Its inventor gave it the alternative title of Stellio, the Stellion, a newt with star-like dorsal spots found along the Mediterranean coast. Somewhat coincidently its stars, with those in the eastern portion of Cygnus, were combined by the early Chinese in their Flying Serpent. Hevelius catalogued 10 components; Argelander, 31; and Heis, 48. They come to the meridian about the middle of April. It has no named star, and its lucida, a, is only of 3.9 magnitude. {3, 4.5, marks the radiant point of the Lacertida, a minor meteor stream visible through August and September. Before the Lizard was formed, Royer introduced here, in 1679, the

is Lion in France, Lowe in Germany, and Leone in Italy. In Anglo-Norman times it was Leun, It lies between Cancer and Virgo, the bright Denebola 5° north of the faint stars that mark the head of the latter constellation ; but Ptolemy extended it to include among its apopt/)W,01 the group now Coma Berenices. In Greek and Roman myth this was respectively Mwv and Leo, representing the :Nemean Lion, originally from the moon, and, after his earthly stay. carried back to the heavens with his slayer Hercules, where he became the poet's :Nemeaeua; 1'emea1 A.lumn111; :Nemeea Terror; :Nemeaeum Kon· 1trnm; and, in later times, :No Animal :Nemaeo truoulento of Caml:ies. It also was Cleonaeum Sidua, from Cleonae, the Argohc town near the Nemean forest where Hercules slew the creature; Herculeua; and Herculeum A.atrum. But the Romans commonly knew it as Leo, Ovid writing Jlercu· le111 Leo and Violentua Leo.
Baoohi Sidua was another of its titles, that god always being identified with this animal, and its shape the one usually adopted by him in his numerous transformations; while a lion's skin was his frequent dress. But Manilius had it .Jovil et .Junonia Sidua, as being under the guardianship oi these deities; and appropriately so, considering its regal character, and espe· cially that of its lucida. The Egyptian king N ecepsos, and his philosopher Petosiris, taught that at the Creation the sun rose here near Denebola; and hence Leo "'3' Domicilium Solia, the emblem of fire and heat, and, in astrology, the lloUle of the Sun, governing the human heart, and reigning in modern days oyer Bohemia, France,Italy,and the cities ofBath, Bristol, and Tauntonin Eng· land, and our Philadelphia. In ancient times Manilius wrote of it as rulin~ over Armenia, Bithynia, Cappadocia, Macedon, and Phrygia. It was a fortunate sign, with red and green as its colors; and, according to Ampelius. was in charge of the wind Thrascias mentioned by Pliny, Seneca, ant!

Ancient phys:cians thought that when the sun was in this sign medicine was a poison. and even a bath equally harmful(!); while the weather-wise said that thunder

foretold sedition and deaths of great men. The adoption of this animal's form for a zodiac sign has fancifully been attributed to the fact that when the sun was among its stars in midsummer the lions of the desert left their accustomed haunts for the banks of the Nile, where they could find relief from the heat in the waters of the inundation; and Pliny is authority for the statement that the Egyptians worshiped the stars of Leo because the rise of their great river was coincident with the sun's entrance among them. For the same reason the great Androsphinx is said to have been sculptured with Leo's body and the head of the adjacent Virgo; although Egyptologists maintain that this head represented one of the early kings, or the god Harmachis. Distinct reference is made to Leo in an inscription on the walls of the Ramesseum at Thebes, which, like the Nile temples generally, was adorned with the animal's bristles; while on the planisphere of Denderah its figure is shown standing on an outstretched serpent. The Egyptian stellar Lion, however, comprised only a part.of ours, and in the earliest records some of its stars were shown as a Knife, as they now are as a Sickle. Kircher gave its title there as IltμtvTEICewv, Cubitus Nili. The Persians called it Ser or Shir; the Turks, Artin; the Syrians, Aryo; the Jews, A.rye; and the Babylonians, Aru,-all meaning a Lion; the last title frequently being contracted to their letter equivalent to our A. It was the tribal sign of Judah, allotted to him by his father Jacob as recorded in Genesis xlix, 9, and confirmed by Saint John in The Revelation v, 5; Landseer suggesting that this association was from the fact that Leo was the natal sign of Judah and so borne on his signet-ring given to Tamar. Christians of the Middle Ages and subsequently, who figured biblical characters throughout the heavens in place of the old mythology, called it one of Daniel'• liona; and the apostolic school, doubting Thomu.
On Ninevite cylinders Leo is depicted as in fatal conflict with a bull, typifying the victory of light over darkness; and in Euphratean astronomy it was additionally known as Giabar-namru-1&-pan, variously translated, but by Bertin as the Shining Disc which precedes Bel; the latter being our Ursa Major, or in some way intimately connected therewith. Hewitt says that it was the Akkadian Pa-pil-aak, the Sceptre, or the Great Fire; and Sayce identifies it with the Assyrian month Abu, our July-August, the Fiery Hot; Minsheu assigning as the reason for this universal fiery character of the constellation, " because the sunne being in that signe is most raging and hot like a lion." Thus throughout antiquity the animal and the constellation always have been identified with the sun,-indeed in all historic ages till it finally appears

on the royal arms of England, as well as on those of many of the early noble families of that country. During the 12th century it was the only animal shown on Anglo-Norman shields. As a zodiacal figure it was of course entirely different from the ancient Asad of Arabia, that somewhat mythical Lion extending from Gemini over our Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, and parts of other constellations, both north and south of the zodiac; but the later Arabians also adopted Ptolemy's Leo and transferred to it the Alad of the early constellation. This appeared in the various corrupted forms cited by Bayer,- A1aaid, Al8181',
Am, Auid, and others similar, of which Assemani gives a long list; Schickard adding Aluado and Aleda.ton; and Riccioli, specially mentioning .Aaid and Elleeed, cautioned his readers against the erroneous Alatid and Aleut. Early Hindu astronomers knew it as Alleha, and as Sinha, the Tamil Simham; but the later, influenced by Greece and Rome, as Leya, or Leyaya, from the word Leo. It contained the 8th nakshatra, J[aghi, Mighty, or Generous; as also the 9th and 10th, Piirva, and Uttara, Phalgani, the Former, and the Latter, Phalguni, a word of uncertain meaning,-perhaps the Bad One,- the single station being represented by a J'ig-tree, and the combined by a Bed or Couch. Nearly the same stars were included in the 8th, 9th, and I oth manazil of Arabia as AUabhah, the Forehead; Al Zubrah, the Mane; and Al ~ the Turn. Of the suu, however, none appear in Leo, the Chinese having adopted, instead, stations among the stars of Hydra and Crater, so that many infer that their lunar asterisms were original with themselves. In the later nath·e solar zodiac of China the Lion's stars were the Hone, and in the earlier a part of the Red Bird; while Williams says that they also were Shun Ho, the Quail's Fire; but in the 16th century the Chinese formally adopted our Leo, translating it as Sze Tue. The space between it and Virgo was Tie Wei, or Shaou Wei, and the western half of Leo, with Leo Minor, was regarded as a Yellow Dragon mounting upwards, marked by the line of ten stars from Regulus through the Sickle. It also was another of the HeannlJ Ch&riota of imperial China. Its symbol, f'L, has been supposed to portray the animal's mane, but seems more appropriate to the other extremity; the Hygi11us of 1488 and the Albumasar of 1489 showing this latter member of extraordinary length, twisting between the hind legs and over the back, the Hyginus properly locating the star Denebola in the end; but the International Dicliuna,y, in a more scholarly way, says that this symbol is a corruption of the initial letter of A€wv. Lajard's Cu/le de Mithra mentions the hieroglyph of Leo



The Constellations 255
as among the symbols _of Mithraic worship, but how their Lion agreed, if at all, with ours is not known. One of the sultans of Koniyeh, ancient Iconium, put the stellar figure on his coins. Its drawing has generally been in a standing position, but, in the Leyden Manuscript, in a springing attitude, with the characteristic Sickle fairly represented. Young astronomers know the constellation by this last feature in the fore parts of the figure, the bright Regulus marking the handle; its other stars successively being 17, y, <;,μ,and e. Nor is this a recent idea, for Pliny is thought to have given it separately from Leo in his list of the constellations; but not much could have been left of the Lion after this subtraction except his tail. These same Sickle stars were a lunar asterism with the Akkadians as Oia-me1, the Curved Weapon; with the Khorasmians and Sogdians as Kbarn•bilh, the Scimetar; but with the Copts as Titefui, the Forehead. The sun passes through Leo from the 7th of August to the 14th of September. Argelander catalogues in it 76 stars, and Heis 161. In Leo and Virgo lay the now long forgotten asterism l!'abne, of which ldeler wrote :
The Flag is a constellation of the heavens, one part in Leo and one part in Virgo. Has many stars. On the iron [the arrowhead of the staff] in front one, on the flag two, on every fold of the flag one.
This is illustrated in the 47th volume of Archaeo/ogia, and it appeared as a distinct constellation in a 15th-century German manuscript, perhaps the original of the work of 1564 from which Ideler quoted. Brown repeats a Euphratean inscription, "The constellation of the Yoke like a flag floated," although he claims no connection here, and associates the Yoke with Capricorn.

llegulu was so called by Copernicus, not after the celebrated consul of the 1st .Punic war, as Burritt and others have asserted, but as a diminutive of the earlier Bex, equivalent to the {Jaat1t.to1'or of Ptolemy. This was from the belief that it ruled the affairs of the heavens,- a belief current, till three centuries ago, from at least 3000 years before our era. Thus, as Bharru, the King, it marked the 15th ecliptic constellation of Babylonia; in

In Arabia it was Kalikiyy, Kingly; in Greece, (3amliair6t; au,~p; in Rome, Basilica Stella; with Pliny, B.egia; in the revival of European
astronomy, Rex; and with Tycho, Buililcu. · So, too, it was the leader of the Four Bo7al Stan of the ancient Persian monarchy, the Four Guardians of Heaven. Dupuis, referring to this Persian character, said that the four stars marked the cardinal points, assigning Haatorang, as he termed it, to the North; Venant to the South; Tucheter to the East ; and Sa.tevil to the West : but did not identify these titles with the individual stars. Flammarion does so, however, with Fomalhaut, Regulus, and Aldebaran for the first three respectively, so that we may consider Satevis as Antares. This same scheme appeared in India,although the authorities are not agreed as to these assignments and identifications: but, as the right ascensions are about six hours apart, they everywhere probably were used to mark the early equinoctial and solstitial colures, four great circles in the sky, or generally the four quarters of the heavens. At the time that these probably were first thought of, Regulus lay very near to the summer solstice, and so indicated the solstitial colure. Early English astrologers made it a portent of glory, riches, and power to all born under its influence; Wyllyam Salysbury, of r 552, writing, but perhaps from Proclus :
The Lyon's herte is called of some men, the Royall Starre, for they that are home UD· der it, are thought to have a royal! nativitie.
And this title, the Lion'• Heart, has been a popular one from early classical times, seen in the Kapdia A.E6v,at; of Greece and the Cor Leonia of Rome, and adopted by the Arabians as Al ~b al Aaad, this degenerating into Xalbelaait, Xalbeleoed, Xalbeleceid, Xalbol uadi, Calb-elu-id, Calb-elelit, CallHLlezet, and Kale Alaaed of various bygone lists. Al Biriini called it the Heart of the B.oJal Lion, which" rises when Suhail rises in Al -tlijaz.'' 1 Bayer and others have quoted, as titles for Regulus, the strange Tyberone and Tuberoni B.egia; but these are entirely wrong, and arose from a misconception of Pliny's Stella .Regia appellata Tuberoni in pectore LtqniJ.

Naturally sharing the character of its constellation as the Domicilium Solie, in Euphratean astronomy it was Gul•ba-ra, the Flame, or the Red Fire, of the House of the East; in Khorasmia, Aohir, Possessing Luminous Rays; and throughout classical days the supposed cause of the summer's heat, a reputation that it shared with the Dog-star. Horace expressed this in his Stella vesani Leonis.
It was of course prominent among the lunar-mansion stars, and chief in the 8th nakshatra that bore its name, Kaghi, made up by all the components of the Sickle; and it marked the junction with the adjoining station Pilrva Phalguni; the Pitares, Fathers, being the regents of the asterism, which was figured as a House. In Arabia, with y, {, and 'I of the Sickle, it was the 8th man•il, Al .Jabhah, the Forehead. In China, however, the 8th sieu lay in Hydra; but the astronomers of that country referred to Regulus as the Great Star in Haen Yuen, a constellation called after the imperial family, comprising a, y, e, 'I, ..i., {, X, 11, o, p, and others adjacent and smaller reaching into Leo Minor. Individually it was Iiau, the Bird, and so representative of the whole quadripartite zodiacal group. In addition to the evidence, from its nomenclature, of the ancient importance of this star is the record, although perhaps questionable, of an observation of its longitude 1985 years before the time of Ptolemy; and of a still earlier one in Babylonia, 2120 B. c., Regulus then being in longitude 92° 30', but now over 148°. Its position, and that of Spica, observed by Hipparchos, when compared with the earlier records are said to have revealed to him the phenomenon of the precession of the equinoxes. It was then in longitude 119° 50'. Smyth wrote of it:
The longitude of Regulus has, through successive ages, been made a datum-step by the best astronomers of all nations.

Denebola- sometimes Deneb- is the modem name for this star, abbreviated from Al Dhanab al .Alad, the Lion's Tail, the Greek 'Alr,a[a; Bayer gave it as Denebalecid and Denebaleced; Chilmea<l, as Deneb Alaaed; and Schickard, as Dhanbol-uadi. Riccioli omitted the first syllable of the original, and called the star Nebolelleaed, Nebollaaeid "of the Nubian astrologers," and Alazet apud Azophi, his title for Al Sufi. Elsewhere it is lfebu• luit and Aleait; the Alfomi11e Tables have Denebalezeth and the Yery appropriate Dafl.ra, from the similar Arabic term for the tuft of coarse hair at the end of the tail in which the star lies. Proctor called it Deneb Aleet, and there may be other degenerated forms of the original. Kazwini cited Al A~b al Asad, the Viscera of the Lion, or AI iatab, a Small Saddle:
inappropriate names, Ideler said, and inferred that they should be Al :Jalb, which in the course of time might have wandered here from Regulus, the genuine ~alb, or Heart, of the Lion. It marked the 10th manzil, Al ~arfah, the Changer, i. e. of the weather, given by U lug Beg as the star's individual title; and Al Biriini wrote of it: "The heat turns away when it rises, and the cold turns away when it disappears." Chilmead cited .Aaumpha, which he attributed to Alfraganus; Baily called this Serpha; and Hyde changed it to ltutatrix. With the 4th-magnitude Fl. 93, it constituted the 10th nakshatra, Uttara Phalguni, and was the junction star with the adjacent Hasta; the regents of this and the next asterism, the Piirva Phalguni, being the Adityas, Aryaman and Bagha. Al Biriini, however, said that Hindu astronomers pointed out to him a star in Coma Berenices as forming the lunar station with Denebola; and they claimed that the great scientific attainments of Vara.ha Mihira were due to his birthday having coincided with the entrance of the moon into Uttara Phalguni.
The Chinese knew it, with four small neighboring stars, as Woo Ti TIOi the Seat of the Five Emperors, surrounded by twelve other groups, variously named after officers and nobles of the empire. In Babylonian astronomy it marked the 17th ecliptic constellation, Zibbat A., the Tail of the Lion, although Epping gives this with considerable doubt as to its correctness. Other Euphratean titles are said to have been Lamaah, the Colossus; Sa, Blue, the Assyrian Samu; and Xitid-iati, the

Burning of Fire, which may be a reference to the hot season of the year when the sun is near it. The Sogdians and Khorasmians had a similar conception of it, as shown in their titles Widhu and Widhayu, the Burning One ; but the Persians called it Avdem, the One in the Tail. Hewitt writes of it as, in India, the Star of the Goddeu Babu, the Creating Mother. With 8, it was the Coptic Aaphulia, perhaps the Tail; but Kircher had a similar •A01ro.:l1a, in Virgo, as from Coptic Egypt. . Denebola was of unlucky influence in astrology, portending misfortune and disgrace, and thus opposed to Regulus in character as in position in the figure. Its spectrum is Sirian, and it is approaching our system at the rate of about twelve miles a second. It comes to the meridian on the 3d of May, and, with Arcturus and Spica, forms a large equilateral triangle, as also another similar with Arcturus and Cor Caroli, these, united at their bases, constituting the celebrated Diamond of Virgo. Several small stars, some telescopic, in its immediate vicinity, are the Companiona of Denebola.
T, Double and perhaps binary, 2.2 and 3.5, bright orange and greenish yellow. Smyth wrote of this that it
bas been improperly called Algieba, from A Ije6-6all, the forehead ; for no representation of the Lion, which I have examined, will justify that position,
a well-founded criticism, although as, after Regulus, it is the brightest
member of the manzil Al Jabbah, it may have taken the latter's title. The star, however, is on the Lion's mane, the Latin word for which, luba, distinctly appeared for y with Bayer, Riccioli, and Flamsteed. Hence it is not at all unlikely that Algieba,- also written Algeiba,- is from the Latin, Arabicized either by error in transcription or by design. Sir William Herschel discovered its duplicity in 1782, and Kitchiner asserted that this and a Lyrae are the only stars upon which he ventured to use his high telescopic power of 6450. In 1784 he saw both components of y white, and in 1803 he announced their binary (?) character. They now are 3",7 apart, at a position angle of 1x4°; and according to Doberck have a period of revolution of about 402.62 years, although this is very uncertain, for " since the first reliable measures of distance the change to this time is only 120."

Ulug Beg very correctly termed it Al 'fhahr al Alad, the Lion's Back,
which has become Duhr and Dhur of modem catalogues. With 8, on the hind quarter, it constituted the 9th manzil, Al Zubrah, the Mane, and itself bears this name as Zubra,- strange titles for star and sta• tion so far away from that feature of the animal. d and fJ also were Al Kihil al Alad, the Space between the Shoulders of the Lion ; and Al H-aritin, sometimes transcribed Chortan, and translated the Two Little Ribs, or the two K.hurt, or Holes, penetrating into the interior of the Lion; but all these seem as inapplicable as are the other titles. In India they marked the corresponding nakslzatra, Pina Phalguni, 6 being the junction star between the two Phalguni asterisms. On the Euphrates they were Kakkab Xu.a, the constellation of the god Kua, the Oracle; and in Egypt, according to Hewitt, M:8Hll, the Heart of Su.. In Sogdiana they were Wadha, the Wise; in K.horasmia, Armagh, the Great; and with the Copts Pikhorion, the Shoulder. In China d was Shang Seang, the Higher Minister of State. Its spectrum is Sirian, and the star is approaching our system at the rate of about nine miles a second. Flamsteed observed it and 6 Virginis on the 13th of December, 1690, with the object which nearly a century later proved to be the planet Uranus. He made record of the observation, but without any thought of having seen a hitherto unknown member of our system.

From a point a little to the west of;, and not much farther from y,1 issue the Leonida, the meteor stream of November 9th to 17th, its maximum now occurring on the 13th-14th, which about every thirty-three years has furnished such wonderful displays, the ·last in 1866 and the next due in 1899. Their first noticed appearance may have been in the year 137, since which date the stream has completed fifty-two revolutions. According to Theophanes of Byzantium, the shower was seen from there in November, 472; but the late Professor Newton, our deservedly great authority on the whole subject of meteors, commenced his list of the Leonids with their appearance on the 13th of October, 902, the Arabian Year of the Stars, during the night of the death of King Ibrahim hen Ahmad, and added:
It will be seen that all these showers are at intervals of a third of a century, that they are at a fixed day of the year, and that the day has moved steadily and uniformly along the calendar at the rate of about a month in a thousand years.
Oppolzer's and Leverrier's observations showed the identity of their orbit with that of Tempel's comet, I of 1866; and they are supposed to have entered our system by some comparatively recent action, as they still come in shoals and are not lengthened out in a continuous line. It was suggested by Leverrier, and confirmed by Adams, that Uranus may have produced this effect early in the year 126 of our era. Apparently the most remarkable showers in the long Leonid history were the one observed by Von Humboldt and his companion Bonpland on the 12th of November, 1799, from Venezuela, and by various other observers throughout the western hemisphere; and that of November 13, 1833, splendidly seen from this country. The lesser one of the 13th-14th of November, 1866, was more especially noticeable from the Old World, and others, remarkable yet gradually declining, were annually seen from 1867 to 1869. These meteors appear at an elevation of from sixty-one to ninety-six miles, during the latter part of the night, at a speed of forty-four miles a

The stream seems to be lengthening, and consequently thinning out, so that the great displays of long period may eventually cease, while the annual may become more brilliant than now. Many other meieor streams are visible about the same time as the Leonids, Mr. W. F. Denning having given a list of sixty-eight; the brightest of these, the Ursida, being often mistaken by the casual observer for the Leonicis, as their radiant, nearμ Ursae Majoris, is less than 20° distant from the radiant in Leo.

Aratos is supposed to have alluded to these " ungrouped, unnamed" stars under the hind paws of Ursa Major; and Ptolemy had some of them among the aμopq,w-ro, of his Aewv. Ideler surmised that they were the Arabs' Al '.fhibi' wa-Auliduhi, the Gazelle with her Young, shown in this location on the Borgian globe; but Lach, that they were Al 1Jau4, the Pond, into which the Gazelle sprang, as noted under Coma Berenices. The Chinese made two asterisms of it,- lluy Ping, an Inner Screen, and Seaou Wei; but also included our Lesser Lion with the Greater in their still greater Dragon mounting to the highest heavens, and in yet another figure, the State Chariot.

With the Greeks of Sicily, the country noted in early days for the great devasta• tions by hares, the constellation was Afooptf, whence came the fanciful story

that our Hare was placed in the heavens to be close to its hunter, Orion. Riccioli enlarged upon this in his Almagestum NQVum:
Quia Orign in gratiam Dianae, qnae leporino sanguine gaudebat, plurimum venatu leporis gauderet.
Among the Romans it'was simply Lopu, often qualified by the descriptive auritus, "eared"; ddsfpus, ''rough-footed"; levipes, "light-footed"; and nlor, "swift." The Arabians adopted the classical title in their Al Arnab, which degenerated into Alamebet, Elarneb, and Harneb; and the Hebrews are said to have known it as Arnebeth; but the early Arabs designated the principal stars- a, (3, y, and d- as Al XuraiJJ al labbir and Al 'Anh al lauah, the Chair of the Giant and the Throne of the J auzah. Kazwini, repeating this, added, in Ideler's rendering, Gott weiss wie sons/ noel,, which Smyth assumed to be Ideler's comment thereon ; but it was merely his translation of Kazwini's Arabic formula, God is the Omniscient, used when a writer did not wish to come to a decision. Smyth further wrote of it :

Al Sufi also cited the occasional Al Nihil, the Thirst-slaking Camels, for the four bright stars, in reference to the near-by celestial river, the Milky Way. It is in the space occupied by Lepus, or perhaps by Monoceros, that Hommel locates the E~phratean Udkagaba, the Smiting Sun Face, although Brown assigns this to Sagittarius, "the original Sagittary being the sun." Hewitt says that in earliest Egyptian astronomy Lepus was the Boat of
Oliria, the great god of that country, identified with Orion. The Chinese knew it as Tlih, a Shed. Caesius made the constellation represent one of the hares prohibited to the Jews; but Julius Schiller substituted for it Gideon'• Fleece. The Denrlerah planisphere has in its place a Serpent apparently attacked by some bird of prey ; ·and Persian zodiacs imitated this. Gould catalogues in Lepus 103 stars down to the 7th magnitude. Aelian, of our 2d century, in his IIep{ ;wwv ,d16r17ro(;, referred to the early belief that the hare detested the voice of the raven,-a belief that has generally been put among the zoological fables of antiquity; but Thompson suggests for it an astronomical explanation, as "the constellation Lepus sets soon after the rising of Corvus"; and something similar may be said of Lepus in connection with Aquila, for the

eagle in combat with the hare is frequent on gems, and on coins of Agrigentum, Messana, Elis, etc.••• the wide occurrence of this subject ••• indicates a lost mythological significance, in which one is tempted to recognize a Solar or Stellar symbol.
Brown writes of the often discussed comparative location of Lepus and Orion: •
The problem which perplexed the ancients, why the Mighty-hunter and his Dog should pursue the most timid of creatures, is solved when we recognize that Orion was originally a solar type, and that the Hare is almost universally a lunar type;
and mentions the very singular connection between this creature and the moon shown on Euphratean cylinders, Syrian agate seals, Chinese coins, the Moon-cakes of Central Asia, and in the legends of widely separated nations and savage tribes. Astronomical folk-lore has many allusions to this interesting association of animal with satellite, and indirectly with our constellation. The common idea that it is because all are nocturnal does not seem satisfactory ; and there are others still less so, some being mentioned by Beaumont and Fletcher in the Faithful Shepherd. A brief digression to some of these allusions may be allowed here. The Hindus called the moon c;ac;in, or ~a~nka, Marked with the Hare, from the story told of Sakya muni (Buddha). This holy man, in an early stage of his existence, was a hare, and, when in company with an ape and a fox, was applied to by the god Indra, disguised as a beggar, who, wishing to test their hospitality, asked for food. All went in search of it, the hare alone returning unsuccessful; but, that he might not fall short in duty to his guest, had a fire built and cast himself into it for the latter's supper. In return, Indra rewarded him by a place in the moon where we now see him. Other Sanskrit and Cingalese tales mention the palace of the king of the hares on the face of the moon; the Aztecs saw there the rabbit thrown by one of their gods; and the Japanese, the Jeweled Hare pounding om«Ai, their rice dough, in a mortar. Even the Khoikhoin, the Hottentots of South Africa, and the Bantus associated the hare and moon in their worship, and connected them in story, asserting that the hare, ill treated by the moon, scratched her face and we still see the scratches. Eskimos think the moon a girl fleeing from her brother, the sun, because he had disfigured her face by ashes thrown at her; but in Greenland the sex of these luminaries is interchanged, and the moon pursues his sister, the sun, who daubs her sooty hands over his face. The Khasias of the Himalayas say that every month the moon falls in love with his mother-in-law, who very properly repulses his affection by throwing ashes at him. Other ideas to account for the lunar marks are current among many na

tions. One from our North American Indians appears m Longfellow's Hiawatha.
Once a warrior very angry, Seized his grandmother, and threw her Up into the sky at midnight; Right against the moon he threw her; 'Tis her body that you see there.
The Incas knew them as a beautiful mairlen who fell in love with the moon and joined herself forever to him; the New Zealanders, as a woman pulling gnaluh; the Hervey Islanders, as the lovely Ina, an earthly maiden carried away to be our satellite's wife, and still visible with her pile of taro leaves and tongs of a split cocoanut branch ; and the Samoans, as a woman with her child and the mallet with which she is pounding out sheets of the native paper cloth. So that all these people long ago anticipated pretty Selene,1 of whom Serviss tells us. In southern Sweden a brewing-kettle is imagined on the moon's face ; in northern Germany and Iceland, Hjuki and Bil with their mead burden, the originals of our Jack and Jill with their pail of water, the contents scattered or retained according to the lunar phases. In Frisia the marks were a man . who had stolen cabbages, and whom, when discovered, his suffering neighbors wished in the moon, and so it turned out; or a sheep-stealer, with his dog, who enticed the animals to him by cabbages, and, when detected, was transported to the moon, where he is now seen, cabbages and all. But others said that he was caught with a bundle of osier willows that did not belong to him, and there he is on the moon's face with his plunder. Danish folk-lore makes the moon a cheese formed from the milk that has run together out of the Milky Way ; which recalls Rabelais' now familiar remark that some thought the moon made of green cheese. Those biblically inclined saw here the llagdalen in tears; or ludu 11cariot; and, in the earlier record, the patriarch laoob; ll&ILC with the wood for the sacrifice; the Hebrew 1U1Der gathering sticks on the Sabbath ; or Cain driven from the face of the earth to the face of the moon. This appeared even with Dante, Chaucer, and Shakespeare, for the first had in the
Paradiso:

Ages before all this, however, the Egyptians had similar ideas; the Hindus called the moon Mriga, an Antelope; the Aelhiopians saw that creature in it; while the Greeks knew it as the Gorgon's bead, and Plutarch thought the phenomenon worthy a special treatise in his De Fade in Or6e Luwot. But perhaps too much attention has been paid to a probably very dead star: - let us return to those certainly alive, our more legitimate subject.

Its variability, in a very irregular period of about 438 days, was first recorded by Schmidt in 1855, but accurate observations of maxima and minima are difficult in high latitudes.

The early Greeks did not associate its stars with a Balance, so that many have thought it substituted in comparatively recent times for the Chelae, the Claws of the Soorpion, that previously had been known as a distinct · portion of the double sign; Hyginus characterizing it as dimidia pars &orpionis, and Ptolemy counting eight components in the two divisions of his X71laf,- {36pe,or and v6not;,- with nine ti.μ6p<pwTot.

codices of the 9th century into Zichoa. They were the equivalents of the Latin lugum, the Yoke, or Beam, of the Balance, first used as a stellar title by Geminos, who, with Varro, mentioned it as the sign of the autumnal equinox. Ptolemy wrote these two Greek titles indiscriminately, and so did the Latin poets the three,- Chelae, Jugum, Libra,- although the scientific writers of Rome all adhered to Libra, and such has been its usual title from their day. The ancient name was persistent, however, for the Latin Almagest of 1551 gave a star as infago sive chelis, and Flamsteed used it in his description of Libra's stars. The statement, often seen, that the constellation was invented when on the equinox, and so represented the equality of day and night, was current even with Manilius,
Then Day and Night are weigh'd in Li6ra's Scales Equal a while,
repeated by James Thomson in the Autumn of his Seasons,
Li6ra weighs in equal scales the year,
by Edward Young in his Imperium Pelagi, apostrophizing his king,
The Balance George I from thine Which weighs the nations, learns to weigh More accurate the night and day,
and by Longfellow in his Poefs Calendar for September,

This idea gave rise to the occasional title lloctipares; yet Libra is rarely figured on an even balance, but as described by Milton where
The fiend look'd up, and knew His mounted scale aloft.
The Romans claimed that it was added by them to the original eleven signs, which is doubtless correct in so far as they were concerned in its modern revival as a distinct constellation, for it first appears as Libra in classical times in the Julian calendar 1 which Caesar as ponlifex ma.:cimw

took upon himself to form, 46 B. c., aided by Flavius, the Roman scribe, and Sosigenes, the astronomer from Alexandria. Some have associated Andrew Marvell's line,
Outshining Virgo or the Julian star,
with Libra, but this unquestionably referred to the comet of 43 B. c. that appeared soon after, and, as Augustus asserted, in consequence of, Caesar's as.,;assination in September of that year, being utilized by the emperor and Caesar's friends to carry his soul to heaven. This comet, perhaps, was the same that has since appeared in 531, uo6, and 1680, and that may return m 2255. Medals still in existence show Libra held by a figure that Spence thought represented Augustus as the dispenser of justice; thus recalling Vergil's beautiful allusion, in his 1st Georgie, to the constellation's place in the sky. Addressing the emperor, whose birthday coincided with the sun's entrance among the stars of the Claws, he suggested them as a proper resting-place for his soul when, after death, he should be inscribed on the roll of the gods: Anne novum tardis sidus te mensibus addas, Qua locus Erigonen inter Chelasque sequentes Panditur; ipse tibi jam brachia contrahit ardens Scorpius, et coeli justa plus parte relinquit;
so intimating that the place was then vacant, the Scorpion having contracted his claws to make room for his neighbor. But subsequently he wrote: Libra die somnique pares ubi fecerit horas;
and a few lines further on tells of twelve constellations,- dUQdena astra. Milton has a reference in .Paradise Lost to Libra's origin, where

is similar; but, although doubtless the original of Milton's verse, probably is not a reference to our Libra; for the Greek poet very likely antedated the knowledge of it in his country, and is supposed to have known but few of

our stellar figures,-at all events, has alluded to but few in either the Iliad or the Odyssey.
Bayer said that the Greeks called it Ira8μ6(", a Weigh-beam, and !.Tdff//1, a Weight; while Theon used for it the old Sicilian Afrpa and Afrpru, which, originally signifying a Weight, became the Roman Libra. Ampeliuscalled it llocho1, after the inventor of the instrument ; and Virgo's title, Albw, the Starry Goddess, the Greek t:..lK1J, has sometimes been applied to these stars as the impersonation of Justice, whose symbol was the Scales. Addison devoted the 100th number of the Taller-that of the 29th of November, 1709 -to "that sign in the heavens which is called by the name of the Balance," and to his dream thereof in which he saw the Goddess of Justice descending from the constellation to regulate the affairs of men; the whole a very beautiful rendering of the ancient thought connecting the Vir~n Astraea with Libra. He may have been thus inspired by recollections of his student days at Oxford, where he must often have seen this sign, as a Judge in full robes, sculptured on the front of Merton College. Manilius, using the combined title, wrote of it in much the same way as of influence over the legal profession:
This Rul'd at Stroiu.r' Birth, who first did give Our Law.r a Bting,
a reference to Servius Sulpicius Rufus Lemonia, the great Roman lawyer, pupil, and friend of Cicero. Cicero himself used J ugum as though it were well known ; and, with evident intention of upsetting Caesar's claim to its invention, wrote:

The sacred books of India mention it as Tuli, the Tamil Tulam or To]am, a Balance; and on the zodiac of that country it is a man bending on one
knee and holding a pair of scales; but Varliha Mihira gave it as J"up or J"uka, from {vy6v, and so a reflex of Greek astrqnomy, which we know ca~e into India early in our era; but he also called it Fire, perhaps a recoll~c11on of its early Altar form, mentioned further on. In China it was Show Si11g, the Star of Longevity, but later, copying our figure, it was Tien Ching, the Celestial Balance; and that country had a law for the annual regulation of weights supposed to have been enacted with some reference to this sign. In the early solar zodiac it was the Crooodile, or Dragon, the national emblem.



The Constellations 273
Manetho and Achilles Tatios said that Libra originated in Egypt; it plainly appears on the Denderah planisphere and elsewhere simply as a Scale-beam, a symbol of the Nilometer. Kircher gave its Coptic-Egyptian title as A"/l/3ad£a, Stano .Propitialionis.
The Hebrews are said to have known it as Komayim, a Scale-beam, Riccioli's Kilnaim, inscribing it, some thought, on the banners of Asher, although others claimed Sagittarius for this tribe, asserting that Libra was unknown to the Jews and that its place was indicated by their letter Tau, while still others claimed Virgo for Asher, and Sagittarius for Joseph. The Syrians called it Kua'thi, which Riccioli gave as Kuathre j and the Persians, Terizi or Tariziik, all signifying Libra; the Persian sphere showing a human figure lifting the Scales in one hand and grasping a lamb in the other, this being the usual form of a weight for a balance in the early East. Arabian astronomers, following Ptolemy, knew these stars as Al Zubini, the Claws, or, in the dual, Al Zubinatain, degenerating in Western use to the .Anbene of the 1515 Almagest; but later on, when influenced by Rome, they became Al Xi&tin, the Trays of the Balance, and Al JDdn, the Scale-beam, Bayer attributing the latter to the Hebrews. This appeared in the Alfonsine Tables and elsewhere as AJmiu.n, .Almizen, limn; Schickard writing it Jlidaanon. Kircher, however, said that Wun, Weight, is the word that should be used instead of Zubana; Riccioli adopting this in his Vuneeohemali and Vuneganubi, or Vunegenubi, respectively applied to the Northern and Southern Scale as well as to their luddae. Libra is stamped on the coins of Palmyra, as also on those of Pythodoris, queen of Pontus. While it seems impossible to trace with any certainty the date of formation of our present figure and its place of origin, yet there was probably some figure here earlier than the Claws, and formed in Chaldaea in more shapes than one; indeed, Ptolemy asserted that it was from that country, while Ideler and modem critics say the same. Brown thinks that its present symbol, ~, generally considered a representation of the beam of the Balance, shows the top of the archaic Euphratean Altar, located in the zodiac next preceding Scorpio, and figured on gems, tablets, and boundary stones, alone or in a pair. Miss Clerke recalls the association of the 7th month, Tashritu, with this 7th sign and with the Holy Mound, Tul Ku, designating the biblical Tower of Babel, surmounted
by an altar,- the stars in this constellation, a, μ, ~. d, {3, x, (, and v, well showing a circular altar. Sometimes this Euphratean figure was varied to that of a Cenaer, and frequently to a Lamp; Strassmaier confirming this by 18

his translation of an inscription as die Lampe al■ B'uru, the Solar Lamp. synonymous with Bir, the Light, also found for the sky figure. In this connection it will be remembered that another of the names for our Ara, a reduplication of the zodiacal Altar, was Pharus, or Pharos, the Great Lamp. or Lighthouse, of Alexandria, one of the seven wonders of the world. This Lamp also has been found shown on boundary stones as held in the Scorpion's claws, and we see the same idea even as late as the Farnese globe and the Hyginus of 1488, where the Scales have taken the place of the Lamp. When the Altar, Censer, and Lamp were in the course of time forgotten, or removed to the South, the Claws were left behind, and perhaps extended, till they in turn were replaced by Libra. Miss Clerke additionally writes :
The 8th !lign is frequently doubled, and it is difficult to avoid seeing in the pair of Z"" diacal scorpions, carve<l on Assyrian cylimlers, the prototype or the Greek Scorpion ar.d Claws. Both Libra and the sign it eventually superseded thus owned a Chaldaean binhplace.
Brown also says that the Euphratean Sugi, the Chariot Yoke, which he identifies.with a and {j of this constellation, remind us by sound and signification of the Zvy6v and Jugum of Greece and Rome respectively, and that astrology adds evidence in favor of a Chaldaean origin, for it has always claimed Libra-the Northern Scale at least-as a fruitful sign. taking this from the very foundations of astrology in the Chaldaean belief that "when the Sugi stars were clear the crops were good" In modem astrology, however, the reverse of this held in the case of the Southern Scale. It seems not unreasonable to conclude that in Chaldaea the 7th sign had origin in all its 'forms. In classical astrology the whole constituted the ancient Houe ofVenu, for, according to Macrobius, this planet appeared here at the Creation; and, moreover, the goddess bound together human couples under the yoke of matrimony. From this came the title Veneril Sidu, although others asserted that Mars was its guardian; astrologers of the 14th century insisting that
Whoso es born in yat sync snl be an ille doar and a traytor.

and governed the lumbar region of the human body. Its modem reign has been over Alsace, Antwerp, Austria, Aethiopia, Frankfurt, India, Lisbon, Livonia, Portugal, Savoy, Vienna, and our Charleston; but in classical times over Italy and, naturally enough from its history, especially over Rome, with Vulcan as its guardian. It thus became Vulcani Sid111. To it was assigned control of the gentle west wind, Zephyrus,1 personified as the son of Astraeus and Aurora. Pious heathen called it Plut.o'■ Chariot, in which that god carried off Proserpina, the adjacent Virgo; but early Christians said that it represented the Apoatle Philip; and Caesius identified it with the Balanoe■ of the Book 11/ Daniel, v, 27, in which Belshazzar had been weighed and "found wanting." Argelander enumerated in it 28 stars down to 5.8 magnitude; and Heis, 53 down to 6.5; but its boundaries often have been confused with those of Scorpio.

Zubene■chamali, sometimes Zuben el Chamali, is from Al Zubin al Shamili1J'&h, the equivalent of X'7A~ {36peio,;, the Northern Claw; lifa
borealil is Arabic and Latin for the Northem Scale Tray; Bayer's L1111 ■eptentrionali■ signifies the same thing; and Vazne■ohemali, the Southern Weight, was used by Riccioli. So that /3, as well as a, seems always to have borne the name of that half of the constellation figure which it marked. Miss Bouvier's and Burritt's Zubenelgemabi is entirely wrong, both in orthography and in application to this star. Epping says that it marked the 22d ecliptic constellation of Babylonia, lfuru ■ha-Iltinu, the Northern Light; while Jensen assigns it and a to that country's lunar asterism Zibanitu, connecting this word with the similar Arabic Zubana; but this is not generally accepted. Brown considers that, under the name ofthe Sugi Stan, they were associated with Bilat, the Lad)", or Belti■ ; and that the Persians knew them as Qrob, the Homed ; the Sog· dians, as Ghanwand, the Claw-possessing, equivalent to the Khorasmian Ighnllll&, and the Coptic Pritithi, the Two Claws,-all these being lunar stations. According to Ptolemy, an observation was made at Babylon on the 17th of January, 272 B. c.,-in the 476th year of Nabonassar, or Nabu-nazir,- of the very near approach of Mars 1 to /3, one of the earliest records that we have of this planet. Hind, however, mentioned this approach as in connection with (3 of Scorpio.

Professor Young states the opinion that {3 Librae formerly was brighter than Antares, now more than a full magnitude higher, for Eratosthenes distinc_tly called {3 "the brightest of all" in the combined Scorpion and Claws; and Ptolemy, 350 years later, gave to it and Antares the same brilliancy. Yet Antares may be the one that has increased. The color is very unusual, perhaps unique, in conspicuous stars, for Webb says that in the heavens" deep green, like deep blue, is unknown to the naked eye." Its spectrum is Sirian, and the star is approaching our system at the rate of six miles a second. The globular cluster N. G. C. 5904, 5 M., discovered by Kirch in 1702, lies in Libra, above the beam of the Balance, not far from (3 and toward the 5th-magnitude 5 Serpentis. Messier could not resolve this, but Sir William Herschel, with his forty-foot reflector, counted in it more than two hundred 11th- to 15th-magnitude stars, besides those unresolved in the compressed nucleus. But it is chiefly noticeable from the recent photographic discovery by Bailey, at Arequipa, of at least forty-six, perhaps sixty, variables in the cluster,- a remarkable fact paralleled, so far ·as yet known, only in the cluster N. G. C. 5272, 3M., of Canes Venatici. In 1890 Parker already had discovered two variables in 59p4 by visual observation.

is the Loup of the French, Lupo with the Italians, and Wolirin Germany. an idea for the figure said to be from the astrologers' erroneous translation of Al Fahd, the Arabian title for this constellation, their Leopard, or Panther; although Suidas, the Greek lexicographer of 970, is reported to ha1·e called it K1171,ciar, a word for the wolf found in the fables of Babrias of the century before our era. The Greeks and Romans did not specially designate these stars, and thought of them merely as a Wild Animal, the 8f/11io1· of Aratos, Hipparchos, and Ptolemy; the Beltia ofVitruvius; Fera of Germanicus; Quadrupes vast& of Cicero; Hostia, the Victim, of Hyginus; Hostiola, cited by Hayer; Bestia Centauri, by Riccioli; and Victim.a Centauri. The Wolf reappeared as Lupus in the Aljonsine Ta/J/es, and as Pm Lupus in the Lalin A/magesls, while Grotius said that Panthen was Capella's name for it. Bayer also had Equus muoulu and Leaena; and La Lande, Leo marin111, Deferens leonem, Canis ululam, Leopardu, Lupa, Iartiu,-the wolf being sacred to Mars,-and Lyoisoa, the Hybrid of the Wolf. Belu, the Monster, is found in early works. The Arabians also called it Al Asadah, the Lioness,- found by Scaliger repeated on a Turkish planisphere and cited by Bayer as ABicla,- and AI Babu', the Wild Beast, Chilmead's Al Subahh. But the Desert astronomer> seem to have mixed some of its smaller stars with a part of the Centaur as Al Shamirili, the Palm Branches, and '94,b al Kann, the Vine Branch. Zibu, the Beast, of Euphratean cylinders, may be for this constellation; and Urbat, the Beast of Death, or the Star of the Dead Fathers, is a title , for it attributed to the Akkadians. Caesius said that in Persia it was Bridemif, but Hyde, commenting on



The Constellations 2 79
this from Albumasar, asserted that the word should be Bird'iin, the Packhorse, and was really intended for the Centaur. Aratos wrote of it, "another creature very firmly clutched," and " the Wild-beast which the Centaur's right hand holds " as an offering to the gods upon the Altar, and so virtually a part of the Centaur; but Eratosthenes described it as a Wine-■kin from which the Centaur was about to pour a libation; while others imagined both the Beast and the Wine-skin in the Centaur's grasp. Mythologists thought it the animal into which Lycaon was changed; Caesius, that it was the Wolf to which Jacob likened Benjamin; but Julius Schiller saw in its stars Benjamin himself. Although very ancient, Lupus is inconspicuous, lying partly in the Milky Way, south of Libra and' Scorpio, east of the Centaur, with no star larger than 2.6 magnitude, while the few visible in the latitude of New York City-y, d, ), and μ-are even smaller than this. Gould enumerates 159 naked-eye stars, among which is an unusual proportion of doubles. a, 2.6, seems to be unnamed except in China, where it was Yang Kun or Ken, the South Gate. On the Euphrates it probably was Kakkab Su-gub Gud-Elim, the Star Left Hand of the Horned Bull, said to have been a reference to the Centaur that was thus figured in that valley. It culminates on the 14th of June, nearly due south from Arcturus and north of a Centauri. (3 is the Xe Kwan, of the Reeves list of Chinese titles, a Ca\'alry Officer.

in our motto, some in front of the Greater Bear; but for the modem figure we are indebted to Hcvelius. He used in it nineteen stars, and in explaining the title said that those who would examine the Lynx ought to be lynxeyed, in which he acknowledged the insignificance of the components. Of these Argelander has catalogued 42, and Heis 87; but the boundaries are not accurately determined. The alternative name, now in disuse, came from the fancied resemblance of the many little stars to spots on the tiger; and the same word was applied by Bartschius in 1624, although as the river Tigria, to some stars that subsequently were made into the Polish Bull and the Little Fox with the Goose. In the Lynx appeared in July, 1893, the much-discovered comet b of that year, the Rordame-Quenisset. The constellation seems chiefly noticeable for the beauty of its numerous doubles, of which Espin mentions fifty in his edition of Webb's Celestial Ob.feels. Of one of these Professor Young writes in his Ura11ography:
38, or p Lyncis; Mags. 4, 7. 5; Pos. 240°; Dist. 2 11.9; white and lilac. This is the northern one of a pair of stars which closely resembles the three pairs that mark the pa•·s of Ursa Major. This pair makes nearly an isosceles triangle with the two pairs, /land t 1< Ursae Majoris.

From its ownership by these divinities came various adjectival titles: 'Epμai11 and Kv.V.e11al'1, referring to Hermes and his birthplace; Cicero's Clara FidN Cyllenea and Kercurialil, that Varro also used; and the Citha.ra, or LJra, Apollinil, Orphei, Orphioa, and Iercurii It also was LJ'l'I, Arionil and Amphioni1, from those skilful players; but usually it was plain Lyra and, later on, Cithara; Fide■,- the Fidia of Columella, who, with Pliny, also used Fidioula; Decaohordum; and Tympanum. In this same connection we see Fidica, the Lyrist; Deferen1 P■alterium; and Cantiaum, a Song. The occasional early title Aquil&ri■ was from the fact that the instrument was often shown hanging from the claws of the Eagle also imagined in its stars. In Greece it was KilJdpa; the ancient cl>6p/.tt}'~, the first stringed instrument of the Greek bards; and Avpa or Avp11, and Avpa ttaTOft,Ep~r. the Pendent Lyre. Ovid mentioned its seven strings as equaling the number of the Pleiades; Longfellow confirming this number in his Occultation of Orio11:
with its celestial keys, Its chords of air, its frets of fire, The Samian's great Aeolian Lyre, Rising through all its sevenfold bars, From earth unto the fix~d stars.
Still it has been shown with but six, and a vacant space for the seventh, which Spence, in the Po/ymttis, referred to the Lost Pleiad. Manilius seems to have made two distinct constellations of this,- Lyra and Fides,- although we do not know their boundaries, and the subject is somewhat confused in his allusions to it. The Persian Hafiz called it the LJT9 of Zurah, and his countrymen trans
lated K,8dpa by '8,nJ Riimi; the Arabians turning this into Al ,anJ, from which Hyde and others derived A■ange,Alenger,A■ange1,.Alangue,Sangue, and KN&Dg1lo, all titles for Lyra in Europe centuries ago. But Assemani thought that these were from Schickard's Anango, a Cymbal. The repro

duced Alfonsine Tables of 1863-67 give Alla.nja; while $anj was again turned into Amig and Amig in the translation of Reduan's D,m,nnr/ary·, and into the still more unlikely Brinek, as has been explained by Ideler. In Bohemia our Lyra was lla.U1lioky na B'ebi, the Fiddle in the Sky: but the Teutons knew it as Ha.rapha, and the Anglo-Saxons as llearpe, which Fortunatus of the 6th century, the poet-bishop of Poitiers, called the barbarians' HarpL With the early Britons it was Talyn Arthur, that hero·s Harp. Novidius said that it was King David'■ Harp; but Julius Schiller, that it was the Kanger of the Infant Saviour, Prae■epe Salvatoril.
Jugum has been wrongly applied to it, from the Zvy6v of Homer, but thi; was for the Yoke, or Cross-bar, of the instrument, with no reference to the constellation, which Homer probably did not know; still the equh•alent Zvywμa was in frequent use for it by Hipparchos. Sundry other fancied figures have been current for these stars. Acosta mentioned them as Urcuohillay, the parti-colored Ram in charg( of the heavenly flocks of the ancient Peruvians; Albegala and Albeplo occur with Bayer and Riccioli, like the Arabic AI Baghl, a Mule, although their appropriateness is not obvious; and Nasr al Din wrote of a, r, and ( collecti\'ely as Dik Paye among the common people of Persia; this was the Xv-rpo-rrovf, or Greek tripod, and the Uth11.yyah of the nomad Arabs. Chirka, also attributed to Na~r al Din, was, by some scribe's error for :B:azaf, figured in this location on the Dresden globe as a circular vessd with a flat bottom and two handles; but on the Borgian it is a Scroll, com• monly known, according to Assemani, as Babe■oo. The association of Lyra's stars with a bird perhaps originated from a conception of the figure current for millenniums in ancient India,- that of an Eagle or Vulture; and, in Akkadia, of the great storm-bird Urakhp before this was there identified with Corvus. But the Arabs' title, Al la, al Wip' ,1 - Chilmead's Alvaka,- referring to the swooping Stone Eagle oi the Desert, generally has been attrieuted to the configuration of the group a, 1:, (, which shows the bird with half-closed wings, in contrast to Al la, al ~i'ir,1 the Flying Eagle, our Aquila, whose smaller stars, {3 and y, 011 either side of a, inciicate the outspread wings. Scaliger cited the synonymous Al B'8,f!' al Siki~, from which came the B'euru■akat of Bayer and l'•ru· 1akito of Assemani. Al Sufi, alone of extant Arabian authors, called it Al braa, the Goose. Chrysococca wrote of it as rv,p ,cafJ~11ei•of, the Sitting Vulture, and it has been Aquila marina, the Osprey, and Falco ■ylve■tri■, the Wood Falcon.
1 These are two of the few instances in Arab astronomy where more than one star •·er, utilized to represent an animate object.



The Constellations
Its common title two centuries ago was Aquila cadena, or Vultur oaden■, the Swooping Vulture, popularly translated the Falling Grype, and figured with upturned head bearing a lyre in its beak. Bartsch's map has the outline of a lyre on the front of an eagle or vulture. Aratos called it X€.:lvi; o.:tly11, the Little Tortoise or Shell, thus going back to the legendary origin of the instrument from the empty covering of the creature cast upon the shore with the dried tendons stretched across it. Lowell thus described its discovery and use by Hermes:
So there it lay through wet and dry, As empty as the last new sonnet, Till by and by came Mercury, And, having mused upon it, "Why, here," cried he," the thing of things In shape, material and dimension! Give it but strings and, lo! it sings A wonderful invention."
The equivalent Latin word Chdys does not seem to have been often applied to the constellation, but the occasional adjectival titles Lutaria, Mud-inhabiting, and Karina were, and are, appropriate, while Te■tudo has been known from classical times. Horace thus alluded to it:
Decus Phoebi, et dapibus supremi Grata testudo Jovis; 0 laborum Dulce lenimen ;
the poet cioubtless having in mind the current story that the TortoiseLyre was placed in the sky near Hercules for the alleviation of his toil. The Alfonsine illustration is of a Turtle, Galapago in the original Spanish, which Caesius turned into the indefinite Belua aquatioa, and La Lande into Km and Ku■culu■, some marine creature, not the little rodent. Other names were Teat&, the creature's Upper Shell; and Pupilla, which, by a roundabout process of continued blundering explained by Ideler, was derived from Testa, or, as seems more likely, from Aquila. Bayer's B,foa11oi; is probably a mistranslation of Testa that also signified a Test. Smyth said that another Te■tudo was at one time proposed as a constellation title for some of the outside stars of Cetus, between the latter's tail and the cord of Pisces. When the influence of Greek astronomy made itself felt in Arabia, many of the foregoing designations, or adaptations thereof, became current; among them Bablon, from Na{Jla, or llablium, the Phoenician Harp; Al Luri, which degenerated into Allore, Alloure, Alohore, Alchoro, etc., found

in the Alfonsine Ta/Jles and other bygone lists; 8halfi4 and BulalJ.fit, words for the Tortoise, Ulug Beg's translator having the former as Bhelylk, which Piazzi repeated in his catalogue; Saliba~, which heads Kazwini's chapter on the Lyre;- Ideler tracing these Arabic words to XiA-v,;. They were turned into Anlafe and Zuliaoa in the original Alfonsine Ta/Jks, and Schaliafin Chilmead's Treatise. The A Images/ of 151 5 combines all these figures for Lyra's stars in its A/lore: el est Vultur cadens: el est 1esludo; while that of 1551 says Lyn.a Teatudo.
But, notwithstanding the singularly diverse conceptions as to its character, the name generally has been Lyra, and the figure so shown. Roman coins still in existence bear it thus, as does one from Delos, Apollo's birthplace in the Cyclades; and Cilician money had this same design with the head of Aratos on the obverse. The Leyden Manuscript h~ the conventional instrument, with side bars of splendid horns issuing from the tortoise-shell base; the Venetian Hyginus of 1488, with a similar figure, calls it Lun. as well as Lyra; but the drawing of Hevelius shows "an instrument which neither in ancient nor in modem times ever had existence." Diirer's illustration, as well as others, places it with the base towards the north. Lyra is on the western edge of the Milky Way, next to Hercules, with the neck of Cygnus on the east, and contains 48 stars according to Argelander, 69 according to Heis. Its location is noted as one of the various regions of concentration of stars with banded spectra, Secchi's 3d type, showing a stage of development probably in advance of that of our sun. From near its "• 5° southwest of Wega, radiate the swiftly moving Lyraidl, the meteors which are at their maximum of appearance on the 19th and 20th of April, but visible in lesser degree from the 5th of that month to the 10th of May. These have been identified as followers of the comet I of 1861.

Wega, less correctly Vega, originated in the Aljonsine Ta/Jles from the Wa~i' of the Arabs, Bayer having both titles; Scaliger, Waghi; Riccioli, Vuega vel Vagieh; and Assemani, Veka.
The Greeks called it Avpa, which, in the 16th-century Almagests and Ta/Jles, was turned into Allore, Alahore, and Alohore.

the Almagest of 1551 as Fulrms quae in Its/a est & vocatur Lyra: and in Flamsteed's Ttstajulgida dicta Lyra; but Cicero also used Pidia specially for the star, as did Columella and Pliny Fidel and Pidioula, its preeminent brightness fully accounting for the usurpation of so many of its constellation's titles, indeed undoubtedly originating them. In Holland's translation of Pliny it is the Harp-star. The Romans made much of it, for the beginning of their autumn was indicated by its morning setting. It was this star that, when the hour of its rising was alluded to, called forth Cicero's remark," Yes, if the edict allows it,"-a contemptuous reference to Caesar's arbitrary, yet sensible, interforence with the course of ancient time in the reformation of the calendar, an interference that occasioned as much dissatisfaction in his day as did Pope Gregory's reform 1 in the 16th century. Sayce identifies Wega, in Babylonian astronomy, with Di1gan, the Messenger of Light, a name also applied to other stars ; and Brown writes of it:
At one time Vegn was the Pole-star called in Akkndian TiNIDJI& (" Life of Heaven"), and in Assyrian Da:,u.-u.me (" Judge of Henven "), ns having the highest seat therein;
but fourteen millenniums have passed since Wega occupied that position l The Chinese included it with e and { in their Chih lien, the Spinning Damsel, or the Weaving Sister, at one end of the Magpies' Bridge over the Milky Way,-Aquila, their Cow Herdsman, being at the other; but the story, although a popular one not only in China, but also in Korea and Japan, is told with many variations, parts of Cygnus s~metimes being introduced. These same three stars were the 20th nakshatra, Abhijit, Victorious, the most northern of these stellar divisions and far out of the moon's path, but apparently utilized to bring in this splendid object; or, as Mueller says, because it was of specially good omen, for under its influence the gods had vanquished the Asuras; these last being the Hindu divinities of evil, similar to the Titans of Greece. It was the doubtful one of that country's lunar stations, included in some, but omitted in others of their lists in all ages of their astronomy, and entirely different from the corresponding manzil and situ, which lay in Capricorn. The Hindus figured it as a

The cry of the populace was •Give us back our fortnight,' for they supposed they had been robbed of eleven days."

Triangle, or as the three-cornered nut of the aquatic plant Cringata, Wega marking its junction with the adjoining c;ravana. Hewitt says that in Egypt it was Ia'at, the Vulture-star, when it marked the pole,- this was r 2000 to 11000 B. c. (!),- and Lockyer, that it was the orientation point of some of the temples at Denderah long antecedent to the time when ,· Draconis and a Ursae Majoris were so used,- probably 7000 B. c.,- one of the oldest dates claimed by him in connection with Egyptian temple worship. Owing to precession, it will be the Polaris of about 11500 years hence, by far the brightest in the whole circle of successive pole-stars, and then 43⁄4: from the exact point, as it was about 14300 years ago. In 188o it was 51° 20' distant. Professor Lewis Boss and Herr Stumpe place near it the Apex of the Sun's Way. Picard failed in his efforts to obtain its parallax in the 17th century, but Struve thought that he had succeeded in this by his observations pmious to 1840; still much discrepancy exists in the recent determinations. Elkin, in 1892, gave it as o".092; or, to put it in popular language, if the distanc, from the earth to the sun be regarded as one foot, that from Wega would be 158 miles. The 10th-magnitude companion, about 48" away, used for some of these determinations, is entirely independent of it, although difficult to be seen owing to the great brilliancy of Wega. At least two other still fainter companions also have been found. This was the first star submitted to the camera, by the daguerreotJpe process, at the Har.vard Observatory on the 17th of July, 1850. It lies on the western edge of the constellation figure, and, after Sirius, is the most prominent of the stars showing spectra of the Sirian type: yet, with all its splendor, affords but 1⁄2 of the latter's light Still it is supposed to be enormously larger than our sun, and proportionately very much hotter. It is moving toward our system at the rate of about 9}~ miles a second, and makes " the nearest approach in the northern hemisphere to an independently blue star"; while its flashing brilliancy justifies its being called the Arc-light of the sky. Miss Mitchell strangely called it ' pale yellow. Wega rises at sunset far toward the north on the 1st of May, and, being ' visible at some hour of every clear night throughout the year, is an easy and favorite object of observation. It culminates on the 12th of August. With E and { it formed one of the Arabs' several Athiflyy, this one being "of the people," \\<hile the others, fainter, in Aries, Draco, Musca, a0tl Orion, were "of the astronomers" ; for sky objects are often very plain to them that are invisible to the ordinary observer.

Sheliak, BhelJak, and Shiliak are from Al Shil~ one of the Arabian names for Lyra. The star lies about 8° southeast from Wega and 2_1⁄2 0 west from y. With 6 and , it was Tsan Tae in China. The changes in its brilliancy, detected by Goodricke in 1784, were fully investigated by Argelander from 1840 to 1859, and showed a regularly in
creasing period of variability which now is 12 days, 21 3⁄4' hours, with several fluctuations of a somewhat complex nature. Like y Cassiopeiae and other variables of the Sirian type, it shows in its spectrum,- perhaps the best specimen of Pickering's 4th class,- not only the usual dark lines, but also the bright lines of glowing gases, hydrogen and helium being especially conspicuous. Pickering concluded, from the singular character and behavior in the shifting of these lines, that the chief star must consist of at least two luminous bodies rotating around a common centre of gravity at a very great rate of speed, perhaps three hundred miles a second, the period ofrevolution equaling the period ofvariability. Scheiner says of it," There is great probability that more than two bodies are concerned in the case of 13 Lyrae ''; and yet it may not be impossible, in view of the recent discoveries at the Johns Hopkins Laboratory, that variations of pressure may be concerned in this remarkable shifting of lines.I

2_1⁄2 0 east of /3 is Sulafat, from another of the titles of the whole constellation. J'ugum, formerly seen for it, may have come from a misunderstanding of Bayer's text, where it probably is used merely to designate the star's position on the frame of the Lyre, his words being ad dextrum cornu, Zvy6v, Iugum, - a fair example of the indefiniteness of much of his stellar nomenclature. At a point ,1⁄2 of the distance from f3 to y is the wonderful Ring llebula, ~- G.

These are the celebrated Double Double, each pair probably separately revohing in a period of over two hundred years, and both pairs perhaps revolving around their common centre of gravity; but if so, the period ii. to be reckoned only by millenniums, for the measures of the last fifty year; show no sensible orbital motion. This is by far the finest object of the kind in all the heavens. They are 20711 apart, and, to the ordinary eye, form an elongated star; but exceptionally sharp sight will resolve them without aid. The pairs are 3".2 and 2 11.45 apart respectively, and a good 21⁄4'-inch glass with a power of 140 will separate each pair. The position angle of the components of e1 is 12·0; and of those of £9, 132°; while that of e1 ' and e1 is 173°. Their "double-double" character was first published by the Jesuit father Chmtian Mayer in 1779, although its discovery has generally been attributed to Sir William Herschel. The distance between e1 and e1, small as it is, is nearly twice that notice<! by astronomers, in 1846,- 128" -between the actual and the computed positions of the planet Uranus, a discrepancy which convinced them of the existence of a still more remote planet and led to the discovery of Neptune. Such is the marvelous nicety of modern astronomical measurements! Between these stars lie three very much fainter, two of which, of the 13th magnitude, are the Debiliuima, Excessively Minute, of Sir John Herschel, discovered by him in 1823. E and { form an equilateral triangle with Wega, the sides about 2° long: E being at the northern angle. These three stars were one of the Athi1111 of the early Arabs. 1/, a 4.4-magnitude, is Alad.far in the Century Atlas, by some confusion with the star μ,; and with 8, of the same brilliancy, was, in China, Lien Taou, Paths within the Palace Grounds. ,,, of the 5th magnitude, was Kazwini's Al A~rar, the Talons (of'thr Falling Eagle), which he described as a fainter star in front of the bright one, i.e. west of Wega.

one of Bode's constellations of 1800, lies south of the central portion of Cetus. With him it was the Elektrisir M:achine and M:achine Eleotrique; the Italians call it M:achina Elettrica. It is now generally omitted from the maps and catalogues.

(llticroscopium,
formed by La Caille south of Capricornus and west of Piscis Australis, although small and unimportant, contains sixty-nine stars, varying in magnitude from 4.8 to 7, the ludda being 01. The constellation comes to the meridian in September, nearly due south of {3 Aquarii. In its vicinity, perhaps including it, was an early figure referred to, in a German astronomical work of 1564 from Frankfiirt,as lleper, the Auger, Ideler's Bohrer, which he thus described:
It is situated at the tail of Sagittarius and Capricornus, and has many stars. At the head of the Neper two, and on the iron three.
Brown alludes to it as an unknown object, and illustrates it in the 47th volume of Archaeologia as from a German astronomical manuscript of the 15th century; but Flammarion, in /es Etoiles, probably referring to this same manuscript, thus mentions Neper, as the predecessor of Monoceros :

lengthwise from the Belt of Orion to the tail of the animal, just below the head of Hydra. Proctor assigned to it the alternative title Cervu. Its 4.6-magnitude S, or Fl. 15, marks the head of the figure, facing towards the west. This is a modem constellation, generally supposed to have been first charted by Bartschius as Unicomu; but Olbers and Ideler say that it was of much earlier formation, the latter quoting allusions to it, in the work of r 564, as "the other Horse south of the Twins and the Crab"; and Scaliger found it on a Persian sphere. Flammarion's identification of it with the still earlier Neper has alread~· been mentioned under Microscopium. Monoceros seems to have no star individually named, but the Chin~ asterisms Bu Fib, the Four Great Canals; Kwan Kew; and Wae Choo, the Outer Kitchen, all lay within its boundaries. It contains 66 naked-eye stars according to Argelander,- Reis says 112,- and is interesting chiefly from its many telescopic clusters, and as being located in the Milky Way. It comes to the meridian in February, due south from Procyon. a, the lucida, is Fl. 30, of 3.6 magnitude.

The Germans know it as the Berg J(enal.111; and the Italians, as•• Landseer has a striking representation of the Husbandman, as he styles Bootes, with sickle and staff, standing on this constellation figure. A passible explanation of its origin may be found in what Hewitt writes in bis Essap un the Ruling Raus ufPrehisluric Times:

La Caille, who did so much for our knowledge of the southern heavens, formed the figure from stars under the Greater Cloud, between the poles of the equator and the ecliptic, just north of the polar Octans; the title being suggested by the fact that the Table Mountain, back of Cape Town, "which had witnessed his nightly vigils and daily toils," also was frequently capped by a cloud. Gould found in the constellation 44 naked-eye stars, the brightest being of 5.3 magnitude; but within its .borders is a portion of the Nubecula Major.
the French Kouohe Autrale ou Inclienne, the German Sidliohe Pliege, and the Italian K01oa A:utrale, lies partly in the Milky Way, south of the Cross, and east of the Chamaeleon. This title generally is supposed to have been substituted by La Caille, about 1752, for Bayer's Apia, the Bee; but Halley, in 1679, had called it KlUOII Apia i and even previous to him, Riccioli catalogued it as Apia seu K1110L Even in our day the idea of a Bee prevails, for Stieler's Planisplzere of 1872 has Biene, and an alternative title in France is Abeille, The modern Chinese translate Bayer's title as J(eih Pung, and have so known it since the 16th century. Julius Schiller united it with the Bird of Paradise and the Chamaeleon as mother Bve. Gould assigned to it 75 stars, of magnitudes from 2.9 to 7; these culminating, with the Cross, about the middle of May.



Star-Names and their Meanings
the small group of 31⁄2- to 5th-magnitude stars over the back of the Ram, is the Italian KOICIL, the French Kouohe, and the German !'liege. Houzeau attributed its formation to Habrecht, but others to Bartschius, who called it Ve11pa, the Wasp, although also Apia, the Bee; and, still further changing the figure, wrote that it represented Beel-sebul, the god of flies, the Phoenician Baal-zebub; this insect being the ideograph of thlt heathen divinity, varied at times by the Scarabaeus. La Lande's !pea probably is a typographical error. To whom we owe its present title I cannot learn; but it is thus given in the Flamsteed .Atl11s of 1781. The constellation has been retained in some popular astronomical works, although not figured by the scientific Argelander, Heis, nor Klein, nor recognized in the British Association Catalogue.
Ptolemy included its stars in the five dμ6pcpwrot of his Kp,or, the Ram. Its chief components, FI. 41, 33, 35, and 39 of Aries, were common to
the 28th nakshatra, Barani, Bearer, or Apha Barani,- Yama, the ruler of the spirit world, being the presiding divinity; Fl. 35 being the junction star towards the 11akshatra Xrittiki. They also formed the sku Oei or Wei,
anciently Vij ; and the manzil Butain, But as these Chinese and Arabic titles, signifying Belly, i.e. of the Ram, do not coincide with the present location of the stars, we may infer a change from the earlier drawings of Aries. Al Tizini's ll'i'ir al Bu\ain, the Bright One of the Little Belly, probably was 41, a 3.6-magnitude. These same stars,,, being added, were the Persian lunar station Pilh Pama, the Sogdian Barv, the Khorasmian Fa· rankhand, the Forerunners, and the Coptic Xoleon, the Belly, or Scabbard. Flamsteed's 41, 35, and 39 formed another of the Arabs' AthiflYJ, Musca comes to the meridian on the 17th of December. Instead of the Fly, Royer figured here, in 1679, the Lily, le Lil orle Fleur de Lil, with the French coat of arms, but this has entirely passed out of the books and maps.

originally was composed of some unformed stars of Ara and Lupus, within the branches of the Milky Way, just north of Apus; but later it became the Southern Triangle of Theodor and Bayer. According to Ideler, it was altered by La Caille to its present form, and associated with a Pair of Compasses, the constellation Circinus, next to it on the north, adjoining the fore feet of the Centaur. Modern astronomers, however, call it simply Norma, and locate it as an entirely distinct constellation to the north of and adjoining the Triangle. It is sometimes given as Quadra Euolidia, Euclid's Square, not Quadrant as it often is incorrectly translated. The French edition of Flamsteed's Atlas of 1776 has it as Jiiveau, the Level; and Houzeau cites Libella of the same meaning; but in France it now is l'Bquerre et la BJlgle; in Italy, Riga e Squaclra; and in Germany, Lineal or Winkelmau.
Norma contains 64 naked-eye stars, from 4.6 to 7th magnitudes, but none seem to be named. They culminate about the 4th of July, their northern limit 15° south from the star Antares, and so are visible only in low latitudes. La Caille's a Normae lies within the present limits of our Scorpio. In Norma appeared in 1893 a 7th-magnitude n(JVa detected by Mrs. Margaret Fleming on a photograph taken on the 1st of July at the Harvard Observatory's station near Arequipa, although it never was visually observed. Special interest attaches to it from the identity of its spectrum with that of the nova Aurigae of the preceding year, the first two of their kind discovered. The appearance o( two new stars at such a short interval is also noticeable, as Miss Clerke says that only about eighteen had been recorded since the days of Hipparchos; Professor Young reducing this to eleven as certainly known down to 1892 ; but observers have greatly increased in recent years, the heavens are better known than formerly, and the camera 19•

were the Cape Cloude of the earliest navigators, being the prominent heavenly objects seen as they neared the Cape of Good Hope; but after Magellan became noted and fully described them, they took and have retained his name. The Latin word is the diminutive of 11ubes, and literally signifies "the Little Clouds." Miss Mitchell alluded to them as the Magellan Patohee; and Smyth, as the Sa.ob of CoaJa of English navigators; but the latter term generally has been applied to the darkly vacant spaces in the Milky Way near the Northern and the Southern Cross, and to one near the Robur Carolinum. Although Bayer seems to have been the first to figure them, they were thus mentioned by Peter Martyr in Eden's .Decades.

Together they serve to show the location of the pole, marking two angles of a nearly equilateral triangle, of which the polar point is the third.

It lies in the constellations Dorado and Mons Mensae, 20° from the south pole, covering an irregular space in the sky of about forty-two square degrees; but the intensity of its light is inferior to that of the Lesser Cloud and is obliterated by the full moon. According to Flammarion, it contains 291 distinct nebulae, 46 clusters, and 582 stars. Al Sufi mentioned it as Al Bakr, the White Ox, of the southern Arabs, and invisible from Baghdad, or northern Arabia, but visible from the parallel of the Strait of Babd aI Mandab, in 12° 15' of north latitude. Ideler translated this as the 0:s.en of Tehama,-Tehama being a province on the Red Sea; this title probably includes the companion cloud. Julius Schiller combined it with Dorado and Piscis Volans in his biblical figure Abel the J'1111t.

It is the French Octant, the German Oktant, and the Italian Ottante. The French edition of Flamsteed's Atlas has it as l'Ootan.l RH.uion. Gould assigns to it 88 naked-eye stars down to the 7th magnitude; the brightest, v, being only of 3.8; but the constellation is noteworthy as
marking the south pole, its 5.8-magnitude a being about 3⁄4'. of a degree away. A straight line from a Crucis to {j Hydri almost touches the pole at 1⁄4 of the distance from the latter star. Ancient references to a south pole are of course infrequent; Ovid, however, makes Phoebus allude to it in his instructions to Phaethon; Vergil mentions it as in our motto; Creech thus renders from Manilius:
the lower pole resemblance bears To this a/m,e, and shines with equal Stars;
and Pliny tells us that the Hindus had given it a name, Dramua,
Austrinum Polum Indi Dramasa vocant.
The heathen Arabs, too, seem to have had some knowledge of it, for they imagined that, like its northern counterpart, it exercised a healing power on all afflicted persons who would attentively observe it.

which probably refers to the same thing, but which his translator Aubertin claims as an allusion to the Coal-nck, or Soot-bag. Vespucci, on the other hand, strangely stated, in his Lettera of 1505, that "the stars of the pole of the south . . . are numerous, and much larger and more brilliant than those of our pole"; and that he saw in the southern sky about twenty stars as bright as Venus and Jupiter. Ideler's comment on Vespucci, in this connection, is " the greater part of his news is of this reliable character I" Even now it is the popular opinion that the South is richer in stars than is the North; Tennyson expressing this in Loeksley Hall:

It stretches from just east of the head of Hercules to Scorpio, partly in the Milky Way, divided nearly equally by the celestial equator; but, although always shown with the Serpent, the catalogues have its stars entirely distinct from the latter. The classical Hyginus, however, united the two figures into a single constellation, and some early nations, especially the Sogdians and Khorasmians, did the same, the stars being intermingled in their nomenclature.



Star-Names and their Meanings
The original title, 'Otptoiixor, appeared in the earliest Greek astronomy; μoyep6r, " toiling," being an adjectival appellation in the Phainomena. Transliterated as in our title it was best known to the Latins, but also as Ophiulchu, OphiulO'lll, Ophiultu, and, in the diminutive, OphiuauJ:u and Ophiuloul111; while the classical word plainly shows itself in the Meichu, Afeichiu, and Alpheiohi111 of the 16th and 1'7th centuries. Serpentarius first appeared with the scholiast on Germanicus, while Serpentiger, Serpentia Lator, Serpentia Prulel, and Serpentinariu are 3ttn for it; as also the Anguifer of Columella, which was Anguigar elsewhere. Cicero and Manilius h.ad the peculiar Anguiteneu. Golius insisted thal this sky figure represents a Serpent-charmer, one of the Psylli of Libya, noted for their skill in curing the bites of poisonous serpents; and this would seem to be confirmed by the constellation's title le P11lle in Schjeilerup's edition of Al Sufi's work. But the Serpent-holder generally was identified with'Ao-11:Af/1T10f,1Alclepi01, or A.eloulapiu, whom King James I clescribed as " a mediciner after made a god," with whose worship serpents were always associated as symbols oi prudence, renovation, wisdom, and the power of discovering healing-herbs. Educated by his father Apollo, or by the Centaur Chiron, Aesculapius was the earliest of his profession and the ship's surgeon of the Argo. When the famous voyage was over he became so skilled in practice that he even rtstored the dead to life, among these being Hippolytus, of whom King James wrote:
Hippolyte. After his members were drawin in sunder by foure hones, Esculapius a: Neptun's request glewed them together and revived him.
But several such successful operations and numerous remarkable cures. and especially the attempt to revive the dead Orion, led Pluto, who feared for the continuance of his kingdom, to induce Jove to strike Aesculapius with a thunderbolt and put him among the constellations. The figure also was associated with Caeoiu, the Blinding One, slain by Hercules and celebrated by Dante in the I11jern1J; indeed, it is said that the
l According to Greek tradition, he was a Lineal ancestor of the great physician Hippocnues; and Doctor Francis Adams, in his Gm•uu if.'orb of Hifll(Krales, writes:

This list, from the Cliiliads of Tzetzes of our Hth century, makes Hippocrates the 15th in descent from Aesculapius through his son Podalirius, who, with his brother Machaon, ns an army surgeon, as well as a valiant fighter before the walls of Troy. The name and the profession were continued in the Asclepiadae, an order of prieil-phy~cians long noted in Greece.

Hero himself was assigned to these stars by Hyginus, and gave them his name: a confusion that may have arisen because the boundaries between the two stellar groups were at first ill defined, or from the similarity of their original myths to that of Izhdubar and the dragon Tia.mat. It also represented Triopu, king of the Perrhaebians; Carnabon, Carnabu, and Camabu, the slayer of Triopas; Phorbu, his Thessalian son, who freed Rhodes from snakes; Caclmu changed to a serpent; J'uon pursuing the goldenfteeced Aries; Aeaaou, from the story of Hesperia; Ariltaeu, from the story of Eurydice; Laooo6n struggling with the serpent; and Caeliu, or GlauGlll, the sea-god, although this latter title, identified by some with that of Anclropu, may have come from that namesake who was restored to life by Aesculapius. The Arabians translated the Greek name into Al ]Jawwi', which Assemani repeated as Alhava, Coltec/or serpmlum; but it appeared on the globes as Al Jlaur, turned by the Moors into Al Hague, and by early astronomical writers into Alangue, Hualangue, and Alange; the Turks having the similar Yilange. It has been suggested, however, that these may have come from the Latin Anguis, a word that the astronomical Arabians and Moors well knew. Euphratean astronomers knew it, or a part of it with Serpens, as B'u• taiMla; and Brown associates it with Sa•gi•mu, the God of Invocation. Pliny said that these stars were dangerous to mankind, occasioning much mortality by poisoning; while Milton compared Satan to the burning comet that "fires" this constellation,- a comparison perhaps suggested by the fact that noticeable comets appeared here in the years 1495, 1523, 1537, and 1569, which might well have been known to Milton, for Lord Bacon wrote in his Astronomy:
Comets have more than once appeared in our time ; first in Cassiopeia, and again in Ophiuchus.
Novidius changed the figure to that of Saint Paul with the J(altele Viper; Caesius gave it as Aaron, whose staff became a serpent, or as KOHi, who lifted up the Brazen Serpent in the Wilderness; but Julius Schiller, far more appropriately, made of it Saint Benedict in the midst of the thorns, for it was this founder of the order of the Benedictine monks who, with his followers in the 6th century, inspired and carried on all the learning of the times, as Aesculapius-Ophiuchus had done in his day. The constellation generally has been shown as an elderly man, probably copied from the celebrated statue at Epidaurus; but the Leyden Manuscript and the planisphere of the monk Geruvigus represent it as an unclad boy

standing on the Scorpion and holding the Serpent in his hands; and the Hyginus of 1488 has a somewhat similar representation. Bayer added to his titles for Ophiuchus Grua aut Ciaonia &rjmli '""' inscriptione, Elltagt1e, insistms, which he said was from the Moors, but Ideler asserted was from a drawing of a Crane, or Stork, on a Turkish planisphere instead of the customary figure; and the AlrMgest of 1551 alludes to Ciconia as if it were a well-known title. All this, perhaps, may be traced to ancient India, whose mythology was largely astronomical, and the Adjutant-bird, Ciconia argala, prominent in worship as typifying the moon-god Soma, so that its devotees would only be following custom in locating it among the stars. Although this is not one of the zodiac twelve, Mr. Royal Hill writes:
Out of the twenty-five days, from the 2rst of November to the 16th of December, which the sun spends in passing from Libra to Sapttariu.r, only nine are spent in the Srtn11iw. the other sixteen being occupied in passing through Opl,iud,u.r.
Thus, according to his idea of the boundaries, this actually is more of a zodiacal constellation than is the Scorpion. But the boundaries are ,·er)' variously given by uranographers. Argelander enumerates in it 73 naked-eye stars, and Heis 113. It was in Ophiuchus that appeared, A. D. 123, the second 11ova of which we have reliable record, the first having been that of Hipparchos, 134 B. c., in Scorpio. At least three other such have appeared in Ophiuchus: one in 1230; another, the so-called Kepler'• Star, discovered by Kepler's pupil Brunowski, on the 10th of October, 1604, in the eastern foot near 9, which gave Galileo opportunity for his "onslaught upon the Aristotelian axiom of the incorruptibility of the heavens"; and a third; discovered on the z8th of April, 1848, by Hind as of the 4th magnitude, and still visible as of the 11th or 12th. Citing Firmicus as authority, La Lande wrote:

been variously altered into Bu Alhagu, Ru Alhaglll, Ruala.nge, Ru al
Hangue, Ban1sngue, Ru Alaghue, Baaalhagh, Alhague, and Alangue. The occasional Azalange has been traced to the Turkish title for the constellation; but " a universal star-name from that nation does not seem probable," and it is more likely that the Turks adopted and altered the Arabic. Ru al llayro also has been seen for the star; and the Century Cyclopedia mentions llawwa as rarely used. Kazwini cited Al Ra'i, the Shepherd, from the early Arabs, which, although now a title for y Cephei, may have come here from the adjacent Raugah, or Pasture; the near-by a Herculis, 6° to the west, being Kalb al Ra'i, the Shepherd's Dog; while neighboring stars, the present Club of Hercules, marked the Flock. In China a was How, the Duke; and the small surrounding stars, Hwan Chay, a title duplicated at those in the hand. Its spectrum is Sirian, and the star is receding from us about twelve miles a second. It culminates on the 28th of July.

Cebalrai, Celbalrai, and Cheleb are from Kalb al Bi'i. "The Heart of the Shepherd," which Brown gives as the meaning of his Celabrai, is erroneous, doubtless from confusion of the Arabic ~alb, Heart, and Kalb, Dog. The star is 9° southeast of a, and 5° west of Taurus Poniatovii, the Polish Bull, now included in Ophiuchus.

The component stars are of 4. 1 and 6. 1 magnitudes, yellow and purple in color, their distance varying from 111.7 to 611.7; in 1898 it was 211.05, and the position angle 280°. Its parallax, 011.16, indicates a distance of twenty light years, and certain irregularities in motion show that there may be an invisible companion.

celestial equator entirely south of the ecliptic, and so is visible from every part of the globe. With Theban Greeks of Corinna's time, about the year 490 before our era, it was 'Oapiwv, the initial letter having taken the place of the ancient
digamma, f, which, pronounced somewhat like the letter W, rendered the early word akin to our Warrior. Corinna's pupil Pindar followed in 'Uap,wve,or, but by the time of Euripides the present 'Dplwv prevailed, and we see it thus in Polymestor's words in the 'E,cdfJ'I of 425 B. c.:

Catullus transcribed Oarion from Pindar, shortened to Arion, and somt'• times changed to A.orion; but the much later Argion, attributed to Firmicus, was for Procyon, probably from 'Apyc,r, the faithful dog of Ulixes. The derivation of the word has been in doubt, but Brown refers it to the Akkadian Uru-a.nna,1 the Light of Heaven, originally applied to the sun, as Uru-ki, the Light of Earth, was to the moon; so that our title may ha,·e come into Greek mythology and astronomy from the Euphrates. The Ovplov, Ovpov, or 'Tpiwv of the Hyriean, or Byrsaean, story, the Urion of the original Alfonsine Tables, graphically explained by Minsheu, is in no sense an acceptable title, although H yginus and Ovid vouched for it, thus
showing its currency in their day. Caesius' derivation from •upa, as ii marking the Seasons, seems fanciful. At one time it was 'AAeTpo;rodiov, found in the Uranologia of Petavius of the 16th century, which Ideler said should be 'AAenpolflidiov, Cock's Fool, likening the constellation to a Strutting Cock ; but Brown goes back to 'AA1/, Roaming, and so reads it 'AA7/Tporr6diov, the Foot-turning Wanderer, mythologically recorded as roaming in his blindness till miraculously restored to sight by viewing the rising sun. The Boeotians, according to Strabo, fellow-countrymen of the earthly Orion, called his stars Kavddwv, their alternative title for•AP'lr, the god ofwar. well agreeing with, perhaps originating, the Greek conception of the Warrior. Ovid said that the constellation was Comeeque Bootae; and some authors asserted that Orion never set, an idea possibly coming from the early confusion in name with Bootes already alluded to; although even as to that constellation the assertion would not have been strictly correct. Matthew Arnold similarly wrote in his Soltrab and Rustum:
1 This divinity was the later Chaldaeo--Assyrian sun-god Dumu-zi, the Son of Life, or Tam• muz, widely known in classical times as Adonis. Aries also represented him in the uy.

·rhoIDpson sees in this alternate rising and setting of these two sky figures an astronomic explanation of the symbolism in classic ornithology of the mutual pursuit and flight of Haliaetos and Keiris, the Sea Eagle and Kingfisher, compared in the poem Ciris to these opposed constellations. In Horace's Odes the constellation is termedpronus; and Tennyson had

which, with the rest of the beautiful opening passage, adds much to the charm of his I.ocksky Hall.
Homer, who made but a single allusion in the Iliad to this constellation, followed by a parallel passage in the Odyssey, wrote of" the might of huge Orion," and described the earthly hero as the" Illustrious Orion, the tallest and most beautiful ofmen,-even than the Aloidae," adjectives all well applied to our stellar figure; Hesiod said:
\Vhen strong Orion chaces· to the deep the Virgin stars;
Pindar, that he was of monstrous size; as did Manilius in his Magna pars ,na.:rinia coe/i; and nearly all authors, as well as illustrators, have thus described Orion, and as an armed warrior. In the 'E"a/311 we read:

these last a very liberal translation of the much quoted ar111atumque aure. But later on in the voyage, when the fleet was off Capreae, the old pilot, in his astronomical enthusiasm dum sidera servat, lost his balance, and tumbled overboard. The constellation's stormy character appeared in early Hindu, and perhaps even in earlier Euphratean days, and is seen everywhere among classical writers with allusions to its direful influence. Vergil tenned it IVJIIOM, nimbosus, and saevus; Ho~ace, Iris/is and naulis infeslus; Pliny, lwrridtJS sitleribus; and the Latin sailors had a favorite saying, Fa/Iii st14is1iN 11aulas Orion. Polybios, the Greek historian of the second century before Christ, attributed the loss of the Roman squadron in the first Punic war to its having sailed just after "the rising of Orion"; Hesiod long before wrott of this same rising : then the winds war aloud, And veil the ocean with a sable cloud: Then round the bark, already haul'd on shore, Lay stones, to fix her when the tempests roar;
and Milton, in Paradise Lost:
when with fierce winds Orion arm'd Hath vex'd the Red-sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew Busiris and his Memphian chivalry.
Many classical authors variously alluded to it as a calendar sign, for its morning rising indicated the beginning of summer, when, as we find in the Works and DaJ•s, the husbandman was instructed to
Forget not, when Orion first appear~, To make your servants thresh the sacred ears;
his midnight rising marked the season of grape-gathering; and his evening appearance the approach of winter and its attendant storms: an opinion that prevailed as late as the 17th century, for in the Geneva .Bible, famil-. iarly known as the .Brudies .Bible, the marginal readin·g in the Book ofJob, xxxviii, 31, is" which starre bringeth in winter." Plautus, Varro, anti others called the constellation Jugula and Jugulae, the Joined, referring to the umeri, the two bright stars in the shoulders, as if connected by thej11g11lum, or collar-bone. Such, at least, is the generally received derivation, but Buttmann claimed it as fromjugulare, and hence the Slayer, a fitting ride for the Warrior. The Syrians knew it as Gabbiri.; the Arabians, as .Al labbir, both signify· ing "the Giant," riya~ with Ptolemy,- and in Latin days occasionally Gigui

the Arabian word gradually being turned into Algebra, Algeba.ro, and, especially in poetry, Algebar, which Chilmead gave as Algibbar. In early Arabia Orion was AlJauzah, a word also used for stars in Gemini, and much, but not very satisfactorily, discussed as to its derivation and meaning in its stellar connection. It is often translated Giant, but erroneously, for it, at first, had no personal signification. Originally it was the term used for a black sheep with a white spot on the middle of the body, and thus may have become the designation for the middle figure of the heavens, which from its preeminent brilliancy always has been a centre of attraction. Some think that the Belt stars, d, e, {, known to the Arabs as the Golden :l'utl, first bore the name Jauzah, either from another meaning of that word,- Walnut,- or because they lay in the centre of the splendid quadrangle formed by a, {3, y, and "; or from their position on the equator, the great central circle; the title subsequently passing to the whole figure. Grotius adopted the first of these derivations, quoting from Festus the passage quasi nrajug/ans, that a lesser light, Robert Hues, thus enlarged upon:
Sow Geu•e signifieth a Wall-nut; and perhaps they allude herein to the Latine word Jugula, by which name Festus calleth Orion ; because he is greater than any of the other Constellations, as a Wall-nut is bigger then any other kinde of nut.
In mediaeval as well as in later astronomy, the original appears in degenerate forms, such as Blgeue, Geuze, Jeuze, and the Geuzuguar of Grotius. Al Sufi's story of the feminine Jauzah has been noticed at the star Canopus and under Canis Minor. Hyde quoted from an Arabian astronomer, Al Babidur, the Strong One, as a popular term for the constellation. Sugia and Alugia were thought by Scaliger to be corruptions of the Arabs' Al Shuji', the Snake, applied to Orion in the sense of Auda.x, Bellator and Bellatrh:, Fortia and Forti.uim111, Furio1u and Sublimatu, and all proper names for it in Bayer's and other early astronomical works, Chilmead translating Asugia as "the Madman." Similar titles at one time obtained for Hydra. Al Firuzabadi'!..Al :l'uq may be equivalent to the Nasalc, a Line, or Row, applied to th'e'·Belt stars, but there signifying a String of Pearls. Kiphla, attributed to Chaldaea, has not been confirmed by modem scholars. In Egypt, as everywhere, Orion was of course prominlmt, especially so in the square zodiac of Denderah, as Horu in a boat surmounted by stars, followed by Sirius, shown as a cow, also in a boat; and nearly three thousand years previously had been sculptured on the walls of the recently discovered step-temple of Sa~\cara, and in the great Ramesseum of Thebes about 3285 B. c. as Sahu.

A similar title, but of Akkad origin, appeared for Capricomus. Egyptian mythology laid to rest in this constellation the soul of Omia, as it did in the star Sirius that of Isis; and, again, in the Book of the Dead we read:
The Osiris N is the constellation Orion ;
in this connection, Orion was known as Smati-Oliril, the Barley God. The Giant generally has been represented with back turned toward us and face in profile, armed with club, or sword, and protected by his shield. or, as Longfellow wrote,
on his arm the lion's hide Scatters across the midnight air The golden radiance of its hair.
Diirer drew him facing the Bull, whose attack he is warding off; but the Leyden Manuscript has a lightly clad youth with a short, curved staff in the right hand, and the Hare in the background.
The head is marked by 1.., t/)1, and q,2, the stars a and y pointing out the shoulders, {3 and" the left foot and right knee. But Sir John Herschel observed from southern latitudes that the inverted view of the constellation well represents a human figure; the stars that we imagine the shoulders appearing for the knees, Rigel forming the head, and Cursa of Eridanus, one of the shoulders. In astrology the constellation was Hyreidea, Bayer's Hyriaclea, from Ovid's allusion to it as Ryriea prolee, thus recalling the fabled origin from the bull's hide still marked out in the sky. This, formerly depicted as a shield of rawhide, is now figured as a lion's skin; and it perhaps was this Hyriean story that gave the stellar Orion the astrological reputation, recorded by Thomas Hood, of being "the verie cutthrote of cattle"; at all events, it certainly gave rise to the Tpf:rraTpor and Tripater, applied to him. 8aturnu1 has been another title, but its connection here I cannot learn. 1 although I hazard the guess that as this divinity was the sun-god of the Phoenicians, his name might naturally be used for Uruanna-Orion, the sungod of the Akkadians. Anterior to much of this, we find in the various versions of the lJOfJl of Job and Amos the word Orion for the original Hebrew word J[Elil, literally signifying " Foolish," " Impious," " Inconstant," or "Self-confident.''



The Constellations
This perhaps is etymologically connected with Kislev, the name for the ninth month of the Hebrew calendar, the tempestuous November-December. Julius Fiirst considered this Xillev an early title for Orion. The epithet ·•Inconstant" has fancifully been referred to the storms usual at his rising. The Krsilim of Isaiah xiii, 10, rendered "constellations" in some versions, is also thought to refer to it and other prominent sky figures; in fact, Cheyne translates the word as " the Orions " in the Polychrome .Bible; while Ba.hab, in the Revised Version of the .Book of Job, ix, 13,- the "proud helpers" in the Authorized,- is referred by Ewald, Renan, and others to this,- possibly to some other group of stars,- with the same significations as those of Krsil, or perhaps " Arrogance," " Rebellion," " Strength," or '' Violence." Later on the Jews called Orion Gibbor, the Giant, considered as Bimrod bound to the sky for rebellion against Jehovah, whence perhaps came the Bands, or Bonds, of Orion, which some say should be Cords, or a Girdle; but the conception of Nimrod as" the mighty Hunter before the Lord," at least in the ordinary sense of that word, is erroneous, for the original, according to universal Eastern tradition, signifies a Lurking Enemy, or a Hunter of men rather than of beasts. This idea may have led to a Latin title, Vent.tor, for the stellar Orion. But, relative to the renderings of biblical words supposed to refer to sky groups, the Reverend Doctor Adam Clarke wrote in his Co1n111enlary
that 'Aish has been generally understood to signify the Great Bear; Kesil Orion; and Kimah the Pleiades, may be seen everywhere; but that they do signify these conste)Ja. tions is perfectly uncertain. \Ve have only conjectures concerning their meaning.
As to the Hebre"· words, they might as well have been applied to any of the other con <tellations of heaven; indeed, it does not appear that constellations at a\l 11re meant.
The discordance between the various renderings would indicate the probable correctness of these comments, and that we are in no respect assured as to the identification of Bible star-names. Yet it is worth noting that the three constellations adopted by the translators of the .Book of Job and of Amos in the Revised Version fitly represent the cardinal points of the sky~ the Bear in the north, Orion in the south, and the Pleiades rising and setting in the east and west. In the Hindu Brah111a11as Orion is personified as Praja•piti,t under the form of a stag, Kriga, in pursuit of his own daughter, the beautiful roe Rohini, our Aldebaran. In his unnatural chase he was transfixed by the

three-jointed arrow - the Belt stars- shot by the avenging Hunter, Sirius, which even now is seen sticking in his body. This hero was the father of twenty-seven daughters, the wives of King Soma, the Moon, with whom the latter equally divided his time, thus referring to the nakshalras. The Chinese made up their 4th sin, from the seven conspicuous stars in the shoulders, belt, and knees of Orion, with the title Shen, or TAD, Three Side by Side, anciently Sal, which may have originated from the Belt hav- 1 ing at first alone formed the sieu. Indeed, the lunar asterism was men- ' tioned in the She King as the Three Stan. d was its determinant; but it overlapped the corresponding nakshalra, although entirely distinct from the 4th mansil in the feet of the Twins. Orion was worshiped in China during the thousand years before our era as Shen, or Shi Oh'en, from the moon station ; but it also was known as the White Tiger, a title taken from the adjacent Taurus. The Khorasmians adopted Orion's stars as a figure of their zodiac in place of Gemini. The early Irish called it Caomai, the Armed King; the Norsemen, Orwandil; and the Old Saxons, Bbu6rung, or Bbiaring,- words that Grimm thought connected with Iringe, or Iuwaring, of the Milky Way. Caesius cited the singular title llagulon, perhaps from Al Rijl, the Arabic designation for the star {3, but he made this the equivalent of the Latin Vu, the Man par excellence, the Hero; and suggested that Orion represented .Jaoob wrestling with the angel; or J'oehua, the Hebrew warrior; but Julius Schiller, that it was Saint .Joaeph, the husband of the Blessed Virgin. Weigel figured it as the Roman Two-headed Eagle; and De Rheita, of I 643, found somewhere among its stars Christ's Seamleu Coat and a Chalice; but he was addicted to such discoveries. Argelander has 115 stars here; Heis, 136; and Gould, 186; while the whole is as rich in wonderful telescopic objects as it is glorious to the casual observer. Flammarion calls it the California of the sky.

Sayce and Bosanquet identify a with the Euphratean Gula, other stars possibly being included under this title; and Brown says that Xakbb Sar, the Constellation of the King, or Un.gal, refers to a with 'Y and i. We can see in this signification the origin of the astrologer's idea that Betelgeuze portended fortune, martial honors, wealth, and other kingly attributes. a alone constituted the 4th nallShalra, Ardri, Moist, depicted as a Gem, with Rudra, the storm-god, for its presiding divinity, and so, perhaps, the origin of the long established stormy character of Orion, This lunar station, therefore, formed but a part of the 4th sieu, and differed entirely from the 4th mansil. Individually the star was the Sanskrit Bihu, Arm, probably from the Hindu conception of the whole figure as a running Stag, or Antelope, of which a, (3, y, and ,c marked the legs and feet, with a on the left forearm; the adjacent Sirius being the hunter Mrigavyadha. Brown mentions its equivalent Persian title, Bem, the Arm, and the
Coptic K1aria, an Armlet. Bayer quoted yi11v.:a from Aratos, but it is not in the original; and Chrysococca had "Dμor d,dvμ.o>V, the Shoulder of-i.e. next to-the Twins. Among the many queerly worded descriptions in the 1515 Almagest, perhaps none is more so than that of this star, reading in part thus: ipsa ltndit ad rapinam quae appropi"'luat ad lerram. This tmdit ad rnpinam, also used for the star Antares, apparently has been an unsolved puzzle ; and as I have never seen any explanation, my own suggestion may not be amiss. The 1515 Almagest followed Ulug Beg's Tables, and these followed Ptolemy, who characterized the color of a as imatctppor, which Ulug Beg's translator turned into rubtdinem, "ruddiness," and the Almagest into the not very different word of the quotation, expressing ideas of war and carnage, astrology's attributes of red stars. The appropifl'IUQI ad lerram doubtless refers to the comparatively low elevation of the star above the horizon. Professor Young says that at times, when near a minimum, it closely matches Aldebaran in color and brightness, and Lassen described it as a rich topaz. Secchi makes it the typical star of his third class with a banded spectrum, suggesting that it may be approaching the point of extinction. Elkin finds its parallax insensible; according to Vogel, it is receding from the earth at the rate of 101⁄2 miles a second.

It was first seen to be variable by Sir John Herschel in 1836, from which time till 1840 "its variations were most marked and striking." A similar period began in 1849, and on the 5th of December, 1852, "it was actually the largest star in the northern hemisphere." It was especially brilliant in 1/1⁄24, Argelander found a period of 196 days, but Schoenfeld thought periodicity questionable. Its position is less than 3° west of the solstitial colure; it rises at sunset on the 30th of December, and culminates on the 29th of January. It has an 8th-magnitude companion 20' away, first observed by Wilhelm Stru,·e as double, 1811.5 apart, and the great glasses of the present day reveal other members in the combination still nearer and smaller than the original companion; while Barnard has discovered about it large and diffused nebulosity.
~' Double, 0.3 and 8, both bluish white.
.Algebar and Elgebar are seen in poetry for this star, but it universally i~ known as Rigel, from Bijl_ Jauzah al Yu11ri:, the Left Leg of the Jauzah. by which extended title the Arabians knew it after the word Jauzah ha<l become a personal title; the modern name first appearing in the Aljonsint Tables of 152 I. These say of it, in connection with Eridanus:
Lucida que est in pede sinistro: et est communis ei et aquae: et dicitur Algebar nominatur etiam Rigel.
Riccioli had Regel; Schickard, Jliglon; and Chilmead, Rigel Algeule, or .Algibbar.
Al Sufi gave the earlier popular name lli'i al Jauah, the Herds
man of the Jauzah, whose camels were the stars a, y, &, and K; and Al 1'ajid, the Conqueror, which also was given to a and y. Chrysococca termed it IJoi•r dlduμw1•, the Foot of-i.e. next to-the Twins; and Bayer, the Hebrew KeBil, of the constellation. Smyth wrote that
independent of the •• nautis infeslus Orio,i" character of the constellation, Rigel bad one of his own; for it was to .the astronomical rising of this "marin,u aster," in March, th~t St. Marinus and St. Aster owe their births in the Romish calendar.
He gave, however, no explanation of this, and these saints certainly are not familiar in any stellar connection. Possibly its ••marine" character came from its location at the end of the River, and from its being given in the various editions of the Syntaxis and in the Alfonsine Tables as common

to both constellations ; although the supposed stormy character of the whole group in affecting navigation may have induced the epithet for Orion's greatest star. Astrologers said that splendor and honors fell to the lot of those who were born under it. · In the Norsemen's astronomy Rigel marked one of the great toes of 0rwandil, the other toe having been broken off by the god Thor when frost-bitten, and thrown to the northern sky, where it became the little Alcor of the Greater Bear. Although lettered below Betelgeuze, it is usually superior to it in brightness, being estimated in the Haroard Photometry as exactly equal to Arcturus, Capella, and Wega. Its spectrum is like that of Sirius, and it is receding from our system about Io1⁄4 miles a second. The smaller star, at a position angle of 200°, is 9".1 away, but not easily seen owing to the brightness of the principal. It is strongly suspected that this smaller star itself is closely double. Another minute companion is 44".5 away.
j, Slightly variable, 2, pale yellow.
Bellatrix, the Female Warrior, the Amazon Star, is from the translation, rather freely made in the Aljonsine Tables, of its Arabic title, Al Najid, the Conqueror. Kazwini had this last, but Ulug Beg said Al 11:urzim al N'ajid, the Roaring Conqueror, or, according to Hyde, the Conquering Lion heralding his presence by his roar, as if this star were announcing the immediate rising of the still more brilliant Rigel, or of the whole constellation. This Murzim occasionally appears in our day as Mirzam, which is also applied to both of the stars (3 in the two Dogs as heralds of Sirius and Procyon. Al Sufi had Al Jluzam, which Hyde said was another of the very many Arabic words for the lion, but Beige! thought it also a reference to the camel, another roarer. Still it is well to remember in this connection Ideler's remark that" etymology has full play with a word which has not tra\'eled beyond astronomical Janguage,"-a statement equally applicable to very many other star-names. Caesius cited Algauza from the name for the whole.

In astrology it was the natal star of all destined to great civil or military honors, and rendered all women born under its influence lucky and loquacious; or, as old Thomas Hood said," women born under this constellation shall have mighty tongues."

AJuiJam, Anilam, Ainilam, and Alnihan are from Al llit,him, or Al lla~ the String of Pearls, or, as Recorde said, the Bullions set in the middle of Orion's Belt. It portended fleeting public honors to those born under its influence. The spectrum is Sirian, and the star recedes from us at the rate of about 16y; miles a second. It is the central one of the Belt, culminating on the 25th of January.

These Arabian titles of d, £, and {, although now applied to them individually, were at first indiscriminately used for the three together; but they had other names also,- .Al llijicl, the Belt; Al l l ~ the Line; Al ~ ; the Golden Grains, Nuts, or Spangles; and l!'~ al .Jauah, the Vertebrae in the Jauzah's back. Niebuhr cited the modem Arabic Al Elin al H ~ the Accurate Scale-beam, so distinguishing them from the curved line of the fainter,, IJ, ,, d, and"• Al Jlidn al Ba~, the False Scale-beam. The Chinese similarly knew them as a Weighing-beam, with the stars of the sword as a weight at one end. They were the .Jugula and .Jugulae of Plautus, Varro, and others in Roman literature; the Balteu, or Belt, and the Vagina, or Scabbard, of Germanicus. The Zona of Ovid may have been taken from the Zwv71 of Aristotle.
The early Hindus called them Ifu Triki11,~ the Three-jointed Anow; but the later transfened to it the nakslzalra title, J(rigl,firu. The Sogdian Buhnawand and the Khorasmian Khawiya have significations akin to our word " Rectitude," which this straight line of stars personified. The Rabbi Isaac Israel said that it was the M:auiriith, Jlaailoth, or Kulltha that most of his nation applied to the zodiac. Riccioli cited Baculu .Jacobi, which became in popular English speech luob'a Bod or 8~-the German Jakob Stab,- from the tradition given by Eusebius that Israel was an astrologer, as, indeed, he doubtless was ; and some had it Peter'• Sta.ft Similarly, it was the Norse l!'iakibllar, or Staff; the Scandinavian l!'rigge Bok, Frigg's,or Freya's, Distaff,-in West Gothland lrigge Re-JrJren, and ][aria Rok, Mary's Distaff; in Schleswig, Peri-pit. In Lapland it was altered to Kalevan )(ieJrlra, Kaleva's Sword, or still more changed to lliallar, a Tavern; while the Greenlanders had a very different figure here,- Biktut, the Seal-hunters, bewildered when lost at sea, and transfened together to the sky. The native Australians knew the stars as YOUDg M:en dancing a ,orro/Joree, the Pleiades being the Maidens playing for them; and the Poignave Indians of the Orinoco, according to Von Humboldt, as l!'uebot, a word that he said resembled the Phoenician. The University of Leipsic, in 1807, gave to the Belt and the stars in the Sword the new title llapoleon, which a retaliating Englishman offset by llellOD i but neither of these has been recognized on star-maps or -globes.

Seamen have called it the Golden Yard-arm; tradesmen, the L. or Ell, the Ell and Yard, the Yardcick, and the Yard-wand, as occupying 3° between the outer stars,-the Elwand of Gavin Douglas; Catholics, Our Lady'1 Wand; and the husbandmen of France and along the Rhine, :Utau, the Rake.

although not individually named, marks the Fish-mouth of the Great llebula, N. G. C. 1976, 42 M., in the sword scabbard of the figure, with thr celebrated Trapezium in its midst. De Quincey gave a characteristic de· scription of it in one of his Essays in Philosoph;·. This nebula, faintly visible to the naked eye, was not even mentioned hy Galileo, and is generally thought to have bet:n accidentally discovered bi Christian Huygens in 1656, and described in his Systema S11turni11m half a century after Galileo's adaptation of the principle of the telescope to a~tronomical use; but Cysatus of Lucerne had already known it in 1618. Thi, was the first 1 object to which Sir William Herschel ciirected, on the 4th l1I March, 1774, the first serviceable telescope of his own construction aftrr two hundred failures; and the first nebula to be successfully photographetf, , as it was by Professor Henry Draper, at Hastings-upon-Hudson, on the 30th of September, 1880.
I Similarly, too, it was the last object viewed by Sir William through his forty-f,..,r reflector, on the 19th of January, 18n, when the great glass was laid aside fore,·er.

Its spectrum is purely gaseous, and spectroscopic investigations ·by Sir William and Lady Huggins seem to show" a unity of composition of the (trapezium] stars and nebulae which surround them and link them together." Keeler finds from spectroscopic observations that it and our system are separating at the rate of ten miles a second. Holden thinks it of fluctuating brightness. The nebula proper covers a space equal to the apparent size of the moon, but nebulosity extends over a very much larger area, for recent observations by Swift, by William H. Pickering in 1889 from Wilson's Peak, and by Barnard with the camera on Mount Hamilton in October, 1894, reveal nebulous matter, 14° to 15° in diameter, that includes the Belt and much of the body of Orion. Barnard says of it: "Compared with this enormous nebula, the old 8, or so-called Great Nebula, is but a pigmy." A million of globes, each equal in diameter to that of the earth's orbit; would not equal this in extent. One of the Harvard photographs of 1889 showed a certain amount of spiral structure in the Great Nebula. The adjacent nebula, N. G. C. 1982, catalogued separately by Messier as 43, is shown on a photograph of the 30th of November, 18861 by Roberts, to be connected with it by threads of nebulosity. At least six stars are found in the Trapezium, the four largest being ot the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th magnitudes, easily visible in a 2}(-inch glass with a power of 140. They may form a system. Huygens noted the triplicity of 111 when he discovered the nebula; the 4th component was first seen in 1684; the 5th was" discovered by Robert Hooke in 1664, but forgotten and rediscovered by Struve in 1826"; and the 6th was first seen by Sir John Herschel, on the 13th of February, 1830. More are claimed by some recent observers, but Burnham disputes their existence. In 3.36 square degrees of the 01 nebula Bond catalogued nearly 1000 stars.

Al Tizini designated this as 1'i'ir al Saif, the Bright One in the Sword, but it is practically unnamed with us, although far more deserving of the title Saiph than is the succeeding star K. In China it was l!'a, a Middle-man, v and intermediate stars being included under this name; but Edkins translates the word "Punishment," and gives another title for it,-Tui, or J'ui, the Sharp Edge, analogous to the Arabian Saif and perhaps taken from it.

Al Xailin, the title of y Geminorum, by some error of Firuzabadi was applied to this star as Keila, and is now common for it. Al Sufi called it Al Tal}iJi ; but Al Ferghani and Al Tizini knew it as B.il al .Tauah, the Head of the Jauzah, which it marks. The original Arabic name, Al Ha¥ah, a White Spot, was from the added faint light of the smaller q,t and q,2 in the background, and has descended to usas Heb and llika. These three stars were another of the Athlfiyyofthe Arabs; and everywhere in early astrology were thought, like all similar groups, to be of unfortunate influence in human affairs. They constituted the Euphratean lunar station Xu-tab-ba•tur-tur, the Little Twins, a title also found for y and 'I Geminorum; and individually were important stars among the Babylonians, rising to them with the sun at the summer solstice, and, with a and y, were known as Kakbb Sar, the Constellation of the King. In other lunar zodiacs they were the Sogdian Xarezinl, and the Khorasmian lkhma, the Twins; the Persian A."91', the Coronet; and the Coptic KlUIOI, Watery. They also were the 3d 111ansi/, Al H~'ah; the sieu Tue, or Tn:, He, the Beak, or Pouting Lips, anciently T1ok, which Reeves gave as Keo; and the nakshatra Xrig&9iru, or J(rip· Qinhi, the Head of the Stag,- Soma, the Moon, being its presiding divinity, and l the junction star towards .Ardra, and its determinant. As to this lunar station Professor Whitney very reasonably wrote:

But they were possibly influenced by recollection of the fact that the vernal equinox lay here 4500 B. c. In addition to the customary Hindu title, Weber mentioned Andhaki, Blind, apparently from its dimness;
iryiki, Honorable, or Worthy; and Invaki, of doubtful meaning, sometimes read Invali. In China these stars were 8"1 ma tl'ien, the Head of the Tiger. Ulug Beg, as well as N~r al Din, likened the group to the letter of the Persian alphabet that was similar in form to the Greek A. La Lande wrote of them:

Hipparchos did not allude to them, but Ptolemy called them b veq,e)..oe,

Although called double, ).. has a second faint companion 149" above it, visible by a 3,1⁄2-inch glass; and another, of the 12th magnitude, 27" distant. The two largest stars are 411.2 apart, at a position angle of 40°.3. .t and the two starsphi furnish an easy refutation of the popular error as to the apparent magnitude of the moon's disc, Colas writing of this in the Celestial Handbook of 1892 :
In looking at this triangle nobody would think that the moon could be inserted in it; but as the distance from A lo -i,1 is 27', and the distance from ;1 to ;2 is 331, it is a positive fact;
the moon's mean apparent diameter being 31' 7". This illusion, prevalent in all ages, has attracted the attention of many great men; Ptolemy, Roger Bacon, Kepler, and others having treated of it. The lunar disc, seen by the naked eye of an uninstructed observer, appears, as it is frequently expressed, "about the size of a dinner-plate," but should be seen as only equal to a peppercorn, or as a circle a half-inch in diameter fifty-seven inches away; or, to write it astronomically, equal to the planet Jupiter viewed at opposition through a telescope magnifying forty diameters; or equal to Mars magnified seventy-four times when at his nearest approach to the earth and distant thirty-four millions of miles. To still better illustrate this, Professor Young tells us that the planet Venus,
when ahont midway between greatest elongation and inferior conjunction, has an apparent diameter of 40", so that, with a magnifying power of only 45, she looks exactly like the moon four days old, and of precisely the same apparent size.

all of the 4th to the 5th magnitudes, in a vertical line at the right of the figure, indicate the lion's skin; but Al Tizini said that they were the Persians' Al Tij, the Crown, or Tiara, of their kings; and the Arabians' Al Kumm, the Sleeve of the garment in which they dressed the Giant, the ski~ being omitted. Ulug Beg called them Al Dhawiib, Anything Pendent; and the Borgian globe had the same, perhaps originated it; but Al Sufi's title was Kanica, a Latin term for a protecting Gauntlet; and Grotius gave a lengthy dissertation on the Xantile which some anonymous person applied to them, figurc:<l as a cloth thrown over the Giant's arm. With Pliny these stars in the lion's skin are supposed to have been a separate constellation known as the Shield, made from the bull's hide of the H yriean legend. They were the Chinese Tian Ke, the Three Flags. T, 3.6, lies just north of Rigel, and was known in China as Yuh !mg, the Golden Well.

Thabit is Burritt's name for an unlettered star on his Atlas, the v of Heis. It lies on the lower edge of the tunic, but I cannot learn the derivation or history of the title, although the Arabic Al Thabit signifies the " Endurer.''

The title is an appropriate one for enduring stars, as this bird has long been a symbol of immortality, fancifully said to be from the annual renewing of its feathers; but this is common to all birds, and the symbolism probably is from the fact that. its starry tail rendered the peacock sacred to Juno, the immortal queen of the heavens, and thus in classical times, as in the days of chivalry, an object of adjuration. This bird was still further astronomical in originally having been Argos, the builder of the ship Argo, who was changed by Juno to a peacock when his vessel was transferred to the sky, where he has since rejoined her. In China the constellation was loo THO, their translation of our word. Julius Schiller united it with Indus in his biblical figure "B. lob." Gould catalogued 129 component stars, from the 2d to the 7th magnitudes, but none seem to be individually named, as is the case among all the new southern figures.

called thus in Germany, but P6gue in France and Peguo in Italy, lies north of the Um of Aquarius and the easternmost Fish, the stars of the Great Square inclosing the body of the Horse. Mythologically he was the son of Neptune and Medusa, sprung by his father's command from the blood of the latter which dropped into the sea after her head had been severed by Perseus ; and he was named either
from rr,,-.,ai, the Springs of the Ocean, the place ofhis birth, or from Il1fY6!.", Strong. He was snowy white in color, and the favorite of the Muses, for be bad caused to flow their fountain Pirene on Helicon,- or Hippocrene on the Acrocorinthus,-whence came one of the constellation titles, Fontil Kuaram Inventor. Longfellow prettily reproduced in modem dress this portion of the story, in his Pegasus in Pound, where " this wondrous winged steed with mane of gold," straying into a quiet country village, was put in pound; but, finding his quarters uncomfortable, made his escape, and :n

To those stars he soared again.
But they found upon the greensward Where his struggling hoofs had trod, Pure and bright a fountain flowing From the hoofmarks in the sod.
He seems, however, to have come back to earth again, for he was subsequently caught by Bellerophon at the waters of his fountain, and ridden by him when he slew the Chimaera, helping in the latter's destruction. By this time classical legend had given him wings, and Bellerophon sought by their aid to ascend to heaven; but Jupiter, incensed by his boldness, caused an insect to sting the steed, which threw his rider, and, as Wordsworth
wrote: Bold Bellerophon (so Jove decreed In wrath) fell headlong from the fields of air.
Pegasus then rose alone to his permanent place among the stars, becoming the Thundering Horse of Jove that carried the divine lightning. Ptolemy mentioned the wings as well recognized in his day; and this has. continued till ours, for the sky figure is now known as the Winged Hone,- a recurrence to Etruscan, Euphratean, and Hittite ideas, for the wings are clearly represented on a horse's figure on tablets, vases, etc., of those countries, where this constellation may have been known in pre· classical times. Indeed, it is said to have been placed in the heavens by the early Aryans to represent Asva, the Sun. Early classical mythology did not associate the Horse with Perseus, al· though artists and authors do not seem to have remembered this, for the celebrated picture by Rubens in the Berlin Gallery shows the winged Peg· asus held by a Cupid, while Perseus in full armor is unbinding Andromeda from the rocks, Cetus raging in the waters close by; and the late Lord Leighton left unfinished his Perseus on Pegasus at the cliffs of Joppa, with the Gorgoneion in his hand; while in Troilus and Cressida Shakespeare mentioned" Perseus' horse." The Greeks called the constellation simply •11r1ro,;, although Aratos added lep6,;, "divine," and Eratosthenes alluded to it as Il~yaao,;, but distinctly asserted that it was without wings, and until after middle cl~cal times it generally was so drawn, although loose plumes at the shoulders , occasionally were added. The figure was considered incomplete,a possible reason for this being given under Aries. Thus it was characterized a.s ~.ut,eA.1,; and ~μfroμo,;, "cut in two," or as if partly hidden in the clouds: while Nonnus had 'Hμtrpav71,; Ai{3u,; trrrro,;, the Half-visible Libyan Horse,

Thus the Equi Sectio used by Tycho and others for Equuleus would seem equally appropriate for this. Euripides is said to have called it Xelanippe, after a da~ghter of Chiron, also known as Euippe, changed by the goddess Artemis into a Black Mare and placed in the sky; but Bayer quoted from some later writer Kenalippe. The ee,ava, or Thea.no, of Nonnus does not seem intelligible. Translated from Greece by the Romans, it was Bquua, and later on Bquu Alea, qualified at times by the adjectives alter, major, Gorgoneus, and Medusaeus; but Isidorus and Lampridius degraded it to Bagmariu Caballu1, a Pack-horse; La Lande cited Bphippiatu, Caparisoned; and elsewhere it was Cornipee, Horn-footed; BoDipea, Noisy-footed; and BoDipea Alea. Gennanicus was apparently the first of Latin authors to style it Pegasus. In the Alfonsine Tables it was Alatu, Winged, Secundus sometimes being added to distinguish it from Equuleus, which preceded it on the sphere; the Almagest of 1551 had Bquu Peguu1, which the 17th-century astronomers extended to Peguu Bquu1 alatua. Caesius cited Peguidea, and Bayer quoted Bquu1 polterior, volan1, aereu1, and dimidiat111, Bellerophon, and Bellerophonte1.
Jewish legends made it the mighty llimrod'1 Hone; Caesius, one of those ofJeremiah iv, 13, that "are swifter than eagles"; other pious people, the Au on which Christ made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem; but Julius Schiller exalted it into the Archangel Gabriel Weigel drew it as the heraldic Liineburg Hone.
Pegasus appears on coins of Corinth from 500 to 430 B. c., and from 350 to 338 B. c., and 200 years thereafter, on the decadrackma, complete and with wings; as well as on coins of Lampsacus, Scepsis, and Carthage,on these last with the asterisk of the sun, or with the winged disc, and the hooded snakes over its back. It is also shown on a coin of Narbonne as a sectional winged figure, and as a winged horse on a Euphratean gem, with a bull's head, a crescent moon, and three stars in the field. A coin of Panormus, the modern Palermo, has the Horse's head with what was probably intended for a dorsal plume. Bochart said that the word is a compound of the Phoenician Pag, or Pega, and Siis, the Bridled Horse, used for the figurehead on a ship, which would account for the constellation being shown with only the head and fore quarters; but others have considered it of Egyptian origin, from Pag, "to cease," and Siis," a vessel," thus symbolizing the cessation of navigation at the change of the Nile flow. From this, Pegasus seems to ha\"e been regarded, in those countries at least, as the sky emblem of a ship. In the

old work the Destruetion of :Iroye, we read of" a ship built by Perseus, and named Pegasus, which was likened to a flying horse." Brugsch mentions as in its location an Egyptian constellation, the Servant; and some of its stars would seem to be shown on the Denderah planisphere as a J'aokal. The Arabs knew the familiar quadrangle as Al Dalw, the Water-bucket, the Amphora of some Latin imitator, which generally was used for the (rn in Aquarius; and the Arabian astronomers followed Ptolemy in Al Puu al '1'hinl, the Second Horse, which Bayer turned into Alpheru; Chilmead. into .&lfaru Alatbem; and La Lande, into Alphark
Argelander catalogued 108 stars here, down to the 6th magnitude; and Heis, 1781 to the 6_3⁄4. The starless region toward Pisces was Al Bin1ni's Al Baldah, the Fox's Kennel, a term for whose stellar connection I find no explanation. Before leaving this constellation, it is worth while to note that an asterism, now virtually lost to us and seldom mentioned except in the lists of Al Sufi, Al Amasch, and K.azwini, is described by the last-named under the title Al J'aru al Timm, the Complete Horse. Although somewhat indefinitely marked out, it is said to have occupied the space between the eastern wing of the Swan, the chest of Pegasus, Equuleus, and the tail of Lacerta, drawing for its components from the last three; but Beigel held that it could have existed only with the grammarians,- the Tamm in its title being easily confused, in transcription, with the Thani in the Arabians' name for Peg• asus. Ideler's Sternnamen is the sole modem work in which I find any reference to this Complete Horse, and even that author, in one passage, seems to regard Monoceros as the modern representative of this somewhat mythical constellation; but this is impossible if K.azwini's description be accepted. Indeed, Ideler himself, later on in his book, changed his opinion to agree with that of Beigel.

lh.rbb - Flamsteed's Xarchab- is the Arabs' word for a Saddle, Ship, or Vehicle,- anything ridden upon,- that was early applied to this star; but they also designated it as Xatn al J'aru, the Horse's Withers or Shoulder, and Bayer cited Yed Alpheru, the Horse's Hand, or, morr properly, Forearm,- the Arabian Yad. Kazwini knew it and /3 as Al 'Arp· wab, the Cross-bar of the well in which Al Dalw, the Bucket, was used. In India it was noted as the junction star of the Bhadra-pada ndsltaJras, detailed under /3.

In China it was Shih, a title borrowed from the sieu that it marked. Brown thinks that, with y and {, it was the Euphratean asterism Likb&r-ra, the Hyaena,-perhaps Ur-bu-ra. Among astrologers it portended danger to life from cuts, or stabs, and fire. It culminates on the 3d of November, and when on the meridian forms, with y, the southern side of the Great Square, {3 and <f forming the northern, and all 15° to 18° apart.

This is the Bch•t of Tycho, the Palermo Catalogue, and modem lists generally, either from Al Bi'id, the Upper Part of the Arm, or, as Hyde suggested, from the early Ba'd, appearing in the subsequent three pairs of stars. Bayer had S.t Alpheru; Chilmead, S.t Alfaru; Riccioli, Bch•t Alpheru; and Schickard, Baidol-pharui.
Arabian astronomers knew it as Xankib al Faras, the Horse's Shoulder, mentioned by Ulug Beg and still occasionally seen as Xenkib. Chilmead had AJmenkeb.
The Great Square, of which {3 formed one comer, constituted the double asterism, the 24th and 25th naluhatras, Pina, Former, and Uttara, Latter, Bhid:ra-padi, Beautiful, Auspicious, or Happy Feet, sometimes also called Prollhtha-padi, .Proshll,a meaning a Carp or Ox; but Professor Whitney translated it " Footstool Feet," and said that the authorities do not agree as to the figures by which they are represented, for by some the one, by others the other, is called a Couch or Bed, the alternate one, in either case, being pronounced a Bifaced Figure, or Twins. This Couch is a not inapt representation of the group if both asterisrns are taken together, the four stars well marking the feet. Weber calls them Pratiah~ a Stand or Support, as Whitney wrote,
an evident allusion to the disposition of the four bright stars which compose it, like the four feet or a stand, table, bedstead, or the like;
the regents of these nakshatras being Aja Ekapat, the One-footed Goat, and Ahi Budhya, the Bottom Snake, " two mythical figures, of obscure significance, from the Vedic Pantheon." The 24th mansil, formed by a and (1, was Al Fargh al • ~ the Fore Spout, i.e. of the water-bucket,-Al

Biriini's Al Fargh al Awwal, the First, or the Upper, Spout; and the 24th sieu was these same stars known as Ying She, or Shih, a House, anciently Sal and Shat; but it also comprised parts of Aquarius and Capricornus. They also were the Persian Vaht, the Sogdian and Khorasmian :ranhat
Bath, and the Coptic Artulo1, all signifying something pertaining to Water;
while in astrology /3 indicated danger to mankind from that element. Within the area of this Square Argelander counted only about 30 naked-eye stars, but in the clearer sky of Athens Schmidt saw 102. It was in the 24th situ that the Chinese record a conjunction of the planets Mercury, Mars,Jupiter, and Saturn, on the 28th of February, 2449 B. c., according to Bailly's computations; but we sometimes see this state• ment made as to five planets, Venus being added, and as having taken place on the 29th of February, that year being bissextile. Smyth indefinitely mentions this conjunction as at some point between II Arietis and tht Pleiades; Flammarion states that it was in Capricorn ; and Steele alludes to it as of 2246 B. c., and 'between the tenth and eighteenth degrees of Pisces. At that date the signs and constellations were about coincident.
The variability of /3 was discovered by Schmidt in 1847, and Argelander found a period of forty-one days; but Schoenfeld thinks that irregular oscillations, in a period of thirty to fifty days, are more probable. The spectrum of Scheat is of the third type of Secchi's classification, which includes the red and orange stars and most of the variables: "a Orionis, 11 Herculis, Antares, and o Ceti (Mira) are good examples." The star is receding from us about four miles a second.

It has some• times been written Algemo. Al Biriini quoted it, with d (a Andromedae),as Al Fargh al Thini, the Second, or Lower, Spout, i. t. of the Bucket. This also is the title of the 25th manzil, but appears in Professor Whitney's list as Al Fargh al Xu'liir, the Rear Spout, and in Smyth's as Al Farga. Chrysococca called it II~yaao~ from the constellation. Reeves said that it is the Chinese Peih, a Wall or Partition, thus taking the title of the 25th sieu, which it marked and, with d, constituted. It lies at the junction of the 11akshatras Bha.drapada. and Revati; and, with d, was included in the corresponding lunar station of several other nations.

Bayer quoted from "the interpreters of the Almagest" Grumium and Kuoida, respectively Jaw and Muzzle, so describing its position; but these have become proper names for~ Draconis and rr Ursae Majoris. Flamsteed knew it as 01 Pegaai With 8, and the star a, Aquarii, it was the 23d sieu, Goei, or Wei, Steep or Danger, anciently Gui. Enif's spectrum is Solar, and it is receding from us about five miles a second. Gould thinks it probably variable.

Minerva as a mirror, that he might not be petrified by Medusa's glance,cut off her head, which he then utilized in the rescue ofAndromeda. Some one has written about this:
In the mirror of his polished shield Reftected, saw Medusa slumbers take, And not one serpent by good chance awake ; Then backward an unerring blow he sped, And from her body lopped at once her head,
Aratos characterized the stellar hero as "stirring up a dust in heaven," either from the fact that his feet are in the celestial road, the Milky Way, or from the haste with which he is going to the rescue of Andromeda; and Manilius, describing his place in the sky, wrote:
Her Perseus joyns, her Foot his Shoulder bears Proud of the weight, and mixes with her Stars.
His story probably was well known in Greece anterior to the 5th century B. c., for Euripides and Sophocles each wrote a drama based on Andromeda's history; and with them, as with the subsequent Greeks, he was Iltpati~, a word that may be derived from the Hebrew Pa.rash, a Horseman, although Ctesias, in his ITtpau,d of about 400 B. c., had Panondu as a stellar name from Babylonia that may be this. Parui~ current in late Indian astronomy, is only another form of the Greek original. •17r..,r6.-11r, the Horseman, and Profugu, the Flying One, also are titles for these stars. Classical poets called it Pinnipea, referring to the ta/aria; Cylleniu, the Hero having been aided by Mercury; Abantiadel and Aorilioniadel, from his grandfather and father; lnaohidea, from a still earlier ancestor, the fust king of Argos; and Deferena oaput Algol, Victor Gorgonei monmi, Oorgonifer, Gorgoni■ue, and Deferena e&thenam, from the association of Perseus with Medusa and the chain of Andromeda. Alove probably came, by some error in transcription, from Al Ghiil, more correctly applied to the star {3; while Benhawi■h, Fena111, and Siauh are plainly the Arabi:ms' orthography of the Greek title, the letter P not being
found in their alphabet. They, however, commonly called it ~imil Bi·• al Ghtil, the Bearer of the Demon's Head, which became A1mirugual in Moorish Spain, and was translated from Ulug Beg as Portan■ e&put Jame, the same being still seen in the German Trager de■ Xedu■en Kopf.

La Lande identified the figure with the Egyptian Khem, and with Ethru of Persia, Herodotus having asserted that Perseus, through his and Andromeda's son Perses, gave name to that country and lier people, who previously were the Chephenes, as descended from Chepheus, the son of Belus, identified by some with the Cepheus of the sky. The kings of Cappadocia and of Pontus, similarly descended, represented the Hero on their coins. Caaodaemon was the astrologers' name for this constellation, with special reference to Algol as marking the demon's head; while Schickard, Novidius, and the biblical school generally said that it was David with the head
or Goliath; but others of the same kind made of it the Apoatle Paul with hil Sword and Book. Mrs. Jameson thought that the legend of Perseus and Cetus was the foundation of that of Saint George and the Dragon, one version making this saint to have been born at Lydda, only nine miles from Joppa, the scene of Perseus' exploit. The constellation is 28° in length,- one of the most extended in the heavens,- stretching from the upraised hand of Cassiopeia nearly to the Pleiades,and well justifying the epithet 1rep,μ~uTo!;, "very tall," applied to it by Aratos. It offers a field of especial interest to possessors of small telescopes, while even an opera-glass reveals much that is worthy of observation. Argelander gives a list of 81 naked-eye stars, and Heis 136. The former has suggested that within its boundaries may lie the possible central point of the universe, which Madler located in the Pleiades and Maxwell Hall in Pisces,- all probably unwarranted conclusions.

But this may indicate a different representation of Perseus in their day,- a suspicion stengthened by the nomenclature of others of his stars, especially of { and o. Assemani alluded to a title on the Borgian globe,-Kughammid, or Kullammir, al Thurayya, the Concealer of the Pleiades,-which, from its loca

Algol, the Demon, the Demon Star, and the Blinking Demon, from the Ara
bians' B.i'1 al Ghfil, the Demon's Head, is said to have been thus called from its rapid and wonderful variations; but I find no evidence of this, and that people probably took the title from Ptolemy. Al Ghiil literally signifies a Mischief-maker, and the name still appears in the Ghoul of the Arabian Nights and of our day. It degenerated into the Alove often used some centuries ago for this star. Ptolemy catalogued it as TWll i:v yopyovlw b Afll'Trpor, "the bright one of those in the Gorgon's head," which Al Tizini followed in his ft'ir, for, with 1r, p, and w, it made up that well-known group, itself being the GorgODM. prima ; the ropyov,ov of Chrysococca, Gorgoneum Oaput ofVitruvius, Caput Gorgonil of Hyginus, and the Gorgonil Ora of Manilius.
With astronomical writers of three centuries ago Algol was Caput Larvae, the Spectre's Head. Hipparchos and Pliny made a separate constellation of the Gorgon stars as the Head of Ked111&, this descending almost to our own day, although always connected with Perseus. The Hebrews knew Algol as B&h ha Biti,D, Satan's Head, Chilmead's Bolch hauatan, the Divela head; but also as Lllith, Adam's legendary first wife, 1 the nocturnal vampyre from the lower world that reappeared in the demonology of the Middle Ages as the witch Lilis, one of the characl~ in Goethe's Walpurgis Nachl.

Astrologers of course said that it was the most unfortunate, violent, and dangerous star in the heavens, and it certainly has been one of the best observed, as the most noteworthy variable in the northern sky. It" continues sensibly constant at 2.3 magnitude during 23⁄4 days, then decreases, at first gradually, and afterward with increasing rapidity, to 3,5 magnitude"; its light oscillations occupying about nine hours; its total period being stated as 2 days 20 hours 48 minutes 55 seconds. Al Sufi, a good observer for his day, yet strangely making no allusion to its variability, called it a 2dmagnitude; and the phenomenon was first scientifically noted by Montanari during several years preceding 1672. This was confirmed by Maraldi's observations of 1694, and, later, by those of the Saxon farmer Palitsch,1 but its approximate period seems to have been first announced by Goodricke in 1782, who even then advanced the theory ofa dark companion revolving around it with immense velocity, which periodically cut off its light. This, reaffirmed by Pickering in 1880, was made certain by the spectroscope in the hands of Vogel of Potsdam in 1889. Chandler thinks that there must exist another invisible body larger than either Algol or its companion, around which both revolve in a period of 130 years; but Tisserand has shown that the phenomenon on which Chandler bases this opinion can be explained in a different and simpler way, Its name is used for the type indicating short-period variables whose changes may be explained by this theory of "eclipses." Of these seventeen are now known. Although classed among the white stars with a Sirian spectrum, Al Sufi wrote of it as red, which Schmidt confirmed as seen by him at Athens for a short time in 1841, It seems to be approaching us at the rate of about a mile a second ; and is estimated as a little more than a million miles in diameter.

marking the tip of the weapon in Perseus' hand, bears many titles with Bayer, all referring to its location; but none of these-indeed, no name at all- is seen in modem lists. Bayer wrote of them:
In fake adamanthini trium praecedens. Falx dicitur & curvus Harpes, Gladias falcatus, & incurvus, Arab. Nembus, Maroni Ensis falcatus, & curvus Saturni dens.
The "Arab." would seem erroneous, for Bemb111 is neither Arabic nor Latin, and if intended for Nimbus, is equally wrong, as there is no sus• picion of nebulosity about the star. Curvus Saturni dens was Vergil's designation in the Georgics for a "pruning-hook," and the equivalent of Faix and •Aprr'I, so well known in connection with Perseus. X, a multiple star, and the little I, mark two clusters noticeable with the naked eye.

who, as a rule, devoted much attention to clusters as harmful objects which portended accidents to sight and blindness. In China they were Foo Shay. These stars and clusters are now known as the Sword Hand of Peneu1,

Between x and 11 lies the diverging point of the Peneidl, the prominent meteor stream visible from the 19th of July to the 17th of August, its maximum occurring about the 10th of the latter month and continuing several days. These appear in the early part of the night, at an elevation of from fifty-six to seventy miles, moving with moderate speed and leaving streaks of yellow light; the radiant advancing nearly 30° eastward during their period of visibility. Schiaparelli found their orbit coincident with that of Tuttle's comet, III of 1862. The Perseids were recorded as far back as Sn, seven appearances being mentioned down to 841 1 and they are supposed to have been members of the solar system for thousands of years, although now, perhaps, steadily decreasing in number. Dante may have made reference to them in the .Purgalorio :
Vapors enkindled saw I ne'er so swiftly At early nightfall cleave the air serene, Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August;
and in the later Middle Ages they were known as the Larmet de Saint Laurent, Saint Laurenoe'1 1 Teare, his martyrdom upon the red-hot gridiron having taken place on the 10th of August, 258. w, of the 5th magnitude, was Gorgonea qnarta.

Others changed the figure to that of a Gritln, or Eagle, so that the introduction of a Phoenix into modem astronomy was, in a measure, by adoption rather than by invention. But, whether Bayer knew it or not, his title is an appropriate one, for with various early nations-at all events, in China, Egypt, India, and Persia - this bird has been "an astronomical symbol of cyclic period," some versions of the well-known fable making its life coincident with the Great Year of the ancients beginning at noon of the day when the sun entered among the stars of Aries; and, in Egypt, with the Sothic Period "·hen the sun and Sirius rose together on the 20th of July. Thompson further write; of this:
A new Phoenix-period is said to have commenced A. D. 139, in the 1·eign of Antonina, Pius ; and a recrudescence of astronomical symbolism associated therewith is manifested on the coins of that Emperor.
Coincidently, Ptolemy adopted as the epoch of his catalogue the year 138. the first of Antoninus. With the Egyptians, who knew this bird as Bennu and showed it on their coins, it was an emblem of immortality; indeed it generally has been such in pagan as well as in Christian times. In China the constellation was Ho B'•ou, the Fire Bird, showing its derivation there from the Jesuits. Julius Schiller combined it with Grus in his Aaron the High Pried. Gould catalogues 139 naked-eye stars here, from 2.4 to 7.

r521 had P81C81, and the Almagest of 1515 Eohiguen, Bayer's Iohiguen, a word that has defied commentators unless Caesius has explained it as being a corruption of Iohthuea. The figures are widely separated in the sky, the northeastern one lying just south of /3 Andromedae, headed towards it, and the southwestern one east from and headed towards Aquarius and Pegasus, the lucida marking the knot of the connecting bands. Both are north of the ecliptic, the first culminating on the 28th of November, and the second about three weeks earlier. In early days they were shown close together, one above the other, but in reversed directions, although united as now. By reason of precession this constellation is now the first of the zodiac, but entirely within its boundaries lies the sign Aries; the vernal equinox being located in a comparatively starless region south of w in the tail of the southwestern Fish, and about 2° west of "a line from a Andromedae through 'Y Pegasi continued as far again." This equinoctial point is known as the First of Aries, and the Greenwich of the Sky; and from their containing it, the Fishes are called the Leaden of the Celelltial Hoat.
The Greeks knew them as 'Ix0ve and 'IxOver, in the dual and plural; the Romans as we do, often designating them as Imbrifer Duo Pisces,
Gemini Piaoee, and Piloia Gemellua, Classic authors said Aquiloniua, sometimes Aquilonaril; and very appropriately, for the Aquilo of the Romans, perhaps derived from aqua, or aquilus, signified a rain-bringing wind from the north, and well represented the supposed watery character of the constellation, as also its northerly position. Ampelius, however, ascribed Aquilo to Gemini, and Eurus, or Vulturous, the Southeast Wind, to Pisces. Miss Clerke thinks that the dual form of this constellation recalls the additional morlth which every six years was inserted into the Babylonian calendar of 360 days; and Sayce, agreeing in this opinion, translates the early title for these stars as the Filhe1 of Kea or Ia. It has also been found on Euphratean remains as lfu.ni, the Fishes, a supposed equivalent of its other title, Zib, of the later Graeco-Babylonian astronomy; although this last word may mean" Boundary" as being at the end of the zodiac. Another signification is the Water, which we have already seen with Aratos for this part of the sky; this also is the meaning of the word A.ti, the Aztecs' name for Pisces. It was the Babylonian lflinu, the Syriac lfiino, the Persian J[ablk, and
the Turkish Balik, all translated " Fish "; while Kircher cited, from Coptic Egypt, n,"oTwp,wv, .Rscis Hori, which Brown translates " Protection," but claims for a Coptic lunar asterism formed by (3 and 'Y Arietis. In earliest Chinese astronomy, with Aquarius, Capricomus, and a part of :za

Sagittarius, it was the northern one of the four quarters of the zodiac, the Dark Warrior, or the residence of the Dark, or llorthern, Emperor; but later, in their zodiac of twelve figures, it was the Pig, Tl81l Tue; and, after the Jesuits, Shwang Yu, the Two Fishes. With the Arabians it was Al flarnakah, Chilmead's .Allemoha,- or, in the dual, Al Sarnakatain; and Al Hit, the Fish, referring to the southern one, the Vernal Fillh, as marking that equinox; the northern being confounded with Andromeda's stars and so not associated with the zodiac. From these came Sam.eh, Haut, Bl Haut, and Elhautine in Bayer's Uranomdria. Dante combined the two in his Celelte Luca, the Celestial Roach or Mullet, saying that here and in Aquarius geomancers saw their Fortuna Major; and thus described I Peaoi :
quivering are the Fishes on the horizon, And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies.
This was on a Saturday morning, and the positions of the constellations indicate that the time was just before sunrise in the month of April; Caun:s. or Corus, the Northwest Wind, symbolizing that quarter of the heavens. Varaha Mihira mentioned the constellation as Ittha, in which the Greek word appears; but before his day it was Ant&, J'itu, and Jlina or Kinam in the Tamil dialect. The 26th naksltatra, B.evati, Abundant or Wealthy, lay here in the thirtytwo stars from t; northwards, figured as a Dram or Tabor. But the mansil. Baμt al Ji[iit, the Fish's Belly, or Al B.iahi', the Cord, and the com· sponding sieu, Xoei, or Xwei, Striding Legs, were formed by sixteen stars in a figure 8 from 1/J Piscium to v Andromedae, and mainly lay in this constellation, although {j and t; in Andromeda seem to have been their determinant points. All of these stations, however, may have been even more extended, for there certainly is " a perplexing disagreement in detail among the three systems." Al Biriini asserted that "the name of the sign in all languages signifies only one fish," and it is probable that the original asterism was such, for.
according to Eratosthenes, it symbolized the great Syrian goddess Derb or Derketo, and so, later, was named Dea Syria, Dereu, Dercetia, Dereete, ProlH Deroia, and Phaoetis. The Greeks called this 'ATdP')'aT1r; 1 and from a supposed derivation of this word from Adir and Dag (Great and Fish) it was drawn with a woman's head upon a huge fish's body. In this manner it was connected with the Syrian Digon and the Jews' Dapfm, their

title for the Two Fishes,- Riccioli's Dagiotbo. Avienus called the constellation Bombycii Hierapolitani; Grotius correcting the error in orthography to Bambyoii, as Derke was worshiped at Bambyce,- the Mabog of Mesopotamia, or Hierapolis,- on the borders of Syria. Thus, too, it was Dii Byrii.
But the Greeks confounded this divinity with another Syrian goddess, Astarte, identified with 'Ar/Jpodfr-q (Venus), who precipitated herself, with her son "Epw~ (Cupid), into the Euphrates when frightened by the attack of the monster Typhon; these becoming two fishes that afterwards were placed in the zodiac. Latin classical authors, with the same groundwork of the story, made Pisces the fishes that carried Venus and her boy out of danger, so that, as Manilius said,
Venus ow'd her Safety to their Shape.
The constellation was thus known as Venu et Cupido, Venu Syria cum Cupidine, Ven111 cum A.done, Dione, and Veneris Kater; and it has been 'Ovpavia and Urania, the Sarmatian Aphrodite. All this, perhaps, was the foundation of the Syrians' idea that fish were divine, so that they abstained from them as an article of food ; Ovid repeating this in the Fasti, in Gower's rendering: Hence Syrians hate to eat th'at kind of fishes; Nor is it fit to make their gods their dishes.
But Xenophon limited this restriction to the fish of the river Chalos. A scholiast on Aratos, commented on by Grotius, said that the " Chal
daeans" called the northernmost Fish Xt:A1d6vta~ lx9v~, shown with the head of a swallow, a representation that Scaliger attributed to the appearance of the bird in the spring, when the sun is in this region of the sky. Dupuis had much to say about this changed figure, calling it l'Hirondelle, but as of the Arabs; and this idea has led to confusion in the Piscine titles already noticed under Apus. The Greek word, however, was common for a Tunny, so that there is reason enough for its application to either of the Pisces in their normal shape. This northern Fish has sometimes been considered as representing the monster sent to devour Andromeda, and its proximity to the latter would render this more appropriate than the comparatively distant Cetus; in fact, K~To~ was as often used by the Greeks for the Tunny as it was for the Whale. Some of the Jews ascribed the joint constellation to the joint tribes of Simeon and Levi, whose sanguinary character Jacob on his death-bed so vividly portrayed; others, to Gad the Marauder. Perhaps it was from

this that Pisces was considered of such malignant influence in human affairs,-" a dull, treacherous, and phlegmatic sign "; yet this opinion. doubtless, was anterior to the patriarch's time, for the Egyptians, the instructors of the Hebrews in astrology, are said to have abstained from eating sea-fish out of dread and abhorrence; and when they would express anything odious, represented a fish in their hieroglyphics. Pliny, too, asserted that the appearance of a comet here indicated great trouble from religious differences besides war and pestilence; but this became the common reputation of comets wherever they showed themselves. In early astrology the constellation appropriately was under the care of the sea-god Neptune, and so the lfeptuni Sidua of Manilius; and it was the :Bultation of Venua, as Chaucer said in the 1tyfof Baths Tale,
In Pisces where Venus iH exnltat,
which Sir Thomas Browne, the author-physician of the 17th century, thus commented upon :
Who will not commend the wit of astrology? Venus, born out of the sea, hath her exaltation in Pisces.
Thus it naturally ruled the Euphrates, Tigris, and the Red Sea, and Parthia; but in later days was assigned to, the guardianship of Jupiter, whose Home it was, reigning over Egypt, Calabria, Galicia, Normandy, Portugal, Spain. and Ratisbon. It was predominant in influence with mariners, and had charge of the human feet; the designated color being a glistening white, as of fish just out of the water; and it was fruitful, like its namesakes. for, according to Manilius : Pi.rm fill the Flood.
Ptolemy distinguished the members of the constellation as e1r6t,ievor," the rear or eastern," and 'fJyovμ.€110,;," the front or western"; the Southern Fish being his voTiot;; a precaution rendered necessary by the frequent coo• founding of these three by classical writers. A notable instance of this is seen in the Poe/icon Astro11omicon, where our Pisces are made to receh·e
the water from the Um. In Humboldt's Cosmos they are Piloel bore&leL The constellation is popularly thought to have taken its name from its coincidence with the sun during the rainy season; and the symbol for the
sign, *, to represent the two Fishes joined; but Sayce thinks it the Hittite
determinative affix of plurality. Postellus asserted that the Fishes represented those with which Christ fed" about five thousand men, beside women and children"; and Caesius. that they were the IX0Tl; of 'l17aov,; Xp1a;6,; 0eov 'Tio,; l;wTflP, a fi.sh

always being the symbol of the early Christians' faith; but when the old twelve figures were turned into those of the apostles, these became Sa.int Katthiu, success9r to the traitor Judas. The Fishes were changed to a Dolphin in the zodiac sculptured on the wall of Merton College, taken from the armorial bearings of Fitz James, bishop of London, and warden of the college from 1482 to 1508; a dolphin being of as sacred significance among pagans as a fish was among Christians. Within their boundaries took place the three distinct conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn in the year 747 of Rome,-the year to which for a long time was assigned Christ's birth; these phenomena strikingly agreeing in some of their details with Saint Matthew's account of the Star of Bethlehem. The opinion that these appearances guided the Magi in their visit to Judaea was first advanced and advocated by the celebrated Kepler, and worked out in 1826 by Ideler, and in 1831 by Encke.1 It is noticeable that the Rabbis held the tradition, recorded by Abrabanel in the 15th century, that a similar conjunction took place in Pisces three years previous to the birth of Moses, and they anticipated another at their Messiah's advent. Thus the Fishes were considered the national constellation of the Jews, as well as a tribal symbol. Jupiter and Saturn were again together here in February, 1881, Venus being added to the group,-a well remembered and most beautiful sight. Here, too, was the seat of the predicted conjunction of three planets that Stoffler said would cause another Deluge in 1524,-an announcement that created universal consternation; but, unfortunately for the prophet's reputation, the season was unusually dry. It was in Pisces, on the 2d of September, 1804, that Harding, of Lilienthal in Hanover, discovered the minor planet Juno. In his Snepkeartl's Kalendar for November, Edmund Spenser thus described the constellation's place in the sky :
But nowe sadde Winter welked hath the day, And Phoebus, weary of his yerely taske, Vstabled hath his steedes in lowly laye, And taken up his ynne in Fishes haske.
La Lande, quoting indirectly from Firmicus, mentioned as from the Egyptian sphere of Petosiris:
au nord des Poissons, il place le Cerf, & une autre constellation du Lihre;
I More recent determinations, by the late Reverend Mr. Charles Pritchard of Oxford, have somewhat altered the previous conclusions, while our chronologists, meanwhile, have changed the date of the Nativity, so that the time-honored identification of the Star of the Magi with these planetary conjunctions now seems to be discarded. 22•

but this second Hare I cannot trace, although Bayer had Cerva as a title for Cassiopeia "north of the Fishes." There is a sprinkling of indistinct stars between the Fishes and the Whale that Vitruvius called 'EpμEd6v11, explained by Hesychios as the Stream of Faint Stars, but by some French commentator as /es dllim de Mercure, whatever that may be. Riccioli, calling it Hermidone, said that it was ejfusio Aquarii, the classical designation for the Stream from the Um; but Baldus, with Scaliger, said that the word was 'Aprm56v1J, the Cord, although this seems equally inapplicable here.

Al Beloha, or Al B.iloha, derived from the Arabians' Al B.iahi', the Cord, is 20° south from the head of Aries, 2°.7 north of the celestial equator, and marks the knot in the united cords of the Fishes; the same title being applied to {J Andromedae. This word originally may have come from the Babylonian Riksu, Cord. Hipparchos and Ptolemy designated it as Ivvde.aμo,; 'TWV 'l,tlrowv, or -:-w1• A.ivwv, the Knot of the Fishes, or of the Threads, varied by Aratos and Geminos in 11Eaμ,6,;; these words being transcribed by Germanicus and the scholiasts as 8unde1moe and Deemoe. They were rendered by Cicero and others as llod:u, llod:u ooeleetil, and llodue Piloium; by Pliny as Com· miuura Pilcium; and in the 1515 Almagest as llodue duonun :6lorum.
The Arabians translated these by 'Ujd al H•aitam, which, as Oida and Xaitain, are not unusual titles now. The uniting cords, branching from a through o, 11, 11, and p to the tail of the northernmost Fish, and through f, v, μ,I, e, (, e, and d tow that marks the tail of the one to the south, were Ptolemy's Mvov, "thread," the Mvo, ofother authors. Cicero called them Vincla, the Bonds; and the scholiast on Germanicus, Alligamentum linteum or luteum, divided by Hevelius into Linum boreum anti auetrinum. Some of these terms also were applied to the star d as marking one of the cords. The Arabians knew these cords as Al H•ait al Xattiniyy, the Flaxen Thread; and Al A~ma'i, about the year 800, mentioned them in his celebrated romance Antarah as a distinct constellation; but Pliny had done the same long before him.

but modem representations give it in a normal attitude. In either case, however, it is very unnaturally drinking the whole outflow from the Urn. This idea of the Fish drinking the Stream is an ancient one, and may have given rise to the title PilCia &qUOl1ll1 found with Ovid and in the 4th Georgie, which has commonly been referred to this constellation; Vergil mentioning it in his directions as to the time for gathering the honey harvest; but the proper application of this adjectival title is uncertain, for Professors Ridgeway and Wilkins, in their admirable article on Aslronomia in Doctor Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman A11tiquities, write:
The Piscis in question has been variously supposed to be one of the Fishes in the Zodiac - the Southern Fish-Hydra- the Dolphin -or even the Scorpion.
Smyth said that
In the early Venetian editions of Hyginus, there is a smaller fish close nnder it, rrtll4f0 fashion, interfering with the So/ilarius by which that astronomer, from its insulated position, designated Piscis Notius.
Accordingly the edition of 1488, with this representation, had it Piloel. and the German manuscript of the 15th century showed it with a still larger companion. The figure is strangely omitted from the Farnese globe, the stream from the Urn of Aquarius ending at the tail of Cetus. In early legend our auslralis was the parent of the zodiacal two, and has always been known under this specific title, varied by the other adjectives of equivalent signification, a11strinus, 111eridionalis, and notius.

which is its location in the maps of to-day, although sometimes it has marked the eye of the Fish, and formerly was still differently placed, as is noted at {3. In addition to putting it in its own constellation, Ptolemy inserted it in his 'Tcfpox6or, and Flamsteed followed him in making it his 24 of Piscis Australis and 79 of Aquarius, calling it Aquae Ultima Fomalnaut, No other star seems to have had so varied an orthography. The Aljonsine Tables of 1521 locate it in Aquarius as Fomahant and of the rst magnitude, but they describe it in Piloia Keridionalia as in ore, omitting its title and calling it a 4th-magnitude. The other editions of these Tables, and Kazwini, do not mention it at all in this constellation, but

in Aquarius; nor does Bullialdus in his edition of the Rudolplzine Tables, although in his reproduction of the Persian Tables of Chrysococca he calls it 01 PiloiJ notii and Fumahaucl. The Astronomua Danica of Longomontanus includes it in Aquarius as ullima in ejfusione Fomahant, giving no Piscis at all; Tycho's Rudolplzine Tables, in Kepler's edition of 1627, ha\·e the same, and Hevelius also puts it there as Fomahandt. Bayer cites it, in Piscis Notius, as Furnabant, Furnaba.ut reclius Furnalha.ut ; Chilmead, Phom Abut; Caesius has Forn&hand and Font&b&nt; Riccioli's names for it are Fomauth, Phomaut,Phomault, Phomant, Phornaant, Phom.but, Phomelhaut; La Caille's, Phornalha.ut; La Lande's are Furn&lhant, Fomah&ut, and Phoma· hut; and Schickard's, Fornalouti. Costard gives it as Fomahout; and Sir William Herschel had it Fornalhout, writing to his sister:
Lina,- Last night I " popt " upon a comet • . • between Fomalhoot and .J Celi.
More correctly than all these, Hyde wrote it Pham Al ~t. Burritt's At/,u has the present form Fomalhaut, but his .Planisplzere, Fornalh&Di. It generally, but wrongly, is pronounced Fornalo, as though from the French.
The Harleia11 Manuscript of Cicero's Aralos has the words Stella Canopus at the Fish's mouth, which is either an erroneous title, or another use of the word for any very bright star, as is noted under a Argus,-Canopus. Among early Arabs Fomalhaut was Al Difdi' al A.wwal, the First Frog: and in its location on the Borgian globe is the word 'fh&lim, the Ostrich, evidently another individual title. Flammarion says that it was Hutorang in Persia 3000 B. c., when near the winter solstice, and a Royal Star, one of the four Guardians of Hea\'en. sentinels watching over other stars; while about 500 B. c. it was the ol>ject of sunrise worship in the temple of Demeter at Eleusis; and still later on, with astrologers, portended eminence, fortune, and power. The Chinese knew it as Pi Lo Sze Kun. With Achernar and Canopus it made up Dante's Tre Faoelle; and sixty years ago, Boguslawski thought that it might be the Central Sun of the Universe. It lies in about 30° 15' of south declination, and so is the most southerly of all the prominent stars visible in the latitude of New York City, but it is in the zenith of Chile, the Cape of Good Hope, and South Australia. To the uninstructed observer it seems a full 1st-magnitude, perhaps from the absence of near-by stars. It culminates on the 25th of October. As one of , the so-called lunar stars it is of importance in navigation, and appears io the Ephemerides of all modern sea-going nations.

Pyzia was formed by La Caille from stars in the Mast of Argo, and so associated with the Ship, although there, of course, it is an anachronism. Baily reannexed it to Argo, since four of its members had been placed by Ptolemy where La Caille found them, so that for a time it fell into disuse; but Gould inserted it in his Uranometria Argentina of 18791 with sixty-six stars from 3.8 to 7th magnitudes.

it was first drawn by Isaak Habrecht, of Strassburg, as the B.homlru, and so probably only adopted by its reputed inventor.

This invention secured for Halley his master's degree from Oxford, in 1678, by the king's express command. But La Caille complained that the construction of the figure, from some of the finest stars in the Ship, ruined that already incomplete constellation," and the Oak ceases to flourish after half a century of possession," although Bode sought to restore it, and Burritt incorporated it into his maps, assigning to it twenty-five stars.

It has occasionally been drawn as held in the Eagle's talons, for the bird was armor-bearer to Jove; but Eratosthenes described it separately, as Aratos had done, and as it now is on our maps. The common belief that the latter included it with his Ai£T6r was based, Grotius said, on an error in the version of Germanicus. And it has been regarded as the traditional weapon that slew the eagle of Jove, or the one shot by Hercules towards the adjacent Stymphalian birds, and still lying between them, whence the title Hercule&; but Eratosthenes claimed it as the arrow with which Apollo exterminated the Cyclopes; and it sometimes was the Arrow of Cupid. The Hyginus of 1488 showed it overlying a bow; indeed, Eratosthenes called it T6fov, a Bow, signifying Arrows in its plural form; Aratos mentioned it as the Feathered Arrow and the Well-shaped Dart, the dllO!' o2aT6!; of our motto, "another arrow," in distinction from that of Sagittarius. Still, it has often been thought of as the latter's weapon strayed from its owner. Hipparchos and Ptolemy had plain 'Oi:aT6!;. Latin authors of classical times and since knew it as Canna, Calamu. and Harundo, all signifying the Reed from which the arrow-shafts were formed; and as lliaaile, Jaoulum, and Telum, the Weapon, Javelin, and Dart; Telum descending even to Kepler's day. But Sagilta was its common title with all the Romans who mentioned its stars; Cicero characterizing it as clara andfulgms, which, however, it is not. Bayer, who ascribed to it the astrological nature of Mars and Venus, picked up several strange names : Daemon, Feluoo, and Fouorium, apparently unintelligible here; Obel111, one of the aeμ.eia,, or notae, of ancient grammarians, or, possibly, an Obelisk, which it may resemble; Orfercalim, cited by Riccioli and Beige) from Albumasar for the Turkish otyayl Xalem, a Smooth Arrow; Temo meridian111, the Southern Beam; Vectil, a Pole; Virga and Virgula jacen1, a Falling Wand. The Kilaore attributed to Cicero is erroneous, and was never used by the latter as a star-name, but for the one who shot the arrow; while the ll111&tor of Aben Ezra is either a barbarism for Missore, or may be from the Arabic Sa!ar, a Straight Line.
The Hebrews called it JJ:i!, or Ji[ata; the Armenians and Persians, Tigris; and the Arabians, Al Sahm, all meaning an Arrow ; this last, gi,·en on the Dresden globe, being turned by Chilmead into Alloham, by Riccioli into Sohaham, and by Piazzi into Sham, In some of the A/fo11sine Tables appeared Iatusc, repeated in the Almagest of 15 15 as latilllO, both probably disfigured forms of olaT6r; and the Aljonsine Tables of 1521 had .Ala.hanoe, perhaps from the Arabic Al ::B'tDII or H•amaah, the Five (Stars), its noticeable feature. The same Almagest also had Albanere, adding est nu11, all unintelligible except from Scaliger's note:

Schickard wrote it Alohanzato. Sagitta is not noticed in the_ Reeves list of Chinese asterisms. Caesius imagined it the Arrow shot by J oash at Elisha's command, or one of those sent by Jonathan towards David at the stone Ezel; and Julius Schiller, the Spear, or the ll'ail, of the Crucihion.
Originally only 4° in length, modem astronomy has stretched the constellation to more than 10°; Argelander assigning to it 16 naked-eye stars, and Heis 18. Eratosthenes gave it only 4. It comes to the meridian on the 1st of September. None of Sagitta's stars seem to have been named, but its triple , is an interesting system. It has long been known as double, but the larger star was discovered by the late Alvan G. Clark to be itself an extremely close double and rapid binary. The components are of 6, 6, and 9 magnitudes; the two larger o". 1 apart in 1891, at a position angle of 182°.8. The smallest star is 8".5 distant. The colors are greenish, white, and blue.

translation,- was also used by early classic writers for this constellation: although where the word is seen with Vergil it is for the god Apollo. Flamsteed's Atlas has Bagittary, common for centuries before him; Shakespeare calling Othello's house - probably the Arsenal in Venicethe Sagittary,1 i.e. bearing the zodiac sign. The word was early written Bagitary; and Bagittarie and Baagittare in Chaucer's Astrolabe, from bis
Anglo-Norman predecessor, De Thaun. The Anglo-Saxons had hJtta. Columella called it Crotoa, and Hyginus, Croton, the Herdsman; but how these names are applicable does not appear. Others have been 'hr71'6Tf/r, On Horseback; Bemivir, the Half Man: Ta111'111 and Kinotauraa, from his fabled early shape, although now figured in equine form; while Cicero's An.tepee and Anteped11 may be for this, or for our Centaur. Cornipedet, Horn-Footed, also has been applied to it. Sometimes the whole was personified by its parts, as with Aratos, where we see T6fov, the Bow, the Arcu of Cicero and Germanicus; and the Hae:monioa Arcu of Ovid; in Egypt, where it is sairl to have been kno"11 as
an Arrow held in a human hand; and with Ovid again in Theu&JiCM Bagitta, Thessaly being the birthplace of the Centaurs. This induced Longfellow's lines in his Poets' Calendar for November:
With sounding hoofs across the earth I fly, A steed Thessalian with a human face.
And it has been Bagitta aroni applioata; or plain Telum with Capella of Carthage. Bayer cited Pharetra, the Quiver, and, recurring to the Bow. Blka.111u or Elkaau, Schickard's AlkauulO, from the Arabic Al '.l[au. The translator of Ulug Beg added to its modern name 9uem ttiam Arcum v«1111t. 1 which the Almagest of 1515 confirmed in its et est Arcus. It was the

and Arrow. This was an idea especially prevalent in Asiatic astronomy. Among the Jews it was the tribal symbol of Ephraim and Manasseh. from Jacob's last words to their father Joseph, "his bow abode in strength.'' Novidius claimed it as louh, the King of Israel, shooting arrows out of" the window eastward," at the command of the dying Elisha; but the

biblical set generally identified it with Saint Iatthew the Apoetle, although Caesius claimed that Sagittarius was IahmaeL The formation of this constellation on the Euphrates undoubtedly preceded that of the larger figure, the Centaur Chiron; but the first recorded classic figuring was in Eratosthenes' description of it as a Satyr, probably derived from the characteristics of the original Centaur, Hea-bani, and it so appeared on the more recent Farnese globe. But Manilius mentioned it, as in our modern style, mixlus equo, and with threatening look, very different from the mild aspect of the educated Chiron, the Centaur of the South; while it sometimes is given in later manuscripts and maps with flowing robes; but his crown always appears near his fore feet, and his arrow is always aimed at the Scorpion's heart. Dupuis said that it was shown in Egypt as an Ibis or Swan; but the Denderah zodiac has the customary Archer with the face of a lion added, so making it bifaced. Kircher gave its title from the Copts as Iltμa11pe, Statio amoenitatis.
The illustrated manuscript partly reproduced in the 47th volume of Archaeo/ogia has a centaur-like figure, Aatronoch11B, which, perhaps, is our Archer; but the title is of unexplained derivation, unlrss it be the Starholder, as Ophiuchus is the Serpent-}:iolder, and Heniochus, the Reinholder. It is in this same manuscript that is illustrated a sky group, Joculat;or,1 usually rendered the" Jester," and representing the Court Fool of mediaeval days; but I find no trace of this elsewhere. We have already noticed the confusion in the myths and titles of this zodiacal Centaur with those of the southern Centaur, some thinking Sagittarius the Xelpwv of the Greeks,-C::hiron with Hyginus and the Romans; although Eratosthenes and others, as did the modem Ideler, understood this name to refer to the Centaur proper. Ovid's Oenta111'111, however, and Milton's Centaur are the zodiac figure, as has been the case with some later poets; James Thomson writing in the Winter of his Seasons :
Now when the chearless empire of the sky To Capricorn the Centaur Archer yields.
Early tradition made the earthly Chiron the inventor of the Archer constellation to guide the Argonauts in their expedition to Colchis; although, and about as reasonably, Pliny said that Cleostratos originated it, with Aries, during the 6th or 5th century B. c. As to this we may consider

that, while Cleostratos, possibly, was the first to write on it, certainly none of the Greeks gave it form or title, for we see abundant evidence of its much greater antiquity on the Euphrates. Cuneiform inscriptions designate Sagittarius as the Strong One, the Oilllt King of War, and as the Dluminator of the Great City, personifying the archer god of war, ll'irgal or llirigal,1 or under his guardianship, as the Great Lord. This divinity is mentioned in the Second Book of Kings, xvii, 30. An inscription, on a fragment of a planisphere, transcribed by Sayce as Utuoagaba, the Light of the White Face, and by Pinches as Udgadu, the Flowing (?) Day, or the Smiting Sun Face, is supposed to be an allusion to this constellation; while on this fragment also appear the words Bibat A.nu, which accord with an astrolabe of Sennacherib, and were considered by George Smith as the name of its chief star. Another inscribed tablet, although somewhat imperfect, is thought to read Ka.kkab Xaatu, the Constellation, or Star, of the Bow,-in Akkadian Ban,- indicating one or more of the bow stars of the Archer. This will account for the To~ov of Aratos
and the Arcus of the Latins, Sayce agreeing with this in his rendering •ul· bau, the Star of the Bow. Pa and xut, Dayspring, also seem to have been titles, the latter because our Archer was a type of the rising sun. Upon some of the boundary stones of Sippara (Sepharvaim of the Old Testamml), a solar city, Sagittarius" appears sculptured in full glory." In Assyria it always was associated with the ninth month, Kislivu, corresponding to our November-December, with which we have already seen Orion associated. From all the foregoing it would seem safe to assume the Archer to be of Euphratean origin. India also claimed Sagittarius for its zodiac of 3000 years ago, figured as a Hone, Hone's head, or Horseman,-AQvini,- a word that appeared in Hindu stellar nomenclature in different parts of the sky. Al Biriini said that the constellation was the Sanskrit Dhanu, or Dha.nuu, the Tamil Dhamsu, given by Professor Whitney as DhanllB; while we have a very early statement that the stars of the bow and human part of the Archer represented the fan of lions' tails twirled by Mula, the wife of Chandra Gupta, the Sandrokottos of 300 B. c., ruler over the Indian kingdom Maurya and the Gangaridae and Prasii along the Ganges. But in later Indian astronomy it became Taukshika, derived from the Greek To~ih,x-. The Hindus located here another of their double nakshalras, the 18th and 19th, the Former and the Latter Ashi.dhi, Unconquered, which, in the main, were coincident with the manazil and sim of the same numbering. These were under the protection of the divinities A.pas, Waters, and Vi~ve
1 This may be seen in the Mandaeans' name to-day-Nerig-for the planet Mars.



The Constclladons 355
Devas, the Combined Gods; each being figured as an Elephant'• Tuk, and both together as a Bed. In ancient Arabia the two smalf groups of stars now marking the head and the vane of the Archer's arrow were of much note as relics of still earlier asterisms, as well as a lunar station. The westernmost of these,-y, d, e, and 7/,- were Al lla'im al Wirid, the Going Ostriches; and the eastern
most,- a, {, tf,, x, and T,-Al llaim al ~idirah, the Returning Ostriches, passing to and from the celestial river, the Milky Way, with the star .l for their :Keeper. Ideler thought it inexplicable that these non-drinking
creatures should be found here in connection with water, and Al Jauhari compared the figures to an Overturned Ohair, which these stars may represent. But Al Binini said that Al Zajjaj had a word that signifies the Beam over the mouth of a well to which the pulleys are attached; while another authority said that pasturing Cameh, or Cattle, were intended. There evidently is much uncertainty as to the true reading and signification of this title. All of the foregoing stars, with μ1 and μ2, were included in the 18th manzil, Al lla'im. The 19th mansil lay in the vacant space from the upper part of the figure toward the horns of the Sea-Goat, and was known as Al Baldah, the City, or District, for this region is comparatively untenanted. It was marked by one scarcely distinguishable star, probably rr, and was bounded by six others in the form of a Bow, the Arabs' ~'Ill, which, however, was not our Bow of Sagittarius. It also was Al Xilidah, the Necklace; and Al Udl1,iyy,
the Ostrich's Nest, marked by our T, v, ,p, w, A, and {; while the space between this and the preceding mansions was designated by Al Bir□ni as "the head of Sagittarius and his two locks." In his discussion of this subject, quoting, as he often did, from Arab poets, he compared this 19th manzil to" the interstice between the two eyebrows which are not connected with each other,"-a condition described by the word 'Ab/ad, somewhat similar to the Baldah generally applied to it. The 18th sieu, Xi, a Sieve, anciently Kit, was the first of these groups; and the 19th, Tew, Tow, or llan Tow, a Ladle or Measure, anciently Dew, was the second; both being alluded to in the She Ki11g:
In the south is the Sieve Idly showing its mouth
But it is of no use to sift;
the commentator explaining that the two stars widest apart were the Iouth, and the two closer together the Heeh; but he does not give the connection of these with the Sieve. And of the second group :

In the north is the Ladle Raising its handle to the west
Bat it lades out no liquor;
so that our l[ilk Dipper, {, .-, a, q,, and A, in the same spot, is not a modem conceit after all. The stars of this Ladle were objects of special worship in China for at least a thousand years before our era; indeed, also were known as a Temple.
The whole constellation was the Chinese Tiger, Williams giving, as another early name, Seih Kuh, the Cleft Tree, or Branches cut for fire-wood, and the later name, from the Jesuits, lin Ia, the Man-Horse. A part of it was included with Scorpio, Libra, and some of Virgo's stars in the large zodiacal division the Azure Dragon. The astrologers incorporated it with Capricornus in their Bing Xi. Astrologically the constellation was the Hollie of Jupiter, that planet having appeared here at the Creation, a manuscript of 1386 calling it the Bohoter "ye principal howce of Jupit "; although this honor was shared by Aquarius and Leo. Nor did Jupiter monopolize its possession, for it also was the domicile of Diana, one of whose temples was at Stymphalus, the home of the Stymphalian birds. These last, when slain by Hercules, were transferred to the sky as Aquila, Cygnus, and Vultur Cadens, and are all paranatellons of Sagittarius, as has been explained under Aquila. Thus the constellation was known as Dianae Bid1ll, It inclined to fruitfulness, a character assigned to it as far back as the BabyIonian inscriptions; and was a fortunate sign, reigning over Arabia Felix, Hungary, Liguria, Momia. and Spain, and the cities of Avignon, Cologne, and Narbonne; while ~fanilius said that it ruled Crete, Latium, and Trinacria. Ampelius associated it with the south wind, Auster, and the southwest wind, Africus; Aries and Scorpio being also associated with the latter. Yellow was the color attributed to it, or the peculiar green sanguine; and Arcandum in 15.42 wrote that a man born under this sign would be thrice wedded, very fonrl oi vegetables, would become a matchless tailor, and have three special illnesses. the last at eighty years of age. Such was much of the science of his day'. Sagittarius is shown on a coin of Gallienus of about A. n. 260, with the legend Apollini Conservat,1ri; and on those of King Stephen emblematic of his having landed in England in 1135 when the sun was here. La Caille took the star 11 out of this constellation for the (3 of his new Telescopium. This was the 25th of Ptolemy's list in the atf>vpov, or pastern, which would indicate that with him the feet had a very different situation from that on the present maps.



The Constel1ations 357
The symbol of the sign, I, shows the arrow with part of the bow. Sagittarius contains 54 naked-eye stars according to Argelander, and 90 according to Heis, although none is above the 2d magnitude. The sun passes through the constellation from the 16th of December to the 18th of January, reaching the winter solstice 1 near the starsμ on the 21st of December, but then of course in the sign Capricorn. A noticeable feature in the heavens lies within the boundaries of Sagittarius, an almost circular black void near the stars y and d, showing but one faint telescopic star; and to the east of this empty spot is another of narrow crescent form. An extraordinarily brilliant nova is said to have appeared low down in the constellation in 1011 or 1012, visible for three months. This was recorded in the Chinese annals of Ma Touan Lin.

With the same stars it may have been the Akkadian Anu•ni•tum., said to have been associated with the great goddess I1tar. Near .ii. appeared in A. o. 386 a bright nova, the fourth on record; and 7° northeasterly the cluster 25 M. is visible to the naked eye.

They mark the point of the winter solstice two thirds of the way southward towards, and in line with, the cluster N. G. C. 6523, 8 M., visible to the naked eye, with other noticeable clusters and nebulae close by. One of these, N. G. C. 6603, 24 M., towards the northeast, is Secchi's Delle Cauatiohe, from its peculiar arrangement of curves, while the celebrated Trifld Nebula, N. G. C. 6514, 20 M., lies not far off to the southwest. This was discovered in 1764, and so named from its three dark rifts; it is now specially noted from a suspected recent change in its position with regard to a star in one of these rifts. SpecLroscopic observations of this object show considerable discordance in their results. Brown says that the stars in the bow were the Persian Gau and the Sogdian and Khorasmian Yaugb, but by these nations were imagined as a Bull; the Copts knew them as Polis, a Foal. v1 and v2, red stars of the 5th magnitude, u' apart, and both double,

This has been identified with 1'11Dki of the Euphratean Ta6/tlofthe Thirty Stars, the Star of the Proclamation of the Sea, this Sea being the quarter occupied by Aquarius, Capricornus, Delphinus, Pisces, and Piscis Australis. It is the same space in the sky that Aratos designated as the Water; perhaps another proof of the Euphratean origin of much of Greek astronomy. In India it marked the junction of the nakshatra Ashadha with Abhijit. It lies on the vane of the arrow at the Archer's hand.

though the latter itself was in danger,- Sackville writing in his Induction to the Mfrror of Magistrates, about 1565:
Whiles Scorpio, dreading Sagittarius' dart Whose bow prest bent in flight the string had slipped, Down slid into the ocean flood apart,
Classical authors saw in it the monster that caused the disastrous runaway of the steeds of Phoebus Apollo when in the inexperienced hands of Phaethon. For some centuries before the Christian era it was the largest of the zodiac figures, forming with the X11lal, its Claws,-the prouclae chelae of Cicero, now our Libra,- a double constellation, as Ovid wrote:
Porrigit in spatium signorum membra duorum;
and this figuring has been adduced as the strongest proof of Scorpio's great antiquity, from the belief that only six constellations made up the earliest zodiac, of which this extended sign was one. With the Greeks it universally was I,,r.oprrlo~; Aratos, singularly making but slight allusion to it, added Mrya(J,qpiov, the Great Beast, changed in the 1720 edition of Bayer to MeA.a8vpiov; while another very appropriate term with Aratos was Tepar μiya, the Great Sign. This reputed magnitude perhaps was due to the mythological necessity of greater size for the slayer of great Orion, in reference to which that author characterized it as rri..e,6n:po~ rrpo4>a11elr, "appearing huger still."
The Latins occasionally wrote the word Boorpioa, but usually Soorpiu, or Scorpio; while Cicero, Ennius, Manilius, and perhaps Columella gave the kindred African title Bepa, or Bepaa, the first of which the Alfonsine Tables copy, as did Manilius the Greek adjective 'Orrio0o-~dμwv, Walking Backward. Astronomical writers and commentators, down to comparatively modem times, occasionally mentioned its two divisions under the combined title Boorpiu cum Chelil ; while some representations even showed the Scales in the creature's Claws. Grotius said that the Barbarians called the Claws Grafllaa, and the Latins, according to Pliny, For:floulae. In early China it was an important part of the figure of the mighty but genial Azure Dragon of the East and of spring, in later days the residence of the heavenly Blue Emperor; but in the time of Confucius it was Ta Who, the Great Fire, a primeval name for its star Antares ; and Shing Xung, a Divine Temple, was applied to the stars of the tail. As a member

of the early zodiac it was the Xue, for which, in the 16th century, was substituted, from Jesuit teaching, Tien He, the Celestial Scorpion. Sir William Drummond asserted that in the zodiac which the patriarch Abraham knew it was an Eagle; and some commentators have located here the biblical Chamben of the South, Scorpio being directly opposite the Pleiades on the sphere, both thought to be mentioned in the same passage of the Book of Jo/J with two other opposed constellations, the Bear and Orion; but the original usually is considered a reference to the southern heavens in general. Aben Ezra identified Scorpio, or Antares, with the ][£ail of the Hebrews; although that people generally considered these stars as a Scorpion, their 'A¥a,bh, and, it is claimed, inscribed it on the banners of Dan as the emblem of the tribe whose founder was "a serpent by the way." When thus shown it was as a crowned Snake or Buililt A similar figure appeared for it at one period of Egyptian astronomy; indeed it is thus met with in modern times, for Chatterton, that precocious poet of the last century, plainly wrote of the Scorpion in his line,
The slimy Serpent swelters in his course;
and long before him Spenser had, in the Faerie Queen :
and now in Ocean deepe Orion flying fast from hissing snake, His flaming head did hasten for to steepe.
But the Denderah zodiac shows the typical form. Kircher called the whole constellation 'Iaia~, Statio Isidis, the bright Antares having been at one time a symbol of Isis. The Arabians knew it as Al 'A¥a,b, the Scorpion, from which have degenerated Alaorab, Ala.trab, Alatrap, Haorab,- Riccioli's .Aakrab and Hacerab ; and similarly it was the Syrians' Akrevi. Riccioli gave us Acrobo Chaldaeis, which may be true, but in this Latin word he probably had reference to the astrologers. The Persians had a Scorpion in their Gheshdiim or Xuhdim, and the Turks, in their Xoirighi, Tailed, and Uzun Xoiriighi, Long-tailed. The Akkadians called it Girtab, the Seizer, or Stinger, and the Piaee where One Bows Down, titles indicative of the creature's dangerous character; although some early translators of the cuneiform text rendered it the Double Sword. With later dwellers on the Euphrates it was the sym· bol of darkness, showing the decline of the sun's power after the autumnal equinox, then located in it. Always prominent in that astronomy, Jensen thinks that it was formed there 5000 B. c., and pictured much as it now is;



The Constellations
perhaps a1so in the semi-human form of two Scorpion-men, the early circular Altar, or Lamp, sometimes being shown grasped in the Claws, as the Scales were in illustrations of the 15th century. In Babylonia this calendar sign was identified with the eighth month, Arakh Savna, our October-November.
Early India knew it as Ali, ViQrika, or Vrouohioam,- in Tamil, Vrilhaman; but later on Vara.ha Mihira said Kaurpya, and Al BirO.ni, Kaurba, both from the Greek Scorpios. On the Cingalese zodiac it was UuikL Dante designated it as Un Secohione,
Formed like a bucket that is all ablaze;
and in the .Purgalorio as D Friddo Animal of our motto, not a mistaken reference to the creature's nature, but to its rising in the cold hours of the dawn when he was gazing upon it. Dante's translator Longfellow has something similar in his own Poets' Calendar for October:
On the frigid Scorpion I ride.
Chaucer wrote of it, in the Hous of Fame, as the SoorpioUD; his AngloSorman predecessors, EaoorpiUD; and the Anglo-Saxons, Throwend. Caesius mistakenly considered it one of the Scorpion■ of Rehoboam; but Novidius said that it was
the scorpion or serpent whereby Pharaoh, King of Egypt, was enforced to let the children of Israel depart out of his country ;
of which Hood said " there is no such thing in history." Other Christians of their day changed its figure to that of the Apoltle Bartholomew; and Weigel, to a Cardinal'• Hat.
In some popular books of the present day it is the Kite, which it as much resembles as it does a Scorpion. Its symbol is now given as 1TJ., but in earlier times the sting of the creature was added, perhaps so showing the feet, tail, and dart; but the similarity in their symbols may indicate that there has been some intimate connection, now forgotten, between Scorpio and the formerly adjacent Virgo ( rryi ). Ampelius assigned to it the care of Africus, the Southwest Wind, a duty which, he said, Aries and Sagittarius shared ; and the weather-wise of antiquity thought that its setting exerted a malignant influence, and was accompanied by storms; but the alchemists held it in high regard, for only when the sun was in this sign could the transmutation of iron into gold be performed. Astrologers, on the other hand, although they considered it a fruitful sign, " active and eminent," knew it as the accursed constellation,

the baleful source of war and discord, the birthplace of the planet Mars, and so the Ho111e of Kara, the Kania Sid111 of Manilius. But this was located in the sting and tail; the claws, as Zvyor, J ugum, or the Yoke of the Balance, being devoted to Venus, because this goddess united persons under the yoke of matrimony. It was supposed to govern the region of the groin in the human body, and to reign over Judaea, Mauritania, Catalonia, Norway, West Silesia, Upper Batavia, Barbary, Morocco, Valencia, and Messina ; the earlier Manilius claiming it as the tutelary sign of Carthage. Libya, Egypt, Sardinia, and other islands of the Italian coast. Brown was its assigned color, and Pliny asserted that the appearance of a comet here portended a plague of reptiles and insects, especially of locusts. Although nominally in the zodiac, the sun actually occupies but nine days in passing through the two portions that project upwards into Ophiuchus, so far south of the ecliptic is it; indeed, except for these projections, it could not be claimed as a member of the zodiac. Scorpio is famous as the region of the sky where have appeared many of the brilliant temporary stars, chief among them, perhaps, that of 134 B. c., the first in astronomical annals, and the occasion, Pliny said, of the cata• logue of Hipparchos, about 125 B. c. The Chinese She Ke confirmed this appearance by its record of" the strange star" in June of that year, in the sieu Fang, marked by {3, d, rr, p, and others in Scorpio. Serviss thinks it conceivable that the strange outbursts of these novae in and near Scorpio may have had some effect in causing this constellation to be regarded hy the ancients as malign in its influence. But this character may, with at least equal probability, have come from the fiery color of its /,l(ida, as well as from the history of the constellation in connection with Orion, and the poisonous attributes of its earthly namesake. In southern latitudes Scorpio is magnificently seen in its entirety,-nearly 45°,- Gould cataloguing in it 184 naked-eye stars. Along its northern border, perhaps in Ophiuchus, there was, in very early days, a constellation, the Fox, taken from the Egyptian sphere of Petosiris. but we know nothing as to its details.

a11T{ "AP1Jt;, "similar to," or the" rival of," Mars, in reference to its color, -the Latin Tetra/Jwlos had Marti comparatur; or, in the Homeric signification of the words, the " equivalent of Mars," either from the color-resemblance of the star to the latter, or because the astrologers considered the Scorpion the Houe of that planet and that god its guardian. Thus it naturally followed the character of its constellation,- perhaps originated it,and was always associated with eminence and activity in mankind. Grotius, however, said that the word signifies a Bat, which, as Veapertilio, Sophocles perhaps called it; but Bayer erroneously quoted from Hesychios 'AvTapT71t;, a Rebel, and Tyrannu. Caesius appropriately styled the constellation Inaidiata, the Lurking One. Others say that it was An.tar'• Star,- but they forget Ptolemy,-the celebrated Antar or Antarah who, just previous to the time of Mul},ammad, was the mulatto warrior-hero of one of the Golden Mu'allal!at.1 Our word, however, is sometimes written An.tar, which Beigel said is the Arabic equivalent of "Shone"; but the Latin translator of the 1515 Almagest connected it with Natar, Rapine, and so possibly explaining the generally unintelligible expression lmdit ad rapinam applied to Antares in that work and in the Aljonsine Ta/Jles of 152 t; or the expression here may refer to the character of"Ap11,;, the god of war. The .RudolphiM 1a/Jles designated it as rutilans, Pliny's word for "glowing redly." The Arabians' ¥alb al •~ab, the Scorpion's Heart, which probably preceded the Kapdia !.1Cop1rlov and Cor Soorpii of Greece and Rome respectively, became, in early English and Continental lists, Xelbalacrab, Calbalacrab, Calbolacrabi, Calbalatrab, and Cabalatrab; Riccioli having the unique Al· cantub, although he generally wrote Xalb A.akrab. Antares alone constituted the 16th manzil, Al ~b, the Heart, one of the fortunate stations; but the Chinese included o and ,, on either side, for their sieu, the synonymous Sin, anciently Sam, o being the determinant; although Brown says that this Heart refers to that of Taing Lung, the Azure Dragon, one of the four great divisions of their zodiac. They also have a record of a comet 531 B. c., "to the left of Ta Shin," which last Williams identified with Antares; while, as the Fire Star, Who Sing, it seems to have been invoked in worship centuries before our era for protection against fire. With some adjacent it was one of the lling t'ang, or Emperor's Council-hall; his sons and courtiers, other stars, standing close by, to whom Antares, as Ta Who, announced the principles of his government.

The Hindus used a, a, and T for their naksluzlra lyeathi, Oldest, also · known as Bohinl, Ruddy, from the color of Antares,-Indra, the sky-goddess, being regent of the asterism that was figured as a pendent Bar lewel It was one of the four Royal Stars of Persia, 3000 B. c., and probably the 'Guardian of the Heavens that Dupuis mentioned as Satevil; but, as their lunar asterism, it was Gel, the Red; the Sogdians changing this to Kaghan 1adwil, the Great One saffron-colored. The K.horasmians called it Dha.rind, the Seizer; and the Copts, Kha.rthiu, the Heart. It pointed out to the Babylonians their 24th ecliptic constellation, Hmn, of uncertain meaning, itself being Urbat according to an astrolabe discm·ered in the palace of Sennacherib and interpreted by the late George Smith; Brown, however, assigns this title to stars in Lupus. Other Euphratean names were Bilu-tha.-ziri, the Lord of the Seed ; Kak-thi■a, the Creator of Prosperity, according to Jensen, although this is generally ascribed to Sirius: and, in the lunar zodiac, Dar Luga.I, the King, identified with the god of lightning, Luga.I Tudela, the Lusty King. Naturally the inscriptions make much of it in connection with the planet Mars, their Ul Suru, showing that its Arean association evidently had very early origin ; and from them "·e read J[uu (?) Sar, the Hero and the King, and Kakka.b Bir, the Vermilion Star. Brown identifies it with the seventh antediluvian king, 'Evt:~pavxOI', or Udda-an-xu, the Day-heaven-bird. From his Assyrian researches Cheyne translates the 36th verse from the 38th chapter of the Book of Job :
Who hath put wisdom into the Lance-star? Or given understanding to the Bow-star?
Jensen referring this La.noe-■tar to Antares. Hommel, however, identifies it with Procyon of Canis Minor. In Egyptian astronomy it represented the goddess Selldt, Sellt-t, or Serk•t, heralding the sunrise through her temples at the autumnal equinox about 3700-3500 B. c., and was the symbol of I■il in the pyramid ceremonials. Renouf included it with Arcturus in the immense figure Kenat. Penrose mentions the following early Grecian temples as oriented towards the rising or setting of Antares at the vernal equinox: the Heraeum at Argos, in the year I 760, perhaps the oldest temple in the cradle of Greek civilization; the first Erechtheum at Athens, 1070; one at Corinth, 770; an early temple to Apollo at Delphi, rebuilt with this orientation in 630: and one of the same date to Zeus at Aegina; - all of these before our era. It rises at sunset on the 1st of June, culminating on the 11th of July, and is one of the so-called lunar stars; and some have asserted that it was the

first star observed through the telescope in the daytime, although Smyth made this claim for Arcturus. Ptolemy lettered it as of the 2d magnitude, so that in his day it may have been inferior in brilliancy to the now very much fainter {J Librae. Antares belongs to Secchi's third type of suns, which Lockyer says are" in the last visible stage of cooling," and nearly extinct as self-luminous bodies; although this is a theory by no means universally accepted. The companion is 311.5 away, and suspected of revolution around its principal; their present position angle is 270°. A photograph by Barnard in 1895 first showed the vast and intricate moud B'ebula stretching to a great distance around Antares and the star a. It was here, two or three degrees north of Antares, that was discovered, on the 9th of June, Coddington's c~met, c of 1898, the third comet made known by the camera.

Grafllu generally is said to be of unknown derivation; but since rpa,paio<; signifies" Crab," it may be that here lies the origin of the title, for it is well known that the ideas and words for crab and scorpion were almost interchangeable in early days, from the belief that the latter creature was generated from the former.I It was thought by Grotius to be a "Barbarian" designation for the Claws of the double constellation; and Bayer said the same, although he used the word for f Scorpii in the modem northern claw. In Burritt's Atlas of 1835 it appears for ; of the northern Scale, the ancient northern Claw; but in the edition of 1856 he applied it to our {J Scorpii, and in both editions he has a second {J at the base of the tail, west of e. The Century Dictionary prints it Graa1iaa, probably from erroneously reading the early type for the letter/. {J is near the junction of the left claw • with the body, or in the arch of the Kite bow, 8° or 9° northwest of Antares. In some modern lists it is A.crab,- Riccioli's Aakrab IChemali It was included in the 15th manzil, lklil al labhah, the Crown of the Forehead, just north of which feature it lies, taking in with this, however, the other stars to d and rr; some authorities occasionally adding v and p. This was one of the fortunate stations, and from this manzil title comes the occasional lclil. The Hindus knew the group as their 15th 11aksha/ra, Anuridhi, Propitious or Successful,- Mitra, the Friend, one of the Adityas,
being the presiding divinity; and they figured it as a Bow or Ridge, which

The corresponding sim, lug, a Room or House, anciently Fong, consisted of /3 with d, rr, and p, although Professor Whitney thought it limited to the determinant ,,., tht faintest of the group and farthest to the south. It shared with Antares the title Ta Who, and was the central one of the seven lunar asterisms making up the Azure Dragon, Tsing Lung. But individually /3 seems to have been known as Tien Sze, the Four-horse Chariot of Heaven, and was worshiped by all horsemen. It probably also was Fu Xwang, the Basket with Hanc!le5, and highly regarded as presiding over the rearing of silkworms, and as indicating the commencement of the season of that great industry of China. Timochares saw /3 occulted by the moon in the year 295 B. c.; and Hind repeats a statement by Ptolemy, from Chaldaean records, that the planet Mars almost occulted it on the 17th of January, 272 B. c.; Smyth. however, substituted /3 Librae in this phenomenon and 271 B. c. as the date. The two largest components are 1411 apart, at a position angle of 25°; the third being o".9 from the first, with a position angle of 89°. Half-way from /3 to Antares lies the fine cluster N. G. C. 6093, 80 M., on the western edge of a starless opening 4° broad. It was this that called forth Sir William Herschel's exclamation :

although powerful telescopes reveal in it many minute stars. His son afterwards described forty-nine such spots in various parts of the sky. This cluster, that Sir William thought might perhaps have been formed by stais drawn from that vacancy," was lit up in 1860 for a short time by the outburst of a temporary star."

Indeed for at least three hundred years there has been disagreement among astronomers as to this star; for although Argelander and Heis follow Bayer, Gould writes :
Since it appears out of the question that it should ever again be regarded as belonging to Scorpius, I have ventured to designate it by the letter a [Librae].
Bayer cited for it Brachium, the Arm, as from Vergil, but this was erroneous in so far as being a title for this star, the original brachia in the Gturgi(s

simply signifying the " claws " that it marks; Bayer added Oomu, the Horn, as from some anonymous writer. In Arabia it was Zubin al 'Apab, the Scorpion's Claw, which has become Zuban al Xravi, Zuben Aorabi; and Bayer said ZUben Hakrabi and Zuben el Oenubi, contracted from Al Zubin al ,Tantibinah, the Southern Claw. Similar titles also appear for stars in Libra, the early Claws. In China it was Chin Chay, the Camp Carriage. Brown included it, with others near by in Hydra's tail, in the Akkadian Bntena-mu-luv, or Ente-mu-mur, the Assyrian Etlen-tairi, the Tail-tip.

Dechubba is found in the Whitall Planisphere, probably from Al labhah, the Front, or Forehead, where it lies. In the Palermo Catalogue the title Iclarkrav is applied to a star whose assigned position for the year 1800 would indicate our d. If this be the case, it may have been a specially coined word from the Arabs' IklD. al •~b, the Crown of the Scorpion; and this conjecture would seem justified by our previous experience of that catalogue's star nomenclature as seen in
its remarkable efforts with a and f3 Delphini. Riccioli had Aakrab genubi.
cf was of importance in early times, for with f3 and 1r, on either side in a bending line, it is claimed for the Euphratean Gia-gan-gu.11ll', the Light of the Hero, or the Tree of the Garden of Light, " placed in the midst of the abyss," and so reminding us of that other tree, the Tree of Life, in the midst of the Garden of Eden. It was selected by the Babylonian astronomers, with /3, to point out their 23d ecliptic constellation, which Epping calls Qablu (und qibu) aha rilhu aqrabi, the Middle of the Head of the Scorpion. The earliest record that we have of the planet Mercury is in connection with these same two stars seen from that country 265 B. c. In the
lunar zodiac d, {3, and rr were the Persian •ur, Bright ; the Sogdian and Khorasmian Bighanwand, Clawless; and the Coptic Stephani, the Crown. In China the 2d-magnitude e, with μ, ,, 1/, 8, ,, K, v, and A, formed the 17th sieu, Wei, the Tail, anciently known as Iii and as Vi, μ being the determinant; but, although this Tail coincided with that part of our Scorpion, Brown thinks that reference is rather made to the tail of the Azure Dragon, one of the quadripartite divisions of the Chinese zodiac which lay here. fJ, a 2d-magnitude red star, was the Euphratean Bargas, lying in the Milky Way just south of A and v, with which it formed one of the seven pairs of Twin Stars; as such it was J[a-a-m And it may have been, with 1, 1, A, and v, the Girtab of the lunar zodiac of that valley, the Vanant of 24

Shaula probably is from Al Shaulah, the Sting, where it lies; hut. according to Al Binini, from Jl'u•biJah, Raised, referring to the position of the sting ready to strike. These words have been confused with the names for the adjoining v, and in the course of time corrupted to Shaub, Alucha, Ko•olek, and Shomlek; Chilmead writing of these last :
It is also called lohomlek, which Scaliger thinkes is read by transposition of the letters for Mosclek, which signifieth the bending of the taile.
Naturally it was an unlucky star with astrologers. ,t and v were the 17th 111an1il, Al Shaulah, and the nalultalra Vicritiu, the Two Releasers, perhaps from the Vedic opinion that they brought relief from lingering disease. Some Hindu authorities, taking in all the stars from e to v, called the whole Kiili, the Root, with the divine Nirrity, Calamity, as regent of the asterism, which was represented as a Lion'• Tail; this title appearing also for stars of Sagittarius.

the French Beu, or Bouohiere, de Sobieaki, the Italian Scudo di Sobieaki, and the German Sobieu:iloher Schild, was formed by Hevelius from the seven unfigured 4th-magnitude stars in the Milky Way west of the feet of Antinoiis, between the tail of the Serpent and the head of Sagittarius. Heis increased this number to eleven.. The title is often seen as Sou.tum Sobieskii or Sobiesii, sometimes as Clypeu Sobieskii, more correctly written Clipeu; but our astronomers follow Flamsteed in his plain Scutum. It is pictured as the Coat of Arma of the third John Sobieski, king of Poland, who so distinguished himself in the defensive wars of his native land, as well as in his successful resistance of the Turks in their march on Vienna when turned back at the Kalenberg on the 12th of September, 1683. It was just after this, when he had made his triumphal entry into the city, that at the cathedral service of thanksgiving the officiating priest read the passage: There was a man sent from God, who~e name was John.
Seven years subsequently this new constellation was named for him by Hewel, with a glowing tribute to his merit and heroic deeds; the sign of the Cross for which he fought being emblazoned on his Shield as we have it to-day. Some identify this Crou, however, with that of the fighting Franciscan friar, Saint John Capistrano, famous at Belgrade in 1456, and now honored by a colossal statue on the exterior of the Vienna cathedral. The four stars on the border of the Shield are for the four sons of the king. Although Scutum is a recent creation with us, it has long been known in China as Tien Pien, the Heavenly Casque, but in this are included some components of Antinoils. It comes to the meridian about the 10th of August. It has no named star,- indeed the figure itself does not appear upon some modem maps,- and is chiefly noticeable from the peculiar brightness of the surrounding Galaxy; for within its boundaries, in five square degrees of space, Sir Wilham Herschel estimated that there are 331,000 stars; and it is very rich in nebulae. Of these the notable cluster N. G. C. 6705, II M., discovered by Kirch in 1681 and likened by Smyth to a flight of wild ducks, lies on the dexter chief of the Shield. This is just visible to the naked eye, and Sir John Herschel called it" a glorious object." Just below the constellation is the celebrated Horlelboe, or 11, B'ebula, N. G. C. 6618, 17 M., one of the most interesting in the heavens, although 24•

le Serpent in France, il Serpente in Italy, and die Schla.nge in Germany, probably is very ancient, and always has been shown as grasped by the hands of Ophiuchus at its pair of stars cJ, E, and at v, T Ophiuchi. The head is marked by the noticeable group t, "• y, ,p, v, p, and the eight little stars all lettered T, and consecutively numbered, 10° south from the Crown and 20° due east from Arcturus; the figure line thence winding southwards 15° to Libra, and turning to the southeast and northeast along the western edge of the Milky Way, terminating at its star 0, 8° south of the tail of the Eagle and west of that constellation's cJ. Of the four stellar Snakes this preeminently is the Serpent, its stars originally being combined with those of Ophiuchus, although Manilius wrote
Serpentem Graiis Ophiuchus nomine dictus dividit;
but it now is catalogued separately, and occasionally divided into Caput and Cauda on either side of the Serpent-holder. The Greeks knew it as "Otpt!; 'O,prnvxov, or simply as "Olf>t!:, and familiarly as 'EprreT6v and 'Eyxi-lvr, respectively the Serpent and the Eel; the Latins, occasionally as Anguilla, Anguil, and Coluber; but universally as Serpenl, often qualified as the Serpent of Aeeoulapiu, C&elliu, Glauoua, Laooo6D, a.nd of Ophiuchu; and as Serpens Herouleu, Lemaeu, and Sagarinu. The 1515 Almagest and the Alfonsine Tables of 1521 had Serpena Alangue, thus combining their corrupted Latin with their equally corrupted Arabic, as often is the case with those works. It also was Draao Le■biu and TiberiD.111, and, perhaps, Ovid's and Vergil's Lucidu AnguiL In the astronomy of Arabia it was Al ,anah, the Snake,- Chilmead's Alhafa i but before that country was influenced by Greece there was a very

and hi.I Dog, the stars a in Ophiuchus and Hercules. To the Hebrews, as to most nations, this was a Serpent from the earliest times, and, Renan said, may have been the one referred to in the Book of Job, xxvi, 13; but Delitzsch, who renders the original words as the" Fugitive Dragon," and others with him, consider our Draco to be the constellation intended, as probably more ancient and widely known from its ever visible circumpolar position. The biblical school made it the serpent seducer of Eve, while in our day imaginative observers find another heavenly Crou in the stars of the head, one that belongs to Saint Andrew or Saint Patrick. Serpens shared with Ophiuchus the Euphratean title of llu-tair-cla, the Image of the Serpent; and is supposed to have been one of the representatives of divinity to the Ophites, the- Hivites of Old Testament times. The comparatively void space between v and E was the Chinese Tien Shi Yuen, the Enclosure of the Heavenly Market. Argelander counts 51 stars within the constellation boundaries, and Heis 8z.

Unult1 al Bay,-or U1111Jralbai, is from 'Un.J al ~JJ8,h, the Neck of the Snake, the later Arabic name for this star; the Uunk al Hay of the Standard .Dictionary is erroneous,-a type error perhaps for Unuk. It was also Alioth, Alyab, and Alyat, often considered as terms for the broad and fat tail of the Eastern sheep that may have been at some early day figured here in the Orientals' sky; but we know nothing of this, and these are not Arabic words, so that their origin in Al J:Iayyah of the constellation is more probable. Smyth somewhat indefinitely states that Alangue and
Bu Alaugue appear in the Alfonsine Tables, presumably for this star. a may have been the /ucid11s anguis of Ovid and Vergil, as it certainly was
the Cor Berpmtil of astrology. With A. it was known as Shuh, the title of certain territory in China; and Edkins rather unsatisfactorily writes :

original figure comprised the twelve unclaimed stars between Leo and Hydra, west of Crater; and Smyth writes:
With more zeal than taste, he fixed the machine upon the Serpent's back, under the plea that the said Sextant was not in the most convenient situation, but that he placed it between Leo and Hydra because these animals were of a fiery nature, to speak with astrologers, and formed a sort of commemoration of the destruction of his instruments when his house at Dantzic was burnt in September, 1679; or, as he expresses it, when Vulcan overcame Urania.
Its inventor's great name has kept it in the sky till now, and it is still generally recognized by astronomers as Sexta.n1. Here, on the frame of the instrument, 9° south by east from the star Regulus, De Rheita thought that he had found a representation of the Budarium Veronicae, the sacred handkerchief of Saint Veronica. Commenting upon this discovery, Sir John Herschel said that "many strange things were seen among the stars before the use of powerful telescopes became common." The ludda, a 4th-magnitude, is 1 2° south from Regulus. One of the Sextant stars, which Reeves gives as q, Bode's 2306, a 6thmagnitude, was the Chinese Tien Seang, the Heavenly Minister of State. Argelander catalogues 17 naked-eye stars, and Heis 48.

Ere the heels of flying Capricorn Have touched the western mountain's darkening rim, I mark, stem Taurus, through the twilight gray, The glinting of thy born, And sullen front, uprising large and dim, Bent to the starry Hunter's sword at bay. Bayard Taylor's H?M• u Tan,,
le Taureau of France, il Toro of Italy, and der Stier of Germany, everywhere was one of the earliest and most noted constellations, perhaps the first established, because it marked the vernal equinox from about 4000 to 1700 B. c., in the golden age of archaic astronomy; in all ancient zodiacs preserved to us it began the year. It is to this that Vergil alluded in the much quoted lines from the 1st Georgie, which May rendered:
When with bis golden hornes bright Taurus opes, The yeare; and downward the crosse Dog-starre stoopes;
and the poet's description well agrees with mythology's idea of Europa's bull, for he always was thus described, and snowy white in color. This descended to Chaucer's Wh:,te Bole, in Troilus and Criseyde, from the eandidus Taurus of the original. The averso, " crosse," in the second line of this passage : . • • averso cedens Canis occidit astro,
adversus with Ovid, and aversaque Tauri sidera with Manilius,-gen· erally has, however, been translated" backward," as a supposed allusion to the constellation rising in reversed position; but quite as probably it is from the mutual hostility of the earthly animals. Taiipor, its universal title in Greek literature, was more specifically given as Toμq and IIpoToμq, the Bust, the Bull generally being drawn with only his forward parts, Cicero following this in his prosee/Q eorpore Ta11rus, and
Ovid in his Pars prior apparel Posterior& latent,



The Constellations 379
which the mythologists accounted for by saying that, as Taurus personified the animal that swam away with Europa, his flanks were immersed in the waves. This association with Europa led to the constellation titles Portit.or,
or Proclitor, Buropu; Apnoreu, used by Ovid, referring to her father; and Tyriu, by Martial, to her country. This incomplete figuring of Taurus induced the frequent designation, in early catalogues, Seatio hurl, which the Arabians adopted, dividing the figure at the star o, but retaining the hind
quarters as a sub-constellation, Al llatt, recognized by Ulug Beg, and, in its translation, as Seatio, by Tycho, the line being marked by o, f, s, and/. Ancient drawings generally showed the figure as we do, although some gave the entire shape, Pliny and Vitruvius writing of the Pleiades as cauda Tauri, so implying a complete animal. Aratos qualified his Tavpor by 71'£71'~, "crouching"; Cicero, by in
/kXQfJf« genu, " on bended knee"; Manilius, by nixus, "striving"; and further, in Creech's translation:
The mighty Bull is lame ; His leg turns under;
and
Taurus bends as wearied by the Plough ;
this crouching position also being shown in almost all Euphratean figuring, as are the horns in immense proportions. The last descended to Aratos, who styled the constellation Kt:pa6v, and is seen in the Corn111 of Ovid. The latter author wrote again of the sky figure :
Vacca sit an taurus non est cognoscere promptum,
from the conflicting legends of Io and Europa ; for some of the poets, changing the sex, had called these stars Io, the Wanderer, another object of Jupiter's attentions, whom Juno's jealousy had changed to a cow. They also varied the title by the equivalent luven• Inacbi& and Inachil, from her father Inachus. She afterwards became the ancestress of our Cepheus and Andromeda. Still another version, from the myth of early spring, made Taurus Amui111 Puiphaee, the Lover of Pasiphae; but La Lande's
Chironia Fili& seems unintelligible. The story that the Bull was one of the two with brazen feet tamed by the Argonaut Jason, perhaps, has deeper astronomical meaning, for Thompson writes :
The sign Taurus may have been the Cretan Ball; and a transit through that sign may have been the celestial BcScnropor of the Argonautic voyage.

It bore synonymous titles in various languages: in Arabia, Al Tllaur, which degenerated to Bl Taur, Altor, Ataur, Altauro, by Schickard; Tar, by Riccioli; and even now Taur, in our SJandard .Dfelionary. In Syria it was Tauri; in Persia, Tora, Ghav, or Oiu; in Turkey, Ughu; and in Judaea... Shor, although also known there as Brim, a word that zoologically appears in the Authorized Version of our Bi/Jle as the "unicorn," but better in the Revised as the " wild ox." Latin writers mentioned it under its present name, to which Gennanicus added Boe from the country people, although it also was Priuoepa &l'IMllti,
the Leader of the herd, and Ba.bulcu, the peasant Driver of the Oxen, a title more usual and more correct, however, for Bootes; La Lande quoting it as Bubulum Oaput.
Manilius characterized Taurus as dives puellis," rich in maidens," referring to its seven Hyades and seven Pleiades, all daughters of Atlas, and the chief attraction in a constellation not otherwise specially noticeable. An early Grecian gem shows three nude figures, hand in hand, standing on the head of the Bull, one pointing to seven stars in line over the back, which Landseer referred to the Hyades; but as six of the stars are strongly cut, and one but faintly so, and the letter P is superscribed, Doctor Charles Anthon is undoubtedly correct in claiming them for the Pleiades, and the three figures for the Graces, or Charites. These were originally the Vedic Harits, associated with the sun, stars, and. seasons; and this astronomical character adhered to the Charites, for their symbols in their ancient temple in Boeotia were stones reputed to have fallen from the sky. A coin, struck 43 B. c. by P. Clodius Turrinus, bore the Pleiades in e\ident allusion to the consular surname; while earlier still - 312-64 B. c.the Seleucidae of Syria placed the humped bull in a position of attack on their coins as symbol of this constellation. The gold muhrs, or mohurs, and the zodiacal rupees, attributed to Jehangir Shah, of 1618, show Taurus as a complete, although spiritless, creature, with the gibbous hump peculiar to Indian cattle. This is always drawn in the Euphratean stellar figure, and was descnbed as KvpTor by an early commentator on the s_vlllaxis. But the silver rupees of the same monarch have the customary half animal in bold, butting attitude exactly as it is now, and as it was described by Manilius in his jlexus and nisus, and by Lucan in his mrl'alus. A very ancient coin of Samos, perhaps of the 6th century before Christ, bears a half-kneeling, sectional figure of a bull, with a lion's head on the obverse; and one of Thurii, in Lucania, of the 4th century B. c., has the complete animal in position to charge. Another of this same city bears the Bull with a bird on its back, perhaps symbolizing the Peleiad Doves.



The Constellations
Plutarch wrote, in his De Fade Orbe Lunae, that when the planet Saturn was in Taurus, i. e. every thirty years, there took place the legendary migration from the external continent beyond the Cronian, or Saturnian, Sea to the Homeric Orgyia, or to one of its sister islands. South American savage tribes held ideas similar to our own about Taurus, for La Condamine, the celebrated French scientist of the last century, said that the Amazon Indians saw in the> of the Hyades the head of a bull; while Goguet more definitely stated that, at the time of the discovery of that river, by Yanez Pinzon in 1500, the natives along its banks called the group Tapiira B.ayoaba, the Jaw of an Ox; and even in civilized countries it has been fancifully thought that its shape, with the horns extending to /j and {, gave title to the constellation. In China it formed part of the White Tiger, and also was known as Ta Leang, the Great Bridge, from a very early designation of the Hyades and Pleiades ; but as a zodiac constellation it was the Cock, or Hen, recalling the modem Hen and Chickens of the Pleiades. When the Jesuits introduced their Western nomenclature it became Kin lieu, the Golden Ox. After Egyptian worship of the bull-god Oliria had spread to other Mediterranean countries, our Taurus naturally became his sky representative, as also of his wife and sister Ilia, and even assumed her name ; but the starry Bull of the Nile country was not ours, at least till late in that astronomy. Still this constellation is said to have begun the zodiacal series on the walls of a sepulchral chamber in the Ramesseum ; and, whatever may have been its title, its stars certainly were made much of throughout all Egyptian history and religion, not only from its then containing the vernal equinox, but from the belief that the human race was created when the sun was here. In Coptic Egypt it, or the Pleiades, was •apiar, the Good Season, Kircher's Stano Hori, although it was better known as Apia, the modem form of the ancient Hapi, whose worship as god of the Nile may have preceded e,·en the building of the pyramids. As first in the early Hebrew zodiac it was designated by A or Aleph, the first letter of that alphabet, coincidently a crude figure of the Bull's face and horns ; some of the Targums assigning it to the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, from Moses' allusion to their father Joseph in the 33d chapter of Deutero11omy,-" his horns are the horns of the wild ox"; but others said that it appeared only on the banners of Ephraim; or referred it to Simeon and Levi jointly, from Jacob's death-bed description of their character,-" they boughed an ox"; or to Issachar, the "strong ass" which shared with the ox the burdens of toil and carriage. It has been associated with the animal that Adam first offered in sacrifice,



Star-Names and their Meanings
or with the later victims in the Jewish temple; and the Christian school of which Novidius was spokesman recognized in Taurus the Ox that !,tood with the ass by the manger at the blessed Nativity. Hood said of this: "But whether there were any ox there or no, I know not how he will pro,·e it." In the "apostolic zodiac" it became Saint An.chew; but Caesius said
that long before him it was loeeph the Patriarch. Representations of the Jlithraio Bull on gems of four or five centuries before Christ, reproduced in Lajarde's Cu/le de Mitltra, prove that Taurus was at that time still promin~nt in Persico-Babylonian astronomy as well as in its religion. One of these representations, showing the front of the Bull's head, may very well be the origin of our present symbol of this sign. , ~ , although it also has been considered a combination of the full and crescent moon, associated with this constellation as a nocturnal sign; and some assert that Taurus was drawn as a demi-bull from his representing the crescent moon. This appears on a Babylonian cylinder seal of about 2150B.c Still earlier in Akkadia it seems to have been known as the Bull of Lipt, its double title, Te Te, referring to its two groups, the Hyades and Pleiades. which in every age have been of so much interest to mankind; and a cylinder has Gut-an-na, the Heavenly Bull, mentioned in connection with rain. so recalling the rainy Hyades. Epping says that it was the Babylonians' Shir, and that four of their ecliptic constellations were marked by its stars; while Jensen mentions it as symbolic of ][ardik, the Spring Sun, son of Ia, whose worship seems to have been general 2200 B. c.,-probably long before,- and that it was originally complete and extended as far as the Fish of Ia, the northern of the two Fishes. This high authority carries the formation of Taurus still farther back, to about 5000 B. c., even before , the equinox lay here. The name of the second of the antediluvian Babylonian kings, the mythical Alaparos, seems connected with this constellation or with the /udda, Aldebaran; and its stars certainly were associated witl: the second month of the Assyrian year, A-aru, the Directing Bull, our AprilMay, as they were in the Epic of Creation with the conquest of the Centaur.
Taurus was the Cingalese Ul'Ul&ba, the early Hindu Vriaba, Vriahu, or Vrouoha.bam,-in the Tamil tongue, B.iahabam; but subsequently Varaha Mihira gave it as Taouri, his rendering of Taurus, and Al Biriini, in his India, as Timbiru.
With the Druids it was an important object of worship, their great religious festival, the Tauric, being held when the sun entered its boundaries; and it has, perhaps fancifully, been claimed that the tors of England were the old sites of their Taurine cult, as our cross-buns are the present reprt· sentatives of the early bull cakes with the same stellar association, tracing



The Constellations
back through the ages to Egypt and Phoenicia. And the Scotch have a story that on New Year's eve the Oandlemu Bull is seen rising in the twilight and sailing across the sky,-a matter-of-fact statement, after all. The Anglo-Saxon Manual of Astronomy four centuries ago gave it as Fearr.
Astrologers made this sign the lord of man's neck, throat, and shoulders; Shakespeare having an amusing passage in Twelfth Night, in the dialogue between Sirs Toby Belch and Andrew Aguecheek, when both blunder as to this character of Taurus. And it was considered under the guardianship of Venus, sharing this distinction with the body of Scorpio,- some said with Libra,-whence it was known as Veneria Bidu, Domu Veneria nooturna, and Gaudium. Veneria: an idea also perhaps influenced by its containing the Ileleui«Jer, the Doves, the favorite birds of that goddess. It ruled over Ireland, Greater Poland, part of Russia, Holland, Persia, Asia Minor, the Archipelago, Mantua, and Leipzig in modern astrology, as it did over Arabia, Asia, and Scythia in ancient; Ampelius assigned to it the care of the much dreaded west-northwest wind, Pliny's Argestes. White and lemon were the colors allotted to it. On the whole, it was an unfortunate constellation, although a manuscript almanac of 1386 had "whoso is born in yat syne schal have grace in bestis "; and thunder, when the sun was here, "brought a plentiful supply of victuals." The extent and density of the stars in Taurus are shown by the fact that, according to Argelander, it contains 121 visible to the naked eye; 1881 according to Heis.

Aldebaran is from Al Daba.rin, the Follower, i. e. of the Pleiades, or, as Professor Whitney suggested, because it marked the 2d mam:il that followed the first. The name, now monopolized by this star, originally was given to the entire group of the Hyades and the lunar mansion which, as 1'1.'ir al
Dabarin, the Bright One of the Follower, our star marked; yet there was diversity of opinion as to this, for the first edition of the A/fonsine Tables applied it solely to a, while that of 1483, and Al Sufi, did not recognize a as included in the title. Riccioli usually wrote it Aldebara, occasionally

Aldebaram, adopted in the French edition of Flamsteed's .Atlas of 1776; Spenser, in the Faerie Quem wrote Aldeboran, which occasionally still appears; Chaucer, in the Rous of Fame, and even the modem La Lande, had Aldeboran; Schickard gave the word as Addebma and Debiron; and Costard, in his History of Aslrono'lly, cited Aldebaron.
Al Biriini quoted, as titles indigenous to Arabia, Al ~ . the Stallion Camel; Al Pa~ the Fat Camel; and Al Ku\ldij, the Female Camel,- the smaller adjacent stars of the Hyades being the Little Camela; and it was
Till al llajm and Hidi al lla.jm, equivalents of the Stella DomiDatm of classical ages, as if driving the Pleiades before it. Indeed in the last century Niebuhr heard the synonymous ~ al Thurana on the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf. A later name was 'Ain al Thaur,which Western astronomers corrupted to Atin and Hain Altor,- identical with •oμμa Boor, Ooul111 Tauri, and the early English Bull's Bye, even now a common title. Riccioli gave this more definitely as Ocu1111 auatralil, and Aben Ezra as the Left Eye. The .Alfonsine 1ablts, however, said Cor Tauri, the Bull's Heart, which is far out of the way; and it has borne the constellation's Arabic title. changed to El Taur. Aldebaran was the divine star in the worship of the tribe Misim, who thought that it brought rain, and that its heliacal rising unattended by showers portended a barren year. The Hindu Bohinl, a Red Deer, used also for the naluluztra in Scorpio marked by Antares, was unquestionably from the star's ruddy hue, Leonard Digges writing, in his .Prognostication for 1555, that it is "ever a meatc: rodde [red] "; and the Alfonsine Tables had IJUIM trnl,il at/ aern, darw111 vallle-est ut urea.
Palilicium,1 in various orthography, but correctly Pariliaium, used for the whole group of the Hyades, descended as a special designation for Aldebaran through all the catalogues to Flamsteed's, where it is exclusively used. Columella called it Buoula as chief of the peasants' Suculae. Ptolemy's Aaμ1ratJiar, Torch-bearer, was Aa1mav~ in Proclus' Paraphrase. The 1603 and 1720 editions of Bayer's Uranomelria distinctly terminate their lists of Aldebaran's titles with the words Bubrd'a and Aben Blra; but Bayer's star-names are often by no means clear, and here incorrect. The latter of these is merely the name of the famous Jewish commentator to whom he often refers; and the former a designation of the light red color (S111JnJ/a)

of the star which we all recognize. Some poet has written "red Aldebaran 1 bums "; and William Roscoe Thayer, in his Halid:
I saw on a minaret's tip Ald~baran 1 like a ruby aflame, then leisurely slip Into the black horizon's bowl.
In all astrology it has been thought eminently fortunate, portending riches and honor; and was one of the four Royal Stars, or Guardians of the Sky, of Persia, 5000 years ago, when it marked the vernal equinox. As such Flammarion quoted its title Tuchter, which Lenormant said signified the Creator Spirit that caused rain and deluge; but a different conception of these Guardian Stars among the Hindus is noted under Argo, and still another is given by Edkins, who makes Aldebaran Batavee, the leader of the western stars. Flammarion has assigned to it the Hebrew Aleph that we have seen for Taurus, rendering it God's Bye; and Aben Ezra identified it with the biblical Ximih, probably in connection with all the Hyades and as being directly opposed on the sphere to X'ail which he claimed for Antares. Sharing everywhere in the prominence given to its constellation, this was especially the case in Babylonian astronomy, where it marked the 5th ecliptic asterism Pidnu-tha-Shame, the Furrow of Heaven, perhaps representing the whole zodiac, and analogous to the Hebrew and Arabic Patlan and Fadan, the Furrow. So that, before the Ram had taken the Bull's place as Leader of the Signs, Aldebaran was Xu, I·ku, or I·ku·u, the Leading Star of Stars. Still more anciently it was the Akkadian OiHa, also rendered the "Furrow of Heaven"; and Dil-gan, the Messenger of Light,- this, as we have seen, being applied to Hamal, Capella, Wega, and perhaps to other bright stars, as their positions changed with respect to the equinox. In the same way the Syriac word 'IJithi, which we have seen for the star Capella, seems to have been used also for Aldebaran. As marking the lunar station it was the Persian Paha. and the Khorasmian-Sogdian Baharu, signifying the Follower. Riccioli cited, from Coptic Egypt, IItwpiwv, Stalio Hori; and Renouf identified Aldebaran with the indigenous Nile figure Sarit. An old Bohemian title is Hrua.. The Hervey Islanders associated it, as Aumea., with Sirius in their legend of the Pleiades. Al Biriini quoted strange Arabic titles for the comparatively vacant space

Aldebaran is but slightly south of the ecliptic, and, lying in the moon's path. is frequently occulted, thus often showing the optical illusion of projection. As one of the lunar stars it is much used in navigation. It is the only star in the Harvard Photometry which is exactly of the 1st magnitude, although by the Estimates of that catalogue it is 1.2. It thus has three times the brilliancy of Polaris. The parallax is given by Elkin as o". xox, showing a distance from us of twenty-eight light years; or, if the interval between the earth and the sun. the astronomers' unit of stellar measurement, be considered as one inch, that between the sun and this star would be twenty-seven miles. It is receding from our system at the rate of thirty miles a second, and, next to; Herculis, seems to have the greatest velocity in the line of sight of any oi the bright stars yet determined. The spectrum is Solar, and a beautiful example of the type. Aldebaran comes to the meridian on the xoth of January. It has a 10thmagnitude companion, 109" away, which has long been known, but Burn· ham recently divided this into Ix and 13.5, x".8 apart, at a position angle of 279°; and, in 1888, discovered a 14th-magnitude companion 3111.4 distant, at a position angle of 109°.

The Constellations
Mythologically they were daughters of Atlas and Aethra, and hence halfsisters of the Pleiades, with whom they made up the fourteen Atlantides; or the Dodonides, the nymphs of Dodona, to whom Jupiter entrusted the nurture of the infant Bacchus, and raised them to the sky when driven into the sea by Lycurgus. Similarly they were said to be the Nysiades, the nymphs of Nysa, and teachers of Bacchus in India. Anciently supposed to be seven in number, we modems count but six, and Hesiod named only five,- Kleea, Eudora, Koronis, Phaeo, and Pbaesula; but Pherecydes gave a complete list of them, although one of his names has been lost, and the rest, preserved by Hyginus, vary from those given by Hesiod, and doubtless are somewhat corrupted in form. These were Aesula or Pedile, Ambrosia, Dione, Thyene or Thyone, Eudora, Koronis, and Polyxo or Phyto.1 Pherecydes probably took in f3 and ?; at the tips of the horns, omitting some of the fainter stars now included in the group; Thales, however, is said to have acknowledged but two,- a and E in the eyes,-" one in the Northern Hemisphere, and the other in the South"; Hipparchos and Ptolemy named only a and 'Y as 'Tddwv; Euripides, in the Phait/11111, counted three; and Achaeus, four. Ovid used Thyone for the whole, but none of the sisters' names have been applied to the individual stars as in the case of the Pleiades. They are among the few stellar objects mentioned by Homer,- and by him, Hesiod, Manilius, Pliny, and doubtless others, given separately from Taurus. Pliny called them Parilicium, from their lucida, Aldebaran. The Greeks knew them as 'Tad,:r, which became" Hyades'' with the cultured Latins, supposed by some to be from vEiv, "to rain," referring to the wet period attending their morning and evening setting in the latter parts of May and November; and this is their universal character in the literature of all ages. Thus we have Hyades Graiis ab imbre v«at of Ovid's Fasti; pluviasque Hyadas of the Aeneid and of Ovid again; and pluviae generally, which Manilius expressed in his
Sad Companions of the turning Year.
While far back of all these, in the She King:
The Moon wades through Hyads bright, Foretelling heavier rain.
Pliny wrote of them as being "a violent and troublesome star causing stormes and tempests raging both on land and sea"; in later times Edmund Spenser called them the Koilt Daughtera; Tennyson, in his Ulysses, said :
Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades vext the dim sea;

and Owen Meredith has "the watery Hyades" in The Earl's .Re/tin:. The queer old Guide into Tongues of John Minsheu, calling them the Seven Stan,- the only instance of this title that I have met for this group,makes still more intimate their connection with the showers; for at its ...-ord Hyades the reader is referred to the word .Raine, where we see:
Hyades, Mder, dictae stellae quaedam in cornibus Tauri; quae orl1I tKCfUUfJ. sus pluvias largosque imbres cundlant.
And in Doctor Johnson's Dictionary the word is defined as "a watery constellation." Thus they have always been considered most noteworthy by husbandmen, mariners, and all who were dependent upon the weather. even to the last two or three centuries. Ovid called them Sidu Hya.ntia, after their earthly brother, Hyas, whose name, after all, would seem to be the most natural derivation of the title: and it was their grief at his death which gave additional point to Horace's Iris/es Hjadas, and, in one version of their story, induced Jove to put them in the sky. But their colloquial title among the Roman country-people was Suulae, the Little Pigs, as if from Sus, Sow, the Greek 'Tr, Homer's .Iiir, which indeed might as well be the derivation of 'TdoEr as vEtv. This name constantly occurs in astronomical literature from the time of Columella and Pliny to Kepler, Hevelius, and Flamsteed; Pliny accounting for it by the fact that the continual rains of the season of their setting made the roads so miry that these stars seemed to delight in dirt, like swine ! And this idea, trivial though it seems, was sufficiently prevalent for Cicero, a century before Pliny, to think worthy of contradiction in his De Natura Dtor111'1. Smyth said that the title might come from the resemblance of the group to a pig's jaws; or because Aldebaran and its companion stars were like a so.with her litter. Peck suggests, in his Dictionary of Classical Liltrahm and Antiquities, that Suculae was the oldest Roman name, given before the Greek appellation was known, and to be compared with our popular stellar titles such as the Dipper, Charles' Wain, etc. Isidorus tracedit to sucus, "moisture," a pleasanter derivation, and possibly more correct, than that held in ancient Italy. This will account for Bayer's Suoeidae. Bassus and others knew the group as v-,ptA6v, the symbol with Pythag· oras for human life; and the Roman V, as it resembles those letters,-a and E being the extremes, y at the vertex. But Ulug Beg's translator wrote:
Quinque stellae quae sunt in facie, in forma Lambdae Graecorum ct formi roi, Di!.
In the Alfonsine Tables we find Lampadu, the accusative plural of Lam· pada, a Torch.



The Constellations
Occasional Arabic titles were Al Jlijcla1J., a Triangular Spoon, and Al :t[ilAt, the Little She Camels, referring to the smaller stars in distinction
from Aldebaran, the Large Camel; Al Ferghani wrote the word ~•if. These Little Camels appeared in one Arabic story as driven before the personified Aldebaran, in evidence of his riches, when he went again to woo Al Thurayya, the Pleiades, who previously had spurned him on account of his poverty. Another author made the word Al ~ the Boiling Sea, so continuing in Arabia the Greek and Roman ideas of its stormy and watery character. Generally, however, in that country, the Hyades were Al Dabarin, which was adopted in the 1515 Almagest, as well as in the Alfonsine Tables of 1521, where we read sunt stellae alde/Jaran, specially referring to the star y "of those in the face." The Arabic title, therefore, was identical with that of the 2d mansil, which these stars constituted, as they also did the 2d nakshatra, Rohini, Aldebaran marking the junction with the adjacent Mriga~irsha. The Hindus figured this asterism as a Temple, or Wagon; and there are many astrological allusions to it in the Siddhanlas, the collective term for the various standard astronomical books of that people. The Chinese utilized it for their 2d sieu, Pi, or Peih, anciently Pal, a Hand-net, or a Rabbit-net, but included l and a; although some limited this station toe, the farthest to the north. The Site King thus described it:
Long and curved is the Rabbit Net of the sky;
but with that people generally it was the Star of the Hunter, and, with the astrologers, the Drought Car. This title, however, was inappropriate, for the Hyades seem to have been as closely identified with rain in China as in Greece or Rome,- indeed were worshiped as Yi Bbl, the General, or Ruler, of Rain, from at least 1100 B. c. Still this character was not native, but must have been derived from western ~sia, where the early rains coincided with the heliacal rising of these stars, which was not the case in China by nearly two months. The adjacent small stars, with ~. were Tien Lin, the Celestial Public Granary; and the whole group was known as the Amlcnmcer of Invuion on the Border.
The Hyades have been identified with the scriptural Kauiroth, but there is little foundation for this; even less than for their identification, by Saint Jerome and by Riccioli, with the Klmih of the .Book of Job, ix, 9. Anglo-Saxon titles are Baeclgutran, Baeclgunan, and lledgaemun, whatever these may mean; and the Boar-Thl'ong which that people saw in the sky may have been this group rather than Orion as generally is supposed. It is thought that the Hyades have a united proper motion towards the 25•

Bl llath is from Al lli~ the Butting One, because located on the tip of the northern ,horn, 5° from{, similarly placed on the southern. This title also appears for Aries and its star Hamal. Bayer said that many included it and { in the Hyades group, but this seems improbable, although Pherecydes had it thus. {j Tauri is identical with y Aurigae, and has been considered as belonging to either constellation ; Burritt's A I/as calling it Aurigae or Bl llath.

'Inin, usually translated the Heel of the Rein-holder. Smyth, who is often humorous amid his exact science, referring to the position of this star at the greatest possible distance from the hoof, says: "Can this have given rise to the otherwise pointless sarcasm of' not knov.·ing B from a bull's foot '? " With Capella and other stars in Auriga it was the Chinese Woo Chay, a Fire-carriage. In Babylonia it was Shur-narkabti-lha-iltanu, the Star in the Bull towards the North, or the Northern Star towards the Chariot,- not our Wain, but the Ghariot of Auriga,- and marked the 6th ecliptic constellation. The sun stood near this star at the commencement ofspring 6000 years ago. Among the Hindus it represented Agni, the god of fire, and commonly bore that title; as also the similar HutabhuJ, the Devourer of the Sacrifice. Astrologers said that El Nath portended eminence and fortune to all who could claim it as their natal star. It has a Sirian spectrum, and is receding from us at the rate of about five miles a second.

It marks the tip of the southern horn and the singular Crab 1'ebula, a little to the northwest, the first in Messier's catalogues,1 and now known as N. G. C. 1952, 1 M. Although Bevis had seen this in 1731, it was accidentally rediscovered by Messier on the 12th of September, 1758, while observing , and a neighboring comet, and led to his two catalogues of 103 nebulae and clusters, published from 1771 to 1782, the first attempt at a complete list of these objects. The return of Halley's comet was first observed in August, 1835, close to this star, when the nebula was a perfect mare's-nest to· astronomical tyros.

Holds all. and they themselves are dim to see.
All literature contains frequent allusions to them, and in late years they probably have been more attentively and scientifically studied than any other group. They generally have been located on the shoulder of the Bull as we hm them, but Hyginus, considering the animal figure complete, placed them on the hind quarter; Nicander, Columella, Vitruvius, and Pliny, on the tail,
In cauda Tauri septem quas appellavere Vergilias ;
although Pliny also is supposed to have made a distinct constellation of them. Proclus and Geminos said that they were on the back; and others, on the neck, which Bayard Taylor followed in his Hymn to Taurus,
where they Cluster like golden bees upon thy mane.
Eratosthenes, describing them as over the animal, imitated Homer and Hesiod in his fl)..uc£r; while Aratos, calling them, in the Attic dialect. Ill11idcJ11r, placed them near the knees of Perseus; thus, as in most of his poem, following Eudoxos, whose sphere, it is said, clearly showed them in that spot. Hipparchos in the main coincided with this, giving them as IUw.fr and IUetdder; but Ptolemy used the word in the singular for four 1 of the stars, and did not separate them from Taurus. The Arabians and Jews put them on the rump of Aries; and the Hindu astronomers, on the head of the Bull, where we now see the Hyades. The Pleiades seem to be among the first stars mentioned in astronomical literature, appearing in Chinese annals of 2357 B. c., Alcyone, the /utida, then being near the vernal equinox, although now 24° north of the celestial equator; and in the Hindu lunar zodiac as the 1st naksl,atra, Xrittiki.1 Ka.rteek, or Kartiguey, the General of the Celestial Armies, probably long before 1730 B. c., when precession carried the equinoctial point into Aries. Al Biriini, referring to this early position of the equinox in the Pleiades. which he found noticed " in some books of Hermes," 2 wrote :
1 The Krittikas were the six nurses of Skanda, the infant god of war, represented by tl:e planet Mars, literally motherless, who took to himself six heads for his better nourishment, and his nurses' name in Karttikeya, Son of the Krittikas. 2 These Hermetic Books were the sacred canon of Egypt, in forty-two volumes. treating of religion and the arts and sciences, their authorship being ascribed to the god Thoth, wbODl the Greeks knew as Hermes Trismegistos, Thrice Great Hermes.

This statement must have been made about 3000 years and more before Alexander.
And their beginning the astronomical year gave rise to the title " the Great Year of the Pleiades" for the cycle of precession of about 25,900 years. The Hindus pictured these stars as a Flame typical ofAgni, the god of fire and regent of the asterism, and it may have been in allusion to this figuring that the western Hindus held in the Pleiad month K.artik. (October-November) their great star-festival Dibali, the Feast of Lamps, which gave origin to the present Feast of Lanterns of Japan. But they also drew them, and not incorrectly, as a B.uor with a short handle, the radical word in their title, kart, signifying" to cut." The Santals of Bengal called them Sar en; and the Turks, Ulgher. As a Persian lunar station they were Perv, Perven, Penil, Panig, or Parvis, although a popular title was Peren, and a poetical one, Parnr. In the .Ru!Hfis, or Rubd'iydt, of the poet-astronomer Omar Khayyam, the tentmaker of Naishapur in 1123, "who stitched the tents of science," they were
Panrin, the Parven of that country to-day; and, similarly, with the Khoras
mians and Sogdians, Pam and Parnr; - all these from Peru, the Begetters, as beginning all things, probably with reference to their beginning the year. In China they were worshiped by girls and young women as the Seven 8ilten of lndutry, while as the 1st sieu they were Kao, Bau, or Kaou, anciently Kol, The Constellation, and Gang, of unknown signification, Alcyone being the determinant. On the Euphrates, with the Hyades, they seem to have been Kae-tal>ba-gal-gal-la, the Great Twins of the ecliptic, Castor and Pollux being the same in the zodiac. In the 5th century before Christ Euripides mentioned them with 'AtT6r, our Altair, as nocturnal timekeepers; and Sappho, a century previously, marked the middle of the night by their setting. Centuries still earlier Hesiod and Homer brought them into their most beautiful verse; the former calling them 'ATlciytv11r, Atlas-born. The patriarch Job is thought to refer to them twice in his word lDmih, a Cluster, or Heap, which the Hebrew herdsman-prophet Amos, probably contemporary with Hesiod, also used; the prophet's term being translated " the seven stars" in our Authorized Version, but " Pleiades " in the Revised. The similar Babylonian-Assyrian Ximta, or Ximmatu, signifies a "Family Group," for which the Syrians had Kimi, quoted in Humboldt's Cosmos as Gemat; this most natural simile is repeated in Seneca's Medea as densos .Pleiadum greges. Manilius had Glomerabile Sidue, the Rounded Asterism, equivalent to the

Globu Pleiadum of Valerius Flaccus; while Brown translates the m.,μarlr/t' of Aratos as the !'look of Cluteren. In Milton's description of the Creation it is said of the sun that
the gray Dawn and the Pleiades before him danc'd, Shedding sweet influence,
the original of these last words being taken by the poet from the B(){J/i ,j Jo!J, xxxviii, 31, in the Authorized Version, that some have thought an astrological reference to the Pleiades as influencing the fortunes of mankind, or to their presumed influential position as the early leaders of the Lunar Mansions. The Revised Version, however, renders them "cluster." and the Septuagint by the Greek word for "band," as if uniting the members of the group into a fillet; others translate it as "girdle," a conception of their figure seen in Amr al ~ais' contribution to the Mu'a/la1!,ft, translated by Sir William Jones :
It was the hour when the Pleiades appeared in the firmament like the folds of a silken sash variously decked with gems.
Von Herder gave Job's verse as:
Beigel as: Canst thou bind together the brilliant Pleiades ?
Canst thou not arrange together the rosette of diamonds of the Pleiades?
and Hafiz wrote to a friend :
To thy poems Heaven affixes the Pearl Rosette of the Pleiades as a seal of immortality.
An opening rose also was a frequent Eastern simile; while in Sadi's G11ustan, the Rose-gar~en, we read :
The ground was as if strewn with pieces of enamel, and rows of Pleiades seemed to bing on the branches of the trees;
or, in Grars translation :
as though the tops of the trees were encircled by the necklace of the Pleilllcs.
William Roscoe Thayer repeated the Persian thought in his Ha/id:
slowly the Pleiades Dropt like dew from bough to bough of the cinnamon trees.



The Constellations 395
That all these wrote better than they knew is graphically shown by Miss Clerke where, alluding to recent photographs of the cluster by the Messrs. Henry of Paris, she says :
The most curious of these was the threading together of stars by filmy processes. In one case seven aligned stars appeared strung on a nebulous filament "like beads on a rosary." The" rows of stars," so often noticed in the sky, may therefore be concluded to have more than an imaginary existence.
The title, written also P1iadee and, in the singular, Pliu, has commonly been derived from 1TMiv,"to sail," for the heliacal rising of the group in May marked the opening of navigation to the Greeks, as its setting in the late autumn did the close. But this probably was an afterthought, and a better
derivation is from TTA.eior, the Epic form of 1r.:\.ewr, "full," or, in the plural, "many," a very early astronomical treatise by an unknown Christian writer having .Plyades a pluralitate. This coincides with the biblical Kimiih and the Arabic word for them -Al Thur&J'J'L But as Pleione was the mother of the seven sisters, it would seem still more probable that from her name our title originated. Some of the poets, among them Athenaeus, Hesiod, Pindar, and Simonides, likening the stars to Rock-pigeons flying from the Hunter Orion, wrote the word IJe.:te,aoer,. which, although perhaps done partly for metrical reasons, again shows the intimate connection in early legend of this group with a flock of birds. When these had left the earth they were turned into the Pleiad stars. Aeschylus assigned the daughters' pious grief at their father's labor in bearing the world as the cause of their transformation and subsequent transfer to the heavens; but he thought these Peleiadel a-rr-:-epo,, " wingless." Other versions made them the Seven Doves that carried ambrosia to the infant Zeus, one of the flock being crushed when passing between the Symplegades, although the god filled up the number again. This story probably originated in that of the dove which helped Argo through; Homer telling us in the Odyssey that
No bird of air, no dove of swiftest wing, That bears ambrosia to the ethereal king, Shuns the dire rocks; in vain she cuts the skies, The dire rocks meet and crush her as she flies ;
and the doves on Nestor's cup described in the Iliad have been supposed to refer to the Pleiades. Yet some have prosaically asserted that this columbine title is merely from the loosing of pigeons in the auspices customary

at the opening of navigation. These stories may have given rise to the Sicilians' Seven Doveleta, the Sette PaJmnmielle of the Pmtameron.
Another title analogous to the foregoing is Butram from Isidorus,Caesius wrongly writing it Brutum,- in the mediaeval Latin for Borplll", J Bunch of Grapes, to which the younger Theon likened them. It is a happy simile, although Thompson 1 considers it merely another avian association like that seen in the poetical Peleiades and the Alcyone of the /uada. Vergiliae and Sid111 Vergiliarmn have always been common for the cluster as rising after Ver, the Spring,-the .Breeches Bi/Jk having this m:irginal note at its word" Pleiades" in the Booll of Jo/J, xxxviii, 31:
which starres arise when the sunne is in Taurus which is the spring time and bring flo,rer,,.
And these names obtained from the times of the Latin poets to the 18th century, but often erroneously written Virgiliae. Pliny, describing the glow-worms, designated them as stdlae and likened them to the Pleiades:
Behold here before your very feet are your Vergiliae ; of that constellation are they the offspring.
And the much quoted lines in I.ocllsley Hall are similar:
Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade, Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.
Bayer cited Signatricia Lumina.
Hesiod called them the Seven Virgina and the Virgin Stan; Vergil, the Boae A.tlantidee; Milton, the Seven Atlantic Siaten ; and llelperides, ~he I title for another batch of Atlas' daughters from Hesperis, has been apphed . i to them. Chaucer, in the Hous of Fame, had A.tlantea doughtrel 18ffllt; but his " Sterres sevene " refer to the planets. As the Seven Smen they are familiar to all; and as the Seven Stan they occur in various early Bibk versions ; in the SifaJllterri of the Anglo-Saxons, though they also wrote Pliade; in the &ptistellium t:eslis institoris, cited by Bayer; and in the modem German Siebengeetirn. This numerical title also frequently has been applied to the brightest stars of the Greater Bear, as in early days it was to the" seven planets,"-the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter. and Saturn. Minsheu had the words " Seven Starrcs " indiscriminately for
1 He traces the word back as equivalent to 'Oira,, a Dove, probably Col•tllH _ , of Old World ornithology, and so named from its purple-red breast like wine,-'o,...~,-and na111rail1 referred to a hunch of grapes; or perhaps because the bird appeared in migration at tht riaie of the vintage. This is strikingly confirmed by the fact that coins of Mallos in Cilicia bolt doves with bodies formed by bunches of grapes; these coins bt-ing succeeded by others bWing grapes alone; and we often see the bird and fruit still associated in early Christi>II symbolism.

the Pleiades, Hyades, and Ursa Major, saying, as to the first," that appear in a cluster about midheaven." As the group outline is not unlike that of the Dipper in Ursa Major, many think that they much more deserve the name Little Dipper than do the seven stars in Ursa Minor; indeed that name is not uncommon for them. And even in our 6th century, with Hesychios, they were ~anlla, a Chariot, or Wagon, another well-known figure for Ursa Major. Ideler mentioned a popular designation by his countrymen,- Bohil'abrta Oeltim, the Sailors' Stars,- peculiarly appropriate from the generally supposed derivation of their Greek title and meteorological character of 2000 years ago; hut the Tables of some Obscure Wordis of King James I anticipated this in " Seamena Starns - the seaven starres."
The Teutons had Seulainer; the Gaels, Griglean, Grioglachan, and )(ea,nmnaeh; the Hungarians, who, Grimm says, have originated 280 native names for stars, called the Pleiades Fiutik and Heteveny,- this last in Finland Het'e wi'ne; the Lapps of Norway knew them as lliedgierreg; while the same people in Sweden had the strange Suttjenia 11.auko, Fur in Frost, these seven stars covering a servant turned out into the cold by his master. The }<'inns and Lithuanians likened them to a Sieve with holes in it; and some of the French peasantry to a J[oaquito llet, Co1llinim,in the Languedoc tongue CouigneiroL The Russians called them Baba, the Old Wife; and the Poles, Baby, the Old Wives. As we have seen the Hyades likened to a Boar Throng, so we find with Hans Egede, the first Norse missionary to Greenland, 1721-34, that this sister group was the Killuktunet of that country, Dogs baiting a bear; and similarly in Wales, Y twr tewdwa, the Close Pack. Weigel included them among his heraldic constellations as the J[ultiplication Table, a coat of arms for the merchants. Sancho Panza visited them, in his aerial voyage on Clavilefio Aligero, as las Siete Cabrillaa, the Seven Little Nanny Goats; and la llacchetta, the Battledore, is a familiar and happy simile in Italy; but the astronomers of that country now know them as Plejacli, and those of Germany as Plejaden. The Rabbis are said to have called them Sukkoth Jtcniith, usually translated "the Booths of the Maidens" or "the Tents of the Daughters," and the Standard .Dictionary still cites this supposed Hebrew title; but Riccioli reversed it as Filiae Tabernaculi. All this, however, seems to be erroneous, as is well explained in the Spealur's Commentary on the 2d .Book of the Kings xvii, 30, where the words are shown to be intended for the Babylonian goddess Zarbanit, Zirat-banit, or Zir-pa-nit, the wife of Bel Marduk. The Alfonsine Tables say that the " Babylonians," by whom were proba

bly meant the astrologers, knew them as A.torage, evidently their word for the manzil Al Thurayya, the Many Little Ones, a diminutive form of Tharwan, Abundance, which Al Biriini assumed to be either from their appearance, or from the plenty produced in the pastures and crops by the attendant rains. We see this title in Bayer's A.thoraie ; in Chilmead's A.tamia quasi 1izuri11ae ~· and otherwise distorted in every late mediae,·i! work on astronomy. Riccioli, commenting on these in his Allllllgtslu• Novum, wrote Ara6i&e non A.thoraiae vet A.ta.rage sed A.ltorieh sa Benat Bluuoh, ha& es/filiae congregationis; the first half of which may be correct enough, but the Benat, etc., singularly confounded the Pleiad stars with those of Ursa Major. In his Astronomia .Rtformata he cited A.thonee and
A.ltorich from Aben Ragel. Taran.Ji is another form, which Hewitt says i,.

A special Arabic name for them was Al llajm, the Constellation par exctllmu, and they may be the Star, or the Star of piereing brightn.. referred to by Mutiammad in the 53d and 86th Suras of the $uriin, and versified from the latter by Sir Edwin Arnold in his Al Hafiz, /1,e Prtsnt·tr:
By the sky and the night star! By Al Tiirik the white star ! To proclaim dawn near; Shining clear When darkness covers man and beast
the planet Venus being intended by Al Ta.rile. Grimm cited the similar Syryiin Voykodsyun, the Night Star.
They shared the watery character always ascribed to the Hyades, as i, shown in Statius' .Pliad11m nivosum sidus; and Valerius Flaccus distinctly used the word " Pliada " for the showers, as perhaps did Statius in his J'li,,da movere; while Josephus states, among his very few stellar allusions. that during the investment of Jerusalem by Antiochus Epiphanes, 170 B. c., the besieged suffered from want of water, but were finally relieved "by a large shower of rain which fell at the setting of the Pleiades." In the same way they are intimately connected with traditions of the Flood found among so many and widely separated nations, and especially in the Deluge-myth of Chaldaea. Yet with all this well established reputation, we read in the 1Vorks and Days:
\Vhen with their domes the slow-pac'd snails retreat, Beneath some foliage, from the burning heat Of the Pleiades, your tools prepare.



The Constellations 399
They were a marked object on the Nile, at one time probably called Chu or Chow, and supposed to represent the goddess liit or lleith, the Shuttle, one of the principal divinities of Lower Egypt, identified by the Greeks with Athene, the Roman Minerva. Hewitt gives another title from that country, Athur-ai, the Stars of Athyr (Hathor), very similar to the Arabic word for them; and Professor Charles Piazzi Smyth suggests that the seven chambers of the Great Pyramid commemorate these seven stars. Grecian temples were oriented to them, or to their lucida; those of Athene on the Acropolis, of different dates, to their correspondingly different positions when rising. These were the temple of 1530 B. c. ; the Hecatompedon of 1150 B. c. ; and the great Parthenon, finished on the same site 438 B. c. The temple of Bacchus at Athens, 1030 B. c., looked toward their setting, as did the Asclepieion at Epidaurus, 1275 B. c., and the temple at Sunium of 845 B. c. While at some unknown date, perhaps contemporaneous with these Grecian structures, they were pictured in the Xew World on the walls of a Palenque temple upon a blue background; and certainly were a well-known object in other parts of Mexico, for Cortez heard there, in 1519, a very ancient tradition of the destruction of the world in some past age at their midnight culmination. A common figure for these stars, t;verywhere popular for many centuries, is that of a Hen with her Chickens,- another instance of the constant association of the Pleiades with flocking birds, and here especially appropriate from their compact grouping. Aben Ragel and othc;r Hebrew writers thus mentioned them, sometimes with the Coop that held them,- the Kaua Gal· linae of the Middle Ages ; these also appearing in Arabic folk-lore, and still current among the English peasantry. In modern Greece, as the Hen• coop, they are Iloti.lta or Ilovkta, not unlike the word of ancient Greece. Miles Coverdale, the translator in 1535 of the first complete English .Bible, had as a marginal note to the passage in the .Book of Jqb:
these vii starres, the olook hane with her ohioklDI;
and Riccioli, in his Almagestum N()1Jum:
Gennanici! Bruthean: Anglice Butrio id est ga11ina fovens pullos.
We see in the foregoing the Butrum of Isidorus, Riccioli's great predecessor in the Church. The German farm laborers call them Gluck Henne; the Russian, lluddha, the Sitting Hen; the Danes, Aften Hoehne, the Eve Hen ; while in Wallachia they are the Golden Cluck Hen and her five Chicb. In Servia a Girl is added in charge of the brood, probably the star Alcyone, 11aia appropriately taking her place as the Mother. The French and



400 Star-Names and their Meanings
Italians designate them, in somewhat the same way, as Pullinien, Polllli
mre, and Gallinelle, the Pullets, Riccioli's Gallinella. Aborigines of Africa and Borneo had similar ideas about them. Pliny's translator Holland called them the Brood-hen star Vergiliae.
Savage tribes knew the Pleiades familiarly, as well as did the people of ancient and modern civilization; and Ellis wrote of the natives of the Society and Tonga Islands, who called these stars llatarii, the Little Eyes:
The two seasons of the year were divided by the Pleiades ; the first, Matarii i nia. th( Pleiades Above, commenced when, in the evening, those stars appeared on the horizon, and continued while, after sunset, they were above. The other season, Matarii i raro, thr Pleides Below, began when, al sunset, they ceased to be visible, and continued till, in tbr evening, they appeared again above the horizon.
Gill gives a similar story from the Hervey group, where the Little Eyes arc Katariki, and at one time but a single star, so bright that their god Tane in envy got hold of Aumea, our Aldebaran, and, accompanied by l\lere,our Sirius, chased the offender, who took refuge in a stream. Mere, howe,·er, drained off the water, and Tane hurled Aumea at the fugitive, breaking him into the six pieces that we now see, whence the native name for the fragments, T9:uono, the Six, quoted by Flammarion as Tau, both titles singu• larly like the Latin Taurus. They were the favorite one of the various ave/as, or guides at sea in night voyages from one island to another; and. as opening the year, objects of worship down to 1857, when Christianity prevailed throughout these islands. The Australians thought of them as Yomig Girll playing to Young Men dancing,-the Belt stars of Orion: some of our Indians, as Dan.cert; and the Solomon Islanders as Togo ni aamu, a Company of Maidens. The Abipones of the Paraguay River country consider them their great Spirit Groaperikie, or Grandfather; and
in the month of May, on the reappearance of the constellation, they welcome their Grandfather back with joyful shouts, as if he had recovered from sickness, with the hymn, "What thanks do we owe thee! And art thou returned at last? Ah! thou bast happily recovered! " and then proceed with their festivities in honor of the Pleiades' reappearance.
Among other South American tribes they were Cajupal, the Six Stars. The pagan Arabs, according to Hafiz, fixed here the seat of immortali~·; as did the Berbers, or Kabyles, of northern Africa, and, widely separated from them, the Dyaks of Borneo; all thinking them the central point of the universe, and long anticipating Wright in 1750 and Madler in 1846, and, perhaps, Lucretius in the century before Christ. Miss Clerke, in a charming and instructive chapter in her Sys/afl ofti,, Stars which should be read by every star-lover, tells us that:



The Constellations
With Novcmber, the " Pleiad-month," many primitive people began their year; and on the day of the midnight culmination of the Pleiades, November 17, no petition was presentm in vain to the ancient Kings of Persia; the same event gave the signal at Busiris for the commencement of the feast of Isis, and regulated less immediately the celebration connected with the fifty-two-year cycle of the Mexicans. Savage Australian tribes to this day dance in honor of the" Seven Stars," because" they are very good to the black fellows." The Abipones of Brazil regard them with pride as their ancestors. Elsewhere, the origin of fire and the knowlmge of rice-culture are traced to them. They are the "luJeiing-dan n of South Africa, take the place of a farming-calendar to the Solomon Islanders, and their last visible rising after sunset is, or has been, celebrated with rejoicings all over the southern hemisphere as betokening the" waking-up time" to agricultural activity.
They also were a sign to ancient husbandmen as to the seeding-time; Vergil alluding to this in his 1st Georgie, thus rendered by May:
Some that before the fall 'oth' Pleiades Began to sowe, deceaved in the increase, Have reapt wilde oates for wheate.
And, many centuries before him, Hesiod said that their appearance from the sun indicated the approach of harvest, and their setting in autumn the time for the new sowing; while Aristotle wrote that honey was never gathered before their rising. Nearly all classical poets and prose writers made like reference to them. Mommsen found in their rising, from the 21st to the 25th of the Attic month 8apy11i..iwv, May-June, the occasion for the prehistoric festival m.vv-rqpia, Athene's Clothes-washing, at the beginning of the corn harvest, and the date for the annual election of the Achaeans ; while Drach surmised that their midnight culmination in the time of Moses, ten days after the autumnal equinox, may have fixed the day of atonement on the 10th of Tishri. Their rising in November marked the time for worship of deceased friends by many of the original races of the South,- a custom also seen with more civilized peoples, notably among the Parsis and Sabaeans, as also in the Druids' midnight rites of the 1st of November; while a recollection of it is found in the three holy days of our time, All Hallow Eve, All Saints' Day, and All Souls' Day. Hippocrates made much of the Pleiades, dividing the year into four sea,;ons, all connected with their positions in relation to the sun; his winter beginning with their setting and ending with the spring equinox; spring lasting till their rising; the summer, from their appearing to the rising of Arcturus; and the autumn, till their setting again. And Caesar made their heliacal rising begin the Julian summer, and their cosmical setting the commencement of winter. In classic lore the Pleiades were the heavenly group 26



Star-Names and their Meanings
chosen with the sun by Jove to manifest his power in favor of Atreus by causing them to move from east to west. Notwithstanding, however, all that we read so favorable to the high regard in which these stars were held, they were considered by the astrologers as portending blindness and accidents to sight, a reputation shared "ith all other clusters. The Arabs, especially, thought their Cony days' disappearance in the sun's rays was the occasion of great harm to mankind, and Mul}.ammad wrote that" when the star rises all harm rises from the earth." But Hippocrates had differently written in his Epidemics, a thousand yeaIS before, of the connection of the Pleiades with the weather, and of their influence on diseases of autumn:
until the season of the Pleiades, and at the approach of winter, many ardent fevers set in;
.\
and: in autumn, and under the Pleiades, again there died great numbers.
Although the many legends of their origin are chiefly from Mediterranean countries, yet the Teutonic nations have a very singular one associated with our Saviour. It says that once, when passing by a baker's shop, and attracted by the odor of newly baked bread, He asked for a loaf; but being refused by the baker, was secretly supplied by the wife and six daughters standing by. In reward they were placed in the sky as the Seven Stars, while the baker became a cuckoo; 1 and so long as he sings in the spring, from Saint Tiburtius' Day, April 14th, to Saint John's Day, June 24th,his wife and daughters are visible. Following this story, the Pleiades are the Gaelic Crannarain, the Baker's Peel, or Shovel, a title shared with Ursa Major. Another, still homelier, but appropriately feminine, name is hinted at in Holland's translation from the Historia Natura/is, where Pliny treats of " the star Vergiliae " :
So evident in the heaven, and easiest to be known of all others, it is called by the nD1t of a garment hanging out at a Broker's shop.
Those who have traced out the origin of the title Petticoat Lane for the well-known London street will recognize what Pliny had in mind. In various ages their title has been taken for noteworthy groups ofseren in philosophy or literature. This we see first in the Philosophical Pleiad of 620 to 550 B. c., otherwise known as the Seven Wise Men of Greece. or the Seven Sages, generally given as Bias, Chilo, Cleobulus, Epimenides or
1 May it not be from this that comes the English term " Cuckoo Bread," that we find in Mn. Dana's and Miss Satterlee's delightful book, HUUJ to KtUTW tAe Wild Flor«n, for the Juncftowering Oxaiis, the dainty Wood Sorrel of our northern ~ves?

Periander, Pittacus, Solon, and the astronomer Thales; again in the Alexandrian Literary Pleiad, or the Tragic Pleiades, instituted in the 3d century B. c. by Ptolemy Philadelphus, and composed of the seven contemporary poets, variously given, but often as Apolloni"us of Rhodes, Callimachus or Philiscus, Homer the Younger of Hierapolis in Caria, Lycophron, Nicander, Theocritus, and our Aratos; in the Literary Pleiad of Charlemagne, himselfone of the Seven; in the Great Pleiade of France, of the 16th century, brought together in the reign of Henri III, some say by Ronsard, the "Prince of Poets," others by d'Aurat, or Dorat, the" Modem Pindar," called " Auratus,'' either in punning allusion to his name or from the brilliancy of his genius, and the " Dark Star," from his silence among his companions; and in the Lesser Pleiade, of inferior lights, in the subsequent reign of Louis XIII. Lastly appear the Pleiades of Connecticut, the popular, perhaps ironical, designation for the seven patriotic poets after our Revolutionary War : Richard Alsop, Joel Barlow, Theodore Dwight, Timothy Dwight, Lemuel Hopkins, David Humphreys, and John Trumbull,- all good men of Yale. I have not been able to learn when, and by whom, the titles of the seven sisters were applied to the individual stars as we have them; but now they are catalogued nine in all, the parents being included. These last, however, seem to be a comparatively modern addition, the first mention of them that I find-in Riccioli's Almagestum Novum of 1651 - reading:
~lichael Florentius Langrenius 1 illarum exactam figuram observavit, & ad me misit, in qua additae sunt duae Stellae aliis innominatae, quas ipse vocal Atlantem, & Pleionem; nescio an sinl illae, quas Vendelinus ait observari tanquam novas, quia modii apparent, modo latent. • • • the great and burning star, Immeasurably old, immeasurably far, Surging forth its silver flame Through eternity, ••• Alcyone!

1), or Fl. 25, 31 greenish yellow.
Alcyone represents in the sky the Atlantid nymph who became the mother ofHyrieus by Poseidon; but, though now the Light of the Pleiadea, its mythological original was by no means considered the most beautiful. Riccioli wrote the word ..&.laione and ..&.loinoe, and some early manuscripts have..&.ltione. The early Arabs called it Al lauz, the Walnut; Al lauzah or Al Wua; the Central One; and Al lia'ir, the Bright One ;-all of Al Thurayya. The

later Al Achsasi added to this list Thaur al Thurayya, which, literally the Bull of the Pleiades, ;, e. the Leading One, probably was a current title in his day, for his Italian contemporary Riccioli said, in his Astrr»uMilz RejQTmata, that the ludda "Alcinoe" was Altorioh Mn Athorrio. Hipparchos has been supposed to allude to it in his o§tir, and o~TaTOf, 7"!K" IUe,ddor, the Bright One, and the Brightest One, of the PJeiad. Yet, in the face of these epithets, Ptolemy apparently did not mention it in the Sy11t0%is~· while Baily, in his edition of Hyde's translation of UJug Beg's 1a6ks, affixed Flam.steed's 25 and Bayer's f/ to the 32d star of Taurus, which is described as ski/a externa minula vergiliarum, 9uae est ad lahls 6oreale,-our Atlas.
In Babylonia it determined the 4th ecliptic constellation, Temeuu, the Foundation Stone. In India it was the junction star of the nakshatras Krittika and Rohini, and individually Amba, the Mother; while Hewitt says that in earlier Hindu literature it was .Anmdhati, wedded to Vashisht}ia, the chief of the Seven Sages, as her sisters were to the six other Risbis of Ursa Major; and that every newly married couple worshiped them on first entering their future home before they worshiped the pole-star. He thinks this a symbol of the prehistoric union of the northern and southern tribes of India. We often see the assertion that our title is in no way connected 11-ith 'AAtevwv, the Halcyon, that "symbolic or ·mystical bird, early identified with the Kingfisher," the ornithological Akedo or Ceryle / so that although the myth of the Halcyon Days, that "clement and temperate time, the nurse of the beautiful Halcyon,"
When birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave,
is not yet understood, some of Thompson's conjectures as to its stellar . aspect will be found interesting. He writes that
the story originally referred to some astronomical phenomenon, probably in connexion with the Pleiades, of which constellation Alcyone is the principal star. In what appears to have been the most vigorous period of ancient astronomy (not later than 2000 8, c., but continuing long afterwards to influence legend and nomenclature) the sun rose al the vernal equinox, in conjunction with the Pleiad, in the sign Taurus: the Pleiad is in many languages associated with bird-names , , , and I am inclined to take the bird on the bull's back in coins of Eretria, Dicaea, and Thurii for the associated constellation of the Pleiad. ••• Suidas definitely asserts that the Pleiades were called 'A.Mv6vq-. At the winter sol• stice, in the same ancient epoch, the Pleiad culminated at nightfall in mid-heaven.. , • This culmination, between three and four months after the beliacal rising of the Pleiad in Autumn, was, I conjecture, symbolized as the nesting of the Halcyon. Owing to the an· tiquity and corruption of the legend, it is impossible to hazard more than a conjecture; but that the phenomenon was in some form an astronomic one I have no doubt.



The Constellations
Madler located in Alcyone the centre of the universe, but his theory has been shown to be fallacious. There is no satisfactory reason for his conclusion, and not much more for Miss Clerke's remarks as to the probable size and distance of Alcyone,- that it shines to its sister stars with eightythree times the lustre of Sirius in terrestrial skies, while its intrinsic brilliancy, as compared with that of the sun, is 1000 times greater. All this rests upon the extremely doubtful assumption of a parallax of 0 11.013 deduced from the star's proper motion. It culminates on the 31st of December. The three little companions, easily visible with a low-power, form a beautiful triangle 3' away from Alcyone.

](aia appears in the motto as personifying all the Pleiad stars, and the poet cautions the farmer against sowing his grain before the time of its setting. She was the first-born and most beautiful of the sisters, and some have said that her star was the most luminous of the group; in fact, Riccioli, in his Almagestum Novum, distinctly wrote of Maia: dicta lucida Pleiatlum & krtii honoris, 9uae mater Mercurii perlti/Jetur, although in the Astronomia Reformata his " Alcinoe " is the lucida ; so that we are uncertain which of these stars was the Pleiaa that he used for some one of the group. But the mythological importance of the goddess whose name Maia bears would indicate that Riccioli may have been correct as to the first of these identifications, and that the titles of the two stars perhaps should be interchanged. The name also is written Kea and Kaja, the feminine form of majus, an older form of 11,agnus. Cicero had the word J[ajja, calling the Pleiad saNtissima, for in his day Maia was only another figure for the great and much named Rhea-Cybele, Fauna, Faula, Fatua, Ops, familiarly known as Ma, or Maia Maiestas, the Bona Dea, or Great and Fruitful Mother, who gave name to the Roman month, our May. Ovid added to her title Pleiu uda, the Moist Pleiad, as another symbol for the group; and Dante used her title for the planet Mercury, as the Atlantid was mother of that god. The equivalent Kaou, for the Pleiades in China, is singularly like the Latin word. 26•

BJ.eotra, although for at least two or three centuries the title of a clearly visible star, has been regarded as the Lost Pleiad, from the legend that she withdrew her light in sorrow at witnessing the destruction of Ilium, which was founded by her son Dardanos,- as witness Ovid in the Fasti.
Electra Trojae spectare ruinas Non tulit ante oculos, opposuitque manum;
or, as Hyginus wrote, left her place to be present at its fall, thence wandering off as a hair-star, or comet; or, reduced in brilliancy, settled down close to Mizar as 'A).wrr11E, the Fox, the Arabs' Al Suha, and our Alcor. In the Harleian Ma11uscript the word is written Bleata.
Ovid called her Atlantia, personifying the family. The Pirt-Kopan-noot tribe of Australia have a legend of a Lost Pleiad. making this the queen of the other six, beloved by their heavenly Crow, our Canopus, and who, carried away by him, never returned to her home.

Xerope often is considered the Lost Pleiad, because, having married a mortal, the crafty Sisyphus, she hid her face in shame when she thought of her sisters' alliances with the gods, and realized that she had thrown herself away. She seems, however, to have recovered her equanimity, being now much brighter than some of the others. The name itself signifies "Mortal." This star is enveloped in a faintly extended, triangular, nebulous haze, visually discovered l>y Tempel in October, 1859; and there is a small, distinct nebula, discovered by Barnard in November, 1890, close by Merope, almost hidden in its radiance, although intrinsically very bright.

Atlu was Pater Atlu with Riccioli, apparently having been added in his day to the original group of the seven daughters. It was of him that Ovid wrote: Pleiades incipiunt umeros relevare paternos;
for their setting relieved the father of some of his burden as bearer of the heavens. With Pleione it marks the end of the handle of the Pleiad Dipper, and probably has a very minute, close companion, said to have been discovered by Struve in 18271 and again revealed, at an occultation by the moon, on the 6th of January, 1876.

Pleione, Riccioli's ][ater Plmone, and Plione, were equally modem additions, although Valerius Flaccus used the word to personify the whole. As the spectrum of this star shows the bright lines of hydrogen like that of P Cygni, Pickering suggests that it may similarly have had a tempomy brilliancy and thus be the Lost Pleiad: a scientific and- if there ever ha;; been in historic time a star in the cluster that is now missing - the most probable solution of this much discussed question; so that the mother seems to have been lost, as well as many of the daughters! The Harl~ian Man11script of Cicero's Aratos represents the Sisters by plain female heads under the title VII .Pliades et Athlantides, and indi,;dually as Merope, Alcyone, Celaeno, Electra, Ta Ygete, Sterope, and Maia.1 Grotius has them in the same way, but in far more attractive style, from

The Constel1ations
the old Leydm Manuscript, where we find the orthography Asterope and Mea, the former of which, appearing with Germanicus, has become common in our day. The German manuscript, dating from the 15th century, shows seven full-length figures, the Dark Sister smaller than the others, and wearing a dark-blue head-dress, the rest brighter in color, with faces of true German type. While this list includes all the named Pleiad stars, some practically invisible without optical aid, yet every increase of power reveals a larger number. Riccioli wrote about this in 1651:
Telescopio autem spectatae visae sunt Galileo plus quam 40. ut narratur in Nuncio Sidereo;
a first-rate field-glass, taking in 3j,(0 and magnifying seven diameters, shows 57; Hooke, in 1664, saw 78 with the best telescope of his day; Swift sees 300 with his 4_1⁄2-inch, and 600 with his 16-inch; and Wolf catalogued, at the Paris Observatory in 1876, 625 in a space of 90' by 135'. But with the camera the Messrs. Henry photographed 1421 in 1885, and two years later, by a four-hours' exposure, 2326 down to the 16th magnitude within three square degrees,- more than are visible at any one time by the naked eye in the whole sky. And a recent photograph by Bailey, with the Bruce telescope, reveals 3972 stars in the region 2° square around Alcyone; although there is no certainty that all of these belong to the Pleiades group. Statements as to their magnitudes and distances make many of them exceed Sirius in size, and to be 250 light years away; but these are based upon an assumption of parallax as yet only hypothetical. But, if correct, how appropriate are Young's verses in his Night Thoughts:
How distant some of these nocturnal Suns ! So distant (says the Sage) 'twere not absurd To doubt, if Beams set out at Nature's Birth, Are yet arrived at this so foreign World Tho' nothing half so rapid as their Flight;
and Longfellow's stanza in his Ode lo Charles Sumner:
Were a star quenched on high, For ages would its light, Still travelling downward from the sky, Shine on our mortal sight.
While some of these undoubtedly are only optically connected with the true Pleiades, yet the larger part seem to form a more or less united group,

which the spectroscope shows to be of the same general type; this fact being first brought out by Harvard observers in 1886, from comparisons of the spectra of forty of its stars. They are supposed to be drifting together toward the south-southwest, and so may be called a natural constellation. Nicander wrote of them as oll{wvar, "the smaller ones"; Manilius, as terlia Jonna, "the third-sized"; and many think that the light of some bas decreased, no~ only from the legends of the Lost Pleiad and the fact that some of the sisters' names are applied to stars which could not possibly have been seen by the unaided eye, but also because only six are now visible to the average observer, and whoever can see seven can as readily see at least two more. Miss Airy counted twelve; Mr. Dawes, thirteen; and Kepler said that his scholar Michel Mostlin could distinguish founeen, and had correctly mapped eleven before the invention of the telescope, while others have done about as well; indeed Carl von Littrow has seen sixteen. In the clear air of the tropic highlands more of the group are visible than to us in northern latitudes,- from the Harvard observing station at Arequipa, Peru, eleven being readily seen; so that Willis was unconsciously right in his verses :
Smyth wrote :
the link~ Pleiades Undimm'd are there, thongh from the sister band The fairest has gone down ; and South away !
If we admit the influence of· variability at long periods, the seven in number may hue been more distinct, so that while Homer and Attalus speak of six, HipparchllS and Antas may properly mention seven.
Yet we find Humboldt, in Cosmos, saying that Hipparchos refuted the assertion of Aratos that only six are to be seen with the naked eye, and that
One star escaped his attention, for when the eye is attentively fixed on this constellation, on a serene and moonless night, seven stars are visible,
But Aratos' words do not justify this statement as to his opinion. He wrote:
seven paths aloft men say they take, Yet six alone are viewed by mortal eyes. From Zeus' abode no star unknown is lost Since first from birth we heard, but thus the tale is told;



The Constellations 411
this " seven paths," brTrirropo,, being first found in the 'P71a~ attributed to Euripides. Eratosthenes called it nk,rJ.r eTTTaO'Tepor, the Seven-starred Pleiad, although he described one as Ilava(/>a""Jr, All-invisible; Ovid repeated from the .Pl,ainomma the now trite
Quae septem dici, sex tamen esse solent ; and again:
Six only are visible, but the seventh is beneath the dark clouds.
Cicero thought of them in the same way; and Galileo wrote Dico aule111 sex,
vuando (jllidem septima /ere nunq11am apparel. But the early Copts knew them as '"EfaaTpov, the Six-starred Asterism, and many Hindu legends mention only six. Discarding, of course, all the mythical explanations of the Lost Pleiad, I would notice some of the modem and serious attempts at an eluci_dation of the supposed phenomenon. Dqctor Charles Anthon considered it founded solely upon the imagination, and not upon any accurate observation in antiquity. Jensen thinks that, as a favorite object in Babylonia, the astronomers of that country attached to it, with no regard to exactitude, their number of perfection or completeness, 7 playing with them a more important part even than it did among the Jews; thence it descended to Greece, where, its origin being lost sight of, was caused the discrepancy which we cannot now explain, as well as the legends and folk-lore on the subject. Lamb asserted that the astronomers of Assyria could see in their sky seven stars in the group, and so described them; but the Greeks, less favorably situated, finding only six, invented the story of the missing sister. Riccioli propounded a theory-which I have nowhere found adopted by any later writer-that the seventh and missing Pleiad may have been a 1IOVa appearing before that number was recorded by observers, but extinguished about the date of the Trojan war; this last idea accounting, too, for the association of Electra with the lost one. Still another explanation is hinted at by Thompson under Coma Berenices; and the really scientific theories of Smyth and Pickering have already been noticed. It is in these last two, I think, that the solution of this interesting question will be found, if at all; and with the astronomers I would leave it, as perhaps I ought to have done before. Ptolemy mentioned IlArnir for only four stars in Taiipor that Baily said were Flamsteed's 18, 19, 23, and 27, our Alcyone singularly being disregarded, as well as four others of our named stars; and Al Sufi, who revised Ptolemy's observations, stated that this "Alexandrian Quartette" also were

the brightest in his day - the 10th century. But Ulug Beg, although he is supposed to have followed Ptolemy, applied" Al Thurayya" to the five that Baily said were Fl. 19, 23, 21, 22, and 25 (Alcyone). Baily himself, editing Hyde's translation of Ulug Beg, gave only Fl. 19 and 23 as of " Al ThurajL"
Recent photographic observations have revealed other nebulous matter, in different degrees of condensation, scattered throughout the cluster, connecting its various members; while Barnard in 1894 found vast nebulosity extending almost as far as { Persei. The Pleiades afford so convincing a proof of the popular misapprehension as to the moon's apparent magnitude that I am tempted to introduce another illustration drawn from these stars. The angular distance between Alcyone and Electra and between Merope and Taygeta is greater by several minutes than the mean angular diameter of the moon's disc,- 31' 7",so that the latter could be inserted within the quadrangle formed by those four stars with plenty of room to spare ; al~hough in looking at the cluster the impression is that our satellite would cover the whole. An occultation of the Pleiades by the moon gives a vivid realization of this fact; and as this is a not infrequent phenomenon, I commend its observation to any unbeliever.

in 1777 by the Abb~ Poczobut, of Wilna, in honour of Stanislaus Poniatowski, King of Poland; a formal permission to that effect having been obtained from the French Academy. It is between the shoulder of Ophiuchus and the Eagle, where some stars form the letter V, and from a fancied resemblance to the zodiac-bull and the Hyades, became another Taurus. Poczobut was content with seven component stars, but Bode has scraped together no fewer than eighty,
of course chiefly telescopic, for only 20 to 25 are visible to the unaided eye; but as a distinct constellation it is not generally recognized by astronomers, and its stars have been returned to Ophiuchus. We have no individual names for any of these, but sundry small ones in the head were the Chinese Tnng Ting, or Tnng lin, a Relative. A century and a half before Poczobut's time these stars, with those of our Vulpecula, had been introduced by Bartsch into his plates as the River Tigril, although this probably had previously been a recognized constellation. Its course was from {3 and y, in the right shoulder of Ophiuchus, onwards between Aquila and the left hand of Hercules; thence between Albireo (IJ Cygni) and Sagitta to Equuleus and the front parts of Pegasus, ending at the latter's neck. This Tigris continued until as late as 1679 with Royer, but has long since disappeared from the maps, and indeed from the memory of most observers; while the Royal Bull itself seems to be lapsing into similar obscurity. Three or four centuries before all this the Arabian engraver of the Borgian globe appropriately represented the stars of this constellation by a triangular lgare.

fied as major till the Lesser Triangle was discarded. It lies just south from y Andromedae on the edge of the Milky Way, and although small and faint notwithstanding our poet's description, is one of the old constellations evidently more noticed by the ancients than by us. They drew it as equilateral, but now it is a scalene figure, /3, d, y at the base and a at the vertex. Hood strangely said that it was placed in the heavens only that the head of Aries might be better known, which recalls the blunder of Aratos as to the faintness of Aries' stars. It was ~elTwT6v with the earlier Greeks, from their similarly shaped letter 11, to which Ovid in his Nwc likened it; as did Aratos in his lines that Brown renders, more literally than rhythmically:
Below Andromeda, in three sides measured Like-to-a-Delta; equal two of them As it has, less the third, yet good to find The sign, than many better stored with stars.
Transcribed by Cicero and Hyginus as Deltoton, it became Deltotum with the Romans, as well as with astronomers to the 17th century. Naturally it also was Delta, and so, associated with Egypt and the Nile, became .legyptu, llilu, llili Dom.um, the Home of the Nile, which originally was :lili Donum, the Gift of the Nile, from Herodotus' TrOTaμov dwpov, "the river's gift." Tpiywvov, used by Hipparchos and Ptolemy, became Trigonum with Vitruvius, and Trigonua with Manilius, translated Trigon by Creech. Tricupia, Three-pointed, and Triquetrom, the Trinal Aspect of astrology, are found for it; while Bayer had Triplioitas and Orbi1 terrarum. tripertitu.1 as representing the three parts of the earth, Europe, Asia, and Africa; and Tri&ngulua Septentrionalia, to distinguish it from his own Southern Triangle. Pious people of his day said that it showed the Trinity, its shape resembling the Greek initial letter of .111~; while others of the same sort likened it to the Kitre of Saint Peter. Its titles Bioilia, Trinacria, and Triquetra are those of the ancients for the similarly shaped island of Sicily,- that Ceres had begged of Jove might be reproduced in the sky,- triangular from its three promontories, Lilybaeum, Pelorus, and Pachynus, and at times identified with the mythical Thrinakia of the Odyssey, the pasture-ground of the Oxen of the Sun, that Gower called Mela's Holy Ox-land. In modem days it has been noted as the site of the famous Palermo Observatory.

Perhaps the astronomers have exhausted their classical dictionaries! It was found 1 as an 8th-magnitude starFlammarion says as a comet - between Aries and Taurus, coincidently not far from our Triangulum, the ancient Siailia; but it was little imagined at the time that 433 similar bodies would be found in the next ninety-seven years, more than 150 of them since 1892, and all but seven of these last by photography,2 then an unknown art. The Arabi~ translated our title as Al Kuthallath, variously seen in Western usage as Alm.utallath, Alm.utaleh, Alm.utlato, Kutl&t, •utlatn, Kutlathum, KutlathllD, and Kutlatun, with probably still other similarly degenerated forms of the original. The Jews are said to have known it as Shilfah, from the name of an instrument of music of triangular shape, or with three cords, mentioned in the ut Book of Samuel, xviii, 6. This same figure, for the three bright stars of Aries, has already been noticed at y of that constellation. Heis enumerates here 30 naked-eye components, but Argelandcr only 15.

Recent measurements by Barnard show that Ceres is only a little less than sao milts i• diameter, and thus the first in size of the minor planets as in order of discovery. I The first of such discoveries by the camera was by Wolf on the 20th of December, 1'91, of Brucia, No. 323; the first applications of the new art to the heavens having been made widl ' the daguerreotype process by Doctor John W. Draper, of New York City, on the lllOOII in 1B4o; again, by the professional Whipple of Boston, under Bond"s direction, at the HaJTanl Observatory, on the star Wega in 1850; and at the same place on Mixar and Alcor in 1SS7. The first photograph of a star's spectrum was in 1872; of a nebula, in 188o; of a comet (OW the sun during the latter's total eclipse), in 188a; and of a meteor, in 111gI.

Caesius cited names for it drawn from the older constellation, among them Almutabet algenubi Arabice neoterids, which would show that either the Arabians had anticipated Bayer, or were very prompt to learn of his \\·ork. But he also called it the Three Patriarchl, doubtless Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from its three prominent stars; and Julius Schiller had recourse to their descendants for his alphabetical title Signum Tau. . Proctor catalogued it as plain Triangulum, the Northem Triangle being one of his Triangula. The French, Germans, and Italians exactly translate the Latin words. The Chinese equivalent is San Xiii Hung. The constellation lies south of Ara, between the tail of Pavo and the fore feet of the Centaur, Gould assigning to it 46 components down to the 7th magnitude.

In the 17th century the English called it the Bruilian PJe, but Caesius gave it the geographically incorrect Pica Inclica; while Kepler, Riccioli. and even later authors knew it as the ADier Ameriaallu, a title that appears as late as Stieler's planisphere of 1872, in the Ameriaall Gau. Tucana lies immediately south of Phoenix, bordering on the south polar Octans, its tail close to the bright Achernar of Eridanus, and marks the crossing of the equinoctial colure and the antarctic circle.

the Gn.n.ie Omw of the French, the Ona Kaggiore of the Italians, and the Groae Bitr of the Germans, always has been the best known of the stellar groups, appearing in every extended reference to the heavens in the legends, parchments, tablets, and stones of remotest times. And Sir George Cornewall Lewis, quoting allusions to it by Aristotle, Strabo, and many other classical writers, thinks, from Homer's line,
Arctos, sole star th■ l never bathes in th' ocean wave
(by reason of precession it then was much nearer the pole than it now is), that this was the only portion of the arctic sky that in the poet's time had been reduced to constellation form. This statement, however, refers solely to the Greeks; for even before Homer's day we know that earlier nations had here their own stellar groups; yet we must remember that the "Apn~ and "Aμ,afa of the Iliad and Odyssey consisted of but the seven stars, and that these alone bore those names till Thales formed our Ursa Minor. Later on the figure was enlarged "for the purpose of uranographic completeness," so that Heis now catalogues 227 components visible to his naked eye, although only 140 appeared to Argelander, down to the 6th magnitude. It is almost the first object to which the attention of beginners in asttonomy is called,- a fact owing partly to its circumpolar position for all points above the 41st parallel rendering it always and entirely visible above that latitude, but very largely to its great extent and to the striking conformation of its prominent stars. It is noticeable, too, that all early catalogues commenced with the two Ursine constellations. Although the group has many titles and mythical associations, it has almost everywhere been known as a Bear, usually in the feminine, from its legendary origin. All classic writers, from Homer to those in the decline of Roman literature, thus mentioned it,- a universality of consent as to its fonn which, it.has fancifully been said, may have arisen from Aristotle's idea that its prototype was the only creature that dared invade the frozen North.

420 Star-Names and their Meanings
Yet it is remarkable that the Teutonic nations did not know this stelbr group under this shape, although the animal was of course familiar to !hem and made much of in story and worship. With them these stars were the Wagen, our familiar Wain. Aratos wrote in the PltaintJNUna:
Two Bears Called Wains move ro11nd it, either in her place;
Ovid, in the 7ristia, Jfagna minorque ferae; and Propertius included both in hi~ Geminae Unae; while Horace, Vergil, and Ovid, again, called them
Oelidae Aroti. We also meet with Arctoi and Arotoe. The Anglo-Sawn Manual of Astronomy of the 10th century adopted the Greek .lretol, although it adds "which untaught men call Carlea-wmn"; rare old Ber. Jonson, in 1609, in his Epicoe,u, or the Silent Woman, called Kallisto
a star Jllltna Unala in the heavens;
and La Lande cited Fera major, Filia Unae, and Una cnun pum,ilo, referring to Areas. The well-known, although varied, story of KalltaTw,- as old as Hesiod', time,- who was changed to a bear because of Juno's jealousy and tran,.. ferred to the skies by the regard of Jove, has given rise to much poetical allusion from Hesiod's day till ours, especially among the Latins. In Addison's translation of Ovid's Metamorpltoses, where this myth is related. we read that Jove snatched them through the air In whirlwinds up to heaven and fix'd them there; Where the new constellations nightly rise, And add a lustre to the northern ~kies ;
although the dissatisfied Juno still complained that in this location they
proudly roll In their new orbs and brighten all the pole.
This version of the legend turned Kallisto's son Areas into Ursa Minor. although he was Bootes; Matthew Arnold correctly writing of the mothtr and son in his Merope:
The Gods bad pity, made them Stars. Stars now they sparkle In the northern Heaven The guard Arcturus, The guard-watch'd Bear.



The Constellations 421
Another version substituted her divine mistress •ApTe,-ur - also known to the Greeks as KaAA.iaT71, the Roman Diana - for the nymph of the celestial transformation; the last Greek word well describing the extreme beauty of this constellation. La Lande, however, referred the title to the Phoenician Kalitaah, or Chalita, Safety, as its observation helped to a safe voyage. Among its names from the old story are Kallilto herself; Lyoaonia, Lycaonia Puella, Lyoaonia Arctos, from her father, or grandfather, king of the aboriginal race that was known as late as Saint Paul's day, with the distinct dialect alluded to in the Acts of the Apostles, xiv, 11; Dianae Comes and Phoebes ](ilea are from her companionship in arms with that goddess; and it was one of the arctos oceani metuentes aequore tingi,
because Tethys, at Juno's instigation, had forbidden Kallisto to enter her watery dominions. Yet Camoes, from a lower latitude, wrote of Al U:nu:
We saw the Bears, despite of Juno, lave Their tardy bodies in the boreal wave.
Ovid's arctos ae9uoris expertes; immunem9ue ae9uoris Ardon; li9uidiljue immunia ponti, and utra9ue sicca, were from the fact that, being circumpolar, neither of the Bears sets below the ocean horizon. This was a favorite conceit of the poets, and astronomically correct during millenniums before and centuries after Homer's day, although not so in recent times as to the Greater, except in high latitudes. Chaucer reproduced this in his rendering of the De Consolatwne Philosophiae by Boetius, whom he styles Boece:
Xe the sterre y-cleped" the Bere," that enclyneth his ravisshinge courses abouten the soverein heighte of the worlde, ne the same sterre Ursa nis never-mo wasshen in the depe westrcne see, ne coveiteth nat to deyen his ftaumbe in the see of the occian, al-thogh he see other sterres y-plounged in the see;

The Bear that sees star setting after star In the blue brine, descends not to the deep.
Poetical titles induced by the legend of Areas were Virgo llonacrina and Tegeua Virgo, from the Arcadian towns Nonacris and Tegea ; Brymanthi1, perhaps the Erymanthian Boar that Hercules slew, but more probably the Erymanthian Bear; Kaenalia Arctol, Jlaenali■, and Jlaenali■ Una, from those mountains; Parrhui■, Parrhuia Virgo, and Parrhuide■ Stellae, from 27•

the tribe, although Pluche went farther back for this to the Phoenician pilots' Parruil, the Guiding Star,- the Hebrews' Pharuhah. Sophocles wrote of it in the Oedipus as Araacli:am. Sidu, referring to the whole country of Arcadia, the Switzerland of Greece, famous in the classical world for its wild mountain scenery; and very early silver coins of Mantinea showed the Bear as mother of the patron god. Such has been the myth of this constellation current for at least three millenniums; but Mueller discards it all, and says:
The legend of Kallisto, the beloved of Zeus and mother of Arkas, has nothing 10 do 111th the original meaning of the stars. On the contrary, Kallisto was supposed to have bttn changed into the Arktos or Greater Bear because she was the mother of Arkas, that is to s:iy, of the Arcadian 1 or bear race, and her name, or that of her son, reminded the Grtth of their long established name of the n~rthem constellation.
Aratos' version of the legend, from very ancient Naxian tradition, made the two Bears the Cretan nurses of the infant Jupiter, afterwards raised to heaven for their devotion to their charge. From this came the Crttuae live Arotoe of Germanicus; but Lewis said :
This fable is inconsistent with the natural history of the island; for the ancients testify that Crete never contained any bears or other no:r.ious animals.
Subsequent story changed the nurses into the Cretan nymphs Helice and Melissa. Hyginus and Germanicus also used the masculine form Unu as well asArctua. .
The Hebrew word 'Alh or 'Ayiah in the Book of Jo/J, ix, 9, and XXX\'ID, 32, supposed to refer to the Square in this constellation as a Bier, not a Bear, was translated .Arotur1II by Saint Jerome in the Vulgate; and this was adopted in the version of 1611 authorized by King James. Hence the popular belief that the Bi/Jk mentions our star a Bootis; but Umbreit had already corrected this to " the Bear and her young," and in the Revision of 1885 the patriarch talks to us of "the Bear with her train," these latter being represented by the three tail stars. Von Herder strangely ren· dered the first of these passages" Libra and the Pole Star, the Seven Siar.;"; but the second, more correctly, as " the Bear with her young " feeding around the pole; or, by another tradition, the nightly wanderer, a mother of the stars seeking her lost children,- those that no longer are visible. The

Breeches Bi/Jle has this marginal note to its word Arcturus : "The North Star, with those that are about him." Hebrew observers called the constellation Dibh; Phoenician, Dub; and Arabian, Al Dubb al Akbar, the Greater Bear,- Dubhelaobar with Bayer and Dub Alacber with Chilmead,- all of these perhaps adopted from Greece. Caesius cited the " Mohammedans'" Dubbe, Dubhe, and Duben; and Robert Browning, in his Jod,anan Hakkatlosl,, repeated these as Dob.
But whence came the same idea into the minds of our North American Indians? Was it by accident? or is it evidence ofa common origin in the far antiquity of Asia? The conformation of the seven stars in no way resembles the animal,- indeed the contrary; yet they called them Otuari and Paukunawa, words for a "bear," before they were visited by the white men, as is attested by Le Clercq in 1691, by the Reverend Cotton Mather in 1712, by the Jesuit missionary La Fitau in 1724, and by the French traveler Charlevoix in 1744. And Bancroft wrote in his history of our country:
The red men ••• did not divide the heavens, nor even a belt in the heavens, into constellations. It is a curious coinciden~, that among the Algonquins of the Atlantic and of the Mississippi, alike among the Narragansetts and the Illinois, the North Star was called the Bear.
In justice, however, to their familiarity with a bear's anatomy, it should be said that the impossible tail of our Ursa was to them either Three Hunten, or a Hunter with his two Dop, in pursuit of the creature; the star Alcor being the pot in which they would cook her. They thus avoided the incongruousness of the present astronomical ideas of Bruin's make-up, although their cooking-utensil was inadequate. The Housatonic Indians, who roamed over that valley from Pittsfield through Lenox and Stockbridge to Great Barrington, said that this chase of the stellar Bear lasted from the spring till the autumn, when the animal was wounded and its blood plainly seen in the foliage of the forest. The long tail of the Bear, a queer appendage to a comparatively tailless animal, is thus accounted for by old Thomas Hood in his didactic style :
Sd1olar.
1 marvell why (seeing she hath the forme of a beare) her tail should be so long. Ma,t~r.
Imagine that Jupiter, fearing to come too nigh unto her teeth, layde holde on her tayle, and thereby drewe her up into the heaven; so that shee of herself being very weightie, and the distance from the earth to the heavens very great, there was great likelihood that her taile must stretch. Other reason know I none.

My friend the Reverend Doctor Robert M. Luther of Newark, New Jersey, tells me that a similar story was current with the Pennsylvania Germans of forty years ago. The same " weightie" reason will apply equally well to the Smaller Bear; indeed the latter's tail is even proportionately longer. although the kink in it takes a different turn. It is probably this association of these Seven Stars with our aborigines that has given them the occasional title of the Seven Little Inclianl.
Trevisa derived the title thus: " alwey thoo sterres wyndeth and turneth rounde aboute that lyne, that is calde Axis, as a here aboute the stake. And therefore that cercle is clepid the more here." Boteler borrowed this for his Hudi/Jras :
And round about the pole does make A circle like a bear at stake.
The great epic of the Finns, the Kalewala, makes much of this constellation, styling it Otawa and Otawainen, in which Miss Clerke sees likeness to the names used by our aborigines for "the great Teutonic King of beasts." But that people also said that the Bear stars, and especially the pole-star, were young and beautiful maidens highly skilled in spinning and weaving,- a story originating from a fancied resemblance of their rays of light to a weaver's web. The Century Dictionary has a theory as to the origin of the idea of a Bear for these seven stars, doubtless from its editor, Professor Whitney. that seems plausible,- at all events, scholarly. It is that their Sanskrit designation, H.ikaha, signifies, in two different genders, "a Bear," and "a Star:· "Bright," or" to shine,"- hence a title, the Seven Shiners,- so that it would appear to have come, by some confusion of sound, of the two words among a people not familiar with the animal. Later on Riksha was confounded with the word Riahi, and so connected with the Seven Sap, or Paeta, of India; afterwards with the Seven Wile Ken of Greece, the 8neD Sleepen of Ephesus, the Seven Champion■ of Chri■tendom, etc.; while the Seven Stan of early authors, as often used for Ursa Major as for the Pleiades, certainly is much more appropriate to the Ursine figure than to the Taurine. Minsheu had" the Seven Starres called Charles Waine in the North," and three centuries earlier Chaucer wrote of" the sterres seven~ with manifest reference to this constellation. The Kakwa/a had the equivalent Seitaen tahtinen; the Portuguese Camoes, Sete Flaumw; and the Turks, Yidigher Yildu.
Hewitt says that these seven stars at first were known in India as lleffll Bears, although also as Seven Antelope■, and again as Seven Balli, the latter merged into one, the Great Spotted Bull, as the Seven Bears also



The Constellations
were into Ursa Major, with our Arcturus for their keeper; and he gives their individual titles as Kratu for a, Pulaha for /3, Pulastya for y, Atri for d, Afigiras for E, and Marici for 'T/, the six sons of Brahma, who himself was Vashishtha, the star ,. The Vishnu-Dharma, however, claimed Atri as their ruler; indeed, there seems to be much variance in Sanskrit works as to the identity of these stars and titles. When the figure of the Bear was extended to its present dimensions, four times as great as Homer's Arktos, we do not know, and, to quote again from Miss Clerke,
we can only conjecture; but there is evidence that it was fairly well established when Aratos wrote his description of the constellations. [He stretched it over Gemini, Cancer, and Leo.] Aratos, however, copied Eudoxus, and Eudoxus used observations madedoubtless by Accad or Chaldaean astrologers -above 2000 B. c. We infer, then, that the Babylonian Bear was no other than the modern Ursa Major. . • • Thus, circling the globe from the valley of the Ganges to the great lakes of the New World, we find ourselves confronted with the same sign in the northern skies, the relic of some primeval association of ideas, long since extinct. Extinct even in Homer's time.
And Achilles Tatios distinctly asserted that it was from Chaldaea. But Brown thinks, in regard to the identity of the archaic and modern constellations of this name in that country,
that at present there is no real evidence to connect the Kall:b1nl. Dalli ( or Daba, the Babylonian Bear) with the Plough or Wain, still less with Ursa Major;
and identifies the latter with the Euphratean Bel-me-K.hi-ra, the Confronter of Bel,- Bertin, with Bel himself. A group of seven stars is often shown on the cylinders from Babylonia, Lajard's Culte de Mitl1ra giving many instances of this, although the reference may have been to the Pleiades; while it is Sayce's suggestion that perhaps "the god seven," so frequently mentioned in the inscriptions, is connected with Ursa Major. Theon's attribution of the invention of the constellation to the mythical Nauplius, son of Poseidon, and a famous navigator, hardly seems worthy of mention. Among the adjacent Syrians it was a Wild Boar, and in the stars of the feet of our Bear the early nomads saw the tracks of their Ghazal. Similarly, in the far North, it has been the 8arw of the Lapps, their familiar Reindeer, the Loa of the Ostiaks, and the Tukto of the Greenlanders. Smyth wrote in his Speculum Hartwdlia11um:
King Arthur, the renowned hero of the Afa6inogion, typified the Great Bear; as his name,-Arth, bear, and Uthyr, wonderful,-implies in the Welsh language; and the constellation, visibly describing a circle in the North Polar regions of the sky, may possibly have been the true origin of the Son of Pendragon's famous Round Table, the earliest institution or a military order of knighthood.



Star-Names and their Meanings
Whatever may be the fact in this speculation, we know that the early English placed King Arthur's home here, and that the people of Great Britain long called it Arthur'■ Chariot or Wain, which appears in the IAJ of tlu Last Minstrel:
Arthur's slow wain his course doth roll, In utter darkness, round the pole.
In Ireland it has been Xing David'■ Chariot, from one of that island's early kings; in France, the Great Chariot, and it was seen on Gaulish coins. The Anglo-Norman poet De Thaun of the 12th century had it Ch&rere; and La Lande cited the more modem la Jloue, the Wheel. Occasionally it has been called the Car of BoMe■• And this carries us back to another of the earliest titles for our constellation, the •Aμ,afa, Wain or Wagon,- Riccioli's Amau,- of the Diai and Odyssey, that Homer used equally with •Ap"r~, although with the same limitation to the seven stars. Describing the shield made by Hephaistos for Achilles, the poet said, in Sir John Herschel's rendering:
There the revolving Bear, which the Wain they call, was ensculptured, Circling on high, and in all its course regarding Orion; Sole of the starry train which refuses to bathe in the Ocean;
which I have quoted, in preference to others more rhythmical, from the interest that we all feel in the translator as an astronomer, although but little known as a poet. Homer repeated this in the 5th book of the Odyssey, where Ulixes, in Bryant's translation, is
Gazing with fixed eye on the Pleiades, Bootes setting late and the Great Bear, By others called the Wain, which wheeling round, Looks ever toward Orion and alone Dips not into the waters of the deep. For so Calypso, glorious goddess, bade That, on his ocean journey, he should keep That constellation ever on his left;
Ithaca, whither he was bound, lying due east from Calypso's isle, Orgygia. Pope rendered the original the llorthem Team, and the lines on Orion:
To which, around the axle of the sky, The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye.
These passages clearly show the early use of the Wain stars in Greek navigation before Cynosura was known to them ; as Aratos wrote:



The Constellations
By it on the deep Achaians gather where to sail their ships ;
Ovid imitating this in the Fasti and Tristia. Orion seems to have been often joined in this use, for Apollonius wrote :
The watchful sailor, to Orion's star And Helice, turned heedful.
Aratos called the constellation the " Wain-like Bear"; and, alluding to the title •Aμ~a, asserted that the word was from IJ.p,a, " together," the •Aμafat thus circling together around the pole; but no philologist accepts this, and it might as well have come from aE«,,v, "axle," referring to the axis of the heavens. In fact, Hewitt goes far back of Aratos in his statement that the Sanskrit god Akshivan, the Driver of the Axle (Aksha), was adopted in Greece as Ixion, whose well-known wheel was merely the circling course of this constellation. Anacreon mentioned it as a Chariot as well as a Bear; and Hesychios had it •Ayavia, an archaic word from ayeiv, "to carry," singularly like, in orthography at least, the Akkadian title for the Wain stars, Aganna, or Akanna, the Lord of Heaven; and Aben Ezra called it Ajala, the Hebrew word for" wagon." The Romans expressed the same idea in their Curru; Pl&uatnun,1 or Ploatrmn, magnum; with the diminutive Pl&uatricula, which Capella turned into Plauatriluoa, imitating the" Noctiluca" used by Horace for the moon. Apollinaris Sidonius, the Christian writer of the 6th century, called the constellation Plautra Parrhuia; and Rycharde Eden wrote it Plutrum,
al the sterres cauled Plastrum or Charles Wayne, are hydde under the Northe pole to the canibals.
In all these, of course, reference was made to the seven stars only, Bartschius plainly showing this on his chart, where he outlines them, with the title Plaustrum, included within the limits of the much larger Ursa Major. The Italians have Cataletto, a Bier, and Carro; and the Portuguese Cam~es wrote it Carreta. The Danes, Swedes, and Icelanders knew it as Btori Vagn, the Great Wagon, and as Xarla Vagn; Karl being Thor, their greatest god, of whom the old Swedish Rhyme Chronicle, describing the statues in the church 2 at Upsala, says: .
1 The Latin jlaaulr#m, originally a two-wheeled ox-cart, appears in the De R~ Rautial of Cato Censorius as jiaautrr,t11 maiau for one with four wheels. ZIt is in this church, or cathedral, that the great Linnaeus lies buried, and over its south !>On:h is sculptured the Hebrew story of the Creation.



Star-Names and their Meanings
The God Thor was the highest of them ; He sat naked as a child, Seven stars in his hand and Charles's Wain.
The Goths similarly called the seven stars Karl Wagen, which has descended to modern Germans as Wagon and Himmel Wagen, the last with the story that it represents the Chariot in which Elijah Journeyed to Ul'fD.
But in the heathen times of the northern nations it was the Wagon of Odin. Woden, or Wuotan, the father of Thor, and the IrmiDea Wapn. of the Saxons. Grimm cites Herwagen, probably the Honragen of Bayer and the Hunragen of Caesius; while a common English name now is the Waggon. The Poles call it Wm :l'iebeui, the Heavenly Wain. In all these similes the three tail stars of our Bear were the three draught-horses in line. The royal poet King James wrote:
Heir shynes the charlewain, there the Harp gives light, And heir the Seamans Starres, and there Twinnis bright.
This old and still universally populat title, Charlel'1 Wain, demands more than mere mention. It has often been derived from the Saxon ,tori, the carte of mediaeval times, our dturl, and thus the " peasant's cart"; but this is incorrect, and the New English Dictionary has an exhaustive article on the words, well worthy of repetition here:
Oharl11'1 WID. Forms : caries-wren, Cherlemaynes-wayne, Charlmons wayn, carle well· sterre, carwaynesterrc, Charel-wayn, Charlewayn, Charle wane, Charles wayne or wain<, Charles or Carol's wain(e), Charlemagne or Charles his wane, wain( e), Charle-wain~,Chulmaigne Wain, Charles's Wain. [OE. Carlu wugn, the wain (aμafa, plauslnl•) of url (Charles the Great, Charlemagne). The name appears to arise out of the verbal association of the star-name Arcturus with Arturus or Arthur, and the legendary association of Arthur and Charlemagne; so that what was originally the wain of Arcturus or Boot6 (' Bootes' golden wain,' Pope) became at length the wain of Carl or Charlemagne. (The guess d1ur1's or car/e's wain has been made in ignorance of the history.)] As the name Arcturus was formerly sometimes applied loosely lo the coostellatiOD Bootes, and incorrectly to the Great Bear, the name Carlrwaync-stnn occurs applied to the star Arcturus.
The editor cites from various authors since the year 1000, when he finds Carleawam (I can make a still earlier citation of this word from one of the Anglo-Saxon Cottonian 1J£anuscripts of some years previously), and quotes from Sir John Davies, the philosophical poet of the Elizabethan age:
Those bright starres Which English Shepheards, Charles his ,nine, do name; Bot more this Ile is Charles, his waine, Since Charles her royall wagoner became ;
and from John Taylor, "the King's water-poet," of 1630:



The Constellations
Charles his Cart (which we by custome call Charles his wane) is most gloriously stellifide.
The list ends with a quotation from J. F. Blake, of 18761 who even at this
late day had XiDg Charlea' Wain.
This connection of these Seven Stars with England's kings was due to the courtiers of Charles I and II, who claimed it as in their masters' honor, and elsewhere occurs; William Bas, or Basse, about 1650, having, in Old Tom of Bedlam:
Bid Charles make ready his waine;
James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, in the Queen's Wake of 1813:
Charles re-yoked his golden wain ;
and Tom Hood, of fifty years ago:
looking at that Wain of Charles, the Martyr's.
This is from the Comet, the humorous Astronomical Anecdote of the great Sir William Herschel, whom the poet called the "be-knighted," and further described as
like a Tom of Coventry, sly peeping, At Dian sleeping; Or ogling thro' his glass Some heavenly lass Tripping with pails along the Milky Way.
Cuverdale's .Bi/Jle alludes to it and its companion as the Waynea of Heaven, which Edmund Becke, in his edition of 15491 transforms into Vaynea, and Cadmarden, in his Rouen edition of 1515, into the Wavea of Heaven. Dutch and German versions have Wagen am Jlimmel; the Saxon versions, Wanea Thill, or Wagon-pole; and this idea of a wagon, or its parts and its driver, is seen in all the Northern tongues where the Bear is not recognized. Grimm's Teutonic Mythology is very full as to this branch of the stellar Wain's nomenclature. llkuwa, the Septuagint's rendering of the Hebrew 'Ash, is manifestly incorrect, but may have misled the later Rabbis who applied this last word to the group in Taurus. The .Peshilla-Syriac Version translates the Kuziroth of the Boole of Jo/J by 'galti, meaning our Wain. The 15th-century German manuscript so often alluded to mentions it as the Southern Tramontane, a title more fully treated under Ursa Minor; and Vespucci, in his _J'Z Let/era, wrote of the two Bears:

La stella tramontana o l'orsa maggiore & minore.
Both of these have been - perhaps still are - night clocks to the English rustic, and measures of time generally, as in Poe's Ula/u~, "star-dials that pointed to mom." Shakespeare's Carrier at the Rochester inn-yard said:
An't be not four by the day, I'll be hang'd; Charles Wain is over the new chimuq, and yet our horse not pack'd;
Tennyson, in his touching New ~ar's E11e:
We danced about the May-pole and in the hazel copse, Till Charles's Wain came out above the tall white chimney tops;
and again, in the .Primess:
I paced the terrace, till the Bear had wheel'd Thro' a great arc his seven slow suns.
Spenser, in the Faerie Queen, thus refers to the Wain as a timepiece.and to Polaris as a guide :
By this the northern wagoner had set His sevenfold teme behind the steadfast starre That was in ocean waves never yet wet, But firme is 6xt, and sendith light from farre To all that in the wide deep wandering arre.
Its well-known use by the early Greeks in navigation was paralleled in the deserts of Arabia, "through which," according to Diodorus the Sicilian, "travellers direct their course by the Bears, in the same manner as is done at sea." They serve this same purpose to the Badawiyy of to-day, as Mrs. Sigourney describes in The Stars, writing of Polaris:
The weary caravan, with chiming bells, Making strange music 'mid the desert sands, Guides by thy pillar'd 6res its nightly march.
Sophocles made a similar statement of the Bear as directing travelers generally; Falstaff, in King Henry IV, said:
We that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars;
and the modern Keats, in his .Ro/Jin Hood:
the seven stars to light you, Or the polar ray to right you.



The Constellations 43 1
But the astrologers of Shakespeare's time ascribed to it evil influences, which Edmund, in King Lear, commented upon with ridicule:
This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune, (often the surfeit of our own behaviour), we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars,
claiming that his own
nativity was under Ur$& Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous.
Both of the Bears have been frequently found on the old sign-boards of English inns, and, in a more important way, are emblazoned on the shields of the cities of Antwerp and Groningen in the Netherlands. The Plough has been a common title with the English down to the present time, even with so competent a scientist as Miss Clerke, one of the few astronomical writers who still continue the use of the good old names of stars and constellations. She, however, takes the three line stars as the Handle, not the Team. Minsheu mentioned it in the same way, but added ut place/ astro/ogis dicitur Tmw, i. e. the Beam, a term originating with Quintus Ennius, the Father of Roman Song, adopted by Cicero, Ovid, Statius, and Varro, and common with the astrologers. Fale, in 1593, described it as called " of countrymen the plough," the first instance in print that I have found. Thus it was, perhaps still is, the Irish Cam· oh-.ota. Hewitt sees this Heavenly Plough even in prehistoric India, and quotes from Sayce the title Bugi, the Wain, which later became Libra's name as the Yoke. With the Wain and Plough naturally came the Plough Oxen, the Trionea of Varro, Aulus Gellius, and the Romans generally, turned by the grammarians into Tericmea, the Threshing-oxen, walking around the threshingfloor of the pole. Martial qualified these by hyper/Jord Odrysii and .Parrhasii, but also called the constellation Parrhuium 1ugum; and Claudian, inoccidui, "never setting." Cicero, with contemporary and later Latin writers, said Beptem- or Beptentrionea, as did the long-haired Iopas in his Aeneid song of the two Northern Can; and Propertius wrote of them:
Flectant Icarii sidera tarda boves ;
while Claudian designated them as pigri; all of which remind us of similar epithets for their driver Bootes. Beptentrio seems to have been applied to either constellation; and Dante used it for the Minor, with a beautiful simile, in his .Purgatorio. Eventually it became a term for the north pole and the north wind ; then for the North

generally, as the word Arctic has from the steJlar dpnQf. Dante badstflenlriontile silo>° Chaucer spoke of the " Septentrioun " as a compass point; Shakespeare, in King Henry VI:

Michael Drayton, the friend of Shakespeare and poet laureate in 16z6. wrote in the Poly-01/Jion of "septentrion cold "; Milton, in Parodist Ju. gained, of" cold Septentrion blasts"; and, in our day, Owen Meredith in the Wanderer has " beyond the blue Septentrions "; while the word seems current as an adjective in nearly all modem languages. Still there is nothing new in all this, for in the Avesta the Seven Stars marked the North in the four quarters of the heavens.
The Persian title was Hafturengh, Heft Averengh, or Heft Baagh. qualified by Kihin, Greater, to distinguish it from Xihin, Lesser; He•-itt gi,·ing this as originally Hapto-iringu, the Seven Bulls, that possibly may be the origin of the Triones. Cox, however, goes far back of this classic title and says:
They who spoke of the seven trionts bad long forgotten that their fathers spoke of the tams (slaras) or strewcrs of light;
and Al Biruni derived the word from lara'!a, "passage," as of the stars through the heavens. Thus from the results of modem philological research it is possible that our long received opinions as to the derivations of many star-names should be abandoned, and that we should search for them far back of Greece or Rome. Heraclitos, the Ionic philosopher of Ephesus of about 500 B. c., asserted that this constellation marked the boundary between the East and lhe West, which it may be regarded as doing when on the horizon. A coin of 74 B. c., struck by the consul Lucretius Trio, bears the Se\'en Stars disposed in an irregular curve around the new moon, while the word TRIO within the crescent is an evident allusion to the consul's name, albeit one hardly known in Roman history. The Hebrew 'Ash, or 'Ayish, is reproduced by, or was derived from, the Arabic Banit lla'uh al Xubri, the Daughters of the Great Bier, i. t. the Mourners,- the Benenu, Benethuch, and Beneth Al of Chilmead and Christmannus,- applied to the three stars in the extreme end of the group. 1/ being Al ~a'id, the Chief One; from this came Bayer's Bl Kaid for th~ whole constellation. Riccioli, quoting Kircher, said that the Arabian Christians with · more definiteness termed it lla'uh Lauar, the Bier ol Lazarus, with Mary, Martha, and Ellamath,- this last being given in Mrs.

Jameson's Sacred anti ugmdary Art as Marcella or Martina, but by Smyth as Magdalen; Riccioli's word should be Al Amah, the Maid, the position that Marcella occupied toward the two women during their journey to Marseilles, where she was canonized. Karsten Niebuhr said that the constellation was known, even in his day, as lla'uh by the Arabs along the Persian Gulf; and \Vetzstein tells the modern story, from that people, in which these mourners, the children of Al Na'ash, who was murdered by Al Jadi, the pole-star, are still nightly surrounding him in their thirst for vengeance, the walidtin among the daughters - the star Mizar- holding in her arms her new-born infant, the little Alcor, while Suhail is slowly struggling up to their help from the South. Delitzsch says that even to-day the group is known as a Bier in Syria; Flammarion attributing this title to the slow and solemn motion of the figure around the pole. This seems to have originated in Arabia ; and from it come the titles even now occasionally heard for the quadrangle stars - the Bier and the Gnat Colin. With the early Arab poets the Banli.t stars were an emblem of inactivity and laziness. It had other names also. Cynoauria appeared with Ovid and Germanicus for this, although it generally is applied to the Lesser Bear; lI.Uv8tov, used for it or for its quarter of the sky, was from the Greek, as we see in Plutarch's df TWV rrUv9u.Jv vrroypatpa{, the" fields," or" spaces," into which the augurs divided the heavens, the templa, or regiones, toeli of the Latins; while "EA,f, the Curved, or Spiral, One, and 'EU"1/, apparently first used for the constellation by Aratos and Apollonius Rhodius, became common as descriptive of its twisting around the pole,- whence one of its titles now, the Twitter; Sophocles having the same thought in •Apnov aTpoq,adEt; 1'i:kv8ot, the" circling paths of the Bear." Some, however, derived the name from the curved or twisted position of the chief stars; and others, still more probably, from the city Helice, Kallisto's birthplace in Arcadia. Ovid used this title in the Fasti, where he wrote of both the Bears, in navigation :
Esse duas Arctos, quarum, Cynosura petatur Sidoniis, Helicen Graia carina notet ;
but later on Kellee was considered a nymph, one of the two Cretan sister nurses who nourished the infant Jupiter
In odorous Dikte, near the ldaian hill,
whence she was transferred to the skies. Dante, in the .Rzradiso, alludes
to barbarians coming from some region That every day by Helice is covered Revolving with her son whom she delights in.

Homer's' EA.i.:wrrE~ has been rendered" observing Helice," and so applied to the early Grecian sailors; but there seems to be no foundation for this, as the IVOrd merely signifies" black-,"" glancing-," or" rolling-eyed," an,l irequently was applied to various characters in the Iliad, with no limitation a, to sex or profession. Ancient, however, as are 'Apnoi; and Ursa, 'Ash and the Bier, "A11~a. Plaustrum, and Triones, this splendid constellation ran still further backthree or four or even more millenniums before even these titles were current - as the Bull'■ Thigh, or the Fore Shank, in Egypt. There it was represented on the Denderah planisphere and in the temple of Edfii by a single thigh or hind quarter of the animal, alluded to in the .Book ofthe Dead as
The constellation of the Thigh in the northern sky;
and thus mentioned in inscriptions on the kings' tombs and the walls ofthe Ramesseum at Thebes. Sometimes the figure of the Thigh was changed to , that of a cow's body with disc and horns; but, however called or represented. these stars always were prominent in the early astronomy and mytholog~· of Egypt. Ke■xet seems to have been their designation, and specially for some one of them, as representative of the malignant red Set,1 Sit, or Sith, Sut or Sutech, who, with his wife Taurt or Thoueris, shown by the adjoining Hippopotamus (now a part of our Draco), represented darkness and the divinities of evil. Set also was a generic term applied to all circumpalar constellations, because, as always visible, they somewhat paradoxically were thought to typify darkness. Hewitt writes of Set in his earliest form as Kapi, the Ape-God, stars of our Cepheus marking his head; while at one time on the Nile the Wain stars seem to have been the Dog of Set or of Typhon. This may have gi,·en rise to the title Canis Venatica that La Lande cited, if this be not more correctly considered as the classic Kallisto's hound; and the same idea appears in the Catuli, Lap-dogs, and Cane■ Laoonioae, the Spartan Dogs, that Caesius cited for both of the Wains. The myth of Horus, one of the most ancient even in a~cient Egyp:, deciphered from the temple walls of Edfii, 5000 B. c., as connected with the stellar Hippopotamus, was, about 3000 years afterwards, tra_nsferred tu the Thigh, which then occupied the same circumpolar position that the Hi1r popotamus did when the original inscription 1Vas made. In view of this. Champollion alluded to the Thigh as HOl'UI Apollo.
1 Set, also Anubis, Apap, Apepi, Bes, Tebha. Temha, and Typboeus according to p:utarch, was one of Egypt's greatest gods, who subsequently became the Greek giant Typhor., father of the fierce winds, but slain by Zeus with a thunderbolt and buried und~r }fount Aetna.



The Constellations 435
Towards our era, when Egypt began to be influenced by Greece, her former pupil, our Wain was regarded as the Car of Oeiri■ , shown on some of that country's planispheres by an Ark, or Boat, near to the polar point, although it also seems to have been known as a Bear. Al Biriini devoted a chapter of his work on India to these seven stars, saying that they were there known as Baptar Shayar, the Seven Anchorites, with the pious woman Al Suha (the star Alcor), all raised by Dharma to the sky, to a much higher elevation than the rest of the fixed stars, and all located "near Vas, the chaste woman Vumdhati "; but who was this last is not explained. And he quoted from Vara.ha Mihira:
The northern region is adorned with these stars, as a beautiful woman is adorned with a collar of pearls strung together, and a neckface of white lotus flowers, a handsomely arranged one. Thus adorned, they are like maidens who dance and revolve round the pole as the pole orders them.
Professor Whitney tells us that
ro these stars the ancient astronomers of India, and many of the modem upon their authority, have llltributed an independent motion about the pole of the heavens, at the rate of eight minutes yearly, or of a complete revolution in 2700 years;
and that this strange dogma well illustrates the character of Hindu astronomy. The matter-of-fact Al Biriini, commenting on this same thing, :md on the absurdly immense numbers in Hindu chronology, wrote:
The author of the theory was a man entirely devoid of scientific education, and one of the foremost in the series of fools who simply invented those years for the benefit of people who worship the Great Bear and the pole. He had t;, invent a vast number of year$, for the more outrageous it was, the more impression it would make.
In China the T■eih Sing, or Seven Stars, prominent in this constellation, were known as the Government, although also called Pih Tow, the Northem .Measure, which Flammarion translates the Bushel; while the centre of the Square was Xwei, an object of worship and a favorite stellar title in that country, as it occurs twice in their list of sieu, although there rendered the ~pectre, or Striding Legs. Reeves said that the four stars of the Square were Tien Li, the Heavenly Reason, and Edkins, in his Relfl{ion in Chi11a, assigns to this spot the home of the Taouist female divinity Tow Moo. Colas gives Ti Tohe, the Emperor's Chariot; but this was doubtless a later designation from Jesuit teaching. Weigel of Jena figured it as the heraldic Danilh :Elephant; but Julius Schiller, as the archangel Jliohael; while Caesius said that it might represent one of the Bean sent by Elisha to punish his juvenile persecutors, or the Chariot that Pharaoh gave to Joseph.



Star-Names and their Meanings
Popular names for it have been the Butcher'• Cleaver, somewhat similar
to the Hindu figure for the other Seven Stars, the Pleiades; the Brood Ben, also reminding us of that cluster, as do the Gaelic OrigiraD, Crau, and Ora.nuarain; Peter'• ~ from, or the original of, Julius Schiller's 81lip of Saint Peter; the Laclle; and, what is known to every one, star-lover or not. the Big Dipper, the universaUy common title in our country. In southern France this has been changed to Oulerole, the Saucepan. Before the observations of the navigators of the 15th and 16th centuries the singular belief prevailed that the southern heavens contained a constellation near the pole similar to our Bear or Wain ; indeed, it is said to have been represented on an early map or globe. Manilius wrote:
The lower Pole resemblance bears To this Above, and shines with equal stars; With Bears averse, round which the Draeo twines;
and Al Biriini repeated the Sanskrit legend that at one time in the history of the Creation an attempt was made by Visvll.mitra to form a southern heavenly home for the body of the dead king, the pious Somadatta; and this work was not abandoned till a southern pole and another Bear had been located in positions corresponding to the northern, this pole passing through the island Lunka, or Vadavamukha (Ceylon). The Anglo-Saxon Manual made distinct mention of this duplicate constellation " which we can never see." Towards our day Eden, describing the "pole Antartike," said:
Aloysius Cadamustus 1 wryteth in this eff'ecte: We saw also syxe cleare bryght and great starres very lowe above the sea. And consyderynge theyr stations with our coom· passe, we found them to stande ryght south, fygured in this maner, ,. • ,. ,. ,. • We judged them to bee the chariotte or wayne of the south: But we saw not the principal! starre, as we coulde not by good reason, except we shuld first lose the syght of the north pole.
And, quoting from Francisco Lopes of 1552:
Abowt the poynt of the Sou the or pole Antartike, they sawe a lyttle whyte cloude and foure starres lyke unto a crosse with three other joynynge thereunto, which resemble ourt S.!ptentrion, and are judged to bee the sigues or tokens of the south exeltree of bcave11.
What is referred to here is not known, for, although the figure represented is that of the Southern Cross, this constellation always is upright when
on the meridian, and, as the observation was made in latitude 14° or 1f.
Thi~ Alois, or Luigi, di Cada Mosto was a noted Venetian navigator in the service of Portugal, for whom is often claimed the discovery of the Cape Verd Islands in 1456; but tbcs< had been seen, at least in part, fifteen years previously, by Antonio and Bartolomeo di Nolli.

its base star was plainly visible. Still it would seem that some early knowledge of the Cross was the foundation of this idea of a southern Wain.. Pliny strangely blundered in some of his allusions to Ursa Major, asserting in one its invisibility in Egypt, and, again, describing the visit to Rome of ambassadors from Ceylon,- Milton's "utmost Indian isle Taprobane,"wrote of them :

All these stars, unless possibly d, which is too faint for the . Potsdam observers, are approaching our system at various rates of speed.

Lockyer asser~ that it was Ak, the Eye, i. e. the prominent one of the constellation, utilized in the alignment of the walls of the temple of Hathor at Denderah, and the orientation point of that structure perhaps before 5000 B. c.; at all events, before the Thigh became circumpolar, about 4000 B. c. This was in the times of the Hor-she-shu, the worshipers of Horus, before the reign of Mena,1 when the star had a declination of over 64°,now about 62° 24'. And he finds two other temples also so oriented. As typifying a goddess of Egypt, it was But Ilia and Taurt Ilia. The Chinese know it as Tien Choo, Heaven's Pivot, and as Kow Ching. a is 5° from 13 and 10° from d, and, being always visible, these stars afford a ready means of accurate eye measurement of others adjacent.

The Keepers was Arago's name for them; while, as the Pointen, they indicate to beginners in astronomy the pole-star, 283⁄40 distant from a, an<l Regulus, 45° away towards the south; and they have been called thr Two Stan.
They are circumpolar north of about 32° 45'; and, with Polaris, received much attention in the first almanac 1 that was printed in London, in 14H Klein surmised, in 1867, that Dubhe shows remarkable, although irregular, variations in color,-not in light,- from red to yellow, in a period of 543⁄4 days; but this is still in doubt. Its spectrum is Solar, and it is approaching our system at the rate of twelve miles a second. The 11th-magnitude companion, .97 of a second away, was discoverec by Burnham in 1889, and is thought to be in rapid revolution around it.

Ierak, or Iirat, is from A l • ~ the Loin (of the Bear); but Chilmead said Kirae, and Scaliger, Iisar. It may have been known by thr Greeks as Helike, one of their names for the whole. The Chinese called it Tien Seuen, an Armillary Sphere, and the Hindus. Polaha, one of the Rishis. Its spectrum is Sirian, and it is moving toward us about 183⁄4 miles a second. Close to it, on the west, lies the Owl ll'ebula, N. G. C. 3587, 97 M., discovered by Mechain in 1781, and so called from the two interior circular spaces, each with a central star representing the eye; although one of the;.e stars seems to have disappeared since 1850. The angular diameter ofthi, nebula - 2' 40" - indicates a magnitude sufficient to contain thousand, of solar systems.

Phaocl and Phachd, Phad, Phaed, Pheoda, Phekda, and Phegda, are a:! from Al Falidh, the Thigh, where this star is located in the figure. Al Birii.ni said that it was Pulaatya, one of the Hindu Seven Sages. The Chinese knew it as Xe Seuen Xe, and as Tien Xe, another Armillary Sphere.
Its spectrum is similar to that of IJ, and the star is approaching us at the rate of 16.6 miles a second. It is 8° distant from (3, and 43⁄40 from J.

Kegrez is from Al Iaghra, the Root of the Tail. In China it was Kwan, and Tien Kuen, Heavenly Authority.
With the Hindus it may have been Am, one of their Seven Rishis, and the Vislz'!u-Dlzarma said that it ruled the other stars of the Bear. It is 10° distant from a; 4_1⁄20 from y; 5,1⁄2o from e; and 32° from the pole, directly opposite {j Cassiopeiae, and almost on the equinoctial colure. a, 13, y, and d form the bowl of the Dipper, the body of the Bear, and the
frames of the Bier, Plough, and Wain, but occupy a space of less than 1⁄4 of the whole constellation. •within this square Heis shows eight stars. ~fegrez is thought to be slightly variable, and to have decreased in lustre <luring the present century, on the very doubtful ground that it is much fainter than the succeeding e. As to this Miss Clerke writes:
The immemorially observed constituents of the Plough preserve no fix~ order of relative brilliancy, now one, now another of the septett having at sundry epochs assumed the primacy.
But this is uncertain, although we know that Ptolemy rated it at the 3d magnitude and Tycho at the 2d.

Alioth, sometimes .Allioth, seems to have originated in the first edition of the Alfonsine Tables, and appeared with Chaucer in the Hous of Fame as Aliot; with Bayer, as .Aliath, from Scaliger, and as Riaalioth; with Riccioli, as Alabieth, .Alaioth, .Alhiath, and .Alhaiath, all somewhat improbably derived, Scaliger said, from Alyat,1 the Fat Tail of the Eastern sheep. But the later Alfonsine editions adopted .Aliare and .&.liore - Riccioli's Aloore -from the Lalin Almagest of 1515, on Al Tizini's statement that the word was Al }Jawar, the White of the Eye, or the White Poplar Tree, i. e. Intensely Bright; Hyde transcribing the original as Al Kaur, Ulug Beg had .Al Haun, but Ideler, rejecting thi~ as not being an Arabic word, substituted Al Jaun, the Black Courser, as if belonging to the governor, Al ~a'id, the star 71, and its comparative faintness gives some probability to this conjecture. Assemani, however, said that on the Cufic globe it is ".Alhut," the • Fish,- one of the many instances of blundering that Ideler attributed to him. Hayer also assigned to it the M:ioar, Jfirach, and ICizar that we give to

Jlirak was an early name for this, a repetition of that for /3; but Scaligei incorrectly changed it to the present J[izar, from the Arabic Jli'ar, a Girdle or Waist-cloth, which, although inappropriate, has maintained its place in modem lists; Kuat and J6na being other forms. There is evident confusion in the early use of this word as a stellar title, for it has also been applied to the stars /3 and e of this constellation. The " hill Mizar" of the 42d Psalm sometimes is wrongly associated with this, the original Hebre.word mi{ar being better rendered in the Psalter, from Coverdale's version. as "the little hill," i. e. of Hermon, of which it was a minor peak.

Assemani said that it was "Al]uae," the Ostrich, probably another of his errors, as all these stellar birds were much farther south, in or near our River Eridanus. With Alcor it has various combined titles noted at that star; and Wetzstein repeats an Arabic story in which Mizar is the wtilidtin of the Banal. with Alcor as her new-born infant.

The components are within 14" of arc of each other, with a position angle of 149°.5, and may be a binary system with a long period of revolution; while Pickering has shown, by study of its spectrum photographed in 1889, that the brightest component is itself double, the two bodies, of nearly equal brightness, revolving around their common centre of gravity at a speed of 100 miles a second in 104 days, 140 millions of miles apart, and with a united mass forty times that of our sun. This spectrum is Sirian, and the star is in approach to us at the rate of 19.5 miles a second. , is 4_1⁄4 0 from e, and 7° from 1/; and a straight line from it to Polaris passes through the exact pole 1° 14' before reaching Polaris. Mizar and Alcor are 11' 48" apart, and, since they have nearly identical proper motion, some think that they may also be in mutual revolution, although so distant from each other. With their attendant stars they form one of the finest objects in the sky for a small telescope, being readily resolved by a terrestrial eyepiece of 40 diameters with a 2 1⁄4-inch objective.

Alcaid, Alkaid, and Benatnuoh are our present titles, from ~'id Banlt

Bayer included Elkeid in his list of names for the stars as well as for the constellation, and had authority for it from Kazwini; but he added for 1/ "Jiquutim, Bemumatz co"eclius Benetnuch," and in his text of Bootes alluded to it as Benenacm. The Alfonsine Tables of 1521 say Bennenuc; Riccioli, Benat BJnanlOlrl, Beninax, Benena.th, Benenat.z; while Al ~ii'id often has been turned into Aloha.yr, Arago's A.okair, and others' Aokia.r. In this Al ~ii'id we see the derivation, through the Moors, of the modern Spanish word Alcaide ; and, with the same idea, Ideler translated the original as the "Stadtholder." Assemani transcribed from the Borgian globe "Alea.tel," Destroying. Al Bitiini gave it as Karioi, one of the Seven Rishis of India. In China it was known as Yaou K.wang, a Revolving Light. Boteler has an amusing reference to it in Hudi/Jras :

generally accurate author asserted. In popular lists, frequently is given as Talitha. Hyde strangely rendered the original words of Ulug Beg as the Vertebrae of the Greater Bear,-whence probably Smyth's statement,or the Cavity of the Heel, which, from the star's position in the figure, is a much more likely translation. In China these two stars were Shang Tae, the High Dignitary. Holden says of, that its "companion is suspected to be a planet." It is 1211 distant from the larger, and the orbital revolution is very slow.

Baily has them in his edition of Ulug Beg's Tabks, from Hyde's Latin translation, as Al Phikra al Thinia,-in the original Al Filcrah, the Vertebra; but this, more probably, is entirely wrong, as these three pairs of stars have always marked three of the Bear's feet. In China they were Chung Tae, the Middle Dignitary.

The foregoing three pairs, about 20° apart and the members of each pair 1 1⁄40 or 2° apart, are beautifully grouped with others invisible to the naked eye. They were interesting to the Arabs, as they now are to us, and •·ere
collectively designated lJafzah al '.fhibi', the Springs of the Gazelle. each pair marking one spring ; the Guella being imagined from the unformed stars since gathered up as Leo Minor, and the springing of the animal being due to its fear of the greater Lion's tail. Ideler adopted this from Al Tizini and the Cufic globe at Dresden ; while the Borgian globe shows a Gazelle and her Young in the same location. Kazwini, however, described this group as extending over the eyes, eyebrows, ears, and muzzle of the figure of our Ursa Major.

A1cor is the naked-eye companion of Mizar, and, inconspicuous though it be, has been famous in astronomical folk-lore. This title, and that of the stare, Alioth, may be from the same source, for Smyth wrote of it :
They are wrong who pronounce the name to be an Arabian word importing sharp-sightedness: it is a supposed corruption of al-jaun, a courser, incorrectly written al-jat, whence probably the A liotl, of the Alfonsine Tables came in, and was assigned to t V rsae Majoris, the" thill-horse" of Charles's Wain. This little fellow was also familiarly termed Buhi [the Forgotten, Lost, or Neglected One, because noticeable only by a sharp eye], and implored to guard its viewers against scorpions and snakes, and was the theme of a world of wit in the shape of saws :
but Miss Clerke says:
The Arabs in the desert regarded it as a test of penetrating vision; and they were .accustomed to oppose" Suhel" to" Suha" (Canopus to Alcor) as occupying respectively the highest and lowest posts in the celestial hierarchy. So that Vidit Akor,at non /unam fltnam, came to be a proverbial description of one keenly alive to trifles, but dull of apprehension for broad facts.
Al Sahja was the rhythmical form of the usual Suha; and it appears as Al "Khawwa.r," the Faint One, in an interesting list of Arabic star-names, published in Popular Astronomy for January, 1895, by Professor Robert H. West, of the Syrian Protestant College at Beirut. Firuzabadi called it Our Riddle, and Al ~ik, the Test,-correctly ~ True; while Kazwini said that " people tested their eyesight by this star." Humboldt wrote of it as being seen with difficulty, and Arago similarly alluded to it; but some now consider it brighter than formerly

and no longer the difficult object that it was, even in the clear sky of the Desert; or as having increased in angular distance from Mizar. Although the statement has been made that Alcor was not known to the Greeks, there is an old story that it was the Lost Pleiad Electra, which had wandered here from her companions and became 'Ai..t:,rr'lf, the Fox; a Latin title was Eq1181 Stellula, the Little Starry Horseman ; Eq1111, the Cavalier, is from Bayer; while the Hone and hill Rider, and, popularly. in England, lack on the lliddle Hone, are well known, Mizar being the horse. Al Bin1ni mentioned its importance in the family life of the Arabs on the 18th day of the Syrian month Adar, the March equinox; and a modem story· of that same people makes it the infant of the wtilidiin of the three Banat In North Germany Alkor, as there written, has been der llinde, the: Hind, or Farm Hand; in Lower Germany, Dumke; and in Holstein, llua Dibnken, Hans the Thumbkin,-the legend being that Hans, a wagonc:r, having given the Saviour a lift when weary, was offered the kingdom ol heaven for a reward; but as he said that he would rather drive from east to west through all eternity, his wish was granted, and here he sits on the highest of the horses of his heavenly team. A variant version placed Hans here for neglect in the service of his master Christ; and the Hungarians call the star Giintzol, with a somewhat similar tale. Another Teutonic stof} was that their giant Orwandil, our Orion, having frozen one of his big toes. the god Thor broke it off and threw it at the middle horse of the Wagon. where it still remains. In China it was Foo Sing, a Supporting Star. At the obtuse angle formed with Alcor and Mizar lies the Sidu1Ludovioian11D1, an 8th-magnitude bluish star, just visible in a field-glass. Thi, was first noted in 1691 by Einmart of Nuremberg, and in 1723 by another German, who, thinking that in it he had discovered a new planet, named it after his sovereign, Ludwig V, landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt.

is the well-known Flying Star, or Runaway Star, that, until Kapteyn's recent discovery of a swifter one in Pictor, had shown the greatest velocity of any in the heavens, although the 71⁄4-magnitude La Caille 9352 in Piscis Australis, and an 81⁄4-magnitude in Sculptor, are not far behind it in this respect. According to Miss Clerke,
Argelander discovered in 1842 its pace to be such as would carry it around the ~nt;r, sphere in 185,000 years, or in 265 over as much of it as the sun's diameter covers.

Another calculator states that in 6000 years it will reac:h Coma Berenices. This is equivalent to a proper motion of 7".03 of arc annually, at the rate of over 200 miles a second, and its velocity may be still greater,- a speed uncontrollable, Professor Newcomb says, by the combined attractive power of the entire sidereal universe. The observations for its parallax do not accord in their results, but Pro
fessor Young assigns to the star a distance of 371⁄4 light years. It is about 16° south from y, half-way between Coma and the stars l' and £ on the right paw of the Bear; its exact location being 11° 46' of right ascension and 380 35' of north declination, about 15° from LI. 21258, an 81~-magnitude also much observed for its great proper motion; but 50,000 years hence the Flying Star will have separated from this by at least 100°. From the foregoing list it will be seen that we have in the entire constellation twenty stars individually named, many of them inconspicuous, two even telescopic,- evidence enough in itself of the antiquity of, as well as the continued popular and scientific interest in, Ursa Major.

The origin of this word is uncertain, for the star group rloes not answer to its name unless the dog himself be attached; still some, recalling a variant legend of Kallisto and her Dog instead of Areas, have thought that here lay the explanation. Others have drawn this title from that of the Attican promontory east of Marathon, because sailors, on their approach to it from the sea, saw these stars shining above it and beyond; but if there be any connection at all here, the reversed derivation is more •

probable; while Bournouf asserted that it is in no way associated with the Greek word for" dog." Cox identified the word with Avte6aovpa, which he renders Tail, or Train. of Light. Yet this does not seem appropriate to a comparatively faint constellation, and would rather recall the city of that title in Arcadia, the country so intimately connected with the Bears. But the stellar name probably long antedated the geographical, old as this was; Pausanias considering Lycosura the most ancient city in the world, having been founded by Lycaon some time before the Deluge of Deucalion. Indeed the Arcadians asserted that they and their country antedated the creation of the moon, an assertion which gave occasion to Aristotle's term for them,1IpoaiA1r110, and the Latms' Proselenes. Singularly coincident with the foregoing Avte6aovpa was the title that the distant Gaels gave to these stars,-Drag-blocl, the Fire Tail. Very recently, however, Brown has suggested that the word is not Htllenic in origin, but Euphratean; and, in confirmation of this, mentions a constellation title from that valley, transcribed by Sayce as An-ta-tllMI, the Upper Sphere. Brown reads this An•nllHlll'-ra, High in Rising, certainly very appropriate to Ursa Minor; and he compares it with K-vJ'-IMI· ov-pa, or, the initial consonant being omitted, UnOIOlU'L This, singularl1· like the Euphratean original,
might easily become Kunosoura under the influence of a popular etymology, aided by the appearance of the tail stars of the constellation. And in exact accordance with the fort.

Ursa Minor was not mentioned by Homer or Hesiod, for, according to Strabo, it was not admitted among the constellations of the Greeks until about 600 B. c., when Thales, inspired by its use in Phoenicia, his probable birthplace, suggested it to the Greek mariners in place of its greater neigh· bor, which till then had been their sailing guide. Aratos, comparing the two, wrote, as in our motto, of the Minor, its Guards, {J and y, then being much nearer the pole than was a, our present pole-star. Thales is reported to have formed it by utilizing the ancient wings of Draco, perceiving tba: the seven chief components somewhat resembled the well-known Wain, but reversed with respect to each other. From all this come its titles totri1TJ, Phoenioe, and Una Phoenicia. "'•
The later classical story that made sister nymphs out of the stars of our two Bears, and nurses on Mount Ida of the infant Jove, is alluded to by Manilius in his line,



The Constellations 449
The Little Bear that rock'd the mighty Joye.
Although occasionally, but wrongly, figured and described as equal in size,- Euripides wrote:
Twin Bears, with the swift-wandering rushings of their tails, guard the Atlantean pole,
they have always occupied their present respective positions, and, as Manilius said : stand not front to front but each doth view The others Tayl, pursu'd as they pursue;
the scientific poet Erasmus Darwin of the last century, grandfather of Charles Robert Darwin of this, imitating this in his Economy of Vegetatio11 :
Onward the kindred Bears, with footsteps rude, Dance round the pole, pursuing and pursued.
This " dancing" of the stars generally, as well as of the planets, was a favorite simile, and in classical days specially gave name to d and e of this constellation, as well as in Hindu astronomy; while Dante thus applied it to all those that were circumpolar:
Like unto stars neighboring the steadfast poles, Ladies they seemed, not from the dance released.
The Arabians knew Ursa Minor as Al Dubb al ~ghar, the Lesser Bear, - Bayer's Dhub Bluguar, and Chilmead's Dub Alugar,- although earlier it was even more familiar to them as another Bier; and they called the three stars in the tail of our figure Banit al Na'uh al ~ughri, the Daughters of the Lesser Bier. Here, and in Ursa Major1 some early commentators located the l'old, an ancient stellar figure of the Arabs, and an appropriate title, as Firuzabadi called /j and the gammas in Ursa Minor Al F a r ~ usually rendered the Two Calves, but, better, the Two Young Ibexes; Polaris, too, was well known as a Young He Goat, and adjacent stars bore names of desert animals more or less associated with a fold. Perhaps Lowell had this in mind when he wrote, in Prometl,eus, of
The Bear that prowled all night about the fold Ofthe North-star.
Rut Manilius anticipated him in writing of the Beaw.
Secure from meeting they're distinctly roll'd, Nor leave their Seats, and pass the dreadfull fold.

The Arabs also likened the constellation to a l'iab, while with all that
nation, heathen or Mul]ammadan, it was Al ~ the Hole in which the earth's axle found its bearing. Others of them, as well as the Persians, figured here the Ih1ilagji, the Myrobalanum, or Date-palm Seed or Fruit, which the grouped stars were . thought to resemble; but Hyde, writing the word Myrobalanaris, said that ' it signified one of their geometrical figures,- described by Ideler as bounded by our a, d, e, {, 1/, y, {3, a, /J, and the stars in the bead of Camelopardalis. In Persia, where this foregoing figure was popular, Ursa Minor also was Heft Bengh, Heft Averengh, or llaftunngh KihiD, the last word designating its inferiority in size to Ursa Major. Jensen sees here the Leopard of Babylonia, an emblem of darkness which this shared, there and in Egypt, with all other circumpolar constellations; while on the Nile it was the well-known laabl of Set; even as late as the Denderah zodiac. This Jackal also appears in the carvings on the walls of the Ramesseum, but is there shown with pendent tail stnlringly coin• ciding with the outlines of the constellation. Plutarch said that with the Phoenicians it was Doube or Dooher (?), similar to the Arabian title, but defined by Flammarion as the " Speaking Constellation,"- better, I think, the "Guiding One," indicating to their sailors the course to steer at sea. Jacob Bryant assigned it to Egypt, or Phoenicia. as Cahen ourah,- whatever that may be.
The early Danes and Icelanders knew it as the Smaller Charioti or Throne, of Thor; and their descendants still call it Litli Vagn, the Little Wagon; as also, but very differently, Fioa.konur i lopti, the Milkmaids of the Sky. But the Finns, apparently alone among the northern nations of Europe in this conception, have Va.hi Otawa, the Little Bear. Dante called the seven stars Cornu, doubtless then a common name, f<'r it appeared in Vespucci's .J6 Lettera as Bloomo, his editor erroneously ex• plaining this as a typographical error for carro, the wain; Eden and others oi his time translating this as the Home. And it has been the Spanish shepherds' similarly shaped BooiDa, a Bugle; and the Italian sailors' Bogina, a Boa. Caesius mentioned Oatuli, and Cane, Laoonieae, the Lapdogs or Puppies, and the Spartan Dogs, as titles for both of the Bears. With the Chinese it was Peih Bing.
Alruoaba, or .Alruocaba, which probably should be Al B.utbbah, is fim 1 found in tbe Alfonsine Tables, although the edition of 1521 applied it only to the lucida. While this generally is supposed to be from the Arabic Al llabbah, the Riders, Grotius asserted that it is from the Chaldee Bubb.

a Vehicle, the Hebrew B.ttht1bh; and, if so, would seem to be equivalent to the Wain and from the Hebrew editor of Alfonso. Others have thought it from B.ukbah, the Knee, as {J always has marked the forearm of the Bear, and Alrucaba, in a varied orthography, was current for that star some centuries ago, as it is now for Polaris. Riccioli gave a queerly combined name for the constellation, Dubherabbah; and Bayer had Bruooabah, ending his list of titles with Bua, a blunder in some connection with the commentator Aben Ezra, whom he often cited as an authority; still Riccioli followed him in this. The Geneva Bi6k, rendering the Hebrew 'Ash, etc., by "Arcturus with his Sonnes," incorrectly added the marginal note, "the North Star with those that are about him." Caesius typified the constellation as the Chariot sent by Joseph to bring his father down into Egypt, or that in which Elijah was carried to heaven; or as the Bear that David slew. Young astronomers now know it as the Little Dipper. In the old German manuscript already alluded to mention is made of
Ursa Minor under the North Pole, which is called by another name Tramcmtluut (i. e. because on one side or the Mons Coelius, whereon sits the Pole Star);
thus indicating another origin for this name than that found undet Polaris as from the Mediterranean nations. I have seen no explanation of this, yet frequent references are met with in early records to some mountain located in the North as the seat of the gods and the habitation of life, the South being "the abode of the prince of death and of demons." Sayce writes:
In early Sumerian days the heaven was believed to rest on the peak of" the mountain of the world" in the far northeast, where the gods had their habitations (cf. Isai. xiv, 13) [the mount of congregation, in the uttermost parts of the north], while an ocean or "deep" encircled the earth which rested upon its surface.
Von Herder referred to it as
Albordy, the dazzling mountain, on which was held the assembly of the gods;
and identified it with " the holy mountain of God" alluded to in the Book of the .PropMI Eukiel, xxviii, 14; and Professor Whitney quoted from the 62d verse of the ut chapter of the Surya Siddltanta :
the mountain which is the seat of the gods ;
and from the 34th verse of the 12th chapter:

The Norscmen had the same idea in their Himinbiorg, the Hill of Heaven, and the abode of Heimdallr, the guardian of the bridge Bifrost, the Rainbow, which united the earth to .Asaheimr, or Asgard, the Yard, City, or Stronghold of the Ass, their gods, and the Olympus of Northem mythology. While far back of them the Egyptians supported their heavenly vault by four mountains, one at each of the cardinal points. Towards our day,in the report by "Christophorus Colonus, the Admyrall," recorded by Peter Martyr, we read that the great discoverer thought

Columbus called this Paria, asserting that it contained Paradise; but it would seem from his narrative that he located it somewhere in the neighborhood of his discoveries between North and South America. Even in Chilmead's Treatise, more than a century after Columbus, we find serious reference to this mythical mountain as

May we not see in these the origin of Mons Coelius, the Heavenly Mountain, and of the name Tramontana from our constellation's location above that celestial elevation ? And I would here call attention to the old story of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus,2 who, under the persecution of Decius in
our 3d century, slumbered for nearly 200 years in the grotto under the similarly named Mount Coelian; these worthy successors of Epimenides the Cnosian and predecessors of our Rip Van Winkle being early associated 1 with the seven stars of Ursa Major, and so perhaps with this, the Minor. The latter's genethliacal influence was similar to that of its companion: the Prince, in Tennyson's Princess, thus accounting for his temperament:
For on my cradle shone the Northern star;

Phoenioe was the early Greek name, borrowed from its constellation, for this "lovely northern light" and the "most practically useful star in the heavens"; but for many centuries it has been Stella Polaria, the PolHtar, or simply Polaril,- Riccioli's Poll.aria; this position seeming to be first recognized in literature by Dante when he wrote in the .Paradiso:
the month imagine of the horn That in the point heginneth of the axis Round about which the primal wheel revolves.
Euclid said in his Phainomma :
A star is visible between the Bears, not changing its place, but always revolving upon itself;
Hipparchos, that the pole was "in a vacant spot forming a quadrangle with three other stars," both of these calling this IIolor, the Po/us of Lucan, Ovid, and other classical Latins; and Euphratean observers had called their pole-star Pill, or Bll. But, although other astronomical writers used these words for some individual star, there is no certainty as to which was intended, for it should be remembered that during many millenniums the polar point has gradually been approaching our pole-star, which 2000 years ago was far removed from it,-in Hipparchos' time 12° 241 away according to his own statement quoted by Marinus of Tyre and cited by Ptolemy. Miss Clerke writes as to this : 29•.

The entire millennium before the Christian era may count for an interregnum as iqards Pole-stars. Alpha Draconis had ceased to exercise that office; Alruccabab had not ya assumed it.
Kochab (the {J of Ursa Minor), and ,c of Draco, at different times in that epoch, may have been considered as this pole-star, the last a 4th-magnitude about 10° distant from the true pole; although the 5th-magnitude /J, 4c away in Eratosthenes' day, perhaps was intended. And this is not unlikely, as this inconspicuous object, for some reason, was sufficiently noteworthy among the Chinese to bear the title How Kung, the Empress. The tit, q>av~,;, "ever visib!e," of the 5th-century Stobaeus may have referred to our Polaris, then about 7° distant from the pole. The fact that the Polaris of his day did not exactly mark the pole was noted by Pytheas, the Greek astronomer and navigator of Massilia, the modern Marseilles, about 320 B. c. ; and till this discovery the belief was prevalent that the heavenly pole was absolutely fixed, In none of the foregoing cases does a single star seem to be mentioned as a guide in navigation ; but as knowledge in this art increased, our a took the place of its constellation as Stella Jfaria, a title that Saint Jerome, in his 0111Jmasticon, applied to the Virgin Mary; there, however, with no marine, or stellar, connection. But a star, being always a symbol of sanctity, was peculiarly so of the holie~t of women, so that this title of the chief star of heaven was adopted as one interpretation of her Jewish name Miriam. ! Bayer's la Tramontana was well known before his day, for Eden translated from the First Decade, printed in 1511, "cauled by the Italians Tramontana"; and Jehan de Mandeville (" syr lohn Maundauile ") more than a century before the discovery of our continent, in his statement of his belief in the sphericity of the earth, wrote of it as
the Stun TnDaumtlme, that is dept the 8tun of the Bee, that is unmevable, and that i,, :oward the Northe, that we clepen the Lou Stun.
One derivation of this transmontane is from the fact that the nations along the Mediterranean saw the star beyond their northern mountain boundary; and the word appears in the popular saying, current among the Latin races. of a man's "losing his Tramontane" when one had lost his bearings. Another earlier and much more probable origin, however, is from a title for the constellation already alluded to. Similarly the Finns know Polaris as Taehti, the Star at the Top of the Heavenly Mountain. Anglo-Saxons ofthe 10th century said that it was the Saip-steorra, the Shipstar; Eden, "cauled of the Spanyardes llortea"; Bayer, A.ngel Stem, the

Pivot Star, and the Latin JiaTiptoria; while it was the Steering Star to early English navigators, who
knew no North, but when the Pole Star shone.
Andrew Marvell, strangely the common friend of John Milton and King Charles II, said: By night the northern star their vray directs ;
and Thomas Moore wrote, in his Light ofthe Haram:
that star, on starry nights The seaman singles from the sky To steer his bark for ever by.
Thus, as the leading star, it became the Loautar, or Locleatar, of early English authors; Spenser saying :
The pilot can no loadstar see,
and Shakespeare's Helena, in A Midsummer Night's Dream, tells Hermia
Your eyes are lodestars.
Bryant beautifully alludes to its office in these verses from his Hymn to the .1Vorlh Siar:
Constellations come, and climb the heavens, and go. Star of the Pole ! lllld thou dost see them set. Alone in thy cold skies, Thou keep'st thy old unmoving station yet, Nor join'st the dances of that glittering train, Nor dipp'st thy virgin orb in the blue western main.

a designation of Polaris which has everywhere become common; while Oillonra and Cynonra regularly appeared in scientific works of the 17th and 18th centuries; but this was one of the ancients' titles for the whole of Ursa Minor, and never, by them, limited to the lucida. The Starof A.ready either referred to Arcadia, the earthly home of Kallisto, or to Areas, her son, transferred to the skies by his father Jove, when ignorantly about to slay his mother after her transformation. The poet, however, followed a common error in locating Areas here, for he properly was identified with , Bootes. The Chinese had several names for it,- Pih ][eih; Ta Shin; Tien Hwang , Ta Ti, the Great Imperial Ruler of Heaven, the circumpolar stars circling around it in homage, the whole forming the Purple Subtle Bnolonre; and Ti or Ti TIO, the Emperor's Seat, this last also being borne by a Heiculis.

However this may be, it seems certain that some polar star, or constellation, has been used in China from remote antiquity. In earliest Northem India the star nearest the pole was known as On· ~ the Pivot of the Planets, representing the great god Dhruva, and Al Biriini said that among the Hindus of his time it was Dhruva himself. It was an object of their worship, as our Polaris is to-day among the Mandaeans 1 along the Tigris and lower Euphrates. The Arabs knew Polaris as Al :Jiblah, "because it is the star least distant from the pole," although then 5° away, and helped them, in any strange location distant from an established place of worship, to know the points

They also called it Al Jadl, the Young He Goat, whkh subsequently degenerated to Judclah, as Niebuhr heard it a century ago, and known in Desert story as Giedi, the slayer of the dead man on the Bier of Ursa Major. Wetzstein says that in Damascus it is called 11'.iamir; a Needle or Nail. As marking the north pole it bore the latter's title, Al iu~b al Bb81Dilin, the N orthem Axle, or Spindle, from Al ~u~b, the Pin fixed in the under stone of a mill around which the upper stone turns; and this same thought later appeared in English poetry, as in Marlowe's History of Doctor Faustus, · where he says of the stars that
All jointly move upon one axletree Whose terminine is term'd the world's wide pole.
The Arabian astronomers knew it as Al Xaubb 2 al Shamilin, the Star of the North, an appellation perhaps given by their nomad ancestors to /3 as nearer the pole in their time.

The Alfonsine Ta/Jles of 1521 have Alrucaba el est Stella polaris sive Iv/us; and Bayer, Alruocabah seu B.uocabahismaelilis; but this was shared with the next star, as also with the constellation.

I This ancient Square House, probably an early Sabaean temple, was built, tradition says, first in heaven; then for Adam on earth as a tabernacle of radiant clouds let down by the angels directly under its celestial site. This, disappearing at his death, was replaced by one of stone and clay by the patriarch Seth, that in its tum was swept away by the Deluge. Lastly it was erected by Abraham and Ishmael to contain the Black Stone, Al l:fajar al Aswad, a ruby, or jacinth, brought from heaven by Gabriel and now blackened by the pilgrims' tears, or because so often kissed by sinners; but it is generally regarded by unbelievers as a meteorite. The Cmt,u,y CyeUJ/dia, however, describes it as an irregular oval about seven inches in diameter, composed of about a dozen smaller stones of various shapes and sizes. The Stone is set into the northeast corner of the wall, at a convenient height for kissing. 2 Kaukab is the same as the Assyrian and Chaldaean word Kakkab, the Hebrew Koqibh; this last also the fighting name of Bar Cochab, the Son of a Star, who was the leader of the second revolt of the Jews in 132-135, during the reign of Hadrian, his slulels bearing a star over a tetrastyle temple. The name was variously written, but correctly as Bar Coziba, from his birthplace.

These were known by the Arabs as one star, Allfi' al l!'ar~, the Dim One of the Two Calves, but by us as Pherbd Kajor and Pherkad Kinor, 57 minutes of arc apart. With /3 and others they were the Danoen, and with /3 alone the Guards, or Wardena, of the Pole, that old Thomas Hood said were

While Eden, in the Arie of Navigation which he " Englished out of the Spanyshe," in 1561, from Martin Cortes' communication to King Charles V, mentioned " two starres called the Guardianl, or the Kouth of the Horne"; and still earlier, in his translation of Peter Martyr, "the Guarden■ of the north pole." Shakespeare, in Othello, wrote:
The wind-sbak'd surge, with high and monstrous mane Seems to cast water on the burning Bear, And quench the guards of th' ever fixed pole.

Yildun is generally given to this, probably from the Turkish Yilduz that is better applied to a; but it has degenerated to Vildiur, and the Cmlv] .Dictionary has Gildun, perhaps by a typographical error.

the Anglo-Saxon lla,den, the Anglo-Norman Paloele, the French V'uqe, the Italian Virgine, Bayer's lunckfraw, and the present German 1-mg{rlll, - in fact a universal title,- generally has been figured with the palm branch in her right hand and the spica, or ear of wheat, in her left. Thus she was known in the Attic dialect as K6p11, the Maiden, representing Ptraephone, the Roman Prol8l'J)ina, daughter of Demeter, the Roman Ceres; while in the Ionic dialect Nonnus, of our 5th century, called her ,r;a·



The Constellations
XlJWMK' KovP'J, the Wheat-bearing Maiden, lpiaifera Virgo Cereril, the
Virgo ■pioea munera geatanl of Manilius. When regarded as Proserpina, she was being abducted by Pluto in his Chariot, the stan of adjacent Libra; and the constellation also was Dem.et.er herself, the Ceres ■picifera clea, changed by the astrologers to Ariata, Harvest, of which Ceres
was goddess. Caesius had it Arina Puellae, that would seem more correct
as Ariatae Puella, the Maiden of the Harvest. Those who claim very high antiquity for the zodiacal signs assert that the idea of these titles originated when the sun was in Virgo at the spring equinox, the time of the Egyptian harvest. This, however, carries them back nearly 15,000 years, while Aratos said that Leo first marked the harvest month ; so that another signification has been given to the word araxvwm1r- We read, too, that
In Ogygian ages and among the Orientals, she was represented as a sun-burnt dam~, with an ear of com in her hand, like a gleaner in the fields;
and, like most of that class, with a very different character from that assigned to her by the classic authors. Is it not this ancient story of the Maiden of the Wheat-fleld that is still seen in the North English and South Scottish custom of the Kem-baby, or Kemababy,- the Com, or Kernel, Baby,'thus described by Lang in his Custom and Myth I
The last gleanings of the last field are bound up in a mde imitation of the human shape, and dressed in some rag-tags of finery. The usage has fallen into the conservative hands of children, but of old "the Maiden" was a regular image of the harvest-goddess, which, with a sickle and sheaves in her arms, attended by a crowd of reapers, and accompanied with music, followed the last carts home to the farm. It is odd enough that the " Maiden" should exactly translate the old Sicilian name of the daughter of Demeter. "The Maiden" has dwindled, then, among us to the rudimentary Kemababy; but ancient Peru had her own Maiden, her Harvest Goddess.
And in Vendee the farmer's wife, as the com-mother, is tossed in a blanket with the last sheaf to bring good luck in the subsequent threshing. Perhaps Caesius had some of this in view when he associated our sky figure with Ruth, the Moabitess, gleaning in the fields of Boaz. Virgo also was Erl.gone,- perhaps from the Homeric 'Ep,yive,a, the Early Born, for the constellation is very old,- a stellar title appearing in Vergil's apotheosis of his patron Augustus. This was the maiden who hung herself in grief at the death of her father Icarius, and was transported to the skies with Icarius as Bootes, and their faithful hound Maira as Procyon, or Sirius; all of which is attested by Hyginus and Ovid. It may have been this Icarian story that induced Keats' Lines on Ike Mermaid Tavern.

Sometimes she was figured with the Scales in her hands,
Astraea's scales have weighed her minutes out, Poised on the zodiac,
whence she has been considered Jll"'I, the divinity of Justice, the Roman
luta or lutitia; and Altra.N, the starry daughter of Themis, the last ol the celestials to leave the earth, with her modest sister Pudicitia, when the Brazen Age began. Ovid wrote of this:
Virgo caede madentes, Ultima coelestum, terras Astraea reliquit;
when, according to Aratos, she
Soared up to heaven, selecting this abode, Whence yet at night she shows herself to men.
Thus she is the oldest purely allegorical representation of innocence and virtue. This legend seems to be first found with Hesiod, and was given in full by Aratos, his longest constellational history in the Pltai11omena. Other author~ mentioned her as Elp~Vf/, Irene, the sister of Astraea, and the Pu of the Romans, with the olive branch ; as Conoorc1ia; as IlaplJevor t..irx;, the Virgin Goddess; as ~l(3v.til.a, the Singing Sibyl, carrying a branch into Hades; and as Tvt'I, the Roman Fortuna, because she is a headless constellation, the stars marking the head being very faint. Classical Latin writers occasionally called her Ano, Atargada, and Deroete, the Byrorum Dea transferred here from Pisces; Cybele drawn by lions, for our Leo immediately precedes her; Diana; Jlinerva; Panela and Pan· tioa; and even XedUL Posidippus, 289 B. c., gave Th•bia or Thelpia, daughter of Thespius, or of the Theban Asopus; and some said that one of the Muses, even Urania herself, was placed here in the sky by Apollo. •AarroAta is from Kircher, who in turn took it from the Coptic Egyptians. the Stali'o amoris, quem in incremento Nili dii ostmde/Jant. This, however, is singularly like 'H IloAta~, designating Minerva as guardian of citadels and the State, already seen as a title for this constellation; and there was a Coptic Asphulia in Leo as a moon station. In Egypt Virgo was drawn on the zodiacs of Denderah and Thebes, much disproportioned and without wings, holding an object said to be a distaff marked by the stars of Coma Berenices; while Eratosthenes and Avienus identified her with Ilia, the thousand-named goddess, with the



The Constellations
wheat ears in her hand that she afterwards dropped to form the Milky Way, or clasping in her arms the young Horus, the infant Southern sungod, the last of the divine kings. This very ancient figuring reappeared in the Middle Ages as the Virgin J[ary with the child Jesus, Shakespeare alluding to it in Titus Andronicus as the
Good Boy in Virgo's lap;
and Albertus Magnus, of our 13th century, asserted that the Saviour's horoscope lay here. It has been said that her initials, MV, are the symbol for the sign, 111 ; although the International Di&tiona,y considers this a monogram of flap, the first syllable of Ilap(Jti,o~, one of Virgo's Greek titles; and others, a rude picturing of the wing of Iatar, the divinity that the Semites assigned to its stars, and prominent in the Epic of Creation. This Iatar, or llhtar, the Queen of the Stars, was the Ashtoreth of the 1st Book of the Kings, xi, 5, 33, the original of the Aphrodite of Greece and the Venus of Rome; perhaps equivalent to Athyr, Athor, or Hathor of the Nile, and the Astarte of Syria, the last philologically akin to our Esther and Star, the Greek 'AaTf/P· Astarte, too, was identified by the Venerable Bede with the Saxon goddess of spring, Eostre, at whose festival, our Easter, the stars of Virgo shine so brightly in the eastern evening sky ; and the Sumerians of southern Babylonia assigned this constellation to their sixth month as the Errand, or Message, of !star. In Assyria Virgo represented Baaltit, Belat, Belit, and Beltit, Bel's wife; while some thought her the Mylitta of Herodotus. But this was a very different divinity, the Babylonian Molatta, the Moon, the Mother, or Queen, of Heaven, against whose worship the Jews were warned in the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah, xliv, 17, 19, and should not be confounded with Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, that our figure symbolized. In India Virgo was Kanya, the Tamil Xalllli, or Maiden,- in Hyde's transcription, Xannae, mother of the great Krishna, figured as a Goclclw sitting before a fire, or as a Gil; and in the Cingalese zodiac as a Woman in a Ship, with a stalk of wheat in her hand. Al Biriini thought this ship marked by the line of stars /3, 1/, y, «f, and f, like a ship's keel. Vara.ha
Mihira borrowed the Greek name, turning it into Parthena, Part.iDa, or PathODL
In Persia it was Xbolba, or Xhlllit, the Ear of Wheat, and Seodeidoa de Danama, this last often translated the " Virgin in Maiden Neatness"; but Ideler, doubting this, cited Beigel's conjecture that it was a Persian rendering of Staohya, one of the Greek titles of Virgo's star Spica. Bayer had it SeoJenidoa de Danama.
The early Arabs made from some members ot the constellation the

enormous Lion of their sky; and of others the Kennel Corner, with dogs barking at the Lion. Their later astronomers, however, adopted the Greek figure, and called it Al 'Adhri' al lla.~ the Innocent Maiden, remains of which are found in the mediaeval titles B1ac1ari, Bleadari, Adrendma, and in the Adrenedeea of Albumasar. But as they would not draw the human form, they showed the stars as a sheaf of wheat, Al Sunbulah, or as some stalks with the ripened ears of the same, from the Roman Spica, its brightest star. Kazwini gave both of these Arabian names, the last degenerating into Sunbala, found in Bayer, and Bumbela, still occasionally seen. The Almagest of 1515 says Virgo est Spica.
The Turcomans knew the constellation as Dufbisa Patbua, the Pure Virgin; and the Chinese, as She Bang lieu, the Frigid Maiden; but before their Jesuit days it was Shun Wei, which Miss Clerke translates the Serpent, but Williams, the Quail'■ Tail, a part of the early stellar figure otherwise known as the B.ed Bird, Pheuant, or Phoem
It appears as Ki, the 20th in the Euphratean cycle of ecliptic constellations, and considered equivalent to Asru, a Place, i. e. the moon station that Spica marked; but Jensen thinks that the original should be Bin, or Shira, perhaps meaning the " Ear of Com" ; IJlUCh of this also is individually applied to Spica. In the land of Judaea Virgo was Bethfilah, and, being always associated with the idea of abundance in harvest, was assigned by the Rabbis to the tribe of Asher, of whom Jacob had declared "his bread shall be fat." In Syria it was Bethulta. Thus, like Isis, one of her many prototypes, Virgo always has been a much named and symbolized heavenly figure; Landseer saying of it, "so disguised, so modernized and be-Greek'd . . . that we literally don't know her when we see her." In astrology this constellation and Gemini were the H01118 of J[ereurJ, Macrobius saying that the planet was created here; the association being plainly shown by the caduceus of that god, the herald's trumpet entwined with serpents, instead of the palm branch, often represented in her left hand. But usually, and far more appropriately, Virgo's stars have been given over to the care of Ceres, her namesake, the long-time goddess of the harvest. For her astrological colors Virgo assumed black speckled with blue; and was thought of as governing the abdomen in the human body, and as beJring rule over Crete, Greece, Mesopotamia, Turkey, Jerusalem, Lyons, and Paris, but always as an unfortunate, sterile sign. Manilius asserted that in his day it ruled the fate of Arcadia, Caria, Ionia, Rhodes, and the Doric plains. Ampelius assigned to it the charge of the wind Argestes, that blew

to the Romans from the west-southwest according to Vitruvius, or from the west-northwest according to Pliny. The latter said that the appearance of a comet within its borders implied many grievous ills to the female portion of the population. Virgo was associated with Leo and with the star Sirius in the ancient opinion that, when with the sun, they were a source of heat; Ovid alluding to this in his Ars Amaloria:
Virginis aetheriis cum caput ardet equis.
And John Skelton, the royal orator of King Henry VII, wrote:
In autumn when the sun in Viz1me By radiant heat enripened hath our corne.
A coin of Sardis, the capital of the kingdom of Lydia, bears her figure with the wheat ear in her left hand and a staff in her right; and the slateres of Macedonia have much the same. The A/fo11si11e Ta/Jles showed her as a very young girl with wings; the Leydm Manuscript and the Hyginus of 1488, as a young woman with branch and caduceus; and the AI/J11111asar of 1489, as a woman with a fillet of wheat ears. The old German illustration also gave her wings, but dressed her in a high-necked, trailing gown; and Diirer drew her as a lovely winged angel. Julius Schiller used her stars to represent Saint Jamee the Leu, and Weigel, as the Seven Portugueee Towers.
But all these figurings, ancient as some of them may be, are modem when compared with the still enduring Sphinx generally claimed as prehistoric, perhaps of the times of the Hor-she-shu, long anterior to the first historical Egyptian ruler, Menes; and constructed, according to Greek tradition, with Virgo's head on Leo's body, from the fact that the sun passed through these two constellations during the inundation of the Nile. Some Egyptologists, however, would upset this astronomical connection of the Virgin, Lion, and Sphinx, Mariette claiming the head to be that of the early god Harmachis, and others as of an early king. Ptolemy extended the constellation somewhat farther to the east than we have it, the feet being carried into the modem Libra, and the stars that Hipparchos placed in the shoulder shifted to the side, to correct, as he said, the comparative distances of the stars and members of the body. Upon our maps it is about 52° in length, terminating on the east at.landμ, and so is the longest of the zodiac figures. It is bounded on the north by Leo, Coma Berenices, and Bootes; on the east by Serpens and Libra; on the

south by Hydra, Corvus and Crater; and on the west by Leo, Crater, and Corvus. While the beautiful Spica is its most noteworthy object to the casual observer, yet the telescope shows here the densest nebular region in the heavens, in the space marked by its /3, 1/, y, d, and Denebola of Leo; while other nebulae are scattered all over this region of the sky. Sir William Herschel found here no less than 323, which later search has increased to over 500,- very many more nebulae than naked-eye stars in the constellation. Argelander gives 101 of the latter, and Heis 181. It is for these four stars in Virgo, forming with e two sides of a right· angled triangle open towards Denebola, y at its vertex, that Professor Young uses his mnemonic word Begde to recall their order. They extend along the wings through the girdle, and were the Kennel Corner of the Barking Dop of the Arabs, often considered as the Doga themselves. Von Zach, of Gotha, rediscovered here on the last day of the first year of this century the minor planet Ceres, whose position had been lost some time after its discovery by Piazzi on the previous New Year's Day; Oll>ers repeating this, and independently, the next evening, the first anniversal}· of the original discovery. Here, too, Olbers found, on the 28th of March, 1802, another minor planet, Pallas, the second one discovered, and appropriately named, for the thirty-first of the Orphic Hymns described this goddess as "inhabiting the stars." The sun passes through the constellation from the 14th of September to the 29th of October; and during this time
the Virgin trails No more her glittering garments through the blue.

Spica signifies, and marks, the Ear of Wheat shown in the Virgin's left hand-Aratos wrote "in her hands"; Vitruvius and Hyginus, "in her right hand"- when she was thought to be Ceres. All the Romans called it thus, Cicero saying Bpioum, and their descendants, the modem Italians, Bpigha.; the French have l'Epi. In Old England it was the Virgin'18pib, and even Flamsteed thus designated it. For at least twenty-fivecenturies,and among all civilized peoples, the Latin word, or words of similar import, has obtained; although Smyth mentioned an attempt before his day to secure: for it the illustrious name of Newton. l:rdxv~, perhaps of the same signification although another has beell assigned to it, appeared with Aratos, Hipparchos, and Ptolemy, transcribed by the Latins as Btachy1, Manetho had l:ra,tvWMJ~, which we have seen



The Constellations
used for Virgo by another Graeco-Egyptian author, Nonnus. Bayer cited Ariata for the star as for the constellation ; Ariatae Pa.ell& occurs in some Latin doggerel by Caesius; as the brightest of the figure it bore the latter's Brigone; whiie Vindemitor and Vindemiator, which better belong to e, have been applied to it.
Othertitles-SUDbala; SUDbale; Sumbela; Riccioli'sSumbalet,Som.balet, Sembalet Eleanclri; and Schickard's Sunbalon-are from SUDbulah and Al' Adhri', Arabic words synonymous respectively with Spica and Virgo, although Hyde derived them from l:.i{JvUa, the Singing Sibyl, of the constellation. Al Biriini said that it was Al ~ulbah, the Bristle, but his explanation of this only served to show the strange confusion in titles that existed in the Arab mind between Spica and Al J?afirah in the Lion's tail. And Al Birilni, again, said that it was the Calf of the Lion, with Arcturus as the second Calf; but Kazwini designated it as ~ al Al&d, the Shin-bone of the Lion, this Lion being the enormous figure already alluded to, of which a part of Virgo formed one of the legs. A still more widely spread native name in the Desert was Al Simik al A'al, the Defenceless, or Unarmed, Simak, i. e. unattended by any near-by star; the other Simak, Arcturus, being armed with a lance, or staff, represented by adjacent stars of Bootes; and it doubtless was this isolated position ot Spica that induced the Coptic title Xhorit.oa, Solitary. The Aljonsine Tal,ks turned Simak al A'zal into inermia Aaimeo, adding Acimon, Alaraph, Almucedie "of the Chaldaeans," and Alacel; while the 1515 Almagest had Alchimeoh inermil. From all these come Bayer's Alaazel, Alazel, Azim.on, Alzimon "of the Nubians," Razimet Alazel, the alchemists' Alhaiaeth, Riccioli's Bltaameoti and EJty.rnach, and the Azimeoh still occasionally seen. Scaliger had Razimeth Albacel, and Schickard Huzimethon. Riccioli cited a" Nubian" title, Eleazalet, that some have said came from Al 'Azalah, the Hip-bone, but it probably belongs among the derivatives from A'zal; and his Eleadari has been transferred to Spica from the constellation. This star marked the 12th 111a11zil, Al Sllllik, and in early astrology was, like all of Virgo, a sign of unfruitfulness and a portent of injustice to innocence; but later on, of eminence, renown, and riches. Chrysococca called it μucp6r KovTaptiTO(', the Little Lance-bearer, Arcturus being Kov,apciTor par excellence. And Hyde gave the Hebrew Shibbo-ieth, the Syrian 8hebbelti, the Persian Chiiahe, and the Turkish Salkim, all signifying the " Ear of Wheat "; other names being the Persian Qpur, the ~ h a of the A11esta, the Sogdian Shaghar and Khorasmian Aklllh&farn, all meaning a" Point "-i.e. Spica. The Hindus knew it as Oitri, Bright, their 12th naltshatra, figured as a Lamp, or as a Pearl, with Tvashtar, the Artificer, or Shaper, as its presiding

divinity; and some have thought it the Tiltar Star that generally has been identified with Sirius. In Babylonia, and representing the whole constellation, it personified the wife of Bil, and as Ba-8h&-8hirii, the Virgin's Girdle, marked the 20th ecliptic asterism of that name, and the lunar asterism Dan-nu, the Hero of ' the Sky Furrow. It was also bub Tin-tir-Ki, the Might of the Abode of ' Life, a common title for Babylon itself. In Chinese astronomy Spica was a great favorite as Xi6, the Hom, or Spike, anciently Xeolr. or Guilr., the special star of springtime; and with { formed their nth sim under that title. Naturally it was the determinant It is said to have been known at one time in Egypt as the Lu•Beanr, and was evidently of importance, for another Egyptian name was Bepi, the Lord; and Lockyer thin ks that the great " Mena may symbolize Spica, 11·ith which star we have seen Min-worship associated." According to this same author, one of the temples at Thebes, probably dedicated to this Mena, Menat, Menes, Min, or Khem, was oriented to Spica's setting about 3200 B. c.; and the temple of the Sun at Tell al Amama was also so oriented about 2000 B. c., or perhaps somewhat later. A similar character attached to it in Greece, for two temples have been found at Rhamnus, "almost touching one another, both following (and with accordant dates) the shifting places of Spica," at their erection 1092• and 747 B. c.; "and still another pair at Tegea." Temples of Here were also so oriented at Olympia 1445 B. c., at Argos and Girgenti; and those of Nike Apteros at Athens, u30 B. c., and of" the Great Diana of the Ephesians," 715 B. c. It was to the observations of this star and of Regulus about 300 B. c.,recorded by the Alexandrian Timochares, that, after comparison with bis own 150 years later, Hipparchos was indebted for the great discovery attributed to him of the precession of the equinoxes; although Babylonian records. and the temple orientation of Egypt and Greece, may indicate a far earlier practical knowledge of this. According to Ptolemy, Timochares observed an occultation bytheplanet Venus of an unidentified star" on the tip of Virgo's wing,"-perhaps;, or q,- on the 12th of October, 271 B. c.1
1 A still earlier record of the planet, dating from 686 B. c., is on a tablet from Chaldaea D01I in the British Museum; while earlier still are Homer's" Ea,neor, the Latin Hespenas,
and Isaiah's the brightest sw- that shines in Heav'n :

that our A"tlwrised VenilJn rendered "Lucifer," the equivalent of the Greek alternati.-e titles 'Ewa,pueo~ and <l>warroeo~, the Latin Phosphorus. The identity of this Morning Star with the Evening Star Hesperus was discovered by Pythagoras, or by Parmenides, in tbe 5th century before Christ. The planet also was known as '.Arpeorll~q, as Juno's Star, and as Isis.



The Constellations
Spectroscopic observations by Vogel in 1890 show that Spica is in revolution with a speed of at least fifty-six miles a second in an orbit of three millions of miles' radius, around the common centre of gravity of itself and an obscure companion in a period of about four days. It is, however, never eclipsed by the latter, as is the case with the star Algol. Its spectrum is Sirian; and the system is approaching us at the rate of 9.2 miles a second. Gould thinks that it shows fluctuations in brilliancy. It is one of the lunar stars much utilized in navigation, and lies but 2° south of the ecliptic, and 10° south of the celestial equator, coming to th~ meridian on the 28th of May. With Denebola, Arcturus, and Cor Caroli it forms the Diamond of Virgo, 50° in extent north and south.
~' 3.9, pale yellow.
Za.vijava, a universal name in modem catalogues, is first found with Piazzi, but is Za.rijan in the Standard .Dictionary. It is from Al Ziwiah, the Angle, or Comer, ;, e. Kennel, of the Arab Dogs,- although ')' exactly marks this Comer and should bear the title. The stars {3, 'I, y, d, e, outlining this Kennel, formed the 11th mansil, Al 'Awwi', the Barker, which was considered of good omen; while Firuzabadi included it with the preceding moon station Al ~arfah,- /3 Leonis,- in the group Al llahrin, the Two Rivers, as their rising was in the season of heavy rains. Other indigenous titles were Al Bard, the Cold, which it was said to produce; and Warak al Alad, the Lion's Haunches.
IJ marked the 18th ecliptic constellation of Babylonia, Bhepu-arkii Iha-A, the Hind Leg of the Lion, for this country also seems to have had one of these creatures here. With f/, it perhaps was llinlar, the Lady of Heaven, probably a reference to !star; and Urra-gal, the God of the Great City; and one of the seven pairs of stars famous in that astronomy. As a Euphratean lunar asterism it bore the same title llinlar, but this included all the components of the Arabs' Kennel Corner. These also were the Persian Kuhaha, the Sogdian l!'utuhat, the Khorasmian Afluat, and the Coptic Abukia, all of the Arabic signification. In China it was Yew mii l!'a; the Right-hand Maintainer of Law. /3 is 13° south of Denebola in Leo, culminating with it on the 3d of May.

menta or Carmentis, worshiped and at times invoked by their women. Porrima was known as Prora and Proia by Aulus Genius of our 2d century. y was specially mentioned by Kazwini as itself being &wiat al 'Awn', the Angle, or Comer, of the Barker; and Al Tizini, with Ulug Beg, had much the same name for it; but Al Birtini, quoting from Al Zajjaj, said that" these people are all wrong," and that 'Awwa' here meant" Tum," referring to the tum, or bend, in the line of stars. This interesting early figure is noticeable even to the casual observer, y being midway between Spica and Denebola, the sides of the Kennel stretching off to the north and west, respectively marked by 'I and /3, d and e. In Babylonia it marked the 19th ecliptic constellation, Bhur-mahri-llliri the Front, or West, Shur(?); while individually it was Xakbb Dan-nu, the Star of the Hero, and the reference point in their annals of an observation of Saturn 1 on the 1st of March, 228 B. c., the first mention of this planet that we have, and recorded by Ptolemy. The Chinese knew y as &hang Seang, the High Minister of State. Astronomers consider the two stars alternately variable in light; and some call both yellow, so following the apparent rule of similar coloration in components of binaries when of equal brilliancy; those unequal being of contrasting colors. In 1836 they showed as a single star in the largest telescope then in use; but now are 6" apart, moving in an orbit more eccentric than any other as yet well determined, with a period of revolution esti• mated at aboLJt 190 years. The position angle in 1890 was 330°. They are of special interest to astronomers, as well as a show object to all. They culminate on the 17th of May.

On the Euphrates it was Lu Lim, the Gazelle, Goat, or Stag,- or perhaps King; and, withe, probably Ku-tab-ba, another of the seven pairs ofTwinstars of that country. The Hindus called it .ipa, or 1.pu, the Waters; and the Chinese, Tae Seang, the Second Minister of State.

is found as late as Flamsteed; Vinclemitor, with Ovid and Pliny; and Provindemiator and Provinclemia major, with Vitruvius; all signifying the "Grape-gatherer," from its rising in the morning just before the time of the vintage. These titles were translations of the IJ.po-rpvye-r;,p, IJ.po-rpvyeTf/f, ITporpiryET~, and Tpvye-r;,p, used by Ptolemy, Plutarch, and other Greek authors, the first of these words appearing in the .Phainomma, and rendered the " Fruit-plucking Herald"; but it is in a line of the poem considered doubtful; Riccioli had Protrigetrix. This profusion of titles from the earliest times indicates the singular interest with which this now inconspicuous star was regarded in classical astronomy.· The Century Cyclopedia has the following note on it:
At the time when the zodiac seems to have been formed (2100 B. c.) this star would first be seen at Babylon before sunrise about August 20, or, since there is some evidence that it was then brighter than it is now, perhaps a week earlier. This would seem too late for the vintage, so that perhaps this tradition is older than the zodiac.
The classical name was translated by the Arabians Kqclim al ~tif; and another title was Almureclin, still seen for it, perhaps from Al Muridin, Those Who Sent Forth. Traces of these words are found in the Alaoan, Aloalat, Alaraph, and Alm.uoeclie of Bayer's Uranometria. In China it was Tue Taeang, the Second General. On the Euphrates it may have been Kakka.b Kulu-m, the Star Man of Fire, possibly symbolizing the god Laterak, the Divine King of the Desert; although that title has been assigned to μ Virginis and d Librae. It marked the eastern boundary of the 11th manzil, and in astrology was a mischief-making star. It culminates on the 22d of May.
"IJ, Variable between 3 and 4.
Zaniah is from Al Ziwi&h, applied in German lists to this instead of to the stars (3 and y, all of these being in the Kennel. In China it was Tao Chih .Pa, the Left-hand Maintainer of Law. It lies on the left side of the Virgin, and just to the westward is the point of the autumnal equinox which the Chinese knew as Yih Kun, Two Kun, or Tien Kun, Heaven's Gate. With , it almost exactly marks the line of the celestial equator.

Moderns have no name for it, but in the Surya Sitldluinla it was ApuliAtlll, the Child of the Waters. . With another adjacent, but now unidentified, star, it was known in China as Ping Taou, the Plain and Even Way.
Byrma is from 'I.vpμa, used by Ptolemy to designate this star on the Train of the Virgin's robe. With " and 4' it was mentioned in the first Arabian translation of the Syn/axis as being in the ll'imar, or "skirt," of the garment; but the translator of the Latin edition of 1515, missing the point at the first letter, read the word as lfimar, "an ass," so that this central one of these three stars strangely appears in that work as i11 asino. They formed the 13th mansil, Al Ghafr, the Covering, as Smyth explains,
because the beauty of the earth is hidden when they rise on the 18th Tishrin, or 151 of November; others say on account of the shining of the stars being lessened as if COYCRd;
but K.azwini,
because, when they rise, the earth robes herself in her splendour and finery,-ber summer robes.
The Arabic word, however, is analogous to l:.vpμa, and so may have been taken from Ptolemy; although Al Biriini quoted from Al Zajjaj Al Ghafar, the Tuft in the Lion's tail, which it may have marked in the figure of the ancient Asad. Another signification of the word Ghafr is the" Young Ibex." Al Biriini also said that the Arabs considered this the most fortunate of their lunar stations, as lying between the evils of the Lion's teeth and claws on one side and the tail and venom of the Scorpion on the other. and quoted from a Rajaz poet:
The best night forever Lies between Al Zubioah and Al Asad;
adding that the horoscope of the Prophet lay here, and that the date oftbe birth of Moses coincided with it. As a lunar station these stars were the Sogdian Barwa and the Khorasmian Bhuhak, the Leader; the Persian Huoru, the Good Goer; and the
Coptic Khambalia, Crooked-clawed, .:t being substituted for f; and it is said that they were the Akkadian Lu Lim, the He Goat, Gazelle, or Stag, the original perhaps also meaning" King," and employed for cJ.

It has been included with cf Librae in the Akkadian lunar asterism Kulu Isi, a title also applied to e; the Sogdian Puarwa, and the Khorasmian Sa.ra•flariwa, both signifying the "One next to the Leader "-i.e. next to the lunar asterism ,, 11, and l. v, f, o, and rr, forming the head of Virgo, were the Chinese Buy Ping, the Inner Screen; p was Kew Heang, the_ Nine Officers of State, in which some smaller stars were included; o and T, Tien Teen, the Heavenly

is known in Italy as Volpe colla Ooa ; in Germany as Fuchs, or Fichlclum, mit der Gani; and in France as Petit Benard avec l'Oie. Smyth wrote that this is
a modern constellation, crowded in by Hevelius to occupy a space between the Arrow and the Swan, where the Via Lactea divides into two branches. For this purpose he ransacked the i,iformes of this bifurcation, and was so satisfied with the result, that the effigies figure in the elaborate print of his offerings to Urania. He selected it on account of the Eagle, Cerberus and Vultur Cadens. "I wished," said he, "to place a fox and a goose in the space of the sky well fitted to it; because such an animal is very cunning, voracious and fierce. Aquila and Vultur are of the same nature, rapacious and greedy."
The two members are sometimes given separately; indeed the An■er is often omitted. Flamsteed's Atlas shows both, but separates the titles; and Proctor arbitrarily combined both in his Vulpet. Astronomers now call the whole Vulpeoula.

general faintness would render it doubtful whether there ever bas been one, yet the Standard Dictionary says ofit under the word Amer:

and the Cmtury Dictionary has much the same. This may have been a, the ludda, a 4.4-magnitude just west of the Fox's head. A meteor stream, the Vulpeculicl1, appearing from the 13th of June to the 7th of July, radiates from a point in this constellation; but the latter's most noteworthy object is the Double-heaclecl Shot, or Dmn~bell, llebala, N. G. C. 6853, 27 M., just visible in a 1 1⁄4-inch finder, 7° southeast from the star Albireo.

has borne arbitrary, descriptive, or fanciful titles in every age. Anaxagoras, 550 B. c., and Aratos knew it as To rd.:la,
that shining wheel, men call it Milk;
Eratosthenes, as Kvdor ra..laffar, the Circle of the Galaxy; other Greek authors, as Kvc..lO(' ya..la,cn,c6r, the Galactic Circle; and Hipparchos, as 6 raM!tO(', the Galaxy. Galaxure, the Lovely One, of the Homeric Hy•• may have been the personification of this; and Galatea, the Milk-white, of the Iliad, for this nymph was a daughter of Oceanus, and the Galaxy was long known as Bridanlll, the Stream of Ocean. Indeed during all historic time it has been thought of as the River of H•ven. Such, too, was the Akkadian idea of it in connection with that of a Great Serpent; Brown writing of this:
No doubt the Great Serpent, in one of its mystic phases, is connected with tbeo.attnam-e. g., the Norse Kidhgardhlormr, the Welmm.-l}MUlll81' ("Stretcher-round-theworld "). But the Akkadian llllake-river, with whatever else it may be associated. ctr·

tainly also in one phase, and on the three Boundary-stones referred to, represents the Circu/,u .La£tnu. In W. A. I., II, 51, we read:
45. Akkadian Hid lsirra, Assyrian Nal,ru lsiri, =" River-of-the-Snake." Thus Hid
dagal, •• River " + "great" = Hiddekel (Genesis ii, 14).
46. Ak. Hid l11rra An gal, As. Nal,ru nsarka.ri Iii ral,i, ="River-of-the-cord-of-the. God great." 47. Ak. Hid s11al, gal, As. Nal,ru Aps!,i ral,i, =" River-of-the-Abyss great."
It also was the B.iver-of-the-8hephercl'1-hut, dust-cloud high, and the Akkadian Hid I11-ni-na, River-of-the-Divine-Lady; and, to quote again:
This Snake-river of sparkling dust, the stream of the abyss on high through which it runs, the golden cord of the heaven-god ( Prof. Sayce aptly refers to II. viii, 19), connected alike with the hill of the Sun-god and with the passage of ghosts, is the Milky Way; and it is the Bi,rer of ll'aa, wife of the heaven-god, as, in Greek mythology, it is connected with Herl.
Among the Arabs it was Al llahr, the River, a title that they afterwards transferred to the Greek constellation Eridanus; and those other Semites, the Hebrews, kne.w it as ll•har di liar, the River of Light; but the Rabbi Levi recurred to the Akkadian simile in saying that it was the Crookecl Serpent of the Book of Job, xxvi, 13. Usually, however, in Judaea it was Aroch,- in Armenia and Syria, Arocea,- not a lexicon word, but evidently from Arulfah, a Long Bandage, and well applied to this long band of light. In China, as in Japan, it was Tien Ho, the Celestial River, and the Silver lliver, whose fish were frightened by the new moon, which they imagined to be a hook ; although those countries also may have named it as we do, for in the She King are the lines by the emperor-poet Seuen. of the 8th century before Christ, translated by Legge:
and again:
Brightly resplendent in the sky revolved The Milky Way;
Vast is this Milky Way, Making a brilliant figure in the sky.
Al Biruni quoted from a Sanskrit tradition that it was Akiah Gangi, the Bed of the Ganges; but his other Hindu title, Kahira, is not explained. In North India it was Bhagwin ld Xaohahri, the Court of God, and Bwarp
Duiri, the Dove of Paradise. In Rome it was often thought of as the Heavenly Girdle, Coeli Cingal:am, and as a Circle; Pliny, calling it Ciroalaa laoteu, followed Cicero, who also said Orbia lacteu1, and made extended· allusion to it in his Vision of &ipio as" a radiant circle of dazzling brightness amid the flaming bodies." It is in this Vision that we find a graphic and beautiful description of the

nine heavenly crystal circles, the foundation of the old system of astronomy, from which issued the Harmony of the Spheres universally believed in till the times of Copernicus; but Eur~pides already had written of it:
Thee I invoke, thou self-created Being, who gave birth to Nature, and whom light and darkness, and the whole train of globes, encircle with eternal music.
Towards our day Shakespeare, in the Mercl,ant of Venice, said:
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st But in his motion like an angel sings ;
Milton, in .Paradise Lost:
Ben Jonson:
the fix'd stars, fix'd in their orb that flies, And ye five other wand'ring fires that move In mystic dance not without song;
Spheres keep one musick, they one measure dance;
and Addison doubtless had it in mind in his beautiful astronomical hymn:
Forever singing as they shine.
Kepler assigned the various tones in music to the various planets, one issuing from each of the spheres : the bass from Saturn and Jupiter, the tenor from Mars, the contralto from Venus, and the soprano from Mercury. The conception of the Milky Way as a pathway always and everywhere has been current. This is seen in the Romans' Via ooeli regia; Via 1aatil and Via lactea, the Kylke way and Kylke whyte way in Eden's rendering; Semita 1actea, the Milky Footpath; and Ovid's
High Road paved with stars to the court of Jove;
imitated, in .Paradise .Lost, by Milton's
the much quoted
The Way to God's eternal house,
Broad and ample road whose dust is gold, And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear Seen in the galaxy, that milky way Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest Powder'd with stars.
The Norsemen knew it as the Path of the Ghosts going to Valboll (Valhalla), in the region Gladhsheimr,- the palace of their heroes slain in battle;



The Galaxy 477
and our North American Indians had the same idea, as witness the" wrinkled old Nokomis," when, teaching the little Hiawatha, she
Showed the broad white road in heaven, Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows, Running straight across the heavens, Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows, To the Kingdom of Ponemah, To the land of the hereafter ;
the brighter stars along the Road marking their camp-fires. William Hamilton Hayne's Indian Fancy embodies it thus:
Pure leagues of stars from garish light withdrawn Behind celestial lace-work pale as foam,1 think between the midnight and the dawn Souls pass through you to their mysterious home.
Our aborigines and the Eskimo also called it the Amen Path, as did the Bushmen of Africa,-the ashes hot and glowing, instead of cold and dark, that benighted travelers might see their way home,- thus unwittingly following the classical Manilius:
this was once the Path Where Phoebus drove; and in length of Years The heated track took Fire and burnt the Stars. The Colour changed, the Ashes strew'd the Way, And still preserve the marks of the Decay;
although he also more scientifically wrote:
Anne magis densa stellarum turba corona.
Among the early Hindus it was the Path of Arya.min, leading to his throne in Elysium; in the Panjab it is Berl di ghia, the Path of Noah's Ark; and in northern India, llagavithi, the Path of the Snake. The Patagonians think it the road on which their dead friends are hunting ostriches. ,. The Anglo-Saxons knew it as Watlinga Btrat,- Hoveden's Watlingaltrete,- the path of the Wretlings, the giant sons of King Wretla, Vate, or lvalde; Minsheu thus defining the word:

those of other :Roman " 'Yaies" in early Britain. Old Thomas Hood similarly could see no derivation for this title,
except it be in regard of the narrowness it seemeth to have, or else in respect of that great highway that lieth between Dover and St. Albans.
This was variously known as Werl&m Str,&t, Wadlyng Street, Vatlant Street, and lastly Watling Street,1 the ancient road still in use from Chester (the ancient Deva), through London (Londinium), to Dover (Dubri.s Portus); and its stellar connection appears in the Hous of Fame:
Lo, there, quod he, cast up thine eye. Se yonder, lo, the Galaxye, Which men clepeth the Milky Wey, For hilt is whytt, and some parfey, Callen bit Watlinge Strete.
Another title, Walayngham Way, first found in Langland's Vision of 1-fu/iam coneerning Hers PI011J111an, made it the road to the Virgin Mary in heaven, as the earthly way was to her shrine in Norfolk, where she was known as our Lady of Walsyngham; this existing till 1538, when England abolished her monasteries. The idea of this, and of other similar path-titles, may have come from the fancy that this heavenly way crowded with stars resembled the earthly roads crowded with pilgrims. Angla-Saxon glossaries have it as Iringel Uueg, Weg, or Weo, Iringe's Way; and as Bil-Idun'■ Way, these personages being descendants of Wretla,-and both Ways leading to Asgard over the bridge at which Slavonic mythology terminated this celestial way, and thus joined earth to heaven," where four monks guard the sacred road and cut to pieces all who attempt to traverse it." Later on this Aagarcl Bridge was the title indiscriminately applied to the Milky Way and Rainbow, varied, as to the latter, by Bifrost or Asbreu. And here I may be pardoned for repeating a quaintly beautiful passage from Minsheu's definition of the Rainbow, although not connected with the Galaxy, nor strictly astronomical:
Tl,t Bow is 1/,t Wt!aJ>on of warre and lhtrifort called the Bow of the battell, 'II Zach. 9· 10. {battle-bow) & 10. 4. (id). Tl,t Bow tAal ap~artlA i,e tht clouds /,a/I, 1111 string, ,eor no deadly arrow prtpartd upon it, thtrt i.r no wrath that appearetb in it; ti tli.iJ11r Arcus clementiae er' foederis, indicans mundum non secundo peritorum aquis. And tArrr
fort wt should IO'Vt him tl,at l,atl, laid asidt Ms wrath, and nnlmutd us wit!, merru.
It will be remembered that Minsheu's was a polyglot dictionary! Ves
111 is only fair to say that there are other derivations for Watling Street,-one by no meant improbable, Minsheu to the contrary notwithstanding. namely, that it was called after Vitellianus, the Roman director in its construction, whom the Briton5 knew as Guetalin.

pucci, a century before, expressed much the same sentiment where - but connecting the Bible with Science - he wrote, in Eden's rendering:
It is a pledge of peace bctweene god and meii, and is ever directly over ageynst the soonne.
Grimm, in Teutonic Mythology, cites many titles for the Galaxy. Among the Northmen it was Wuotanes Weg, or Strua, Wuotan's,or Woden's, Way, or Street; among the Midland Dutch, Vronelden Strut, the Women's Street, and Hilde, or Hulde, Straue, Saint Hilda's, or Hulda's, Street; in Jutland, Veierveien, or Brunel, Strut; in Westphalia, Wiar Strate, the Weather Street, and Killen Weg, the Milky Way; and in East Friesland, Harmawith and the Kelkpath. In Hungary it was Hada Xuttya, the Via Belli, because in the journey of war and migration from Asia their ancestors followed this shining mark; and the Finns have the pretty Linnlllll'8,ta, the Birds' Way, as the winged spirits flit thither to the free and happy land, or because the united bird-songs once were turned into a cloud of snow-white dovelets still seen overhead. This was the Lithuanian Paubzcziu Xieli.L In Germany the modern J[iloh Struse is the translation of our bestknown title; while it has long been, and popularly is even now, .Ja.koba Straue and .Ja.koba Weg, Jacob's Road ; as the Belt of Orion is his Staff lying alongside the road. And it has been still further ass.ociated with that patriarch as his Ladder. In Sweden the Milky Way is the Winter Street,-so, at all events, with the peasantry,-their Winter Gatan; and that country's idea ofit is thus beautifully given by Miss Edith M. Thomas:
Silent with star-dust, yonder it lies The Winter Street, so fair and so white; Winding along through the boundless skies, Down heavenly vale, up heavenly height.
Faintly it gleams, like a summer road When the light in the west is sinking low, Silent with star-dust! By whose abode Does the Winter Street in its windings go?
And who are they, all unheard and unseenO, who are they, whose blessed feet Pass over that highway smooth and sheen? What pilgrims travel the Winter Street ?
Are they not those whom here we miss In the ways and the days that are vacant below? As the dust of that Street their footfalls kiss Does it not brighter and brighter grow?



Star-Names and their Meanings
Steps of the children there may stray Where the broad day shines though dark earth sleeps, And there at peace in the light they play, While some one below still wakes and weeps.
The old Norsemen had a similar title in their Vetrarbraut; and the Celts knew it as Arianroc1, the Silver Street, which also occurs for the Northem Crown, but there as the Silver Circle. In England, for centuries, the Galaxy has been the Way of 8aid J--. sometimes the Way t.o Saint Ja11l81, and thus figuratively the Vuz regia; in Italy, the Via latte&; in France, the Voie lut6e. But with the French peasantry it always has been the Road of Saint Juq1111 of CoapClltella, this last itself a stellar word from the Campus Stellae of Theodomir, bishop of Idria, who was guided by a star in 835 to the bones of Saint James in a field. The same title obtains in Spain, but there it is popularly known as Bl Camino de Santiago, the patron saint in battle of that country, Long• fellow writing of this in his Galaxy :
The Spaniard sees in thee the pathway, where His patron saint descended in the sheen Of his celestial armor, on serene And quiet nights when all the heavens were fair.
In the Basque tongue it is Ceruoo Blnibiclia. Wherever this idea of a road was held in early times it seems to ha1·c referred to the Milky Way as traveled by the departing souls of illustrious men, who, Manilius wrote, were
loos'd from the ignoble Chain Of Clay, and sent to their own Heaven again.
to those stars, that were regarded not only as the homes of such, but often as the very souls themselves physically shining in the skies, as, metaphorically, they had upon the earth. Thus it was known in classical times as Heroum Seclea. Following out this conception, the Galaxy later became the Italian Strada c1i Jloma; the Swiss Weg uf Rom; the Slovak Zelta v'Bim,-all signifying the" Way of Rome," because only through that capital of the church could access to heaven be secured. Thomas Moore somewhat changed the figure in his .un,es ofth Angtls, where he says as to the stars in general :
Rolling along like living cars Oflight, for gods to journey by!
a thought that also is found with Pliny, and even with Saint ClemenL



The Galaxy
Romieu says that the Galaxy was Jhlarati, probably Assyrian, and identifies it with the hieroglyphic Kurati, the Course of the sun-god, that may be the origin of the story of Phaethon, and we see very much the same title in the Babylonian Creation Legend as applied to the zodiac. This word, similar to the Hebrew Kaair6th that some Rabbis positively asserted signifies the" Milky Way," appears in Stoffler's De Splurera as J[aia. rati, apparently taken from Ptolemy, and supposed by Canon Cook, in the Speahrs Commmtary on the Book of Job, xxxviii, 32, to be the equivalent of the Arabic Al Kajarrah, the Milky Track.
In addition to this last,-Riccioli's Almegiret,-the Arabians had 'f~ al Laban of the same meaning, but also knew the Galaxy as J;)arb al Ti•
binln, the Path of the Chopped Straw Carriers, and as 'J.'arlf al Tibn, the Straw Road. Riccioli gave this as the Hebrew lleclhlbath Tebhen, correctly llethi·
hhath, which the Syrians translated Bh•bhn Tebhni; the Persians, Rah Xakeeban, or simply Katelhan; the Copts, Pimoit ende pitoh; and the Turks, 8amin Ugh'rili. These last also called it llagjiler Yiili, the Pilgrims' Road, traversed in their annual journey to Mecca. Riccioli also cited the" Aethiopian" Chuara taamangadu; and Grimm, the same country's Puare Zamanegade, the Straw Stalks lying in the Road; - both probably from one original differently transcribed. And a singular legend, from some unknown source, tells us that these Stalks, or Chopped Straw, marking the Pilgrims' Road, were dropped by Saint Venus (!) after her theft from Saint Peter; hence her Armenian title Hartacol, or Hartacogh, the Straw-thief. In China it shared the zodiac's name of the Yellow Road, from the color of this scattered straw. In classic folk-lore the Milky Way was marked out by the com ears dropped by Isis in her flight from Typhon; or was the result of some of Juno's nursery troubles with the infant Hercules. Alluding to these; Manilius wrote that it justly draws Its name, the Milky Circle, from its cause.
From this doubtless came the Roman Oiroul111 J'unoni111. Early India accounted for it in somewhat the same way in connection with Sarama; and a similar thought is expressed by the Arabic Umm al Sami', the Mother of the Sky. Cur Gwydyon, the Castle of Gwydyon, the enchanter son of Don, the King of the Fairies, is one of its Celtic titles in more modem times, others of the family appearing in Cassiopeia and Corona Borealis. But the Celts also thought it the road along which Gwydyon pursued his erring wife. 31

The Incas of Peru said that it was the dust of stars, and gave titles to its various parts; the Ottawa Indians, that it was the muddy water stirred up by a turtle swimming along the bottom of the sky; while the Polynesian islanders know it as the Long, Blue, Cloud. .ting Shark.
In poetry, too, the Milky Way has ever been a favorite-indeed, a
hackneyed - subject. Miss Myra Reynolds tells us in her 7reab#nll ef Nature in Eng/isl, &try :
From Waller on, the Milky Way typifies virtues so numerous that they shine in enc undistinguished blaze;
and that Swift's Apollo's Edict of 1720, among its prohibitions to authors of , the use of some of the more wearisomely frequent similitudes, specifically forbids their even naming the Milky Way,- a rule that would have been ' equally applicable to the classical authors as to those of our day. Among the former, Manilius wrote of it :
as a beaten Path that spreads between A troden Meadow, and divides the Green. Or as when Seas are plow'd behind the Ship, Foam curls on the green surface of the Deep. In Heaven's dark surface such this Circle lies, And parts with various Light the Azure skies. Or as when Iris draws her radiant Bow Such seems this Circle to the World below.
Among recent poetical similes we find Edward Young's

Joseph Rodman Drake's

and in the Culprit Fay:

while in the Lady of Shalott he likens the " gemmy bridle" of Sir Lancelot to some branch of stars we sec Hung in the golden Galaxy.

This was built by the lovers Zulamith and Salami that they might be united in heaven as they had been on earth.
They toiled and built a thousand years In love's all powerful might : And so the Milky Way was madeA starry bridge of light;
and when the task was successfully accomplished they were merged together in the single star Sirius. Homer strangely did not allude to it, unless he may have personified it in the Iliad. Nor did Ptolemy express any opinion as to its nature, although he called it the Band,- Fuaia in one Latin translation,- and fully described it in the 8th book of the Syn/axis; his account of it being considered " certainly superior to all the rather fantastic representations given in the maps published before the last quarter of our century." Dante gave much attention to it in his Convito, repeating various of the opinions of the ancient philosophers. He said that Anaxagoras considered it reflected light from the sun, an opinion shared by Aristotle, Democritus, and even by the later Avicenna (lbn Sina of Bokhara) of about A. D. 1000; and he attributed to Aristotle another theory- that it was the gathering of vapors under the stars of that region. His own ]jnes in the Paradiso
distinct with less and greater lights Glimmers between the two poles of the world
accurately describe it, as does his
Galassia si, che fa dubbiar hen -saggi ;
for speculation concerning it was almost as varied as its observers. Aristotle expressed still a third opinion, that it was the gases from the earth set on fire in the sky; Oinopides and Metrodorus considered it the early course of the sun abandoned· after the bloody banquet of Thyestes; the Pythagoreans and others, that it marked the blazing path of the disastrous runaway when, as in the Infer110,
Phaeton abandoned the reins, Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;
or, as in Longfellow's TM Galaxy:
Phaeton's wild course that scorched the skies Where'er the hoofs of his hot coursers trod.



Star-Names and their Meanings
Some thought it the sunbeams left behind in the track of the sun's chariot, - the Veatigium. Solis, that Macrobius termed Zona peruta, the Girdle Burned; and others, Via peruata. Plutarch said that it was the shadow of the earth as the sun passed beneath us. Diodorus the Sicilian, of the 1st century before Christ, and the philosopher-naturalist Theophrastus, of the 3d, asserted that it marked the junction of the two starry hemispheres, - a statement thus versified by Manilius:
Whether the Skies grown old here shrink their frame, And through the chinks admit an upper Flame, Or whether here the Heaven's two Halves are joyn'd, But odly clos'd, still leave a Seam behind. Or here the parts in Wedges closely prest, To fix the Frame, are thicker than the Rest. Like Clouds condens'd appear, and bound the Sight, The Azure being thickened into White.
Even as late as 1603 Bayer wrote:
Constat hie circulus ex tenui nebulosa substantia;
and such probably was the general scientific conception of the Galaxy until seven years later Galileo's " glazed optic tube" reveale~ its larger constituent stars, and, as he wrote in the Nu,uius Sidereus,
got rid of disputes about the Galaxy . • . for it is nothing else bnt a mass of innumerable stars planted together in clusters.
A few, however, even in antiquity seem to have known, or at least suspected, its true character; for Democritus, the master of Epicurus, about 460 B. c., and Pythagoras before him, said that it was a vast assemblage oi very distant stars, in which belief Aristotle seems to have coincided; although several other, and absurd, opinions are attributed to this eminent man, as well as to Democritus. Manilius thus expressed this belief:
Or is the spatious Bend serenely bright From little Stars, which there their Beams unite, And make one solid and continued Light?
Arabian poets wrote similarly, as Ta'abbata Sharran, whose verse is quoted in the .(famasan,
The Mother of clustered stars.
Our knowledge of it may thus briefly be summed up: It covers more than one tenth of the visible heavens, containing nine tenths of the visible stars, and seems a vast zone-shaped nebula, nearly a great circle of the sphere, the

poles being in Coma and Cetus. In a measure it can be resolved by slight optical aid into innumerable stars, although even the largest telescopes wilJ not resolve the faintest parts. Many of these stars are small, "not at all comparable with our sun in dimensions." It is inclined about 63° to the celestial equator, and, Sir John Herschel wrote,
is to sidereal what the invariable ecliptic is to planetary astronomy-a plane of ultimate reference, the ground-plane of the sidereal system.
Our position close to its central plane is not favorable to a correct survey; but, as we see it, it is marked by strange cavities and excrescences, with branches in all directions, and is interrupted in its course, especially at Ophiuchus and Argo, apparently by the operation of some force still at work,-these interruptions being in its width as well as in its course. Its apparent structure is not uniform, but curdled or flaky,- bright patches alternating with faint or with almost abso!ute vacancies. While it contains a large number of star-clusters, it has but few true nebulae, although among these are the important' Horseshoe Nebula below Seutum, the Dumb-bell in Vulpecula, and the Trifid in Sagittarius; yet large diffused masses of nebulosity are found in several portions of it. Pickering's spectroscopic work seems to indicate that the Milky Way forms a system separate from the rest of the sidereal universe; but Gould inclined to the opinion that it is " the resultant of two or more superposed galaxies," which will perhaps account for the brighter portions in Cassiopeia and Crux as representing " the intersection of the two crossed rings visibly diverging in Ophiuchus." And Miss Clerke thus concludes the chapter on the Milky Way in her System of the Stars:
What is nnmistakable is that the entire formation, whether single or compound, is no iaoJated phenomenon. All the contents of the firmament are arranged with reference to it.. It is 8 large part of a larger scheme exceeding the compass of finite minds to grasp in
4ts entirety.
