According to historian Kanaklal Barua, the term Koch is of aboriginal origin and is used to refer to an ethnic group from Kamata kingdom. Koches are a trans-border community, like the Garos and the Khasis. They live in separate countries which were carved out of their ancestral lands.On the other hand, the term Rajbanshi, according to A. C. Choudhury is supposedly derived from Aryan or Dravidian word Rajvamsi meaning "Kshatriya or people belong to royal race or descendants of the king". Swarna Lata Baruah indicates that the word 'Rajvamsi' refers to a distinct Dravidian community.
The Koch-Rajbongshi tribe were ethnically and culturally related to the same Koch Dynasty who ruled their land and vice versa, i.e., the Koch dynasty of Assam, northern Bengal, Rangpur part. Many however trace this etymological relation to the dynasties prior to that of the Koches.In Assam the Koches are officially recognized by the Government of Assam as 'Koch-Rajbongshi', in West Bengal they are known as 'Rajbongshi', 'Rajbanshi','Poliya' and 'Koch', in Nepal they are known as 'Rajbanshi' and 'Koch'. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajbongshi_people
The Rajbongshis were traditionally agriculturalists, but due to their numerical dominance in North Bengal there were significant occupational differences among them. Most were agricultural labourers (halua) or sharecroppers (adhiar). These often worked for landed cultivators, called dar-chukanidars. Above them were the chukandiars and jotedars, and at the top were the zamindars. Some Rajbongshis were zamindars or jotedars. (Barman, Rup Kumar. "A new Look on the transition of Caste identity into Cultural identity of the Rajbanshis of Northern Bengal and Lower Assam" (PDF). The Mirror: 56–70.)

According to Yogini Tantra, Koches were called as Kuvacha. (The Yogini Trantra, which was composed in Assam itself in about the 16th century, refers to the Koches
as kuvachas(Nath:3)).According to Tabaqat-i-Nasiri , Kamrud(Kamrup) was inhabited by

the Koch , Mech & Tharu (Cooch behar was inhabited by Makh (Mech) and Kuj (Koch) .
Raja belong to First tribe(Salam , 1902:11) According to Fatiyah-i-Ibriah, Cooch behar was inhabited Koch ( Cooch behar was inhabited by Makh (Mech) and Kuj (Koch) . Raja belong to First tribe(Salam , 1902:11)) Although some Koch and Mech called themselves as Koch Rajbongshi (royal) in Cooch Behar. But they are different from Rajbongshi people related to Dravidian and Aryan affinities. The Koch and The Rajbanshi both the terms refer to some groups of people but the basic difference between the two terms- the former is aborigine; while the latter is Aryan or Dravidian origin. The term Koch or Mech used in order to identify one of the plain ethnic groups from Kamrupa-Kamata kingdom (Barua 2008 189) [1]. On the other hand the term ‘Rajbanshi’ presumed to be derived from the Sanskrit or Dravidian word ‘Rajvamsi’ means Khsartiya or people belong to royal race or descendants of the king (Choudhary 2011 09) [4], whereas the term ‘Rajvamsi’ also refers to a distinct community of Dravidian affinities (Baruah 2007 203) [2]. (Halder , 2017) A big part of Koch history is that of Koch dynasty. Koch Hajo was a Bhuyan who had two daughter Hira and Jira.("History Book of Cooch Behar". coochbehar.nic.in.) Hajo was popular figure worshiped by Bodo people.(Bodo(Mech) worshiped Hajo Raja (Hodgson , 1847:167; Chaudhuri, Harendra Narayan (1903). The Cooch Behar state and its land revenue settlements. Cooch Behar. pp. 225, 226.) Hira and Jira married to Hariya of Mech. Jira gave birth to Chandan and Madan, and Hira gave birth to Bishu (Viswa Singha) and Sishu (Sisya Singha). Bishu was the bravest and smartest. Who was the progenitor of Narayana dynasty of Cooch Behar. (Chaudhuri, Harendra Narayan (1903). The Cooch Behar state and its land revenue settlements. Cooch Behar. pp. 225, 226.) See: http://coochbehar.nic.in/Htmfiles/history_book.html Translated from "Kochbiharer Itihas", 2nd edition (1988), by Shri. Hemanta Kumar Roy Barma, M.A.,B.L.

Rajbongshi man in the late 19th century
The name Cooch Behar is derived from the name of the Koch or Rajbongshi tribes.(Pal, Dr. Nripendra Nath (2000). Itikathai Cooch Behar (A brief history of Cooch Behar). Kolkata: Anima Prakashani. pp. 11–12). The word behar is derived from Sanskrit: विहार vihara....During the British Raj, Cooch Behar was the seat of the princely state of Koch Bihar, ruled by the Koch Kingdom of often described as the Shiva Vansha, tracing their origin from the Koch tribe of North-eastern India...Cooch Behar formed part of the Kamarupa Kingdom of Assam from the 4th to the 12th centuries. In the 12th century, the area became a part of the Kamata Kingdom, first ruled by the Khen dynasty from their capital at Kamatapur. The Khens were an indigenous tribe, and they ruled till about 1498 CE, when they fell to Alauddin Hussain Shah, the independent Pathan Sultan of Gour. The new invaders fought with the local Bhuyan chieftains and the Ahom king Suhungmung and lost control of the region. During this time, the Koch tribe became very powerful and proclaimed itself Kamateshwar (Lord of Kamata) and established the Koch dynasty. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooch_Behar
